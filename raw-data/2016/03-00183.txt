Dear indologists,

I'm looking for a PDF copy of 

Sharma, M.M. 1978. Inscriptions of Ancient Assam. Guwahati: Dept. Publications Guwahati University.

And of the follow parts of book:

Hudson, D.D. 2002. "Self Sacrifice as Truth in India." 
Harlan, L. 2002. "Truth and Sacrifice. Sati Immolations in India."

Both should be part of

M. Cormack, Sacrificing the self: perspectives on martyrdom and religion. New York: OUP.

Best,
Paolo
