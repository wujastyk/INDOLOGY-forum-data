 Subject: [INDOLOGY] pa?cako?a
   
Dear Friends,?
I'm writing a book chapter about the anthropology of tourism and embodiment. I have decided to include various 'yogic' perspectives. I am considering how to include classical ideas like pa?cako?a concept with contemporary practitioner-based ideas of embodiment.?
I would appreciate any suggestions and specific textual references that possibly discuss the idea of 'embodiment'. Two that come to mind are vedam?rti and ??ntam?rti. Another is sam?dhivigraha, however, I do not as yet have any textual sources for this term.?
I am curious to know about the first attested mention of the pa?cako?a? I am reading through the pa?cada?? text, which I have found mention in secondary literature was maybe written in the 14th century. Although my assumption is that the pa?cako?a concept appears earlier than that. ?
Thanks in advance.?



All the best,
