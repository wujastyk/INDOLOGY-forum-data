Dear Colleagues,


While one may reasonably argue that the corporal metonymy of var?a in the Puru?as?kta is non-hierarchical and instead based on a vision of organic unity, I would suggest (and have argued in my recent book _Crossing the Lines of Caste_) one can observe the beginnings of the hierarchical division between Br?hma?a and K?atriya categories in the Aitareya Br?hma?a?s ?una??ep?khy?na (c. 750-500BCE?), where it still seems possible for a radical fellow like Vi?v?mitra to assert that he is *both* Brahm??a and K?atriya, a notion that would defeat hierarchical divisions, but one that ?una??epa finds a bit difficult to accept. 

For at the same time, we find in the same narrative an explicit condemnation of ??dras (AB 7.17) and Dasyus, and a statement that Br?hma?as are better than K?atriyas (7.15, bh?y?n vai br?hma?o k?atriy?t). Admittedly this is in the context of being a sacrificial victim for Varu?a, but perhaps that is not so different in Vedic social thought.

All best wishes,
Adheesh

So in all the four quarters, it means that four varNas are depicted as forming equi-status components of an organic entity.
