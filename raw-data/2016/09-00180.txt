Subject: [INDOLOGY] Story in South Asian Literature?
Message-ID: <34975E0D-0D12-4E68-AB6F-EC7EFE86F07F@mso.umt.edu>

Dear Colleagues,

A colleague in Chinese Studies, who is working on a cycle of stories that involve a giant who destroys villages by defecating on them, was wondering if there were any parallels in South Asian literature. I was unable to help him. If anyone knows of such stories in South Asian literature, I would appreciate receiving references.

Many Thanks,
Brad
