Dear David et al.,
Commentaries may have discussed it as ?r?aprayoga but if we try to take the
meta-narrative seriously, could it rather have been ... (still) "bandit's"
prayoga  (bandit with b)? At this early stage, the transformation of dacoit
Ratn?kara to V?lm?ki (see at YouTube under "Ratnakar to Valmiki" for some
modern representations of this episode) would not yet have been complete.
At least his language would still have beginners' and learner's mistakes,
and a "hypersanskritization" such as an aorist injunctive with an augment
superfluously added (which can hardly be interpreted as archaic or
primitive or colloquial).
Best, Jan
.

This is not because such 'aberrant' forms were pre-Paninian.  For the Epics
(and in fact only the Mahabharata) know only a handful - moreover rather
doubtful - Vedisms. ......Almost always it is metrical exigencies which
forced the poets to use a form not sanctioned by traditional grammar....the
"irregularities' are very often found at a metrically relevena position of
the stanza: "Metre surpasses grammar".

his study, not without problems of its own, could be redone with more

of a study of books II-IV van Daalen concludes that the Poet Valmiki wrote
mostly "correct" classical Sanskrit -- this does not necessarily always
correspond to "Paninian" sanskrit, and the poor definition of van Daalen's
"irregularities" is one of the weaknesses in his study, which could however
be "repaired" to some extent by referring to other forms of acceptable yet
not strictly Paninian sanskrit (cf. Narayana Bhatta's Apaniniyapramanata
and www.academia.edu/28515426).

plausible original reconstructed and practically there was from the time
of, let us say, the first repetition of the text no original Ramayana"
(quoted in van Daalen's study, p. 6).

answered it. Sorry for my ignorance of the relevant material on this verse.

although used with m?. My understanding is that, since aorists largely fell
out of use after the Vedic period, they are not at all common in the
R?m?ya?a. So here is my question. Assuming that this is in fact V?lm?ki?s
first ?loka, would this point to an original R?m?ya?a that is considerably
older than the R?m?ya?a we now have? Could the R?m?ya?a as now extant have
been reworked, updated in language so to speak, from an earlier original?
For example, F. E. Pargiter in his detailed study, The Pur?na Text of the
Dynasties of the Kali Age (1913), found considerable evidence that in the
oldest pur??as (V?yu, Brahm???a, Matsya) the verses had been Sanskritized
from an earlier literary Prakrit, and that these Sanskrit verses had in
turn been condensed and rewritten directly in Sanskrit in some other
pur??as (Vi??u, Bh?gavata).
