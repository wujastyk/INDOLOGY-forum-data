Dear colleagues and friends
I have a very old font for transliterating devanagari. Now both my printers refuse to print anything written with this font.
Could anyone kindly recommend a recent easy transliteration font to me hors liste using my sympatico address? Many thanks!
Greetings to all
Stella Sandahl

Those who are devoted to knowledge enter, as it were, into a greater darkness.?
