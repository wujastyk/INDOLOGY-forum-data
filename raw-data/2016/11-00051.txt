Gaining legitimacy through identification with the Vedas is nothing new. The Srivaishnavas took the first-millennium hymns of the Divyaprabandham and made them the ?Tamil Veda.? I?m not sure exactly when this happened, but probably about the 10th or 11th millennium CE. The poems themselves describe how moving they are when sung, but unfortunately in order to stress their ?Vedic? status, they came to be recited like the Vedas, mechanically and without the music, which must have been quite beautiful. When recited in front of a deity, certain phonemes (I forget exactly which ones) are changed to softer phonemes lest the reciter inadvertently pollute the deity. Recitation of the Divyaprabandham is part of the worship in many Vaishnava temples in the south, and its words are considered on a par with those of the Vedas. The Divyaprabandham itself, which dates to the first millennium CE, goes to great lengths to identify Vishnu worship with the Vedas. George
