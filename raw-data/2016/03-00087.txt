I have been teaching that c?na in Sanskrit sources refers to the Qin dynasty. I have no idea where I got that, so someone correct me if I am wrong.

Hi Deven,

I've seen c?na, without "mah?-" not infrequently. See, for an example, Mah?bh?rata 2.23.19 of the critical edition. I can't recall where else off the top of my head.
