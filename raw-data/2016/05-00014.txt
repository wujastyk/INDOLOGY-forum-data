Thank you, Dominik, for the article, and Ram-prasad, for the insightful comments.

The term ?right-wing? seems inappropriate since it super-imposes yet another layer of Christian designations onto a different set of issues for the Hindu diaspora and next gen struggling to make sense of their history and find agency in its articulation.

There are two things alarming to me:

(1) Issues of caste are often brought immediately to the front in Hindu chapters, as if that?s the core of Hinduism. One could argue there are more interesting and central issues children could learn, and, as noted by others, the racism, bigotry, etc. in Abrahamic history is often not highlighted in adjacent chapters. Why?

(2) Much controversy could be erased if publishers allowed well established academics in RS, Indology, etc., who are Hindu, write the chapters. My understanding is that the publishers won't pass their agency over to Hindu scholars, even those with distinguished careers in academia.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann

Looking at undergraduates in Britain, a great deal more of unvarnished reality is needed.
