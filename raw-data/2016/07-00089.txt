Sharing a portion of Bheeshmaparva as a pdf here.

Though this may not exactly match with the passage quoted, you have the
word Bhaarata in the name of a geopolitical unit discussed in the
Bheeshmaparva of Mahabharata.

It has:

?????????? ?????

????? ????? ????? ??????? ???????? ?????

????????????? ????????? ?????? ????????? ??? ??

Sanjaya's answer to this question is a description of the 'richness of
Bharata Varsha' .He describes  Bharata Varsha in that context.

It is said here:

???? ?? ???????????? ????? ???? *???????*

??????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ?? ??

???????? ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????

?????????? ????????? ?????? ???? *???????* ??


The following description from Vishnupurana may come close to the quoted
passage:

?????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ????? ??? ????? ????
?????? ?? - Vishnu Purana (2.3.1)
