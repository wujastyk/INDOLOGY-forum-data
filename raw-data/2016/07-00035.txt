Subject: [INDOLOGY] glass in ancient India
Message-ID: <CAEhxeU3a7rk8K2ORirYhOoVYN=_wtXNs52t4Ed-oUkNisoa7Sg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Can anyone point me to publications on the making and use of glassware in
ancient India? I am particularly interested in bottles (k?p?), as these
appear relatively late in medical literature in the context of alchemical
procedures.

Many thanks!

Dagmar
