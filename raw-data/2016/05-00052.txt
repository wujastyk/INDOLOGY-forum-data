 Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Early Representations of OM
   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranganathaswamy_Temple,_Srirangam has the following description. "The vimanam(shrine over the sanctum sanctorum), the Ranga vimana is shaped like omkara (om symbol) and is plated withgold."Similar descriptions of Vimana being in Pranava shape is given for many Tamil Nadu temples.e.g. here:https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GTMTQLuCNSMC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=ancient+temple+om+shape&source=bl&ots=bBvUihgOMi&sig=usYmgy4MXCL4dNcyu-HJ1DpaUSc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9yu2QksfMAhVGk5QKHQKtAYU4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&q&f=false
