I believe some of the other essays from the panel to which Jonathan contributed this piece can be found in the same issue.
Anantanand Rambachan has also written a response to Malhotra's work, as well as to the personal attacks launched against him by Malhotra and his followers.?

 I would be surprised if any of us want to enage him as a fellow scholar. He is simply a piece of contemporary Hindu history, however bizarre and disreputable one may find him. Scholars not inclined to contemporary Hindu affairs may well find little in Malhotra to interest them.?

Dear Colleagues,
I would point out that Rajiv Malhotra is a known, unapologetic plagiarist. He regularly makes ad hominem attacks. He has endorsed stories written in The Onion, a satirical newspaper. I'm not sure that I see much here with which to engage on an academic level.

Thank you for posting this Dominik.
Given his popularity I think there is a great need for the Indological community to review his books.
Best,
Dean

 Subject: [INDOLOGY] reviews of Malhotra's books
  
Is someone collecting a bibliography of serious reviews of Rajiv Malhotra's books?? Are there considered writings that could be relayed to someone interested in reasoned, academic responses to Malhotra's views?
Best,Dominik
