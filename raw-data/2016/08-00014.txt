Dear list,

Many thanks to Michael Witzel, Alessandro Battistini, Manu Francis, 
Balogh D?niel, and Jean Michel Delire for their speedy and informed 
replies to my query.

As I suspected, the phrase is a string of numbers (bh?tasa?khy?).

One can find more details in Salomon, 1998, Indian Epigraphy (p173) and 
Kielhorn, "The Epoch of the Newar Era", /Indian Antiquary/ 17.  For the 
specific words used in bh?tasa?khy?-s, see B?hler's Indian Paleography 
(pp.84-86) or Kale's History of Dharma??stra vol. 5.1 (pp. 701-703).  
See also a blog by P?ter Sz?nt? 
(http://tibetica.blogspot.hu/2008/02/bhtasakhy.html).

There were a few different suggestions on how to resolve the reading and 
the digits, but 952 is the consensus vote:

khacara = nine planets = 9
?ara = k?ma's five arrows = 5
ya?a = ??

khacara = 9
?ara = 5
ya?a = yama = 2
Therefore -- 952 NS = 1831-2

khacara = 9
?ara = 5
ya?a = ayana = 2 (sun has two courses)
Therefore -- 952 NS

cara = 1 (an educated guess)
kha = 0
?ara = 5
ya?a = ayana = 2
Therefore -- 1052 NS = 1931-2

I have not seen this manuscript in person.  The contents are a portion 
of the Mah?vastu, Senart 2.397.8-3.90.10.  I have no expertise in 
Nepalese manuscripts and am a novice Newari script reader, but I would 
lean towards the earlier date of 952.  That one seems more likely purely 
from a philological standpoint.  And even if the ya?a digit ends up 
changing, it would not change the date very much as the last digit.  If 
anyone has any thoughts on the reading or handwriting, please do let us 
know.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Justin Fifield
