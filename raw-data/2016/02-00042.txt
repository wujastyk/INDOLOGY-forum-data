Subject: [INDOLOGY] use of the title "deva" (Malwa, beg. 13th c.)
Message-ID: <CAOYD-QDGzN-Twi6EnyW3_sH=9fHmGVqF7gtuc7R8Vbne0hgZCw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

was the title "deva" used only with reference to someone who has already
been consecrated as king or generally to any (male?) of royal descent?

Arjunavarman I of the Param?ras (Malwa, beg. of the 13th c.) styles himself
"Arjunavarmadeva" in his introduction to his commentary on the Amaru?ataka.
I was wondering if it is legitimate to conclude from that that he was
already on the throne at the time when he composed the ??k?.

Best,
Gaia
