Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with an inscribed object -- one more try

I have not been able to read the entire text, but it appears to me that part of it reads:

tap?gaccha?r??r??r?

ratna?[e]kharas?ri

Mention of tap?gaccha  confirms that the object is a Jaina artifact.

Actually, I also have one with a date somewhat later than this. I think Losty, formerly of the British Museum, has published a book containing similar images. I will try to dig that up for you.

Is the language Sanskrit or a Sanskritized form of a different language? 4. Is it possible to figure out the meaning of the inscription (some of the characters are pretty worn down)?
