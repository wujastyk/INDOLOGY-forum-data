Subject: [INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock

Dear Professor Slaje, Dear Fellow List Members:

The Board, Consultative Members and Regional Directors of the IASS  
discussed the matter with our President Professor Kutumba Sastry and I  
may be allowed to quote him directly. Professor Sastry said:

  "I signed the petition purely in my personal capacity and I did not  
mention any of my designations for that matter or identity. The text  
of the petition sent to me was slightly different than the one finally  
sent to Sri Narayana Murthy."

I trust that the matter is now clarified. I thank Professor Kutumba  
Sastry Ji for his kind willingness to allow me to pass on the relevant  
section of his email to the IASS Board, etc.

With best,
yours sincerely,
Jay Soni
