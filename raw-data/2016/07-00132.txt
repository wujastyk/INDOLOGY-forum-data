Subject: [INDOLOGY]  Unicode Devanagari on Mac
Message-ID: <CA+wUuzMVBs0dexr45sGp2KwtUCKWfEUuZt0ZSYnqvAhzeVjiKA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

I have developed a software to type IAST/Devan?gar? on a Mac. The software
happens to also support Unicode Br?hm? output (currently well supported in
Pages) and also limited support for typing Vedic accents (to be expanded in
a future version).

I am happy to share the beta with Indology and would appreciate feedbacks
in case you try it out.

You can download the latest beta here:

The final version will be ready in <4 weeks.

Kindest Wishes,

Martin Gluckman
