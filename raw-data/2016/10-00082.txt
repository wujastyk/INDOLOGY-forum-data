Dear Nagaraj,

Many thanks for your reading of the yantra, and for the confirmation 
that it is indeed a yantra (though I would still be curious to know if 
cakra is sometimes used with the same meaning). I am sure the museum 
will be most appreciate of the information.

Also thanks to Arlo Griffiths for the references. A. A. ?l?czka's 
original doctoral thesis can be downloaded from Leiden University here:

Best wishes,
Jacob
