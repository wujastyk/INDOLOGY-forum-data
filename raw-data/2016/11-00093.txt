I prefer the expression ?Indian Astrology?, since the tradition was certainly not restricted to Hinduism either.

Their responses as to what they actually mean by it are revealing of a certain discomfort and cognitive dissonance. One particular respondent said they did not like the term but it was something of an 'industry standard', so not using the term was counter productive to their own vocational interest. They also said that 'Hindu astrology' sounded even 'less authentic'. This is while knowing that the predictive aspects of 'Vedic astrology' developed well past the Vedic period.

To the devotee this statement might seem unproblematic, but to the scholar it appears to conceptually and temporally conflate disparate things.

(For instance, V?ra?aivism is a bhakti tradition, but for the vast majority of V?ra?aivas it is not relevant whether bhakti can be called ?Vedic? or not.)

B?htlingk and Roth?s Petersburger W?rterbuch (vol. 5, col. 163) tells us that the word ?bhakti? is already found in the ?gveda (8,27,11) in the sense of ?distribution? (?Austheilung, Vertheilung?). B?htlingk and Roth give a long list of other, later meanings. But if you say

If, for instance, one soberly reads the Bhagavadg?t? without later commentaries, one must conclude that later ?bhakti? is a far cry from the rather subdued theism in that text. The same goes for the ?vet??vataropani?at.

With some imagination, one can declare all sorts of things ?Vedic? (my personal favourite is ?Vedic astrology?).

Everybody wants to be ?democratic?, even if there are big differences of opinion about just what democracy is and how it should be. Meanwhile, it?s November 8, and the world is shuddering?).
