Message-ID: <CA+H=kyS9MScRRFXebiDqwdx5n58WiVcCNRkujKehjD_tXdQdaQ@mail.gmail.com>

See also the Prelude to Act 2 of the ?gama?ambara (translated by Csaba
DEZS? as 'Much Ado About Religion' in the Clay Sanskrit Library series), in
which as a prank the Sn?taka's servant disguises himself as a Jain nun and
is then sexually harassed by a Jain monk ... who gets a shock.
