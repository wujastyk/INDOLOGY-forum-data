Sharing the snap shot of a book from the first page of the heap of hits for
????? ???????. it has "?????? ??????? ??????? ( ?????? ?? ????? ??????? ??
??? ??? ??????? ) ". It uses words ????? ?????? ( with printer's devils)
for greater accuracy. Most of these 'Hindi' pages have the English Vedic
Astrology in brackets after the Hindi ????? ???????. That itself makes it
clear what the source of the Hindi ????? ??????? is.

Patrick, your mentioning the internet and the web world itself shows who
the communicators and target audience are. I should have probably repeated
my more nuanced words from my other posts that  the 'educated'
(western/modern educated) among Indians are among the target audience
(apart from the ?????? ??? and ?????? ???? ???.)

When I said "Brahmin and non-Brahmin contemporary  busy practitioners do
not even need this English word or its Indian language forms such as Vaidik
or Vaidika", I had the non-internet scenario in mind. For instance, if a
general client starts out to visit a traditional Indian astrologer, he
says, ?? ????? ?? ?? ???? ???? ????? or something like that but does not
use the word ????? ???????. This ????? ?? does not use words like ?????
??????? on his sign board if at all he puts up one. Even in south India,
one does not say, ????? ???????????????  ???????? ???????  or something
like that. Similarly sign boards in south India, of a traditional Indian
astrologer do not contain words like ?????  ????????? .

Now, tribal jyotishya:

Patrick, I think most of the Indologists probably are aware of the presence
of tribal soothsayer /fortune teller character either male or female in
classical Indian narrative literature.

Most of the Indologists during their visits to India might have seen the
actual soothsaying /fortune telling performances/ sessions of tribal
soothsayers /fortune tellers.

But what I was talking about was a recent development , later even to my
contribution of the encyclopaedia entry
https://www.academia.edu/8612777/_Fortune_Tellers_in_South_Asian_Folklore_an_Encyclopaedia_Routledge_230-232._Margaret_Mills_et_al._ed_New_York._2003

Tribal soothsayers/fortune tellers are putting up advertisements in print
and electronic media, giving a city address for consultation. It even says
" We are the genuine tribals ('Koya doralam', koya is the name of a tribe
Koya doralam = lit. we are the Koya kings, meaning we are the Koya
people) " Their using the Sanskrit word jyotishya(m) is similar to the
tribal medicine practitioners using the word vaidya(m) to be able to
communicate to the non-tribal audience.

This is part of many other developments with regard to the 'urbanization'
of tribals, particularly that of the practitioners of tribal medicine,
tribal fortune telling and other tribal occult practices which have been
popular with the urban Indian people from centuries.
