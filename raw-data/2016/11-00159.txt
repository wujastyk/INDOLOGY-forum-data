Dear Nagaraj,

I am very curious about your claim about the ?source-claims?. Is there any jyoti?a text other than Ved??gajyoti?a of Lagadha that claims itself to be vaidika?

I don?t think the topic of ?source-claims? within the jyoti?a texts had been treated seriously. The Greco-Indian texts of Sphujidhavaja and M?nar?ja or even Var?hamihira all make interesting claims and referred to authors which had been speculated to be foreign, e.g., Maya > Ptolemy, Ma?ittha > Manethos, beside all the ?Yavanar?ja?-s including ?Yavane?vara" etc. 

Bill

The same seems to have been true of pre-Islamic Persian astrology. So I agree with Luis that 'sidereal' won't do as a synonym of 'Indian'. Indian astrology differs in many other technical respects from its cousin traditions further west: some aspects of the Hellenistic system never made it to India, or only did so a millennium later with the Perso-Arabic transmission, and new methods were developed in India, some on the basis of indigenous lore such as the nak?atras.

Also, at the time of Greek influence on Indian astronomy the two zodiacs more or less coincided, so there was no difference between sidereal and tropical (this applies to both Indian/South Asian astrology and to "Mediterranean" astrology). The date of when that happened will depend of exactly where one considers the beginning of Aries (the constellation) to be.
