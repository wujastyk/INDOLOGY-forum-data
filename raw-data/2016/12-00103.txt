Lambert Schmithausen's 1965 study "Ma??anami?ra's Vibhramaviveka?. Mit 
einer Studie zur Entwicklung der indischen Irrtumslehre" (Wien: 
?sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften) springs to mind. Ma??ana 
there classifies different error theories in terms of what appears 
(?tmakhy?ti, asatkhy?ti, anyath?khyati, akhy?ti).

That said, on a quick glance I haven't found any particular remarks 
concerning the semantics of khy?ti in Schmithausen's work, but it may be 
helpful nonetheless.

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
