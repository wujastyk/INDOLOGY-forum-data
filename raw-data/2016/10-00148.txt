A search for *rape* as the Text Word in the Puranic Encylopedia under
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PEScan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php
shows up the following:

Rape of Rambh? by R?va?a (VR, UK).
Rape [sic] of Vedavat? by R?va?a (VR, UK). In the VR, it is harassment but
not rape. Probably the rape is described in some other R.
Rape of Madanama?jar? by R?va?a (source?)
Rape of Ca?cal?k?? by R?va?a (KambaR)
Rape of Ar?, daughter of ?ukra, by Da??a (VR UK)
Rape of Ugrasena's wife by the *Gandharva* Dramila (SB, 10th Canto)
Attempt to rape Vinayavat? by Ra?gam?l? (Kath?sarits?gara)
Attempt to rape Pramati by Nala, friend of Sudeva (M?rka??eya Pur??a)
