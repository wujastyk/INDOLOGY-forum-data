Hi Deven,

There is also a reference in the extant Artha??stra (from the Kyoto edition)

KAZ02.11.107/ maagadhikaa pauNDrikaa sauvarNa.kuDyakaa ca pattra.uurNaa //
KAZ02.11.108/ naaga.vRkSo likuco bakulo vaTaz ca yonayaH //
KAZ02.11.109/ piitikaa naaga.vRkSikaa //
KAZ02.11.110/ go.dhuuma.varNaa laikucii //
KAZ02.11.111/ zvetaa baakulii //
KAZ02.11.112/ zeSaa nava.niita.varNaa //
KAZ02.11.113/ taasaaM sauvarNa.kuDyakaa zreSThaa //
KAZ02.11.114/ tayaa kauzeyaM ciina.paTTaaz ca ciina.bhuumijaa vyaakhyaataaH //

I?m inclined to agree with Witzel (2006: 488), however, that this reference has likely been added later.

Best,
Mark

Dear list members,

A Sinologist colleague of mine has raised the following question to me.  Any thoughts would be appreciated:

Conventional wisdom among certain Sinologists is that the Western name "China" derives from the Sanskrit Mah?c?na, etc.  Sinologists do not seem to know, or at least do not cite, sources for this attribution.  How old is the name, and how trustworthy are the texts?

Thank you,

Deven
