If Vij??ne?vara uses ?dityaskandaga?apat?n?m, he must have seen a source for skanda in the verse and he must have seen the source between ?ditya and ga?apati. Either he was undecided about the reading and tried to accommodate both the readings you discuss or he thought of sv?min as standing, by itself,  for skanda.
