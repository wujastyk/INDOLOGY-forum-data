Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indian Furniture
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFafuUG=AjAvamdcS1zzZ7_C+CR4PTOBBv9wdbbDv7t0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I'm looking for illustrations and plans of Indian Furniture.  Are there any
books on Indian Furniture (either of a particular place and time) or a
historical overview.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
