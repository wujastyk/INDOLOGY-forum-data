  I saw this piece of sculpture  curved out  on the outer  circumbualatory wall of the Amaravati Stupa , in Andhra Prdesh ,( 45 km from Vijaywada) India  when I visited it in 2014. 

   

            I would like to know whether the incident  refers to the event of MahaNishkraamana in the life of Siddhartha Gautam Buddha when he decided to renounce this mundane world , with his kins and near ones wailing to desist him from doing so, or is it somethimg else ?

                                                        

                                                                    ALAKENDU DAS
