Subject: [INDOLOGY] Promoting Sanskrit in India
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzeF64xUw3hzEn8ctLYoAKKk_xttb4nHyGEnw3oMZWHa1A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

     Please find attached a report submitted by a committee to the
Government of India regarding the future teaching of Sanskrit.  [Thanks to
Shrinivasa Varakhedi on the BVP list.] This is an important document
indicating the likely direction of the teaching of Sanskrit in Indian
schools and colleges.  When I was a student in Pune schools during
1950s/60s, students in the Highschools were expected to study and pass
examinations in four languages, namely Marathi, Hindi, English and
Sanskrit.  However, after that the Govt of India decided to promote a
so-called three language formula which made Sanskrit an optional subject in
most non-Hindi speaking states.  In the Hindi-speaking states, there was
place for Sanskrit within the three language formula.  This change in
policy drastically reduced the number of schools offering Sanskrit in
states like Maharashtra.  It remains to be seen how this new report
submitted to the Govt of India will alter the teaching of Sanskrit.
