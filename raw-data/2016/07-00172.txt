Serious or not is for the reader to decide, but I wrote a detailed review
of TBFS which can be read under
https://www.academia.edu/25071774/The_Battle_for_Sanskrit_Review

I have heard that the Hindi journal Pratim?na, published by CSDS, plans to
publish four reviews of TBFS in Hindi. Past editions of Pratim?na can be
seen under https://csds.academia.edu/PratimanCSDS
