Dear Madhav,

Thank you for the Panini reference.

Eggeling must have been influenced by the context. As you suggest, the only way amsala 
could fit the context would be through a shift in meaning in the direction of "strengthening, 
nourishing, plump, juicy..." -- certainly not "tough".

With best wishes,

Dermot

Hello Dermot and Herman,

At least in Paini's understanding, the words vatsa+la and asa+la are derived respectively 
in the sense of kama "love" and bala "strength," sutra: vatsasabhya kamabale (P. 5.2.98). 
Thus, for Paini, these words mean "loving, affectionate" and "strong," respectively. That 
meaning for asala would not fit the ?Satapatha passage: a?snamy evaham asala ced 
bhavati, suggesting that the word had some other meaning making the meat more 
edible/desirable, and hence "tender" is a likely contextual meaning. May be "plump, juicy".

    Dermot, 
    I worked on this 30 years ago, and I remember asking the exact same question. If 
    memory serves correctly (and it may be
    unreliablehere), I believe Sayana's commentary 
    ishelpful here 
     in getting to Eggeling's definition. 
     (I'm away from my library right now, and I cannot check 
    .)

    Can someone help with a bit of brAhmaNa interpretation?
    
    Monier-Williams and Mayrhofer both say aMsala means "strong", connecting it 
    with aMsa
    "shoulder". Mayrhofer adds that it's used mainly with reference to cattle and 
    meat.
    
    In xatapatha brAhmaNa 3.1.2.21 Eggeling translates it "tender".
    
    The context is a prohibition on eating beef -- apparently not for everyone at all 
    times, but for
    someone undertaking dIkSA. After an arthavAda justifying the prohibition, 
    YAjnavalkya is
    quoted as saying "axnAmy evAham aMsalaM ced bhavati."
    
    Eggeling: "I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender."
    
    Is there any evidence for a meaning "tender", or is Eggeling taking a liberty to 
    give
    YAjnavalkya a good punch line?
    
    I realise that ancient Indian diet can be a sensitive issue, but the question here 
    seems to be
    about YAjnavalkya's culinary preference.
    
    I'd be grateful for any clarification.
