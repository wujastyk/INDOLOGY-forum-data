In an unfortunate twist, my PDF of the article is apparently corrupted.  I will look for the paper copy in my files, but until then if anyone happens to have a PDF easily available, that would be much appreciated.

My best,

Hello Dermot and Herman,

At least in P??ini's understanding, the words vatsa+la and a?sa+la are derived respectively in the sense of k?ma "love" and bala "strength," s?tra: vats??s?bhy?? k?mabale (P. 5.2.98).  Thus, for P??ini, these words mean "loving, affectionate" and "strong," respectively.  That meaning for a?sala would not fit the ?atapatha passage: a?n?my ev?ham a?sala? ced bhavati, suggesting that the word had some other meaning making the meat more edible/desirable, and hence "tender" is a likely contextual meaning.  May be "plump, juicy".

Dermot,

I worked on this 30 years ago,? and I remember asking the exact same question. If memory serves correctly (and it may be

Can someone help with a bit of brAhmaNa interpretation?

Monier-Williams and Mayrhofer both say aMsala means "strong", connecting it with aMsa
"shoulder". Mayrhofer adds that it's used mainly with reference to cattle and meat.

In xatapatha brAhmaNa 3.1.2.21 Eggeling translates it "tender".

The context is a prohibition on eating beef -- apparently not for everyone at all times, but for
someone undertaking dIkSA. After an arthavAda justifying the prohibition, YAjnavalkya is
quoted as saying "axnAmy evAham aMsalaM ced bhavati."

Eggeling: "I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender."

Is there any evidence for a meaning "tender", or is Eggeling taking a liberty to give
YAjnavalkya a good punch line?

I realise that ancient Indian diet can be a sensitive issue, but the question here seems to be
about YAjnavalkya's culinary preference.

I'd be grateful for any clarification.

Dermot
