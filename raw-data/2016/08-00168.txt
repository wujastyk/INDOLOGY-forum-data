Greetings,

	The Bh?gavatam 10.13.64 states that catur-mukha Brahm? ?praised [K???a] with words of praise.? The Sanskrit here is ?ailata ?lay?.?

	Under ?l or ?l?, MW refers us to ??. Although MW does not give ?l? or any verb forms of ?l as a form of ?? (there is another ?l given in the causative, ?layati, ?to move?), it seems safe to take both ailata and ?lay? as derived from ?l as an alternate form of ??. Similarly ?r?dhara Sv?m? in his commentary glosses the words as follows: ?lay? v?c?, ailata astaut.

	Question: how common in Sanskrit literature are derivates of ?l as a form of ??.

	Thanks,

Howard
