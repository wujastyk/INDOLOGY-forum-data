Patrick, I can say that Pallava and Cola rulers probably used Tribal people as soldiers as testified by some sculptural reliefs of "victorious Durga", where two worshippers at her sides are represented with somatic traits of Tribals---and self-cutting their heads or flesh from their thigh. I think your question is interesting.

Oggetto: [INDOLOGY] warriors v soldiers

Dear Friends, 


Please forgive the possibly naive nature of this question, but was it the case that all warriors were considered to be of the same k?atriya class? Or, was it possible that the 'officers' were k?atriyas and the 'foot soldiers' were perhaps of a different caste, i.e. enslaved ?udras forced to fight? Is there any discussion of the militiary organisation according to ranks, size  and hierarchy similar to the table below? 


Thanks in advance. 





All the best,
