Dear List,

Recently I received automatic updates from Microsoft and as a result lost all my key strokes for Gandhari Unicode fonts recorded in Normal.dot. It tried to reinstall a back-up of Normal.dot, but it failed.  My word programme is Word professional plus 7.
Does anyone know how I can restore the key strokes for Gandhari Unicode?
Many thanks for any help you can offer.
Best,
Ken
