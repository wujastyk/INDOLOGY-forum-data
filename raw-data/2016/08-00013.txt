Oops! I forgot to "reply all" the message forwarded below and see now that
Alessandro Battistini has a good proposition for solving the question of
-khacare (which I took for two words).
So the date would be 2 (ayana) 5 (?ara) 9 (khacara), i.e 952 Nepalese era =
1831/32 CE.

Dear Justin,

(a)ya?a?arakhacare is a chronogram or bh?tasamkhy?, that is the date in the
Nepalese era is expressed here by words.

See Richard Salomon, 1998, Indian Epigraphy, p. 173:
"The date of an era may be given in numerical figures, words, or both. In
verse
inscriptions, especially from later centuries, it was a common practice to
give the
date in the form of a chronogram (bh?tasamkhy?), with the digits expressed
by words
for items associated with particular numbers. The suggested numbers are to
be read
in reverse order (according to the principle a?k?n?? v?mato gati?,
"numerals run
leftward") with an understood place value notation; that is to say, the
first word in
the chronogram gives the units digit, the second the tens, and so forth."
But see note 31 in R. Salomon: "Occasionally, however, chronograms are
intended to be read in normal order".
R. Salomon provides references where you can find lists of words used with
numerical significance.

In the present case, I suggest ya?a-?ara-kha-care means 2-5-0-?, i.e. ?052.
ya?a = ayana in sandhi = 2, because the sun has two courses in a year (one
towards north, the other towards south).
?ara = 5, because K?ma has five arrows.
kha = 0, because the word means vacuity.
As for cara, I do not know. But the nepalese era starting in 879 CE, if I
am not wrong, we can surmise that it stands for 1 or 0.

So 0052 of the Nepalese era = 931/32 CE. (I would exclude cara as 0,
because if the date is 52, I would expect just ya?a?are.)
Or 1052 of the Nepalese era = 1931/32 CE.

Now you can check these possible dates against the palaeography of the MS.
And you can check the lists referred to by R. Salomon, looking for cara.
And colleagues may have met cara in other chronograms and might provide
confirmation of the corresponding figure?

With very best wishes.
