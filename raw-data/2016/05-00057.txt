Hello Corinna (and colleagues),
Thank you for posting this query to the list on my behalf. Having studied the early development of OM in Vedic texts and rituals, I am curious to know about the syllable?s further development in epigraphy, manuscripts, and iconography in India and beyond. (Admittedly a broad question!) Apart from one or two articles (for instance Boeles 1947 ?The Migration of the Mystic Syllable O?.? India Antiqua, J.P. Voegel festschrift, pp. 40-56. Leiden: Brill), there seem to be very few publications on these aspects of the syllable?s history, and so the images, citations and other suggestions forwarded by colleagues thus far are very valuable. Please do keep sending along information as it occurs to you.

yours,
Finnian

Dear Corinna,

It?s quite common to see a representation of O? at the top of inscribed stelae from the Khmer-speaking world in the Angkorean period and also on the headdresses of some sculpted figures.
I hope that the image I am attaching will come through; it is a picture of the headdress of a dv?rap?laka in the Bangkok National Museum about which the Museum label says: ?Guardian. Khmer art, Baphuon style, 11th century A.D. Found at Prasat Muang Tum, Prakonchai District, Burirum Province.? The candra and the ?ikh?, suggesting, I suppose, Mantram?rga influence, are both clearly visible.

But perhaps you are primarily looking for examples from the subcontinental mainland ?
