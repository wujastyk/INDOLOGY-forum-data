Subject: [INDOLOGY] How Indian sages viewed violence (and why western	mythology has such different ideas about it)

An eye-opener! Now I?m beginning to understand why some Indologists ?see? ?chaos and the need for controlling" women and certain groups of people as depicted in Old Tamil literature!

Thanks and regards,
