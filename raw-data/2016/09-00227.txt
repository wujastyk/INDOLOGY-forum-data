Hi Jesse,

A slight variant, "janman? j?yate ??dra?," is traced to the Skanda Pur??a,
N?gara-kha??a 239.31 on the website linked below. The author of the website
article includes a screenshot of a published edition with the text
highlighted, but does not give any information about the edition of the
text. Still, I hope it is a helpful lead.

Ted Benke also quotes the passage in his dissertation (p. 267, see link
below), saying that it is "attributed to Manu," citing Radhakrishnan.

some very interesting ethnographic work on the evolution of this order, and
told me about several inter-caste, Vedic ???????s they have recently
established, incorporating sometimes even dalits, women, and adivasis.  I
have a feeling one of you knows the source. Thanks for your time. ??????,J
