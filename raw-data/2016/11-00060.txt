Thanks to all who responded about India?s first female sovereign.  I summarize the responses regarding queens who ruled in India before or contemporary to Razia Sultana:

(counting regents)

1. N?g?nik?, 2nd century BC Satavahana empire
2. Prabh?vat? Gupta in the 4th--5th centuries, V?k??aka dynasty
3. Kulaprabh?vat?, 5th century Cambodia (outside of the Indian subcontinent, but good to know)

(not counting regents)

1. Didd?, 10th?11th centuries Kashmir
2. Rudram? Dev?, 13th Century, K?kat?ya Dynasty

I also appreciate the references to O. von Hinueber?s book<http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/941300389>, which may refer to others.
