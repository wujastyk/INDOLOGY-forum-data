In an old posting on dating the Jyotisa Vedanga
http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2000-March/020863.html
Michael Witzel makes two observations
1) that Ramayana book 1 has linguistic characteristics of Late Epic
and
2)  the difficulties in modernizing sentences in verse.

Quoting from the posting:
-----------------------------
.........

As I have noticed some years ago (unpublished), this is precisely a feature
of LATE Epic. In both texts, Mbh. and Ram., [vedic vai occurs not as
usual in slot 2 of a sentence but at the end of a paada] c. 13% of all
cases of vai
have this characteristic: they occur at the end. And are most common in
Mahabharata 12, Ramayana 1 and 7.

........

2. We can add: The text is composed in Epic Shloka meter which is not
exactly a Vedic one (though we have the Vedic  Anustubh). Now, its is a
well known fact that you cannot change arround or modernize sentences as
easily in verse as you can in prose. Note the famous case (Lueders) of the
old, eastern forms in stanzas of the Pali canon.
