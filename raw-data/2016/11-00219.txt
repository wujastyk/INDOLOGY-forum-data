Dear Peter,

Thank you for the intriguing reference about the Ratn?kara Pur??a. But the
papers on Archive seem not to associate this Pandit Ratn?kara with the
author of the Haravijaya. Is it just a mere assumption based on the title
of the chronicle? Could you point me to any other consistent sources, if
they exist?
Best
