Subject: [INDOLOGY] by chance, accidentally
Message-ID: <CALNcvFtv8rsRkqNnbFGKiRLMZCW2i98uMdpdVzkEmNxujHwnQw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues.

one more question.

Do you know of something, some event, that happened accidentally, by pure
chance - but, finally, had the power to  influence the development of the
Indian Civilization (in the spheres of thought, religion, social relations,
etc.)?

Status of "(pure, sheer) chance" in Indian thought?
