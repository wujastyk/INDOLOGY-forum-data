Hello All,

We are invited by a well known publisher to develop a volume of scholarly
articles on religions of India. Articles may address any subject related to
religions of India, either through text analysis or popular religious
practice utilizing social sciences or humanities approaches. The book is
scheduled for publication by August 2017. If you are interested in
contributing a paper please send your abstract to the following email:
lavanyavemsani at gmail.com

Please also contact me off the list at this email address for further
details.

Thank you

Lavanya
