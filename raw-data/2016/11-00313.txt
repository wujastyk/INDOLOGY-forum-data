Dear Patrick, Bradley and others,

the question of the origin of the Yamas and Niyamas is indeed a
fascinating one, and I would also be very much interested to hear more
from somebody more knowledgeable about the scriptural evidence of the
five great vows of the Jainas. What I have managed to find so far is
the fourth chapter of the Da?avaik?lika S?tra (Dasave?liya Sutta(?)),
in whose s?tras 11-15 we get five great vows, corresponding to the
yamas in order, but not yet using the familiar terms: 1) pr???tip?t?d
virama?am (=ahi?s?), 2) m???v?d?d virama?am (=satya), 3) adattad?n?d
virama?am (=asteya), 4) maithun?d virama?am (=brahmacarya) and 5)
parigrah?d virama?am (=aparigraha). I am taking these terms from the
sanskrit ch?ya of K.C. Lalwani (1973) who in his foreword dates it to
"around B.C. 429". In the Pra?navy?kara?as?tra (I have access to it
via the 1962 Shri Akhil Bharat S. S. Jain Shastroddhara Samiti edition
from Rajkot, the following passage a quote from the sanskrit ch?ya on
p. 552.) we have "prathama? bhavaty ahi?s?, dvit?ya? satyavacanam iti
praj?aptam | datt?nuj??tasa?vara? ca, brahmacary?(ed. has
'a')parigrahatva? ca || 2 ||" So here we almost arrive at the terms
used by Pata?jali in Yogas?tra 2.30.

Best,

Peter

I guess ahi?s? could be indirectly translated as 'compassion' for others by being 'non-violent', however, 'service' as in 'seva' does not find any mention in the PYS list, which is what my respondent was referring to.

As many practitioners of modern yoga assume this list has 'stood the test of time' and is as an a priori concept, this has made me think about the historicity and development of the yamas and niyamas as singular ideas, and as a conjoined pair.

(I'm thinking in a similar way to the development of the ?adcakratantra, and how there were other texts that discussed alternate numbers/locations, etc)

I looked through the search option of the list but couldn't really find any discussion that pertained specifically to my request. Although the discussions on whether some texts place a concept in the yama as opposed to the niyama category are quite interesting.
