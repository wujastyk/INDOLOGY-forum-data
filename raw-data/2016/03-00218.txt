Thank you for this valuable reference, Dominik.

I have a question in regard to Bill Mak's post to this thread: what on earth is Sanskrit doing
in Sikkim? The native Lepcha population never used Sanskrit, and the Tibetans who became the
dominant class only used it in Tibetan ornamental contexts, as transmitted in Tibetan education.
The now predominant Nepali population was mostly drawn from the Hill Tribes, who, though
nominally Hindu, were not at all involved in Sanskritic culture (except indirectly, for instance when they visited
temples such as Pasupatinath when on pilgrimage and received the services of Brahmans there).

So what accounts for the development of Sanskrit colleges in Sikkim? Who is served by them?

best,
Matthew
