Sokal?s paper does not have any matrix algebra. Perhaps it is influenced by ?The Language of the Gods in the World of Men?, which has a section titled ?The Geocultural Matrix of Sanskrit Knowledge? and in which superposition principle,[1] matrix norms,[2] and equality of matrices[3] are discussed. :-))
