It was considered a serious matter.  On the other hand the press never mentioned it's going beyond words, unlike the present.  One sometime read of the girls' brothers getting their friends together to physically chastise the offenders.

It doesn't sound like this is true any more.  Or was he deceived at the time, the 50s or 60s?

The answer is in part found here <http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16503338>: "Eve teasing" is used in India to refer to a wide variety of behaviour including molestation, "flashing" or any verbal/physical sexual street harassment that falls short of rape.

And that it is because it is perceived as a cultural import from Abrahamic religions <http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-vhp-defends-attack-on-haryana-church-says-rape-of-nuns-is-christian-culture-2069494> that have 'dominated' and 'enslaved' the region for several centuries. Ultimately, this anti-social behaviour is perceived as a result of 'Western values' and not a local practice. It is considered a colonial byproduct. This helps create a moral panic to stimulate an anti-western agenda. A return to 'core/true' Indian values is considered the answer to this problem. At least in the eyes of the Sangh Parivar.

Bhagwat further qualified his essentialised remark stating that the 'pure village' is devoid of assaults but the sullied (i.e. Westernised) urban centres <http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/rapes-occur-in-urban-india-not-rural-bharat-says-bhagwat--bjp-defends-him/1054615/> are where assaults occur.

> If I may again, I agree with Prof. Slaje on the danger of anachronism and the need to go back to the Sanskrit words. The word kany?-d??a?a does not occur in KSS XII, 2, 105 cd but the Sanskrit is crystal-clear: it is a case of abuse as the girl is not willing and as the vidy?dhara has undertaken to abduct her by force.

>> 
>> Before rashly jumping to a discussion of ?rape? by tacitly presupposing a 21st century Western understanding of its concept and performance also for ancient India, a clarification is required of the concept(s) of ?rape? prevailing in premodern Indian thought. What unambiguous words and matching notions have so far been recorded that would correspond to "rape" in accordance with modern Western standards? What normative boundaries of, e.g., ?legal? types of marriage such as r?k?asa and pi??ca ? clear cases of ?rape? in Western terms I suppose ? needed to be transgressed that facts of rape would have been considered as fulfilled in premodern India? Was kany?-d??a?a the same as ?rape? in our understanding, or simply the spoiling of a virgin so that she could no longer be married off and became a serious damage to her parents?
>> 
>> In what way can the absolute power a husband would have exercised over his wife (or wives) be categorised in contexts of "rape"?
>> 
>> Is there any connecting factor of the past that could be related to the extraordinarily high number of filed gang rape cases in present-day India as continuously reported by the Indian media? In this latter regard, a good starting point could perhaps be Gyula Wojtilla's "Women at Work and Their Enemies. A Reappraisal of the K?mas?tra V, 5, 5 ? 10" (I lack the bibliographic citation of his paper at the moment).
>> 
>> 
>> 
>> In a more general sense, B?U (M) VI 4,7 could also be revealing, if just ati-?kram is not understood in line with ?a?kara?s unconvincing attempts at downplaying the matter, but in accordance with Iva Fiser's ?overcome her forcibly? (Indian Erotics of the Oldest Period, Praha 1966: 116, a book not without its merits).
