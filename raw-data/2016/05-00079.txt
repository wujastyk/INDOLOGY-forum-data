Subject: [INDOLOGY] the water fowl illusion
Message-ID: <CAKA8X431avAZmcirsemygDqxOahkaeOiQvEWyhYjihKc4tgEYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I came across a reference today in Buston's commentary on the Vimalaprabh?
of the K?lacakratantra to the
chu skyar gyi sgru ma
or
kalaha?sa-m?y?

The referent to a water-fowl/gander/duck/swan/drake-illusion is not
familiar to me.

Mght someone know what this particular illusion is, and have some
references?

Cheers
James
