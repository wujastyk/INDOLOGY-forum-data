Subject: [INDOLOGY] Double sandhi

It's not exactly "double sandhi" in the sense of re-applying sandhi to 
the same sequence twice, but there are also bracketing paradoxes in 
sandhi triplets which might be relevant to this issue. I'm referring to 
the situation when one must deal with three underlying vowels in a row 
(V1+V2+V3). Apparently, it's normal to combine the first two vowels 
first (V1+V2 -> V') and then add in the third vowel (V'+V3 -> V"). 
Interestingly, this order of operations occurs even when V2+V3 is 
clearly the tighter constituent on all other grounds (syntax and sense), 
and should by all other rights be combined first. For example, this 
situation is found with ?? ihi = ?hi "come hither" several times in the 
RV, starting with 1.9.1:

a. ?ndr?hi ... (from /?ndra ?? ihi/, instead of *?ndr?ihi)

Lanman (1877, "A statistical account of noun-inflection in the Veda") 
speaks of one such case across p?das:

"The combination is interesting as showing how entirely preposterous and 
artificial is the sandhi hetween two p?das." Viz.

9.97.38ab
Restored:
a. s? pun?n? ?pa s??re n? dh??t?
b. ?bh? apr? r?das? v? ?? ?va?

Padap??ha:
sa? | pun?na? | upa | s?re | na | dh?t? | ? | ubhe iti | apr?? | rodas? 
iti | vi | sa? | ?var ity ?va?

Aufrecht:
s? pun?n? ?pa s??re n? dh??t?bh? apr? r?das? v? ?? ?va?
