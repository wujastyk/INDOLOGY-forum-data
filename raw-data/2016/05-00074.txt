 Thanks to all who have elaborated on my query. I believe Mr.Richard Gombrich has made a very realistic assesment on the matter concerning Dhrama in Buddhism. Only yesterday I was going through a qoute from the Anguttara Nikaya ( of Sutta Pitaka) where  Siddhartaha Gautam Buddha says- 'This is the road leading to Cessation of sorrow.' May be this what is implied by Dharma.  Sorrow is what the world is all about , and it's cessation is the way we should live.
