Thanks for scrutinizing, Dominik :) It only adds to my own suspicions 
(which are shared by British art historian Andrew Topsfield who has done 
the most work on gy?n caupa? in the past).

Also thanks to Patrick Kr?ger for pointing out the use of ?rdhvatilaka 
in Jain painting, and to Paul Dundas for pointing out the relationship 
between Nemin?tha and K???a.

Regards,
Jacob
