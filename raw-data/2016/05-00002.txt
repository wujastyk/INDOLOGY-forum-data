Unlike Monier-Williams, who has plundered the wealth of Boehtlingk?s (&
Roth?s) PW without proper acknowledgment of the materials on which he had
based his structural rearrangement in the English language, the latter *do
acknowledge all* of their sources and frequently quote them verbatim *in
extenso* ? whence it is called ?Gro?es (big) PW? [1853?75]: more quotes,
less entries compared to ?Kleines (little) pw? [1879?89]: little or no
verbatim quotes, but considerably more entries.


Using pw along with Richard Schmidt?s Supplement (?Nachtr?ge?) [1928] and
Apte's Dictionary (which is truly independent) will yield a maximum of
reliable results.



In the present case the sources of PW/pw were classical Sanskrit
lexicographers, in one case the comparatively late ?abdakalpadruma.



> Are all or some of these 7 words in  Sabdakalpadruma and the Vacaspatyam?

The question can best be answered by consulting PW directly (sources
highlighted in red colour):



k?audraja ? (k?audra *Honig* + ja)  n.  *Wachs*  R??an. im ?kdr. (PW)

k?audraj? ? f. Honigzucker R?jan. 14,133. (pw)

nihi?sana ? (von hi?s mit ni)  n.  *das Morden*  Ak. 2, 8, 2, 81. (PW [+pw])

n?tigho?a ? (n?? + gho?a)  m.  N. des Wagens des B?haspati  Trik. 2, 8, 48.
(PW [+pw])

n?cabhojya ? (n?ca + bho?)  m.  *Zwiebel (die Nahrung gemeiner Leute*)
?abda?. im ?kdr. (PW [+pw])



> roha?adruma were in MW but not PW or pw

This is wrong, for it is indeed recorded in PW/pw:

roha?adruma ? m.  *Sandelbaum*  H. 641. Hal?j. 2, 389. (PW [+pw])


> a?sem?la

This again is inaccurate, first, because the correct entry in MW is
a?sam?la (not a?sam?le), and second, because pw has registered it as a
matter of fact (n. Schulterh?he R?jan.)



I suggest to study first of all the introductions to the works of
Boehtlingk & Roth to form oneself an idea of what exact methods in Sanskrit
lexicography they had employed and who actually had contributed to their
Herculean task.
