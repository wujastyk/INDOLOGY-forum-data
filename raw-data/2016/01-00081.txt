Quite interesting! I wonder if the discussants knew the origin of the word ?curry (???),? and that it is Tamil. Thereupon they may change their direction!

In any case ?

I?ve always wondered about the similarities between the generous use of turmeric in Punjabi & Tamil cuisines. Also, Taro roots which are also referred to as ?arbi? and ?c?ppa?ki?a?ku (??????????????/??????)? are common in both cuisines.

Thanks and regards,
rajam
