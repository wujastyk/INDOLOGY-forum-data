Dear Friends, 

I was going thru my book shelf and stumbled across this loose bit of paper. On it is an 'interesting' mathematical formula  pertaining to the value of 'om'. 

 I think my old yoga teacher gave me this page many years ago. 

I am no mathematician but I would be curious to know from the more mathematically inclined folk amongst us what you think of it. 

On the opp side of the page there is a reference scribbled which might be linked.
