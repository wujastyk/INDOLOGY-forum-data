Thanks for the information! This is very interesting for me since I?m currently trying to understand the earliest available attestations of coding and decoding ancient Tamil numerals and counting system.

However, I?m not able to decipher the attached image ? how 100 and 6 are represented? Is there a chart which specifies equating individual signs, symbols, and numerals?

Thanks and regards,
rajam

I'd be grateful for reference to (and images of) other specimens of 600, especially such as might less clearly be built on the signs 100 and 6. Specimens of signs for 1000 are also welcome.
