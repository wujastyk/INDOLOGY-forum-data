Dear list members:

A g?yatr? mantra mantra to V?yu is:

sarvapr???ya vidmahe
ya??ihast?ya dh?mahi
tan no v?yu? pracoday?t

I've seen a translation of ya??ihast?ya as "holding the mace" but are
statues or pictoral representations of V?yu, and if so  with a mace?

but Monier-Williams also  has a meaning of ya??i as "sacrificing" which he
says comes from a commentator on Panini 3-3-110 .

 By any chance could someone point out the commentator and point me to the
passage MW refers to.

Also based on that definition of ya??i does a translation of ya??ihast?ya
as "to the one who sacrifices with his hands" make sense. refering to the
wind fanning the flames of the sacrifice.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
