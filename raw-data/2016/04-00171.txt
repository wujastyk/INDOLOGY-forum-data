Thanks to Prof. Wujastyk, Mr. (Dr.?) Reigle, and Mr. Powell for the
responses. I have got in touch with Kaivalyadhama and will be getting the
books soon.

The English translation of Srinivasa Iyangar has comments, but it not a
complete or exact translation of the Jyotsn?. For example, the comments on
the first verse do not discuss the lack of *ya? *in the usage
*?r??din?th?ya*, which the Jyotsn? does.
