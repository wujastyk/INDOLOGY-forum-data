Hello Kevin,

     Of the instances of "?r" that you have collected from GRETIL, the
?gvedic instance of aju?ran is the only one that appears to be a genuine
instance, while the other occurrences appear to be orthographic variants
for an original "?r,"  rather than being genuine occurrences of "?r".  In
any case, it is good to know that there is at least one genuine occurrence
of "?r" in the form aju?ran.
