Dear Madhav-mahodaya, As I have already told you off list, I find these
poems really beautiful and extraordinary. I especially loved
'gallIbh??a?a...', but also found these ones about running into your old
playmate really delightful. The poems appeal to me so much because of their
simplicity, unabashed modernity, and playful wit. They definitely merit
publication as a collection and it will really be a gift to modern Sanskrit
literature. ??????,J
