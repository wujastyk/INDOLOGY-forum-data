Greetings from *Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth*: *University for Sanskrit &
Indic Traditions!*

There is a growing aspiration and demand among the Indian society to
seriously explore the possibility of ?*mainstreaming*? Sanskrit education
in the country. Increasingly, many feel strongly that the knowledge
contained in the Ancient Indian Wisdom could be of great value to address
several of the modern day issues that societies, governments and businesses
face world over. To respond to these growing aspirations, Chinmaya Mission
has started this University. It is my pleasure and privilege, as the Vice
Chancellor of this University, to write to you to bring this to your
attention.

It is my personal vision to create a World Class university with enabling
systems and infrastructure, where faculty drawn from both the modern
streams of knowledge and Sanskrit & Ancient Indian wisdom will jointly
teach new programs and conduct research to address these requirements.
Students who graduate from the University will be able to work in several
sectors of the economy, armed with a sound understanding and application
potential of Ancient Indian Wisdom in their work places. For more details,
I urge you to visit our website at www.chinmayauniversity.ac.in.

We are in the process of *hiring faculty for the University* and the
details are available in the web site. The call for applications for
faculty recruitment is accessible through this link
<http://www.chinmayauniversity.ac.in/recruitment/>. I request you to
provide wide publicity to this among your faculty colleagues and the
research scholars working with them. I also request you to encourage
promising and eligible candidates to apply.

We are hopeful of creating new paradigms in teaching Sanskrit & Ancient
Indian Wisdom with an emphasis on contemporary applications. This I hope
will truly pave the way for India becoming ?*Vishwa Guru*? once again. The
support of existing institutions of higher learning of repute, such as
yours, is very crucial for this to happen.

Thank you for your support.


Yours sincerely,


B Mahadevan
Vice Chancellor
