Martin, not exactly. This was precisely my point. Dikshit did refer to horoscopy under Vedic astrology. See ?J?taka branch of astrology? under ?Atharva jyoti?a? in the section Veda?ga (Vol.1 p.97-98). Things might have come to the forefront in recent time, but such ideas have certainly been around.

I may be wrong, of course, but I have never seen any publication by an Indian practitioner prior to the 1990s referring to his (or, occasionally, her) art using that phrase, whereas today it is rampant.
