I am referring here only the textual reference of the symbolism of the phrase of crossing ocean which is recorded in Nirukta (2.10): samudra (sam+ud+dru: waters flow up) or (sam+abhi+dru waters flow towards it) is understood as the passage between earth and heaven. One may find the detail explanation of the same under Nirukta 2.10.?

Why is half the religious literature of early India concerned with "crossing the ocean of sa?s?ra," when crossing a real ocean was forbidden for twice-born members of society?? Why that?metaphor in particular? ?
Crossing fords, rivers, etc., makes metaphorical sense, and was allowed.? But oceans?
