Hi Dagmar:

Two persons to consult would be Osmond Bopeaarachchi and Sanjyot Mehendale. They were responsible for the underwater excavation of perhaps the oldest known shipwreck in the Indian ocean off Hambantota in Sri Lanka (c. 1st c. BCE, I think). And there were glassware and large glass ingot (I saw one of them in the museum in Colombo). The ship was probably going from Sri Lanka to Andhra.

Dear all,

Can anyone point me to publications on the making and use of glassware in ancient India? I am particularly interested in bottles (k?p?), as these appear relatively late in medical literature in the context of alchemical procedures.

Many thanks!

Dagmar
