Dear members of the list, 

in some articles (S. Pollock?s 2015? contribution to the ?World Philology? volume, or N.V.P. Unithiri's 2002? article ?The Commentarial Literature in Sanskrit?) I read that the commentarial styles of da??a- and kha???nvaya- stem from (the linguistic theories? textual history? of) ny?ya- and m?m??s? respectively. As far as at least the the linguistic theories go (I talk of their ??bdabodha-aspect now), I don?t see any compulsive reason for this strict differentiation.
I wonder if anyone could help me out with any further reference or, perhaps, a missing piece of common knowledge that would explain or corroborate the above statement. 

Thank you very much in advance, 

best, 
Andrey
