Dear Johannes, dear list members,

I am forwarding the following message on behalf of prof. Torella.
???

Dear Johannes,

I can confirm what Marco said on the ground of my own experience with Malayalam mss. at Kariyavattom. The 'cryptographic code' is basically analogous to the prast?ra, i.e. the arrangement of the phonemes that  the single school may use to instruct their own adepts on how to form the various mantras (mantroddh?ra). This practice is however far from being frequent.

Best regards
Raffaele

On this, see Renou/Filliozat, L?Inde classique, p. 708.
