Dear Friends,

I find myself intrigued by the idea that there are people today compelled to carry on the karmak???a rituals.

I read a brief passage that alludes to the m?m??s? thought-world as providing textual evidence and injunctions for this practice of reenacting scriptural commandments, which were originally meant for a group of people in a different time and place. However, it only mentions m?m??s? and does not mention any specific author or text.

I would like to read this text but, as I know very little about m?m??s? I do not really know where to start. I thought I might find some help here in locating the passages I seek.

Thank you for your help.


All the best,
