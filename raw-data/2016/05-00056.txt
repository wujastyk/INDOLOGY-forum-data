Dear Corinna,

It?s quite common to see a representation of O? at the top of inscribed stelae from the Khmer-speaking world in the Angkorean period and also on the headdresses of some sculpted figures.
I hope that the image I am attaching will come through; it is a picture of the headdress of a dv?rap?laka in the Bangkok National Museum about which the Museum label says: ?Guardian. Khmer art, Baphuon style, 11th century A.D. Found at Prasat Muang Tum, Prakonchai District, Burirum Province.? The candra and the ?ikh?, suggesting, I suppose, Mantram?rga influence, are both clearly visible.

But perhaps you are primarily looking for examples from the subcontinental mainland ?

Dominic
