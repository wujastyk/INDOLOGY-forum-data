Dear Patrick ,

When I was a grad student in Joseph O'Connell's class on Bhakti in the 
90s, he started the class with a review of some portions of the Mantra 
section of the Vedas, as a backdrop to later developments in Tamil 
(??v?rs etc.,) and further developments in Bhakti Vedanta---including 
Gaudiya Vaishnavism.

A theme he emphasized is that the idea of bhakti, or binding oneself to 
a deity, is pretty old in the Vedic tradition as the Mantras often 
express sentiments of loyalty and fidelity to the deity that is invoked.

What serves to bring the continuity of this theme to the fore is to 
follow the development of Yoga, which is pretty much the same as Bhakti, 
as a philosophical movement.

The early mention of yoga of course is in the /Ka?ha //Upani?ad/ where 
Yama describes success in Yoga as taking one to Vi??u?s realm. Later, 
this idea of approximating the Lord becomes central to Yoga in 
Pata?jali?s /Yoga S?tra/as /??vara/ pra?idh?na. Ramanuja carries on this 
theme by identifying bhakti as a kind of /j??na/ but further a kind of 
/up?sana/, which evokes images of meditation but also offerings to 
sacrificial fires. This serves to highlight a continuity of a theme 
stretching back to the early Vedas of the approximation of a deity via 
Vedic themes of sacrifice.

What shifts from the early to the later period is that in the early 
/mantra/ period worshiping a deity was motivated by desire for 
outcomes?a practice that is consequentialist as consequentialism is the 
view that right procedure is justified by a good outcome. What happens 
by the time of the /Upani?ad/s is that consequentialism starts to be 
viewed with suspicion because, as Yama himself describes in the /Ka?ha 
Upani?ad/, those who are geared towards outcomes do not take control of 
their life and this results in ruin. So what we see happening is a 
switch to a radical procedural ethics, that treats practice as defined 
by a regulative ideal, the Lord, and the worship or approximation of 
this ideal as resulting in the good. It is superficially like 
consequentialism but it is contrary. This radical proceeduralism is 
Yoga, or Bhakti. The main difference is that Yoga or Bhakti is a causal 
story of how the right brings about the good and is the opposite of 
Virtue Ethics that claims that the good character brings about the right 
action. Bhakti/Yoga rather claims that the right practice is defined by 
the ideal of the right (the Lord) and perfecting this practice is the 
good. Consequentialism in contrast is an account not of moral causation 
but justification.

So while the ideas that the bhakti tradition rely upon are ancient, and 
not implausibly described as Vedic, it is true that there is a radical 
shift that characterizes the latter part of the Vedic tradition starting 
with the /Upani?ad/s. We see this transition from consequentialism to a 
radical proceeduralism of bhakti as a theme of the /G?t?/ , for 
instance. I think it also explains why Brahman as development comes to 
occupy a central place in later Vedic thought.

If you are interested in this, I?ve written a bit about it:

Ranganathan, S. (forthcoming) 2017. /Vedas and Upani//?ads/. In /Volume 
1: The History of Evil in Antiquity (2000BCE-450CE)./ Edited by Tom 
Angier. Of /History of Evil /edited by C. Taliaferro and C. Meister. 
London: Routledge.

For a wider survey of this tradition, please see

Ranganathan, Shyam. 2017. 'Three Ved?ntas: Three Accounts of Character, 
Freedom and Responsibility.' In /The Bloomsbury Research Handbook of 
Indian Ethics /edited by Shyam Ranganathan, 249-274. Of /Bloomsbury 
Research Handbooks in Asian Philosophy, /edited by Chakravarthi 
Ram-Prasad and Sor-hoon Tan. London: Bloomsbury Academic.

If you are interested in how Bhakti/Yoga is a different moral theory 
from Consequentialism, Deontology and Virtue Ethics, please see:

Ranganathan, Shyam. 2017. 'Pata?jali?s Yoga: Universal Ethics as the 
Formal Cause of Autonomy.' In /The Bloomsbury Research Handbook of 
Indian Ethics /edited by Shyam Ranganathan, 177-202 Of /Bloomsbury

The latter two should be out in a couple of weeks.

Best wishes,
