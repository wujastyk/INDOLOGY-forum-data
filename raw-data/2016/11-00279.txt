About the workshop

Several platforms of computational linguistics have been developed for
Sanskrit. There are in-house efforts to use these computational linguistic
tools for semi-automatic annotation of the Sanskrit corpus at various
levels such as annotation of inflectional and derivational morphology,
annotation of ka?raka roles, and linking the stems with various digital
lexica. These tasks are being carried out mostly semi-automatically
involving a human supervision, or with a user interface for appropriate
selection. Several Digital Sanskrit libraries are being developed. However,
there is no present consensus on interoperability between the ones and the
others, such as inter-translatable annotation of corpus. Moreover, for want
of a common platform, there is very little communication among the
researchers involved in the digital libraries and the computational
linguists.

OBJECTIVE

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for the various researchers
involved in such efforts, in view of increasing cooperation in this area.
The workshop would welcome participants both from the computational
linguistics side and from the philology side, as well as traditional
pandits interested in computer usage. This forum would provide a platform
to discuss on the interoperability between the two platforms, such as
inter-translatable annotation of corpus, development of proper user
interfaces etc. facilitating bridging the gap between the two efforts.
