Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF of Taittiriya Aranyaka vol. 3 by Mahadeva Sastri and Rangacharya needed

I've just found out that the DLI has the wrong book under the entry
"volume 3 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka by Mahadeva Sastri and Rangacharya"
 so downloading it from the DLI (which a list member kindly has) wont help.

Thanks,
