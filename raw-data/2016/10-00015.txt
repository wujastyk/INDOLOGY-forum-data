A member asked offline why there is no ?ja?tva? (?t? to ?d? change) by
?jhal?? ja?o?nte? (A. 8.2.39) in sat + ya = satya, unlike in cases like
sat + yukti = sadyukti
sat + yoga = sadyoga

I am copying the answer here too. The reason is that due to ?yaci bham? (A
1.4.18), ?sat? in ?sat + ya? is not a ?pada? but a ?bha?. This is why
?jhal?? ja?o?nte? is not applicable. ?yaci bham? does not apply in
?sadyukti?, ?sadyoga?, etc.
