This is referred to by Y?ska in his Nirukta [1.13, 1.14], where we are told that ??ka??yana derived parts of a word from other words [padebhya? padetar?rdh?n sa?cask?ra ??ka??yana?].  ??ka??yana derives the "ya" of satya from the causative of the root "i" [ete? k?rita? ca yak?r?di? ca antakara?am], while he derives the "sat" of satya from the root "as" [aste? ?uddha? sak?r?di? ca].  It is not entirely clear what meaning ??ka??yana saw in this etymology.  Nirukta [1.14] seems to suggest that there was no meaning connection between these elements thus derived, and it seems to fault ??ka??yana [atho etat padebhya? padetar?rdh?n sa?cask?ra iti / ya? ananvite sa?cask?ra, sa tena garhya?] for proposing an etymology with constituents that do not meaningfully relate to each other.  ??ka??yana probably believed that all constituent elements proposed in an etymology need to be derived from a verb-root.
