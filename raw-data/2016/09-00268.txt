Dear Manu,

You might find something helpful in my article, "What can the lifespans of ??abha, Bharata, ?rey??sa, and Ara tell us about the History of the concept of Mount Meru?," in the International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online), Vol.11, No. 1 (2015) 1-24:

Dear Colleagues,
I am reading for the moment Tamil commentaries to the
_Tirumuruk???uppa?ai_.
One of them reads about the first word of the poem (_ulakam_, "the
world" in bold below):
_ULAKAM ulaki?ka??u??a e? pattu n??ku ila?cam
c?vap?ta?ka??kiya uyirttokutika?._
_"__ULAKAM _(means) the group of living beings which are the 84 lakhs
of classes of living beings which are in the world."
Another comments as follows upon the first two words of the poem
(_ulakam uvappa_, "while/so that the world rejoices" in bold below):
_ULAKA MUVAPPA__ e?patu l?kal?ka?ka?um e?pattu n?lu
le?cam ???um?kka?u? canto[vi]ttaiy a?aintu pi?aikkum
pa?i. _Which I tentatively translate as:
__"The phrase _ULAKA MUVAPPA__ _(means) the manner in which (in) the
worlds (_l?kal?ka?ka?um_) the eighty four lakhs of kinds
(_???u_ < _??u_, litteraly ?way?) of people obtain
salvation after obtaining knowledge (_vittai_ = _vidy?_) of the poem
(_cant?_ < _chandas_, ?sacred hymn; metre?)."
The mention of the 84 lakhs of living beings appears to be just a way
to state, as the other commentaries do, that all living beings
rejoice.
I have found references to this number of 84 lakhs in the
Maitr?ya??ya Upani?ad (see van Buitenen, 1962, p. 102 and 129)
as well as in the R?m?ya?a of Tulsidas, the Caitanyacarit?m?ta
and in a 1499 CE inscription from Gujarat.
Could any one point out to me other sources (P?r??as for instance)
and, especially, sources where the this total of 84 lakhs is detailed?
With a great many thanks in advance.
