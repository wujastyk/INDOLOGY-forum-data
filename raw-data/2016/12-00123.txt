Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about Tamil document
Message-ID: <EA8F815D502BC14097213C5D85BA1C652E07D833@SPMXM07.VUW.leidenuniv.nl>

Dear list members,
A colleague has asked me to translate for her a handwritten early 19th-century Tamil document from Ceylon containing a petition concerning the ownership of two slaves (ci?ai). There is one phrase, occurring no fewer than three times, which I fail to understand. I hope any of you might be able to help me.
The slaves were owned by the two petitioners? grandfather. After the latter?s death they were ?used? (a?upavi-) by his daughter and her brothers. After that things went wrong. Note that the scribe writes e/o for ?/?.
 ?When, while we, your humble servants (a?iy?l?um), were out of town, the slaves (ci?aikal?e) were finishing ?. for the government? (or: " they [the new 'owners'] were finishing ... for the goverment using the slaves they were enjoying the use of") (ci?aikal?e a?iy?l?um ?rile ill?ta vel?eyil kova??amentukka??al?e ci?aic ce?uttu pikk?ci mu?ikki?apotu), they were without our knowledge made to finish ?. for three persons from the temple in Karaveddy? (e?kal? a?iyakko??mal karave??i ? ampalavar [name] perukkum [name] perukkum [name] perukku? ce?uttu pikk?ci mu?ippittuppo???l?) (or: "they caused the slaves to finish"). Due to all this the question of who owns the said slaves has become an issue: ?we or those who now?.? (??ati??l collappa??a ci?aikal?e e?kal?ukku?aiyato allatu ippo ce?uttu pikk?ci mu?ittirukki?avarkal?ukkurimaiy??ato ve??u).
So far, I have been unable to make sense of the verb/absolutive ce?uttu and the word pikk?ci. The analysis of ci?aicce?uttu as ci?aiccu/ci?aittu + e?uttu is precluded by ...perukku? ce?uttu. The verb is ce?uttu. As to pikk?ci, there is a word in Tamil (Telugu) pikku, but what to do with ?ci then?
With kind regards, Herman
