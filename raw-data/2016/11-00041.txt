This is indeed very sad. He was a wonderful teacher, always kind, thoughtful, a wonderful mentor. I remember him holding class at his home for some of us, so that we could examine his extensive collection of books, along with that amazing dictionary desk. I for one will deeply miss his kindness and generosity.
My deep condolences to Rosane.

All best,
Loriliai

I am saddened to learn of Ludo's passing. He was my teacher and my dissertation supervisor. He was a deeply learned and generous scholar and a gentleman of teh odl school. He will be sorely missed by his many friends, colleagues and former students.

I join Madhav and Patrick in their sentiments.  Ludo and I were colleagues from 1965 on and I always found him courteous and cooperative, willing and able to contribute to discussions meaningfully and fairly.  Cordially, George Cardona

Dear Patrick,

     This is a big loss especially to all those who were fortunate to have been students of Ludo Rocher.  He loved my daughters and was like a grand father to them, during Manjushree's visit to Philadelphia.  Shubhangi and I visited him and Rosane at his home in Philadelphia a few years ago, and experienced the continued warmth of his affection.  He was a true Guru to me.  May he rest in peace.  I have attached photo of Ludo and Rosane with his students.

Dear Friends:

I just received the news from Rosane Rocher, that our teacher and friend, Ludo Rocher, passed away last night peacefully. I am sure we will have a more detailed tribute to him, but he was not just a great scholar but a humble and loving teacher and friend.

With best wishes,

Patrick Olivelle
