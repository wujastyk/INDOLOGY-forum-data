Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit verses and logical sentences.
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFP701QP3aFuauzj3vdNOH0dYo9i2YvB5EbvrwoZnoZ1A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I vaguely recall reading somewhere (it might even have been on this list)
that in some tantric works  the logical sentence consists of the last two
padas of a verse and the first two padas of the next verse.

Can any members confirm if this is true or false and if true give an
example.

Many thanks,
Harry Spier
