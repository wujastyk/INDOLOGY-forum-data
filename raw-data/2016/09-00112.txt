Subject: [INDOLOGY] Etymology and meaning of 'Jhana'
In-Reply-To: <20160911121458.8339.qmail@f4mail-235-121.rediffmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAATk=rCMKs60ALMv=S5eZTrmdfiq-_k5pE2mtpLqW3AKPAS4hw@mail.gmail.com>

The *Pr?k?taprak??a* has the rule (8.25)

??h?-dhy?-g?n?? ?h??a-jh??a-g????
(????-????-????? ???-???-????)

which explains Sanskrit dhy? changing to jh??a. Hence

dhy?yanti -> jh?anti
dhy?na -> jh??a

The *Abhidh?nar?jendra?* has a rather long entry under *jh??a*. It also
derives the word from *dhy?na *and cites the rule *s?dhyasadhyahy??
jha?* instead,
which I believe is from Hemacandra's grammar.

Hope this helps, Nityananda
