Prof. Karp,

You must be aware of these words from the Bible. ?You Must Eat My Flesh? I
found a discussion here:
http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/what-jesus-meant-when-he-said-you-must-eat-my-flesh

There are huge number of pages discussing these biblical words.

What struck me is, Jesus the Guru figure asks to eat his flesh and drink
his blood.

There seems to be some esoteric or mystic similarity between the two
expressions.

Regards,

-N
