The ABC Extended keyboard on the Mac is good for all diacritical marks. ?Combining the option key with a gives the macron: ?, ?, etc. ?Option + x =?underdot: ?, ?, etc. ?Option + w = overdot: ?. ?Option + e = accent mark: ?. ?Tilde is of course option + n: ?.

 Maybe indeed I'm missing something but the Asian Extended keyboard (made, if I am not wrong, by Nobumi Iyanaga) works perfectly for diacritics, no mess, no fuss.

David,
? ? ?The old Easy Unicode keyboard-layout does work on my Mac that has the latest operating system and the latest MS Office 360.? Try reinstalling the keyboard file, if you have it.? If not, I can send it to you.? Best,

Yes, This is true, but have you found a convenient way to enter the full range ?of diacritica for Romanized Sanskrit without having to resort to Emoji/Latin/favorites inserts??
This is not the worst thing in the world, but slower than the old Easy Unicode or Dev Unicode keyboards.

I'm shocked.? I don't pay much attention to the Mac world, but I've been typing Devanagari into everything on my computer for many years (Linux).? I had no idea that this wasn't possible or easy on a Mac.? Wow.? And the Mac used to be the byword for multilingual support.? I'm glad it's okay now, at least.

Dear Indologists,
? ? ?To my happy surprise, I found that with the combination of the latest version of Microsoft Office 360 for Mac and the latest Mac Operating System OS X El Capitan, it is now possible to directly enter Unicode Devanagari in a Word document with the Devanagari - QWERTY keyboard layout.? Previously, I had to enter Unicode Devanagari in something like TextEdit and then copy and paste into a Word document, but was not able to edit it in the Word document.? The new development of software has happily changed that situation.? Hope this information will be of use to some of you.? Best,
Madhav Deshpande
