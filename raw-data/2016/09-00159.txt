Dear Patrick,

 *vedam?rti* and *??ntam?rti *kind of metaphors belong to a different
category. They belong to the category of figurative expressions. We have a
huge number of them.

dharmam?rti, gurum?rti are the most frequent.

r?m? vigrahav?n dharmah type statements are similar.

?tman as 'embodied' is found in expressions such as ??r?raka m?m?ms? as the
name for Brhmasutra( Bhashya)

Cpomparable to k??as is sth?la ?ar?ra, s?k?ma ?ar?ra, k?ra?a (linga)
?ar?ra. .
