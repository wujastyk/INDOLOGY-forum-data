Ancient Polish proverb:


"Go?? w dom, B?g w dom"


thought to express the very concept of Polish hospitality - and usually
translated as: ?A guest in the home is God in the home.?


But, the sense of the proverb is slightly, but meaningfully different: "A
guest [entering] into [our] home, is [like] God [entering] into [our]
home".


Idealists, those ancient Poles ---


But OK, nothing to be ashamed of.


Artur
