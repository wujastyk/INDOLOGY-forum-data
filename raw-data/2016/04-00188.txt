Subject: [INDOLOGY] Eating flesh of a jogi, a magician, a healer

Tibetan sources, no doubt drawing on something in one Buddhist tantra or another,
speak of consuming the flesh of one "born seven times a brahman." A particularly
good example is found in the hagiography of the 14th century mystic O-rgyan-gling-pa,
and in his well-known revelation, the Padma-bka'-thang. (For the hagiography,
one may refer to Dudjom Rinpoche, The Fundamentals and History of the Nyingma School.)

I have not traced out the Indian background for this motif. But some relevant elements have
been explored in Jacob Dalton's The Taming of the Demons.
