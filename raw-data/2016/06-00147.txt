My encounters in the new Pune

??? ????? ??????? ????? ??????? ??? ??? ?
????????? ????? ??? ??????????? ??? ??? ??
"Whenever I go to the Pune City, then my ancientness obstructs me at every
step."

???????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?
? ?????????? ?????? ????? ????????: ??
"In earlier times, there were Hanuman and Ganesh temples on every street,
but none of the modern drivers know them."

??????? ??? ??????????? ????????? ?? ?
???????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ??
The driver says: "Tell me some new name that I know, some place of Chinese
food, or some famous shop,"

?????????? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ?
?? ???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??? ????????????? ??
"Or, some Pizza place, or drama house, or dance studio, or a wine shop.
Tell me some place that I know where you wish to go."

????????? ?????? ????, ? ?????? ??? ????? ?
??? ????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??
When he says this, I become silent. I don't know this new city. How can I
go anywhere in this new Pune?

?????? ????????? ???: ???????????????? ???? ?
? ?? ???? ??? ??????, ? ? ?????? ?????? ??
The city where I was born and educated many years ago, that city does not
know me, and I don't know it.

??????? ??? ????? ????????? ?? ????????? ??? ?
?? ???? ?????? ???? ??????? ???????????? ??
The Pune city that I always remember is mostly forgotten here. The city
that exists here is a different Pune city.

??????? ??? ?????????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ?
??? ????????? ????, ? ?? ?? ???? ?????? ??
I remember the Pune city that lives in my mind, and the city that I visit
now is not in my memory.

????????? ??????? ? ???? ????????? ?
??? ???? ??????? ??? ????????,? ??? ?????????? ??
I arrive from an ancient past and don't recognize the new city. The new
city asks me: "who are you?" What shall I do?

???????? ???: ??????:, ?????? ????? ???: ?
???? ????? ?? ???? ???????? ????????????? ??
The driver says to me: "Where have you come from? You do speak Marathi, and
yet your speech appears to be somewhat old fashioned."

????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ?? ????????????????? ?
???????? ????????? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ??
"You speak like Lokmanya Tilak or like Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. In this
city no one now speaks like that."

?????????? ????? ???? ?????????????? ?????? ?
??????? ????? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ??
"Where does this old fashioned Marathi continue to be spoken? Why do you
even now speak this old fashioned Marathi?"

??? ???????? ? ?????? ??? ???????? ??????? ?
???????? ??? ????? ??????: ????????????? ??
Hearing this, I don't know what to say, since I did leave the Pune city
long ago.

??? ?? ??????? ????? ???? ??????? ?
??? ????? ?????? ???? ????? ???????? ??
The old Marathi language came with me. I only know that old Marathi
language, and continue to speak the same."

???????????? ??? ?????????? ? ?? ????????: ?
??????????????????????? ?????????? ?????? ??
"Let it be" said the driver to me and he, with a compassionate heart,
brought me to the desired place.

??? ??????? ??????? ?????????: ???? ??: ?
? ? ????????????????, ??????????????????? ?????? ??
Even after reaching the desired place, I still don't know by which roads
the driver took me there, how I came or went.

? ??? ?????????????? ?????????? ????? ?
??? ????? ???? ???? ???? ???? ????????? ??
No one recognizes me, and I don't recognize anyone. Thinking thus I wander
in this city here and there.

???????????????????????????? ???????? ????? ?
?????????????? ??? ? ??? ?????????? ????????? ??
Someone said to me from the side: "You look like my friend. Where are you
from and what is your name?"

?????????????????? ????? ???????: ?
?? ??????? ?????? ?? ?????????: ??? ??
I said: "I have been living in Ann Arbor, USA, for a long time, and so my
similarity with your friend may be purely accidental."

????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ???? ?
?????????????: ?????? ?????? ????? ???? ??
He said: "My friend Madhav Deshpande went to America fifty years ago, but
why do you look like him?"

??????????????? ??? ?????? ?????????????????: ?
? ?? ?????????????, ???????, ?????? ??? ????? ??
Having heard that, I said: "I am Madhav Deshpande from America, but I don't
recognize you. Who are you, and how do you know me?"

?? ?? ??? ? ?????? ??? ?????????? ??? ?
???????? ??? ??????????????? ????????? ??
He said: "Oh Friend, how come you don't recognize me, your school-mate? I
am Bandu with whom you used to play day and night."

????????? ??? ?????? ??? ??????????? ??: ?
?????????? ??? ???? ?? ??????? ???????????? ??
Having embraced Bandu, I said to him: "I did not recognize you, because you
now look totally bald."

??? ?????????????? ??? ???? ??????? ?
????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ??
"How will I recognize you after such a long time. Still, by God's grace, we
did meet each other, and that is beautiful."

?????????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ?
????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??
Thus, in this Pune city, a meeting with friends does occasionally happen by
good fortune, and that makes me happy.
