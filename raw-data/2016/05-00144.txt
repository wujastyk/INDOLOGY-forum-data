Thanks, I did not realize the text had m?ha- in place of mah?-.

?mah?r?ja? is an ?a stem due to ?r?j??hassakhibhya??ac? (5.4.91), which
carries over ?tatpuru?a? from ?tatpuru?asy??gule? sa?khy?'vyay?de??
(5.4.86). The rule ?nastaddhite? (6.4.144) accounts for elision of ?n? in
mah?r?jan + [?]a[c].
