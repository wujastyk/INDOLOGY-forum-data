There are two ways the truth issue references in this case can be viewed:

1. 'Itihasa' as a category by itself not translated as myth or legend or
any such thing:

The recent one I remember is this article in the lines of itihasa versus
history debate:

2. The 'truth' aspect for 'myth'  discussed in Kant and Kantian works may
also be useful as a theoretical/philosophical starting point.
