>> From Amy Heller (tibetologist):  I am currently studying a 408 page
>> 11th-12th century Tibetan Prajnaparamita from Tholing whose page numbering
>> does not conform to the specifics of W Tibetan manuscripts - there are many
>> "small" aberrant details , although the numbering is on the whole legible. A
>> colleague suggested to me that this is a reflection, perhaps,  of an Indian
>> tradition to conceal accurate numbering from the eyes of infidels,
>> presumably in vigor in N India, ca 10th-12th c (in Hindu and Buddhist
>> circles) to conceal from potential Muslim eyes??  I asked an Indian friend
>> (curator in an art museum) who  did not know of this tradition at all, nor
>> was I aware of it. Is this spurious or genuine? Feedback would be most
>> appreciated, thanks!
