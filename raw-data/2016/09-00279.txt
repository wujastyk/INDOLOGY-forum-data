Subject: [INDOLOGY] List of NMM manuscripts?
Message-ID: <20160930112845.8gwzljbrr44o800k@webmail2.abo.fi>


Dear colleagues,

A link to a huge file listing the Sanskrit mss catalogued by the NMM  
was posted on the Indology list some time ago. I downloaded the file  
but I have somehow managed to lose it. Is this file still available?

Sincerely
M?ns Broo
