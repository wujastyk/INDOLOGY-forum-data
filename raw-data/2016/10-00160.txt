Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sexual Harassment

I am sorry the diacritics I use for vedic accents and the h?cek (inverted
circumflex) *never* show in my emails. This is beyond my control. My
apologies for the inconvenience.



I was also reminded that the thread is ?sexual harrassment?, not ?rape? in
the strict sense. This is correct. Might I, with your permission, then add
the innocent question why public sexual harrassment in India is widely
known as ?Eve teasing??

The vast majority of victims are Indian girls. So, why an English ? but not
an Indian ? forename to designate a crime committed by male Indian youth
gangs against Indian women?

I have never quite understood the background of this bizarre denomination.
I am afraid in this particular case attempts at linking it to the premodern
past of India are bound to fail. Are there any explanations on offer?



Yours, cluelessly,

WS
