Dear Colleagues,

In the Mit?k?ar? commentary on Y?j?avalkysm?ti 1.319, royal edicts should include a date given in two ways:

[lekhyam?] yukta? k?lena ca dvividhena ?akan?p?t?tar?pe?a sa?vatsarar?pe?a ca k?lena

The first scheme is clear era to me, namely the ?aka era (78 CE), but the date "according to Sa?vatsara" is not. A little digging suggested that it might refer to the Vikrama era or, more likely it seemed, to one of the cyclical years of the 60-year B?rhaspatya sa?vatsara of Jupiter (per Sewell and Dikshit?s Indian Calendar).

I figured someone could quickly set me straight.

Thanks in advance,

Don Davis
