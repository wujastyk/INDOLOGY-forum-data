Thank you for your contribution.
All the mss of this commentary I could access are in devan?gar?.
I would add that certain devan?gar? ?va and sva can be easily mistaken for
kha. Even if we do not consider the pronounciation and we rather stay on
the paleographic level, it is very easy to explain how dhane?vara? could
become ca nekhara?. That's why I took for granted that ca nekhar?lamk?ra is
just a corruption of dhane?var?la?k?ra and as such not worth taking in
consideration.

Best,
Gaia
