As per the requests of members, a CSV file with
verbform,verb,lakAra,suffix,verbnumber format is made available in
Devanagari
e.g. ??????,???,???,????,10.0460.

See
www.sanskritworld.in/public/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/generatedforms/verbformsdeva.tar.gz

The verb number is consciously not changed to Devanagari, so that it is
amenable to easy machine handling.
