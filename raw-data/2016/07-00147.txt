Among his later descendants we have ?aiva scholars like N?laka??ha D?k?ita.  How did these ?aiva and Vai??ava affiliations develop within this one and the same family?  If anyone knows sources for the family history of Appayya D?k?ita and his lineage, I would very much appreciate to know those sources.  Thanks for your assistance.
