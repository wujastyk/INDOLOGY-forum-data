Subject: [INDOLOGY] Demise
Message-ID: <77051c3445411e4db262486d61437cc4.squirrel@webmail.ucalgary.ca>

I would like to join Drs. Brockington and Soni in expressing my sorrow at
the loss of a careful scholar who was also a gifted and generous teacher.
It is hard to imagine that I will no longer be able to call on his
expertise in Sanskrit and Gujarati linguistics. He will be missed, indeed.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Rohlman
