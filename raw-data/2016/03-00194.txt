Thanks.

The "vision document" and "the action plan" submitted to the ministry of
HRD has been accepted by the ministry and in turn the ministry has written
DO letters to the heads of the institutions, departments and autonomous
bodies under MHRD to see the action plans are implemented within the
existing policies of the govt and to report to the ministry in case any
discrebencies are found in current policies while implementing the action
plans for Sanskrit development. With this the commitment of the Govt to the
cause is evinced - sources confirmed.

Now it is the responsibility of the local teams of Sanskrit fraternity to
take action on the letter by the Govt in order to get the vision translated
into reality.

One more very important matter : CBSE has taken a step to promote Sanskrit
studies in its schools across the country by authorising local heads of
institutions to appoint Sanskrit teachers wherever necessary including 11
and 12 standards. Now this news has to be brought to the notice of local
Sanskrit teachers, which will create an employment opportunity for Sanskrit
teachers and study opportunity for students. Kinldy inform the concerned.

With best regards
