Dear Jeffrey,

Scholarly publications on Indological topics, but not destined solely for Indological
readership, are increasingly dispensing with diacritical marks. If the scholarship is
sound, I think that gives you a precedent. But I suppose I would want a doctoral
student dealing with this material to be familiar with correct usage and so perhaps
to supply an index in which the diacritical marks are given -- but that's just my preference.

best,
Matthew
