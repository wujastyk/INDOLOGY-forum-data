Subject: [INDOLOGY] Macdonell on Usas
Message-ID: <CAP1Y1zsQmXm1ZWTfN_+3y9O6YXQv_vniJP4wLqEW7pXyOfnWEw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I have undertaken a study of the Usas hymns in the Rgveda, under the
illuminating guidance especially of Louis Renou [EVP 3].  Renou mentions
there an article in JRAS 1932 by Macdonell which translates the Usas hymns
of the RV.  Since Macdonell has expressed great respect for these hymns :
"Usas is the most graceful creation of Vedic poetry and there is no more
charming figure in the descriptive religious lyrics of any other
literature", I ask list members for help in getting access to this article.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
