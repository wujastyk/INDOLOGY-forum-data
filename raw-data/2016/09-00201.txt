Subject: [INDOLOGY] New article on Sanskrit

Yes, my proposed Sanskrit translation should read:

???????? ????? ??????? ?????????????,
??????? ??????????-?????????-???????????? ? ???????????????????????? ?
??????????? ?


One may doubt on how to interpret "secular state" : I took it in the sense
of laukika-bh?va or laukikatva, perhaps the intention was rather
laukika-r?jya.

Best wishes,
Jan
