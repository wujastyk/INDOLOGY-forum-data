Life as one of of Monier-Williams? assistants may not have been entirely a bed of roses. Please raise a glass to the unfortunate Dr Sch?nberg, whom I can?t help thinking of as the Bob Cratchett of Indology:

> He was succeeded by the late Dr. Sch?nberg (a pupil of the late Professor B?hler), who came to me in a condition of great physical weakness, and whose assistance only extended from May 20, 1884, to July 19, 1885, when he left me to die. He was a good scholar, and a good worker, but impatient of supervision, and, despite my vigilance, I found it impossible to guard against a few errors of omission and commission due to the rapid impairment of his powers.

> It was noted by several contemporary critics. He even copies some of the misprints appearing in the Peterburg dictionary. But this was the first edition of Monier Williams (1872). The second edition (1899) was completely revised and in this he was helped by several assistants and colleagues ? all mentioned at the end of his introduction. He visited India three times, but never lived there, and there were no pandits in Oxford.
