I have once more come up against a quotation from an astrological work 
no longer extant, with a variant of ?ry? that I don't recognize:

divase ca var?alagne dinakhe??n?? ni??gate ?nye??m |
balam adhika? kr?rasth?ne ca ?ubhair a?ubham anyath? tu ?ubham ||

'If the ascendant of the year [falls] in the daytime, the strength of 
the diurnal planets is greater; if in the nighttime, [the strength] of 
the other [planets]. By the benefic [planets falling] in an evil place, 
there is misfortune; good fortune if it is otherwise.'

Both halves of the verse consist of 30 m?tr?s, but in the second 
half-verse they seem to divide into 15+15 rather than 12+18. Is this a 
permissible variant or a sign of textual corruption? I haven't seen the 
variant described anywhere, but all mss at my disposal agree on the 
reading. Many thanks in advance for any hints!
