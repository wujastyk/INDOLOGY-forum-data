Dear Harry,

as several colleagues have already tried to make it clear in earlier posts on 
this list, it is not Monier-Williams, but Otto von B?htlingk who is to be 
credited for such dictionary entries as the one concerning ya??i which you are 
referring to.

In his monumental "Sanskrit-W?rterbuch" (1855?1875; co-authored with 
Rudolph Roth) B?htlingk has written the following on ya??i: "f. nom. act. von 
1. yaj P. 3,3,110, Sch. wohl fehlerhaft f?r i??i." (PW, vol. 6, p. 95a, s.v. ya??i 
2). In his unsurpassed "Sanskrit-W?rterbuch in k?rzerer Fassung" 
(1879?1889) B?htlingk kept this entry revising and abridging somewhat his 
earlier explanation: "f. Nom. act. von 1. yaj. Richtig i??i." (pw, vol. 5, 134a, 
s.v. ya??i 2). In the first edition of Monier-Williams's dictionary (published in 
1872) its compiler simply translated B?htlingk's explanation which he found 
in the newly published volume six of PW, skipping thereby one part of the 
information (in particular the details concerning P??ini's s?tra): "sacrificing, 
(perhaps incorrect for 3. ish?i.)" (MW, p. 804b, s.v. yash?i 1). In the second 
edition of Monier-Williams's dictionary (published in 1899) we read 
"sacrificing, P??. iii. 3, 110, Sch. (prob. w. r. for ish?i)" (mw, p. 840c, s.v.
