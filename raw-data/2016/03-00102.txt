Dear Collagues,
in Greek and Latin China was known as Serica, from the first century BCE on, but this signifies just the country of Seres or ?silk-producers?. In Ptolemy?s Geography Serica is northern China, while southern, reached from sea, is the country of Sinai. Cosmas Indicopleustes in the early 6th century had Tzinista for China, perhaps from early Arabic or Persian.

Beside KA? and Mbh, C?na and Mah?c?na are met in late parts of the P?li Canon, references in Malalasekera (at home, I cannot check it now).

Marco Polo did not introduce China, for him China was Cathay (a late name related to Russian Kitai). Portuguese China is first attested in 1516 and could be learnt in India or South-East Asia, althougn Persian ch?n? as medieval name of porcelain may have influenced. The s-form is curiously found in the name of orange in many European languages (e.g. German Apfelsine), ?the apple of China?.

Just to show that the names of China have been discussed quite a long time, I add an early reference:
Klaproth, J. 1827. ?Sur les noms de la Chine?, JA 10, 53-61 (with notes by E. Jacquet, JA 2:10, 1832, 438-453 & 2:11, 1832, 188f. 
Best,
Klaus

I was under the impression, though, from something I read somewhere (that statement wouldn't get past Wikipedia) that C?na in Tantrika texts, especially the Mah?c?n?c?ratantra, referred to what we today call the Assam-Burma region.  Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Northern Burma that sort of area.
