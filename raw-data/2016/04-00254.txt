V?caspatimi?ra, generally understood to favor ?iva, acknowledges that adherents of the P?ta?jalayoga??stram consider Vi??u to be their ??vara. He says, in concluding his comment on ?dividv?nnirm??acittamadhi??h?ya k?ru?y?dbhagav?nparamar?ir?sur?ya jij??sam?n?ya tantra? prov?ca (yogabh??yam to yogas?tram 1.25):

 sa eve?vara ?dividv?nkapilo vi??urna<:> svayambh?riti bh?va?~| sv?yambhuv?n?? tv??vara iti bh?va?~|

James Haughton Woods translates this as: [The reply would be that] this same ??vara, the First Knower, the Self-existent Vishnu [is] Kapila. "But [He is] the ??vara of those descended from the Self-existent." This is the point.
  
Note that V?caspati frequently refers to adherents of the P?ta?jalayoga??stram as sv?yambhuva? (for example, in ny?yaka?ik?).

Kalidasa is of the firm view that the entire Vedanta corpus (ved?nte?u) proclaims Siva to be the highest Reality (puru?a) that pervades all the universe.  Kalidasa and Patanjali definitely belong to very early period. Thus by ??v?ra-pra?idh?na it is fully plausible and also possible,  that Patanjali meant only worship of Siva. And, worshipping a supreme God need not be interpreted as ''sectarian''. One cannot ''worship'' a supreme reality which is nirguna.

>> Thank you very much for your observations. I have not been aware of the variations on the concept of yama/niyama in Puranas and later Yogic texts, it is most interesting.
>> The subject of difference in "niyama" regulations for ascetics at different stages in Kau??inya's theory is quite interesting. Kau??inya himself considers it a peculiar trait of the system, or scripture ("tantra"). At the same time, a similar differentiation of niyama rules seems to be accepted by some early Naiy?yikas, who otherwise seem to follow quite closely the theory of Pata?jali (with regard to the practice of Yoga).
>> Even though it seems true, that Ny?ya came under influence of P??upata authors at some point, this idea of differentiation of niyamas is hinted at even in V?tsy?yana's Bh??ya--which was written too early to speak about P??upata influence, I think. Hence the search for other possible sources of this peculiar variation.

For example, Chapter 25 of the S?a?rada?tilakatantra, the ?ivayogad?pik?, Yogayaj??valkya, and many others ? and here, I imagine, particularly for the ?aiva texts, they might be drawing from the earlier P??upata yoga traditions.

(although a later 10-chapter version of this text does include yamas and niyamas), and thus we are left to speculate on their optionality. Perhaps they were left to be filled in by a guru, or elsewhere from a sectarian tradition, or were in fact left out of yogic praxis entirely (although I doubt this). But I think it?s safe to say if they are included in a prescriptive yoga text, they were not considered optional for that author, but rather par for the course. This is most clear in the PY? and its commentaries, as Prof. Bryant astutely notes, but I think also holds for the later medieval texts as well.
