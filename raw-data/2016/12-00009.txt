Dear colleagues,

I am trying to find/order a copy of Vishva Bandhu's *Br?hma?oddh?rako?a*,
which was published in 1966 by the Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research
Institute and is listed in the catalog that one can download here on the
VVRI's website: http://vvrinstitute.com/about.html.

Although mention is made on the same website of a Book Agency and Sales
Department, I haven't been able to figure out how to place an order, nor
have I received responses to my emails to the following contact addresses:
info at vvrinstitute.com, vvrinstitute at gmail.com, vvr_institute at yahoo.co.in.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Best wishes,

Dieter Gunkel
