This dismissive approach to RV exegesis is astonishing to me.  I have spent my entire career studying the RV, and in my experience of studying  it within the context of the Indo-European Dichtersprache I have found no IE text that is more difficult, or in more need of careful exegesis, than the RV [except perhaps for Old Avestan, or Pindar...].  We can argue about this, but to say that the RV can 'speak for itself' seems to me to be naive, or perhaps full of hubris.

His name itself tells us that he intends to keep his audience in darkness.  We now, some 3000 years later, cannot sit down with him to interrogate him about what meanings stand behind his intentionally dark language.

I take pleasure in examining its riddles.  I also take pleasure in trying to translate it into a poetic and mysterious English.
