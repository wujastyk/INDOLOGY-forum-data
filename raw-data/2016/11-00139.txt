View (a) needs evidence. Do we have any? Apart from genetic evidence, is
there any other way to prove it?
View (b): what exactly is meant by a quasi-brahmin?
View (c), frankly speaking, is ludicrous and borders on conspiracy theory
(I hope it is not meant to be a joke). As if the Brahmins have an
underground organization (like the Mossad) which *infiltrates* other
communities to distort their teachings!!

Ved?dhy?pana is indeed done by Arya Samajis who are not Brahmin by birth.
There is an influential Arya Samaj Pandit by the name Mahender Pal Arya who
was born a Muslim and teaches Vedas (
http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-a-journey-from-maulvi-to-pandit-2047727).
It is also noteworthy that not only did the Arya Samaja give new meanings
to most mantra-s of Veda-s, they also gave a new definition of Veda by
restricting it to only the *mantra* (*sa?hit?*) portion, different from the
traditional definition *mantra?br?hma?ayorvedan?madheyam* (?.?rau.s?.
24.1.31).

Still, Udupi/Udipi restaurants are common in Ahmedabad, where I lived for
four years (2000 to 2004). There is a popular one at Paldi Char Rasta which
was frequented by many students and tourists back then.
