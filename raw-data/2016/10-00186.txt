Thank you George, Professor Dominik Wujastyk, Richard Mahoney for your response.

It?s interesting that there?s no similar complaint from anyone else! Mine must be so special that the hawky-Google can?t take its eyes off me!!!

I do have the copyright as you can see from the attached picture.



The original thesis is kept at UofPenn and microfilm copies were available from UMI, Ann Arbor for a minimal fee. A couple of years ago some other establishment started distributing PDF versions, I believe. Now Google.

I don?t understand how they can completely ignore the author in all this! I?m very tempted to go to Google head quarters which is close-by and have a talk with the big guys.

So, ok, I?ll send a written letter first to UMI and start from there.

Thanks and regards,
rajam
