The ?Dh?tur?panandin??(Janardana Hegde, 2013, New Delhi: Samskrita Bharati, ISBN 978-81-87276-67-3, p. 259) lists the ?san? conjugation as ?cuk?utsati?. Now this form cannot be expressed by taking `san? from the `sannanta? root ` bubhuk?? since ??ai?ik?nmatubarth?y?cchai?iko matubarthaka?, sar?pa? pratyayo ne??a? sannant?nna sani?yate?
