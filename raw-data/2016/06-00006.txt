Dear colleagues and friends,
 
on behalf of the board of the European Association of Asian Art and Archaeology (EAAA), I am happy to announce the
 
Second EAAA conference in Zurich: 24.-27. August 2017.
 
The date was chosen so as not to coincide with the scheduled 15th EAJS conference, which takes place from 30. August - 2. September in Lisbon, Portugal (http://www.eajs.eu/?id=305). For anyone traveling from afar, it might even make sense to combine the two events.
 
Timeline:
30. June 2016: official call for papers
15. November 2016: Submission of panel and paper proposals
 
28. February 2017: Notification of acceptance
31. March 2017: early bird registration deadline
31. May 2017: conference program published
 
Abstracts:
follow the AAS standard: 250 words for both panel proposal, and paper abstracts
 
Membership:
A membership of EAAA is a prerequisite for panel and paper applications ?
annual membership fees are a mere 30 ?, or 10 ? for students, and we welcome donations!: http://www.ea-aaa.eu/members
 
For more information on the EAAA and its conference, visit: http://www.ea-aaa.eu
In case you have any questions, please contact: info at ea-aaa.eu
 
We look forward to receiving your abstracts and panel proposals and to welcoming you to Zurich!
 
On behalf of the EAAA board, I wish you all the best
and hope for your participation in the Second EAAA conference,

Julia Hegewald.
