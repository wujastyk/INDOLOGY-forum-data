I once saw a brass celestial globe and, though my memory may mislead me, brass astrolabes with Nagari inscriptions that appeared old in one of the shops in the Sundar Nagar Market in New Delhi, but this was years ago.

Dear List,

I am in Udaipur and, trying to find astrolabes or other instruments (ancient or new), I only meet? shop's tenants who propose me to find an astrolabe (new) but need time for that. I suppose they know people who are still able to make these instruments (as S.R.Sarma ensured me to exist in Udaipur), but of course they don't want to give me more details. Does anybody know more about this ?
