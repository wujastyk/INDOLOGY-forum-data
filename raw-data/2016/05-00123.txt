aimed at the highest-calibre
?recent PhDs

The University of Alberta has just advertised it's Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship application procedure for September 2017 submissions.  The application procedure is somewhat complex, with applications first being prepared through the University of Alberta, and only then being submitted onwards to the relevant Canadian Research Council.

The University of Alberta's procedures are described here:

  *   http://www.postdoc.ualberta.ca/FundingandFellowships/Banting.aspx<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.postdoc.ualberta.ca_FundingandFellowships_Banting.aspx&d=CwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=OexeZ8MxdDtG-vmgQnF4naSuL2ZZHevv0vCfInS-Xi8&m=I6KP9ho7re1QqJuO1cOWsQ7-VHQbwZSXBPW_c_0GdcM&s=YuurKKKY03QmHerLsdiK7BZN3XkImZV6bAacHwYEGNM&e=>

There are numerous eligibility criteria, including the requirement
?that a
pplicants to the 2017 program must fulfill or have fulfilled all degree requirements for a PhD between September 21, 2013 and September 30, 2017.

If you think you would like to apply for a Banting Fellowship to work on an indological topic at the University of Alberta, please contact me personally in the first instance.  Competition is tough, and the application is a two-stage process with the preliminary application package due on June 10, 2016. Those preliminary packages will be reviewed by adjudication committees; selected nominees will be instructed on submission of the full application package by August 31, 2016.

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
