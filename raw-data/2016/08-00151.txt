Dear Indologists,

looking for the follow pdf:.

*Matsyapurana*. Ed. by J.D. Akhtar. Delhi: Oriental Publisher, 1972.

and/or:

*Matsya Mahapurana (With an Exhaustive Introduction, Sanskrit Text, English
Translation and Index of Verses)*. Ed. by K.L. Joshi. New Delhi: Parimal
Publication, 2007.

Best,
Paolo
