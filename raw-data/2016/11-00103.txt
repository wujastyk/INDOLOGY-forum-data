Luis,

Was the person you met called Shyamasundara Dasa? As I recall, he claims 
to have been the first to use this term, though I didn't know he did so 
as early as 1974. Mainstream interest (if one can call it that) in 
jyoti?a didn't develop until the 1980s, so that was probably when the 
term gained wider circulation. But there are others who have made the 
same claim, so perhaps the term was coined separately by several people. 
If memory serves (I couldn't swear to this), one was Chakrapani Ullal, a 
Kerala-born astrologer with links to Swami Muktananda. There may have 
been others as well.
