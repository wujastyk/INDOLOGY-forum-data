Subject: [INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari on Mac
In-Reply-To: <1752931590.3816319.1468597719883.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzcLV0vnU98XdR5_6criKQwRfD4j=Ax16CwQY490gwPOaw@mail.gmail.com>

This is a question as to how to get multiple markings on the same vowel
sign.  In my pre-Unicode diacritics font Manjushree-CSX, I had included,
for instance, the sign for vowel "a" with three markings, length, nasality
and accent.  This is necessary to represent P??inian procedures accurately.
P??ini deals with eighteen varieties of "a, i, u, ?" etc. differing in
length, accent and nasality. Is there a way to do this with unicode fonts
and keyboards?
