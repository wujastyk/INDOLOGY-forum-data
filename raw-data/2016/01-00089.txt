Dear Akalendu Das,

The Vij?apti-m?trat?-siddhi was written by Vasubandhu. There are two short
texts by him with this title. One is the Vij?apti-m?trat?-siddhi Vi??ik?,
in twenty verses, and one is the Vij?apti-m?trat?-siddhi Tri??ik?, in
thirty verses. Hs?an-tsang (Wade-Giles system) or Xuanzang (pinyin system)
wrote a commentary on the Vij?apti-m?trat?-siddhi Tri??ik? in Chinese, in
which he synthesized several Indian commentaries. So this commentary is
mostly translations from the various Sanskrit commentaries, put together by
Xuanzang. It favors the commentary by Dharmap?la. Xuanzang's teacher in
India, ??labhadra, had been a pupil of Dharmap?la. Xuanzang's Vij?apti-m?
trat?-siddhi translation/commentary became the basis of the Yog?c?ra school
of Buddhism in China. Because of its importance, it was chosen by Louis de
la Vall?e Poussin to translate into French.

Best regards,
