Dear Friends,

Has anyone ever come across this parsing of 'Hindu' before? I was under the
impression that 'Hindu' had an alternate etymology.

In Sanskrut, the word Hindu is broken up as hin + du. 'Hin' means to remove
and 'du' means darkness. In other words, anyone who makes efforts to remove
the darkness of spiritual ignorance (that is, a seeker), is a Hindu.
