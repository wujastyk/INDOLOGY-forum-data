Subject: [INDOLOGY] Literature on ISKCON
Message-ID: <CAJZXY-ROCvFD-zUk8cbr95ZrkeyPd68J_V9jrzkJxoYDYxbenQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

A student of mine is writing a term paper on ISKCON ("The Hare Krishna
Movement"). Could you please kindly recommend reliable sources (books or
articles) on this organization, its demographics, economics, belief system
and practices? Sources treating this subject from a comparative perspective
would also be very welcome.

Many thanks!
