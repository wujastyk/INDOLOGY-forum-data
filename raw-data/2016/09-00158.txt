Subject: [INDOLOGY] Correction: Nepalese Documents Database
Message-ID: <E4C72D01-0F59-4361-AF91-03D88AA0C518@asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de>

Dear list members,

The team of the research unit ?Documents on the History of Religion
and Law of Pre-modern Nepal? of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and
Humanities is happy to announce the launch of its website and database.

The database ?Documenta Nepalica? features two interrelated parts,
?catalogue? and ?editions.? The former aims at bringing together
information about published and unpublished historical documents from
Nepal, while the latter is the platform for digital (XML) editions of
documents selected from the catalogue by the members of the project.

You may access the website here:
http://www.haw.uni-heidelberg.de/forschung/forschungsstellen/nepal/index.de.html

Selecting the tab ?Documenta Nepalica? will take you to the database
proper. As this is an open access project no log-in is required.

Come and explore!

For any queries or comments please contact us (nepal at adw.uni-heidelberg.de<mailto:nepal at adw.uni-heidelberg.de>).

With best wishes
Axel Michaels with Manik Bajracharya, Simon Cubelic, Rajan Khatiwoda, Astrid Zotter, and Christof Zotter
