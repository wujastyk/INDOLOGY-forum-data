Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brill MyBook program
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeH8=qpjNAcfXMEFq=OYhXMwk9EJ0EN043sLHSmG2ko=g@mail.gmail.com>

I've just bought a couple of Brill titles at $25 per book, under their "
MyBook <http://www.brill.com/products/books/brill-mybook>" program.  The
books are well-produced and I would say that the text is indistinguishable
from the expensive hardback editions.  The books I have don't have
illustrations, so the issue of colour->b/w doesn't arise for me.

I'm pleased with these books, and happy to have a Brill book that I can
read physically, and that didn't cost their common eye-watering prices.

I'm lucky in that my university library subscribes to the Brill Online
e-library.  That's what makes this possible.

Best,
Dominik
