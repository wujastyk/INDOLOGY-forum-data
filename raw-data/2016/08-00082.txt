Dear Suresh garu,

vEtanam is paid in return to a service.

vartanam /vritti (as in the Telugu munuvritti paid during divorce) is paid for the purpose of subsistence , not (necessarily) in return to a service.

Dear All,   Actually, the book of Jeong-Soo Kim (2010) does not treat anywhere the issue of Skt. vetana-, since he does not go beyond the material from RV and AV. I may mention that in his second etymological dictionary Mayrhofer quotes vetana- under vedana- (II, p. 580) with question mark, and only refers to his previous dictionary (III, p. 254). I have nothing new to offer, but I would assume that the very specific meaning of vetana- does not favor any identification with v?dana- (RV+), which does not mean 'wages, hire, salary', etc.

Best regards,    Georges-Jean Pinault

which is partly dedicated to nouns suffixed with -ana-. If the author treats vetana- in the book, there should be some discussion of its morphological composition.

Actually, Mayrhofer (3: 254) says ?Vielleicht doch mit Mehendale? ? and given the vid etymology. The change from -d- to -t- is viewed as a NW dialectical variation. He also refers to Kuiper (ZII 8, 263f) who appears to derive it from veto with the suffix -tana, as Mr. Misra states. There appears to be no consensus among historical linguists.

Dear Colleagues,

M.A. Mehendale, ?Some Remarks of the Language of the Original Buddhist Canon,? Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, Vol. 17, No. 3 (December 1955) suggests that the etymology of Skt. vetana ?wages? is "vedana ?wealth, possessions? from /vid ?to find, to obtain, to give, etc.? which is known since the Rgveda? (p167).

Would those of you with IE expertise kindly confirm this etymology, point me elsewhere, or share your thoughts on alternative etymologies?  I have not yet been able to check Mayrhofer.

Sounds dubious, for how the d of vid would change to t when followed by a vowel is beyond me. Here is the authentic traditional etymology:

>
v? gativy?ptiprajanak?ntyasanakh?dane?u (DP 1048) ? v?patibhy?? tanan (US 3.150) ? v? + tanan ? halantyam (A 1.3.3), tasya lopa? (A 1.3.9) ? v? + tana ? s?rvadh?tuk?rdhadh?tukayo? (A 7.3.84) ? ve tana ? vetana.

The U??dis?tra v?patibhy?? tanan (US 3.150) ordains the suffix tanan (of which only tana remains) from the root v? gativy?ptiprajanak?ntyasanakh?dane?u? which is used in the meanings of gati (movement), vy?pti (pervading), prajana (conception), k?nti (desire), asana (throwing), and kh?dana (eating). The rule s?rvadh?tuk?rdhadh?tukayo? (A 7.3.84) results in the ?v?? ? ve transformation to get ?vetana?.

>
The word occurs in Amarako?a 2.10.38, and the various commentaries on it may be consulted. Both the Udgh??ana and Vy?khy?sudh? commentaries cite US 3.150 and explain the word as v?yate anena iti vetanam. The form v?yate is the passive (yaki, or karma?i) form of the root v? whose active (karttari) form is veti. The meaning of v?yate anena iti vetanam, consequently, is ?that with which [something] is obtained is vetana?. Roots with the meaning ?to go? also have the meaning ?to obtain? as per the maxim ye gatyarth?ste pr?ptyarth??.
