In the Nalop?khy?na (in the Sanskrit Reader, Charles Lanman, p. 9-10) from
the Mahabharata, Damayant? threatens to kill herself, if rejected by Nala.
She refers to four alternatives to kill herself:  yadi tvam bhajam?n?m m?m
praty?khy?syasi m?nada / vi?am agnim jalam rajjum ?sth?sye tava k?ra??t //,
"O, Giver of Honor, if you reject me who is devoted to you, then on account
of you, I will resort to poison, or fire, or water, or a rope."
