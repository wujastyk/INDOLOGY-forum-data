More on Qin. Indeed ?? in all the contexts I know of would refer to ?? Later Qin (384 - 471 CE) and not ? Qin (221 - 207 BC). After all, there is no attestation of the usage of ?? before Later Qin. Another argument against Qin as the source of c?na or any other similar derivations is that the character ? was a voiced sibilant which lost its voicing quite late (Old Chinese: ?in/zin, Middle Chinese: ?jin/zjin). Reconstructions vary among linguists but they all agree on the voicing. The Chinese linguist Zheng-Zhang Shangfang proposed therefore ? Jin (O.C. cinh, M.C. cji?n) as a better candidate. He further pointed out that China was referred to as "sinstan" in Syriac in the famous Nestorian Stele. Just like Greek, there is no unvoiced affricate in Syriac and c became s. Zheng-Zhang's analysis seems attractive to me because this Syriac "sinstan" connects to the very old ????? I referred to earlier (M.C.: cintan).

Many Sanskrit astral texts contain k?rmavibh?ga type of descriptions, correlating directions with country names and thus give us some clues of the geographical knowledge of the authors. In early Indo-Greek works like Yavanaj?taka and V?ddhayavanaj?taka, there is no reference to c?na. In Var?hamihira's B?hatsa?hit? (6th century) we find c?na in the the long list of place names belonging to the direction NE:

> As for Dan's comment on the origin of China, or even c?na, I don't think it can be so easily answered. Qin? was indeed the first Chinese empire, but it was very short-lived and there is no source I am aware of that Chinese ever referred themselves as people from Qin; or conversely, I am not aware of the knowledge of the Qin Empire in non-Chinese sources. Chinese referring themselves as people from various dynasties did become common later on, and indeed in the Chinese Buddhist texts, the reference to the people of Qin?, that is referring to Later Qin (384 - 471 CE), is found frequently.

In Shijia fangzhi ????, a quote attributed Chengguanzi??? of Later Han, dated 205 CE, referred China as ??? - country of Zhendan (from C?nasth?na?). Later all, similar Chinese translations ?????????????? are found frequently in early Buddhist texts throughout first half of the first millennium. This seems to add a Central Asian factor to "c?na", since c?nasth?na is not attested in Sanskrit sources. It is possible that the Sanskrit "c?na" was adopted from this earlier "c?nasth?na" or similar variants used in Central Asia. "C?na" was translated into Chinese only later, appeared as ?? (zhina) in Narendraya?as' Chinese translation dated late sixth century CE, followed by the more common ?? (zhina).

In Ptolemy?s Geography Serica is northern China, while southern, reached from sea, is the country of Sinai. Cosmas Indicopleustes in the early 6th century had Tzinista for China, perhaps from early Arabic or Persian.

I was under the impression, though, from something I read somewhere (that statement wouldn't get past Wikipedia) that C?na in Tantrika texts, especially the Mah?c?n?c?ratantra, referred to what we today call the Assam-Burma region.  Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Northern Burma that sort of area.
