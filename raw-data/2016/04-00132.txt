Dear All,

I have been looking for a PDF of the following catalogue of the Sanskrit
Mss kept in BHU etc. Is there is a PDF available? I failed to locate one or
is it that I am simply missing something out there.

*Trip??h?, Ram? ?a?kar. (1971) Descriptive Catalogue of the Samskrit
Manuscripts in Gaekwada Library, Bh?rat Kal? Bhavana Library and Samskrit
Mah?-Vidy?laya Library, Banaras Hindu University. Banaras Hindu University
Samskrit Series 6. Varanasi: Banaras Hindu University. *

I would highly appreciate if someone can share a PDF with me. Thanks very
much in advance.

Best wishes.
