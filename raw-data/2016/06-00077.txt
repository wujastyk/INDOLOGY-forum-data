Subject: [INDOLOGY] J?ti as Caste in Ny?ya?
Message-ID: <D3882780.11447%drdj@austin.utexas.edu>

Dear Colleagues,

I would be grateful for additional references to an argument mentioned in Jayanta Bhatta?s ?gama?ambara 4.143-4 (in Dezso?s edition in the Clay series).  The question is whether the j?ti of Brahmins, etc. is like the j?ti of cow-ness, etc. in being empirically observable or directly perceivable.  Jayanta refers to those who say that verbal/textual testimony alone (?abdam?tre?a) establishes the four-var?a system.  This prefigures an argument made in Vij??ne?vara?s Mit?k?ar? (on Yaj 1.90) where the same distinction is drawn to refute an objection.

I assumed Jayanta would have made a similar argument in his Ny?yama?jar?, but I have not been able to locate it (probably because I barely know the Ny?ya literature).  If anyone could point me toward other instances of this issue, whether in original sources or contemporary research, I?d appreciate it.

Best,

Don Davis
