I'd say it would be prudent to have such contracts reviewed by
commercial solicitors with international experience and perhaps also by
a firm of patent attorneys. Cost is an issue but most firms would be
willing to have a chat to give you a sense of what you and your
colleagues might be up for. `Frankenstein' contracts are not unknown.


Best, Richard
