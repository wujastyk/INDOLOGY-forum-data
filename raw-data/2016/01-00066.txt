Subject: Early Evidence of Christianity in India
Message-ID: <0927784D-56BD-4B21-BEF8-83EDE7B9F76E@googlemail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am currently working on Christianity?s presence in first millennium South Asia for an article for a new, rather inclusive, companion to Late Antiquity.

I am familiar with the patristic sources and, of course, the Acts of Thomas.

I am concerned to track down evidence on the Indic side (such as the famous  ?stone cross inscriptions? or the copper plates of king Ven???).

Can anyone help me to make sure I have not missed anything important? 

With Thanks,
