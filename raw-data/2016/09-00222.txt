Sorry for the obvious mistake in my previous message: Please read  
"long-short-long-long-short-short" instead of  
"long-short-long-long-short-long". The corrected message runs:

> The entire article can be briefly summarized in Sanskrit by  
> referring to the view of Bhartrhari
> praj?? viveka? labhate bhinnair ?gama-dar?anai? |
> kiyad v? ?akyam unnetu? svatarkam anudh?vat? ||
> (view of Bhartrhari as formulated probably by his student: note, in  
> addition to other arguments, the exceptional and unnecessary  
> metrical clumsiness in p?da a ;

It is not metrically clumsy; praj?? viveka? labhate forms a regular  
bha-vipul? (structure ra-bha with regard to syllables 2-7:  
long-short-long-long-short-short).

Best wishes,
