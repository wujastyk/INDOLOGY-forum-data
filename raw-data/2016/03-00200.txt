Vamsi Juluri is not a ?she' but a ?he?. He is one of the prominent exponents of the Hindutva viewpoint in this country. Just take a look at the endorsers of his book on the back cover of the book ?Rearming Hinduism?. This fight between ?India? and ?South Asia? is a favorite of the Hindutva and especially Rajiv Malhotra. Should the Indology list be involved in this? See his article http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/treasurehunt/it-is-time-to-speak-up-against-the-hinduphobia-of-foreign-writers-vamsee-juluri/ <http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/treasurehunt/it-is-time-to-speak-up-against-the-hinduphobia-of-foreign-writers-vamsee-juluri/>.

On a positive note, I am glad somebody on the Hindutva side acknowledges the existence of regional languages and presumably they are Indian and they have a ?voice? too. The vision plan for Sanskrit said, "Sanskrit, it is acknowledged, is not just a language. It is the voice of India?s soul and wisdom. It is the link between India?s past and present. It has been the vehicle of Knowledge Tradition of Bharat.? [emphasis mine]

Appaentlty Vamsi is fighting to prevent India being lumped with South Asia in her University in California. Her questions are probing and sincere and she needs our support in her fight.
