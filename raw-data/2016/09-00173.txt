Dear Colleagues,

The fall issue of World Policy Journal, titled "History's Ghosts", is just
out.

The issue published by Duke University Press journals, is now live online
<http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/fall2016>, and here is a direct link
<http://wpj.dukejournals.org/content/33/3/45.full> to my article in it,
titled "The Return of Sanskrit".

The Return of Sanskrit
How an Old Language Got Caught up in India?s New Culture Wars

Indian scholar Ananya Vajpeyi examines the way the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party is using Sanskrit to advance a Hindu supremacist agenda. She argues
that academics need to step out of the ivory tower and resist the
government?s manipulation of this ancient language.

?Thanks and all best,

Ananya Vajpeyi. ?
