Apologies for cross-posting:

For the upcoming AAR Annual Meeting in San Antonio, Texas, Nov. 19-22, the AAR Group, Religions in Chinese and Indian Cultures: A Comparative Perspective, is eager to receive proposals dealing either with cross-cultural influence between India and China, or a theme viewed through Indian and Chinese perspectives. This year we are especially seeking proposals dealing with

? Afterlife in Chinese and Indian religions

? Saints and Sainthood in Chinese and Indian traditions

? Maritime silk road

Submissions for full panels or individual paper proposals are welcomed. Other themes, especially as a full panel proposal, are also welcomed.

The AAR deadline for proposals is March 1, 2016. 

They should be submitted through the AAR website PAPERS portal.
