Hello Deven,

I noticed the name Mahacina occurred in the Cinacara Tantra, where is narrated that Vashistha went there from Kamarupa (Assam) to learn from the Buddha the Kaula system of panchamakara/panchatattva, needed to worship the goddess Tara/Kamakhya. If I remember well, 
L. Biernacki (2007. The Renowned Goddess of Desire; and an article on Vashstha published in 2006) speculated that for the text's compiler(s) the Buddha is an avatara of Vishnu. 
Sorry for lack of diacritics but I'm using the mobile to write.
Best,
Paolo

Oggetto: [INDOLOGY] Origin of Mah?c?na

Dear list members,


A Sinologist colleague of mine has raised the following question to me.  Any thoughts would be appreciated:  


Conventional wisdom among certain Sinologists is that the Western name "China" derives from the Sanskrit Mah?c?na, etc.  Sinologists do not seem to know, or at least do not cite, sources for this attribution.  How old is the name, and how trustworthy are the texts?



Thank you,


Deven
