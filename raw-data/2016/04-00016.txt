Dear Howard,

the official notification from the University of
Copenhagen governing board

   http://bestyrelse.ku.dk/moeder/moeder2016/bestyrelsesmode-82-b/Pkt.04.01.pdf

contains the following:

   INDOLOGI: Lukkes som fuld BA? og KA?uddannelse,
   men s?ges videref?rt som BA?tilvalg knyttet til
   uddannelsen i Moderne Indien.

   [INDOLOGY: Will be closed as full BA and MA course
   of study, but attempts will be made to continue it
   as a BA elective associated with the Modern India
   course of study.]

Hardly a consolation, and the formulation ?s?ges?
does not inspire confidence in even this much.

All best,
Stefan
