Thanks for that clarification.

But, dear Klaus, I still tend to have doubts. Has M-W's correspondence been
checked? Have M-W Indian travels itineraries been checked? The lists of
people he visited collated?

M-W reminisces (p. VII): "[...] *on each occasion I met to my surprise with
learned and thoughtful natives [...] able and willing [...] to explain
difficult points in their languages, literatures, religions , and
philosophies.*"

And - even if not M-W himself, his other Western cooperators/contributors
must have had Indian assistants, at some or other time of their
professional careers as Indologists.

-----------------------------

I can see the topic has undergone a split.

Regards,

Artur K.
