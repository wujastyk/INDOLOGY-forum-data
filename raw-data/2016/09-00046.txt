Speaking of undergraduates, here is the view of a real live one (of languages and classics), admittedly not unrelated to me.

By the way, very funny and telling, Adheesh!

My opinion is that diacritics should always be used except in proper nouns (with a key to explain what they mean at the front of the book). This parallels the classicists' practice of referring to people generally by anglicised names (Ovid, Livy, Mark Anthony etc.) but using actual Latin for other nouns eg. Ovid's 'Amores', Cicero 'in Verrem'.

Obviously when Sanskrit is quoted at length, full diacritics must be used, proper nouns included.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks

Dear Jeffery,

In general, regardless of audience, I would feel that it?s acceptable, and sometimes even preferable to do away with diacritic marks and go with commonly observable Roman-script spellings for Sanskrit terms, or Tamil or Arabic or any language X terms for that matter, if these are isolated terms within what is otherwise a complete English sentence (or German or French or any language Y sentence). If you make mistakes in diacritics, for example, it can lead to serious errors, say if you were to make claims about R?ma?s b?la instead of his bala.

But if one encounters an entire phrase, sentence, or passage that is without diacritics, then trying to read it becomes a total train wreck.

Just consider what would happen the other way around?

??? ?? ????? ????-???? ????? ???? ??  ??-?? ?????? ??????, ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?
?????, ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ? ??? ???????? ???? ???, ?? ???? ??? ? ??? ?????, ?? ??? ?????????? ?? ?????? ?

How?s that for candid?
cheers,
Adheesh

Dear Colleagues,

I have a somewhat delicate question on which I would appreciate your candid opinions.

Imagine a doctoral dissertation in the field of philosophy.  The primary audience for this dissertation is other philosophers, most of whom are likely to have little or no expertise in the field of Indology.  The dissertation does, however, engage quite extensively with Indic philosophical traditions and texts, and does so in a serious and responsible fashion.  Because the author him or herself is also, however, primarily a philosopher and not an Indologist, s/he does not deploy diacritical marks in presenting Sanskrit terms.

How would such a dissertation be regarded by most of you?  Would the non-use of diacritical marks alone disqualify this work from being taken seriously?  (My own reaction: I would personally find it distracting and irritating, but not disqualifying if the scholarship were otherwise sound.)  Your thoughts?

With thanks in advance,

Jeff
