> If you are talking about the downloader, which has never worked for me anyway, I don?t know.  DLI seems to be in the process of shifting over from the old on-line page-by-page reader to offering PDFs.  There are multiple portals, and I have found that files from http://www.dli.ernet.in from come in at a trickle or are ?not found," but this portal works fine at the moment:
