Good morning,

Does anyone have a pdf copy of the following article?

Bareau, Andre. "Un personnage bien mysterieux: L'epouse du Buddha," Pages 31-59 in Indological and Buddhist Studies, Volume in Honour of Professor J. W. de Jong on his Sixtieth Birthday. Edited by L. A. Hercus, et al. Canberra: Australian National University, 1982.

I was sure I had it, but I now suspect that my computer ate it.

With gratitude,

Vanessa R. Sasson
