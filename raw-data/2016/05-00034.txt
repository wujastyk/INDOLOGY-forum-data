Hans: you have given only the back of the image, but this looks like a Jain image ? many such images are in existence with the same time of inscriptions in the back. Actually, I also have one with a date somewhat later than this. I think Losty, formerly of the British Museum, has published a book containing similar images. I will try to dig that up for you.

Best,

Patrick

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

A friend who is not an Indologist has asked for help in assessing an inscription on an object (image attached).
Several questions arise: 1. Does the object look genuine or could it be a fake? 2. Is the Nagari variant compatible with the date of Sa? 1354 (left vertical column)? 3. Is the language Sanskrit or a Sanskritized form of a different language? 4. Is it possible to figure out the meaning of the inscription (some of the characters are pretty worn down)?
Looking forward to responses and with all best wishes,
Hans/Hans Henrich/Hans Henrich Hock
