Subject: [INDOLOGY] Astrolabes in Udaipur
Message-ID: <851057873dd6d5a5d@wm-srv.ulb.ac.be>

Dear List,

I am in Udaipur and, trying to find astrolabes or other instruments (ancient or new), I only meet  shop's tenants who propose me to find an astrolabe (new) but need time for that. I suppose they know people who are still able to make these instruments (as S.R.Sarma ensured me to exist in Udaipur), but of course they don't want to give me more details. Does anybody know more about this ?
