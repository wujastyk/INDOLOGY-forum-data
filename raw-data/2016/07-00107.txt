Yes, This is true, but have you found a convenient way to enter the full range  of diacritica for Romanized Sanskrit without having to resort to Emoji/Latin/favorites inserts? 

This is not the worst thing in the world, but slower than the old Easy Unicode or Dev Unicode keyboards.

I had no idea that this wasn't possible or easy on a Mac.  Wow.  And the Mac used to be the byword for multilingual support.  I'm glad it's okay now, at least.

Previously, I had to enter Unicode Devanagari in something like TextEdit and then copy and paste into a Word document, but was not able to edit it in the Word document.  The new development of software has happily changed that situation.  Hope this information will be of use to some of you.  Best,
