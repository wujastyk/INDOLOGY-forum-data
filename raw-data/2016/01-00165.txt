Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pururavas and the "Six Emperors"
Message-ID: <CABcuftR-sJYuJGmTuAurPFCaxSFuv-Dq0JriYxb6xk-CUCRGdA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
Is anyone familiar with local (pre-modern) traditions, textual, ritual or
other, involving Pur?ravas (with or without Urva??)?


In addition, I'm searching for the origin of the phrase "??u
cakkiravartti",  "The Six Emperors" (Tami?), a list which has some
variations but usually includes Nala, Pururavas, Ariccantiran and
frequently Mucukuntan and Karttaviriyan?

Thank you,
