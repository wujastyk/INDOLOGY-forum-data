All cultures, religious and other traditions are made of continuities,
changes and discontinuities;  unities in diversities. To be able to grasp
the whole picture with all the intricacy of relations in a cultural complex
with a long history and a wide geographical spread that is outside the
researcher's own culture needs a great amount of patience, empathy and
delicate observation and fine understanding. In this difficult balance beam
exercise, tight rope walk, it is easy to loose the balance and fall into
discontinuities and diversities and miss to connect the continuities and
unities.
