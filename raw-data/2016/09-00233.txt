Dear Patrick,

> I thought I might find some help here in locating the passages I seek.

By m?m?ms?, if you mean the original book of the dar?ana on which all the
books known as m?m?ms? books are composed, you do not get any passages as
you sought. The book is in the form of s?tras. .

If you saw a passage as you mentioned, it must be a book interpreting or
discussing the s?tras.

??stra compelling someone to act in a certain way is a complex issue.
Depending on which samprad?ya a person follows, and the var?a and ??rama to
which one considers oneself belonging, feeling oneself  compelled
by ??stra to follow karmak?n?a varies.

For example, a sanny?si of advaita or a follower of certain Bhakti
tradition may not feel compelled that way.

You might want to know the complexity of these details.

A list member may guide you to a publication discussing such details.
