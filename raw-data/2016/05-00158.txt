Dear all,

I am working on the sixth chapter of Ratn?kara's Haravijaya, together with
its commentaries by Alaka and Utpala. It is an ode to ?iva in which he is
praised with reference to a wide variety of systems and their texts known
at that time (Kashmir, 9th century). Thus the commentaries contain many
quotations that Ratn?kara might have had in mind when composing his verses,
quite some of which I haven't been able to identify yet so that I would be
happy for pointers. Here is one:

In verse 170, ending a pa?cabhi? kulakam,

pratipadya ?a?kara bhavantam avyaya?
sukhadu?khamohaparih??acetana? |
vyativ?ttatantumayabandhan???ako
bhagavan bhav?n iva bhavaty a?u? sphu?am || 170 ||

there is mention of a bandhan???aka escaping which the a?u becomes like
?iva. Referring to which the commentators Alaka and Utpala quote the
following:

pr?k?to vaik?ta? c?pi (A, U: caiva) ?ha?k?rika eva ca |
s?ttviko r?jasa? caiva t?masa? c?para? sm?ta? ||
dharm?dharm?tmaka? ceti pa?or bandh???aka? bhavet |
(A, U: dharm?dharmamaya? ceti pa?o? p?????aka? bhavet |)

It has been suggested to me that the quotation might come from a tantric or
?ivadharma milieu.

A parallel idea of eight bondages is described in Kul?r?avatantra 13.90-91,
but the set there is completely different:

gh??? sa?k?  bhaya? lajj? jugups?  ceti pa?cam? |
kula? ??la? tath? j?tir a??au p???? prak?rtit?? || 90 ||
p??abaddha?  p??ur j?eya?  p??amukto  mahe?vara? |
tasm?t p??aharo yas tu sa guru? paramo mata? || 91 ||

Best,

Peter
