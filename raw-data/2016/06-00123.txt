Jitari has written a short treatise on this subject called dvijAtidUSaNa. It is not yet edited, but I have a preliminary transcription of it. If anyone is interested, please contact me off the list.

For both j?ti is a perceptible category, but the relation of  j?ti with individual is given as a combination of difference and non-difference for the former, whereas it is difference for the latter, according to whom the apposition (individual - universal) is through inherence. Pr?bh?karas admit the existence of genus/class of substance, but refuse to accept the existence of genus of quality and action.

>> Dear Don et al.,

>> Since Christophe brought up M?m??s?: the relevant passage in Kum?rila is Tantrav?rttika ad MS 1.2.2. This is interpreted by Halbfass in the chapter of Tradition and Reflection mentioned by Sam Wright. (I look forward to reading his forthcoming article in JIP.)
>> 
>> The issue for Kum?rila is mainly the perceptibility of universals, as H. explains. The var?as pose a sort of test case. It's not at all clear that one can just SEE that someone is a brahmin. K. argues that, even though various factors may be required to stimulate perception of a universal - in the case of Brahminhood, for instance, being told the person's lineage - it is perceptible nonetheless. Cf. ?lokav?rttika Vanav?da 26-29, where the problem is discussed in more general terms; other problematic cases are mentioned there (e.g., how does one perceive gheeness in melted ghee? - by smelling or tasting it!). Some universals may be more difficult to perceive than others, but even if one has to climb to the top of a mountain in order to see something (presumably something very far away), that does not make it not perceptible (na hi yad giri???gam ?ruhya g?hyate tad apratyak?am, TV 1.2.2).
>> 
>> There may be certain cultural prejudices in the background of Kum?rila's discussion (here I'm thinking of what Dominik wrote and some of the things Halbfass says: Brahminhood is determined by a universal, not by conduct; it is inherent in someone; there's certainly no social mobility here!), but ultimately I think he is concerned to defend the notion that real (eternal) universals, which are perceptible, as opposed to the pseudo-universals of the Buddhists (apohas), are the meanings of words. Since the universal cowness is perceptible, we can SEE that that is the meaning of the word "cow" when someone points to a cow and says, "That is called a cow." Otherwise, it is not clear how the connected between word and meaning could ever be established.

It's on my back-burner, but I've long wondered whether Sanskritic narratives about jati and varna can be thought about in ways similar to eighteenth and nineteenth century European narratives about races and species.  Were people of different varnas formally considered to be of different "species?"   It's a bit shocking to think in these terms, but I've been wondering about it.  If you ever put flesh on these bones, one way or another, or can point me to existing discussions on this, I'd be really interested.

The question is whether the j?ti of Brahmins, etc. is like the j?ti of cow-ness, etc. in being empirically observable or directly perceivable.  Jayanta refers to those who say that verbal/textual testimony alone (?abdam?tre?a) establishes the four-var?a system.  This prefigures an argument made in Vij??ne?vara?s Mit?k?ar? (on Yaj 1.90) where the same distinction is drawn to refute an objection.
