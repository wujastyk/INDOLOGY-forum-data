material.From the nature of its wide scope, much of the compilation has 
had to be made from translations into the major European languages, or 
from summaries found in secondary literature, resulting in the omission 
of material inaccessible by these means; regrettably, we also have no 
way of knowing whether the translation or summary used has been totally 
reliable.Where possible, always check carefully before placing too much 
reliance on it. Wewill warmly welcome any corrections or supplementary 
information from other scholars specialising in individual fields.With 
all its deficiencies, weoffer this inventory as a tool to facilitate 
further research, not as a substitute for such research, and we will be 
pleased to learn of any use to which our work is put.

Because of the nature of our own contacts this message is being sent 
primarily to other Indologists but, if any of you are aware of 
colleagues in other fields (for example Southeast Asian languages or 
visual culture) who might be interested, do please pass the information 
on to them ? and similarly, if anyone has access to academic lists on 
which it could be posted, we would be grateful for its being sent to 
them.We shall ourselves be sending it to the INDOLOGY and RISA lists.

With all good wishes
