Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF of Mironov's Catalogue of the St Petersburg Indian mss collections
Message-ID: <57AADF76.3040903@oeaw.ac.at>

Dear colleagues,

I was wondering whether anyone might have a PDF of Mironov's catalogue
of the St Petersburg collections of Indian mss (details below).

N. D. Mironov: Catalogus codicum manu scriptorum Indicorum qui in
Academiae Imperialis Scientiarium Petropolitanae Museo Asiatico
(Petropoli 1914, repr. Delhi 1984).

I did searches at archive.org, the Digital Library of India, as well as
on the website of the Institute of Oriental Manuscript of the Russian
Academy of Sciences (http://www.orientalstudies.ru/), but could not find
one.

I am specifically interested in manuscripts of texts in Sanskrit (or
other Indian languages) that were gifted to the Tsar by the 13th Dalai
Lama. A ms of Kamala??la's third Bh?van?krama (edited by Obermiller) is
one example -- part of a bundle that also contained leaves of the
Vini?cayasa?graha?? --, and I am trying to find out whether there were
more.

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
