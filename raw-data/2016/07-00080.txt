Dear list members


I am looking for usages of the form ?m?tarapitarau? which was allowed for
in the opinion of northern ?c?rya-s by ?m?tarapitar?vud?c?m? (A 6.3.31).


A Google Book search on the Unicode ????????? led me to discover that the
form is used in Hemacandra?s ?Pari?i??aparva?, but the snippet view
(attached image) does not give any idea of where (which chapter or verse)
the form is used. That the usage occurs in the work is further confirmed by
the discussion by the editors Vijaya Dharma S?ri (and his two disciples) in
the introduction to Muni Bhadra S?ri?s ??r???ntin?thamah?k?vyam?. Please
see page 9 of the attached PDF (page 7 in the book) where the editors in
their refutation of H Jacobi?s assessment of Hemacandra?s language discuss
the form ?m?tarapitarau?.


If somebody has a digital edition of  ?Pari?i??aparva? or has come across
the form ?m?tarapitarau? in the work, can they please help with the
complete citation?


In addition, citations of any other attested usages of ?m?tarapitarau?
outside grammar works would be welcome. I am already aware of the examples
in the ?Mah?bh??ya? (?m?tarapitarau bhojayata?? and ?m?tarapitar?v?naya?)
and grammatical commentaries. I am not referred the Vaidika Pad?nukrama
Ko?a (do not have a digital or print copy), perhaps the Vedic texts have an
example or two.


Thanks, Nity?nanda
