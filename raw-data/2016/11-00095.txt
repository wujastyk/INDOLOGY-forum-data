Yes, Indian Astrology or Bharateeya Astrology or any other term would have
been good. I agree. I am not here to justify the term Vedic Astrology. I
was trying to clarify only that the qualifier Vedic serves the purpose of
distinguishing it from Western Astrology.

Thanks Martin for giving the lead, " the term was coined in North America
in the 1980s and then exported to India, where it first appeared in the
1990s." for those who might want to see who of all did coin this wrong or
right term.

It would be an interesting study to see how many terms all over the
world, the meanings of  the titles of categories are not very much the same
as the abhidhEyArthas /mukhyArthas of the words in the titles. What you
call Chinese or Japanese could have contributions from India What you call
American could have contributions from pre-colonial America and many  parts
of the world. I guess there must already be very good studies on such an
obvious and easily imaginable topic.
