Subject: [INDOLOGY] "Drinking the washings of sacred writings"
Message-ID: <56B8FA10.3040808@gmail.com>

A colleague has asked about an expression recorded in the 1970s in Fiji 
during research on traditional healing among Indo-Fijians: "drinking the 
washings of sacred writings".

I'd be grateful for any suggestions of what this means.

Best wishes

Will
