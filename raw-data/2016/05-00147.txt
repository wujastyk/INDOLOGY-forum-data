I have nothing to do with this and only pass on the mail I received; it
looks to be mostly, but not all, modern...

Dear Prof. Silk, we would like to invite you to discuss with us the
sensibilities of Indian medicines during the following two-day workshop.
Indian medicine: Between state and village

*Workshop dates*
23 - 24 June 2016

*Venue*
Leiden University. Lipsius building (room 148), Cleveringaplaats 1, Leiden

*Convenor*
Dr Maarten Bode
<http://iias.asia/profile/maarten-bode?utm_source=phplist429&utm_medium=email&utm_content=HTML&utm_campaign=%5BIIAS+Workshop%5D+Indian+medicine%3A+Between+state+and+village.+Leiden%2C+23+-+24+June+2016>,
Adjunct Research Faculty at the Department of Anthropology, University of
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Adjunct Faculty at the Institute of
Trans-disciplinary Health Sciences and Technology, Bangalore, India

*The workshop*
Themes to be discussed in the workshop are: Indian medicines as tangible
and intangible heritage; Indian medicines as health security for the poor;
Indian medicines as identity markers (for the nation, for local
communities, and for Westerners in search of Indian spirituality). An
important cross cutting theme is the quest for legitimation and acceptance.
For example by linking Indian medicines to the global project of Evidence
Based Medicine and to Indian knowledge systems. Contributions from medical
anthropology (the actors? point of view) and Science and Technology Studies
(social construction of medical knowledge) are especially welcome. However
papers from other theoretical orientations are also greeted.

An important question is if and how Indian nationalist politics affect the
recognition, ownership, and management of the wide spectrum of traditional
medicines in contemporary India. Social-cultural research shows that on the
national level we see debatable - either unintentional or intentional -
attempts at reifying, ossifying and nationalizing Indian medicines as
Ayurveda. The suggestion is that Ayurveda as India?s national medicine is a
discrete medical system and that it provides the codified substrate for the
many local forms of herbal based Indian medicine practiced to-day. Though
this perspective has been contested as an act of appropriation, labelling
local forms of Indian medicine as Ayurveda can also be seen as an act of
empowerment. What is needed is a dialogue between two important
stakeholders: the Indian state and local communities. By discussing the
interactions between global, national and local forms of Indian medicine
the workshop wants to contribute to such a dialogue.

The meeting, organized by the International Institute for Asian Studies,
the Netherlands, will take the form of a series of discussions of new
academic papers that are submitted in advance of the workshop. A
peer-reviewed selection of the (revised) papers will subsequently be
prepared for publication in the scholarly journal *Asian Medicine:
Tradition and Modernity
