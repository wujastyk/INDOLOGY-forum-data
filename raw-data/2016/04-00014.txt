Dear Howard,

Looking at the Danish documents available online, it appears that Indology will be kept as a ?tilvalg? (minor) for the bachelor education in Modern India. As such, Sanskrit would still be offered for those studying modern India, but as a tool to understand modern India and not with a view toward an education in Indology. So, while Sanskrit would be offered, it?d be in a much more limited form than is the case now.

All best wishes,
Toke
