Dear colleagues,


Forgive me for cross-posting:


The Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris, has announced the creation of the following post, that may be of interest to some among you or your students:


"The post of ma?tre de conf?rences (equivalent to Assistant Professor with tenure) is devoted to teaching, research, and graduate student advising in relation to the Tantric traditions of India and/or the cultural regions in which Indian religions have spread (e.g., Southeast Asia, Tibet, China, Japan) and considered from various perspectives: theology, ritual, yoga, devotionalism, apotropaic practices, royal religion, etc.

"Candidates should have the linguistic competence permitting them to access and to study critically the primary sources pertaining to their areas of research. An active engagement in international research networks is expected.

"Applications are invited in all areas of Tantric Studies, though particular consideration will be given to those specializing in the Shivaite and/or Buddhist Tantric traditions of India.

"The post will interact with the chairs of Asian Religions (India, Tibet, China, Japan) at the EPHE, in order to contribute to the development of a coherent program of teaching and research on the religious life of these cultural spheres.

"The language of instruction at the EPHE is French and courses are held in Paris, within the administrative framework of the Doctoral School 472."


The application procedure will be found described here:
