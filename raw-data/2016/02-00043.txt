Subject: [INDOLOGY] Dakkaravasini/Tamreshvari temple in Paya?
Message-ID: <56bcc195.e2a1420a.94a1.ffffcdb9@mx.google.com>

Dear indologists,

today I read a D.C. Sircar contribute on ancient Assam history. He wrote that according with an inscription found in Paya (Arunachal Pradesh), there was an ancient Dakkaravasini/Tamreshvari temple which was obscured and replaced by the Dakkaravasini/Tamreshvari temple of Sadiya.
I'd like to know if anyone has ever been in Paya (near Tezu/Teju), and if there are archaeological evidences there. I'm going to Sadiya next week and if there is anything of interest I'll manage to get a PAP for Arunachal.

Best,
Paolo
