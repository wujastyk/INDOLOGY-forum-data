Dear all,
in one-word cases the traditional way is to use trema in the second vowel: pra?ga. In Sanskrit this is rare, but in Prakrit very common. In mana-indriya- hyphen is OK, but not inside one word.

Best,
Klaus

This makes a space possible, though not necessary. Indeed, such hiatus can occur within a word, which is rare in Sanskrit (e.g. pra'uga "the forepart of the shafts of a chariot; triangle"), but common in Prakrit. Here, it would be very odd to write a space, since it's within a word. I've marked the hiatus with an apostrophe, but Monier-Williams does it with diaeresis/tr?ma (two superscript dots).
