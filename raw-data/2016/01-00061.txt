Subject: [INDOLOGY] Stanley Insler's translation of the Rigveda?

I was able to contact Stanley Insler directly about this, and I here post
his reply, with his permission:

"Owing to a variety of other commitments, I abandoned my efforts to
translate the RV about 20 years ago. The project then fell into the hands
of 2 of my former students, Prof. Stephanie Jamison (UCLA) and Prof. Joel
Brereton (UT Austin). They worked from scratch for 15 years (I didn't turn
over my work to them) and their translation was published by OUP (in 3
vols.) in June 2014. It is excellent in every aspect. I say this not
because it is the work of my students but because it is excellent."
"Sincerely,
   Stanley Insler"

Best regards,

David Reigle
