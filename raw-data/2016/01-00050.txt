Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ordering NGMCP manuscript copies in Germany
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQEyVpC5jEVopp5Z4G8i3J9UYTi6aiA=7DdK3WxV2=Ry_A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

The NGMCP website.  https://www2.uni-hamburg.de/ngmcp/none_e.html
states that manuscript copies are no longer available either in Kathmandu
or Germany.  Does any member have any information on when it will again be
possible to order manuscript copies in either Germany or Kathmandu.

Many thanks,
Harry Spier
