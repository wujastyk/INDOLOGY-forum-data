Dear John and Mary,

Thank you very much for making available this  treasure store of scholarship and scholarly resources on the R?m?ya?a. It will certainly be a boon to scholars working on all aspects of the R?ma story in all of its innumerable  and endlessly diverse linguistic, regional and religious manifestations.

With all good wishes to you both.

> This material is part of our continuing attempt to survey presentations of the R?ma story as it has been developed from its origin in the so-called V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a, through transformations in all genres, media, languages,                 religions and geographical areas, until roughly the end of the eighteenth century.  However, later material has also been used if it preserves motifs or records trends relevant to the earlier period, though not where it introduces new developments.  In order to explore the crucial role played by sculpture and paintings in the transmission and development of the narrative, we have placed visual material side-by-side with verbal (narratives presented in words, whether written or spoken).
> The basis for the survey is: a Bibliographic Inventory providing references to everything of value consulted (and a list of our own publications); a detailed tabulation of the Narrative Elements employed and modified by successive tellers to build up the story; Background Notes and photographs; and unpublished Drafts surveying the material or arising  from it.  Guidance Notes give detailed instructions for use.
> The material is a joint project: John has compiled the Bibliographies, composed the Draft on Development and many of the notes, and taken the photographs; Mary has identified and tabulated the Narrative Elements, and supplied some of the Drafts and other notes.
