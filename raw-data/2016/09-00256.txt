My statements about Advaita vis-?-vis the two Bhakti schools Vi?i???dvaita
and Dvaita were not about ritual in a general , broad sense covering p?j?
rituals and other rituals of 'Hinduism'. It was about karma in the sense of
yaj?a and other rituals covered by m?m?ms?.

The debate is around karma - j??na .

sagu?a - nirgu?a debate is different from this.

Advaita's position is that the compulsion of karma-performance as ordained
by m?m?ms?. does not apply to a(n Advaita sanny?si)

Vi?i???dvaita and Dvaita say that even a sanny?si has to perform karma.

A comparison of commentaries of Sankara , Ramanuja and Madhva on Bh G 3-17
is a very good sample for the three positions.
