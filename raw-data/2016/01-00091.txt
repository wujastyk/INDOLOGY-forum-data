Subject: [INDOLOGY] a recent review of the Jamison-Brereton RV translation	by Karen Thomson
Message-ID: <CAP1Y1ztJhaZS3tPNx3-mk1+M6xFZ0uiJd3-XnoPQwB-rbpXkdQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have recently received a pdf file of a strange petulant revew of the J-B
translation of the RV by Thomson in the Times Literary Supplement Jamuary 6
3026.

I have tried to attach this review to an email to Indology, but it failed.
Have others seen this  weird attack?

I will be happy to try to attach the review to individuals on the list.

This attack should be confronted.

George Thompson
