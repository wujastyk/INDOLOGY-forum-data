Dear Donald,

The second scheme refers to the regnal year of the king (whether he issued
the inscription or it was issued in his realm).
I was precisely looking at a 5th-century Pallava copper-plate inscription
when I read your email:
si?havarmma-m?h?r?jasya [sic] vijayasa?vatsare ek?da?e pau?yam?se
k???apak?e da?amy?m may? datt? t??pra [sic] pa??ik?.
With best wishes

> Dear Colleagues,

> In the Mit?k?ar? commentary on Y?j?avalkysm?ti 1.319, royal edicts should
include a date given in two ways:
>
> [lekhyam?] yukta? k?lena ca dvividhena ?akan?p?t?tar?pe?a
sa?vatsarar?pe?a ca k?lena
>
> The first scheme is clear era to me, namely the ?aka era (78 CE), but the
date "according to Sa?vatsara" is not. A little digging suggested that it
might refer to the Vikrama era or, more likely it seemed, to one of the
cyclical years of the 60-year B?rhaspatya sa?vatsara of Jupiter (per Sewell
and Dikshit?s Indian Calendar).
