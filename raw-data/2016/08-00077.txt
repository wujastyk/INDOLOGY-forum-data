Dear All, Actually, the book of Jeong-Soo Kim (2010) does not treat anywhere the issue of Skt. vetana-, since he does not go beyond the material from RV and AV. I may mention that in his second etymological dictionary Mayrhofer quotes vetana- under vedana- (II, p. 580) with question mark, and only refers to his previous dictionary (III, p. 254). I have nothing new to offer, but I would assume that the very specific meaning of vetana- does not favor any identification with v?dana- (RV+), which does not mean 'wages, hire, salary', etc. 
Best regards, Georges-Jean Pinault

He also refers to Kuiper (ZII 8, 263f) who appears to derive it from veto with the suffix -tana, as Mr. Misra states. There appears to be no consensus among historical linguists.

Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, Vol. 17, No. 3 (December 1955) suggests that the etymology of Skt. vetana ?wages? is "vedana ?wealth, possessions? from /vid ?to find, to obtain, to give, etc.? which is known since the Rgveda? (p167).

>Sounds dubious, for how the d of vid would change to t when followed by a vowel is beyond me. Here is the authentic traditional etymology: 
>v? gativy?ptiprajanak?ntyasanakh?dane?u (DP 1048) ? v?patibhy?? tanan (US 3.150) ? v? + tanan ? halantyam (A 1.3.3), tasya lopa? (A 1.3.9) ? v? + tana ? s?rvadh?tuk?rdhadh?tukayo? (A 7.3.84) ? ve tana ? vetana.

The U??dis?tra v?patibhy?? tanan (US 3.150) ordains the suffix tanan (of which only tana remains) from the root v? gativy?ptiprajanak?ntyasanakh?dane?u? which is used in the meanings of gati (movement), vy?pti (pervading), prajana (conception), k?nti (desire), asana (throwing), and kh?dana (eating). The rule s?rvadh?tuk?rdhadh?tukayo? (A 7.3.84) results in the ?v?? ? ve transformation to get ?vetana?.

The word occurs in Amarako?a 2.10.38, and the various commentaries on it may be consulted. Both the Udgh??ana and Vy?khy?sudh? commentaries cite US 3.150 and explain the word as v?yate anena iti vetanam. The form v?yate is the passive (yaki, or karma?i) form of the root v? whose active (karttari) form is veti. The meaning of v?yate anena iti vetanam, consequently, is ?that with which [something] is obtained is vetana?. Roots with the meaning ?to go? also have the meaning ?to obtain? as per the maxim ye gatyarth?ste pr?ptyarth??.
