Dear James,

I've found that some of the best materials to teach with for the 19th
century are Francis Robinson's and Barbara Metcalf's writings on Islamic
intellectuals in UP, Vasudha Dalmia's writings on Bhartendu Harishchandra,
and Tanika Sarkar's writings on Hindu women. (Although I have to admit that
I have to pick and choose portions of their writings, since their
monographs are usually too large for undergraduate courses.)  In any case,
those are my personal favorites.

Not long ago, John S. Hawley at Barnard taught an excellent course on
religious history in Mughal India with a very comprehensive and up-to-date
syllabus; I'm sure that he would be willing to share it (I can't seem to
find a copy at the moment...)

Best,
Tyler
