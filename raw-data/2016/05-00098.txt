Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devi Mahabhagavata Purana (?)
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf_vcsutQ5tm+d3sLMMR4e-scgZhW+_tZo1iKHO1_5FTFg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

I'm looking for a pdf copy of this purana:

*Devi Mahabhagavata Purana. (Sanskrit Text with English Translation)*.
Edited and Translated by Shanti Lal Nagar.

I'm also wondering if the text is either the "Devibhagavatapurana" or the
less know and very later "Mahabhagavatapurana", another purana compiled in
Assam and where the Mahavidya goddesses emerged in connection with Kamakhya
hill. Or maybe it refers to the "Devipurana" ?

Thanks for the help.
Paolo
