Subject: [INDOLOGY] suicide as a result of love
Message-ID: <CA+H=kyRV8TES_whz-O0QhmbF005YRqq5Pc3sMSedwRnN18189A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List Members

A colleague, Madhavi Menon, who is writing a book entitled 'A History of
Desire in India', has asked me the following question.  All help
appreciated; I will forward your responses to her.

"Are there any narratives in Sanskrit/Buddhist
literature/philosophy/history that talk about suicide, or ?tma-haty?,
specifically in relation to love and desire?"

Yours Alex
