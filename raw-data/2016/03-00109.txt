Subject: [INDOLOGY] A font for accented Vedic
Message-ID: <CAP1Y1zuc-hucDaHY4bpYY2BQn=LBaXcYHq=VBubuk6=EzAzRxA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,
.
For the time being, I am obliged to use a computer that does not have  a
font for accented Vedic text in transliteration.  Can someone send me such
a font so that I can submit a paper before an upcoming deadline?  I would
be very, very grateful.

With thanks in advance,

George Thompson
