Dear Artur,

the Sinhala Th?pava?saya has been translated by S. Berkwitz, The Enshrining of the Relics.
On p. 131f. you'll find the translation of this passage as follows:

"Dear boy! The enshrining of the relics has been done by King Aj?ta?atru. Create a suitable defense for them." The deity Vi?vakarma, who heard those words, came and prepared a device outfitted with figures of wild beasts, and created a device in the relic chamber out of wooden forms that held shining swords of crystal and that whirled around with a speed equal to that of the wind."

By the way the word v??a means predators in other contexts too. Thus we have diwans (palla?ka) the feet of which are decorated with figures of beast of prey (Vin IV 299,21f.).

Best,
Petra Kieffer-P?lz
