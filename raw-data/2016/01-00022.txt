*pada* may mean ?place, station?.

There is a discussion on p?da/pada by Renou. Unfortunately I cannot go into
the details immediately. But I remember that it occurred either in the
Introduction G?n?rale AiG I 1957 or in ?Notes sur la version ?Paippal?da?
de l?Atharvaveda? *Journal Asiatique* 1964, 421-450. I may give further
information later.

Best
