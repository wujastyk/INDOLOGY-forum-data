It was noted by several contemporary critics. He even copies some of the misprints appearing in the Peterburg dictionary. But this was the first edition of Monier Williams (1872). The second edition (1899) was completely revised and in this he was helped by several assistants and colleagues ? all mentioned at the end of his introduction. He visited India three times, but never lived there, and there were no pandits in Oxford.

Best,
Klaus
