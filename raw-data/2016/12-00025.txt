Dear members of the list, 

I would be very thankful if anyone would be able to share a pdf of the following article (mentioned in Minkowski?s contribution to the ??str?rambha-volume):
V. Varadhachari ?A note on the ma?galav?da of the Ny?ya-Vai?e?ika school?, Adyar Library Bulletin 26 (1962) 28-35
As far as I could see, the concerned volume of the bulletin is lacking from the DLI.

In fact, I would be most thankful for any further bibliographic reference to the above topic as well. 

thanks a lot in advance, 

Andrey
