Dear Colleagues,

This is extremely sad news.  We are all so greatly indebted to Professor 
Tokunaga for his digital versions of the /Mah?bh?rata/ and /R?m?ya?a/ 
and for so much more fine scholarship.  I count it a real privilege to 
have got to know him, particularly during a period as guest professor at 
Kyoto University which he secured for me.  Coming so soon after the 
death of Professor Rajendra Nanavati, it leaves a great gap in the field 
of epic studies.

Yours

John Brockington

Professor J.L. Brockington
