Dear list members,

I'd be very grateful if anyone could provide me off-list with the contact
information of the staff of the Sri Venkateswara Oriental Research
Institute in Tirupati. (The address listed on the University's website,
orientalresearchinstitute at yahoo.co.in, does not work.) I'm specifically
looking to get in contact with Dr. C. M. Premalata.

Andrew
