Dear Friends,

Now that my PhD is complete I can get on with some projects that have been
in the 'to do' pile. One such project is the unfunded documentary series
titled: *Imagining Sanskrit Land*. These 5-10 minute films present
different aspects of quotidian life in the 'Sanskrit speaking' village
known as Jhiri, which is located in Madhya Pradesh, India.

In this episode I wanted to highlight how much effort goes into acquiring
water in a village where running water, or water straight out of the tap in
the house does not exist in any of the 90 dwellings in the village. The
burden of fetching water generally falls upon the women and young girls. In
India, many children miss out on an education due to this responsibility.

I hope you enjoy it.


All the best,
