Dear Johannes,

although it?s very far from Tibet, it appears that in Kerala a particular letter-numeral systems was used as a ?cryptographic code? through which only the initiated in the system were able to reorder the intentionally jumbled folios of a manuscript. On this, see Renou/Filliozat, L?Inde classique, p. 708.

Best wishes,

Marco Franceschini
