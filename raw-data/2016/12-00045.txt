Hi,

I am researching a series of 14th century Tibetan *tsakali* -- small
painted cards -- which includes figures wearing clothing that a colleague
tells me is "Eastern Indian in origin" (see below/attached). I've done a
lit review to document this (or not), but have yet to find substantive
relevant research on Indian textile design before the seventeenth century.
Does anybody have any suggestions?

Many thanks!
Laura Harrington
