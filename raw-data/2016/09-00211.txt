Dear Prof Karashima,

The issue of this missing journal has come up before. It seems it was never
published but some rare offprints of certain articles exist.

On the H-Buddhism list Prof Skilling requested this article back in 2011 -
I'm not sure if he ever successfully found it.

I think that Prof Maryla Falk was the editor and the collection was also
called "Samjna-Vyakaranam" - perhaps the full collection of her articles
can be found in her Nachlass via Prof Mejor in Krakow?

Hope some of that helps?

Kind regards,
Antonio Ferreira-Jardim
