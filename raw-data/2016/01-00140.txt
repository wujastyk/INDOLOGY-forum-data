> The material is far from complete, and we hope to be able to update it from time to time, and to produce further analyses and syntheses of the material.  From the nature of its wide scope, much of the compilation has had to be made from translations into the major European languages, or from summaries found in secondary literature, resulting in the omission of material inaccessible by these means;  regrettably, we also have no way of knowing whether the translation or summary used has been totally reliable.  Where possible, always check carefully before placing too much reliance on it.  We will warmly welcome any corrections or supplementary information from other scholars specialising in individual fields.  With all its deficiencies, we offer this inventory as a tool to facilitate further research, not as a substitute for such research, and we will be pleased to learn of any use to which our work is put.
> Because of the nature of our own contacts this message is being sent primarily to other Indologists but, if any of you are aware of colleagues in other fields (for example Southeast Asian languages or visual culture) who might be interested, do please pass the information on to them ? and similarly, if anyone has access to academic lists on which it could be posted, we would be grateful for its being sent to them.  We shall ourselves be sending it to the INDOLOGY and RISA lists.
