*Workshop on the Rasa Theory, Manipal, India*

*February 13-17, 2017*


*Organized by *

Manipal University, Manipal, India




Centre for Religious Studies invites applications for a week-long *Workshop
on the Rasa Theory* from *February 13-17, 2017* in Manipal.


*Introduction*


The *N??ya??stra *is an encyclopaedic treatise on art and aesthetics in
pre-modern India and* Abhinavabh?rat?, *the most widely studied commentary
on it by Abhinavagupta (c. 950-1020 CE). They are important for they are
the significant sources for understanding theatrics and dramaturgy,
philosophy of arts and aesthetics, and performing arts. They interest
scholars of Indian music, theatre, and literature, as well as intellectual
historians and philologists. Their proper understanding is an extraordinary
attempt towards the development of Indian intellectual history.


*About the Workshop*


There have been a number of attempts at editing and translating the text of
the *N??ya??stra *and* Abhinavabh?rat?, *including most recently Professor
K.D. Tripathi's first volume of the *N??ya??stra *(2015) and a selection of
translations included in Professor S. Pollock's *Rasa Reader* (2016). Despite
a relatively long history of scholarly engagement, however, much about this
tradition remains poorly understood, and the texts themselves remain very
difficult to establish conclusively: both texts are technical, and to add
to this, the *N??ya??stra* is available in widely-divergent forms in
several families of manuscripts, while the *Abhinavabh?rat?* is available
only in a highly corrupt form in a single family of manuscripts.


This workshop will principally include a close textual reading of
selections from the *Ras?dhy?ya* (chapter 6) of the *N??ya??stra* of
Bharatamuni?the celebrated work on Indian aesthetics?together with the
*Abhinavabh?rat?
*commentary of Abhinavagupta. The discussion in the *Abhinavabh?rat?*
includes a critical overview of the history of Indian aesthetics up to
Abhinavagupta himself in the tenth century, including such thinkers as ?r?
?a?kuka, Bha??a Lolla?a, Bha??a N?yaka, etc. The aim of the workshop is not
only to familiarize the participants with the principal questions and
debates in Indian aesthetics, but also to discuss the philological
challenges posed by these texts with experts in the field. We will
therefore work with parallel texts and manuscripts in our readings of the
*Abhinavabh?rat?*.


*Deadline for Application:*  *Wednesday 30 November, 2016*


*Program and Faculty*


Professor C. Rajendran, University of Calicut, Thiruvananthapuram will be
the principal instructor. We are also expecting a few other experts of
Indian aesthetics to join us. The morning and afternoon sessions will
include the readings of the text in Sanskrit followed by special lectures
in the afternoon. The seminar will be held in English and readings will be
circulated in advance. Special events like Yak?ag?na performance which is a
native folk theatre form of Malen??u region in Karnataka, will be organized
besides an afternoon excursion to the local Jaina temples in Karkala. There
also will be opportunities for exploring the incredible richness and
diversity of the region.


*Selection Criteria*


Advanced comprehension of Sanskrit language and the reading ability in
Devan?gar? script is required. We seek interested research students and
scholars from across India and abroad. The selection will be made based on
the strength of the application. We cannot accept more than 25

research scholars in disciplines or with experience in Sanskrit,
Philosophy, Aesthetics, Religion and Literature. There will be a
