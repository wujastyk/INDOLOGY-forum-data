Dear All:

After 25 years, my old server is being taken to wherever dead servers are buried. So now I have to get a new email address. And here it is:

jpo at austin.utexas.edu

The messages to the old address will continue to be redirect to the new one for some time. With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick
