Hans,

I think this conversation is slightly tangential to the original question,
but I believe is useful for all members of the group. I hope it is okay to
continue the discussion a little bit further.

I should have spoken about the charsets in my previous email. The use of
wrong charset is perhaps most likely cause of garbled text, much more than
the use of non-Unicode applications. Most of the modern word processing
applications are Unicode compatible, but if the default character encoding
scheme is set to anything other than Unicode (UTF-8), then, you are likely
to see garbled text when you try to edit a document that used Unicode
encoding.

Some of the recent versions of Microsoft Word doesn't let you change the
default encoding from "Unicode (UTF-8)" easily, but the earlier versions of
Microsoft Word had the default encoding set to windows-1252 (superset of
ISO/IEC 8859-1). If the default encoding is set to any of those pre-Unicode
standards, then, a unicode document saved on that application, while
retaining common characters such as  ?, ?, ?, ?,  ?, will replace
Unicode-specific characters with question marks, garbled text or blank
spaces. I think this is the primary cause of most of your issues with your
volume.

For a long time, Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Groups also had the default encoding
set to ISO-8859-1, although they supported Unicode (UTF-8) encoding as
well. That means, anyone receiving the email in Unicode can read it fine,
but if they forward or respond to it, then the new receiver will get
garbled text for the Unicode characters. I think Yahoo switched to Unicode
all the way by 2010, albeit a bit later than most of other popular web
portals.

As for the non-Unicode applications, I found Adobe Pagemaker to be the
biggest offender, in my experience. Several of publishing houses in India
still use Adobe Pagemaker for preparing material for publishing. although
Pagemaker cannot accept Unicode characters. Recently, we had to write a
program to map all Unicode based diacritics into a specific font
equivalents to facilitate publishing the book in India.

I believe there's virtually no excuse in this day and age not to be using
Unicode all the way. Some specialized encodings may be more efficient than
the Unicode encodings for certain languages. But unless you're storing
terabytes and terabytes of very specialized text, there's usually no reason
to change your encoding from the default Unicode (UTF-8). If you have older
documents that may have used other character encodings, it may be better to
get them converted to use the "Unicode (UTF-8)" encoding.

Regards,
Suresh.
