Dear Colleagues,

I am currently preparing a new undergraduate course on the religious history of  South Asia from the early sixteenth century to present.

I am looking for recommendations for studies of Hindu and Islamic movements in the eighteenth century in particular (I have plenty of material on the Sikhs).

Any suggestions will be gratefully received!

With Thanks and Best Wishes,
