Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF of Taittiriya Aranyaka vol. 3 by Mahadeva Sastri and	Rangacharya needed
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFh1HN1oCRdCkqTepYuZJ9fZ5H_UgHYam1BTnSS4tdrCw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

If anyone has a pdf of volume 3 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka by Mahadeva
Sastri and Rangacharya could they send it to me.

I know its in the Digital Library of India but I'm unable to download it
with my usual method with BitComet.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
