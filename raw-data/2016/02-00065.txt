Dear Friends,

Professor Dr. Manabendu  Banerjee, General Secretary, Asiatic Society,
Calcutta breathed his last today following a heart attack at the Society.
The news has just been conveyed to me by Professor Dr. S.C.Sarkar ,
Vice-president, Asiatic Society.

It is a great personal loss to me. We were close friends since 1958.

Dipak Bhattacharya
