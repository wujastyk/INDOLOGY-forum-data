Subject: [INDOLOGY] Language names and Personal names ...

I agree that the so-called language names in personal names won?t actually reflect the aspects of a language per se.

But then there remains a question ? why did that particular reference was chosen to be included in one?s name in any culture?

However, there remains another question for me ? how does an ethnic/regional identity arise? 

In the Tamil tradition, a Vaishnavite Saint Nammalvar (namm??v?r, ???????????) had many names including ?tami? m??a? ????? ?????."

[Anyway, since I?m not a professional socio-anthro-historian my perspectives would be so boring to others!]

Thanks and regards,
rajam
