Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devanagari font adequacy
In-Reply-To: <CAATk=rBwrJ70vS8eMrz=zijxRjRwnwrmAAyUsvcXQkJn71HhpA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CctUoWqDkUJtn_Cqpv1qe3Md3oY9qExrHmW+FPW-YpnRg@mail.gmail.com>

Another font to take seriously is the new Murty Hindi
<http://www.murtylibrary.com/mcli-fonts.php>, which is pretty good for Skt
too.   It's a font that, to my eye, looks a lot better on paper than on the
screen.

Nota bene also an interesting new Devanagari font created  by Alessandro
Graheli, that can be seen in his recent publication *History and
Transmission of the Ny?yama?jar?. Critical Edition of the Section on the
Spho?a *
(Vienna: ??
Verlag der ?sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2015
<http://www.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/Mitarbeiter/Graheli>
?) <http://www.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/Mitarbeiter/Graheli>?.  Alessandro has been
strongly influenced by his long experience with Sanskrit manuscripts, and
his font reflects the influence of scribal traditions, for example the
interrupted ak?ara-by-ak?ara m?tr? line.  It's subtle.

Best,
Dominik
