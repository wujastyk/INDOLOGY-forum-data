Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sandhi breaks in longer meters
In-Reply-To: <CAMGmO4+BDUDW=8X2kpZw0iSa0Z1S6mOc_y_392qCkFe6yK3bGw@mail.gmail.com>

The adhik?ra s?tra governing sandhi rules is "sa?hit?y?m", "when there is
conjunction".  So when there is not conjunction, no sandhi rule is
triggered.

In the Mah?bh??ya, Pata?jali does have a discussion about how slowly you
can speak and still be considered to be producing a v?kya.  This problem
can be related to the issue of what counts as conjunction.

Best,
Dominik
