Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sexual Harassment

I hesitate ---

Let me admit - yes, despite my Indological preparation - while in India (I
used to live and work there for four years) I had the feeling that the
omnipresence of the ?ivaite phallic symbols - erect and often presented
with naturalistic detail -- the feeling that these images themselves might
be felt as - sort of - aggresive instruments of sexual harassment. And that
feeling of mine was confirmed by my wife, a Christian by her upbringing,
and ethnographer by profession, but not an ardent church goer, not at all.

How these symbols are received by non-?ivaites? Any negative reactions in
literature?

I hesitate - I would not want my question to be taken as criticism directed
at the religious tenets of ?ivaism. Far from it.
