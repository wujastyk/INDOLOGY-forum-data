Applicants must have earned a PhD with a focus on South Asian religions by the date of appointment or shortly thereafter.

We seek a candidate whose research complements and enhances existing strengths in the Department of Historical Studies. The successful candidate will join a vibrant intellectual community of world-class scholars at Canada?s largest university. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is one of the most fascinating, diverse and ?livable? places in the world. The successful candidate will have the ability to teach a range of thematically focused courses engaging with the study of religion, contributing to the undergraduate program on the Mississauga campus, and will hold a graduate appointment at the Department for the Study of Religion on the St. George campus of the University of Toronto.
