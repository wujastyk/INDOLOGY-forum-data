>From the material that Asko has sent me I now see that Thomson also
dismisses the Witzel-Goto translation. Another off-list  email informs me
that Thomson was likewise dismissive of Louis Renou.

I knew that Thomson had had some association with the Univ of Texas in
Austin, but did not feel any desire to look into what she was doing there.

I was wrong to dismiss her review as naive.  It was nice to see that she
had some interest in the history of European scholarship on the history of
Vedic Studies.  But now I see clearly that her problem is hubris.

Please don't expect me to reply to more emails for the time being.  I have
developed a bad cold and I am suffering.
