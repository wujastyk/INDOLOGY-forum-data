Dear colleagues,

 

The Numata Center for Buddhist Studies at Hamburg University is happy to announce a new publication:

 

The Foundation History of the Nuns? Order 
by Bhikkhu An?layo

 

Hamburg Buddhist Studies Series 6
Series Editors: Steffen D?ll & Michael Zimmermann

 

Hardcover, 278 pages, ? 29.80

projektverlag, Bochum/Freiburg 2016

 

ISSN 2190-6769

ISBN 978-3-89733-387-1

 

 

This book is a companion to Bhikkhu An?layo?s previous studies of The Genesis of the Bodhisattva Ideal and The Dawn of Abhidharma. In the present book he examines the foundation history of the Buddhist order of nuns, based on a detailed study of the canonical accounts of this event preserved in Chinese, P?li, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. An?layo investigates how the different and at times conflicting parts of the textual account of this particular episode gradually evolved to constitute the foundation history in the way in which it is now extant. His findings put into perspective the Buddha?s refusal to found an order of nuns as well as the prediction that the going forth of women supposedly spells decline for the whole Buddhist tradition, showing how these elements would have arisen and then become part of the foundation history.
