> of which the land south of the Vindhya Range was known as Dakshinapath as
> an integral part of it.*

> I find my interest piqued by the following assertion that:
>
> *Ancient literature describes the country as a single well defined
> geographical unit from the Himalayas in north to the Indian Ocean in south.
> It is generally agreed that the culture and civilization of Bharat was
> continuous without a break.*
> Might anyone be able to point me towards this "ancient literature"? I
