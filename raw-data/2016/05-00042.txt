Hans,

I have the same problem on my Mac that Christophe reports, but I can see the image on my i-Phone. I have seen similar n?gar? script in at least one manuscript with a similar date, but I can?t say more until I see the image on a bigger screen.

Is it possible that this is an emergent technical problem on the Indology listserve server?

Is the language Sanskrit or a Sanskritized form of a different language? 4. Is it possible to figure out the meaning of the inscription (some of the characters are pretty worn down)?
