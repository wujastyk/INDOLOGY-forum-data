 To All,



          I have heard of   the SardulaKrana episode  in the Buddhist text Divyavadana speaking  on the life of King Trishanku( A chandala by birth) who wishes to marry off his son Sardulakarana to  a Brahmin , and who finds find scant logic in the traditional Hindu  caste system .He says-EkamIdam SarvamekaIdam i.e All are One.



             If anybody can provide any other references from Buddhist literature  showing such egalitarian attitudes.





                                                         ALAKENDU DAS.

                                                       Post-Graduate, Indology.
