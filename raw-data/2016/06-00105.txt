I do not have all my references at hand while traveling, but the discussion of br?hma?yam that begins at line 18 on page 767 of prabh?candra?s ny?yakumudacandra? should be of some interest.  I do not remember clearly, but there may be a similar discussion in abhayadevas?ri?s tattvabodhavidh?yin?.

It's on my back-burner, but I've long wondered whether Sanskritic narratives about jati and varna can be thought about in ways similar to eighteenth and nineteenth century European narratives about races and species.  Were people of different varnas formally considered to be of different "species?"   It's a bit shocking to think in these terms, but I've been wondering about it.  If you ever put flesh on these bones, one way or another, or can point me to existing discussions on this, I'd be really interested.

>>> I would be grateful for additional references to an argument mentioned in Jayanta Bhatta?s ?gama?ambara 4.143-4 (in Dezso?s edition in the Clay series).  The question is whether the j?ti of Brahmins, etc. is like the j?ti of cow-ness, etc. in being empirically observable or directly perceivable.  Jayanta refers to those who say that verbal/textual testimony alone (?abdam?tre?a) establishes the four-var?a system.  This prefigures an argument made in Vij??ne?vara?s Mit?k?ar? (on Yaj 1.90) where the same distinction is drawn to refute an objection.
>>>

If anyone could point me toward other instances of this issue, whether in original sources or contemporary research, I?d appreciate it.
