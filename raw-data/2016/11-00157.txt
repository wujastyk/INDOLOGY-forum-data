Thank you much for this, dear Alessandro.

Note that beside Bhoja's "?la?k?rika" Sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a, there is another, grammatical (in s?tra-form), Sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a ascribed to the same (which is not distinguished in Cahill's Bibliography).
The edition of the Sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a-vy?kara?a, in 8 adhy?ya-s, ascribed to Bhoja, with the (probably 11th c., contemporary) v?tti H?dayah?ri?? of N?r?ya?abha??a Da??an?tha, was left incomplete in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series; it was planned in 5 volumes, of which the first four only were issued: 

vol. I [http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/313457 or http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/407040] = TSS no. 117 (1935) contains the adh. 1, 

vol. II [http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/313459 or http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/407042] = no. 127 (1937) the adh. 2, 

vol. III [http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/313458 or http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/407041] = no. 140 (1938) the adh. 3-4, 

and vol. IV [http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/313401 or http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/406984] = no. 154 (1948) the adh. 5-6 [+ index]. 

The vol. V with the adh. 7-8 was said ?in the press? from 1948 onwards : it should have had the no. 182 in the series (the no. with the title of the vol. is still said ?not yet published? in 2005). One can fear that the manuscript of this last volume is now lost (I mean that the work possibly ready for the press was destroyed or is lost somewhere in the ORI&ML building?).

The edition of the complete grammar by T. R. Chintamani published in the Madras University Sanskrit Series no. 11 (1937: http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/52186) has only the text of the s?tra-s, as it is the case of the 1992 ed. of the last (8th) adh. (which adds for each s?tra an useful anvaya giving the s?tr?rtha and a Gujarati commentary by the editor : http://books.google.be/books?id=uICH235KSUMC).

Due to the importance of this post-p??inean work, as stressed on by Louis Renou (?tudes v?diques et p??in?ennes, t. 3, 1957, PICI series no. 4, pp. 121-7) and Robert Birw? (?N?r?ya?a Da??an?tha?s Commentary on Rules III.2, 106-121 of Bhoja?s Sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a?, JAOS 84/2, 1964, pp. 150-162), the completing of the edition of the H?dayah?ri?? v?tti is something hoped.

Here are a few Mss. I hinted :

Alph Index KUML vol. 4, ser. no. 19347-8 = Mss no. C.1846 (complete), with ref. to the ?DCS [of the COL ser. no.] 557?, and Ms. no. 839B; vol. 7, ser. no. 34766-7 = Ms. no. 19827 (complete), and Ms. no. 14758 ; Descr. Cat. Calicut, p. 335-6 no. 591-2 (incompl.) [all mss. in Mal. script on palm leaves]; GOML Alph. Ind. vol. 2, ser. no. 23096 = Ms. R. 4179 Tr. Cat. vol. 4/1/SkrtB, 1928, pp. 6160-2 [transcr. Dev. on paper < Mal. ms. of Kunankulam, incompl. adh. 1-mid 4 ; cf. the complete ms. of the s?tra only described ibid. R. no. 3279 pp. 4880-1, transcr. D on paper < Mal. ms Kottakal] 

Best wishes,

Christophe

> Dear all,
> 
> with the kind help of Lidia Szczepanik (SOAS London) and Jesse Knutson (Hawaii Manoa) I've managed to put together Katsuhiko Kamimura's edition of the little known commentary by Bha??a Narasi?ha on the Sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a. This edition appeared in the 70s scattered in various issues of hard-to-find Japanese journals. It is not even mentioned in Cahill's otherwise impeccable Annotated Bibliography, and I came across it by mere chance. I hope this might be of some interest for the ?la?k?rikas amongst us. It can be downloaded at this Dropbox link.
