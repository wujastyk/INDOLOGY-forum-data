Dear Colleagues,
I have a somewhat delicate question on which I would appreciate your candid opinions.
Imagine a doctoral dissertation in the field of philosophy. ?The primary?audience for this dissertation is other philosophers, most of whom are likely to have little or no expertise in the field of Indology. ?The dissertation does, however, engage quite extensively with Indic philosophical traditions and texts, and does so in a serious and responsible fashion. ?Because the author him or herself is also, however, primarily a philosopher and not an Indologist, s/he does not deploy diacritical marks in presenting Sanskrit terms.
How would such a dissertation be regarded by most of you? ?Would the non-use of diacritical marks alone disqualify this work from being taken seriously? ?(My own reaction: I would personally find it distracting and irritating, but not disqualifying if the scholarship were otherwise sound.) ?Your thoughts?
With thanks in advance,
