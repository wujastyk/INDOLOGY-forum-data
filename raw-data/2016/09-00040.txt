Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks

Dear Jeffery,

In general, regardless of audience, I would feel that it?s acceptable, and sometimes even preferable to do away with diacritic marks and go with commonly observable Roman-script spellings for Sanskrit terms, or Tamil or Arabic or any language X terms for that matter, if these are isolated terms within what is otherwise a complete English sentence (or German or French or any language Y sentence). If you make mistakes in diacritics, for example, it can lead to serious errors, say if you were to make claims about R?ma?s b?la instead of his bala. 

But if one encounters an entire phrase, sentence, or passage that is without diacritics, then trying to read it becomes a total train wreck. 

Just consider what would happen the other way around? 

??? ?? ????? ????-???? ????? ???? ??  ??-?? ?????? ??????, ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?
?????, ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ? ??? ???????? ???? ???, ?? ???? ??? ? ??? ?????, ?? ??? ?????????? ?? ?????? ? 

How?s that for candid? 
cheers,
Adheesh

The primary audience for this dissertation is other philosophers, most of whom are likely to have little or no expertise in the field of Indology.  The dissertation does, however, engage quite extensively with Indic philosophical traditions and texts, and does so in a serious and responsible fashion.  Because the author him or herself is also, however, primarily a philosopher and not an Indologist, s/he does not deploy diacritical marks in presenting Sanskrit terms.

(My own reaction: I would personally find it distracting and irritating, but not disqualifying if the scholarship were otherwise sound.)  Your thoughts?
