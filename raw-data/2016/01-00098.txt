Thank you for these comments. I agree with you regarding the fascinating, arcane nature of the text.

In reading and rereading Thomson?s article, despite its title, I did not get the impression that she claims the text is clearly and simply auto-revelatory, speaking for itself without exigesis. I don?t know if she wrote that title, or if she did, if is sarcastic or earnest.  

Indeed she seems to argue in various ways that the text was prematurely assumed to be comprehended based on unreliable, at times anachronistic interpretations. For example: ?Roberto Calasso vividly portrays the world of the Br?hma?as in Ardor. But he has been misled in one crucial respect: it is not the world of the Rigvedic poets.? Etc.

Nor does Thomson?s goal seem to be to prudishly domesticate the text, but rather to point out what she considers to be gratuitous eroticizing based on dubious translations, in one case of a hapax legomenon. She does not construct a general argument for a sexless RV.

Best wishes,
Howard

This dismissive approach to RV exegesis is astonishing to me.  I have spent my entire career studying the RV, and in my experience of studying  it within the context of the Indo-European Dichtersprache I have found no IE text that is more difficult, or in more need of careful exegesis, than the RV [except perhaps for Old Avestan, or Pindar...].  We can argue about this, but to say that the RV can 'speak for itself' seems to me to be naive, or perhaps full of hubris.

His name itself tells us that he intends to keep his audience in darkness.  We now, some 3000 years later, cannot sit down with him to interrogate him about what meanings stand behind his intentionally dark language.

I take pleasure in examining its riddles.  I also take pleasure in trying to translate it into a poetic and mysterious English.
