With apologies for the cross-posting, I have a quick question. Does anyone know when the first known use of the term ga?apati and vin?yaka occurs in text or inscription, and related to it, when the first visual images of them are found? Do we find a tradition of their worship during or before the Gupta period. With thanks,


Patrick Olivelle
