I am not sure if this is what you are after, but Jeannine Auboyer wrote a few things on thrones and chairs in ancient India. E.g. <http://tufts.worldcat.org/title/trone-et-son-symbolisme-dans-linde-ancienne/oclc/1472925&referer=brief_results>
Le tro?ne et son symbolisme dans l'Inde ancienne<http://tufts.worldcat.org/title/trone-et-son-symbolisme-dans-linde-ancienne/oclc/1472925&referer=brief_results>

Dear list members,

I'm looking for illustrations and plans of Indian Furniture.  Are there any books on Indian Furniture (either of a particular place and time) or a historical overview.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
