Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks
In-Reply-To: <D3F395B8.2CA07%lubint@wlu.edu>
Message-ID: <1D80A509-8E5C-4A98-A88D-0EAD3EBD0AA8@aol.com>

There is also the issue of translation into other languages from English. Lack of diacritics will cause major problems. An example is how the name of the current Indian Prime Minister is rendered in many Tamil publications. He is called ???????? ???? (Nar?ndira M??i)!

They are not that hard for nonspecialists to handle, but provide sufficient information for them to keep track of key terms and names.  It is hard to imagine a dissertation dealing closely with Sanskrit-medium philosophy while dispensing with the tools for representing the language unambiguously.  Jeff, send that dissertation back and have the student make it presentable.

Apart from the dizzying variety of scripts involved in the primary sources, transliteration is a very useful aid for students and other non-specialists.  I recall that even before I learned Sanskrit, I built a repertoire of vocabulary from coursework and reading of secondary sources that allowed my first steps.  Using only Devanagari would please many north Indians, but it would shut out any non-Sanskritist readers in other countries.  And showing word breaks is another useful service.  (A stronger case can of course be made for printing full editions in Devanagari.)

All modern computers can make a decent fist of Devanagari.  So why are we routinely using transliteration at all, any more?  People writing scholarship on Greek or Russian or Armenian don't use Latin script.  Why should we?
