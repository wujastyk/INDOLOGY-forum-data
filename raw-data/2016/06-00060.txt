Dear Colleagues,

I have a doctoral student here who is well on her way in her research on Indian Arabic scientific manuscripts. She is working on the reception of Arabic medical manuscripts (especially those of Najib al-Din al-Samarqandi [d.1222] in the context of Unani medicine in India).) She is going off to India later this summer on a substantial 9-month archival-research grant -- to be affiliated at Delhi University -- to track down the manuscripts in various collections that she knows house them, and is seeking connections to librarians and archivists (or anyone else who can help her get access) whom she could try to connect with by post or email ahead of time, to improve her chances of getting to see the mss she wants while she is there. She is interested in the following institutions:

New Delhi
     Indian Institute of the History of Medicine and Medical Research
     Jamia Hamdard
     Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine - Library

Aligarh
     Aligarh Muslim University - Azad Library
     Ajmal Khan Tibbia College, AMU
     Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences

Rampur
     Raza Library

Patna
     Khuda Bakhsh Library

Calcutta
     Asiatic Society of Bengal
     Buhar Library
     Aliah University - was Calcutta Madrasa

Hyderabad
     Osmania University
     Salar Jung Museum and Library
     Nizamiya Tibbia College and Hospital

Bangalore
     National Institute of Unani Medicine
     Goverment Unani Medical College

I've advised her to get in touch with Anwar Moazzim in Hyderabad for starts. Would any of you have advice on additional contacts or general suggestions for her to pursue? Feel free to reply off-list.

Many thanks for any suggestions!
