> Abstract:
> This monograph is a continuation of the research presented in 'Fire and Cognition in the ?gveda' (2010). The sources which I analyze here are: the late hymns of the ?gveda, the ?philosophical? hymns of the Atharvaveda, cosmogonies of the ?atapatha Br?hma?a and selected parts of the oldest Upani?ads, composed before the Buddha (B?had?ra?yaka, Ch?ndogya,  Aitareya,  Taittir?ya and Kau??taki). The basic claims of the research are as follows. Firstly, the composers of these texts continue the metaphysical assumptions of the ?gveda, according to which fire is the metaphysical principle  underlying  reality. This continuity is expressed not only in the exegesis expressed in the texts, but also in the ritual practice which is presented in detail in the ?atapatha Br?hma?a.  Secondly, the diachronic approach allows me to track how the thought changed, how new concepts and theories appear and develop. It also allows me to propose  possible reasons for these changes. Thirdly, my approach allows me to reconstruct the belief in rebirth which is presented in these texts. As in my previous book, my tools are traditional philology and cognitive linguistics, because the features of these texts are similar to the ?gveda and their explicit form is difficult to comprehend, especially as far as the philosophical content is concerned. The early Indian texts open the way to the beginnings of  human philosophical thinking and show that abstract and general thinking can be created in the oral tradition.
