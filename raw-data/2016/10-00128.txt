Dear Dr. Rosati,

Can you elaborate as to what the somatic traits of Tribals are?

Thanks

I think your question is interesting.

Or, was it possible that the 'officers' were k?atriyas and the 'foot soldiers' were perhaps of a different caste, i.e. enslaved ?udras forced to fight? Is there any discussion of the militiary organisation according to ranks, size  and hierarchy similar to the table below?
