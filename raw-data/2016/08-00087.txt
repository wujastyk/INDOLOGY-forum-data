My very subjective impression, gained after ten seconds of intense scrutiny
:-), is that this snakes and ladders painting is modern, perhaps late 20th
century.  It's an indefinable impression based on the loose script,
colours, and lax work on brush and pen strokes.  I may be wrong!  About the
tilaka, I don't know.
