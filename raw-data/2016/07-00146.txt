Dear Indology Colleages,

     As you can see from the attached extract of the Sanskrit Introduction
to the 1864 pothi print edition of Ve?ka??dhvarin's Lak?m?sahasra,
evidently, while the great Appayya D?k?ita was mainly a ?aiva Advaitin
vehemently attacking especially the M?dhva Vai??avas in his
Madhvatantramukhamardana, his son Raghun?tha D?k?ita and grandson
Ve?ka??dhvarin were Vai??avas.  Among his later descendants we have ?aiva
scholars like N?laka??ha D?k?ita.  How did these ?aiva and Vai??ava
affiliations develop within this one and the same family?  If anyone knows
sources for the family history of Appayya D?k?ita and his lineage, I would
very much appreciate to know those sources.  Thanks for your assistance.
