Subject: Web page again: new URL
Message-ID: <161227020223.23782.2052447106733144904.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A URL for inclusion in the very useful Indology WEB page:

http://metro.turnpike.net/S/spaoli/index.html

This page is part of the WWW Virtual Library.

>If you have a URL you think should be included, let me know.  My aim is
>to make the tree of INDOLOGY's other URL's have as steep a gradient as
>possible.  That's not very clear is it.  What I mean is that as few URLs
>should point to as many useful services as possible: the thing should
>branch out sharply.
