re my request of 19 september on a translation of Shankara's 

We learnt 
from Europe's leading bookshop on Asean litterature Otto 
Harrassowitz in 
Wiesbaden-Germany that A.G. Krishna Warner's book 
(Ramakrishna Math, Madras 
1983) is out of print and is no longer on the 
second hand market. Could 
anyone put us in touch with a bookseller 
(i.e.provide us with name and 
address on E-mail??) who would still stock it, 
first or second hand? We 
have a rather urgent need for it.
Many thanks 
ahead.

Note added on 
October 10,1995:
Is there perhaps any chance of borrowing it from a library? 
Please inform undersigned of conditions of loan of books to Europe/Belgium

Many Thanks ahead
Leofacq
