SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION
FOR
SOUTH ASIA RESEARCH

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

The latest issue of SOUTH ASIA RESEARCH (Vol. 15 No 2) is now available.  
This announcement provides information about the contents of this issue 
and how to subscribe to the journal.

SOUTH ASIA RESEARCH is an interdisciplinary journal that is concerned 
with the history, ecology, anthropology, architecture, languages, 
literatures, legal systems, religions and visual arts of South Asia (the 
Indian subcontinent). It was established at the School for Oriental and 
African Studies in London in 1980 and is published twice a year, in May 
and November. The primary aim is to give rapid access to current 
research work, and on occasion the journal publishes the work of 
promising research students as well as established scholars.  Special 
issues have also been devoted to particular conferences and workshops in 
the past.  In addition to four articles per issue, plus conference 
reports and book reviews, the journal aims to publish interpretive 
essays that discuss in a more general manner the issues and problems 
that arise from research on South Asia.
