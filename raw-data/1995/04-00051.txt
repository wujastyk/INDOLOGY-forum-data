Here is my answer:
(1) Yes, you are correct.
(2) In general in the north it is 'pUrNimAnta' (full moon ending)
    and in the south it is 'anAnta' (new moon ending).
(3) In 1991 I made a field research correcting about 50 kinds of
    pancAngas (traditional calendar).  I am preparing a rough report
    of my survey.
(4) Difference of month names occurs only in kRSNapakSa, and there is
    no variation in zuklapakSa, as Dominik said.
