Dear Lance,

I would want to know the size of the files before committing, but I
think it would certainly be possible and very appropriate to mount a
copy at the INDOLOGY Web/gopher/ftp site.  This would be a splendid
addition to the growing library of files already there.

Perhaps you could keep me informed about developments, and the actual
availability of the files.
