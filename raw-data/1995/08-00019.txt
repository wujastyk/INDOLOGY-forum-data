Please include the Nalayira Divya Prabandham page on the
Indology home page, somewhere in the Electronic Texts
section (or similar). The Nalayira Divya Prabandham is
a Tamil corpus of hymns composed by saints known as the
AlvArs sometime between the 6th and 9th centuries A.D.
They are reckoned as scripture by significant numbers
of people in the Tamil country, and have had a significant
impact on Indian culture (being the first representatives
of emotional bhakti).
