Well, those are UN figures! $360 => ~Rs11,160. There are many, many Indians
who 'live by' with that kind of money the 'whole' year -it is true, really.
The standard of such 'living' is obviously vastly different from  those  in
'rich' countries.

There is another scale (also from the UN) which uses the 'buying power'  of
the people of a country (correcting for currency exchange rates)  - in that
scale the per capita GDP (buying power index) of India is higher than $360.
