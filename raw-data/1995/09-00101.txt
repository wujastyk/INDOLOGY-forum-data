Subject: SOFTWARE FOR DEVANAGARI AND ROMANIZED SANSKRIT

I'm sure this is well-worn territory on this list, but on the
other hand computer software changes so rapidly that one season's
recommendations may not apply when the same old questions get
asked in the next.

My question is about the availability of Windows or DOS-based
software for sanskrit text. In particular are there programs
which convert devanagari to romanized (though probably not
vice versa)?  Basically, however, I would much appreciate
hearing from anybody with strong recommendations for a
particular package.
