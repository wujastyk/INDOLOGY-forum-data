Don't the philosophies of jainism and buddhism fall into the category of 
"shramanic" philosophies, whereas as vedic hinduism falls into the 
category of "brahmanic"?

Did not the vedic vipras/brahmanas have trouble with the shramanic 
ascetics in their refusal to honor the brahmanic yajnas, etc?

It seems that strains of jainism and buddhism were prevalent, including 
mentions of tirthankars and boddhisatvas, during the early vedic age.
