Dear Mr Thrasher,

The work is referenced in Datta and Singh, "History of Hindu
mathematics", Asia Publishing house, Bombay, 1962. The book gives a
description of the Katapayadi scheme supposedly from a work called
Sadratnamala, which J.F.Fleet's article quotes from a paper of Whish
(1827), as of unspecified source.

Unfortunately I had returned my copy of the Datta and Singh book which
was on interloan, but have re-requested it, so I should be able to
give more information soon.
