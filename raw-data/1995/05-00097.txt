Subject: Summer Sanskrit at Harvard 

Since I got several inquiries regarding our offering of Introductory 
Sanskrit this summer, -- taught here since 1988 --I repeat the most 
important items for those still interested to join us or those who could 
not find an opportunity elsewhere.

  SANS S-101 Elementary Sanskrit  (30221)

  (June 26 - August 10; exam period Aug. 15-18)

  This course, equivalent to two semesters of course work, will 
  enable students to acquire the basic reading skills in Sanskrit. Stress
  will be placed on learning the Devanagari script, basic grammar and

  translation of passages from simple narrative literature to the epics.
