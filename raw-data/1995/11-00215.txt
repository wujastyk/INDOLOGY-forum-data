Please note: when your
email address is about
to change, you need to
resign from INDOLOGY       (send "unsub indology" to "listserv at liverpool.ac.uk")
first from your old
address, and then
re-join                    ("sub indology Your Name" to listserv...)
from the new one.

The LISTSERV software looks at your incoming email headers to work out
details of who you are, and how to get email back to you.  These details
are normally constructed automatically by your email software.
