Subject: BRAHMAN AND BRAHMIN

          Re: Brahmins and Brahmans. 
           
          Yule  and  Burnell's classic "Hobson-Jobson" cites  the  spelling 
          Brahmins  from  William  Cureton's  Spicilegium  Sacrum  Syriacum 
          (1855).  Greek  and  as  far  as  I  know  Latin retain the  "a": 
          Brakhmanoi, Brahmani.  A citation that may indicate the source of 
          the  "i"  is  Marco  Polo,  who  has  as  a  plural Abraiaman  or 
          Abraiamin, "which  seems  to represent an incorrect Arabic plural 
          (e.g. Abrahamin) picked  up  from  Arabic  sailors;  the  correct 
          Arabic plural is Barahima.  Camoes, Lusiades, 1572 has Brahmenes. 
          Another Portuguese, Acosta, Tractado de las Drogas y Medecinas de 
          las Indias Orientales, 1578,  has Bragmen.  I  wonder  if English 
          got  the  "i"  from Portuguese or  Arabic.   Modern  French  (and 
          Portuguese) have  "a."  Is  there  any Middle Indo-Aryan language 
          where the  "a"  has become "i"  or "e?"  Any Dravidian?  Time  to 
          consult the new unabridged OED.
