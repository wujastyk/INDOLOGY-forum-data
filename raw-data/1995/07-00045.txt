 .r .r .th .d .dh .n .m .s
and similarly for visarga .h
that palatals include ~n and "s
What about representing the overdots of 
the gutteral n 
the anusvaara (both the dot over the m and the dot resting inside a little
half-circle cupping the dot from below)? am I forgetting any other  relevant
instances here?
thank you.
