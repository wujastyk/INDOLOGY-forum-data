Actually, the optimism among
Indian businesspeople/investors
has very little to do with the
attitudes/opinions of foreign
observers.  The "bullishness"
(hopefully, not foolishness   :-)  )
started way back in the '80s,
long before the days of economic
liberalization.

As an aside: despondency among foreign
businesspeople doesn't always
correlate positively with economic 
ill-health.  American companies moan 
constantly about the impossibility of 
getting a fair deal from Japan, yet the 
Japanese economy has thrived.

'Nuff said on my part.  25 years
from now, when some of you Indologists
are writing books/articles about
"India's Economic Revolution",
just remember -- I told you about
it first, 25 years ago.  Cite me.  :-)  :-)

Regards,


Narayan Sriranga Raja.
