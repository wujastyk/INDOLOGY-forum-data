Thank you for contributing some human humor! The discussion was very dry indeed.
I also enjoyed the cocktail party joke. Anything wrong with being less serious?
Is it necessary that the academic world is dry and inaccessible?  What about a
lush garden with juicy plants and beautiful flowers? Errare humanum est, and
smiling too is human.
Thank you for all your wonderful and honest contributions.
