Subject: saMsAra = Reincarnation?
Message-ID: <161227018532.23782.11165275388394228490.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

It seems to me that words like jaati, janman, etc., even without the punar, 
are in fact the equivalent, or "correct translation," of English 
"reincarnation", and are so used, at least in Sanskrit.  Etymologically they 
mean just 'birth' or 'incarnation', 
but since all incarnation is reincarnation, it comes to the same thing.
