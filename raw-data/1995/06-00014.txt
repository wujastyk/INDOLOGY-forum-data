Peter J. Claus (pclaus at csuhayward.edu) asked about information about 
the Solar and the Lunar dynasties, in relation with the Gollas (cowherders).

1. As you probably know, Golla is derived from Sanskrit  "Gopaala".

  gopaala > govaala > gollaa (south), gvaala (north) etc.

Once a region of North Indian was called "Golla country" because of the 
cowherder community.

2. The cowherders claim to be descendents of the Yadavas, an ancient
Kshatriya clan (Krishna was born in the Andhaka-VrishNi branch of the Yadava 
clan). There is some discussion in "Tribes and Castes of the Central 
Provinces of India" by R.V. Russel and Hiralal about the difference between 
Ahir (Abhir) and Gopa.

I wonder what is Peter's hypotheis about the connection between Gollas
and the Lunar/Solar clans.

3. Charts showing branches of Lunar and Solar clans are available in several
books.
