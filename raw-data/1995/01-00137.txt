According to J. Ojihara's Japanese translation of Su\"sruta,
there are two possibilities for tagara:
Podophyllum Emodi, Wall. 
Tabernaemontana coronaria, Br.

tagara is attested in Su\"sruta, 1.14.22; 1.38[11]; 3.10.40; 4.3.58;
4.4.22; 4.5.6; 4.15.28; 4.39.2; 5.1.51; 5.2.52; 5.5.64,77; 5.7.7,12;
5.8.47,50 (numbers are from from Ojihara's translation and slightly
different from those in the text which Domink uses).  

It is advisable to check all these occurences.

According to `Glossary of Vegetable Drugs in B.rhattrayii' by
K.C.Chunekar, Chowkhamba Sanskrit Studies Vol.XXXVII 1972,
<tagara> is `Valeria wallichii, DC' and its synonyms are
kaalaanusaarya, ku.tila, nata and vakra. 

In this book all the occurence of the three great medical
books are listed.
