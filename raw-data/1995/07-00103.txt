Abstract:

     Anger is the most powerful of the //kle"sas// that not only
"plant seeds" for suffering but also "cut the roots of virtue" for
periods of up to a thousand aeons per instance. This article
examines and assesses the exegesis by Tsongkhapa, founder of the
Tibetan Gelukba order, of Indian sources on the topic of anger. It
argues that despite Tsongkhapa's many careful qualifications he may
not be successful in avoiding the conclusion that if the suutras
are to be accepted literally, there almost certainly will be
persons for whom liberation from sa.msaara is precluded.
