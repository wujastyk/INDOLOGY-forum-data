Subject: sci.astro.archaeo: Proposed Newsgroup/Mailing List
Message-ID: <161227020989.23782.15835131870822365306.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Dear Will,
	Thank you for your proposal - I for one am interested in 
subscribing to your proposed mailing list and/or newsgroup, though I cannot 
make practical suggestions on  how you should proceed. I have been working 
for the past 30 years on problems posed by the script and religion 
of the Indus Civilization, and I see astronomy as having a very important 
role at this early stage of Indian culture. For a summary of my 
findings, with a separate chapter on the astronomical and astrological 
background (and a stellar map, bibliography, etc.), see my recent book, 
"Deciphering the Indus Script", Cambridge University Press, 1994, xxii + 374 pp.
	Yours, Asko
