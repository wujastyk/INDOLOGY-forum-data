PRICE:  $40.  ("I contribute the net proceeds to a student assistance
        fund.")
OPERATING SYSTEM:  Mac.
COMMENT:  "Avanti was made by me in 1985 (slightly improved in 1988)
        for dot-matrix printers; it is a considerably improved version
        of what George Hart (Univ. of California, Berkeley) had
        accomplished.  A logical assignment of Nagari letters to the
        Roman keyboard, one that speeds up typing and learning, is my
        other main contribution.  That the font prints well even on
        laser printers is something that still surprises me.  It is,
        for example, the type used for Devanagari text matter in my
        book *Sanskrit: an Easy Introduction to an Enchanting
        Language*.  The diskette also includes the Roman fonts "Ganga"
        and "Sindhu" which can be used for transliteration of most
        literary languages of South Asia" (--Author).

        layout files for the system folder, which extensively redefine
        the system of dead keys.  This is particularly important for

COMMENT:  "A Truetype font.  The package contains extensive
        documentation and a large number of conjunct forms and a few
        dingbats; also a bit-mapped version.  It has a very large set,
        so many of the characters are only availible through deadkey
        combinations.  The real strength of the script is its
        orientation towords DTP applications that revolve around
        traditional Hindustani musical notation" (--Author).

OPERATING SYSTEM:  Postscript and truetype versions of Nagari and
        Roman diacritics fonts for Macintosh.  The Nagari "Madhushree"
        font works for Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi.  "Mandakini" works
        for Sanskrit and Hindi, and can do all the dotted letters used
        to transcribe Urdu sounds.  The Roman diacritics font,
        "Manjushree-CSX," follows the CSX coding, but has a lot more
        diacritics.
COMMENT:  "The print quality of the Devanagari fonts approximates the
        typography of Nirnayasagara press.  The Manjushree-CSX font
        looks like Times-Roman.  All three fonts are of the best
        publishing quality if used with a high resolution laser
        printer" (--Author).

        freedom for use across platforms and applications.
PRICE:  The price of the 1,516 type fonts on a CD-ROM disk with full
        written instructions is only $125 plus $5 for shipping and
        handling.  Until May 1, 1995, the price will be $100 plus $5
        for shipping and handling.  Visa and Mastercard are accepted.
COMMENT:  "The keyboard layouts for these fonts follow the ISCII
        (Indian Script Code for Information Exchange) standard.  1,516
        fonts are included in the package:  758 TrueType fonts and 758
        PostScript Type 1 fonts, which support the computing and
        writing systems for over 25 languages of South Asia"  (--
        Author).
                "I have, after careful checking, found more
        unsurmountable problems.  It has problems with individual
        fonts, keyboard mapping to the most familiar IBM/Qwerty
        standard format, lack of support and pertinent documentation
        vis-a-vis hardware compatibility, unprofessional designing of
        some of the individual fonts.  I have downgraded my earlier
        product grade to C-"  (--Sid Harth <BAKULA at delphi.com>).
                "Also, the fonts have the vowel diacritics written
        together with the consonants, which makes it a real doozie to
        type, unless one sets up an extended and complicated series of
        macros.  Another problem is that the coding for the font
        titles is not really spelled out...all come up as Truetype on
        the icon, but sometimes come up PostScript in reality. It is
        much easier to use the Ecolinguistics fonts, though they are
        much more costly.  On the other hand, these include TrueType
        Tamil, which I haven't found elsewhere, and Malayalam.  They
        are also very nice in appearance...at least the ones that I
        accessed" (--Jim Gair <jwg2 at cornell.edu>).

COMMENT:  "The fonts are ok, but there is no keyboard--you have to
        devise your own.  And there is no allowance for the
        conjunctions and triple conjuctions so common in South Indian
        languages like Kannada.  The people are nice; but the price
        (around $90) is too much, and the effort is not worth it" (--
