          Re: Usefulness of commercial  or non-critical editions  of  South 
          Asia texts 
           
          How  useful  are commercial, non-critical, or  minimally critical 
          editions to constituting a critical text?  Have you used them  in 
          your work?  Is  it desirable to examine every edition?  Are  they 
          useful attestations of  regional  textual traditions?   Do  other 
          scholars  in  their  sentiments  and  practice  agree  with  your 
          responses?  Are there other questions that should be raised about 
          this matter?
