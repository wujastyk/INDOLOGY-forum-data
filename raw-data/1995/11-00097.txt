I might be able to help.  The verse happens to be among those on a set of two 
audio casettes _Sounds of Tantra_ by Harish Johari.  This would probably be a 
good source for your acquaintance, since not only the correct pronunciation, 
but also the intonation are demonstrated. The caseetes are from Destiny 
Recordings One Park Street, Rochester, N.Y. 05767.

In an accompanying book by Johari _Tools for Tantra_ , Destiny Books, 1986
on page 43. the mantra, which Johari calls the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra, is 
written exactly as follows:

AUM TRIYAMBAKAM YAJA MAHE
SUGANDHIM PUSHTHI VARDHANAM
URVARUK MIV BANDHANANI
MRITYOR MUKSHIYE MAMRITAT

[capitals in cited work]
Johari goes on to summarize its import (though not its semantic or 
grammatical meaning).  

"Ths powerful mantra of Siva the Rudra removes physical, mental and celestial 
ailments.  Like Gayatri this is an all-purpose mantra . . . Mahamrityunjaya 
Mantra is supposed to give victory over death, suffering and disease.  It 
removes obstacles, creates a suitable environment and brngs happiness to 
life." (p. 43).

I hope this will be somewhat helpful.

Cheers,
