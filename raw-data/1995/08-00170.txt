Greeting Indology list members. I am a philosopher teaching Nietzsche's
_Daybreak_ this fall, and I'm wondering about a quotation from the Rig
Veda that Nietzsche uses at the very beginning of his book. "There are
so many days that have not yet broken." What is the context? What are
some of the interpretations of the line? Where is it?  I hope the list
members don't mind being asked what may bea very stupid question from a
non-Indologist, but I thought you people would give me the best and
quickest answer. Randy Groves, Associate Professor of Humanities, Ferris
