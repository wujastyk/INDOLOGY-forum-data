Many advaita works utilize a stock metaphor of a sphaTika crystal appearing
colored because of being viewed through a colored gem. By itself the sphaTika
is clear, but falsely attributing the color of the other gemstone to it, is
described as an error of perception. I am not aware if the example is used by
Sankara or sureSvara, however.
