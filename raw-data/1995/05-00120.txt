---------- Forwarded message ----------

For those intersted in the new 
Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies 

          
The second issue is available on request and also available on WWW now, at 
Milano:


        http://www.arcadia.polimi.it /~ejvslist/ 
      = http://131.175.62.190/~ejvslist/


To simplify matters we have now shifted the whole operation to Milano.

The new address is:

              ejvs-list at arcadiax1.arcadia.polimi.it . 

If you have technical problems or if a prospective new member wants to 
register please write to:

              majordomo at arcadiax1.arcadia.polimi.it


For general information just send the message:    help
to  majordomo at arcadiax1.arcadia.polimi.it, and the machine will send you 
some standard information.

New subscribers should send the following message:

                     subscribe ejvs-list

to:         majordomo at arcadiax1.arcadia.polimi.it.

They will then receive a welcome message to show that they are subscribed.

I thank Dr. L. Magnocavallo for all of his assistance with regard to this 
change and for his designing and maintaining our homepages as well!


I will shut down EJVS-list at husc.harvard.edu  as of now. But for a while,  
EJVS-LIST at husc will send you error messages etc. if you attempt to  
contact the old address.

You can always reach me at my private address: witzel at husc3.harvard.edu 
for any questions.

Thanks for your interest!
