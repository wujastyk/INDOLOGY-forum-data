I've got an unneeded copy of Pt. Shridharshastri Pathak's Word Index
to Patanjali's Vyakharana-Mahabhasya (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute, 1927. Government Oriental Series Class C, No. 1),
1150 pages, intact, well-bound, but a bit brittle. If anyone wants and
has something nice to offer on exchange, contact me soon at
magier at columbia.edu.
