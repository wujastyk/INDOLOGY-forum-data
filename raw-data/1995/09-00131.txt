LECTURER IN SANSKRIT AND CLASSICAL INDIAN STUDIES
OR BUDDHISM

The Department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas at Austin has an
opening for a lecturer in Sanskrit and Classical Indian Studies, including
Indian Buddhism, beginning January 1996.  The successful candidate should
have either completed the Ph.D. (ABDs who are close to completing their
dissertation will be considered) and be able to teach first through third
year Sanskrit, as well as undergraduate courses on aspects of classical
Indian culture, such as religion, philosophy, and literature.  Teaching
experience and ability at the undergraduate level is highly desirable.
Although initially the appointment is for Spring 1996, we expect that it
will continue to be funded for the next three years.  Candidates should
send their resumes to Professor Patrick Olivelle, Chair, Department of
Asian Studies, WCH 4.134, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712.  He can be
reached by phone (512) 471-5811 or by e-mail:  jpo at uts.cc.utexas.edu
