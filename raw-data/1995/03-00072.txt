#Further to Purushottam's posting I would like to point out the reasons for
#some of the problems with Indian Studies/Devabhasa/Hindi et all - atleast in
#the Sydney context, but this might well apply to all of Australia, about
#that I am not sure.
#
#Though Indian studies, and Indian history has been toaught in Sydney uni for
#a number of years, the community which it is supposed to represent - the
#Indians and other south asians have never been brought in, nothing has been
#marketed to them as "their" cultural teaching center etc. What that means is
#that they are mostly unaware of the existence of these courses. Take the
#example fo the Indian students group called "Asoka" of the University of
#Sydney. apparently their office bearers approached the Uni authorities last
#year, but were completely unaware of teh existence of the courses that teach
#Indian languages and culture (as these students predominantly come from the
#science streams, it is not a surprise), and as a result we have lost out on
#100s of potential customers. 
#
#I would squarely put the blame at the doorstep of us academics who live in
#our ivory towers, and expect to be funded by a government who cannot see
#votes in it due to lack of community participation.
