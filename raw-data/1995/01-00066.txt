Dear  Dr. Wujast,
 
   I generally agreed with your points. As I'm new to this list (and enjoy it
quite a bit), let me please mention a little addition to your article,
especially for the new-ones (like me):

Posting questions, asking for infos, addresses or persons is fine, but is
not ALWAYS necessary, IMO, to answer them via the list. Sometimes it is 
sufficiant to reply personally to the sender...

is that ok?


Johannes
