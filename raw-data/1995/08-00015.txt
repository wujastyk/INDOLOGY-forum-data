The only expert I know (and I'm sure there are others) is Julia Leslie.  
See her book _The Perfect Wife_. Somewhere in there, I'm positive, but 
I've forgotten the exact page number, she mentions specifically the idea 
that it was permissible for women to have intercourse during pregnancy. 
And that's not her own idea. She's quoting from South Indian Sanskrit 
sources. It's a very interesting book.

Best,
Bob Hueckstedt
