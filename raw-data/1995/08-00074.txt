I don't know if the example of SOPHIA as intentional or not or whether 
list members are aware that the journal is crosscultural philosophy of 
religion  by the name of SOPHIA (which it has my dawa to edit) has been 
released on Netspace on a home-page Web as from the current 100th issue.  
This issue celebrates pluralism and it carries articles by Bimal Matilal, 
Ninian Smart, Tu-Wei Ming, 
Max Charlesworth, julia Ching and yours truly (or Karma and the Problem 
of Evil), etc. There is quite a feast. For sneak-preview (actually free 
accessfor this trial run) in Netspace GO TO: type the following:
