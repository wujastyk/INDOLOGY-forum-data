As to the first part ofthe query, I think the answer is Sanskrit pAtra 
'drinking vessel, vessel in general', for it also means 'a receptacle, a 
recipient or a person in whom any quality is contained: a fit or 
competent or worthy person oor man, a person or man worthy to receive 
gifts; fit for; a recipient or subject also of curses, blame, etc.' and 
'an actor, dramatis persona'. These meanings are also found in Kannada 
(the above was cited from Kittel's Kannada-English dict.), Tamil 
(pAttiram), etc. ---
