Subject: Mac CS/CSX fonts??
Message-ID: <161227020976.23782.16174840426575278948.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Are there any Mac fonts out there in the public domain that are CS/CSX
encoded? I have the WNRI fonts, the Bitstream Charter fonts, and a new
set of CS/CSX outline fonts based on the Arial and Times NewRoman fonts,
but I am having some troubles getting these into Mac format (the basic
problem is that most converters are too smart, and so they know that an
IBM ANSI 224 is really an A-acute and hence remap it to the Mac standard
encoding for A-acute, which is  231. Hence all of the codepoints get 
changed around and presto! no more CS encoding. Sigh. I think I know what 
the problem is, but I wouldn't mind simply not dealing with it if some 
fonts already exist. . .
