Subject: Where is Mount Mujava(n)t?
Message-ID: <161227020164.23782.16893774001879387917.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Can someone throw some light on the location
of the Mount Mujavant referred to in the 
vedic tradition? Is this referred to in any
other literary texts or texts of ancient geography?

Thanks.
