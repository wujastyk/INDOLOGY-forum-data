Glad to hear that the journal is out.

It would probably be a good idea to relay the message to the following ng
address:

third-world-women at jefferson.village.virginia.edu.

To subscribe, email Radhika Gajjala at <gajjala+ at pitt.edu>.

The input of third world women would be helpful. And interesting too.
