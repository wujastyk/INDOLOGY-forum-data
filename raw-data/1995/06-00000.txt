Subject: Does Claudius Nenninger have e-mail?
Message-ID: <161227019591.23782.11907886734512471556.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Does Claudius Nenninger in Hamburg have a personal e-mail-address, would it
be reasonable to send e-mail for him to somebody else in Hamburg, or should
I just sit down to write him a letter?
