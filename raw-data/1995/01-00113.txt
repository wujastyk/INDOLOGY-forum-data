Subject: Tamil dictionary dispute

Dear Dr Wujastyk,

I don't want to kick off a debate on the judicial system in India, but I
have no experience with "the normal way with Indian courts".  I am convinced
though that utmost professionalism/expertise prevails at the Madras High
Court.  Copyright is an entirely legal concept and can therefore be resolved
only in a court and not on a discussion list. The question is whether such a
dictionary dispute belongs in a court at all, or whether the issue of
copyright should have been raised by Mr Ramakrishnan. Otherwise I am also of
your opinion, that the dispute should be settled amicably.

To my knowledge, the IITS Cologne, has always tried to cooperate with other
institutions, whether that institution was a private trust like MOZHI or a
commercial outfit like CreA publishers.
