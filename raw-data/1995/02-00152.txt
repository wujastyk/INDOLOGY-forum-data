     In one of his postings, Mr. Kichenassamy asserted that "there is no 
     contestation of the fact that Tamil and Sanskrit are unrelated (see 
     Burrow and Emeneau's dictionary)". Now there is a contestation. I have 
     demonstrated that about 4,000 of the so-called 5,000 Dravidian etyma 
     in the Burrow and Emeneau's dictionary have no reason to exist 
     independendently of their so-called Aryan counter-part etyma. In fact, 
     they coalesce into the 12,500 etyma of the so-called Indo-Aryan and 
     Santali/Mundarica/Sora languages. My theses are simple: (1) South Asia 
     was a linguistic area which had a lingua franca, bhaaSaa circa 2500 BC 
     (the date of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization), from which the 
     so-called aryan-dravidian-munda streams emanated; (2) semantic 
     structures are deeper than the surface grammatical structures in 
     neural networks used for language evolution and expansion.

Re: South Asian languages (25+): a multi-language, etymological dictionary on CD-ROM; 
Author: Dr. S. Kalyanaraman  (After 1 March 1995:) 20/7 Warren Road, Mylapore, Madras 600004; Tel. 91-44-493-6288; Fax. 91-44-499-6380

The monumental work is 2,500 pages in fine print. It  has 8,000 head semantic-clusters which            encompass over 1.5 million  words. [Thus over 4000 headword of Burrow and Emeneau's 
Dravidian  etyma coalesce into over 12,000 headwords of Turner's Indo-Aryan etyma 
and hundreds of Santali/Mundari/Sora lexemes to generate a semantic 
super-set of Vaak or Sarasvati or Braahmi which may be appropriate 
appellations for the ancient South Asian lingua franca.]

The work was prepared on WordPerfect 5.1 and occupied 25MB of disk space. 
I do not know the publisher's price for the CD-ROM. This  work which marks a change of
paradigm in South Asian language studies, will  be of interest to the indology group;
