Hi,

I am trying to track down an old friend of mine who did her Ph D from Deccan
College Pune. Her name is Sudeshna Guha. When I last spoke to her, I was
rather sick, and was unable to retain the name of her husband, but I do
remember that she had married a Sanskritist in U K. 

Would someone out there know her whreabouts, and an e-mail address for her ?
Thanking everyone in advance


Ta
