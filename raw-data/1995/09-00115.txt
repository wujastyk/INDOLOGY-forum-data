We learnt from Europe's leading bookshop on Asean litterature Otto 
Harrassowitz in Wiesbaden-Germany that A.G. Krishna Warner's book 
(Ramakrishna Math, Madras 1983) is out of print and is no longer on the 
second hand market. Could anyone put us in touch with a bookseller 
(i.e.provide us with name and address on E-mail??) who would still stock it, 
first or second hand? We have a rather urgent need for it.
Many thanks 
ahead.
