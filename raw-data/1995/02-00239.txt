This still seems to me to be a great misunderstanding on the side of those
who deny the AIT.  As far as I know, none of the historical philologists
means by coming from the west coming from West Europe. The Aryans are
thought to have come from some place west of India but east of West Europe,
therefore it is quite logical that the Teutonic myths refer to coming from
the east.
