     I have, after careful checking, found more unsurmountable problems. I
have written to the publishers. I received a phone call from them while I
was away. At this stage I would recommend the Indology members to exercise
patience. Like any other much touted software launches, this may have more
than a few bugs. I have downgraded my earlier product grade from A+ to C-.
