The Asian Studies Centre's web page has a new address. I hope those of 
you who have been kind enough to link with us will update your file. The 
new address is:
	http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/asian_studies

I sent this message last week, but just got a message saying that it had 
been damaged during transmission. If you received this before, please 
swiftly delete.

Best,
