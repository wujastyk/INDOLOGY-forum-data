I am moderating a little electronic discussion group dealing with the 
issues related to the use of computer in the oriental studies in 
general (this discussion group has just been created this month in a 
Japanese commercial BBS named "NiftyServe").  There, I talked about 
this thread yesterday -- and a friend of mine replied today saying 
that a free application which makes an index of the words of sanskrit 
texts exists in Japan.  According to his posting, this application 
makes a sorted index of words, and supports several transliteration 
systems, among which that of the Kyoto University and Harvard 
University (KH system).  An example of the result:
            [a]
a(2) [3] 11 21
akAGkSaM(1) [3] 17
akSa(1) [3] 22
akSa..pAda.upadiSTam(1) [3] 22
agni(1) [2] 21
agni..hotraM(1) [2] 21
aGga(2) [3] 10 [4] 5*

Numeral in parenthesis = frequency
numeral in square brackets = page
other numeral = line

This application was created for a particular type of personal 
computers popular in Japan (NEC 9800 series), but must work also in 
DOS machines in general (but the author, Mr. Mitsuyuki Shimizu, is not
 sure on this point, according to my friend).

I myself am a Mac user and have never used this application (moreover,
 I have no special knowledge on the computer science...).  But anyway,
 I am going to write to our discussion group to say that this kind of 
software is needed by the international community of indologists (and 
buddhologists, etc.) and should be made available from anywhere in the
 world (currently, this application is available only in one Japanese 
commercial BBS named "PC-VAN").

Best wishes.

P.S.  I visited the new INDOLOGY Web page and I find it really 
excellent.  Thank you very much!
