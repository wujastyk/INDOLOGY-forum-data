Dear List searvers

I would like some of your inputs and arguments on beginign of life.  When 
does the life begin?  What do you think about abortion? Untill what time 
abortion does not kill a live person? 

Any related responses welcom!

Thank you for your time and thoughts,
please send answers to me personally, since I am not on the list
