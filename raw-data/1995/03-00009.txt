>From the first palmleaf manuscript UVS located for Kurinjip pATTu,
few lines in the list of flowers were missing. UVS wondered how many
flowers might have been lost due to the effects of time. UVS searched hard
to find the missing lines and when found it was only three flower
names. He was deeply satisfied to find the entire text intact.
This incident is captivatingly narrated in his autobiography.
The chapter's title is "mUnRu pUkkal" - Three flowers. (nalluraik kOvai)
