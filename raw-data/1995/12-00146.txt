I am happy to announce that as of Dec. 14, 1995 my work on an electronic 
version of the Sanskrit-German Dictionary by Klaus Mylius has reached the 
point where I shall have to stop. The publisher does not allow me to put 
PESCHMYL ("Peter Schreiner's Mylius") on a server for general access but 
wants everybody who gets a copy to sign a statement concerning the 
non-commercial, private use for research purpose.
I shall have to experiment with this situation and ask those colleagues 
who want a copy under this condition to send a message to 
PESCH at INDOGER.UNIZH.CH
Any advice as to how to deal with this situation is welcome. I have no 
commercial interest in the matter and shun any administrative hassle. 
Klaus Mylius has agreed to making the files freely accessible to the 
academic community; yet I do not want to be sued by 'Langenscheidt'.

Merry Christmas to those who enjoy to celebrate it and a Happy New Year 
to everybody.

Peter Schreiner
