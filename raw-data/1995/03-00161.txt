I second Daud's statement.  Based on my reading of the foreword, I 
agree that Elst's book carries a very strong political statement, as does 
VOI's unfortunate choice of the Indology list as a potentially receptive 
audience.  And while I am not one who feels that politics should 
necessarily be kept out of a forum on pre-modern South Asia (is any 
discussion apolitical, in any case?), I understand and defer to the 
consensus of the list members who feel that political debate belongs 
elsewhere.  That said, VOI and Dr. Elst should be made aware that this is 
not the place for the promotion of any work whose purpose is the 
advancement of a particular political agenda.
