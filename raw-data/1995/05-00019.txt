Here are some bibliographic references to Sanskrit in Indonesian:

Jan Gonda (1971). The influence of Indian languages. Current Trends in
Linguistics 8, Linguistics in Oceania. The Hague, Mouton.  Current Trends
in Linguistics 8, Linguistics in Oceania. 955-968 955-968. 955-968.

Jan Gonda (1973). Sanskrit in Indonesia. New Delhi, International Academy
of Indian Culture. Sata-pi aka Series; Indo-Asian Literatures. 2 ed.. Vol.
99.

Harry Spitzhardt (1973). "The Lexical and Morphological Impact of Sanskrit
on Moden Indonesia." Asian and African Studies,  9: 97-113.

M. Ensink and J. A. B. van Buitenen (1964). "Glossary of Sanskrit from
Indonesia." Vak,  6: viii + 219.


Russel Jones (1984). Loan-Words in Contemporary Indonesian. Towards a
Description of Contemporary Indonesian: Preliminary Studies, Part II, NUSA.
Jakarta, Badan Penyelenggara Seri NUSA.  Towards a Description of
Contemporary Indonesian: Preliminary Studies, Part II, NUSA. Vol. 19. 1-38
1-38. 1-38.

Of these works, Gonda's is the most thorough.


Remember that the knowledge of Sanskrit in Indonesian deteriorated at the
end of the middle ages, and that Sanskrit inscriptions in Indonesian
sometimes are erronous and may not always make sense.

The text "om sidhingastu nama ciwaya" may perhaps = om siddhir astu nama.h
/siv-aya = "om may there be success, hail to Shiva". But don't quote me. I
have no experience reading inscriptions in Indonesian Sanskrit.
