Dear Indologists,


I work at the Warburg Institute Library and I am very keen to strenghten
our holdings related to East-West relationships up to about 1700. 
For this purpose I wonder if anyone on this list could suggest the name 
and address of some reliable Indian booksellers from whom I could obtain
lists of recent publications. 

		Many thanks in advance.

P.S. Do you know the Indology list? If not, I can send you the address.
