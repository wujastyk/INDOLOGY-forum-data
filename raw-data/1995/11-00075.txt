The Blackbox archive site - blackbox.hacc.washington.edu - is no longer 
available. I am unsure whether it's archives are kept elsewhere or if 
they were even transfer as all. Additionally, it is the University of 
Washington which is located in Seattle, WA. The "other" is a cross-state 
rival.

Regarding the recent threads about Devanagari fonts, I might add that one 
very good program for creating and printing Devanagari texts is Avinash 
Chopde's ITRANS package. Text is entered in transliterated devanagari, 
and then processed into devanagari in Postscript format, and when used with 
Frans Velthuis's Devnag Metafont package, into DVI and TeX formats as 
well. The ITRANS package as well as the Devnag Metafont package is  
available via FTP at ftp://chandra.cis.brown.edu.
