There is of course a dichotomy in the calendar system. The lunar months 
Chait, Vaisakh etc have two fortnights and first one is Shukla Paksa and 
the second is the Krisna Paksa but the new year start in the first day of 
the Krisna Paksa of Chaitra so that first half of Chaitra is in the 
previous year and the second Paksa is in the new Year.
