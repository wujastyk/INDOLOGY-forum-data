I have also found this to be true (I work in Orissa).  I am not a classical 
indologist or scholar of Sanskrit, so I can not join the conversation at that 
level.  But I study living tradition and practice in Orissa, and have 
done much of my work in collaboration with an Oriya anthropologist who lives 
and teaches in Orissa.  He uses the pronunication `Brahmin' to refer to 
himself and others of the set of (sub)castes; when he transliterates or 
writes articles in English I have seen the use of both forms, interchangably 
as far as I can tell.  I have several of his publications with me to refer 
to.  

I have not known the `Brahmin' pronunciation to be used in a derogatory sense 
but that could vary with locality and language group, as for example the 
implications of the epithet `babu', in various social contexts.

In my own work, I have vacillated between use of the two forms, and I have 
enjoyed this discussion regarding the various reasons scholars choose one 
form or another, and what they understand by each.
