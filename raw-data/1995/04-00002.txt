Subject: Request

One of the PhD students at the University of Queensland, David
Dargie, is researching authorship in Sanskrit documents in the
period 500-800AD.

Does anyone know of:

1.      an OCR (hardware or software) for Devanagari
2.      machine readable corpora from this period, especially
                for Sankara
3.      concordance and quantitative data for Sanskrit

Many thanks,
