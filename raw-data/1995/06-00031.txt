This has been drawn to my attention from some one else too. I am sorry 
that I misunderstood him but due to his sentence construction it could be 
construed in either way and as a result I did over-react. When I read 
outsider, I assumed an outsider to this list or the discipline of 
indology, since I am also an outsider in that sense by not being a
professional indologist or a tenured professor.

It surely is reasonable in the same sense that Kalyanramans was accused 
of being a hindutva motivated scholar as you mention in the rest of your 
note.
Anyway, I have not yet read Kalyanraman's note and would appreciate to 
see it if some one has saved it and would forward it to me.
