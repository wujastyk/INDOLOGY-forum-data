Yes.  In several cases this is at the expense of the Sanskrit
commentaries.  I often find it hard these days to buy copies of medical
texts with two or three Skt. commentaries, i.e., the sort of editions
that NSP and Anandasrama were famous for.  Today, you get one Skt.
commentary if you are lucky, and then a very verbose Hindi translation
and commentary.  Quite annoying for the historian, but of course
perfectly understandable in terms of publishers serving market demand.
