No, I believe they are two different "Sarvangis," by different compilers, 
both within the Dadupanth tradition and so of course with a similar 
framework and contents.
Moreover, if I remember correctly Callewaert's Rajab book didn't include 
the whole Sarvangi, but only the parts attributed to Dadu. Or some such 
selection. It's been a while since I looked at it...
The Gopaldas I have at home, having bought a copy from Gerry Barrier at 
Madison a couple of years ago; the Rajjab is here in the CU 
library and I think I'll go have a look at it. I'll 
report back in a few hours if I find I've misrepresented it.
