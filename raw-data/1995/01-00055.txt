2. If you can get hold of Devara's paper "From Mutsaddis to Marwaris" 
that would also be helpful. The reference follows:

TITLE: A rethinking on the politics of commercial society in pre
-colonial India [microform] : transition from Mut Saddi to
Marwari / by G.S.L. Devra.
PUB. INFO: New Delhi : Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, 1987.
DESCRIPTION: 87 p. ; 28 cm.
SERIES: Occasional papers on history and society ; no. 38

3. IIM Ahmedabad has a case of the Parta system used by Marwari 
businessmen even today. You can possibly write for it or send 
e-mail to some there.

4. Prakrit Bharati in Jaipur is putting together a compendium 
of quotations from the classical texts pertaining to business 
and commerce. It should be ready soon. Someone has the proofs, 
I am sure.

By the way, what sort of evidence do we have for your ovbservation 
that Indians are high on the Power distance and Masculinity scale ? 
I had seen some work on Indian children which pointed to a very high
 power orientation. But this seems to be different.
