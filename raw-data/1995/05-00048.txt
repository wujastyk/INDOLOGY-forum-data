The terms 'puurva' and 'uttara' Miimaamsaa should also be compared with 
the terms Hiinayaana and Mahaayaana.  Indeed, those who used the term 
'puurva' miimaamsaa to refer to the 'other' system wanted to imply that 
theirs was the 'uttara' or higher system.  No texts referred to 
themselves as belonging to Hiinayaana or Shraavakayaana.  This is 
probably also true of 'puurva' Miimaamsaa.  
	Perhaps someone could elaborate on the earliest use of these terms.
