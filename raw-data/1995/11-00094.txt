Here's what I remember...what did you say I won?...a car?  :-)
See Rv. 7.59.12

om  tryambakaM yajAmahe sugandhim pushhTivardhanam
urvArukam iva bandhanAt mR^ityoH mukshhIya mA amR^ItAt

Om We worship the three-eyed one, sweet fraganced (or
wearing sandalwood, I suppose) and the promotor of welfare.  

May we be released from the bondage (of) death like the urvAruka fruit, 
not (released) from immortality.

Sorry, I don't recall the form mukshhIya (from dhAtu muJNj), so the
"May we be released" part is suspect, but that's the gist, if memory serves.
