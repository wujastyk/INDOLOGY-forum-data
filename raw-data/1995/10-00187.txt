ascii has a restricted range: 91 keys; ANSI doubles it. I suppose the 
Truetype fonts e.g. Times Roman based on ANSI set can also provide
for the tranliteration and text exchange functions.

The CD ROM I had referred to provides an ANSI definition for the glyphs
required to represent South asian scripts. For example, the diacritical
needed for 'r' in Sanskrit required a particular glyph to be ligatured to 
'T' and anoter glyph to be ligatured to, say, 's' preceding. Each of these
glyphs gets assigned an ANSI number from 32 (space) to 255. Thus, ANSI
enables the depiction of glyphs needed to calligraphic elegance.
