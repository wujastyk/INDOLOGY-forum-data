Yes, there is freeware postscript (and may be truetype also) available from
the archive located at Wahingotn State University located in Seattle in USA.
I have used postscript version of these fonts and they are very good. I even
defined a set of Macros to make typing of diacritical chars very easy using
these fonts. You can do the same using the Recorder application under Windows,
but if you want my macro file I can send it free.
