        2. Computational linguistics
        3. Large scale corpora
        4. Speech processing
        5. Related fields

 The scope of discussion includes all aspects of computational processing 
in and related to the languages of Asia including: linguistic theories; 
linguistic data; databases; tools for language corpora and dictionaries; 
systems for language and text processing and generation; algorithms; natural 
language interfaces; multi-lingual systems; spelling checkers; parsing; 
lexical and semantic analysis; pragmatics; discourse; knowledge 
representation; machine translation; optical character recognition; font
