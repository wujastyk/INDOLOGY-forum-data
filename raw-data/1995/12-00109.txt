Dear Dr. Dominik Wujastyk
I am thanking your rapid reply and
your kind proposal.If we get a
copy or microfilm of Vyomavatii's
Mysore MS, we can read an important
VaizeSika text, Vyomavatii, more correctly.
The detail of a Vyomavatii's MS called
Mysore manuscript is, according to
Prof. Halbfass's new book "On being and what
there is" as follows:
It is preserved in the collection of the
Oriental Research Institute at University
of Mysore (Ms. No. C-1575)
I don't know about Mysore MS more. If you
have a chance to order a copy or microfilm of
this MS, and fulfil my request, we are very 
happy. Anyway, we are thanking your very kind
proposal.
Best regards
