Dear Ms. Garzilli, 
  I am very interested in your work.  How can I have access to your 
writings? I am teaching in the Religious Studies Department at University 
of British Columbia where I offer courses on Hindu Tradition and Women 
and Religion in South Asian context.
  My basic discipline is in Smrti and Mimamsa which I studied in 
Calcutta University. My graduate work at Oxford was focussed on Dance and 
Drama in Sanskritic tradition which led to my interest in working 
on women's issues from classical to the present day. I am putting 
together a collection of articles. 

With best wishes,

Sincerly,

Mandakranta Bose
