The inaugural lecture of Richard Gombrich as Boden Professor of Sanskrit
at Oxford, "On being Sanskritic," puts forward a forceful argument that
the study of Sanskrit is worthwhile.  It is also very funny, and
includes an interesting potted history of Sanskrit at Oxford.
Recommended.  Should be available from the OUP.
