     As I was meditating on the Playboy centerfold, as usual, the shit hit
me. For the benefit of all and, especially, of honorable Ms. Elizabeth Hole,
whose sensitivities were tested by the original post, I am going to reveal
the true meaning of the word "shit". It is an acronym:

     SHIT: Spiritually Heightened Intellectual Trance.

     In the light of my revelation, please read the above, new and
improved, post again. I, always, talk about my shit; would you mind Ms.
Hole?
     Paraphrasing the now famous NRA slogan, "Guns don't kill, people do";
I would dare to say to honorable Ms. Hole 'Words don't mean, people do'.
