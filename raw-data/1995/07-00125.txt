  In response to Tamar Reich's request earlier today:

  It appears the Library of Congress has two editions available on
microfiche.  Both should be available from the South Asia Microfilm
Project collection at the Center for Research Libraries.  One is
the Sanskrit text.  The other is the text with a Hindi comm.  Copies
of the OCLC records follow.

  In addition, the Sanskrit catalogs of the British Museum, India 
Office, and National Library of India list at least 9 other 19th-
and early 20th-cent. editions.

> Dear Indology Members,
> 
> Can anyone help me find any edition of the Jaiminiya Asvamedhikaparvan? 
> I know about its existence from Karmarkar's description in the
> "Introduction" to the Asvamedhikaparvan, pp. xxiv-xliv (in the BORI edition
> of the Mahabharata).  Sukthankar also refers to it in his "Prolegomena" to
> the Adiparvan. The trouble is, neither of them gives any references.
> Any help will be appreciated.
