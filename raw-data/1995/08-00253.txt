Dear list members,

	A collegue of mine, Paul Taylor (ptaylor at a1.sas.ac.uk>, is
organising a seminar on pre-Islamic Indian art next Spring and is looking
for someone, if possible based in the U.K., to speak on the economic
history of Pre-Islamic India. Can anyone recommend a speaker? 

			Many thanks in advance
