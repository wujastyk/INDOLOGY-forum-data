Subject: saMsAra = Reincarnation?
Message-ID: <161227018555.23782.15643666808134759034.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

On saMsAra:
	Marathi indeed uses the term "punarjanma" for reincarnation.  The 
word "saMsAra" in many modern languages does not have its classical 
meaning.  In Hindi it refers to 'the world', while in Marathi it refers 
to the household or affairs of the household.
