>From the existence of cruelty, misery, oppression etc. in India,  it does 
not follow
that such things are due to "Caste System" - if by that term is meant the 
existence of 
the practice of jAtis in India.  jAti -  in the
 sense of self-enclosed community not having interdining and inter-marriage
 with other communities - may exist on a horizontal level, and a ritual
self-enclosedness of a group is not the same as putting
  'restrictions' on celebrating any festival  by others in their
 own milieus, as the sentence from Tartokov implies.   
One may have criticisms of the milieu and practices 
connected with  ' jAti' - ( one may, for instance, take jAti practice to task
for just living side by side without attempting a 'social integration' 
and  'social fraternity').  But that has to be on  independent grounds than 
that of  'elitism', because it is doubtful whether jAti is a system of  
'elitism' at all.
