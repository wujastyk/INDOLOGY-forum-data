1996-97 
Hinduja Fellow
Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center
Columbia University

The Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center at Columbia University
invites applications for a one-year postdoctoral fellowship for the
1996-97 academic year.  The Hinduja Center supports research that
promotes a deeper understanding of Indic civilizations and their
contributions to our modern world.  It is particularly interested in
funding projects that bring insights from particular Indic traditions
to bear upon contemporary problems, especially those related to
health, science, gender, violence, ethics, education, the environment,
and interreligious understanding.  

For the 1996-97 fellowship, priority will be given to applicants
pursuing research on  the following topics: Indic systems of healing
(particularly as they relate to women's health); and models of
conflict management within Indic cultures.  The stipend will be
$30,000 plus full fringe benefits; additional research funds will be
made available.  The Hinduja Fellow will be expected to teach one
course and to be an active member of Columbia University's Society of
Fellows in the Humanities.  The application deadline is Dec. 1, 1996.
