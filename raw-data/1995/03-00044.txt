I have learned that a very fanatic Hindu party named Shiv Sena has come to 
power in the State of Maharastra in India. This is very important state 
with capitol in Bombay. It is alleged that Shiv Sena was responsible for 
many atrocities not only against Muslims but also against Hindus from 
other states. The situation is parallel to that in Algeria but only 
difference is that it is in one part of India and not whole of India.
Let us keep our fingers crossed and see the developments.
