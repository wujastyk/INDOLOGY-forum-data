Subject: Meaning of Panini
Message-ID: <161227021310.23782.16921490066748339228.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Speaking of dictionaries, I have been looking for the meaning of the
word "Panini". I have been unable to trace the etymology of the word to
anything beyond "Name of the sage Panini". It seems to indicate
"hand-made", but I'm not sure. Can someone help me out here please?

Thanks.
