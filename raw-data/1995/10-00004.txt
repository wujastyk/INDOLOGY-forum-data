ABSTRACT

     This essay examines some current concerns of socially engaged
Buddhists in the West. How does one practice nonviolence in one's own
life and in the world? How can the demands of "inner" and "outer" work
be reconciled? What framework should be used in assessing the effects
of Buddhist-inspired activism? Today's engaged Buddhists do not refer
extensively to Buddhism's ethical tradition, and some of their
activities may not appear to be distinctively Buddhist. Nonetheless,
their efforts reflect a longstanding Mahaayaana ideal -- that
transcendental wisdom is actualized most meaningfully in compassionate
action.
