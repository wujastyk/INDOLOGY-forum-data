I suggest your patron contact Prof. William Hunt, Dept. of History,
St. Lawrence University, Canton, NY 13617, phone: 315-379-5212.  He
has arranged massive book shipments, first to Poland, more recently
to Sarajevo, and is very much on top of the logistics of such matters.
I have been unable to find out if he is on e-mail.
T. Coburn
