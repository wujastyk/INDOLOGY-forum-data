The following may be of interest in this connection, even though it is not 
what is asked for. I am writing from my memory and now I am not having the 
relevant text available for consultation. Ramanuja in his BrahmasUtrabhAsya 
(in the very beginning) comments on the word  'athAto BrahmajijnAsA'. As 
against Shankara, he suggests that the word 'athah' means 'after completing 
the dharmamImAmsA' and fulfilling the relevant duties enjoined on the 
householder. That is, he clealy suggets that concerning with  'brahman'  is 
something that needs to be done after concerning oneself with the question 
of dharma. So, at least RAmAnuja appears to share the idea that Jaimini's 
dharmasUtras and brahmasUtras form a unity. But, from Ramanuja's polemics 
against Shankara, it appears that he was accusing Shankara for not sharing 
this opinion.
