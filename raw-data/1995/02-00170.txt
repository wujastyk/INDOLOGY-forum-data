Subject: CSX codes and ambiguity
Message-ID: <161227018656.23782.6818871660568942783.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I cannot answer concerning the appearance or not of certain vowels etc. in
actual Vedic, but the CSX fonts, at least those designed by Prof.
Deshpande, were intended to represent not only what we might call "natural
texts," that is Skt in use, but also to allow writing of grammatical texts,
in which theoretical possibilities have to be taken into account.
Therefore for example any vowel can be nasalized, etc.  In Desphande's
Manjushree-CSX font the vocalic accentuated l (k.lpti) can be obtained by
SHIFT-OPTION 1.  l with solid dot represents the Vedic consonant l, with
hollow dot the vocalic l.  Lower case o macron and e macron are also
available in this font, which should serve for long o and e, respectively.
So, if I understand the question correctly, at least the Manjushree-CSX is
not ambiguous, nor does it have missing letters.
