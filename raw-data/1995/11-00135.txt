Reading through biographies of two Tibetans who had studied in Bihar and 
Nepal in the 1180s and 1190s, I came across titles of two Sanskrit 
grammars which, despite looking into the standard reference works, 
Scharfe, Cardona etc., I am not able to identify. The titles of the texts in 
question are given in the following Tibetan transcription (sans 
diacritics): Rajashri and Vyakaranalamkara. Is there anyone out there who 
could help me out in their identification? An anticipatory many thanks.
