> Dear friend,
> 
> It has long been felt that we need some common forum in India to keep in
> touch, to exchange information, to have lively debate, and most of all,
> to learn from other's experience. While we still do not have "usenet news"
> easily available in India, we do have electronic mail.
> And there is a lot we can do with that!
> 
> We have set up a "listserver" at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Adv.
> Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore to serve our needs for common
> fora, to encourage discussions on various topics. The listserver maintains
> a list of topics, and for each topic it maintains a list of addresses
> of people who subscribe to that list. You can subscribe to any of the
> lists, and can signoff from the same without any problem. When you
> subscribe to a list, all postings made to that list will be forwarded
> to you. You can also post to any of the lists. Subscribing to lists
> that interest you can be more beneficial than you can imagine now.
> 
> To give you a flavour of kind of topics that are already available,
> we attach a short list of selected topics at the end. The topics are
> designed in line with those in usenet news. This list is by no means
> exhaustive. There will be more topics in future.

> 
> To begin, send a mail to the following address:

> with a *** single-line *** message that goes like:

> 	help  your-email-address
> 
> for instance: 'help a at b.edu'
> 
> 
> This will send you all the necessary information to get started using
> the listserver.
