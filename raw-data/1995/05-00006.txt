     Thanks for your kind words. Now, I must prove my worth.

     I have earlier posted my deep doubts about Scanrom offer. I am glad
that some of you are depending on my dispassionate critique of this product.
I would advise you not to pay much attention to the Scanrom offer. It has
problems with individual fonts, keyboard mapping to the most familiar
IBM/Qwerty standard format, lack of support and pertinent documentation
vis-a-vis hardware compatibility. Unprofessional designing of some of the
individual fonts. This may be due to the unfamiliarity of the designer of
the aesthetic forms of the language glyphs. Some fonts are totally
unsuitable for "copy". Copy, here, is used as a technical term for
advertising copy. Some variations in a particular font may have been used
as "filler" to enlarge the final number (758+758).
