Subject: "Look to this day" quote

George Salim, of the Near Eastern Section of the Library of Congress, has 
kindly made a quick search of Gibran's THE PROPHET (there is no Gibran 
concordance) and indeed has come across something very close for part of 
the quote, but nothing like all of it:

    Yet the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness,
    And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is 
today's dream.

The Prophet. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1983, p. 62.

The search will continue.
