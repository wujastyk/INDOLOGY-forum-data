     My recent barb on Birgit's 'Ignore-ant' philosophy may not address the
real issue on Indology-L. My very good friend Richard P. Hayes has written a
book on how to run a serious academically oriented group. I take liberty to
quote following without his permission.

     Question:

           I'm a neophite Buddhist scholar (my primary interest being
   linguistic anthropology); therefore what'd be more helpful (for me) is
   some more broad-based look at the overall philosophical trends in
   Buddhism, and vignettes on the lives of some of its major proponents.
   Now I'll be glad to keep quiet if that's not really the purpose of
   this list (it seems to me as much a professional forum as a general
   interest list).  But I AM curious as to how many others share my
   views and why those who don't don't.  Thanx.

     Answer:
