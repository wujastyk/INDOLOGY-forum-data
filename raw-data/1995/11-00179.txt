The Asian Studies Centre's URL here has been changed. It is now:
	http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/asian_studies

Those of you who have been kind enough to link with us, would you please 
update your link. Thank you very much. The latest update to our web site 
was in the middle of October, just before our 3-week strike. 

Indologically inclined, 
Bob Hueckstedt
