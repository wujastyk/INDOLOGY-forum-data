I have been trying for several weeks to locate the information about 
the 3rd Intl conference on Hindukush Cultural Studies to be held in 
Chitral Aug 26-20.  I have the call for papers, but it includes only 
the coordinators  in Pakistan with mailing addresses, not even 
telephone or FAX numbers.  I would like to get the program and perhaps 
the name of someone in Europe or US  who will be attending, as I may 
want to go.  By the way, where is there an academic center specializing 
in  Hindukush historical-cultural studies (apart from geology etc.)?

thank you, Dr. Renee Kovacs      RnKovacs at ix.netcom.com
