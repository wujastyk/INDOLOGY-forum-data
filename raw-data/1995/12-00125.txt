I don?t know what you mean by a "scientific analysis of the Jain religion"
but one of the best (in terms of attempting to be comprehensive) and most
recent works on Jainism as a whole is #The Jains# by Paul Dundas published
by Routledge in 1992. After Helmut von Glasenapp?s #Der Jainismu# published
in 1925 in German (not yet translated into English), and still a standard
work, Paul?s book brings us up to date. The information is based not only
on original sources but also on field work and inforamtion gathered through
personal contact with the Jainas in India and abroad.
