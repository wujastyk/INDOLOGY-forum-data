ALl the literature on the aspects of speech (of which the highest 
is para), on which Bhartrhari resorts to  in his Vakya Padiyam, is lost.
We know that Vyadi wrote a big work in a lack of granthas expounding 
Panini; Vasurata (the teacher of Bhartrhari) wrote a digest on the 
original Vyakaranagama (written by Ravana), on which the VP is based (on 
these two, VP II, Comm., 283-286); Bhartrhari wrote himself a commentary 
on the Mahabhasya which served as the basis of the Pradipa (Mahabhasya 
Pradipa, 538). 
I know this is commentarial literature and not alamkara.
But I associated the facts that Bhartrhari is from Northern India; 
according to I-ching he was Buddhist and died around the beginning of the 
VII cent.; his grammatical works and those of his precedessors -- used by 
him for his philosophical speculations -- are lost; according to I-ching 
B. 7 times went to a monastery in order to become  a monk and threfore, 
in the VII century the grammarian Bhartrhari and the poet Bhartrhari were 
considered one person. 
Can all this be a track?
