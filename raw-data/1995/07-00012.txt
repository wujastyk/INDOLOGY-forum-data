They have recently brought out a CD-ROM with
1500+ fonts (truetype and postscript) for windows
for ALL SOUTH ASIAN LANGUAGES including many
typestyles and typefaces for URDU.
The fonts use ANSI standard; Alt+ numeral key
entry method with NumLock on since 32 to 255 ANSI
numbers corresponding to the Urdu script glyphs
can be accessed from the keyboard. You may have
to modify your wp/dtp with macros provided by
wp/dtp software to move cursor from right to left.
