Revolutionary teaching technique in "Spoken Sanskrit"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     o The teaching starts with SPEAKING and not with GRAMMAR.
     o The instructor will speak ONLY in SANSKRIT from day one.
     o You don't need to know Sanskrit before!
     o You don't need to memorize all the noun and verb tables. Did we
       do that to learn our mother tongue ?
     o Classes are fun and are conducted through enjoyable games.
     o Follow up classes and study groups will be conducted.
     o Special workshop for Sanskrit teachers will be conducted

The Movement
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    What started off in 1982 at Bangalore, as an experiment to bring back
Sanskrit into daily life, has gathered the momentum of a movement today.
Speak Sanskrit  classes are being held all over the country. Nearly 80% of
people in the village Mattur in Karnataka converse in Sanskrit on a daily
basis. More than a million people have participated in Speak Sanskrit
classes in the last 14 years.

Krishna Shastry, The Man behind the movement.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    "Language learning starts with speaking and not grammar. This is the
natural way to learn any language", says Krishna Shastry. After obtaining
his "Shastry" degree from Rashtreeya Sanskrita Samsthaanam, New Delhi,
Sri Krishna Shastry, 39, has devoted his life for taking Sanskrit to
common people. He has personally trained thousands of teachers and students.
Ever smiling, tireless Sri Krishna Shastry is a bundle of energy and an
inspiration to all.
