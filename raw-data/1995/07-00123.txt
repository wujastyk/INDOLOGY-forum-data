Dear Indology Members,

Can anyone help me find any edition of the Jaiminiya Asvamedhikaparvan? 
I know about its existence from Karmarkar's description in the
"Introduction" to the Asvamedhikaparvan, pp. xxiv-xliv (in the BORI edition
of the Mahabharata).  Sukthankar also refers to it in his "Prolegomena" to
the Adiparvan. The trouble is, neither of them gives any references.
Any help will be appreciated.
