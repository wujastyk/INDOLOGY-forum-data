Subject: Question on Islamic conversion
Message-ID: <161227019703.23782.6463287773911998831.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am looking at the conversion to Islam in Medieval India.  I would like
bibliographic suggestions on studies devoted to who converted and the
conditions associated with conversion.

I am also interested in the terminology used in South Asia to
distinguish hereditary Muslims and immigrated Muslims from 'converted'
Muslims, and if there is a distinction the term for a 'new convert' as
opposed to indigenous Indian Muslims in Medieval times.
