a sloka which encodes the digits of the the decimal expansion of
pi (correct to about 20+ decimal places) based on the katapayadi

I appreciate a pointer to the source or any other relevant
information.

The verse in question is found to be a quite new production by Swami
Bharati Krishna Tirthaji in his book, _Vedic Mathematics_, Delhi: Motilal,
1978.  Note that his `Vedic mathematics' is nothing to do with the
mathematics in the Vedic period.  For this see, for example, R. C. Gupta,
`Six types of Vedic mathematics', _Ga.nita Bhaaratii (Bulletin of the
Indian Society for History of Mathematics)_ 16, 1994, 5--15.
