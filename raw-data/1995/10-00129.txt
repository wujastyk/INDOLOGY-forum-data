The most recent work is that of the late Prof. Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya:
two volumes areout: History of Science and Technology in Ancien India.

I remember this because I have conributed a chapter on Indian Alchemy
in volume 2. I will send you more references as soon as the library
in the centre is set up in about two weeks.

Best of luck with your studies. Regards.
