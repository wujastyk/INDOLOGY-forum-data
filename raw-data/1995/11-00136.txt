I think we are gradually losing sight of the original issue. If you 
can still bear with it, please, allow me two short remarks on Dominik 
Wujastyk's latest contribution:

I don't see any lines drawn along language boundaries. If I'm not 
mistaken, the question of German only came up with reference to 
Geldner's Rigveda translation. At that point we were discussing the 
accuracy of WDO's translation, not its pedagogical value.

This is certainly closer to the issue than "Asceticism and eroticism 
in the mythology of Siva" mentioned in another contribution a few 
days ago. Perhaps someone else can muster enough energy and interest 
to open a discussion on this one. 
By the way, it was also published in the U.S.A.: 

University of Chicago Press 1990. ISBN 0-226-61847-1

Good luck!
