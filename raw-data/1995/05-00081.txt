Subject: SHIPPING DONATED LIBRARIES

          A patron who wants to donate a large number of scholarly journals 
          to particular overseas universities has heard that there are  one 
          or  two foundations or charitable organizations who will pay  for 
          the shipping  of  donated libraries to  needy countries.  He  has 
          been unable so far  to locate them in standard directories.  Does 
          anyone know anything about such organizations?
