Forgive me banging on at the same old drum, but: meaning comes from
sentences, not etymolgies.

Surely the early meaning of the words of the "k.satra" group is to be
understood from studying how the authors of the early Sanskrit texts
used the words, not from comparison with similar-sounding words in
Kannada meaning "slush"?
