     Thank you David, for your kind enquiry. Please do not open the package.
The common answer to all your questions is a big "NO". For the uninitiated
in the legal aspect of product warranty, Scanrom warranty is foolproof. I
take liberty to quote part of it here:

     THE SOFTWARE AND RELATED DOCUMENTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". SCANROM
PUBLICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE
ACCOMPANYING WRITTEN MATERIALS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAMS IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU (AND NOT THE SCANROM PUBLICATIONS OR AUTHORIZED COMPUTER DEALER) ASSUME
THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICE, REPAIR, OR CORRECTIONS. THIS
LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH
VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

     Note: Above is a verbatim copy, including the choice of capital
letters. As the warranties go this is no more scary than any others. I,
however, point to the owner's risk "ALL".

     Once again, in the interest of the members of this group who suffered
my off colored postings, laughed at my contrived humor, I would not make you
cry because of this offer. Trust me, this product should have been beta
tested before full fledged launch. It may, subsequently, prove to be a star
but I categorize it as "Not yet ready for prime-time appearance".
