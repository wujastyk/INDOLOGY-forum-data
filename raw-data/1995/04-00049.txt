I was wondering whether anyone on the list might have the email or snail 
mail address of Gauri Viswanathan as well as her current university or 
college affiliation.  She is the author of _Masks of Conquest: Literary 
Study and British Rule in India_ published in 1989 by Columbia University 
Press.  She has more recently written an article entitled, "Yale College 
and the Culture of British Imperialism" in the Spring 1994 issue of the 
Yale Journal of Criticism.

Thanks very much for the help.
