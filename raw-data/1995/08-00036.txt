Subject: Norman diacritic fonts for Macintosh
Message-ID: <161227020254.23782.2675195547350849622.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Professor K.R. Norman's diacritic fonts for Macintosh have now been added
to John Smith's ftp server. They can be obtained by anonymous ftp from:
bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk. They are currently to be found at:
/pub/john/software/fonts/norman/NORM.SEA.HQX.

I understand from Dominik Wujastyk that they will shortly be copied to:
gopher-server.bcc.ac.uk.

Both the postscript and truetype versions of the fonts Normyn and Mytymes
are included. (These supersede the older Norman and Mytimes fonts for most
purposes.)
