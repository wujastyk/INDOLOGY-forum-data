Generally speaking, it is always a good idea to turn to the New
Catalogus Catalogorum (and Aufrecht's Cat. Cat.), an often neglected 
reference tool. There you will find a short entry for the NyAyasAhasrI 
of BhuvaneZa. In a way, the NCC is the most comprehensive "history of 
Sanskrit literature" that will ever be available. So let's hope that 
some day it will be completed.
Another possible source of information are printed library catalogues 
of Sanskrit books, in particular the India Office Library Catalogue 
in four volumes, however, not in this particular case, it seems.

Sorry to bother you with such elementary stuff.
