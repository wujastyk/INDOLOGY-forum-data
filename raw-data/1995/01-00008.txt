I don't have particular advice, but you can read a consolidated
annotated list of South Asian language computer fonts on The South Asia
Gopher. Navigate through the menus as follows:

    TEACHING RESOURCES on South Asia
         Inventory of Language Materials (ILM)
              South Asian Language Computer Fonts

The instructions for connecting to the gopher itself (three alternative
techniques, depending upon your software and network connection) are as
follows:

Simply gopher to: <gopher.cc.columbia.edu 71>; and then navigate down
through the menus as follows (Be sure to use port 71):
        CLIO Plus/SELECTED TOPICS/South Asia.

If you have gopher client software, use the following pointer ('bookmark'):
	Type=1
	Name=The South Asia Gopher
	Host=gopher.cc.columbia.edu
	Port=71
	Path=1/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia

---------OR-------------

Simply telnet to: <columbianet.columbia.edu>. Once connected to
Columbianet, select the menu item marked "CLIO Plus." Within that menu,
you'll find an item on the list labelled "SELECTED TOPICS: Internet
Resources By Subject" Select that one, and within it you'll find the South
Asia Gopher. 

---------OR-------------

If you use MOSAIC or Lynx or other web-browser, use this URL: 
     gopher://gopher.cc.columbia.edu:71/11/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia


I hope this is helpful.
