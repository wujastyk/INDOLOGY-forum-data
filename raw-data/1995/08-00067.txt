Further to the issue of replying to INDOLOGY messages (whether the reply
goes to INDOLOGY or to the individual correspondent), Chris Wooff

For my money, I think I'd rather leave things as they are.  I "reply"
more often to INDOLOGY at large than to the individual poster of the
message.  I am prepared to be careful about posting private messages to
the full membership by accident.

Could we vote?  Send me a message at d.wujastyk at ucl.ac.uk, with your
vote as the subject line.  Say either

  "public replies" .... to keep replies going to the whole membership, or
  "private replies" ... to change the system so that replies go to
                        individuals by default.
