Dear Dominik,
I remember an article by Wilhelm Rau on Sanskrit terms of lotus published 
in Festschrift Weller. Unfortunytely I do not have library facilities 
to be more precise but perhaps somebody else can help you with exact 
bibliographical data if necessary. Since Rau also studied botany he might 
discuss questions which interest you.
