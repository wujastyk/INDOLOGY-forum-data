I just finished reading two short "books", if you will, on Indian 
ethnology by Chandra Chakraberty called "An Ethnic Interpretation of 
Pauranic Personages" and another by Akshaya Kumari Devi called "A 
Biographical Dictionary of Puranic Personages".

I am wondering if any of you have heard of these texts and if they are 
considered "scholarly" works. They tend to provide a lot of fascinating 
information, but fail to cite any real sources.

Any responses, either privately, or to the list, will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
