>From Dominik Wujastyk's posting on 13 Jan I discovered with wonder that a 
Japanese team has completed an electronic version of Ramayana and 
Mahabharata. I only subscribed to the Indology list a few days ago, so I 
did not see your original announcement. Could you please inform me how to 
get access to those files?
I extend my wholehearted sympathy to you and all the Japanese people for 
the terrible disaster brought by the recent earthquake.
Sincerely
Benjamin Preciado
