An undocumented eText[http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/ror/hindu-d.html]
cites this passage as from a Vedic hymn to Siva:

"We invoke with obeisance, the ruddy of the sky, with spiral braided hair,
a brilliant form. Far be thy cow slaying and man slaying weapon."

Off hand, can anyone supply chapter and verse?

Thanks,
Michael Rabe
