Dear members of the list
This enquiry is directed mainly at those of you who use descriptive 
catalogues of manuscripts in Sanskrit, Hindi and other languages.

Some catalogues give greatest prominence to *a catalogue serial number* for 
each entry. (i.e. British Library catalogues, Tripathi's catalogue of the 
Strasbourg Jaina MSS)

A few catalogues give greatest prominence to the *MS number* for each entry. 
(i.e. Blumhardt and Master's catalogue of Gujarati and Rajasthani 
manuscripts in the IOL)   

My question is this, which system do you find preferable or easier to use?
[I ask this because I am about to publish a catalogue of Hindi Manuscripts 
in the library here and wonder which system to adopt.]
