Since most users on accounts at educational institutions are prohibitted
from letting others use their accounts this is NOT an advisable
practise (unless consent of the institution is also obtained). I realize
this is practised all the time in all countries, but it is liable to get
someone in trouble and jeopardize the situation for other researchers. I
would advize approaching the approriate authorities directly (perhaps
bringing your colleague as a reference) and paying (if required) as a
guest user.
