Subject: Query about a reference
Message-ID: <161227018428.23782.14951337058996261222.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Ludwik Sternbach's Bibliography on Dharma and Artha (Harrassowitz 
1973), p. 20, I found the following insufficient reference to an article 
that I would like to read:

Kangle, R.P., "The Relative Age of Gautamadharmasutra" in: Melanges (L. 
Renou), 15-26.

Does anyone know the full reference? This would be a great help, as 
GDhS is an important text for my present study of the notion of 
untouchability in dharmasastra.

With best wishes to all Indology-subscribers,
Mikael Aktor, Institute for History of Religions, University of Copenhagen.
