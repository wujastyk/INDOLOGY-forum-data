Subject: Critique of the West in Indic literature and society
Message-ID: <161227020343.23782.12307893745568731431.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

On behalf of a colleague, I am looking for information (literature) on
Indic critique of Western culture and values, preferably of a more
sophisticated type than the trite criticism of lack of sprirituality etc,
but anything is of interest.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
