	Clearly the word Asura is originally not a privative form of 
Sura, but derived as asu+ra.  Only in later times, the word Sura was 
derived from the word Asura through reanalysis, when the word Asura 
developed a largely negative meaning.
	In any case, it was my impression that while the word Deva has 
Indo-European cognates, the word Asura/Ahura (iranian) does not go beyond 
the common Indo-Iranian period.
