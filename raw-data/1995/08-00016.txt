ABSTRACT

     This article provides an introduction to some contemporary
issues in medical ethics and the literature which addresses them
from a Buddhist perspective. The first part of the article discusses
Buddhism and medicine and outlines some of the main issues in
contemporary medical ethics. In the rest of the paper three subjects
are considered: i) moral personhood, ii) abortion, and iii) death,
dying and euthanasia. The bibliographic references appended to the
article will be updated periodically (contributions are welcome),
and the latest version of the bibliography will be available from
the journal's "Resources" directory.
