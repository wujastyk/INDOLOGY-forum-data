Being a native speaker of Hindi, I have never heard the name Gulabjaman 
refer to any fruit. It is rather a common north Indian sweet.

Further I understand India (Bharatkhand) is considered part of Jambudweep 
therefore it has to be bigger than India. Could it be Asia? I have never 
heard Indonesia being called Jambudweep.
