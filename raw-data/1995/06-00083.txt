Gary,
 A very interesting study of Indian Muslims pertaining to your 
question is done by Professor K.S. Lal in his book 
"Indian Muslims; Who Are They" (1990) ISBN 81-85990-10-7

Other books by Prof Lal on related topics are :
"History of the Khaljis" (1950,67,80)
"Growth of Muslim Population in Medevial India" (1973)
"Early Muslims in India" (1984)
"The Mughal Harem" (1988)

 The best place to look into medevial India is to go directly to the 
writings of the Muslim scribes of the period, to which there are 
several references in these works.
Regards,
J.B. Sharma
