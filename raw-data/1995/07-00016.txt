I'm interested in this problem, too. Off and on for quite a while I have 
been reencoding a Garamond in Type 1 format that I hope I will be able to 
allow to be freely distributed to all who might want to use it.  I have 
been using the HACC encoding as my model, but not even it has everything 
I need.  For example, for those of us who teach Hindi and use the primer 
of Snell and Weightman, amacrontilde and umacrontilde are necessary.  
When I have my encoding fully set up, I'll be happy to send it to this 
list or, perhaps better, to interested individuals for comment and 
criticism.  This has been a lot of work, and I hope it won't be for naught.

Basically, my message is this: yes, I don't see why we shouldn't be able 
to agree on one encoding for transliterated Indic, whether or not we 
agree on the same transliteration scheme for all the languages.
