Julia Leslie recently posted information about the forthcoming Twentieth Symposium on 
Indian Religions and asked that someone should supply the name of the convener.   He 
is in fact Dr Peter Connolly (West Sussex Inst. of Higher Education).   However, 
bookings should be made to Christopher Aslett, Chester College of Higher Education, 
Cheyney Road, Chester CH1 4BJ.   I have returned my own booking form, so I cannot 
give details of cost of accommodaton and/or meals, but I do remember that the 
registration fee is #15 (#7.50 for students).

Yours

John Brockington
