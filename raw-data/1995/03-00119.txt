Subject: Year of Death of the Philosopher, Hiralal Haldhar
Message-ID: <161227018958.23782.16948182074765745865.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dr. Hiralal Haldhar lived in the beginning of this century and was a 
Professor of Philosophy with a neo-Hegelian pursuasion.  Is anyone in this 
list familar with his work and personality? Is there anyone remotely 
connected with him through family ties?  I urgently require the year of his 
death. This infomration is required for a German Encylopaedia on Philosophy 
and Theory of Science, which has a policy of giving the year of birth and 
death of the philosophers mentioned. 

Prof. Hiralal Haldhar taught in Calcutta University in 1930s and he must 
have died sometime in 40s or 50s. I tried many avenues to get inforamtion 
regarding the year of his death, but to no avail. Publishing  reader's 
letters and advertisements in Indian news papers have not yielded any 
results. Can anyone in this group furnish me this information or suggest 
ways of getting it? 

You can send the message to my private email address:
