In the study of civilizations, the focus on cities is the vogue. I believe
that as Possehl, Fairservis and Dani have argued, studies on the social
milieu which the culture represented are likely to yield a cohesive
socio-cultural historical perspective. A fundamental question remains
unanswered as yet about the Harappan culture: did it disappear after 1700 BC?
Why was Indus preferred to Harappan?

It is not uncommon to rename civilizations; why was mesopotamian preferred to
babylonian? Because, the geographic domain was more accurately denoted by the
latter term, given the cumulative knowledge gained from archaeological
discoveries.
