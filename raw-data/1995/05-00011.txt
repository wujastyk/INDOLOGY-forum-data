> I'm thinking about possibly undertaking a book length manuscript that 
would approach the site from a variety of angles--historical, 
mythological, anthropological, and so forth.  I will be doing some 
preliminary research at the site this fall for about six weeks.  Any 
advice about contacts?  Do you know how I can get a in touch with this 
swami?
