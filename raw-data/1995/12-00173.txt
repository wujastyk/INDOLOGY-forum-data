The Library of Congress is not among the US government institutions 
affected by the current furlough of employees.  Its budget was passed and 
signed as part of the budget of the legislative branch shortly after the 
first furlough.  It is open for business at its usual hours.

Visitors to the Asian division should note that the 3rd Street 
East door, the only one open for several years, has been closed and the 
2nd Street East door has been opened as the only entrance.  This is the 
one that faces the Jefferson ("main") Building.
