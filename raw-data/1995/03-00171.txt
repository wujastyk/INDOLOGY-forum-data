Subject: Summer Sanskrit at Michigan
Message-ID: <161227019039.23782.8341190068568391455.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Since I would be the person teaching Sanskrit in the summer at Michigan, 
I would like to add the following footnote to Bill's message below.  We 
need a minimum of eight students to get the course going.  I am prepared 
to give as much time to the potential students to enroll as I can.  
Please communicate to the potential students you know that they should 
get in touch with Michigan as soon as they possibly can.  The person to 
contact is Lee Schlesinger, Phone:  (313) 764-0352;  Email:  
Schlesin at umich.edu
	Thanks.
