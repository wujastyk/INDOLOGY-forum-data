The archives for the lists:

	sophia
	philos-l
	indology

are now up to date and contain the last completed month (July). It is 
hoped to provide WWW access, and provide access to the latest 
archives (to the day) soon. The URL is

gopher://gopher.liv.ac.uk/11/lists

If you have any questions/complaints about this, please do not discuss
them on the list since I will not see your mail but mail me directly at

	list.admin at liverpool.ac.uk
