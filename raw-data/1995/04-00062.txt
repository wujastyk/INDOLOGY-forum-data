Yes. In Eastern prakrits r and l both become l. The form sa.mkala(a)
'chain' occurs in Ardhamaagadhii, where 'Sa.mkara would be Sa.mkala. So it
is clear that the two words could be identical in form in some Middle
Indian dialects.

Pali has a.t.thi-kankala (cf. kankaala), a.t.thika-sa.mkhalikaa,
a.t.thi-sa.mkhalikaa. I suppose this suggests that some confusion of the
forms might have occurred. BHS has asthi-'sakalaa, asthi-'sankalaa,
asthi-'sa.mkalikaa, etc.
