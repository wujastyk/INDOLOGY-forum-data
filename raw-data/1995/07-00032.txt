I have a question for you. Do you know anyone [or more than one person] 
who might be willing to translate about 6 lines of non-technical English 
into Indic languages?

I have a book project which involves the translation of these lines into 
as many of the world's languages as we can obtain, and then also to get 
the native script and an audio rendition if possible. We are up close to 
70 languages and are still looking for more. 

Can you suggest anyone?  Thanks for your help.
