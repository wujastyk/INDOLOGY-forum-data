Subject: INDOLOGY defaults (fwd)
Message-ID: <161227020378.23782.10866783691993905058.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Following a brief discussion with Chris Woolff, one of INDOLOGY's
masters in Liverpool, the default behaviour of the listserv software has
been changed so that new members will normally receive copies of
messages they post to INDOLOGY rather than not doing so (the default
setting up till now).  In other words, listserv will be "set indology
mail ack" rather than "noack" by default.

Thanks for your input,

Dominik
