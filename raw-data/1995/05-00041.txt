I received the following message from one of my daughter's friends.  I 
wonder if anyone on the list has ideas they could share with Joshua.  
Perhaps it would be best to write him directly.  Thanks, Rick Asher

Hi Mr. Asher, 
	My name is Josh Godine. I am a friend of Alice's and I'm a sophomore
at Grinnell. Alice told me she spoke to you earlier today about taking 
Hindi and/or Tibetan classes in the Boston area this summer. I want to 
prepare for the Antioch Buddhist Studies program in Bodh Gaya next semester.
Any information you could help me find would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks a lot for your time and help. 
				-Josh
