Namaste Members of the list:

I am very interested in finding out about the life and dynasty of
the Chola emperor "Raja Raja Chola Chola".  He had built a Siva
temple about 1,000 years ago, with 1008 lingams; it is still in
use.  Can anyone direct me towards materials that would outline 
his life and times?

Many thanks in advance,
Om Namasivaya
