Subject: uttara-mImAMsA???
Message-ID: <161227019393.23782.13432126317773910734.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A question for those familiar with the literature of advaita vedAnta: Do 
any of the classical advaitins refer to what they are doing, or to 
themselves as a school of thought, as uttara-mImAMsA?  It is often 
pointed out that the pUrva- and uttara-mImAMsAs are sister sytems, and 
were perhaps originally a single system.  But I don't recall coming 
across the term uttara-mImAMsA in any of the readings in advaita I've 
done.  Has anyone?  How about the vedAntasUtras, a.k.a. brahmasUtras?  Has 
anyone seen them being referred to as the uttaramImAMsAsUtras?

I know the term zArIraka-mImAMsA, but that is something else.

Thanks for your thoughts,

LN
