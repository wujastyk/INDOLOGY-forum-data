Hello to all

My name is Karl-Heinz Golzio. As I am working to establish a personel  
list to the critical edition of Max Weber's study on Hinduism and  
Buddhism I want to know the exact bio-dates of Carl Friedrich Koeppen  
(supposed dates: 1806-1863), author of "Die Religion des Buddha" and  
the French Jainologist Armand Albert Guerinot (year of birth: 1872).

Thanks in advance.
K.-H. Golzio
