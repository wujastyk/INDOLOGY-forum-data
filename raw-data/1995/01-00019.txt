You do not say if you want it for WP (WordPerfect?) for DOS or for
Windows. There are several good Sanskrit TTF fonts for Windows, but I
know of nothing satisfactory for WordPerfect for DOS.

One of the good TTF format fonts is available easily by FTP on

ftp.bcc.ac.uk

directory

/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology

The files name is

wnri-PSandTT.zip

All the best

John
