Subject: existence of a skt. word
Message-ID: <161227019468.23782.13948759826435967027.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The "Sanskrit" form  *yogyaacaarya is cited as equivalent to Pali
yoggaacariya (which does exist).  My question:  does this Skt. term
actually exist?  I have not been able to find it.
