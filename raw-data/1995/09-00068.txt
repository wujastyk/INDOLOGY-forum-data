There are at least two translations available. The one by Krishna Warrier
contains the Sanskrit text as well.  Mahadeva Sastri's translation is the
classic one, but since it was written at the turn of the century, is far
less readable. Both can be obtained by contacting your local Vedanta Society,
or by calling the one in L.A. (I do not have their number with me at this
time).
