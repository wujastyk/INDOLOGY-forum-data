Commenting on RgVeda I,51,1 Saayana hints at a story about Indra
approaching sage Medhaatithi in the shape of a ram (meSa) to drink his
soma, hence being called "ram" by that sage.

Gautama is also called Medhaatithi in Mahaabhaarata XII,267,45 in
connection with the episode of the violation of Ahalyaa by Indra. In the
same connection in RaamaayaNa I,48-49 Indra is cursed by Gautama to lose
his testicles, which are subsequently replaced by the gods with those of
a ram.

I dont know of any such stories connecting Indra with VasiSTha. However,
the latter is the most important member of the group of the seven RSis,
of which Gautama is also one, which might account for a possible
confusion.

I too would appreciate any more pertinent references on the subject.
