It might be interesting to note that Johannes Hertel in his Einleitung to
his Tantraakhyaayika says p. XXIV ? 2. Schreibung und Satzzeichen under 1
b: "Zischlaut, Upaadhmaaniiya und Jihvaamuuliiya verwende ich mit den
Handschriften statt des im eigentlichen Indien ueblichen Vsarga" (I am
using the sibilants, u?s and j?s as the MSS do instead of the of the usual
visarga in India itself) - he?s of course referring to the Kashmiri
recensions.
