I am no scholar of Julius Lipner's heights (recently appointed Director 
of Hinduja Research Centre on Ancient India at Cambridge) but I could add 
the following items, papers I have worked on on the Mimamsa doctrine of 
apaurusheya (critically against Nyaya and Vedanta watering down of the genuinely 'authorless' 
aspect. I find nothing incoherent, by the way, in this theory and it is 
consistent with Mimamsa commitment to the autonomous efficacy of rituals 
and mantras. (Diacritcs ellided).

- "On the Idea of Authorless Revelation (Apauruseya)"
In Roy W Perrett (ed.) INDIAN PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION, Dordrecht: Kluwer 
Academic Publishers, 1989, pp. 143-166.

in Cross-cultural Hermeneutics",

- " Fusion of Disparate Horizons" (Introduction)
in, P. Bilimoria (ed.) J N MOHANTY ESSAYS IN INDIAN PHILOSOPHY, Oxford

.[{THis is my critique of Prof Mohanty's position on Tradition.]

- See also Stephen Phillips Review of my SABDAPRAMANA: WORD & KNOWLEDGE 
in PHILOSOPHY EAST & WEST, APril 1995 (Issue devoted to Asian and 
Comparative Philosophy in Australia, which also carries an Introduction 
by yours truly).

last but not least, my article written with Prof Bimal K Matilal,

Hope this helps.
