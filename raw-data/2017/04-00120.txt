I don't think anybody has suggested an equivalence between works and
manuscripts, have they?  Thoughtfully-designed projects, like
Panditproject.org, and the Woolner Project database
<https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/smwc/smwc.cgi> and, outside our
field, Philobiblon <http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/philobiblon/> or Syriaca
<http://syriaca.org/work/609>, have the work-manuscript distinction in
their DNA.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
