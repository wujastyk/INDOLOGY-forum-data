Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help locating two Sanskrit scholars (c. 1750)
Message-ID: <CADaCuGdwzWTbGbC-bPGp_hK5ad1PN=_B6m5nCxTGG-zmefK+wA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I am trying to better locate two Sanskrit scholars from approximately 1750.

My source gives their locations only by region rather than city. It simply
gives:

   - Hal?yudha Brahmac?rin (Dravida)


   - Bh?skara Pa??ita (Maharashtra)

Might anyone know more about either of these two scholars? I?ve looked in a
number of places, including the NCC, but have not found any information.

I would like to connect them to a specific city rather than simply a
region.

Many thanks,
Sam

Rajgir, Bihar
