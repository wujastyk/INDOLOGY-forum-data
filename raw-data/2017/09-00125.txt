 Dr.Freschi,

               Thanks for your response. I would mention a link here ,which may be useful to you.



  www.historymuseum.ca/cma/exhibitions/civil/maya/mmc05eng.shtml.( Ref-Canadian Museum of History)



  I would also mention a line from the link,which goes as follows- 'That the Maya understood the value of 

zero is remarkable -most of world's civilisations had no concept of zero at that time'



      The moot point is that the Mayans may not be using zero as a place-value ,as efficiently as the 

Bakshali mms did, but ,if the issue is that of ORIGIN OF ZERO ,then, would be out of place to grant the 

Mayans this honour?
