Dear Jesse,

there is a translation into the Russian (by A. Ya. Syrkina, Moskva: Vostochnaya literatura, 1995 - I can send you a pdf, if you want).

There is also a Polish translation: Pie?? o Krysznie Pasterzu, transl. by Barbara Grabowska and Andrzej ?ugowski,  Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Akademickie Dialog, 1996).

As far as I know, there is no published academic translation into the Czech or Slovak languages.

There are probably other translations into Slavic languages produced by ISKCON, but I don't know them.

Best,
Lubomir
