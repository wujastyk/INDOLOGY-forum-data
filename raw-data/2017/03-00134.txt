Sorry for my delay in joining this conversation.

Thanks Sri Suresh garu for bringing those verses by Potana in Telugu.

That helps to understand not only the plural of ??vara, but even the
Bhagavata tradition's insider-view of that usage.

But your analogy of Nixon here in

Almost reminds us of Nixon's quote: "when the president does it, that means
it is not illegal." Did Nixon read BhP? :-)

damages that sensitivity to the insider's view.

We don't apply the limitations of or legalities or proprieties of human
world while studying /relishing the fantasy world or mythical world in the
literature of genres such as  mythological, sci-fi etc., do we?
