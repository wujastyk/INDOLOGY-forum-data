Subject: [INDOLOGY] krishnamacharya and 'inner wealth'
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrDEXJ468pt1m1-McLV4jYu6NfvVH9Nvh4wP1__dqP7z2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

At the top of page 16 from this English translation of Krishnamacharya's
"Yoga Makaranda", there is a list of four characteristics that he suggests
need to be attained through *yog?bhy?sa*, and which are said to comprise
*j??nam:*

http://terebess.hu/english/Yoga-Makaranda.pdf

The original text is written in Kannada (1934), and this English
translation (2006) is from the Tamil edition (1938). I haven't been able to
locate a copy of either the '34 or '38 editions.

I'm wondering if anyone might be able to tell me what the term is that he
uses for "inner wealth".

The three other characteristics are familiar to me, viz., *viveka*,
*vair?gya*, and *mumuk?utva*.

Thanks.

All the best,
