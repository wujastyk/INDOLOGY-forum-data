Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devanagari QWERTY Keyboard for Mac
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdReeNH7kNhhU3AzULk5VPwBoX=aBrZoByqEDyrCz5LBA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

     I am wondering if anyone has an editable file for the Devanagari
QWERTY keyboard for Mac.  It comes with the Mac OSX as part of a bundle,
and not as a separate keyboard file.  I want to be able to edit it with
Ukelely to fit it to my own needs.
    I would appreciate any help in this regard.  Thanks.
