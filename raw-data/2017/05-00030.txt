Dear Ashok et al.,

This seems to be referring primarily to Tibetan manuscript holdings; it is not at all
clear the Rahula's photographs of Skt. mss. are involved. And the idea of translating
a whole collection of Tibetan mss. into Hindi, without assessing the collection
in relation to on-going Tibetological work, merely reflects the regrettable ignorance on
the part of the concerned administration regarding what it is that they actually hold.

The Tibetan collection has been surveyed here:
David P. Jackson: The ?Miscellaneous series ? of Tibetan texts in the Bihar Research Society, Patna: A handlist. (Tibetan and Indo Tibetan Studies, 2.) [xiv], 271 pp. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1989. DM48
best,
Matthew
