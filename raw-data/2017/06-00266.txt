Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on the word "purapati"
Message-ID: <CALM2Y+q=VXo8g8_Tkdbq_MGPZy-6SWxHv8FVH+jfMixdUPGh_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have recently been puzzling over the Palam Baoli inscription from the
13th of August, 1276 CE. I am particularly interested in the term purapati
as it appears in this verse:

*?r?yogan?puram iti prathit?bhidh?ne *

*?hill?pure purapati suk?t? vabh?va |*

*?r?m?n a?e?agu?ar??ir apetado?o*

*dh?m?n udattamatir u??haran?madheya? ||13||*


Prasad translates it as "householder" in *The Inscriptions of the Delhi
Sultanate.* I was wondering if anything further could be said of the term,
or if anyone had seen this term in other inscriptions.


Any leads would be appreciated!


Thanks,


Luther Obrock
