To All,



          While going through the initial verse of SarvadarshanSamgraha,I came across the following line



    SHREESHANGARPANITANAYAMNIKHILAGAMAAGNYAM

         SARVAGNYAVISHNUGURUMANHAMASHREYAHAM.



 

  My query is two-fold-



 1)What is the implication of the word 'SHREE SHANGARPANITANAYAM?

 2) Does the word SarvaVishnuGurum imply any sort of Vaishnava Heridity on the part of MadhyaCharya? 



                               ALAKENDU DAS
