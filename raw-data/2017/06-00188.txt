A short interesting 'puranic' (in the broad sense) account which should be added about Pata?jali as author of both the Mah?bh??ya, the Yoga??stra and the Nid?na (viz. the Vedic Nid?na-s?tras, not the nid?na-sth?na of the medical  Caraka- or Su?ruta-sa?hit?) lays in the  introductory portion of the 11th cent. ?a?guru?i?ya's Ved?rthad?pik? (com. to the Sarv?nukrama??) dealing with lines of Vedic teachers related to K?ty?yana.
A provisory edition of the vv. 25-56ab of the text was provided by F. Max M?ller in his Hist. of Ancient Sanskrit Lit. 1859, 1860, pp. 236-239 - here p. 239/1-3 : https://archive.org/stream/historyofancient00mlle#page/238/mode/2up
for the passage on Pata?jali:
yatpra??t?ni v?ky?ni  bhagav??s tu pata?jali? |

vy?khyac ch??tanav?yena  mah?bh??ye<?>a har?ita? || 53

yog?c?rya? svaya? kart?  yoga??stranid?nayo? |

This reading ch??tanav?yena is not satisfactory (it should be something qualifying the mah?bh??ya, a word of which reading is also here problematic). Cf. the translation proposed by Max M?ller ibid. p. 235 (https://archive.org/stream/historyofancient00mlle#page/234/mode/2up ) + the variant readings he gives in the fn. of p. 239, and the ones + the conjectures provided by A. Weber in his Berlin Cat. of Sanskrit MSS I, 1853, pp. 12-14 (p. 14) (https://archive.org/stream/diehandschriften01preu#page/14/mode/2up , where the vv. 1-7 and 25-66 of the introduction are given). 

Because of the corrupt character of the introductory portion of ?a?guru?i?ya's commentary, Macdonell did not edit it with his edition of the Sarv?nukrama?? (1886; see what he says p. xxi : https://archive.org/stream/katyayana-sarvanukramani-saunaka-anuvakanukramani#page/n23/mode/2up ). Peter M Scharf told me in 2004 that he was preparing a critical edition of ?a?guru?i?ya's Ved?rthad?pik?, so there is some hope to get a better text of this introductory portion (which e.g. informs us about Brahma-k?rik?s composed by K?ty?yana) and the passage concerned with Pata?jali.

Best wishes,

Note 1: For the Nid?na-s?tras, see the crit. ed. by K. N. Bhatnagar, 1939 (repr. 1971): https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.407628/2015.407628.Nidana-Sutra#page/n37/mode/2up (= the page with the passage here concerned following Max M?ller's reading; the next page and a few other of the book are lacking in this scan). The chandoviciti (first) part of the  Nid?na-s?tra with two commentaries has been crit. ed. again in 2000 as "Chandoviciti? of Pata?jali" by B.R. Sharma & L.N. Bhatta, Tirupati: Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha.

Note 2: It seems that the misunderstanding (or mistranslation) of Max M?ller p. 235 fn. 7: "On these [YS] a commentary was written by Vy?sa, who might be called a descendant of  ??ntanu (https://archive.org/stream/historyofancient00mlle#page/234/mode/2up ) explains the following wrong statement (in Portuguese) about Pata?jali found at https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patandj?li and http://ocultura.org.br/index.php/Patanjali :"O comet?rio de Vyasa o define como descendente de Santanu"; which to my knowledge has no support  in the manuscript tradition of the Yoga??stra (it should be checked in Maas crit. ed. that I have not at hand).
