In the V?ddhayavanaj?taka, k?ut/k?uta has five occurrences. Two are found in Ch.67 on mi?rik?dhy?ya? (miscellaneous omens) which I translated recently.

67.12ab v?m??gakampo g?habha?gak?r? k?uta? svapak??d bhayam ?tanoti/
67.12cd yuddha? nar???? prakaroti yuddha? ruta? rutenaiva samanvita? ca//

"The trembling of the left limbs would cause the house to break. Sneezing would cause fear resulted from one?s allies. Quarrels and cries [of animals] accompanied [by nothing but] just cries would cause quarrels among men.?

67.25ab chardi jvaro ve??ajanasya n??a? y?ne vidhatte sukhasaukhyah?nim/
67.25cd ani??al?bha? prakaroty ari??a? gosa?k?uta? pr??ahara? hi y?tu?//

"Vomiting or fever (chardi[s]+jvara?) would bring about the loss (n??a? < n?so) of a loved one and the destruction of happiness and good fortune during the expedition. Getting an evil omen (ani??al?bha?) would result in untimely death (ari?ta? < ani??am). Sneezing of cows [would result in] the death of the traveler."


The edition is not entirely satisfactory, nor is my translation. The k?uta? in 67.12 does however seem to suggest a bodily action, hence, sneezing. I am now not so certain about the gosa?k?uta? in 67.25 now that you raised some doubts concerning the etymology of k?ut. But maybe cows do sneeze after all!

Best regards,

Could any Hindi-wallahs out there either confirm or deny its existence -- perhaps even throw light on its     etymology?
