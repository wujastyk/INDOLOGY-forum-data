> 
> This journal, which is the product of the Centre for the History of Religion in Asia at Cardiff University, had a rest period after the retirement of its editor, William Johnson.
> 
> I have since taken over the editorship. We have moved the journal to Cardiff University Press (all back issues are digitally available at http://cardiffuniversitypress.org/titles/journals/ <http://cardiffuniversitypress.org/titles/journals/>) and hope to continue the wonderful work done by Will in offering an outlet for shorter and longer translations of Asian literature, as well as articles and anything else innovative, brilliant or both that comes out way.
> 
> The first paper is a tribute to my marvellous colleague Will, which was co-authored with another of my marvellous colleagues, Simon Brodbeck.
> 
> The contents page is given below.
> 
> Enjoy!
> 
> Submissions should be sent to my university email address (hegartyj at cardiff.ac.uk <mailto:hegartyj at cardiff.ac.uk>). The journal is double blind peer reviewed.
