Message-ID: <CACP0xaXRrqRWQ9SaqGnUzKRTy3P1p=ZEsnS7B0=GV_JjCuQ84Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

The Muktabodha Indological Research Institute is celebrating its 20th
anniversary this year. As chair of Muktabodha's Academic Advisory Council,
I would like to extend a warm invitation from the Board of Directors to
join us for a celebratory tea in Boston, held in conjunction with the
annual American Academy of Religion Conference this November.

The tea will take place on Saturday, November 18, from 5:30-7:30 at the
Westin Copley Palace Hotel Newbury & Gloucester Rooms (10 Huntington Ave,
Boston, MA).

Please see attached invitation flyer for details.

Warm regards,
Mark
