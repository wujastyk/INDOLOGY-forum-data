Hello Vikram,

     This is a wonderful news.  Having done some font-designing myself, I
know how time-consuming and complicated this work is.  I hope your effort
is successful and produces an improved version of Sanskrit 2003, with
light, bold and italic versions.  Please keep us posted about availability
of these new versions.  With best wishes,

Madhav Deshpande
