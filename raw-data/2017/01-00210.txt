Dear David,

I was having the same problem connecting to DLI as you, but found a link in the Wikipedia article on DLI that works today. This is the URL:  http://www.new.dli.ernet.in

Best,

Elliot

Probably it was taken down from the Google Books website, like so many other books that Google has scanned. A different scan of it is available at Scribd, for those who have joined Scribd. Since this scan is lower resolution, I assume that it came from the Digital Library of India. I have not been able to check the Digital Library of India itself, because nowadays their servers are almost always down when I try to go to them. However, it is probably there. Sorry that I do not have access to either of these scans.
