Dear All,

I am trying to locate a PDF or a physical copy of the book titled *K?lid?sa:
Date, Life and Works* by V.V. Mirashi. I can see parts of it on Google
books, but I am looking for the complete version. It also looks like it is
out of print. Might someone have a PDF of the complete book or can someone
guide me towards where I can buy a copy in India. Thanks very much in
advance. Would really appreciate the help.

Best wishes.

Mrinal Kaul
