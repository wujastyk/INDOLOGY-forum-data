Subject: [INDOLOGY] New IAST keyboard layout for Linux
Message-ID: <027859d8-5baf-1532-9072-bd11f4f84f39@wwu.edu>

Dear colleagues,

Those of you who use Linux (or are considering making the switch), may 
like to know about a new keyboard layout I created for the X keyboard 
system.  It is based on, and works just like, Toshiya Unebe?s extremely 
convenient ?EasyUnicode? keyboard layout for OSX.

Details are here:

Best regards,

Michael
