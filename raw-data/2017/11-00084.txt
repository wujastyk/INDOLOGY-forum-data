Uddyota 1 is the only published volume. Kuppuswami Sastri died in 1943. The edition mentions other projects and failing health as factors in noncompletetion of this project. The published uddyota 1 is also available on archive.org <http://archive.org/>.

However, what I find is that the three or four different editions that I am consulting give very different readings, and this is very frustrating to say the least.  My question is:  Is there a critical edition of these texts that provides all manuscript variants, and provides a text that is more trustworthy?  The translation of Mason and Patwardhan is not accompanied by a Sanskrit text.  Any help would be appreciated.
