I believe it is originally from the Vayu Purana. Unfortunately time pressure prevents me from locating the exact reference.
Best,

 Subject: [INDOLOGY] A Pur??ic myth on N?rada and Urva??
  
DearProfessors and Collegues,
my name isOmar Abu Dbei and I am currently a PhD student under the supervision ofRaffaele Torella in Rome. 
Whileconsulting Vettam Mani?s?Pur??ic Encyclopaedia, I have found a reference, under the entry Urva?? (pp. 812-813), to a mythicalepisode that might be, under many respects, of the greatest interest for myresearch:

Once Agastya went to the durbar ofIndra. On the occasion Indra asked Urva?? to dance. In the midst of the danceshe saw Jayanta, the son of Indra, and became amorous and her steps went wrong.N?rada who was playing his famous lute called Mahat? could not play well.Agastya went angry and cursed Jayanta to become a bud. He cursed N?rada also.So his lute became the lute of the world. Urva?? was born on the earth underthe name M?dhav? due to the curse.?Unfortunately,no Sanskrit source is recorded and, not being a specialist myself in the fieldof Pur??as, I have been unable so farto find any possible one. Is there anybody who knows the exact source of this myth?
Many thanks for your attention.
Kind regards,
Omar Abu Dbei
