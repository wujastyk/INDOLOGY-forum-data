Dear Shyam,

in such a case, a normal starting point would be any standard reference work. I would recommend e.g. Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism. The main article on this topic, Karen Pechilis' entry "Gender" (vol. 4, pp. 788-805), has an extensive and up-to-date bibliography. Plus this theme is discussed in several other entries in this Encyclopedia (they are easily to be found using an index).

Best,
Lubomir
