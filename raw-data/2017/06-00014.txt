O? namo k?mr? des k?m?khy? dev?

Tah?? base ism?il jog?


Ism?il jogi ke t?n be??


Ek to?e ek picho?e


Ek ??t tij?r? go?e


------------------------

Let us try the outward meaning:


Om Namo (Well known beginning of such rituals, spells etc. ) (Om, the
Vedic syllable, namah, literally, bowing =obedience) , expression of
worshiping attitude

----

k?mr? des k?m?khy? dev?

(Let me remember, focus on , concentrate on ) k?m?m?khy?d?v? of k?mr?p region

Note: In the magecian's /spell-healer's patter/formulaic recitation,
mention of the Devi forms , particularly of nearby region is a
convention.

In south India, such rural rustic practitioners usually mention
k?m?k?? of k??c?, m?n?k?? of madurai, vi??l?k?? of k??? (v?ra????) as
a beginning of their ritual /spell event. They may add a few more
Devis.

-------

Tah?? base ism?il jog?


= Ismail Jogi who lives (base) there (t?h?m)


------


Ism?il jogi ke t?n be??

There are three sons to Ismail Jogi


-------

Ek to?e ek picho?e


Ek ??t tij?r? go?e


This part of the riddle, I give up. Ek =one ??t = cool , cold


----?????----
