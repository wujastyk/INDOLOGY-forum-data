Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mega sale of select publications of the French Institute of Pondicherry/ 16thOct2017-15thNov2017

I'm afraid advertising is not permitted in the INDOLOGY forum.  Even of
academic books.  Authors are free to mention their own new publications,
but publishers may not promote their lists.

Members are asked to ignore the post by Anurupa Naik.
