Dear Jonathan,

last year I went through du?svapna and ari??a sections in many texts (mostly Brahmanical), but I don't remember anything similar to your story.

An Indian stock of bad dreams and other omens is rather limited, many of them have long history from Vedic texts upto late medieval nibandhas. It seems that this dream (a monkey/hermaphrodite becoming a king) does not belong to this stock.

The only positive information I can give you is that when a monkey is seen in a dream, it is a du?svapna signalling some disaster, usually a death of the dreaming person (e.g. there are a few verses saying this in Jagaddeva's Svapnacint?ma?i).

It could be useful to have a look at Ball?lasena's Adbhutas?gara, it's a treasury of different omens common in India. I didn't read the full text (it's very long), so there's a chance you will find what you are looking for in this text (if you didn't check it yet).

Best,
Lubomir
