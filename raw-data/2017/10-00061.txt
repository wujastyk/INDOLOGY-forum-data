There is also in the Divy?vad?na, in the A?oka legend cycle, the story of the Gift of the Half Mango (pp. 430-32 ed. Cowell - Neil: https://archive.org/stream/pts_divyvadnacol_3720-0688#page/n445/mode/2up , here = ? same text as Kuma?rala?ta's Kalpana?man?d?itika? Dr?s?t?a?ntapan?kti, ed. L?ders pp. 149-150). I suppose that the text is translated by J. S. Strong in The Legend of King A?oka: A study and translation of the A?ok?vad?na, Princeton UP, 1983, Delhi: Motilal (Buddhist Tradition series 6), 1989. I do not think that the translation is in J. Tatelman, The Heavenly Exploits: Buddhist biographies from the D?vyavad?na, vol. 1, New York, The Clay Sanskrit Library, 2005 ; but maybe it will be in A. Rotman, Divine Stories: Divy?vad?na, Part 2, Boston: Wisdom Publications (Classics of Indian Buddhism series), 2017  (Part 1 issued in 2008).

> J?taka 186 (Dadhiv?hanaj?taka) A mango seed (?bone?) is planted in royal garden and watered with milk water and in the third year it yielded fruit. Now it was given all care: watering it with milk water, giving it auspicious wreaths, throwing garlands around it, lighting it by burning fragrant oil and putting a shroud around it. It?s fruits were sweet and golden yellow. When the king sent a fruit to other kings, he let pierce with a ma??u prickle the part of the seed where the sprout starts, and thus they could not grow new mangos. In order to make the fruits bitter, the wicked gardener planted nimba trees and paggava creepers around it and eventually the fruits went bitter. To correct it the king let all nimbas and paggavas to be removed and also the bitter earth to be removed, put on sweet earth instead and let the tree be watered with milk water, sugar water and fragrant waters. Thus it became sweet again.

First thing which comes to my mind is the well-known story of the "Mango miracle" which the 12th cent. Periya Pur??am attributes to K?raikk?l Ammaiy?r (one of the 63 Tamil Shaiva saints, who may have lived in the 6th century.

See the pointer to a popular modern retelling of the story (as a movie)

One of the first things I'm setting out to do is learn as much as possible about mangoes in Indian history or philosophy or travelogue,   or any texts. I wished to explore mangoes as metaphor, as ingredient, as mudra or prose.
