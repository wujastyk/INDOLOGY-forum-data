Dear all,

I've managed to get the article from a reprint in Bhattacharyya's Studies
in Indian Poetics (1964). Here <https://we.tl/FTlKE1Ks7r> is the link to
download the article, in case someone else is interested. @Arlo Griffiths:
thank you, but unfortunately the Biodiversity Heritage Library does not
cover that year.

Best,
