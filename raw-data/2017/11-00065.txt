Subject: [INDOLOGY] The symbolism of lion and tiger
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf8xr9kvNEOUTkZJx_+202Y66mOUPNOJ=CFMP8CUV2ox8w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear indologists,

May anyone suggest me any study on the symbolism of tiger and lion (more
specifically on their association with Durga [Kali, Parvati, etc.] and with
kingship)?

With the best wishes,
Paolo
