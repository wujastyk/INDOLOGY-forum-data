Message-ID: <CAHxuC0SLepkMCOZqVchO=PL1vvTVLQwXUdKLzn_VEKSqur=mAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Wanted to share a new essay: "Thinking and Counter-Thinking: On 'Classical
India'" which appears in the February issue of Guftugu, (www.guftugu.in), a
quarterly e-journal of poetry, prose, conversations, images and videos run
by the Indian Writers? Forum.

In earlier issues of Guftugu you will find essays on language, literature,
criticism, civilisation, culture and related matters of interest to this
list by Romila Thapar, K. Satchidanandan, Githa Hariharan, Ritu Menon,
Shashi Deshpande and others.

I hope you enjoy the piece, and find it worth your while exploring and
engaging with other materials on this very interesting and relatively new
site.

All best,

Ananya Vajpeyi
