I would like to thank Ulrich Timme Kragh for his ongoing efforts to locate this article and make a scan for me. If he succeeds and allows wider sharing,. I?ll offer the scan on line.

>> I?m looking for a pdf of an article by Jan Sz. Otrebski in Lingua Posnaniensis 5. Manfred Mayrhofer mentions in Kurzgefasstes Etymologisches W?rterbuch des Altindischen, that Otrebski argued on page 174 against connection with Lithuanian spangus and Serbo-Croatian bangav. Unfortunately, I cannot trace the name of the article. The publication date was probably in the 1950s.
