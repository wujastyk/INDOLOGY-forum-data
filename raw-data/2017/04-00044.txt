There are several illustrated *G?t?* and *Pa?caratna* manuscripts in the
Wellcome Library's collection (wellcomelibrary.org, wellcomeimages.org).
For details see the indexes of illustrations in the two vols. of my *Handlist.
 *The library is academic-friendly, and may not even charge you for
high-res OpenAccess images.

If memory serves, Ursula King made a study of *Bhagavadg?t?*  MS images,
many years ago. (found it: King, Ursula (1982). "The iconography of
the *Bhagavad
Gita*." *Journal of Dharma* 7 (2):146-163.)

Best,
Dominik
