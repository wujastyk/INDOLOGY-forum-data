Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bhaskara Brahmasutrabhasyam PDF

Dear Colleagues,

I find myself away from my library and in need of a PDF of Bh?skar?c?rya's
Brahmas?trabh??ya (ed. V.P. Dvivedin. Benares: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Book
Depot, 1903). A later edition would also be fine.

Thanks to Indology-L members for being a veritable *kalpataru *of Sanskrit
e-texts.

Sincerely,
Andrew
