Subject: [INDOLOGY] Questioning South Asia Conference

The mere geographical (geopolitical?) expressions of ? Central/South/Southeast/East Asia ? are no less artificial, constructed and arbitrary than the boundaries of the modern nation states?especially when dealing with premodern phenomena (something that has been pointed out by Pollock indeed). Much has been written on this issue in the past two or three decades, yet it is somehow depressing to see how this body of research (mostly produced by global historians, but also by Area Studies scholars) seems to have had a rather limited impact on the tightly compartmentalized ? Area Studies ? paradigm  (except, perhaps, the creation of some ? Indian Ocean ? research initiatives), not to speak about the fields of Indology and/or South Asian studies. I cannot but agree with Prof. Slaje?s invitation to reflect on the institutional history of our subject(s), their (geo)political implications, etc.

>> [Announcement excerpt]
>> "The geopolitical significance of South Asia has been a well-known fact in policy and security studies for the last several decades. In academic circles too, the logic of South Asia has become a naturalized reality: its appearance in the area studies departments of many US/western institutions signals acquiescence if not participation in an agenda informed by pursuit of global hegemony. The naturalisation of South Asia as a discourse recalls European precedents of producing knowledge about the ?other? in order to foster a morally and epistemologically superior European identity ? as witnessed in the historical invention of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. [...] Questioning South Asia as a discourse that at present burdens the scholarly imagination, and overdetermines conference agendas and research funding, might reconfigure the strategies we employ to understand the region. Some of the questions we seek to investigate are: What are the obstacles to developing comparative research perspectives for scholars constrained by ?South Asia?? How can we shift away from the dominant framework of South Asia as an already-determined category, and devise new research agendas? And what demands for change, transformation, or recalibration might this place on us as subjects undertaking research?"
