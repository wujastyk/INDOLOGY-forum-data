"The quality of India's -military strength was seen very soon after
Alexander's return and death, when Seleucus attempted another invasion. He
was defeated by Chandragupta and driven back. Indian armies then had an
advantage which others lacked; this was the possession of trained
war-elephants, which might be compared to the tanks of to-day. Seleucus
Nikator obtained 500 of these war-elephants from India for his campaign
against Antigonus in Asia Minor in 302 B.C., and military historians say
that these elephants were the decisive factor in the battle which ended in
the death of Antigonus and the flight of his son Demetrius."

-- Discovery of India, pp 115

Focus is only on Nehru's awareness of wars in ancient India; not on the
historical validity of facts mentioned in this dated book .
