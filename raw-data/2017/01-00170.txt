Subject: [INDOLOGY] Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit / A. M. Ruppel
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdrqhidmN2xdoiaXPpUaEgisqXaBZ=LmvpW4X87WjQd_A@mail.gmail.com>

This book comes out in March this year, but there are already videos
<http://cambridge-sanskrit.org/video-resources/> at Youtube to support the
course, and a lot of other pedagogical materials at a dedicated website
<http://cambridge-sanskrit.org/>.  I haven't seen the book yet, but this
all looks promising.  The book is priced reasonably.

Has anyone else had a chance to evaluate the book yet?

Best,
Dominik
