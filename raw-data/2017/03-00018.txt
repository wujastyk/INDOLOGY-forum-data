Mudr?:? A Study of Symbolic Gestures in Japanese? Buddhist 
Sculpture, by Dale Saunders, says this:
"It is? certain that the ritual gesture we now as the mudr? existed even 
before the? organization of Buddhism into a religious system.? Its use in the 
Veda is attested, while? its presence in the magical rites of primitive 
Buddhism is undeniable.? The appearance of mudr? in Tantrism? constitutes, we may 
say a sort of renaissance of the earlier gestures, probably? blurred during 
the first centuries A.D.? Nevertheless, it is probably that the mudr? was 
used in uncodified rites? as early as that period, though the question of its 
exact ritual value is at? present unsolved." (p. 31) 

Can anyone point me to the earliest evidence for the use of mudras in South Asia?
Thanks,
