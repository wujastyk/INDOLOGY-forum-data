In connection with the Indus Civilization issue, some may be interested to know that one of the Padma award recipients this year is Michel Danino, who is a Guest Professor at IIT, Gandhinagar (http://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/humanities/michel.htm <http://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/humanities/michel.htm>, with a link to his publications). He is also a member of ICHR, nominated by the current Indian Government.
