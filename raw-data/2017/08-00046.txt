Dear Shyam,

Here's a couple of references from the journal Religions of South Asia (RoSA), of which I'm 
one of the editors:

Saswati Sengupta and Sharmila Purkayastha: "Of Famines and Females: The Politics of 
Laksmi Bratakathas of Bengal"  RoSA 10.2 (2016) pp. 172-192. (gender politics, including 
role of religion in oppressing women, and of women in maintaining religion)

Ruth Vanita: "Full of God: Ashtavakra and ideas of justice in Hindu texts" RoSA 3.2 (2009) 
pp. 167-181. (involves female-to-female impregnation and other gender-bending 
mythological events)

Also;

Alf Hiltebeitel & Kathleen M. Erndl (ed.) Is the goddess a feminist? the politics of South Asian 
goddesses. New York University Press, 2000

I may think of more later, but I'm sure others will know these and many more.

Dear all,
This is a question from a colleague who is not on the list. This colleague teaches a course on 
Sex and Gender theory and is interested in articles that addresses the topic from differing 
cultural vantages. I was asked about what was available on the topic that discusses the issue 
from the perspective of the Indian tradition. I didn't know what to say. I'd be grateful for any 
suggestions.
Thanks,
Shyam
