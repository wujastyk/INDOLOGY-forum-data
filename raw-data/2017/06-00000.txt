Subject: [INDOLOGY] The pre-natal/pre-incarnatory curse in Indian literature (Sivan Goren Arzony)
Message-ID: <CAPPg1ZxSN1tzg7yvN8KP_Ny3QLKc0umkPsfAvAH_PeSM=aTZbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear James and other list members

This is indeed a fascinating subject!

I am working on a Ma?iprav?l?am camp? from medieval Kerala (roughly
14th century), called the U??iy???caritam. The heroine of this poem is
a dancer called U??iy???, who was born on earth as a consequence of a
curse that Rohi?? cast on an apsaras called Pr?vr??. This Pr?vr?? had
a love affair with the moon, which got Rohi?? quite angry..

I think that as a sub-category, apsarases tend to get cursed often.

Another interesting case from Andhra is brought by Velcheru Narayana
Rao in his article 'Purana as Brahminic Ideology" (a chapter in Wendy
Doniger's 1993 "Purana Perennis").

I would love to see any comparative work, when one materializes.

All the best,

Sivan Goren Arzony
