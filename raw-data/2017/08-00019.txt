Patrick,

Why do you give credence to all such fantasies and spend serious research
time to work on them?

All beliefs that someone, some religion, some nation, some ideology can
rule the whole world are fantasies.

""The Bhagwa flag has existed and guided the Vedic society right from its
origin. It has inspired and has been honored by the Vedic Saints and
heroes. In ancient times, the warriors used to put on saffron robes and go
to the battlefield. If they are victorious, they will rule and if
vanquished, they might die on the battlefield and thus go to heaven--such
was the motivating force for the heroes.""

is a fantasy about the past.
