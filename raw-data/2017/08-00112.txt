Copyright. No, that's wrong, Tim.  Owning copyright is one thing, but the
JAOS and other journals will routinely give each author a license form to
sign, and the terms of that license typically take away the author's right
to disseminate their work freely.  Owning copyright only "works" if you
don't sign away your rights.   I retained copyright of my *Roots of
Ayurveda* book with Penguin Delhi, but the contract I signed with them
basically took away all my rights, leaving my copyright ownership
meaningless.  And I've seen many licensing agreements from journal
publishers that do exactly this too.

The fees structure of the AOS membership is enlightened indeed, ... for
people like you and me.  But for almost all classical scholars in India
even the minimum fee, Rs 3000, is a very large sum indeed, and remember
that most of them will only be professionally interested in one or two
articles per issue and will never be able to attend AOS meetings.  So it's
Rs3000 for, say three or four articles in a year.  That puts the journal
completely out of reach.  And they can't read it on JSTOR either.

But none of this meets the fundamental objection about why a reader should
pay to read the results of research funded by publicly-funded institutions.



It's regrettable that OLH has not attracted the attention it deserves, and
I warmly applaud your involvement.  But as a project, it is well-conceived,
I believe, and the model it is emulating, PLOS, has been a roaring success
in the sciences.  So it may be a matter of time and publicity.  Did I say
publicity?

Best,
Dominik
