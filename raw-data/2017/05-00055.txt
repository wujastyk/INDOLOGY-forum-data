Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ismail Jogi mantra
Message-ID: <CALNcvFtS83Su=Ugj+qRohZ2YtopS5UtUBQKo3Sv6rhd-NBeaXw@mail.gmail.com>

Five years ago I sent to the List this question:

<< Mantras in popular Indian magic books - of indrajala type - invoke often
two mysterious personages: Ismail Jogi and Nuna/Nona/Luna/Lona Chamarin.

Has anyone written a paper on them. A monograph - perhaps?>>

?There was no answer.


One such mantra runs as follows:



*O? namo k?mr? des k?m?khy? dev?*


*Tah?? base ism?il jog?*


*Ism?il jogi ke t?n be??*


*Ek to?e ek picho?e*


*Ek ??t tij?r? go?e*



I am not sure about the meaning of this mantra.


Ismail Jogi (contradictio in adiecto) had three sons:


one aborted (?), one retarded (?)


one coolly (?) in your (?) womb.



I would be grateful for your comments,
