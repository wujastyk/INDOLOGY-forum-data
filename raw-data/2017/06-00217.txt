Friends:

I need help in identifying and finding the correct reading of a verse ascribed in a manuscript I am reading to Vy?sa:


????????????????????? ? ? ????????????? ?? ?

???????????? ?????? ? ??????? ? ??????? ?

My manuscript is dark and unclear. I am not sure of ?viraumyeva? and ka?cic ch??oti? (which could also be ka?cid v??oti?). Any help greatly appreciated. With best wishes,

Patrick
