Subject: [INDOLOGY] email contact with Hartmut Scharfe?
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cf0uC0U5+O=M1kUD=+tjgvN+qkRJmZXtUfP1kMRLC6veQ@mail.gmail.com>

I used to correspond with Hartmut via an address @peoplepc.com, but now
that address does not work.

If anyone is in touch with Hartmut, could you ask him to contact me
(wujastyk (at) ualberta.ca)?

With thanks,
Dominik
