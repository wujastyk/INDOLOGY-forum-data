Dear Madhav and Tim,

Thank you Madhav for your good suggestion about Atharva?iras and
Atharva??r?a. Thank you Tim for your qualifying comments about this idea.
Even after considering it for a couple of days, I am still not clear about
it.

I understand the *V?caspatyam*'s definition of nirv??a-mastaka, nirv??am
nirv?tir mastakam iva yatra, as saying that this nirv??a is like the head.
Whereas, in the second verse you quoted, Tim, the construal is atharva?a?
?iro, the head of atharvan. But we cannot say for nirv??a-mastaka, the head
of nirv??a. Is this the point?

In any case, until we can find a textual source for nirv??a-mastaka, we do
not know how or in what context it is used.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
