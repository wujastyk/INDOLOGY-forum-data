This is I know very late in this conversation, but female regents were standard in Rajput states, as I learned for the first time a few years ago at a symposium at the Library of Congress on Indian royal women. ?If the heir was a boy, his mother became the regent while one of her brothers from her native state would come to assist her. ?Were similar systems found in India earlier?
This raises an interesting issue with comparative implications. ?As we know, some European policies allowed female inheritance of a throne and some did not. ?E.g. France had the Salic late but the usual regent of a boy king was his mother, and the usual regent while the king was out of his kingdom was his wife. ?Why in such cases were women considered competent in terms of skill, willpower, etc. to rule a state but not to inherit one? Because of the direct or symbolic association of rule with active, in-person miltary leadership in the field?
