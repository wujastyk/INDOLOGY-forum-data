Dear Artur,
I am not sure if I actually sent the following suggestion to you and the list when you earlier posted a similar query, since several months later I stumbled across my reply in the Drafts box, but here it is again. ?Have you tried the chancery of the Patriarch of Goa?. ?It has a website and emails for various offices and officials.
I also wonder whether a paper letter might get more attention than an email.

I cooperate with the (Polish) Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography in preparing for publication a list of the most important buildings/monuments in the world. I want to include in the list several Goan Roman-Catholic churches.?
The most important of them is the?Immaculate Conception Church in Panjim.
Now, the church's latin/romanized Konkani name is (according to Wikipedia):
Nixkollounk Gorb-Sombhov Saibinnich Igorz.?
Since I need to present the name in its transliterated and transcribed form, I'd have to have it also as it is written in the Goan-Konkani devanagari script.?
Almost two weeks ago I asked for help a Goan Catholic priest. I also addressed the Indradhanush (Word Net Project) at?
http://indradhanush.unigoa.ac.in/public/webcontent/webcontent.php?id=38
I asked them to kindly add the names of several other important Goan Churches in both the romanized and devanagari Konkani.?
I have no answer from them.?
Have I, by any chance, broken some unwritten rule - by asking to send me the formal names of several Goan churches - in Latin and Devanagari script?

Dear List,?
I would be very grateful if someone of you would give me address of a person/organization that would want to devote a bit of their time to fulfill my request,?
Thanking you in advance,?
