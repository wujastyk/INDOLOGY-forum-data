Subject: [INDOLOGY] Siddhantakaumudi unicode in XML
Message-ID: <CADSGPzWbQ5Lmk6Nfh6dqsDyaHeiPuwOC7hx3+tufvQcx72Ak+w@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies for cross posting.

Dear all,

I had been searching for Siddhantakaumudi in unicode for quite some time.
Online resources of Paninian grammar usually had commentaries like
Balamanorama available, but not original.
I recently got one copy of SK from Mr. H. N. Bhat via mailing list
Bharatiyavidvatparishat.

After certain cleanups and addition of markups, SK unicode is being
presented for computational purposes in XML format for further
modifications.

(Click on Download button to download)

Issues regarding markups / features etc may be noted in
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/siddhantakaumudi/issues.

This is the github location where future correction to this XML file will
be made. Git is chosen so that version changes are captured properly.

Regards,
