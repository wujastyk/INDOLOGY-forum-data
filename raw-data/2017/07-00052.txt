Gladly:

2.  http://www.brill.com/brill-open-0.  Brill also allows for proofs (not
the final publication) to be uploaded on academia.edu.
3.  No processing fee.
4.  Yes, Brill owns the right, but permissions for reprint are rather
easily granted:  http://www.brill.com/about/policies/rights-permissions
