I appreciate that. I admired that even.

'Understanding expressions such as 5000 as such symbolic expressions and
not ridiculing the user of such expressions for historical inaccuracy,
more, not attributing motives to such usages, is a healthy tendency' is
what I said.

when I said "symbolic" I didn't mean that "5000" is a necessarily a claim
for great antiquity.  Often it is, but sometimes things are older than
"5000".   I mean that "5000" is - strictly - not a number, but a feeling.
