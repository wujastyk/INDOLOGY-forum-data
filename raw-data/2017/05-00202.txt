Thanks, Lubomir. Very interesting. It looks like the scan of this
particular volume at Archive.org is the scan that I made. Happy to see it
more widely available. The original that I used to make the scan from is
held at the library of the University of California at Los Angeles. My
thanks to them and to Archive.org.

Best regards,
