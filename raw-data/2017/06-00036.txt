Subject: [INDOLOGY] Issues with Sanskrit 2003 font
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdnMQ80fmSEqjqP8WyW=fXKf_ZveQAmCj0QGeUCv+o9_A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

with characters like sign for short "i".  Here are a few sample lines:

     Am I alone in seeing these problems, or is this happening only on Mac
computers, and not on Windows?  I have written to Omkarananda Ashram about
this and I am hoping to hear from them.
    If someone has a solution to this font problem, I would appreciate
hearing it.
