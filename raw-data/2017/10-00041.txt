Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bhagavad Gita, title and intertitles
Message-ID: <HE1PR0202MB26510226E62007D515692CE9EC710@HE1PR0202MB2651.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,
When did intertitles (titles of the 18 chapters) in the Bhagavad Gita first appear?
Even more, from where comes the title 'Bhagavad Gita'? (Pardon if I'm an ignorant and should know.)

Could someone kindly suggest literature on these topics?

Kind regards,
Jon Skarpeid
