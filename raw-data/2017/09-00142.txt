The kind of book to find (and try to copy) in a good library of Kerala.
Only one edition for this collection of (14) short Sanskrit pieces by A.R. Rajaraja Varma (Trivandrum: [Samskrta] Bhaskara Press, 1904, 77 pp. ) as confirmed by K.H. Subramanian, Kerala Panini and Sanskrit works, New Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2008, pp. 34-45, who details the contents (noteworthy is the Udd?la Caritam, a prose rendering of Shakespeare's Othello, and the one-act play Gairv???vijaya, dealing with the eagerness on the part of English to subjugate Sanskrit-Gairv???, and the final triumph of the latter  ? a bit about these two works, which were previously published separately [1898 and 1889 respectively], is also to be found in K.M. George's booklet, in the 'Makers of Indian Literature' series, A. R. Rajaraja Varma, New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, 1979, pp. 48-50, without references).
