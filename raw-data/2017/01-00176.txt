Subject: [INDOLOGY] HTML definition of Unicode characters for r and l with "underring"?

Thanks to Suresh Kolichala and Dominik Wujastyk. Should I ever have difficulties handling the "ring below" characters I now know where to turn.

Coming back to my question:
I was looking for HTML (not HEX) definitions of r- and l- with ring below of the type

&#7680; (for CAPITAL LETTER "A" WITH RING BELOW).

This HTML definition is built on the DECIMAL code ("7680"), not the HEX code ("1E00") for that character. Allan Wood's lists give both where available (see here: http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/latin_extended_additional.html)<http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/latin_extended_additional.html%29,>.

As indicated, Gandhari Unicode has fixed definitions for the said r- and l- characters. This made me wonder whether they ever were "canonized", like so many other out-of-the-way characters that started as "private".

Apologies for not using the canonical language.


R.G.

r with dot below is defined as a combined glyph: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1e5b/index.htm  Similarly r + line below.

But ring below is - as you observe correctly - not in the unicode standard as a single glyph.  See, e.g., this list<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/r.htm>.  The letter r + ring below is, as others have said, still fully achievable and fully Unicode, but it has to be rendered with a combination of the two glyphs r and the non-spacing ring below.

The canonical list of names from the Unicode website is here: http://unicode.org/charts/charindex.html .  Search for "ring below" to see what is, and what isn't available.

Best,
Dominik

Dear list members,
I would be much obliged for any information concerning the current HTML definitions for (vocalic) r, R, l, and L, long and short, with underring (not underdot).
The definitions I found some years ago (e.g., &#59444; for R-underring and &#59445 for r-underring) do not seem to be valid anymore.
I have searched Alan Wood's site, but in vain.

Thanks in advance
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
