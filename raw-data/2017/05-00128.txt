Dear Peter-Daniel,

I don't know if this is of any use to you but the Gokarna collection of
vedic manuscripts (photographic facsimiles of about 250 manuscripts ) has
many manuscripts with double lines separating the text and the margins in
different styles.  (and manuscripts without lines separating the text from
the margins.)

See: www.muktabodha.org and click on digital library tab.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
Manager, Muktabodha Digital Library
