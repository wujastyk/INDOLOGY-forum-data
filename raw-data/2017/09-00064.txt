Dear list members,

I would be very thankful if anyone could direct me to any biographical etc sources on Vaidyanaatha Tatsat, who - among many other texts - has composed the Ala.mkaaracandrikaa on the Kuvalayaananda. The NCC (vol 32) lists a great variety of texts attributed to the author, none of which (apart from the above) is available to me. It mentions further that he was a son of someone Raamacandra (this info is, in fact, found in the concluding verses of the Ala.mkaaracandrikaa) and grandson of Vi.t.thala Bha.t.ta . Any clues on these?
Any hints for possible directions of inquiry would be very much appreciated!

best regards,
Andrey Klebanov
