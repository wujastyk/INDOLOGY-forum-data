In the Viveka Cudamani, Shankara speaks of four attainments starting with verse 18. There are viveka, vair?gya, and mumuk?utva,
The fourth is ?am?di?a?sampatti, or, ?a?sampatti, the six attainments: (i) ?ama; (ii) dama ; (iii) uparama; (iv) titiks?a; (v) ?raddh?; (vi) sam?dh?na

Best,
Dean

Dear Friends,?
At the top of page 16 from this English translation of Krishnamacharya's "Yoga Makaranda", there is a list of four characteristics that he suggests need to be attained through yog?bhy?sa, and which are said to comprise j??nam:
http://terebess.hu/english/Yoga-Makaranda.pdf
The original text is written in Kannada (1934), and this English translation (2006) is from the Tamil edition (1938). I haven't been able to locate a copy of either the '34 or '38 editions.?
I'm wondering if anyone might be able to tell me what the term is that he uses for "inner wealth".
The three other characteristics are familiar to me, viz., viveka, vair?gya, and mumuk?utva.?
Thanks.
All the best,
