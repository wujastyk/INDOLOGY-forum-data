Dear Mark,

as far as I know, there is no comprehensive work dealing with orality/literacy question in India comparable to the volume we have on Iran (Orality and Textuality in the Iranian World, ed. by Julia Rubanovich, Brill 2015). I would recommend to your student to go through this excellent work (at least for methodological reasons).

I think the best starting point for India might be Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, Sound and Communication (De Gruyter 2011). It's very vast (probably unnecessarily too vast) and sometimes rather technical book, but there are chapters dealing with some of the questions which your student is asking and the book has very extensive bibliography.

There are, of course, many special studies on different aspects of orality/literacy problem in India (mostly on Vedic culture, but not only, see e.g. Danuta Stasik, The Oral vs. the Written: A Few Notes on the Composition of Tuls?d?s?s R?mcaritm?nas, Rocznik Orientalistyczny 69 (2016): 20?30; or C. J. Fuller, Orality, Literacy and Memorization: Priestly Education in Contemporary South India, Modern Asian Studies 35.1 (2001): 1?31). 
More general is Ludo Rocher, Orality and Textuality in the Indian Context, Sino-Platonic Papers 49 (1994).

Best,
Lubomir
