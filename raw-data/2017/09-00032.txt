Subject: [INDOLOGY] Passing of Professor Luis Gomez
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdn1qr2RdS5AnAaLO8+TwTP6_ptQe+8hs+6sUjcvsgirg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

     It is my sad duty to inform you that my colleague and a long time dear
friend Professor Luis Gomez passed away yesterday in Mexico City.  He was a
leading scholar of Buddhist Studies and a wonderful teacher.  He and I read
many Sanskrit Buddhist texts together, and shared in common dozens of
students at the University of Michigan.  His memories will always be alive
with me.
