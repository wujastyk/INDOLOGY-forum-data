Dear everyone,

As part of my doctoral project, I commissioned the digitization of a 
microfilm of a V?kyapad?ya manuscript (Prak?r?ak??da) held at the 
Bodleian in Oxford. It's a paper manuscript in Telugu script. The 
digital images are now online at the Digital Bodleian website, available 
here:

I've also done a diplomatic transcription of the Dravyasamudde?a 
section, from folio 37 verso, line 2, to folio 41 verso, line 2, and 
this transcription is available here:

https://saktumiva.org/wiki:dravyasamuddesa:09-oxford

Each page break (rendered as a big orange "L") is a link that takes you 
to the the corresponding digital image. I've checked the transcription a 
few times, but there are bound to be mistakes still; please let me know 
if you find any. The transcript can also be viewed in Telugu script by 
using the tools on the right-hand side of the page, or alternatively, 
like this:

I haven't yet found a Telugu font that supports the old-style 
post-consonantal reph (valapagilaka); does anyone know of such a font?

Have an awesome day,

Charles
