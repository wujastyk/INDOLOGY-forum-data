Dear Colleagues,

     In my Manjushree-CSX font, I had designed characters like r and l with
a small circle underneath to represent ? and ??.  This was the usage in
Wackernagel's Altindische Grammatik as seen in the extract below.

     Since I can no longer use the Manjushree-CSX font today,  I am
wondering if there any Unicode fonts that are able to produce such
diacritics?  Any suggestions?
