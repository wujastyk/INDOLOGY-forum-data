Subject: [INDOLOGY] bhikkhu - monk

Dear List,



A problem ? probably already solved, many times over, but - recurring, sort
of obstinate.



Now, in texts describing the first days after the Buddha?s Awakening there
appears term *bhikkhu* (*bhikkhave*) ? usually translated as ?monk?
(?monks?).


The typical dictionary definition of the word ?monk? is: ?man in a *religious
order* who lives a life of poverty, chastity and obedience?.



At that early period there was no Buddhist order, not yet. Prof. Stanis?aw
F. Michalski would use in his pre-war Polish translations the word ??ebrak?
(?almsman?, ?beggar?). More appropriate, certainly, but sounding not too
well ? considering the sort of, typically aggresive beggars appearing on
the streets all over the world.



?Monk? (?monks?) seems to prevail, in Poland and everywhere else.


But, my students ask me: the first sermon and its addressees ? a *group of
five monks* ? had they been already made members of the *Buddhist order*?
When and how was that order established?


Respects,
