Subject: [INDOLOGY] HTML definition of Unicode characters for r and l with "underring"?
In-Reply-To: <044C4CE033BD474EBE2ACACE8E4B1D940132AAC1BC@UM-EXCDAG-A06.um.gwdg.de>

r with dot below is defined as a combined glyph:
http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1e5b/index.htm  Similarly r +
line below.

But ring below is - as you observe correctly - not in the unicode standard
as a single glyph.  See, e.g., this list
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/r.htm>.  The letter r + ring
below is, as others have said, still fully achievable and fully Unicode,
but it has to be rendered with a combination of the two glyphs r and the
non-spacing ring below.

The canonical list of names from the Unicode website is here:
http://unicode.org/charts/charindex.html .  Search for "ring below" to see
what is, and what isn't available.

Best,
Dominik
