Subject: [INDOLOGY] Lucid dreaming in Sanskrit?

For the term yoganidr? and its meanings in yogic texts cf. very informative entry at the blog The Luminescent written by Jason Birch and Jacqueline Hargreaves "Yoganidr?: An Understanding of the History and Context":
http://theluminescent.blogspot.cz/2015_01_01_archive.html

Briefly, yoganidr? has no connection to lucid dreaming, it is either one of the synonyms for sam?dhi (early meaning), or the name of the ?sana (modern practice: ?av?sana combined with dissolution of the mind and other techniques).

Best,
Lubomir
