Subject: [INDOLOGY] Another article needed
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQF9URusKUMaOF-Fb-rrTw77m-LHQFfBjTYWs9Ypeu3T_g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list membets,

I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could send me the article "Devotional
Hymns from the Sanskrit" by Beek G. L. (1995) pages 133-144 in Religions of
India in Practice, D. S. Lopez Jr. (ed) .  Again if there are copyright
issues I mostly need pages 137 thru 139.

Many thanks,
Harry Spier
