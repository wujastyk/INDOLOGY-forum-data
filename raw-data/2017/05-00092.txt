But you seem to be saying that the Sanskrit manuscript is actually of a portion of a different Praj??prad?p?val? commentary, one by J??nap?da? If so, does a Tibetan translation of it exist?

I'm still not quite sure, but chances are that this could be (a bit of) one of J??nap?da's juvenilia, composed after his study with Haribhadra (whose influence is undeniable), when he was at N?land?, before his (first) trip to the Konkan.
