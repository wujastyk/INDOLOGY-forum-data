Debrief Nepal: Reflections on In-Country Working Exercise<http://southasiainstitute.harvard.edu/event/debrief-nepal-reflections-on-in-country-working-exercise/>
Special Event

Although scientists can say with near certainty that a major earthquake will strike the Kathmandu Valley in the future, they cannot predict with certainty when that major earthquake will strike.  Such uncertainty generates another kind of uncertainty, about what to do now, in the near term, and in the long term.  It can even facilitate delays in needed decision-making.  Nepali stakeholders, drawn from government, civil society, and the private sector, joined several outside participants in a just-completed one-day exercise using rapid scenario planning methods to unlock implementable ideas for securing an earthquake-resilient Kathmandu Valley. They will report on the outcome of the working exercise during this panel discussion.

Reception to Follows

This initiative is part of the Harvard South Asia Institute?s Nepal Studies Program<http://southasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2016/12/sai-launches-nepal-studies-program/>, launched with generous support from Jeffrey M. Smith.
This initiative is co-sponsored by University of New South Wales
