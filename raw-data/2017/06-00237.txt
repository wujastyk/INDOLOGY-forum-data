Dear colleagues,

Might a kind soul share with me a copy of a review by Agathon Benary in 
the /(Berliner) Jahrb?cher f?r wissenschaftliche Kritik, /1831, vol. 1, 
pp. 748 ff. of A. W. Schlegel's essays in the Berliner Kalender 1829, 
1831? The Hathi Trust series begins only later, and the Bodleian, via 
Archive.org gives only vol. 2 of 1831.  If it can be found online, would 
you kindly give me a lesson on how to get there?  It would be much 
appreciated.

With thanks and best wishes,

Rosane Rocher
