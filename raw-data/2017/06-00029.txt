Dear Madhav:

Don Davis is the person to consult on this. There are several texts written about ?an?c?ra? ? which is, contrary to what it seems, is actually practices that are proper but goes against the ?c?ra of the sm?tis and are OK in Kerala. The CESMEO published a text called ???karasm?ti alias Laghudharmaprak??ik?, edited and translated by N. P. Unni in 2003. In Ch. 12 of that work there is a list of 64 an?c?ras.

I found an interesting reference in A. C. Burnell's The Ordinances of Manu, (Intro. p. xxxvii) to a work titled An?c?ranir?aya composed in Kerala to discuss "deviations" from Brahmanical Dharma??stras.  According the footnote on this page, this work was evidently attributed to ?a?kara.  This may be the source of ??ma??str? Dravi?a Dvivedi using the expression ?c?rya??padagdha to refer to these regions.  Here is the passage from Burnell:


I wonder if anyone has come across this work titled An?c?ranir?aya.  Any help?

Dear Colleagues,

     In one of the curious passages of the Vedavic?ra (written by ??ma??str? Dravi?a Dvived?) that I am editing, the author says that though the Gurjara's are included among Dr?vi?as, other Dr?vi?as do not have any educational, ritual or marriage relations with them, because like the Gau?ade?a, there is too much an?c?ra "immoral behavior" among them, and like the Brahmins of Kerala, they were cursed by an ?c?rya, and therefore, other Dr?vi?as do not have any relations with them.  Here is the passage from the text:

??? ?????????? ????????????????????? ????????? ?? ????????????????????? ??????, ??????????????????? ??????? ? ???? ?????????? ????????????? ??? ????????? ? ?????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??? ???????? ?

If anyone has a clue as to what this ?c?rya??pa refers to, it would help me make better sense of this passage.  Similarly, it is not clear what an?c?rab?hulya he is referring to in the Gau?a/Gurjara and Kerala regions.  Any suggestions will be helpful.  Best,
