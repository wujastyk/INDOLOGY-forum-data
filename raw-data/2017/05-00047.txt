the "1983 ed. " appears to refer to the Tibetan text.
I do not understand well to which writing of Karen Lang the author refers.

I checked the text, and this reference is correct. As we know, but not stated on the copyright pages of the Nag Publishers printings of the pur??as, they are photographic reprints of the Ve?ka?e?vara Press editions published in manuscript form at Bombay in the early 1900s.
