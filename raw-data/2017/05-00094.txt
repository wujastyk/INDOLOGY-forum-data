Hello Friends,

     I have now added R?, L? and ? (besides r?,  r??, l?, and ?) to my
MMDUnicode.keylayout for Mac.  I have attached the changed version.  Have
not been able to add long versions of R? and L?, but they don't occur in
the initial position anyway, and so that should not be an issue.  Try it
out and see if it works for you.

Madhav
