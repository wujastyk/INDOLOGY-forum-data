Dear all
I am searching for Kavyaprakasa with notes by AB Gajendragadkar first
edition. (1939?)
 the later editions are freely available everywhere, in which, around 200
pages were removed by his grandson.

Tantrasiddhantaratnavali ??????????????????????? by Chinna swamy 1944
This book is freely available on internet but with poor quality scan and
almost impossible to read.
