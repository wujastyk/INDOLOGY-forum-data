  Dr.Tieken

             I  feel so relieved on getting your reply. 



                         The question which I  was asking is something like this-  



                       While going through the book 'Bhamati' by Bachaspati Mishra( 8-9th CE) 

,I came across the following argument preferred by the Purvapakshis -



            ''  ?? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????'



     i.e. Atha Yad Asandigdham Aproyojonam Prekshavat Pratipitsa Gochara



 What is the implication of the word' ????????? ??????????? ( Prekshavat Pratipitsa )





                                                       ALAKENDU DAS
