Dear Dominik,
I believe there is a Jain connection here. ?In Jain texts, "ka??ya" refers to passions/attachments which attract karmic matter to the j?va. ?But each ka??ya is also connected with a specific "le?ya"?the colors which the j?va takes on due to the presence of the ka??ya-s. ?Perhaps the meaning of ka??ya as a color has been conflated with the le?ya concept? ?This is just an initial guess, and not based on any in-depth investigation of specific occurrences of these terms in Jaina sources.
Hopefully a helpful start,Jeff?Dr. Jeffery D. Long

 Has anyone wrestled with the divergent meanings of "ka??ya"?? Obviously there are core meanings like "red/yellow," "a sort of tea-like infusion," and "astringent taste." ?But there are several outlier meanings, including Wilson's "attachment to worldly objects." ?Wilson is often very apt, and I think he got his meaning from the Pandits around him. ? The Buddhist "decay, etc." seems to carry over the ChUp's "impurity, sin." ?Ved?ntas?ra's "stupidity" is another outlier.? Is this really a conflation of homonyms, or what?
