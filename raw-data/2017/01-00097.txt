Subject: [INDOLOGY] hermaphrodite king as an evil omen
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4+o=HUJ=L=cO-rvPabbg78MfDgYg_m47Yyo4f90O3S=Ug@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

This may be something well known, but...
I am working now on a set of prophecies of the evil to beset the Buddhist
community after the Buddha's death. These (they are relatively well known)
are cast as dreams of King K?kin, who lived in the distant past, and whose
dreams were interpreted by the Buddha K??yapa (some sources say this was
his son!) as pertaining to his far future, namely, our time, more or less.
Anyway, one of the dreams is that a monkey will be consecrated as king,
which is interpreted to mean that a hermaphrodite will be consecrated king.
I've looked (sort of, not exactly sure even how to look for this!) to see
whether this is considered a sign of decline, but I've come up empty.
Probably i'm just looking in the wrong place... but one of you ?i??as must
know...?

thanks!  jonathan
