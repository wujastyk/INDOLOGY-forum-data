Still more precisely, Anv?r-i Suhail? is Persian version (once removed) of Ibn al-Muqaffa??s Arabic Kalila wa Dimna, which is based on Burz?e?s lost Middle Persian translation of the Pa?catantra. The story in question is the last in the fifth chapter of the KwD (no. 37 in Chauvin?s numbering). In Pa?catantra it is 1, 11 of Edgerton, 1, 17 of the Tantr?khy?yika, and 1, 28 of P?r?abhadra. With John of Capua it entered European literature, thus e.g. La Fontaine 9, 1 ?Le d?positaire infid?le? is a new version of the same. In Anv?r-i S. it is the last (28th) story of the first book in Wollaston?s translation.

Best,
Klaus
