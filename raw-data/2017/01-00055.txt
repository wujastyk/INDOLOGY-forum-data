Does anyone know of Sanskrit tutors or schools in Kathmandu or Pokhara who are certified so that interested students could study with them on a student visa?
A private tutor would be fine for some of these students if they could provide the documentation for the tourist visa.
Oddly enough, there is also interest in studying Hindi in Nepal, although that might be harder to find.
Best,
