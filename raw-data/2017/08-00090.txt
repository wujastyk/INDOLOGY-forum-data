A grammatically meticulous analysis of all words, their gender and
inflection, as they occur in the BhG, will be found here:

R.B.P.C. Divanji, ?r?madbhagavadg?t?vivecan?tmaka?abdako?a?: Critical
Word-Index to the Bhagavadg?t?. Reprint [of the edition of 1946]. New Delhi
1993.

I quote from the preface of A. Wezler: "There is no tool like this index
[...] Divanji's work remains unsurpassed. [...] compared to it, R. J.
Venkateswaran's Dictionary of Bhagavad Gita (Delhi 1991) looks like the
scribble of an absolute beginner."
