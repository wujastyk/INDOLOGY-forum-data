 Namaste,

Sad news coming from Russia lately. Yesterday in Moscow?Andrey Zaliznyak?at age 83 was buried. If there is one man in XX century linguistics (who taught?Sanskrit as well in Moscow State Universityfor more than 50 years from time to time, mixing it with Old Persian, Arabic and Old Church Slavonic) whom I can compare to Panini, it is he. He learnedSanskrit from Renou in Paris. His article on classification of verbal roots (1975) is still outstanding and there is nothing of that kind written in French, German?or English - before or after. It takes Whitney and reclassifies his Sanskrit Roots in a logical way, adding meta-data, but typographically, instead of Panini's letter-anubandhas.
His biggest work in field of Sanskrit, "Outline of Sanskrit Grammar" (1st. ed. 1978), reprinted 5 times, continues the structuralist approach. It's similar to
Mayrhofer, Manfred.?Sanskrit-Grammatik?mit sprachvergleichenden Erl?uterungen. Series:Sammlung G?schen
