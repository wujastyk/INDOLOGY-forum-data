Subject: Please help with articles specifically on Dhy?na in context of
philosophy of yoga.



Dear list members,


I am at the beginning of my PhD research on Dhy?na in context of philosophy
of yoga. After collecting all the material needed from original scriptures
from early upani?ads to late ha?ha-yogic texts, I came to a point of
searching for academic papers analyzing the term. At this point I have
found only these works:


On the Meaning of *jha?na *and *dhya?na *?Meditation? in Early Buddhism,
the Moks?adharmaparvan of the *Maha?bha?rata *and in Classical Yoga
Philosophy. P. Maas.

Oberhammer, Gerhard. *Strukturen yogischer Meditation. Untersuchungen zur
Spiritualit?t des Yoga. *Wien ?sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften,
1977, pp. 134?230

Bedekar, V. M. ?Dhya?nayoga in the Maha?bha?rata.? *Bha?rati?ya Vidya? *20?21
(1963): 116?125.

Jan Gonda. The Vision of the Vedic Poets. 1963. p.392.


I would be very grateful to you all for help on information and links to
articles, research papers, monographs that include analyses of the term
dhy?na or contexts it is used in.


Best regards,

Dmitry Danilov.
