Thank you, Ashok, for your comments.

I'm glad to hear it ;nor do I. I am just curious about the name.

I don't want to seem overly critical -- Pingree was a trailblazer, and 
every scholar working on the history of astrology owes him a debt of 
gratitude. But it must be conceded that he was somewhat prone to rash 
emendations and far-reaching interpretations. In recent years, Bill Mak 
has shown the problems with some of Pingree's work on the 
/Yavanaj?taka/; and in another linguistic field (but still related to 
astrology), Stephan Heilen in his /Hadriani genitura/ (De Gruyter 2015) 
similarly has some reservations about Pingree's edition of Hephaestio's 
/Apotelesmatics/. I am not competent to judge Pingree's work on texts in 
any language but Sanskrit, but there I do quite often find reason to 
disagree with his readings and/or translations. It would be interesting 
to learn from an Arabist what the situation is with his work in that area.

Yes, I take your point; but the situation here is the opposite: there is 
practically no variation across manuscripts (I have now located a third 
one) or metres. They all read /bh?yi/ or /bh?i/ -- I have not so far 
seen a single instance lacking the aspiration. That was what made me 
wonder in the first place.

That depends on how you define a section -- it is right towards the end 
of the last chapter, but the immediately preceding verse praises the 
work itself and says nothing of the author.
