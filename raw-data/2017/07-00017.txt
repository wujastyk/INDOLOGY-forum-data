While reading the first letter <rline.jpg> in such a cluster it is always pronounced like <tdot.jpg> (?) and the following <2p1.jpg> as it is, that is trill. Here <word11.jpg> is pronounced as (?r) as in the English word, ?attraction?. This is an important one to be noted by the learners of Tamil with respect to reading/speaking and writing.?

It is true that nowadays some youngsters erroneously bring in retroflexion in pronouncing this cluster. But that cannot be taught as the standard pronunciation.
