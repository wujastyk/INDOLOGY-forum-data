But the text shows that it is hiDimbA who falls in love with bhIma:


   ????????? ??????? ?? ??????????????????? | ??????? ????????
   ????????????? ???? ||??|| ??? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? |
   ??????????? ??????????? ????? ?????? ??????? ||??|| ???? ????????? ????
   ??????? ?????????????? | ??????????????????? ??? ????????????? ||??||

Bhima's response to her is


   ????? ??????? ???????? ????????????????? | ????????? ?? ??????
   ?????????? ??????? ||??|| ?? ?? ??????????????????????????? ???????????? |
   ????? ? ??? ?????????????? ?? ??????? ||??||

Where is the 'potentially dangerous feminine threat' here ? When there is
no threat, wherefrom comes the 'patriarchal appropriation' ?
