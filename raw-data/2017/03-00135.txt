Without the slightest intention to defend the Raj, I think that some
familiarity with the Chinese occupation of Tibet would convince you that
your comparison is not a propos. I do not intend to catalog the
differences, but would ask you in the very first place to familiarize
yourself with Chinese policy toward the Tibetan language, and to compare
that with the Raj's attitude toward Indian languages. (I leave it to you to
make further comparisons to prison camps, extra-judicial executions,
wholesale destruction of sacred and cultural sites, etc etc etc).
