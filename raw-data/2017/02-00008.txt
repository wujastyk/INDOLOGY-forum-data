 Dr.Anderson,

              Thanks everybody for elaborating on the matter  





     However, ,in this connection I would like to qoute a few lines from  Pg 19 of the book 'An 

Advanced History of India' by Dr.R.C. Majumdar et al ( Publisher -MACMILLAN, First edition 

1946,Latest Reprint 1988), which says, in a Chapter on IVC - ' More than five hundred seals have 

been disccoverd....... made of Terra-Cotta .All of them contain ,a short record  inscribed in a 

sort of pictorial writing ,which still remians undeciphered.'



           My question is -;Whether it implies what we call hieroglyphics?





                                                          ALAKENDU DAS.
