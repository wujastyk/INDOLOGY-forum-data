Dear Fellow List Members,
Here the announcement, with apologies for cross-postings:

The DK Award for an outstanding doctoral thesis on Sanskrit and  
related studies was inaugurated in 2006 by the International  
Association of Sanskrit Studies at the World Sanskrit Conference in  
Edinburgh, in collaboration with DK Agencies, Delhi.

The Award is for an outstanding PhD received in the period 2015-2017  
on Sanskrit and related studies. It is for a scholar who is based  
outside South Asia.
The deadline for applications for the next DK AWARD is 31st January 2018.

As in previous years, the IASS will appoint a panel of adjudicators to  
assess the quality of the theses submitted for the award. The Award  
will be announced in July 2018, at the next WSC in Vancouver, Canada.

The host of the IASS website is updating its programmes, so details  
about the DK Award (http://www.sanskritassociation.org/dk-award) may  
not be immediately accessible. Please consult the attachment (if the  
attachment gets rejected in transmission please write to me for a copy).

The IASS thanks Mr Ramesh Mittal of DK Agencies personally and DK  
Agencies as a firm for supporting Sanskrit scholarship in a generous  
way: one thousand dollars worth of books from DK Agencies.

Previous awardees have been Drs Wendy J. Phillips-Rodr?guez, Himal  
Trikha and Michael Slouber.

yours sincerely,
Jayandra Soni
