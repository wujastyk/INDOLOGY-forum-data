Thank you, Palaniappan, for sharing this. I've been following news of the
revisions, and in general they have reflected a very poor level of
scholarship and writing in the textbooks in general-- not only in regard to
characterizations of caste and ancient Hinduism, but also in regard to
Buddhism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, etc. In addition to pressure from
interest groups, the consolidation of commercial interests in textbook
publishing in the United States has led to a depressing state of affairs in
which quality of materials suffers to market dynamics.

Best,
TWW
