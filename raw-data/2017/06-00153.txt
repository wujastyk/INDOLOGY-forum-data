Subject: [INDOLOGY] Warder Sanskrit Reader
Message-ID: <66216135-E2C6-4DD6-A17D-CCA6D0074E36@googlemail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I was intrigued to hear of a Sanskrit reader by Warder in a recent thread.

I have since sought to obtain it via inter-library loans.

I have been told there are NO COPIES available in the U.K.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to obtain a copy?

Best Wishes,
