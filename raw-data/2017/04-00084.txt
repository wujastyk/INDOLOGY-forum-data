Subject: [INDOLOGY] Inability to see romanised (transliterated text with diacritics) Sanskrit in my emails.

This is apparently an insoluble problem when Mailman posts are received in
digest form.  Is this the case with you, Anuj?  If so, switch to individual
messages, and maybe the problem will go away.
Best,
Dominik
