Dear Jesse,

Do Ugric languages count? There is a brilliant metrical Hungarian translation, a collaborative effort of the Sanskritist J?zsef Vekerdi, who made a prose translation from the Sanskrit and of the poet S?ndor We?res who versified it.

Dzsajad?va, G?ta Govinda. P?sztor?nek. Magvet?, Budapest, 1982.

Best,
Csaba
