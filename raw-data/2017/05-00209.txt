> From B. R. Ambedkar's address to an international gathering at Colombo (on
> 5 June 1950):
>
> <<In India, like the village deity and national deity, there were family
> deities also who were worshipped through the Brahmins. The priests who used
> to go for worshipping these deities started influencing the affairs of the
> State through the queens. Asoka after embracing Buddhism discontinued this
> practice and removed the idols of such deities. Asoka said, "As I venerate
> the Buddha, the Enlightened One, there is no need to worship any other
> deity".>>
>
> The address is quoted in Lella Karunyakara's "Modernisation of Buddhism.
> Contributions of Ambedkar and Dalai Lama-XIV" Gyan Publishing House, New
> Delhi 2002, p 225 - without any comment.
>
> It is quoted again - in a different context, but also without comment - in
> Himanshu Prabha Ray's "Interpreting the Mauryan Empire: Centralized State
> or Multiple Centres of Control", in: Grant Parker and Carla Sinopoli eds.
> Ancient India in its Wider World, University of Michigan 2008, footnote 3.
