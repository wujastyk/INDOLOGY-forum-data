Dear Scholars,

I am looking for a PDF version of *Samprad?ya Kalpadruma*  of *Vi?h?hale?a*.
Would be much obliged if anyone could share a copy of it.

Further, are they any scholars here who have researched further into the
thesis that *Jagann?tha Pa??ita* was a descendant of *Vallabh?c?rya* from
his mother?s side? I am aware of R B Athavale's work regarding this.

However, I have no further reference which establishes this firmly, and
pointers to any research papers on this would be helpful.

How does the  Pu??im?rga tradition look at this thesis? Is it a widely held
belief in the tradition?

Kind regards,
Santosh Gokhale
