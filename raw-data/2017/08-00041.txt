Subject: [INDOLOGY] sex and gender
Message-ID: <c6582249-8903-6b47-4808-0484e7d66221@yorku.ca>

Dear all,

This is a question from a colleague who is not on the list. This 
colleague teaches a course on Sex and Gender theory and is interested in 
articles that addresses the topic from differing cultural vantages. I 
was asked about what was available on the topic that discusses the issue 
from the perspective of the Indian tradition.  I didn't know what to 
say. I'd be grateful for any suggestions.

Thanks,

Shyam
