Yes, this was one of the first thoughts to strike me. But /?r?bh?yi/ is 
used consistently at the end of each of the sixteen chapters; the -i is 
short, and surely the variation v<>bh is not very common, at least 
outside Bengal? (This is not my area of expertise, so I'm open to 
correction.) Also, if /bh?yi/ is to be understood as a suffix, ?r? would 
have to be the mother's personal name. Not impossible, of course, but 
perhaps unusual?

Perhaps that is why Pingree homed in on it (though he explicitly says 
that Y?dava lived in Gujarat).* It may have been one of his 
over-confident emendations. But even reading /v?[y]i/ f?r /bh?yi/ and 
/supure/ for /su?uve/, the /-n?mni/ will be unmetrical and the first two 
p?das won't hang together, so I do think his suggested reading must be 
abandoned.
