According to David Pingree (CESS A5: 335), the astrological author 
Y?davas?ri (early 17th century, Gujarat?) lived in a place called V??. 
In support, Pingree quotes the author's /T?jikayogasudh?nidhi/ (16.27):

?r?vatsasa?j??d dvijapu?gav?dya? ?r?v??n?mni supure ca s?dhv? |
?r?y?davena vyarac?ha tena sudh?nidhis t?jikayogap?rva? ||

This is neither metrically nor syntactically satisfactory. On examining 
a manuscript of the text, I found that it read:

?r?vatsasa?j??d dvijapu?gav?d ya? ?r?bh?yin?mn? su?uve ca s?dhv? |
?r?y?davena vyarac?ha tena sudh?nidhis t?jikayogap?rva? ||

Y?davas?ri thus appears to give his mother's name as /?r?bh?yi/. I have 
not come across this name before -- can anyone confirm that it exists?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
