Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help to find verse
Message-ID: <CAODNnZj-DVPQMBTAne=-Fvg-wWEx1fJ8eQQ44d2n8_QtBkOBAA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all.
I'm looking for a verse on Nyayashastra with the following meaning:
One may read this work and feign understanding. One may even teach it. One
may even write commentaries on it. But he may still miss the secrets hidden
herein.

I am not able recall the source too. Kindly anyone help..
