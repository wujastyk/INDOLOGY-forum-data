Is there no way to unlock them so they can be corrected?
Best,

Thanks! Its ultimate source was what has become a fee-based provider now called ?Liberation Philology??(http://www. libphil.ca/sanskrit.php). We have removed both sets from our website. Kind regards, WS

Unfortunately, the 3000-list is full of mistakes, and there is no way of correcting them (the document is protected).
All the best,
Hans Henrich Hock

Does anyone know of any Sanskrit flash cards?
Or a database with a list of Sanskrit words and their translations that might be used to create a database for flash cards?
Best,
Dean Anderson
