Another lesser-known reader is John Brough's 1978 Selections from Classical
Sanskrit Literature
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Selections-Classical-Sanskrit-Literature-Brough/dp/0728600501/>.
Also in roman script.  Like everything Brough did, it's original and
valuable.

Best,
Dominik

NB: Brough's archive <http://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/library/archive/brough>,
including interesting unpublished materials.
