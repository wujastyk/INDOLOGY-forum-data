Dear colleagues,

I agree with Seishi Karashima that neither of these passages relate to Sanskrit pa?gu or pa?ku ?lame?, but the original edition indeed reads sayala-mahi | valaya-pauka in the pdf scan available at archive.org <http://archive.org/>. I did not see that Jacobi corrected this reading in the published edition,. but I also do not dispute that pa?klu is correct. I did not consult data input on the internet. Even the great scholars may have missed typographical errors!

Best wishes,

Elliot Stern

Eine Jaina Legende in Apabhra??a, hrsg. von Hermann Jacobi, M?nchen 1921: Verlag der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, p. 37) in fact reads sayala-mahivalaya-panku (i.e. -pa?ku). Only the input data on the internet reads "sayala-mahivalaya-pauku". One must discern "edition" made by the great scholar from "data" input by somebody. Sayala-mahivalaya-pa?ku means ?mud in the whole world? (?der Schlamm im ganzen Lande?, ibid., p. 76). However, pa?ku is a nom. sg. masc. form of pa?ka in Apabhra??a.

> >> I would like to draw on the collective manuscript reading experience of our list members. A Sanskrit word pa?gu is well known in dictionaries and printed texts. It denotes a ?lame person?. In a passage of the ms of svadita?kara??  (a palm leaf Malayalam script ms), a commentary on ny?yaka?ik?, this word appears only as pa?ku with many repetitions in a long comment on a line in vidhiviveka?.. It is possible to argue that this reading pa?ku should be corrected to pa?gu, because pa?ku and pa?gu are both pronounced the same in the Malayalam language (i.e., the k is pronounced as g). This argument, however, seems weak to me. First, other words like prasa?ga always appear as expected in the svadita?kara?? ms. Second, a most likely 16th century devan?gar? ms of ny?yaka?ik? certainly reads pa?ku in two of the three occurrences of pa?gu later in the commentary, and probably in all three of them (the first fifty or so folia of this ms, that would include the passage on which svadita?karra?? comments, are not available). In two of these instances, we see a correction to pa?gu, but one stands uncorrected. Third, the ms. of ju?adhva?kara?? (also a palm leaf Malayalam script ms) reads pa?ku a few times, and also consistently renders words like prasa?ga as expected.
