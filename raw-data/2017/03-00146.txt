Dear colleagues,

I am very sad to hear the news of the demise of Prof. Meulenbeld.
I was first inspired by his book on M?dhavanid?na and then
by the monumental book A History of Indian Medical Literature.
Although he passed away, his achievements will be alive forever.

Michio Yano
Professor emeritus,
Kyoto Sangyo University
