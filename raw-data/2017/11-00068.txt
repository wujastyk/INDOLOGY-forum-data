Dear Emma, dear Mark,

I have still something else to signal, namely the chapter on "Orality and
Writing" within Raffaele Torella's "The philosophical traditions of India:
an appraisal" (Indica Books, Varanasi 2011), pp 197-211. The whole book can
be downloaded from Academia (https://www.academia.edu/
31112290/THE_PHILOSOPHICAL_TRADITIONS_OF_INDIA_AN_APPRAISAL).

Best,

elisa
