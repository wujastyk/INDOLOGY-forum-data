Dear Dr Marina Orelskaya,

The issue was resolved through Patrick's offline conversation with me.

He found  utkaTa koNaasan to be close to the drill under discussion, except
that the hands were spread straight horizontally on either sides.

He found my suggestion

digantasama*baahu* utkaTa koNaasan

or

anuprastha*baahu* utkaTakoNaasan

as a good choice.

Arrai Mandi /Ardha mandali Sanskritization or Tamilization? Better to
accept both as synonyms and leave it at that.
