Just to add to this: the category of atyant?bh?va also occurs in
*Candramati's *Da?apad?rtha??stra, a Vai?e?ika work preserved only in
Chinese translation (see Ui, "The Vai?e?ika Philosophy according to the
Da?apad?rtha-??stra", London 1917). *Candramati also accepts abh?va as a
separate category (pad?rtha). His text lists five varieties of absence
(the other four are pr?g-, pradhva?sa-, anyonya-, and sa?sarga-abh?va).
Prior to V?caspati Mi?ra I, Bha??a Jayanta relates the fourfold
classification at NM I 166,7f. (Mysore ed.), and then also a sixfold
classification (these four plus apek??bh?va? and s?marthy?bh?va?).

The fourfold classification also occurs, of course, in Kum?rila's
?lokav?rttika, chapter on abh?va, where the example for the atyant?bh?va
is the hare's horn. There it is however not part of an overarching
classification into the two types mutual and relational absence.

With best wishes,
