To add more of a grammatical note, a term like vi?v?mitra-gotra in Sanskrit
can have two possible meanings: a) the gotra of vi?v?mitra (a Tatpuru?a
compound), and b) one whose gotra is vi?v?mitra (a Bahuvr?hi compound).  On
the other hand, the term vi?v?mitra-sagotra is more clear in having only
one meaning: "one who has the same gotra as vi?v?mitra."  This may be the
reason why the passages quoted by Professor Korada prescribe the use of
-sagotra expression.  In my family rituals, the declaration included
something like aham bh?radv?ja-gotrotpanna? ... "I, born in the
bh?radv?ja-gotra."  In this usage, the term bh?radv?ja-gotra is used just
to refer to the gotra of bh?radv?ja, and not in the sense of "one with the
bh?radv?ja-gotra."   I don't remember the usage of bh?radv?ja-sagotra in my
family.  In any case, thanks for all the suggestions, and I have
communicated these to my friend, who posed the original question to me.
