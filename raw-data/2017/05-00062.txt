Subject: [INDOLOGY] Buddhasrijnana's Abhisamaya commentary

In his Hindi autobiography "Meri Jivan Yatra", Sankrtyayan writes that 
he didn't have a camera suitable for photographing manuscripts at the 
time (the journey was undertaken in 1934), only a Rolleiflex (which at 
the most allowed him to take pictures of statues in monasteries).

Moreover, he also had no facilities to develop the photographs in situ 
and therefore could not check whether they were ok -- and knew very 
little on photography at the time.

He therefore took the trouble to transcribe everything that was 
important to him (like the Vibh?ticandra ms of Praj??karagupta's 
Pram??av?rttik?la?k?ra, or an ms of Dharmak?rti's V?dany?ya).

If, therefore, there is no record that he took photographs of the 
Abhisamay?la?k?ra comm. on one of his later journeys (1936 or 1938), I'd 
say it's very unlikely that there are any (usable) photographs preserved 
in Patna.

With best regards,

Birgit
