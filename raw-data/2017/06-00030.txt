When I wrote in my second post:
> It is possible that the portion listing the sixty four an?c?ras and corresponding to adhy?ya 12, p?da 4 of the  Laghudharmaprak??ik?, was separately known as the An?c?ra-nir?aya
(without having checked what Kane ? or possibly David ? says thereabout) I made this conjecture on the sole basis of Burnell's statement ( https://archive.org/stream/ordinancesofmanu00manu#page/n55/mode/2up ) pointed out by Madhav: 
"And in Malabar, Cochin and Travancore this [= the fact that "even among South Indian Brahmans numberless usual practices are opposed to the Sanskrit law"] is so much the case, that a small manual called the An?c?ranir?aya has been composed to enumerate them ? fn: This tract is attributed to ?a?kara of course (...)"
Since no Kerala manuscript appears to bear this title. 
Now in checking dharma texts entitled ?c?ra?, ?c?rasa?graha?, keral?c?rasa?graha?, found in catalogues, I came across a short tract entitled ?c?ranir?aya or Keral?c?ranir?aya ascribed to ?a?kar?carya (several MSS. in the KUML, apparently described in the Descr. Cat. Curator's Office Library as the no. 371B, i.e. in vol. 2 1938, unfortunately not at hand) which must correspond to Burnell's reference and deserves to be more closely regarding the Kerala? an?c?ras.
Best wishes,
C

PS: correct the typo in my very first post (already giving the references usefully repeated by Parpola and Olivelle): "the Laghudharmaprak??ik? attributed to one ?a?kara [not ???kara], also known as ???karasm?ti."

There are several texts written about ?an?c?ra? ? which is, contrary to what it seems, is actually practices that are proper but goes against the ?c?ra of the sm?tis and are OK in Kerala. The CESMEO published a text called ???karasm?ti alias Laghudharmaprak??ik?, edited and translated by N. P. Unni in 2003. In Ch. 12 of that work there is a list of 64 an?c?ras.

Burnell's The Ordinances of Manu, (Intro. p. xxxvii) to a work titled An?c?ranir?aya composed in Kerala to discuss "deviations" from Brahmanical Dharma??stras.  According the footnote on this page, this work was evidently attributed to ?a?kara.  This may be the source of ??ma??str? Dravi?a Dvivedi using the expression ?c?rya??padagdha to refer to these regions.  Here is the passage from Burnell:
