Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Ashokan Pillars' transport

Thank you, Julia.

But - a pity. The link does not lead to the paper, one gets a view of some selected fragments, nothing more. Pity - again.

But, anyway -

 getting the pillar out of the quarry, then - transporting it to the river, then - moving it onto a ship, then - getting it out of the ship, then - transporting it to the place of the final destination, then - setting it there --- a phantastically complicated technical/organizational enterprise.

Says much more about the A?okan era than - I'd risk saying that - some enigmatic texts engraved on the pillar.

Best wishes,

Artur
