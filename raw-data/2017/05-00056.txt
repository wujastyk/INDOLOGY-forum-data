My apologies for giving the wrong reference in the Padmapur??a, and my
sincere thanks to Christophe for pointing this out. As I now see, the verse
being asked about is actually Padma-pur??a 5.106.22, which is not
referenced in the verse-index in the Nag Publishers edition. This was found
by Shankara and posted on the Bharatiya-Vidvat-Parisat list.

The verse that Madhav asked about is:

b?hum?lakucadvandvayonispar?anadar?an?t

kasya na skhalati citta? reta? skanna? ca no bhavet

As found in the Ve?ka?e?vara Press edition reprinted by Nag Publishers,
Padma-pur??a, P???la kha??a (the 5th), adhy?ya 106, verse 22, is:

b?hum?lakucadva?dvasvayonispar?adar?an?t

kasya na skhalate ceto reta? skanna? ca no bhavet

In the ?nand??rama edition of the *Padmapur??am* (4 vols., 1893-1894), the
P???la kha??a is the 4th rather than the 5th kha??a. Here this verse is
found in adhy?ya 102 rather than 106, but the verse number remains the
same, 22. Verse 4.102.22 in this edition (vol. 2, 1894, p. 682) is:

b?hum?lakucadva?dvasvayonispar?adar?an?t

kasya na skhalate citta? reta? skanna? ca no bhavet

The other verse that Dge-'dun-chos-'phel quotes here, susnigdha? romarahita?,
etc., is 5.106.17 in the Ve?ka?e?vara Press edition, and 4.102.17 in the
?nand??rama edition.

Best regards,
