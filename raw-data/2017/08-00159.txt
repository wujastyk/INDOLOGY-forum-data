> This explanation of N?ga(/Uraga)-pura as a city on the border of the K?

> The commentary of Vallabhadeva could be useful here, but I have not
> Goodall & Isaacson edition at hand.
> On his side, the commentator Hem?dri says: urag?khyasyeti kalpit?rtham.

> In Raghuvamsa 6th Canto and Verse 58 or 59
> ???????????? ?????? ???? first foot says about Nagapura or Uragapura
> Mallinatha explains as ??????????????????????????? but this seems to be a

>
> And on further search I found Arunagirinatha and Narayana in the

> ?????????? ??????? ??? ??? ??????? ??????? ???? ???????????...
>
> Does any one knows about this river or its modern name kindly inform.
>
> I also believe that even Mallinatha has written ??????? as the name is not
> famous that must be due to ??????????? scribal error occurred
> Thanks

> Correction :
> Not ???????
