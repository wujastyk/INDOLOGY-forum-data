Dear Ajay,

I'm sure I speak for everyone if I say: thank you, that is extremely kind! I think there already is a scan of Vol. 1, but if you could scan vols. 2 and 3, David can then see which volumes he has, and if there indeed are four volumes, maybe we will soon have a complete set of pdfs. How exciting!

All best, and thank you again,
     Antonia

As far as I know, the ad has not been passed on yet (I sent it to the administrator last night), so David, if it isn't too much of a hassle for you, could you scan your copies of vol. 2 and 3? That way I can save the fees that would arise if I was to pay someone in Canada. Still, if the scanning were to be a major effort, just say so - that way, we'd at least feed a grad student:-).

If Antonia's request to the University of Toronto library fails, I will join Antonio in scanning these volumes and making them available. Volume 1 is selections in roman script (typewriter), volume 2 is selections in devanagari script (typewriter), and volume 3 is vocabulary.

I emailed scholarly lists and academics at UoT trying to try to obtain a copy and was given multiple assurances that copies were available and would be willingly provided - again without success. Eventually I contacted the UoT library directly and offered to buy one of their 10 spare copies so I could scan it and put it on Archive.ORG. For my trouble I received an astonishing email from an academic administrator informing me that I was soliciting copyright breach and that the appropriate thing to do would be to attend the UoT library personally and use the material there. Living in Australia makes this rather... difficult...

I would be very happy to provide a high resolution pdf of Volume One but would be eternally grateful if someone else could obtain Volume Two. We could then put the material on Archive.ORG for the benefit of all Sanskrit scholars!

However, if someone on the list already has a scan of some kind and would be willing to share that, I would be most grateful for a copy! (If not, I will mail you (and anyone else who is interested) the pdf if/as soon as I get it from Toronto.)
