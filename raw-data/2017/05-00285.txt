> From your reference to Oliver Hellwig's 2009 W?rterbuch der
mittelalterlichen indischen Alchemie with as specific topic "Mineralogy"
should we conclude that the contributions of this dictionary to other
fields such as alchemical instruments have not been used?


It depends on whether one likes to approach the NWS from a theoretical or
from a practical perspective: The theorist, relying on conclusions drawn
from a tag he has spotted, will refrain from search efforts and meet less
success than the more practical person, who blithely types, e.g., ?*m?ra?a*?
and feels rewarded by a result, which at the same time would also answer
your question about ?mineralogy only?, were it indeed put earnestly, which,
I trust, it was not, but with mild irony
? only?
. I like that.

In any case, we will of course adjust the topic. Thank you for alerting us
to it!



Kind regards,

Walter
