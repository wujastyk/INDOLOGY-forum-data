Subject: [INDOLOGY] World Sanskrit Conference 2018 Paper/Panel Abstract Submission is NOW OPEN
Message-ID: <B23E2F7D-D0A0-4B3B-BEC8-1CC1D0EC6A17@gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that the submission process has now begun for the 17th World Sanskrit Conference, to be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada, July 9-13, 2018. You now have the opportunity to submit an individual paper to be delivered within one of the 24 Sections of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference, or to propose a special panel consisting of 3 or 4 thematically related papers. 

Please click HERE <https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp> to begin the abstract submission process.

The deadlines for submission are as follows: 

	? Special Panel Proposals: July 1, 2017 (Results announced August 2017)
	? Individual Paper Abstracts: October 1, 2017 (Results announced January 2018)

Individual papers shall be allotted a total of 30 minutes (20 min. presentation + 10 min. discussion), while special panels will be allotted 2-hour or 90-minute time blocks. Papers & panels may be delivered in English or French (the national languages of Canada) or in Sanskrit. 

Due to limited resources, each participant may present only one paper (or special panel) within the 17th WSC. However, if you propose a special panel and it does not get approved, you will still have the option of submitting an individual paper for inclusion into WSC2018.

To submit an abstract for an individual paper (300 words) or special panel (500 words), please visit the main conference website, or click directly on the link in this email. Submissions may be made using Roman and/or ???????? scripts, and you will have the option to include a PDF version of your abstract to ensure consistency.

All abstracts will then undergo a blind peer review process by members of the WSC2018 Academic Advisory Board (consisting of the Convenors and Organizing Committee) to determine whether they are suitable for inclusion into the WSC2018 Conference Program. All decisions made by the Board will be final, and revisions are not permitted once the decision is made.

SPECIAL NOTE: Scholars interested in participating in Section 19, "Computational Sanskrit and Digital Humanities" will be asked to submit COMPLETE papers, rather than abstracts, for inclusion into the Section Proceedings, which will be assembled in advance of the conference. Further details are made available on the WSC2018 website.

Please click HERE <https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp> to begin the abstract submission process.

Details regarding registration fees, accommodations, excursions and other expenses are unavailable at this time, but will be announced as they become finalized. 

For further information or guidance, please contact the WSC 2018 Secretariat at wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca, and be sure to consult the official conference website, wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca <https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/>, for the most up-to-date information.
