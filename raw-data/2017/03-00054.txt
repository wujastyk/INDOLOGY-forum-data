Dear Palaniappan,

1
As to my first question, I really want to know if there is an article or any other type of information available on the doubling or absence of doubling in compounds like vitai (verb stem) + pu?am (noun) in Ca?kam poetry (modern written Tamil, which you quote, is another matter).

2
Have you any idea what itai would mean in itaippu?am?

3
As a matter of principle I do not trust traditional dictionaries and commentaries. Calling in these sources is not a very strong argument; see in this connection my article in the word c?ru in Sasha Dubianski's Festschrift' (pdf on my website) or my article on the weaver bird in a Ku?untokai poem.

4
The meaning in the traditional sources for (v)itaippu?am, "a newly cultivated field", seems to me an attempt to translate "a sown field" while avoiding the word "to sow".

5
As to the reading itaippu?am in Akan???ru 394, I am waiting for a critical edition of this anthology. Not that I expect much of that, as the manuscript tradition of Ca?kam texts seems to be recent and is strikingly uniform.

Kind regards, Herman

Dear Dr. Tieken,

I meant to say that if vitai in vitaippu?am were to be considered an adjectival participle since the commentator has explained vitaippu?am  as vitaitta kollai, the gemination of ?p? does not make sense. While vitaitta kollai has the past adjectival participle, vitaitta, the poem has vitai-p-. If vitai (to sow) were to function as an adjectival participle, then it should be part of a vi?aittokai (k?lam karanta peyar eccam) compound. In this compound, the initial plosive of the second member does not double. Since the plosive doubles, the first member is a noun, vitai (seed).

As for the specific meaning of itai, ?sail? (marakkalap p?y) and ?newly cultivated land? (putuppu?am) are given in the Tiv?karam, the earliest Tamil nigha???, which also separately glosses itaippu?am as putukkollai, which is shown in the Tamil Lexicon. ?Chowlee-bean' is found in the later lexicon, the Pi?kalam. In the context discussed here, the meaning ?sail? can be easily discarded. As for 'Chowlee-bean?, it can be discarded because we have in Akam 394 common millet  (varaku) being grown in itaippu?am. So, the meaning of itaippu?am as a 'newly cultivated field? is not an ad hoc invention.

Regards,
Palaniappan

Dear dr Palaniappan,
I am just curious: is there a hard and fast rule that vitai in vitai-p-pu?am cannot function as an adjectival participle: "sown" field (I am not sure if this is proper English)? Does the doubling of the initial plosive p of the second member pu?am necessarily point to a case relation between the members of the (Tatpuru?a) compound?

Apart from this general question, what are we to make of itai? The TL gives chowlee-bean (=k?r?ma?i). In any case the meaning "plot of land newly cultivated" for itaippu?am is clearly an ad hoc invention.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Malaipa?uka??m102

Dear Indologists,

Current editions of Malaipa?uka??m, a Classical Tamil text, have lines 102-103 as follows:
n?lat ta??a vitaippu?a maru?ki?
maku?i p?y?tu malitu?i ta??li?

These lines have been taken as consisting of the following words:
n?lattu a??a vitaippu?am maru?kil
maku?i p?y?tu malitu?i ta??li?

Line 102 is interpreted as (n?lama?iyaiyotta ni?attaiyu?aiyavaye?umpa?i ava??ai vitaitta kollaiyi? pakkattil) ?by the side of cultivated field in which have been sown the seeds, which grow with leaves like sapphire? by Nacci??rkki?iyar.

The compound ?vitaippu?am? (vitai + p + pu?am) in line 102 does not make sense.  First of all, if vitaippu?am were to be considered an adjectival participle (vitaitta kollaiyi?) as the commentator has considered, the gemination of ?p? does not make sense. Also, it is highly unlikely that a cultivated field is qualified in a convoluted way as a field sown with seeds which grow to be with leaves like sapphire.

The correct rendition of line 102 would have been n?lattu a??a itaippu?am maru?kil.  (v in ?vitaippu?am' is simply a glide.) According to Tamil Lexicon, itaippu?am means ?plot of ground newly cultivated for dry crops such as millet?. itaippu?a occurs in Akan????u 394.3.

Interestingly, when glossing the word vitaippu?am, Tamil Lexicon says the following.

??????????? vitai-p-pu?am

, n. < ????? ?????. Plot of land newly cultivated. See ??????????. (????. ??.)

Although, the lexicon does not cite Malaipa?uka??m 102, the editors probably had this vitaippu?am in mind. Later commentators like Peruma?aippulavar have simply followed Nacci??rkki?iyar without considering Tamil Lexicon?s insight. Does anybody know if this issue has been discussed by any other scholar?

(The misunderstanding of the role of the glide v has led to Nacci??rkki?iyar (14th century CE) misinterpreting i- as vi- in Malaipa?uka??m102. In an earlier post, I had suggested that a similar misinterpretation has led to the word i?a?kar being mistaken for vi?a?kar and used in a 16th century text. (http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-January/040561.html) The case of vitaippu?am in Malaipa?uka??m 102 suggests that vi?a?kar was not an isolated case.)

Thank you in advance.

Regards,
Palaniappan
