Nagaraj,

I understand your point precisely about vaidika = veda-aviruddha;-anuroopa;
-anusaari, etc.
However, there seem to be many things, particularly within *Yogaland* that
are signified as 'Vedic' with either or both meanings (ie both vedas'ruta &
veda-anuroopa) - However, this fine distinction is not generally made by
promoters of particular products within yogaland, and many things are
simply conflated to 'vedic' meaning 'it's really old and happened a long
time ago, and therefore it's really pure and amaaazing'. In fact, this
point is capitalised and exploited, as you well know.

For instance, there is a type of 'Vedic Thai Yoga Massage' that claims to
be 5000 years old, and which also claims this date for the Bh?gavatam, and
which explicitly states that Dhanvantari is a Vedic god. Yet, as far as I
was aware, and which Dagmar confirmed in another email, the Ashvins are the
Vedic gods related to healing, and any mention of Dhanvantari does not
appear until the current era. However, this 5000 yo date  asserts an
untenable date for the accepted range of the vedic period, itself; and
suggests that there is an unbroken lineage of Thai Yoga massage that
occurred even before the vedic period. However, there are many people
within yogaland who do not have any appreciation for historicity, and would
prefer for a sense of magic and wonder to reenchant their lives.
Organisational game theory explains that people would rather believe a
falsity *if* it is going to help them feel better. In fact, I have been
told that I simply do not know what I'm a talking about.

While you might not consider these types of enquires 'serious' scholarship,
they are important in the study of the global consumption of yoga-inflected
lifestyles within the multi-trillion dollar wellness industry, which
includes the construction of narratives to also suit socio, political,
economic aspirations of the Indian state through AYUSH and MEA.
Conveniently, this is what my current research project is about.

Thanks again for your help. And to Krishnaprasad for the mantra.



All the best,
