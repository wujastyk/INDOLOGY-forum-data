Dear Colleagues,

     Here is the URL for a vast collection of ?ik??s and  other
Lak?a?agranthas, thanks to the hard work of Peter Freund:

http://vedicreserve.mum.edu/shiksha/shiksha_vedicreserve.html

I have found this very useful, especially for numerous texts which have not
yet appeared in published editions.  I want to thank Peter Freund for his
service.
