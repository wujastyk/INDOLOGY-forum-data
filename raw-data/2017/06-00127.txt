Thanks Dominik and Nagaraj.


Yes, for course Tk. was (my own abbreviation) for Taluk. I am supposing Tuni is nowadays a 'mandal', although I haven't confirmed this yet.


Nagaraj: short of being able to travel to Tuni taluk/mandal to ask local people, how would one find out what "Ch." stands for in this case? And what cultural practice lies behind abbreviating the identifying part of toponym?


Best,

Place names beginning with initials is common in Telugu. This is not limited to agraharams.

"Tk" may be for "Taluk," though your online resource says it's a Tehsil.

The names of agraharams that I'm aware of in the Thanjavur district are not abbreviated in the way you describe.  Rather, they seem to be named always in full, even if long.

Thank you for villageinfo.in<http://villageinfo.in> ! Wonderful resource.

Best,
Dominik

Colleagues,


I am looking to identify the modern coordinates of an epigraphic find spot in Andhra Pradesh for which data from colonial times indicate "Chikula agrah?ra, East Godavari, Tuni Tk.". Searchuing with the name Chikulla or Chikulla I don't find anything. But within Tuni (mandal?) I have found a "Ch. Agraharam" (https://villageinfo.in/andhra-pradesh/east-godavari/tuni/ch-agraharam.html). This, I presume, must be my place.


Is it common in AP nowadays not to spell out the name of agraharams? (It reminds me of the Telugu naming pattern with a first initial which is never spelt in full ? although perhaps there is no connection.)


Best wishes,

Arlo
