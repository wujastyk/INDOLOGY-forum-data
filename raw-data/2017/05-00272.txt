This is an absolutely amazing achievement, many thanks for this!

It's great to see many important dictionaries on the list (e.g. Abhyankar, Hellwig, T?ntrik?bhidh?nako?a and even the new Olivelle's Dictionary of Law and Statescraft).

No doubt, this is an extremely helpful tool, but it should be added that full entries from original printed dictionaries are usually not included (at least in the case of the aboved mentioned dictionaries). So you will find basic meaning(s) here, but for a full entry it is still necessary to consult a printed book. Sometimes it adds a little to the NWS entry (typically more examples), but sometimes the printed entry is much more longer (esp. in the case ot the TAK).

This is not a criticism of the project, but a note for users what they should expect and what not.

So many thanks indeed for this tool, I am sure I will use it almost daily.
