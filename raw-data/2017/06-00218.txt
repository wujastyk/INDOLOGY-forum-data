Message-ID: <EBCC154F-CDB0-4714-B6B2-2392F58B1D2E@gmail.com>

** WSC2018 Special Panel Proposals Due this SATURDAY!
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Colleagues,

This is a final reminder that if you wish to organize a Special Panel at the 17th World Sanskrit Conference (Vancouver, Canada, July 9-13, 2018) you have until this SATURDAY, July 1, 2017, to submit a proposal the WSC2018 submissions portal (https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp) .

A special panel must be either 90 minutes or 120 minutes in length. It should focus on a common thematic or interdisciplinary topic, and be made up of three or four presenters. Other structures are also permitted--e.g., a roundtable format or perhaps a major lecture + 3-4 brief responses. If you have more than four participants, you may also propose two LINKED panels, made up of 6-8 presenters.

To submit a panel abstract for consideration, please visit the WSC 2018 Submissions Portal (https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp)  and follow the instructions for submitting a special panel proposal. Please also be sure to submit individual paper abstracts for each of the 3-4 papers within the panel, as well as the panel abstract.

Proposals will be assessed by the WSC2018 Academic Advisory Committee, and results will be announced by August 15, 2017. If your panel is not approved, individual papers may still be resubmitted for consideration before the regular deadline of October 1, 2017.

We look forward to your special panel ideas!

All inquiries may be directed to the WSC 2018 Secretariat at wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca (wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca) , and be sure to consult the conference website, wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca, for up-to-date information.
