Dear Jan,


thank you for your observations and proposals. In brief, we keep lists of
many more glossaries in our drawers, which we ourselves ?miss? no less
badly than you. We would have loved to add more, but the ?present stage of
the project? you refer to is actually its final stage. The ?Description?
provided on the search site informs the careful reader that funding was
granted by the DFG for three years only. Therefore, the
?volume of the data to be included had to be limited right from the outset,
and a manageable choice had to be made. What you get is what we could
manage to achieve in the allotted time.

Given that even the data base as such had to be developed in the course of
those three years and that every single entry of every single glossary had
to be adapted to the structure of the pw (hand-picked) for the purpose of
the intended synoptic representation ? not to speak of proof-reading ?, any
claim to completeness would have amounted to hubris. We have consciously
never made such a claim
?.?

Even though two works of Renou are deplorably missing, I agree, there are
still about fifteen other lexicographical works from Renou?s pen included
in the NWS, which spares you checking all of them separately when hunting
for a single word.

Since the NWS is almost limitlessly expandable, it is only a matter of
raising funds for completing it in a
?truly ?
satisfying manner. Everybody, who is interested in expanding it further, is
cordially invited to
?come up with feasible ideas for fundraising.
