Subject: [INDOLOGY] Yoga and Sexual Violence Conference/Workshop: Save the Date
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrDOAZY8FwEyAQTboAkYB5U4vsQhe9z24b7tSCrmFHDRAA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Thanks to funds made available through SARI <http://sari.anu.edu.au/>,
we are beginning to organise a small conference/workshop on 'Yoga and
Sexual Violence'. This builds on the conference we organised last year
about 'Yoga and the Body'
<http://sari.anu.edu.au/yoga-and-the-body-past-and-present/>.

The tentative timing for the conference is scheduled for the *second half
of 2017*. The most likely date is *sometime in November*, which is a lovely
time to be in Canberra, Australia.

A confirmed date, more information, and an official call for papers will
occur in the next few months. For now, we invite you to *save the date. *We
will consider all possibilities that explore the theme, which includes
perspectives that are grounded in philology, history, anthropology, and
beyond.

All the best,

Patrick McCartney, PhD
Fellow
School of Culture, History & Language
College of the Asia-Pacific
