Dear Matt,

According to Harvard?s library catalog, the Center for Research Libraries (CRL) has a copy of Indian Dialectics available through ILL. Their home base is in Chicago: 
(800) 621-6044 x773
Address:
6050 S. Kenwood Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637-2804

There is also a hardcopy in the Harvard library, so if you can?t get it any other way, let me know and I?ll make a PDF.

I?m happy to see you promote her work, which has otherwise remained in the shadows.

best,
Dan
