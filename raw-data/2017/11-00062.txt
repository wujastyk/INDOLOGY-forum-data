Subject: [INDOLOGY] Jaina Ramayana e-texts?
Message-ID: <0576025DE2E9AD4594E2FA73382B410624942339@xm-mbx-08-prod>

Dear All,

I was wondering whether anyone has a searchable e-text of Vimalasuri's Paumacariya and Ravisena's Padmapurana? I have electronic scans of both editions from Hermann Jacobi and Pannalal Jain respectively but neither are searchable.

Any help would be appreciated!

Best wishes,
