Subject: [INDOLOGY] Dissertation of Margaret Trawick Egnor
Message-ID: <930a17bc-2c83-4db6-c17d-4943ad21f5ac@univie.ac.at>

Dear List,
I am looking for the dissertation of M. Trawick Egnor "The Sacred Spell 
and Other Conceptions of Life in Tamil Culture", University of Chicago, 
1978. 
(http://southasiadissertations.uchicago.edu/content/egnor-margaret-trawick)
Seemingly it was not published afterwards. Does anyone have a PDF of 
this? I would be very grateful.

Best,
Vitus Angermeier
