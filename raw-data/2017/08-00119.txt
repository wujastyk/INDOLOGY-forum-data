Thank you Naturaj-ji.

My question essentially is: what exactly is the unmanifest aspect of the creation?

It withdraws into its avyakta form (because n?bh?v? vidyat? satah) . What happens later? The new cycle of time/creation begins. What does that mean? All that is withdrawn into avyakta comes back into vyakta form. (because n?sat? vidyat? bh?vah)
