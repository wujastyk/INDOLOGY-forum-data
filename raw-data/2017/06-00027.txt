On the an?c?ras of the Kerala Brahmins, see the appendices to my wife
Marjatta Parpola's book "Kerala Brahmins in transition: A study of a
Namp?tiri family" (Studia Orientalia 91), Helsinki: The Finnish Oriental
Society, xii, 436 pp. In the appendices (pp. 403-425)  I reproduce
???karasm?ti 1,12,4 in Sanskrit and its Malayalam commentary with an
annotated English translation of the former. My wife then discusses
Logan's, Fawcett's and S. Venkitasubramonia Iyer's discussions of these
rules, and finally I reproduce Gundert's Keral'-achara-sancshepam.
Pdf(s) of the book('s chapters) can be downloaded freely from

Withe best regards and wishes, Asko
