Subject: [INDOLOGY] Grammar of the Jain phrase

Interesting suggestion. It is possible for m? + icch?mi to be micch?mi in
Ardham?gadh? (or pseudo-Ardham?gadh?) because lopa-sandhi is common in such
contexts (see Pischel ?158), but since the phrase occurs in the context of
the pratikrama?a, and in a few cases specifically refers to the evil of an
already-committed transgression (ja? kha??iya? ja? vir?hiya? tassa micch?
mi dukka?a?), it seems more natural to me to read it in the traditional way
rather than as a resolution not to desire evil deeds in the future.
