XVIIIth Congress of the International Association of Buddhist Studies
August 20th to the 25th, 2017
University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada

THIRD CIRCULAR

Dear Colleagues, Dear Friends:

I am very happy to send you the Third Circular for the XVIIIth Congress of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, which will be held in Toronto at the University of Toronto campus, August 20th to the 25th, 2017.

On behalf of the IABS, my university, and the conference?s Planning Committee, I warmly submit this final circular for you to consult for the Congress schedule, the panels and section papers, the evening events, and additional information to help you plan your time in Toronto.

We encourage all IABS members to attend the Congress in Toronto, and ask that you please circulate this document through our many communities of colleagues, students, and supporters, so that everyone feels welcome to attend and participate in the events this summer.

General Information

Please allow me to once more remind everyone that they must be a fully paid member of IABS for the year 2017 in order to attend the event, deliver a paper or sit on a panel in Toronto. IABS membership fees were due by December 31, 2016, but can still be paid retroactively anytime this year. IABS membership can be secured through the online form at the IABS website: www.iabsinfo.net<http://www.iabsinfo.net/>. Initial enquiries about eligibility should be sent to the association?s Secretary General, Dr. Ulrich Pagel (up1 at soas.ac.uk<mailto:up1 at soas.ac.uk>).

The Planning Committee received an overwhelming amount of excellent and exciting submissions, and it was with a heavy heart that we were not able to accept every paper. I wish to still encourage everyone who was not able to present this year to still attend the events in Toronto. Presentation of a paper is not required to attend the Congress, and everyone is subject to the same Congress registration fee.

Online Congress registration opened October 1st, 2016, and will close just prior to the start of the proceedings, August 18th, 2017. Please see below for further details on how to register, information about the fee structure, as well as the amenities covered by the fee.

Though our field spans myriad linguistic regions and our members represent diverse language backgrounds, it is IABS policy that official Congress proceedings, including papers and presentations, be conducted in an English-language medium.

All future communication will be distributed via email. Please write to me, Christoph Emmrich, directly, if you have any questions about future communications. My address is found at the bottom of this circular under ?Correspondent,? or on our website here: http://www.iabs2017-uoft.ca/contact/. If you wish to update or confirm your correct email address, please write to Nicholas Field (nicholas.field at utoronto.ca<mailto:nicholas.field at utoronto.ca>), who oversees our Congress mailing list.

Visa Information

I understand that the process to secure a visa to Canada is difficult for some of our members, but since visa requirements vary from country to country, I regret that I and my team cannot offer assistance or advice in securing a Canadian Visa. I strongly encourage you to contact the Canadian Embassy or Consulate closest to you, to begin the visa process immediately.

Presenters requiring a formal letter of invitation are requested to contact my Academic Coordinator, Tony Scott, at anthony.scott at utoronto.ca<mailto:anthony.scott at utoronto.ca>. For those registered participants not presenting a paper or acting in a formal capacity at the Congress, Tony is happy to prepare a formal letter confirming that you have paid the full fee, and are registered for the Congress.

Airlines
Registered Congress participants plus one accompanying person travelling to the Congress can qualify for a discount of up to 20% with the Star Alliance Network, which includes Air Canada, depending on fare and class of travel booked. I invite you to use the Conventions Plus online booking tool<http://conventionsplusbookings.staralliance.com/trips/StarHome.aspx?meetingcode=AC05S17> on our website, and to read about the participating airlines: http://www.iabs2017-uoft.ca/travel-and-accommodation/partners-travels/star-alliance/. If you have any questions or concerns, please write to Alexander O?Neill (alexander.oneill at mail.utoronto.ca<mailto:alexander.oneill at mail.utoronto.ca>), a member of my team in charge of travel and accommodation.

Accommodation
Allow me to direct everyone to our Congress website for information on hotels around the Congress: http://www.iabs2017-uoft.ca/travel-and-accommodation/. Since the Congress venue is in the heart of downtown Toronto, and as August is a busy time of year, I encourage you to book as soon as you are able. I welcome you to write Alexander (alexander.oneill at mail.utoronto.ca<mailto:alexander.oneill at mail.utoronto.ca>) if you have any questions, but please note that you are responsible for securing your own accommodations while at the Congress.

Registration
Registration will take place on Sunday, August 20th, from 10:00 ? 18:00, at the Bahen Centre Atrium. Pre-registration in the same location starts on Saturday, August 19th, from 15:00 to 18:00. If you are expecting a late arrival, you may still register at any time during the week at the Congress Registration and Information Desk, in the Bahen Centre Atrium.

Registration Fee
In addition to the IABS membership fees, all participants will need to pay a Congress registration fee used to help us cover the cost of hosting the event, stipulated below. This fee includes attendance at all Congress panels, sections, roundtables and workshops, tea and coffee, lunches served throughout the week, and the Welcome and Farewell dinners. The registration fee does not include travel, accommodation, food outside of lunch or the two dinners, excursions, or other special events.

I ask those planning to register to please make use of our online, secure payment system at the official XVIIIth IABS website: http://www.iabs2017-uoft.ca/registration/. The preferred method of payment is by credit card, but we can also accept a cheque or bank draft, in Canadian Dollars only. Please send any cheques or bank drafts to the following address:

Duncan Hill
University of Toronto Mississauga
Department of Historical Studies
EH 209 C
3359 Mississauga Road
Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6
Canada

All cheques should be made out to ?The University of Toronto.? We regret that we can only accept fees in Canadian Dollars. Online congress registration opened October 1st, 2016, and will close just prior to the start of the proceedings, August 18th, 2017. Registration after this date and during the Congress can be made on-site at the Congress Registration and Information Desk, Bahen Centre Atrium, in cash (CAD), cheque, or bank draft.

Graduate students who are presenting a paper at the Congress, and who are from countries with low currency exchange rates when compared to the Canadian Dollar, may request a fee reduction by writing to me directly at the address provided below. Decisions on fee reduction will be made on a case-by-case basis, but I encourage you to apply.

Conference Travel Grants
Unfortunately, the Planning Committee is not able to offer any travel grants for the XVIIIth Congress.

Audio Visual Equipment
The Congress venue is fully equipped with audio and visual equipment to suit the needs of our presenters. Should your presentation require additional equipment or other special requests, feel free to contact my Academic Coordinator, Tony Scott (anthony.scott at utoronto.ca<mailto:anthony.scott at utoronto.ca>), who would be glad to assist you.

Roundtables and Workshop
Several roundtables and a workshop of an academic nature have been initiated by individual IABS members and Congress sponsors, and the Planning Committee and I are honoured to host these events in the evening, after the regular academic programming concludes. A full list of these events is available below.

Exhibitors
The Planning Committee and I have invited several leading publishers in our field to present their services and products to Congress participants. Exhibition space will be in the Bahen Centre Atrium, and accessible throughout the Congress proceedings. A full list of the exhibitors attending the Congress will be made available on the website, and a publisher?s panel will also be part of the evening presentations on Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017. If you have any questions about the exhibitors participating in the XVIIIth IABS Congress, please write to Tamara Cohen (tamara.cohen at mail.utoronto.ca<mailto:tamara.cohen at mail.utoronto.ca>), part of my team here in Toronto.
