Hello M?ns,

     In part you may be dealing with Madhva's citations that are considered
to be imagined texts by the critics of the M?dhvas.  For a critique of this
practice of Taptamudr?dh?ra?a, you can consult Appayya D?k?ita's
Madhvatantramukhamardana and Bha??oji D?k?ita's Tantr?dhik?rinir?aya.
Perhaps these critiques contain some discussion of the Madhvaite sources
for this practice.
