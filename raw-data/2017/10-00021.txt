A quick look in the index of Ludo Rocher's fine history of puranic
literature shows an *Au?anasapur??a*, which is probably what Singh is
trying to refer to.  P. 138 gives more information about this "lost"
pur??a, which is sometimes conflated with the *Vindhyam?h?tmya*, that Singh
also cites.  That's probably the basis of the information that Singh is
garbling.
