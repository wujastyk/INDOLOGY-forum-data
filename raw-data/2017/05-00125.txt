Not taking the subject specification above rigidly, I would like to make three points:
(a) Even in studying stories one should try to ascertain if they pertain to Vy?kara?a Pata?jali, Yoga Pata?jali or?? ?yurveda Pata?jali.
(b) The tradition of the identity of these three Pata?jalis may be older than it is usually taken to be. 
(c) In three interlinked articles published in the book mentioned below, I have made a case for taking the Vy?kara?a Pata?jali as a person belonging to Kashmir. I have also pointed out that the epithet Gonard?ya (<? Gonand?ya) definitely applies to this Pata?jali and that the epithet Go?ik?-putra may also contain historical information about him. Much history can be gleaned if the stories are cautiously handled.
