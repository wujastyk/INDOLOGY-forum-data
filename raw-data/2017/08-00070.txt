Dear colleagues,

Both examples have nothing to do with *pa?ku*~.


(1) The first example from the *Paumacariu*:

*katth?riya-pa?kuppa?kiu* < *kast?rik?* (?musk?)+ *pa?ka* (?unguent?) + *
*ut-pa?kita* (?besmeared?; cf. Naresh Kumar, *Apabhra??a-Hindi Dictionary*,
Nehru Nagar 1987: Indo-Vision Private Limited, vol. I, p. 124r, s.v.
*uppa?kiya*; cf. also Skt. *pa?kayati* ?besmears?).


(2) The second example from the *Sanatkum?racaritam*:

Jacobi?s edition (*Sanatkum?racaritam: Ein Abschnitt aus Haribhadras
Nemin?thacaritam. Eine Jaina Legende in Apabhra??a*, hrsg. von Hermann
Jacobi, M?nchen 1921: Verlag der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften,
p. 37) in fact reads *sayala-mahivalaya-panku* (i.e. -*pa?ku*). Only the
input data on the internet reads "*sayala-mahivalaya-pauku*". One must
discern "edition" made by the great scholar from "data" input by
somebody. *Sayala-mahivalaya-pa?ku
*means ?mud in the whole world? (?der Schlamm im ganzen Lande?, *ibid.*, p.
76). However, *pa?ku* is a *nom. sg. masc. form* of *pa?ka *in Apabhra??a.


Therefore, both examples quoted here are of *pa?ka*: (1) *pa?ka + u- *(*>
pa?ku-*), (2) nom. sg. masc. *pa?ku*.


With best regards,

Seishi Karashima
