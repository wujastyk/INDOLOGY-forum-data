How do we know that these dreams are not literay devices but also dreams?

How this device is deployed, and then what the relationship between such deployment and manuals of dream interpretation (and as you know apparently the best example is that of Jagaddeva, but as you also know there are others, especially later, at least in Jain tradition). I have been assuming--perhaps wrongly?--that such manuals actually aim at 'real' dreams, as a tool to help one understand what one has dreamt. Thus I haven't looked into them in this regard...
