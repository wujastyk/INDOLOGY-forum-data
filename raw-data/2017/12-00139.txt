Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pedantic Indic fonts
Message-ID: <dd27a342-f51d-4b23-c286-0753162b075a@cam.ac.uk>

Dear all,

For the past while, I've been adding glyphs and features to the Indic 
fonts that I use, in order to make better manuscript transcriptions. 
I've now put these fonts on GitHub 
(https://github.com/chchch/PedanticIndic). There are currently three 
fonts: Pedantic Devan?gar?, Pedantic Malay?lam, and Pedantic Telugu. For 
more information and font samples, see 
https://chchch.github.io/PedanticIndic/.

For all three fonts, you can input vowel signs as independent 
characters. This is useful for indicating when a vowel sign has been 
added or deleted. Some consonant conjunct forms can also be input 
independently. See the webpage above for details.

Pedantic Devan?gar? is based on Sanskrit2003 (license unknown), with the 
addition of the p???ham?tr? vowel sign (U+094E), pu?pik? (U+A8F8), 
?irorekha (U+A8FB), and the Jaina o?k?ra sign (U+A8FD).

Pedantic Malay?lam is based on Rachana (OFL 1.1/GPLv3+), with the 
addition of the chillu m (U+0D54) and some conjunct forms.

Pedantic Telugu is based on Pothana2000 (GPLv2+), with the addition of 
the valapalagilaka character.

This is very much work-in-progress; feel free to leave comments and 
suggestions on the GitHub issues page 
(https://github.com/chchch/PedanticIndic/issues) or even to add your own 
contributions.

Happy new year,

Charles
