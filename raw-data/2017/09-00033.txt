Dear Madhav,

Thank you for letting us know. Only a few months ago, at the beginning of
June, he gave what I thought was a very inspiring presentation at the
Translation and Transmission Conference in Boulder, Colorado. He used
examples, mostly from the Bodhicary?vat?ra, of getting to the intended
meaning of particular words used by an author. He showed how easy it was to
miss this when translating, and indicated ways to arrive at it.

Afterwards, I asked him if he intended to publish his English translation
of the Bodhicary?vat?ra, on which he had spent so much time determining the
intent of the author. He said that he hoped to, but that he could not say
much more then, apparently because of possibilities with more than one
publisher. He seemed vibrant, and gave no sign of any health problems. I
hope that this important work of his, if it is in fact finished (or nearly
so), will not be lost.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
