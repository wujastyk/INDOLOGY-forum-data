Dear colleagues!
I would deeply appreciate if someone could provide me with a pdf-file of Badrinath Sastri's edition of Raghunatha Siroma?i's Kira?avaliprakasadidhiti (Benares: Princess of Wales Sarasvati Bhavana Texts 38, 1932) as well as bio-data of Badrinath Sastri.
Thanks in advance!
Olle Qvarnstr?m (Lund University)
