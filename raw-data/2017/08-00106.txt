Since it takes a couple of years for an article to go from submission to
publication in JAOS, the three-year paywall means that JSTOR readers are
reading five-year-old research.  Older, if you factor-in the writing and
research period before submission.

Plus, JSTOR membership itself isn't free.   Many of us don't notice this,
but a pandit in Thanjavur, for example, can't read the JAOS on JSTOR.

Best,
