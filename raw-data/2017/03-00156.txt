Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Frits Staal memorial volume has just been published
Message-ID: <CAP1Y1zsBzdOkX0BYsGxosS-Noo8LaP-2cHdBcd3npk08koVukg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear  colleagues,

We, Richard Payne and I, have just published a memorial volume in honor of
Frits Staal: "On Meaning and Mantras: Essays on Honor of Frits Staal."  It
is published by the Institute of Buddhist Studies and BDK America.  It is
comparable in length and substance to the 1997 Festschrift devoted to
Frits: "India and Beyond: Aspects of Literature, Meaning, Ritual and
Thought."

Richard and I, both former students of Frits at Berkeley, both contributed
to that Festschrift, now 20 years ago.  Now we offer a memorial volume to
him comparable in length and substance to that Festschrift.  Our new book
contains 32 substantial articles amounting to 642 pages, written by eminent
Indologists.  I will attach a table of contents to this email, because our
colleague and friend, S. Palaniappan, who has contributed a paper to our
memorial volume, has asked us to do so.

I apologize for the mis-spelling of Frits's name in these attachments.  My
son, Nik, who knew Frits well when we lived in Berkeley, used the more
familiar spelling.  He is my tech person these days.

Now that I have completed this memorial for Frits, I am now doing another
one for my wife Susan.

Best to all.

George Thompson
