Artur-ji,

Spells that you mention belong to the category of Shaabara mantras,
sometimes called siddha mantras or Shaabara Siddha mantras. These are not
in Sanskrit. They are usually in regional Indian languages (including south
Indian languages), particularly their rustic dialects.

Sharing the snapshot of a Hindi article. (Since you know Hindi, you should
be able to follow). There are books and articles about these in regional
Indian languages.

You called hem mysterious. They consider them to be encryption.

You say Ismail Jogi is contradictio in adiecto. To those who are aware of
several different 'Hindu'-Islamic syncretisms in India it doesn't appear to
be contradictio in adiecto.
