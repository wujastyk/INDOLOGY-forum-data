About T. Ganapati Sastri, I recently discovered that Sanskrit letters by him to Sylvain L?vi and other scholars were edited in the Journal of the Kerala University Oriental Research Institute and Manuscripts Library, see:

> (I have 2 notes while reading the above list 
> 1.Please bear my English Grammar mistakes. 
> 2. Some of the books I was not able to procure at that time like Appa Shatry Rashiwadekar's book etc, which I could collect few of them later and I can say Appa Shastry writings are excellent and stand top among all)

'?????????????? ????????' ??????? ????????????????????????????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????? ???????... ???????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????? ..???????... ??? ??????????????? ???????.... ??????????

> 2. Ganapaty Shastry T editor of Bhasanataka chakra( his preface and Pathavali reader which is available on archives.org,   and Bharatanuvarnanam)
> 3. Appa Shastry Rashiwadekar (Lavanyamayi, preface of Buddha charita etc available on DLI)
> 4. Charudeva Shastry ( Gandhi Charita which contains aorist in almost all sentences. Vakyamuktavali has special sentences. Prastava Tarangini which has verbs with Upasarga which is the most difficult thing in Sanskrit Like ?????????=occupies, ????????????=aggrees etc.)
> 5. Prefaces of old Sanskrit books ( Vindhyeshwar Prasad Dwivedi, Appa Shastry Rashiwadekar, Charudeva Shastry, Ganapati Shatry T, Venimadhava Shukla, Rajanarayana Shukla, )
> 
> 6. Writings from Sanskrit Journals like Sahrdaya, Chandrika etc

If, as we were talking about at an earlier point in this exchange, we want to give students regular little success experiences, then the right amount of notes, given in a format they are used to and right there on the page, to me seems the best way forward.

The challenge then is to provide all this without making such a wealth of notes confusing rather than helpful.
