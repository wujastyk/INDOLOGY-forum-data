Gentlemen,

for an evaluation of Mislav Jezic's analysis of layers in the Bhagavadg?t?,
see:

Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee, "Paradigm Lost: The Application of the
Historical-Critical Method to the Bhagavadg?t?," *International Journal of
Hindu Studies *20, no. 2 (2016): 199?301.

The article is uploaded here:
https://www.academia.edu/30431442/Paradigm_Lost

See especially the table on pages 259?261. The proposed criteria for
identifying historical layers in the G?t? do not work; and unless we can
provide new criteria or arguments, we are recirculating old and discredited
literature. Brockington's arguments in "The Bhagavadg?t?: Text and
Context,? in Lipner, ed., 28?47 are also addressed in the article; we show
his claims are reliant on Georg von Simson's work, and he does not propose
any arguments.

The reasons for the interest in different versions of the G?t? are
addressed here:
https://www.academia.edu/24302441/Whos_Zoomin_Who_Bhagavadg%C4%ABt%C4%81_Recensions_in_India_and_Germany

We discuss the untenability of the oral bardic epic hypothesis in our
forthcoming book *Philology and Criticism: A Guide to Mah?bh?rata Textual
Criticism*. It should be in print in two months or so; I will announce it
here as soon as it is out.
