Dear Colleagues,

Indica et Buddhica is now publishing monographs, critical editions and
edited volumes in classical Indian and Buddhist Studies. We would be
pleased to receive proposals for print and ebook projects.

If you have begun working on a project then we would suggest that you
send a publication proposal as early as possible. Even if your work is
already well progressed a proposal will still help in the evaluation.

Further details, including proposal forms, are available on this page:

 Indica et Buddhica -- Author guidelines

Here is a proof-of-concept edition showing our current typesetting:

With best regards,

  Richard
