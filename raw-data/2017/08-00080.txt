Subject: [INDOLOGY] Starting a new academic journal
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cfs3o0r1euQLpY5CKDY-QS-KAA+F9x4CPyjD3_ggkR6Vg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

New academic journals spring up with surprising frequency.  Indeed, I
launched one <http://hssa-journal.org> myself.  I am surprised, however, to
see how many of the journals relevant to Indology still function on what I
think of as the "old model," and are run as for-profit enterprises by
commercial companies like Springer, Elsevier, Brill and others, whose first
duty is not to the growth of knowledge, but to their shareholders.

This problem of forked loyalty was starkly demonstrated this last week,
when Cambridge University Press bowed to pressure from the Chinese
Government, and voluntarily censored the content of its journal *China
Quarterly,* withdrawing 300 articles that touched on topics sensitive to
the PRC's communist government including the Tienanmen Square massacre and
Tibet.  The reason given by the press was (in my words) that it was willing
to sacrifice intellectual integrity for the purpose of continuing to sell

as a result of widespread incredulity and outrage from the academic
establishment.  It might be uncharitable to view it this way, but one can't
help thinking that CUP continues make decisions based on the bottom line,
and has simply decided that it stands to lose more by alienating its
domestic academic market than the Chinese one.

There are now robust alternatives to the old model.  For many years, the Public
Knowledge Project <https://pkp.sfu.ca/> at Canada's Simon Fraser University
has been distributing excellent free software for running academic
