Generally vandhy?s?tas and ?a???gas are examples of what the 
Ny?ya-Vai?e?ika philosophers refer to as "aprasiddha" terms, i.e. terms 
that have no established object-correlate in the real world. In 
Navya-Ny?ya texts, the term atyanta(abh?va) is used to describe the 
temporal extension of an absence but not its spatial extension (i.e. the 
extent of its occurrence in real-world objects), hence Ingalls and 
others translate it as "constant absence". In theory, anything (apart 
from keval?nvayin properties and perhaps other special types of 
properties or entities) could be the counterpositive of a constant 
absence at least in a particular location or set of locations. The 
Ny?yako?a defines it as : yad vastu yatra na kad?pi bhavi?yati na ca 
kad?cid bh?ta? tasya vastunas tatr?tyant?bh?vo mantavya? | yath? v?yau 
r?pa? n?st?ti prat?tis?k?iko 'bh?va? |

So an example could be the constant absence of colour in the wind.

Best regards,
