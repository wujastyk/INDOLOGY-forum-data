Dear Friends, Would anyone happen to know if Carlo Formichi's Italian
translation of the *N?tis?ra*, serialized in the Giornale della societ?
asiatica italiana (e.g.  Book 7 in vol. 14), was completed? and/or if it
has been republished in a collected form? I am having trouble just figuring
out which volumes and years it spans in the journal. Thanks,J
