Dear Friends, Thanks so much for your ongoing valuable input and patience
with my
questioning. I would like to crowdsource once more and ask: are there are
early translations/adaptations into South Asian languages that you admire,
or modern translations into South Asian languages that you find especially
beautiful and/or learned? There are endless modern translations of a very
literal sort, but for example Caitanyad?sa's [16th-century?] translation
into Bangla is an extraordinary literary work and commentary in one. I have
a feeling there are other works out there in languages, which I haven't
learned to read. I will be grateful for any thoughts you have. Best,
??????,J
