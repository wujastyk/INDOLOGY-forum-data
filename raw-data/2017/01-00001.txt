Dear Patrick,

in Indian dance technique, the proper Sanskrit word for "arrai mandi" is ardhamaNDalI.

 Dear Friends,?
 Mostly just for a bit of fun I am translating a
 video of a friend's yoga class from her website into
 Sanskrit. Having transcribed her instructions I am now in
 the process of translating it. This is also part of a larger
 (side)-project to look at the 'grammar of yoga
 classes'. I am trying to build up a corpus of linguistic
 material from yoga classes. I will eventually add to the
 video transliterated subtitles and a dubbed audio channel as
 well.?
 My question for the list is: how you might
 translate pli?, as in a pli?
 squat.?
 Below are some terms for 'squatting'
 in spokensanskrit.de, but
 I'm curious to know if there is a more closer way to
 translate it than the options below.
 
 ???????utkuTakaadj.squatting???????????paryaGkabaddhaadj.squatting???????palyaGkam.squatting
 I'm wondering if there is a
 bh?ratan??yam term that might get closer. My
 current choice is: arrai mandi, however, as someone
 who has 0% knowledge of Tamil, I'm not sure if I have
 transliterated this correctly OR if it is the best choice of
 dance positions that represents a pli?
 squat.?
 Thanks in advance.
 
 All
 the best,
