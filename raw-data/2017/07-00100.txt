 Dr.Tieken,

              I truly apologise  ,if my query being forwarded as an attachment has caused any 

agony for you.

                     All that I was asking for were the meaning of a few words which I came 

across while studying Bhamati, a book on Adwaitya Philosophy written by Bachaspati Misra in 

the  8th CE . I was surprised why it came in as an attachment because all that I did was 

forwarding and repeating  my query which I made a few day's back

   

                     Anyway I would be vigilant in future and avoid attachments so that our 

learning endeavours  does not get impeded  due to miscellaneous reasons.





                                                    ALAKENDU DAS.
