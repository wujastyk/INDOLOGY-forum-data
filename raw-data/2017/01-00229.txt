There is no consensus about which language or languages the Harappan (Indus Valley Civilization) people spoke.

The script is considered by most to be logo-syllabic, not heiroglyphic. 

Farmer, Witzel, Sproat consider it to be a sign system rather than a script associated with any particular language.

 To All,
 
 While going through some books on Indus valley civilisation , I failed to find out one 
answer. Though the Harappana & Mohenjo daro script has been inferred as more of a Hieroglyphic 
type, what dialect/language did they speak ? 
Would love to be enlightened on this point.


 ALAKEND DAS.
