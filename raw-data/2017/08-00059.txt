 To all,

             I came across the following qoute while going through  a book on Buddhist Philosophy-             

                     " Bauddhanam Sugato Deva Vishwam cha Kshanabhanguram".

        Can anybody may kindly suggest as to which Buddhist philosopher can the above be ascribed to.? I am struggling to find one philosopher who advocated KshanikaVada or Momentaryness?



                              Alakendu Das.
