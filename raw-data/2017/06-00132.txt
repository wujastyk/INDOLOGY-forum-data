I've done some more Devanagari font testing, and the results can be viewed
here
<https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xrWfqTJ9Xjo/WUXAcgjxhVI/AAAAAAAApRA/36wC0n2gjlQQB9bNDnTGGPjD13veSgoXQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2017-06-17%2B17-48-08.png>.


The TeX code that produced this is in my blog
<https://cikitsa.blogspot.ca/2017/06/expanded-devanagari-font-comparison.html>
.

Of the fonts tried out, only Sanskrit 2003, Murty Sanskrit, and Shobhika do
the right things with *?a?tri??ad*.

Best,
Dominik
