Dear Birgit,

Thank you for letting us know about this new publication in the series,
Sanskrit Texts from the Tibetan Autonomous Region. This is very helpful.
Having just placed an order for volumes in this important series, I would
not have checked again any time soon. The Pa?ca?atik? Praj??p?ramit? is of
particular interest because it was classified by Jo nang Dol po pa and
others as one of the five s?tras of definitive meaning, n?t?rtha.

As noted in its description, "an influence of the Consciousness-only or
Yog?c?ra school can clearly be seen." For Dol po pa, the doctrine of the
Yog?c?ra school is not Consciousness-only, or Mind-only, but rather is
"Great Madhyamaka." This latter is for Jonangpas the definitive meaning of
the Yog?c?ra texts, and that is why this Praj??p?ramit? text that
explicitly uses Yog?c?ra ideas is regarded by them as being of definitive
meaning. The other Praj??p?ramit? texts, forming the basis of the common
Madhyamaka school, are for the "Great Madhyamaka" school of interpretable
meaning, ney?rtha.

The above little side note is said by way of possibly attracting more
interest to this valuable new publication. Many of us waited decades for
access to the Sanskrit Buddhist texts known to be preserved in Tibet, but
entirely inaccessible under the Chinese government. I am immensely grateful
to Ernst Steinkellner and his colleagues who, after many years of efforts,
succeeded in gaining access to some of these texts. This resulted in the
series, Sanskrit Texts from the Tibetan Autonomous Region, now 20 volumes!

Best regards,

David Reigle
