>From A. Gaur, Catalogue of Malayalam Books in the British Museum, 1971, col. 110, these two references:

? d?vag?ta? g?tag?vindatti??e svatantraparibh??a. D?va-g?ta, a free translation in Malayalam verse by Ca??ampu?a K???a Pi??a, with introduction by the translator, Trichur : Mangalodayam Press, 1946.

? ma?iprav?????apadi athav? la?itag?tag?vinda?. Ma?iprav?????apadi, or La?ita-g?ta-g?vinda?, a rendering in ma?iprav??am verse, by K. V. R?ma V?riyar, Ottapalam : Kamalalaya Press, 1921.

The second one could correspond to R?mapurattu V?ryar?s work.

There must exist several other translations in Malayalam.

Below, a few references from a quick check with a local on-line bookseller (note that the second item is an edition of R?mapurattu V?ryar?s work).

Testifying for the immense popularity of the GG in Kerala : in the Malayam novel The Legend of Khasak (khas?kki??e itih?sa?) by O. V. Vijayan (1969, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khasakkinte_Itihasam ), at the end of the chapter 9 examined by Francis Zimmermann (http://ginger.tessitures.org/malayalam/fiction-contemporaine/khasak/ ) a anonymous Sanskrit stanza is quoted, which is, as I myself noticed, nothing else than GG 1.16.

> Hi Nagaraj, The whole thing will be weighted toward English, but I will include the most major stuff in some Indian (and other European) languages, especially the major secondary works in Bengali. This will of course be somewhat restricted to what I can read, which is pretty much only Bengali and Hindi. I will also make at least some reference to the translations, virtually in any Indian language you can name, as you know. There are so many translations in Indian and other languages that I will not be able to treat them in great detail. I think there are at least about 10 in Bengali. I'm sure there might be even more in Oriya. So the short answer is: I will try not to do an injustice to scholarship in Indian languages, though I won't be able to treat it comprehensively.    
> 
> One area of concern is that I cannot read Oriya, and yet I know there must be at least some good scholarship in Oriya (apart from the flood of more popular literature).  If you or someone you know can give me some pointers here I would be very grateful.
