Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about mixed oral/manuscript transmission
In-Reply-To: <CAJGj9eb2R7rnoHBOjNo8_xRUqoPgXoZojoW-XAJoxH8Q4i3o2g@mail.gmail.com>

One distinction that is important here is the distinction between dual
transmission of a text and the same (dual transmission) of a narrative or a
narrative system made up of sub-narratives. In the former, the comparison
can be made between the actual words of the text in the two versions.  The
questioner uses the phrase ' texts transmitted'. But he also focuses on '
the displacement of episodes ' which pertains to the latter among the above
two modes of transmission, i.e., dual transmission of a narrative or a
narrative system made up of sub-narratives.

PalnaaTi Veeracharitramu, Naishadham/Nalacharitramu,
Saarangadharacharitramu etc. belong to the dual transmission of a narrative
or a narrative system made up of sub-narratives and not to dual
transmission of a text .

But they seem to be relevant here because the question seems to be focused
on displacement of episodes etc.
