I am sure that someone must already have mentioned Rachel Fell 
McDermott's twin books /Mother of my Heart, Daughter of My Dreams//. 
K?l? and Um? in the Devotional Poetry of Bengal/ and /Singing to the 
Goddess. Poems to K?l? and Um? from Bengal/, both Oxford UP, 2001.

Best wishes,
Rosane Rocher //
