Subject: [INDOLOGY] Fwd: question regarding Sanskrit Gana
In-Reply-To: <9967E21E-560B-493F-9E45-436DDDB20D26@austin.utexas.edu>

The following article might be relevant as well:

Wadhwani, Yashodhara: Trika-s in metrical music and in tantric
mantra-s. In: Sa?skr?ta-sa?g?ta-jagad??var? = Jewels in Sanskrit and
musicology: ?c?rya Jagad??a Sah?ya Kula?re??ha abhinandana grantha,
ed. by Su?am? Kula?re??ha et al. Dill?, 1995; p. 441-449.

If I remember its contents correctly, some tantric text(s) associate
each ga?a with one of the pa?cabh?ta-s and other elements. Since fire
and water are incompatible, a fire ga?a should never occur next to a
water ga?a. According to Wadhwani, this indeed conforms to prosodical
practice. I don?t recall exactly which ga?a-s conform to fire and
water, only that this rule seemed to me to make sense from a
metrical/rhythmical point of view.

Unless someone on this list can provide a digital copy of this
article, I could make a scan of it in about two weeks.

Best,

Thomas Kintaert
