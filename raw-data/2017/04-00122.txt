Yes, understood.

Incidentally, Chandrabhal Tripathi's introduction to his catalogue of the
Jaina MSS in Strasbourg discusses these many-to-one and one-to-many
problems well, as presented by manuscripts.  His introduction is worthy of
being treated as a good primer on manuscript studies in general.

Best wishes,
Dominik Wujastyk
