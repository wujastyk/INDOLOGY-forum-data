Ashok,

Thank you for your further thoughts. I do see that the metaphorical 
meaning is possible (that is why I asked my question in the first 
place), but what I wanted to know was whether it is actually attested 
anywhere. K?tav?gdv?re comes close; thanks for bringing that to my 
attention. I still incline towards my emended version, though.

The querent (pra???) is the person asking the astrologer about acquiring 
a kingdom. I give the preceding verses below so that you can see the 
context. You will notice that there are quite a few technical terms of 
Arabic derivation (mutta?il, muthallatha, maqb?l, and, if I am right, 
idb?r).

Best wishes,
Martin
