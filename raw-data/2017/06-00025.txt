It seems that  Burnell refers here with this alternative (?) title (not found in the catalogues of MSS. from Kerala at hand, still to check in the NCC) to the Laghudharmaprak??ik? attributed to one ???kara, also known as ???karasm?ti (ed. and English transl. N.P. Unni, Torino [Corpus Iuris Sanscriticum, 4], 2003 ; Unni dates the text to the 14th century AD; see also his Highways and Byways in Sanskrit Literature, New Delhi: Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2012, vol. 1 pp. 393-415 ; and A Survey of Smrti Literature, Thiruvananthapuram: International School of Dravidian Linguistics, 2013, pp. 153-158). On the an?c?ras of Kerala, see also C. Lalitha Kumari,  Laghudharmaprak??ik?: A Study, Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2004, pp. 116-38 (with a discussion of the term) and the Appendices (by Asko Parpola) in Parpola, Marjatta Kerala Brahmins in Transition: A Study of a Namp?tiri Family, Helsinki: the Finnish Oriental Society (Studia Orientalia, 91), 2000, pp. .

> I found an interesting reference in A. C. Burnell's The Ordinances of Manu, (Intro. p. xxxvii) to a work titled An?c?ranir?aya composed in Kerala to discuss "deviations" from Brahmanical Dharma??stras.  According the footnote on this page, this work was evidently attributed to ?a?kara.  This may be the source of ??ma??str? Dravi?a Dvivedi using the expression ?c?rya??padagdha to refer to these regions.  Here is the passage from Burnell:
