Message-ID: <20170515112856.3729.qmail@f4mail-235-166.rediffmail.com>



 To All,

         I qoute from the Introductory preface from  Bachaspati Misra's BHAMATI'  where he 

writes,while pledging his respect for Badarayana -



                              ' Brahmasutra Krte Tasmai Bedbyasyaya Bedase



                                 GyanshaktaAvataraya namo BHAGAVATE HARE'



  

   My question remains- Was  Bachaspati Misra was a Vaishnava.?





                                                               ALAKENDU  DAS.
