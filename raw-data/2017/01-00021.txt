Madhav,

The same mode of expression is very common in inscriptions to indicate in which branch of the Veda a person was trained: X-sabrahmac?rin.

Best wishes for the new year,

Tim

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] {???????????????????} Re: a question regarding the usage of -gotra versus -sagotra

To add more of a grammatical note, a term like vi?v?mitra-gotra in Sanskrit can have two possible meanings: a) the gotra of vi?v?mitra (a Tatpuru?a compound), and b) one whose gotra is vi?v?mitra (a Bahuvr?hi compound).  On the other hand, the term vi?v?mitra-sagotra is more clear in having only one meaning: "one who has the same gotra as vi?v?mitra."  This may be the reason why the passages quoted by Professor Korada prescribe the use of -sagotra expression.  In my family rituals, the declaration included something like aham bh?radv?ja-gotrotpanna? ... "I, born in the bh?radv?ja-gotra."  In this usage, the term bh?radv?ja-gotra is used just to refer to the gotra of bh?radv?ja, and not in the sense of "one with the bh?radv?ja-gotra."   I don't remember the usage of bh?radv?ja-sagotra in my family.  In any case, thanks for all the suggestions, and I have communicated these to my friend, who posed the original question to me.

Thank you Professor Korada for the references that indicate that -sagotra should be added to all Gotra references.  The variation in actual usage may simply be due to people not following this rule.

bhaardhvaaj sagotra etc.
 Charudeva Shastry uses it every where. This rule is said in Grhya sutra etc, I don't remember right now. I will send reference later. But every gotra is added sa and not only few.

Dear colleagues,

     I am forwarding a question from a friend of mine, for which I do not have a clear answer:

Quote:

Dear Madhav,

I thought you might have a quick answer to this question. When mentioning gotras, one sees "Visv?mitra gotra", but also "?treyasa gotra", and "K?syapasa gotra".

Since the ??is in the two latter cases are Atri and Kasyapa, it would appear that the corresponding gotras should be "?treya" and "K?syapa", without the "sa" suffix. (Indeed, one also sees "?treya gotra", and "K?syapa gotra".)

Is it the case that the correct terms are "?treya sagotra", and "K?syapa sagotra", and the conventional usage is simply an incorrect parsing? However, this would require "Visv?mitra sagotra", which one does not see.

Or is there something more to it than that?

Unquote

Why would someone be referred to as Vi?v?mitra-gotra, but others as ?treya-sagotra or K??yapa-sagotra?  I will appreciate a clarification.
