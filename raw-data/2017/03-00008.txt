On the more general question of the transmission of Sanskrit knowledge to
Baghdad in the eighth century, I consider van Bladel's 2011 study to be a
breakthrough in understanding several key issues about this historical
moment.

van Bladel, Kevin Thomas. 2011. ?The Bactrian Background of the Barmakids?,
in *Islam and Tibet: Interactions along the Musk Routes*, Islam and Tibet:
Interactions along the Musk Routes, ed. by Anna Akasoy, Charles Burnett,
and Ronit Yoeli-Tlalim (Farnham: Ashgate), pp. 43?88


In particular, van Bladel establishes that the patriarch of the "Pramukha"
family of the Navavih?ra in Balkh (who became the "Barmacids" in Baghdad)
was a Bactrian-speaker who was educated in ??stric Sanskrit in Kashmir.
