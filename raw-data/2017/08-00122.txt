But Arlo, every journal you mention is pay-to-read.  One of the premises of
the OA model is that taxpayer-funded research should not be paid for
twice.  As the OLH site says (italics mine),

Since 1986, subscription costs for academic journals have risen by 300%
above inflation. In addition to exponentially increased research output
over this period this has triggered what is known as ?the serials crisis?;
the inability of library budgets to keep pace with the prices set by
publishers.

Simultaneously, it has been realised that* putting research behind paywalls
*is both unjust (especially if the research was funded by the taxpayer) and
also unhelpful; scholarly and scientific practices are not advanced by
restricting access. This led to the rise of the open access movement. Open
access is traditionally schematized into two routes: green and gold. The
former means that access is made open through the author depositing a copy
of their article in their institution?s repository. The second means that
the journal itself is open and free to read.


Several "even-older-model" journals like the BSOAS, the JRAS, and *Medical
History* could once have been included in your list, with ABORI and the
others.  But most regrettably, they sold their journals to Cambridge
University Press.  (The example of Medical History is complicated, because
it is both free and paywalled simultaneously.)

Best,
Dominik
