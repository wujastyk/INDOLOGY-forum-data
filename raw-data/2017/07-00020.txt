Subject: [INDOLOGY] SRK - Dharmakirti
Message-ID: <CAGsvHi92=jDRZWr=hQ6Qo7mm=dPspu0B-WMQvv5030+hrfFvTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Matthew,

 although not being explicitly concentrated on SRK,
Straube in his article ?Dharmak?rti als Dichter? takes up an important
Buddhist contributor
to the SRK and while considering him in a broader context, he indirectly
and directly
(cf. p. 475f., where he employs SkV as a siglum for the anthology) relates
to that work.

Unfortunately, given your inquiry might (also) be related to some of your
students? interest,
Straube?s article is written in German, hence probably of limited access to
your students in Chicago,
while the French and German students often seem to have better access to
each other?s language.

Anyway, his article being attached, you?ll quickly see, how useful it might
turn out for your purposes.

Best wishes,

Hartmut
.
