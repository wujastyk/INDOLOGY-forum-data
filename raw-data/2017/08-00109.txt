True enough.  But JAOS authors do hold copyright, which facilitates legal dissemination beyond the paywall.  Besides which, AOS membership is within reach of almost anyone motivated to join, because of its progressive dues structure: https://www.americanorientalsociety.org/membership/dues-payment/
Any category of membership includes full digital access to the journal (and an extra $20 will add the print version to the discounted categories).  Some new magazines cost more than a year of JAOS.  In any case, the AOS (and other venues that Arlo mentioned) are not profit-driven, and are not part of the scholarly-publication problem.  They are just covering their costs.

I say this not to discourage the development fully open-access publications, which I in fact encourage ? I myself am a section editor for religious studies at OLH.  But the fact is, submissions are few and my efforts to drum up participation have not borne fruit.  Several more established journals have come under OLH?s wing, but their home-grown ?megajournal" format remains underused.  Only six ?special collections? (thematic issues) have appeared since it was introduced.

Best,
Tim

Since it takes a couple of years for an article to go from submission to publication in JAOS, the three-year paywall means that JSTOR readers are reading five-year-old research.  Older, if you factor-in the writing and research period before submission.

Plus, JSTOR membership itself isn't free.   Many of us don't notice this, but a pandit in Thanjavur, for example, can't read the JAOS on JSTOR.

Colleagues,

I very nearly wrote in with a similar suggestion about journals produced by scholarly institutions and societies.  I will only add that the JAOS has the added virtue that it assigns copyright to authors.  Many of these journals are openly available on the internet (via JSTOR or Pers?e, etc.) with only the last 3 or 5 years protected to encourage subscription.  For JAOS, the ?look back? is only 3 years.

Best,

Tim Lubin

Dear Dominik,


There is of course an another 'old model' (perhaps older than the one involving for-profit enterprises against which you protest): that of an academic institution or learned society running its own scholarly journal and publishing it wholly independently or with only marginal involvement of any for-profit enterprise.


Some of our best and most venerable journals belong to this category. To name but five, from five different countries:


Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute

Bulletin de l'?cole fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient

Journal of the American Oriental Society

Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?dasiens

Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft


I personally prefer to support and publish in these kinds of journals, and have wondered why colleagues feel the need to create new journals if excellent old ones already exist, outside of the for-profit publishing framework.


Best wishes,


Arlo Griffiths

Dear colleagues,

New academic journals spring up with surprising frequency.  Indeed, I launched one<http://hssa-journal.org> myself.  I am surprised, however, to see how many of the journals relevant to Indology still function on what I think of as the "old model," and are run as for-profit enterprises by commercial companies like Springer, Elsevier, Brill and others, whose first duty is not to the growth of knowledge, but to their shareholders.

This problem of forked loyalty was starkly demonstrated this last week, when Cambridge University Press bowed to pressure from the Chinese Government, and voluntarily censored the content of its journal China Quarterly, withdrawing 300 articles that touched on topics sensitive to the PRC's communist government including the Tienanmen Square massacre and Tibet.  The reason given by the press was (in my words) that it was willing to sacrifice intellectual integrity for the purpose of continuing to sell the broad range of its products in the Chinese market.  The press has since changed its mind<http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/cambridge-university-press-posts-censored-articles-170822075543589.html> as a result of widespread incredulity and outrage from the academic establishment.  It might be uncharitable to view it this way, but one can't help thinking that CUP continues make decisions based on the bottom line, and has simply decided that it stands to lose more by alienating its domestic academic market than the Chinese one.
