Dear Alakendu (if I may),

Thanks for your contribution to the discussion. May I point you to my reply to Andrea Acri's questions? The Mayans or even the Babylonians before the Mayans already used a symbol as placeholder in a positional system, but as far as I know, they did not use it as a zero in its own rights, if I'm not mistaken. On the other hand, this is precisely what the Bakhshali manuscript content hints at.

Best wishes,

Camillo

Dr.Freschi,
Thanks for your response. I would mention a link here ,which may be useful to you.

www.historymuseum.ca/cma/exhibitions/civil/maya/mmc05eng.shtml.( Ref-Canadian Museum of History)

I would also mention a line from the link,which goes as follows- 'That the Maya understood the value of
zero is remarkable -most of world's civilisations had no concept of zero at that time'

The moot point is that the Mayans may not be using zero as a place-value ,as efficiently as the
Bakshali mms did, but ,if the issue is that of ORIGIN OF ZERO ,then, would be out of place to grant the
Mayans this honour?
