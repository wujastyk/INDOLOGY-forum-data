Thank you for the clarifications, Walter.

The opinion of the author of the MU seems to differ only by degree from 
the general consensus of Indian astrologers, then: he claims that /all 
/effects of past action may be counteracted by present action; they say 
that /some /effects (/ad??ha-karman/) may be so counteracted, while 
others (/d??ha-karman/) are too powerful and therefore must take effect. 
Both operate within a framework of karma theory.

In the case of a person who is not willing to make any great effort to 
change his 'fate', then, I suppose our author would agree that the 
person's actions from previous lives will largely determine his present 
one. The question that I am really after is this: would he then accept 
the celestial mechanics studied and interpreted by astrologers as 
accurately reflecting such /karma-phala/? But perhaps that is not a 
topic that comes up in the MU.

Best wishes,
Martin
