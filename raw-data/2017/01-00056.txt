Subject: [INDOLOGY] query: source of verses

Dear list members,

r?iputraparame?vara? I (a 14th century CE Kerala scholar)  cites these verses and verse portions while commenting on v?caaspati?s treatment of a Buddhist critique satk?ryav?da? in ny?yaka?ik?. He cites them in explanation of terms in s??khak?rik? 7:

atid?r?ts?m?py?dindriyagh?t?nmanonavasth?n?t |
sauk?my?dvyavadh?n?dabhidh?n?dabhibhav?tsam?n?bhih?r?cca ||

Each verse or verse portion appears separately in svadita?kara??.  He may have cited them from different works, or he may have cited them from the same work, but not in the order that they appear in the original.

Can any list members  identify any of these?

Years ago, I spent many hours skimming through books and their indices looking for sources for these and other verses. I found nothing quite like these. More recent Google and online document searches for these have also yielded nothing.

Thank you in advance.
