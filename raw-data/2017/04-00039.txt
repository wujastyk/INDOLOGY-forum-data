Subject: [INDOLOGY] DIPAVAMSA-AUTHOUR
Message-ID: <20170407120613.9798.qmail@f4mail-235-141.rediffmail.com>



  Of late, I am going through a book on the Chronicles of Ceylone.The two most well-known 

chronicles of Ceylone are-Dipa Vamsa and Maha Vamsa. The authour of Mahavamsa has been confirmed 

as Thera Mahanama .Can anybody kindly  suggest  a name who authoured Dipa Vamsa.? There is 

another area of interest in Dipavamsa ,which drew my attention. It states-' DipaAgamanam 

Buddhassha ...... " Thus, can  it be inferred that Siddhartha Gautama Buddha  had set his foot on 

Lankan soil.? Any other evidences to corroborrate ? 





                                                      ALAKENDU DAS.
