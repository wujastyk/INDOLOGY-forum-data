Dear colleagues,

I have been trying to source a hymn entitled the "?ditya Kavacam." So far,
I have only found a version on the Internet which gets copied around in
different websites. For instance: http://www.vignanam.
org/veda/aditya-kavacham-devanagari.html The Sanskrit has definitely a few
typos and overall I am rather skeptical of online material that does not
cite its sources.

The "armor" in this version says that its source is the Gaur? Kha??a of the
Sk?ndapur??a (iti sk?ndapur??e gaur?kha??e ?ditya kavaca? samp?r?am)
however, I have not found it in the editions available to me. I know that
many texts claim its source in the Sk?ndapur??a which, however, ends up
being not more than just a claim. I wonder if the "?ditya Kavacam" is such
a case.

In any case, I would appreciate if anyone has a scan or a more reliable
source for this text since all I have been able to find so far has only
yielded one source in Kannada language that I, unfortunately, cannot read.

Best,
Borayin
