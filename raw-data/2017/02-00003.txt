Subject: =?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_svaya=E1=B9=83vara?=
Message-ID: <5622B5FA1B14F3439A3ABC85C5A09EA823FD0A7D@EX-1-MB1.lancs.local>

Could anyone point me in the direction of any literature on the topic of the svaya?vara in classical texts? I am looking for a discussion of its role in narrative and/or discussions of gender and marriage.
Thank you.
