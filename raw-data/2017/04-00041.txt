Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with Ramayana
Message-ID: <7EAE4346-A566-4214-BA9B-9046B6C19FF2@ivs.edu>

I am corresponding with a Hindu scholar who sent me the following as ?evidence' of primordial ?writing? in India:

r?ma-n?m??kita? ceda? pa?ya devy a?gul?yakam

Translation: O Sita devi! Please see this ring on which the name of Lord Rama is written.

Source: Sundara-k???a, Chapter 34, Verse 2. (Critical edition of Ramayana published at Baroda)


Of course a?kita literally means ?marked,? not ?written.?  How would Ramayana scholars understand this word here? Also, what is the status of the Baroda edition?

Many thanks!

Howard
