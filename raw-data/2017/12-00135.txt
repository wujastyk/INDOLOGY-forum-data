Dear Indologists,

I recently came in possession of vol. 4 of Dipak Bhattacharya?s edition of
the Paippal?da-sa?hit? of the Atharvaveda (Kolkata : The Asiatic Society,
2016), as far as I know not yet announced on this list.

It contains not only the first critical edition of the remaining k???as, 19
and 20, of the Paippal?da-sa?hit? (other k???as in vols. 1-3, Kolkata,
Asiatic Society, 1997, 2008, 2011) but also a detailed, erudite
introduction on the importance and implications of the Paippal?da-sa?hit?
for the cultural history ? I would say, an alternative, pre-Manu or
non-Manu cultural history ? of Vedism and of early Brahmanism and Hinduism.

The observations of Prof. Bhattacharya, whom I felicitate with this
important achievement, confirm, I believe, my statement on the emerging
canonical ??kh?s of the Veda:

?The early development of the last of the major Vedic divisions to become
independent, the Atharvavedic branches ? which, unlike their Yajurvedic and
S?mavedic predecessors, do not get a chance to develop completely before
they are almost entirely swept away by new ecological and religious
developments ? lays in between these two, and shows not only evidence of a
largely agricultural environment, but also of a general resource crunch:
Brahmins who have given up an earlier semi-nomadic life-style in favour of
a more settled one are experiencing increased difficulties to find stable
niches for survival.?
