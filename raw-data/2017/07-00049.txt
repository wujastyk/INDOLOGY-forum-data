The discussion of ?menstrual blood? and ?fecund blood? in Rahul Peter Das's very detailed study The Origin of the Life of a Human Being: Conception and the Female According to Ancient Indian Medical and Sexological Literature would be a good place to look for references.

All the best,

As part of Indian ancient Ayurvedic culture, according to surrogacy researcher Sheela Saravanan (pers.com <http://pers.com/>. June 2017): ?Parturition and breastfeeding is considered a transfer of blood from the mother to the child and children are considered to be indebted to this and need to look after and have respect for their mothers all their life owing to this.?

But both Nandini didi [the genetic mother] and I wanted to keep all three babies. I told Doctor Madam that I'll keep one and didi can keep two. After all it's my blood even if it's their genes. And who knows whether at my age I'll be able to have more babies (emphasis added by Pande).

> Pande comments (2015, p. 8) that ?Parvati, thus, uses her interpretation of the blood tie to make claims on the baby/fetus. Raveena makes a similar claim. But in addition to the substantial ties of blood, Raveena also emphasizes the labor of gestation and giving birth.? Here is Pande?s quote from Raveena (2015, p. 8):
> 
> Anne [the genetic mother] wanted a girl but I told her even before the ultrasound, coming from me it will be a boy. My first two children were also boys. This one will be too. And see I was right, it is a boy! After all they just gave the eggs, but the blood and all the sweat, all the effort is mine. Of course it's going after me (emphasis added by Pande).

> Amrita Pande adds (2015, p. 8): ?This sweat (paseena) and the blood (khoon) tie between surrogate and fetus is often advocated by womb mothers as stronger than a connection based solely on genes."
