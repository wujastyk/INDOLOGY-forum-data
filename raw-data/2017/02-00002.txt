Dear indologists,

I am looking for Puranic references that link together Shiva, the blue
colour and the mountain.

E.g.: in *Kalikapurana *is narrated that Nilacala turned its colour into
blue because of the touch of the *yoni*, although the mountain was already
identified with Shiva (and its linga) -- thus it may be (probably)
assumed/hypothesised that the association between blue and Shiva was
provoked by the *shakti *of the Goddess.

Any further reference will be greatly appreciated.

Best,
Paolo
