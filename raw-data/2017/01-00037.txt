My impression is that the categorisation of absence that becomes 
standard in the Navya?Ny?ya tradition (i.e. the twofold division of 
absence into mutual absence and relational absence, with relational 
absence divided into pr?g?, pradhva?sa? and atyanta? abh?va) is first 
found in V?caspati Mi?ra's I Ny?yav?rttikat?tparya??k? under s?tra 
2.2.12. Not all earlier Ny?ya?Vai?e?ika philosophers accept this scheme 
of absence. An early Vai?e?ika thinker to accept the same scheme of 
absence is ?iv?ditya in the early passages of the Saptapad?rth?. Matilal 
(in the Navya?Ny?ya Doctrine of Negation, chapter 12) has a good 
discussion of the historical development of the concept in pre?Ga?ge?a 
Ny?ya?Vai?e?ika philosophy. The standard manuals of Navya?Ny?ya (e.g. 
Siddh?ntamukt?val? or Tarkasa?graha and their commentaries) have 
detailed summaries of the concepts. Another good source is Stephen 
Phillip's translation of Ga?ge?a's Tattvacint?ma?i.
