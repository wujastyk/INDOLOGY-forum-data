>> 
>>  This book is the first detailed description of the phonetics of Buddhist Sanskrit as shown in the textual tradition of the Buddhist sect known as Mah?s??ghika-Lokottorav?dins. The texts use the language which undoubtedly bears the marks of Middle Indian influence,  mostly of P?li. However,  as widely recognized,  this language is not identical with P?li or any other Middle Indian dialect. F. Edgerton?s pioneer grammar of this language (New Haven: Yale University Press,  1953),  which he called ?Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit? allows only a limited space to its phonetics. The present book contains an analysis of the phonetic evidence of all available texts of the Mah?s??ghika-Lokottorav?dins. Several of them have been published after Edgerton?s demise,  and their data had necessarily to be incorporated in our analysis.
>> 
>>           Special emphasis is made on the fact that this language does not owe its shape to either Middle Indian dialect,  but is a language on its own,  with its own peculiar structural constraints and features.
>> 
>>           Particularly,  to account for its mixed nature,  all occurrences of sound and their sequences are thoroughly examined with special attention to the alternations taking place within the texts and their layers,  probably pointing to the language habits of the speakers of different Middle Indian dialects,  which contributed to the production of the textual tradition that stood in the midway between H?nay?na?s and Mah?y?na?s texts.
>> 
>>        The intricate problem of sandhi patterns is also given much attention as it is generally believed that these patterns were subject to no constraints whatsoever.
>> 
>>            This volume on the phonetics should be followed by further volumes dedicated to morphological and syntactic patterns of this language
