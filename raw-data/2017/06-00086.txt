Jim Nye of the University of Chicago Library told me that when Anandasrama did a second edition of the same work it would start from scratch, so that another ASS edition of the same title will be a different text.

Dear list members,
 
?

I am looking for the ?nand??rama edition of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha ascribed to M?dhava. It came out in 1906, but reprints seem to have been made later. I need the full text. Could anyone help? Thanks in advance.
