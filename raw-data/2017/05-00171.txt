I find mentions of the Chunar quarry also in Lars Fogelin's "An
Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism", pp. 86-89, 91. He does not go
into details of the transport, but calls it - and rightly! - "a massive
undertaking":

>> The quarrying, transport, and fnishing of the pillars signify a massive
undertaking by the Mauryan state. (87)
