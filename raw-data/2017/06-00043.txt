Message-ID: <67B425A6-B35F-4FFF-9720-363250FA6071@gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

This is a friendly reminder that proposals for organizing a Special Panel at the 17th World Sanskrit Conference (July 9-13, 2018) are due on July 1, 2017. 

We highly encourage scholars to organize a special panel on a thematic or interdisciplinary topic, consisting of three or four presenters, or potentially a roundtable or alternate format.

Approved special panels will be advertised in conference circulars and the WSC2018 website and will receive an earlier confirmation of participation. If your panel is not approved, individual papers may still be submitted for consideration before the regular deadline of October 1, 2017.

To submit a panel abstract for consideration, please visit the conference website,  wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca, and click on "Submit Proposal" link in the top menu. This will take you to the submission portal, where you may initiate the submission process and then follow the instructions for submitting a special panel proposal.

Proposals will be assessed by the Academic Advisory Committee of WSC2018, and results will be announced by August 15, 2017.

All inquiries may be directed to the WSC 2018 Secretariat at wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca, and be sure to consult the official conference website, wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca, for the most up-to-date information.
