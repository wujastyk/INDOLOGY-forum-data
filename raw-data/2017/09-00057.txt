Subject: [INDOLOGY] Before the Buddhahood, before Uruvela
Message-ID: <CALNcvFvRW36U81gDMoe7XVr---F1u1DjQy-2=pg1uTeWwY3LxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Is there somewhere in the Tipitaka a description of the days *preceding*
the seven days meditation at Uruvela, on the bank of the river Neranjara?

I seem to have lost some elements from the Buddha's Tipitakan biography.

Thanks,
