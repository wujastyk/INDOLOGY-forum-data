Dear members of the Indology mailing list,

We are pleased to announce that the ninth International Indological
Graduate Research Symposium (IIGRS 9) will take place at Ghent University
on 22nd and 23th of September 2017. We invite all M.A. and PhD students, as
well as early stage researchers who have completed their PhD within the
past five years, to submit their abstracts to iigrsuk at googlemail.com by
June 12. The selection committee will consider all papers dealing with an
Indological subject based on the study of texts in their original language.
Please have a look at the IIGRS website for more information:
