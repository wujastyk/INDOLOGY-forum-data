Dear Patrick,

I believe the boon you are referring to is from the Yajur Veda (Taitt?rya
Samhit?) Kanda 2 Prapathaka 5 Verse 1.

The story is told of how Indra got rid of his guilt from slaying a brahmin
by making a deal with women in which they demanded a boon, "let us enjoy
intercourse at will up to birth."

Best wishes,

Brian Campbell
