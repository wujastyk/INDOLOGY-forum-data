Dear All:

This is a question about preparing an index to each half-verse of a text using the first p?da (prat?ka). I have done many of these over the years, and I always used the proper word-ending at the end of each p?da, even though, because of Sandhi, the original may not have had that ending.

So:
?? ?????????????????
would appear as: ?? ????????????????:
And:
??????? ?? ???????????
as:
??????? ?? ?????????:
Now I am questioning this practice, because the reason for an index is to identify a verse that one already knows. So why not give it in the Index just as it appears in the verse ? Sandhi and all??

What do you all think?

Patrick
