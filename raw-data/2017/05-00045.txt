Dear List,

Does anyone, by chance, possess access to a pdf of this Compendium?

I have searched for it in all net archives and google-type sources, but -
so far - no luck.

Three editions are mentioned in Goudriaan-Gupta?s *Hindu Tantra and Sakta
Literature*, p. 117:

<<Manuscripts abound all over India (cf. NCO, VIII, p. 314); there are
several editions, e.g. those by J. VIDYASAGAR in: Indraj?lavidy?sa?graha,
Calcutta 1915 (bad ed.); by B.M. PANDEY, Varanasi 1963; by SY?MASUNDARAL?LA
TRIP??H?, Bombay 1909, re-ed. 1965, in 24 chs. See further IOL-SB, I, p.
712.>>

Your help would be greatly appreciated.
