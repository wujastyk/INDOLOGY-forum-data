Dear listerv, 

This is a long shot, but would anybody happen to have a PDF or access to a physical copy of the following book?

	V?dir?jas?ri. 1916 (=Vikrama 1973 = Sa? 2442). ?r?p?r?van?thacaritam. Edited by Manoharal?la ??stri. M??ikacandra Diga?bara Jaina Grantham?l? 4.

I have a mostly-readable microfilm, but it is out of focus at places and I?m *dying* to know what is going on. I?ve checked all the usual suspects (Jain eLibrary, DLI, etc.), but have so far come up empty-handed.

All the best,
Eric
