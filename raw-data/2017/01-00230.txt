Dear colleagues,

(apologies for cross-posting). You might be interested to learn that
volume 20 in the series "Sanskrit texts from the Tibetan Autonomous
Region" is now available:

Xuezhu Li, Yoshimichi Fujita: Pa?ca?atik? Praj??p?ramit?. Sanskrit and
Tibetan Texts. Vienna/Beijing 2016: Austrian Academy of Sciences
Press/China Tibetology Publishing House.

The Pa?ca?atik? Praj??p?ramit? or ?Perfection of Wisdom in 500 Lines? is
a Mah?y?na Buddhist scripture that has received almost no attention to
date, neither within Buddhist  tradition nor in modern scholarship. The
text is nonetheless of unique value, as an influence of the
Consciousness-only or Yog?c?ra school can clearly be seen. The critical
edition of the Sanskrit text presented in this volume is chiefly based
on a photocopy kept in the library of the China Tibetology Research
Center, Beijing, of a codex unicus found in the Norbulingka Palace in
Lhasa. The volume also contains a critical edition of the Classical
Tibetan translation, the Song dynasty Chinese translation, and a
diplomatic transcription of the Sanskrit manuscript. The introduction is
offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese.

Orders can be placed at the website of the Austrian Academy of Sciences
