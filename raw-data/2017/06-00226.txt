Dear Jesse, Mrinal and all,
I have often wondered it (and in fact been quite annoyed): Everybody uses Kales works, but nobody knows anything on him. I have not even found the dates of the birth and death of More?var R?mcandra K?le. In his books he is styled B.A., in 1911/24 he was living in Girgaon and had a son, V. M. Kale, who published new editions of his father?s works. This is all! I really hope someone can give more information.

Karmarkar is easier. There are two obituary notices, by A. D. Pusalker, ABORI 46, 1965, 191f. and V. M. Bedekar, VIJ 4, 1966, 89-91 giving the basic information about the career of this Poona scholar.

Best,
Klaus

> Dear Friends, I don't remeber if I've asked this before on list or not, but I've always wanted to know some more biographical info on MR Kale, through whose editions I first started reading Skt lit. I believe he taught at the University of Bombay, but apart from that I've never come across anything (and I know I've asked about somewhere). Thanks for any leads. Best,J
