Dear Colleagues,


?
The link in the Call for Papers that Icirculated yesterday makes reference to a fee for processing ofsubmissions.? There will be no fee in thecase of this special issue.? In mytwenty-year career, I have yet to pay to publish anything.? I don?t plan to start now, nor do I expect itfrom any of you!


?
All the best,

Jeff
