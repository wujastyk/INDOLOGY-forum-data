The Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t in Munich, Germany invites applications for
two PhD scholarships for dissertation projects related to Buddhism.

Deadline for applications: 22 October 2017
Start of scholarship: summer or autumn 2018
Duration of scholarship: 3 years
Scholarship amount: 1000 ? per month + insurance + support for rent +
travel lump sums + 460 ? per year
Scholarship donor: German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)

The selection process comprises two stages: Applications are sent to the
Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies in Munich. The program will select
promising candidates, who then have to submit their materials to the DAAD.
It is expected that the successful candidates will be chosen and informed
by February 2018.

The prerequisites for application are non-German citizenship, a Master of
Arts or Magister Artium degree or equivalent in a relevant field, excellent
knowledge of at least one Buddhist source language, outstanding
qualifications in the subject, and fluency in English. A basic knowledge of
German is also desirable, though not a prerequisite, but willingness to
learn German/improve German language skills will be expected. Applicants
should not have lived in Germany for more than fifteen months at the time
of the submission of their materials to the DAAD (in December) and the last
final examination should have taken place no more than six years before
this date.
