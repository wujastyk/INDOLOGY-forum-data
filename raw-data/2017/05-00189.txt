Dear Professor Aklujkar,

Thank you very much for the insight you've provided regarding Mandana and
Vacaspati Mishra's place of origin. While I'll be looking forward to having
more information about Mandana Mishra's place of origin, I'll be going
through your article. And I'm sure it'll benefit me a lot.


With best regards,
Abhinav Anand
