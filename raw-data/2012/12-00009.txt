Dear list,
We are working on a partial translation of the Madhuravijaya of Gangadevi
for which we are referring to three editions all based on a single, damaged
manuscript - the one found in Trivandrum in 1916 (which was indeed the
re-discovery of this 14th century poem).  As far as I can see no other
manuscript has since been found.  Is anyone aware of further manuscripts of
this text?
Thank you very much
Venetia
