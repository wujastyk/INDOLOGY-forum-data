Dear indologists,

Can anyone advise a friend who is looking for a good English-
medium Sanskrit course at an Indian university. He studied a two-
year course at SOAS (London) a few years ago, and has since 
completed a very good PhD, but not using Sanskrit, so he considers 
himself a beginner. He has a good knowledge of several European 
languages. He'd prefer somewhere in Bengal, but is open to other 
suggestions. He tells me he has a good chance of getting funding 
for up to three years.

I'm not sufficiently in touch to give advice unaided. Any suggestions?

Dermot Killingley
