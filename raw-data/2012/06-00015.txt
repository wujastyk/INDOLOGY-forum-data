This is not directly about the medical aspect, but there is a book examining the liceity of branding with religious emblems:

I think but am not sure this is about using Vaishnava emblems (Zankha, GaDA, etc.).? You see the little brass wire implements for these insignia in antique stores.? I think they are sometimes used for branding, sometimes for marking the body with sandalwood.? D. D. Kosambi gave Horace Poleman a set to the Library of Congress.
?
It is also possible that in the course of a dharmashastric examination of the issue the medical aspects might be mentioned.? I have never read it so do not know.
?
If the above record does not transmit passibly well I will try again.

Dear colleagues,

A third party has asked me for information on the practice of?branding as part of traditional medical practice in South Asia or in the Fijian Hindu community, especially in respect to children. Can anyone point me in the direction of useful material?

Many thanks
Adam
