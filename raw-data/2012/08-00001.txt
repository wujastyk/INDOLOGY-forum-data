Dear all,

On my desk I have a Sanskrit Mahatmya in Telugu script. The title reads:

?r?mad-?gneyapur???ntargata Tul?k?ver?m?h?tmyam / 
R?m?nujapuram-?nanda?pi??ai-?la?i?gar?c?rye?a pari?k?tam. (Mahatmya on 
the Tulakaveri feast, taken from the Agnipurana)

In the second part it is said that it was printed by the Sarasvati 
Bhandara Press (Tiruvavlikke?i-Sarasvat?bha???ramudr?k?ara??l?y?m 
mudritam), in the year 1874/1875 (Bh?vasa?vatsare ...). What is puzzling 
me is the name Tiruvavlikke?i. Is this a place name? According to the 
India Office Library Catalogue, this work was printed in Madras. So, may 
I conclude that Tiruvavlikke?i is Madras/Cennai or a part of it? Please 
help me to throw some light on it.

I have put a scan of the title page under URL: <http://goo.gl/UZEYy>.

All the best
Peter Wyzlic
