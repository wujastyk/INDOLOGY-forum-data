Subject: Brahmanical Pancarohani festival?
Message-ID: <161227097973.23782.4685788705947674626.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There are three sutras in the Anguttara Nikaya that mention a Paccorohanii festival celebrated by brahmins. The Chinese version of AN 10.167 gives a few more details than the Pali, but not much. Does anyone out there know of any discussion of this festival? Better yet, has anyone ever found a brahmanical source discussing this festival? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
