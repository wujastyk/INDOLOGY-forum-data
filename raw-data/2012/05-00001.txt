In a 1953-54 article in EI, D. C. Sircar noticed a plate that mentions
Amba??has of Tamil Nadu, and DCS suggested that they were Vaidyas
 who moved from S. India to Bengal and helped to crystallize the Bengal
Vaidya tradition.  There is a long history to the Amba??has, going back to
the P?li Canon at least.  I'm not aware of a specific study of this group
(and would be grateful for any reference), but they are routinely
considered to be barber-surgeons, pretty much in the same mould as the
European barber-surgeons.
