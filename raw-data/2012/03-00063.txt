Cher Emmanuel,

inside the Pondicherry EFEO collection of MSS,
the MS numbered EO-0541,
which is an incomplete copy of the ???????????? [ka?akkatik?ram]
was copied from a book
published in "pirapava ((varu?am)) pa?ku?i ((m?cam))"
by cuppirama?iya aiyar
in his "vittiy?vil?camuttir?k?arac?lai"
which seems to correspond to march-april 1868.

I have been able to directly compare the MS and a PDF of the printed book.

I originally thought the book to have been published in 1927-1928,
but after seeing the MS copy this seems unlikely :-)
