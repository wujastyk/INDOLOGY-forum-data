Although the document was uploaded on September 14, 2012, it is very likely
that the content was prepared much earlier. I believe the website version
is meant to be a later correction.

This entire paragraph appears to be a straight lift from one of these
sites. It is also possible that the Wikipedia entry for Kutiyattam had this
exact paragraph sometime in the past.

It is interesting that even the Sanskrit word *ku?rd *is possibly a
borrowing from Dravidian (Burrow *Dravidian Studies VII* 1948:375, CDIAL
3411,3412<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2535.soas>,
See DEDR 1705<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:1713.burrow>
).
