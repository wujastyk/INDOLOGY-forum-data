I would be glad to make contact with anyone who will be visiting the Jammu
MSS library in the future, to study or copy Skt MSS there.  There is a MS
in the collection that I would dearly like to have sight of, either a full
copy, or even just 10 beginning and 10 ending folios.  Or *anything*.  Even
a report if you were able to look at it for a few minutes.  The MS I have
in mind is on paper, and in Devanagari script.

Best,
Dominik
