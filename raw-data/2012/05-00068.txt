Well the very first link attributes it to K?lid?sa, though this may well be an apocryphal attribution. The (English) quote appears to come from Sir William Osler (deemed "father of modern medicine") who supposedly liked to use it in his speeches. The attributed title is "Salutation to the Dawn". One can find a number of email lists on 'the google' (to quote George Bush) who have attempted to vet this with not much success, although I did not search too deeply.
Now, there is 20 minutes I will never get back. . . .
Back to editing articles.
