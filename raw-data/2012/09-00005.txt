Baghbandi is known to me. There may be local varieties.

Dear Dipak Bhattacharya, dear Jean?Michel Delire,

from the looks of the Nasik board, that would be the game known in
Hindi and Nepali as B?gh C?l. Turner?s CDIAL has an entry for it:

? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagh-Chal

What is the Bengali term for the game?

> It is one of the dying indigenous pastimes.

Maybe there is hope. The Wikipedia page for B?gh C?l

? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagh-Chal

lists quite a number of computer versions of the game ? including
one for the iPhone. Do we have a good date for the Nasik board (or
any other information on how far back this game goes)?

All best,
Stefan Baums
