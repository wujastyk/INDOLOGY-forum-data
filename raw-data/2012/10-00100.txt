Dear Palaniappan,

I think you idea is a fascinating one, but I'd like to see clearer evidence linking the name P??a? to the B??a dynasty.  Here are two more poems:

Akan????u 113:

He has gone even beyond the good land of P??a?
who never shows his back in battle,
whose food is as plentiful as the food at a festival,
whose long spear has a black, dense ferrule and an oiled shaft,
and who, even though it was far away, looked for the right time,	15
went, took and drove the cattle and the hump-backed bulls
from the well-stocked fort where his enemies guarded them.


...?????????????? ??????
???????? ??????? ???????? ??????????
????????? ????? ??????? ???????
???????? ???????? ??????? ????????	15
??????????? ???? ????????? ??????
?????? ????? ????????? ??????...

This would seem to indicate that P??a? was a small king in a forest area, probably in the north of TN.  It seems unlikely that someone in the B?na dynasty would be referred to in these terms.  The P?lai poems often describe the hero's journey to the north (to or beyond the Ve?ka?am hills, to where even the language has changed), and these areas (modern Rayalaseema) are said to have been inhabited by fierce, marginal chiefs who would have no compunction killing the poor hero who wants to travel there.

Here is another one (Akam 226):

The gossip you created has grown, and today
it is louder than the clamor when Ka??i whose army kills in battle
joined with strong and brave P??a? to attack Titta? Ve?iya?
whose garland is full, and they heard the sweet sound	15
of the clear ki?ai drum as he held court in U?aiy?r
and, instead of fighting, they fled in terror.

????????? ???????? ??????? ????????? 
??????? ??????? ?????? ??????? 
??????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????,	15
????? ?????? ????? 
??????? ???? ??????????? ??????.

The ki?ai drum would be beaten at executions as well at other occasions (Pu?am 78).  While this could be describing a great king in the B??a dynasty, it seems to me it is of a piece with Akam 113 above and that P??a? is a minor king.  I'd love to see a bit of more conclusive evidence, as P??a? would here seem to be a native Tamil minor king.

The Ku?untokai poem is something of a puzzle.  P??ar here cannot refer to the king, as it is plural while kings are referred to the singular (as vicciyar perumaka?).  I cannot think of any place where the name of a king in the plural is used to refer to his subjects -- C?rar would refer to the Chera monarchs, not the people.  To add to your note, UVS says puli n?kku is a lion's gaze (si?h?valokanam -- puli can sometimes mean lion as well as tiger) and that the lion gazes in two directions at once, like the bards, who are non-fighters standing between the armies and looking at them both. The si?h?valokany?ya, according to Apte, is "The maxim of the lion's backward glance.  It is used when one casts a retrospective glance at what he has left behind while at the same time he is proceeding, just as the lion, while going onward in search of prey, now and then bends his neck backwards to see if anything is within his reach."  If this is the case, then the point of comparison is not the fierceness of the P??ars but the way they look forward to one army and back at the other.  The Kalittokai verse could also refer to how the warriors look before them and behind, though I can't find any commentary that says that.

I would add that I think the date of the older Sangam anthologies is quite firmly established as the first two  centuries AD.  The evidence, in my view, is overwhelming.  George Hart

(in singular) before the variation p->b- in the name took place.

They interpreted the bards as standing between the two armies and looking at both armies as a ?lion? does!. The real meaning of ?look of a tiger? can be seen in the following Kalittokai poem

It cannot refer to ?p?nar? bards, if they are supposed to be bystanders.  The context of the poem indicates that the P??ar had fought on one side. Since the Vicciyar were only minor chieftains engaged in a battle against major kings, we can guess that the P??ar fought fiercely on the side of the underdogs, the Vicciyar. This was probably why their bravery was appreciated by the villagers.

Later non-Tamil inscriptions continue to refer to them as B??as while Tamil inscriptions refer to them as V??a- where b- > v-. The name V??a? occurs as the lord of Ci?uku?i, probably a coastal village on the east coast of the P???iyan kingdom. There is an instance in the Maturaikk??ci 203 where the name V??a? seems to refer to B???sura in the context of referring to his fabulous wealth. We should note that the Cilappatik?ram refers more explicitly to B???sura, son of Mah?bali, as V??a? and not as P??a?. The same is true of the Ma?im?kalai also.  Clearly if the Classical Tamil texts had been composed in the 5th century CE or later, they would be referring to the P??ar chieftain as V??a? and not P??a?. So the Classical Tamil texts would have been composed earlier than the time when P??a- has changed to B??a. Interestingly, M?m?la??r, the author of Akam 31, has also authored Akam 325, which mentions Pa?a?, the chieftain. As I had discussed earlier, Akam 31 was composed earlier than the Kalabhra rule in Tami?akam.
