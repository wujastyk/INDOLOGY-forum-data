Dear Colleagues
I could not note if the following has already been brought to
notice. In that case please ignore it.
Vy?kara?a
teachers have to deal with and teach two types of prohibition -- prati?edha = predicative, paryud?sa = exception. The Ny?yako?a cites a definition.
There is an idea of six-semantic shades of negation, not
necessarily prohibition, for which the see the B?lamanoram? on S.K.756 = P.2.2.6 . This is said
to be the view of ?pr?c?nas= ?old?? ??eastern??
Best

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Terms for Negation ?
 
Dear Colleagues,

The general term in tradtional Sanskrit grammars for negation is, of course, prati?edha.? Due to my lack of in-depth familiarity with the traditional grammars, I wonder if somebody might be able to help me.? I am trying to find Sanskrit terms, if any, for the different sub-classes of negation, in particular for the various types of "a-" (for the negative of privation etc). All I can find are examples of about 6 sub-categories, but no terminology. I am trying to retrovert with a modicom of accuracy some terms from Tibetan. Any suggestions most welcome.

Best wishes,

Stephen Hodge
