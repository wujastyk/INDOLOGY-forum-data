>You might wish to take a look at Frits Staal's
>Discovering the Vedas (Penguin).
>
>I'm no specialist in this area, so my assessment is
>not based on particular knowledge of Vedic studies,
>but I find it to be far and away the most readable and - for
>one who is not specialized here - intellectually 
>stimulating treatment of
>the Vedic tradition that I have encountered.
