Dear List,

I have found a fully unrestricted pdf copy of E. Senart's "Les
inscriptions de Piyadasi" (Paris, MDCCCLXXXVI) at archive.org.

Unfortunately - only the second volume. I want to copy the brahmi
texts of the inscriptions, as reconstructed by Senart. But I am unable
to do this  with the Google digitized copies of Senart's work, such as
the one shown at:

Has anyone, please, access to an unrestricted pdf copy of the first volume?

I'd be grateful for a link,
