Subject: FW: Query from a colleague not on this list
In-Reply-To: <CAKdt-CcAPQoi_wa9EqCZLksvEe0uS6NJ0_3u3-nB=vM6YXk05Q@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <161227094889.23782.6257337582642219887.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Two useful and often cited references to Hindu/Buddhist cosmology with  
abundant illustrations are:

Kirfel, Willibald. 1920. Die Kosmographie Der Inder. Bonn: Kurt  
Schroeder.	
Sadakata Akira ???. 1985. ??????: ?????? 
?????. ??: ???.	

Kirfel had a work devoted to the cosmology in Pur??a which should of  
particular relevance to the query:
Kirfel, Willibald. 1954. Das Pur??a Vom Weltgeb?ude  
(Bhuvanaviny?sa) : Die Kosmographischen Traktate Der Pur??a's.  
Bonn: Selbstverlag des Orientalischen Seminars der Universit?t Bonn.
