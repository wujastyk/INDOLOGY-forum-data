Dear Indologists,

Does anyone, by any chance, have access to a better (higher resolution) of this image, that he/she would be willing to allow me to use for publication? 

The stone is at Vijayanagara, near NN z/2

I am in need of this particular hero stone, and I am in Delhi, and not keen to ramble through the weeds at Hampi in April!

I would be MOST grateful for the help. My apologies for cross posting.

Mary
