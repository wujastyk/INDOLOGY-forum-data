Dear Indologists,

 

eJIM, the eJournal of Indian medicine, has just published a new issue. See
http://www.indianmedicine.nl. 

 

eJIM has a new registration policy: from now on all articles and the
Archives can be accessed without registration. Registered users, however,
will be notified by email on publication of an issue of the journal, new
books or news items.

 

We currently have over 1,000 registered users.
