No Italian library seems to hold the issue of the Adyar Bulletin mentioned
below. So I wonder if anybody could be so kind as to supply me with a copy
of this article I am interested in:

K V Sarma, "Propagation of written literature in Indian tradition", Adyar
Library Bulletin 55 (1991), pp 15-31.

Thank you,
