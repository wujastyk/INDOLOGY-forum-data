Dear Colleagues,

Would any with a translation of the Mahabhasya be able to kindly scan the
page giving an English rendering for the short passage at I.36.5 (from "atha
kim idam ak?aram iti" etc down to "ak?aram iti sa?j?? kriyate") ?  I need to
check my rendering and do not have immediate access to a library copy.

This would be very much appreciated !

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
