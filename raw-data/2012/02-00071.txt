Subject: A Query re the development of garbha
Message-ID: <161227095270.23782.15928290687699404232.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List,

According to the Garbhopani?at  human embryos "solidify" one month
after conception, they become ka?hina. Turner (CDIAL 2650) informs the
word is used in the Su?rutasa?hit? and suggests it could be a
Dravidian borrowing.

[an embryo becomes] m?s?bhyantare ka?hina?: "in a month, it hardens".
A quick check of the Su?rutasa?hit? text doesn't show any phrase
combining the two: garbha and ka?hina.

Are there any other words used to describe this stage of the embryo's
'hardening' or 'solidification'? Does also the Hiranyagarbha undergo
this stage?


Thanks in advance, and greetings from snowy Warsaw,
