[sorry for cross posting]

Dear All,

My old friend, the Indologist Roberto (Silvio Edevain) Donatoni, has
suddenly passed away on his 53rd birthday, March 20, at his home in
Milano, Italy.

I am sure many of you know him. He was a refined Indologist (and 
Tibetologist). He studied in Pune. He translated from Sanskrit the 
Jivanmuktiviveka by Vidyaranya (Milano, 1995).

He worked for some 28 years as the editor of the Indology, Tibetan and 
Sanskrit books of the Adelphi (among the others, he amended Raniero 
Gnoli's translation of the TA). He served as one of the editors of the 
International Journal of Sanskrit Studies. He also owned one of the best 
(and biggest) private Sanskrit libraries in Italy.

He was always generous of suggestions and ready to help, and to lend
books. He was patient, meticulous, profound, yet "light" and cheerful.

He will be missed by many.
