Mangal may not suit MS Word 2007 in Windows XP which might automatically chose MS 97-03. Then it may be difficult to save and carry on without creating a new file. With Arial Unicode MS that too comes with Devnagari this problem did not rise in my computer. The problem with Mangal disappeared in the recently published MS Word. 

There is also an option to toggle between Devnagari and Roman.
