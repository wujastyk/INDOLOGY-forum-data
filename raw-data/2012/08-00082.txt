Subject: black lac?
Message-ID: <161227097144.23782.1966958622819491140.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list,
In a verse in the Madhuravijayam, at nightfall a day is said to seal the
lotus bud (which is as it were a chest) with a lak?ma j?tu?am in the form
of a bee.   J?tu?a is a kind of lac as far as we know, but if that is the
case how can it be the same colour as a bee?  Is there a very dark red lac
that could be taken for black, or is this instead a different substance -
like perhaps a wax?
The verse is:

????????????????

?????????????????????? ?

???????????????????

????????????? ?????? ??????? ?
I would be grateful for any thoughts.
Thank you
Venetia
