Dear all,

?????????? = k??iy???am = k??i-???am is clearly of Malay??am origin. It?s
meaning is "acting / performing together", "combined acting". Usually it
stands for the ?performing together? of at least two actors/actresses during
the final days of a performance cycle after several days of inserted
flashbacks presented by single characters. In the k??iy???am tradition long
solo-sequences or enactments with one character on stage only are called
"k?ttu? (i.e. "Na??y?r K?ttu" or "A?gul?y??kamk?ttu").

I discussed the etymological misunderstanding concerning the Sanskrit root
"k?rd" in my dissertation "Na??y?r-K?ttu ? ein Teilaspekt des
Sanskrittheaterkomplexes K??iy???am. Historische Entwicklung und
performative Textumsetzung", Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz 2008, pages 4 and 21.

Best regards,
Heike Moser
