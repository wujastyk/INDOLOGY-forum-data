Embarrassing as it may seem, I have to correct this for a second time. The
fact that our respected colleague and friend Sheldon Pollock once  
asked me to find somebody's address does not make me "a (former)  
assistant"
in a project. It does not even make me "involved" in his project in  
any real sense of the term.

Regardless of this ridiculous distortion, I consider it self-evident that
anybody within the scholarly community is free to associate with their
colleagues and provide help in connection with their individual research
projects, without having to justify themselves. It is one matter if
Reinhold Gr?nendahl disagrees with some of Pollock's published findings
and conclusions in a certain project. It is another matter altogether if
he (repeatedly) attempts to attack and vituperate all those whom he
somehow associates with Pollock's "project" (starting from the translator
of Pollock's contested article into German [in Gr?nendahl's paper in the
Roth Felicitation Volume], up to the persons of the Heidelberg South Asia
Institute who invited him for the keynote speech at the recent 50-year
celebration of the Institute [see the past disgraceful discussion in the
"Indologie" list).

Nothing more remains to be said on this strange behaviour in an
international forum, which definitely does not reflect on current "German
Indology" as a whole.
With best wishes,
Eli Franco
