dear Colleagues,

I wonder if someone might have already on their hard drive, or easy access
to: Tola, Fernando and Carmen Dragonetti. 1980. ?An?ditva or
Beginninglessness in Indian philosophy.? Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute 61: 1-20.
A scan would be much appreciated!

Cordial thanks in advance, Jonathan
