Subject: svara as breathing/respiration
Message-ID: <161227097582.23782.2385704209717078267.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Respected Scholars,

I?am looking for the earliest textual?references?of?"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e ?"praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for it?in particular in?tantra literature.?

Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
