concerning the meaning of "murch/m?rch" and related words I would like to call your attention to an [unfortunately still] forthcoming paper by Dr. Jan Meulenbeuld, which I was lucky to listen to during a small workshop in Copenhagen organized by Prof. Zysk. Here Dr. Meulenbeld has demonstrated on the basis of numeral passages from Sanskrit medical literature that the meanings of murch/m?rch could be boiled down to smth. like 'to become one homogeneous mass'. Exactly this meaning, I believe, could be rather naturally applied to both the passages quoted by Prof. Vielle. I wonder which passage Artur Karp actually had in mind, while asking his question and whether there too m?rch could be understood acc. to Dr. Meulenbeld's finding.

What ka?hina is concerned, I would like to briefly second Prof. Goodall's statement concerning the term ghana. In fact, the passage in Su?rutasa?hit? (3.3.18 acc. to GRETIL's e-text) applies this designation to a two-months-old embryo. The commentator ?alha?a briefly states on it: "ghana? ka?hina? |"

Best wishes 
with great respect for the passed away scholar
