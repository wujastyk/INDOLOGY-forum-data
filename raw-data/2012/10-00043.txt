Dear Sureshji,

Interesting question. I am aware of the use of the 'b' only in colonial,  
british sources ('Nerbudda/Narbada'). All the original texts (Sanskrit,  
Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati) I have seen in the course of my research on the  
Narmadaparikrama uniformly have the 'm'. In case you find the 'b' in any  
(South) Indian source, please let me know.

J?rgen
