Dear friends and colleagues,

For those of you who took the trouble to read this bizarre piece and
may wonder about the connection between Frauwallner and Hermann
Oldenberg's rac(ial)ist ruminations that Karin Preisendanz and I quoted
in our introduction to the new edition of Frauwallner's
Philosophie des Buddhismus, see the very explicit statement in  
Frauwallner, "Der arische Anteil ...", p. 286.

Gr?nendahl has obviously not bothered to carefully read the relevant
articles by F. before he produced another of his diatribes directed
against critical scholars who touch upon the (political) history of
Indology in Germany and Austria during the NS period (and before).

The sloppiness of his polemical scholarship is also seen in his  
fictitious assertion that Franco was "a (former) assistant on  
'Professor Sheldon Pollock's project on Indology during the time of  
National Socialism in Germany.'"

Further comments are not required here.

With best wishes,
Eli Franco
