Dear Jonathan, 

Let me add my deep condolences to all at Leiden and Wassenaar at the indeed shocking news of Tilman Vetter's passing. 
Tilman and I have closely worked together (such as in a joint class on the Brhad Aranyaka Upanisad) during my nearly 9 years at Leiden.
He also was my close and always helpful neighbor, two houses down, at Wassenaar.
He will be missed by all serious students of Indian philosophy.

If you would like to send messages to Mrs Vetter, I can collect them and convey them to her (please send them to me privately if they are intended for her, and not to the list).
