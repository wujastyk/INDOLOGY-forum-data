Subject: good book on early Vedic period?
Message-ID: <161227095133.23782.9081219755732068683.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is there a good book-length treatment of the Vedic-Upanishadic period that has been written relatively recently? I'm trying to find something I can recommend to the average well-educated reader.

Everything I've run across is either very old or is simply 1-2 chapters as part of an overall survey of Hinduism.

Best,

Dean
