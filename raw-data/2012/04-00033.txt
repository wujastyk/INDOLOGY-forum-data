Dear Colleagues and Friends,

I would like to share with you information on a book, which I have edited
together with a colleague of mine, Prof. Subrata K. Mitra, on the subject of
re-use in art history and political sciences. It has been published by SAGE
India. Please find the information below:

Re-Use - The Art and Politics of Integration and Anxiety
by? Julia A B Hegewald and Subrata K Mitra (eds.)
February 2012?? 360 pages?? SAGE Publications Pvt. Ltd??
Hardcover ISBN: 9788132106555
?47.50,   $60.00,   Rs?1500



Presented here is a novel approach to understanding the relationship between
the past and the present using the unique concept of re-use, wherein
elements from the past are strategically adapted into the present, and thus
become part of a new modernity. The book uses this method as a heuristic
tool for analyzing and interpreting cultural and political changes and the
transnational flow of ideas, concepts and objects. The chapters apply this
concept to South Asia but the concept of re-use and the method of its
application are both general and amenable to cross-cultural and comparative
analysis.

Re-use is a collection of well-researched and lucidly written scholarly
articles that apply the concept of re-use to different aspects of cultural,
political and material life?from art, architecture and jewelry to religion,
statesmen and legislatures. By not treating artistic, political, religious
and cultural developments as linear evolutions, this book encourages readers
to understand them as a continuous modification of the past and a periodic
return to earlier forms.

Beautifully illustrated with exquisite images, and containing a scholarly
bibliography pointing in the direction of hitherto unexplored terrain, this
new text will be a source of inspiration to the specialist and a source of
delight to the general reader.
