One may note that many possibilities in respect to
the transmission of Asian iconographical elements to Europe are
explored in the remarkable work _Le Moyen Age Fantastique_
of Jurgis Baltrusaitis. He was primarily concerned, however,
with Gothic art - a somewhat later period than that which
has been the focus of this thread.
