Dear Csaba:

This is wonderful news. I have long being fascinated by this book and wondered why it has not been subject to a good translation. Is it possible to buy it via Amazon? Thanks.

Patrick

Instead of the gods, sages and heroes of legend that people the Sanskrit literary epics, here gurus, princes and merchants jostle upon the streets of Benares, Patna and in the gardens of Mount Abu with bawds, prostitutes, rakes and rustics, and they are shown grappling with matters of life, death, love, lovelessness and livelihood.

The author, a minister at the court of a Kashmirian king, evinces particular empathy with those who have drawn the shortest straws?the abandoned prostitute in love, for instance, or the married woman seduced into a socially ruinous adulterous relationship.  Caustically irreverent humour, meanwhile, is meted out to religious hypocrites, to the tiresomely self-important, and to men of rank with more money than sense.

A German translation of an incomplete nineteenth-century edition was published in 1903, which was in turn rendered into French and the French then into English, and there have been translations into Hungarian and Japanese.
