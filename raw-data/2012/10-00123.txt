Dear Scholars,



It isconventionally believed that the warriors and bards in early Tamil society weremutually exclusive social groups. A closer examination of the Classical Tamiltexts reveals that this does not seem to be true. Consider the word ?ma??ar?.It is usually interpreted as denoting warriors. 
 
But Akam.189 andAi?k. 371 reveal that the ma??ar were also bards. In Akam.189, elephants whichcarry jack fruits using their raised trunks are compared to ma??ar who go to participatein a vi?avu (festival) in a different land carrying the concert percussioninstrument, mu?avu. Indeed Peruma?aippulavar, the modern commentator glosses?ma??ar? in this poem as ?k?ttar?. 
 
That ma??ar alsofunctioned as performing artists is inferred from Ai?k. 371.1 too, where apeacock is supposed to dance to the percussion by ma??ar. UVS glosses ?ma??ar?in this poem as ?v?rar? (warriors). He also glosses ?ko??u? as beating thepa?ai drum. Another commentator, Peruma?aippulavar, interprets this poem asreferring to warriors beating the war drum (p?r muracam). Because they haveinterpreted ?ma??ar? here as warriors, the commentators have missed the markcompletely. 
 
One can expectpeacocks to get scared of war drums rather than dance to their sound. In otherpoems, a peacock?s dance is compared to vi?ali?s dance performed to theaccompaniment of the concert drum ?mu?avu?. (See Akam. 82.4-9). ?Mu?avu?playing is associated with the festival ?vi?avu? in many poems as in Akam.206.11. 
 
It is thisperforming aspect of ma??ar that is intended in Ku?. 31 in which ma??argathering in a vi?avu is mentioned in a poem which describes the heroinesearching for her hero amidst the festival gathering. Here ma??ar could beplayers of mu?avu or dancers. In this poem the females are supposed to performthe tu?a?kai dance. Tu?a?kai dance is performed to the accompaniment of mu?avudrum. (See Akam. 336.16.) Going by the colophon of Ku?. 31, we can say Akam222.4-7 is related to the event mentioned in Ku?. 31. Here the hero is supposedto dance in the festival. (The very name of the hero, ???a? Atti, indicates hewas a dancer. Indeed he exemplifies the dual nature of the ma??ar.) It isbecause of his performing background, the heroine searches for the hero amongthe gathered ma??ar and tu?a?kai performers. But the commentators simplyinterpret ?ma??ar? in Ku?. 31 as warriors. Although ?ma??ar? are depicted aswarriors in other poems, in the poems mentioned above they are performers. Akam189 also indicates that the ma??ar went from place to place to perform in thefestivals just like other bards did.
 
Similar to Akam.82.4-9, in Akam. 352.4-7, the dance of a peacock is compared to the performanceby a vi?ali, who dances to the percussion of mu?avu by bards called k??iyar.The associations revealed by the poems such as those given above argue forconsidering ma??ar to be both bardic performers as well as warriors. 
 
Similar to?ma??ar?, we also have the word ?porunar? which can indicate warriors as wellbards. Maturaikkk??ci 98-104 describes porunar as having ?mu?avu? like arms(which is a description characteristic of warriors) and receiving gifts such aselephants and lotuses made of gold (which are typical gifts given to bards)!


In Porunar???uppa?ai (the guide poem of porunar), the poruna? isalso called the leader of ?k??iyar?. In Ci?up?????uppa?ai which is a guide poemof p??ar bards, in describing the welcoming nature of the city of the hero, thepoet says the gates of the city are open for porunar bards, poets, and brahminswhich suggests p??ar and porunar are essentially equivalent. Thus one is led tobelieve that the bards and warriors differed only on the basis of theactivities they engaged in and not in terms of any social origins.


Thanksin advance for any comments.
