The play Prabodhacandrodaya addresses the issue of zaantarasa and may be of some interest in this context; for the work enjoyed considerable popularity in later bhakti movements. in my introduction to the play in the Clay Series - where the title is The Rise of Wisdom Moon - I have a few words to say about this, together with references to the writings of Raghavan, Masson, and Patwardhan on the question. on the rasas in bhakti movements in particular, please refer to David Haberman's edition and trans. of the Bhaktirasaam.rtasindhu.

i don't know that he wrote a book specifically on the ninth rasa, but it may still be worth looking at: V. Raghavan. The Number of Rasas. Madras: The Adyar Library, 1967.

Dear Colleague,
Many years ago I happened to read a book by Dr.V.Raghavan on the ninth rasa. I do not remember the exact title but could try to find that out from the Visva Bharati library. The difficulty is the the Central Library of the University is rearranging its books when a they have to work with a chronic shortage of staff. Still I shall try with my colleagues.
You can also try with R?pa Gosv?min of the Chaitanya movement. Chinmayee Chatterji had some works on Gosv?min. But I myself have not read Chatterjee
