Someone on the list recently posted the article about the Kuppuswami Research Institute being in financial difficulties.  The following message has been doing the rounds in various Sanskrit forums and I thought it may be of interest to list members here too.  In summary, those that wish to support the institute may become life members for 2,000 rupees (for which they will receive some books).  From various email chains, I understand that those sending money from outside India should send it to:
THE KUPPUSWAMI SASTRI RESEARCH INSTITUTE.
Union Bank of India,
Mylapore Branch
Account No. 395702010007408
NEFT NO: UBIN0539571
IFSC CODE NO.600026009
But please do check with the institute first.
Best,
Venetia

Dear All,

I'm sad to put this news - which is quite painful to read... however the fact of the matter needs to be brought out. It is about saving a Sanskrit Research Institute the only one alive in Tamil Nadu

Those who wish to contribute need not do at free of cost - become a life-time member of this prestigious institution and receive publications from this institute free of cost for the life-time. Now when you pay Rs. 2000/- and become a life member - you'll receive about 8 Hard-bound books free of cost - including 4 volumes of Mahabashyam of Sage Patanjali (the great vyaakarana treatise) in Sanskrit with English translation and a Old Sanskrit Bija Ganita (Algebra) treatise

Thus your contribution will help to save one of India's premier Sanskrit research institute and also you receive books free of cost.

Kindly reach Dr.  K.S.Balasubramanian, Dy.Director, Kuppuswamy Sastri Research Institute, Sanskrit College, Mylapore, Chennai. Phone- 044-24985320

Warm regards
CG Krishnamurthi
