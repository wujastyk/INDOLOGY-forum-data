In this article, "Want to Change Academic Publishing: Just Say
No<http://chronicle.com/article/Want-to-Change-Academic/134546/?cid=at>"
Hugh Gusterson argues that major changes in the academic publishing world
-- especially the replacement of universities by commercial publishing
conglomerates as the primary publishers of learned journals -- mean that we
academics should start charging for our consultancy time and expertise in
the same way as other professionals.  I completely agree.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
