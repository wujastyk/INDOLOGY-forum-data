Dear Colleague,

Nirukta 7.5-7 give a
general assessment, 8-10 are more particular, 11-13 go even farther and pedantically. After
that each god is individually treated.
There is a note on anthropomorphism according to the Nirukta in Indian Etymologists and their Etymologies,

Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata 2002:31. Some comments will be found in Maxmueller's History of Sanskrit literature, 1858(?). There are other stray comments elsewhere but no comprehensive treatment.


Best
DB

What is the place of the Daivata Kanda of Nirukta in understanding Vedic mythology?

Best,
