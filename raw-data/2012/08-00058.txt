Dear Members of the Indology list,
Yesterday I received the sad news that Professor Dr. Claus Vogel, emeritus professor of Indology at the University of Bonn, honorary professor for Tibetology at the University of G?ttingen, member of the North Rhine-Westphalia Academy for Sciences and Arts, Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society and president of the Helmuth von Glasenapp Foundation passed away at 16 August 2012.

The funeral service will be held at twelve o?clock p.m., 24 August 2012 in the chapel of the Nordfriedhof, K?lnstra?e, 53177, Bonn.


Those of us who were fortunate enough to know Professor Vogel as a scholar, teacher and gentleman will always remember him.


With best regards,

Philipp Maas
