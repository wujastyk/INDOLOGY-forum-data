*Jaina Teachers? National Conference 2012 - Los Angeles*

*Dates: Friday May 25, 2012 to Monday May 28, 2012*

The primary objective of this conference is to have group discussions on
Pathshala Education Material, Teaching Methodology, and Tracking Systems
(see list of groups). We will avoid lectures and speeches. Participants
will be divided into groups based on their interests and expertise. We will
have some sessions with all the participants as one group.

This conference is designed for Jain Pathshalas in North America and other
Pathshalas which follow a similar format.  Scholars, academics and research
oriented professionals may not benefit by attending this conference.  We
welcome individuals who may be interested in starting similar Pathshalas at
their locations.



Registration fee for the conference is $25, which includes lodging and
boarding for the duration of the conference.   We encourage you to sign up
on-line ASAP by clicking on the link below. You would be able to pay the
registration fee of $25 on-line as well.  *Registration deadline is April
2, 2012**.*
