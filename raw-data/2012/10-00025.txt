Subject: Effects of Title VI cuts in US Area Studies
Message-ID: <161227097487.23782.14325183051245889454.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the Indology List,
I have heard and read that the US Congress in 2011 made a nearly 40% (ca. $50 Mill.) cut in the federal Title VI funding to all language programs and Area Studies in the USA. For background information, see for example:
http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/04/15/international_education_takes_hit_in_2011_budget

I would like to know, especially from the American members of the list, whether and how these cuts have affected programs of Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, and Indian studies in the USA and/or in the study-abroad programs.

Further, is there any news as to whether the lost funding will be reinstated in the 2012 budget now being negotiated in the Congress or are the cuts likely to remain?
