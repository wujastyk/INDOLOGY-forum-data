 To All,
         As a part of my Indological studies, I am at present involved in studying the eposh-making role palyed by Swami-Vivekananda, the Indian saint -philosopher who stormed the stage at the Parliament-of Religions at Chicago in 1893,and his subsequent Western visits to propagate the Vedantic spirit worldwide. H e had  a lot of Western admirers who felt his healing effect.I would be obliged if anybody can provide me with  details, in brief of the following admirers- 
                    1) Sister Devamata
                    2) Madame E.Calve
                    3) Ida Ansell. 

                                              ALAKENDU DAS
                                            Post-Graduate,Indology
