There has been very little study of this inscription since Bu:hler's edition. But D.C. Sircar re-edited it in Select Inscriptions vol. 1, pp. 192-197 (with a few references to other sources) and dated it to "second half of first century B.C." (Sircar generally tended to give later dates than most other epigraphists for early inscriptions.)

I believe that the date of this inscription has also been discussed by V.V. Mirashi, The History and Inscriptions of the Satavahanas and Western Kshatrapas, but I don't have a copy at hand. Probably Ajay Mitra Shastri has also talked about this in some of his historical publications.

  Subject: [INDOLOGY] N?n?gh?t inscription


  Dear Members of the List,


  In 1883, B?hler edited and translated an inscription found in the N?n?gh?t cave (Andhra Pradesh) in the Archaeological Survey of Western India, Vol. V, pp. 59?74.
  On the basis of epigraphic evidence, B?hler concluded that this inscription was incised between 200 and 150 BC (op. cit. p. 73).
  Has this dating been challenged since?
  Also, has any secondary literature on this inscription been produced after B?hler's paper and where can I find it?


  Many thanks in advance,
