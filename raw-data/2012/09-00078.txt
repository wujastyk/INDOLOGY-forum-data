>From my own experience, the problem is that when R.N. Bhattacharya has your email, you get a list nearly every day, and often the same ones (for a time they were sent by his wife or daughter Smt. S. Bhattacharya, using the email of his son? Niladri Sekhar Bhattacharya; maybe some of you remember the typed lists he used to send some years ago). The books I got from him are sometime in very bad state. A similar but maybe better Antiquarian bookseller in Kolkata is M/s. Bireswar Banerjee ( banerjee_books at rediffmail.com /  banerjee.books at gmail.com) whose lists  (made on attached .docs) are full of interesting books.
