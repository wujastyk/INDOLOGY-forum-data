Dear All,

This newly released documentary film may be of interest to those seeking materials on Aghor? s?dhus:

Warning: there is some rather gruesome footage of cannibalism!

All the best,

Jim

I am only aware of some scattered notions, e.g. Axel Michaels (?Der Hinduismus?, Munich: Beck, 1998) mentions the Aghor? ascetic Pagal?nanda who lived at the cremation ground close to the Pa?upatin?th temple in Deopatan. For Northern India, though, the situation is different: while in the accounts of the colonial administration the Aghor?s are stereotypically depicted as a public nuisance (cp. Balfour 1897, Barrow 1893, Crooke 1896, 1908), more recent research aimed at drawing a more differentiated picture. (American) Social Anthropologists worked mainly in Banaras on the tradition of B?b? K?n?r?m Aghor? and its social reforms under Avadh?t Bhagv?n R?m (which ? at least from hearsay ? had an impact on some Nepalese Aghor?s too). See e.g.

Both still deserve to be properly studied. Some more details on K?n?r?m (and other Aghor? or Augha? of his or of related traditions) and his literary work can be gathered from Indian publications, for example, Dharmendra Brahmac?r? ??str?s Santmat k? Sarbha?g-Samprad?y (Pa?n?, 1953). Last but not least, over the last decades the K?n?r?m?s themselves have been publishing many pamphlets and books about their tradition.

Leipzig, 2004), which deals with the historical background of the Aghor?s and the hagiographical accounts on K?n?r?m and contains a tentative translation of the G?t?val?, one of the collections of poems said to be composed by K?n?r?m.

To my knowledge, not much has been done on the tantric texts related to aghoras?dhan?, which is only rarely referred to by the K?n?r?m?s themselves (an exception is R?mdul?r Si?ha et al. (ed.): Aghora granth?vali?. Collected Works of Aghora Manuscripts. Varanasi, 1986). As I did not touch the topic for several years I might not be up to date. So if someone could provide further information on the tantric tradition on aghora I would be very thankful.

Actually, this question stemmed from a project I am pursuing in Lausanne, and which is starting to give some interesting results on the history of Vedic Ritual. I will post them on a website asap and advise the community. Thanks again.
