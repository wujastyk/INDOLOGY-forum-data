Dear colleagues,

sorry if the film "Vari - an Indian Pilgrimage" by the great  
ethnologist Guenther Sontheimer and Henning Stegmueller (1989  
http://www.onlinefilm.org/de_DE/film/51112) has already been mentioned  
during this exchange of information.
It is one of the most fascinating and moving - in the best sense of  
the word - documentaries I have ever seen.

Best wishes
Tatiana

> Colleagues,

> One of my favorites, though now a tad dated, is the BBC film "The  
> Fourth Stage," which documents the deliberations of a retired Deccan  
> Herald editor as he tries to decide whether he should follow a  
> family tradition and take samnyasa in his old age.  Included is his  
> pilgrimage to Srngeri (where he has an interview the Sankaracarya)  
> and Banaras (where he observes a ritual initiation into samnyasa),  
> as well as a fascinating discussion with his family ("We're all  
> against your idea!).  Now available on DVD. See:
