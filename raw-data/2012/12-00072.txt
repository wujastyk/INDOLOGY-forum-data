Dear Jean-Michel,

the idea of a jewel in the head (hood) of a snake is common literary topos. see e.g. K?lid?sa: M?lavik?gnimitra 3, 1+, Kum?rasa?bhava 2, 38; Raghuva??a 10, 7 & 11, 68 & 13, 12; Bhart?hari  2, 53; Vidy?kara: Subh??itaratnako?a 630, 861; K?emendra: Suv?ttatilaka 1, 1; Bh?gavatapur??a 10, 89, 54f. etc. etc.

The first image is quite clear, but does anyone know the meaning of the second ? What exactly is intended by the "jewels of the snake" and in what other source could we find this figure ?
