Subject: Terms for Negation ?

Dear List,

A bit tangentially: what is the Sanskrit term for 'liability'
(minus-value)?

Could philosophical interest in the idea of "negated reality"
('zero-value', 'lack of existence', 'emptiness') mirror in any way the
development of accounting methods and techniques?

Regards,
