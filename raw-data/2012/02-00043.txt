Dear Ravi, 

This article deals with that section of the Skandapurana to some extent.

Phyllis Granoff, "R?ma's Bridge: Some Notes on Place in Medieval India, Real and Envisioned," East and West 48 (1998): 93-115.

I have also discussed this work briefly in my dissertation, which I would be happy to send you off list if you are interested.

Best Wishes
BF

Dear All
Is there a translation of Brahmakanda of Skanda Purana available online? Or can someone tell me which volume of the MLBD translation contains the Setu Mahatmya? Also is there any secondary literature on the Setu Mahatmya? 

Thanks and Regards
Ravi
