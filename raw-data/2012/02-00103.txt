Dear Colleagues,

my thanks to All for useful bibliographical pointers on the use of
expressions related to "thickening, congealing, solidifying", such as
ka?hina, ghana, m?rch - as used in texts describing both the stages of
embryonic development and (as I am informed by my colleague, Dr.
Joanna Jurewicz) the stages of cosmogony.

The Buddhist Agga??a-sutta (DN, XXVII) contains in its description of
the evolution of the universe phrases drawing, it seems, on quite
widespread concepts of cosmogonical process.

"[...] ras? pa?hav? udakasmi? samat?ni seyyath?pi n?ma payaso tattassa
nibb?yam?nassa upari sant?naka? hoti, eva meva kho s? p?turahosi.
[...] Seyyath?pi n?ma sampanna? v? sappi sampanna? v? navan?ta? [...]"
(6).

"[...] earth with it savour was spread out in the waters. Even as scum
forms on the surface of boiled milky rice that is cooling, so did the
earth appear. [...] Even as well made ghee, or pure butter [...]".
(transl. T.W. and C.A.F. Rhys Davids, Dialogues of the Buddha, Vol.
III, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi 2007 [reprint ed.], p. 82)

 Are the comparisons to coagulated milk (sant?naka), ghee (sappi) and
fresh butter (navan?ta), to be found in the descriptions of embryonic
processes?

Best,

Artur Karp
