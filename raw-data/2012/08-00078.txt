Dear all,

I am currently editing a colleague's translation of the Tibetan text of the Buddhist Sarvarahasya Tantra.  It recently came to my attention that there is an unedited Sanskrit manuscript out there somewhere of Ratn?kara??nti's Sarvarahasyanibandha Rah??prad?pa.  I would very much like to consult this ms., but have no idea where it's currently located.  The Bongo Butten no Kenky? IV (p.203) indicates it as one of Rahula S??k?ty?yana's discoveries, giving the number 299.

Ideally someone has an image of this ms. in their possession and would be kind enough to share it with me.  Second best would be knowledge the precise current location so I can track it down myself.  But really, any leads would be greatly appreciated.

Much thanks,

Ryan
