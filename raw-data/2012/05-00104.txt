Subject: Lotus Sutra facsimile edition of Gilgit MS
Message-ID: <161227096381.23782.612401519291667961.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

(no idea why the photo is of a *Chinese* Manuscript...)

In more detail, and with photos, but in Japanese:

Now, if only it were possible to convince someone (whom?) that they should
publish the rest of the Gilgit MSS in color photos ... no need for fancy
printed volumes, online digital photos would be *most* welcome!

Cheers, Jonathan
