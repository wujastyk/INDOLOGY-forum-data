As I recall, the first chapter of Gayatri Reddy's book, WIth Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijira Identity in South India has a brief but decently thorough discussion of historical souces on the third gender. THis discussion starts on page 18 and cites most of the classic studies on the subject. The rest of the book is a pretty good read too.

Dear members of the list!

Do any of you know of papers / studies of non-standard sexualities in ancient India (homosexuality, transsexualism, lesbianism etc.)?

Best regards,
