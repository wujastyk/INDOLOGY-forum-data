Here are the already published volumes in this new Indological series (in which the vol.  2 of the  Su?ks?ma?gama has thus appeared as the n?3) issued from the IFP alone (differently from the  "Collection Indologie"  which is co-published by the EFEO and the IFP,  the n? 114 of which being the Su?ks?ma?gama vol. 1? the EFEO has also sometime his "own" Indological publications [I do not talk here about the EFEO general series called 'Publications de l'EFEO], not easy to find for the librarians: e.g. E. Wilden's Kuruntokai ed., 2010),

- n?1: N.S. RAMANUJA TATACHARYA, Ta?rkikacakravarti Gada?dharabhatta?ca?ryaviracitah Vyutpattiva?dah N.S. Ra?ma?nuja-ta?ta?ca?ryakr?taya? : Vidvanmanorama?khyaya? Vya?khyaya? Sahitah?. Volume 1. General editor : Harekrishna SATAPATHY ; associate editors : F. GRIMAL, S. LAKSHMINARASIMHAM. Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha Publication Series no. 231 ; Steles : Jean Filliozat Series in South Asian Culture and History, n? 1, IFP/Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati, 2011, xiii, 443 p. Distributed by the RSV, Tirupati. ISBN (IFP) : 978-81- 8470-185-2.

A good way to be informed about the books published in these various (sometime confusing) series, is to read the 'Institut d'Etudes indiennes" Newsletter, which lists all the French Indological publications. Here is the link for the last one:
