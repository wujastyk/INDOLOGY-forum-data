Subject: Sanskrit Manuscripts Project, Cambridge - First Release


Dear colleagues and friends,

as part of the project "The intellectual and religious traditions of South
Asia as seen through the Sanskrit manuscript collections of the University
Library, Cambridge"
(http://sanskrit.lib.cam.ac.**uk/<http://sanskrit.lib.cam.ac.uk/>),
funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), I am pleased
to announce the release of the first batch of catalogue records and digital
images of South Asian manuscripts, which you can find at the following
address:

http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/


The next release will be in the autumn. In the meantime, we look forward to
your comments and feedback.

Best wishes,

Vincenzo Vergiani
Director of the Project
