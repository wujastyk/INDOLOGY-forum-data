Dear list members,
in addition to becoming life members or contributing in other ways to  
the survival of the KSRI, we might also collectively think about how  
we can - as institutions teaching Sanskrit - integrate this wonderful  
institution in more sustained ways into our academic networks that  
extend beyond India.
The Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages (IKOS) at  
Oslo University for example has a long term agreement with the KSRI  
entailing that our Sanskrit students spend one semester (their third  
semester of Sanskrit teaching) at the KSRI, with four hours of  
Sanskrit teaching daily.
Our experience with this arrangement is entirely positive, and I could  
imagine that similar such agreements with other Sanskrit teaching  
institutions could improve conditions there considerably.
If you are interested in the details of our agreement and expereinces  
of our students there, please contact me: ute.huesken at ikos.uio.no
Best regards
Ute Huesken
