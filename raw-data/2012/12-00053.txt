Subject: Sad announcement: Passing of Prof Tilmann Vetter (1937-2012)

dear Friends,

It is with great sadness and shock that I pass along the news that Prof
Tilmann Vetter passed away this morning quite suddenly. The funeral will be
private. If you would like to send messages to Mrs Vetter, I can collect
them and convey them to her (please send them to me privately if they are
intended for her, and not to the list).

Jonathan Silk
