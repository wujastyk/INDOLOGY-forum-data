Stephen,

thank you for providing more information. A quick glance at Negi's 
dictionary, entry for bzlog pa - just by way of an example - may clarify 
why I prefer to put "retrovert" in inverted commas (intended to indicate 
the uncertainty involved in the whole enterprise): there's quite a few 
words "bzlog pa" might translae ...

In this case the meaning "to exclude" seems pretty clear, but there are 
also several candidates for the word that "bzlog pa" might translate 
when this meaning is assumed: niv?tti, vy?v?tti, vy?vartana, and more.

Judging from discussions about negation in Buddhist epistemological and 
logical treatises, I tend to assume that either of these words is 
possible here, and that they all are widely used without much 
discrimination to denote the function of negative terms or particles.

In other words, this doesn't seem to be a particularly technical usage 
which would be part of some classification of kinds of negation, but an 
account using generally widespread terminology.

I hope this helps a little,

best,

Birgit
