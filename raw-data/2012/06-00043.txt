Hi Dominik,

     Does this font have some special features?  If it does, may be I would like to have it as well.

Thanks, I now have a copy.  Took less than 5 minutes, I think.

Amazing thing, this network of generous colleagues.

Best,
Dominik

I'm after Shantipur OT, not Shantipur 99.

Many thanks,
