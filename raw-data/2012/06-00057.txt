A few years ago I put together a set of Keynote presentations for teaching Sanskrit. Alas, when I converted them to PowerPoint and viewed them in Microsoft Office, they were badly garbled. The only workaround I could find to make them available to Windows-based students was to export them as PDF files. All the MS Office for Mac applications I have tested make a mess of Unicode once one uses non-roman scripts. Why can't Apple and Microsoft learn to get along?
