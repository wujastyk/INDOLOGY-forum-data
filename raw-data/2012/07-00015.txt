University. From 1985 to 1989, a substantial grant from the Land
Baden-Wrttemberg officially opened its distribution beyond the
limits of the University and started its success as a highly
appreciated research tool for many projects at about a hundred
universities and academic institutions in the German speaking
part of the world, represented since 1993 in the International
TUSTEP User Group (ITUG). Reports on important projects relying
on TUSTEP and a list of publications (includig lexicograpic
works and critical editions) can be found on the tustep webpage.
