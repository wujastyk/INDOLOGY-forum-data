Thank you Sir very much for your valuable information. We?find in?Yogic texts, Svara is used in term of praa.na. 
?
As you would know, there is a text available?known as?"svarodaya". I wonder why it is?called svarodaya"saastra, why not?praa.nodaya.
?
As per avaialble materials we find in its colophon: iti umaamahe"svarasa.mbaade svarodayaj~naana.m sa.mpuur.nam. After?I closely went?through available aagamas and puraa.nas I?could not?find its source text. I would be grateful for?further?information and help on this subject.
?
?
Once again thanks to all of you for your valuable informations.
?
with Best Regards,?

In the description of the generation of sound, P??in?ya?ik?? vss 6cd and 7ab state:
?The mind hits the bodily fire, that sends the (bodily) wind (=breath), the breath roaming in the breast generates a charming svara.? 
The place of the wind ie breast seems to indicate that life-breath that is Pr??a is meant. Not itself svara it is held responsible for its generation.

Respected Scholars,

I?am looking for the earliest textual?references?of?"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e ?"praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for it?in particular in?tantra literature.?

Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
