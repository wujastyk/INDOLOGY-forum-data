Dear all
Patanjali said there were 21 rgvedic sakhaas 100 yajurvedic 1000 samavedic
and 9 atharvasakhas. How much time it  might have taken to loose these
shaakhas.
What might be correct time of patanjali when he says these sakhas are
present. based on this lossing period.
And bigger question is whether he can be taken speaking truth on the number
of shakhaas or not.
One more thiing is i had heard from prof prabhakara shastriji that   a list
of nearly 500 lost smrtis in baroda library. Thiis list of works that were
in the possession of kavindracharya  a is ascribed to some student  of
that acharya in varanasi. During muslim attack somebody fled to gujarat
with this library list to survive attack. List survived While the listed
smrtis are lost in the process. Is it true?
Can somebody send the pdf of list.
