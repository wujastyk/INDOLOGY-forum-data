Dear Prof. Dehejia,

In the event it may be of assistance, I'm pasting below my (perhaps a year or so out of date) biblio on music and religion in South Asia.  My favorite starting point, for students, is the article by Donna Wulff.  Below also are links to RISA-L bibliographies on the topic.

Best wishes, Lance
