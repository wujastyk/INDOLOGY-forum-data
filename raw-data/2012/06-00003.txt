" An alternative approach to the history of philosophy ? one that takes the
aim of opening up the discipline seriously ? would treat both Western and
non-Western philosophy as the regional inflections of a global phenomenon."

Brilliant article, a view shared by a few and long overdue. 
But how stuck in their ethnocentric mire are our universities??
