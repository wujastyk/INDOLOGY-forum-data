Dear Fran?ois,

just a short addition: The R?jguru of Sav?? Jaisingh, Ratn?kara D?k?ita 
Mah??abde, was given the title Samr?? and Pu???r?ka (or Pau??ar?ka). The 
titles are linked to the V?japeya- and Pu??ar?ka-sacrifices performed in 
1709 and 1713.
See: Horstmann, Monika. 2009. Der Zusammenhalt der Welt. Religi?se 
Herrschaftslegitiation und Religionspolitik Mah?r?j? Sav?? Jaisinghs 
(1700-1743). Harrassowitz. On Ratn?kara pp. 24-39.
P. 25, fn. 41 "Bei dem Pu??ar?ka-Opfer handelt es sich um ein 
einundzwanzigt?giges Soma-Opfer". So now we have to check whether 11 or 
21 days is correct.
Best

Joerg
