Maybe we can all agree that "Sanskrit" in the attribution "Sanskrit  
proverb" (just like very often in the Internet) only means "Ancient  
Wisdom". I think we discussed a similar issue already and Dominik  
brought several examples of people thinking that other inspiring  
"subh?????itas" must have certainly come from India.

Best,
