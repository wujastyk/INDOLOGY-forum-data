Dear Jonathan,

I have recently been using two programs for text critical editing. The first is Juxta, which can be used to collate multiple witnesses and highlight textual discrepancies. The second is Classical Text Editor, a word processor designed to prepare critical editions and which allows the creation of multiple layers of footnotes. I find both programs to be very user friendly.

Dear All, 

I use Mac and I've started to work with La Tex for the purpose of noting variants in texts. ?I find La Tex a bit non-user-friendly, and I'm wondering if someone could recommend a good website for Indologist, Sinologist, etc. who are making critical editions, or (preferably) if anyone knows a better program that will allow for multiple footnote bars, margin notes, etc.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Edelmann
