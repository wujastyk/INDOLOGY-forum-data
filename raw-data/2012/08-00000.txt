Dear Peter,
This Wikipedia page suggests that it is a neighborhood in Chennai, also going by the name Triplicane and having a slightly different spelling.

> Dear all,

> On my desk I have a Sanskrit Mahatmya in Telugu script. The title reads:
> 
> ?r?mad-?gneyapur???ntargata Tul?k?ver?m?h?tmyam / 
> R?m?nujapuram-?nanda?pi??ai-?la?i?gar?c?rye?a pari?k?tam. (Mahatmya on 
> the Tulakaveri feast, taken from the Agnipurana)
> 
> In the second part it is said that it was printed by the Sarasvati 
> Bhandara Press (Tiruvavlikke?i-Sarasvat?bha???ramudr?k?ara??l?y?m 
> mudritam), in the year 1874/1875 (Bh?vasa?vatsare ...). What is puzzling 
> me is the name Tiruvavlikke?i. Is this a place name? According to the 
> India Office Library Catalogue, this work was printed in Madras. So, may 
> I conclude that Tiruvavlikke?i is Madras/Cennai or a part of it? Please 
> help me to throw some light on it.

> I have put a scan of the title page under URL: <http://goo.gl/UZEYy>.
