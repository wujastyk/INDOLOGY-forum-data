Dear List (sorry for x-posting),

The club is making efforts to include scholars from outside the Philadelphia area in this one day symposium. Abstracts from South Asianists are especially welcome. Registration and other details are below.
----------------------The Oriental Club of Philadelphia's Introduction SymposiumMar 3, 2013The Oriental Club of Philadelphia, an academic society founded in 1888, is one of the oldest continuously running organizations of its kind in the U.S. In recent times, the OC has organized regular lectures, conferences, and symposia for scholars of Asian Studies in the Philadelphia area. This year, we are expanding our mission beyond our own neighborhood by inviting scholars from throughout PA, NJ, and DE and beyond to participate in our first-ever Introduction Symposium. All scholars, ABD graduate students, and library/museum professionals of Asian Studies (including East, South, Southeast, Central Asia, and the Near East) in the region are cordially invited to participate.The purpose of this one-day event is to assemble together the Asian Studies community throughout the tri-state region. We look forward to meeting one another socially, as well as to the opportunity to briefly introduce one another to our research. The symposium will consist of a series of brief "lightning lectures" of 5-7 minutes each, with frequent breaks for dialogue and networking. A summary of the proceedings will be published both on the OC website (www.TheOrientalClub.org) and in the program that will include abstracts of all presentations, as well as contact information for all attendees.This event will be hosted by Penn State's Abington College, in the suburbs north of Philadelphia.Location: Abington College1600 Woodland Rd.Abington, PA 19001Symposium registration fee: $45 for those with employment$25 for graduate students, emeriti, and unemployed(Registration fees include 1-year membership in the OC.)More information & registration: http://theorientalclub.org/events.htmlPresenters are required to submit a title and 100-word abstract when registering.
