Here is the scan of the ViP CE vol. 1 p. 16 which might be of some interest to the list.

> Dear James,
> the Baroda Critical edition of the ViP (The Critical Edition of the Vi??upur??am, ed. M. M. Pathak, 2 vols, Vadodara: Oriental Institute, 1997-1999) lists several commentaries (and their editions) under "Testimonia", vol. 1, p. 16 (I can scan this page tomorrow).
> I think that the earliest one is by ?r?dh?ra, publ. in the 1907 Ve?ka?e?vara Steam Press ed. (reprinted, e.g. Nag Publishers) of the ViP (on the date of this commentator, see P.K. Gode, Studies in Indian Literary History, vol. 2, 1954, p. 169 sq. "between c. A.D. 1350 and 1450":     http://archive.org/details/StudiesInIndianLiteraryHistoryVolume2 ).

> Dear Colleagues,

> Are any of you aware of works that take up commentators on the Vishnu Purana?
>  
> I have been asked about commentaries on this text by a student and am embarrassingly ignorant!
>  
> Should anyone have any texts of these commentaries (or references for them, if printed editions exist), I would also be grateful.

> The student reads Sanskrit well.
