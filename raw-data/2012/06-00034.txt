Subject: murals in lankan monastries
Message-ID: <161227096484.23782.5779087604872253649.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Any interest in the paintings in
the temple-paintings of Sri Lanka?
I tried to involve my pictures in a wordpress.blog,
without any diary context.
The first blog 
http://ummaggajataka.wordpress.com/
presents the first part of the Ummagga-jataka which
covers the walls of a temple near Galle in Sri Lanka.

The next blog:
http://ranwella.wordpress.com/
Pages 1-10 showing three wonderful and
important temples (Ambalangoda, Kataluva, Ranwella) and
providing an interior view of certain monastries.
Pages 11-29 presenting certain buddhist themes painted in different
styles during the last three centuries (11-29),

Since paintings do not need to be translatet
all can enjoy

Heiner
