Subject: Call for Papers: SAGP/SSIPS 2012 Conference in New York
Message-ID: <161227096378.23782.16454221486513956678.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues,

I'm forwarding a CFP on Indian philosophy/Buddhism for a conference to be
held in October at Fordham University's Lincoln Center campus:

I enclose the CFP for the SAGP's 2012 Annual Conference at Fordham
University (Lincoln Center). The conference has grown over the year's to an
international ancient and medieval philosophy conference, so we welcome
contributions from all areas of non-Western philosophy as well.
(Contributions for Indian philosophy should be sent to me, contributions
for Buddhist studies can be sent either to me or Marie Friquegnon.)

Proposals can be of three types: either individual papers, for a panel
session, or a roundtable discussion.
