Dear Patrick,

I am not sure about the first problem, but if you would like to get a three letter conjunct (g+?+vi) then I am afraid this might just not be possible on the Mac.

As far as ?+g is concerned, this works in Textedit (preinstalled Mac text editor) after activating the "Additional conjuncts" option in the submenu "Typography" of the ?+T menu. I would suppose in Page should be a similar way to add less frequent compounds, but I don't use this program.

Best wishes,
Sven
