It vaguely reflects the idea of rolling time in a Tagore
song
?With two hands are played the cymbals of time, 
?Left and right 
With two hands?/
Beat by beat
Morning and night
New waves ever go on rising,
In the conflict yonder of white and black
Various colours are created rhythmically
Etc etc?
?A point by point similarity
is not claimed.

Well the very first link attributes it to K?lid?sa, though this may well be an apocryphal attribution. The (English) quote appears to come from Sir William Osler (deemed "father of modern medicine") who supposedly liked to use it in his speeches. The attributed title is "Salutation to the Dawn". One can find a number of email lists on 'the google' (to quote George Bush) who have attempted to vet this with not much success, although I did not search too deeply.

Now, there is 20 minutes I will never get back. . . .

Back to editing articles.

If you google the line "For yesterday is but a dream
And tomorrow is only a vision."?
