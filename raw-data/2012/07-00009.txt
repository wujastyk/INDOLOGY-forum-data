Subject: Anup Sanskrit Library catalogue scan?
Message-ID: <161227096708.23782.436005921934285315.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,

Is anyone aware of a digital copy of the *Catalogue of the Anup Sanskrit
Library* by C Kunhan Raja and
K. Madhava Krishna Sarma (Bikaner: The Authority, [Govt. Press],
1944-1948)?  It was reprinted in 1993.

I've looked in the Digital Library of India, Archive.org, bookfi dot org,
and one or two other places.  On Google books I find fasc. II of 1946 and
the 1993 reprint, but neither is downloadable.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
