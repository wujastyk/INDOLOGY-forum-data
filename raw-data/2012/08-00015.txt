enhance existing departmental strengths would be an asset. Candidates  
must demonstrate evidence of excellence in and commitment to both  
research and teaching, with established or clear promise of  
distinguished publications in their field. The successful candidate  
will have the ability to teach a broad range of courses from the  
introductory to advanced levels about diverse aspects of South Asian  
Religious Literatures, contributing to the undergraduate program on  
the Mississauga campus, and will hold a graduate appointment at the  
Department for the Study of Religion on the St. George campus of the  
University of Toronto.

syllabi, assignments and tests; descriptions of teaching strategies  
and innovations, etc.). If you have any questions about this position,

two files in PDF/MS Word format. Submission guidelines can be found

vibrant intellectual community of world-class scholars at Canada?s  
largest university. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is one of the most  
fascinating, diverse and ?livable? places in the world.

The University of Toronto is strongly committed to diversity within  
its community and especially welcomes applications from visible  
minority group members, women, Aboriginal persons, persons with  
disabilities, members of sexual minority groups, and others who may
