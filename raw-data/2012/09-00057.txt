N?n?gh?t cave (probably N??egh??; N??e=coin) is in the western ghats of
Maharashtra. Many aspects of N??egh?t inscription, for that matter of the
Satavahanas, are still unsettled.  However, many consider the Nanaghat
inscription now to be belonging to the late 1st Century BCE, as S.
Chattopadyaya (1974:35) writes "Nanaghat record is palaeographically later
than the Besnagar inscription of Heliodoros of c. 100 BC [...]"

However, more investigation and further discussion on the issues related to
the chronology and origin of the Satavahanas is clearly a desideratum. As
Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (2004:30) remarks "[...] coins from the
Amaravathi hoard, the recently discovered Veerapuram (Kurnool dist. of
Andhra Pradesh) coins, stray coins from Duvvuru-Athreru or from Vaddamanu
-- may date back to the mauryan period. [...] At sites like Kotilingala in
Karimnagar dist. and Veerapuram in Kurnool dist. both in Andhra Pradesh,
inscribed coins seem to succeed uninscribed coins." Furthermore, he
notes(223p.): "[the] distribution pattern of [the Satavahana coins] would
indicate the presence of segments of the Satavahana *kula *in the different
areas of the Deccan before the thrust towards western Deccan where the
early records of the imperial family are located."

As John C. Huntington once remarked, Andhra archaeology is a vast and
mostly closed book waiting to be read.
