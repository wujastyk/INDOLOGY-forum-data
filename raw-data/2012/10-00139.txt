There might be something about this in the context of the 19th century in Richard Burton's long essay about eunuchs and the other notes to his translation of the Thousand and One Nights.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] gender in Hijra's speech?
 

Dear Colleagues,
A Japanese colleague interested in gendered language forms asked me about how Hijra's speak, as men or women.?
As far as I know in Hindi hijras speak using female agreements for first person, but what about other South Asian languages, any suggestions on anybody who has written on this?
Also are the precedents from Sanskrit or Tamil literatures of ?men speaking as women and adopting language forms distinctive of women?
regards
Peter
