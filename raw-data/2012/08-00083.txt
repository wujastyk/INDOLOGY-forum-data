Subject: Chinese transliteration of Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227097147.23782.12916974730763117036.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues,

A friend has asked me whether there is a standard transliteration scheme
for rendering Sanskrit into modern Chinese.  My friend does not need a
properly scientific system--she is a yoga teacher working in China who is
interested in transcribing some bhajans for her students' use.  Any
suggestions would be much appreciated: please contact me off-list,

Best,

Whitney
