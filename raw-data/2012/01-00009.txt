Subject: FW: Query from a colleague not on this list
Message-ID: <161227094879.23782.856036041952135634.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List, 

 

A colleague not on this list agreed for me to post his query, sent
originally to the risa-l list, on Indology.  I hope he'll get some answers
here.

 

Thanks and best wishes,

Joanna Kirkpatrick
