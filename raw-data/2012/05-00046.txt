Subject: poets from Bihar?
Message-ID: <161227096220.23782.12697917246680527967.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list,
Is anybody aware of Sanskrit poets from the area that is now Bihar?  I
imagine there may have been some well known poets from Pataliputra whose
works have survived, and perhaps from other places and periods too.
I would be grateful for any leads or ideas.
Thank you
Venetia
