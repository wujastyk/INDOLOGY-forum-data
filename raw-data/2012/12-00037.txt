As mentioned, /bhikkhave/ is normal for the vocative plural in Pali 
(possibly a survival of an eastern form). /Bhik?ave/ appears to be the 
only form found in G?ndh?r? for the vocative plural. It also occurs 
sporadically in Buddhist Sanskrit texts (including the 
/Sa?ghabhedavastu/ and the /D?rgh?gama/ manuscript). Probably in later 
times it would tend to be corrected to /bhik?avo/ by scribes. So there 
is no way of knowing what Medh?tithi intended and we can only follow the 
Mss.
