Dear Madhav,

This construction is quite common in Pali, for which see the CPD s.v. atthi. Warder mentions it in his Introduction to Pali (but I don?t have a copy at hand, so cannot give you the page reference) and there may be a reference in von Hin?ber?s Das ?ltere Mittelindisch im ?berblick. Norman does not seem to discuss it in his critical notes on Sn, Dhp, or Th/Th? where examples are found, except to say in his note on Sn 759 ?The use of atthi with a plural subject is so common as to make the cty?s remark about the change of number unnecessary.?

For an example in G?ndh?r?, see Richard Salomon Two G?ndh?r? Manuscripts of the Songs of Lake Anavatapta (Anavatapta?g?th?), 2008: 202, where he refers to Bechert ?Grammatisches aus dem Apad?nabuch.? Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, 108, 1958: 315.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on Pali syntax

Hello Colleagues,

     I am reading the Mah?satipa??h?nasutta from the D?ghanik?ya with a few students.  In this Sutta, phrases like atthi k?yo, atthi cittam, atthi vedan? are quite frequent, and pose no problems.  However, then comes the phrase atthi dhamm? a few times.  It is quite clear from the context that dhamm? is nominative plural (other refs in the context in plural: dhammesu dhamm?nupass?).  I am wondering how to explain the syntax of the phrase atthi dhamm?.  Any suggestions?  Perhaps, K.R. Norman might have an explanation.  Does anyone have his email address?  Thanks.

Madhav
