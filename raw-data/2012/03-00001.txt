Friends~
 
I am researching the tradition of joining two letters.
 
1. In the bhashas it is called jodakshara. What is the Sanskrit word for this?
2. Is this in any way related to joining two images as in Ardhanari or Harihara?
3. What is the semantic impact of joining two letters or images?
 
Kind regards.
