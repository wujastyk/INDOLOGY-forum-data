The University of Chicago Library invites applicants for the position of Bibliographer for Religion and Philosophy. The Religion and Philosophy collections in the University of Chicago Library are among the strongest research collections in the nation.

The University encourages interdisciplinary teaching and research and there is strong use of the religion and philosophy collections by faculty and students from area studies programs as well as many humanities and social science disciplines.
