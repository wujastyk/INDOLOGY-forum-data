Subject: Frits Staal memorial volume
Message-ID: <161227096693.23782.6151235167228119289.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List,

Richard Payne, Dean and Yehan Numata Professor of Japanese Buddhist
Studies at the Institute of Buddhist Studies in Berkeley, has proposed
to publish a memorial volume devoted to Frits Staal either in the
journal that his institute produces: Pacific World: Journal of the
Institute of Buddhist Studies
<http://www.shin-ibs.edu/academics/_pwj/>, or as a volume in the IBS's
Contemporary Issues in Buddhist Studies series (supported by BDK
America, and marketed and distributed by the University of Hawai'i
Press <http://www.shin-ibs.edu/academics/_cibs/>)

Like myself, Richard is a former student of Frits and he would very
much like to honor him and his rich contributions to so many fields of
study.

Pacific Journal is an annual publication. Richard anticipates that it
will take two years to produce this memorial volume.  He has asked me
to edit the volume, and to invite scholars from all of the fields in
which Frits flourished to consider contributing to it.

We hope to receive contributions that will cover the full range of
Frits' scholarly interests.  We will certainly seek advice from
specialists in those disciplines which we ourselves are not competent
to judge.

Proposals can be sent to me at gthomgt at gmail.com

or to Richard at rkpayne1 at mac.com

Richard and I look forward to working with you on this tribute to our
teacher and friend.

Best wishes,

George
