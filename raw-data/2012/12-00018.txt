Several years ago a group of Belgian speleologists of the Socotra Karst 
Project made a spectacular discovery. Deep inside a huge cave on the 
island Socotra they came across a large number of inscriptions, drawings 
and archaeological objects. As further investigation showed, they were 
left by sailors who visited the island between the 1st c. BC and the 6th 
c. AD. The majority of the texts is written in the Indian Bra-hmi- 
script, but there are also inscriptions in South-Arabian, Ethiopian, 
Greek, Palmyrene and Bactrian scripts and languages. This corpus of 
nearly 250 texts and drawings thus constitutes one of the main 
sourcesfor the investigation of Indian Ocean trade networks in the first 
centuries of our era.

The present book is the first comprehensive edition and study of this 
material.

It comprises contributions by an international group of scholars who 
have been working on these new discoveries for a couple of years (in 
alphabetical order): Mikhail D. Bukharin (Moscow), Peter De Geest 
(Brussels), H?di Dridi (Neuch?tel), Maria Gorea (Paris), Julian Jansen 
Van Rensburg (Brussels), Christian Julien Robin (Paris), Bharati Shelat 
(Ahmedabad), Nicholas Sims-Williams (London, Oxford) and Ingo Strauch 
(Berlin).
