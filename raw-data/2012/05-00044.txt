  I would like to thank Joseph Walser, Tim Cahill, Peter Wyzlic, Petra Kieffer-P?lz, Hartmut Buescher, Dermot Killingley, Andrey Klebanov for their help. 
    Assuming that this may be of interest to others than me, I take the liberty of passing the material I received on to the Indology list.
    Best regards,

    As I recall, the first chapter of Gayatri Reddy's book, WIth Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijira Identity in South India has a brief but decently thorough discussion of historical souces on the third gender. THis discussion starts on page 18 and cites most of the classic studies on the subject. The rest of the book is a pretty good read too.

    ?I heartily agree with Vasu on this point: Thadani's textual analysis is VERY problematic, and I too would be very careful of endorsing her claims without sound knowledge of the texts in question. Personally, however, I found the material in the latter half of the book to be very interesting, since it gives one a picture of the current situation (which is not so pretty, actually). Still, the book is useful since there is nothing else (to my knowledge) like it, and the bibliography is quite diverse. Tracy

      Rachel Fell McDermott's article in JAAR 68(4), December 2000. It's not specifically on sexuality, but some sex-related issues come up.
                ?To the array of print literature already cited, add "The Extreme Orient: The Construction of 'Tantrism' as a Category in the Orientalist Imagination," by Hugh B. Urban, published in the journal Religion (1999), 29: 123-46.
      Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai entitled, "Same Sex Love in India: Readings from Indian History and Literature." The authors present a vast array of sources documenting same sex love in India from ancient to contemporary times. Their critical essays introducing the literature of a period (ancient, medieval, colonial, contemporary) as well as specific genres and authors are outstanding--erudite, insightful and extremely well grounded in scholarship on gender and sexuality. After Vanita's insightful discussion of the passionate (though not necessarily sexual) love expressed between Arjuna and Krishna, you'll never read the Mahabharata the same way again.

  >... studies of non-standard sexualities in ancient India (...,

    ?Not least also in view of the significance of this issue in the MBh, Robert P. Goldman's ?Transsexualism, Gender, and Anxiety in Traditional India?
  [in: Journal of the American Oriental Society 113.3 (1993): 374-401], providing a survey of ?a number of salient examples of transsexualism drawn from the religious and mythological texts of ancient and medieval India? (further references in his bibliography), is likewise rather indispensible.

  I note that Peter Wyzlic has referred to Ruth Vanita's work. Here's another by her: 'Full of God: Ashtavakra and Ideas of Justice in Hindu Texts' (Religions of South Asia 3 (2009): 167-81). It uses the story of Ashtavakra in Mahabharata 13 and other sources in an imaginative (rather than a strictly indological) way, as a protest against norms of gender, sexual orientation etc.
