they will receive some books).  From various email chains, I understand
that those sending money from outside India should send it to:
THE KUPPUSWAMI SASTRI RESEARCH INSTITUTE.
Union Bank of India,
Mylapore Branch
Account No. 395702010007408
NEFT NO: UBIN0539571
IFSC CODE NO.600026009
But please do check with the institute first.
Best,

Dear All,

I'm sad to put this news - which is quite painful to read... however the
fact of the matter needs to be brought out. It is about saving a Sanskrit
Research Institute the only one alive in Tamil Nadu

Those who wish to contribute need not do at free of cost - become a
life-time member of this prestigious institution and receive publications
from this institute free of cost for the life-time. Now when you pay Rs.
2000/- and become a life member - you'll receive about 8 Hard-bound books
free of cost - including 4 volumes of Mahabashyam of Sage Patanjali (the
great vyaakarana treatise) in Sanskrit with English translation and a Old
Sanskrit Bija Ganita (Algebra) treatise

Thus your contribution will help to save one of India's premier Sanskrit
research institute and also you receive books free of cost.

Kindly reach Dr.  K.S.Balasubramanian, Dy.Director, Kuppuswamy Sastri
Research Institute, Sanskrit College, Mylapore, Chennai. Phone- 044-24985320
