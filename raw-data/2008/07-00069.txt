Subject: Surgical instruments of the Hindus, by Mukhopadyaya

Dominik,

I very vaguely remembered some such assertion, but my chances of remembering where and by whom are nil.  Or could there be another book with illustrations of surgical instruments which were alleged by the author or editor to be reproductions of ancient illustrations?  Another vague memory was of a plate or two solely of alleged ancient Indian instruments, in a style both cruder and less realist than Mukhopadhyaya's.  But if you don't know of any such allegation I expect my memory played tricks on me.

This raises in my mind some general thoughts on illustrations traditions in India, but I think I'll post another note starting a new thread on that.
