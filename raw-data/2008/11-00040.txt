Dear colleague,
There is a short appendix about "Betel Chewing in Ancient India" in  
Om Prakash: Economy and Food in Ancient India,  Vol. 2, Bharatiya  
Vidya Prakashan, Delhi 1987 which has many other references; and an  
article by P.K. Gode: Studies in the history of tAmbUla" in sArdha- 
ZatAbdi Special Volume of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of  
Bombay (New Series) Vol. 31-32, 1956-57 (Publ. June 1959), and, of  
course, the introduction to tAmbUla ManjarI,  Journal of the Oriental  
Institute Baroda Vol. VII, 1957-58.
  Furthermore, there is  one page(p.89)  about betel in P.  
Arundhati's "translation" of the MAnasollAsa called Royal Life in  
MAnasollAsa Sundep Prakashan Delhi 1994.
  Hope this might be of some help.
