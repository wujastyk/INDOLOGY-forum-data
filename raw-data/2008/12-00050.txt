Subject: shirt studs in India
Message-ID: <161227084201.23782.11092081626637840228.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Struggling with my black tie for the Romila Thapar award ceremony last week, the following question occurred to me.

For special events Indian men will frequently wear silver, gold, or jeweled shirt studs, with a chain inside the shirt keeping them together and safe (very good idea).  In the Indian antique shops I have seen older ones, though I have no way of guessing their dates.  I have never seen the chained ones in Western antique shops.  

Is there any evidence whether the use of studs existed before the British era?  Were they in use in Islamicate societies?

I don't recall seeing them in miniatures.  Usually, of course, the shirts are double-breasted and  fastened at the shoulder.
