Description:
Rajput maharajas have ruled hundreds of places throughout northern
India, not just Rajasthan. The Rathor clan of Rajputs, headed by the
Maharaja of Jodhpur, ruled states in Central India (Alirajpur, Jhabua,
Jobat, Ratlam, Sailana, Sitamau), Eastern States Agency (Seraikela),
Rajasthan (Bikaner, Jodhpur, Kishangarh, Kushalgarh), and Western India
(Idar, Malpur).  The speakers include the son and grand-daughter of the
Maharaja of Dhrangadhra, who heads the Jhala clan of Rajputs. Jhalas
ruled states in Western India (Chuda, Halvad- Dhrangadhra, Limbdi,
Laktar, Limbdi, Sayla, Wadhwan,and Wankaner) and in Rajasthan (Jhalawar)
and were also in Central India. 
 
The program includes talks dealing with Maharaja Gaj Singh II and
Maharaja Ganga Singh, two of the greatest Rajputs of the 20th century.
The conference will reveal why the romantic image of the Rajputs seduced
both the tourists of today and a British political agent almost 200
years ago. The current controversy over a Bollywood film about a Rajput
princess will be addressed.
