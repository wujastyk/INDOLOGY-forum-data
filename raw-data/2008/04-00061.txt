Subject: INDOLOGY FAQ
Message-ID: <161227082434.23782.2346820991610736034.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

We have placed a link to the INDOLOGY FAQ on the front page of 
http://indology.info (on the left-hand side; also available directly as 
http://faq.indology.info).

At present, the FAQ has no content.  I would warmly encourage all members 
of this list to write just a few words about their particular indological 
specialities for this FAQ.

This is a chance to make some serious and trustworthy information about 
our field available publicly on the web, in a medium that is academically 
controlled and not subject to random re-writing by all and sundry.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY Committee member
