Both the P??an (Hemacandr?c?rya Jaina J??namandira ms 17472,  
paper) and the Pune (BORI ms 437 of 1892-95, paper) manuscripts of  
the ?gama?ambara (both Jain n?gar?) use this sign at the end of  
the acts and as well as at the end of the play. You can find a  
description of these manuscripts here:

Religion, Introduction)

Best wishes,
Csaba
