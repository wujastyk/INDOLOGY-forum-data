... I forgot to mention that "GRETIL Books" is envisaged as an indological
(etc.) version of "Google Books" PLUS "Google Scholar", i.e., electronic
copies of articles etc. would also be included.
 
Best,

Peter and I we've talked about that as always there is a lack
of a sufficient bibliographical database scheme. Indeed it is planned
to create such a thing in SQL in the middle term, which would be useful
for a register of online material also.

Maybe it would be an idea to decrease the level of proper bibliographical
registering as far as such a simple list is concerned, and certainly to get
such
a thing running very quick and easy based on independend html stored
somewhere else.

But on the other side because of the very very poor efforts of the Google
and other guys for adequate and even correct description of the items
they have to be examinded before getting on such a list and a full
comprehensive bibliographical record has to be included indeed which would
make a relational database system to be prefered.
