It is perhaps worth remarking that the practice of suttee appears to  
be very old in South India.  There are poems in the Purananuru (1-3  
Cent CE) suggesting that a wife would take her own life (it is not  
specified how) and then her bones would join those of her husband in a  
pot.  Pots have been found dating to the first millennium BC that  
contain the bones of more than one person -- though as far as I know  
no one has looked to see if they evidence suttee.  There are two poems  
describing a widow going into a fire -- an event that came to be  
called tii kuLittal, "bathing in fire."  As far as I know, there is no  
word generally used in Tamil for such women, and I am not sure satii  
is used commonly in Sanskrit either.  George Hart
