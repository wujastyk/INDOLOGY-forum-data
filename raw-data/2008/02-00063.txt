Yes it's true that the original BNF Gallica interface is a little
rudimentary. Still, it was only a start and better interfaces are here
already. You might like to compare the Gallica and Persee versions of
the Bulletin de l?Ecole fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient. Links to both
versions can be found here:

In my opinion the Persee interface is marvellous -- just click on a 
page image and see what happens -- and their coverage is simply
wonderful: 1901[1]?2003[90-91].


BTW a number of other journals of possible interest have recently been
added to Persee:

1./ Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales

 http://tabulae.indica-et-buddhica.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=375

2./ L?Homme. Revue fran?aise d?anthropologie

 http://tabulae.indica-et-buddhica.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=374

3./ Cahiers de Linguistique ? Asie Orientale

 http://tabulae.indica-et-buddhica.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=373


Hopefully this is an indication of more to come. Certainly it all looks
more hopeful than the closed subscription-only archives to have arisen
of late in other parts of the world. The following indicates some of
the changes afoot.
