Dear Indology Listserv,

I am sending this message on behalf of a graduate student currently
not active on Indology, please respond to him directly if you have
any suggestions:

Dear Indologists,

Do any of you know of any scholarship on Leather-working in India? Or
perhaps Dalit artifact production more generally?

I am a PhD Student in Ethnomusicology at NYU currently proposing my
dissertation on tabla makers in Varanasi.  I am looking for
background material and any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Allen Roda
