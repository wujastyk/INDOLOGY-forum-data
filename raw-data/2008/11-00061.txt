Ashok,

Actually, it would depend, though I suspect the Rtam issue you mention 
would not have the virama/halanta (a superscript crescent in Malayalam). 
Old Malayalam script would have rendered it without any such marker, but 
some (slightly strange) new script forms will render it with this 
crescent. For what it's worth, I think the proper LC transliteration for 
both would be:

Old: k??uv?y?r, koTuvAyUr
New: k??uv?y?r? , koTuvAyuru

Hope that makes things clear.

Best, Don
