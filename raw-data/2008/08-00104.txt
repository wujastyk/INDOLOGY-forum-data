I stated that the word kadamba occurs 3 times in the GItagovinda.   
However, it means tree in only one instance, viz. in song 5.7: vixada- 
kadamba-tale militam ....harim... smarati mano mama. I suppose that  
the qualifying adjective vizada makes it into a tree with white flowers.
In the other two instances (5.3 and 22.2) kadamba means 'mass,  
multitude' and is simply a pluralizer (see my book Le GItagovinda.  
Tradition et innovation dans le kAvya, Stockholm 1977, p. 29).
Sorry to have been sloppy in the first place.
Best
