Subject: [Fwd: "Ten pomegranates" in Dharmakirti's Pramanavarttika]
Message-ID: <161227083106.23782.3170341339814233614.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Friends,

I received the following query last month, but am unable to come up with 
anything to help this very worthy person with their uncertainty.

Does any of this ring a bell to anyone else on the list? I will pass on 
any replies to the person who sent the question.

Thanks,

Christian

I am writing with regard to a passing reference in Dharmak?rti's 
/Pram??avarttika /to what may be a Vedic ritual. In his commentary to a 
verse on the subject of /?ptav?da? /he makes the remark: "statements 
like the one containing the words 'ten pomegranates'" 
(/da?ad??im?div?ky?ni/)/. /A subcommentary by Kar?akagom? provides a 
fuller description of the reference: ?the phrase ?ten pomegranates, 
etc.? is such statements as ?ten pomegranates, six cakes, a bowl, a goat 
skin, and straw (?)? (S: /da?a d??imety?di da?a d??im?ni ?adp?p?? ku??am 
aj?jina? palalam ityevam ?d?ni v?ky?ni/). Still, neither writer 
identifies the source or meaning of this reference. The passage is cited 
as an example of statements that lack "consistency" (/asambandha//?/) or 
"coherence" (/anupasa?h?ra?/). One further piece of the puzzle is a 
Tibetan translation of a verse that appears in a commentary by a later 
Indian Buddhist scholar named ??ntarak?ita which also mentions this "ten 
pomegranates" passage. Although the exact meaning of the end of the 
verse is uncertain it may contain a reference to a type of ritual called 
/sparakratu /(The Tibetan contains what seems to be a transliteration of 
the Sanskrit words but is probably a distortion of the correct 
spelling). My best read of the line is that it says something like "the 
false daughter's (? an?taduhit?) cow, [which was the object] of a 
/sparakratu /ritual, died." It sounds like this list of items may appear 
in some Vedic ritual that is intended to save sick cows. I have 
virtually no knowledge of Vedic literature at all and cannot seem to 
locate any material that even verifies the existence of this type of 
ritual, much less provides any explanation of what it may involve.

I would very much appreciate any clarification you might be willing to 
offer.
