And the other end of the spectrum from a "gu.na of the aatman", we have 
such behaviourist expressions as "chandata.h kriyaa" (Caraka "saa.1.140), 
"doing whatever one wishes".

Or again, Su"sruta ci.29.19:

  carati amoghasa.mkalpo devavac caakhila.m jagat/

  He travels the whole world with infallible will(power), like a god.

which Cakra glosses as "anivaaryasa.mkalpa.h", suggesting that sa.mkalpa 
didn't need explanation.
