The article by Vaclav Blazek has already been published in the  
Journal of ASLIP, see <http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ewitzel/ 
aslip.html>, Mother Tongue XI, last year.

The specialist in Australian languages, Prof. Paul Black (Darwin,  
Australia), who attended the Oct 2006 conference, said this was the  
first attempt that convinced him of an Australian substrate in India.
