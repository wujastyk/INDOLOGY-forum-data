"In the study of Asian incunabula, we usually cite a leporello as an  "accordion-fold" book."

A search of the Library of Congress database seems to indicate that this phrase is the overwhelming favorite for online cataloging in accordance with AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2).  I am checking with the cataloging authorities here about whether this is a rule or just a prevailing practice.  I need to know because we are trying to get a number of Burmese and Shan and one or two Nepalese books in this format cataloged.
