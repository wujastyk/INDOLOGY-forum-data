Subject: Matsunami Seiren, Saundarananda edition
Message-ID: <161227083897.23782.1506413442686998967.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear all,

I was wondering whether anybody has access to Matsunami Seiren's 1981 
edition of A?vagho?a's Saundarananda and could let me know whether it is 
worthwhile consulting in addition to Johnston.

This is the bibliographical data:

?? [Matsunami], ?? [Seiren]: "???????? {Memyo: Tanseinaru 
Nanda; *A?vagho?a's Saundarananda}" Tokyo: ?????? [Sankib? 
Busshorin] (1981).

GRETIL's e-text of the SN is based on this edition 
(http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/2_kavya/asvsaunu.htm). 
A first comparison between this electronic version and Johnston yielded 
some differences that seemed odd and might be input errors.

In any case, I would welcome more information on Matunami's edition, the 
material on which it is based, and, if it is a substantial improvement 
over Johnston, how to get access to a copy. It appears that no European 
library whose catalogue is accessible via the Karlsruhe virtual 
catalogue (http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/hylib/en/kvk.html) has it ...

A further item of interest is this article:

?? [Matsunami], ?? [Seiren]: "???????????? {Yugagyoha no 
so toshite no memy?; *A?vagho?a as a forefather (?) of Yog?c?ra}." ?? 
??????. ???????? [Taish?daigakukenky?kiy? - bungakubu - 
bukky?gakubu] 39 (1954), 191-224.

If anyone has a copy, I would appreciate one :-)

Thank you, and best regards,

Birgit Kellner
