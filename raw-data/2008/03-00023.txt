The Centre is the world's largest research institute devoted to the study

approximately ?19,500 plus the payment of home fees. Applications to study 
full or part time without a scholarship are also welcome. The deadline for 
the application is 15 May 2008. Interviews will be held in June. For

This may not seem particularly indological, but the course offers 
possibilities for the serious study of ayurveda, including doing an MA 
thesis that could make use of original sources in the Asian languages 
supported by scholars at the Centre, that include Sanskrit, Arabic, Urdu, 
Chinese, and Tamil.
