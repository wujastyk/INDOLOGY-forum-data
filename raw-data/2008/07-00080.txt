Like Ashok and Madhav, my experience is that amongst ordinary folk in 
India there is a clear idea that homoeopathy is distinct from ayurveda 
etc.

The Indian Govt's website is clear on the distinction:

There's some excellent academic writing on homoeopathy in India, and some 
current projects.  A sophisticated piece by Harish Naraindas comes to 
mind, but I can't recall the details now.
