Dear Fred,

Perhaps relevant is D. Schlingloff, "Menschenopfer in Kausambi?", IIJ 11 
(1968-9):175-89.

Thanks to Allen, Bob T, Axel, Ashok and others for answering my query. It 
seems that the evidence beyond what might be speculated from the buried 
heads beneath the agnicayana altar is sketchy and without much (if any) 
textual basis.

regards
Fred Smith

I don't know if it's pertinent, but there is a custom in the US, among 
people having difficulty sellling a house, of burying a statue of St. Joseph 
upside down in the yard until it's sold.  This is not confined to Catholics. 
A lot of Catholic goods stores have stopped selling statues of him, instead 
offering pictures only, on the grounds it's superstitious and irreverent. 
I'm waiting for a fresh rash of articles on it with the current real estate 
crisis.

One is, of course, supposed to dig the statue up when the house is sold.

I have not come across any references to this before this generation.  Nor 
has Snopes.com been able to find any: <
