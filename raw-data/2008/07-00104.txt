Talbot Mundy's name is synonymous with fantastic adventure in the mysterious east. When Fox brought his most famous novel to the screen a second time, it was transformed into a widescreen Tyrone Power vehicle infused with a social consciousness story set against the Sepoy rebellion of 1857. Yet the film also resembled plans for a film Mundy had hoped to script in the 1930's which ran into prohibitive British censorship. King of the Khyber Rifles inaugurated a cycle of colonial adventure films with a revisionist interpretation of the imperialist ethic that Hollywood had celebrated in earlier decades. This screening will feature a special introduction by MBRS Library staffer Brian Taves (PhD, University of Southern California), author of a new book on Mundy.
