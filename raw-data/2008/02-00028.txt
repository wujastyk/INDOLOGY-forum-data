Thank you very much, dear Andrea Schlosser,
for what indeed seems to point to the author of 
the reconstructed part given by Schotsman and in 
the electronic version by the Sanskrit Buddhist 
Input Project. This Chaudharii's edition 
(A/svagho.sa-k.rta Buddhacaritam, with Hindi 
Translation - I have not it at hand) appears to 
have been reprinted several times in India (1953, 
1955, etc.), even very recently, which, due to 
such a popularity, may explain how its 
reconstructed text has been reproduced at least 
twice. Maybe somebody else could tell us if the 
pandit Suryanaaraaya.na Chaudharii was a Tibetan 
scholar, or was simply relying on Johnston's 
translation.
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle

Yes, that I know, but the reconstructed text I am 
referring here is not at all the Am.rtaananda's 
one (about whom, cf. also C. Vogel, IIJ 14, 1972, 
pp. 214-217) included by S. L?vi and E.B. Cowell 
in their respective editions. I am talking here 
about the reconstructed text which has been made 
by "someone" on the basis of Johnston's work and 
the Tibetan version.
