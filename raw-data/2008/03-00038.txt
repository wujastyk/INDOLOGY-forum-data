I have paged that vol. from remote storage.  Could Prof. 
Arganis-Juarez please  send me his snailmail address off the list?

There seems to be some trouble getting the journal Jhankara, though we theoretically still have a subscription.  I have asked our New Delhi office to investigate.

The relevant Jha?kara reference is:

Kailasa Candra Dasa, "Vai??ava Lilam?ta: eka  
d???ipata", Jha?kara (44sa var?a, 9ma sa?khya)  
?isembara 1992, pp. 815-825

(By the way, since this review does occasionally seem to carry  
significant articles, it would be most commendable if the LC tried to  
extend its run beyond 1996.)
