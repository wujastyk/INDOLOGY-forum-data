Dear colleagues,

Many of you will probably have received my booklet "Haribhatta in Nepal"
from the International Institute for Buddhist Studies, Tokyo. I would
like to draw your attention to a list of corrections that can be
downloaded as pdf file from my home page:

URL: staff-www.uni-marburg.de/~hahnm 

Please go to Publications, then Bibliography of separately published
works, then No. 16.
