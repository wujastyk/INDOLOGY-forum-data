Dear Stephen Hodge,

I'm on my way to the office and will be happy to send you a scan
of the required Udanavarga pages later today. -- Concerning
disappearing books, that isn't really much of a problem here
(public university library, open access to anybody, but they do
have tags in all books and beeping gates at the exit.)

All best,
Stefan Baums
