Dear all,

I have come across a rather odd example, used in at least three texts to my 
knowledge (Mah?bherik?hara-s?tra, ?ura?gama-sam?dhi-s?tra and 
Mah?-parinirv??a-s?tra). With slight variances, the basic outline of the 
example is that there exists an extremely potent drug which is smeared on 
the tops of drums. Then, when these drums are beaten, arrows and so forth 
spontaneously extract themselves from wounds suffered in battles, even at a 
considerable distance. My query is i) has anybody come across this same 
example elsewhere in Buddhist materials, and ii) is it known in the wider 
Indian literature ? It seems such an implausible feat, I would like to know 
if there is any detailed story concerning this anywhere.
Best wishes,

Stephen Hodge
