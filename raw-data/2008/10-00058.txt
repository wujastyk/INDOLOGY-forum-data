Professor Kim Juwon from the Seoul National University has sent me a  
sample of a dhaaraNii text printed in Korea in the 18th century,  
asking for help in identifying the script and transcribing parts of  
the text. This is not my field of expertise, and I cannot easily do  
what he asks, but I trust there are members of the Indology list who  
can fairly easily read this siddham script and identify the text --  
may I ask for your help? Thanks to Dominik Wujastyk and Richard  
Mahoney for mounting the sample on the indology.info server:
