Dear Friends,

I recently received the following news from Abhishek Jain, of Motilal 
Banarsidass Publishers:

    my  uncle, Mr Rajeev Jain met with a serious accident & was in the
    hospital for nearly 2 months. There was brain injury & a couple of
    fractures on his body as well. He was discharged from the hospital
    day before yesterday [21 August]. Due to god's grace, he is out of
    danger & his health is stable & he is also recovering.

I think many, if not most, of us know Rajiv Jain, admire his warmth and 
generosity of spirit, and benefit from the ongoing work of and his 
family's old and esteemed publishing house. (How many of our students 
would have copies of Monier-Williams were it not for Motilal Banarsidass?)

I recently sent him a "get well soon" card, and I'm sure it would be 
appreciated if his many other friends and acquaintances in the field of 
Indology were to write with their best wishes. Cards may be sent care of 
Abhishek Jain, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (P) Ltd., A-44, Naraina 
Industrial Area, Phase - 1, New Delhi-110 028, India.

Sincerely,

Christian Wedemeyer
