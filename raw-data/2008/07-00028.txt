Dear List members,

Can anyone suggest some good general reading material on the phenomenon of
metathesis in inscriptions and manuscripts. I have read some material
written on Gandharan sources, but am currently working with proto-Bengali
Sanskrit. I would be most appreciative for any help!

Thanks much,

Benjamin Fleming
