I've just been on the phone about Maurer's book to

Dorothea Schaefter
Associate Editor, Central Asia, South Asia, Asian Religion
at Routledge Asian Studies,
email: dorothea.schaefter at tandf.co.uk

Ms Schaefter was sympathetic to the issue of price, and said that 
Routledge has been increasingly using "Print-on-Demand" for certain 
categories of books.  This means that the book is no longer sold through 
bookshops, but has to be ordered directly from Routledge.  On receipt of 
an order, Routledge prints a paperback copy of the book and sends it out. 
It takes about 72 hours.  Price ?20.

I asked Ms Schaefter whether it would be ?20 per volume or ?20 for the 
book as a whole, and she couldn't answer that without internal 
consultation at Routledge.

See
   http://www.routledgepaperbacksdirect.com/
for how they do it.

Ms Schaefter said she would be glad to look into the possibility of the 
Maurer book being added to the print-on-demand scheme.  This depends on 
discussions within Routledge, and the expected assessment of likely sales.

If you have an opinion on this matter, please send a note to Ms Schaefter 
(dorothea.schaefter at tandf.co.uk).  If you think you might use Maurer's 
book for your Sanskrit courses, be as specific as is possible about the 
numbers of copies that might be bought each year.  But even if you can't 
be specific, please write if you would use even some copies, or would 
recommend it for students at your university.

  Best,
Dominik
