May I mention, in connection with this and previous messages, an old article 
in which I addressed these issues, albeit in a summary and preliminary 
fashion? --


"Linguistic Variability in Sanskrit," in Colette Caillat, ed., Dialectes

Linguistics (with a staff inspired by Christianity, noting for each language
when the first bible translation was made: for Sanskrit this was 1822)
registers a "population" (sic) of 6106 speakers (based on the 1981 census)

rate in second language: 15% to 25% literate.)
