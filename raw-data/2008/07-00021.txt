Hi Richard,

    Thanks for making available this version of the MW HTML.  As I downloaded and looked at it, I see that the main word entrees are in Harvard-Kyoto notation while the names of cited texts appear in full diacritics (utf8?).  Is that by design?  Best,

Madhav M. Deshpande

Dear Colleagues,

The first release candidate for the new HTML version of Monier-Williams
Sanskrit-English Dictionary is now available:

 Indica et Buddhica - Repositorium
 http://repositorium.indica-et-buddhica.org/

This represents a complete rewrite based on the most recent version of
the Cologne source file (`MONIER2008' -- download from here:
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/download.html). All users of
previous versions are encouraged to upgrade.

The dictionary marked up in HTML (`XHTML 1.0 Strict') can be found in
the zip archive `mw_html_rc1.zip'. Installation instructions can be
found in the `README.TXT' file.

As usual, comments and corrections are most welcome. They should be
mailed to me or entered in this form, whatever is convenient:

 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/sections/about-ieb/contact-form 

A final release will be made once I have had a chance to incorporate
suggestions.


Best regards,

 Richard Mahoney


P.S. I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dr Thomas Malten for
kindly permitting a new release of the HTML version based on the most
recent version of the Cologne source.
