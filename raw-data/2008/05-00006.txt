Subject: Mahabhasya now available in Intratext version
Message-ID: <161227082534.23782.1068727533682817529.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks to the staff and funding at the intratext.com project, and to the 
original data-analysis and data-entry project under Prof. Cardona, the 
Mahabhasya of Patanjali is now available with the Intratext coding:

   http://www.intratext.com/ixt/san0011/_INDEX.HTM

This makes the generation of KWIC indexes trivially easy, as well as 
providing various statistical and lexical analyses of the text.

Best,
