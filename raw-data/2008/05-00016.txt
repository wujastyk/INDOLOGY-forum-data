Hi Dominik,

I tried setting the character-encoding to UTF-8 on Firefox and Opera, the two browsers I have on my Mac, but it does not seem to be doing the trick on either browser.  Must be something else I need to do.

I don't know what browswer you are using, but if it's Firefox, then you 
would go to "View/Character encoding" and set it to UTF-8 (i.e., unicode). 
That should do the trick.

Best,
Dominik
