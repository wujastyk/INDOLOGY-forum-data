a vast variety of different forms. From ancient painting and sculpture, via shadow puppetry, dances, vast 

community plays and mask drama, to contemporary shrines, calendars and diwali effigies. To these one could 

add an ever growing catalogue of TV series, films and cartoons. 

 

Visualising The Ramayana is a day of presentations and discussions exploring some of this remarkable richness 

that flourishes across Asia to this day. 

 

This event is a part of the programme accompanying The Ramayana - Love and Valour in India's Great Epic, 

a major free exhibition at the British Library, until 14 September 2008. For more information please visit
