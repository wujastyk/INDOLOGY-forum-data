The fourth annual Sanskrit conference will meet on Friday, the 9th of May, 2008 in the Faculty of Religious Studies at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. 

The aim of this conference is to promote daily as well as the scholarly use of Sanskrit. Participants are therefore invited to make their presentation in Sanskrit on any topic of their choice. Past presentations have included poems, skits, stories and political comment, along with scholarly papers. Those interested in scholarly presentations may focus on any aspect of Indian religion and culture. 

Presentations should not exceed twenty minutes; scholarly presentations will be followed by a 10 minute question-answer session.

The conference was inaugurated on 4 May 2005 with the aim of promoting the use of Sanskrit as a living language. It is intended to serve as a forum in which various aspects of Indian religious and cultural traditions can be discussed in what has been the primary language of internal communication within the multi-lingual Hindu community until very recent times, and provide an intellectual atmosphere in which modern and traditional scholarship may be studied. It has already attracted participants from India, America, and Canada.
