Subject: new INDOLOGY FAQ
Message-ID: <161227081941.23782.3573355010579990802.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The INDOLOGY website, http://indology.info, now has a new section for 
Frequently Asked Questions.  The address is

   http://faq.indology.info

At present, this new website has no content.  The concept is that members 
of this INDOLOGY list may, if they wish, write about their areas of 
expertise in the FAQ.  As a preliminary aid, the section headings of 
Bechert and von Simson's 1979 book "Einfuehrung in die Indologie" have 
been provided as an initial structure.  This is of course not set in 
stone.

The INDOLOGY FAQ can be read by anyone on the internet.

We hope that a useful series of focussed, academic-yet-accessible articles 
may gradually accumulate that can form a reference point for indological 
enquiries and orientation.

Some areas of Indology are polemical.  We would encourage FAQ entries on 
these topics, but of course they should be balanced and appropriately 
referenced to the scholarly literature.  The fact that a topic is 
polemical should itself be clearly noted, and a dispassionate and 
objective tone be adopted.

The FAQ can be accessed for writing and editing only through a password 
login, and such permission will only be given to members of the INDOLOGY 
discussion forum, i.e., people who have agreed to abide by the scope and 
guidelines of the list, and who are active university-level scholars 
(according to the INDOLOGY constitution, at 
http://indology.info/email/email-const.shtml).

If you wish to have write-access to the INDOLOGY FAQ, please send a 
request to the INDOLOGY Committee at the usual address:

   indologycommittee at liverpool.ac.uk
