Translation has, no doubt, been a powerful force throughout human
history for as long as it has been practiced. It has allowed scientific,
technological, linguistic and literary forms of knowledge to spread
across vast geographical and cultural distance. One of the realms in
which the force of translation is most evident historically is religion:
translations of scripture have initiated and sustained the spread of
religions far from their place of origin, in the process altering
societies' ways of life and understanding of the human and divine. 

For many years translation was relegated to the margins of academic
discourse just as translators' names were barely visible within the
pages of the books they translated. Translation was often viewed as a
technical act of transformation, a necessary step on a text's path to a
new language and a new market. Gradually, questioning such an approach
and perceiving translation as a site where issues of power, ideology,
poetics, creative expression and technique converged, scholars in the
fields of literary studies, history and religion, among others, began
examining more closely the ways in which translation has been
conceptualized and practiced throughout history.

What gets translated in a particular society, and why? Who decides, in
any given period and place, what translation entails and who carries out
those decisions? How do these parameters shift with the passage of time
within and across societies? What are the forces that encourage and
resist translation? The field of Translation Studies, which has emerged
in recent times, is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that centers
on such questions, seeking to understand translation as it was
understood and practiced in diverse, yet particular historical
circumstances.

Much progress has been attained in this field, especially in reaching a
better understanding of translation histories in Europe and America.
However, the knowledge of the theory and practice of translation in
various periods and places remains, at best, fragmented.

The histories of translation into and from many Asian languages,
although long and complex, to a large extent remain obscure. Especially
lacking is theoretical conceptualization and analysis of what, in fact,
were the dominant ideas about translation in different Asian societies,
and how these ideas were articulated, implemented, resisted and
practiced. Exploring these elements  - and additional ones - will enrich
current discussions in the fields of Translation Studies, religion,
literary studies and history, enabling us to better understand
translation movements which had profound effects but have been largely
left on the sidelines of academic scholarship.
