Dear Richard,

here is the information which was just given to me by Joachim (K. Bautze) :
Leela Shiveshwarkar, "The Pictures of the Chaurapanchasika, A Sanskrit Love 
Lyric", New Delhi: The National Museum, 1967.
(with 18 colour plates, text, transl., analysis of the paintings and a very 
long and exhaustive introduction).
