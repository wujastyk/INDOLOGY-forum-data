 From a short look on the material I have at hand
 (the two popular editions of the "devotional"
 version referred to infra, and Neve's translation
 of the possible "other" version = Jones version +
 four supplementary verses numbered 2, 5, 8, 10,
 from one Paris ms), it appears that we have
 rather here different recensions of the same text.
 See
 Jones-N?ve stanza no. 1 = Chinmaya edition no. 2 = Kodungallur edition no.
 II.1
 J-N no. 2 = Ch no. 8 = K no. II.3
 J-N no. 3 = Ch no. 11 = K no. II.4
 J-N no. 4 = Ch no. 4 = K no. II.10
 J-N no. 6 = Ch no. 12 = K no. I.2
 J-N no. 7 =  Ch no. 15 = K no. I.7
 J-N no. 8 = Ch no. 18 = K no. II.6
 J-N no. 11 = Ch no. 24 = K no. II.8
 J-N no. 12 =  Ch no. 7 = K no. I.8
 N supplementary 2 =  Ch no. 29 =  K no. II.2
 N s 5 = Ch no. 26 = K no. II.5
 N s 10 = Ch no. 5 = K no. I.4

 Hope it may help

 (Disclaimer: I don't have Mahadevan's book at
 hand, so I don't know what he says in this case.)
 There is a text different from the "Bhaja
 Govindam" hymn also called "Mohamudgara". I may
 be wrong but it seems to me that it is a more
 recent phenomenon to call "Bhaja Govindam" by
 this name, too (which is rather confusing). While
 "Bhaja Govindam" is clearly a devotional hymn
 (and longer), the "other" Mohamudgara is not
 devotional at all (shorter, but with a differing
 number of verses in the manuscripts).
