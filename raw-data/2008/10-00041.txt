Dear Lars,
I would recommend Chapter 24 of Nagarjuna's /Prajna nama 
mulamadhyamakakarika/ (sorry for omitting diacritics), where the 
Buddhist "two reality theory" is elaborated. There are many other 
sources in the Mahayana philosophical literature in Sanskrit on 
paramarthasatya and samvrtisatya. Gaudapada and Shankara also took this 
framework of more and less real realities and used it to good effect in 
their major works.
best
