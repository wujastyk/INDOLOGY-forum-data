Announcement - Florence Tan Moeson Fellowship Program

Dear Colleagues,

Following is the announcement of the Florence Tan Moeson Fellowship,
offered by the Library of Congress Asian Division.

Florence Tan Moeson Fellowship Program Announced

The Asian Division Friends Society announces the Florence Tan Moeson
Research Fellowship for 2009. This fellowship is made possible by a
generous donation of Florence Tan Moeson, for 43 years a Chinese Team
cataloger in the Regional and Cooperative Cataloging Division before
she
retired in 2001.

The purpose of the fellowship is to give individuals the opportunity
to
use the Asian collections in the Library of Congress, which are among
the
most significant outside of Asia and consist of nearly 2.8 million
books,
periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts and microforms in the languages
of
East, South and Southeast Asia.

Researchers wishing to submit applications should go to this Web site:
www.lcasianfriends.org/fellowship. The deadline for applying for the
2009
fellowship program is September 30, 2008.

The Florence Tan Moeson Research Fellowship consists of $14,000 each
year
for 10 years in support of grants for research using the Asian
Division's
Reading Room and the Library's extensive Asian collections. The grants
will be awarded upon demonstration of need. Grants are intended to pay
for
travel to and from Washington, overnight accommodations and
photocopying
fees. Graduate and upper-level undergraduate students, independent
scholars, community college teachers, researchers without regular
teaching
appointments, and librarians with a demonstrated need for fellowship
support are especially encouraged to apply.

The Library's Asian collection began in 1869 with a gift of 10 works
in
933 volumes from the emperor of China to the United States. Spanning a
diversity of subjects from China, Japan, Korea, the South Asian
subcontinent and Southeast Asia, the Library's Asian collections have
become one of the most accessible and comprehensive sources of Asian
language materials in the world.

For further information about the collection, visit the Asian
Division??s

Thank you.
