Though a definite decision cannot be taken without examining the text in more versions than one, prima facie de dang mthun pa'i rkyen might mean 'a suffix in accordance with that' ie with the desired meaning of the word. A particular suffix among many permissible ones is meant. This is necessitated by the fact that quite a few svaarthika pratyayas are mentioned by Paa.nini 5.4.5ss and also elsewhere. Here the a.(n) suffix is meant that generates maitra in the sense of mitra. This is the 'suffix in accordance'. For maitra by a svaarthika suffix the commentator seems to have the authority of Vaarttika 4 on Paa.nini 5.4.38? in?mind. The suutra speaks of amitra that can have the suffix in svaartha. The varttika authorises the operation for both?amitra ie mitra.? In order to clarify Pata;njali illustrates with the word maitra in the sense of mitra with the a(.n) suffix.
