Thanks for the heads-up on the Gita translation! I'll be sure and check 
out a copy when it comes to India.

You may have noticed this weekend Steve Farmer posted a critique on the 
new Science magazine article about the Harappans. I'll respond to some 
of his points later in the week.

Now that SCS is moribund is there anyplace else to discuss these kinds 
of issues? I miss your incisive comments.

By the way, I hope to meet up with Fred Smith in 1-2 weeks.

Best,

Dean Anderson
