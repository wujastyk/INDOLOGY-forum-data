Speaking as one of those who converted the original files to text  
files, I have realized that the GRETIL version, as well as its source  
in Osaka, do have the problem of '??' ('a' with macron and acute)  
having become simply 'a'.  I think we (or was it I?) introduced this  
error when removing accents.  The original did have the correct  
reading (with accent).  We will make an updated version ASAP.
