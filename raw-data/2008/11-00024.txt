Dear Birgit,

LOC has the Saundarananda ed. and trans., which I have requested from
remote storage, and will send you my evaluation (insofar as I can
without knowing Japanese).  We also have the journal you mention, and I
have paged that vol., though it is not clear from the online catalog if
we have that one.

The catalog records for the two titles are (dots represent Kanji):
