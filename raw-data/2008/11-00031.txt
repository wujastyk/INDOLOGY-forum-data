Dear all,

thanks to everybody who provided further information as to where 
Matunami's edition of the Saundarananda and the journal containing his 
article on A?vagho?a as forefather of Yog?c?ra could be found.

Thanks especially to the person who provided me with a PDF of the 
edition. It turns out that the edition also contains the article in 
question as an appendix.

Best regards,

Birgit Kellner
