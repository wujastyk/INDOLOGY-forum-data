Homeopathy is very well established  on the Subcontinent with over 100  
institutions granting Bachelor and Doctorate of Homeopathic Medicine  
degrees, many of whom have clinics attached (as do many Western  
(allopathic) hospitals in India, rather atypically).

The Indian homeopathic doctors I knew while living there in the mid  
1990s were very particular about distinguish their practice from that  
of allopathic doctors. Many medical professionals (trained in Western  
medicine) often prescribe homeopathic remedies for chronic conditions,  
but I am pretty sure they too are careful do distinguish homeopathy  
from other (mostly indigenous) systems of traditional medicine (e.g.,  
Ayurveda).

It's possible that some Indian physicians may use the term  
"homeopathy" in the generic sense Allan suggested. My impression is  
that most apply it only to homeopathically trained professionals.
