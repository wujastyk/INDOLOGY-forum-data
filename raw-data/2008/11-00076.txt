Dear Colleagues,

Please forgive this request, as I am sure it is one that surfaces  
every year in some form... but I think I may have a new wrinkle.

I am writing a book that is basically my dissertation that has grown  
up and wants to move on into the wide world. My dissertation was  
written in TransIndic for Mac. This font no longer exists. I need a  
transliteration font (for Sanskrit, Hindi, and Tamil) that works for  
both Mac and PC, so that I can edit, amend, expand the original text,  
which presently reads as gibberish on my MacBook Pro OSX 10.5.5.

I have looked in all the obvious places for a MAC/PC compatible font,  
but have struck out. Sorry to be such an idiot and much gratitude to  
anyone who can help me out of this pickle!!!

Many Thanks,
Mary
