Adding to Dominic's comment,

P??ini has rules regarding gemination, some of them as options in  
8.4.46 ff.  So, not all of the variations (in pronunciation and in  
orthography) that involve geminations are ungrammatical.  I think most  
of them are in fact P??inian acceptable.

This particular one, V+ttva and V+tva, is optionally allowed by 8.4.47.

Prof. Cardona had an article on nasals that explored various  
pronunciation options adopted by Vedic Pr?ti??khyas.  Is it  
published?  There, if I remember correctly, opinions of some teachers  
that prohibit certain geminations were mentioned.  Prohibition of ttva  
was one of them.

Some copyists are very strict about which options they use in writing:  
two Malayalam manuscripts I used have:

- t[y/v]a instead of tt[y/v]a to the point of utpatyabh?va? rather  
than utpattyabh?va?

- although they double t after r; thus k?rtyate rather than k?rttyate

Other copyists seem more liberal. I no more pay attention, which may  
be not a good practice, whether in a particular manuscript it is  
sattva or satva if the manuscript comes from the North.  I think it's  
rather common to see both sattva and satva in a manuscripts.

So, my point is to emphasize Dominic's conclusion:

Even according to P??ini, bodhisattva and bodhisatva can be the same  
thing.
