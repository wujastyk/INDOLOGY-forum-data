Dear colleagues,

The chair of the BASAS council has written to confirm continuing funding 
for the INDOLOGY website (http://indology.info).  He was very supportive 
of the project and impressed by the positive feedback that was gathered on 
short notice.  He called the INDOLOGY website a "magnificent 
scholarly asset," which was very kind, and hopes that hte link between 
BASAS and the INDOLOGY website remains a strong one and continues to grow.

May I offer my sincere thanks to all of you who wrote messages of support 
for the website, that I was able to forward to the BASAS council before 
their meeting.

Best,

Dominik Wujastyk
