Subject: Deciphering a Gniza fragment
Message-ID: <161227082236.23782.760320288362794355.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 Dear all,

 A colleague who is working on deciphering and cataloging 'Gniza' manuscripts at
the Cambridge University collection, is trying to decipher a manuscript fragment
of an Indian origin; specifically, he is enquiring about its approximate date,
its language and its contents. The text is quite short, and can be viewed on
the following website.

 I would be grateful for any help on this.


 Regards,
                     Ithamar
