Sorry for so many posts, but I think this may be useful to someone.

Years ago, when I was reading from Ramanuja's Sribhasya, I noticed  
that his usages often mirror the Sanskrit that is still spoken by the  
pandits in Chennai.  For example, the word "samiiciina" for "fine,"  
"good," "excellent" is used by that writer.  On the other hand,  
Sankara's Sanskrit does not seem to be connected with the Sanskrit I  
heard in Chennai -- its style and word usage is quite different.  This  
suggests that there is a continuous tradition of spoken Sanskrit that  
developed in Tamil Nadu 1000 years ago and still continues today.  The  
Sanskrit used in Kerala was probably rather different (something also  
suggested by my very superficial acquaintance with the Manipravala  
works of 4 or 500 years ago).  Certainly, in many parts of India and  
Nepal, Sanskrit has been used as a spoken language for a long time.   
It would seem that each area has developed its own style and word  
usage.  As we know, the pandits of one area often look down at the  
Sanskrit (esp. pronunciation) of pandits from other areas.

There is a wonderful sloka that can be used when teaching beginning  
Sanskrit -- but I have forgotten the details of the story that goes  
along with it.  Perhaps someone can recall it.  Someone, wanting to  
show off to Kalidasa how much Sanskrit he knew, said, "bhojanam dehi  
raajendra ghrtasuupasamanvitam."  Kalidasa is supposed to have replied  
"maahiSam ca zaraccandracandrikaadhavalam dadhi."  Of course, the  
first utterance is ungainly and awkward, while the second flows like  
moonlight.  The dhvani, according to my pandit, is that Kalidasa is  
implying that the would-be Sanskrit speaker is stupid and slow, as  
buffalo yogurt is supposed to dull the mind.
