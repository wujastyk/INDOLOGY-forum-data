Dear Stella,

> Latin sinistra seems to have the same connotations.

yes, and so does the other Latin word for ?left?: laevus (but
apparently in augury it means ?favorable?). Multiple layers of
taboo replacement ? further to French gauche, Spanish izquierdo,
but Italian still sinistro.

To complement Peter?s reference to Gonda on dak?i?a, here is one
on v?ma:

   Manfred Mayrhofer, 1968. Zu altindisch v?ma? ?link?. Die
   Sprache 14: 160.

Incidentally, in the G?ndh?r? commentary that I am editing, v?ma
is contrasted with anuloma (and thus apparently equivalent to
pratiloma):

   a?ulomo pa?icasamupado ? vamo pusuja?apak?o

All best,
Stefan
