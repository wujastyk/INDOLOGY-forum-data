Dear colleague,

Information on the identities of the kaara.n.dava and cakravaaka is 
available in my "A history of Indian medical literature", vol. IB, p.43, 
n.588 and p.46--47, n.611.

Dave (299--301) identifies it as the coot. The Caraka translations of  the 
Gulabkunverba team and by R.K. Sharma and Bhagwan Dash simply say goose 
without any specification. P.V. Sharma's translation has white-fronted 
goose; the same name is employed by P. Ray and H.N. Gupta in their Caraka 
Sa.mhitaa (A scientific synopsis).
The white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons albifrons (Scopoli), however, is 
described as a sparse and rare winter visitor in northwest and northern 
India by S. Ali and S.D. Ripley in their "Handbook of the birds of India and 
Pakistan" (I, 126--128).

All the sources mentioned on kaara.n.dava agree that the cakravaaka is the 
ruddy sheldrake, Tadorna ferruginea (Pallas), described in vol. 1, 141--144 
of the work by S. Ali and S.D. Ripley.

Caraka regards the two birds as distinct.

With best wishes and regards,
