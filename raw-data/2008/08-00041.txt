Friends:
 
I am working on arches in Indian designs and forms.
 
Very often Indian artists and artisans create arches even in a two dimensional design to enclose the main form. 
 
Are these arches a variation of toranas or festoons or gateways?
 
I would love hearing from scholars who have thought about this.
 
Regards.
