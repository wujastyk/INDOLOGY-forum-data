Dominik and all,

I don't see why not--try hiring someone in the U.S. who is not a 
citizen--one has to jump through procedural hoops; and Canada job notices 
specify that Canadians will have priority.  It is contradictory to the 
idea of a world of universal scholarship, but this is, after all, the 
Kaliyug.
