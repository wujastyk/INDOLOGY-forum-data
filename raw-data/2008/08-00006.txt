Dear Professor Rocher,

> an early article by Richard Salomon titled "An ancient 
> diplomatic dispute"

the reference for this article is:

    Richard Salomon, 1987. An ancient Indian diplomatic dispute.
   In: Festschrift for Professor Ludo Rocher. Madras: Adyar
   Library and Research Centre, pp. 71?79.

(Unfortunately, the book seems to be neither in the Unversity of 
Washington nor Harvard libraries, and as you note Rich is out of 
town. But I will make sure to ask and make a copy when we are both 
back in Seattle later this summer ? unless you return from the 
mountains first.)

All best wishes,
Stefan Baums
