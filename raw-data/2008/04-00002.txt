<http://asianstudies.anu.edu.au/Image:Sadananda_1.jpg>Following the 
great success of the First Australian *Spoken Sanskrit Summer School* in 
2006, Pandit Dr Sadananda Das of the University of Leipzig has kindly 
agreed to return to Australia to teach a second summer school. We are 
holding a two-week intensive residential course in the magnificent 
setting of the University?s coastal campus at Kioloa, NSW. The course 
will cater both for graduates of Dr Das? earlier courses and for those 
with no previous experience of Spoken Sanskrit. The course will further 
students? ability to converse in Sanskrit. Students familiar with Dr 
Das? student-focussed learning philosophy will look forward to more 
verses, song, role-play and drama. The course will be fully catered, and 
morning and evening meditation sessions will be available.
