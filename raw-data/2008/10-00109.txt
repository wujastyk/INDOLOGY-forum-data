Dear Dominik,

Thank you very much for following up on this. I am very pleased to tell 
you that a new-in-paperback edition of "The Sanskrit Language" is 
currently in production. We anticipate a publication date of 1st February 
2009, and the price will be ?35 for both volumes (the book will be 
published in one volume; the ISBN is 978-0-415-49143-3).

I would be grateful if you could advertise the book on the Indology 
discussion group. Should you require further information, please do not 
hesitate to contact my colleague in Marketing, Nasreen Arain 
<nasreen.arain at tandf.co.uk>.

With best wishes,
Dorothea
