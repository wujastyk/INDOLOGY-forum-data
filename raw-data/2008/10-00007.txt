This is one of the attractions of working with South Asia, that there is always something popping up to study that no one else knows anything about.  I've discussed with with many colleagues and they agree.   On the other hand some scholars of the Greek or Latin classics or of particular countries in Southeast Asia (any other areas??) like the idea that in an industrious lifetime they can more or less read everything.
