The Ramayana in Kathakali Dance Theatre: A Lecture Demonstration 

Kalamandalam Vijayakumar and Kalamandalam Barbara Vijayakumar 

Kathakali is a classical dance drama - largely of stories from Mahabharatha and the Ramayana - 

that originated in the Hindu temples of Kerela, South India, over 500 years ago. The form is 

renowned for its spectacular costumes, vivid make-up, dramatic dance and evocative live music . 

 

Kalamandalam Vijayakumar and Kalamandalam Barbara Vijayakumar founded The Kala Chethena 

Kathakali Company in Kerela in 1987. They now have their base in Britain, but regularly arrange 

tours by the company, which includes some of the most outstanding artists in India. Among them 

is the great Kathakali master Kalamandalam Gopi, who will be part of the Autumn 2008 UK tour.

ADDITIONAL EVENING EVENT

Screening of 'Sita Sings the Blues' 

(Nina Paley, USA, 2008, 82 mins) 

 

Sita is a goddess separated from her beloved Lord and husband Rama. Nina is an animator 

whose husband moves to India, then dumps her by email. Three hilarious shadow puppets narrate 

both ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this dazzlingly animated new interpretation of the 

Ramayana. Set to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw, Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline 

as 'the greatest break-up story ever told'. www.sitasingstheblues.com 

 

Directed, written, produced, designed and animated by Nina Paley, who will introduce 

the screening. 

 

Nina Paley is a longtime veteran of syndicated comic strips in the US, creating Fluff, The Hots and 

Nina's Adventures. In 1998 she began making independent animated festival films, including the 

controversial yet popular environmental short, The Stork. In 2002 Nina followed her then-husband 

to Trivandrum, India, where she read her first Ramayana. This inspired her first feature, Sita Sings 

the Blues, which she animated and produced single-handedly over five years. Nina teaches at 

Parsons School of Design in Manhattan and is a 2006 Guggenheim Fellow
