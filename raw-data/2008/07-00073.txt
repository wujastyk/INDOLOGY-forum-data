Subject: "homeopathy" in India
Message-ID: <161227082977.23782.2885565093284691173.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Do other people share my impression that while South Asia indeed has many practitioners of homeopathy in the strict sense, the system of medicine created by Samuel Hahnemann and introduced to India by John Martin Honigberger, "homeopathy" is often used there to mean any system of medicine except mainline modern Western medicine?  (All reservations on these three adjectives understood, of course!)

I do not find any such extended use of the term in online dictionaries or the old Webster's 2nd International.
