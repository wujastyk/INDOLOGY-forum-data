Stefan,

I did look at mAtrA counts but found that 

"mAtrA value does not does not seem to be a determining factor, for although there are examples of sequences which conform to the WSP and which also conform to a possible ?waxing mAtrA value principle? (e.g. sukha-dukkha, 2+2 syllables, 2+3 mAtrAs; kesa-massu, 2+2 syll., 3+3 mAtrAs) there are many examples which conform to the WSP but whose mAtrA values are erratic. For example, mUla-phala (2+2 syll., but 3+2 mAtrAs); lAbha-sakkAra-siloka (2+3+3 syll., but 3+5+4 mAtrAs)." (p. 194).

I meant to add in my previous email that the WSP is applied to the ordering of all sequences of similar word elements in prose texts (strings of adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.), not just to the components of dvandvas.

Regards
Mark
