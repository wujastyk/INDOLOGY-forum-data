Dear Daniel Stender,

it must be a Batak ms. - cf. these samples:

I would suggest to contact dr. Uli Kozok (kozok at hawaii.edu), one of the best experts in Sumatran mss.

Regards,

Andrea Acri

Michael Herkenhoff from the Manuscript Department of the University
Library in Bonn asked me for help finding someone who can give information
about a recently obtained manuscript from Indonesia. Maybe there
is a scholar on the list who can identify script, language, text etc., or
knows somebody who does.

Here are pictures of the first and the last two pages:
