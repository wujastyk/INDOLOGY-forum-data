Of course, the spoken Sanskrit courses which serve as introduction to the 
great language and which are mainly aimed to disprove the critics that 
Sanskrit was not and is never a spoken language should lead the learners to 
study the vast corpus of classical texts.
But, the 'agenda' of the so called Hindutvavadi is not to 'demolish mosques 
or to rape nuns'. With all their obvious mistakes in some of their views 
they can not be outrightly condemned and they never resort to such demeaning 
acts.
It is so strange that even after such horrific and barbaric terrorist acts 
being perpetrated in Kashmir still the Hindutvavadi is condemned for those 
crimes ('demolishing mosques or raping nuns') with which he has been proved 
subsequently to be not at all associated. !!
