The ritual tradition of the Atharvaveda makes use of a fundamental  
trifurcation in all rituals, between

1) an invariable first phase called puurvatantra
2) a variable phase comporting a specific homa
3) an invariable final phase called UTTARATANTRA

See the scheme on pp. VI-VII of Caland's Altindische Zauberritual.  
The scheme is already implied in the oldest ritual Suutra of this  
tradition, the Kau;sikasuutra, which is likely to be older than the  
mentioned medical texts, but in this meaning the word uttaratantra  
itself apparently first occurs in a few Atharvavedapari;si.s.tas  
(which are very hard to date but almost certainly, for the most part,  
too late to be relevant for Stephen Hodge's Buddhist texts).

If you take a representative batch of e-texts from GRETIL, make sure  
to include "Kausikapaddhati, by Kesava" in it, and then do a multi- 
file search for "ttaratantr", it will become evident how important  
this term is in Atharvavedic ritualism (other Atharvavedic paddhati's  
give similarly high numbers of occurrences).
