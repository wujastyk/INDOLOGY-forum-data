Dear members of the list,

on behalf of a colleague who does not have access to Indology, I would like
post this query:

******************

Dear Members of the List,

I am looking for a reference from early Indian culture, about a 
mythological figure who drives a chariot drawn by antelopes. It 
probably figures in the Mahabharata. Can you help me find this 
reference and possibly notify me about additional literature written 
on this subject?

I would be most obliged.

Thank you all in advance,

Sarolta Tat?r
