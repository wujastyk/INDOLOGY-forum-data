Dear Jennifer,

not an article but an ancient treatise: Ksemendras Suvrttatilaka  
(edited in the Kavyamala series and in Ksemendralaghukavyasangraha,  
Hyderabad, 1961; translated and discussed by Suryakanta, Ksemendra  
Studies, Poona 1954) deals exactly with this topic. Also, you could  
consult Sheldon Pollock, Aspects of Versification in Sanskrit Lyrical  
Poetry, New Haven 1977.
Perhaps it helps.

Martin Straube.
