Subject: Did Emeneau make plans for a DED3? (Re: Sanskrit and Tamil              question

Shortly after Emeneau's death, Bill Bright (sadly, since deceased)  
made arrangements to go to Emeneau's house to look over his papers and  
books.  I went with him and brought a high-speed scanning device to  
make copies of any important papers we might find.  We did find a  
treasure-trove of books, which were sent to Berkeley's Linguistics and  
South Asian library, depending on content -- Bill recorded every  
book.  To our surprise, we did not find any papers at all, and the  
scanner went unused.  Emeneau never in my hearing mentioned a third  
edition of DED.  It was quite moving to see the humble surroundings in  
which the great scholar had lived since he came to Berkeley in the  
30's -- his house, in poor repair, was quite small.  He lived there  
alone until his death at the age of 101.  His mind was clear until the  
end, and he apparently died in his sleep.  One can only marvel at the  
quantity and quality of what he produced without ever once having used  
a computer.  George Hart
