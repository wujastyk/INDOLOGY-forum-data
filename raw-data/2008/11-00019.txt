Subject: Number of official languages of India
Message-ID: <161227083889.23782.11046598613453398980.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the list,

I was wondering about the current number of the official languages of  
India.  A search among some official web sites seems to
indicate that there are 22 languages, however there are more than few
resources that name only 15. Can any one shed light on this recurrent
discrepancy ?
Thanks,
Roy Tzohar
