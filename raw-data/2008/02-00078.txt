Dear Indologists,

I'm in need of suggestions for introductory readings on Rasa. It is for
a philosopher with a research project in aesthetics but who has no
knowledge of classical Indian languages.

I would be most grateful for references to authoritative introductory
survey material dealing with Rasa (particularly theoretical material),
and any English translations of important texts on the topic.

Many thanks!
