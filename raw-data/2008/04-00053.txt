Have a look at Michel Strickmann, "Mantras et mandarins, Le bouddhisme 
tantrique en Chine", Paris: NRF/?ditions Gallimard, 1996, pp. 182-3 quoting 
a South Indian source of the 9th - 10th c., after Paul Mus ("La tombe 
vivante...."  quoted in Strickman, p. 450 note 31); see the same p. 353 with 
reference to burying "five treasues and five cereals" in the preparation of 
the homa.

Does anyone know if there is a history of burying statues or any other sorts 
of images in the ground for apotropaic or prophylactic purposes. I came 
across references to burying images of Demeter and other goddesses in the 
Greek (and Roman) world, and wonder if there is any such parallel phenomenon 
in India or Southeast Asia. It seems to me that I have read about this 
somewhere, but can't recall where.
