Dear Jennifer,

you may probably get the book via interlibrary loan. The details are:

Suuryakaanta: K.semendra Studies. Together with an English Translation  
of his Kavika.n.thaabhara.na, Aucityavicaaracarcaa and Suv.rttatilaka.  
Poona 1954 (Poona Oriental Series, No. 91)

There are several other editions and translations of Ksemendras  
Suvrttatilaka, e.g.:

Dipak Kumar Sharma: Suv?ttatilaka of K?emendra. Text with Sanskrit  
commentary and English translation. Delhi : New Bharatiya Book Corp,  
2007.

Rabindra Kumar Panda: Suv?ttatilaka of K?emendra. With an  
introduction, study and charts. Delhi: Paramamitra Prakashan, 1998.

I have seen none of this personally, however the last one seems to  
contain Suryakantas English translation.

You may also try to get scans via google books.
If you have problems to purchase Suryakantas book, write me off the  
list and I will send you a copy.

Martin Straube.
