I think that A.D.H. Bivar wrote something about plagues in India and Europe, 
but probably with respect to earlier period. I can't remember exactly where, 
but it must have been in an article in Bulletin of the School of Oriental 
and African Studies, maybe in the 1970's. The article was not mainly about 
this subject, but it was mentioned in passing. If desired, I might be able 
to dredge up the reference.
