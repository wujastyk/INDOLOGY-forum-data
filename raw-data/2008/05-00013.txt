Hello Dominik,

     On my MacBook Pro, the fonts for the Mahabhasya page (in the Intratext version) are not showing up properly.  Do I need to change the font encoding settings to some special setting, or do I need a special font to view these pages?

Madhav

Thanks to the staff and funding at the intratext.com project, and to the 
original data-analysis and data-entry project under Prof. Cardona, the 
Mahabhasya of Patanjali is now available with the Intratext coding:

   http://www.intratext.com/ixt/san0011/_INDEX.HTM

This makes the generation of KWIC indexes trivially easy, as well as 
providing various statistical and lexical analyses of the text.

Best,
