>?From India to Israel-The Musical Heritage of Cochin
For centuries Jewish women along India?s Malabar Coast filled
notebooks with music they sang in Malayalam at weddings, community
celebrations
and rituals. Now they have been painstakingly re-discovered, performed
and recorded in Israel, and been the subject of international exchange
on
the cultures of Hindus, Christians and Jews in India?s vibrant
multi-ethnic Kerala region. A unique local and international partnership
will present
this music and those key to its revival at three DC area events.
