Dear Jenny Cover,

I have dealt with this topic in two of my publications. Unfortunately
they are in German. Kindly consult my home page:

http://www.staff.uni-marburg.de/~hahnm/

Then go to "Publications", Monographs No. 8 (1983) and Paper No. 30
(1982). At the end of the paper you will find more bibliographical hints
that might be useful for you.
