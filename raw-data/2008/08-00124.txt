Florence Tan Moeson Fellowship Program Announced
The Asian Division Friends Society announces the Florence Tan Moeson Research Fellowship for 2009. This fellowship is made possible by a generous donation of Florence Tan Moeson, for 43 years a Chinese Team cataloger in the Regional and Cooperative Cataloging Division before she retired in 2001.
The purpose of the fellowship is to give individuals the opportunity to use the Asian collections in the Library of Congress, which are among the most significant outside of Asia and consist of nearly 2.8 million books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts and microforms in the languages of East, South and Southeast Asia.
Researchers wishing to submit applications should go to this Web site: www.lcasianfriends.org/fellowship. The deadline for applying for the 2009 fellowship program is September 30, 2008.
The Florence Tan Moeson Research Fellowship consists of $14,000 each year for 10 years in support of grants for research using the Asian Division?s Reading Room and the Library?s extensive Asian collections. The grants will be awarded upon demonstration of need. Grants are intended to pay for travel to and from Washington, overnight accommodations and photocopying fees. Graduate and upper-level undergraduate students, independent scholars, community college teachers, researchers without regular teaching appointments, and librarians with a demonstrated need for fellowship support are especially encouraged to apply.
The Library?s Asian collection began in 1869 with a gift of 10 works in 933 volumes from the emperor of China to the United States. Spanning a diversity of subjects from China, Japan, Korea, the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, the Library?s Asian collections have become one of the most accessible and comprehensive sources of Asian language materials in the world.
For further information about the collection, visit the Asian Division?s Web site at www.loc.gov/rr/asian/.

Thank you.

I might add that I can think of some specific proposals much on my mind, notably cataloging Sanskrit, Urdu, and other South Asian language manuscripts.
