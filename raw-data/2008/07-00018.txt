Maurer's course seems really good (but I haven't used it in the 
classroom), and I've regretted for years that it can't be used widely 
because of the high pricing.

I wonder if it would be worth getting up a petition to the publishers?  If 
someone wanted to do that, I'd gladly sign.

Best,
Dominik
