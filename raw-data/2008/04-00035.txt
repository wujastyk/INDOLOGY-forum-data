Subject: FW: The effects of different Sanskrit poetic meters
Message-ID: <161227082360.23782.13726518430853798061.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Greetings,

Can anyone please direct me to articles discussing the effects of different Sanskrit poetic meters. That is, do different meters, such as anustubh, vasantatilaka, shArdUlavikrI?ita, mAlinI, evoke particular moods? If so, what are the moods and how are they evoked? 

There is an appreciation that these meters do evoke different moods, but has anyone articulated the mechanism.

Thankyou,
