Prof. Witzel:
Thank you for the reference to zuudraarya. 
I was in fact referring to what G?rard Huet had to say about the order of names of the four varnas. I quote him from his second-last email:
"Actually, vaarttikas recommend the fair law: first should be come the notion worthy of most respect, like in maatapitarau. And of course braahma.nak.satriyavi.t"suudraa.h - br?hmans should always go first!"
According to (secularist) grammatical tradition, "the notion of worthy of respect" applies to the first example: maataapitarau; the second example (braahma.nak.satriyavi.t"suudraa.h) simply alludes to the sequence (aanupuurvya) in which they appear in the Vedas, i.e. Rig-Veda 10.90.12. It should be noted that Sanskrit texts often follow the same sequence even outside Dvandva compound.

Sanjay (below) seems to refer to the frequent Vedic compound 
zUdrArya- (Unicode: sudrarya-), where to many people's surprise, 
the grammarians mentioned below included, the Shudras come first.

Well, for a good  reason  -- again that of prosody or syllable count.

The Rgveda mostly has the clear, metrically indicated, trisyllabic 
reading  [aariya]  (ariya) for (KH) Arya (aarya, arya-), as noted 
already by Grassmann 1873, RV Dictionary column 185-6.

In short, Panini-Behaghel's  (2+1+1, 2+2+2) rule is strictly 
followed, against all contemporary social sensitivities:

zUdra+Ariya (sudra+ariya):  2 syll + 3 syllables, or :  2+1, 2+1+1 
morae.

In fact, this has been noted and explained long ago by Hans Oertel : 
"zUdrArya", I think in ZDMG 1936;  see now H.Oertel, Kleine 
Schriften. Heinrich Hettrich,  Thomas Oberlies (eds.). Stuttgart : 
Franz Steiner Verlag, 1994.


A nice weekend!
