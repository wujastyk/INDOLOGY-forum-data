Dear Colleagues,

As some of you may already have seen from other sources, Professor Ram  
Murti Sharma, the former VC of Sampurnananda Skt University and a  
Board member of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies,  
died on 14th June.

Recently I received a message from Professor Ram Murti Sharma's son,  
Dr Sunil Sharma, from which I quote:
We are planning a COMMEMORATION VOLUME in his honour.  Through this  
letter, I wud request ... ... <IASS> members to send a paper on any  
theme in Indian and Western Philosophy and Culture including  
Sanskritization or any topic in which they specialize by 30th Nov  
2008.  However, it wud b better if papers have a global perspective as  
his last book, yet to b released, abt which I wud inform, is titled  
VEDANTA-EAST AND WEST.  Doesn't matter, if the paper has been  
pre-presented elsewhere.  We will like to enrich this volume by  
contributions fron IASS members."

In a subsequent message  in which he agreed to my sending this message  
to the list, he amplified his remarks on the them as follows:
"Since, his field was VEDANTA, we will more than welcome papers in  
VEDANTA but at d same time, let it be left to the scholar for greater  
freedom and flexibility. They can send it by 30th Nov,2008 by e-mail  
in MS-Word and/or send d hard copy at the undermentioned address of my  
office. The language can be English/ Sanskrit/ Hindi.However, we wud  
prefer English for a global reach."

I hope that some of you will be in a position to accede to this  
request (and would be pleased to be informed, if you do so).

With all good wishes
