I'm very sorry to hear that Prof. Joshi has passed away.

Although Prof.  Joshi is characterised below for his work with computers,
his earlier work was with the history and calligraphy of Devanagari and
other scripts.  He was a very fine calligrapher of Indian scripts, one of
the sole practitioners of this art that I know in modern India.  His study
of the history of script was also important and unique.  While his
contribution to computer encoding was well-received in the contemporary
Indian computing world, it was his deep knowledge of the history of script
and his extraordinary and beautiful skills as a calligrapher that uniquely
distinguished his work.  It is good to know that his vision of Indian
script lives on in the typographic designs of many new Indic fonts.
