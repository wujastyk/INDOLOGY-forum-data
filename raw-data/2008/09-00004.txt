JAINA SCRIPTURES AND PHILOSOPHY
(11th JAINA STUDIES WORKSHOP AT SOAS)
March 12-13
Brunei Gallery Lecture Theatre
School of Oriental and African Studies, Russell Square, London
WC1H OXG

Research on the Jaina Agamas, once the main domain of Jainology and Prakrit
Studies, has become rare nowadays, while studies of Jaina philosophy and
religion based on sources in Sanskrit, Middle and New-Indo-Aryan languages
are increasing. The conference seeks to reconnect research on canonical and
non-canonical sources and their uses. Contributions are invited on Jaina
scriptures and philosophy.

The conference is co-organised by the Centre of Jaina Studies at SOAS and
the Centre for Theology and Religious Studies of the University of Lund.
