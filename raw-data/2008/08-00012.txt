Dear all:

[As I was writing the below Mark?s email arrived, but it is maybe 
worth adding the additional details and examples. Mark: Did you 
address the issue of mora count in your book ? which I have of 
course, but not with me?]

One might add that the principle of waxing syllables (and moras, 
see below) remained operative in MIA formulaic language, see e.g. 
pp. 15 ff. of:

    Oskar von Hin?ber, 1994. Untersuchungen zur M?ndlichkeit fr?her
   mittelindischer Texte der Buddhisten. Mainz: Akademie der
   Wissenschaften und der Literatur. (Abhandlungen der geistes?
   und sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse, Jahrgang 1994,Nr. 5 /
   Untersuchungen zur Sprachgeschichte undHandschriftenkunde des
   P?li, III.)

who notes that in the Pali grammatical tradition it is referred to 
by Aggava?sa (under the name v?c?sili??hat?) and provides the 
following reference to another early discussion of P??ini 2.2.34 
and the OIA side of the coin:

   W. Caland, 1931. A rhythmic law in language. Acta Orientalia 9:
    59?68.

Now the mora count of words like ?r(i)ya or s?r(i)ya differs of 
course between ?gvedic and Pali as consonant assimilation and 
epenthesis were based on the disyllabic OIA form and operated 
after the Law of Two Moras:

   ?rya > *arya > ayya, ariya / ayira

But it appears from other examples that mora count (secondary to 
syllable count) remained relevant in MIA formulas. Among the 
examples given on pp. 15?31 of von Hin?ber?s study there are, at a 
glance, six cases where two adjacent member have the same syllable 
but a rising mora count:

   abhir?pa dassan?ya p?s?dika (4 + 4 + 4 s.; 5 + 6 + 6 m.) [18]
   dubbhikkhe dv?hitike seta??hike (3 + 4 + 4 s.; 6 + 6 + 7 m.) [20]
   dubbhikkha duhitika seta??ika sal?kavutta (3 + 4 + 4 + 5 s.; 5 
+ 4 + 6 + 7) [20]
   vu??hi? vir??hi? vepulla? (2 + 3 + 3 s.; 4 + 5 + 6 m.) [23]
   daliddo appadhano appabhogo (3 + 4 + 4 s.; 5 + 5 + 6 m.) [29]
   a??ho mahaddhano mah?bhogo (2 + 4 + 4 s.; 4 + 6 + 7 m.) [29]

and only one counterexample (same syllable but falling mora count):

   attaman? pamudit? p?tisomanassaj?t? (4 + 4 + 8 s.; 6 + 5 + 13 
m.) [30]

The continued relevance of mora count in MIA rhythmic language is 
of course unsurprising seeing the rise of m?tr?chandas etc. Von 
Hin?ber does not seem to go into the mora side of things (unless I 
missed it), but surely this has been discussed elsewhere.

Best wishes,
Stefan Baums
