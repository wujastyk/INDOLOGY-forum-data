Dear Colleagues

We still have five places left in our Spoken Sanskrit Summer School, 
Australia, 6-20 February 2009, but they are filling fast. The course 
will be taught by Pandit Dr Sadananda Das of the University of Leipzig. 
I would be grateful if you would draw this course to the attention of 
your colleagues and students, wherever they may be.

Details are available on our website:

It will be held at our magnificent coastal campus: http://kioloa.anu.edu.au

Yours

McComas
