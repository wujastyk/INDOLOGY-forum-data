Subject: Will in Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227082596.23782.4874714382490146495.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I haven't seen the Bhikkhu Pasadika article, but generally in Buddhist
literature the term would be cetanA, in the sense of volition. "Will" is
used in many different senses in Western contexts: volition, choice,
fortitude, perseverance, etc. In medieval usage Intellect is a faculty of
analytic comprehension; Will the power of choosing between options. One can
find a variety of Sanskrit terms in the various traditions that cover these
senses and more. (adhimokSa, vIrya, etc.)

The idea of "Free Will" however is itself a problematic notion, implying an
autonomous self whose choices will be judged by a Supreme Being, determining
one's ultimate destiny. That is, Free Will only has meaning in a theology of
obedience.

Will, in the sense of purposeful activity, zeal to accomplish, etc., can be
expressed many ways in Sanskrit.
