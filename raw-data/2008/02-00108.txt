Thanks, Ashok, for toggling my memory.

It works quite differently from yours, something like this:
Srngaraprakasa -- Ashok has additional material -- ask him.

The rest is usually safely filed away, both in memory and papers, as  
it must be in this case. Probably when we moved office shortly after  
your time here.
And, as we did not have the money then to print another expensive  
book of 900+ pages of Skt text, at more than $ 12 k, that very few  
people will buy.

I will take a look in my office.

----

However, this inadvertent public exchange provides me with the  
opportunity to announce a few new volumes of the Harvard Oriental  
Series:

* already published, in late December:
Todd Lewis and  Tuladhar: Chittadhar Hrdaya's Sugata Saurabha.
(Newari and English = a Buddhacarita in poetic modern Newari, by one  
of their best poets).

* Theodore Riccardi &  Mohan Khanal
Archaeological Excavations at Dumakhal (Kathmandu Valley), in: HOS,  
Opera Minora, vol. 5.
To be released in a few weeks.

* A new Vedic Concordance, by Marco Franceschini,  to be released  
this winter
(2 vols., incl. PS, JB, BSS's 10k mantras, etc., incl. CD of texts).

* Leonard van der Kuijp's and Kurtis Schafer's book on an early list  
of the Tibetan canon
(long announced, but probably out this spring, finally!)

* Lawrence McCrea's book on Anandavardhana, later this spring

* Vol. II of Nepalese Shaman Songs, by Gregory Maskarinec (this  
spring, incl. DVD of performances)

* Karen Ebert's and  Martin Gaenzle's texts on Rai mythology (with  
Engl. transl.)

* Vol. III of B.R. Sharma' s  Samaveda  (probably in the Fall/Winter)

etc. etc.  There are others in the pipeline.  Whoever of them comes  
first  is served first, ---  as long as the money will last.

Cheers,
Michael
