Dear Stella Sandahl,

as far as I know the new edition (Motilal Banarsidass, 2005) has such an index.

Best,

Marco Franceschini

Dave's book is indeed very useful, but would be even better if there  
was a Sanskrit index of name of birds found in Sanskrit literature.  
As it it, the book is very difficult to consult.  Has a Sanskrit  
index been compiled?  If not, maybe someone has an ornithologically  
inclined student who could devote him/herself to the task.
Best regards
