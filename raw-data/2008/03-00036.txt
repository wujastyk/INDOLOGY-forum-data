The relevant Jha?k?ra reference is:

Kail?sa Candra D??a, "Vai??ava L?l?m?ta: eka  
d???ip?ta", Jha?k?ra (44?a var?a, 9ma sa?khy?)  
?isembara 1992, pp. 815-825

(By the way, since this review does occasionally seem to carry  
significant articles, it would be most commendable if the LC tried to  
extend its run beyond 1996.)

I also find another relevant article in my files:

Saccid?nanda Mi?ra, "Vai??ava L?l?m?ta: aitih?sika m?lya  
nirddh?ra?a", in Praj??loka (Praphesara V?sudeva S?hu  
Abhinandana Grantha), Ka?aka [Cuttack], Vidy?prak??ana, 2000, pp.  
168-174.

As far as I recall, the main reason for doubting the authenticity of  
the Vai??ava L?l?m?ta is the fact that it contains many  
historical references that could not have been known to a 16th or  
17th century writer.
