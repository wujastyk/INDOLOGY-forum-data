Subject: Indus signs discussion
Message-ID: <161227079576.23782.7162010713093442600.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Personally I have not been too eager to have a "High Noon on the Harappa 
Lane", as Harry Falk so aptly characterized the duel to which Michael has 
been inviting me. I also think that these controversies will be decided in 
the law court of time, en dikeei khronou. But I had to reply to Michael's 
challenge and to set right his implications ("personal remarks"), although I 
anticipated that this sort of exchange of messages will not be welcomed by 
many subscribers of the Indology list. As Harry has confirmed my impression, 
I intend to withdraw from this discussion as an active participant and to 
remain an attentive listener. My position and theses have been set forth in 
my 1994 book, and I have tried to summarize them -- and to reply to the "no 
script thesis" -- in my 2005 paper, so I refer the prospective discussants 
to these publications for my views. But I very much value the expertise of 
the list members and will be most grateful for an informed discussion of the 
factual issues, if such a discussion gets going.

In the end, I merely want to reply to the question about the third volume of 
the Corpus of Indus seals and Inscriptions, which indeed has been too long 
in the making. It will come out in two parts, and the first part, limited to 
(old and new) material from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, will appear in 2007; 
the second part, comprizing fairly comprehensively all the remaining 
material, will appear as soon as possible thereafter, tentatively in 2008. 
There is a lot of interesting new material, of course important for the 
study of the Indus script, but nothing radically different from what is 
already known (except for the well-known monumental gate inscription from 
Dholavira).
