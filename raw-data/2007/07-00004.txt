Thanks to all who gave wise advice on my query regarding "caamara". 
It turns out that the term (caamara, camara, caamarii) are used with 
regard to the yak itself. Bob Goldman pointed to the passage in the 
southern recension of the Ramayana (2.26.2, *660) where camara is an 
animal alongside others. Mark Allon refered me to Jaataka VI..537f 
where we have camarii/caamarii in a list of animals. And Diwakar 
Acharya referred me to the Kumaarasambhava 1.13 where also caamarii 
is used for the Yak, there clearly associated with mountains.

On sRmukha, I have just found that Laksmidhara (ZraadhakaaNDa, p. 51) 
in another context glosses it as: jalaprabhavakhaadirazaakam" ? I am 
not sure what "khaadira" (acacia) means in this context, but it is 
probably vegetable growing in water.

Thanks all. Perhaps the Pune Dictionary people will take note.

Best,

Patrick
