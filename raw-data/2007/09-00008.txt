Subject: avagraha in Malayalam manuscripts
Message-ID: <161227081073.23782.5396802415780906039.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have come across the avagraha sign at least once in Malayalam manuscripts. 
The NellikkaaTTu Mana manuscript of Bhavatraata's Jaiminiiya-S'rautasuutra-
BhaaSya, which is a very large-sized and brittle old manuscript, has the 
avagraha (rather similar to the devanagari avagraha, i.e. like S but angular 
with two bends) on the reverse of folio 38, line 7, corresponding to page 
84, end of line 3 in Premnidhi Shastri's edition (1966):  athavaaSstotra.... 
The avagraha which I have marked here with capital S clarifies the a 
privativum in sandhi: atha vaa astotra....
