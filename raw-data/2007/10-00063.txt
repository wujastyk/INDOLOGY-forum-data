Dear list members,

Dina Bangdel and I have receive a huge response to the offer of the  
Asa Saphu Digital archive catalog. However two things have also  
occurred.

1) We were checking their published list against the actual DVDs and  
discovered that the list is short about 1500 entries! Their published  
list ends at 5309 and the DVDs end at 7025 leaving an apparent 1716  
files with no information provided in any form.

2) To partially remedy  this, we have created a database of the hand  
written information cards included in each file folder by opening  
disks 19-52 (Folder no.s 5310-7025) and opening each folder and  
copying the JPEG of the info card to a file maker database. This is  
not a sortable database except by the (useless) arbitrary item number  
(it does not correspond to any numbering system in the 1991 published  
catalog by Vaidya and Kamsakar). However, run on a relatively fast  
computer, on can scan the entire (1595 entries) in about an hour.

In a very few days these will be added to the Huntington archive  
website for down load for FTP download.

Cheers  to all

John
