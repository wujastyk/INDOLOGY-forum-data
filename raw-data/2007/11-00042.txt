Some years ago, (1970?), there was a very clean clear copy of an Asva  
Sastra in the Gauhati Museum, Assam. I regret to admit that it was  
somewhat outside of our interests and we chose not to photograph it.  
As I recall it looked as if it were 18-19th century and basically  
unused, therefore in nearly pristine condition. Unfortunately, we did  
not examine it for completeness, orthography or anything else but to  
look at a few of the illustrations of horses which were quite nice.
