Dear All,

since Steve Farmer is not on this list (INDOLOGY), I answer briefly as 
I am co-moderator of the Indo-Eurasian Research list @ Yahoo, along 
with L.M. Fosse). Clearly, the IER list is not "Steve's list"!

But that is precisely what it is. I know the all of the  background, 
which is not appropriate to be spread all over the net. We have enough 
of that already (as I can testify to personally, for a decade... :^).

In addition:

The IER list is moderated for good reasons. INDOLOGY members will 
remember that  Dominik had to reformat this list a few years ago when 
the level of Hindutva sniping got too bad. We have learned from that.

However, If there is *scholarly* disagreement, even heated exchanges, 
fine. For example, one scholar of Indian grammar has publicly done so, 
vociferously, several times, and has finally chosen to withdraw from 
further  discussion, -- but he has not attacked the list as such on 
other fora such as this.

It also is important to note that our List uses a publication model, 
unlike other lists.

Further,  that we have  attempted to take on very central issues (some 
discussed at great length, and over a year) such as our still ongoing 
"stratification" discussion.

In doing so, we have in fact broken new ground, and we have also 
debunked many scholarly myths standard (Indus bricks, weights, etc 
etc.)  ever since we started. This is possible as we have scholars from 
some 30 fields who correct each other. No inbreeding.

I leave apart the discussion about my friend Mahadevan's newspaper 
article and Steve's invitation to him to discuss it in public. I think 
Mahadevan is wrong in what he printed in the Hindu, and I have said so 
on IER.

Incidentally,  if some things were said about the F-S-W paper at 
Madison in October 2005(?), this has not reached my ears yet. The only  
thing in writing  so far is a rather polemic paper by my friend  A. 
Parpola, his talk at Tokyo in June 2005, where I was present. There was 
NO time for discussion! We did that a few weeks later, in his, M. 
Kenoyer's, Steve's and my  presence, at Kyoto.  A good defense for the 
"script" model did not emerge. Kenoyer conceded that the Indus signs do 
not represent written language (like sentences)  but he still called 
them a 'script' ...

And that is all I will say about this topic. I have better things to 
do... such as finalizing 2 book projects.
