It is this time of the year again:

Please take note, and tell your students, that we will again offer 
Sanskrit in Harvard  Summer School  (since 1990):

This year I plan to include some computer-based materials (oral and 
written) as well, as to allow students to practice with our favorite 
toy?

Best wishes,
