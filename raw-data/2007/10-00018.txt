Very interesting. It could be useful to know the 
origin of the KUML L.662 mss. and find other 
examples to check if it comes from the same 
area/milieu as Parpola's ms. from the 
NellikkaaTTu Mana. It could be a local or 
temporally limited use in the history of 
Malayalam scipt.
With best wishes,
Chrsitophe Vielle
