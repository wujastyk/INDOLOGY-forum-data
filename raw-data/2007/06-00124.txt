I had some uriner inflammation and it turned out to be a small stone in one 
kidney. After three weeks, I am hopeful that it is diluted and gone. I have 
a followup on Friday.

Otherwise everything going well, and I am looking forward to be in Leiden.

With warmest greetings,

Diwakar

>>Sample letter or email to express your Protest..........
>>
>>Rama Sethu bridge of the Ramayana times should be classified as  ancient 
>>monument and archaeological site. It has immense  traditional and 
>>historical value. The bridge has been revered by  Hindus since times 
>>immemorial. The age-old belief was recently  validated as true by graphic 
>>satellite images.
>>
>>It should be noted that Taj corridor scheme on the banks of river  Yamuna, 
>>was barred by the Supreme Court on the ground that it would  threaten the 
>>historic Taj Mahal; and the Delhi Metro Rail route was  changed when the 
>>older scheme was considered dangerous to the  historic Qutub Minar.
>>
>>Dredging work at the SethuBridge, being part of Ramayana and deeply  
>>embedded in the Hindu psyche, hurts intense religious beliefs and  
>>sentiments and causing distress and deep resentment amongst a  billion 
>>Hindus worldwide. If not stopped, there may be a comment in  every 
>>Ramayana Katha for generations, that there was a Congress  regime that 
>>destroyed the Ram Sethu Bridge.
>>
>>Hence we request your urgent attention, and cancellation of the  
>>Sethusamudram Project (SSCP).
