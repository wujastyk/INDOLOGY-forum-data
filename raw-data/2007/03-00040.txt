Subject: river mahatmyas
Message-ID: <161227079730.23782.8694120040832413379.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

dear colleagues,

i am collecting information on river mahatmyas. i am especially interested  
to know for which rivers mahatmyas exist.
I know that mahatmyas exist for the Narmada river.
Anne Feldhaus (in her work "Water and Womanhood", 1995) has reported a  
number of mahatmyas for rivers in Maharashtra, i.e. the Godavari, Bhima,  
Payosni (Purna), Tapi, Krsna. Now, all these texts seem to cover a rather  
limited geographical area. My question is: Are there any such texts  
composed for more distantly located rivers?
Any suggestion is highly appreciated.

thanks and best regards

jn
