5 Professorships within the Framework of
Transcultural 
Studies


The Heidelberg University Cluster of
Excellence ?Asia 
and Europe in Global Perspective:
Shifting Asymmetries in 
Cultural Flows? brings together
scholars in East and 
South Asian, Middle Eastern and European
Studies. To 
further develop the transcultural and
transdisciplinary 
research potential of the Cluster and to
strengthen its 
capabilities in handling transcultural
flows that cross 
linguistic, geographic, cultural and
media borders, five new 
professorships have been established.
These are in

(a)Intellectual History (with a focus on
translingual 
concepts)
(b)Visual and Media Anthropology 
(c)Art History (with a focus on the
global flow of art 
forms)
(d)Buddhist Studies
(e) Cultural Economic History (with a
focus on South 
Asia)

The professorships will be open in rank
from junior 
professor with tenure option, to full
professor with tenure. 
The Ph.D. dissertation must have been
completed by the 
time of application. 

The Cluster strongly encourages
qualified women scholars 
to apply. Handicapped persons with the
same equivalent 
qualifications will be given
preference.

The positions are open as of now.
Searches will continue 
until the positions are filled. Once a
position is filled, it will be 
announced on the Cluster web-site. Since
the common 
language of the Cluster is English,
proficiency in English is 
required. The positions withal entail
teaching duties, so 
successful candidates are expected to
acquire German 
language skills within three years of
their appointment. All 
successful candidates are expected to
cooperate in the 
development of master and postgraduate
programs with a 
transcultural focus

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac
polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore
culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam
captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux
eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius
effulgeat.
