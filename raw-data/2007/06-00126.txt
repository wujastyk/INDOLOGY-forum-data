Dear Matthew and other Indology members,
I also have a pdf scan of Levi's edition and unlike the scan made by Richard,
this scan is not reverse, but has the normal white background and black text
and is made directly from the 1907 book edition. It is a pdf file which is
around 31 MB, very readable. Should you or others want a copy, it might be
possible to make it available somewhere for download. However, I do not have a
webpage myself, so perhaps someone else might help out with this? I guess there
should not be copyright issues with a book from 1907?

Off-list replies are welcome and I will report back to the list if something
works out.

Sincerely,
Tim
