Dear Indology list members,

it is my sad duty to inform you
that the great Tamil scholar Ti. Ve. Gopal Iyer (alias TVG)
passed away this afternoon (Sunday, 2007 April 1st)

He will be very much missed
by all those who had the chance to study Tamil with him

He will be remembered by all those
who will be lucky to use the many books he authored.

-- Jean-Luc Chevillard (Paris)
