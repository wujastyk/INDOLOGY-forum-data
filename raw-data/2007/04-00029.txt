Dear Richard,

Would you be willing to post an announcement to the Indology mailing
list on my behalf? ...

I have placed a new utility on my website, which may be of interest to
people who work with Vedic. It is called vaccent, and it permits the
user to convert a Vedic text in Roman transliteration (using acute and
grave accents to indicate udatta and independent svarita) to a
Devanagari equivalent, correctly accented according to the system used
in the RV, AV, TS etc.

The vaccent program (which is written in Perl) merely outputs an
intermediate file; to convert this file to Devanagari the general
Roman-to-Devanagari conversion program ur2ud is also needed. Both are
available at

  http://bombay.indology.info/software/programs/index.html

Note that both Roman input and Devanagari output are in Unicode; the
input file must follow the ISO 15919 transliteration standard. The
same web page contains numerous other conversion utilities if your
starting point is something other than standard Unicode Roman.
