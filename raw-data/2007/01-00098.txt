Subject: Making the Argument for Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227079230.23782.3572114277555908645.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Leonard Bloomfield, W. D. Whitney, A. B. Keith, and F. Max Mueller, are all known to us as Sanskritists.  But, let's not forget the significant contributions they made in fields outside Sanskrit: Bloomfield and Whitney to the study of language; Keith to constitutional law, and Max Mueller to the science of religion ("comparative religions") and the study of mythology.  Indeed, I imagine the world largely knows these scholars through their "other" (non-Sanskrit) contributions to knowledge.

Others in this category are M. Eliade, a prolific novelist as well as an important figure in the history of religions, and (to a lesser degree) Joseph Campbell, mythologist and James Joyce analyst.

  Also of course T.S. Eliot who studied Sanskrit at Harvard, whence his 
  Upanisad citation in "The Wasteland." (I think Gary Tubb knows the details 
  of his Sanskrit coursework.)

  Marcel Mauss (1872-1950) the famous French sociologist and member of the
  Ann?e Sociologique studied Sanskrit.
