Dear list-members,

the announcement of an assistant position at the Institute for South 
Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies in Vienna was incomplete in that it

allow me to specify:

A list of the required documents can be found at:

http://www.univie.ac.at/personal-mitteilungsblatt/index.php?Alias_ID=1&sub1=965&Art_ID=1991

In short, these are:

- application form ("Bewerbungsbogen"), linked on that page (found here:
http://www.univie.ac.at/personal/form/doc/20060621_PA.B3_Bewerbungsbogen.doc)
- CV (signed by the applicant)
- birth certificate (photocopy)
- certificate of nationality (photocopy)
- certificates of educational qualifications, in this case especially 
the required university degree (photocopy)

For the sake of completeness, the full English text of the job advert is
