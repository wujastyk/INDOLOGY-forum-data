 Dear Stuart,
thanks a lot for forwarding the list of the Yoga Consultation sessions for this year?s AAR meeting. Just a minor bibliographical question: Has volume XII of the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies (Yoga: India?s Philosophy of Meditation, Edited by Gerald J. Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya) already been published? If this is the case, could you please give the bibliographical details?

Many thanks in advance, with best regards,

Philipp
