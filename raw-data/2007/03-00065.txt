On p. 24 of D.M. Bhattacharyya's posthumously published Kaushik  
Lectures (The Fundamental Themes of the Atharvaveda, Poona 1968), I  
read:

"In his .Rgvedabhaa.syaanukrama.nii (8.1) Ve:nka.ta Maadhava speaks  
of a Paippalaada Sa.mhitaa of 20 Kaa.n.das and a Braahma.na work:  
aitareyam asmaakam paippalaadakam atharva.naam. The Prapa;ncah.rdaya  
states that the Braahma.na was in eight chapters: tadbraahma.nam  
adhyaayaa.s.takam"."

I cannot find a text called .Rgvedabhaa.syaanukrama.nii, but fear I  
am making a stupid mistake. Can anybody enlighten me, and provide me  
with a reference to an edition? Does anybody have any idea about the  
chronological relationship (and any other possible relationship)  
between Ve:nka.ta Maadhava and the Prapa;ncah.rdaya? Could either  
have copied information from the other?

Many thanks in advance for any help this regard.
