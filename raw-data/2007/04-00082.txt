Dear List-Members,

I just received a query from a retired journalist, re. the purpoted  
Skt. sequence
"nanonanunnonunnono",
which is supposed to translate as: "the lesser should not try to  
compete with the greater".
The best I could do with it, without diacritics, is more or less  
nonsense: "He who is indeed wet for us is not un-wet for us" (na no  
nanu +unno 'nunno no[=na.h). ;-)
It's possible that the text was transmitted garbled -- perhaps the  
adjective ^una fit in the original somewhere.
I'm quite stumped, though the passage sounds somewhat familiar. Does  
anyone have any ideas?
