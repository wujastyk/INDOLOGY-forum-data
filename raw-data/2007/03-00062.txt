The structure of the story, but not the "southern branch", has something 
in common with the Gadhi story from the Moksopaya. It was introduced to me 
by Gary Tubb in a spellbinding telling during the Turin Skt conference, 
and I've subsequently read it.  The brahman Gadhi falls into a kind of 
trance and then lives a whole life in another reality, as an untouchable, 
before awaking to find virtually no time has passed.  But he subsequently 
learns that somehow both realities, both lives, were indeed "real".

The story also occurs in the expansions based on the Moksopaya, i.e., the 
Yogavasisthas etc., and is discussed in Wendy Doniger's book Dreams, 
Illusions and other Realities.
