Subject: The word uttara in the titles of texts,              particularly "saiva tantras
Message-ID: <161227081005.23782.8057720361761206486.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indology members,

   I am working on a "saiva gaaru.da-/bhuutatantra text called the
kriyaakaalagu.nottara, and am trying to understand the title,
particularly the final member of the compound, uttara.  Thus far I can
see three main possibilities:

1.  uttara as a generic honorific appended in the sense of 'The Higher
(tantra) of ...'

2.  uttara as a parinipaata only with gu.na, in the sense of 'The Higher
Qualities (of)...'

3. in this context of a conversation between "Siva and Kaarttikeya, uttara
in the sense of 'reply (concerning)...'


I would be grateful for any feedback in this matter and/or other possible
interpretations I have missed.

Sincerely,

Michael Slouber
