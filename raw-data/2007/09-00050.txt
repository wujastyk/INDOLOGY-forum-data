Jonathan,

You may want to watch out with the word "chiffon" in any case, in the interests of clarity and intelligibility across the English-speaking world.  I think the word means something different in India than what it means in the USA.  "American chiffon" is or used to be a coveted item for sari cloth.  But when on a friend's request I bought a sari length of chiffon here for his mother, it was not at all what they meant, which I was never able to clear up.

Dear friends,

In something now in the press, I have a passage in which the term 
viralikaa occurs, a sort of colorful fabric. BR explains it as a sort 
of porous fabric. Does anyone have a more specific suggestion as to 
its identity? (The editor queried my translation as chiffon, which I 
confess was a much a place filler as anything else...)
