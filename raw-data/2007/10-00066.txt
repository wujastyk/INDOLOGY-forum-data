AHRC PhD Studentship

An AHRC Project on Indian Conceptions of Self, jointly administered
by the Department of Philosophy, University of Sussex and the
Department of Religious Studies, Lancaster University, will run from
January 2008 to December 2010. The purpose of the project is to
investigate accounts of the self in classical and early modern Indian
philosophical analysis. In particular, the project is interested in
the philosophical response to Buddhist ideas about personal identity
and the character of selfhood.

A three-year full-time PhD studentship is available from January
2008, based at the University of Sussex.

The award includes fees at the Home/EU rate, and and an annual
maintenance grant of ?12,300, plus a ?400 allowance for travel.  Due
to funding regulations, the applicant must be a UK national, satisfy
UK residency requirements, or be a (non-UK) EU national who has been
ordinarily resident in the UK throughout the 3 year period
immediately prior to 1 January 2008. Please consult the "Guide for
Applicants for Postgraduate Awards in the Arts and Humanities; The
Doctoral Awards Scheme" on the AHRC website www.ahrc.ac.uk for
further details.

Interested applicants should contact Jonardon Ganeri
(j.ganeri at sussex.ac.uk) in the first instance. Further particulars
about postgraduate study at Sussex, and application procedures, are

Deadline for applications: 16 November 2007.
