Call for Papers

Workshop in 'Manuscriptology',
Copenhagen University, 8.-11. October 2007

Material, philological and cultural
approaches to manuscripts

Although the study of handwritten documents has a
long history behind it in many parts of the world,
no unified discipline of "manuscriptology" has yet
evolved capable of comprising Chinese, Tibetan,
Indian, African, Mezzo-American, Arabic and other
manuscripts as well as those of the Gr?co-Roman
tradition. This workshop, therefore, aims to bring
together leading researchers concerned with topics
pertaining to the material, philological and cultural/
sociological aspects of their respective manuscript
traditions in order to initiate an exchange of ideas
and approaches across continents and disciplines.
In this way we hope to initiate the necessary and
much desired process of interdisciplinary co-operation
which can lead to the establishment of a truly
international academic discipline of manuscriptology.

Keynote speakers
Prof. Richard Salomon, University of Seattle, Washington
