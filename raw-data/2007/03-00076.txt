Subject: help getting Urdu book from Norway
Message-ID: <161227079822.23782.12584047282270997503.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The article "Veil and a warning" (Frontline, Feb. 10, 2006), 58-60, says that an Urdu book supposedly published by the All Pakistan Muslim Association, entitled Iblis ki Aulad, and attacking Norwegian society in general, has caused a considerable stir among Norwegian Muslims.  Does anyone know where I could get a copy for my library?  I don't find it via any online bookfinding services.

Thanks,

Allen
