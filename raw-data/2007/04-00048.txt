Thanks, Madhav.  That brings up a page that gives me the bibliographical 
details of the 1887 edition, but that's all.  No buttons to click, no 
"download" possibilities.  There are links to shops and libraries, but no 
download.

I guess the "universal library" isn't so universal.

Since then I have been trying to locate the online source from which I downloaded this file, but cannot locate the source.  Have tried Googlebooks, DLI, and a few other places.  Does anyone know where to locate this pdf file?  Thanks for help.
