Does anyone know anything about what happened to the stock of Dinkar Trivedi of the New Order Book Company in Ahmedabad after he died 15 or 20 years ago?  A library patron wishes to know.  Was it bought by someone outside the family?  Does anyone have a contact for the family?

Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
