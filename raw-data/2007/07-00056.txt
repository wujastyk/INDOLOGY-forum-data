Dear Indologists,
 
South Asia Research and Information Institute (SARII), Southern Methodist  
University's Department of Religious Studies, and Indian Cultural Heritage  
Foundation sponsor a one-day conference on "The History of  
Catirattam/Bharatanatyam" on September 22, 2007 in Dallas.  

While there have been many conferences in recent years focusing on the  
relationship between the Devadasi tradition and Bharatanatyam, the  SARII 
conference will trace the evolution of this dance form over two  millennia - all the 
way from its bardic past to the  present.
