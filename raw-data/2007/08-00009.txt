Dear Colleagues,

I am deeply shocked to hear this. Does anyone has more information on  
what happened? Primoz seemed to be doing perfectly well at the  
Edinburgh Sanskrit Conference - so was this a sudden and totally  
unexpected occurrence?

Many thanks for any further information,

Elizabeth De Michelis
