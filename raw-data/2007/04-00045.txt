I've now found the proper book (confusingly also called "Panini's 
Grammatik").  It's at http://tinyurl.com/399una

But from the UK it's only a "limited preview".

Since then I have been trying to locate the online source from which I downloaded this file, but cannot locate the source.  Have tried Googlebooks, DLI, and a few other places.  Does anyone know where to locate this pdf file?  Thanks for help.
