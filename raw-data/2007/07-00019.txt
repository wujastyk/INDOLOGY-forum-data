My quick books.google.com search yields that in _Leading Consciously:  
A Pilgrimage Toward Self-Mastery_, published in 1998, its author  
Debashis Chatterjee attributes the `translation' to Laurence G.  
Boldt, _How to Find the Work You Love_, published in 1993.

WikiQuote indeed ascribes it to Wyane W. Dyer, but if the quote was  
featured in his 2002 book, he probably took it from another  
inspirational book like the above.

T.K.V. Desikachar's translation, on the other hand, available online

http://www.bindu.freeserve.co.uk/yoga/yogasutra/ys1.htm
http://www.bindu.freeserve.co.uk/yoga/yogasutra/ys2.htm
http://www.bindu.freeserve.co.uk/yoga/yogasutra/ys3.htm
http://www.bindu.freeserve.co.uk/yoga/yogasutra/ys4.htm

does not have an equivalent.

Would the quote be `inspired' by the `interpretation' by Charles  
Johnston

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/patan10.txt

?

Quite a few keywords are found in the interpretation.
