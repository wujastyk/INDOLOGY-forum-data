Dear Allen

Thank you for this valuable information, regarding which, more 
broadly, I have a question.  You quote a detailed TOC; does LOC 
usually receive such information? (And I recall that for Prof Gode's 
collected works you apparently had to ask that the TOC be keyed in.) 
If so, is there a way of preserving this in the public record 
somehow? It is my impression that occassionally one finds TOC info in 
catalogues, but not commonly, and to my (admittedly faulty) memory, 
never with page numbers. Inclusion of such info would have obvious 
advantages, especially for those who would want to order a photocopy 
of a specific page range.

Just asking--jonathan
