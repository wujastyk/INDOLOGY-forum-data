Dear McComas,

More likely 400-1200, with many Upapuraa.nas much later.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey

Dear Colleagues

Is it fair to say that the scholarly consensus is that the purANas took 
their current form between 500-1000 CE?

Our library's copy of Rocher's book on the purANas has gone west, so I 
cannot check it.

With thanks in advance

McComas
