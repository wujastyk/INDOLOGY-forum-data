Many thanks to Dominik for posting information and directions on these very
useful tools! I've already put them to good use. Also, many thanks to those
who have done all the work on the DLI. What a marvelous resource. Now if
Ganesa will just help with the OCR . . .

I installed alternatiff I bring up a page of the book and save the location
(right click, l[ocation])

I open a command-line session and run the Cygwin version of the utility WGET
on the location.

When that completes, I have the book on my hard disk as a series of tiff
files, one per page.

I run tiff2pdf (also in Cygwin) on the directory, turning all the tiffs to
pdfs

I run pdftk (http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/) on the directory, turning all
the pdfs into one big pdf of the book.

I've automated most of this for myself.

The process is a bit home-made, but the results are excellent.  I have a
growing personal digital library of valuable books as PDF files.


Since the DLI directory structure is open, one can open an ftp or http 
session in a browser and roam around the books that way.  It's still all 
tiff files, but if WGET is not available one could fetch the files one at 
a time.  It would be very labour intensive.  E.g., go to

  http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/data_copy/upload/0075/479/PTIFF/

for the Pischel files.
