He was one of my professors at the Fergusson College during my student days (1962-66).  I would suggest you contact the current principal of the Fergusson College in Pune and they should be able to find this information for you.

Dear Indologists,

Would any of you happen to know if D. G. Dhavale, retired professor at the University of Pune and Ferguson College, Pune as of 1996, is still alive?  If so, is there a contact address or email for him?

Many thanks.

Sincerely,
Toke
