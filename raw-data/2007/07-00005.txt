Kumaarasa.mbhava I.13 uses camarii in the sense of Yak not a yak's tail, and 
the Nepali word for yak, cauri, is derived from this term. So it is quite 
possible that caamara is Yak or is closely related with Yak. Is it a male 
Yak?

I do not know how old and frequent was cross breeding in the past, but it is 
a fact that Yaks are cross bred with cows in Nepal to produce stronger and 
enduring hybrids. They get a seperate name but right now I do not remember 
the term. Theoretically this can be called caamara.  But I would give 
priority to the first possibility.
