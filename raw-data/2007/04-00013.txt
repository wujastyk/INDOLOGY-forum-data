All,
On a somewhat different note (and one that may have already been addressed), what about--as a first step--getting our own publications into .pdf format and locating them to be accessible to other scholars?  I realize we don't all hold the copyrights to our own works, and I have no idea if this is a problem in terms of possible copyright violation.   

I know many scholars have made some of their publications accessible through their own home pages (Professor Witzel, for example), but it would be nice to have a centralized repository. I wonder if the Indology list, or some willing technologically-savvy scholar--could "host" sets of our papers?

  is there any platform where scholars could share their pdf-files? I have  
  an ever growing library of valuable indological source books in pdf-format  
  too. if there was a platform to share such resources, the effort of  
  scanning etc. would be reduced and everyone could contribute his or her  
  pdfs. and everybody else could share the fruit of the individual effort.
  i suppose that it is evident to everyone that computer readable (or rather  
  viewable) versions of works which are otherwise available only in printed  
  form are desirable as you can have your library (or at least important  
  portions of it) with you on the laptop etc., everywhere you go.

  but then the question arises: what about copyright laws?
  we all know the gretil archive; many of the texts listed there have also  
  been extracted from printed editions subject to copyrigth laws. i suppose  
  that pdf-files prepared from printed books make a big difference in legal  
  terms, don't they?

  any chance to overcome this problem, anybody concerned with the question  
  of a (centralized) indological digital library?


  cheers
