"Helsinki Institute" sounds somewhat funny. The Institute is part of 
the University of Helsinki. In Italy at least Naples, Florence, Milano 
and Venice should be added, probably also Turin and Macerata. In Poland 
Sanskrit is actively studied and taught at the universities of Warsaw, 
Cracow and Wroclaw. In Russia St.Petersburg is missing. I am not 
certain, but I think Oscar Pujol is teaching in Barcelona. Further 
possibilities are at least Vilnius and Bucuresti.

What is Indian  School in Oman? The link given opens KALIDASA - 
SAMSKRITA - KENDRAM in Kanchi. There is also a Sanskrit Department in 
Dhaka in Bangladesh. And Tokyo, of course.

With best wishes,
Klaus
