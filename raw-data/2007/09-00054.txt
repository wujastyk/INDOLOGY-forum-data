Dear colleagues,
I feel it my sad duty to inform you that Professor
Tatiana Elizarenkova passed away on Wednesday,
5th September in Moscow. She would be 78 later this month.
As far as I know two months ago she was still actively working on the 2nd volume of the ZaunakIya Atharvaveda (Russian translation).
It is impossible to imagine a greater and more painful loss for us. Tatyana Yakovlevna was always the non-formal leader of Russian Indology, our highest authority and the perfect, unattainable example to follow.
We all loved her.
Yaroslav Vassilkov
