Steve,

I think that Mahadevan would be a fool to accept your offer.  This is 
not an open list.  It is YOUR list, and you set all of the ground rules.

What will happen is that a post from Mahadevan would appear on the list 
-- at your leisure --  immediately prefaced by a moderator's note, and 
then a closing refutation from you.  This is no way to carry on an open 
debate.  You get the first word and the last word -- every time.

Instead, this debate should be conducted on an unbiased list with a 
moderator who is not so invested in the issue.

I agree with you that we are not dealing with a script here, but I do 
not agree at all with  this policy of always having to have both the 
first word and the last.

I can think of two other lists that might serve as an unbiased place 
where a genuine debate could occur.

Sincerely,

George Thompson
