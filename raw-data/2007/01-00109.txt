Matt Kapstein was not blaming the A-Bomb on the Gita, but merely reporting a
well-known fact, which is that when Oppenheimer witnessed the first A-bomb
test, his spontaneous reaction to the awesome power of the explosion was to
recite, from memory, BG 11.32:

K?lo 'smi lokak?ayak?t prav?ddho

Lok?n sam?hartum iha prav?tta?

?te 'pi tv?? na bhavi?yanti sarve

ye 'avasthit?? pratyan?ke?u yodh??



which, I think we might agree, was an apt utterance for that occasion.

----Original Message---
Speculations to the effect  that it may have been Oppenheimer's brush with
indology, or his familiarity with the Bhagavadgita (which Heinrich Himmler
also was
familiar with, by the way), that triggered him to construct the atom bomb
can be
discarded as absurd fabrications, attributable to ignorance, charlatanry, or
worse.
