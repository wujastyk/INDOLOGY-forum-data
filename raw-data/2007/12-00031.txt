  Dear colleagues

A student sent me this document:

https://alliance.anu.edu.au/access/content/group/977b7a41-c53e-44b9-80cb-d62211333564/unknown_script_from_bali.pdf

Can any of you good folk identify the script and/or help with content?

I would also like to thanks all colleagues on this list for their help, 
support and collegiality in 2007. I wish you all an enjoyable and 
refreshing holiday season, and I look forward to interacting with you 
again in 2008.

Yours

McComas
