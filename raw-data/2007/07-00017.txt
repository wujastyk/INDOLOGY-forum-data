In forwarding this question to the list I forgot to add my own attempt at 
an answer, which is as follows:

I suspect this little summary was originally composed by Wayne W Dyer. 
It is featured prominently in his 1998 book _Wisdom of the Ages_ (where he 
attributes it to Patanjali) and is very much in the style of his other 
paraphrases.  It's possible he took it from someone else, but it sounds so 
much like Dyer himself that I take it to be his own synopsis of the 
Yogasutra.  In any case it has since been attributed directly to Patanjali 
in many books (e.g., _Ignited Minds_, a 2002 motivational book by the 
President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam).
