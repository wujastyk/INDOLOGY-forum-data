My apologies; I naively thought you were looking for information from  
within the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition, not from other traditions  
appropriating the figure of Caitanya.  The latter of course presents  
a very different kind of narrative problem, a much more vexed kind of  
issue from a the standpoint of the traditions' literary histories.   
The case of Isvara Dasa's Caitanya bhagavat is a good example, but  
not one that is even hinted in the Gaudiya Vaisnava mainstream,  
especially notable given the figures ostensibly present and the  
incredible prolixity of the GV writers in both Bengali and Sanskrit.

Please note also that I had posted this to you personally and had not  
intended it to appear on the entire Indology listserv since it seemed  
to be one of information rather than debate.  So, apologies to the  
listserv.

All the best,
tony
