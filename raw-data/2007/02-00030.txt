I forgot to mention that my paper was published in:
Transactions of the International Conference of Eastern Studies, No. 50 
(2005): 28-66, Tokyo: The Toho Gakkai (The Institute of Eastern Culture), 
December 2005.  This is not mentioned in the PDF, which reproduces pp. 28-66 
of the publication.

Quoting Michael Witzel <witzel at FAS.HARVARD.EDU>:

>Incidentally,  if some things were said about the F-S-W paper at 
Madison in October 2005(?), this has not reached my ears yet. The only  
thing in writing  so far is a rather polemic paper by my friend  A. 
Parpola, his talk at Tokyo in June 2005, where I was present. There was 
NO time for discussion! We did that a few weeks later, in his, M. 
Kenoyer's, Steve's and my  presence, at Kyoto.  A good defense for the 
"script" model did not emerge. Kenoyer conceded that the Indus signs do 
not represent written language (like sentences)  but he still called 
them a 'script' ...

A PDF file of my paper is available at the following internet address:
http://www.helsinki.fi/~aparpola/tices_50.pdf 

In the paper I analyze all the arguments of the Farmer-Sproat-Witzel paper 
and find them inconclusive. To what extent I succeeded in defending the 
"script" model and to what extent the paper is polemic is of course not for 
me but for the readers to judge.
