Dear Arlo Griffiths,

thank you very much indeed for your reference which supports the 
assumption, that the picture of something climbing up a tree is involved 
here (if dhavI is dhava and not a corruption of something else like 
padavI, as Ashok Aklujkar suggested).
Still: the dhava in the LAkSAsUkta is mentioned as a tree amongst 
others. The plant I am looking for has to be a very prominent one, a 
vanaspati, or one that is extraordinary auspicious and hard to reach, as 
the goals of the anekAntazAsana in Vidyanandins eyes excel those of 
every other doctrine.

Thanks again

Himal Trikha
