Subject: Vedic Unicode Proposal
Message-ID: <161227080156.23782.15740407255536769124.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Vedic Scholars,
	With the collaboration of a team of scholars, Michael Everson and I  
have prepared a proposal to the Unicode Consortium to revise the  
Unicode Standard to include characters necessary for encoding Vedic  
Sanskrit.  We presented the proposal to the Working Group 2 committee  
in Frankfurt in April and, after gathering comments by the general  
community of scholars, plan to present it to the Unicode Technical  
Committee at their meeting beginning 6 August.  Please review the  
proposal and send your comments.  If you would like to be included in  
a discussion list concerning the proposal please indicate so.  The  
proposal is located at the following sites:

http://sanskritlibrary.org/VedicUnicode/
where it may be navigated to from the main Sanskrit Library site
http://sanskritlibrary.org

It is also posted at:

http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3235.pdf

We are eager to get Vedic characters included in the Unicode Standard  
and look forward to your comments and contributions.  We are  
particularly interested in evidence of the marking of Vedic  
characters in scripts other than Devanagari.  Scholars familiar with  
Vedic in other Indic scripts are kindly requested to indicate by  
reference to the code charts at the end of our proposal whether a  
character there is also used in a particular script or not or if a  
different character is used instead.  A digital image and reference  
accompanying such comments would be particularly helpful.  Comments  
and evidence by surface mail are also welcome at the address below.   
Please send email comments directly to me at Scharf at brown.edu.
	Yours sincerely,
	Peter Scharf
