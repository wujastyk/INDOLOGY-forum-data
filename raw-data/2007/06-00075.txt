There is a short article by me:

"A Good Story Spoiled. Tulas?d?sa's Rendering of the V?lm?ki   
Ramayana ", in Corolla Torontonensis. Studies in Honour of  Ronald  
Morton Smith, ed. by Emmet Robbins and Stella Sandahl, Toronto 1994,  
p.199-224.

I am afraid this article offended some Tulsidas enthusiasts.
