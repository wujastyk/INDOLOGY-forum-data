I use Baraha software, which, I believe, does just what you describe in your note.  I find that it integrates seamlessly with MSword, though there are some font issues (Arial Unicode helps here).

Such software would give users a common platform for efficiently typing Sanskrit from a Romanized (English) keyboard directly into MSWord. Users would be able to do so in Devanagari or transliteration, or by toggling from one to the other. My hope is to distribute such a package free of cost over the internet and, in doing so, create a common platform for all who create full or part-Sanskrit documents, publish them, or simply use them. Academic or student, mystic or pragmatist, Westerner or Indian, if someone has MSWord, they'll be able to use what I envision. "
