Subject: More oil on the fire?

At the risk of putting more oil on an already 
raging fire (indeed, so far the water which might 
have quenched it seems to have spread it even 
further), I might just mention a perhaps 
interesting book which sits almost entirely 
unread on my shelf:

Christopher Hale, Himmler's Crusade: The True 
Story of the 1938 Nazi Expedition into Tibet 
(Bantam)

The main story concerns Ernst Sch?fer, but in my 
very quick glance I did notice a most 
uncomplimentary discussion of Sven Hedin (who 
was, of course, not German). If nothing else, the 
book has some interesting photos which I, at 
least, had not seen before. Moreover, there is a 
discussion of the film _Geheinmis Tibet_, which 
as far as I know is not now publically available, 
although I would be delighted to learn that I am 
wrong about this.

The above, of course, may have nothing whatsoever to do with German Indology...
