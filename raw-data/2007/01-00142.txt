If I understood the problem correctly, 1 semester of obligatory Sanskrit + 2
/ 4 semesters of Hindi could not be fitted into the loan framework of the
Statens Laanekasse, which gives loans to students. Courses have to be
standardized, and not exceed a certain length. The Chinese department
managed to get around this rule so that students can do basic Chinese in
three years instead of one year (but I don't remember the details here). 

Norwegian students get a loan plus a stipend, but they are required to
finish their courses within a previously determined timeframe, and the
university/Laanekasse are very strict. No "eternal students" allowed.
Standardized time applies.
