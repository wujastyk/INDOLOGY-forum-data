I just received a posting on the list for CORMOSEA (Committee on Research Materials on Southeast Asia) to the effect that the American Library Association has just posted a Foreign Book Dealers Directory.  The message criticized the list for leaving out whole countries and on the other hand including publishers who weren't also booksellers.  The India list is useful.  One dealer included whom I certainly should have included in my first posting is Prabhu Book Service in Gurgaon, outside of Delhi.
