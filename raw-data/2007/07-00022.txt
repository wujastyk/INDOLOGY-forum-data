Dear Tim, 
  As only a minor contribution to an answer: since its origin in 1868, the EPHE has a unique place in the French system of higher education, cf.: 
  http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27&Itemid=60
  and for the sections that are relevant for Indology, although they cover much more: 
  http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=163&Itemid=259
  and 
  http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=164&Itemid=244
  Internationally, as an institute of research and education, it can perhaps be compared, somewhat, with SOAS of the University of London (est. in 1916) and with the Institute of Humanistic Studies (est. in 1929, originally only for sinological studies, now for the study of the world's cultures and societies) at Kyoto University. 
  Best, 
  Jan

  Can anyone comment on the significance for Indology, and for the EPHE in
particular -- if any -- of the mooted reforms of the French university
system described in the latest Economist?

See:

The article refers at length to the policies of Val?rie P?cresse, one
of the officials designated to receive our letters of protest. How
might the EPHE figure in all of this?
