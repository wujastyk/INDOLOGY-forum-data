Dear collegues,

I just learned that K. Venugopalan passed away the day
before yesterday. 

K. Venugopalan worked for many years on the  "Sanskrit
Dictionary Based on Historical Principals" in the
Deccan College in Pune. He was a collaborator of the
Ecole fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient and assisted many
Western and Japanese scholars or students, who will 
remember his kindness and generosity, his sense of
humor, and especially his unflagging enthusiasm for
all fields of "saastric litterature. He was currently
working on an edition and translation of Sucarita
Mi?sra's commentary on the "Slokavaarttika, the
Kaa"sikaa.
