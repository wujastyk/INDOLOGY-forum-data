No, it is "Franckesche", because that designation goes 
back to the name of August Hermann Francke, one of the 
foremost theologians of the pietist movement in German 
protestantism. See e.g. the Wikipedia entry
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Hermann_Francke

Anyway, thanks for the information.
