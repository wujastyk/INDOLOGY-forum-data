Dear Jean-Luc,

Sorry. Being on a short lecture tour at present, I could not so far
acknowledge your most interesting post. Rarely does one come across such
clearly matching instances of an ancient discussion regarding a short word
or relatively minor linguistic detail. Thanks for sharing your knowledge
with me. When I return to my home library, I will read the precise
translation of the precious passage to which you kindly refer.

With best wishes,

ashok
