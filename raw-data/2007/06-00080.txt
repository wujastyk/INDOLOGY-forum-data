This may be of interest to the many on this list interested in cross-cultural studies. The New Delhi office of the Library of Congress has just announced to participants in its Cooperative Acquisitions Program that it is offering to distribute this journal:

"1. Title:               Yavanika: Indo-Hellenic Studies
Publisher:              Indian Society for Greek and Roman Studies,
Bareilly, India 
Frequency:              Annual
Issues in hand:         No.10, 2000
Subscription:      INR300.00=$7.45
Language:               English
 

Indian Society for Greek and Roman Studies (ISGARS) under the Department of
Ancient History and Culture of the M.U.P. Rohilkhand University (R.U.) in
Bareilly has been extremely active in the promotion of Greek Studies in
India. Among the Society's activities are a postgraduate studies course on
Greek History and Civilisation, seminars on ancient and modern Greek and the
publication of the annual edition of "Yavanika" on the interaction between
the Hellenic and Indian civilisations. The journal aims to publish scholarly
papers, bibliographical surveys, review articles, comments and letters on
current research by scholars from all over the world. The issue in hand is a
tribute to the 'spirit of the Olympics' and some of the articles in this
issue are: 1)The spirit of Olympic; 2)Greek Athletics among Indian Ascetics:
A Common Ground; 3)Olympism, Its Idealism and Aspiration of the Greeks;
4)Plea for the Olympic Games to be Permanently Held in Greece etc.  

Production quality: Printing, paper and production quality is good."

LC will be subscribing.  The journal began in 1991 but LC never received but v. 1-2 (1991-1992).  I am seeking a clarification about whether publication was continuous or not, and asking the office to get intervening volumes if there were any.
