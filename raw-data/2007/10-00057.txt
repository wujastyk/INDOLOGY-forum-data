The Wellcome Centre for the History of Medicine at University College 
London (UCL) has faculty and resources relating to Asia, including South 
Asia, and it has a close working relationship with the Wellcome Library, 
that houses thousands of Sanskrit manuscripts and has a fine Sanskrit 
printed book collection.  UCL is located in Bloomsbury, in easy walking 
distance of the British Library, the Royal Asiatic Society, SOAS, the 
Warburg Institute, the British Museum, and many other institutions.

"[The Centre] invites applications from prospective MPhil/PhD students for 
3 years commencing September 2008. Candidates should normally have a 
Masters degree in a relevant subject. The Centre anticipates being able to 
offer two or three research studentships worth c. ?19,000 pa plus the 
payment of "home" fees.  Students from outside the EU are encouraged to 
apply but should arrange to discuss the possible impact of "overseas" 
student fees being charged. Applications to study without a scholarship 
are also welcome. The Centre also supports PhD students applying with 
other funding bodies like AHRC, Wellcome Trust, UCL."
