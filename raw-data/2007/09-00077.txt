I think these following books would be helpful for the subject:
1. Vasistha as religious conciliator by R.N Dandekar
2. The Visvamitra and the Aasistha: an exhustive historical study: Vedic and post-vedic by Umesh Chandra Sharma

Thank you,

Dear Scholars,

A colleague is interested in the approximate date of VasiSTha (RAma's
teacher). What is the current thinking on the date of VasiSTha? Are there
any relevant papers, books on this subject?

Thankyou in anticipation,
