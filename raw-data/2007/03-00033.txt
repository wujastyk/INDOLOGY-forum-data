Subject: Question on panchatantra
Message-ID: <161227079720.23782.9343990303511334792.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Sergei F.Oldenburg in his "Buddiyskiya legendy" (Buddhist legends"; SPb., 1894)produced literary rendering of several
"judgement stories from Vikramodaya" (pp.136-140); a version of Solomonic judgement is treated on pp. 137-138. In the brief foreword to the whole chapter (pp.136-137)Oldenburg says that this work of unknown author is represented by a single MS in India Office Library (No 1957); there is also its Marathi version in 18 parts: Haridas. Vikramacaritra. Bombay, 1863 (Shaka 1785)(British Museum Library, Mar.327). He mentions also the English translation of Vikramacaritra: "Vickram Caritra, or Adventures of Vickramadetea, king of Oujein. Translated from the Prakrit poem of Hurridass into the English language by Ragoba Moroba. Bombay, 1855 (British Museum Library, Mar.327). See also: Aryan an. Early Ideas. A group of Hindoo stories collected and collated.London, 1881 (Chapter VII, The adventures of Vickramaditya, king of Oujein. Pp. 131-141)".
S.F.Oldenburg warnes the reader that Ragoba Moroba omitted in his translation everything that, in his opinion, "bordered on immorality or indecency", so this translation should be used with caution.
Hope this may help
