Dear Colleagues,

Some of you might have noticed that our server was down over the  
weekend.  It is up again, and we have an improved version of our  
Newsletter, no. 3, with some bug-fixes.  (Thanks for the comments  
that led to corrections.)  Some might want to download it again.

The files can be accessed from:

http://www.uni-hamburg.de/fachbereiche-einrichtungen/indologie/ngmcp/ 
newsletter_e.html

or if the site has not been updated, one can obtain the PDF files  
directly from:

http://134.100.72.204:3000/newsletter/ngmcpnl3_light.pdf
(about 1.7 MB, with low resolution graphics for onscreen viewing and  
printing at home/office)

http://134.100.72.204:3000/newsletter/ngmcpnl3.pdf
(about 7 MB, with high resolution graphics)

In a few weeks, hardcopies of Newsletter 3 will be ready.  We will  
send a copy to anyone who requests one.  Requests should be addressed  
to kengo.harimoto at uni-hamburg.de (DO NOT reply to this message; it  
will be posted to INDOLOGY.)
