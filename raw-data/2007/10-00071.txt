Of course, niira is a well-known borrowing from Dravidian niir.  Tamil  
niir means nature, property, as well as water.  The word niirmai  
(water-ness) means "property of water, as coolness" according to the  
Lex.  Thus, the Niiraa might well have been named for its cooling  
properties, always invoked in Tamil and other southern (Maharashtra is  
in South India, isn't it?) languages.  George Hart
