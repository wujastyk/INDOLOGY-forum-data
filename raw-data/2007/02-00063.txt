The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (http://www.iep.utm.edu/) is requesting
article submissions on Indian Philosophy.

Founded in 1995 and run by an international board of editors, the IEP is open to
articles written by professionally trained philosophers and scholars of South
Asian thought.  Indian philosophy submissions that supersede the expertise of
the Acting Area Editor for Indian philosophy (the bulk of submissions) are
subject to the approval of blind, anonymous referees who are expert in the
relevant field. The IEP currently receives approximately 3,000 hits per day,
with the greatest percentage coming from university students. Unlike most
printed philosophy reference works, the IEP is continually revised and updated.

For an unexhaustive list of desired articles and articles under production in
Indian philosophy, please see

For more information on submissions, please see

or contact Shyam Ranganathan (Acting Area Editor, Indian Philosophy IEP):
