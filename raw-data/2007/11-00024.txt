I am sorry to share with members of the list news of the death, on 
August 21, of Walter Harding Maurer, Professor Emeritus of Sanskrit, 
University of Hawaii. He was the author of a critical edition of the 
/SugamAnvayA V.rtti/, a commentary in Jaina Sanskrit on the MeghadUta 
(1965, based on his 1962 doctoral dissertation at the University of 
Pennsylvania), /Pinnacles of India's Past/, translations of selections 
from the .Rgveda (1986), and  /The Sanskrit Language: An Introductory 
Grammar and Reader /(1995). He was, in recent years, engaged in 
translating selections from the Atharvaveda. A polyglot, he was 
dedicated to spreading among students what he liked to call the 
/Bacillus Sanscriticus.
