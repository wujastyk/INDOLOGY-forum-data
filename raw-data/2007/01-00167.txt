*THE QUESTION*
Is there a connection between "German indology" of the National Socialist era 
(1933-1945) and "the German government and its disastrous ideology of the 'pure 
Aryan race'", and if so, where is the *EVIDENCE* for it?

[Henceforth referred to as *THE QUESTION* and *EVIDENCE*]

The above wording (in inverted commas) is Jan Houben's, but *THE QUESTION* 
itself harks back to Sheldon Pollock's "Deep Orientalism?..." (1993), where it is 
answered strongly in the affirmative. However, as I have tried to show in a recent 
article (see below), Pollock's discourse is based on conviction, not on *EVIDENCE* 
- a point which necessarily weakens the position of all those who have built their 
own argument on Pollock's discourse.

THE ASYMMETRY OF THE DEBATE

The misunderstanding characterizing the debate between Jan Houben and me is 
indeed a fundamental one. I have addressed it in various contributions, but

my point still hasn't come across, and therefore I'd like to repeat it briefly:

Our present debate was indirectly triggered by my contribution to the Festschrift 
Gustav Roth (2006), entitled: "Von der Indologie zum V?lkermord ? die 
Kontinuit?tskonstrukte Sheldon Pollocks und seiner Epigonen im Lichte ihrer
