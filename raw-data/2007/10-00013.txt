Subject: upanisads and plato
Message-ID: <161227081295.23782.7183386251431528155.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hello all dear colleagues

In the course of a modification in my former research (Asceticism in India 
and Porphyry), I am looking now for the actual status quo of the theme, or 
who is working on,  the comparition between the upanisads dialogues and 
those of Plato, any suggestion? thank you very much and all the 
best........Olivia
