Pl. look also under such terms as puraa-kalpa (standing for a period of
creation in some contexts and for a text or branch/complex of texts in
certain others). I would expect the concept to come from the
Dharma-suutra/;saastra tradition and the Miimaa.saa into the hermeneutics of
Puraa.nas. So, checking sources such as P.V. Kane's -History of
Dharma-;saastra_ under kalpa may also be rewarding.
