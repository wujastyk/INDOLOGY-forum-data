Dear Colleagues--

Apologies for cross posting.

In preparation for the upcoming AAR meeting, I wanted to forward on  
the list of the Yoga Consultation sessions for this year (see below).  
We have three sessions, two on the AAR program and one on the DANAM  
program. The Saturday session focuses on the new Yoga volume in the  
Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy edited by Gerald Larson. Sunday  
afternoon sessions include one on Hindu texts in North America  
(cosponsored) and one that will examine Fred Smith's new book on  
Possession.

We welcome everyone to attend the sessions, and encourage people to  
stick around for the business meeting after Saturday's session.

Best Wishes,
Stuart
