It is amazing to see how the Digital Library of India is missing the one volume that I am looking for, but has several other ones.  Thanks, Dominik.

The Digital Library of India has digitized several issues of the journal, 
but not the one you mention, I think, Madhav.  The DLI is at

 	http://www.dli.ernet.in

and there's an increasing amount of indological material there.  Quite 
astounding, really.  The cataloguing is diabolical, so one needs to use 
a lot of imagination in searching.


The issues they have digitized are:

The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Sri_Rangam_Volume_2.,
   2990100066301. Saveros Pau. 1940. multi. SOCIAL SCIENCES. 360 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Sri_Rangam_Volume_4.,
   2990100066302. Saveros Pau. 1941. multi. SOCIAL SCIENCES. 686 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Vol_1_1939., 2040130049044.
   Balasubrahmanyam. 1939. Multi. . 371 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Vol_1_1939., 2040130066303.
   Balasubrahmanyam. 1939. Multi. . 371 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Vol_2_1940-41., 2040130049045.
   Balasubrahmanyam. 1940. Multi. . 529 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Vol_2_1940-41., 2040130066304.
   Balasubrahmanyam. 1940. Multi. . 529 pgs.

Best,
Dominik

I found the same also at the library of the Bhandarkar Institute in Pune.  I am looking for the copy of the Tattvakaustubha itself.  I have a photocopy of the BORI mss of Tattvakaustubha, but would like to see the printed version.  More rare are the mss of Bhattojikuttana composed by at least three different Maadhva authors.  These are cited by various authors, but I would like to see the mss if possible.
