The translation I have is one by Chandra Rajan, of Vishnu Sharma's 
Pancatantra. Unfortunately it has no index.
Looking over the story titles in the table of contents, I don't see anything 
like the story you inquire of here. Suggest that you check this motif in
Thompson, Stith. 1989. MOTIF-INDEX OF FOLK-LITERATURE, and also Stith 
Thompson and Jonas Balys, Oral Tales of India. Bloomington, IN: Indiana 
University Press, 1958.

A fellow scholar asked me to post this here:

Dean Anderson

      I am doing important folklore-related research and need to learn some 
details about a story in the Panchatantra.  I have only read a summary of it 
in another book and have not yet been able to find a full English 
translation.  According to the summary I read, two women are traveling 
together with their infants.  While asleep in a forest, a wolf kills one of 
the babies, and the mother swaps the corpse for the other?s child while the 
latter is still asleep.  A dispute ensues, and the women appear at the court 
of Gopicandra, where they present their case.  A wise parrot advises that 
the disputed child be cut in half.  The true mother objects. This reveals 
the authenticity of her claim, and she is awarded the child.

The reference that was given for the story is   Vikramodaya, No. 14 in 
Hertel?s Panchatantra (1914), 154.   However, this reference appears to be 
inaccurate; and I have not been able to find a version of this story in any 
of the English translations that I?ve looked through.
