Subject: Use of Devanagari for Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227081187.23782.16321694249767033057.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

To what extent was Devanagari viewed as
somehow "transregional" even before the
introduction of printing? If, as I suspect,
it had been, then this may have driven
the decision to favor it in Sanskrit printed
editions.
