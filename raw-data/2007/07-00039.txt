This presentation examines a Sanskrit philosopher from 17th century Bengal, Gadadhara Bhattacharya. Gadadhara is major figure in Navya-Nyaya (New Logic) philosophy. Wright attempts to provide an intellectual history of Gadadhara by contextualizing his writing in relation to Sanskrit authors in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition as well as in relation to socio-political events of 17th century Bengal. Within these contexts, he concludes that Gadadhara is arguing against the efficacy of bhakti (devotionalism) as a political and soteriological project.
