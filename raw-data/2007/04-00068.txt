 Dear colleagues,

The chapter "The Satiric Doodlebug: Astrologers Astray" on pages 181-186 in Lee Siegel: Laughing Matters (reprint of the 1. ed. Chicago 1987), Delhi etc.: Motilal Banarsidass, 1989, refers to a number of satiric depictions of astrologers in Niilaka.n.tha Diik.sita's Kalivi.dambana, Somedeva's Kathaasaritsaagara, Ve;nka.taadhvarin's Vi"svagu.naadar"sa, K.semendra's Kalaavilaasa, his Narmamaala, and in Jagadii"svara's Haasyaar.nava. 

Siegel mentions a supposedly wise astrologer in the Kalaavilaasa, who is "so busy 'calculating astrological forecasts by examining the position of the moon and the planets in the heavens, that he does not realize that his wife is balling every creep in town' (Kalaavilaasa 9.6)".

Regards,
Philipp
