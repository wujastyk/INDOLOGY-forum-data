Dear Dominik
Trying to do it myself, I sent an email to this address you supplied (below)
but it bounced:    HYPERLINK
"mailto:indologycomittee at liverpool.ac.uk"indologycomittee at liverpool.ac.uk  .

 Is there something that needs correcting on this address? I tried using the
Subscriber's Corner but it's no help at all--quite opaque as to what to do.


Thanks for any help--
Joanna Kirkpatrick

Dear friends and colleagues,

I started up this discussion forum, on Friday 23rd November, 1990, and I
administered it single-handed for many years, until it was closed on
Wednesday 18 April, 2001.

When the new INDOLOGY forum opened on Thursday 12 July, 2001, it was no
longer managed by me, and it was run on different, more formal lines.
There is a committee that is in charge of the INDOLOGY forum, and although I
am currently a member of the committee, I am by no means in charge, and I
just take turns to be on duty, along with every one else.

If you need to change or update your mailing-list settings, update your
email address, etc., please don't write to me personally about it.  The
place to write is the committee, at

   indologycomittee at liverpool.ac.uk

I do feel quite touched when I receive personal requests for your account
settings to be changed, since it's a reminder of the old days when INDOLOGY
was my sole charge.  But I just can't keep up, and it isn't my business
anyhow, except in my periodic duty days.  So I would be grateful if you
would use the email address above for all admin matters.

You can change almost any aspect of your subscription all by yourself, if
you wish.  Go to the website

   HYPERLINK
"http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/archives/"http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/archives/

and click on "Subscriber's Corner".

There's online help, but also a Users' Guide here: HYPERLINK

Warmest wishes of the season,

Dominik
