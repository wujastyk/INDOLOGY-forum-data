In his account of India, Al-Biruni (973-1048) says 
somewhere that the Veda has only recently been put into 
written form, and that the Indians generally prefer oral 
transmission. I don't have the reference at hand, but it 
should be easily located in Sachau's translation.

I think, the "Oupnekhat" (or rather Sirr-e akbar), i.e. 
the Persian translation of the Upanishads has to be 
mentioned here.

Hope it helps
