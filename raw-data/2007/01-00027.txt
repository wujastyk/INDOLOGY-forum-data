Jan, if you mean this serious, then I fail to
understand why you are referring to the myths
created by "Deep Orientalism" and by papers of
others' along such lines as almost dogmatically
true? In light of Gruenendahl's latest study on
the subject, not much remains of the accusations
put forward there. In fact, he debunks them as
myths in a meticulously sober, scholarly manner.

Before the issue is being carried on any further
in the way it just seems to be getting started, I
strongly recommend first to study Gruenendahl's
arguments closely, and only then revert to this
subject in the present Sanskrit context, or leave
it.
