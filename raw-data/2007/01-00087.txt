Subject: A question concerning the proposal to shut down the previous              thread
Message-ID: <161227079190.23782.12556181523198763559.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

(My pending replies to the thread in question will follow soon, provided it will not be 
shut down.)


George Hart, Rosane Rocher, Matthew Kapstein and Herman Tull have argued that 
the issues discussed in the thread on indology and "the disastrous ideology of the 
'pure Aryan race'" "has been sufficiently explored in this list" (Hart).

Far be it from me to cast doubt on the wisdom of those whom I consider examples 
of what detached scholarship really means. But according to the general 
conventions of academic debate, an issue is considered "sufficiently explored" when 
it has reached a point where a decision can be made.

May I therefore as the respected champions of this courageous proposal whether 
they now consider Jan Houben's claim of a connection between indology and "the 
disastrous ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'" as valid or invalid?

(Or may I take it from their eventual silence to my humble request that they prefer 
not to bring this issue to the point of decision?)
