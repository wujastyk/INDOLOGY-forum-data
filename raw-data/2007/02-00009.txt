Subject: Bhattoji Diksita's Tattvakaustubha
Message-ID: <161227079484.23782.1733797264059642648.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Shri Pandurangi,

     I do have a copy of the Tattvakaustubhakulisa by Setumadhavacarya.  I was in Bangalore two weeks ago visiting Prof. K.T. Pandurangi and he showed me a copy of the -Kulisa.  I found the same also at the library of the Bhandarkar Institute in Pune.  I am looking for the copy of the Tattvakaustubha itself.  I have a photocopy of the BORI mss of Tattvakaustubha, but would like to see the printed version.  More rare are the mss of Bhattojikuttana composed by at least three different Maadhva authors.  These are cited by various authors, but I would like to see the mss if possible.

Madhav M. Deshpande
