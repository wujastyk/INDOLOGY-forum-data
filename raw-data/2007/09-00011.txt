Subject: help tracing a verse
Message-ID: <161227081078.23782.15769214418510316825.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am trying to remember a verse that begins with "kAle varSatu parjanyaH pRthivI sasyazAlinI".  If someone remembers the rest of it and possibly its reference, I would appreciate the help.  Thanks.
