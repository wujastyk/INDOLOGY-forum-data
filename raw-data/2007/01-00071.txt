         Subject: Companion to Digital Humanities online

I'm pleased to announce that the complete text of _A Companion to
Digital Humanities_, ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth
(Oxford: Blackwell, 2004) is now freely available online, at http://
www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/ -- please forward this
announcement to other lists and communities who may be interested in
the news.  Thanks very much to Blackwell for agreeing to this
arrangement, and to Jonathan Gorman of the UIUC libraries (and the
UIUC Gradaute School of Library and Information Science) for
modifying XTF (from the California Digital Library) so that it works
with the Blackwell DTD.  The editors encourage you to consider buying
the paperback when it comes out in the fall of 2007.  Also, if you
spot typos or other errors in the text, please send them to

John Unsworth
