Thank you very much, dear George, and thanks also to Reinhold  
Gr?nendahl, Toke Lindegaard-Knudsen, Walter Slaje and Christophe  
Vielle for off-list responses.

This must be the passage concealed by Bhattacharyya's reference to  
".Rgvedabhaa.syaanukrama.nii 8.1". I will try to track down one of  
the existing editions, none of which is available in Leiden.

Best greetings,

Arlo
