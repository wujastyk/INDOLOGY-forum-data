Chinese as I know I are not good at programming, surely not as
some Indians who are often on the peak at least in the
programming area I know about. Chinese software  bussines is
basically just following, never leading. The whole culture is based
on enormously complicated script that is just a heavy bag in the
software development. It is great for caligraphy or poetry but not for
the information processing as we know it from the current IT.
