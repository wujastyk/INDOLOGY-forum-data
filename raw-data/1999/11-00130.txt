I always tell myslef that I wouldn't be provoked to write a response to
some of these tall pronouncements but here i go again. although i will be
extremely brief.

What is this about true buddhism? where did you learn your history? Or is
this an obsession with purity.
How many vegetarians are there who would not blink an eyelid at killing
people if not animals.
In your eyes it seems that lanka properly belongs to the land of the
mlechhas, beyond the pale of indic civilization. why dont you come out
and just say that instead of all this compassion bit and buddhism has to
be understood only properly in the indian element. Then why was it kicked
out of india...>
