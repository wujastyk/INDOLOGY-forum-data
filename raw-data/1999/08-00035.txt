Subject: how are tithis counted?
Message-ID: <161227051467.23782.12446717021779923356.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

As a consequence of computer dating some 500 South Indian inscriptions I am
interested to know whether scholars are in the habit of assuming that the
tithi mentioned in historical texts is considered to be necessarily the one
that is in force at dawn (6 a.m.).
        What do members think? Do you adopt the dawn tithi as the one that
is in force for that entire day, or do you look to the tithi that might
have come into action later in the day?
