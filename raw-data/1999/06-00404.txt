There was a relative decline in social status of the
sangam era bards with time- KaaLamEkam sings "pANarkkuc collvatum tai"
indicating that pANars(bards) have become tailors. Also, there are groups
nowadays going by the title "narambu kaTTi". Could be vestiges of
ancient pANar.

When there is a break in tradition, new meanings are imported
by changing "r" to "R". Read R. P. Sethu Pillai, Urum Perum
where RPS describes how "maraik kADu" (deer forest) was
changed to "maRaik kADu" which is rendered as "vEdAraNyam".
Similar to "yAzh muri" changing to "yAzh muRi".

A humorous change within Tamil itself. Tevaram sings the
Goddess of a town as "yAzhaip pazhitta moziyAL" (veenavAdavidhuushani).
Over time, "yaazhaip pazhittAL" transforms to "vAzhaippazhattAL".
A naivedhya ritual was started to offer bananas (vAzhaip pazham)
to the Goddess. Like saltless offering at Oppiliyappan temple
taking him to be "uppu ili" (without salt).
