Subject: Peacocks and Poison--one last time
Message-ID: <161227047413.23782.10428478945395458267.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I tried to post this qualification earlier, but it did not make it to
Indology.  In my haste this morning I simplified the issue of the peacock's
ingesting poison too much--I had in mind only the notion of its eating
poison plants, which is not present in the passage (MBh 12.120.4-16).  But
the fifteenth zloka refers to snakes and enemies that are enraged and
"overly venomous."  The notion of the peacock's consuming venomous snakes
is, of course, relevant to the question.
