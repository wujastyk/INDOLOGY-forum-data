OK. But let me start with Hittite. Hittite has the action noun suffix
-tar. Traces of this suffix is found in Vedic (see Burrows, p. 118ff).
The suffix is then given the thematic vowel while loosing its guna vowel,
producing -tra-. In skt. you will find the suffix in nouns like: atra
(food), kartra (spell), vastra (garment), shrotra (hearing), suutra
(tread) and mantra (which has been discussed recently on this list). In
Latin you have aratrum (plow) and feretrum (?). I can only give one Greek
word: metron (me = skt. maa = measure). I am quite certain that there are
more words in Greek and Latin with the suffix, but I haven't got the
dictionaries I need to check this. However, if you look up a reverse
Latin or Greek dictionary (I believe they exist) you should be able to
find the relevant words quite quickly (look for words ending in -tron or
-trum). Sorry I haven't got more to offer.
