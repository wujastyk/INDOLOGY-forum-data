Subject: Tenets, anyone?
Message-ID: <161227050889.23782.16889845424026020574.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I would appreciate any information on recent work (past five years or so)
on Tibetan Buddhist Tenets (grub mtha') or, more specifically, on the Four
Seals
(phyag rgya bzhi) -- theses, publications, anything.

My PhD research, recently begun, involves a critical, comparative analysis
of these foundational propositions from the Madhyamika viewpoint.  However,
I am
interested in work relating to the treatment by any of the 'four' schools
of Tenets of the philosophical issues contained within and/or implied by
the phyag rgy -- especially the first (All compounded/produced phenonmena
are impermanent).  I am particularly interested in:

causation/dependent origination
time/permanence/impermanence
ontology
Buddhist logic (esp. the catuskoti)

Any suggestions as to not-to-be-overlooked comparative (East-West)
scholarship also would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Pamela Lyon
