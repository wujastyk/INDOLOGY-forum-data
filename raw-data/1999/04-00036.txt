Where does the kXl come from? 
kulame = firepit (Ka.); kole.l = smithy (Kota); holu = fireplace (Kuwi); ole =
hearth (Kod.agu)

How does an ancient smith represent a razor he has produced for trade?
qole = razor (Maltese); hola'd (Santali)

There are similar sounding words in his parole, which can be depicted
pictorially.
qoli = tail (Maltese)
ko_r.a = a shoot, first sprout (Kui); ko_le = a stump or stump of corn (Te.)
See the inscribed Ravi phase (3300 BC) sherd at slide 121:

"The origins of Indus writing can now be traced to the Ravi Phase 
(c.3300-2800 BC) at Harappa. Some inscriptions were made on the bottom 
of the pottery before firing. Other inscriptions such as this one were made
after firing. This inscription (c. 3300 BC) appears to be three 
plant symbols arranged to appear almost anthropomorphic. The trident looking
projections on these symbols seem to set the foundation for later symbols such
as those seen in 131." (Kenoyer and Meadow, Feb. 99)

When a tail of an antelope is shown on many inscriptions, it is
orthographically altered to depict a sprout, apparently to emphasise 
that what is being shown in the bill of lading is a razor.
