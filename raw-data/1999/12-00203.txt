Subject: CARB character set
Message-ID: <161227054502.23782.4006202052320821217.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A week or so ago I announced plans to create CARB fonts to supplement the
existing Norman and CSX+ ones. CARB stands for Character/Accent RagBag,
and the fonts are intended to contain whatever weird accented characters
people need that aren't available in Norman or CSX+.

I attach to this message a draft definition of the new character set. It
contains 86 characters. When people have had a chance to comment, I shall
make any changes that seem appropriate, build the fonts (PC only to start
with), and make them available from my web/ftp site.
