Subject: Mount Potalaka in Malaya mountains
Message-ID: <161227046187.23782.340800992864455990.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Shu Hikosaka cites TaiyU GotO's Kanzeon Bosatsu no KenkyU (A Study
of Avalokitezvara Bodhisattava), p. 191, and says,
"Chin-sheng (ChishO, 688-740 A.D.) of T'ang dynasty has also
 mentioned that Malaya country is near the Potalaka mountain which
 is the place of Avalokitezvara."

 Can an Indologist reading Japanese check Daiyu Goto's book
 to inform whether Chin-Sheng talks about Mt. Potalaka?
 Does he write that Mt. Potalaka is in the Malaya country?

 Regards,
 N. Ganesan

 PS: Also, interested in the approximate date/century of
 the Malaya mountain chapter in Hsuan Tsang. - NG
