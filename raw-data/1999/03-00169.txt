Yes. Kannada change of p to h is during the historic period, i.e 10th
century. It cannot be a borrowing from Kannada. Burrow in Dravidian Studies
VII traced
Skt. kalanka- (51), kalaha (54), kalaapa (56) to the group of forms to be
reconstructed as *kal-a (DEDR 1303, 1299). In the last chapter of Sanskrit
Lanaguge, he added Skt. kalu.sa- to this group. Ta. kalaavu, kalaay 'to be
displeased, to get angry, quarrel' have a long derivative vowel which looks
to an underlying laryngeal *kal-aH-wu/-y, in which case h in kalaha- could
be a reflex of a PD laryngeal. Only Old Tamil has long -aa in the derivative
syllable. I have to look for parallel loan words with h preserved in Skt.
pa.taha- (186) is the other in Borrow'a list, but I cannot see anything to
support a laryngeal there.There are several alleged borrowings in Skt. with
aspirated stops corresponding to unaspirated ones in Drav.

Gondi -h <-s is a kind of causative suffix; ND x is a regular development of
PD *k when not followed by high front vowels.

I wrote a full-fledged paper on PD laryngeal; it surfaces as aaydam  (a
h-type of sound)in Early Tamil and as h in some of the other Dravidian lgs.
Prof. Witzel, see if you can get hold of  a copy of PILC Journal of Dravidic
Studies 7:1 (1997; actually out in 1998 March).(PILC=Pondicherry Inst of Lg
and Culture).

Possible via MIA

I think *kal represents several homophonous roots giving rise to different
groups of words: 'noise' (1302), 'mix, join' (1299), 'learn'(1297), 'stone'
(1298),'to accrue, grow' (1300, 1310), 'disturb, agitate,stir up, quarrel'
(1303)[both Skt. kalaha- and kalu.sa- seem to belong here].

>Last point : if kala- is onomatopoetic, the Tamil etc word kalApa 'peacock
>feather/tail ' may, just may be a loan translation from Munda where

Burrow (1948) gives the meaning 'bundle' as the basis of semantic connection
with 'peacock's tail' and compares it with Ta. Ma. Ka. kalappu'collection of
things, mass' etc.(1299).
