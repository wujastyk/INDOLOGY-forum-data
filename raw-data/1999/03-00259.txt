Hi,
A nice picture is at:
http://www.deer.rr.ualberta.ca/library/taxonomy/onager.html
The early solid-wheeled chariot of Sumer is drawn by an onager.

I would appreciate guidance on predicting the ancient form, say of ca. 3000 BC
in Rajasthan, of the related lexemes. CDIAL 4054 has gardabha (Skt.). DEDR
1364 has Parji gade, garad; Gondi ga_r.di; Kuwi ga_r.de; Te. ga_d.ida; Ta.
kar..utai

Is the consonantal change k>g or g>k?

Thanks. 
Kalyanaraman
