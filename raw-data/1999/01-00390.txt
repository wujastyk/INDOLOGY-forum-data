There is indeed a reference to tuLu nATu in Classical Tamil literature.

Translation:

Like the tulu country with groves which belong to the kOcar who hold truth as
their ornaments, and where peacocks, that have plumage with patterns like the
eyes of the drums, eat the fruits of balsam-pear (momordica charantia)
ripening at the tip....
