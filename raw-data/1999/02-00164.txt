Translation:

Since English is rapidly
becoming the default
world language, why not
try to rationalize
its spelling?  Wouldn't that
benefit more people than
merely introducing
Roman script for Indian
languages?  Besides spelling,
English unnecessarily has
upper and lower cases
(why is "Y" different from "y"?)
and can't distinguish between
long and short vowels.

I'll help you if you try.

Yours benevolently,


Raja.
