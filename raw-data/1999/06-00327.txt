Subject: Aurobindo about Advaita

I agree with Edwin. Only after the Brits, advaita grew in a popular
level to suit the nationalist agendas. Advaita's rise can be seen
in one example: Kanchi Kamakoti Math. This math seems to have
origins only in the Tanjore Maratha (British) period. Despite claims
to a hoary past, no old mention anywhere! Centered in Kumbakonam
for the last two centuries and it recently shifted to Kanchipuram,
so that folks, esp. Smartas, can have a quick visit from Madras.
Now, works on Kanchi math by Westerners give strength/legitimacy for
the Math's growth.

As far as Tamil works, Saiva Siddhantam and Sri Vaishnavism
are only ancient. May be, TattuvarAyar (17/18th century),
Pirabodha Candrodayam's translation (18th cent.), kaivalya
navaneetham are the only advaita works in Tamil compared
to several 100 times of Saiva Siddhanta and Sri Vaishnava
works.
