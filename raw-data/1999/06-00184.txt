Paola Tinti completed a D.Phil. on the contemporary Buddhist population in
Bangladesh last year at the Oriental Institute, Oxford. The title is
"Between Two Civilizations: History and Self-Representation of Bangladeshi
Buddhists", 1998. Paola argues that the community is now and has for many
years back been essentially a northwards extension of the Theravada
Buddhism of Southeast Asia (particularly Arakan, which played a major role
in the revival of Bengali Buddhism in the C19).

There is also a book in Swedish by E. Rosen-Hockersmith, Buddhismen i
Bangladesh. En studie av en minoritetsreligion. Religionshistorika
institutionen vid Uppsala universitet, Uppsala 1985.
