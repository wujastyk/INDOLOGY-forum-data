,please enlighten me. From literary Tamil more than 10,000 words can be 
cited. I have equal respect for Sanskrit also. If an ethnic group has evolved 
a sophisticated means of communication 
(language/letters/vocabulary/grammar/vast literature covering a wide spectrum 
)quite independent of another equally Elitist language over the same period 
of time?the former ethnic group should have the backing of a culture as old 
as that of the latter language?s cultural milieu. It should be agreed that 
both are independent cultural groups-developed a lot of commonalties-over a 
period of time due to Historical compulsions. Unity in Diversity.
