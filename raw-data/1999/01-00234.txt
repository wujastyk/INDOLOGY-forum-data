This doesn't sound like a "flight from
the North to the South" -- which is what
the original question asked about -- does it?

Since you apparently have access to the
above text, could you please post the poem?
Then we can judge better.

As I mentioned before, there isn't a
"traditional belief" among Tamilians
that they migrated from the north.

While, on the contrary, by the 3rd
or 4th grade, every Tamil kid has
heard of the legend of ancient Tamil
"sangams" and of "Southern Madurai"
which was swallowed up by the sea.

[Incidentally, according to legend,
Dwaraka was also swallowed up by the
sea.  And "Madurai" sounds like the
Tamil equivalent of "Mathura", which
is also associated with Krishna.
Hmmm... interesting...]

Of course, according to legend,
the sage Agastya is himself
supposed to have come from the
north (and never gone back).

Regards,


Raja.
