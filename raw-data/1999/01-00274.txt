This is all too vague.  Get back to us
when you can be more specific.  You and
I are engineers, we should know how to
be specific.

This is all bogus stuff.  Nobody is
holding down Tamil.  A language that
needs "protection" and "acceptance"
is a dying language.

A valuable step might be to convince
people in Tamil Nadu to speak/read more
Tamil and less English.  However,
this is very difficult (impossible)
to achieve.  It requires (horrors!)
actually writing cool stuff in Tamil.

It's easier to blame Hindi, North Indians,
central government, Sanskrit, Aryans,
the caste system, etc.  It won't help
in strengthening Tamil, but let's face it!
It feels good to be paranoid.

Regards,


Raja.
