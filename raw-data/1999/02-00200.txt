Reply:
Abhidheya (also called viZaya), when mentioned along with sambandha and
prayojana, means subject/topic of a systematic work; and the three,
sometimes with the fourth one, the adhikarin, are together called
'anubandha-s' (qualifiers), and are considered to be binding on the author
of a work to be announced at the outset. I am not aware of any authentic
Vedanta work taking the word in question to mean sAdhana.
It is obvious that the concept of anubandha came into vogue to answer the
primary queries of an intelligent reader in behalf of a work: (1) for whom
is it intended; (2) what is its subject; (3) what is its
justification/inter-relation as a subject/topic; (4) what profit would a
reader derive from it. I have discussed these conventional anubandhas and
their traditional explanations in my article, 'A Rational Approach to
Vedanta', published in ABORI, 1996.
