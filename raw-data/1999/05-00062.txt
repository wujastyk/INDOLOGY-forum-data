Following is the portions from Raghuvamsam. Translations by
Dr. R. Steiner, Univ. of Marburg, is well appreciated.

Kalidasa is talking of Uraga as the capital of Pandyas.
The mention of Malaya (Potikai), Sandal trees, Pearls from
Tamraparni, Pandyas, etc., shows this. This Uraga later becomes
HAlAsya.

Raghuva.m"sa 4.44-50 (literal translation)

4.44. Then he [sc. Raghu], [who] had not to wish for victory
[i.e. to whome victory came unsought], went upon the slope of
the sea-shore, [which] has been encircled by fruit-bearing
betelnut-trees (puuga), to the direction [which] is inhabited by
Agastya.

4.45. He [sc. Raghu] seemed to make the Kaaverii suspicious to
the husband of the rivers [sc. the ocean] because of the
enjoyment of [his] army [being] fragrant with the rut-fluid of the
elephants.

4.46. The army of him [who] was desirous of victory [and who]
had accomplished a journey, occupied the Malaya mountain?s
low land [where] pigeons were terrified in the Marica (v.l.:
Mariica, Maariica; black pepper) [forests].

4.47. The dust of the fruits of the cardamom plants (elaa)
[which] were pulverized by the horses, flew up [and] clung to
the temples of the elephants in rut [which had] a similar smell.

4.48. The neck-chain of the elephants fixed on the scars of the
sandal [trees caused by] the serpent?s coiling round, did not slip
down, although [the elephants] tore off the girths.

4.49. The heat [or: the splendour] even of the sun grows dim in
the region of the south (dak.si.na); in that very [region] the
Paa.n.dyas were not able to resist the heat [or: splendour;
courage] of Raghu.

4.50. They [sc. the Paa.n.dyas] threw themselves down to him
[and] gave him the best pearls (muktaa) of the great ocean
[which] comes together with the Taamrapar.nii, accumulated as
if it were their own glory.

Raghuva.m"sa 6.59-62 (literal translation)

6.59. Then the (female) door-keeper came to the godlike leader
of the city (pura) called Uraga (v.l.: Uruga) (uraga = "serpent;
naaga") [and] spoke to the princess of the Bhojas [who] has
been previously instructed with [the words]: "O [you who has]
eyes like a Cakora [bird], look at here!"

6.60. "This Paa.n.dya [king], on [whose] shoulders is placed a
necklace hanging down [from it and] the redness of [whose]
body has been prepared by sandal, appears like the king of the
mountains [whose] peaks are reddened by the morning sunshine
[and who] has been furnished with water falls flowing out.

6.61. Agastya, the subduer of the great mountain Vindhya, [by
whom] the king of the rivers [sc. the ocean] was completely
drunk up and emitted, became by affection a Sausnaatika [i.e.
someone who asks another whether an ablution has been
auspicious or successfully performed] for him [sc. the
Paa.n.dya] [whose] body was wet with the bathing [at the end]
of the horse sacrifice (a"svamedha).

6.62. In former times the proud ruler of La"nkaa, fearing the
destruction of Janasthaana, formed an alliance with him [sc. the
Paa.n.dya] [who] had obtained a missile from Hara [which] was
difficult to be obtained (or: hard to be overcome), [and then] set
out for the victory over the world of Indra."

Roland Steiner
