"...
Though statues of Lord Buddha have been found in Kuzhumani,
Pettaivaithalai, Thathayankaranpettai, Vellanur, Ariyalur, Veppur and
Jayamkondam in Tiruchi region, this is the first inscription that has
been found relating to Buddhism in the region.
.....
The inscriptions which runs on all the four sides of the pillar, is in
Tamil, and it was indeed unique that the sacred symbols relating to
Buddhism are round on all the four sides of the rectangular pillar. At
the bottom portion of the pillar are seen two `poornakumbhams' with
decorated lamps on either side. ...
