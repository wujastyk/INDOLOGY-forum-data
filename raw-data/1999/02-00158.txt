yes: it will make literacy easier to achieve, and there are some people
who don't want that. the sangh parivar has already said that nobel
laureate amartya sen's proposal to boost literacy in india as a way to
combat poverty is part of a christian conspiracy to convert the whole
country to christianity and destroy hinduism... the old conversion bogey
again. there are of course some vested interests in keeping people
illiterate and underdeveloped, and the hindutva right is where they
unite.
