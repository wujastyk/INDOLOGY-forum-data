Open letter,
I am a graduate student of Indology in Canada and want information regarding
institutes at both Hyderbad and Mysore, i.e., addresses and names of
institutions, for the purposes of researching Sanskrit source materials
(puranas, agamas, etc.).  I understand there are excellent libraries at both
cities but am without the information needed to apply to the given
institutions.  Any help in this direction or other relevant information
would be most appreciated.
Regards,
Benjy Fleming
