4. IF the xanthodermia is unsustainable much of the Aryan invasion as pushing out
the darker people/ later lower caste people collapses.

5. Parallels with Europeans reducing the american indian territory to reservation and
and forests again cannot sustain scrutiny. The gap between the polymachic
technology (capacity to use various kinds of war weapons ) of the Europeans and the
American Indians was immense. The same did not obtain between the invader and the
invaded ever in history.

6. Extending the logic given above about white versus dark, the same would apply to
other aspects of physical appearance and racial distinctness.

7. The soft AIT seems more logical and as increasing evidence tends to show it may be
just a migrationary influx and no invasion. It is at this point that the hard taskof
discovering what the migrants could have brought with them and what they adopted.

8. Regarding IE racial influx theory into Indian subcontinent, it is important to keep
in mind that a similar overthrow of the matrilinear societies of Greek and Asia Minor by
the patriarchal Indo-Europeans/Aryans was postulated. If the period for Northern Aryan
invaders into northern Greece (Thessaly) has been fixed around 2500 BCE and the
formation of Mycenean (middle Helladic culture) in 2000 BCE, then the invasion of
Harappa cannot be earlier than that. Hence it is not always the Indian evidence that
determines the date of AIT but the Greek history as well.
