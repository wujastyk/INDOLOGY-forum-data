Centre for the Development of Advanced Computing, located in Pune, India.
They produce (among other things) high-quality Indian-language software
(especially word-processors). Have a look at
    http://www.cdac.org.in/html/gist/gistinfo.htm.
For some reason the list of Word Processing/Publishing Products given
there doesn't contain anything about their current product, iLeap; for
this, go to http://www.cdac.org.in/html/gist/ileap1.htm.

The CDAC software treats Assamese completely separately from Bengali, so
presumably the anser here is "yes".
