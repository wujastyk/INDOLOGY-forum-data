Re: Mr Ulrich T Kragh's comments --

As I had hoped my subject heading would have indicated, my query relates to
the schools of Tibetan Buddhist Tenets (Vaibashika, Sautrantika, etc.), not
the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism (Nyingma-pa, etc.).

Thank you for noting the potential ambiguity regarding the four seals,
which I had hoped to avoid by listing the first. For the record, I am
interested in the non-tantric four seals.

Cheers,

Pamela
