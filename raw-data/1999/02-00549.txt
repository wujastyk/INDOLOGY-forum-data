Since you agreed in the last paragraph of this very message about the role
of inertia, how do you expect clicking on url will help. There have been so
many attempts made to have a unform system in the past that I doubt that
any new  system will be more accepted.  There are at least 5 Hindi
newspapers on the net and all of them use a different font. If you can
persuade them to print their papers in your Romanized font then I will
believe that your url has any future.

On this very list, I have seem different "academics" of your type use z,s, c
for the same devnagri character. You cannot blame computer professional
for all the ills.
