Yes, there is a long tradition by Saivaites, Vaishnavaites,
Jains, Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians to claim
Valluvar as their own.

   Helaachaarya seems to a vEL; kuNDakuNDa also is
a vEL/vELir. Agastya, the kalasha/kuNDa muni, is
said to have led the vELir of the Krishna clan to the South.
So says a sangam text (puRam).
