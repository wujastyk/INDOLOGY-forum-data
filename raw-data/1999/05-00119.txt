As a testimony to prof. Kuiper's detailed interest
into Tamil, see also:

International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, 1974,
Vol.III, No.1, pp.135-153
"The Genesis of a Linguistic Area", F.B.J. Kuiper
(this is a reprint of the text of the Collitz lecture delivered
at the summer meeting of the LSA, Ann Arbor, july 30,1965)

I will simply quote an excerpt from note 41 (p.147)

"[...] My sincere thanks are due to Dr. Kamil Zvelebil,
 who kindly checked the majority of the passages
 in the _PuRanAn2URu_. He found that _en2a_ occurs
 in _PuRam_ at least 200 times as a simple marker
 of direct speech, [...]

Best wishes
