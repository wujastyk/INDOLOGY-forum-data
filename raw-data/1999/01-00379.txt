Dear Jean-Luc,

I believe humble pleas and references to the netiquette are generally
in vain, although they might provide a shortterm relief.

In my (humble :-) opinion, the only solution is to moderate the list.
Those who are interested in good results of moderation can compare the
INDOLOGY to the LINGUIST (http://linguistlist.org/). Those who are
interested in quarrels and quibbles will definitely oppose any
moderation...

Best wishes,
--Paul.
