Subject: Word splitting & hyphenation conventions in roman              transliteration
Message-ID: <161227046103.23782.3168528591102265891.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Seeing the interesting topics covered under avagraha,
word splittings and hypenation conventions.

Can the incoming ISO standard of Roman script for Indic
tongues be applied in an all India scale?

Brushing aside ethnonationalistic passions,
are there any valid reasons to keep so many
Indian scripts?

The world is more a global village than ever and
the pace is accelerating.

All India Roman script will boost interstate and
international trade and communications.

Chris
