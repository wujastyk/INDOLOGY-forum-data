Depends on the context.

There is no shortage of great injustices everywhere and this list is no
place to discuss all of them.

In particular, at the present time there seem to be far more injustices
being perpetrated by the so-called dalits and women who have more than
lion's share in the power structure of India. The present President of
India is a dalit who cannot claim to be an outcome of any injustice
towards him and the worst misuse of power was undertaken by a woman PM.
It is the power that corrupts all. Today's victim can become a
perpetrator of injustice when the situations change.


Some people are just in the business of exploiting the poor and victims
to reap unfair advantages for themselves by claiming to be their
champions. These people are more despicable than those who victimize
them directly due to their own ignorance.
