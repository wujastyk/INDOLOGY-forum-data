I too thought it a good idea on first reading.  This is my first time to
post, and now I feel reluctant to post at all.  I would not want to
over-post and take the risk of being #1 on the list.

I am a moderator on another list.  There are actually 3 of us who moderate
the list.  This method works well and spreads the duties out.
