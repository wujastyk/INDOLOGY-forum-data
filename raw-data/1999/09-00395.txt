According to Artha/s-astra 3,7.31, the s-uta as Bard is different from the s-uta
being a person of mixed caste (k.satriya father and br-ahma.na mother).
Otherwise, among modern bardic castes, a tradition of pratiloma origin is still
alive.

Ludo Rocher in his book on the Pur-a.nas (1986, History of Indian Literature)
refers to some literature on the s-uta--issue (p.53ff).
