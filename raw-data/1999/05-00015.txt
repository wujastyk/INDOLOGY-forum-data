mainland). From that time on  there were certainly always Tamils living on
the island, although we have no idea as to their numbers. It is unclear
whether or not they occupied any particular areas. Later. Tamil mercenaries
also became common and important on the island. After the ninth century and
onwards,  South Indian kings were often successful in establishing
themselves in the north of the island; the numbers of Tamil speakers must
have increased considerably.

The natural assumption is that it is only at this time that Tamil speakers
became the majority in certain northern areas, but it is far from certain.

I am very sceptical as to the theory that 'Tamil religions' destroyed
Buddhist works. I suspect it is the Portuguese we should blame for that.
That, and the loss of patronage through the partial destruction of native
kingship in the south by Muslim invaders. Palmleaf manuscripts need
relativel;y frequent recopying.

Also, I suspect that much of the work of Tamil Buddhists was written in
Sanskrit, at least in later times. Theravaadin Sanskrit works were probably
produced more often in the Tamil country than in Ceylon. Some of this
survives, either directly or in renderings into Pali.
