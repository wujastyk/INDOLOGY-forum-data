Some lexemes relatable to Punjabi lohr.i_ (winter solstice) may be of
interest, denoting two semantic streams: stirring up mud (say, harvesting)and
movement (say, uttara_yan.am):


Pali: lol.i_, a_lol.i_ = that which is stirred up, mud, in cpd. si_ta_lol.i_
mud or loam from the furrow adhering to the plough (Vin. I, 206);
Sanskrit:lolati = to move; lot.anam = rolling, wallowing; ullola = violently
moving; Slavonic ljuljati = to rock; Kannad.a: lo_la = moving hither and
thither.
