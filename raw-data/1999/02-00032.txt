ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION IN SOUTH ASIAN LITERATURE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA
ACADEMIC YEAR 1999--2000

Applications are invited from people of all ranks, from advanced graduate
students to full professors, for a one-year position to teach South Asian
literature (in English, in translation, or both). Three courses are to be
taught on South Asian literature. One should be a broad, introductory
level course, and the other two should be seminars, each with a thematic
focus, aimed at advanced undergraduates. The successful candidate shall
also teach two courses in advanced Hindi or advanced Urdu. Those courses
are for students who have had at least two years of previous instruction
and are ready to focus on literature. (Note that at UVA a "course" is one
semester in length.) The Ph.D. is preferred, but a Ph.D. candidate who is
ABD would be considered. Salary will be commensurate with experience.
