Subject: Mount Potalaka in Malaya mountains
Message-ID: <161227046230.23782.1491770004783351471.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

   Found evidence that Mt. Potalaka is not in Sriparvata.
   Pl. see p. 193, M.-T. Mallmann, Avalokitezvara, 1967.

   In this well-known study, Madame Mallmann has published
   two, 12th century Pala sculptures of Avalokitezvara seated
   on a grotto on Mt. Potalaka. One sculpture is inscribed
   with "zrI potalake lokanAtha" and the other Pala sculpture
   has the inscription, "potalakaparvata lokezvara"
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Note that *Potalakaparvata Lokezvara*, NOT *zrIparvata
   Lokezvara*, is inscribed.

  Regards,
