I know an equivalent system for measuring lengths in the Tamil tradition,viz.,

8 aNu = 1 thErth thukaL
8 thErth thukaL = 1 panjizhai
8 panjizhai = 1 mayir
8 mayir = 1 nuNmaNal
8 nuNmaNal = 1 kaduku
8 kaduku = 1 nel
8 nel = 1 peruviral
12 peruviral = 1 chaN
2 chaN = 1 muzham
4 muzham = 1 kOl
200 kOl = 1 kUppIdu
4 kUppIdu = 1 kAtham

The meanings are:

aNu = atom, thErth thukaL = chariot dust, panjizhai = cotton filament, mayir = hair, nuNmaNal = fine sand, kaduku =
mustard seed, nel = paddy, peruviral = thumb (this is called 'angula' in sanskrit), chaN = extreme distance between the
thumb and the little finger, when an average person extends his fingers of a hand.(This is nearly around 8 inches in the
modern British System.) muzham = distance between the tip of the middle finger to the elbow point of an average
person, kOl = stick, kUppIdu = calling distance, kAtham = large distance unit.

Hope the above will be useful. (My transliteration may not be alright; but it serves the point. 'zha' is the special
stressed L in Tamil.)
