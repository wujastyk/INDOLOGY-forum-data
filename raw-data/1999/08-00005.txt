There was a very interesting program on TLC cable channel last week
about India and influence of Indian culture and architecture in Cambodia
(Angkor vat). The two segments are also available for purchase by TLC
(www.tlc.com).
I would like to discuss it with those of you who had a chance to view it
specially about the reasons given for the lack of interest of European
scholars and tourists in South Indian temple architecture which is even
old and grander than Taj Mahal.
