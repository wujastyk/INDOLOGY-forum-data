Dr. Paul Harrison of the University of Canterbury, gave a paper a few years
ago here in Canberra about the work on the manuscripts in Tabo. (I don't
think it was an Austro-Italian project by the way, maybe New
Zealand-Italian?).

I'm sure he has published accounts somewhere by now but do not have
references here. Maybe it would be best to contact him directly. I think he
may be in London about now (Numata Professorship?).
