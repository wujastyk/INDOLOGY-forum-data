>> >>I know there were two scenes

>yes, actually, the story --and each time sita's immolation-- is

>> >>        I did however,feel very impressed by the blending together

>yes, the filmmaker(s) took no pity on certain indian traditions, none
>whatever, including arranged marriage. the affair he was having and
>the kind of relationship they had made the whole thing that much uglier,
>and i don't think that was accidental.  mehta is heavily, *strongly*
>criticizing/critiquing indian culture with this film and much as i would

>> >>the part of the older couple there was the very complex situation of the

>> >>        I felt that there was almost too much symbolism once all of these

>i agree about the dense symbolism -- sometimes greater subtlety can be a
