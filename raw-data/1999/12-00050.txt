All have a doxographical approach, that is, they discuss the
different positions as outlined in the literature more than giving
further thoughts of their own on the issues.  Sinha in particular is
encyclopedic, particularly in discussing thinkers and systems outside
the usual 6 darsanas and the non-Kevaladvaita Vedanta.
