Brahmin Bashing seems to be a popular hobby these days, at least on the
forums on the Internet.

One only has to look around to see how untrue this statement is.

How untrue again! In fact Brahmins today face insurmountable hurdles to get
admission in professional colleges, jobs, promotions, etc. The caste based
reservation system that exists in India is a vote getting process that puts
the Brahmins and other forward classes at an unfair disadvantage and will
eventually be disadvantageous to the country as a whole.

I thought this list was about ancient India. Am I mistaken??
