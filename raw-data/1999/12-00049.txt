The magisterial David Pingree, in Jyotihsastra: astral and
mathematical literature, Wiesbaden: Otto Harrasowitz, 1981 (Hist. of
Ind. Lit., v. vi, fasc. 4), assigns him to "the early eleventh
century." The "epoch" (astronomical starting point) of his Rajamrganka
is 12 Feb. 1042, at which date he must have been on the throne and
presumably adult to be writing or commissioning technical works.
