Vedanta Book House,
Near Uma Talkies,
VI Main,
Chamarajpet
Bangalore 560 018
phone: 607590

proprietor: Gopal Babu.

I can recommend Gopal and his bookshop very highly.  He has sold me many
texts, has taken the initiative in finding rare editions which he thought
would interest me, and he has shipped large quantities of books for me
from India to England, and they all arrived very well packed and very
safely.

Best,
DW
