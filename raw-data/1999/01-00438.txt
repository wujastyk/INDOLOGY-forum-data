Dear list members,

I am looking for editions of GautamIya-tantra and/or Brihad-gautamiya-tantra. Does anybody know a library or publisher who has this book?

Does anyone know the dates these books were composed?

I am also looking for a scholar of the NimbArka-sampradAya who would be willing to correspond with me.

Thank you very much.

Jan Brzezinski
