Dear Richard,
                    This is Gabriel from The Sanskrit Web Site
(www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/3502/index.html). "aniketacArI" means
"one
who wanders about (cArI) houseless (aniketa)". In turn, "anupAdadhI" is
difficult to translate because I do not know the entire context. Maybe
it can
be translated as follows: "a woman who reflects (dhI) on each (anu)
verse or
line --as the fourth part of a regular stanza-- (pAda)". But I am not
completely sure if I do not know the context. Pali have many
Sanskrit-like
words. I have translated the words as if they were Sanskrit words. Next
time,
try to include the context surroundig the word to be translated.
Sorry about my English. Spanish is my native language.
Good luck!

Gabriel
