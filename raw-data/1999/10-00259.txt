I think your terminology is a bit garbled -- what you have written
means "the study/research on demons" -- the "oni" are horned
three-eyed malicious giant demons but not noted for their
ntelligence  -- they are similar to ogres in Western mythology but are
though to have been imported from China along with Buddhism although
they are not overtly Buddhist figures.

Best wishes,
