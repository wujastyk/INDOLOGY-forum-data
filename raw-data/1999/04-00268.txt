Subject: A text dealing with Ayurveda-PAncarAtra connection
In-Reply-To: <19990421213207.89239.qmail@hotmail.com>
Message-ID: <161227048336.23782.10063848917559341320.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

        In examining the broader context of the given  extract of my
"purANic saMhitA", I can say now that these physiological/embryological
conceptions are in fact exposed to the king Janaka by the sage Asita, whose
discourse concerns mainly the problematic of rebirth. Since other parts of
the text offers clear examples of PAncarAtra philosophy, my question should
have been: is there PAncarAtra texts dealing in some length with the
physiological/embryological mechanismes of rebirth?
Thank you for your help.
