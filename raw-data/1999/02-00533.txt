Dear Madhav Deshpande,
                                I am not a linguist but I am curious. In pranaSTa
"n" is flanked by two mUrdhanyAs. If it is the ease of pronunciation it
should become "N". Does this mean that ease is not always the criterion?
Is it a desire to break the monotony of three mUrdhnyAs in a row or is
there any meaning angle involved?

regards,

sarma.
