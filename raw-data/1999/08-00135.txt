Dear Indology members,

I came across one reference

Satya Prakash and Usha Jyotishmati (1979), "The Sulba Sutras:
Texts on Vedic Geometry."  Allahabad: Ratna Kumari Svadhyaya
Sansthana.

Does anyone know whether this is a work in English?  I was able
to figure out whether this was an edition of Sulbasutras or an
English work.  Your help would be appreciated.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
