This is excellent news.  At times I work with combinations of
Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan and Mongolian in the same text so I often
need to combine other romanized Asian languages with Sanskrit but
always have problems with customized fonts because of the characters
they overwrite.  In particular, I wonder whether a full set of tone
marks etc for Pinyin could be included/retained:

a/i/u/e/o + acute
a/i/u/e/o + grave
a/i/u/e/o + macron (part covered by Skt)
a/i/u/e/o + inverted circumflex (I don't know the correct term for
this)
u + umlaut + each of the above four.

Also it would be nice to have a lower-case Greek gamma included as it
is standard for academic use in Mongolian -- saves cutting and pasting
etc.

I realize that people like me are in a small minority but .....

Best wishes,
