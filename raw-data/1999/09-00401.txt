I do not have my reference books at hand at the moment. But
relying on my memory I can say that sUta is basically a mixed
caste, an issue of a BrAhmana mother and a kSatriya father, (see
ManusmRti for details), traditionally employed as a charioteer.
Being close to royal families for generations in this capacity, a
sUta was also in command of the history of the royal families
which qualified him as a bard. The first narrator/propagator of the
great epic MahAbhArata of VyAsa was a sUta. Sauti, his son,
carried on his profession when SUta was slain by BalarAma in a fit
of anger.
There may be more aspects to this issue for which I may advise
you to explore the monumental History of DharmazAstra by
Mm P. V. Kane published by the Bhandarkar Ori. Research Inst.,
Pune.
