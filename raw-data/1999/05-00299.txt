Our  Great  Teacher  Sri  RAghavendra  TIrtha  was  given  sannyAsa  at
the  NAyak  Court  in  Tanjore  by  his  predecessor  SudhIndra  TIrtha
somewhere  in  the  early  1620s.  He  ascended  to  the  pITha  of  the
PUrvAdi  MaTha  (later  renamed  the  "RAyara"  MaTha)  on  the  demise
of  SudhIndra  TIrtha  in  1623.  SudhIndra  TIrtha  was  the  immediate
successor  of  VijayIndra  TIrtha  (1514-1595).  The  brindAvana  of
SudhIndra  TIrtha  is  at  Anegondi  near  Hampi  on  the  banks  of
the  TungabhadrA  river.  In  those  days,  the  PUrvAdi  MaTha  was
based  at  KumbhakoNam.  After  RAghavendra  TIrtha's  time  it  came
to  be  based  in  MantrAlaya.
