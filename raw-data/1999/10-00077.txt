Dear Dr. Dominik WUJASTYK,

   We have the deepest sadness to announce you the demise of Doctor Hajime
NAKAMURA, president of the Institute of the Eastern Studies and professor
emeritus of the University of Tokyo.

   He has deceased of acute renal insufficiency in the morning of the 10th
of October 1999, at the age of eighty-six.  In Japan, we are deeply
saddened by the decease of the most eminent scholar who was at the same
time an inexhaustible source of encouragement for young scholars.

   The public funeral will be held on the 6th of November 1999 at the
Tsukiji-Honganji Temple (Tokyo).

With best regards,

                  Yours sincerely,

Sengaku MAYEDA,

Professor emeritus of the Universtiy of Tokyo,
Department of Indian Philosophy and Buddhist Studies,
Graduate School of Humanities and Sociology,
University of Tokyo,
Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113 Japan.

Hideaki NAKATANI,

Professor at the University of Kobegakuin.
