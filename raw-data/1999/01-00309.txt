The following references might be useful. (Of these, # 3 and # 4 are
not available to me right now.)

# 1) The valuable work *SAyaNa and MAdhava-VidyAraNya* by Munuganti
Kripacharyulu, Guntur 1980. Some 200 pages. The author*s PhD.
Available from the author: *6-6-35, Arundelpet, Guntur - 522 002
(A.P.)*.

# 2) *VedabhAshyabhUmikasaMgraha* (collection of SAyaNa*s
commentaries) ed. by Baladeva Upadhyaya. Kashi Sanskrit Series 102,
Varanasi, 2dn ed. 1985. With the editor*s introductions in hindi,
english and sanskrit.

# 3) An important article in *IA* 1916 by R. Nariasimchar.

# 4) I think that some references are given in Verpoorten*s *MimaMsa*
volume in *HIL*.

Yes.

Mainly introductory verses to the works, colophons to the works, and
inscriptions.

Kripacharyulu, pp. 178 - 179 and 182 - 183.

Upadhyaya, p. [49], cf. p. [47].

The question is somewhat unclear to me. Could you re-phrase it?

Questions # 4) and # 4) seem to presuppose that SAyaNa and MAdhava
held different views to begin with. This might be doubtful. Both are
likely to have been VedAntins, MImAMsakas and smArtas.
