Irene,

As a historian, I will agree that while the Brahmins have been the
ideologues of the social inequalities in our society, the other communities
have been the main perpetrators of crimes against the SC/ST and OBC's. Manu
himself was a Kshatriya. In modern India, the worst crimes against low caste
people are done by the OBC's (Yadavs, Kurmis), Harijans who have elevated
themselves and other Non Brahmin communities like the jats. And during the
traumatic Islamic and Portuguese (Roman Catholic) rule in India or parts of
India, it is the Brahmins who bore the brunt.

Having said all this, I want to emphasise that most so called 'Dalit
Movements' are nothing but a facade of rabid fanatical Islamic, Christian or
Marxist individuals. As an example, I reqest you to go the 'Links' section
of the website pointed out by Samar Abbas

http://dalitstan.org

You will see an over-abundance of Christian links. This proves that the
website is sponsored (if not set up) by Hindu hating Christians. And it is
not a mere coincidence that Samar Abbas is a MUSLIM. And a Jehadi Muslim.
Such fanatical people do not care if India splits into many chunks. As long
as they can win some of these chunks for Marx, Christ or Allah.

Now my own comments on your comments--

I do not think many rich Americans will allow others to use their bathrooms

True. But which society is free of prejudices? In Islamic societies,
inequality of human beings is ordained from Heaven.

I agree with everything else that was penned by you
