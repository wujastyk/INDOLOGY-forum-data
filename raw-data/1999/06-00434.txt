So that puts 4000 BCE (or 6000 years ago) as the upper limit
of the currently known linguistic knowledge base. Is there a
way to quantify the level of certainty (mentioned in the email
quoted as "some knowledge") of this knowledge base?

I have noticed an _apparent 6000 year bias_ in Indology,
Egyptology and in other areas as well, in dating monuments,
events, activities etc. Is the above mentioned upper limit
the reason?
