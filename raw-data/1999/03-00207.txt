case. From what I remember from my history books (not all of them written by 
Polish authors), the Nuremberg Laws depriving Jews of many civil rights and 
making them sub-human were promulgated at the 1935 Nazi Party Convention
and then systematically implemented not in Poland but in the German Third
Reich.

The meanings implied in the journalistic comparison of pre-War Poland with 
the Talibans' Afganistan offend me - as a person and as a Pole. While 
sharing the concern of all the signatories for the dramatic situation of 
women in Afgahanistan, I want to make it clear that I am not going to attach 
my signature to theirs under the petition. Not in its present form. Although 
I can only speak for myself, I believe I am not alone in the conviction that 
no one can effectively fight evil, if their good cause is propped up with 
creations of resentment and prejudice - whatever their reason for allowing
it. 

I would like to ask Ms.Ms. Josiane Olff-Nathan of the Groupe d'Etude et de 
Recherche sur la Science de l'Universite Louis Pasteur, Angela King, Special 
Advisor on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women, UN, and Mary 
Robinson, High Commissioner, UNHCHR, to forward this letter to the members 
of their networks. 

As the topic is really far from indological concerns, any comments the 
members of the Indology list would wish to make be kindly directed to my 
personal address.

With regards,
