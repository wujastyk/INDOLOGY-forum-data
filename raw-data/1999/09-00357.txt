Subject: last Mogul emperor as physician?
Message-ID: <161227052473.23782.15890508839636189619.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Library of Congress has recently acquired a small manuscript sheet
in Persian that seems upon first examination to be a medical
prescription written by Muhammad Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mogul
emperor.  Does anyone know whether Bahadur Shah was given to the study
of medicine in addition to his talents as a poet, or if he was in the
habit of doctoring his courtiers?

Thanks for any help.
