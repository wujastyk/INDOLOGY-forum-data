Hello!

We have started our new projects in the on-line journal KOLAM
(http://www.uni-kowln.de/phil-fak/indologie/kolam/frame.html)

One project is on Kuruntokai: analysis and translation of the poems
along with the commentary.

The other aims at setting up a website concerning U. Ve. Caminataiyar.

We would appreciate contributions, comments, etc. etc.

For the editors,
Ulrike Niklas
