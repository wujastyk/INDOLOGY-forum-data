Subject: Kumarila Bhatta's criticism of false etymologies
Message-ID: <161227045057.23782.15134098687833836781.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I remember reading in "A history of grammatical theories in Malayalam" by K.
N. Ezhuthachan that Kumarila Bhatta discusses false Sanskrit etymologies given
by others for clearly non-Sanskrit words. I think they might be from
Tantravarttika. Since I do not have access to that book, can somebody provide
the list of words he discusses? Any information about the date and place of
Kumarila Bhatta will also be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
