Hi all! I am new to this list, and only an amateur in Indology, so please
forgive my (maybe?) silly questions.

I' ve seen recently accounts about the dicovery of the old course of the
Saraswati river, and that it was indeed a mighty river, as presented in the
Rg-veda.
Also, many sites corresponding to the Mohenjodaro and Harappean cultures
were found, moving the center of this culture south-east. Is there any
recent datation of these sites, and also for the drying up of the Saraswati?
In advance thank you

Eric Robert
