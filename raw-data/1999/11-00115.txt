Dear list members:

A colleague has asked me to forward the following two questions.

1)What is the reference in the Buddhist canon to the story of the Buddha who
converts a cobra to ahimsa and then comes back later and finds the snake all
beaten and battered and tells him that he didn't tell him not to hiss.  Is
there a similar story in the Hindu literature?

2) What would be the most appropriate sanskrit word for "trust" or
"foundation" in the sense of a non-profit organization performing a service
for the public welfare?

Many thanks in advance,

Harry Spier
