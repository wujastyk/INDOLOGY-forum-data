If you are looking for Agamas in Mysore area there is a place called
Melkote about less than an hour by bus from Mysore. They have some Agama
manuscripts; there are some in the Tirupati Kendriya VidyapiTa in Tirupati,
and in Madras area which is not far from Tirupati you can check with Adyar
library who have published quite a few manuscripts related to Pancaratra
aagamas. In Hyderabad I don't have exact name of the place, but if you go
to the Philosophy department of the Osmania University, someone will direct
you to the sources. One caution, most South Indian manuscripts are either
in Telugu or Grantha Tamil script and not necessarily in Devanaagari
script.

Good luck,

Pratap
