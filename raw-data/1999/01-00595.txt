Teaching Buddhism: The State of the Art

A conference organized by the NUMATA
professorship of McGill University,
Montreal, Canada


The Faculty of Religious Studies of McGill University is soliciting
papers for a conference to be held October 8-9, 1999.

Buddhism has been routinely taught in North American colleges and
universities for several decades now. Sometimes it is taught in
religious studies, and sometimes in area studies (language and culture)
contexts.  The purpose of this conference is to assess the "state of the

discipline." Where has the study of Buddhism been, and where is it
going? What is the prognosis?

Possible themes that may be considered for the conference include:

 <BULLET> Classroom teaching and course design
 <BULLET> Use of texts in the original languages or in translation
 <BULLET> Course content
 <BULLET> Use of narrative
 <BULLET> Traditional and alternative teaching tools
  - Textbooks
  - Video and slide presentations
  - Multimedia
  - Field trips and participation in religious ceremonies
  - Meditative experience in the classroom

Please note that these are simply suggested themes and are NOT meant to
exclude other topics. If you have any questions regarding topics or
themes, please contact Dr. Richard Hayes (cxev at musica.mcgill.ca) or Dr.
Victor Hori (czvh at musica.mcgill.ca).

This conference is open to academics, young scholars and students
interested in discussing the future of the field, more precisely, the
kind of research that could be done, the kinds of courses that could be
taught.

Papers are limited to 20 minutes reading time (normally 8-10
double-spaced pages). Please submit a ONE-PAGE PROPOSAL and a BRIEF C.V.

by mail, Fax or E-Mail to:

Dr. Francis Brassard
