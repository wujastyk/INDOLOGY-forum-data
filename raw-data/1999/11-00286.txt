Hi,
There have been a lot of comments on "Babaji"
Mahanand Babaji, Mahavatar Babaji, Tatamabari Babaji Etc all supposed to be
referring to the same? Babaji of "Autobiography of a Yogi" fame.
I believe some thing to that extent was also indicated in the Himalayan
Masters and other works...almost to the point of saying that he originated
from Chidambaramin the South etc..... Can any one throw some light?
This will be very much appreciated.
