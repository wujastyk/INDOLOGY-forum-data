>From your first message it appeared that you DO draw a connection,
possibly a causal one, between (a) lack of computer programmers in the
People's Republic of China and (b) complications regarding the encoding
of the Chinese language, so that the latter would somehow be a reason
for the former. I would disagree on this point. But if you don't assume
such a connection, then that puts and end to this digression anyway.
