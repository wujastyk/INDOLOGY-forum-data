Hi

I'm trying to locate the source of a story recounted in Fox Strangways'
"Music of Hindostan". In this story the minstrel Sagga sets out on a ship
in search of Queen Sussondi. The sailors insist that he sing. At first he
refuses on the grounds that it would send the fishes wild with excitement.
They insist. When he sings, as he predicted, a sea-monster sinks the ship.

Any help would be appreciated

John Napier
