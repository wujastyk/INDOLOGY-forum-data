*Cf. the German word "Strauss", which has the same two meanings as
*(apparently) skt. kalApa: 1) bunch (of flowers), 2) fight, combat. The
*second meaning has evolved as a poetic metaphora, fighting men entangled in
*battle being compared with a bunch (of flowers, twigs etc.).

       The root of the word kalApa appears to be of Tamil/Dravidian
       origin : kala = mix, join. The semantic root senses match
       with German. Numerous tamil words can be related to kala.
