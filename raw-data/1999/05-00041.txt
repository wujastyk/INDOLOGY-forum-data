Hope the world does not have to go by the mirror images from India of
TV evangelists' version of biblical archaeology, linguistics,
history.

As I recall, Arvind Sharma usually uses Western style in analysis.
I remember the foreword in his book, Buddhism (I have to get it
from the basement) that he was intrigued by the idea of
deconstruction. This was explained to him on a flight from
Australia to Canada when he was offered a teaching job in N. America.
Then he learnt deconstruction more and wrote the book, Buddhism
an old 'deconstruction' method.

May be Arvind won't buy the opinions of Talageri, Rajaram, Frawley.
Has he written along with them??

Yours,
V. Iyer
