astronomically, perhaps, but what about its form?
The same fallacy as in the Satapatha argument about the Krttikas.

Who has seen a Vedic text composed in Slokas, looking like Manu,
Mahabharata, or the middle level Katha Upanisad? If soemone canshow me a
PRE-iron age sloka   treatise, I am ready to believe that the Vedanga
Jyotisa is from 1300 BC., andnot just its astronomy....

See same argument in: Astronomy (Agarwal).

Such mono-lateral argumentation as used  BY KAK, SASTRY, ELST
argumentation leads nowhere.
If you see that  modern/recent birds have the structure  of dinosaurs that
does not make them
much of pre-jurassic creatures... They are recasts in a more modern form
just as the  Jyotisa ...

Nope, just the unilateral argument...
