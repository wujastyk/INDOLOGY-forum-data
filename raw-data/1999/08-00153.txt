Dear Mr. Iyer:

Details on the Chowdhury book:

       Caudhuri, Paramesa:
       Indian origin of the Chinese nation : a challenging,
         unconventional theory of the origin of the Chinese ....
        Calcutta : Dasgupta & Co., 1990

  I have not read the book, so cannot say any more. I saw the book in the
Anthropology stacks. Hint: Anthropolgy of Scholarly Ideas ?

Good luck.
