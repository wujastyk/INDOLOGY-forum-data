I am increasingly unhappy about the subscribers coming to INDOLOGY via the
Hotmail service.  A disproportionate number of our problems with fake
identities, over-zealous posting, and so forth, seem to end up being
caused by Hotmail subscribers.

Obviously I don't wish to vilify individual Hotmail users: for some people
it is a valuable and perhaps essential service.  I really don't know what
action to take about this, if any.

Perhaps the best I can do at present is to ask Hotmail (and Yahoo) users
to give serious consideration to switching to a service provider whose
clients are not quite so anonymous.  Ideally, members' identities should
be queryable using the "finger" command, although I know that this is not
always possible, even in major universities.  If you must use Hotmail, and
Hotmail-alikes, please give your name and postal address in the footer of
your email at least once a month.

This posting is just to register an area of concern.
