Dear Mr. N. Chandran et al:

Here is all the information I could gather on Sundara Pandya. If you wish, I
can send it to you as a formatted file. References are at the end.
______________

Acharya Sundarapandya

His Life and Age:
Nothing positive is known about Sundara Pandya except that he was a
predecessor of Bhatta Kumarila. Kuppusvami has attempted to equate Sundara
Pandya with a king of the Pandya dynasty but the reasons adduced by him are
not very convincing (Ref. 94). Pandey states that Sundara Pandya was
anterior to Bhartrmitra but gives no reason for the same (Ref. 93). In
Sabara Bhasya, we find numerous metrical quotations (ref. 92) and it is not
clear where they are cited from. Some of them are stated to be from the
Vrttikaragrantha of Bhagavan Upavarsa. Are the rest from the pen of
Sundarapandya?
An inscription dated 750 C.E. names one Sundarapandya as a scholar
proficient in all Sastras and a remote ancestor of  the Pandyan King
Arikesarin (Ref. 114, pg. xiv). In fact, Sundarapandya might have been
anterior to Arikesarin by several centuries (Ref. 115)
