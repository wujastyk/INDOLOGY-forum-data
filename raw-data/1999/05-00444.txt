<<<I am informed according to tradition, Lord Parshuram (who destroyed
all the Kshatriyas on the earth) reclaimed the land called Kerala
nowadays by throwing his bow into the sea (the state of Kerala indeed
looks like an unstretched bow) and then settled the 64 (I am not sure
of the number) Brahmin families therein. >>>

  Didn't Parashurama have the axe, 'parashu' rather than the
bow of Ramayana's Ram?
