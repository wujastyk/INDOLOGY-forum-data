I guess all Prof. N. Ganesan is asking is for an inexpensive
edition of A. Parpola, Deciphering the Indus script, 1994.

It does not matter if it is from Princeton or Harvard or
UC, Berkeley or Columbia or SUNY or Oxford or Cambridge.

One of these people or an Indian publisher can contact him.
I think his e-mail is asko.parpola at helsinki.fi

If an Indian publisher does printing, he will make lots of
money. People tired of Frawley & co., will buy this book.
For sure, I will order 50 copies.
