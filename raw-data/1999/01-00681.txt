I got the following from A.K. Ramanujan's
"Poems of Love and War from the Eight Anthologies
and the Ten Long Poems of Classical Tamil"
Columbia University Press

Appendix: Plant Names page 317:

English: cadamba oak
Tamil  : katampu
Latin  : Anthocephahlus Cadamba

Note that the regular English name and the Latin or botanical
names both use the original Tamil name for the tree!
