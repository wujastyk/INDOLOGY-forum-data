  I think we can use a mixture of a) Harvard-Kyoto scheme for
  Sanskrit  and b) IITS, U. Cologne, Germany
  scheme for Tamil together in Maniprvala works.

  Probably Sanskrit words can be written with a marker -
  a) within single or double quotes or c) with (Skt.) in
  front or back of Sanskrit words in manipravala prose
  or c) another easy way ...

  The readership of manipravala works is rather small.

  Best regards,
