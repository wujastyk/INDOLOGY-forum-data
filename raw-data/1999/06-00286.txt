Dear Birgit,

I have paged this and if it shows up will photocopy and send to you.
If it isn't on the shelf I will notify the list in case others can
find it.

<<Now, here is my next question. Unfortunately, the volume in
question
appears to be unavailable at Austrian university libraries. So I am
looking for someone who has it at hand and would be willing to mail
me a
copy of said article (details given below) ... in which case, please
contact me via private e-mail ...
