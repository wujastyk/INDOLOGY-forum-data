Yes, Hastamalaka has always been associated with the village of Srivali or
Sribali or Shivalli, in the Sankaravijaya texts. The typical story is that
Sankara was travelling from Mookambika to Gokarna and passed through this
village, where Hastamalaka became his disciple. The story of Hastamalaka
installing Krishna in Udipi is also known to one Sankaravijaya text, but the
story has come down in a highly garbled form, perhaps because of the
confusion caused by some families converting to Madhva's school and others
remaining aligned with Sankaran Advaita. I've discussed this briefly in the
paper I referred to in my earlier mail.
