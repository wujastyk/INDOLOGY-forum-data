The Bhagavata Purana is certainly one of the important sources. The statue
(kastha) meditation is frequently described there. The loci classici are:
I,6,17-26; II,1,16-39;  II,2,8...81; III,28,1-38; IV,8,42-78; XI, 14,
31-46. My little book in French "La m?ditation dans le Bhagavata Purana"
(Paris, Dervy Livres, 1978) may be useful. I have brought together in it
the various textes from the Bh. P. Greetings. A. Nayak
