This is of course rather interesting. I guess further
investigation may be required.

As you might be aware, Sri MaNavALa mAmunikaL's
father's village is tirukkurukUr i.e., the modern
ALvAr tirunagari while Sikkil kiDAram is his mother's
village. Now I can not recall where I read that the
latter village is just a few miles away from the
former one. It might be a good idea to check YatIndira
pravaNar pirabAvam. Unfortunately I don't have access
to it now, none of the libraries hereabouts seem to
have it.

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
