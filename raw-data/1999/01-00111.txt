To complete one long essay, I am urgently in need of knowing
the contents
of the following article:

Bandyopadhyay, Pratap. 1981. 'Sanskrit indeclinables (upasargas
and
nipatas) and their meaning."  _Suniti Kumar Chatteji Commemmoration
Volume_
[please note that this is different from _Suniti Kumar Chatterjee
Jubilee
Volume_], pp. 45-74. Burdwan: University of Burdwan.

After trying at several libraries, I have not been able to put
my hands on
a copy of the SKCCV.  I would be grateful if those who have access
to the
volume/article contact me at <aklujkar at unixg.ubc.ca> or <fo8z003 at public.uni-hamburg.de>.
Thanks. -- ashok aklujkar
