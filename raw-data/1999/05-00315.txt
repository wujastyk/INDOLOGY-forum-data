Tamil grammar from TolkAppiyam(3rd century BC?) only
has "ka" in the series of "ka, kha, ga, gha".
(This is not to say that Tamil lacks "ga" sound.)

All Indian writing, including Tamil, letters developed out
of Asokan Brahmi. Because Tamil does not have separate
letters for the aspirated or voiced sounds, Pallava grantha
script was developed during the Pallavan era. The primary
purpose was to write Sanskrit material. Even today,
Tamil brahmin priestly books are in the grantha script.
By the time Kannada and Telugu grammars were written,
the alphabetical list was the same as that of Sanskrit.
Hence the Pallava grantha was applied to write Kannada
and Telugu. Since Southeast coast had marine contacts
all over South East Asia, the same Pallava grantha
came to be used there too.
