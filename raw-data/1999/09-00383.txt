        The  paper investigates the various layers of South Asian languages
that have been superimposed upon each other during the past few millennia.
As will be seen, the usual "Aryan"-Dravidian divide is much too simple a
concept to fit reality.
        Just as today, prehistoric South Asia was home to a number of
language families, only some of which have survived as today's families,
i.e. Indo-European (Sanskrit, Hindi etc.), Dravidian (Tamil, etc.), Munda
(Santali, Mundari etc.), Tibeto-Burmese (Newari, Naga, Manipuri, etc.); in
addition there are the remnant, isolated languages such as Burushaski in N.
Pakistan, Kusunda in Central Nepal, Nahali in Central India, Vedda in Sri
Lanka, and Andamanese. Further, it will become obvious that today's
languages, for example Hindi, contain ancient layers that go back beyond
all Aryan, Munda or Dravidian and that are close to the language of the
first immigrating groups of Homo Sapiens sapiens, that entered South Asia
from Africa, via Western Asia, some 30,000 years ago.
        Providing this kind of impartial historical relief to the ongoing
discussion hopefully will steer it into calmer waters.
