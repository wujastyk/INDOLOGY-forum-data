Subject: Reference check on line of Bhagavad Gita.  Variation or errata
Message-ID: <161227046396.23782.16444026537852311880.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The sanskrit text of the Bhagavad Gita reproduced by J.A.B. Van Buitenen
in  "The Bhagavadgita in the Mahabharata" is reportedly taken from  S.K.
Belvalkar ed., bhiSmaparvan (1) (fascicule 15) (Poona:Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute, 1947) pp. 74-203.

In Van Buitenen's book the last line of verse 28 is (I'm transliterating
in HK convention):

dRSTvemAn svajanAn kRSNa yuyutsUn samavasthitAn ||

In all the other sources I've checked: Radhakrishnan, Winthrop Sargeant,
Swami Tapasyananda, Divine Life Society, Gita Press, Warrier, Dr.
Shakuntala Rao Sastri, they all have:

dRSTvemaM svajanaM kRSNa yuyutsuM samupasthitam ||

Does anyone know if the line in Van Buitenen's book is an accurate
rendition of the BORI critical edition? Is this a genuine variation or
errata?

Many thanks


Harry Spier
