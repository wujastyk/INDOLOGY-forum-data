Subject: Good book on Tantra and BhArtrhari
Message-ID: <161227053752.23782.4012136439381352823.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I would like some suggestions on a good book dealing with Tantra - ideally
should deal with both Bauddha and Hindu tantra - a book which gives a solid
exposition of both the fundemantal as well as the advanced aspects of the
system.

Also suggestions of good books dealing with BhArtrhari's SphotavAda.

I've seen one book by Natalia Isvaseya, where she seems to be trying to
relate BhArtrhari to GaudapAda. Any comments on the quality of this work?
