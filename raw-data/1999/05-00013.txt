    N.S.Rajaram's review of Indus Age: The Writing System by Gregory
Possehl's book by Dr Rajaram (made available to this list by Vishal Agarwal)
calls for "a new school of thought" in the field of Indology. This appeal
reminds me of the suggestion formally made by Arvind Sharma of McGill
University, Montreal at the conference on Dharma and History held in Shimla
in July 1997 that western scholarship on Indology be known as "Gentoo
Studies" in order to distinguish it from contributions made by Indians
themselves using Indic paradigms of knowledge and scholarship.
