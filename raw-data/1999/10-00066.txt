Subject: Buddhism - conceptual doubts
Message-ID: <161227052782.23782.7242756483994054327.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is a very illuminating book on this subject below by J.F.
Streng,"Emptiness- A Study in Religious Meaning".

One way to interpret Nagarjuna is to turn the mind, not to an ontological
reality, but, to an attitude of the mind. With such a perspective one could
say that he denies every notion of an absolute reality/ontology as a means
to enlightenment. The concepts nirvana and samsara are alike in that they
are mere concepts. They can be used, or utilized,in the teaching of
buddhist disciples within the context of conventional truth but fall short
in the context of ultimate truth which is not reached or attained by way of
thinking but through the act of meditation -purifying ones mind. One could
say that the world/reality remains the same but the mind apprehending the
reality is utterly changed. In this sense the ultimate truth/nirvana is not
a truth of something but rather a way of behaving in relation to the world,
an attitude.

There is of course a limit to language, it is fornulated within "the world"
and cannot but guide the mind towards enlightenment. This might be the
reason of "the silence". Furthermore I think Nagarjuna saw a need of
reinforcing the old teaching in a new way because he apprehended many of
the buddhists schools active at that time as straying to far away from the
right path, saying too much about things about which one cannot say much.

It is not an easy subject this and I fear that the above is more confusing
than clarifying. So here are some more books (and an article):

Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, "Abhidharma Buddhism", Eds. Potter,
Buswell, Jaini and Reat.(1996)

Sprung, M. "Lucid Eposition of the Middle Way -The essential Chapters from
the Prasannapada of Candrakirti"(1979)

Huntington, C. W. "The System of the Two Truths in the Prasannapada and the
Madhyamakavatara: A Study in Madhyamikan Soteriology" in Journal of Indian
Philosophy, 11(1983)pp.77-106.

with kind regards Anna-Pya Sjodin.
