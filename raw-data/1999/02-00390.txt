That is what I meant. All the other MahAyAna scriptures I have
seen have somewhat uniform endings. These two are basically not
ending (Ma~Nju/SrImUlakalpa and La.NkAvatAra). The word "yathA
labdhaM" fits for them (as you suggest) but it is strange that the
scribe did not add the standard ending as most scribes probably
will ( I have not seen yathA labdhaM in any other MahAyAna
sUtra).  It is another case with GaNdavyUha which is ending in
ussual way and is also complete and systematic as whole.
La.NkAvatAra is basically compilation of fragments. Can someone
give some comments or referece on Ma~Nju/SrImUlakalpa - its
structure, content and textual history?
