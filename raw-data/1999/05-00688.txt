The scope of INDOLOGY

I started the INDOLOGY discussion list in 1990 as a forum for Sanskritists,
MIA and NIA language specialists, Dravidologists, historians, and others
interested in any aspect of Indological studies. That includes other
languages, of course, and anything related. It's not restricted, except
that I feel that discussions about contemporary politics and social issues
are better carried out in Usenet groups like soc.culture.india and similar
forums.

As a rough guide to subject content, if you enjoy receiving journals like
the JAOS, JRAS, BSOAS, IIJ, etc., then INDOLOGY is for you! If you don't
recognize these acronyms, think twice before joining. The forum is
targetted at professional participants in Indological studies, and is not
primarily a forum for discussions with undergraduates or scholars from
other fields who have an amateur interest in Indian history and culture.
For example, if you do not recognise any of the above acronyms, or never
read any of these journals, or if you never attend academic conferences in
some aspect of INDOLOGY, then perhaps another forum would be more
appropriate for you, since you will not be on the same wavelength as the
other members. Of course non-professionals are welcome to join the list if
they wish, but elementary questions and discussions about Indian history
and culture should be addressed elsewhere. The discourse in INDOLOGY
assumes a familiarity with the specialist literature of the subjects
discussed.
