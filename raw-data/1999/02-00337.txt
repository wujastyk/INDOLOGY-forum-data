>?From that article: the expression san-la tao-ch'ang or
ssu-la ming-shan mentioning Mt. Wu-tai, Mt. Omei,
Mt. Pu-to and Mt. Chiu-hua together are quite late. (after 1300 AD,
these expressions come into use.)

p. 191
"The emergence of P'u-t'o as a national and international
pilgrimage center for the worship of Kuan-yin was a late and
slow one, beginning in the tenth century, picking up momentum
in the sixteenth, and reaching a peak only after the eighteenth.
By contrast, the other"famous mountains" particularly Wu-t'ai
and Omei were already well known during the T'ang (618-907), the
same time when the cult of Kuan-yin also became popular."

It appears many places were there for Kuan yin cult.
P'u-t'o as Chinese Mt. Potalaka is significant only from
and after 10th century AD.
