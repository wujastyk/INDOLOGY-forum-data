Certainly. According to K. C. Pandey, abhinavagupta quotes Pallava mahendra
varman's mattavilAsa prahasana. We have the presence of Tamil zaivites in
north India indicated by kAdambarI and harSacaritA. As I have shown earlier
Kalidasa must have interacted with a person from the Tamil country. I think
Rajatarangini also mentions the presence of a Tamil in the Kashmir king's
court. So, I do not know why there cannot be an influence from Tamilnadu to
Kashmir.

I think the import of the colophon of kuRiJcippATTU, a CT text, that it was
composed specifically to teach an Aryan (north Indian) king the principles of
Tamil (love poetry) has not been given due attention.
