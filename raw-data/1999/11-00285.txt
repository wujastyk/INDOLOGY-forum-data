Subject: Background of the Sikh name `Singh'?
Message-ID: <161227053831.23782.11662470134694164200.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The title "Singh" derived from Simham or Singam to mean Lion - -is used by
Non-Sikh Hindus also.- -Probably the word "Sikh" is derived from ' Sikh'sha=
education/ training----' Sikh'shak=Guru or Great Teacher---and '
Sikh'shith=disciple/student and probably the respectful relationship between
the Guru and the disciple and the "Upadesam"=training is inherently present
in all the 3 syllables.
