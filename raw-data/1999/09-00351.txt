aniketacAri

according to CPD this has the same meaning as 'aniketavaasi(n)' i.e.
'dwelling houseless'; it cites Pj II 573,26 and Nidd-a II 193,19.
They both explain it as equivalent to apalibodhacAri(n) and
nittaNhacAri(n). (Is that correctly transcribed in this system ?)

anupAdadhI

I do not have Rgs to hand and am not sure I can comment usefully on
that out of context - unless it is for anupAdat hi or for
anupAdaddhi. Anyway, presumably the negative prefix a(n) before some
form of upa+A+dA ? According to Edgerton this does occur before
finite verbs even in Sanskrit and it is, as he indicates, not very
unusual in Pali.
