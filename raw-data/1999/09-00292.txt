Well, the remark refers to scholarly interest in India.

Perhaps, the word 'interest' in the article should have been changed to
'funding'. I've been a graduate student in Linguistics in the US for the
past 8 years, and my impression is that there is more funding available for
studies on East Asia then on South Asia. I don't know what political and
economical forces are responsible for the available funding, but there seem
to be more professors who study the East Asian languages, and more grants
available for research in East Asia. But, this is only an impression --
perhaps its true only of my discipline, or perhaps its just not true at all!
