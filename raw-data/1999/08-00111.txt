Dear Indologists,

What is the earliest attested presence of Brahui as a spoken language in
Baluchistan? How does the status of Brahui as a 'Dravidian' language fit
into the theory that IVC was essentially Dravidian?

It is well known that in Pre-Islamic India, several Kannada dynasties
occuppied lands up North (Gujarat, Maharashtra. Kannada inscriptions are
even said to be found in Rajasthan). Is it possible that the Brahuis are in
fact descendents of the Kannada elite that followed these ruling dynasties
and then happened migrate to Baluchistan? Are there any Baluchi traditions
which hint at these migrations?
