There are hardly any cases of brahmins exploiting dalits in mordern India.
A large proportion of brahmins belong to an educated middle class and this
rather than exploitation is the prime reason for whatever benifits they
enjoy.

Brahmins did make life hard for the untouchables by making discriminatory
rules but by this they did not gain great benifits for themselves. Anyway
this is history and is definitely not a mordern phenomenon.

In bihar land owners have traditionally exploited the dalits and continue to
do so. One hears very few or almost no stories in the press where brahmins
as a group exploit other groups.

In mordern India dalits have had a late start as far as education is
concerned and also have traditionally been poor. Brahmins in comparision
have had a head start.
