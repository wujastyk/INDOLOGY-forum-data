Very well put. Not only do I agree 100%, but I admire and envy the
degree of maturity that Mr. Misra has exhibited in his post.

The anti-Indians (and there are some Indians amongst them) on this
list are puzzling to me. I fail to understand why they would devote so
much of their (and other peoples) time discussing, sermonizing and
handing out harangues on a system and a culture that they obviously
have such little respect for. 

You won't find me discussing/dissing American marriages, for
instance. :-)

conversion'. The insistence on 're-conversion' is also an expression of strong intolerance towards individual freedom. If any non-Hindu individual whose ancestors at some time were (or were not) some sort of Hindus wishes to join a Hindu religious communi


ty, then that decision should be left to that individual. But for any group to insist upon 're-conversion' of others seems to fly in the face of basic human rights.
