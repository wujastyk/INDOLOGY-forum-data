I have the sad duty to inform you about the passing away of my predecessor,
Daniel H.H. Ingalls. He died last Saturday, July 17, of heart failure, at
Bath County Community Hospital in Hot Springs, Virginia. He was  83. He is
buried at Warm Springs Cemetery in Warm Springs, Va.

He was born and grew up in New York. He attended Harvard University and
graduated with a B.A. in 1936. After receiving a master's degree he became
a "Junior Fellow," a generous appointment that allows young (pre-)PhDs to
work unencumbered for three years on topics of their choice.

However, his fellowship was cut short  by World War II. Ingalls served as
an officer  in South Asia in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the
forerunner of the CIA, and with the Pentagon.

After the war he returned to Harvard, where he became Wales Professor of
Sanskrit in 1951. He retired in 1983 after some 35 years of teaching at
Harvard. During this time he was chairman of the Department of Sanskrit and
Indian Studies and served on many other committees.

Next to his colleague and fellow OSS officer, Norman W. Brown at
Philadelphia, he probably taught the largest number of  Sanskritists in
this country (cf. J.W. de Jong in Indo-Iranian Journal, c. 1985).

After his retirement, he moved back to Hot Springs, Virginia, where his
family owned "The Homestead Hotel". This resort, which served as internment
location for Japanese diplomats after the outbreak of the war with Japan,
had been bought a hundred years ago by Ingalls' grandfather, the president
of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad. Ingalls also was president and chairman
of the board of Virginia Hot Springs Inc., and of several other local
companies.

Ingalls is well known for his early work on Navyanyaya, his translation of
Vidyakara's collection of verses, and his more recent translation of the
Dhvanyaloka, all published in the Harvard Oriental Series, which he edited
from 1951-83 (see: www.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/hos.html.)
