This quotation follows many, many sections in which Shamkara DOES take on
the Realists, the Idealists, and the Voidists one by one, and in detail
(except for Voidism, to which he gives unduly short shrift).  And he DOES
say "the Buddha" here.  Shouldn't we take the text for what it says?

Here the reference seems to be to sarvAsthivAdins (vaibhASikAs),
vijnAnavAdins and zUnyavAdins. This is hardly an attack
by Sankara on Buddha as a person but an attack on the later
schools of Buddhism. Insteaad of refuting them individually
Sankara takes the easy way out. He heckles them for their lack
of unanimity about what is the teaching of Buddha.

sarma.
