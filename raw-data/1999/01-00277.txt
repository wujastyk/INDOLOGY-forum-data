  Hi Raja,

  Greetings.

  When I was at Inst. of Asian studies on a visit, people told
me this that Persian, Arabic are classified as classical
languages, but not Tamil.

I have to check where in one of the Central govt.
documents. This is shown to UN etc., to get funds.

I have a draft copy submitted to Cental Govt. to
classify Tamil on par with Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit.

That way, funds for research into Tamil and other
Dravidian languages would be a natural byproduct.

Hope Tamil is accepted, given protection, fostered
with funds for its growth in India.

More later,
N. Ganesan
