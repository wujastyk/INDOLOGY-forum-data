No, there are 52 letters in the
rOman AElfabet.  Do you see any
fisikal similarity between, say,
"G" and "g"?

Another point: wen thuh rOman

Gud nyUs:  printing technology for
Indian scripts already exists.
People in India aren't illiterate
because of inability to print books
in Indian script.  So this is not
an issue.

This would be equally true if
Indian languages standardized
on any other common script.  It
is not a singular advantage of
the rOman skript alone.

It certainly sounded like it.
Glad we now agree that it isn't.
