In other words you want to have the final say in the matter just because
you live in Europe but would not let any one else express his/views with
the other members. You have right to have opinions about matters about
India but an Indian does not have a right to express his opinions about
matters European.

What makes you think that any one is interested in discussing this
matter with you privately and what purpose would that serve?


Have a peaceful and joyous day.
