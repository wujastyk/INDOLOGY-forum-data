Certainly, all schools influenced each other. My point was that the
Westerners would have seen more advaitins among scholars, and that too
spread out all over India. Surely, that would have played at least
some role in the British paying more attention to the advaita school?
Hacker's pioneering studies of advaita were not based on political
considerations. He made it quite clear that he wanted to study the
system in order to more efficiently proselytise Indians, or "dialog"
as he calls it. Obviously, it would make more sense to study the
system of the person who found the most acceptance among Indians.
