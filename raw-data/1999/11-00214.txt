I am not sure that this is the precise reference you are seeking, but
in the introduction to the Hitopadesa we learn about the king who
has 4 sons, all of whom have no interest in learning and are ill-
mannered.  I am certain that the king there make the statement
that one good son endowed with good qualities is better than 100
fools.  However, I think he gives an example of how the one moon
dispels darkness whereas any number of stars do not.

I am sorry but I do not have the sanskrit text at hand.

I hope this helps.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
