Subject: Looking for a book
Message-ID: <161227050682.23782.66264168668650425.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Could anyone let me know if any copy of this book exists in the United
States?

Bharadvajavrttibhasya on the Vaiseshika sutras; Gangadhar Kaviratna Kaviraja
(or Gangadhar Rai); Calcutta; 1869 (or 1870); Published by the Baptist
Missionary Press (Serampore)

The India Office Library at London had a copy but the same is presumably
lost.

Thanks in advance,

Vishal
