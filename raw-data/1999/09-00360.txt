  Does the skt cyut have any cognates in IE or Indo-Iranian ?  I looked
at CDIAL 4947, and it appears like a Dravidian word
  to me. The Tamil words coTTu (= water or any liquid drop, verb to
drip, dripping),
  cori (= drip, trickling down), coLLU = (drip, trickling down)
   (joLLu referred to by S. K. Chatterjee
  in his work on the origin and development of Bengali language) etc.
seem to
  be connected with skt. cyut.   Another Tamil word to be considered
  along with the entry(4948) in CDIAL is cunai (= mountain spring).

      Quite possibly 3352 is of Dravidian origin.
