As an afterthought:

I have a book on the Shulbasutras written by an Indian engineer which might be of
interest to you. Unfortunately, I haven't got it here in Oxford, it is in my home in
Oslo, but if you send me an email in the middle of July or so and remind me, I should
be back, and I can give you the bibliographic details. I have not had the opportunity
to read it yet, but from leafing through it, it looks quite interesting.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
