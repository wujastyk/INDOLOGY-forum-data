Note that,

1. The number 64 (16x4) is somewhat of a standard thing, comparable to 108
in religious contexts. Even if it were not so, the connection between 64
tiruviLaiyATal of Siva and the 64 tantras in saundaryalaharI is
non-existent.
2. The relative dating you propose would make either Jnanasambandhar a
contemporary of Ramanuja, or Sankara a contemporary of Nagarjuna, if not
Gautma Buddha himself. Both possibilities are quite incongruous.
3. If anything, surely you must be aware that Sankara's date has been
proposed to be after that of Sambandhar. Re: draviDaSiSu reference in
saundaryalaharI. However, this argument is quite inconclusive, for a number
of reasons.
