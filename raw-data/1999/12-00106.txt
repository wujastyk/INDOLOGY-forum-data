The story of the persecution of the Jains by Jnanasambandar has an
interesting development in Tamil. Sambandar's hymns, dated in 7th c.  refer
to disputation only. Nampiyandar Nampi, a Brahmin author of 11th c. was the
first to credit Sambandar with persecution of 8000 Jains. Some later
authors accept persecution story but try to exonerate Sambandar. The story
of persecution of 8000 is highly improbable.
T. P. Meenakshisunderanar deals with this problem in his book, Sambandarum
Samanarum (Sennai, Rudra Press, 1957).
Perhaps the latest publication on this problem is
A. Veluppillai, "The Hindu Confrontation with the Jaina and the Buddhist.
Saint Tirunanacampantar's Polemical Writings", The Problem of Ritual, ed.
T. Ahlback ( ?bo: The Donner Institute for Research in Religious and
Cultural History, 1993), pp. 335- 364.
