Coincidentally, I have been interested in these curses found in inscriptions
which reveal a lot about what the society considered matters of self-respect,
sin, etc. I planned to write on them sometime and had gathered interesting
data.

The common form of such a curse is "kagkaiyiTaik kumariyiTaik kurAl pacu
kon2RAn2 ceyta/kon2Ra pAvam koLvAn2". Variations are possible also.

I hope they say that due to orthography and not the contents of the curse.
Cursing is much older. This particular type of curse occurs in many
inscriptions. One example is an  inscription A.R. No. 538 of 1902 or SII.
vol. 8, no. 128 belonging to tiripuvan2ac cakkaravarttikaL maturaiyum Izamum
pANTiyan2 muTittalaiyum koNTaruLiya kulOttugkacOza tEvar's 27th regnal year.
The grant was issued by one kavuNiyar perumAn2 who was obviously a brahmin of
kauNDinya gotra. Apparently, the same person in another inscription curses a
person misappropriates a grant as "one who takes/carries water pot for the
Jains". Interestingly, the word for pot used here is "kUNTikai"

Hope this helps.
