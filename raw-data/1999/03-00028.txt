Subject: Ma~Nju/SrImUlakalpa and MaNimEkalai

correction:
K. P.  Jayaswal also says that Ma~Nju/SrImUlakalpa seems to
have been written from one pen and it did not grow from generation
to generation - and as it discusses the pAla period of 750A.D. it is
propably much older and not related to la.NkAvatAra (not to the
la.NkAvatAra's early layers at least) neither to South India as I
hoped.

I made a typo:

I meant that Ma~Nju/SrImUlakalpa is of course much younger (not
older) than the la.NkAvatAra's early layers as  early version of
la.NkAvatAra has been translated already in the early 5th cent. to
Chinese.
