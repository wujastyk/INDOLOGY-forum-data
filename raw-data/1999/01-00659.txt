The University of Chicago will be offering the following Sanskrit
courses in the summer of 1999:


                INTRODUCTORY SANSKRIT 1, 2, 3 (South Asia 250-251-252)
                June 21 - August 20, Monday - Friday,  10:00 - 12:00 AM

    This course sequence fulfills the Common Core foreign language
requirement.  The first half of the course sequence is spent mastering
the reading and writing of the Devanagari script and studying the
grammar of the classical Sanskrit language.  The remainder of the course
sequence is devoted to close analytical reading of simple Sanskrit
texts, which are used to reinforce the grammatical study done in the
first half of the course.  The aim is to bring students to the point
where they are comfortably able, with the help of a dictionary, to read
simple, narrative Sanskrit.


                INTERMEDIATE SANSKRIT 1, 2, 3 (South Asia 253-254-255)
                June 21 - August 20, Monday - Friday,  12:00 - 2:00 PM

    This course sequence is designed for students who have studied the
basics of Classical Sanskrit grammar and have some experience in reading
simple Sanskrit texts-- typically at least one year of prior study.  The
courses will consist of the reading of extended passages of Sanskrit
epic, dramatic, and poetic works and, depending on time available and
student interest, narrative and/or philosophical prose.  The goal of the
course is to develop facility in reading by exposing students to a
variety of styles and genres of Classical Sanskrit literature.
