>?From the biological standpoint, the oldest modern "Australoid" type that
I'm aware of comes from Niah Cave in Indonesia dating to about 25 to 30
thousand bp. There's no doubt, in my mind at least, that Dravidians are
strongly Australoid in character as were most of the oldest remains from
India (including Harappa).
