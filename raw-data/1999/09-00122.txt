I hope there is someone in the IndolList who knows an Indian calendar
expert. At "www.kalnirnay.com" there is a nice Indian calendar with data
valid for Bombay.
It has a very peculiar feature: every time a ksaya tithi comes along, its
ending time is 6gh (of 30gh per day) short of its neighbouring tithis; and
every there is an adhika tithi it is 6gh in excess of its neighbours. This
betrays itself if you look at the intervals between the successive tithis.
        For instance, if you look at Sept 99 in "kalnirnay", you find 08.31
for the end of tithi K11, 06.49 for K12, 29.23 for K13, and 28.16 for K14.
       Now, 6.49 (K12) minus 08.31 (K11) is 28gh18, and 28.16 (K14) minus
29.23 (K13) is 28gh53.
        But 29.23 (K13) minus 6.49 (K12)is only 22gh34, which is integer
6gh smaller than the intervals that flank it. Presumably there is some
astrological reason for this.
        If you know someone who could explain, I would be very much obliged
to hear from them and be able to get to sleep o' nights.
