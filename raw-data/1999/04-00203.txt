5.      SVATMAYOGAPRADIPAPRABODHINI -  AN EDITION AND STUDY
Dr. P.Chithambaran
Foreword by Dr.T.Devarajan
HB Demi 1/8 pp 316 Price Rs. 400/ ($80)
ISBN 81- 87084 ? 06 - 5
The book has two parts, one being the study of the work and the other, a
critical edition of the work.
The merit of the treatise is that it reviews the most comprehensive ideas
of a vast subject, the Advaita Vedanta in an accurate, well-arranged and
readable manner.  The author substantiates his views by quoting Upanisads
and other scriptures.  Another importance of this work is that it was
written at a time when the Advaita Vedanta was facing a setback at the
hands of the Dvaitins and Visistadvaitins.  For the above reasons, the
present work of Amarananda has an important place among the Prakarana
treatises of Advaita Vedanta.
