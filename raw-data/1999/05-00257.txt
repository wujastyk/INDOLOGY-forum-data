You will certainly find some useful help at the Jnana Dipa Vidyapith of
Pune. This Jesuit centre of learning has some fine indologists (unknown to
our list) and can be of great use to give information on  indologists  in
India. Contact  Prof. Subhash Anand and Prof. No?l Sheth at
<papal at pn2.vsnl.net.in>  Greetings. A. Nayak
