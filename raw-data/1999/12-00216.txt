That particular term, indeed, but a parallel term indicating that the
ultimate nature of causality is beyond human reason can be coined by
almost any school that runs into philosophical difficulties.

Yes.  But he has replaced one problem with another.  He has by-passed the
need for explaining samyoga between prakRti and puruSa by positing that
the former can only be apparent, but in so doing he has created a new
problem -- whence the 'samyoga' between Brahman and this apparency,
(Maya/avidhya)?  Sankara's detractors (Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka,
Vallabh, Baladev and even Siva/Sakti monists), in turn, never cease to
point out what they consider to be the achilles heel of Sankara's own
solution to the Samkhyan dilemma.

I am curious to explore to what extent Ramanauja's arguments defending the
necessity of a divine being are borrowed from Nyaya.  I have a sense that
the same basic theistic arguments just keep resurfacing.
