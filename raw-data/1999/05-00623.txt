I have just browsed through this work, Movement and Mimesis. Is there any
reason why no Tamil text on dance and mime was consulted? In distinguishing
between abhinayadarpaNa and bharatArNava the differences in the number of
single-hand gestures and double-hand gestures are listed in the book.
Interestingly, in aTiyArkkunallAr's commentary (13th/14th century AD) on
cilappatikAram, we get  numbers different from those in the Sanskrit texts.
The Tamil text has 33 for single-hand and 15 for double-hand. The
dance-cum-music text paJcamarapu which preceded the cilappatikAram commentary
has the same numbers. (The Tamil text uses many Tamilized Sanskrit technical
terms in addition to Tamil technical terms also.) I would appreciate
scholarly views on where abhinayadarpaNa was composed? Also, is there any
relationship between the nandikezvara of abhinayadarpaNa and nandikezvara of
nandikezvara kAzikA/kArikA. Thanks in advance.
