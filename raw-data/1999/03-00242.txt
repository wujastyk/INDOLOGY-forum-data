    Referring to the ongoing discussion on R.Kishna, while it is no
doubt the term pennai means the palm tree-now commenly known as
panaimaram, it is baffling to associate pennai/panai with riverbanks
and rivers as panai is a quintessential arid region vegetation.

  Cheras, the Kerala Chiefs in the Sangam age, have palmyra
  tree as their symbol even though their land is not arid
  and usually drenched by southwest monsoon.
