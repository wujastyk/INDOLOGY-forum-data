Subject: Postmodernistic Study of Sanskrit texts?
Message-ID: <161227044454.23782.12917343664316736292.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Reading Rita Gross, Buddhism after Patriarchy, SUNY.
This is a feminist reconstruction of Buddhism. A beautiful
study.

Like this, has there been any attempts to view the
Vedic material created by Indian priestly class from a
Postmodernist perspective?

Any citations?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
