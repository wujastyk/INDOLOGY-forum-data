Like Dr. Deshpande, I agree that tradition derives narayana
from nArA (water). However, additionally, we have an old tradition
where nara and nArAyana are told. The nara-narayana legend,
the great yogis from whose thigh Urvasi was born. Have seen
Gupta era friezes where two men sit underneath a tree,
they are generally thought to be nara and narayana.

V. Iyer
