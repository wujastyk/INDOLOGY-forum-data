   Aside: From the http://www.tamil.net archives,
   Newton's laws of motion in the comapact kuRaL meter.
   The kuRaL metrics was probably invented by Thiruvalluvar.

1) A body remains in its state of rest, or in constant motion unless
acted upon by an external force.

   vazicelcIrk kETum, nilaippERu mARRum
   veLivicai illAyin2 il.

2) Force is mass times acceleration.

   toTukkum vicaiyin2 aLavAm poruNmai
   muTukkam ivaRRin2 perukku.

3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

   uNTAm etirvin2ai evvin2ai tORumE
   on2RAm avaRRin2 aLavu.

Best,
V. Iyer
