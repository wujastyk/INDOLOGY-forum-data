Subject: Papers on Indian Goddesses needed
Message-ID: <161227053166.23782.771219884473640466.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hello,

I am studying in the department of Indology, Ankara University, Turkey.
I am expected to make a search on and compose a report about Indian
Goddesses as my thesis. The resources in Turkey about this subject are
limited. Can you help me locate some papers on this subject, or better,
send them to me?

Thank you very much,

Ozge Ozbek
