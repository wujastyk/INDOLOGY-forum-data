As I said before, this topic is very new but very impressive to me.
Could you give some reference to
Sperry model and how does it relate to the research done by Ramchandran?

I did not get that impression with the little reading that I have done
so far.

So do you intend to rule out all researches by all scholars because they
are biased?
Does it not expose your own bias?

I could not get the intent of your above paragraph.
Do you mean to say that Jaynes' ideas are purely irrelevant and no facts
can ever be found to support them?
Which is the explanation that you say fits ALL of the facts.

I had already mentioned that about 90% of the people who reviewed his
work at amazon.com are very supportive of him and have given his book 5
star rating. You seem to have some other reason to resist any further
discussion of his ideas. Personally, I do not like the idea of bicameral
mind but would prefer a different model.
Being a computer scientist, I could better relate to a model that
separates functioning of brain into hardware and software analogs. We
are seeing that a lot of functions that used to be done by software
(programs) are now being incorporated in the next generation of Intel
processors. This could apply to the process of learning and training by
the human brain. Just like the evolution accepted today is far different
from what was conceived by Darwin, we still acknowledge his contribution
to current knowledge.

I think that is the way science works and consistency in no virtue when
it comes to science.
It is only in theology and religion that dogma and absolute truth is the
rule.
One has to be ready to change his opinion as and when new evidence
becomes available.
I for one, am always willing to change my views without any hesitation
or loss of face.

I find your attitude very unscientific. I find nothing wrong in being
contradicted, proved false etc.
