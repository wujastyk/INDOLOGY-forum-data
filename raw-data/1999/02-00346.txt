Subject: UI fall semester study abroad program in Mysore, India

FALL SEMESTER IN MYSORE, INDIA

This new program (begun in fall '98) is based in the former princely
capital of Mysore on the southern Deccan Plateau, a moderate-sized city
with a delightful year-round subtropical climate and flourishing
silkweaving and sandalwood crafts industries, yet only 2 hours away from
Bangalore, India's bustling high-technology center.  Located in a former
courtly residence set in a garden, the program offers students in-depth
exposure to an ancient civilization and dynamic modern democracy, to a
"third-world" nation that is also the world's tenth biggest industrial
power.  Special features of the program include:

- no language requirement or prerequisite.  All courses are taught in
English, which is a common 2nd language throughout India.  Language
instruction (in Hindi, Kannada, or Sanskrit) is available as an elective.

- a variety of courses including civilization and literature, science
medicine and technology, and the changing status of women, with credit
fully transferable toward your UI degree.

- independent study and internship options during the final month of the
semester.

- guided tours to extraordinary historic sites (such as the imperial
ghost-capital of Vijayanagar and the exquisite temples of Belur and
Halebid) conducted by the former Director General of the Archaeological
Survey of India.

- costs kept as low as possible, with state unviersity students in mind
(1999 Program fees of $3200  include housing, tuition and excursions, plus
roughly $1500 airfare and $1000 for meals and personal expenses).
