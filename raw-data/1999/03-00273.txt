In V. K. Rajwade's edition of Jnaneshvari supposed to be linguistically the
oldest, I find that
(i) the order of the Sanskrit verses 22 and 23 is reversed when compared to
the Sanskrit text tradition, and
(ii) Jnaneshvara's Marathi commentary agrees with the reversed order.

My copy - the so-called sAkhare-mahArAja edition (original from 1901) seems to
be different in this aspect. The gItA verses are in proper order as well as the
marAThI commentary is consistent with it. The j~nAneshvarI verses are numbered
223-227. This is considered to be one of the authentic traditional editions,
although Rajwade - a historian as well, is said to have made extensive research
and claimed to have corrected many errors from the traditional editions. As the
history goes, his edition was not accepted by the "believers" and he was
unhappy about that. The detailed story is interesting!

As to the last questions of Harry spier: YES the marAThI commentary does
include all the gItA verses in proper order interspersed throughout the text.
There are occasional mistakes - presumably made by the copy-writers. I hope
this answers all the questions.
