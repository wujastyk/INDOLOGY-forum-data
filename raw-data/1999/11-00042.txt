There seems to be little in the way of unambiguous reference to writing in
the Valmiki Ramayana other than the references to Rama's signet ring,
famously given by him to Hanuman as a token of recognition for Sita.

At 4. 43 11 the ring is said to be svanAmANKopaZobhitam and again at 5.34.
2 to be rAmanAmANkitam. ( refs. are to the crit. ed.).   This would
certainly appear to suggest that some kind of writing was involved although
it is not, perhaps, conclusive..
