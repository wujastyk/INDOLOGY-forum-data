In my practical experience, although we Indians are such a mixed population,
we are a very discriminatory and communal people. I would certainly not put
this tendency just on the doorsteps of the Brahmins, if at all the Brahmins
sinned, it is the sin of being as communal as every other Indian.

India is made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of communities (castes).
Inter-marriage among the different castes is prohibited other than in
certain scheduled castes. If Brahmins were considered "upper caste" in the
true sense, then why doesn't a non-brahmin family appreciate it when a
member of their community marries a Brahmin. It should be thought of as a
step up the ladder :-)

Each of the hundreds of castes in India has different customs, cuisines,
etc. I wouldn't be surprised if  our segmenting ourselves into different
castes originally just started out as small family units setting themselves
apart.
