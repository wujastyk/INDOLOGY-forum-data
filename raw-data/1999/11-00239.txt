Though not vaDapazaniappan even in Madras :-)

Also are any of appUti aDikaL's sons named <Appar's
village name> (TirumunaippADi?)  + tirunAvukkaracu?

Analogous to kAlaDiccankaran, a boy named after
cuntarar would have to be called ArUr cuntaran. I do
not suppose this is encountered.

Precisely. It is for this reason that a name like
kAlaDiccankaran would be a redundancy and hence, I
guess, quite out of the ordinary.

Was the name popular even in the timeframe in

The age of this temple would naturally be of interest.

IMHO, improbable although not impossible.

On the other hand, let's look at occurrences of the
word or name cankara in the epigraphic record.

1. cankarappADiyAr. According to MTL, this is <
cakkarappADiyAr, so stands for oilmen. MTL gives a
SII reference for this.
2. cankaran in the meaning of warrior (< saMhAra)
according to MTL quoting yAzppANa akarAti.
3. cankara also means (persons) of mixed caste. Cf MTL
(< saMkara).

Noboru Karashima gives this reading for one epigraph
in his book. I don't have the reference handy but if I
remember right it is one of the AllUr or
IcAnamangalam inscriptions.

But he also quotes another epigraph where he eschews
even this reading saying the meaning is not clear
since "cankara" is encountered juxtaposed with another
obscure expression (azincikai?).

Among various entries for kAlaDi in the MTL, there are
a couple which are interesting: 1) nearby 2) a
subordinate person/ a person under protection

These are some possible lines of inquiry.

Hope this helps,

Warm Regards,

LS
