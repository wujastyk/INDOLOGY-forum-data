Message-ID: <161227053761.23782.14128251016323639484.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Does anyone know anything about these related topics:

1. The history of the manufacture of paper with European techniques
in India?

2. The import of European paper into India?

3. Watermarks in paper made or used in India?

Thanks for any help.
