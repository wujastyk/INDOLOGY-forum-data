Dear Dr. Scarbrough,

There does not exist yet any electronic index for word search in the BU.
However, please refer either of the following 2 printed word indices:
1. Vaidika Padanukrama Kosa; Compiled by Pt. Visvabandhu Sastri et al;
Visvesvarananda Vedic Research Institute; Hosiarpur; India--Volumes 9 and 10
deal with the Upanisads (first 6 are on the Samhitas, 7-8 on Brahmanas and
volumes after 10 deal with Vedangas etc.)
2. Eighteen Principal Upanisads; Ed. by Vadekar and Limaye; Vaidika
Samsodhana Mandala; Poona (Not sure of the Publisher. This book has a good
word Index as an Appendix).

The relevant volumes of #1 are also published separately as "Upanisadic
Citations." (Search under 'Visvabandhu' or' Bhimsena Sarma' when doing an
author search)

Any good library on Indology should have all these works.

Vishal

Has anyone come across the bRhadAranyaka upanishhat in electronic form
for doing a word search?
Thanks in advance.
David.
