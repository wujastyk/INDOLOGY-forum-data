wonder about the utility of "dating" materials to 4500 BCE. From that
point of view (if I understand LMF correctly), we may "date" shared
inheritances very early indeed. That my email today may mention the
story of Noah and his ark does not in any meaningful way connect my
composition with Biblical or pre-Biblical traditions or narratives --
does it?
