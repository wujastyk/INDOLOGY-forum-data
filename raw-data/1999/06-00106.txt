The experience of Turkey was a taboo subject in India and even MK
Gandhi, the so called secularist, supported the Khalfat movement of Ali
Brothers. There is no tradition of secularism in India at all comparable
to Kamal Pasha. Even to this day most muslims disdain Kamal Pasha and
Turkey is having hard time keeping secularist tradition. A moslem
fundamentalist party somewhat comparable to RSS in India had taken lead
in recent polls and had even given one Prime Minister.

It is very wishful thinking to assume that any one in India will be
interested in Turkish experiment. Even the Europeans do not support the
secularism in Turkey at the behest of Greece and did not let Turkey join
EU even though it is a member of NATO.

India has never been a secular country under Gandhi/Nehru dynasty which
has relied on the religious divisions to maintain their power base.
Gandhi/Nehru did not trust any muslim with any important position of
power while they were alive and had they been willing to compromise, the
division of India could have been avoided.


Have a peaceful and joyous day.
