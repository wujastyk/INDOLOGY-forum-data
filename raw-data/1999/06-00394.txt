Since there was no response to this question till now, here is a late
response. The episode is described in periyapurANam 2342-2350.

But there are internal contradictions within the story. To me the story is
based on a possible historical opposition by a segment of pANar to the
temple-based Sanskritic culture of medieval Tamilnadu. The status of pANar as
described by the zaivite (and vaiSNavite) traditions do not seem to be
factual.
