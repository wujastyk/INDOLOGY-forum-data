Dr. Wujastyk
Thank you for the information about Sharada script.  I wasn't sure where to
find this text but I searched your archive and found Dr. Slaje who knew the
address of Dr. Wezler and I will get the text from him.  For your other
members, I was also able to find some historical reference and information
from the following website also: http://jammu-kashmir.org/KOA/Languages/ .
Thank you for your help,
Vijay K. Dhar
