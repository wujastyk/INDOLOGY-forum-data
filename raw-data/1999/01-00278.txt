If this is true, then Tamil linguists identified IA much earlier than
originally thought.  Even Sir William Jones was sketchy about the
relationship of Sanskrit to other Indian languages.  He denied that
Hindi was in any way related to Sanskrit, but otoh believed that most
of what is now known as Austronesian was related to the modern
Indo-European family. However, he believed that Malay, Afghan and Palavi
were related to Semitic.

Could you tell me which writers classfied the Indo-Aryan languages as
"Arya" and which languages were included in that classification?  Did
they consider Tamil as closely related to other Dravidian languages?
