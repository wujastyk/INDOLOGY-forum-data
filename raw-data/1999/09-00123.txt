  I don't know the edition of the VJ you are referring to (would appreciate
the ref.)
VA: Vedanga Jyotisa of Lagadha in its Rk and Yajus Recensions ( With the
Translation and Notes of Prof. T. S. Kupanna Sastry); Ed. K. V. Sarma;
Indian National Science Academy; New Delhi; 1985

Please see the 'Introduction' of the volume.  Yes, differences in the dates
are discussed in brief and the reasons for the confusion is also stated.
Will appreciate your own comments on this issue.
_______________

Reference required by Dr. Michael  Witzel---
The Aryans: History of Vedic Period; K. C. Aryan and S. Aryan; Rekha
Prakashan; New Delhi; August 1998

The book is actually worse than that of Paramesh Chaudhary. Replete with
unsubstantiated fiction, baseless allegations.  A total waste of time and
money.

Hope these references help.

Best regards

Vishal
