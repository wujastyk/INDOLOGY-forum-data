I have replied in general to this msg directly to Ulrich.  As I
mention there, the Chinese have published a catalogue of some Sanskrit
mss.  The Japanese seem to have privileged access to some of this
material -- perhaps very fat wads of cash is the answer !
Their copy of the YBS is very likely to be the same one that
Sankrityayana partly transcribed and partly photographed -- his
material is held in Patna at present, as you probably know. By the by,
I have never been able to find out what exactly they do have there,
not having had the chance to visit.
I agree the chances of Xuanzang period mss having survived is highly
unlikely but it sounds a good *upaaya* to conceal the true orgin of
the mss.  Apart from the devastation cause by war -- the An-lu-shan
rebellion, the Tibetan and Uighur occupation of Chang-an, the Mongols
etc etc.  Apart from those events, the Chinese showed very little
interest in preserving the originals once they had been translated --
well, not the same interest as we would.  They often cut up the mss
and sold/used them as talismans or soaked them in water for
"medicinal" puposes !

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
