Andronov began his first lecture, "Dravidian and Aryan: From the Typological
Similarity to the Similarity of Forms" by saying,  "It is generally accepted
at present that Dravidian languages served as a substratum, underlying the Old
Indo-Aryan language, when the latter appeared on the Indian soil in the first
half of the second millennium B.C., and that the whole course of the
subsequent development of both Indo-Aryan and Dravidian was largely influenced
and predetermined by this circumstance. Their mutual influence on each other,
most probably, took shape of bilingualism of a great portion of themingling
peoples. The numerical superiority was, obviously, on the side of the
indigenous population, which is testified by the rapid change and complete
dissolution of the the ethnic type of the newcomers. One can suggest also that
in the first period of contact  bilinguals were recruited chiefly from the
native population."

It is clear that linguists  have addressed the issue of the nature of the
proto-language in relation to the South Asian situation more than 30 years
ago. In the SMU seminar Dr. Sjoberg cited Dr. Andronov?s views on the issue.
But still the Hindutva protogonists continue to blame Max Muller and
linguistics.

I had the pleasure of meeting Subhash Kak at the Seminar. As a person he is
very nice and courteous. But, his theory and methodology, are neither
innocuous nor "good science" as they seem to be.
