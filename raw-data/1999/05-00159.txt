1) Cutting off the Brahma's head at Tiru-kaNDiyUr
2) Vanquishing andakAsura at Tiru-kOvalUr
3) tripura dahanam at Tiru-adikai

5) Killing jalandhara at Tiru-viRkuDi
6) Fighting gajAsura at vazuvUr

UVS, the editor of Sangam texts, usually quotes the ancient
solitary verse (it cannot be dated):

pUman2 ciram kaNTi, antakan2 kOval, puram atikai,
mAman2 paRiyal, calantaran2 viRkuTi, mA vazuvUr,
kAman2 kuRukkai, yaman2 kaTavUr, - intak kAcin2iyil
tEman2n2u kon2Raiyum, tiGkaLum cUTitan2 cEvakamE!        (1)

Appar (fl. ca. 642 A.D.) has a list of these sites:

kAviriyin2 karaikkaNTi vIraTTAn2am
   kaTavUrvI raTTAn2am kAmarucI ratikai
mEviyavI raTTAn2am vazuvai vIraTTam
   viyan2paRiyal vIraTTam viTaiyUrtikkiTamAm
kOvalnakar vIraTTam kuRukkaivI raTTam
   kOttiTTai kuTivIraT TAn2amivai kURi
nAvilnavin2 RuraippArkku naNukac cen2RAl
   naman2tamarum civan2tamaren2 Rakalvar nan2kE.          (2)

Poem (1) has viRkuTi, In its place, (2) has kOttiTTaikkuTi.

V. Iyer
