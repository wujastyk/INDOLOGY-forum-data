I disagree with both of them if this is the type of footnote they have
in mind.
I fail to see what is relevance of the reference and why does one have
to read some one else's opinion however irrelevant it may be, in order
to be able to post his/her own views?
Is it not "you scratch my back and I will scratch your back" philosophy?
To me this appears as another form of spamming by trying to sell some
one
else's books or works and nothing else

Does the study of Indology has been degraded to the level where
recitation of old writers in the tradition of 'Praman' and Treaties is
the only justification for scholarship? Is there anything wrong with
some one doing own study of original texts etc. and proposing a new
insight? To be considered a science with the suffix 'logy', Indolgy,
like any other field of scientific study, must allow freedom of inquiry
no matter how heretical it may be. Each opinion has to be judged on its
own merit.

Even if some one makes a facetious posting, most keyboard are fully
equipped with 'del' key. Just because a message has been posted does not
mean that it has to be answered by every  one else.
