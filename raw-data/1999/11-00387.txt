Subject: Diacritics font

The Institute for Indology and Tamil Studies offers one font (called IITS)
containig all the diacritics needed for the transliteration of Sanskrit and
related languages, of Dravidian languages and of some Tribal languages.
The font is easy to use in Word for Windows, once you install your
keyboard-layout (through the insert-symbol-shortcut key function) with those
signs that you need. I use this font mixed with Times New Roman, through a
macro that allows to switch fonts with a single key-stroke.
You can download the font from the home-page of the Institute:
