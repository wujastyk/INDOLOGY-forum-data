George Hart "The Ancient Tamil Poems: their milieu and their Sanskrit
counterparts":
page 118-119:

"...This shows how the indigenous customs spread to into Indo-Aryan culture:
before a group was assimilated, Brhamins would come into it and adopt those
values
most admired by that group in order to gain respect. Thus the custom would
have gained
foothold in the Brahminic religion and would be perpetuated when descendants
of the Brahmins wrote lawbooks or copied texts with appropriate insertions.
Today, an ideal of chastity not too different from the early Tamil one
pervades
virtually all of India, being perceptibly stronger than it was in medieval
India....[deleted]
This trait of Hinduism, virtually universal today, spread from indigenous
groups, chiefly from the Deccan culture of the Dravidians, and was embraced
more and more by Aryan society....."


So the very foundation of Valmiki Ramayanam itself, moral and epic,  is
Dravidian.
