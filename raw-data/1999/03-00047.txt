Is there authortity for that?  I had assumed that the use
of anusvAra here was due to ignorance or font limitations.
Other applications of torli (P.8.4.60) occur in gItA:

      18:17    imAn lokAn -->    imAMllokAn
      18:71  SubhAn lokAn -->  SubhAMllokAn

where Ml represents a nasalized-l  (in nAgarI, candrabindu
above first "l" not previous syllable as often printed).

Translations to hand take puNyakRtAm as genitive plural of
puNyakRt: worlds of the meritorious (=merit-performers), but
I see no objection to taking puNyakRtAn as accusative plural
of bahuvrIhi puNyakRta: worlds prepared for the meritorious/
created by merit (as dvaita/advaita interpretations).
