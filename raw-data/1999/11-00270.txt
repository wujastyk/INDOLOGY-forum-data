Subject: "Top Five" Philosophy Works
Message-ID: <161227053795.23782.11424328823787456539.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In a recent Baruch College poll of philosophers (I don't know who was included), the following were named as the top five books and the top five articles in philosophy in the 20th century:

The Top Five Books:

1. Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations
2. Heidegger, Being and Time
3. Rawls, A Theory of Justice
4. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
5. Russell & Whitehead, Principia Mathematica

The Top Five Articles:

1. Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"
2. Russell, "On Denoting"
3. Godel, "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica & Related Systems"
4. Tarski, "The Concept of Truth & Formalized Languages"
5. Sellars, "Empiricism & the Philosophy of Mind"

As you can see, the lists contain nothing at all from Eastern Philosophy.

A colleague of mine has asked what 20th century work (book and/or article) of Eastern Philosophy would be a candidate for inclusion on such a list.  His tone implied that the answer is "none."
 
Does anyone on the Indology list have a suggestion and/or an opinion?
