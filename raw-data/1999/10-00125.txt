"From the confines of samania to lahanUr,
There is no walled (city) but kasUr."

Mr. Thornton suggests that lahanUr is corruption of luhanagar, nUr being the
Dakhani form of nagar, as appears from the names of other towns, such as
Kalanore, Kananore, &c.

Rashid-ud-din, in his jAmiut tawarikh, completed in A.H. 710, or A.D. 1310,
calls it lahUr, "than which," he says, "there is no stronger fort."

al biruni also mentions Lahore as a Province, the capital of which was
"mandhukur", on the east of the river irAwA (ravi). baihanki calls it
"mandkakUr".

Lahore is also called by the Mahomedan historians lohAr, loher, and
rAhwar...>

What was the original name of Lahore?

Can anybody identify the towns Kalanore, and Kananore? I know many names in
South India ending in -nUr where -n- and -Ur are not from nagar. Ur means a
town, village, etc.

How are the names, lahanUr, kasUr, mandkakUr, etc., explained etymologically?
Are there any more town or village names in the Punjab region (in India and
Pakistan) ending in -Ur? Thanks.
