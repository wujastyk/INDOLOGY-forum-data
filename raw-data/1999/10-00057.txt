Subject: Explanation needed for the word 'angula'
Message-ID: <161227052762.23782.14985519317829455186.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list-members,

Can anyone tell me whether the word 'angula', which is used for a
measure of length in the Brahmanas and Sutras (and possibly also
many other places), literally means 'finger'?  I am curious as to
whether this unit was intended as being the breadth of a finger.

Any help would be appreciated.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
