>?From my own standpoint, the basis of the South Asian population is what
has been called Munda Dravidian.  This type is generally short, dark,
mesorrhine and prognathous, just like the populations of Harappan, the
Megalithic or other early Indian cultures. In the south, there well may
have been demographic flow between India and East Africa as suggested by
the ancient and medieval Greeks and Roman writers.

In Assam, and in regions of Bihar, Bengal and NE UP, near the border
with Nepal there is a strong "Mongoloid" admixture. Sometimes this is
visible in other areas such as near the coast in parts of southern
India.

In the Punjab and Pakistan, there is some obvious overlap with Afghan
and Iranian populations. Gene flow of this type if found in every region
in the world and is nothing to be scared of.  However, I will agree that
none of this necessarily supports the ideas of AIT.
