No, please show a little restraint in such cases.  Do not break the rules
of this list just because someone else does so.

To Everyone:

INDOLOGY postings *must* be restricted to the study of Classical and
Ancient India.

I ABSOLUTELY INSIST THAT DISCUSSIONS OF CURRENT OR RECENT POLITICS DO NOT
APPEAR ON THIS LIST.  SEVERAL MEMBERS SEEM UNABLE TO SHOW THE COMMON
DECENCY OF FOLLOWING INDOLOGY GUIDELINES.  I AM BEGINNING TO CANCEL
SUBSCRIPTIONS WITHOUT WARNING WHEN LIST GUIDELINES ARE NOT ADHERED TO.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
