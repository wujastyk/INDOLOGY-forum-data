Subject: wall lizard and vishnu
Message-ID: <161227048765.23782.6690096547113350185.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Have seen a wall lizard sculpture very near the mUlabera
of the Kanchipuram varadarAja(aruLALa) perumAL temple.
In some other Vishnu temples too, in South East Asia
also.

Is there any temple legends connecting wall lizard (palli)
with Vishnu? In Alvars? In Vaishnava works from Sanskrit?

Thanks for any leads,
N. Ganesan
