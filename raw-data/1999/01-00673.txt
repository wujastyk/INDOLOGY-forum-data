Subject: History of fireworks in India?
Message-ID: <161227045840.23782.11842096202030333370.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hi it's said that salpetre has been used
by Indians for fireworks before Brits/Moslems arrived
to the subcontinent.

Can anyone please send me email of
references where such activity has
taken place in India during this time?

Thanks

Peter
