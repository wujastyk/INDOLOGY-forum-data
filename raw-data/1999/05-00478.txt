 Sounds much like what Madhav Deshpande has wriitten over the years;
Also, the recent Indological postings by Palaniappan on potter-priest
alliances/cooptions.

Is the pre-Aryan (Harappan) culture's influence on the Aryan
sacrifice expressed through the mahAvedis of agnicayana ritual?
There is no word for brick in RV and IVC is full of them;
This contrast declines after a few centuries. Eg., Mahavedis.

So, can the ShulbasUtras be attributed to more of Harappan culture,
rather than the heritage of the arriving Aryans into IVC?

SM
