The jaina conversion theory was related to me by an uncle [we are hebbAr],
but seems spurious.  As far as ayyangAr dialects are concerned, does
anyone know of phonologies/grammars/etc. of SrIvaiSNava dialects of tamil?
The only study I know of is AK Ramanujan's essay on Iyer vs. Iyengar
dialects in "Structure and Change in Indian Society" (Singer and Cohn
eds.)...
