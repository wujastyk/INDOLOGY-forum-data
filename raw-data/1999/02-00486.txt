This time I am sending the data for pattup pATTu (after taking care of
akam, puRam and maNimEkalai in my previous postings. I checked
against J.V. Chelliah's translation (Ten Tamil Idylls)
that was published long back by kazhakam


To summarize, the word "potiyil" is
* not used at all to refer to Mount Potiyil
* used 3 times to refer to a public hall (or a hall for worship?)
        (H7, H8, H9)

H7 = tiru-226 (Chelliah, p.355)
H8 = matu-161 (Chelliah, p.241)
H9 = paTTi-249 (Chelliah, p.45)

I hope this is useful to somebody :-)
 Naturally, people are usually more interested in positive :-))
 than in negative evidences :-(
