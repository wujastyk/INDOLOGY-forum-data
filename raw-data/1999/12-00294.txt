No doubt the Advaitavedaanta is fundamentally a kind of adaptive
response to Madhyamaka ideas. But it is less obvious that the term
maayaa itself is really derived from Buddhist sources.

The last line should read tathotpAdas etc.

The reference here is to the abhidharma debates concerning
conditioned phenomena.

So translate:
The arising (of dharmas) has been referred to [in scripture] as like
a magical trick (maayaa), their (period of) presence as like a dream
and their breaking up is like a gandharva city.
