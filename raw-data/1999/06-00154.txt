Samar, why don't you get yourself Colson's Teach Yourself Sanskrit? Then you
would immediately know that "Sanskrtam" has nothing to do with Dravidian, and
that the ending -am is a very common ending for skt. nouns.

Claiming that Sanskrit is of Dravidian origin undoubtedly creates happiness in
the South. However, there is no foundation for such a claim. The similarities
between Sanskrit and Dravidian languages can be explained as area linguistic
features. All this has been discussed on Indology on a regular basis and you
should consult the archives. You might also want to read an introduction to
comparative Indo-European linguistics, and you might also want to read Dixon's
The Rise and Fall of Languages (a short, but informative book).
