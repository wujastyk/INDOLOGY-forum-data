>because she knows she does not really have the strength to leave her

>so there is a question answered, which is immediately followed by her
>catching fire.  next we see sita alone in the garden and we think, 'oh no,
>she's going to think radha just couldn't make the move and really she is
>dead, oh tragedy!' ... next thing we see the alive radha and the film
>ends. so i think this was all basically dramatic intensity, entertainment
>value at bottom.
>regarding underlying meanings: a) the filmmaker does not send radha back
>into the non-arms of her husband; that is an important point. b) the
>filmmaker also allows radha to live thru fire, as did sita [of the
>ramayana]. two things: her purity has been proven, no? just like sita. so
>the filmmaker implies: she is not impure because she loves sita.  two, she
>allows her to live which is a sort of melodramatic way of saying, 'there
>is/can be/should be hope for you, radha and for you sita,' kinda thing.

>so, my analysis of this is literal, that radha does in fact live, burned
>and scarred, but she lives. my next question remains unanswered:  the
>filmmaker means to imply a kind of hope by keeping both women alive and
>getting both of them away from their abusive/neglectful husbands. what she
>and her film do not answer, is, what now? after the dramatic-viewer-'phew'
>-relieved garden scene conclusion, what then? how do they live this life
>and survive in the culture that [atleast in terms of gender equality] has
>just been summarily abominated by the film? (abominated is too strong,
>but you get my gist :) this reminds me of the scene in 'amistad' when the
>'heroic british' (??) free the slaves and they all run out in high
>dramatic happy form ... to where? who? how? these aspects are unconvincing
>largely, i suppose.
>just my thoughts,
