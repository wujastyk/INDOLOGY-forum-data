I suppose one can express a different point of view without 'blaming' others. 

Dr. Keerthi Kumar should be complimented for bringing a breath of fresh air
into the study of semantics(http://www.datanumeric.com/dravidian/)DISCOVERY OF
DRAVIDIAN AS THE COMMON SOURCE OF INDO-EUROPEAN "...we not only witnessed
Dravidian birthmarks on Indo-European in the shape of phonetic
correspondences, but the testimonies of not a handful but more than four
hundred and fifty Indo-European root-words is not to prove the same fact again
and again but to demonstrate and illustrate the great antiquity, endurance,
and importance of Dravidian..." (p.83)

The following are the principal sources used or IE examples:
(1) JS: The Origins of English Words: A discursive Dictionary of Indo-European
Roots, By Joseph T. Shipley; The Johns Hopkins University Press; Baltimore,
London, 1982. (2) Pei: The Families of Words by Mario Pei; Harper & Brothers,
New York, 1962. I do not know how representative these works are of IE
linguistic studies.
