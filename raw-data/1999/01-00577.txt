Can someone recommend an exhaustive work on Indian
calendar-making? I am particularly interested in
the interaction between lunar, solar, and sidereal
zodiac-based (nakshatra) calendars, and the relative
importance given to each in the various parts of India.

In particular, I would like information on which
parts of India use which calendar for marking
daily events, and how their use of this calendar
was reconciled with the Vedic/brahmanic ritual
practices.

Thanks,
Mani
