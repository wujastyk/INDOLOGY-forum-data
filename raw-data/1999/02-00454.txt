Dear Mr. Gantsen,

There are several families of Saiva Vellalas practising
Naa.dii in TiruvaanaikkAval in Tiruchy Town and
Vaidheeswaran Koil in Thanjavur district. This
tradition is their hereditary profession. I am not aware
of naaDii as a family tradition among Smartas.

For the hold of astrology on another section of Tamil society,
please read:
R. S. Perinbanayagam, The karmic theater: self, society
and astrology in Jaffna, U. Massachussetts press, 1982, 212p.

It will be interesting.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
