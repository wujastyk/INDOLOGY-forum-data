Subject: CSX+ Fonts and ISO draft standard for transliteration
Message-ID: <161227054033.23782.3702596439915490746.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,

The  recent discussion about fonts for transliteration of devanagari made me
wonder about the two following points which I think are relevent.

1) Are CSX+ encoded fonts the only ones presently available that fully
implement the ISO draft standard for the transliteration of Indian
languages.

2) Are Dr. John Smith's fonts (which I use and appreciate very much,
particularily the times roman) the only ones currently available that
implement the CSX+ encoding.
