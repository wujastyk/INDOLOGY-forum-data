This is known as the varAha carama sloka. It is not in
extant versions of the varAha purANa.

The three carama slokas (Gita, Ramayana, and Varaha) are
used almost mantraically and are treated specially by the
tradition.  Recently, I saw a tract by the Tridandi Jiyar
Swami which quoted a Narasimha carama sloka as well.
This is not present in the early acharyas' writings.

Sri Vaishnavas quote far more than these four in support
of their doctrine of prapatti.  You may wish to see
Abhinava Ranganatha Parakala Swami's "gUDArthasangraha",
a voluminous commentary on Sribhashya 1.1.1, where he
discusses the origin of the prapatti doctrine in extenso.
