My copy of Belvalkar's critical edition (B.O.R.I. 1968) only gives
pranaSTas, the second version and mentions the alternative as occurring in
"some MSS " without any explicit reference.

I will defer to the true grammarians, but the exception is standard. I
believe that the "pra" is not considered the part of the pada and hence
does not invoke conversion rule n->N. There are some exceptions to the "non
conversion" listed.

Again, my copy only has kSatrakarma and the only other variant listed is a
kSatrakaM karma (pardon me if I am mixing conventions, but I am more
comfortable with ITRANS). There is a long list of manuscripts using this. I
believe the kSattra variation belongs to the earlier discussions about the
double t.

This time, I am confused about the notation. It appears that the only
difference is the visarga at the end and my edition does have it without
any additional comments. So, it is most likely a  misprint in your edition!

About the transliteration convention, should it be gacchantyamUDhAH ? I
mean should there be an "a" after the "y" and the "d" replaced by "Dh" to
conform to devnagari? Pardon my ignorance about the HK notation.
