This is true. In fact, if you ever visit a place called Pajakakshetra, which
is not too far from Udupi, you will see several large holes in the sides of
the granite hills. These holes are said to have been made by Parashuram's
axe when he threw it while creating the land for the Brahmins to live in. It
is interesting to note that, although the holes are in the sides of the
granite hills, they are always full of clean fresh drinking water even in
time of drought.

Kindest regards
