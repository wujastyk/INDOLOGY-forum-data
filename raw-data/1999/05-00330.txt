Dear Dr. Jean-Luc,

Does 'paravai' in akam 44.16
    *pazam pal nellin2 pal kuTi paravai*
      refer to the land/field or not? Thanks.

Thanks to Chandra who located this gem:

    kurava nITiya kon2RaiyaG kAn2in2vAy
    varaku vALil tolaiccunar pATalin2
    arava vaNToTu tEn2in2am yAzceyum
    *paravai mAnilam* pan2n2iru kAtamE.

This CiivakacintAmaNi poem 1196 elegantly portrays
millet harvesters singing and, the beetle and honey
bees making music to resemble yAzh(Veena) accompaniment.
UVS writes 'paravai maanilam' as "parappai uTaiya
periya pUmi", (large tract of land). Hence, the
usage of 'paravai' as land/field/tract is attested in
the literature from early on.

So, Campantar's line, *karunal paravai kamaz kAzi* can
be translated as "KAzi, surrounded by sugarcane fields
issuing its fragrance".

Summary: karumpu=karunal=kan2n2al

Regards,
N. Ganesan
