Dear Nobumi Iyanaga,

Dr. Gouriswar Bhattacharya has recently published an article entitled
`The trio of prosperity : a Gupta terracotta plaque from Bangladesh' in
South Asian Studies 12 (1996): 39-47.
I quote the abstact with the entry on this publication in the ABIA South
and Southeast Asian Art and Archaeology Index, an annotated bibliography
and database, of which vol. 1 has just been published:

`Presents a terracotta plaque from the Gupta period in the Bangladesh
National Museum Dhaka with a seated Gaja-Laksmi flanked by a two-armed
Ganesa and perhaps Kubera. Dates it to the 5th century A.D. Shows the
iconographic development of such triads by comparisons to similar, 7th
to 12th-century pieces from North Bengal and Rajasthan.' (ABIA Index
1996, entry no. 138).
