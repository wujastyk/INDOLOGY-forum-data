Respected Dr. Thomspon,

A very detailed point to point response was sent to you privately, with cc:
to Drs. Vassilcov/Swantham. Copies can be sent to other list members upon
request.
To comment on just one statement in your post:

GT: "Rajaram, put some facts on the table. Then let us debate them."
VA: Why not check the archives of this very list using the following names:
1. Vidynath  2. SNS  3. kalyan  4. Ebryant  5. raoul
Your responses to their literally dozens of objections have been either
non-existent or non-academic or untenable.
Apparently, you are unfamiliar with opposing views. For a start, please
refer the following websites:
1. Koenraad Elst's Indology Website (Read the articles section--a rebuttal
of Sergent's work etc. )
http://members.xoom/koenraadElst
2. http://www.sumsar.com/waves/
3. Dr. Rajaram's Homepage
http://members.tripod.com/nsrajaram/kalidas.html
4. Archives at:
http://sarasvati.listbot.com
5. http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/aryan
6. http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient_history.html
This should be good for a start. And do not dismiss these as 'Propaganda'
and rather give academic responses.
