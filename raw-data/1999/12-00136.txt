Subject: Macintosh font query

With apologies if this question has already been dealt with in the recent
fonts thread (which, unfortunately, I didn't follow): A colleague recently
asked whether I knew of any fonts which --
        (a) work with Macintosh computers;
        (b) contain the diacritics necessary to transliterate classical Sanskrit;
        (c) still retain the Scandinavian diacritics (primarily ?, ?, ?) in their
standard positions (so that they will work with a normal Scandinavian
keyboard); and
        (d) look nice. (This last point is admittedly a subjective one, but some
Mac fonts I've seen have decidedly ugly features, like a macron placed
above the dot of a long 'i' rather than replacing it, etc.)

Being a PC user myself, I couldn't really help. If someone else can, please
email me privately at <martin.gansten at teol.lu.se> (unless you deem the
question to be of public interest).

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
