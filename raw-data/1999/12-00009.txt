>?From the look of things, it seems Elst would have to write that
although Kochhar is an Indian and a scientist, he believes that the
Aryans entered India from outside and therefore he is in the same
camp with Hitler (as Elst wrote about me in another piece on his
website).

You'll see that Elst has this odd preoccupation with Hitler. He
brought H. into his 'review' of Deshpande & Bronkhorst too, as we
see. On the other hand, he falsely reprimanded me for supposedly
doing this (he calls this 'smearing') to one of his friends, so don't
expect any consistency, or even fairness. Keep this in mind in your
further reading, also of his messages on this list. (If anyone here has
a clue as to why Elst does this, please let me know. I'm curious.)
