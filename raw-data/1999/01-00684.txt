        I deliberately translated this to "milk rice"
to point out the problem. If Mani meant Thiruppavai
then this the closest text to pongal one can find.
(I have committed to memory all poems of ThiruppAvai as I recite
at least one poem everyday
throughout the year and )I could not find any text closer
to pongal than this.

Does Mani have in mind some other composition of ANdAL?
