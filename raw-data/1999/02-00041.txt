Dear Indologists,

As fas as Buddhism in South India is concerned, only
Nagarjunakonda or Amaravarti is known outside India.

Several Buddha and Avalokitezvara sculptures have been
unearthed in Tamil Nadu. The Buddhist epic, maNimEkalai
and a Tamil grammar, VeeracOziyam by puttamittiran2Ar
are available also.

Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai (Madras) has brought out
two new publications:
1) Buddhism in Tamil Nadu.
2) Archaeological atlas of the antique reamins of
Buddhism in Tamil Nadu (many photographic plates).

For ordering information to your Institute library, please
contact IAS, Chennai at ias at xlweb.com or Dr. Patrick Harrigan,
Inst. of Asian studies at harrigan at xlweb.com

With kind regards,
N. Ganesan
