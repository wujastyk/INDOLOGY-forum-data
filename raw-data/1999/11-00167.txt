What? From Bihar to Ceylon? To get to Ceylon from Bihar you'd have
to first cross Ujjain itself.

>As regards vegetarianism, this is a later development in both Buddhism and

I doubt it. The spirit of his teachings deny it.
Compassion = no killing.

Sometime back I met a Lankan bhikshu in Madras. He was staying in a
three star hotel! Anyway I asked him about vegetarianism. He cooly
asserted that the Buddha didn't enforce it. I questioned him whether
it was true that the Buddha forbade the eating of meat, where something was
killed specifically to feed a bhikshu. He said yes, but also immediately
said it didn't make any difference because the meat that he ate was bought
in a shop.

But then why would they sell meat in a shop, if people didn't eat it?
It is because that people like him ate it, that the shop sold meat,
which was what caused an animal to be killed.

He looked confused for a minute and said all this wasn't practical in
normal day to day life!

Whoever said, that to be a bhikshu - to renounce the world - is being
practical? If you want to live your normal life, then live it - why
pretend to be a follower of the Buddha? The point in Buddha not condemning
meat was that his bhikshus were supposed to beg for food. So whatever they
got, which was generally the leftovers of the common people, they were
supposed to be satisfied with it - even if it be meat - and not be choosy
about the food they ate. But if food is specifically cooked for the bhikshu
and if some animal was killed to specifically for that purpose, the bhikshu
was supposed to refuse such food. In short the motto is : eat what is
available. But if something is prepared just for feeding you, make sure it
doesn't involve killing.

To misinterpret this as Buddha didn't endorse vegetarianism, is to miss the
spirit of his teachings. And this trend seems common in countries where
eating meat is part of the culture, thus justifying practices not compatible
with Buddhism.
