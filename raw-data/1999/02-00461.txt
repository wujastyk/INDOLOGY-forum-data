Dear list members,
Can anyone tell me something about the "International
Conference-Seminar on Ramayana and Mahabharata" sponsored
by the International Association for Tamil Research, to be
held in Kuala Lumpur in October?  I received their little
brochure about it, but no one I have asked seems to know
much. Are any of you attending? >Thanks!
Patricia Greer
