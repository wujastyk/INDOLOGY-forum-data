Dear Beatrice Reuch,
It seems to me that Drona's destitution is nothing unusual or inexplicable if one remem-
bers the ancient Indian caste restrictions. Till a generation ago in India, it was
noticeble  in this form of destitution  was often forced upon persons who could find
the job as allowed  to them in their caste.
Drona was a Brahmin, he could earn a reasonable standard of living ONLY by being a
good teacher.  No matter what his family connections he could not have had a share in
the revenues or land holdings or incomes allowed to kshatryiyas. The request made by him
to Drupad should not be seen as demand for money or wealth but for status and patronage.
Even if Drupad had given him half his kingdom, social norms could have permitted Drona
the Brahmin to live the life of a ruling class kshatriya. It would have been compulsory
for Drona to have returned or distributed that wealth among the needy or learned.
Drupad failed in his obligation as a "friend". It is permitted to seek help from  a
friend,  but not from a father-in-law. Even to this day in India , those who proudly
observe the traditional rules of inheritance would not accept a status conferred on
them by the in laws. In ancient society kings often married their daughters to rishis.
But the rishis were not allowed to share kingly wealth. It was a "ritual" to confer a
kingdom on a saint or arishi or a sanyasin, who would return it to the donor to be kept
as "his" property.  Drupad failed not only as a friend but as kshatriya also. These
ways of demonstrating magnanimity and mutual bonds.
I cannot quote any smritis to support my argument. But this was a customary law that
can be seen in many puranic myths.
