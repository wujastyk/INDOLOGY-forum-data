Actually, the native Indian speaker does *not* have retroflexion in 'three' -- this word is pronounced with a dental stop and dental stops are pretty consistently distinguished from retroflex stops in all the Indian languages that I've heard! The word 'two' has retroflexion, but retroflex stops tend to show variation with alveolar stops in Indian English -- for some speakers, at least.
