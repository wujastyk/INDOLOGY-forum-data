Before one reaches any conclusions on this, one should consider that the
equivalent of DAkinI perhaps occurs first in Tamil cilappatikAram, (if only
DAka is the form found earlier in Sanskrit texts) in the following line.

iTu piNam tin2n2um iTAkin2i pEy vAgki (cil.9.21)

Here iTAkini (Skt. DAkinI) is a goblin which eats the corpses at the burial
ground. The episode is an interesting one.

I have shown in earlier Indology postings that cilappatikAram must be
pre-Kalidasa. Also the date of Lankavatara Sutra had also been discussed
earlier.
