But that does not mean it is necessarily good journalism. In fact, in many
instances, it's pretty bad. Lousy to be precise.

To believe that "scholars" cannot be political is dogmatic too. There have
been many scholars who kept involved in political theorization and
activism. I see no problems with that. We also need to define what is
politics and what is not.

Like I said before, to play apolitical often is a ploy to keep critics and
criticism out of the way. So, playing/preaching "apolitical" often is
purposefully political.

Yes, I agree. That's exactly what is happening in India and abroad in the
name of Hindutva. Imposition, appropriation, and extermination is the name
of the game.

Then are we saying that ancient Hindu and Buddhist kings and statespersons
never preached beyond the borders of India? Or, are we implying whatever
regions were under their preaching mission are/were all nothing but parts
of Hindu India or Bharatvarsha?


Just my two cents.

p.s. -- In my opinion, one "scholar" publicly calling another names
(communist or anti-Indian or whatever) is not quite scholarly.
