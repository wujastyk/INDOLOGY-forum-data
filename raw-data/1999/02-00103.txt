Subject: Word splitting & hyphenation conventions in roman              transliteration
Message-ID: <161227046079.23782.3398811398402514269.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

the standard is in my opinion:
tat hi or taddhi or in roman tad-dhi but as fas as I have learned never tad dhi.
All publications just do not accept the writing tad dhi. Some prefer taddhi
(sandhi), others
tad-dhi (problem)  and others tat hi (without sandhi)
greetings
