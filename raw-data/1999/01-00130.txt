Hi Samar

you made your point, but then again what's hindu?sm?

I think you're mistaken here, I cannot tell from experience, but being
familiar with Plato's Symposion and remembering stories about cynics and
knowing many a antique Greece myth, the qualification of prudery doesn't
seem to me to be fitted for Greece in the mentioned period. Michel Foucault
in his 'History of Sexualitiy' rejects this view as well. It seems to me
that pudery is inevitably linked up with semitic religions. Those Arabs and
Jews seem to have sexual problems. Christianity introduced prudery into
Europe and Greece and the moslims did the same in India and other countries
in the Far East.
