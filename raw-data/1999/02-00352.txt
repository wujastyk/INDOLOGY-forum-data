"From Early Vedanta to Kashmir Saivism", Natalia Isayeva, SUNY Press,
1995. He also accepts the saguNa, nirguNa distinction. Nevertheless,
sha.nkara finds some faults with the sphoTa theory of BratR^ihari. Not
to mention the paramArthasAra of bhagvAn seshha (not to be confused
with the paramArthasAra of abhinavagupta which came much later), who
Hacker thinks preceded sha.nkara (Padoux seems to accept this). So we
can certainly say that there were philosophies, at least close to
advaita as expounded by Gaudapada and sha.nkara, much before
gauDapAda.

As for prachAnna bauddha I wonder if you know of a certain Buddhist
writer called bhavya. He disputes allegations that the mahAyAna theory
was prachAnna vedAnta! He was before sha.nkara (~500s). Take a look at
"The Vedanta Philosophy Described by Bhavya in his MadhyamakahRdaya",
V.V.Gokhale,  IIJ-2, 1958, pp.165-180. So bhAskara's writings which
came much later do not prove that Buddhist theories were absorbed into
advaita just at the time of sha.nkara or so. Certainly, there was much
influence of the Buddhist school on advaita. Why, is that a problem?
