>?From a private communication it appears the above needs some
clarification:

In van Buitenen the entry is "tasyArAdhanam".  Apte's dictionary under
"ArAdhanam" has a reference to Bg. 7.22 (without an actual quote).  J.
G. Jacobs has "Bg. 7.22 tasyArAdhanam" under the entry "ArAdhan" and no
entry for "ArAdhanam".


Many apologies,
