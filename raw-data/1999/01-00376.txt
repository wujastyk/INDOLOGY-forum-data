Hope Dr. Jean-Luc Chevillard who knows Tamil well, will forgive
me for quoting a 5th century and 8th century poem on Pongal.
Longing for the day when he or Thomas Lehmann or Ulrike Niklas
will write a book on Tamil poetics, ie., a study and translation
of TolkAppiyam, PoruL atikAram. In English preferably.

I will abide by his advice to restrict less than mA: The problem
is remembering Tamil parallels from pre-10th century literature
and feeling that that is relevant to a particular discussion.
I agree: avoid political flames even after seeing cornered with
wrong/insufficient info. Have not told anybody to join
Indology realizing it may not be good, imagine the day when
all Indians have access to web :-)

Back to Pongal:
****************
 The Bhogi festival is Indra festival in CilappatikAram
(conservatively 5th century AD)
