All this altavista search shows is that the altavista database
consists  of a majority writing about kaNNaki are educated in english
medium schools and hail from cities like Madras. Establishment
newspapers in English render kaNNaki as kaNNagi, and this in turn,
spreads the kaNNagi usage. I have even heard "akanAnURu", a sangam
text pronounced (wrongly) as "aganAnURu" instead of "ahanAnURu"!
Effect of wrong transliteration into English and then, that spelling
spoken as such. It will be better if kaNNaki gets written as such.

On 4-Mar-98, Dr. Palaniappan wrote a response to Dr. Vidyasankar,
VS<< In the kuRaL, kaRka kacaTaRa kaRpavai kaRRapin niRka ataRkut
taka, my Tamil teacher distinctly enunciated D (for T), d (for t) and
g (for k).  And his pronunciation of the word "english" was something
like "inkilis"  - where k was substituted for g - suggesting that
his English pronunciation was affected by his native Tamil, ..>>

Note that "taka" in the TirukkuRaL beginning with kaRka ... is
spoken as "taha". The word "English" is rendered into
tamil as "iGkilis". Because of the nasal G in "iGkilis",
the "ki" following "G" is spoken as "gi".
