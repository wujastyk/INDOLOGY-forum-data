In the RV the word *ziva'* occurs about fifty times, primarily as an
adjective, occasionally as a substantive. As an adjective it is applied to
many gods: not only to Rudra, but also to Agni, Indra, Mitra, VAyu and
PUSan. It appears in the dual modifying DyAvApRthivI. In the feminine
plural it modifies unnamed goddesses of the rivers.

Not just gods but friends in general are said to be *ziva*, as are helpers,
guests, messengers and protectors also.

There is no instance of *ziva'* as a proper name 'Shiva'.
