Having an untransparant etymology is not the same as having a non-Indo-Aryan
etymology. And 'hundreds' is really a gross exageration.

This indeed seems the case. Such an ancient layer seems to me to be absent even in most of
the subcontinent North of the Tungabhhadra and Krishna rivers. I cannot however explain
this situation.

Ku'bhA- probably belongs together with Avestan kaofa-, Old Persian kaufa- 'mountain
ridge'; 'hunch', IA *kubba- (CDIAL 3301) and kubhra'- to IE *keub-/*keubh-,
*kubho-s 'bent, curved'. Notice the voiced aspirated stop, which is a very typical
Indo-Aryan feature.
To me this seems an excellent Indo-Aryan etymology, but you may convince me with a
better explanation. Which 'non-Indo-Aryan language' are you thinking of in this case? Can
other names be ascribed to the same language or group of languages?
