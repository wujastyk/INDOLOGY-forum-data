Subject: Help with a samskr*t sloka on Shiva

=====
This is in response to the enquiry given below about two shlokas on Shiva:
The first one:
    "svayam panchamukah putrau gajAnana-ShadAnanau |
     digambarah kaTham jIvEt annapUrNau na chEt grihE?"
is perhaps from ChaNakya Shataka.

The other one is most probably from "bhoja-prabhanda":
    "svayam mahEshah, shvashurO nagEshah,
          sakhA dhanEshas, tanayO gaNEshah |
   tathA api bhikShAtanam Eva shambhOh
          balIyasI kEvalam IshvarEchChA ||"

-meaning , what prevails ultimately is God's will!

Sincerely,
-Harihareswara

Dear zubhASita specialists,

  can anybody gimme the samsr*t original of the zloka that goes as:

  "[despite] his father-in-law being the kind og the himalayas and the
god of wealth( kubera) being his servant, the lord of the world lives in a
crematorium on alms collected in his bowl".

( This is in praise of ziva)..

If of any help( and if my memory serves me correctly), this zloka connects
to another zloka which goes as:

  svayameva paJcavaktra: putrau gajAnana-shaDAnanau
   digambara: kathaM jivet annapUrNA na chedgr*he..

Regards,
kr*SNa
