  Dear Professor,

  Sorry for being not able to understand your response.
  I am pretty sure Buddha's resistance to Vedic and its
  emergence in such and such a time period has a lot to do
  with the RV date.

  Suppose scholars worked  out the date of RV taking Buddha's
  date as 600 B.C., Now that the recent researches by H. Bechert
  show parinirvana to be 350 B.C.., Correspondingly, RV date has
  to be brought forward by a minimum of 200 yrs.

  I beg to differ from your view: RV and Buddha are intimately
  related when compared to (say) Big Bang, Cosmos or the Bible.

  With kind regards,
  N. Ganesan
