Dear Vidyasankar,

I greatly sympathize with your point. I would also add that a philosophy is
not dead just because it has no living school supporting it. I think a view
should be called dead only when it is no longer relevant: either it has been
proven false or it is not addressing problems that interest anyone.

Rather we could let some fresh air into their sick-room.

Yours, Ferenc
