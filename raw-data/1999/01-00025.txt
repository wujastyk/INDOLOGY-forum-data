Dear Colleagues,

I have updated the INDOLOGY web interface for those whose browsers support
frames (for others there is no change). The address is the same as ever,
namely:

  http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html

The content is substantially the same as in late December, although I have
taken the opportunity to overhaul some pages, and check some links, etc.

Amongst the small number of significant content-updates, I have added much
improved images of the Wellcome manuscript of Patanjali's Yogasutras, and
I have also added a couple of leaves from a Sanskrit MS of Bhaskara's
Lilavati. See under "Digital images...".

All the best for the new year!

Dominik
