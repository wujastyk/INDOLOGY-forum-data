Want to know the sacred tree of Srisailam MallikArjuna temple.

Is it by any chance the "white arjuna" tree?
The Tamil Lexicon gives veNmarutu = 'flowering murdah'
as the "white arjuna" tree.

Is this tree attested in Telugu folk songs, stala puraaNam
(Telugu or Sanskrit) or in inscriptions about Srisailam?

Many thanks,
N. Ganesan
