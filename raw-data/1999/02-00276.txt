Most probably because Indra is associated with water and so is Khadir
(or Khidr/Khwaja Khizr in Coomaraswamy's writings). He is a legendary
immortal character (prophet) very well known in the Islamic tradition,
particularly to sufis.

By the way, would you please also share where is it exactly that Indra
is called Khadira? Thanks.
