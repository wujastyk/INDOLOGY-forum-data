 I am very interested too!

 Alexander C. Soper, Literary evidence for early Buddhism in China,
1959 says that the two earliest Chinese translations of GaNDavyUha
sUtra DOES NOT PLACE Mt. Potalaka in ANY island.

 Chun-fang Yu's article talks of P'u t'o only from
10th century (gave the relevant sentences from Yu earlier).

 Soper and Yu are well-known authorities on Chinese Buddhism.
