Sorry to but in, but I have a more general question regarding river names, and 
this may be the time to bring it up before I forget.

As you know, there is a theory about a system of hydronyms related to Western 
Europe, supposedly going back to the period of the I-E "takeover" (about 2000 
+/- BCE). See e.g. Hans Krahe, "Indogermanisch und Alteurop?isch", reprinted in 
 "Die Urheimat der Indogermanen" published by Wissenschaftliche 
Buchgesellschaft in 1968.

 Is there anything similar to such a hydronymic system in the Indo-Iranian 
area?

Best regards,
