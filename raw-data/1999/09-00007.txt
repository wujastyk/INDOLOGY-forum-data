Kielhorn?s remark appears on pp. xxiv-xxv of the ``Preface" to
``Part II" of his edition (reading ``Hinduu antiquity" instead of
``Hindu antiquity" and ``European Sansk.rit" instead of
``European Sanskrit") which seems to have been published
separately in 1874 with a new title page: ``The
Paribhaashendu"sekhara of Naagojiibha.t.ta." Edited and
explained by F. Kielhorn. Part II. Translation and Notes.
Bombay 1874 (the ``Preface" itself is dated ``Deccan College,
March 1874").

The title page of "Part I" runs: ``The Paribhaashendu"sekhara of
Naagojiibha.t.ta." Edited and explained by F. Kielhorn. Part I.
The Sansk.rt Text and Various Readings. Bombay 1868. (=
Bombay Sanskrit Series. No. II.). The title pages of  the
separatly published fascicles of ``Part II" run:
-- ``The Paribhaashendu"sekhara of Naagojiibha.t.ta." Edited
and explained by F. Kielhorn. Part II. Translation and Notes
(Paribhaashaas I.-XXXVII.). Bombay 1871. (= Bombay
Sanskrit Series. No. VII.).
-- ``The Paribhaashendu"sekhara of Naagojiibha.t.ta." Edited
and explained by F. Kielhorn. Part II. Translation and Notes
(Paribhaashaas XXXVIII.-LXIX..). Bombay 1873. (= Bombay
Sanskrit Series. No. IX.).

The copy of the book which we have in our library is a single
volume (certainly bound together at a later date): The first page
says: ``Bombay Sanskrit Series. Nos. VII., IX., and XII.
Naagojiibha.t.ta?s Paribhaashendu"sekhara", followed by the title
page of the apparently last published piece of ``Part II" , viz., the
``Preface" mentioned above. The actual work begins in our
binding after the ``Preface" (to Part II, 1874) with ``Part I",
followed by the three fascicles  of ``Part II" (each having its
own title page mentioning the respective Paribhaa.saas after the
page giving the series number). It is obvious that the title page of
``Part II" (and the above mentioned preceding page with the
series numbers VII., IX., and XII.) is to be a substitute for all
the earlier published title pages of the fascicles belonging to
``Part II". That is why it does not mention numbers of any
paribhaa.saas, in contrast to the title pages of the fascicles.
