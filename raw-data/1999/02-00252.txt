  May be I am not clear enough.

  There is Mt. Kailas in 'Saivaite mythology and mysticism;
  This mythical Mt. Kailas, abode of 'Siva, is based on
  a REAL Mount Kailas in the Himalaya mountains.

  There is Mt. Potalaka in Buddhist mythology and mysticism;
  This mythical Mt. Potalaka, abode of Avalokitezvara, is based on
  a REAL Mount Potiyil/Potikai/Potiyam in the Malaya mountains.
