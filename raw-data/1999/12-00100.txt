A good theory PREDICTS. Comparative historical linguistics have predicted,
before texts were found with the predicted characteristics ,
eg. Archaic Greek (Mycenean) *kw  or IE  larungeals (h1-3), at lest one
type of which was subsequently found in Hittite pehur = Greek puur = fire.

Anybody who cannot see that this theory works better keeps quiet. We had
that sort of discussion in teh Thirties & Forties. They are on teh dustbin
of  history by now.

Or one should join one of the  'anything goes' lists. Opinions are not
required here, arguments are. The rejection of reconstruction makes most of
the following arguments obsolete.

which ones? I do not know of any -D- infix...

That's quite another matter.  an infix -n- is not an infix -D-....

It seems to look like that frequently but proof is another matter. Easily,
circular arguments...

This confuses ethnicity (or even 'race'??) with language. A cardinal sin
these days.

Note the many cahnges in Munda from monosyll, root & word structure to one
with  more complex words, from a basically prefixing & infixing to a
suffixing language etc. etc.  Note the geminata not typical for Munda but
existing in Masica's Language X" in the Gangetic basin... etc. (see ejvs,
Sept 1999).

This is still going on... from Hindi & Bengali, and from Telugu in the South.

Please show 'native' infixes. I have not seen any -D-. Native vocab. would
involve words built from reconstructed Munda (or preferably even
Austro-Asiatic) roots...

You do not need any 'pushing' Aryans, there are many other models of
language transfer.
And were do you get your 'initial retroflexion'? On what basis? This is
just an empty assumption.
