Many thanks to Mani Varadarajan for the quote from Trish Mumme's book. From
that, I gather that Trish has not addressed the literal meaning of vaTakalai
and ten2kalai. I think that  to be precise  one has to explore three things

between (1) and (2). On the other hand, the link between (2)and (3) can be
weak or strong or even non-existent. (Examples are the South Indian caste
