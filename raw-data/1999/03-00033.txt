My 1968 reprint of the B.O.R.I. gives
"puNyakRtAMllokAn" as a variant (M in this case represents chandrabindu)

The variation "...puNyakRtAM lokAn" is noted as a variant and there is
another variation
"puNyatamAMllokAn"  (M in this case represents chandrabindu)
also noted. The Van Buitenen is consistent as usual with B.O.R.I., except
for the technical break between the two l's.
