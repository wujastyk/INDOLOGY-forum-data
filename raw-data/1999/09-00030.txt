Dear Dr. Wujastyk,

I appreciate your reply to Dr Gupt. However, I would like to say that the
academic Indology studies made in the West do not really depict the Indian
reality, particularly that of the religion. I live in both these worlds,
tha academic western world and the Indian academic as well as the
non-academic religious fields. The so called "Indology" is still wrapped in
deep colonial attitudes and categories, although some significant changes
in these atttitudes are taking place today. Vedas, Upanisads and the
classical sastras - however important they are in themselves- are not the
predominant traits of the present-day Hinduism. I think the modern Indology
should lay more accent on the way the texts are lived (or not-lived) today
in India and elsewhere. Greetings. A. Nayak
