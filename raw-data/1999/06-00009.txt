Hi,

I would like to remind all the serious scholars on this list that I set up
an Indo-iranian linguistics mailing list some time ago. Although it has lots
of members, it never really took off. I would once again like to invite all
the Indo-Iranian scholars (Vedic, Avestan mainly, but middle and modern
languages where relevant) to join the list for serious discussion of these
topics. To join, send a message to indo_iranian-subscribe at egroups.com, or
mail me personally and I will subscribe you.

The list is not currently moderated, but it will be if it degerates into the
same kind of boring nonsense as we see on the indology list.
