I do not think that Chakrbarti really citicizes Sri Kak et al. At least the
attempt is a total failure. Refer my earlier post on this issue.

Thanks,

Dilip Chakrabarti, whom I consider one of the finest Indian Indologists
around, critized Kak, Frawley et al.  Of course, he also criticizes
"colonial Indologists."  The name "Chakrabarti" sounds like a Sakadweepi
or other East Indian brahmin.
