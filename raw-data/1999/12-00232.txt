Subject: [q] iissara & iisvara
Message-ID: <161227054555.23782.7967173424533865052.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Have a question:
In the sanskritization of iiza/iiSa/iissara to iizara, how is the
"v" in iizvara added? Is this common and any parallel examples
could be given? (I could think of ta. vi.la > bilva, but problen here
is -v- in bilva comes after an l. bilva is from vi.lam acc. to
Zvelebil, Intro. to dr. linguistics, 1990).

Are there instances where initial i/I/e gets dropped in IA? Eg.,
Could yakkha/yakSa be from words like iyakkha/isakkha/esakka, ...?

Thanks for any examples, thoughts,
N. Ganesan
