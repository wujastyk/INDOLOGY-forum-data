Feedback
Judging from its contents (briefly, 'I have lost interest in everything
since you ignored me, my beloved!'), this verse appears to have
been picked up from some poetic work, and mere this clue is not
enough to trace a verse to its source. Anthologies of subhASitas
do not necessarily note the sources, if any, of the selected verses.
Some old anthologies mention the names of the poets/writers if
famous.
