Samar,

One reason both the Dalit and Nazis may agree on the "hard theory" is
that both often rely mostly on old sources, which is readily apparent
reading their works. Most of easily available older references firmly
espouse the AIT theory.

Also, it is noteworthy that you think that "pseudo-secularists" like
Thapar are responsible for the "soft theory."  The Hindutva school
appear to classify Thapar et al. more as AIT fanatics.
