What is this ? I think information was requested, not a harangue about some
non-existent special status for Arabic and Persian. But it might be of
interest to you to delve into the reasons as to why he did, if Pt. Nehru
ever said this about Arabic and Persian. Do I sense more garbage being
added to this thread by the proponent of multiple Sivas ?

<<<
Where does Nehru say that Persian and Arabic are part of the Indian
 cultural heritage?
>>>

 In India, Persian and Arabic are given protection as
 Classical languages.

 But not Tamil!!!. Tamil has 2300 years of continuous
 literary tradition, its love/"interior landscape"
 poems/poetics is unmatched anywhere.

 IVC language is definitely agglutinative and most
 probably a Dravidian language (cf. I. Mahadevan, A. Parpola).

 It is high time Tamil is given protection in India
 just like Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian.

 With high regards,
 N. Ganesan
