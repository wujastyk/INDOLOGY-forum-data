Subject: Position announcement : South Asia technician at Library of              Congress
Message-ID: <161227046128.23782.18074682243914338766.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is an opening for a library technician knowing one or more South
Asian languages in the Asian Division of the Library of Congress.  I
am requested to distribute the posting  widely.  Unfortunately I am
required to distribute the entire announcement which is quite a large
file and beyond the limits of Indology postings.  If anyone will
contact me directly (not via Indology) I will send the summary
announcement as a message and the entire announcement as an attachment
to them directly.
