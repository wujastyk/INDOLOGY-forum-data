        one thing not to be missed in this discussions is  all the three Acharyas maintained
that the source and inspiration for their respective propositions viz. A,V.A,or D is
upanishads and gita though the propositions are mutally contradictory.

          My other submission is that by the time Madhvacharya had propounded his
Dvaitam,chritianity was well established in west coast.Was he influenced by
Christianity to adopt such theistic approach contrary to the then prevailing
theme of advaitam albeit with different approaches?
