Subject: Eye worms?
Message-ID: <161227046647.23782.12886561679012712810.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Here's a question for our experts in ancient Indian medicine: in the
'paishaacika' text we have been discussing, I found the term netra-krimi =
'eye-worm'. Apparently it refers to some sort of disease. Would anyone know
a modern western term for that disease?
