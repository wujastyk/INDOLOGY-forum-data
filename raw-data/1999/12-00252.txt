SaRi is  not a Sanskrit word, although it has been derived from Sanskrit.  The
sanskrit words are Shaatee, Shatyaa or Shaatah, all meaning cloth worn on the
lower part of the body.  Uttariyam is worn on the upper part of the body and
Adho-vastra on the lower.

I wonder if you are confusing curtain or Purdah (veil) with SaRi.  The
curtain, as used in drama, is indeed of Greek origin and is called Yavanika in
Sanskrit.  Yavanas means Greek, the people.  The puradh or the veil, that
covers not just the head but the face also,  has Islamic/Judaeo-Christain
genealogy (Dance of the Seven Veils).  Protecting women from invaders from the
north west, many of whom came wielding Quran and a sword, was definitely one
motive.
