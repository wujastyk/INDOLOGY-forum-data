Dear Indologists,

I was browsing the Indology webpage. There, I saw a VERY INTERESTING
article entitled as Parvata, potiyil, and zrI-parvata:
(Some remarks by N. Ganesan).

Its URL is:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/ganesan-parvata.html

This is totally new and a fresh look at VP 2.486.

When approached for congratulation purposes, Dr. N. Ganesan
confessed me that its author is Dr. S. Palaniappan and not
him, though Ganesan said he wishes to be as precise as Dr. S.
Palaniappan.

Hearty congratulations to Dr. S. Palaniappan.

Sincerely,
Swaminathan Madhuresan
