I'm figuring, if it's John Smith doing the asking originally (as I
recall), that there must be some curiousity at stake as to any possible
serendipity with the Web Error 404 Not Found message and any South Asian
numerological significations.

I'm curious as well, as 404 continues to inscribe itself into the
develomental reincarnations of the web -- ironically, most often when a
resource reincarnates as its URI is then most likely to change!
