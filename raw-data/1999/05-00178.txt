Well... Vishnu is known as
"thiruvarangaththil palli kolbavan".    :-)  :-)

Sorry for the ridiculous joke.

PS:  Translation of joke for non-Tamil speakers:

     "thiruvarangaththil palli kolbavan" ==
     he who kills lizards in Srirangam

     "thiruvarangaththil paLLik koLbavan" ==
     he who reclines in Srirangam == Vishnu
