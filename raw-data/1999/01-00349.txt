That is the whole point. What remains of a person's thoughts / theories etc.
when the uglier things are removed? Are they meaningful / useful? Hence I
mentioned Frauwallner as an example.

This same question can be repeated innumerable times, in different settings.
E.g., Shankaracharya was a rather ugly casteist, in spite of his
advaitavaada. For that reason, there are modern authors who condemn each and
every thing he has done and written. Is this right? Shankara never recanted.
If Jung ever was a real Nazi, he did recant (at least implicitly, as I have
already mentioned).

Yes, it's embarrassing, isn't it... not even any of all that. I suppose that
I'm just a very nasty guy. :-)))))
