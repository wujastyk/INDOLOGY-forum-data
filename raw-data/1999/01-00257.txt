Jonathan,

Would this be the book?
Strenski, Ivan. Four theories of myth in twentieth-century history :
Cassirer, Eliade, Levi-Strauss, and Malinowski / Ivan Strenski.  1st ed.
Iowa City : University of Iowa Press, 1987.

This was published in 1987, that is two years before Berger's review.  Could
it be another book by Strenski?
