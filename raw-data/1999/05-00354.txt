Hi,

Please check out the following URL:

This is an abstract of a talk by Dr. Anand M. Sharan,professor of Mechanical
engineering at the Memorial University of Newfoundland.

I am naturally thrilled by this report, since it adds grist to my hypothesis
that the inscriptions were lists of bronze-age weapons; Mundas of Santal
Paragan.as and Ranchi belt, are metallurgists par excellence...

Best regards,
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
