The following recent publication (Jan. 1999) may be of interest:
Vedic Sarasvati--Evolutionary History of a Lost River of Northwestern India,
eds. B.P.Radhakrishna and S.S.Merh, Memoir 42 of the Geological Society of
India, PB 1922, Gavipuram, P.O., Bangalore 560019; the work includes papers
from a Seminar on Drainage Evolution of Northwestern India with particular
reference to the Lost River Sarasvati held in Vadodara in December 1997, MS
University of Baroda and also classical writings such as Oldham's and
Wilhelmy's contributions. The consensus: vedic sarasvati river was the river
flowing from Bandarpunch massif, Har-ki-dun valley, Himalayas to the Gulf of
Khambat through Kurukshetra, Kalibangan, Ganweriwala, Dholavira (Kotda),
Rojdi.

I found the following citation from Sediyapu Krishna Bhat, Discovery of Facts:
origin and the real meanings of Arya, Varna, Jati and Linga, Govinda Pai
Samshodana Kendra, Udupi, 108 pp., 1996: 'Dravida' comes from dru-ila or
dravila or forest dwellers (dru = tree)); 'arya' from verbal root 'r' which
means 'to split' or 'to scratch'; arara in L. means 'ploughing'; the term
'aryan' appears to have applied to people who scratched or tilled the soil.
