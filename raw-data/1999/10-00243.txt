There are several Brahmins who interacted extensively with Europeans.
The brahmin assistants of Colin Mackenzie around 1800 AD come to mind.
Both brahmin male/female brahmins with good Sanskrit heritage
have married Europeans. Eg., Rukmini Devi Arundale and in Asian studies
depts.

Skin pigmentation of Indians does not change with such a rapidity.
Many African Americans, even though they have lived for centuries
in Canada and USA, remain black in color.
