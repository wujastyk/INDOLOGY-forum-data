For Daakini connected to drum-beating and shamanism, the tamil noun
"tAkku = drum-stick" and the corr. verb, "tAkku = to attack/to attach/
to affect/to give command/to order" is relevant. After all,
the beating shamans give out commands to folks in their domain.

pl. also take a look at:
1)Takku = trick, pretence, affectation
2)takku = dodge, trick
3)tAkku = drum-stick
4)tAkku = to attack, to attach, to affect, to order
