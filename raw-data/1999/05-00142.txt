It cannot be dakSiNakala. I has to be dakSiNakalA. The Tamil words are
compounds. vaTakalai = vaTa+kalai. ten2kalai = ten2+kalai. "vaTa" means
"northern" and "ten2" means "southern". The equivalent of Ta. kalai (art,
science) is Sanskrit kalA. In these usages, the primary meaning of "kalai" is
"language" as seen in the AzvAr's usage "centamizum vaTakalaiyum tikaznta
nAvar" (periya tirumozi 7.8.4) .referring to brahmins whose tongues 'shine'
with Tamil and Sanskrit. Thus "vaTakalai" refers to Sanskrit and "ten2kalai"
refers to Tamil. By metonymy, these terms can be taken to mean Sanskrit texts
and Tamil texts. Strangely divya prabandha akarAdi,  GOML, 1961, glosses
kalai only as vastra and zAstra.

Like their zaivite counterparts, AzvArs also saw Tamil and Sanskrit as
equals. See periya tirumaTal 131 where viSNu is praised as being Tamil and
Sanskrit, using the words "ten2n2an2 tamizai vaTamoziyai...". In this
context, I am reminded of an earlier message in Indology.

It looks as if in the early centuries of the first millennium AD, there
indeed were parallel Tamil and Sanskrit universes and there seems to have
been friendly interaction between the two. Conflicts  over the relative
status of Sanskrit and Tamil seems to have started later.
