    Dear Prof. Schalk,

    I went thru' the Indology archives carefully.

    The Postings equating Mt. Potalaka, the abode of Avalokitezvara,
    to Potiyil/Potikai/Potiyam in Malaya mountains never talk of
    the date of arrival of Buddhism in Tamil country.

    Or, am I missing something?

    Regards,
    Swaminathan Madhuresan
