I just got one of those Hungarian devils myself.  I think what is going on
is that this guy has set up his email system poorly, and then gone away.
His account has filled up, and error messages are being sent *to the
list members* (not the list qua list).

The only way this could happen, as far as I can see, is if he has
downloaded the membership list and made his own mailing list of it.

I've deleted indology at egon.etc from the INDOLOGY list membership, but if
he has done the above, this will not solve the problem.

I am contacting the postmaster at Egon.
