Subject: Naidunia Devanagari converter and BDF font available

I have put together a Perl script to convert Naidunia font-encoded Devanagari
text to UCS2 (big-endian, with BOM).  This is the first version, so please let
me know if you find problems with it or make improvements.

  http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/nai.html

or

  ftp://crl.nmsu.edu/CLR/multiling/unicode/nai2ucs.pl

An 18pt BDF font with most of the glyphs needed for basic Unicode Devanagari
text (half-consonants and most common ligatures) is available at:

  http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/devnag.html

or

  ftp://crl.nmsu.edu/CLR/multiling/unicode/fonts/devnag18.bdf.gz

Furthermore, according to Mr Leisher:

The script should run with no problems on Windows and Mac as well,
as long as a Perl interpreter has been installed:

  http://www.perl.com/pace/pub/perldocs/latest.html

The important thing is the mapping table and the three conversion rules,
which can be easily reconstructed in another programming language.
