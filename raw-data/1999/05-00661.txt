Dear members of the list,

I agree with Juergen Neuss. Things have gotten to the point where the first
thing I do every morning is delete a great many messages posted by a
relatively small number of people - without reading them. I probably miss
some messages of genuine interest, but I don't have time to sort them out
from the polemics.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
