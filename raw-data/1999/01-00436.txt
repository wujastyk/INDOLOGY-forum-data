Subject: Wooden Structure at Patna (Pataliputra)
Message-ID: <161227045375.23782.6284585930502114216.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A wooden structure was unearthed in Patna (the ancient city of Pataliputra)
back in the 1920s.  Some identified it with a wooden palisade mentioned by
Megasthenes.  Do any of you have more information on the archaeology of this
site and the wooden structure found there?

Thank you for your help.
