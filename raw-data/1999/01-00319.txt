I think sweeping statements about the Divya Prabandham
should only be made after a thorough study of all 4000
verses.

I have not done such study; however, I know a little of
what other scholars have done, and according to them,
there are definite references to the Bhagavad Gita in
the Alvars' verses.  The following is based on my
own recollection.

To begin with, Tirumangai Alvar's set of 10 verses on
Parthasarathy svAmi in at the Tiruvallikkeni temple
speak repeatedly of Krishna as the charioteer, and the
meaning of those verses are said to echo the teachings
of the Gita.

But more directly, see Periya Tirumoli 9.9.8, where
Tirumangai Alvar speaks of Krishna's gracious words
to Arjuna in front of the chariot.

Tirumalisai Alvar's nAnmukan tiruvantAti (v. 71) refers
to "mAyan ... anRu Otiya vAkku" (the words said by Krishna
then) and this is understood to be a reference to the
Gita as well.
