In that case we have to say that potala and potalaka are different
and nAgArjunakoNDA is potala. What candragOmi visited is potala not
potalaka. Some buddhists who have migrated south might have named
their dwelling as potalaka in remembrance of the place they come
from. This is avery very common practice. Any way the identification
potika or potiyil with potala/potalaka is arbitrary.

According to rAmAyaNa agastya had an ASram much to the north of
tamil nadu whic rAma visited in araNyakANDa.  It is well documented in
rAmAyaNa. The ashram of Agastya on Malaya in kiSkindhAkANda
is itself doubtful.

Not necessary. Taranatha uses names of places which were current
in 13th and 14th centuries. If the place has the name potala in
this period it is sufficient. As far as we know therte is no evidence that
it has been called any thing else.
