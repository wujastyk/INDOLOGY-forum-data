A rather late reply, but here it is anyway.

The generally prescribed vehicle of Sarasvati is the swan, not the
peacock. The Goddess seated on a peacock should be identified as
kaumArI, one of the mAtRkas. It may be significant that the coin was
minted by kumAragupta. But then, how tight is the identification of
the bird in the coin as a peacock? In the image, it seems to be a
long-necked bird, but are there other identifying marks to call it a
peacock?

ps. Sometimes, kaumArI is also depicted as holding a Veena in her
hands, thereby coming to be identified, perhaps mistakenly, with
Sarasvati. Another Goddess who holds a Veena, but is not usually
identified with Sarasvati, is mAtangI. There is one famous verse
describing mAtanga-kanyA as 'mANikya-vINAm upalAlayantI'.
