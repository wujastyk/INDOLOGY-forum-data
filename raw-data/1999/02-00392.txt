Is La.NkAvatAra mentioned in any old Tamil literature? From the
non-buddhist Sanskrit literature I only have seen quotes from
La.NkAvatAra in sarvadar/SanasaNgraha of mAdhavAcArya written
in fourteen cent. (in the chapter on Bauddhadar/Sana). Does
anybody know any other ancient non-Buddhist literature that
quotes Ma~Nju/SrImUlakalpa or La.NkAvatAra?

Sincerely
