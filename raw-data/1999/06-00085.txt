Macdonell at elementary stage. Monier-Williams from intermediate
stage onwards. I have occasionally used Boehtlingk and Roth, and
V.S.Apte.

>9. Which dictionary do you prefer ? Please state the reasons for the
> preference.

Monier-Williams, because I am used to it and I have my own copy, and
because the information is fairly full, including brief indication of
the type of literature, sometimes the author, and sometimes even the
text place, in which a usage occurs. But the information is not
always easy to find, and is usually not so full as in Boehtlingk and
Roth. Macdonell, which I also have, is useful if I want to find how a
word is used in the more limited range of literature which it covers,
or if I want to know what compound verbs are formed from a particular
root (e.g. gacchati, Agacchati, upagacchati etc.)

With best wishes,

Yours sincerely,

Dermot
