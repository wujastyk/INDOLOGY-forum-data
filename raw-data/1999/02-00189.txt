  20,000 people exchange e-mails. From 1996. The TSCII font
  developed by them is a major advance. Bi-lingual messages containing
  Tamil in Tamil script and English are a pleasure to read.
  Can someone tell us about the Tamilnet99 in Chennai
  cybercast all across the world? Any URLs please? Did the paper,
  "The Hindu" write about the cyberconf.?
