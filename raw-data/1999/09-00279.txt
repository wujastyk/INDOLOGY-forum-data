Dear Brian:

My idea was not to set up a different list from Indology but to come up with
a way to have detailed technical discussions on the above topics without
clogging up Indology's bandwidth and still letting the list members know
that a particular topic was being discussed.  Thus I thought that a method
would be to (if enough members are interested) to set up an auxilary chat
room almost like an on-line help line.  So if I'm having say some strange
problem with my sanskrit text being garbled by software xyz or font abc
isn't working etc. I post a short simple message on Indology like "Having
problem with software please see details on Indology-computer-problem chat
room" and then anybody interested could respond or monitor and if there was
general interest a summary of solution could be posted to Indology.

Yours,

Harry Spier
