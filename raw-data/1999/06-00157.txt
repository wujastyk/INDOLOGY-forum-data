Thanks for the clarification...  I haven't seen such attempts,   but these must indeed
be miniscule,  and can be dismissed as very late and violent reactions,  indeed,  to
the contention that Sanskrit is the root of all Indian languages.

These days in general,   whatever category of South Indians (more specifically,
Tamils)  you consider,   ranging from the obnoxiously Sanskritic to the irritatingly
Dravidian,   we are content keeping the linguistic families separate.
