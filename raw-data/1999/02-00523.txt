Mr. Keith,
                I wish that you had carefully considered the situation before you sent
this posting. There is no question that the range of hills is called
Sriparvata irrespective of whether Sriparvata is the translation of
nallamala or not. No body can or does question it, because that is the name
by which it
is known in our literature and inscriptions. Therefore there is no question
of my naming it as Sriparvata by fraudulently traslating it. Chinese seem
to have translated it taking the meaning of bright and radiant for Sri and
calling it
radiant mountain.

                In addition to this though as you said nalla has one meaning
as black in telugu, in our ancient telugu literature nalla=good is also there.
After all our language and tamil are derived from the same source.

I think you owe me an apology.

regards,

sarma.
