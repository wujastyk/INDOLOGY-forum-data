Dear Mr Huet,
I visited your indology page and admired it. The openning page is gorgeous.
The dictionary seems to be very interesting and useful, handier than
Renou-Tschoupak. I am sure the new sanskrit scholars will make good use of
it. However, I must tell you that I did not succeed to open it on my
Macintosh. It opened on a  PC  but the impression was very faint, so   the
reading  was laborious. I guess it is a question of the  computer know-how
of which my level is very low. Thanks for making this work available on the
web. Greetings. A. Nayak
