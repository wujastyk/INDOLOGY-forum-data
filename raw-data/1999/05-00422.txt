 Genetics has recently proven that the caste system of India is racial in
origin, with different castes representing different races :

- M. Bamshad et al, "mtDNA Variation in Caste Populations"
  Human Biology vol. 68 (1996) p.1

- ` p53 polymorphisms and haplotypes show distinct differences between
  major ethnic groups', A. Sjalander et al,
  Human Heredity (GE9) ( 1996 Jan-Feb ) 46 (1): 41-8.

Both papers show that the Sudroids are of African (and not Caucasoid)
stock, explaining the `black' colour associated with them in Vedic texts.
IndoPedia has a good page on this -

 `The Sudroid or Indian Negro Race'

Prof. Clyde A. Winters has given linguistic evidences of Indo-African
languages at (and has deciphered the Harappan script based on African
models):

 The `yellow' colour of Vaisyas may be due to darkening of Aryan skin, or
due to Mongoloid (`Naga') admixture; other surveys show considerable
Mongoloid racial admixture, esp. in East India.

Some more entirely political links, not very scholarly, but
shows that Sudras (Dravidians, Dalits and Adivasis) are becoming more
concious of their Black Heritage. Please do not visit if offended by
political `Indology' :
