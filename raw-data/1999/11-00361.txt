Subject: Another (!) Subhashita search (the trouble with ali)

The trouble with ali as "bee" is, in what way does a
bee characterize a type of sevakAdhama?

A bee usually is seen positively because of its
pleasant buzzing sound and its associations with
flowers and honey, what to speak of the western image
of a "busy bee."

puSpAt puSpAntaraM vrajet
jJAnalobhAd tathA ziSyaH
guror gurvantaraM vrajet

It is also associated with inconstancy and fickleness
in the erotic mood.

vahatu madhupatis tanmAninInAM prasAdaM
yadusadasi viDambyaM yasya dUtas tvam IdRk (BhP
10.46.12)

And with foolishness apparently,

"The bumblebee is known to be a fool or blockhead,
and the cuckoo, one maintained by others, is a lowly
slave.
If these two are the harbingers of the sweet season,
then what further knavishness can we expect from it?"
