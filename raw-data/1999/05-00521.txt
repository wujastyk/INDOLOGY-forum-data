Subject: Pronunciation of word final "a" in sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227049440.23782.17573065952436124478.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I really meant Tamil Nadu and Kerala; You might have noticed
a tendency among Karnataka and A.P. high classes to disassociate themselves
from things Dravidian. All pervading Sanskrit impact in Karnataka
and A.P. may be the reason why word-final "a"s are dealt the same
way as the North.

Regards.
