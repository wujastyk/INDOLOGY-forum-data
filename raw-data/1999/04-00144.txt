Dear list-members,

Recently we have been receiving more and more panicky messages
concerning the deadline for submitting abstracts for the Conference of
the International Association of Buddhist Studies in Lausanne
(Aug. 23-28). We had earlier specified Apr. 15 as the deadline for
the abstracts -- this seems to have had a stimulating effect.

We would like to inform you now that we will still be accepting
abstracts for a *few* weeks.

Best,

Toru Tomabechi, Secretary
The XIIth IABS Conference
University of Lausanne
