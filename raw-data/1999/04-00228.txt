The "epigraphist" S. Paranavitana is totally untrustworthy. The least you can say is that he had a
lot of fantasy, but he might be better called a scientific fraud.
He also "discovered" a long inscription in Sanskrit made by a Byzantine merchant, who gives a
learned exposition of the Greek and Roman culture and even - very anachronistically - propounds
the theory of the relatednes of the Indo-European languages.
The text, published in "The Greeks and the Mauryas", Colombo, 1971,  was shown to be fake by the
simple fact that the merchant uses English terms and pronunciations instead of Byzantine Greek
ones in his transcriptions of Greek words (e.g. GrIkabhASA "the Greek language" , YuropArAjya
"Europa"). See the review by Ludo Rocher in JAOS 95, 1975, p.141.
