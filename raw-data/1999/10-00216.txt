The work is basically in Japanese with a Sanskrit reconstruction of
the first two chapters -- the later ones have the kind of annotations
that you are probably have in mind so it will perhaps be of interest
to you.

Where are you based ?  If you are ever able to be in London, I could
possibly lend you my set if you cannot get it from Japan.

There is also the Golden Tenjur MS recently available from China --
useful but it does not represent an entirely different stemma.

I was not so much thinking of ms tenjurs but possible versions
surviving independently --- has anything turned up at Tabo for example
?   Perhaps it is less relevent in this case as the version you want
to use is late, but it might be worth collating quotes from early
Indo-Tibetan authors, possibly based on versions that have not been
revised (if the MAK has been revised).   For example, I have read a
lot of stuff by Long-chen-pa who quotes it extensively with variants.
There is a possibility that the MAK was translated more than once --
this certainly is the case with some texts.

The Chinese definitely stole a lot of Sanskrit mss from various
monasteries in Tibet.  You are right about the political angle -- very
cynical !   Various Japanese scholars have had access to some of this
material -- this is mentioned, among other places, in the latest IABS
report.   Some mss have been illicitly microfilmed and smuggled out of
China -- I cannot give more details for obvious reasons but this is
factual.  There is also a published Chinese catalogue of some 100+
titles which I do not have unfortunately.   Also have you looked
through Sankrityayana's list of mss he noted during his several trips
to Tibet before WW2 ?  The whereabouts or fate of these mss is unclear
but some of them turned up in India after the Chinese invasion.
Though the Chinese are returning some material to Tibet, a lot of it
is very haphazard -- the texts are being returned to approved
monasteries and not necessarily the ones from where the originally
came -- I understand that Tashilhungpo has been one such recipient.
Seems like a cosmetic political ploy to fill the monastery shelves to
bolster their lies that they protect Tibetan culture.

Yes, I agree but you know "Sod's Law" I presume.   I have spoken to a
Tibetan who actaully saw in his childhood the partial Tibetan
translation of the Maha-vibhasa together with the original Sanskrit --
who knows what became of that ?!

Anyway, though for me personally Chandrakirti is very unappealing as a
person and "thinker", I wish you well with your project.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
