Subject: A few more Bhagavad Gita obscurities.
Message-ID: <161227047011.23782.6710096945924343975.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thank you scholars and fellow lovers of Sanskrit for taking the time to
answer those questions I've asked regarding the Bhagavad Gita.  I'm
deeply touched.


A few more obscurities:

1) verse 18.72 of the Bhagavad Gita:
Belvalkar(1962 edition)and a few others read ...praNaSTas...
J.A.B. van Buitenen and a few others  read   ...pranaSTas...

Whitney in his grammar section 192 a. specifically mentions "pranaSTas"
as an exception to "n" going to "N" after "r".
Is Belvalkar in this edition a misprint? What does B.O.R.I. say? Is
there some optionality in this rule? Or some other reason for this
difference?

2)  Verse 18.43
Belvalkar (1962 edition) reads ...kSattrakarma...
J.A.B. van Buitenen reads      ...kSatrakarma...

Is this the same situation as the previous discussion on patra/pattra
and if so, is kSattra etymological or phonological?

3) verse 15.5
Belvalkar reads    ...gRcchantymUdA...
van Buitenen and all other editions at hand read ...gRcchantymUdAH...
Misprint in Belvalkar?


Again thank you in advance
