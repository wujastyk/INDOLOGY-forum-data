I think the problem has been summed up very well.

I would like it to be pondered upon:

1. Are the First Causes really first in the numerical or empirical sense ?

2. Is the Sankrit term aadi or anaadi not more appropriate as it is not first but
original or premium , as in the Aristotelian Premium Mobile, the Initial Mover ?

3. If the first cause was really the first, then which is before the first? And hence
how does one solve the problem of endless regression?

 Therefore, what is more important are attributes (upadhiis) of the first as eplained
in a given system, be it Purusha, Brahma, or Nature (Physiki in the ancient Greek or in
the modern scientific sense).

The remarkable phenomenon about Saamkhya, Yoga and Vedanta is that they have been put to
a practical unification in Saadhanaa. Some would even say that there is no difference
(taatvika) among them, as the Giitaa too stated it.
