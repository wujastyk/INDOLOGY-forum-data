What is the nature of evidence for this kind of assertions? Is it a
conjecture or are there some kind of empirical work done on these sorts of
questions? How could one investigate whether Manu's rules are followed in a
milieu where people haven't heard of such texts? There may be some way of
showing that Smriti texts are followed in a milieu where they are not known.
But I am curious about the method.
