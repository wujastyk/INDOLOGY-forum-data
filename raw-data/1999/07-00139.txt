Dear Colleagues

In 1887 two texts of veterinary medicine, the Azvavaidyaka and the
Azvacikitsita, were published in the Bibliotheca Indica series, Calcutta.
Is there anyone who has easy access to these volumes and could check,
whether there is a chapter dealing with the treatment of the burns of
horses, and send a copy of that chapter to me, if it is found (in cannot be
long). Although the series is common and well known, these volumes seem to
be rare. We do not have them here and during my recent visit to Leiden I
was searching for them without success at the usually very good library of
the Kern Institute. Thanks in advance.

Klaus
