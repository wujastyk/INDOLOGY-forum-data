Nothing on blood "circulation".  See my book "The Roots of Ayurveda" pp.36
ff. for more on the ducts and tubes in the body, and what they carry.

which contains important articles by Staal, Larson, and Koller on the
Indian body.

Dasgupta (1969), vol. 2, ch. 13, is good on several topics to do with the
body:  tubes (veins, arteries, nerves) in the body, growth, embryology
(see esp.  pp. 288#93, 302# 19)
