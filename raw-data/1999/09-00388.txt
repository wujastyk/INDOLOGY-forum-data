Subject: defilements of the holy sounds - of the Vedas
Message-ID: <161227052542.23782.6503448463821212329.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,
I've been reading Cantwell Smith's <What is Scripture?> the chapter called "the Hindu Instance"
in it he suggests that "What the West calls "the" Veda [I think he refers to the rg veda] was emphatically not written down." He further suggests quoting C. Mackenzie Brown "The written images of an alphabet, far from giving visual access to the sacred words of the Veda, were regarded as defilements of the holy sounds" 
can anyone confirm or contradict these assertions?
Thanks in advance
Benjamin Fleming
