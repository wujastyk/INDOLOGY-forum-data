Subject: Is vENu from Ta. vEL?
Message-ID: <161227048135.23782.4461459006378855325.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

>  There is an early Tamil Brahmi inscription mentioning a
>  chief vEL, as vEN kOsipan. BeLagAm, cognate with vEL gRama,
>  is mentioned in several copper plates as vENugrAma.
>  Rigveda 133.3 refers to a vailasthAna and scholars
>  have written that it refers to the place of vEL-s.
>
>  Traditional explanation of the name vENu occuring in Sanskrit
>  is 'cane, reed' etc., For example, "Heinrich Lueders
> (Philologica Indica, p. 555), who compares the old king's name Nala
> (according to him originally "cane" [still Na.da in "SB. 2,3,2,1.2];
> cf. naa.dii, naala, nalina, etc.) with names like Ve.nu etc."
>
>  Even though names like nala, naalaayanii, nalagiri(nalAgiri, nAlAgiri),
>  nArAyana (<nAlAyana) are very likely to be related to Dravidian
>  naL (black), the traditional explanation had been to link with
>  'reed'. In similar vein, vENu is usually explained with 'cane,reed'.
>
>  Given the tendency in Sanskrit to change Ta. vEL to vENu,
> does the name vENu signify the title of Chiefs related to/cognate with

>(II. 41, 42), is BeLgaum itself; in other inscriptions its name occurs as
