Dear Sirs,

Academy of Sanskrit Research is a premier institution located in Karnataka,
India. The activities of the Academy largely fall in the orbit of Vedanta,
especially Visistadvaita propagated by Acharya Ramanuja.   We have published
more than 35 valuable titles on Upanishads, Ramanuja's works etc. These
books are referred to by the eminent
scholars for a detailed study of Vashnavism/ Visistadvaita philosophy,
comparative study and so on.  Many scholars have appreciated the value of
these books.  Particularly, one would be amazed to see the sea of
information provided in the critical edition of Sribhasyam (magnum opus of
Acharya Ramanuja) in four volumes. They will no doubt be a good collection
to your valuable library.

It may be interesting to you to know that the Academy which has a campus of
more than 20 acres situated on the peak of Melkote, a hill town in
Karnataka, has a well established library of more than 23,000 printed books,
1000 audio cassettes, 11000 plam leaf and paper manuscripts.  The garden of
fruits and flowers has created a Tapovana like atmonsphere congenial for
indepth study and research.

You can reach Melkote from Mysore, Bangalore and Mandya easily.
