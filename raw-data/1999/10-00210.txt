I have already said on this list in the begining that I am an electrical
engineer by profession. I repeat today that I am not an indologist but as an
Indian I find myself deeply interested in Indian stuff.

I asked this question just to substantiate the following statement of Albert
Einstein.

"We owe a lot to Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no
worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made."

If people on this list strongly feel that such questions are unproductive
for this list, I will, without any second thought, immediately leave this
list.
