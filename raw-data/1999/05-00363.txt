   This "neglect of a rigorous study of Sanskrit literature"
cannot be said for Prof. Thompson; my friends tell that
GT got his Doctorate from UC, Berkeley on Vedic Sanskrit.
Among GT's many publications on vedas, I particularlt enjoyed
a) On Truth acts in Vedic, IIJ, 1998
b) Ahamkara and atmastuti, HR, 1997
c) The brahmodaya and vedic discourse, JAOS, 1997
