                         Deepa Mehta's 'Fire' cleared without cuts

                         Director Deepa Mehta's film "Fire," which was
referred back to the
                         Censor Board for a review, has been cleared by the
board without any
                         cuts, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister
Pramod Mahajan said
                         in New Delhi on Saturday. The film had been sent
back to the board
                         following violent protests by the Shiv Sena
against the depiction of
                         a lesbian relationship in the film.
