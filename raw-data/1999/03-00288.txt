Again I ask for help concerning my work about a modern Gujarati drama. I am
searching for people knowing or having studied the language.
Furthermore I plan to work about the drama, concerning influences by Indian
drama tradition aswell as european influence. Is there anybody out there
having worked about a drama in any modern Indian language and being able to
give me some requests (literature etc.).
Most gratefully
K. Malkawi
