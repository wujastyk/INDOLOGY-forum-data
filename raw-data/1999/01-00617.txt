Allow me to draw your attention to the following new publication by one of
the members of our institute: 

Annemarie Mertens:
Der Dakshamythus in der episch-puranischen Literatur : Beobachtungen zur
religionsgeschichtlichen Entwicklung des Gottes Rudra-Shiva im Hinduismus.
(Beitraege zur Indologie ; 29) Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1998. xx, 444 pp.
(ISBN 3-447-04079-3), paperback DM 148,-; ?S 1080,-; SFR 131,-

Shiva?s image changed from a terrifying outsider in vedic times to a
supreme God in Hinduism. This long process of Rudra-Shiva?s rise to a
higher position can be studied in the many epic and puranic variations of
the story of Daksha?s sacrifice. The popular episode of Shiva?s exclusion
from a share of the sacrifice and his reaction to this discrimination - the
forcible interruption of the sacrifice - is reported in Shaivite as well as
Vaishnava and Shakta Puranas. The authors modified or extended the Daksha
episode revealing their different religious attitudes. The critical
analysis of the myth?s development and its different historical levels
makes a contribution to the history of Hinduism, especially of Shivaism.
