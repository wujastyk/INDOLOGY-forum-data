Subject: Kumarila Bhatta's criticism of false etymologies

The words you're looking for might be "cor" (rice), "atar"
(road),"pAp" (snake), "mAl" (woman) and "vair" (stomach).

This is quoted by K. V. Zvelebil in his 'Dravidian Linguistics' (p.
 xxii fn)  with the notes that cor is DEDR 2897, atar is DEDR 3170.
"PAp obviously represents DEDR 4085 pAmpu (which according to Burnell,
South Indian Palaeography, p. 126) is given in some of the best
manuscripts of T. as pAmb. KumArila's mAl is to be connected either
with DEDR 183  (Tamil ammAL) or DEDR 3616 (MalayALam mOL)."

Note 1:
-------

 'pAppu' as snake figures many times in Tamil literature.
We don't have to go to A. C. Burnell for this.
Some examples:

akanAn2URu:
-----------
aka348x06 neTu kaN ATu amai pazuni kaTu tiRal
aka348x07 pAppu kaTuppu an2n2a tOppi

pazamozi:
---------
pAppuk koTiyARkup pAlmEn2iyAn2 pOlat
tAkki amaruL talaippeyyAr pOkki
vaziyarAy naTTArkku mA tavam ceyvArE
kazi vizAt tOL ERRuvAr

tEvAram:
--------
nITu iLam pozil aNi nelveNey mEviya
ATu iLam pAppu acaittIrE
ATu iLam pAppu acaittIr umai an2poTu
pATu uLam uTaiyavar paNpE

'paappu' occurs commonly in Tamil names denoting
'Siva such as 'pAppaiyan2', 'pAppaNan2'
usually translated as nAgabhUSaNa or sarpAlaMkAra.

In mOrUr, Salm district, the enshrined 'Siva
is named pAppaNiyAr or pAppazakar or pAmbalangArar.

A Morur Kangeyan named 'poppaNa kAGkEyan' was the
patron of aDiyArkku nallAr who wrote the
important commentary on CilappatikAram.
Without this commentary, we cannot understand
old Tamil music or CilappatikAram today.
(poppaNa kAGkEyan2 aLitta cORRuc cerukku allavO
tamiz mUn2Rukku urai ceyvittatE! - aDiyArkku nallAr
in his foreword (pAyiram)).

I believe 'poppu' as snake (pAppu) occurs in some
Dravidian languages. What about Kannada or Badaga
or Toda or Kota? Is poppu = snake mentioned in
DED or DEDR? Thanks for clues.

makaL > mAL > Ma. mOL
In the same way,
pAppu > poppu.

-----------------------------------------

Note 2:
-------

Like tukaL > tUL, makaL becomes mAL in Tamil.
Malayalam uses mOL. See vENmAL (daughter of vEL
in sangam texts).

 makaL > mAL > Ma. mOL
