One can get good idea what the major English translations of the GItA look
like from the review by Gerald James Larson "The song celestial: Two centuries
of the Bhagavad GItA in English" (Philosophy East and West, vol. 31, no. 4,
October 1981, pp.513-541).
It contains parallel translations of some passages by different authors, their
stylistic, pedagogical, interpretive  and motivational characteristics being
analysed and evaluated.
There is no mention of Barbara Miller's translation. Did it appear later than
1981? I would be very grateful to Burt Thorp if he gives more exact reference
to this particular translation of the GItA.
        Thanks in advance,
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
