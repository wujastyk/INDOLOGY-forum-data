Dear Indology Members,
our discussion group has once again manifested its worth as a scholarly
body committed to fostering knowledge and assisting each other.
The article I solicited on behalf of Prof. J. Kolmas is already on its way
to Praha and it only remains to me to express my and Dr. Kolmas' gratitude
for your prompt help.
Gratefully Yours J.F.
