       Dear Sirs,

 I am working to an essay about the way in which India and Britain have
influenced each other in matters of culture and civilisation.This may
include literature, architecture and arts, movies ,law ,
medicine , administration , religion and philosophy, outlooks ,privat
and every day life ,political
ideology , education, transport-railway, economy , high -society ,
elite's cultural models-the Indian elite used to study in Britain etc. I

am also interested in some general facts about multiculturatity and
the influences between the former parts of British Empire. If you know
some Internet useful
resources please e-mail me to  buciuman at yahoo.com .

Thank you,

Adrian Buciuman
