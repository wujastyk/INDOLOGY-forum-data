And ONam for tirumAl (viSNu).
One of the pattuppAttu (such as maturaikkAJci) mentions
something like "the one born on ONam star".

tiruvAtirai star is associated with Sivan but I suppose
not as his birth star since he is called
"piRavA yakkaip periyOn2" or "the greate one who has
the body that was never given birth to"
[cilappatikAram chapter 5-intiravizavur eTuttakAtai?].
