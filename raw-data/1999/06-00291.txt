Dear Vishal Agarwal,

thank you for an interesting posting. However, I should perhaps warn you that my
paper does not deal specifically with Dayananda and his teachings. He is just
mentioned in passing because I try to establish a skeleton chronology for the
acceptance of Indigenous Aryanism as exemplified by some leading figures of the
nationalist movement. Here, Indology has provided me with better information
than my printed sources, and has saved my a lot of work (otherwise, I would have
had to spend a disproportionate amount of time pursuing a problem which is
marginal to my paper). My paper in its present avatara (draft) deals more with
the rhetoric of indigenism than with its substance.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
