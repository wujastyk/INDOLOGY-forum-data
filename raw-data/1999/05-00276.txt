>?From the root verb, "nAvu", many Dravidian words are
formed; i) "nA/nAvu/nAkku" = tongue
ii) "nAvAy" = ship, vessel, possibly because the ship rips
apart the surface waters while in motion.
iii) "nAvikan2" = mariner

Navy and Navigation are ultimately related to
Ta. words like 'nAvu, nAvikan, nAvAy" etc.

Appreciations for telling more on
the Sanskrit words for Navy and Navigation.

Sincerely,
V. Iyer
