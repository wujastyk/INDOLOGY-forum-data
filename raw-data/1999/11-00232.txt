Subject: Background of the Sikh name `Singh'?
Message-ID: <161227053694.23782.15110556939269809073.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hello all.

A friend of mine has to write an article for the Danish National
Encyclopaedia (Gyldendal) about the Indian (Sikh?) name `Singh'.
While the Sanskrit etymology and the fact that the name is widespread
among Sikhs is obvious, any additional information (and/or references)
would be highly appreciated (one question that comes to mind: Are all
those Singhs named after some important person in the history of
Sikhism?).

Many thanks in advance,
Stefan
