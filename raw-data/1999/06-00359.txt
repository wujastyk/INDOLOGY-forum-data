*Thank you, seems interesting; but how can I read them here, in *Hungary?

Does (East) European universities have a Inter-Libarary Loan
exchange facilities with those in USA? That's one route.

Easy way: Order Marlow's PhD diss. photocopy through UMI
(University Microfilms Inc.?) in Michigan. They can be reached
thru' the web. If you read Marlow, may be you can add
more data.

I have a friend, Dr. N. Gopalasamy who teaches astronomy
at Johns Hopkins. He is a fine tamil poet; On his visits
to Finland to attend Seminars, he found there are many words
like tamil.
