I am puzzled over a reference I've encountered in the Ramayana'a
YuddhakA.n.da (6.37.2, in the critical ed.) to "gandhamAdana."
The only 'literary character' given in Apte's dictionary for this
compound is RAva.na, yet this would not seem to fit the context,
given that the list in this (and the following) verse
evidently refers to the vAnaras who surround RAma to protect his
fallen body. Can anyone shed some light on this reference? Am I
overlooking something obvious?

Let me quote a famous Tevaram song by St. Appar (7th century CE).
This lists mountains all over India and calls them "Siva's abodes.
In this, gandhamAdana mount tops the list.

It is important to note that Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh is
called as North Parvata (Paruppatam) here. May be in order to
distinguish it with the Malaya mountains which has been called
"Paruppatam" (=Parvata) in other ancient Tamil texts. Malaya being
called as "Paruppatam" (=Parvata) in Tamil texts by authors
well versed in Sanskrit has important ramifications for
identifying the Parvata mountain referred to in Vakyapadiya 2.486.
