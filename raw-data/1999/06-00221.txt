The Austric presence really extends beyond Eastern India. As we are
limited to only one screen of text here it would be impossible to make
my case on this forum.  Last time I got started, I mysteriously found
myself suddenly unable to post to the list.  Eventually had to
resubscribe. However, I've written on this subject elsewhere. Check
