I was referring specifically to Tantrism rather than Siva.  I have
to stop by the library for references, but a few sources on
Mahacina are:

Brihadnila Tantra
Yoni Tantra

I think the evidence suggests Siva is a composite god based on numerous
traditions.  There is not one single tradition, IVC or otherwise, that
accounts for all the manifestations of Siva.
