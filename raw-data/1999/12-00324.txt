Indeed. I doubt that it exists. If it does exist, it has never been made
available for critical examination. Of course, even if something like this
does exist, its genuineness will have to be proved. The published Devanagari
script text of the claimed plate is in classical Sanskrit, not Prakrit/Pali.
