How about Sabarimalai?  It fits the
description "GuangMing Shan" (shining mountain),
because one of its most famous features
is the "makara jyothi" (a divine light
or radiance which, devotees say,
can be seen from a nearby mountain).

Raja.

PS:  I have no opinion regarding Potalaka's
     location.  I'm just mentioning another
     candidate.
