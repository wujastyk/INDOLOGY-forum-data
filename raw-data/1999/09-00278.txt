Kulavaduu is Not Aham and Vaarivadhuu is Not Puram---the equivalents of 4
Purushaarthas-Dharmam-Artham-Kaamam-Moksham(in Sanskrit)-are-
Aram-Porul-Inbham-Veedu(in Tamil)---Inbham(Kaamam)is Aham(canbe shared
exclusive between the two only)--Artham/Moksham are Puram(can be shared with
outside world ) .Aram(Dharmam) is common to both Aham and Puram.The syllable
Kaamam does not have the same connotation in Tamil as it has in
Sanskrit.Thiruvalluvar has divided his 1330 verses of Thirukural into 3 parts
only to discuss Aram(Dharmam)-Porul(Artham) and Inbham(Kaaamam).He does not
discuss about Veedu(Moksham)-this has been discussed very elaborately in many
Research Works.He just devotes 10 verses for Initial Prayer.Tamil language
can very independently stand without any support what so ever from Sanskrit
language-it is so rich in vocabulary.
