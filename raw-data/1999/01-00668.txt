Once again, I'm very impressed with the precision and depth of your
knowledge!  Surely the Hiranyagarbha ceremony must go way back in
time...very interesting stuff [gold is.  :^)].

Please do...plus any to any textual references to fire walking, at the
Draupadi temples or otherwise....do you agree that their might be a
connection the the agni-pariksha idea?  Showing one's sanctity in this way?
Maybe not, of course, but it's a scholarly hunch I'd like to corroborate
or nulllify via textual sources...

Good to hear from you personally again,

Warm Regards to you too,
Michael
