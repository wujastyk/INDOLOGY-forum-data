NAGARJUNAKONDA/POTALAKA-2

The identification of potalaka with "etti pOtala" is more apt for the
following reasons.

1.As can be seen from the name of the Dalailama's palace which is
  potala palace, the basic word is potala and not potalaka.

2.Taranatha consistently uses "potala" and "potala hill" only in his
  History of Buddhism

3.ChandragOmi after visiting dhAnykaTaka will try to find a location
 which preferably buddhist and closer to it and not a place thousands
 of kilometers away, for his last resting place.

sarma.
