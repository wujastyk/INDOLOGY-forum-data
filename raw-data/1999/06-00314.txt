-tra means "to release" as in the word "mantra" being something
that "sets free the mind (mana)."  Also this is found in the word
ksatriya.  Does the word "astra" (weapon) coming from "throw,
release" refer to the releasing of a mantra?

Not by profession but she has for the last 10 years studied different
Sanskrit literatures and from this gained quite some knowledge of
Sanskrit as a language.
