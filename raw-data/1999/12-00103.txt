I just finished reading a fascinating, extremely referenced, booklet from the
Adyar Library; this may have some nexus in the context of the recent queries
regarding the date of the Rigveda since Pargiter's geneaology tables, with
quotes from the Maha Bharata and the Pura_n.as, do take off from RV textual
references.
