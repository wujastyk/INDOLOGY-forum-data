>DharmasthaLa  (formerly  KuDuma)

What does kuDuma refer to? Is Dharmasthala on top of
a hill?

>Two huge  BAhubali  statues  like  the  one  in  ShravaNabeLagoLa
>are  to be  found  in  VeNUr  and  KArkaLa.

Was vENUR ever called vELUR?

Please refer me to books on place/river name studies in
Karnataka. In A.P. as well.

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
