I don't remember all the details and conclusions,  but he goes into various
issues such as the lack of "s'Anta" among the early listing of rasas (like in the

"s'rngAra hAsya karuNA..." s'loka from the Natya Shastra),  later interpolation
of s'Anta into this s'loka,  and disputations about what would be an appropriate
sthAyi bhAva were s'Anta to be included as a rasa.
