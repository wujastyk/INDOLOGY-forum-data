I wonder if one needs to resort to "koy"...
The word "kuy" itself is employed as the root in words  which cover many
classical pursuits of craftsmanship:

pottery, cutting, perforation (of stones, beads, or to make wind
instruments), making/playing musical instruments, jewelry (perforation,
polishing etc), tailoring and so on.

This word has a strong parallel to the usage of "kal" (as in kalam for any
product of craftsmanship). Also worth considering the word Ta. "kai" for
"hand".

Even though CT references for most of these can be cited, for immediate
purposes I am citing the Cologne On Line Tamil Lexicon for many words:
kuyavan2  01 potter

kuyam  1. sickle, reaping-hook, curved knife; 2. razor; 3. potter caste

kuyil 04 hole, perforation

kuyavu  car, chariot

kuyin2ar  1. those who polish and perforate gems; 2. tailors

kuyin2  02 deed, work

kuyiluvam
 playing on stringed instruments, drums, tabrets, clarionets, horns


kuyiluvar

players on stringed instruments, drums, tabrets, clarionets, horns

kuyalan2
  man of great skill, dexterity

kuyiRRu-tal

01 1. to tell, say, utter; to lay down, as rules
02 1. to make, construct, form perform; 2. to enchase, set, as gems

kuyil(lu)-tal
02 1. to make, execute, shape, construct; 2. to weave;
3. to plait, braid, intwine; 4. to bore, perforate,
tunne; 5. to enchase, set as precious stones;
1. to take place; 2. to be thick, close, crowded; 3. to sound, play
