"Anyway" Dr. Elst continues, so I don't mind adding a few lines
myself.

Dear Mr. Sergei Schmalz, Dear Mr. Francis Parmar,

I don't know whether the 'debate', in Dr. Elst's personal view, includes
Rajesh Kochhar's recent book _The Vedic People: Their History and
Geography_ (Orient Longman, 1999). As far as I know, Elst has not
hacked that one yet. There was an article about it in _The Hindu_ a
short while back:

www.indiaserver.com/thehindu/1999/11/07/stories/13070671.htm

I found it quite reassuring to see that a leading Indian natural
scientist (director of the National Institute of Science, Technology
and Development Studies, New Delhi) with an interest in ancient
Indian history need not be a card-carrying Hindutvavaadin.
