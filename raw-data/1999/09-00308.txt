If Tamil has its roots in Sanskrit, then all Tamil(T) words should have some 
resemblance to the Sanskrit(S) words from which they are supposed to have 
originated, even in corrupted form. For instance dhAham(T)- 
-dhAha(S)----Mekam(T)---Mega(Sandesam-Kaalidaasa? play)(S)----This is 
Brahminical Tamil. If  a Tamil word is not related to a Sanskrit word-both (T 
& S )having the same meaning- - to any stretch of imagination---even to the 
root{dhAtu(p)} of the Sanskrit word, then it should be agreed (without any 
murmur) that Tamil Genius has developed its own vocabulary without any 
support or influence of Sanskrit. Some examples are Kani(T) = 
Phalam(S)----Aani (T)=Jyesta(S)-(a month?s name)----Murugu(T) 
=Sundaram(S)----Aal(T)=Vata Vrksham(S)---- Arisi(T)=Thandulam----(Arisi has 
atleast  some commonality with Rice)----Nel(T)=Vree(S)----Paasi payaru(T) = 
Mudga(S)-----Moonru(T) =Treeni(S)---Treeni has commonality with English 
Three----Aezhu(T) =Sapta(S)--- has commonality with Septa--- These are all 
very common-day to day words?If they have any commonalities- even remotely-
