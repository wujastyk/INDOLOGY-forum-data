Oh, yes indeed, and don't I know it! :-) My work with the writings of Hindutva
scholars has shown me that many of the sins they commit - and which stand out
glaringly because they commit them in contexts where Westerners don't - many
of these sins are committed just as well by Western scholars. E.g. everybody
argues ex nihilo when it suits their purposes.
