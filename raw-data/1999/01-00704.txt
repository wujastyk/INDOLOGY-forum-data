Dear Mani Varadarajan,
Here's the promised quote:

maturaik kAJci (one of the 10 "long poems" of Sangam era)
by poet mAGkuti marutan2 as advise to
the Pandiyan emperor pANTiyan2 neTuJceziyan2.
stanzas: 590-591:
"
kaNam koL avuNar kaTanta polam koL
mAyOn2 mEya ONam nal nAL"
[maturaik kAJci: 590-591]

naccinArkkiniyar commentary:
says: "mEya = piRanta = born"
To quote the fuller context from his commentary:

"tiratciyaik koNTa avuNarai venRa
pon2n2Arc ceyta mAlaiyin2ai uTaiya
mAmaiyai uTaiyOn2 piRanta ONamAkiya nan2n2AL"
translation:
"mAyOn2 mEya ONam nal nAL"
mAyOn2 = tirumAl (viSNu)
mEya = born
nal = good (auspicio
Source:
page 406 of "pattup pATTu: mUlamum naccin2Arkkin2iyar uraiyum"
by UVS  Iyer
published by Tamil University, Tanjore, 1961
(mine is 1986 a photo-offset print of the 1961 press print).

I am also surprised to see n. in2iyar's interepretation of
the "mEya"  in this fashion. It is  a big news to me.

But the cilappatikAram stanzas that I quoted earlier
about Siva being
"piRavA yAkkaip periyOn2"
[cilappatikAram 5:169]
"the one with the body that was not given birth to"
seems to give some hint that the others were given
birth to.
Maybe somebody can help here.



Regards
Chandra
