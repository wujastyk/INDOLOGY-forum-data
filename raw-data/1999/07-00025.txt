Hello,

This topic may have run the circuit already, but I can't find it in the
Indology archives so here goes.  I'm reviewing web sites about Hinduism for
the Britannica Internet Guide online (http://www.britannica.com/).  If you
have time, please let me know of sites you think are noteworthy and ought
to be reviewed or sites you use for educational purposes.   Also, if you
know of link-sites (university sites, private sites, student group sites,
etc) that are particularly good, that would be helpful.

Thanks in advance.
