Subject: Peacocks and Poison--one last time
Message-ID: <161227047398.23782.9349478215631879194.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is an extended passage in the Raajadharmaparvan of the MBh
(12.120.4-16) which recommends various attributes and habits of the peacock
as indications of the way a good king should act as he performs his duty of
protecting his subjects.  It starts like this,

"Just as a peacock's tail has feathers of many colors, so should a king who
knows the Law display many different forms--sharpness, deviousness,
indomitability, truthfulness, and rectitude." [4]

And zlokas like this are typical of the whole passage,

"His words bland, his body smooth, a king endowed with Royal Splendor who is
well versed in the Learned Traditions should always keep his plans secret,
the way a peacock is mute in the autumn." [7]

There are references to the peackock's attacking snakes and eating insects,
and 11c might well refer to its eating flowers, but none to its eating
poison.
