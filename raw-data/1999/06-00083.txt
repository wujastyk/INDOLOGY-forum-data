Dear Srinivas,

I am also thinking on the Secularization of South Asian
region. Glad that you mention Turkey - One of the
first things they did was to Romanize their script.

It will be a good start: Both Pakistan and India
should adapt to the Roman script; Hindi and Urdu,
esentially being the same languages, the script choices
reflect a religious base. If South Asia employs
the Roman script as a whole- the Indic transliteration scheme
as given in the Indology can form the basis -
it will secularize many aspects of life
in South Asia. Take the country, Turkey for example.

Regards.
