Well, this is the second time that I've corrected you. I never said
 that Sanskrit was "borrowed into India."  In fact, I believe Sanskrit
developed in India.

Dear Mr. Manansala,

Am I correct in understanding your position that
Sanskrit developed in India and spread Westward to
Iran and beyond?

You are saying that "Sanskrit was never borrowed into India".
How do we explain the similarities between Old Iranian
and Sanskrit with your position that Sanskrit is native
to India and it never entered into India. Then, it must
have gone out from there to Iran??

Regards
N. Ganesan
