I have to agree. Just because there is "Arya" influence doesn't mean
there is no original literature or identity.

That would be like saying there is no 'original' Indian identity because
modern Indian culture has Muslim and Western influences, or no original
English literature because of Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian influence.
