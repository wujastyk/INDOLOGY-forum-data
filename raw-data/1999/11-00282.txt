For those who may be interested in a cogent self-examination of Krishna-
murti's thought:

Krishnamurti, in dialogue with Professor Allan W. Anderson.  _A Wholly
        Different Way of Living_.  London, Victor Gonllancz, Ltd., 1991.

The book is a transcript of some 28 conversations between Dr. Anderson
(Professor of Religious Studies at San Diego State University) and J. Krish-
namurti, videotaped at SDSU from February, 18 to 28, 1974.  ISBN 0-575-
05166-3.
