Subject: Original  Sanskrit  names
Message-ID: <161227049502.23782.10886088969489047854.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Would  any  knowledgable  Indologist  post  the  original  Sanskrit
names  for  at  least  the  major  cities  in  the  northern  part  of
the  sub-continent  whose  names  have  become  corrupted  over  time.
Let  me  give  you  a  few  examples.

1.  Peshawar    =  PuruShapura
2.  Multan      =  MUlasthAna
3.  Lucknow     =  LakShaNapuri
4.  Allahabad   =  MahAprayAga
5.  Jullundher  =  Jalandhara  (demon  husband  of  VRndA  in  the
SkAnda  PurANa)

Many  thanks  in  advance.
Regards,
B.N.Hebbar
