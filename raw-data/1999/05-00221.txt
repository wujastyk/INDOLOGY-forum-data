True. My maternal grandmother was from Karnataka. (And due to this
influence, my mother always puts a bit of jaggery in the rasam :-)

But the curious thing is, as I pointed out before, my fathers friend who is
an IyengAr also has the same surname as us.

One could well imagine the influence, the conversion of RAmAnuja and VedAnta
Desika to Vaishnavism, would have had on the vaDama community, since both
AchAryas came from the same fold. But centuries later, how did the
conversion from smArtha to Vaishnava occur?

Not that it isn't possible, but is rather strange.

And my father's friend traces the MahArAshtrian connection through our
common surname.
