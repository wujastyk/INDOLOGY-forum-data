See the account of Skandha's birth in the Mahabharata at MBh 3.207-221,
especially 3.219 (van Buitenen, vol. 2:  657-9), where Skandha gives his
"Mothers" (the divorced wives of the seers) the right to afflict children
until they are 16 years old.  A graha ("Grasper," "Grabber") then emerges
from Skandha's body to afflict the young.  A number of other grahas are
enumerated in 3.219.

There is an allusion to the idea that the young are subject to various
grahas at MBh 11.4.6, following a brief description of gestation.
