Dear Memebers of the List,

I have noted that some of you could not get Discovery of Dravidian as the
common source of Indo-European at http://datanumeric.com/dravidian. Iam
getting it ok. However, I shall check into it and see if there is a possibly
problem involved. Sorry for the inconvenience. All the best.

V.Keerthi Kumar (v.k.kumar at excite.com).
