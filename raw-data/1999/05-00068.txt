Good idea ! So, if one classifies the study of Indology, not as per
subject matter, but as per the racial origins of the investigators, then -

22nd century Oxford dictionary -

" GENTOO Studies - The study of India conducted by Europeans, since Gentoo
is an Anglo-Indian and Portuguese word for pagan Indians, being a
corruption of proper English `Gentile'."

" HINDOO (or Hindu) Studies - The study of India conducted by Arabs, since
Hindu is a corruption of the Arabic `Hindwi'."

So - World Journal of Hindu Studies : Journal published by Arabs on
India (!). Also -

" ARYA Studies - Indology conducted by Aryans (ie. Indo-Aryans, not the
`Mleccha' Europeans) in Sanskrit and on Sanskrit."

" DASYOO Studies - The study of Sudras and Dravidians conducted by Aryas."

" SUDROLOGY & DRAVIDOLOGY - The study by Dravidians and other Sudras on
Sudra culture."

What would one call the study of Aryans conducted by Dravidians ?
