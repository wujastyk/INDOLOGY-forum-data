Greek and Sanskrit have a common origin. This origin may be about 4500 BC,
although we cannot date it exactly. I would suggest that you read an
introduction to comparative linguistics. There are several available, also in
French. You may also want to have a look at Bernard Sergent's book "Les
Indo-Europeens", where you get a bird's eye view of the problems.

Best regards,
