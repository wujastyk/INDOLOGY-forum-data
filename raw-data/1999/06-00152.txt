Any library with an exchange relationship with the Library of Congress
is welcome to one of two extra copies of the following:

Kashmir : Foreign press comment
v. 5
New Delhi : Information Service of India

OCLC shows U. Wisconsin having this title (vols. not specified).

It does not appear in the fiche collection  Political pamphlets from
the Indian subcontinent. {Bethesda, MD} : University Publication{s} of
America, c1990, produced from materials in LC's collections. I have
not checked whether it appears in the microfiche collections on
Kashmir that LC-New Delhi has produced.
