How on earth could Max-Mueller have fascist leanings? He died before fascism
was invented?

Why did so many intellectuals espouse totalitarian ideologies at all, not
simply fascism, but also marxism-leninism, not to mention stalinism and maoism?
The question is interesting in itself, but it does not belong on Indology.

This is nonsense - excuse me. Are you implying that ALL German indologists
were/are Nazis????? Or that there is a marked difference in method between
German indologists and the rest of the caste? Whatever problems of method and
modernization are besetting Indology, the reason given above is hardly it.

You might probably like to read Sheldon Pollock's article on the subject of
German Indologists and Nazism. See:

Deep Orientalism? Notes on Sanskrit and Power Beyond the Raj. In: Orientalism
and the Postcolonial Predicament. Edited by Carol A. Breckenridge and Peter van
der Veer.
University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia 1993.

BTW, as you will see, he claims that the academic methods of these scholars
were impeccable, if I remember correctly.
