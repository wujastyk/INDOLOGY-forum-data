In the tradition of sharing news about each other's research, I submit the
following. Those who are NOT interested in study areas such as Vedaanta,
Saa.mkhya, Sanskrit grammar, grammatical theory, dramaturgy and teaching of
Sanskrit as a language need not read the following details.

In 1998-99, the following of my writings have appeared in print (volume
titles have been given without diacritical marks, so that they would
conform with what you are likely to find in library listings):

Monographs:

1999. _The Theory of Nipatas (Particles) in Yaska's Nirukta_. Pune:
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. Post-graduate and Research
Department Series No. 42. Pandit Shripad Shastri Deodhar Memorial Lectures,
sixt series. Pp. xii + 107. I did not have control over the quality of
paper used. Please read for content and convey corrections, if any, to me.
