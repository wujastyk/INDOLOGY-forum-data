In reply to Lars Martin Fosse's message of 1 Jun 99, 16:55:


Dear Lars,

I hope you (or anybody else, for that matter) did not take offence at
my remark on "old" people. Nothing personal was intended, all the
more as I perfectly know you "cope", having been on this list for
some years now, and enjoyed many of your former contributions.

I was just playing with your words to bring home the idea that,
rather than falling back on the somewhat dispiriting role of parents
or grandparents, we should strive to continue as children, proudly
owning the *blame* that the ancient oriental wise men imputed to
Solon: "O SolOn, SolOn, HellEnes aei paides este...".

(Need it be said: I am not talking against parents or grandparents :-)


Best wishes,
