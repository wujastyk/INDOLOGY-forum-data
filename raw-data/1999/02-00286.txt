> Avalokita. From Buddhabhadra (5th century AD) as given in
> Lokesh Chandra
I do not know this particular work of Lokesh Chandra
 and Shikshananda (7th century AD) as given
> in Thomas Cleary.
but I know some of T. Cleary (including Avatamsaka) and there is
no doubt his works are easy to read, they are often entertaining but
they cannot in any case be called scholarly or critical.

Hope this clears the air where my data
> on Mt. Potalaka of Gv comes from.
