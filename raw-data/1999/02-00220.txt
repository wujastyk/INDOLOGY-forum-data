Unfortunately I have received his address from the Early Mediaval
Chinese mailing list as a response to your question I posted there.
I do not know who he is.

I do not think that is correct as the reasoning in these
commentaries and articles I remember has been related to the last
two chapters as a whole, not to any particular message in them. I
think it was philological reasoning, but please do not quote me on
anything here. When I will have chance to go to good Chinese
library I can check the commentaries but I have no material at my
hand.
Actualy the whole geography was not written by Xuan Zang but by
Bian4Ji1who wrote the geography from the information he collected
from XuanZang and I think the parts 10-12 are written in diferrent
style. Please do not quote me anywhere on anything related to
thses topics.

Sincerely

Petr Mares
