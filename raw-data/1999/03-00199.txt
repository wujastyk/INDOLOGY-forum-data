I would like to turn the attention of the Author(s) and all the signatories 
of this dramatic petition to something that does not lend credence to it. 
The second sentence reads:

>The situation is getting so bad that one person in an editorial of the 
Times compared the treatment of women there to the treatment of Jews in 
pre-Holocaust Poland.>

The Times might be a reliable source of knowledge. But certainly not in this
