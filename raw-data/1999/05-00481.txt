When the Vedic Aryans moved further East into modern U.P., Aryavarta
gets defined. Which Sanskrit texts downgrade the present Punjab area
(Pakistan, India) as the land of Mlecchas and Non-Aryans? Is it in Manu?
What about Puranas? Did this occur after Hunas, Shakas etc., invaded
the Punjab and West India?

Thanks for clues,
SM
