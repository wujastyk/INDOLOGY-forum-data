I have read about this mind boggling phenomenon before. Are you the same
author who wrote of The Dravidian and their identity? Fascinating. Simply
fascinating.  Please reply to this address. Love to here from you. I will
access your new site with your new address. Thanks and as always I am still
here!

With best Regards,

Dhanesh Kumar.
