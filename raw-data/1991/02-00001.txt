Dear Richard,
 
Brett Kessler has been very active in writing the date conversion
utility that you refer to.  It is called chrono, and currently
deals with Gregorian, Julian and Hillel dates.  The Hijra calendar
is to go in very shortly.  Brett is kindly allowing me to
test the program as he develops it.  It is currently looking very
robust and good, and promises to be a very useful program for
all of us.
 
With the test suite that Brett has been making available to me, he
includes the following bibliography:
