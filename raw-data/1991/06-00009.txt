Dear M. Klaiman,
 
The list is for the exchange of Indological information, i.e, about
Sanskrit, Tamil, Classical Indian culture, texts, history, grammar,
philology, art etc.  It is not meant to duplicate the more contemporary
and current events oriented coverage of the Usenet group
soc.culture.india.
 
The membership is for the sort of people who might subscribe to the
Journal of the American Oriental Society, the Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society, Indo-Iranian Journal, Zeitschrift der Deutschen
Morgenland Gesellschaft, J. Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, and
so on. If the arrival of these on your doromat gives you a kick,
INDOLOGY is your group.
 
INDOLOGY is run using the LISTSERV software, and generously hosted by
Liverpool University.  To join, send the message
     subscribe Indology M. Klaiman
to the address
     listserv at liverpool.ac.uk
 
Then you will receive an automatic acknowledgment message, with
some guidelines, and you will start to get the messages that
are posted to INDOLOGY.
 
To post a message yourself, just write something and email it to
     indology at liverpool.ac.uk
 
NB:  instructions to listserv at ...

Best wishes,
 
Dominik
