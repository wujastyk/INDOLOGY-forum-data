The IJIS is published twice a year through Peter Lang (New York). It
is a refereed journal that is intended to serve as a forum for
multidisciplinary studies of Indian culture and society, past and
present. Each issue is planned to be about 150 pages long.
 
The first issue (1990) contained the following articles:
Romesh Diwan and Suresh Desai, "People power, perestroika and Gandhian
   economics"
Timothy J. Scrase, "Cultural hegemony and the dialectics of educational
   reform in India"
Judith M. Brown, "Gandhi: Guru for the 1990's?"
Sandor Sipos, "The Development debate and liberalisation policy in
   India"
David W. Atkinson, "Tagore as critic of Gandhi"
Vaman Rao, "Some glitches in Indian agricultural development"
