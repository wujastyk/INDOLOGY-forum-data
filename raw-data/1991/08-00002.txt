My name is Peter Granda and I am at the University of Michigan.  I studied
Tamil for a short while at Madurai University and completed a dissertation
in the History Department using Tamil inscriptions from the 14-16th
centuries as my principal sources.  My research was on property rights and
agricultural production/resource control in the Tamil country during the
Vijayanagara period.  I presently work at the Institute for Social Research
here in Ann Arbor and am not currently doing active research in the field
but I do like to keep in touch with developments as much as I can.
Vanakkam and welcome to the discussion group.  P.S. I am out of town for
the next 3 weeks.   Peter
