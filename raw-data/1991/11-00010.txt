I was very pleased to see a review of Lee Siegel's delightful,
provocative, and extremely funny _Net of Magic: Wonders and
Deceptions of India_ (U. Chicago Press, 1991) in the current issue of
Scientific American (November 1991, pp. 102 f.).  Well deserved
publicity: may it cause his book to vanish from the shops in great
numbers.  Om, gilli gilli gilli! Yantru-mantru-tantru-jalaajalaa-tantru!
 
Phat!
