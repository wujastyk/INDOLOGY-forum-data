 Usenet is based in "Unix land" but there are feeds to both DEC and
 IBM systems.  To recieve it on an IBM VM machine you need some free
 software (Penn State is one supplier) and an electronic feed.  We
 have Usenet (NetNews) here on our VAX cluster and are now testing a
 feed to our IBM VM system.  Our initial feed comes to the VAX from
 a Unix machine at another University.  Best check with your local
 sysadmin people.  If you would like any further info let me know and
 I'll dig up what I have.
