Would anyone be willing to offer intelligent comments on the recent article by
 Harry H. Hicks and Robert N. Anderson "Analysis of an Indo-European Vedic
Aryan Head - 4500-2500 B.C."?  This article appeared in a recent issue
of the Journal of Indo-European Studies.  Unfortunately I haven't got
further details with me.
