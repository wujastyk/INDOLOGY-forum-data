I am preparing a bibliography on the Ashokan inscriptions and have
collected some 900 articles and books. There are a lot of Indian and
other Journals which are not readily accessible at Freiburg. I would
be glad if you could slip me a note whenever you find an article or
a reference in a book dealing with the inscriptions which seems somewhat
hidden.
