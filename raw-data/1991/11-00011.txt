I very much appreciate Jonathan's summary of the important issues surrounding
the discussion of adopting devanagari as the standard in academic writing
pertaining to Indology/Buddhology. It is clear that there are two camps which
correspond neatly to Indologists and Buddologists. The former would work
comfortably with nagari, the latter word experience difficulty. As the two
demonstrate a great deal of overlap and benefit from each other's
 contributions,I must say that Jonathan's comments are well founded and I
 should be inclined
at this point to opt for the status quo.  Thank Jonathan for clear picture.
