  These are excellent points, with whose sensibilities I agree entirely,
but which do not, I believe, bear on the matter as to whether one should
print one's hardcopy output in Devanagari.  [I am skipping over JS's
comments on Buddhism/Sanskrit as I have no opinion; regarding OCR: no data
which originates from a computer transcription should have to be scanned---
the original data file should be made available].
  *Many* of the systems currently available for output of devanagari
do so in association with an input method or encoding system which
substantially reduces the *data* value of the encoded text: i.e. it
is in a proprietary system-specific form, it records vowel marks and
consonant marks on separate lines, . . .  For representation as data
a reasonable Romanization, or any other essentially phonetic transcription
system, is much to be preferred.
  Ahem.  There is nothing to say, however, that the data cannot be entered
in a reasonable form, perhaps even the proposed CSX [Classical Sanskrit
Extended] encoding system, then converted to the form appropriate for
the software which will produce the printed copy.  It is, for instance,
perfectly feasible to adapt the recently available as freeware Nagari
font of Frans Velthuis for use with CSX encoding.  If nobody else
does it first, I will endeavor to do so by Christmas, as an exercise for
writer.
 
cheers,
Tom
