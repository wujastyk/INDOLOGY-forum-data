Dear Professor Paturi,

thank you. Yes, I am looking also for such studies, which are more based on
hard sciences rather than on soft sciences.

I am also looking for some trans-disciplinary studies on Tantric
architectures (and arts) approached through the lens of geometry,
arithmetic, and algebra.

Best wishes,
Paolo
