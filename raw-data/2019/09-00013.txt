Dear Shihong Zhao,

This is a Pali manuscript written in Old Burmese script, otherwise known as
Square Script or Tamarind-seed Script. It contains the Kacc?yana Pali
grammar, only the suttas, wihtout the gloss (vutti), which is quite
remarkable. I have never seen a Kacc?yana manuscript written in the old
script and I have never seen a Kacc?yana manuscript without the gloss. Old
Burmese Script is normally used in kammav?c? texts.

Do you know the origin of the manuscript? Any date?

Best wishes,
Aleix
