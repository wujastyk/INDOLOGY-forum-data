Dear Jonathan,

With the agreement of authors and editors, all monographs, editions
and proceedings that I publish will be available in an Open Access
edition to coincide with the initial print release.

It is relatively easy to ensure the long term availability of the Open
Access edition. Both physical and electronic copies are deposited --
Legal Deposit-- with the National Library of New Zealand.

The upshot, for example, is that this recently published edition is
available to borrow or to download:

Gaffney, Sean (2018) sKyes pa rabs kyi gle? g?i (J?takanid?na): a
critical edition based on six editions of the Tibetan bKa' 'gyur.
Indica et Buddhica J?takanid?na, v. 1. Oxford: Indica et Buddhica
Publishers.

Dear Dan
I hope I am not seen as a shill for publishers, but I would like to
point out that what you say is not quite right. How are contributions
to be found? How is their continued presence to be assured? How are
materials to be distributed? There are many more questions like this
that your brief explanation omits, but that are vital. All of us have
experienced multiple times a 404 message when following a link to an
article or contribution of interest. If we want our publications to
last, this is not a viable model. This statement is not a positive
assertion of what is in fact the optimal model, but it does point out a
weakness in your questioning. I think that there are some viable
options out there, but it's not nearly as simple as you suggest.
Jonathan
