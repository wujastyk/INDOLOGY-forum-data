Of course, technically, Tri?a?ku does not seek to enter the heavenly world(s) through tapas, but rather by having a sacrifice performed on his behalf for this purpose. Thus he first approaches Vasi??ha, then Vasi??ha?s sons and finally, in his cursed form, Vi?v?mitra. Then there are also various accounts of mortals who are able to travel to heaven in their earthly  bodies on a temporary basis, such as Arjuna at Mbh. 3.43 ff.  and Dil?pa at Raghuva??a 1. 75 ff. etc.

I have encountered sa?ar?ra/sva?ar?ra in the episodes of Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka from the V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a, but would be curious to know of other places where these or similar concepts show up.  In both of these episodes, the goal of Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka is to enter some sort of heavenly realm or divine form (variously referred to as divam, gatim, svargam, devatvam etc.) with their body.  Also in these episodes, Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka have gone rogue to engage in tapas as a way of achieving this goal.
