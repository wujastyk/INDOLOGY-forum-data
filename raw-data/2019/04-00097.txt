Dear Jesse, 

Artha??stra 1.20.16 mentions among others the queen who ? killed the king of K??? by mixing fried grain with poison under the guise of honey. ?

Here is the passage of the A? followed by Kangle?s translation:

1.20.16 	l?j?n madhuneti vi?e?a paryasya dev? k???r?jam vi?adigdhena n?pure?a vairantyam mekhal?ma?in? sauv?ram j?l?tham ?dar?ena, ve?y?? g??ha? ?astra? k?tv? dev? vid?ratha? jagh?na. 
? The queen killed the king of K??? by mixing fried grain with poison under the guise of honey; (the queen killed) Vairantya with an anklet smeared with poison, the king of the Sauv?ras with a (poison-smeared) girdle jewel, J?l?tha with a (poison-smeared) mirror; the queen killed Vid?ratha by keeping a weapon concealed in the braid of her hair. ? (R.P. Kangle, 1972, vol. 2, p. 50).

You might also want to have a look at Kalha?a?s R?jatara?gi?? 7.685 and 8.1276-1278 where Vid?ratha is mentioned (vid?rath?div?tt?ntam (?) kelik?a?e bruvan (?)). Medh?tithi?s commentary on Manu 7.153 mentions anecdotes about kings who were assassinated by queens. I have written a few pages in my PhD dissertation on this topic and I would be happy to share them with you, even though my dissertation is in French. 

Kind regards,

> Dear Friends, To emphasize how careful the king should be even among his intimates, the N?tis?ra presents a series of brief anecdotes about kings who were assassinated by by their wives and family members for a variety of reasons (specified concisely by the comm. Jayama?gal?). I was wondering if any of you know these stories in more detail from other sources. These are the stories of Bhadrasena (killed by his brother hiding in the queen's quarters), K?r??a (killed by his son hiding under his mother's bed), a certain K??ir?jendra (killed by wife with poisoned rice), Vair?pya (killed with a poisoned girdle-jem), and J?ru?ya (killed by a small dagger hidden in the queen's braid). Thanks and all best, ??????,J
