Message-ID: <CADSGPzU6GUMrS_5XVt6EkxGPT=XH-Jd_dav2JUxeaSawEbzieQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear scholars,

Kindly find attached the famous Sanskrit lexicon Vaijayanti (????????) by
Yadavaprakasha (??????????) digitized.
https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/vaijayanti_yadavaprakasha/orig/vaijayanti.txt

Annotation and further processing is pending. Will take quite some time to
complete that exercise.

Any suggestions or corrections are welcome.
