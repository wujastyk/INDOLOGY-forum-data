Subject: [INDOLOGY] Some questions on Alphabet in Lalitavistara
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdQt3e9YMTR=0Rj_M5T+aKBi++5iTgTVAgp6dtGZT2oCg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

     As I have been reading the Lipi??l?sandar?ana-Parivarta [p. 89, P. L.
Vaidya edition], some interesting features of the alphabet popped up for
me.  The Alphabet omits *r?* and *l?*, but includes *ai, au*, and *a?*.
Among the consonants, it adds *k? *at the end after *h*.  The version of
this passage as given in the Bauddh?gam?rthasa?graha [ed by P. L. Vaidya]
also omits *l*, while it is included in the version of Lalitavistara edited
by Vaidya himself.  I wonder if there are textual variants about this.  I
don't know what this alphabet represents.  The omission of *r? *and *l? *goes
along the phonologies of Prakrits, but the inclusion of *ai, au*, and *a?* goes
in the direction of Sanskrit.  The addition of *k? *and the possible
omission of *l *point to something else that I cannot figure out.  Any
suggestions and references are welcome.
