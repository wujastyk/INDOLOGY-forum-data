I don't believe that sth?n?sth?na - also known from Buddhist sources - has yet been added to the list.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Formations of the ghan?ghana type

Many thanks to Stefan Baums for the additional examples phal?phala and bhav?bhava. I find it interesting that so many (all?) of these reduplications with -?- not derived from a verb root seem to come from Buddhist texts. Does this suggest a MIA origin of this feature?

sinhalese kara / ko?a = sk k?tv?.

Any idea for translating  yukti ayukti k?tv? in a different way?

This is not my area, but would something like 'justifying the unjust' be possible?

Best wishes,
Martin
