Dear list members,

What is the verbal category of pracoday?t in g?yatr? mantras . For example :
 ekadant?ya vidmahe
vakratu???ya dh?mahi
tan no dant? pracoday?t


Is it a causative subjunctive similar to the example in Whitney's grammar section 1043  dh?ray?t
or is it a benedictive/precative?  Is there such a thing as a causative precative?


Thanks,
Harry Spier
