Dear Risa-Jana,
  Would anyone have a reference details for a book published in the '50s: Raghunandan Bhattacharya's A???vi??atitattvam? It is printed in Bengali font. As a student of sm?ti I studied several sections of the book, including Malam?satattvam. I would appreciate any help.
Thanks.
Mandakranata
