Medh?tithi?s take on how Manu composed his work by bring a group of scholars together, see Jha?s edition, Vol. 1, p. 65, second para. See also pl 67, last para about even his contemporaries could write sm?tis!!

Dear Prof. Olivelle,

would you by any chance have a source of Madha?tithi?s remarks about Manu, or could perhaps recommend a text edition where to find it? I think this would be something very interesting to read with my students.

Best regards,


Raik Strunz

If you are responding to my post, then you have misunderstood it. My point was simply that the apauru?eyatva of the Veda was central to Dharma??stric views regarding the epistemology of dharma, and this tenet was borrowed from the sister school of M?m??s?, as Jan Houben stated. I am not talking about the apauru?eyatve of Dharma??stras!! These texts were always believed to have been humanly authored. See Madh?tithi?s wonderful, almost modern, view of how Manu composed his treatise.

Dr.Houben,

With due respect,If I may just highlight a point ,namely, Dharmashastra is a part of Smriti , or more specifically , a part of Vedanga.Can we term it as "Apauruesheya"? Stuti is "Apauruesheya", but is.Smriti so?
