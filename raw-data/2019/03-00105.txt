Thanks to Madhav Deshpande, Andrey Klebanov and Harry Spier for their 
(off-list) replies to my question, confirming that the sandhi /e + a > a 
a/ is indeed non-standard. Madhav wrote:

The work in question is a largish one (~550 stanzas) and written in 
perfectly grammatical, sometimes even elegant Sanskrit in a variety of 
metres, with no particular suggestion of being hybrid, and the witnesses 
I have seen (two of the work itself, and half a dozen of another work 
quoting the verse in question) all agree on the reading of this passage.

Harry raised the same point about the metre (sv?gat?), but it wouldn't 
be difficult to rephrase the p?da so as to conform to both metre and 
standard sandhi (e.g., tena v?pi sahite 'sya ca labdhis). So I am left 
with the impression that Y?davas?ri must have considered his choice of 
sandhi in this case unproblematic, although he usually follows the 
stardard rule /e + a > e [']/.

Thanks again,
Martin
