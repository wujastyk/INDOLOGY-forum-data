Dear list,

I supposed this announcement is some kind of joke, for I received this 
mail on 14 April morning, while the deadline for submission is 15 April 
2019.
Or is there a complementary information I don't have, like a 
postponement of the deadline ?


Best regards,

Dr Jean Michel Delire,
Lecturer on Science and civilization of India at the University of 
Brussels
