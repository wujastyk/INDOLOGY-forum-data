Subject: [INDOLOGY] the influence of shadows?

There's a minor ??stra on this topic called "ch?y?puru?a" with texts of
this name in many manuscript catalogues.  It's a component of
jyoti???stra.  I think it has come up in this forum before, so an archive
search might turn up information.

Best,
Dominik
