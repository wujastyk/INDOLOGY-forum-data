I wonder if anyone has come across the word /udagagni/, or some other 
compound meaning 'northern/upward fire', other than in the ritual 
context of sacrificial fires? I am not at all sure what it means, but it 
is mentioned (in the astrological work H?yanasundara, v. 166) together 
with lightning and thunder (and enemies):

sy?t ketuyutad???a? cet kujo vidyudbhaya?kara? | sy?n meghagarjan?d 
bh?ti? codagagniripor api ||

(The Sanskrit of the HS is not very elegant, and I don't think 
/udagagniripo? /is anything more complicated than a dvandva, despite the 
singular inflection. It could even be a scribal error f?r /udagagne[?] 
ripo?/.)

Thanks in advance for any suggestions,

Martin Gansten
