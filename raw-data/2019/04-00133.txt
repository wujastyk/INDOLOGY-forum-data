On a related note, let me draw everyone's attention to a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education on monograph publishing and subventions (attached). Obviously, some of the issues discussed may play out differently in different contexts, but it is good to think with.  In particular, my interest is how some of us?given that our career choices are likely leave us with rather modest assets?might be able to positively affect future generations of the field.  Funding subventions (and, I would add, also conference travel grants for grad students) is a fantastic route where smaller amounts of money can go a very long way.

My best,

Steven
