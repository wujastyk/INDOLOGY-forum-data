Let me add a comment right now.

That ?r?macchakuna? cannot be corrupted from ?r?matthakkana? is of  
course completely correct. My original consideration was that ?akuna  
could have been a reading in a direct or indirect source of the verse  
(which is not to be emended text-critically then), but I had lost the  
focus on this in the further discussion.

Walter's idea that the author could have replaced the negatively  
connoted sthagana with a positively connoted ?akuna, is very worth  
considering. Something similar could have happened in the course of  
the transmission of the Tibetan translation. It is conceivable that  
sgrib byed was held to be inappropriate for a name (and therefore to  
be a potential textual corruption) and was replaced by sgrib med  
(perhaps in the sense of an?vara?a "free from destruction", or similar).

Best,
Roland
