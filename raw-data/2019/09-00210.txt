Dear Colleagues,

At the risk of shameless self promotion I wish to announce the publication of a novel I have written.

In Search of Bliss. A Tale of Early Buddhism, (Vanguard, Cambridge, HK)

It is being released tomorrow and can be obtained from most large booksellers.

https://www.bookdepository.com/Search-Bliss-Tale-Early-Buddhism-Greg-Bailey/9781784655952?ref=grid-view&qid=1569137156647&sr=1-2

https://www.amazon.com/Search-Bliss-Tale-Early-Buddhism-ebook/dp/B07XPB59KR/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=Greg+Bailey&qid=1569312623&s=books&sr=1-16

It is a fictional work detailing search for details about the Buddha?s cousin, Ananda, eight hundred years after the Buddha?s parinirvana. Some of you may be interested in it.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey
