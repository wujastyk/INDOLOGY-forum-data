Dear Colleagues

Thank you so much for the link to the new version at http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/buddh/mhvastuu.htm

It works perfectly. I wonder why Google couldn?t find it?

> (1) Does anyone know where there is a searchable Sanskrit text of the Mah?vastu Avad?na online? The one formerly at http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/buddh/mhvastuu.htm <http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/buddh/mhvastuu.htm>seems to have disappeared.
> 
> (2) Similarly with a searchable translation? The versions I?ve found of the J J Jones one are frustrating to use: see (3).
> 
> (3) Does anyone understand the verse and chapter numbering of this text? The text references and translation seem to use a completely different system.
> 
> (4) Has anyone got Basak?s text to hand? If so, I would be grateful to see copies of a couple of pages.
