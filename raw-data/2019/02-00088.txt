Dear friends and colleagues,

there is also

   Swinton, John. 1757. ?Some Remarks on a Parthian Coin with a
   Greek and Parthian Legend, Never Before Published.?
   Philosophical Transactions 50: 175?188

   http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101037075148?urlappend=%3Bseq=197

The non?Greek legend on the coin in question is actually in
G?ndh?r? (so maybe not exactly what Arlo was looking for), and
Swinton?s attempt at decipherment goes astray. Quite interesting,
though, as an earlier example of the nineteenth?century
decipherment efforts of Prinsep and others.

All best,
Stefan
