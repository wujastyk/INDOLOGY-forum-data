There is of course a similar, elaborately painted room in the Bhaktapur Palace, 15 km east of Kathmandu.

As for such  inscriptions you could contact the recently retired  prof. of arts of the U. Wisconsin @  Madison: Gautam Bajarcharya, at:

Dear Harsha

I am writing to tell you that in the Nepalese Patan palace (painting Museum now) there is an extensively painted room on the second floor on the durbar (south) side. In late 2002/3 my late colleague Dina Bangdel and I were permitted to photograph it in a "rush" one afternoon. It included the many inscriptions but with Dina's untimely death there is no one with the language skills to work on the material.

All the best

John

Friends:

While we have references to chitrashalas or a gallery of paintings, and in medieval India, as in Bundi for example, we have rooms in the fort where every inch is painted and it looks like a picture gallery, is there any reference to Museums, as we know it today, in ancient India?

Kind regards,
