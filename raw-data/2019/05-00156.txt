Dear Colleagues,

     There are discussions on the quotation ??????? ????????? ????? ?????
??????????? in commentaries on the Siddh?nta Kaumud?.  Looks like a quote
from a work on ?yurveda.  None of the ?yurveda texts that I have has a
verse index.  I am wondering if anyone came across this line in a known
text.  Grammarians like N?ge?abha??a have argued that the use of nominative
in ????? in this verse is ungrammatical.  ????? ????????? occurs in several
other places, but this is the only quote that has ????? ???????????.  I
will appreciate any help in tracing this quotation.  Best,
