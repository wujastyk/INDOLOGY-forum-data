I would read this as
?H. R.?

Best,

Dear all,

My question concerns the first initial in Roman script. The rest is clear to me. Also, if it seems that it is not P./B. R. Puru??ttama N?ya?u, then I would be happy to receive any other suggestions.

Many Thanks,
Victor

Dear all,

I am hoping that someone might be able to help me with the reading of the first initial found in the image below. I would like this to be the autograph of Pu. R?. Puru?ottama N?ya?u, a renowned ?r?-Vai??ava scholar, but I find it difficult to see a P or a B (as it is sometimes given) in the letter as written. The date, 10/4/(19)28 falls comfortably within his lifespan (1901-1976).

Many Thanks,

Victor

P.S. Please let me know if the image has not come through.
