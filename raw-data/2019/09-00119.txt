Dear Martin,

I would certainly want to add the JAtakamAlA of AryazUra, both for its intrinsic merits of elegance and emotive subtlety, and for its contribution to the formation of the campU genre.

The BodhicaryAvatAra of ZAntideva, too, for its exquisitve expression of a spiritual path.

best,
Matthew

Here is what I have so far thank you:

1.Sankara?s Brahma-sutra-bhasya for the superb prose style and clarity.

2. Bha??ik?vya: "I love grammar, I love pedagogy, and I love poetry, and so an epic didactic poem about grammar is just the bee's knees for me."

Kindest wishes,

Martin

Dear Colleagues,

I have a lecture to prepare and am conducting a short survey:

I would like to know from the Sanskrit scholarly community what those feel are the utmost most excellent works from the entire corpora and a short line about why.

Think of it as "if there were to be a Pullitzer or Booker Prize for the notable Sanskrit works", who and what would be the nominees and why.

It could be a text that was of exceptional technical value for example P??ini's A???dhy?y? or those that have introduced a novel method in a field of science for example the Su?rutasa?hit?. Then of course a notable poetic marvel such as ?akuntal?.

If there exist some already compiled lists of the same I would most appreciate it.

With warmest wishes,

Martin
