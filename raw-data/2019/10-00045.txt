Also, the Caraka Sa?hit? has a section on embryology and related discussions in other sections. For beginners, there are a couple of readable English translations (one by Priyavrat Sharma; and the other by Vaidya Bhagwan Dash ; assisted by Kanchan Gupta). There is a book chapter by Robert Kritzer in Imagining the fetus: the unborn in myth, religion, and culture. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press / (American Academy of Religion cultural criticism series.) /(American Academy of Religion religion and culture series) 2009,

titled:
?Life in the Womb: Conception and Gestation in Buddhist Scripture and Classical Indian Medical Literature?

Summary
The classical Indian medical texts all contain detailed chapters on embryology, and many Indian religious works also discuss the topics of conception and gestation. Although much of the content of the medical and religious accounts is similar, the attitudes revealed are, not surprisingly, quite different; the medical treatises maintain a neutral tone and seek to promote the birth of healthy male babies, while the religious texts dwell on the suffering of both mother and fetus and on the undesirability of rebirth. The Buddhist Garbh?vakr?ntis?tra contains an unusual week-by-week account of gestation, which in this chapter is compared to a month-by-month account found in the medical text Carakasa?hit? .

Dan
