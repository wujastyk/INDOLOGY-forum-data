Is there any pictorial description/representation of these assisting devices in iconography or Jain/Buddhist/Hindu Yoga practice?

Since it is appears not to be mentioned in the article cited by Lubomir or in Philipp?s article (forgive me if I have missed it), it is perhaps worth adding that this kind of strap is also mentioned in Pali sources where it is called ?yogapa??a. In the Visuddhimagga Buddhaghosa describes the  ?sitter?s practice? (nesajjika?ga), the last in the list of 13 ascetic practices, as follows:

'This has three grades too. Herein, one who is strict is not allowed a back-rest or cloth band or binding-strap (?yogapa??a). The medium one is allowed any one of these three. The mild one is allowed a back-rest, a cloth band, a binding-strap, a cushion, a ?five-limb? and a ?seven-limb" [chair].? (After ???amoli, Path of Purification, II.74)

Best wishes,

Rupert

Dear Herman,
Further textual references to the use of a yoga strap in yoga literature can be found on p. 71 of my article "'Sthirasukham ?sanam': Posture and Performance in Classical Yoga and Beyond", which you find published in open-access here<https://www.academia.edu/32024344/_Sthirasukham_%C4%80sanam_Posture_and_Performance_in_Classical_Yoga_and_Beyond>.

Best wishes,

Dear List members,

Jaina monks, or their followers, are often depicted sitting with a strap going around their bodies and legs. (a few years ago I saw this contraption in a posh interior decorating shop in Leiden as an alternative chair!) Could anyone tell me if this strap, or sitting supported by this strap, had a (Sanskrit, MIA or NIA) name. By the way, it is not a particular Jaina practice. If I remember well, the strap can also be seen on, for instance, the Borobudur.
