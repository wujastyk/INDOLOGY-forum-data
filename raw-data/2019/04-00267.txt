Dear Dr Roebuck,

Following your enquiry sent through the Indology list, please allow me to send you below my translation of the two Ud?navarga verses from the Tibetan. As you surmised, there is no mention of a spider!

With best wishes,

Dear Colleagues,

I would appreciate it if you sent responses to the query below to vjroebuck at btinternet.com<mailto:vjroebuck at btinternet.com>.

Dear Colleagues

Can anyone kindly provide a translation of two verses from the Tibetan Ud?navarga (Ched dubrjod pa?i tshoms), Chapter 1 vv 13-14?

Part of v. 14 is missing from the Sanskrit Ud?navarga, but it appears to exist in the Tibetan version. However, from Rockhill?s 1883 translation (the only one currently available to me) it looks as though the Tibetan departs quite drastically from the Sanskrit. It?s part of a sequence on the impermanence of human existence.

The Sanskrit, as edited by Bernhard:

Uv_1.13ab: yath?pi tantre vitate yad yad uta? samupyate /
Uv_1.13cd: alpa? bhavati v?tavyam eva? martyasya j?vitam //
Uv_1.14ab: yath?pi va - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - /
Uv_1.14cd: - - - ghatano bhavati eva? martyasya j?vitam //

My (tentative) translation:

13. Just as, when yarn is stretched out,
Whatever was woven is sheared
And soon must be sewn up,
Such is the life of a mortal.

14. Just as ... [section missing]
?
?.destruction,
Such is the life of a mortal.

Rockhill has:

13 (347) It is with the life of mortal man as with the spider, who, stretching hither and thither its web, is enclosed in it.

14. It is with the life of mortal man as with (the spider), who, though it would free itself from its trap, finds, whichever way it takes a step, the abode of death before it.

There is definitely no spider (usually ?r?an?bha) in the Sanskrit as we have it: verse 13 appears to be about a (human) weaver, not an (arachnid) spinner. So is Rockhill drastically over-translating, or has the spider somehow crept in between the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the Ud?navarga?

Many thanks -
