Subject: [INDOLOGY] The alphabet found in the Lalitavistara
Message-ID: <f269319a9eb74e1fb0401d2dd89863e8@uni-jena.de>

Dear Madhav and colleagues,

in NW Indo-Aryan, old k? developed into a new phoneme, a retroflex affricate ??h, and I have long been wondering if this might be one factor relevant for the special status of this ak?ara. Although lack of l might also have been an originally NW feature, I am not sure this would still be relevant at the time, and for the other peculiarities, I don?t see how they might be explained as NW.

All the best,
Martin

Betreff: [INDOLOGY] The alphabet found in the Lalitavistara

Dear Colleagues,

     As I have been reading the Lipi??l?sandar?ana-Parivarta of the Lalitavistara [p. 89, P. L. Vaidya edition], some interesting features of the alphabet popped up for me.  The Alphabet omits r? and l?, but includes ai, au, and a?. Among the consonants, it adds k? at the end after h.  The version of this passage as given in the Bauddh?gam?rthasa?graha [ed by P. L. Vaidya] also omits l, while it is included in the version of Lalitavistara edited by Vaidya himself.  I wonder if there are textual variants about this.  I don't know what this alphabet represents.  The omission of r? and l? goes along the phonologies of Prakrits, but the inclusion of ai, au, and a? goes in the direction of Sanskrit.  The addition of k? and the possible omission of l point to something else that I cannot figure out.  Any suggestions and references are welcome.
