Subject: [INDOLOGY] Problem with some ligatures
Message-ID: <CAODNnZhFBNAWEcxSsFZWd2_ZxErVQf3VEk_jh8iZr5SOCffngw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all
I wonder has any one used ardhavisarga and converted into pdf? I am not
getting these in my own fonts. I could save only in MS office word, but not
in note pad or Indesign. I don't have access to Latex,  I wonder any one
used ardhavisarga and converted into pdf successfully.
