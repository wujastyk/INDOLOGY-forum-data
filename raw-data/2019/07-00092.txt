Subject: [INDOLOGY] Atharvaveda translations
Message-ID: <311f45a7-2960-44ba-3429-1e5e5631b01c@gmx.de>

Dear all,

I have compiled some publicly available translations of the AV in a
common format, so you can address translations of individual stanzas by
searching for something like 1.3.2 (book 1, hymn 3, stanza 2; see the
readme file). The data may be less useful for philologists, but
interesting for NLP (e.g. information retrieval, machine translation
[when much more data are available], automatic word sense
disambiguation, ...):

BTW: If you come across other pre-formatted and relatively error-free
translations of relevant texts, I would be glad to get a short note.

Best, Oliver
