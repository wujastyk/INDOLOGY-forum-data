Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
Message-ID: <2c543d82-cb76-3022-5977-b0b25123f928@gmail.com>

In an Indian astrological journal from 1963 (/Astrology and Athrishta 
/[= /ad???a/] 1.2), I read:

> Have we not heard the usual proverb "Aye! that fellow has Saturn in 
> the tongue? Vakkil-Sani. Ever he predicts evil and never he fails.)

Are any list members familiar with such a proverb/expression? I have not 
seen it referred to anywhere else, but then Tamil isn't one of my languages.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
