Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI

I have written about this kind of topic quite a bit on my blog, over the
years.  I am afraid I must ask you to search it by keyword ("journal",
"copyright", "open access" etc.).  Opinion pieces include:

   - How open is open-access
   <https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-open-is-open-access.html>
   - Business models for OA journals
   <https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2013/01/business-models-for-open-access-journals.html>
   - Crowd-sourcing peer-review
   <https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2016/10/crowd-sourcing-peer-review.html#>
   - What's the point of an academic journal?
   <https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2016/09/notes-on-what-modern-journal-has-to.html>

To answer your question, I've twice published articles where an processing
fee was required for OA publication.  Brill charged ?400, if I recall, for
an article in *Asian Medicine: Tradition and Modernity.  *Springer charged
?2000 or ?3000 (I can't recall) for an OA paper in the *International
Journal of Hindu Studies.*  At that time, these fees were paid by my
employer, who had a budget for this.  My research contract included a
clause saying that all my publications had to be Open Access.

There are many reasons why OA is a good thing.  A short statement of the
main issues is available in this video <https://youtu.be/L5rVH1KGBCY>.  For
more literature on the issues at stake, the DOAJ.org hosts a lot of
documentation and discussion.

You say, "there are still fine journals which don't ask any such fees and
impose very low barriers to access."  This is not the case, unfortunately.
Yes, they may be free for authors, but the many South Asia-related journals
that have been vacuumed up by Cambridge University Press (JRAS, BSOAS,
etc.) are very expensive indeed for readers whose universities don't pay
exorbitant annual license fees.  The video above makes some of these points
about half way through.

Best,
Dominik
