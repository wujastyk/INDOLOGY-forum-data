Subject: [INDOLOGY] Data of Edgerton's Grammar
Message-ID: <CAEd5L8iVPKop9oxPA3WcoT=kj4LD79JF+QZFwWH3-d7T=1LNiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I know that the searchable data of Edgerton?s Buddhist Sanskrit Dictionary
are made open on the internet. Does anybody have also the data of his
Grammar? What I need is not a PDF but a Word-file with Sanskrit diacritical
marks.


Dr. Katarzyna Marciniak and I are now making a three-volumed new edition of
the Mah?vastu, basing on the 12th/13th century palm-leaf manuscript which
retains many Middle Indic elements (Senart?s edition [1882~1897] was made
on the basis of much Sanskritised manuscripts, dating from 1800 C.E.!, and
he himself Sanskritised far further.). Accordingly, BHSG should be revised,
because probably around 70% of the examples in it are quoted from Senart?s
edition of the Mah?vastu. We are also planning to compile a glossary and
grammar of the Mah?vastu, basing on the new edition in the same line with
my work on the Abhisam?c?rik? Dharm?? of the same language and same school,
namely Mah?s??ghika-Lokottav?dins ???? PDF is downloadable at the following
websites:

For this purpose, I need data (not PDF) of BHSG. If anybody has input data,
please share them with me offline.


In this connection, I announce that the third volume of the new edition of
the Mah?vastu, ed. by Dr. Marciniak, 635 pp., is just published from our
institute (31/March/2019) and its PDF will be uploaded on the website of
IRIAB (http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/en/publication/bppb.html) by the beginning
of May.


With best regards,

Seishi Karashima
