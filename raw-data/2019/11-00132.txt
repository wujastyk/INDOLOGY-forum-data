Subject: [INDOLOGY] DORA - move against assesment by journal impact-factors
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Ce04SJd-gFJvNfSFHngxbPQw=j-G6nQXohzX=N3MrPQxQ@mail.gmail.com>

The spread of the DORA <https://sfdora.org/> concept is an interesting
development that may come to affect all of us who apply for research
grants.  It looks like the beginning of the death of journal impact-factors
as a measure of academic value.  Hooray.

Best,
Dominik

Subject: sshrcUofA Tri-Agencies signed DORA agreement!

Canada?s five major national research funders have released a joint
statement re: the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment.


*November 13, 2019* - Canada?s five major national research funders are
pleased to join research leaders around the world who are working to
strengthen research excellence by ensuring robust, equitable and impactful
measures of research assessment. CFI, CIHR, Genome Canada, NSERC and SSHRC
have signed the "DORA Agreement" - the San Francisco Declaration on
Research Assessment <https://sfdora.org/>, reaffirming their commitment to
excellence in research evaluation and the importance of knowledge
translation and mobilization.

DORA is a global initiative to support the development and promotion of
best practice in assessment of scholarly research. It aims to address the
negative consequences of unintended overuse of journal publication as a
primary indicator of quality for research output. To date,
1,557 organizations and 15,006 individuals  are signatories to DORA. These
include funders, publishers, professional societies, institutions and
researchers [including yours truly, and other colleagues at UAlberta].

The DORA agreement stipulates that the quality and impact of research
cannot be measured through journal publications alone.

The implications of the DORA principle extend beyond funding agencies'
policies connecting research excellence to research data management
