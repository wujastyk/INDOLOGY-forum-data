The goal of this session is to bring together scholars working on Hindu philosophy broadly construed, including not only classical schools but a wide range of traditions from the ancient past to the present day. We hope to gauge interest in the possibility of establishing a unit in Hindu philosophy parallel to the existing unit in Buddhist philosophy. The session will include ample time for discussion not just of the papers but also of the state of the field. The theme is ?Philosophy and Practice.? What relationships can we trace between philosophical traditions and ?lived religion?? To what extent do ?abstract? ideas inform concrete practices? To what extent do everyday practices shape the horizon of philosophical possibilities? From the Vedic period to the twentieth century, from aesthetics to political philosophy: together, the four papers highlight the breadth, the methodological diversity, and the promise of the field of Hindu philosophy.
