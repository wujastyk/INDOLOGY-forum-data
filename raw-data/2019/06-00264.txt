@ Antonia Ruppel

Obviously, you're a total leftist shithead.

To start with, Nazis were Socialists. They have nothing to do with the 
Right or even less with the Far-Right, whatever that means.

So you "mail" is nothing but allout Marxist crap.

So I would call the NiwBitch on your mail.

With Best Regards.

A.F
