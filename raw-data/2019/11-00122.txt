Dear Colleagues,

This year the American Academy of Religion will be hosting an exploratory session in Hindu Philosophy at the annual meeting in San Diego. The AAR has long been an important forum for research in Buddhist philosophy, with dedicated units in Buddhist Philosophy, Yog?c?ra, and Buddhist Critical-Constructive Reflection. But there has been no dedicated forum for research in non-Buddhist philosophical traditions of India.

Our hope is to establish a permanent unit in Hindu Philosophy at AAR, and this year's exploratory session is the first step. If you are coming to San Diego, I hope you will consider joining us for our session on Sunday morning, Nov. 24 (full details below). Even if you are only able to come for part of the session, this is still an important way of demonstrating to AAR's Program Committee that there is enough interest to establish a unit. If you are unable to attend but would still like to voice your support for the unit--this includes international colleagues and others who do not regularly attend AAR--feel free to send me an email: <msa2b at virginia.edu>.

The last part of the session will include an open discussion of the future of the unit. Come with thoughts, suggestions, and criticisms. To forestall obvious criticism, I should probably note (in a nod to Buddhist philosophy), that both "Hindu" and "philosophy" are intended as "convenient designators." During the session we can discuss other possible titles for the unit.

Best wishes,
Michael
