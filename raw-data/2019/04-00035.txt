*ECSAS *2020Reflecting on Disciplinary Boundaries

*26th European Conference on South Asian Studies
Vienna, Austria***29 July ? 1 August 2020


 ???? Call for Panels

The *26th European Conference on South Asian Studies* (ECSAS) will be 
held at the University of Vienna, Austria, from *29 July to 1 August 
2020*. On behalf of the European Association for South Asian Studies 
(EASAS) and the Academic and Organising Committees we cordially invite 
you to submit panel proposals.

There is a long tradition of South Asian Studies in Vienna, both at the 
University of Vienna and at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, going back 
to the mid-19^th century. While a strong focus has been on South Asia?s 
premodern period, recent decades have witnessed a process of historical 
as well as disciplinary expansion. South Asian Studies in Austria today 
covers a wide range of disciplines and interests, and extends across 
several institutions. Against this background the motto of the Vienna 
conference will be ?Reflecting on Discipli?nary Boundaries?. We 
particularly welcome panels which reflect on disciplinary boundaries and 
promote trans-, inter- or multidisciplinary approaches.

The *panel submission*is open from *4 February until 5 May 2019*. Please 
go to the conference website: _https://ecsas2020.univie.ac.at/_

All panel proposals must include the title of the panel, the name(s), 
affiliation(s) and the EASAS membership number of the convener(s), a 
contact e-mail, and a short and long abstract of the panel topic. 
Innovative elements of the panel should be particularly high?lighted. 
Names of tentative paper contributors may be included (optional).

The short abstract must not exceed 300 characters, long abstracts must 
not exceed 1700 characters and should be text only. Please keep in mind 
that all panel proposals (and sub?sequent papers) must be in English.

*EASAS membership required*. Please note that all panel conveners must 
be EASAS members at the time of submission. (Join here: 
__https://www.easas.eu/become-a-member/__)
At least one of the conveners must be based at a European institution.

*One panel and paper per conference*. Due to the ?competition for time? 
within such a conference, colleagues are allowed to convene no more than 
one panel and present only one paper during the conference. This does 
not prevent potential participants from making several proposals, but in 
the case of multiple acceptances the convener and/or panelist will be 
asked to choose only one.

*All panels with an open call*. ECSAS requires all accepted panels to be 
open to paper proposals through the website: proposed panels cannot be 
?closed? to further papers from the outset.

All panel submissions will be evaluated by the conference?s Academic 
Committee. Panel proposers will be notified of the outcome by July 2019.

If you have any general queries, please do not hesitate to contact: 
_ecsas2020 at univie.ac.at
_

The abstracts of those panel proposals which have been selected will be 
published on the conference website.

The Call for Papers will be open from *4 September to 17 November 2019*. 
EASAS members can then submit paper proposals to the selected panels.

For the panels accepted by the Academic Committee, it is the 
responsibility of the panel convener(s) to:

 ?? *

 ???? review the proposed papers in line with the conference guidelines
 ???? and deadlines

 ?? *

 ???? notify the Organising Committee of the acceptance or rejection of
 ???? papers in a timely manner

 ?? *

 ???? provide adequate feedback to be forwarded to authors

 ?? *

 ???? plan the arrangement of papers and chairs in their panel in
 ???? collaboration with the Organising Committee. No panel may run for
 ???? more than four sessions of 90 minutes.

While it is recognised that the content of any panel is dependent upon 
the selected papers and their overall quality, the Academic Committee 
asks all panel conveners to take due consideration of gender and 
diversity balance in their panel sessions.

Please note that in the case of similar or overlapping panel 
submissions, the Academic Committee may ask panel conveners to 
collaborate in leading consolidated panels to ensure the overall 
coherence of the conference.

We look forward to seeing you in Vienna in 2020!

Martin Gaenszle and Birgit Kellner (Conveners) and Danuta Stasik (EASAS 
President)
