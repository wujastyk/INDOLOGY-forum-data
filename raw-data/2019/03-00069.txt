Subject: [INDOLOGY] An Initial
Message-ID: <CAETY2G2hDb+Tv2hGqBpm1DT29sYcn6+p_d0RY5bd3gO11CbmZw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am hoping that someone might be able to help me with the reading of the
first initial found in the image below. I would like this to be the
autograph of Pu. R?. Puru?ottama N?ya?u, a renowned ?r?-Vai??ava scholar,
but I find it difficult to see a P or a B (as it is sometimes given) in the
letter as written. The date, 10/4/(19)28 falls comfortably within his
lifespan (1901-1976).

Many Thanks,

Victor

P.S. Please let me know if the image has not come through.
