Dear colleagues,

A point of clarification: would the same document ever use both a "halant
variant" of a letter (e.g., the final n of the Kannada script) and the
standard variant followed by a vir?ma sign? I'm asking because my instinct
would be to simply represent the halant variant of a consonant C as C? (or
whatever sign you're using for the vir?ma). It's true that the final form
of the letter in Kannada doesn't "look like" a regular n with a vir?ma, but
then again the letter kh doesn't look like k + h.

I'm sure D?niel knows of it, but in case others don't, an article that Arlo
co-authored with Bob Hudson, Marc Miyake and Julian Wheatley (BEFEO 103
[2017]: 43?205) includes a discussion of adapting the ISO-15919 standards
for Pyu, according to which ?V is used for an independent vowel sign and ?
is used for the vir?ma. I have been using these conventions for diplomatic
transcription. I don't have a strong argument for or against uppercase
letters in transliteration, but here are two weak arguments against it: (1)
uppercase letters are more likely to cause problems in any automated
processing (e.g., replacements or transliteration) especially in
mixed-language text; (2) people sometimes use Western capitalization style
for transliterated text, and even though the use of this style (e.g., in
lists of bibliographic references) will almost never overlap with the
epigraphic and codicological applications D?niel has in mind, we might want
to avoid certain letters changing their meaning across use-cases. For what
it's worth, I often have text in ISO-15919 that I feed into Sanscript to be
transliterated into Indic scripts, and I always downcase the text before
applying the transliteration.
