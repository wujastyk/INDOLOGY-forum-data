Dear Colleagues,

I am writing about  Catholic and Protestant responses to Hindu sacrifice in the colonial period.

Could anyone supply me withe Will Sweetman?s book, Reading Jesuits Reading Hinduism, and his book on Hinduism in the colonial period?

I am also trying to recall a book I think by someone with the surname Ward which I recall as a pertinent diatribe agains Hindu sacrifices. Does anyone know it?

For comparative purpose I am also interested to know of studies of Jain and Buddhist funerary practices in the colonial period.

Please excuse the fishing trip sound of these requests. Anything about colonial period responses to Hindu polytheism generally would be most appreciated.

Best regards,
Alf
