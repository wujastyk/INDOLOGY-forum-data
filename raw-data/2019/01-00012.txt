I do not necessarily disagree with the belief that P??ini lived before the invasions by Alexander, but like to recall that this was not Pata?jali's opinion. Pata?jali appears to have believed that P??ini lived under the Mauryas. Few modern scholars seem to take this seriously, I do not know why. (See, e.g., Harry Falk, ?Von G?tterfiguren und menschlichen G?ttern.? in: Festschrift Klaus Bruhn, ed. N. Balbir & J. K. Bautze, Reinbek 1994, pp. 326-327.)

I am wondering if there are any publications that provide a record of Indic vocabulary in Persian, Aramaic, Bactrian and Greek records that give us a linguistic snapshot of the period around P??ini.  He is believed to be contemporary with the pre-Mauryan Nanda dynasty and so belonging to a period prior to the invasions by Alexander.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.
