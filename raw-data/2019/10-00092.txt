As the attached document shows, this kind of image has the particularity to gather side by side ascetics (mostly, but not exclusively, celibate male ones) belonging to different spiritual lineage such as ??iva, Vai??ava, but also Buddhist, Jain or Sikh. The numerous variants, I have been able to collect, differ both in the numbers of ascetics represented (42, 46, 51, 52, sometimes more), as well as their identity. Nevertheless, considering the great majority of Bengali gurus represented in each picture, it seems likely to be a regional phenomenon.

Does any of you know of some old versions (before the photo area) of such representation which the authors of this type of image could draw their inspiration from ?
