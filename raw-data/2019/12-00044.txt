Subject: [INDOLOGY] Problem with indology list
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o9XLwuzB_6T=g+TvnPvMLbe+e+WioET0oexp9on9PfMKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

It looks like some messages sent to the Indology list don't come through to
me.  For example: there are two messages from Manu Francis that are
archived from early this morning but I didn't receive them.  Does anyone
else have this problem?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
