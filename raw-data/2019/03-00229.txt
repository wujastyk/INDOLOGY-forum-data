HOWEVER, if we accept the verse without emendation, should not we read it
in the way the author KNEW that 99 percent of his contemporaneous readers
would read it?


The verse you quoted:



janmalagnapatir uttamav?ryo yadg?he janu?i tatra ca d???e |
tena v? *sahita asya* ca labdhis tad yath??gasukham abdatanau sy?t ||

The translation you proposed (I supply the words on which each part is
based, if I understand your analysis and interpretation correctly):

***

As the meaning is quite technical, I give my translation:

'If the house in which (yadg?he) the ruler of the ascendant of the nativity
(janmalagnapatir) is [placed] with excellent strength (uttamav?ryo) in the
nativity is aspected (tatra ... d???e) or (v?) joined by that [ruler] (tena
... *sahite*), [there is] attainment (labdhis) of [the matter signified by]
that [house] (asya): for example (tad yath?), [if it is placed] in the
ascendant of the year (abdatanau), there will be (sy?t) be pleasures of the
body (a?gasukham).'

***



Now, reading the verse ? if specialists familiar with the text agree there
is no reason to propose any ad hoc emendation ? with similar conceptual
interpretations BUT in the way the author KNEW that 99 percent of his
contemporaneous readers would read it (and paying more attention to the two
*ca*?s, and letting both *tatra* and *tena* refer anaphorically to *yadg**?*
*he*) we get something that perhaps amounts to the same but is based on a
different *anvaya*... :



If in a house *(yadg?he)* in a nativity (janu?i) the ruler of the ascendant
of the nativity (janmalagnapatir) is having excellent strength, *and* *[ca,
extending the noun phrase] *is there *(tatra)* [in that house, positively]
aspected, or if [the ruler...] is (if not placed in that house, at least)
joined (*sahita**[?]*) with it *(tena)* [with the house], then *also [ca,
perhaps referring to a statement in a previous verse, other conditions
favouring labdhis?]* [there is] attainment of [the matter signified by]
that [house] (asya): for example (tad yath?), [if it is placed] in the
ascendant of the year (abdatanau), there will be (sy?t) pleasures of the
body (a?gasukham).


Bottom line: the use of square (and round) brackets is very much required
when analysing Sanskrit especially in scientific or philosophical arguments
-- as in the publication by Vincent Eltschinger, John Taber, Michael
Torsten Much, Isabelle Rati? on *Dharmak?rti?s Theory of Exclusion* recently
announced for "those among you who are still happy with square brackets".


Best,

Jan Houben
