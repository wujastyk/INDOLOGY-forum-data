Dear Nagaraj,

I do mention in my paper that high tin bronze mirrors were made in India already in the Indus Civilization, and that the technique was known in South India in early first millennium BCE.  But the complete absence of any reference to mirrors in the Sa?hit?, Br?hma?a, ?ra?yaka and ?rautas?tra literature (excepting the Upani?ads later added to the ?B and the ?gvedic ?ra?yakas and the late K?S) very strongly suggests that the mirror was not know in early Vedic times in North India.

With best regards, ?Asok"

On lexical grounds, I had earlier concluded that some parts of the Ch.U. are post-Buddhist, particularly the eighth book, which most interestingly, in the light of your conclusions, also concerns mirrors. It now seems clear (as a mirror!) that a revision of dating is warranted.

> The major first part of the paper collects as exhaustively as possible all mentions of words for ?mirror? occuring in Vedic literature (c.1200?300 bce). The occurrences are presented with sufficient context in Sanskrit and English in order to show how and why the mirror was used in Vedic rituals and Vedic culture in general, and what meaning was ascribed to it. The second part of the paper discusses a fact of major significance that emerges from this documentation: in the extensive older Vedic literature of the Sa?hit?s, Br?hma?as, ?ra?yakas and ?rautas?tras (excepting the late K?ty?yana-?rautas?tra), there is no reference to the mirror at all. This suggests that the mirror was not known in Vedic India until it was introduced to South Asia by the Persian Empire at the end of the sixth century bce. The later Vedic literature, starting with the early Upani?ads and comprising also the G?hyas?tras and K?ty?yana-?rautas?tra, would therefore postdate 500 bce. In other words, the ?mirror? words seem to offer a criterion that for the first time enables a division of the Vedic literature into two clearly separate phases of development. Equally important is the firm historical basis that the mirror provides for dating the transition point.
