Dear Megh Ji,

     Thanks for letting me know the difficulties.  I also searched the
website (www.knaw.nl) and have not yet located my publication.  I received
the printed copies today, and the printed copy directs one to this website
for a pdf.  It is possible that they have not yet uploaded the pdf on their
website.   I just saw the letter that came with the printed copies and it
says: "We will start to distribute them on 22 November 2019 (the day of the
27th Gonda Lecture."  So it seems possible that the pdf of my lecture will
show up on that date.  Thanks for your patience.  Will keep you posted.
