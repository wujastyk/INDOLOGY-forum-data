yes, I do remember this very well (this is, indeed, how Noudou?s note about Thakkana in the R?jatara?gi?? connects to the available textual data concerning Candranandana). Well? I guess *sthagana- still remains a possibility.

best,

Given that, for example,?sgrib cing is an attested rendering of Skt sthagita- (p. 724 in Lokesh Chandra?s Skt-Tib Dictionary), Roland?s suggestion to connect ?sgrib?with ?sthag?and to assume an intermediate step ? that is, Sthagana, a?Sanskritized form of Thakkana ? appears very likely.

(and in many other scripts) kka->ku is easier than ga-> ku, and because a corruption of a ?meaningless? non-Sanskrit form is much easier to explain than a corruption of a ?meaningless? Sanskrit one. Anyway, I hope that we will be able to consult Sanskrit MSS soon.

Are there any Tibetan lists of Indian rulers or personal names in general? Could one think of any plausible explanation for this translation given that the original could have read smth. like ?Thakkana/ ?akuna??
