Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vishwakarma Craftsmen
Message-ID: <CAOYD-QDDZ9OQ=WEmKW3rdCEHv=oavMK8_PBXUa5PJ6c7CSHoiA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I am wondering if anyone has access the following article:
Ramaswamy, Vijaya. "Vishwakarma Craftsmen in Early Medieval Peninsular
India", in: *Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient*,
vol. 47, n. 4 (2004), pp. 548-582.

It seems to be available on JSTOR, but at the institution I can visit at
the moment I have no access to most of the contents of JSTOR, hence my
query on this list.

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
