Dear list members,

Another question about verse 3 dev?-s?ktam .

kaly??yai pra?at?m v?ddhyai siddhyai k?rmyai namo nama?

nair?tyai bh?bh?t?? lak?myai ?arv??yai te namo nama?


I've seen two very different translations of the phrase  nair?tyai
bh?bh?t?? lak?myai in the verse.  Different interpretations of   nair?t?,
one as bad fortune (  alak?m?) and one as an epithet of Durg?.

1. To the One who is good fortune ( lak?m?)  and bad fortune (  alak?m?
) to kings.

2. To the Goddess Nair?t? (epithet of Durga)  who is auspicuous to kings.

Are both these interpretations of nair?t? possible.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
