Dear Alakendu,

If you are mostly interested in the relationship between Sanskrit and
Greek, then may I also recommend an introduction to Indo-European
philology? James Clackson's 'Indo-European Linguistics' is excellent and
very readable; Ben Fortson's 'Indo-European Language and Culture', as the
title suggests, also covers some of the cultural aspects you mention being
interested in. Personally, when it comes to understanding language
relationships, I also rather like Anthony Fox' 'Linguistic Reconstruction'.
These are just a few of the books available on these subjects.

Given you say you may go back 'beginning with as early as Sir William
Jones', just a brief note: William Jones, although a very famous
participant in this debate, was far from the earliest. The first European
missionaries who came to India and were able to learn Sanskrit realised
right away that it must be related to Latin and Greek (many sources make
that clear, the earliest western grammar of Sanskrit by Father Heinrich
Roth SJ from the 1660s among them). William Jones was, however, the first
to suggest (at least in writing) that the common source of those
languages 'perhaps
no longer exists' (his words in 1786); in other words, he suggested that,
against earlier beliefs, the relationship between these languages was not
that the western languages derive from Sanskrit, but that they all came
from a common source and are thus sisters or cousins. That of course is the
view that has been confirmed by philologists/linguists since then.

I hope the above is relevant to what you are looking into!

All the very best,
      Antonia
