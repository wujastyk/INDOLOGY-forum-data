*Announcement for the 2019 CTSS.*

This year, unlike the preceding years, the CTSS (Classical Tamil Summer 
Seminar) will not take place in Pondicherry, but will take place in 
Hamburg, from 2^nd to 13^th September.

This will be an experiment not only with respect to the place: the 
Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC) has just set up a 
programme for Summer/Winter Schools, and the CTSS will be the first to 
explore the new scheme: participants still have to pay for their travel 
(although there is a possibility of applying for financial support), but 
(simple) student accommodation will be provided by the organiser.

The overall plan is to have the CTSS mobile and alternating between 
several locations, namely, besides our beloved Pondy and the CSMC,
also, possibly, the Paris Centre of the University of Chicago.

The text chosen for advanced reading is one canto from the venerable 
/Cilappatik?ram/, the first long Tamil epic poem of perhaps the 5^th 
century.

We are, however, not going to follow the story line, but concentrate on 
canto XII, devoted to Ko??avai, the Tamil goddess of the battle field -? 
the only literary testimony of /dev?/ worship in the whole of the first 
millennium and notoriously difficult.

Luckily it is accompanied not only by the old /arumpatavurai/, but also 
by the commentary of A?iy?rkkunall?r, and moreover some intriguing 
parallels are found both in the /Pu?an????u/ and the /Pu?apporu? 
V??p?m?lai/.

This year there will not be a beginner?s group.

The details will very soon be found online on the page of the CSMC -- 
please express your wish for participation by email before the end of 
May to:

Please don't hesitate to forward this mail to others who might be 
interested.
