Subject: [INDOLOGY] Proceedings of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference
Message-ID: <66372644-6CD4-4A74-9B35-903F11FA5FC0@gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues:

One year ago, from July 9-13, 2018, the 17th World Sanskrit Conference was held in Vancouver, Canada,  with more than 600 delegates attending from all over the world. The Organizing Committee, staff, students, and volunteers here at UBC continue to cherish the warm memories of your visit to our university during that beautiful week!  

In honour of this anniversary, we are pleased to announce the launch of our remodeled WSC2018 website: https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca. 
New features include: (a) the online Proceedings of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference, and (b) featured media content. 

The Proceedings of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference may be accessed through the following URL: https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/proceedings. 

The WSC Proceedings are being published in an online-only format through the UBC Circle digital repository, which is providing academic indexing and metadata services. Papers will be published on a rolling basis as PDFs housed in perpetuity on the servers of the UBC Library. They will be freely available to read and download. 

The Proceedings may be accessed either through the WSC website above, or directly through UBC's Open Collections: https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/70440. They will also appear on Google Scholar and other databases.

The first release includes select papers from Sections 1-5, featuring a collected volume of peer-reviewed papers from Section 5 (Pur??ic Studies), edited by Raj Balkaran and McComas Taylor. More papers will be added to the repository as they are approved by the Section Convenors and processed for publication, so please check back regularly for updates! 

NOTE to WSC2018 Presenters: For each Section of the WSC, the respective Convenors have set the policies and deadlines for soliciting, reviewing, and accepting papers for publication. So if you had presented a paper at the 17th WSC, and wish to submit it in consideration for publication in the Proceedings, please contact your Section Convenors for further guidance. 

If you have published your WSC paper elsewhere, we ask that you send us a bibliographical reference to the WSC2018 Secretariat (wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca), as well as a link to the paper, if possible, so that we may help readers access your publication. 
 
With best wishes, on behalf of the WSC2018 Organizing Committee,

Adheesh
