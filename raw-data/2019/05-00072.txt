Dear colleagues,

 

Within a new research project at the University of Vienna (Buddhist Kanjur
Collections in Tibet?s Southern and Western Borderlands, headed by Helmut
Tauscher, joined by Bruno Lain? and Markus Viehbeck) our online database
Resources for Kanjur & Tanjur Studies (rKTs) received a substantial makeover
and now comes with many new features:

https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sub/index.php

 

Resources for Kanjur & Tanjur Studies now provides access to searchable
catalogues as well as images of over 50 (!) Kanjurs, larger canonical
collections, Tanjurs, and tantric collections (rnying rgyud); further also
various options to search in e-texts for both Kanjur and Tanjur.

While various tools and resources were integrated (handlists of individual
collections, a tool for structural comparison of different collections, a
growing database of secondary literature, Open-Access to our research
publications), the most pressing functions for anyone working with Tibetan
canonical literature might be the following three:

1)      Search for a title of any canonical text. Advanced search allows for
adjusting the level of accuracy and hence to also include title variants:
https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/verif/

The output will provide the bibliographic details of a specific text in a
given edition as well as a direct link to the source material, including for
example dual display of both manuscript images and e-text. Other features
include a link to the English translation in case a text has been translated
by 84.000 and an interface to share scholarly comments and notes (at the
bottom of the results? page).

2)      Full text search in different e-text versions of both Kanjur and
Tanjur. This allows for identifying any part of a canonical text, such as
quotations. Also here the search mode can be adjusted to the specific needs
(approximate search, searching for individual lexical units):
https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/ekanjur/

3)      Direct access to manuscript images. Kanjur viewer, Tanjur viewer,
and Rnying rgyud viewer (accessible in the left menu, under Archives)
combine catalogue data and images and allow for browsing through the images
of many canonical collections:
https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/digit/affiche00.php?collc=hemis
he%7C%27dul+ba+ka%7C1

 

Given the scope of the archive and the fact that it emerged out of various,
shifting research interests, some of the data is still in a provisional
stage and will have to be revised over time. We hope however that already at
the present stage the database will be of benefit for many Tibetologists,
Indologists, and researchers on Buddhism.

In case you encounter technical problems with the database, please inform
Bruno Lain?, the webmaster of the archive, at: bruno.laine at univie.ac.at
<mailto:bruno.laine at univie.ac.at> .

This archive has become possible through the cooperation of many different
individuals. In that spirit we are looking forward to receiving your input
and feedback, notes on interesting manuscript collections, discussions on
specific scholarly concerns, etc. In order to do so, please contact Helmut
Tauscher (helmut.tauscher at univie.ac.at <mailto:helmut.tauscher at univie.ac.at>
) or myself (markus.viehbeck at univie.ac.at
<mailto:markus.viehbeck at univie.ac.at> ).
