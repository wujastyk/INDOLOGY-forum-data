Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question: anokaha
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzf5fD85GVEo0pOTgXP-xuBwG49BaW8XXJ--H7KBicpfZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

     In K?lid?sa's Raghuva??a 2.13, the word *anokaha* is used in the sense
of a tree.  Mallin?tha simply paraphrases *anokaha *with *vr?k?a*.  Has
anyone seen an explanation of this word as to its constituents and
etymology?  Best regards,
