Directly or indirectly relevant may be the cpds of the type *men**?menam,
dhur**?dhuram*, as well as those of the type *ke**??ke**?i, kac**?kaci* :
see the discussion, including references to AA 5.4.127, AA 2.2.27 (assumed
to be of a larger scope than AA 5.4.127), discussions by Wackernagel, Caland,
Hoffmann, in Henk Bodewitz, "The 'marriage' of Heaven and Earth" WZKS 26
(1982): 23-36, esp. pp. 28ff, 32ff.
