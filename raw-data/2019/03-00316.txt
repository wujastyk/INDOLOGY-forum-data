Dear Harry,


This takes us back to an old thread, but I just recalled a good section on the topic in H. Daniel Smith,

A Sourcebook of VaiSNava Iconography (Madras 1969), ch. 8, "Decorations, weapons and instruments of worship).


best,

Matthew

Dear list members,

Would anyhow have or be able to point to articles or lists of names and descriptions of weapons in sanskrit.  In particular names and descriptions of   weapons  described as being held in the hands of gods and goddesses .in the different stotras and descriptions of those deities.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
