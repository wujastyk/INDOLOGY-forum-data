David,

Most likely W. Norman Brown?s student who taught Gerald Larson at Columbia was Royal W. Weiiler.

Freed from teaching duties, day after day for twelve years he worked persistently on a new translation of V?caspati-mi?ra?s Tattva-vai??rad? commentary on the Yoga-s?tra and bh??ya. He regarded this commentary as crucial for understanding the S??khya-Yoga tradition, and he felt that the two old translations of it (by R?ma Pras?da, 1910, and by James Haughton Woods, 1914) needed to be updated. His translation was published in 2018 as Classical Yoga Philosophy and the Legacy of S??khya, with Sanskrit Text and English Translation of P?ta?jala Yogas?tra-s, Vy?sa Bh??ya and Tattvavai??rad? of V?caspatimi?ra. The fact that so many scholars die with their work unfinished did not deter him, and what he accomplished after retirement is an inspiration to us all.

He and his longtime mentor Ram Shankar Bhattacharya together produced two volumes of the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Volume 4. S??khya: A Dualist Tradition in Indian Philosophy (1987); and Volume 12. Yoga: India's Philosophy of Meditation (2008). For many years he taught classes on S??khya and Yoga combined, attracting hundreds of students (including myself) by the word Yoga, and then introducing them to S??khya as the underlying philosophical basis of Yoga.

My first-year Sanskrit class at University of California, Santa Barbara, taught by Nandini Iyer, consisted of mostly former students of the Maharishi International University (this was in 1978). They were strongly interested in the Vedas, and implored Gerald Larson to teach Vedic Sanskrit. Although this was not his personal interest, he kindly agreed to do so. He had studied it briefly at Columbia University, I think from a pupil of Vedic specialist W. Norman Brown. Despite not being particularly interested in it, he not only agreed to do it, but the enthusiasm that he brought to it in order to help his students was memorable.
