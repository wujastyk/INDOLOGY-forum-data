With regard to this important topic, participants and onlookers might note what is occurring in related disciplines. See, for example, "Advancing Feminism Online: Online Tools, Visibility, and Women in Classics", recently published in the journal "Studies in Late Antiquity" (abstract http://sla.ucpress.edu/content/3/1/4.full.pdf+html ).
