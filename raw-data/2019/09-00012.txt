Subject: [INDOLOGY] A manuscript written in unknown scripts
Message-ID: <CAEB3J_7Tgf-WuRJUjiQ-C=F1_WftYU4otJV0gJYyAHHyWgaemQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List members,

Recently I have received some pictures of a manuscript from my professor,
but I do not know the script. I would appreciate it if anyone could kindly
help to decipher both the script and the content.
