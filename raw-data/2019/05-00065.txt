Dear Valerie and Matthew,

If you go to the online THL Tibetan to English Translation Tool and enter nges par ?byung it will spit out:

JH-ENG 	definitely emerge/arise
JH-OE, IW, RY 	going forth
JH-OE 	{C}*; goes forth; go forth
JH-T 	'byung 'byung byung byung
JH-SKT 	{C,MV}niryANa; (nir _/yA): {C,MSA,MV}niryAti; {C}niryAyanAya; {MSA}niHsRti

Bernhard) and the Tibetan must be different in this chapter. Considering that this comes from a long series of verses repeated with only one or two words changed each time, it is easy to see how this could happen.

The latter practice can be in some cases misleading, as it is here. The most authoritative Tibetan-Tibetan dictionary (the Tshigs mdzod chen mo, p. 658), for instance, defines nges par 'byung in this way:
>> "it is the attitude that is desirous of freedom from the imprisonment of saMsAra and of arriving at the happiness of nirvANa..." I do not think that this is very well conveyed by "definite emergence."

>> Dear Friends
>> 
>> Following my previous enquiry about Rockhill?s translation of the Tibetan Ud?navarga, I now have Gareth Sparham?s rather more recent version, The Tibetan Dhammapada: Sayings of the Buddha. Needless to say, it is quite free of stray spiders. However as an indologist who doesn?t read Tibetan, I find many of his translations of Buddhist terminology  idiosyncratic, to say the least. E.g. the equivalent of apram?da is translated as ?caution? (ch. 1 passim), sam?dhi apparently as ?stabilization? (13.8 of the Sanskrit Ud?na, 13.6 of Sparham?s version, which seems to put several verses together earlier in the chapter). A particularly puzzling one is ?definite emergence? in Sparham?s 15.26, referring to some meditation state - possibly for bh?van? in the Sanskrit, though there seems to be a big difference in word order here.

>> Do these translation choices reflect anything in the Tibetan, or is the translator simply trying to get away from earlier translations he regards as hackneyed? I would be very grateful for any insights.
