Hi Harry,

No, I think these are passages relegated from the Critical Edition to appendices or they are star passages included in the critical notes below each verse, passages that are important enough not to be placed in the critical text, but too important not to be noted.

At the beginning of each chapter of the printed edition there is given the number of four other editions including the Bombay, Calcutta and the Kumbakonam (Southern) editions.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,

Greg

Thank you Greg,

In the GRETIL on-line version some lines have references like this:
03,163.039b*0839_01

Are the numbers after the asterix the Calcutta edition line numbers?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Actually the printed edition of the BORI edition does include the equivalent numbers of the Calcutta edition.

Thank you Mahdav,

I just realized that also :-)

Would anyone know a link to a pdf of the Calcutta edition.

Thanks,

If I am not mistaken, B-R refer to the Calcutta edition of the Mah?bh?rata that predates the BORI critical edition. Tokunaga's version is the digitization of the BORI edition.

Dear list members,

I'm trying to trace some Mahabharata references in  B?htlingk and Roth but i"m not clear how to translate their referencing format to whats in the GRETIL edition from Muneo Tokunaga revised by John Smith. The B-R references are a digit (book number?) followed by a 5 digit number. For example, in B-R a Mahabharata reference is 3, 16461 but there is no 03,164.061 in the Tokunaga edition.

Any help in how to translate the B-R references to the Tokunaga verse numbering system would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
