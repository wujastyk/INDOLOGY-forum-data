Martin, have you consulted the old collections of Tamil Proverbs by Jensen and Percival.  Many proverbs therein mention ?ani/Saturn, but looking quickly I do not see the one you mention.

They are available from Google Books and Archive.org.

Best,
Tim

Thank you for this -- but no, there was no implicit question intended: I
was simply interested in having the existence of this expression
confirmed and learning how widespread it might be.

Best wishes,
Martin G.

If the implicit question is whether there are in the 21st century
people in Tamil Nadu who believe in the influence of planets, the
answer is probably yes, but I do not know how this compares with the
same belief in other parts of India or other parts of the world

If the question is whether one can find traces of such beliefs in
ancient Tamil literature, part of the answer might be that the
earliest reference to a list of planet names is seen in the T?v?ram

See the well-known hymn T?v?ram 2:85
which starts with:

???? ??? ???? ??????, ????? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ???? ????,
???? ??? ??????? ????? ???????? ???????, ??? ???? ?????????????---
??????, ???????, ????????, ?????, ???????, ??????, ???, ??????????????, ????
??? ?????; ????????; ??? ????????, ??????????????? ?????.

You can see ??? in the second line

There does not seem to be references to  ??? in the older layer of
Tamil literature (as described in 3 volumes /Index des mots de la
literature tamoule ancienne/ Institut Fran?ais d'Indologie,
Pondich?ry, 1967-1970)

One should also mention (in connection with ???) the well-known temple
described in

https://ta.wikipedia.org/s/puf

I hope this is useful

In an Indian astrological journal from 1963 (/Astrology and Athrishta
/[= /ad???a/] 1.2), I read:

Have we not heard the usual proverb "Aye! that fellow has Saturn in
the tongue? Vakkil-Sani. Ever he predicts evil and never he fails.)

Are any list members familiar with such a proverb/expression? I have
not seen it referred to anywhere else, but then Tamil isn't one of my
languages.

Best wishes,
