It is evident to me that Vikram Chandra has misunderstood the negative
context of the description of P??ini's grammar as a go?pada.  The verse
that I have cited says that P??ini's grammar is a go?pada compared to the
ocean of Indra's grammar.  But he does not cite this verse, and may have
received some second-hand information.
