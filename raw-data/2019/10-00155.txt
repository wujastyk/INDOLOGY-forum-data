Subject: [INDOLOGY] Harivamsha publication announcement


Dear colleagues,



I am happy to announce the following publication:



Simon Brodbeck (trans.), Krishna's Lineage: the Harivamsha of Vy?sa's Mah?bh?rata, Translated from the Sanskrit. New York: Oxford University Press, 2019. Pp. xl + 420. Hardback ISBN 9780190279172; paperback ISBN 9780190279189.



It is a complete translation of P. L. Vaidya's critically reconstituted version (Poona, 1969).

There are further details on the publisher's website here:

https://global.oup.com/academic/product/krishnas-lineage-9780190279189?lang=en&cc=gb#<https://global.oup.com/academic/product/krishnas-lineage-9780190279189?lang=en&cc=gb>



The translation and its introduction are aimed at the general reader, so I have also published an article which is essentially a companion piece intended for a scholarly audience, discussing in some depth the edition used, the emendations made, the translation strategies adopted, and a few of the trickier passages:



Simon Brodbeck, "Translating Vaidya's Hariva??a", Asian Literature and Translation 6.1 (2019), pp. 1?187.



Abstract and download of that paper are available here:

With all best wishes,

Simon Brodbeck
