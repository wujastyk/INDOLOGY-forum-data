Subject: [INDOLOGY] EasyUnicode for a Windows computer?
Message-ID: <CAPx9OfJ=dy-xhCx+9g4u7_e_YwkDKy+axpt6zamteYjEQGwqJA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

In addition to James Hartzell's question regarding EasyUnicode for ipad, I
would ask if there is a way to use this keyboard layout on a non-Mac
computer.

Many thanks!
Anya
