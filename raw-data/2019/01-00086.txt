Dear colleagues,

Would anyone happen to have a copy of Paranavitana, S. ?Mah?y?nism in Ceylon?. Ceylon Journal of Sciences II (December 1928-February 1933) pp. 35-71? I can?t find it online at the usual places. SOAS has the journal (offsite), but I am travelling. I can order it through Oxford?s excellent scan and deliver service, but I thought I'd try here first.

All the best,

Jim
