Yes, it is from Sa?g?taratn?kara in the Si?habh?pala'commentary on how
to construct the permutations of the seven notes.

My question is about the use of ablative and na which is used in this
passage  with words which are not numerals. Grammarians give always
examples of this construction only with numerals which can be understood
as "not twenty (far) from one" ie. nineteen.

But here it cannot translated like this (no prast?ra from ??abha)
because in the prast?ra, given in extenso, there are many lines
beginning by ??abha.

Here is the full passage (with, I hope) a correct translation):

  tatra d????nt?rtha? catu?svara? prast?ra? pradar?yate---
Here, for an example the comprehensive extension for four notes is exposed.

  sarigameti p?rva? krama? sa?sth?pya?|
The serie sa, ri, ga, ma is to be at first put down.

  ?a?jasya adhast?t_p?rvasvar?bh?v?t_svaro na sth?pyate|
  ??abhasya tv_adhast?t_tatp?rva? ?a?jo deya?| uparigau
  g??dh?ramadhyamau puro deyau| ava?i??a ??abha?
  pa?c?d_deya?| eva? risagameti dvit?yo bheda?|
Because there is no preceding note below ?a?ja, no note is placed. But
below ??abha, ?a?ja, which precedes it, must be put. G?ndh?ra and
madhyama which are beyond, must be put forward. The remaining ??abha
must be put backward. The second variety is such: ri, sa, ga, ma.

  tata ??abhasya adhast?t_?a?jo deyatven?s?t| sa copary_agre
  vartate| tena ??abh?n_na prast?ra?|
Then, ?a?ja was in the state of being put under ??abha, but it is in
that state at the beginning above. Thus: *"??abh?n_na prast?ra?"*

The prast?ra construction goes like this:

sa ri ga ma
ri sa ga ma
sa ga ri ma
ga sa ri ma
ri sa ga ma
................

So, I am wondering what is this grammatical construction na+ablative and
what is the meaning of the word prast?ra in this sentence which
(obviously?) deny the fact to have two identical lines in the prast?ra
(here the meaning is "comprehensive extension")

Hoping to be clear enough!
