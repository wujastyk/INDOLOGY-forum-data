The reference is found on p. 5 f. of Hahn's introduction:

Naya Raj Pant: /Py?skalena svopaj?am iti prakhy?pitam  
p???ga?itatribhuja? V?ttaratn?karoktaikadvy?dilagakriyaiva/ (?The  
arithmetical triangle, claimed to be his own discovery by Pascal, is  
nothing but the /Ekadvy?dilagakriy?/ as told in the  
/V?ttaratn?kara/?), published in the first volume of /Jayatu  
Sa?sk?tam/, 1:4 Vikramasa?vat 2017 (1960), pp. 1-8, Kathmandu.

Best,
Roland Steiner
