Dear Arlo,


I receive solicitations of this type almost every day and I have found that most emanate ultimately from Chinese sources. Money is not always involved, because the underlying game is to multiply "international refereed" journals in the interest of advancing the standings of one's institution in the Shanghai ratings.


I do not know if that is the case with what was sent to you, of course, but I do advise all colleagues to be very cautious about these matters. Phoney academic venues of various kinds - journals, conferences, even fake universities - are springing up like mushrooms. (It is worth noting that China opens about 5 new universities, more or less real ones, each month.)


best regards,

Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI

Dear colleagues,

I had received a few weeks ago an offer (see below) to help a commercial company called MDPI that publishes an Open Access journal Religions as guest editor for a special issue on an Indological topic. Since I had never heard of publisher nor journal; since I suspected that this is one of those predatory publishers we read about a lot nowadays; and since as a matter of principle I favor publishing in established not-for-profit journals, I decided not to respond. Now the same publisher sends me a gentle reminder, apparently showing that at least it's not a mere machine which has decided to solicit my assistance. This time I did click on one of their links and now see that authors wishing to publish in the journal Religions need to pay an amount of 550 CHF in 'Article Processing Charges' (APC); I don't know whether editors receive any payment for their work, but since no mention of such payment has been made I expect there is none.

I am curious whether others have received such offers, and whether there might be reason not to be as negatively prejudiced as I am. More generally, I wonder how many of you have actually published work and paid APC to get your work published. I have never been asked to do so, and wonder why anyone might feel compelled to do so as long as there are still fine journals which don't ask any such fees and impose very low barriers to access.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
