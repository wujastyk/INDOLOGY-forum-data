I didn't try to download anything; I merely wanted to check that it was indeed still up and running. On checking again just now, though, I can't find it. D???a? vina??am atilolam al?tacakram...

>> This website, that hosted digital scans of many manuscripts and early editions, has now disappeared, as of December last year.   Some of the site is preserved at Archive.org <https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.indianmanuscripts.com/>, but the scans are not downloadable as far as I can see.  The site was created by a Mr Madan Mohan Gupta.  I am guessing, but I think the resource might be associated with Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, or the Bishno Mandir in Hisar, Haryana.
