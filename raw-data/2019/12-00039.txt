Dear Oliver,

It is certainly possible to release the raw data and if it will assist research into j?taka texts and art then we are happy to organise this. However, it might be best to wait at least six months, since there will be some additions and updates to the database during this time. You will need to be SQL literate though and be able to perform queries in an SQL database. It might be best if you contact naomi.appleton at ed.ac.uk in due course to arrange this.

Best regards,
Chris

Hi Chris,

thanks for sharing this, it's a really great resource.
Do you consider to release the source data at some point in the future?
They could be highly interesting for all kinds of computational
research, especially since there is so much (manually annotated?)
information linking individual text passages, and text passages with
their translations.

Best, Oliver
