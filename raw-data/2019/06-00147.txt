Subject: [INDOLOGY] Three doctoral positions in Southeast Asian epigraphy and history for DHARMA project
Message-ID: <AM0PR09MB358749FAB5D2AE6BA7776B46A5E50@AM0PR09MB3587.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Dear colleagues,

The EFEO is soliciting applications for three doctoral positions in Southeast Asian epigraphy and history: one for Cambodia, one for Camp? and one for Java. In all cases, knowledge of Sanskrit is a great plus.

The French announcement is available here: <https://www.efeo.fr/uploads/docs/pdf_presentation/PhD-Candidates-DHARMA-EFEO_FR.pdf>. I am attaching the English equivalent.

Please forward to colleagues in the relevant fields, and to any potentially interested students.

Thank you.

Arlo Griffiths
