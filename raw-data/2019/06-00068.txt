Dear Listmembers,

on archive.org I found all volumes of LeCoq's /Sp?tantike/, but vol. 4 
is missing.

Anyone can share with me a pdf of this volume 4?

LeCoq, /Die Buddhistische Sp?tantike in Mittelasien/, 4. Teil (1924/25?).

There is no more copyright.

You can also send easy with /wetransfer.com/, if there are any problems 
with your email-account regarding the size of attached pdfs.

Best regards

Heiner
