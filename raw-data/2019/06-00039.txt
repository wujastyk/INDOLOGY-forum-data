Dear Artur, there is an article about the difference in pronunciation of -k- and -kk- by Leigh Lisker. But at the moment I can't remember the title of the article and where is was published. I hope someone else can help you with the details.

Dear Friends,

allow me to ask several questions, re pronunciation of Tamil.

The first of them:

Tamil ?????????????  - is transliterated as T?vukk???am. Is it formally pronounced as Tivukkuttam - or as Tivukuttam?

Dear Artur,

The Tamil script does not have letters for the voiced plosives (and no aspirates). For that it uses the corresponding voiceless plosives. After a nasal and between vowels k is pronounced  g: a?ku "there" is pronounces a?gu, ?ku "to become", ?gu or ?hu. Word-initial k is pronounced k, as in k?tal "love". So is double kk, as in the infinitive k?kka "to protect". This phenomenon used to be known by the expression "convertibility of surds and sonants".
The "official" transcription is a?ku, ?ku, k?tal, k?kka. There is an unofficial transcription used in English language publications. For instance, k?tali, " a lovely girl", is transcribed as kathali as well as kadhali.
In our youngest son's class in primary school there was a girl from Surinam called vasutha, that is, via vasut?, from Skt vasudh?.
