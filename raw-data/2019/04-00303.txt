 Dear Patrick,
 This is an enormous shock. Gerry and I
 just corresponded a few days ago. ?He contributed to my
 volume on reincarnation earlier this year.?
 This is an immeasurable loss both to
 his friends and loved ones and to the academy. ?
 In shared sorrow,Jeffery Long?

 Dear Patrick:
 ??? I am so very sad to
 learn about this. Gerry was a mentor and friend since I was
 a graduate student in the early 90s. He was one of the
 foundations and founding members of the discipline. 
 ??? Here?s to hoping
 that his purusa is in kaivalya.

 Dear Scholars,
 I am looking for missing pages of
 Nanarthasangraha of Ajayapala from pages
 97 onwards.
 https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.491316/page/n109
 has data
 till sakAra, and thereafter the next
 two pages are blank in scan. The next
 data is of kSakAra.
 The data about hakArAdi words are
 missing in the scan.
 If any of you would be able to provide
 those missing pages, I would be
 obliged.
