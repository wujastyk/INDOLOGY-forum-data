Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vocatives of goddesses names in tantric texts (was NGMCP descriptive catalogue)

Dear Harry,

These forms could just be scribal mistakes or, at best, irregular spellings. I often encounter vocatives for the goddess ending in long ? (e.g., dev?) in manuscripts of yoga texts that were not composed in ai?a. I can send further references if you need examples.

Best wishes,

Jason
