I am happy Camillo mentioned Kalidasa. I would like to add  3 books.

Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa

A book which which really tells about Indian Culture.

Champu Ramayana of Bhoja.


 Kadambari of Bana Bhatta.



These are the 3 books which even if the same authors, try to write a
similar work would  fail.
