Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have access to the CE of the R?m?ya?a as a single WORD document or PDF, or at least by its k???as in one of these formats?

The versions I am finding online tend to be by sarga, and I would like to search for some specific phrases across large portions of the text.

Best Wishes,
