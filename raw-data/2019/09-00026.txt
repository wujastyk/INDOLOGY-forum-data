Indeed,
it would indeed be very nice to know more. I have collected biodata of Indologists since the early 1980s, but with Moreshwar Ramchandra Kale (More?var R?mcandra K?le) I have found next to nothing. He was B.A. and living in Girgaon, Bombay in 1911 and was still there in 1926. In 1966 he was styled the late. His son, V. M. Kale (I don?t have the full name) was procuring new editions of his father?s works already in the 1920s and apparently continued this until the 1970s).

Best,
Klaus

Dear all
I am aware that few people are searching for the biographical details of MR Kale, according to the pointers given by Prof Ashok Aklujkar ji, if anyone could procure any details, then please share.

Thanking you
KP
