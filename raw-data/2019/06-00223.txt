Here is a good quality scan of Thibaut's article on the S?ryapraj?apti that
was referred to:

http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Jaina%20Texts/suryaprajnapti,_on_the,_1880_thibaut.pdf

I have also scanned and posted primary sources on the S?ryapraj?apti. These
are not easy to find, so I list them here:

?r?s?ryapraj?aptyup??gam with commentary by Malayagiri, 1919:

Suryaprajnapti, summarized English translation by R. Shama Sastry,
1925-1928:
