Dear Colleagues,

The WSC2021  second circular is attached and is also available through our website:

We warmly invite all interested scholars to submit abstracts to our regular sections or special panels through the website portal.

Looking forward to hosting you all in Canberra in 2021,

Yours fraternally,

McComas Taylor
