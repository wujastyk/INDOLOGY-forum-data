Dear Herman,





Thanks a lot for this interesting reference. There is of course a tremendous amount of 19th-century European theatre, opera, poetry, painting with oriental themes - it's a very big topic and has been the object of much research. But it is not so much my area,
 though I am interested - I posted the Toulouse-Lautrec to the list just as an amusing curiosity and not in connection with any academic project that I am undertaking.








best regards,

Matthew

Dear Matthew, Some years ago I attended a paper delivered by Emilio Ghezzi, the partner of our colleague Daniela Rossella (University
 of Potenza) on the designs of the stage and costumes of 19th-century operas with oriental themes. Emilio is a composer himself. I do have a tape with music composed by him somewhere but do not have the necessary equipment anymore. It was a fascinating paper
 with many slides of original drawings from the 19th century. I do not know if the paper has already been published, but hope it will.
The most recent email address of Emilio (and Daniela) I have is ghezziem at tin.it.
Best, Herman

Dear Alakendu,





There are several English translations. The best known is perhaps the "Little Clay Cart" of the American Sanskritist Arthur Ryder, first published in 1905.





cordially,

Matthew

Dr.Kapstein,
I rue that I saw this post so late.It's indeed awe-inspiring.! I feel there exists an English version of MrchhaKatikam, namely The Clay Cart.I shall confirm it.

Dear Indologists,





You may find this to be amusing. 







Visiting the huge exhibition of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec currently on view at the Grand Palais in Paris, I was surprised to find, amidst his many posters for theater and cabaret, the one I include here, for a production of the




M?cchaka?ik?, - the title is even given in devanagari at lower right. If you read carefully, you'll see that TL himself is credited with the sets for the fifth act, though I do not know if any trace of these survives, or if it was photographed.
 They must have been wonderful!
