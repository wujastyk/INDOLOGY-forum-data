Dear Jon and Agnes,

The clause you cite automatically appears in any job advertisement in

Thank you for the comment. I apologise, I didn't know that universities to
not follow the rules. I thought that this clause was actually taken into
account. The statement is discriminatory against men, nonetheless, and as
an applicant, I wondered if it was really worth trying. Again, that could
be the whole purpose of the clause. I don?t know. I just felt it was unfair
to men, not to men as a social class, but to particular individuals who may
have nothing to do with structural sexism. If you think that?s not the
case, then we disagree and that is fine.

what?s the problem with ?Given *equal qualifications*, *preference will be
> given to female applicants?*?


The problem is not in this line, but in the previous one, where it
says *non-discriminatory
employment policy*. Will you agree that when preference is given on the
basis of gender, this is a discriminatory statement? Perhaps I got it wrong.

Jon, when I say that a thousand things can be changed I mean they should
be, and I think the debate is positive, including the debate on
discriminatory clauses. I did not mean anything against Audrey, whom I
personally know I respect very much, as a friend and as a scholar.
Apologies if anyone felt offended. I am looking forward to what Audrey has
to say.

Best wishes,
Aleix
