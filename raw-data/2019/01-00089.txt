Dear colleagues,

Many thanks to Jonathan Silk, Rupert Gethin and Christian Wedemeyer for sending me a pdf of the article (which I now see is by S.Paranavitane, not Paranavitana). I have uploaded it here: https://we.tl/t-jsbB2n94Vw

All the best,

Jim

SOAS has the journal (offsite), but I am travelling. I can order it through Oxford?s excellent scan and deliver service, but I thought I'd try here first.
