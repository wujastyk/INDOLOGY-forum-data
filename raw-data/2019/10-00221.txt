Subject: [INDOLOGY] Manuscripts from Nagaur?
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdNxefQQ6dnVV7N+aq=RS7GyfpOru=jDthPYjBPWqArqg@mail.gmail.com>

For many years I have been trying to get a copy of a manuscript from the
Bhattarakiya (Digambar Jain) Granth Bhandar in Nagaur.  Catalogue PDF
<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.348738> (incomplete).  I
never had any answer to letters (in English or Sanskrit).  Does anyone in
this forum have connections with this Nagaur library?

I am also pursuing this enquiry separately through a friend at the
Gyanmandir <http://kobatirth.org/jainlibrary.aspx> in Koba.

Best,
Dominik
