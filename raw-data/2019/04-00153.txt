Subject: [INDOLOGY] Colour symbolism in pre-modern Indic sources; concise overview of the senses
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CcGY4RHKFaqUzX_8JHa3xcTn9pStzO0afsRxvEKFMOgSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Students are asking me for readings for their essays, and I'm slightly
stumped for good suggestions on these two.  Can anyone point to some good
studies of these topics?

I am particularly interested in colour readings in relation to the health
sciences and alchemy, but anything will do!  I know about Martha Selby's
2005 "Narratives of Conception" article and its remarks on red/white
distinctions in ayurveda.

Regarding the senses, I haven't yet checked the Brill encyclopedia, and I
will.  Probably there's something in Dasgupta, Hist. Indi. Philosophy.

Any suggestions will be much appreciated.

Best,
Dominik
