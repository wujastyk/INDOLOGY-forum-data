For Malabarisches Heidenthum :

A German exploration of Indian society :
Ziegenbalg's "Malabarian Heathenism" : an annonated English translation with an introduction and a glossary /
by Daniel Jeyara, Chennai : Mylapore Institute for Indigenous Studies ; 2006.
https://books.google.com?id=jJtOAQAAIAAJ

https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/010592399

It is probably not available on-ine even in the USA.



Dear Colleagues,

Would anyone have .pds of English translations, wherever possible, of
the following publications of Bartholomeus Ziegenbalg: his
Malabarisches Heidenthum and the Genealogie der Malabarischen Gotter,
completed the arly 1700s; and his co-authored Halleschen Berichte. (I
have a copy in English of the Geneology but in Washington and not in
Colombia).

I also still need Louis Dumont?s study of the Pramalai Kallar. Would
anyone have in English or French on a .pdf?

And I am still looking for a .pdf of William Ward?s 1827 A View of the History,
Literature, and Religion of the Hindoos (Serampore: Mission press),
for which any edition on pdf would be great...

Thanks much,
Alf

Dear Colleagues,

I am writing about  Catholic and Protestant responses to Hindu
sacrifice in the colonial period.

Could anyone supply me withe Will Sweetman?s book, Reading Jesuits
Reading Hinduism, and his book on Hinduism in the colonial period?

I am also trying to recall a book I think by someone with the surname
Ward which I recall as a pertinent diatribe agains Hindu sacrifices.
Does anyone know it?

For comparative purpose I am also interested to know of studies of Jain
and Buddhist funerary practices in the colonial period.
