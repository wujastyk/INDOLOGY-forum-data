Dear list,

We would like to draw your attention to the following Call for Papers,
which will end on 25th of May 2019.


We are happy to announce that the 11th International Indology Graduate
Research Symposium (IIGRS) will be hosted at Wolfson College, University of
Oxford, on 1-2 November 2019.

We invite all Indology graduate students as well as early-career
researchers (who have completed their doctoral studies within the past five
years) to submit a paper. The selection committee will consider all papers
dealing with any Indological subject based on the study of texts in their
original language.

If you wish to present a paper, please submit a 300-word abstract
(described below) to iigrsuk at googlemail.com by 25th of May 2019. You will
be notified about the outcome of your application in mid-June.

Abstracts should not exceed 300 words and should include:

1) Your name and institution + indication of research degrees and positions
held.

2) The title of your paper.

3) A broad indication of its subject area.

4) An outline of its contents.

Please send your abstract in both Word and PDF format.

If your abstract is accepted, you will be allotted a slot of no more than
thirty minutes, twenty minutes of which should be devoted to delivering
your paper, and ten minutes for questions and discussion.

The participants should arrange travel and accommodation on their own. To
help with covering travel and accommodation costs, we will provide
*bursaries* *(?75-100 per person)* to be claimed upon submission of
receipts. There will be no conference registration fees.

If you are teaching at an institution, we would be very grateful if you
could circulate this information among your students.

For more details, please visit https://iigrs.wordpress.com/

We will be more than happy to answer any questions sent to the following
email address: iigrsuk at googlemail.com


Best wishes,

IIGRS11 Oxford
