Subject: [INDOLOGY] Joydeep Bagchee's membership to INDOLOGY
Message-ID: <CAOuG4CYrmH3iAmC5pRx8h-HZRzhOb68=doTTV+RV2MDpCFo-wQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Members of INDOLOGY,

The post that Joydeep Bagchee sent to this list on 16 April under the
header ?Re: [INDOLOGY] Response to Shrinivasa Varakhedi? severely violates
the rules for usage of the INDOLOGY list, which state that ?In particular,
personal attacks of an ad-hominem nature, rude language, and off-topic
postings are violations of the list rules. The definition and understanding
of what constitutes improper use of the forum shall be a matter for the
Governing Committee. [...] The Governing Committee may penalize personal
attacks or defamatory speech directed against other list members with a
temporary or permanent removal from the list.? (
http://www.indology.info/email/email-const/).


The above mentioned severe violation of the Guidelines left the INDOLOGY
Governing Committee with no choice but to remove Joydeep Bagchee
permanently from the list.



With best regards,



Philipp Maas



Governing Committee Member on duty
