Dear Colleagues,

I write to share this short blog post
<https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/blog/hidden-murtis-sanskrit-students-radcliffe-college?fbclid=IwAR30WgKVv_ACuTQMXxLB9v3G6aeHFbjtYfV8OkRDG4CappEcTe0CT_pxfuA>,
by Anand Venkatkrishnan, on Radcliffe women who studied with Lanman in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries.

I strongly recommend reading until the end - the final paragraph deserves
your attention.

Audrey Truschke
