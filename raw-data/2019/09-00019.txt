Dear Prof. Kapstein, Dear Prof. Silk,

Thank you for your comments. Unfortunately, I have to close this topic and
delete the photos. Also, I would like to ask anybody who may have
downloaded the photos to delete them. I just realized that the data may
cause some unpredictable problems.

Best regards,
Zhao
