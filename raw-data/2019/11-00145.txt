The late Frits Staal?s Word Order in Sanskrit and Universal Grammar, and his edited volume,A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians, may be useful here.

There is also quite a lot in Cardona, J. and Jain, D., Eds., The Indo Aryan Languages, 2nd Edition, Routledge Taylor and Francis Group, London and New York.

Good luck,
Matthew Kapstein

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit and Linguistics

One might look at the work of Ferdinand de Saussure as a start.  His students compiled his lectures notes into a book (in French), and careful examination of his foundational ideas about semiotics and language suggest (at least to me) that they bear a remarkable resemblance to Bhartrhari's schemas about language. de Saussure was also a professor of Sanskrit.

?Hi all?
A colleague has asked me to recommend scholarship (monograph, essay, review article) that provides an overview on the nexus of Sanskrit, modern linguistics, and/or the philosophy of language. Any recommendations from this list?especially works accessible to the non-specialist?would be much appreciated.

Yours,
