Dear colleagues,

in this regard I only want to bring in some aspects of building up and
enhancing an individual keyboard layout. 

Working on Mac I have set up a layout years ago during my Bachelor
studies with Ukelele. During my Master studies, this got enlarged and
modified while working with Indo-european languages out of the necessity
to display more and more diacritics correctly as well as Unicode-safe.
Now, this grown keyboard layout is mainly based on the Combining
Diacritical Marks block (U+0300..U+036F) together with the simple
letters, keeping it easy and intuitive ? for me and according to my
writing habits ? to create diacritics of almost any kind, also working
perfectly in TextEdit, Pages, and most of the time in XeLaTeX. That is
the big advantage of building a personal layout. One will also get used
to the process of adding glyphs, although at the very beginning it can
and highly possibly will be quite time consuming.

The only disadvantage to this system in my view can be, that there are
different ways to have e.g. an Unicode-safe n? ? one as a single-built ?
U+1E47 (Latin Extended Additional), another as the combined solution n
U+006E (Basic Latin) +  ?U+0323 (Combining Diacritical Marks), a third
based on a command \d{n} in pdfTeX. Afaik, these three won?t be
interpreted as the in fact same sign whilst at first glance looking the
same, but this is also a minor issue regarding word search in a document
either .pdf or raw. Nevertheless, in my view the combining solution
helps creating a broader variety of diacritics.

Best,


Raik Strunz
