Subject: [INDOLOGY] 'catching the ocean in a cow's hoofprint'

He concludes his article thus :

Pata?jali then concludes that this method of individual enumeration,
pratipada-p??ha, is equal to no method at all; instead, *a set of rules*
formulated with the general (s?m?nya) and particular (vi?e?a) in mind would
allow us to understand *the enormity of language* with *little* effort.112
And this is what P??ini did: *with a small set of rules, he captured ? as
the saying goes ? the ocean in a cow?s hoofprint*.

He just says, " as the saying goes "

Antonia-ji is asking for the source of this saying and its Sanskrit
version.
