Dear Friends,

allow me to ask several questions, re pronunciation of Tamil.

The first of them:

Tamil ?????????????  - is transliterated as T?vukk???am. Is it formally
pronounced as Tivu*kk*uttam - or as Tivu*k*uttam?

>> Dear Artur,

>> The Tamil script does not have letters for the voiced plosives (and no
>> aspirates). For that it uses the corresponding voiceless plosives. After a
>> nasal and between vowels k is pronounced  g: a?ku "there" is pronounces
>> a?gu, ?ku "to become", ?gu or ?hu. Word-initial k is pronounced k, as in
>> k?tal "love". So is double kk, as in the infinitive k?kka "to protect".
>> This phenomenon used to be known by the expression "convertibility of surds
>> and sonants".
>> The "official" transcription is a?ku, ?ku, k?tal, k?kka. There is an
>> unofficial transcription used in English language publications. For
>> instance, k?tali, " a lovely girl", is transcribed as kathali as well as
>> kadhali.
>> In our youngest son's class in primary school there was a girl from
>> Surinam called vasutha, that is, via vasut?, from Skt vasudh?.
