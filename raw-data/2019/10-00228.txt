Subject: [INDOLOGY] Eye-copy of an inscription in Paris BnF
Message-ID: <CANVHsm5mh+8KvR7bGzui4oCrzB6hzK0utWMeqHzL-q3iFoDC5A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

In the framework of the TST project (https://tst.hypotheses.org/) I have
started to examine rubbings and eye-copies of inscriptions kept at the BnF
in Paris.

Among these is the item ?Indien 720?, for which we have the following
description: https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc1046846

It appears to be a scale eye-copy of a Sanskrit inscription (which would be
in very big letters if it is indeed a scale reproduction, as the sheet is 200
x 95 mm).
