Just to add a clarification. Unfortunately a VPN won?t help. None of those links leads to a downloadable version of the book, even in N. America. Hathi trust is infamous for making only the slimmest snippets available, claiming copyright restrictions (even institutional access is quite limited), and google only makes books that are no longer under copyright available for download, though it sometimes will post ?preview? versions that delete blocks of pages.
