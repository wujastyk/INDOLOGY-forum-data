Lolajihv? is a common appellation of goddesses with a lolling tongue (K?l?, T?r?...). 

So I would understand this vocative as "[you, who] resemble (anuk?ri?i) [a goddess] with a lolling tongue (lolajihv?)".

In some texts, Lolajihv? is a name of a yogin?, so other option would be "[you, who] look like [a yogin?] Lolajihv?", but I think this is less probable.

Best,
Lubomir
