Dear Adriano,

The issue tends to be diffused through discussions of topics such as anupalabdhi and abhAva, so there is quite a lot inter alia in works on Indian epistemology (e.g., Matilal's Perception). See, for instance, Dhirendra Sharma, EPISTEMOLOGICAL NEGATIVE DIALECTICS OF INDIAN LOGIC ? "ABH?VA" VERSUS "ANUPALABDHI":
https://www.jstor.org/stable/24650177?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

A recent volume that may be helpful to you is:

good luck,
Matthew
