  Dear list members,

  I have been recently told that in the 1950s Helmut Humbach?otherwise
known to most as an eminent Iranianist?took photographs of Sanskrit
fragments from B?miy?n in the Kabul museum. Does anyone know if those
photographs have been published? If not, does anyone know where are those
photographs deposited? Mainz? There should be at least partial overlap with
the documents presented in Sylvain L?vi's "Notes sur les manuscrits
sanscrits provenant de B?miyan et de Gilgit," *Journal Asiatique* 220,
1932.1, p.1 ff.). Given the sad history of the museum, many of these
fragments may be lost; some, I have also been told, ended up in the Sch?yen
collection in Sweden and were returned to the museum a few years ago.
Apparently there are more photos of these MSS, but I would just like to
know about this Humbach set. Any help would be sincerely appreciated!
