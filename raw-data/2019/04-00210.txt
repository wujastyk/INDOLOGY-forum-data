Dear list members,

I am wondering if there are any studies about the Medin?ko?a. To be more
precise, I am purely concerned with the issue of its dating.
I only know of PK Gode's article "Some new evidence for the Date of the
Lexicon Medini -- Between A.D. 1200 and 1275" (New Indian Antiquary VII,
republished in the 1953 volume Studies in Indian Literary History).

I shall be thankful for any reference.

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
