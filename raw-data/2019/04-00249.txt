Subject: [INDOLOGY] Publication details of Anugama in Navya Nyaya
Message-ID: <CAODNnZg7Gyo4-3ap5cqaVF-Nz0_hdCgEz7n8r_Ky-yY8pR5fAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all
I am interested to know is there a book or research papers published by D.C
Guha author of Navya Nyaya system of logic in which he has mentioned about
a separate treatise called Anugama in Navya Nyaya.

Any pointers will be highly appreciated. Kindly help.

Thanks and regards
KP
