I'm having finger trouble today :-}  I meant to say:

I'm looking for variations in the mah?lak?mya??akastotram in popular books
of collections of stotras.

If any members have books of collections of stotras with the
mah?lak?mya??akastotram in it and could scan the page with the hymn  and
the title page and send it to me, I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
