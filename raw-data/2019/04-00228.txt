Subject: [INDOLOGY] Joydeep Bagchee's membership to INDOLOGY

I unreservedly second what Arlo has spoken out in explicit terms.

After all, as its name suggests, the "Indology List" is, and should remain,
a scholarly forum concentrating on research questions pertaining to
cultural aspects of India.
Whoever wants to shift their research activities to Indologists and their
private affairs is kindly invited to subscribe to, or establish an,
independent sociological discussion forum ("Indologists List"), where
methods adequate to the social sciences are mastered and applied. It is
certainly not possible to carry out serious research into the American
academia or to make reasoned statements about them and their institutions
by applying Indological methods, the only ones the great majority on this
list has been trained in. In the absence of proper methodology, all
accusations and lamentations put forward in this forum are nothing but vain
chatter, gossip and insinuation, something we gladly forgo. It engenders
suspicion of hubris when Indologists despite their lack of proper academic
training in the respective fields publicly perform the business of other
disciplines and mime the state prosecutor.

Regards,
WS
