Why then do we have s?rya-nad? instead of s?rya-?ad?,(from Monier-Williams)
?

Similarily also from Monier-Williams: why  s?rya-nak?atra, s?rya-n?r?ya?a,
s?rya-namask?ra, s?rya-netra instead of , s?rya-?ak?atra, s?rya-??r?ya?a,
s?rya-?amask?ra, s?rya-?etra

I've just now seen what Whitney writes: "This rule applies strictly and
especially when the nasal and the cause of its alteration lie within the
limits of the same integral word; but it is extended , within certain
limits, to compound words'.

What does he mean by "[applies] within certain limits to compound words."
Does he mean all compounds not containing  a word from ga?a k?ubhn?di or
are there other restrictions to its application in compounds?

Thanks,
