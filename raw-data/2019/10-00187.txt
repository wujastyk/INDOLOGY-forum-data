Subject: [INDOLOGY] Gonda's History of Indian Literature vols being reprinted in India
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdqYVea2wv7+hN_JhYFSU-XnNQdzqYtpxuOvMwxwBtznQ@mail.gmail.com>

I noticed this morning that Gonda's invaluable HIL vols. are being
reprinted by Manohar.  Go to Manohar's search
<http://www.manoharbooks.com/NewSearch.asp> and search for "History of
Indian Literature" to see the series.  The prices are very reasonable,
though postage out of India will be expensive.

Best,
Dominik
