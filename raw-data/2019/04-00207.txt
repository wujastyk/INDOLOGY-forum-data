Subject: [INDOLOGY] On Adhyash.
Message-ID: <1555334322.S.9674.autosave.drafts.1555335406.13361@webmail.rediffmail.com>

Mr.Riegle,On receipt of your reply to my query on Adhyash,I just wrote a thanks-giving reply yesterday.But I suddenly felt I need to write a little bit more on this.Indeed,"Superimposition",is an all-weather comprehensive transliteration of Adhyash.Adhyash , perhaps is the most appropriate logic with&nbsp; which&nbsp; to approach the entire philosophy of Absolute Monism or Adwaitya (in&nbsp; Sanskrit) .How to explain.&nbsp; the omnipresent ONE&nbsp; from amongst the MANY.Why do we fail to get to the ultimate TRUTH?....because&nbsp; a sheath of falsity is superimposed on the TRUTH,thus preventing us from getting to its root.Why can't we break this barrier or remove the sheath of falsity? ...due to our ignorance or nescience.&nbsp; Alakendu Das.

Dear Alakendu Das,
If you had not written 
that "superimposition" is a translation of adhyash, I would not have 
recognized what word you meant by adhyash. It is always helpful to use 
the standard transliteration for Sanskrit words, in this case adhy?sa;
 or if you do not have access to unicode characters, then adhyaasa or 
adhyAsa would work. 

Already in George Thibaut's 1890 translation of The Ved?nta-s?tras with the Commentary by ?a?kar?c?rya, Part 1, "superimposition" was used for adhy?sa (p. 4, etc.). Swami Gambhirananda, too, in his 1965 translation of Brahma-s?tra-bh??ya of ?r? ?a?kar?c?rya





 used "superimposition" for adhy?sa (p. 2, etc.). This seems to be one of those cases where the English translation of a Sanskrit term, "superimposition" for adhy?sa, is so good that everyone adopted it. I have not taken note of other translations of 
adhy?sa.
However, if a simpler translation is wanted, such as for English-as-a-second-language speakers who may not know the word "superimposition," one could use "false attribution," the definition of
adhy?sa

given in Apte's Sanskrit-English dictionary.
Best regards,

Respected Scholars,
Adhyash happens to be a significant concept in Vedanta philosophy.So far,"Superimposition" is the only word which I came across,as a literal translation of Adhyash in English.Is there any other word ,in the philosophical context,which tantamounts to Adhyash?
