Subject: [INDOLOGY] Anthropology of memory and South Asian studies
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf96MPLe3p9pDGu7Uub3bju+ssxzOTKg=Z2q=O9ng7G0Eg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am writing to ask if you know any study based on and that (also
critically) debate concepts such as "cultural memory", "cultural identity",
"hot memory" and "cold memory" in the light of a South Asian (modern)
religious system.

I know regarding research that are going on and that are studing on the
relationship between Puranic mythology and oral traditions. But I would
like to know if there is something that focuses on the relationship between
"cultural memory" and "cultural identity", ritual and past (in a South
Asian context).

Sincerely,
Paolo
