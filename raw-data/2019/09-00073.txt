Subject: [INDOLOGY] Out-of-body experience in Indian religions

On the Buddhist side, out of body wandering is often associated with nirodha-sam?patti, a high-level meditative condition, which Buddha himself apparently engaged in, in which one?s body is barely distinguishable from a corpse, displaying almost no vital signs. Buddhaghosa?s Visuddhimagga gives various accounts, including ones in which the body, mistaken for dead, is disposed of, so that when the consciousness returns looking for it, it is not there. One can enter nirodha-sam?patti for a short while, or up to several weeks. One supposedly sets in internal timer before entering it, marking the time when one becomes re-animated. The stories he references can be found in earlier sources.

But as Bradley, I think rightly, cautioned, the concept of out-of-body experiences gets complicated in Buddhist context. When Buddha (or others, such as Moggall?na) visit deva realms or hells, etc. or manifest multitudes of alternate bodies elsewhere, etc., there is often (but not always) the presumption that one?s basic body is still in place, perhaps even functioning and performing daily activities. So there are many ways that one can be active and have experiences outside of one?s basic body. One of the ?ddhis, the ?super? powers that advanced practitioners may achieve, includes a ?divine eye? that can see anywhere, not just where one?s body happens to be. Would that also qualify?

This raises the question of whether or not these experiences were literally "out-of-body". The P?li sources I'm familiar with at least typically say the manomaya k?ya is "r?pin", in other words it has form. But I suppose that might well take us into the issue of whether or not terms like "k?ya" and "r?pin" connote PHYSICAL form in these contexts...
