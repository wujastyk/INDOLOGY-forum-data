Subject: [INDOLOGY] Nanarthasangraha Ajayapala
Message-ID: <CADSGPzW3azTKhRyE1ScdhLiWxoD6OVEVBk4V=hnV3Ey5x1FQzw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Scholars,
I am looking for missing pages of Nanarthasangraha of Ajayapala from pages
97 onwards.
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.491316/page/n109 has data
till sakAra, and thereafter the next two pages are blank in scan. The next
data is of kSakAra.
The data about hakArAdi words are missing in the scan.
If any of you would be able to provide those missing pages, I would be
obliged.
