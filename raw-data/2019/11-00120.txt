Dear Martin,

your colleague might be interested in what Dhruv Raina wrote on the topic, and refer to the bibliography in his article:

Raina, Dhruv. 2003. ?Betwixt Jesuit and Enlightenment Historiography: Jean-Sylvain Bailly?s History of Indian Astronomy.? Revue d?Histoire Des Math?matiques 9 (2): 253?306.
Raina, Dhruv. 2010. ?The French Jesuit Manuscripts on Indian Astronomy: The Narratology and Mystery Surrounding a Late Seventeenth ? Early Eighteenth Century Project.? In F.Bretelle-Establet (Ed.) Looking at It from Asia: The Processes That Shaped the Sources of History of Science, 115?140. Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Springer.

Dear Martin,

I have been working on a similar subject since some years and I intend
to write a book (not before 2 or 3 years). Unhappily, I am studying only
the French part of it, since many French Jesuits were good astronomers
and either observed the sky in India or got informed there about Indian
astronomy.
The best sources to begin with are :
Le P.Antoine Gaubil S.J., Correspondance de P?kin 1722-1759, publi?e par
Ren?e Simon, Droz, Gen?ve, 1970, and
The biographies of Jesuits by Sommervogel, which appeared in many
volumes. If you are interested by the French connection, I can give you
a list of names.
I also wrote an article on the European astronomers at the court of Jai
Singh II (they were Jesuits) in the Journal des Savants, 2013,
p.175-192.

Best,

Jean Michel
