Dear Greg
For my Ondaatje book I used the following link

https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/index/nt00444/d11086aa-c864-11e6-9d8b-00505693001d

It contains information on persons (mainly personnel) on board of VOC ships sailing to Cape Town, Indonesia (Indie) and further to the east. I assume that similar information is available for ships sailing from Britain. I think you should ask the question on another forum, namely that of colonial historians.

With the best wishes, Herman

Dear List,

I don?t know if anyone can help me with this question out of left field.

A friend is trying to find information on one Frederick Taylor who was involved in massacres of Australian aborigines (there is a Wikipedia entry on this).  Apparently he was in India in the 1820s and had connections in the East India company.

I am not sure how to access the old East India records?now part of the British Library?as these might be of some use.  If anyone can enlighten me on this it would be very much appreciated.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey
