For the etymology of M?ya?a see:

The Etymology of the Name S?ya?a

M. B. Emeneau and K. Kushalappa Gowda
Journal of the American Oriental Society
Vol. 94, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1974), pp. 210-212
He argues that S?ya?a is from "sv?mi(n)" + ?a??an" ("elder brother" in Dravidian; ?sv?min" has a Kannada tadbhava ?s?yi?). He goes on to suggest that M?ya?a is from "m?(deva)" (< ?ma?adeva") +  a??an. G. Hart

Rather, the author must have been at least a generation later than M?dhav?c?rya. Two possible candidates which have been proposed are [1] the son of S?ya?a ? whose name M?ya?a is to be considered a corruption or regional form of "M?dhava", and [2] Cannibha??a, the naiy?yika author of the Tarkabh???prak??ik? ? either independently or as part of a committee. There is no direct proof to support either choice; the available evidence, however, allows each to be given serious consideration as possible candidates for the authorship. At most, we can say with certainty that under either claim, the Sarvadar?anasa?graha would have been composed during the fourteenth century under the patronage of the Vijayanagara court. (p. 31)
