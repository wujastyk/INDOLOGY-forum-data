Subject: [INDOLOGY] Visnu Purana - Hyraniaksha and the Earth Goddess
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf_JF7K+a2_RzdGwoFciGP09z+4u6+vG-kMtu6cA3Ckdqw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to find the verse where is described the episode of the
kidnapping of the Earth by Hyraniaksha.

In the Wilson's edition (1864) it seems the episode of her rescue by Varaha
is framed in Book 1 chapter 4 (pp. 57-61). However, I was unable to find
out the prologue of this episode.

Anyone can point out me VP's verse or other Puranic sources where I can
chek it?

Sincerely,
Paolo
