Dear Colleagues,

?

I am very pleased to announce the publication of a special issue of the journal?Religions?essentially an edited volume?on the topic?Perspectives on Reincarnation: Hindu, Christian, and Scientific.? A free PDF of the issue can be downloaded or an unfortunately not free hard copy purchased at this link:?https://www.mdpi.com/books/pdfview/book/1097

?

This volume arose from panels for both the Society for Hindu-Christian Studies and DANAM which were held at recent annual meetings of the AAR, and also includes papers from a variety of authors who were not involved in these panels.? I would like to thank everyone who contributed.? The volume includes papers by Gerald Larson, Jonathan Edelmann, Christopher Chapple, Lee Irwin, Nalini Bhushan, Gerard and Usha Colas, Nick Serra, Steven Rosen, Bradley Malkovsky, Ankur Barua, Ted Christopher, Ithamar Theodor, and myself, as well as a response by Francis Clooney.

?

All the best,

Jeff
