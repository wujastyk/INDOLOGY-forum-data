Dear Prof. Olivelle,

would you by any chance have a source of Madha?tithi?s remarks about
Manu, or could perhaps recommend a text edition where to find it? I
think this would be something very interesting to read with my students.

Best regards,


Raik Strunz

 If you are responding to my post, then you have misunderstood it. My
point was simply that the apauru?eyatva of the Veda was central to
Dharma??stric views regarding the epistemology of dharma, and this tenet
was borrowed from the sister school  of M?m??s?, as Jan Houben stated. I
am not talking about the apauru?eyatve of Dharma??stras!! These texts
were always believed to have been humanly authored. See Madh?tithi?s
wonderful, almost modern, view of how Manu composed his treatise.

 Dr.Houben,  
 
 With due respect,If I may just highlight a point ,namely, Dharmashastra
is a part of Smriti , or more specifically , a part of Vedanga.Can we
term it as "Apauruesheya"? Stuti is "Apauruesheya", but is.Smriti so?

 Dear Dean,  Some quick notes in reaction to your query: 
 It is a widely accepted clich? that "the Vedas are eternal and
apauru?eya" and another clich?, equally widely accepted by both
traditional and modern, Indian and non-Indian, scholars is that this is
essentially (!) THE Indian view on the Vedas.  At some point in time,
indeed, the "irrational" view of the nitya and apauru?eya Veda became
dominant, and the theory of elevated but basically "human" authors
disappeared from view in "orthodox" circles (just as the view of an
originally basically "human"  Jesus Christ advocated by Arius made in
the course of time place for more "irrational" positions such as
Trinitarianism which implies the an?dinidhanam divinity of Jesus in
Christianity?). This means there was an earlier time that the view of a
nitya and apauru?eya  Veda was not dominant or evident. Even if we limit
ourselves to the six so-called "orthodox" schools of Indian philosophy
we find that widely divergent views were held about the nature and
(extent of) authoritativeness of the Vedas -- and on the question
whether  the Vedic texts had or did not have authors: S??khya is
severely critical of the Vedas and Vedic ritual (Houben 1999); Ny?ya
makes efforts to prove that the Veda is not apauru?eya but pauru?eya:
deriving from a Puru?a, namely God (Chemparathy 1983); the school  of
Aitih?sika interpretation of the Rgveda did not survive but interpreted
the subject matter of hymns often in terms of references to human or
divine,?historical? personalities (E. Sieg 1902). Not much of their
views is preserved, but it is likely that the  authors of the hymns were
also regarded as ?historical? personalities; in Vai?e?ika, although
theism overtook later on, there is no early systematic commitment even
to God but to the ??is and their knowledge (even Pra?astap?da accepts,
apart from pratyak?a,  lai?gika and sm?ti, only ?r?a as another category
of reliable knowledge, vidy?, in contradistinction to four forms of
