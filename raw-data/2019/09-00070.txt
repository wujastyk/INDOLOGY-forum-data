Dear friends,

Is it possible that one of you has a pdf of R. Iyengar's 1944 (or 1952?) Mysore edition of the TarkabhASa of MokSAkaragupta? It is not available in archive.org or in any of the libraries I can access just now. WorldCat reports copies at Harvard, Emory, Oxford and the New York Public Library.

with thanks in advance,
Matthew

Some further material will be available in "The Roots of Yoga" by James Mallinson and Mark Singleton, the chapter on siddhis, I believe.

Best wishes

For materials closer to the period you are looking at - i.e. beginning of CE -- I would suggest the stories of the arhat Maudgalyayana in the Mahavastu-avadana (trans. Jones) and the Saundarananda of Asvaghosa (trans. Johnston or Covill).

good luck!

There must be many stories of things like this in texts like the Puranas, but these two references come to mind.

) The biography of Shankara mentions him leaving his body and entering the body of a king. Shankara-dig-vijaya is one of the classic texts on this. Perhaps some know of other sources.

2) Yoga Sutra III.38 says:

By loosening the cause of bondage and through sensitivity to the movements (of the mind), consciousness can enter another body.

Dear list-members,

A colleague is developing a research project on Out-of-body experiences
in religious contexts at the turn of the common era and would be
interested in comparing her material (her focus is on the Mediterranean
world) with that of other regions.

I have mentioned Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga and the Yoga-V?si??ha
(though I understand this is a later source) but I would be very
grateful to anyone who could suggest additional or more pertinent
sources.

Thank you very much in advance for any help you can provide!

All best,
Jessie Pons
