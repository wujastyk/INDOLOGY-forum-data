Subject: [INDOLOGY] origin and discussion that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya"

Dear Patrick and Madhav,
The discussion can indeed be extended from the six "orthodox" philosophical
systems, to, on the one hand, the dharma??stras (where M?m??s? principles
of interpretation find a natural, extended domain of application -- perhaps
hence also the M?m??s? view on the nityatva of the Veda?), and, on the
other hand, to the R?gveda.
Views that the Vedas -- the Vedic hymns -- are of primordial origin or are
given beforehand, and, in the  Puru?a-s?kta, literally of pauru?eya origin,
as rks, s?mans, yajus-formulas deriving from the primordial Puru?a, can
definitely be found in the R?gveda.
So also views that the Vedas -- Vedic hymns -- are and should be (newly)
created with much effort by the inspired poets, just as a carpenter creates
a chariot etc.
Writing on the Vedic poet's comparison of his work with that of a
"carpenter or cartwright", Jan Gonda *Vision of the Vedic Poets* 1963: p.
184 quotes Louis Renou's translation of
RV 7.64.4 y? v?m g?rtam m?nas? t?ksad et?m / ?rdhv?am dh?t?m k???vad
dh?r?yac ca ...
"celui qui charpentera votre tr?ne en pens?e, qui mettra haut-et-droit ce
po?me-ci et le maintiendra ..." (Renou EVP V (1958), p. 88).
Best, Jan Houben
