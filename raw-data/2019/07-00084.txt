    I have not yet repaired any electronic versions of book on archive.org
--but I hope to be able to do so soon. In the meantime Google has taken a
suggestion to permit open access to Richard Pischel's De grammaticis
prakriticis ... (1874).  Brianna of The Google Books Team writes:

We?ve completed our review of this book, and it has been approved for full
view. You should be able to view the complete contents here
