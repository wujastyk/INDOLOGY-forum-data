Dear Jan,

The discussion of 27 vs 28 described by Lanman as "a moot point? was indeed discussed by Whitney. My understanding is that 28 nak?atras were found in much earlier sa?hit?s such as the Taittir?ya (4.4.10) and the Maitray??i (2.13.20). This was my point about the interpolation.

Many have written about the Chinese 28 xiu-s (lunar lodges) and the nak?atras. A good place to start would be Needham?s Science and Civilisation in China. Vol. 3. Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth. Yano has a concise and useful discussion is his book ?Esoteric Buddhist Astrology? (p. 62-64 of English trans. just published this year).

Best regards,

Bill

I am aware of Bailey?s The mythology of Brahm?, where he described his origin as the apotheosization of the brahm? priest in the ?rauta sacrifice. I am also aware of Thieme?s very thorough study on the Br?hman in his Kleine Schriften (Teil I), where the the original senses and etymology as in RV are discussed. I am however still somewhat puzzled about the presence of Brahm? as a deity in the early Vedic sa?hit?s.

The difference between 27 and 28 lies in the nak?atra Abhijit, which is always associated with Brahm?. If Brahm? has a late origin, it is likely then an interpolation, and the 28-nak?atra system may also likely postdate the 27 one. But before I proceed on this line of analysis, I would appreciate it if anyone could enlighten me on Brahm? as an deity in the early Vedic sources, along with the most updated references on studies on the early Vedic deities.
