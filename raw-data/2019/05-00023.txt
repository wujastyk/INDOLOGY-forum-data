Dear colleagues,

Please see below for a call for papers reposted from the RISA list on behalf of Prof. Glen Hayes.

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim



Greetings,

With the semester winding down, I would like to repost the Call for Papers for the 2019 Conference of the Society for Tantric Studies, which will take place in Flagstaff, Arizona on September 27-29.  We are pleased to announce that Dr. Alexis G. Sanderson, Spalding Professor Emeritus of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University, will be delivering the keynote address.  The deadline for proposals is May 31.  I paste in below the basic conference information:

The Society for Tantric Studies invites papers for its next conference, to be held in Flagstaff, Arizona from Friday September 27 through Sunday September 29, 2019.  The Society for Tantric Studies (STS), founded in 1985, is a forum of exchange for scholars engaged in the academic study of Tantra both in its traditional Asian contexts and more recently in diverse global manifestations.  The conference provides an opportunity for scholars to collaborate across traditional boundaries of religious traditions (e.g. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism), present-day nation-states and geography (e.g. India, Tibet, China, Japan), and academic disciplines (e.g. history of religions, anthropology, art history, linguistics, sociology).  Above all, the STS is committed to critical and creative inquiry.  It is not an advocacy forum for Tantric practice and neither endorses nor prohibits particular approaches to either the study or the practice of Tantra.   Scholars with doctorates in relevant academic disciplines (such as Religion, Asian Studies, Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology, Art History, History, Philosophy, or Women?s Studies) who are researching and/or teaching in relevant areas of Tantric Studies are encouraged and invited to present, attend, and/or participate in the conference.  Graduate students in any of these, or related, disciplines are also encouraged to present and attend the conference.  Scholars and graduate students are welcome to attend without presenting.

FEES:  The STS is a volunteer-run, non-profit, and has no outside sources of funding.  The conference fees will be used strictly for conference expenses, such as room use, AV equipment, and support for a keynote speaker.  For 2019 the suggested conference fees are $150 for working scholars, $50 for graduate students, and $75 for retired scholars.

We invite fully formed panels and individual papers.  Proposals should be no longer than 1,000 words.  Abstracts should be no longer than 150 words.  In addition, all participants should include a CV.    Digital versions (.pdf format) of proposals and abstracts, as well as CVs should be emailed to Glen A. Hayes, Professor Emeritus of Religion, Bloomfield College at tantricstudies at gmail.com <mailto:tantricstudies at gmail.com>. 

SUBMISSION and ACCEPTANCE DEADLINE:  Proposals must be submitted no later than May 31, 2019.  The Steering Committee will send out notices of acceptance by June 30, 2019.  Participants are asked to confirm their attendance and submit the registration fee no later than July 31, 2019.

Some of the themes suggested by members of the Society include, but are not limited to, the following topics:
