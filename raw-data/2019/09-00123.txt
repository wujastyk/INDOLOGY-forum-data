Dear List,

It is my sad duty to let you know that today (Indian local time of ca. 11.30 am), Prof. Gouriswar Bhattacharya, well-known epigraphist and art historian, who had lived in Berlin/Germany for several decades, working for the then Museum of Indian Art, as well as for the former Institute of Indian Philology and Art History (Freie Universit?t Berlin), has breathed his last in Kolkata. His date of birth had been recorded as 15 February 1924, while he was actually born several months earlier, as he had once told me. 

Many of you would be aware of his numerous invaluable contributions to our field of study. He had continued his research until only about three years ago, when he began to lose strength due to a gradual deterioration of his health.

The following is a gist of his biography, basically extracted from the preface of the Felicitation Volume Praj??dhara: Essays on Asian Art, History, Epigraphy and Culture in Honour of Gouriswar Bhattacharya, 2009 (two volumes, edited by Gerd J. R. Mevissen and Arundhati Banerji, New Delhi: Kaveri Books):
