Thank you to:
Harsha Ebeling, who pointed me to Klaus Ebeling's book Ragamala Painting.
Herman Tieken, who pointed me to his article "Early Tamil Poetics between
Natyasastra and Ragamala".
George Hart, who pointed out "in Deccani folk culture ragas (pans) were
associated with erotic situations, moods and time of day".
