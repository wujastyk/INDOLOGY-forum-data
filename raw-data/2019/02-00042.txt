To: ??????????????????? <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>



On the day three of the BVP conference at Udupi , a session with the theme
" Whose Sanskrit is it anyway? " was organised. It was an all women
session. A few women Sanskrit scholars spoke autobiographically about their
own personal journey into and through this field.

They highlighted how it is more women than men most Sanskrit universities
and departments.

They spoke about the encouragement they received from the teachers, family
members and society.
