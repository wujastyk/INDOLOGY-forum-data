Subject: [INDOLOGY] Introducing a new book
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzfqrTvcX=0KeJAngRPFt-q7KOTWLOxavWawwc-Xgz3Lkg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am currently reading a new book by Professor Chinya V Ravishankar.  I
thought I should introduce it to our colleagues.  The title of the book is:
"Sons of Sarasvati - Late Exemplars of the Indian Intellectual Tradition."
It contains translations from the original Kannada of the biographies of
Garalapuri Sastri, Srikantha Sastri and Kunigala Ramasastri of 19th century
Mysore.  Professor Ravishankar is Professor of Computer Science and
Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Education at the College of
Engineering at the University of California, Riverside.  The book is
published in 2018 by SUNY Press.

The book represents a wonderful historical account of these three 19th
century scholars, and Professor Ravishankar's introductions and copious
notes provide in depth information regarding all sorts of local historical
and other details.
