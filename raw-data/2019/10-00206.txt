Dear Jesse,
just to expand a bit the reading list: if your student or yourself would
like to investigate this subject further, I also would recommend to look
at the publications by the following scholars, who are experts in this
field as well: Takao Hayashi, Agathe Keller, Takanori Kusuba, Clemency
Montelle, Francois Patte,  and myself.

Best wishes,
Alessandra.
