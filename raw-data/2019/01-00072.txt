Dear Colleagues,

The following verse appears in Madhva's and Baladeva's commentaries on the
Brahmas?tra. I suspect it appears in one or more Pur??as:

pu?yap?p?dika? vi??u? k?rayet p?rvakarma?? /
an?ditv?t karma?a? ca na virodha? katha?cana //

Please do let me know where you found this if you have run across this
?loka in a sm?ti text somewhere.

All the best,
Andrew
