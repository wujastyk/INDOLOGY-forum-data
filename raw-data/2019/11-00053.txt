Dear Prof. Slaje,

Please explain what is meant by ?first scholarly translation into English.? Horace Hayman Wilson?s English translation, which was published in 1866, six years after his death, predates Ludwig?s translation by a couple of decades. It is far from perfect, but it was a serious, pioneering effort.

He translated the Rigveda completely into German for the very first time (1876) and was the first to open up the content of the Rigveda by means of a multi-volume commentary (1878-1888). The fact that Ludwig, in the aftermath of his German translation of this important literary document, had also produced an English translation of the Rigveda between the years 1886 and 1893, which at the same time proved to be the first scholarly translation into English, remained entirely unnoticed by the Vedicist and Indological communities. Ludwig could not publish his completed translation during his lifetime. Shortly after his death, his handwritten translation was purchased by the University of Oxford. It was tacitly taken into custody by the Boden professor at the time, Arthur Anthony Macdonell (1854-1930) and left to the Max M?ller Memorial Fund in Oxford only after his death.
