Thanks for pointing this out George. I was going to make a comment along similar lines but didn't have your very helpful example at hand.
Do you happen to have a citation for this study?
Best,
Dean

?Indigenous males seem to have been marginalised by the new arrivals much more than the women and were unable to have children to the same extent,? says Richards. ?This seems unlikely to have been a wholly benign process.?

Perhaps it?s worth pointing out that current research suggests that Ashkenazi Jews also have a mixture of DNA ? paternal DNA from the near east but maternal DNA mostly from Europe. I don?t think anyone has suggested that the Jews have a violent history as anything but victims in Europe. It seems to me that Richards? suggestion is irresponsible and almost certainly inaccurate.

The new picture that the aDNA evidence is painting for Indo-European expansions is indeed grim and disturbing. I feel there is an urgent duty upon us ? especially upon those of us who are also Indo-Europeanists ? to be vigilant against attempts to co-opt these narratives of violence and oppression in the distant prehistoric past to justify violence and oppression in the present day. I do not hesitate to add that in today?s political climate where forces are actively pushing back and attempting to undermine the hard-fought advancements in human rights protections and progress towards gender equality achieved in the last decades, this seems more important than ever.

While the picture *does* look very bad, I suppose popular science articles whose headline brands the Yamnaya peoples as 'the most murderous people of all time' (admittedly a more nuanced take in the actual text of the article) is perhaps not the best way of communicating the results of this research to the general public.

Kind regards to all,

Matthew
