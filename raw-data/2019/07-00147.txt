Yes, it is, to my knowledge.  The Jamnagar site for Ayurvedic manuscripts
promises a similar feature, but the site has been static for years and I
saw no evidence of work on this when I visited Jamnagar in 2011.  I may be
there again this year, so there's a chance I could find out more.

Best,
Dominik
