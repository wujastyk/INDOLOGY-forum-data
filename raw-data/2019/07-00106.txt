The course provides an introduction to the Kannada language through an

grammar skills. It is intended for students of various disciplines and  
without any previous knowledge in Kannada.

Prof. Dr. B.A. Viveka Rai is a retired professor of Kannada Literature  
and Folklore at the University of Mangalore. Since 2010, he is a
