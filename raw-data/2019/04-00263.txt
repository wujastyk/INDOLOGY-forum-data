Dear List,

A friend who is not a member of the list has asked me about any Sanskrit references to kadi- or kadhi-markara, which must be kadhimakara. The latter part of the compound is common everywhere, but has anybody seen ka(?)dhi used in the meaning of ?sea? or with any meaning. MW gives ka?dhi as referring to sea, but provides no references. BR gives it as Meer (dam Wasser) + dhi haltend).

I checked up a number of texts on Gretil, but came up blank. Any help would be appreciated.



Cheers,

Greg Bailey
