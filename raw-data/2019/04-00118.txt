Dear Rosane and List,

This is absolutely wonderful and generous of you and Ludo! The field of Indology will definitely be the better for it.  My sincere hope is that others will consider following suit if and when they are able.

A note for those who might not be aware: Non-profit status in the US comes with a variety of rules, most of which require that any payments be kept within US borders and/or institutions (i.e., tax-free status is premised on the outcome of benefiting the local economy). There are exceptions, of course, but they are very complicated and are principally carried out by large organizations.

My best,

Steven

Dear Arlo Griffiths and colleagues,

The Ludo and Rosane Rocher Foundation is a non-profit private foundation incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania and subject to regulations of the US government and of the State of Pennsylvania for such foundations.  We proceed under advice from legal counsel.

The inspiration for this foundation, which Ludo and I took steps to set up in the last years of his life, was the Glasenapp Stiftung, established for the advancement of German Indology.  Although we have lived in different times and in different legal environments, we share the same goal of being as inclusive as we legally can on behalf of Indology.

After more than a decade when Ludo's prolonged illness and, even before, his increasing deafness prevented us from attending the annual meetings of the American Oriental Society, I have been cheered in the past two years to witness a new crop of Indologists, not only from North America, but also from diverse countries such as England, Denmark, India, and our native country of Belgium, present papers on the basis of their dissertations in progress or recently completed.  I invite you to attend these meetings or at least to look at the online programs of these meetings.  You will have no difficulty recognizing blossoming demonstrations of classical Indology and promises for its future, if adequately supported.

Ludo had his dissertation published, in English, by the University of Ghent.  Mine was published, in French, under an agreement between the Presses Universitaires de Bruxelles and the Presses Universitaires de France, at Louis Renou's recommendation.  We have not forgotten our European past and the advantage at which a published dissertation put us.

The estate of two Indologists is not that a billionaire.  Ludo and I had no fantasy of accomplishing everything that Indology could use.  But it has always been our hope and it remains my goal to foster young growth.  Hence "first books" as the first initiative of our foundation.  There will be other initiatives, particularly when the foundation is fully funded at my death.  In the mean time, I encourage caring established Indologists to provide young Indologists all the support they legally can everywhere.

Je serai de passage ? Paris, Munich, Bonn, et Detmold pendant les deux semaines ? venir.  Ce me serait un plaisir de vous y rencontrer.

Beste groeten,
Rosane Rocher
