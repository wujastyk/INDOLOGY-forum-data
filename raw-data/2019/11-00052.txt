Alfred Ludwig, full professor of comparative linguistics at the then German
University in Prague (born 1832 in Vienna, died 1912 in Prague), was a
pioneer in research pertaining to the Rigveda. He translated the Rigveda
completely into German for the very first time (1876) and was the first to
open up the content of the Rigveda by means of a multi-volume commentary
(1878-1888). The fact that Ludwig, in the aftermath of his German
translation of this important literary document, had also produced an
English translation of the Rigveda between the years 1886 and 1893, which
at the same time proved to be the first scholarly translation into English,
remained entirely unnoticed by the Vedicist and Indological communities.
Ludwig could not publish his completed translation during his lifetime.
Shortly after his death, his handwritten translation was purchased by the
University of Oxford. It was tacitly taken into custody by the Boden
professor at the time, Arthur Anthony Macdonell (1854-1930) and left to the
Max M?ller Memorial Fund in Oxford only after his death.



With Ma??alas I-V, the first half of Ludwig?s English translation of the
Rigveda is now brought to light. The publication of the second half,
containing Ma??alas VI-X, is under preparation.
