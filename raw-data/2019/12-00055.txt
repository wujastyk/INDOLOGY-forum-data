Gmail, Yahoo, and other public mass email systems  are more difficult to work with because their filters are convoluted, secretive, and aggressive  (list owners generally don't know what is tripping a filter; and they normally shouldn't know, because that would mean spam-producers would too and find new ways to circumvent controls). Such companies also don't have IT departments you can appeal to.

In your case, Harry, I would bet that Google updated or changed their filter system in some fashion leading to the sudden problem.  I don't know gmail well, but you could do a couple things.  One would be to add the listserv email address to your contacts list (contacts are generally considered exempt from filters). Another would be to reset your current filter (delete it and re-save) in case the update altered how it is executed.  If you can, make a filter for the domain (i.e. Indology.info) and not for the email address (this helps eliminate potential variables in tripping a filter).

Hope this helps.

My best,

s

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Problem with indology list

I'm a gmail user and what I did was under "settings" and then uder "filters" to set all mail from "indology at list.indology.info<mailto:indology at list.indology.info> to "never send to spam".  so far it seems to be working.  What was strange is that everything was working till about two days ago and then the problem just started.

I forwarded this thread to the governing committee since it seems to be widespread!

I've tweaked and tweaked my settings but emails from a few people through the list almost always end up in spam, even when those people can email me directly with no issues. ?\_(?)_/?

This seems to be a not uncommon problem. I know nothing of such matters, but is there some way that outgoing messages from the listserv could be modified to make them more receivable, rather than having all of the seemingly many individuals who aren?t receiving everything tweak their personal email accounts?

I've had a few messages go to Spam as well. Usually Dominik Wujastyk's (and a few others), which is odd since his other emails never hit the spam folder.

Problem solved I think.  For some reason as of two days ago some messages  to the list were going to the "spam" folder.  I;ve changed a spam setting so hopefully the problem will go away.

Dear list members,

It looks like some messages sent to the Indology list don't come through to me.  For example: there are two messages from Manu Francis that are archived from early this morning but I didn't receive them.  Does anyone else have this problem?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
