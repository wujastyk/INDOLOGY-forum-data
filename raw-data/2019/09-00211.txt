Subject: [INDOLOGY] About "bha-graha"
Message-ID: <CAJz4T_4fL4-HoaRCA_VfLegegeQpsrmo-Hqt0VXmyxAMqATxDA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

In the following verse of the *Tantr?loka* (28.42cd-43ab) of Abhinavagupta,
I do not completely understand the expression *bha-graha*. The only thing I
am sure is that this has to do with Jyoti?a.

*bhagraha*samayavi?e?o n??vayuje ko 'pi tena tadvarjam |
vel?*bhagraha*kalan? kathitaik?da?asu m?se?u ||

Can someone guide me? I apologise for being illiterate in Jyoti?a and I did
not get much help from the obvious basic sources either. I hope I am not
missing something very basic.

Thanks very much in advance.

Mrinal
