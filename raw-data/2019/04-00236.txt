Dear list members,

I'm looking for variations in the mah?lak?mya??akastotram in popular books
of collections of stotras.

If any list members have books of collections of stotras that have the
mah?lak?mya??akastotram in them.  and could scan the page with that  hymn
and the title page and  it to me I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
