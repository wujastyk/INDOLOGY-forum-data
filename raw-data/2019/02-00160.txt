Subject: [INDOLOGY] Dating of Brahmasutras
Message-ID: <CAPnSTegaC_Ewi1ZTnLD5xN7S-bi53ZJKixFSr7U2SLp-M6gWYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I would like to know about new research on dating of brahmasutras of
Badarayana. New is always relative. But it can mean last 10-20 years
research.
Thanking in advance
