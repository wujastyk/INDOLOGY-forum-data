Subject: [INDOLOGY] sculpture 3000bce to 1500ce
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrB545axDJT3ZSq9S9hAscMYzCJfaC=QTNJq+ERpNyLjAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm wondering if anyone is able to help with a query on sculptural
representations of wrestling in South Asia?
Actually, I'm particularly interested in any representations related, in
any way, to wrestling, from as far back as 3000bce to around 1500ce.

I'd like to talk with someone off list, if possible.

Thanks.


All the best,
