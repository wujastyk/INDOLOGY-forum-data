Subject: [INDOLOGY] origin and discussion that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya"

Dr.Houben,&nbsp;
With due respect,If I may just highlight a point ,namely, Dharmashastra is a part of Smriti , or more specifically , a part of Vedanga.Can we term it as "Apauruesheya"? Stuti is "Apauruesheya", but is.Smriti so?Alakendu Das.

Dear Dean,&nbsp;Some quick notes in reaction to your query:&nbsp;It is a widely accepted clich? that "the Vedas are eternal and apauru?eya" and another clich?, equally widely accepted by both traditional and modern, Indian and non-Indian, scholars is that this is essentially (!) THE Indian view on the Vedas. 

At some point in time, indeed, the "irrational" view of the nitya and apauru?eya Veda became dominant, and the theory of elevated but basically "human" authors disappeared from view in "orthodox" circles (just as the view of an originally basically "human" Jesus Christ advocated by Arius made in the course of time place for more "irrational" positions such as Trinitarianism which implies the an?dinidhanam divinity of Jesus in Christianity?). This means there was an earlier time that the view of a 

 nitya and apauru?eya Veda was not dominant or evident. Even if we limit ourselves to the six so-called "orthodox" schools of Indian philosophy we find that widely divergent views were held about the nature and (extent of) authoritativeness of the Vedas -- and on the question whether the Vedic texts had or did not have authors: S??khya is severely critical of the Vedas and Vedic ritual (Houben 1999); Ny?ya makes efforts to prove that the Veda is not apauru?eya but pauru?eya: deriving from a Puru?a, namely God (Chemparathy 1983); the school of Aitih?sika interpretation of the Rgveda did not survive but interpreted the subject matter of hymns often in terms of references to human or divine,?historical? personalities (E. Sieg 1902). Not much of their views is preserved, but it is likely that the authors of the hymns were also regarded as ?historical? personalities; in Vai?e?ika, although theism overtook later on, there is no early systematic commitment even to God but to the ??is and their knowledge (even Pra?astap?da accepts, apart from pratyak?a, lai?gika and sm?ti, only ?r?a as another category of reliable knowledge, vidy?, in contradistinction to four forms of avidy?)
