In this translated essay, originally published in French, Colette Caillat
offers an analysis of the Tandulavey?liya, one of the diverse
Prak?r?aka-s?tras in the Svet?mbara Jain canon. This unique medical
treatise fuses ancient Jain teachings found in the Bhagavat?-s?tra (Pkt.
Viy?hapannatti) andS?trak?t?nga-s?tra (Pkt. S?yaga?a?ga) with more
contemporary Indian medical treatises such as the Caraka- and
Su?ruta-sa?hit?s, offering greater detail on the formation of
embryos?including maternal/paternal contributions, gender, nutrition, and
stages of development, as well as the difficulty of pregnancy.

Water Clock and Steelyard in the Jyoti?kara??aka

*Sa?khy?-j??na*, the science of numbers, plays an important role in Jainism
which seeks to comprehend the universe numerically. *K?la-j??na* or
*k?la-vibh?ga* is an important part of sa?khy?-j??na, for time too has to
be comprehended in numbers. The Jainas measured time conceptually in
microscopic units and in macroscopic units, but for practical purposes,
early Jain texts like the *S?rya-praj?apti* employ a five-year cycle and
provide diverse kinds of astronomical parameters for this period.

A related Jain text *Jyoti?kara??aka* introduces an interesting variation
into the time measurement and speaks of the ?volume? and ?weight? of the
time. In this context, the text describes two tools of measurement, a water
clock and a steelyard, i.e. a balance with a single pan. Descriptions of
such instruments are rare in Indian literature; this paper presents a
cultural study of these two measuring instruments.
