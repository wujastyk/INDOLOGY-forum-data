Subject: [INDOLOGY] mea culpa and Dominik's contribution
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4Kua-YyZMk19LHHgUUg9ky6qBcGk_fX5VFdQZ7X74-XHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Dominik
I am perhaps not the only member who felt more than a twinge of guilt in
reading that you have been paying for storage out of your pocket. While I
agree that simply repeating previous posts is a very bad idea (I would have
said for reasons of legibility and page space, not storage cost), I would
be more than delighted to contribute to the costs of funding Indology, and
I am sure I am not the only one. Perhaps there is a way (sorry, I know this
is more work for someone!) to make a page where I can make a donation?
Paypal? Or--I'm blushing here--such a page already exists but I don't know
about it?

Jonathan
