This is an exciting two-year opportunity for the right person.  The
Wellcome Library has manuscripts and printed books in something like 42
Asian languages.  The largest collections are the Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic
and Persian, almost all puchased in South Asia.

Dear Dominik,



Hello! I hope you are well and thriving! We are finally getting our act
together to try and make all our non-European collections more accessible
and better known. I wanted to bring your attention to this new role we are
advertising. Do you think you could circulate it around your networks? It
would be an ideal post-doc opportunity:
