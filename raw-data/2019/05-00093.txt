Thank you for the KGS excerpt. From the general tenor of the 
H?yanasundara (which contains no other ritual references), though, I 
would be surprised if this /udagagni/ turned out to refer to any sort of 
ritual fire. It is tempting to emend the text (I can think of several 
neat solutions), but all witnesses agree in reading /codagagni-/. All 
witnesses, that is, of the text *quoting *from the H?yanasundara -- the 
only witness I have of the H?yanasundara itself suggests a copyist 
having succumbed to the emendation urge and reads, unmetrically, 
/caur?gne ripor api/.

Robbers, fire, enemies, violence, evil passions, fever, and disorders of 
bile and blood are all typical astrological significations of an 
ill-placed Mars. The thunder and lightning mentioned in the present 
verse is unusual, though, and I wondered if perhaps /udagagni /could be 
some other natural phenomenon of this kind, but if so, I can't think 
what. (Northern lights would be neat, but for one thing you don't get 
them in India, and for another they're not dangerous.)

Cheers,
Martin

PS: I haven't forgotten about that Har?a paper. Soon, I hope...
