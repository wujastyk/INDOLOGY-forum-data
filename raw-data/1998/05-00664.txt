Hi,

In Tamil, the river Yamuna is called tor..un-ai in Akana_nu_ru.
Cognate lexemes refer to an artificial channel or a rivulet: e.g.
to_d.u water-course; co_d.i rivulet (Kannad.a); d.u~r., d.u~r.h wooden
or bamboo water-channel, gutter (Nepalese)

This offers interesting points for speculation in the context of
archaeological dates of sites along Yamuna being later than the ones
on the Sindhu and Sarasvati rivers.

Prof. Valdiya notes that there is another aggrading river in Assam
also called Yamuna and adds that the name seems to have been preferred
for pirate rivers which cut deeper channels and capture the more
sedately flowing target rivers.

Regards,
k.
