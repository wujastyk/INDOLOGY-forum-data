How does one show from internal evidence alone
a aai/aau/ai/au pronunciation (not ai/au/ee/oo)
is implied in the RV?

Something else: are there any Iranian loans in
the RV? (I vaguely remember someone saying some-
thing like this but maybe not). If yes, can I
get a few examples?

Cheers (and thanks)
