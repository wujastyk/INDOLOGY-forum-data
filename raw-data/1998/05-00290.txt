A package called "Sanskrit for LaTeX" by Charles Wikner handles Vedic
accents, allows the user to choose between variant forms of several
characters, handles technical transliteration, etc. The package is
available from CTAN (ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/language/sanskrit/).
A compiled and patched DOS executable is available from my website at:
http://weber.u.washington.edu/~apandey/skt2-exe.zip.

There are no more available positions in Velthuis's font, so nothing more
can be added to it.
