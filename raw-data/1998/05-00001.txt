 bJM> Southern Maharshtra and parts of Telengana.

Though right now I am not in the ideal place from which to answer, I would, at first thought, rather be skeptical about the relatedness.

If "Belur" in Karnataka is the city famous for the Hoysala temple, we have to bear in mind that it is beeluuru and not bee.luuru / beeLuuru.
