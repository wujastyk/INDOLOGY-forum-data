It seems likely that Rajaram is confusing his Hermans. Herman Grassmann
(1809-77). The latter was a very fine mathematician, but turned to Vedic
studies apparently in disgust when his substantial mathematical
contributions were not recognized.  (They were appreciated posthumously.)

It would not be correct to say that Grassman's mathematics was influenced
by his Vedic studies.
