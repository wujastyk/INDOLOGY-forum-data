--------------------
For your information, there is a wonderful full-video program of the
Third Uday Shankar Ballet Festival (Jaipur, 1997) available on the web
direct from Doordarshan (the Indian National Television Network). It
is in three parts. As long as you have (or get) the free RealPlayer
software, you can connect to the Doordarshan web page at

http://ddindia.net

Then just click on the button for "Real Video Broadcast", and you will
be able to click an any of the three parts of the Uday Shankar Ballet
program, to play the video stream on your computer. (If you just click
on the Doordarshan icon in the little TV screen, you'll get their
current live broadcast video stream of whatever is playing now in India).
I've got this Doordarshan site linked in SARAI (the World Wide Web
Virtual Library for South Asia), under the heading of "News Sources,
Current Affairs, Mass Media of South Asia". Since Doordarshan is also
going to be providing live up-to-minute web-broadcasts of coverage of
the Indian elections (exit polls, results, analysis, etc.), I have
also linked this site in SARAI along with several other sources of
South Asian election information, on the subpage devoted to
"Government and Politics of South Asia". SARAI is at:
