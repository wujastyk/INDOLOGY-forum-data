This sounds a bit like the 's.rnkhalaa, chain, which one finds at the end
of adhyayas in MSS of the Astadhyayi.  In that case, the strange syllables
are the first ak.saras of every n-th sutra in the adhyaya, and the idea is
to have a little mnemonic check on correctness.  It sounds as though you
have single syllables, which wouldn't work, so perhaps it is something
different.

All the best,
Dominik
