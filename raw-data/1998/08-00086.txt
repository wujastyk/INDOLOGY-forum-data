A colleague working on Indian dating has asked me the questions below,
any information would be welcome.


>I am working from L. Rice's Mysore inscriptions (Bangalore, 1879) ...

>and he worked from "Major Dixon's photographs" (22nd Regiment, Madras

>Native Infantry, circa 1879).  Now and again I need to know the original

>word. For instance it would be odd if "the last day of the moon's

>decrease" was not merely "amavasya" in the original. But how can I tell?

>Where are the orginals, who knows about them?
