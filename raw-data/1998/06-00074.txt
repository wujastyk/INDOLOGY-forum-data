                Greetings Ms.Mary Storm,

                        Yes. There is reference to the Black Death
                in India. And it is recorded by Ibn Batuta himself.
                        Madurai, the capital of the Pandya Empire
                was ransacked by Malik Kafur, Kusrau Khan, and finally
                was captured by Mohamed bin Tughlaq in 1323 A.D.. He made
                it into the 23rd province of his Delhi Sultanate. He sent
                Jallaluddin Hassan Shah as its governor. Ibn Batuta had
                married one of the daughters of this Hassan Shah.
                        But Hassan Shah declared himself independant
                and created the Sultanate of Maabar(Madurai) in the
                year 1333 A.D. Muhammad bin Tughlaq himself led an
                army and marched towards Madurai to punish Jallaluddin
                in 1341 A.D. But when he was proceeding from Devagiri,
                the erstwhile kingdom of the Yadavas, to Warangal, the
                capital of the earstwhile kingdom of the Kakatiyas,...
               " a pestilence broke out in his camp and carried away some
                of his officers. The Sultan himself was subject to an
                attack of the dangerous disease. Rumours were set afloat
                to the effect that the Sultan was dead. He left Malik Maqbul
                at Warangal and himself returned to Dawlatabad(Devagiri) and
                thence to Dihli never to regain Ma'bar.
                        After a few years in Delhi, Ibn Batuta took leave
                of Muhammad bin Tughlaq and travelled to Calicut, the
