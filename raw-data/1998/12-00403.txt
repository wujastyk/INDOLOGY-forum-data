Correct me if I am wrong but the Vedic peoples' movement eastwards towards
the Ganga river is prior to the writing of the Purans. That would indicate
that the Vedic people moved from the Sarasvati region eastwards and came to
be known as Pauraniks. Would that still agree with the idea of a Tibetan
homeland ?
