My first posting of this message came back to me with all the CRs stripped
out. :-( Here's a second try.////////////


I just read a fascinating article in the January, 1998 issue of _Scientific
American_ entitled ?The Architecture of Life.? (The entire text of the article
can be found online at http://www.sciam.com/0198issue/0198ingber.html)

The article contained this passage:

?Remarkably, tensegrity may even explain how all these phenomena are so
perfectly coordinated in a living creature. At the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine, Donald S. Coffey and Kenneth J. Pienta found that tensegrity
structures function as coupled harmonic oscillators. DNA, nuclei, cytoskeletal
filaments, membrane ion channels and entire living cells and tissues exhibit
characteristic resonant frequencies of vibration. Very simply, transmission of
tension through a tensegrity array provides a means to distribute forces to
all interconnected elements and, at the same time, to couple, or "tune," the
whole system mechanically as one.?

Does this strike any chords--so to speak--with members of this list? Any
resonances with Indological texts on mantras or other sounds?
