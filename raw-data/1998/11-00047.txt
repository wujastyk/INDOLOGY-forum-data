    Never said mass migration of people. Books say IE were 10%
    and natives 90%. Let us reduce it further: 5% and 95%.

    Without a core of people these things won't travel.
    This is true even today when a multitude of technologies
    available to spread the message. But in those days???
    Horse sacrifice rituals match in many specific details
    that it is highly unlikely that they diffused from India to Rome
    intact.

    Islam spread to Southeast Asia because of the growth in Arab
    sea-borne trade/traders. Before Muslims, Indian traders, mainly from
    the South and East India took their religions,first Hinduism and
    then Buddhism to Southeast Asia.

    D. T. Suzuki, his guru established Zen first. Have seen
    Dalai Lama touring USA. After 1959, a need was felt to
    study Tibetan buddhism. watched little buddha movie,
    Richard Gere, ... A core group of trained Lamas are working
    for Tibetan Buddhism in US.

     In India, writing came much later (after Asoka). This is true
     for today's scripts barring IVC writing. Vedas
     were transmitted orally for many centuries and committed to
     writing much later. Indo-Iranian movements happened
     one thousand years before.

     IA movements and writing are vastly separated in time.
