With these powerful socio-political factors at play, academics need to be
wary of attempts from few Kannada/Telugu elites to read sanskrit from Indus
script. It could be like seeing Sanskrit in Hittite, Tamil, and indeed wherever
they want to. I can understand their affection towards Sanskrit, but is their
archaeological studies for real?!

I don't think it is mere coincidence that the theory of negation
of the Aryan-Dravidian divide is most actively written up by
N. S. Rajaram, S. R. (Ranganatha) Rao, Srikanth Talageri,
all natives of Southern Karnataka.

A case of reverse research. Have the conclusion first and work towards
the agenda.
