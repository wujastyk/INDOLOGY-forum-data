IE ???? Long ago, RV = IA language & culture ...

V's poetry is in typical IA < IIr < IE style, and so is his
religion/ritual.

Fine, but not all RV poets/priests are Aangirasa, e.g. the Kanva-s. And V.

According to J-Chr. tradition the world is just 6000 years old. And the
Bible is at least an attempt etc. etc.

About the Vedas: their AIM is different but they contain, must I repeat,
CONTEMPORARY data of politics & society.

J. Joyce (Ireland) is  younger than Shakespeare (England). Therefore J.'s
