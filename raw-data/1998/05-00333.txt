Dear Jan Filipsky;

My name is Jae-sung Kim.
May I give you some information about your question ?
You can check the meaning of original Paali text. I hope you have better
understanding on Brahmavihaara meditation through another translation.

I find following a Paali passage on practicing of Brahmavihaara
meditation.

.

averena avyaapajjhena pharitvaa vihaasi.

<MN2(PTS ed),(Makhaadevasutta.m 83) p.76:7-17>

This passage is translated into English as below.

He abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
(compassion, appreciative joy, equanimity) likewise the second, likewise
the third, likewise the
fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abided pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind
imbued with loving-kindness,(compassion, appreciative joy, equanimity)
abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.

<The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha : A New Translation of the
Majjhima Nikaaya>
Translated by Bhikkhu ~Naa.namoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi, Boston: Wisdom
Publication, 1995, p.693.


>Who or what "pervades the universe", the meditator or his thought?

Meditator's mind imbued with loving-kindness pervade all world(sabbaavanta.m
loka.m)
