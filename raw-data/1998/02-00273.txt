Shizutani is indeed the best source for Buddhist schools in
Indian inscriptions,
and is usable even without a knowledge of Japanese; see especially the
index of schools on p.153.  But it is not quite up to date, as quite a
number of inscriptions with such references have been published since
1979; for instance, a (previously) rare Mahisasaka inscription published
by G. Fussman in BEFEO 74 (1985), pp. 47-51.  In particular, numerous
Kharosthi inscriptions referring to the Dharmaguptakas have been found
recently; see A. Sadakata in JA 284 (1996), pp. 301-24.  Several more
Dharmaguptaka inscriptions will be presented in my forthcoming (later
this year if all goes well) book on the British Library Kharosthi scrolls
(at least some of which I believe to be Dharmaguptaka texts).
