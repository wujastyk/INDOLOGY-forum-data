Subject: Draft transliteration scheme on the Web

Dear Colleagues:
One point about the transliteration. Proto-Dravidian has a retroflex
fricative/frictionless continuant (Firth describes that it is somewhat like
the  Mideast American English r phonetically) which is retained in Tamil and
Malayalam. Emeneau and Burrow have transcribed it a r with <two subdots>. A
number of dravidian scholars now use a z <subdot>, because then it matches
with the other retroflexes which are transliterated with a <subdot>. This
symbol is not used for any other phoneme in Dravidian. Please consider it.
Regards, Bh.K.
