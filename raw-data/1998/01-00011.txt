The credit for solving the long-standing problem of the true identity of
the translator of the texts published under the pseudonym "Arthur Avalon"
goes to Kathleen Taylor, whose interesting article "Arthur Avalon: the
creation of a legendary orientalist" was published in _Myth and
Mythmaking: continuous evolution in Indian tradition_, ed. Julia Leslie
(London: Curzon, 1996).  ISBN 0-7007-0303-9.

In this fascinating article, Taylor draws particular attention to the
little-known scholar Atal Behari Ghosh who "supervised the textual side of
all the works under Avalon's name, including those in the Tantrik Texts
series..." (p.157).

All the best,
Dominik
