Excuse me, but the question is _Indo-European_ linguistic diversity
in the _Indian subcontinent_.  That excludes Tocharian (the Tarim
Basin is in Central Asia) and Brahui (Dravidian) [as well as
Burushaski (isolate) and Nihali (isolate)].  This leaves just one
Indo-European subgroup (Indo-Iranian: subdivided into Iranian,
Nuristani (Kafiri), Dardic and Indo-Aryan).  Maybe two, if
Pre-Bangani is for real.

Between Anatolia, Europe and Central Asia there are a dozen or so
Indo-European subgroups, the most basic split of all being that
between Anatolian (Hittite, Luwian, Lydian, etc.) and all the rest.
