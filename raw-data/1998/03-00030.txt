Not all of us read our mail through Netscape 4 (or whatever HTML-aware
product you are using). Receiving HTML messages is a big pain if your mail
client can only display them as text. Of course you can attach a document
in HTML format (or indeed any other format) to your message, but in doing
so you are restricting the readership to people with "appropriate"
software. Plain text is still safest.
