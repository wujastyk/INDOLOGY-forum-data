        While the chart given by Samar Abbas looks nice, it has major
historical problems.  By tracing the origins of Urdu exclusively to
Arabic, Persian, and Turkic, the chart overlooks the main core of the
language.  In its basic grammatical core and basic vocabulary, Urdu is an
Indo-Aryan language, with Arabic, Persian, and Turkic features
superimposed on this basic IA core.  It is not that Urdu borrowed the IA
features as a subsequent phenomenon.  The IA base absorbed the other
features to become a distinct sub-variety of IA.
