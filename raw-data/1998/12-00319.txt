Odd.  I would definitely have used the term "subgroup" or "branch"
here.

Etcetera...

There is simply overwhelming evidence that a Proto-Indo-European
language once existed in a certain area during a certain period of
time.  There is no other way to explain the countless similarities
and exact correspondences between the different IE languages.

Of course it never was *one* PIE language at *one* single coordinate:
different dialects were always in existence, and in fact we can be
pretty specific about the features of the different dialects as well.
And obviously the PIE dialects changed in the course of time,
allowing us to distinguish between features that are pre-PIE, early
PIE, late PIE etc.

It is sometimes claimed that this wholly natural lack of precision
(no *single* PIE at a *single* place) invalidates the PIE hypothesis.
If there never was a single unified PIE language, then why assume PIE
existed at all?  Well, why assume English exists at all?  There isn't
and never was a single unified English language at a single spot.
But it's still meaningful to talk about the abstraction we call the
"English language".

It was announced (e.g. in the Bibliography of Beekes, op.cit.) as
"Encyclopaedia of IE Studies".  I cannot find either title at
amazon.com.

It depends on whether the languages that are adjacent are
(genetically) related to each other in the first place.  If we have a
group of closely related languages, it is often difficult to
distinguish borrowings from cognates, especially if interborrowing
goes on for an extended period of time.  If the languages are not
related, or only remotely related (no mutual intellegibility), it is
easy to sort out the borrowings from the rest.  The borrowings will
be very different from the inherited items, show ad-hoc adapatations
to the phonology of the borrowing language, often violate phonotactic
constraints in the borrowing language, etc. etc.  It is very easy to
recognize French borrowings into English, harder to recognize Old
Norse borrowings, often very hard to recognize items borrowed from
other dialects, like Mercian or Kentish.
