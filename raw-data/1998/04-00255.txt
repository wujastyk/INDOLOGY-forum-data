Jean Fezas said about the  human sacrifice reported from Jambewa:

"If this murder it is the first (and only) incident of this kind, it has nothing to
do with a ritual.
If there is no ritual it is not  a "brutal human sacrifice" it is an instance of
mental illness..."

Not quite.  It's the first reported from this locality, not the first in India.  After
all, one can buy the Kalikapurana in the bazar and find a ritual for human
sacrifice in it.
