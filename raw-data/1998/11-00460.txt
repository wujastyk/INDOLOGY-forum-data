that the honest views of scholars like Denis Sinor, Narain and
Linguists like R.M.W.Dixon will help in bringing some sanity.
I must say that Dixon's "Rise and Fall of Languages" is an excellent book -
lots of common sense in it.

I happen to agree with you verdict on Dixon's book, but I fail to see that Dixon and Sinor should be more "honest" than people like Mallory. I have read both, and enjoy both. You also seem to have overlooked that Dixon has a generally high opinion of Indo-European linguistics, even if he is critical of some aspects of it. By the way, his critique and his new model ("convergence - divergence") is basically the same as Trubetskoy's critique and model, which was published in 1939. You may be happy to hear that Trubetskoy places the Indo-European homeland somewhere in Eurasia for various linguistic reasons (such as comparisons with features of Kartvelian and Finno-Ugric languages). Presumably, Trubetskoy should belong to the "common sense" people, too, since his model is not much different from Dixon's. :-)

Sheepishly,
