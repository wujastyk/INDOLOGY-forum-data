Thanks for giving me the opportunity to
introduce TirukkuRaL (ca. 4th-5th century A.D.).
It has been dear to Tamils ever since its
creation called as Tamil Veda.  TirukkuRaL means
Sacred Couplets. It is very secular in its outlook.
In its third section on "pleasure", it is
most poetic. The reason is that Sangam
classical love poetry traditions are still strong
here. Leo Tolstoy writes about Kural in his
'Letter to the Hindus'.

    "The maxims of Valluvar has touched my soul"
                         - Mahatma Gandhi

    "With sure strokes, the Kural draws the idea
     of simple ethical humanity. There hardly exists
     in literature of the world, a collection of
     maxims in which we find so much wisdom"
                         - Albert Schweitzer

    "Kural has entered into the very soul of a
     whole people. It proclaims in sweetest mystic
     couplets virtue, truth, wealth and joy"
                         - G. U. Pope
