>?From the data given above, it should be clear that the horse-sacrifice is
well attested both in the West and the East. However, as myths go, we cannot
always expect to find entirely clear parallels. The Roman case shows clear
parallels with the Indic. In the Celtic area, the connection with the
coronation may not have been original (or the connection may have been lost
in Rome, where there was no king). The main point is that there was a major
sacrifice involving horse sacrifice and drunkenness. There is Nordic
archaeological material which shows that horses were sacrificed in that area
too, usually in the way that certain parts of the horse were put down in the
moss (head, four legs, tail). Unfortunately, I have no more details on this.
The Old Norsemen, by the way, used to slaughter horses for Christmas (the
winter solstice) and eat, drink and be merry. The eating of horse meat was
prohibited by the Christian church because of its connection with the pagan
ritual.

And now to the question raised by Mr. Subrahmania:

If the Celts had migrated from the area in question about 2000 BCE, it would
be different to explain the linguistic distance between Indo-Iranian and
Celtic. We would expect the "forefather" of Celtic to have left the
"forefather" of Indo-Iranian perhaps a 1000 years or more earlier. But as
pointed out by Mallory, there are elements of the argument that seem
difficult to reconcile. Possibly, the horse sacrifice as such is older than
the use of paired draught, but has been changed in accordance with the new
technological development. This is one of those questions where there is
ample ground for making hypotheses, but where hard evidence is difficult to
come by.

As for the supposed similarity of Indus seals and Celtic images, I would
have to have more data to venture an opinion.
