|                examined, 27% presented frequencies consistent with Sinodont
                 variation, while 73% of the traits showed similar incidence

|                populations than previously shown.

|     ABSTRACT:  Torus palatinus (TP) was recorded in 13.5% of 1317 German
|                patients (606 men, 711 women). There was no statistically
|                significant difference between the sexes. Torus palatinus
|                was found in 23.1% of 947 Thai (404 men, 543 women). The
|                difference between the sexes was significant (P less than
|                0.001); women were affected in 28.5%, men showed a TP in
|                15.8%. The differences in prevalence rates between Germans
|                and Thai was also statistically significant (P less
|                0.001). Torus mandibularis (TM) was recorded in 5.2% of the
|                German patients with 8.6% of the men and 2.4% of the women
|                being affected (P less than 0.001). In the Thai, 9.4% of the
|                men and 9% of the women showed TM. The difference between
|                the prevalence rates in Germans and Thai was significant (P
|                less than 0.001). While generally milder forms of tori were
|                observed in German patients, marked forms of TM were also
|                seen in this group. While the etiology of TP and TM is still
|                no quite clear, racial factors must definitely be
                considered.
