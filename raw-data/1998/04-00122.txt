Hello all,

I just wanted to let you know that the Kauthuma Samhita of the Samaveda is
available in CSX and Postscript formats from:

        http://weber.u.washington.edu/~apandey/texts

The actual source text is encoded in CS/CSX, however the document has TeX
control sequences which enable it to be typeset using ITRANS and LaTeX.
The Postscript document is a completely formatted version of the source
file.

[...]

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
