This is not correct. It is the illiterate person who is afraid that
he is pronouncing a word wrongly that tries to hypercorrect.

For example a street vendor selling limes
calling 'darbhakAyalu' instead of 'dabbakayalu'.

Sometimes even the learned fall into the hypercorrection trap but
more often it is the unlearned and illiterate.
