I don't have any books on hisotrical Iranian phonology handy, but perhaps
I should have said intervocalic s.

I thank Professor Witzel for his detailed reply. Now I need to find out
how they were actually pronounced. Does anybody know if Beekes' grammar
of Gatha Avestan covers this? (It is checked out of the library at the
moment. I plan to read it at some future time anyway.)

Can hl or just l (both l's lateral) become s`', or did both come out of
some other common pronunciation? also wouldn't this change mean that
t in -rt- was pronounced differently than intervocalic t/tt?

The whole point of my question was if the triple distinction s/"s/.s
of Sanskrit can be considered as due to Dravidian influence or if
Iranian forces us to recongize this for a common PI-Ir stage. It looks
to me that the latter is the case.
