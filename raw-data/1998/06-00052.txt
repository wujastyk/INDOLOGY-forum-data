I missed the original question, there are also sculptures of Narasimha
and Dakshinamurti with the yogapaTTa, though rare. There is a brief
discussion of the Elements of Hindu Iconography, by T. A. Gopinatha Rao
Vol II, Part I about dakshinamurti with yogapaTTa (page 284-286). I
believe Vol I, part I has all the relevant Sanskrit sources. You may
want to look at all 4 volumes
to see if he has one about Narasimha also.

Rama.
