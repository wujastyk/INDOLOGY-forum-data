acceptable. From second century AD, 'Siva-Avalokitezvara
syncretism developed, much before KumArajIva
or Central Asian sutra fragments.

There is no earlier occurence of avalokitasvara
than avalokitezvara occurences I gave.

A humble request for Dr. Jonathan Silk: Can you please summarize
the 1936 avalokita/apalokita and the R. Stein's paper
some time for me please? Within the next 2 months is
fine for me.

Regards,
N. Ganesan

Note: In all the Avalokitezvara works, I would rather doubt that
the Southern Indian dimension will be explored at all.
