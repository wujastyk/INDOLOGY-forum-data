Here are the stanzas from MBh. describing Uttara kurus in the sabhA parvA.
There are some in bhISma parvA also where the longevity of the people there
is mentioned.

uttaraM kuruvarSantu sa samAsAdya pANDavaH
iyESa jEtuM taM dEzaM pAkazAsananandanaH.
tata EnaM mahAvIryaM mahAkAyA mahAbalAh
dvArapAlAh samAsAdya hRSTa vacanamabravIt.
pArtha nEdaM tvayA zakyaM puraM jEtuM kathaJcana
upAvartasva kalyaNa paryAptamidamacyuta.
idaM puraM yaH pravizEd dhruvaM na sa bhavEnnaraH
prIyAmahE tvayA vIra paryAptO vijayastava.

Though it starts with "uttaraM kuruvarSaM", in the last two slokAs the
reference is to a city. Perhaps the capital also is called Uttarakuru
puraM. This tallies with Ptolemy's description of Ottorokoro as city.

sarma.
