We don't know for sure what the original Scythians spoke.  Some of the
Scythian vocabulary given by Herodotus has been analyzed as Altaic.
Some works given by McGovern proposing that Scythians were Altaic
speakers are: Peisker's _Die Alteren Beziehungen der Slaven zu
Turko-Tartaren_; Treidler's "Die Skythen und inhre Nachbarvolker,"
_Archiv fur Anthropologie_, 1914, pp. 280ff and Minns _Scythians and
Greeks_. He also mentions Niebuhr and Neumann.

The Scythians may have adopted other languages in places they went such
as the case with the Parthians. Minns felt the Scythians were Altaic
people who had incorporated large numbers of Iranians as they moved
across their territory.

There is no hard evidence one way or another.  However, there is plenty
of hard evidence that Altaic and at least one Uralic people lived lives
almost exactly similar to that described for the Scythians. OTOH, the
first completely verifiable Indo-Iranians in Persia practiced a culture
that was as different as night is to day.

In medieval times, Europeans called Huns, Avars, Magyars and related
peoples "Scythians."  Mostly this was a cultural description, although
there may have been so "racial" connotation also (see Hippocrates).
