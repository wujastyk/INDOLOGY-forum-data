I think this is related to the Indian idea that Knowledge is
eternal, ever existing. Remember the puranic story that vedas
were stolen by demons, hidden under the sea, Vishnu recovers them.
Alvar bhakti poetry, the divya prabandham of 4000 verses, were
lost. In a flash, upon meditation Nathamuni brings them back
to the world.
