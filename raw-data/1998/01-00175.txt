Fine, you don't have to read it. Nobody asked you to, or for any advice,
btw. Apparently _some_ guy thought it was worth doing, but you are of
course so much more clever. That would seem to come close to what, in
English and Yiddish, is called to kibitz.

You brought us valuable information indeed. Now we know you don't approve
of the idea. Great. Future translators beware: there's one Winnie who
doesn't think it's such a hot idea. Happy? Maybe you'd like to let know
the world at large now what other language you don't think the giitaa should
be translated in?

Who said that? If there's anyone who looks paranoid to me here it's you.
I'd say you look more like a ignorant and a snob to me.
