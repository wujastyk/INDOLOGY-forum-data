This Handlist contains brief descriptions of about 1000 manuscripts from
the Indic collection of the Wellcome Institute.  The subject matter of the
MSS ranges across almost all sastras from alankara to yoga; this
particular volume of the Handlist has particularly numerous items in the
categories of itihasa, jyotisa, puja, purana, stotra, and tantra.

Volume I of the handlist is still available; copies are being sold at a
heavily discounted price, and are available from Ms Tillotson as above.

All the best,
Dominik
