Hi,

The scholarly debate on the Indo-Aryan migration issue with a lot of
interest has so far proceeded on
archaeological/philological paths.

Was there a discussion on the Vedic references to
the Sarasvati River (charted also by Witzel)? What was the locus of
the Sarasvati River in Rigvedic times?

Was it the tributary to Kubha called Haraquaiti or
was it the Markanda/Ghaggar/Hakra?

Geophysical/ glaciological/ archaeological/RV/MBh
evidence has been assembled with a bibliography at URL:

Regards.
Kalyanaraman
