        I don't believe such story to have any link with the cannibalism,
but to absolute devotion to the God(s).
        They are many examples of it in various civilizations:
1) the biblical sacrifice of Isaac by his father Abraham (happy end).
2) the sacrifice (tophet) of eldest sons by Phoenicians (bad end).
3) in Greece, Tantalos, wishing to honour the Gods invited to a lunch, give
them his son Pelops to eat (happy end for Pelops, bad for Tantalos).
        This last story (and Cronos eating his children) was interpreted by
the psychoanalysis as an unconscient fear of children to be eated by their
parents. In any case, the cannibalism is a very different ritual destined
to acquire some of the powers of the victim (strength of ennemy, wisdom of
elders, &c.).
