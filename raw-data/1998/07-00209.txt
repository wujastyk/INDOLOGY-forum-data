In deference to the 2k rule I will try to respond briefly, and only to one
or two points at a time:

This is beyond my competence. Perhaps others can help here [please].

Again, linguistic typology is beyond my competence, but in this case I fail
to see why the merging of all n's would be the necessary outcome of
convergence. The opposite would seem just as likely. There's a new book out
by Ladefoged and somebody else on the world's phonological systems, which
my bookstore is getting for me. I'll report back after I've had a chance to
look at it. Perhaps it will tell us what is "typical" in this regard.

Yes, the RUKI rule is older than PIA, affecting Iranian as much as Indic.

I also see little to disagree with in general about your Stages 1 and 2.
But it would be imteresting to know what time-frame you picture for these
stages.

Enough for now. Are others willing [I know that some are able] to
contribute insights?

Many thanks to V. Rao for keeping this thread alive, and lively.
