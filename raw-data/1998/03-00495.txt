Reading an article by Prof. Thomas Burrow on Aryans intruding
into India. Reference: Arthur Cotterell, Encyclopaedia of
ancient civilizations, 1980

"Systematic excavation has hardly started and the chief site,
Harappa, was plundered between 1856 and 1919 for building materials.
During the construction of the Lahore-Multan railway line
*hundreds of thousands* of ancient kiln-burned bricks were used
to  provide  a firm footing for the rail track across muddy
lowlands". - T. Burrow

Is it because of this plundering, the invasions and remnant ashes
could not be found nowadays? Rig veda has no word for
bricks. The fire altars found are later than the Indus culture.
(Ref. F. Stahl)


"Such battles, and the destruction of forts or cities, are
most frequently mentioned in connection with the god, Indra,
who as a result, receives the epithet Purandra, 'the destroyer
of cities'. The god of fire, Agni, is also prominent in this
aspect as a result of his part in destroying the cities of the
Dasyu. One verse (Rig Veda 7.5.3) is paricularly explicit on this
point: *Through fear of you (Agni) the dark people went away,
not giving battle, leaving behind thier possessions. when,
O Vaishvaanara, burning brightly for Puuru, and destroying
the cities, you did shine*." - T. Burrow

Are these the blurred recollectins?

"The Aryans were aware of the numerous ruined Indus sites
among which they lived, and they referred to them by the term
arma, armaka, 'ruined site, ruins'. Among the references to these
the following is of particular significance: *The people to
whom these ruined sites, lacking posts, formerly belonged,
these many settlements widely distributed. they, O, Vaishvaanara,
having been expelled by thee, having migrated to another
land*."  - T. Burrow

What is the verse number in Rig Veda of the above?
When the ecological balance and balance of power in the
pre-aryan society turned against the indus valley people,
Aryans established. This verse appears to be referencing
that critical event.
