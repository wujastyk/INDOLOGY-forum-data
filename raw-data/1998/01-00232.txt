One of the Oldest PurAnAS namely ViSNu PurANa incudes Malaya in the
enumeration
of the seven kula parvatAs.

        mahEndrO malayaH sahyaH ZuktimAnRkSaparvataH
        vindhyazca pAriyAtrazca saptAtra kulaparvatAh. 2.3.3

It notes that kRtamAlA and tAmraparNi as the rivers born in these mountains.

        kRtamAlA tAmraparNIpramukhA malayOdbhavAH. 2.3.13(1)

By the way somebody was asking me today whether malayALI and malaya are
related. Are they?

sarma.
