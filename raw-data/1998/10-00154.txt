While I don't claim to be a scholar on the topic, intuitive statement
like above bother me.  Many of the nationalistic research gets guided
through such unfounded empiricism and they get further.  I would urge
that we avoid speculations that we cannot prove.

Somehow the rest of the reasoning sounds shallow to me from the same
point of view.  We must by all means differentiate between opinions
and research.  Methods of research are as important as findings that
may be arrived at, sometimes more..
