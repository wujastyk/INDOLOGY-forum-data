acob Baltuch (July 11) quoted my recent message:
:

,

and wrote:

<Well known example? ...
<What is well known to me is that there *was* a particular battle (not with

<in the Pyrenees where "Roland, le comte de la marche de Bretagne" (don't

        Well, I just wanted to say that real epic

(that is, an epic of oral origin and oral-formulaic style, which we may say
about the "Song of Roland"
but not about the Old Russian "Tale of Igor's Campaign", mentioned by you,
which is, if genuine, an artificial epic, written, by the way, not in verse,
but in rythmical prose) -

the real epic does never describes a particular historical battle, but always
some typical, generalized and idealized event. Yes, there really was the battle
of 778 at Roncevaux, where some Roland was possibly killed (however, I am not
sure that anything mentioned in a chronicle necessarily is a historical fact;
sometimes epic tales find their way in the chronicles!). But you are right,
that battle was with Basques, not with the Saracenes, as in the "Song of
Roland", and the latter used and mixed to it also some details borrowed,
as far as I know, from other historical battles, including the Frenchmens'
defeat in the same mountainous region in the reign of king Dagobert. In the
same way Serbian songs about the battle at Kossovo combined reminicences of
the battle in 1389 with memories of several similar defeats, including the
catastrophic battle of 1457, which really put an end to Serbia's
independance.
        The epic poet may think, of course, that he describes real historical
event, and sometimes a historical name may be preserved by chance in his poem;
but what he really sings about is a typical, ideal battle with typical,
generalized enemy.
        Best regards
