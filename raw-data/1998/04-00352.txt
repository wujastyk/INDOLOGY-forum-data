*I do not dispute that southern iconographies of "Siva's dances are
*southern.  It is also possible that "Siva dancing makes his first
*appearance in southern sources; but you have not proved that this is
*the case.  What is the evidence for dating Appar, Kaaraikaalammaiyaar,
*the Cilapatikkaaram, and the quotations in unnamed commentaries on
*Ca"nkam poetry you mention to before the 6th century?

A) The very first song in kalittokai is on "Siva's dance with Umaa.
   Kalittokai is a classical sangam text. Many believe this
   predates 6th century.

B) Three examples from medieval commentaries describing
   "Siva's dance. How do we say that these are very early,
    ie., earlier than 6th century? 1) Many other examples given
    in these commentaries are from and exist in sangam anthologies,
    so these must be from works now lost 2) the language & meter.
    The meter, akaval, same as in the following poems is in
    sangam poetry. Later, veNpaa dominates in didactic works;
    Bhakti poems are precursor to viruttam of the epics period.
