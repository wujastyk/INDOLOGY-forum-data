The Sakas, came, in part, via the Baltistan crossing as did a few Turkish
invaders into Kashmir (Haidar Dughlat i think) in the Middle ages, just
before Babur...

And there was the Chinese/Nepalese army coming to the

For Baltistan (and traders)  read Jettmar in Studien zur Indologie &
Iranistik a few years ago....
