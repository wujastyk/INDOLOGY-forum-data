Greetings Indologists:

Could anybody tell me if India experienced the Black Death ( 1347-1351)
which so devastated Europe?
 It seems the Black Death originated in China and travelled with the
Golden Horde and affected areas in the Middle East and North Africa as
well as Europe, but I have not found references to India.
I am not having any luck finding info in places where I assume it should
be, e.g. Ibn Battuta.
Any help would be gratefully received. Thanks!!

Mary Storm
