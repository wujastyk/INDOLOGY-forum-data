 Within the Paninian tradition, the first author to make
reference to this story is Haradatta, the author of the
commentary PadamaJjari on the KaazikaavRtti. In the
introductory section (vol. I, pp. 8-9), Haradatta
(10th century?) says, about PaaNini's extraordinary ability
 to see the entire infinite language:

    kathaM punar asmadAdInAM sarvalakSyadarzitvam? mA
    bhUd asnadAdInAm, asmadviziSTAnAM maharSINAM sambhavati/
    yasya vA IzvarAnugrahaH sa sarvaM pratyakSayati/
    atraiva hi laukikAH smaranti -

     yenAkSarasamAmnAyam adhigamya maheZvarAt
     kRtsnaM vyAkaraNam proktaM tasmai pANinaye namaH

    iti/ akSarasamAmnAyaM ca vyAcakSate devasUtrANiti

    How can folks like us see all the target language?
    Perhaps not for folks like us, but such [an ability]
    is possible for the great sages who are superior
    to us. Or, a person who has been graced by God can
    directly see everything. In this context, the learned
    of the world remember, "Salutations to Panini, who
    having acquired the akSarasamAmnAya from the
    Great Lord [='Siva] narrated the whole grammar."
    They call the akSarasamAmnAya by the term devasUtra.

 Haradatta is a South Indian author from the Chola area.

b) Inspired by Avalokitezvara:

PART I:
-------

Tibetan Lamas, Bu-ston (13th century) and TArAnAtha (1608 AD) expand
on ManjusrimUlakalpa. This sutra called Manjusrimulakalpa
(10th century) awards a lower form of enlightenment
(=zrAvakabodhi) to Panini. It never explicitly says that
 Avalokitezvara taught Panini the grammar nor more specifically
akSarasamAmnAya (alphabet).

Manjusrimulakalpa is one of the very few buddhist
Sanskrit texts that have survived in India. It was found
at Manalikkara Matam near PadmanAbhapuram, a stone's throw
from Cape Comarin and was edited by
T. Ganapati Sastri at Tiruvananthapuram.
Possibly this is from Muulavaasam buddhist monastery,
few miles from Potiyil mountain in the deep South.
An avalokitezvara from Muulavaasam monastery
was discovered in Gandhara region with the
inscription, 'dakSiNApatho mUlavAsa lokanAtha'.

Avalokita is said to be a resident of
Potalaka. GaNDavyUha(2-3 centuries AD) and Taaranaatha
locate Potalaka in the deep South. Potalaka is
 located in the Malaya mountains by Hsuan Tsang.
N. Dutt, B. C. Law, S. Hikosaka, K. A. Nilakanta Sastri
and others identify Potalaka with Potiyil in the
Malaya mountain range.

Candragomin, who saved the Mahabhasya tradition from
extinction went and settled down at the Mount Potalaka.
He is still living there, according to Taranatha.

Hsuan Tsang says that in Potalaka od South India,
"to the people at the foot of the mountain
Potalaka who pray for a sight of the Bodhisattva,
he appears sometimes as a Pazupata TIrthika
or as Mahezvara" (Watters 1905: p. 229).
We have inscriptional evidence for
the presence of pAzupathas in a management role
of the temple at kuRRAlam at the foot of potiyil
in the tenth century.

Manimekalai has an episode where a vidyAdhara
couple make a pilgrimage to Potiyil.
Manimekalai, the only Buddhist epic (6th century)
we have, does not say whether Potiyil is Buddhist or Hindu.

Hsuan Tsang says that Panini was born in
the Northwest and inspired by 'Siva.
He never says that Panini in the Northwest
was inspired by Avalokitezvara.
