This discussion which followed the remark was certainly above your
intellectual level ( or below ) for you didn't have the courage to take part
in it, being only concerned with a fruitless post festum observation. As a
matter of fact the remark had the benefit of opening a healthy  discussion
which proved if nothing that it was neither hostile or unproductive .
