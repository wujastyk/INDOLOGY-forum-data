Hi Lars,

Another point. When you reply to an Indology message,
your e-mail software automatically adds SV: in front
of the title.

As an example, this message has THREE SV:'s!
(In the archives, your replies have done this
for all your replies.)

Others send it with Re: or RE: something like that.
In the archives, those messages with "Re" get
grouped whereas those with "SV" start a separate
thread.

I was always thinking your replies should
start with "Re:".

Yours,
n. ganesan
