Subject: Suggestion for new Indo-Iranian linguistics mailing list
Message-ID: <161227039875.23782.12357111126955488754.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

If anyone would be interested in subscribing to, and participating in, a new
list, devoted to Indo-Iranian linguistics i.e. Vedic and Avestan phonology,
morphology, syntax and text linguistics, etc. I would be willing to set it
up and look after it.

I personally, as an (apprentice) Indo-Iranist and Vedicist have always felt
that such a list is missing. If anyone else feels the same, I would be happy
to fill the gap.
