Talking about scholarship and the sometimes inevitable overlap with
"political" issues, what do you guys make of the contention, recently
expressed in a book by David Frawley and Georg Feuerstein, that the
whole idea of an Aryan invasion is a western invention and that the
Indus civilization essentially disappeared because of a change in the
course of the Sarasvati river ? I found the book entertaining and well
argued, if at times a little manichean, because they too seem to discard
anything that won't fit with the point they want to make, but the
debunking of the "invasion" I found convincing because it does seem that
the alledged "invasion" was never proved by much, if anything.
Am I wrong ?
If Indology taught the Arian invasion for more than a century and if
that was wrong, shouldn't authoritative scholars in the field publish
papers acknowledging the mistake of their predecessors ?
