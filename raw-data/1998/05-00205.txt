"Altaic peoples" in the Ukraine 4000-3500 BC?  Impossible.

The first signs of r-Turkic tribes (Huns, Xiongnu) moving into the
Eastern steppe are from the last centuries BC.  Before that, there is
abundant and overwhelming evidence (e.g. written records in
Khwarezmian, Sogdian, Saka (Khotanese), Scytho-Sarmatian and
Bactrian, borrowings into Finno-Ugrian and Slavic lgs., etc.) that
the steppe (both Eastern and Western) was inhabited by Iranian
peoples.
