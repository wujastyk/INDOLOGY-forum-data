Just some speculative comments.  The word mo.dasii is probably related to
the verb mo.da.ne "to break, to be broken" in Marathi.  A fractured hand
can be described as: haat mo.dalaa.  But when one feels muscle fatigue
during flu, one can say anga mo.duun aale aahe : lit. "my body is all
broken up."  By extension, the same verb is used to describe cramps of the
stomach : po.taat ka.l mo.da.ne.  I suppose the word mo.dasii is related
to stomach cramps in the course of Cholera.
