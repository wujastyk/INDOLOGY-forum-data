I have recently come across references to the gosava rite. I looked it up
in Kane, History of D-sastra, which has apparently only a word or two on
it, and I am afraid that here I lack decent resources to search more on my
own. Could someone point me to what must at some point have grabbed the
attention of some scholar with a taste for the bizzare?  (Please give me
enough of a reference to order materials by InterLibrary Loan!).  many
thanks!
