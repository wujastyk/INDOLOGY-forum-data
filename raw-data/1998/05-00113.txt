Members,

Returning to the horse discussion,

Georg v S. seems to make a reasonable point here. I don't see why he

On the other hand, it would not seem unreasonable that there might be
little representation of the horse generally in India for a long time to
come if our primary written sources are texts such as the Rg Veda (or for
that matter ANY of the early Skrt texts) which only represent a very small
minority of the population.  It seems to me to expect otherwise would be
to expect that there was a flood of Aryans who invaded the region.  It
does not seem likely that that was the case.
