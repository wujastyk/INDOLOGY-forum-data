I've been reading this thread with great interest (just knew that hanging
out here would pay off eventually), and since the question of technique
has come up I'd like to raise a couple of points.

Firstly, the word 'pancake' as used in this context needs clarification. I
believe that in the 'occidental' sense it is use for the cooked result of
thin batter poured on to a hot griddle. (so dosai would be 'pancake', as
would aappam)

The methods described here refer to various ways of making 'breads' of
various kinds. (so all the other items probably classify as 'bread' or
'roti).

If the technique and etymology are to be used in understanding the history
of these entities, I believe this distinction is important. I think that
Avinash Sathaye made this point in his posting.
