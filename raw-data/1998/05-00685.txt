In my earlier posting, the discussion on DEDR listing of "pukai" should read
as given below.

DEDR 4235 shows "Ta. pukai smoke, mist, vapour, steam; (-v-, -nt-) to smoke
emit vapor or steam; (-pp-, -tt-) ?to cause to smoke?;.... pukAr ?mist, fog,
haze?.....Te, poga, pova smoke, fume; pogayu, povayu to smoke; pogucu, pogacu,
pogapu (K. also) pogapu to smoke, fumigate, fry, season with spices; pogapu,
pogupu, frying, seasoning with spices......" (DEDR has missed to include the
meaning seasoning for the Tamil entry.)

Please note the correction. Thanks.
