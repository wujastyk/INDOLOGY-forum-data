Subject: A question on brahmins as messengers
Message-ID: <161227039471.23782.5165227243735705111.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In the Indo-Aryan texts, is there any tradition of brahmins serving as
messengers? If so, how old is it and how do they carry the message - just
orally or in writing? Thanks in advance for any information.
