TO:
Anybody having this problem:

The suggestion is to register a web based
e-mail account. Available for free at
many locations. Let us say, from
hotmail site. (This idea & hotmail was
started by an Indian.) or from Yahoo, ...

Register a free account at http://www.hotmail.com
If you send messages from that account to Indology,
no attachments. This will save money for those
who pay by number of words they receive and bandwidth.

If need be, after the problem is resolved,
you can go back to the original account.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
