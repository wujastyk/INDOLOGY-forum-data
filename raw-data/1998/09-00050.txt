Friends,

Breakthrough! So many claims have been made so far (cf. Possehl's Indus Age:
Writing System)that I am submitting this after careful deliberation and 18
years of work on an electronic comparative Indian lexicon.

37 pages of Decipherment of Indus Script: Preliminary Hieroglyphic Dictionary
have been posted as PDF and MSWORD documents. Only lexemes, 
as attested in one or more Indian languages are matched with the glyphs.

URL: http://sarasvati.simplenet.com

Language? Indic (of the Indian Sprachbund ca. 3000 BC in Sarasvati and Sindhu
River Valleys--from Ga_ndha_ra to Lothal, from Shahr-i-Sokhta to Rupar). 
Contents? Bronze-age Weapons. 
Writers? Metal- and Fire-workers who could engrave on copper plates. 

No wonder, India was, perhaps,the only ancient region in the world which used
copper plates for recording property transactions and gifts.

Would deeply appreciate receiving critical comments and suggestions.

Thanks and best regards, 

Kalyanaraman
