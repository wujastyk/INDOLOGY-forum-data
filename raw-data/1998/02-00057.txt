Subject: "Curry" and its origins?
Message-ID: <161227035430.23782.5501401248767601517.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Knowledge about curry came in Europe right from the beginning of 16th
century through the Portuguese, most probably from Goa region. The name in
Kanna.da is ka.di. There is a kind of cookery book in medieval Kanna.da,
entitled Suupa 'saastra, composed by Mangaarasa in the 15th century. It
describes ka.di as a preparation consisting of balls of uLu.n.du (Phaseolus
radiatus) and rice well ground, mixed in equal quantity with salt, pepper,
cumin, curry-leaves and coriander; the ball is fried in oil; and when
cold,it is dripped in butter-milk.
