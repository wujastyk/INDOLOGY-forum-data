Fyi,
I forwarded the above quote to Gary Holland, who wrote back to me that he
had noticed the missing of these stanzas three years ago.
As far as I know, van Nooten & Holland worked last year on a revised
edition of their RV (HOS 50), which may come out, perhaps, in another year.

With best wishes,
