Hi,

Apropos moving over to TeX, I have actually used nothing other than TeX to
write papers etc. with for years. However, it is not a very good file format
to actually store information in, since the source files look like
gobbledegook, and sometimes you need to do other things than just reading
your texts. Also, the Harvard Rigveda is in CSX coding, and I see no reason
to convert it to anything else, as it is very readable (as long as you solve
the font problems I have come up against) and TeX accepts CSX coded text
direct.
