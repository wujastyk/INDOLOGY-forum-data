A compound with iSTa could be "the One who is desired as field" but I don't
know any other such compound. Perhaps a mistake for kRSISTha "best of the
fields", comparatives can be formed from nouns, like brahmiSTha (and
Homeric basileuteros "better king", basileutatos "best of the king").
In both cases the meaning could be "in You, I would like to grow".
Not sure. Trying to help,
Dominique
