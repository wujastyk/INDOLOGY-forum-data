century?) says: "From one side of 'Siva's drum comes Sanskrit
letters and the other side gives birth to Tamil
letters." This myth is retold in Kanchi purANam also.

(((Aside: Relations between Kashmir Saivism
and Southern Agamic and Tamil Saiva SiddhAntam  need to be explored
much further. Dance is celebrated in many poems of sangam texts.
Siva's dance is portrayed vividly many times in Tirumantiram,
CilappatikAram, Karaikkal Ammai's (fifth century) decads
of songs, Tevaram etc., For entry of Dance in Sanskrit
tradition, a) Indu Sekhar, Origin and decline of Sanskrit
drama, b) S. A. Srinivasan, On the origin of Natyasastra,
For Nataraja concept, see Zvelebil, AnandatANDava mUrti.
A. Danielou, While the Gods play talks of Dravidian
part in SaivAgamas. Compared to Tamil sources, Siva's dance
in Mahabharata and Kumarasambhava are meagre, only a
couple of words. Kalidasa more over, has Southern connexions
(cf. G. Hart's works)))).



d) Inspired by Avalokitezvara:
------------------------------

 Ayum kuNattu avalOkitan2 pakkal akattiyan2 kETTu
 Eyum puvan2ikku iyampiya taNTamiz IGku uraikka
 nIyum uLaiyO? en2il, 'karuTan2 cen2Ra nIL vicumpil
 Iyum paRakkum', itaRku en2 kolO collum! EntizaiyE.

                                     - puttamittiran2Ar,
                                        (11th century)

 This is from a 11th century grammar, ViiracOziyam.
 Its author is puttamittiran2 (Buddhamitra), the
 Chieftain of PonpaRRi naaDu.

 He says in the foreword (paayiram) of the book that
 AvalOkitiisvara taught Tamil to Agastya first.
 In such explicit terms, Avalokitezvara never inspires
 Panini in Sanskrit texts at all.

    "My dear girl, adorned with jewels!
       My attempt at explaining Tamil grammar
       which Agastya learnt from Avalokitesvara,
        is like a house fly trying to follow
        the Garuda's path in the big sky."


Summary:
---------

Tamil (its grammar), Agastya, Potiyil (Potalaka), 'Siva
are intimately related in all possible combinations
in post-classical Tamil literature all the time.
'Siva inspiring Panini within the Paninian tradition
is told for the first time by Haradatta of Chola area.
Around 10th century, manjusrimulakalpa, which may well be Southern,
tells Avalokitezvara awarded 'srAvakabodhi enligtenment
to Panini. Outside the Paninian tradition, Hsuan Tsang
 narrates Panini being inspired by 'Siva in 'Salatura.
 This story he might have heard during his years
in the South. However Tsang might have narrated it during his
travelogue writing on 'Salatura and its most famous son, Panini.
In any case, there is no association of 'Siva and
Panini before Hsuan Tsang. No Sanskrit text tells us
that Avalokitezvara inspired Panini to write his grammar
whereas in Tamil viiracOziyam tells us that
Avalokitezvara taught Tamil grammar to Agastya.

Lokesh Chandra,1979, ODDiyAna: a new interpretation says:
"the acculturation of 'Siva into Buddhist tradition
may have takenplace in South India and thence it was
transmitted to Indonesia where 'Siva-Buddha
syncretism was deeply entrenched."

Given that 'Siva teaches Tamil grammar to Agastya is attested
early in Tamil and that competing Buddhist and Hindu claims
originate and evolve both in Southern Sanskrit and Tamil
texts, then these ideas about Panini's inspirers travelled
northward.
