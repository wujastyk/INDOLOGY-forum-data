Other than Mendeleev's use of eka- there is the word antarafacial, (from
Skt. antara-) and there is the compound called anandamide, a
neurostimulant. Can't think of any other scientific term using Indian
words. (Wasn't there an Indology list discussion about this, a year or
so ago?) Indian/Skt. terminology seems to have entered only chemistry.
Physics and biology seem immune to it.
