    Dear All
    
    Thought you might find this interesting!
    
      -----------------------------------------------------
      PRE-COLUMBIAN MAIZE IN CHINA AND INDIA?
    
      The evidence of maize in archaeological sites in
      China and its depiction in Hoysala Temples in India,
      both dated before the 15th century A.D., suggests
      that this domesticated crop was diffused by human
      action before the arrival of Columbus in the New
      World. The implications of this evidence are of
      great magnitude, since the presence of maize in Asia
      indicates that humans were able to migrate between
      both hemispheres; more than likely through trans-
      oceanic means of travel.
      -----------------------------------------------------
    
    This comes from an article by Carl Johannessen and
    Anne Z. Parker, "Maize Ears Sculptured in 12th and
    13th Century A.D. India as Indicators of Pre-Columbian
    Diffusion," Economic Botany 43 (2), 1989, pp. 164-180.
    
    Just in case anyone is REALLY interested, I've attached
    some (what I think) useful WEB pages.  The first is
    Carl Johannessen's own page at University of Oregon.
    The second from the University of Ohio, also talks about
    the same thing, and has a rather useful bibliography.
    The last is an article from the Maize Genetics Cooperation
    Newsletter, called, "Antiquity of Maize in India".  It's
    by M. Kumar and JKS Sachan from Rajendra Agricultural
    University in India.  They also suggest that maize being
    grown in the very remote Northeastern Himalayan tracts
    adjoining Burma and Tibet, could be further evidence of
    possible pre-Columbian introduction.
    
    I hope this stimulates interest!
    
    I'd be interested to hear what people think.
    
    And anyone who knows any more about the subject, I'd be
    grateful for some illumination and further leads.
    
    All the best
