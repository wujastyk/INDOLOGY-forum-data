My guess is that this is a reference to Siva-rAmanAtha at a little known
rAmakshetra in northern Karnataka, not to rAmanAtha at the Setu. If I
remember right, this rAmakshetra is the site of an old battlefield, on
the Tungabhadra. Some of the Calukya-Cola battles were fought here.

Well, the vIraSaiva poets refer to specific temples of Siva. The
situation is not very different with the dAsakUTa poets, and it is not
really a stylistic change within Kannada poetry. Each name has strong
geographical connotations, e.g. Pandharpur, Hampi. The dAsas take their
names after the particular temple/form of vishNu to which/whom they
relate their dAsa-hood. Rather than putting their own names into their
songs, they have changed their names to reflect their religious
sentiment. In each case, the song carries only the name of the God the
poet regards as his/her own.
