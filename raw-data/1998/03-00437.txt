Conference on Religion in South India
Annual Workshop, University of Florida, Gainesville

Thursday evening, June 19--Sunday noon, June 22, 1998


Theme: Nocturnal Realities in South Indian Religions

This year's workshop will focus on the many ways in which Night
figures in South Indian religious life.  Topics such as night as a
temporal locale for ritual performance, night as a symbol in poetic
expression, night as a conceptual category (e.g., night = darkness)
in philosophical and psychological discourses (e.g., night=
ignorance or psychological trauma), night as a context for
religio-cultural/political events (e.g., cinema, political rallies,
etc.)  Presentations may include detailed studies of particular
texts, rituals, or events; and/or comparative explorations between
traditions within South India and its diasporas.

The Conference on Religion in South India (CRSI) was formed in 1971
to support the academic study of religious traditions in South India
and its areas of influence elsewhere.  The CRSI sponsors an annual
workshop in an informal setting where scholars can present their
work at various stages of completion in a more extended and leisurely
setting than most scholarly conferences can provide.  It is an
independent organization and is financially self-supporting.  Emory
University provides administrative support for publicizing the
workshops.
