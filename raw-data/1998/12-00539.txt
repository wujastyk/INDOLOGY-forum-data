Hello Claude

I happen to jave written a review of a book by a logician about religion. If
you can read Dutch you can look it it yourself: 'Tot in der eindigheid' by
J.P van Bendegem (ISBN 90 5240 425 9). What I found remarkable is that many
arguments against common articles of belief are not only put into words but
also into strict logical formulae, so that you can see that they're
waterproof (if you are familiar with logical symbols that is). The
observation that maths has something to do with religious believe is
underscored in the book by a criticism of the concept of ethernity, which
is accordig to the writer one of main the causes of the fallacy of believe
in a god.
The discussion about human or divine concepts has already been decided by
Xenophon, one of the first European philosophers: 'if horses could speak
they would adore gods with horses heads'.
