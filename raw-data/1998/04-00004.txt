On the other hand, it shows Horses may be found in North India in the
future. The evidences of horses in South India,
(even in Sri Lanka) from megalithic burials dating from much
before 400 BC makes it a high possibility.

Or, the flood plains, population pressure, invasions
in North India over the centuries. Have they destroyed
the evidence.
