Dear Dr. Simson,

In a message dated 98-12-11 09:57:32 EST, you write:

<< This is the kumbha that later on
 (51.17) is given to the brahmin who in the Pali MPS is called doNa and in
 the Sanskrit version dhUmrasagotra. >>

I would appreciate if you could give the traditional explanation of the name
dhUmrasagotra. Also is this a common name for brahmins? Thanks in advance.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
