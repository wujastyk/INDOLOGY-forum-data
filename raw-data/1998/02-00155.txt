        Thanks. That seems a good explanation but open an other request.
The MMW dictionary (s.v. lokapAla) gives, refering to Mn.V,96, the list:
E: indra
SE: agni
S: yama
SW: sUrya
W: varuNa
NW: pavana or vAyu
N: kubera
NE: soma or candra
and he gives the variants nirRti for SW and IzAnI or pRthivI for NE.
        This list seems without any structure. How it is theologically
explained? I can't believe the choice was randomly made!
        Best,
Dominique
