Just as an FYI:

There was some very intersting news on the BBC today about
Turkmen horses.

It seems that these horses (heard it as ako teki ? ) are the
finest in the world, and far superior to the Persian horses.
A story about a Persian King offering all his wealth for a
few of these horses was mentioned. Only about 2500 of these
horses are remaining and they have been in Turkmenistan
from about 3500-4000 years. Many were slaughtered for meat
during Soviet times.
Also, these horses seem to have been forgotten
only in the past 200 years or so, and there are stories of how
these horses have been exported to Greece in the ancient past!.

With commercialization, these horses are all set to storm the
Western racing circles in the very near future.

Also, ako teki (anyway it sounded like that) reminds me
of azvatara :)

So we might be in for some radical rethinking on the horse
evidence as well, and this will have  implications
for  Indology.  Questions thathave been raised on this list about
the assumptions made about Aryans and Horses seem very valid.

As it was mentioned on the list sometime ago:
Afghanistan, could very well have been azvasthana.

I will appreciate it if anyone
has more info (references) on these horses .

It just gets curiouser and curiouser.
