Prof. Aklujkar wrote about the authorship of the SDS:

"...Saaya.na-maadhava was the editor or presenter of the
final version (probably as the head of a committee of
pa.n.ditas or as an appontee of the ruler)."

I think this is as close as we can get at the moment in
assessing the involvement of Saaya.na/Maadhava with the SDS.

Prof. Aklujkar continued:

">As I recall, Prof. Kunjunni Raja had come to the same
conclusion as Professor Anantlal Thakur in an article published
sometime after 1981 (I have access to a list of Kunjunni
Raja's publications until 1981. I could not locate in it
the article I was looking for. Hence my guess that it was
probably published after 1981)."

Prof. Anantlal Thakur published an article "Cannibha.t.ta
and the Authorship of the SDS," in The Adyar Library
Bulletin 25, 1961, 524-538. I have not seen
an article on this issue by Prof. Kunjunni Raja,
if you find the reference, I am very much interested
in it. Thank you.

As for Zankaradarzana (the 16th chapter of the SDS), in Cowell
and Gough's editions and translations that chapter is missing,
including the 6th reprint of the translation of 1961. I have
not checked the Chowkhamba editions past that year mentioned.

In recent Indian editions of the SDS in Sanskrit, including
the one from Anandasrama, the 16th chapter is included.
I wonder why in some of those earlier editions the SDS ends
with the Patanjala darsana and only mentions
that Vedanta is dealt with elsewhere. If anyone knows
where that elsewhere is/was, please share it with us.
Also where did the 16th chapter come from
in those editions and translations that have it?
How do we know that it is identical with the "one elsewhere"?
