        I suspect that, behind rhetoric and humour, you intend to give
symmetric roles to both adversaries. I'm afraid you're wrong. The "cause"
of the AI/M "protagonists" is not an holy one, just a scholary one.
        Regards,
Dominique

PS (without any link, I hope so): Congratulations to the Indian Government
for their great step towards the end of this horrible Kaliyuga...
