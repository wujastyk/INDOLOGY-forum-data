Last February I assisted at the jain centre at Sravanabelgola a puja
performed by rahmin priests  at the feet of Bahubali. The priests told me
that they were brahmins of tantric traditions and were performing this puja
daily at the request of the Jain Mutt. The brahmin priests perform the
abhisekas of the Jain Thirthankaras. You could get more information from a
Jain source person who welcomed our study groupe:Mrs. Babitha Pramod kumar
