Actually I think it does. But it is not terribly old, at least not in the
modern sense. The journal Discover ran a feature (rather large) on race and
the history of race research and race theories a couple of years ago. I am
sorry I can't give you any details, because I sent the copy I had to my
daughter. However, it is a quite useful set of articles, which I recommend.
