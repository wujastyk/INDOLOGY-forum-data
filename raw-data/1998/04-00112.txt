the peculiar situation in which zukra had been placed. From what I
remember of the story of yayAti,( not sure though) there was a situation
where zukra tried to approach the devas but was forced to go back to the
danavas.It may have been possible that dikshitar was trying to
illustrate this attempted change of status through this
quick change of vibhakti.

Regards,
Krishna
