Thanks to Elliot M. Stern, whose ability to trace ;saastra citations I have
now admired for a long time,  for confirming what I recalled concerning the
line  prayojanam anuddi;sya na mando 'pi pravartate. He saved me a trip to
the bookshelves.

The discussion reminds me of questions I have meaning to ask. Is anyone
working on a critical edition of any of Kumaarila's works? Does anyone have
computer/electronic/digitized versions of any of Kumaarila's works? --
