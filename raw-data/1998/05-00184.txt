I think that they only mention that horses occur to some extent in
mythology.  Horses certainly were not that important in the material
culture of early Europeans or Persians.  Maybe for use in war they were
 important.

The earliest domesticated horses associated with human remains do not
suggest Indo-Europeans.  The people were much more like the Altaic
peoples who inhabit the Steppe.  However, according to the logic used
in this thread horses in China and Japan translates to IE migrations
to these regions.  Obviously there is no evidence that this is the
case.

But as I've already stated there are many possible explanations
including trade.  We certainly are not forced to conclude that the
introduction of horses proves an "Aryan" migration into India.
Indeed, there are morphological differences between early Indian
horses and Central Asian ones that suggest a very gradual
introduction.
