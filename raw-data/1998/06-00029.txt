I think the problem is the angle. I think that no person with the slightest amount of common sense is applauding the latest fireworks of the party of Bombs Jabber and Poverty. But India is not alone. Other countries like France made the same mistake fairly recently. But what amazed me was the almost total absence of any antinuclear protest, like we've seen in France. Such demonstrations can count as kind of a slight rehabilitation. But they didn't happen in mother Bharat. Gandhi must be turning and tossing in his grave! I wonder if the popularity of the RAmAyana and Bhagavad GItA are causing this blindness. The real battle of power is going on in the field of economy and India (and Pakistan of course) are going down here. The battle on the nuclear field is over, since most politicians understand that nobody can win a nuclear war and the possession of nuclear weapens is very expensive and full of risks. 
Rama and Arjuna are no executives, but fighters who use mythical nuclearish weaponry to defie the bad guys. Maybe many Indians see the atom bomb just as a new episode of one of their great epics. My suggestion would be therefore to look at the question: 'in what way and to what extend does Indian mythology influence Indian economics and politics?'
