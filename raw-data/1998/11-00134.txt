I am a computer scientist and engineer.

We have these problems with freshman students in comp sci. They think
they
will spend the next 4 years learning to program in umpteen languages.

Does being a linguist mean being able to converse in umpteen languages?
In my school people who do that are in the Department of Foreign
Languages.

I am sure that in at least one of your courses, you have learned how to
read things that are written and not read things that are not written.
I know that mathematical precision is not one of the hallmarks of being
a historical linguist but even for a fuzzy field there must be some
rules in which one can know the difference between slight exaggaration
and inaccuracy.

I think I alread wrote about this. This is called "fallacy of argument
from authority". And there is also another fallacy of association. An
example
goes like this:
        This guy is black. Blacks have never achieved great standing
        in science. So there is no reason to pay attention.

There is really a very good reason why problems like this occur. It has
to
do with ignorance. If I ask the question "Does a qumquat look more like
a
quince or kiwi?" one must know what all 3 look like to make a decision.
All IEnists see only IE words. That is natural because that is their
area. But Altaicists should see Altaic words, but since most of them
come from
Europe, they don't see them. Then having formed a closed fraternity for
200 years they then blame everyone else who do not see things that way
as "ethnic chauvinists". That is very funny, especially for people who
were instrumental in creating the great "Aryan Racist Philosophy" of the
20th century.

There has to be neutral referee.

That great neutral referee has existed for 500 years.

It is math, and its branch of probability theory is younger but is
available for all those not too pompous.

Turan was an Etruscan goddess of fertility.

Perhaps you failed logic (if you ever took such a course) and
probably never took a probability theory course. That explains why
your reasoning processes are mixed up, to say the least.

But fortunately there are others who might see things differently.

Amen!

Let's start from scratch, and get rid of creating a truth by
assertion and by popular vote.

That is one of the things holding up the present state of affairs.
