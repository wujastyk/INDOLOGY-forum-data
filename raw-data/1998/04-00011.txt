Thanks for the forwarded message. I came across the same information
late last month. It seems that Vishnudevananda was slated to succeed
Santananda, but predeceased him. I'm not sure when he passed away.
Santananda passed away only in December 97, and was succeeded by
Vasudevananda, who is a different person. Should I update the text, or
add a short note at the end?

Vidyasankar
