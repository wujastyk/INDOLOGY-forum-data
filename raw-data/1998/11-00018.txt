Dear Dr. Vidal,

Can you please explain this IE characterstic more? What are the basic
publications on this?

Read that IVC was more egalitarian and only ancient
civilization to do so; no king's tombs found,
not much of social hierarchy, ...

As far as India, can I take this to be
hierarchic -> varna theory
meat-eating -> beef in vedic; am'sala 'fatty' meat
                ('tender' in Eggeling's translation)
milk drinking -> cow's prominence in the veda
                 (IVC gives importance to oxen, NO cow on seals!)
male-dominace -> Goddess is a minor deity in Vedic.
                 Her importance grows in later Hinduism.
                 (Pinchman, The rise of the Goddessin Hindu tradiion)

Any corrections? additional references?

Regards,
N. Ganesan
