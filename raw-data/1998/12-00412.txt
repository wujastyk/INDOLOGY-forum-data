Dear Sujatha:

I have looked at the article. It does not make sense linguistically. The
so-called Dravidian words cited from Burrow and Emeneau are hardly
recognizable. except one, the word meaning 'sandals' (Proto-Dr. *kerppu). It
could be a chance resemblance. The person who wrote this article is not a
linguist, to be sure.
Bh.K.
