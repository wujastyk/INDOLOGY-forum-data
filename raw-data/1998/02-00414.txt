Subject: CSX fonts
Message-ID: <161227036081.23782.7926629900200108795.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hello,

Thanks for your answer to my question. I actually forgot to mention in my
last message that the Washington Indic .PK fonts work fine under TeX. But
then TeX is a world unto itself anyway.

I have actually solved the problem since I last wrote, purely by luck, by
changing over to a different Windows 95 text editor (Ultra Edit). This can
handle the Indic truetype fonts perfectly well. I should be able to use this
encoding directly within TeX, if I have understood the Itrans documentation
properly, and thus not have to rewrite about 2000 examples in my thesis.

I would still not mind knowing why those characters were missing in Linux
though.


Thanks for your help,


DB
