Why kitchen? Away from religion, why not the workplace of, say, a
jeweller? (see Banawali evidence). The small 'bath' was perhaps
essential to store water used to cool off the embers. Bones have been
used in ancient metallurgy as reducing, 'oxidizing' agents for baser
metals in the ma_ks.ika_ or pyrite ores. (see the RV reference in the
context of soma.)

Prof. Witzel is right; we can get what we want to see.
