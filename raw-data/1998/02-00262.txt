Subject: BUDDHIST REJECTION OF MUSIC
Message-ID: <161227035791.23782.4146030463624500902.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The buddhistmonks, at least in Theravada, are not allowed to listen to
music, but why? What is in fact the definition of music according to the
buddhists?

So far I have found litte materials regarding the(se) subject(s) and will
be very happy to receive and answers and/or references, both to primary-
and secondary texts.

Thank you!

Jon
