What immediately comes to mind are:

"The Hindu Temple" by Stella Kramrisch (Calcutta 1946; reprinted in Delhi
1976 by Motilal Banarsidass), and

"Architecture, Time and Eternity. Studies in the Stellar and Temporal
Symbolism of Traditional Buildings" by Adrian Snodgrass, Delhi 1990), where
extensive bibliography.
