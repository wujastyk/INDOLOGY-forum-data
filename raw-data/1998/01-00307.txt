There is a Tamil text called "peruGkatai". This is the story of king udayaNa.
While there are apparently several versions of this story in IndoAryan, the
Tamil text is believed to be based on the Sanskrit version. In this text,
there is a character called "cAtaka" of the potter caste, who is an aide of
yUgi, udayaNa's minister. cAtaka acts as a messenger between udayaNa's
ministers when udayaNa is imprisoned. When udayaNa is regains his kingdom, he
rewards him with a  title(?) called "peruGkuyam" (great "kuya") and two
towns/villages. The text is given below.

"............cAtakan2 en2n2um
kuLalaRku ERpap peruGkuyam aruLi
iruntu in2itu uRaiken2a  iraNTu Ur Ittu"    (vatsa canto, peruGkatai
4.9.47-49)

It will be nice to know if the author koGkuvEL is faithfully reproducing what
is in the IA texts or he is inserting customs prevailing in south India. Does
anybody know what is said in Prakrit/Sanskrit texts? What is the honor given
to the potter called? Thanks in advance.
