Does anyone have a good translation for epic 'daivam'?

'Fate' or 'destiny' seem to be terms which have very little relation to
pre-classical kshatriya culture.

I am aware of Shulman's article in the Heesterman Festschrift, but that is
not conclusive.

Devaat Aagatam does not really help us too much in explaining what is action for an epic kshatriya.

I can make a wild guess (have not got Mayrhofer available, so you must take this for what it is). 

Could daiva be connected to the root div (gamble)? In that case, a translation might be "chance", and daivaat could mean "by chance", "accidentally". 

Just a thought...
