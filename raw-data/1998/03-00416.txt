Dear Readers,

Here is an extract from my page on Origins of the Caste System in
Ancient India. I seek critical feedback from Indologists on the
hypothesis given below:
__________________________________________________
Caste is an institution which is truely Indian in character. So much
so that even the Concise Oxford Dictionary defines it as, Hindu
hereditary class, with members
socially equal, united in religion, and usually following same trades
having no social intercourse with persons of other castes. The word
caste itself is derived from the
Spanish word 'Casto' which means pure or chaste. In the Indian lexion
we refer to caste by the words 'Varna' meaning colour and 'Jati' which
is derivedfrom the
root syllable 'Ja' which means 'to be born'.

But etymology apart what matters is that Casteism is today still a
living, rather festering, practice which continues to plague our 20th
century Indian society. Time
and again our newspapers carry reports about caste wars in various
parts of our country. While reading about Parliamentary news in
newspapers, we come across
references to the Jat Lobby, Maratha Lobby, Rajput Lobby, Brahmin
Lobby which brings to the fore the fact that even at the highest level
of our country's
democratic institutions, caste as a factor is still a living one. And
this brought to be so as in the electoral strategies of political
parties we hear of caste vote banks,
caste equations in voting patterns, caste-based reserved
constituencies, caste politics, ad nauseam.

All this alongwith the recurring caste carnages and the ongoing caste
politics are a constant reminder to us Indians that caste and casteism
which we have inherited
from our history are still active and alive around us. Thus the
institution and attitude both of which go into the making of caste and
casteism in today's India remain an
enigmatic one for Indians as also for foreign Indologists. The fact
that casteist feelings are still part of our psyche make it all the
more relevant that we are informed
about how the institution of caste could have come into being.

Possible Origins of the Caste System

Our scriptures already have an answer to this. The Purusha Sukta of
the Rig Veda says that the four fold division of society into Brahmins
(priests), Kshatriyas
(warriors), Vaishyas (cultivators) and Shudras (menial servants) has
