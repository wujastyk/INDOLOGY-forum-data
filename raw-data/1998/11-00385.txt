Dear list-members,

In January I tried in vain to purchase some topo-sheets of Pandharpur
taluka at the local office of the Survey of India in Pune. The reason I
got for not being allowed to buy them was that I needed a permit to take
them out of India.

Have anyone of you any experience of how and where to get such a
permit?

Thank you

Erik Reenberg Sand
