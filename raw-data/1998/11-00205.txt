   The rate of language change in preliterate societies is
   usually high, rather than "extremely slowly".
   In subsaharan Africa, thousands of  nonliterary languages/dialects
   in the Bantu family exist because they did not develop writing.
   Writing definitely has a conservative effect.

   Once Andree Sjoberg, the linguist who studies Altaic, Dravidian
   languages told me something like:
   "Look at English grammar, it has changed greatly in the last
   500 years. Whereas agglutinative languages like Dravidian
   don't change that much. The amazing thing about India is
   even though Sanskrit became the 'prestige/high status' language
   after ca. 1500 B.C., the effect on its grammar by 'low status'
