The former classification had Hamito-Semitic (which included Cushitic)
together as a subfamily of Afro-Asiatic. According to Greenberg,
Cushitic and Semitic are not part of the same subfamily.

Those considerations were provided by anthropologists and they still
exist but in a new form. The Caucasoid blood is still seen in
Semitic-Berber people, and is still thought to have penetrated among the
more "civilized" peoples of Africa like the Ethiopians.  However, other
Caucasoid penetration involved adopting "native" languages.  And
"Hamitic" and "Semitic" languages are still genetically related as
Afro-Asiatic, only the important "white" Hamitic languages are no longer
more closer related to Cushitic which could open some unwanted
possibilites in the minds of some.

Now, Greenberg has come up with a scheme that attempts to group Uralic,
Altaic, Indo-European and even some American Indian languages into a
great herrenvolk tongue originating from the Near East (Mt. Ararat).
Now that is really the great joke that so obviously smacks of 20th
century hyperdiffusionist theories.
