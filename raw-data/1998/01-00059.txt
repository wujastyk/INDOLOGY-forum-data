Himal Conference on South Asian Mediocrity
2-3 May 1998 (Sat-Sun), Kathmandu

Himal, the South Asian Magazine, is organising a conference on South
Asian Mediocrity in Kathmandu on 2-3 May 1998. The conference will
seek to identify and explain the levels of mediocrity found in all
aspects of South Asian life, from scholarship, business, politics to
media, architecture and public health. The gathering will strive to
survey the levels of mediocrity and understand why South Asians lag
ever-further behind in terms of our economies, culture(s),
intellectualism and self-image. Is it true that South Asians were
generally less mediocre four decades ago than today? What is it
anyway, 'nature' or 'nurture'?

Scholars, specialists and generalists from across disciplines and
national boundaries will come together in Kathmandu to present papers
that are not necessarily restricted by theme, country or philosophical
orientation. All discussions will be held in plenary, with a panel
reacting to paper presentations to be followed by audience
participation.

Himal welcomes all who are interested in participating in the
conference. To know more, check Himal magazine or our web site. You

Most frequently asked questions about the Himal Conference on South
Asian Mediocrity:

Q. Is this a joke?
A. No, this is dead serious.

Q. But is it not negative?
A. No, this is among the most positive of exercises Himal has been
involved in in its ten years.

Q. Do the conference papers themselves have to be mediocre to be
accepted? A. No, we will have the best minds of South Asia presenting
papers. Q. What if after all the trouble the conference turns out to
be poor? A. Not to worry. It will only reflect the state of our
politics, economics, scholarship, showmanship, sportsmanship,
penmanship... Anyway, it is up to you.
