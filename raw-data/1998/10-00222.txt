Hello Luis,

you are probably right. As you may have noticed, the message below is something I received from an acquaintance here in Norway. The way to find out if it is columbia rather than colombia, is to send two identical messages to colombia.edu and columbia.edu. One of them will get through!

Lars Martin,

Shouldn't this be Columbia, in New York, instead of Colombia, in South
America?  (the email address would probably not work).

Best regards,
