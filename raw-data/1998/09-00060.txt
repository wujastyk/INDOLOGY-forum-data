Dear members of the Net,

I am looking for some information concerning S. R. Rao's decipherment of the Indus script. There is supposed to be a review of his work in the American Journal of Oriental Studies. I would be grateful for bibliographic references to this review, and also to any other reviews and discussions of Rao's books ("Lothal and the Indus Civilization"; "The Decipherment of the Indus Script"). 

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
