INDOLOGY list, and at the size of their lists. If this door were opened
we would find a lot of such postings, increasing bandwidth significantly,
to the detriment of our more modestly-funded members.

information they wish available to us.

In my view, the above two facilities surely meet the wishes of booksellers
and of us scholars very fully.


I accept the verdict of Dominik. As long as booksellers are able to tell us WHERE their lists may be found, the interests of both parties should be served. 

Best regards,
