Some weeks ago a message from the HINDU ONLINE was copied to
this site, reporting the find of copper plate grants in the West
Godavari district.
It was stated that
        Dr. N.S. Ramachandra Murthy
        Assistent Director
        State Archaeology Dept.
        Hyderabad
had deciphered the plates.
Does anyone have the mail or email address of Dr. Murthy?
Thanks,
Harry Falk
