Greetings

I am most grateful for your detailed help, typing all that out was
beyond the call of duty! I was (obviously!) not digging deeply enough,
or in the right areas of Ibn Battuta!! Thank you also for your further
references.
It would seem that the Black Death must have had enormous impact on the
social structures of India, as it did in other parts of the world. So
much has been written about its ravages upon European society, I am
surprised so little notice has been taken in Indian history.

Best Regards,
Mary
