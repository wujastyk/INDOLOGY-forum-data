It was a practice of that age. Alexander considered himself to be the
son of a greek god. Darius I claimed that he was favoured by gods.
The grandfather Asoka was Chadragupta who was a contemporary of
Alexander, knew about the Alexander legend. In addition we have
"na aviSnuH prithvIpatiH". So it is no wonder that Asoka claimed
himself to be dEvAnAmpiya.
