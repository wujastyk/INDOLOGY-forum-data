>?From the rhyme of the verse, it is obvious that the first vowel indeed is long
"O". As for the consonant, there is no evidence to consider it to be "g". In
fact, as I shall show later, it is most probably "k" and not "g". So the
correct form is decided as kOtukula using the standard transliteration scheme.

Then the next question is, what is the meaning of "kOtukula"? According to the
Tamil Lexicon, kotukulam refers to a caste called tUtar. It gives an
epigraphic citation as "kotukulac cavaiyAriR cUriyan2". A later publication,
KanniyAkumarik kalveTTukkal, pt.3, no.323, (TAS, v.6, pt.2, p.130) of 1532 AD
gives the revised reading as  "kotukulac cavaiyAril Ariyan2 cokkan2 periya
perumAL mAttANTap piramAtarAyan2". The title of "piramAtarAyan2" (= Skt.
brahmAdhirAjA) given to this person belonging to this sabha (cavai) shows he
was a brahmin. So the sabha must have been an assembly of brahmins. It leads
to the next question. Why was this assembly called kOtukula sabha?
