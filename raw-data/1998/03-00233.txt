Dear Indology List:

I inadvertently erased a message I did not intend to with the address
of an institute in South India which was collecting manuscripts
(and donations for their work).

It was posted on this list about 3 - 4 weeks ago. I am not speaking
of the one at the University of KErala headed by Dr. Thampi.

Thanks in advance,

Lynken Ghose
