This is actually begging the question. The phonemics of literary
Dravidian languages like Telugu gand Kannada was thoroughly
Sanskritised, and thus they do not have a completely "independent
phonology". One could also ask where Marathi etc. phonology comes
from.

Since phonology is constantly undergoing change in all languages, I
wonder whether we should make it a key criterion.
