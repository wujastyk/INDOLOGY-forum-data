<< Please note the genetive case of the Kannada word "kuuDala".  The word
"kuuDala sangama" would literally mean the Sangama of kuuDalu or kuuDali.
There is a place called "kuuDali", the confluence of the rivers Tunga and
Bhadra in Shimoga Dist of Karnataka.  Though it is also a Sangama, it is known
as "kuuDali" only.  There is also a place called "kuuDaluuru" at the
confluence of the river Tungabhadra and a stream.  We find reference to this
place in the inscription of 11th and 12th century AD.  After the famous "Hari-
hareshvara" temple was constructed several centuries ago, the old name was
lost and the place became popularly known as Harihar.

 There is another place called "tirumakuuDala-narasiipura" in Mysore Dist.
The derivation of the word is: "tiru + mukkuuDal + narasiipura.  It refers to
the place called "narasiipura" situated at the confluence of the rivers
Kaveri, Kapila and an under-current of a lake called SphaTika Sarovara.
Please note the word "mukkuuDal" which means the confluence of the three.
Something like the "TriveNi Sangama" in Allahabad. The influence of English in
modern times has made the place to be more popularly known as T.Narasipura.
There are many villages in Karnataka with such English abbreviations prefixing
the names.  Examples:  B.Durga, S.Bidare,  K.Bidare, H.Kalpanahalli,
B.Kalpanahalli.

 The kuuDala-sangama is the confluence of the two rivers namely KrishNaa and
Malaprabhaa.  There is also another Sangama called "muurumaTTi-sangama"  not
very far away from kuuDala-sangama.  It is the confluence of KrishNa and
GhaTaprabhaa rivers.  It has also an ancient temple.  The Kannada word
"kuuDala" may not, therefore, be used out of ignorance of the meaning of the
Sanskrit word "Sangama", but out of necessity to identify the place properly
in the daily life of the people.

In his book, A History of South India", K. A. Nilakanta Sastri says, "The
chAlukya invaders of gangavADi were driven back in disorder and heavily
defeated in a battle at kUDal-zangamam, that is kUDali at the junction of the
tunga and bhadra in the Mysore country. Somezvara's attempt to reverse the
verdict of Koppam thus ended in failure (1061-2)."

I would appreciate information on if kUDali was also ever called kUDala
sangama. Or is Sastri confusing two different places? (The Tamil inscriptions
of 11th century actually use the names "kUTal caGkamam". They do not use the
Sanskrit character "z". Sastri's transliteration of caGkamam as zaGkamam was a
hypercorrect transliteration one will find in works of his times.)
