The following comments are offered on these two points:

1. A sound method for decipherment of the IVC script is close at hand.
Stay tuned for the website (which will be unravelled in a few weeks)
with the clusters of IVC inscriptions and clusters of lexemes of the
Indian languages. [I don't know if the indigenous hypothesis will
survive or not.]

2. Fairservis, Kenoyer and (also Heras) called them clan signs; but
what were the names of these clans or alternatively, what were these
animals called in the lingua franca of the civilization? Why are the
tiger and antelope depicted with their heads turned? Parpola notes
that there is even a squirrel depicted, apart from snakes and birds;
of course even hoofed, horned, tailed persons, not excluding 'sex'
scenes; and perhaps, a field-mouse. What is the svastika_; is it a
sign or a pictorial motif?
