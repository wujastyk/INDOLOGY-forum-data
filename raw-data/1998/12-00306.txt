Well, it's not milk they use, but butter, made of yak-milk. This is a high-fat type of milk. Butter consists of far more fat than proteins, so salt doesn't spoil the structure. But you are right as to the moment of drinking this tea: immediately after its preparation. I guess this has something to do with the emulsion.
