Well, if you can find a Turkic word "asp-" with the appropiate
meaning.  Or any Turkic word "asp-" at all.

But what has Turkic *e:r, *erkek to do with PIE *wi:ros, or with
Herodotus' "oior"?

Indeed, all the old forms have t-.  The change to d- is recent, and
restricted to (Anatolian) Turkish.  That rules out any connection
with <tenger> (apart from the wrong vowel, the spurious -(ng)er/
-(ng)iz at the end, and the wrong meaning).  I don't care too much
for the etymology of "Caucasus", but the river names are surely
Iranian.  Forget about <deniz> and just look at Ossetian <don>
"water, river"...

Nope.  Attila *is* Gothic for "little father" (Vaterlein), no
assumptions required.

Yes, but not 'attila', with double -tt- and dimunitive suffix -ila.
Must be Gothic or Gepid.  Since most of Attila's subjects were
Germanic Ostrogoths and Gepids (actually, most would have been Slav
farmers, but those didn't count), there's nothing strange about that.
