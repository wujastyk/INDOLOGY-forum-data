Bunts are the largely (but certainly not entirely) agricultural community in southwestern Karnataka (around Udupi and Mangalore). Kurubas are traditionally (but again, no longer exclusively of course) shepherds; Kanakadaasa was a Kuruba by birth (from central Karnataka if I am not mistaken), but apparently a successful military man before he became a daasa.
