David Anthony, in his 1996 article, Shards of Speech says:
"Terms for wheel, axle and draft pole, and a verb meaning 'to go or
convey in a vehicle' suggest that PIE existed as a single language
after 3500 B.C., when wheeled vehicles were invented. PIE must have
begun to disintegrate before 2000 B.C.: by 1500 B.C. three of its
daughter languages - Greek, Hittie and Indic - had become quite
dissimilar. Altogether, then the linguistic evidence points to a
homeland between the Ural and Caucasus mountains, in the centuries
between 3500 and 2000 B.C."

The lower limit of Anthony's PIE breakup date is 2000 B.C. which is
closer to Drews' date. To an outsider like me, it looks as though
Anthony, like Drews, is saying that IE spread is mainly due
to chariotry.
