Hm. Not quite?. I think it depends upon how "human sacrifice" is treated in
practical life. It can for instance be regarded as a symbolic event and not
necessarily entail the killing of a human being. If we go back 2000 years or
so (or in Scandinavia, merely a 1000 years), human sacrifice was practiced
on a regular basis as part of a (mainstream) cult (e.g. at the "hov" in
Uppsala, where people were hanged as sacrifices to Odin/Wotan according to
Adam of Bremen). Hinduism does not practice human sacrifice as a matter of
course, to the contrary, there is very early a reaction against all sorts of
bloody sacrifices. The case reported here recently about a man who
sacrificed his son is in my opinion clearly pathological. So I still think
human sacrifices in India should be relegated to the field of psychiatry
rather than the field of Indology.
