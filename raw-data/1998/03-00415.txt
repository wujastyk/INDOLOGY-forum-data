Pas de probl?me, I don't think *kwet(wr)- and *ok^t- are related.
That's really impossible.  But if we can have two roots for IE "4"
(*kwetwr- and *mew- [Hittite  meu-, Luwian mawwa-]), having a third is
no unsurmountable problem.

As you say, it cannot be excluded that aSti- is a back-formation on
aSta:, analyzed as a dual.  It also cannot be excluded that *ok^toH(w)
*is* a dual and only Avestan has retained the original singular.

It is interesting to compare Proto-Kartvelian *os^txw- "four".
