Nowadays in China, "Potalaka" is firmly identified with
Putuo Shan, a mountain and small island off the coast
near Shanghai and Taiwan in the East China Sea.  It
is considered one of the "four sacred mountains" of
Chinese Buddhism.  Pilgrims and tourists go there.

Pl. see Yu Chun-fang's article, "P'u-t'o Shan: Pilgrimage and the
Creation of the Chinese Potalaka," in Susan Naquin and Chun-fang Yu,
editors, "Pilgrims and Sacred Sites in China" (Berkeley: University of
California Press, 1992).

Chinese Pu-to and Tibetan Potala palace are secondary derivations
after South Indian Potalaka.

The following is what I read on location of Potalaka.
In addition we have GaNDavyUha sUtram where Potalaka comes after
describing a string of Tamilnadu places. In any reference, there is
NO mention of Potalaka in the Northwest.
