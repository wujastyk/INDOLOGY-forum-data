I've been hesitant to thank Yarosslav, George, Jan, et al; for theier
follow-up on my original Transgression question b/c I did not want to put
this most interesting thread to bed.  Nonetheless, else I otherwise seem
ungrateful, please know that I have enjoyed everyone's comments, found
them useful, and hope that any further info continues to come to light.

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other
