Apologies for this, but:

A friend has sent me the following question:

A book called The Lost Years of Jesus is going to be published in Japanese
translation and the translator wants to know what was the reaction of
Indologists in the West to the theory that Jesus was in India and Tibet
during those 17 years.

Any references to debunking of this nonsense?  Many thanks in advance!
