Apart the fact that I wonder what "spheres of concepts" may mean, and as this
list is supposed to  discuss indological topics not personal prejudices, I'll
let medhAtithi (around the 8th century ?) answer to Dr. Fosse.

Commentary on Mn.8.318 : [Translation of Ganganatha Jha]  :
... people may have the following idea : - "protection of the people is not
possible without hurting (criminals), and protection serves the purpose of the
king; how then can the corporeal punishment be held to serve the purpose of
the
person punished?"
[...] why should protection of the people be not possible without the hurt
(involved in the punishment)? If the hurt is inflicted with the idea that if
the man were not punished, he would repeat the act, - this purpose could be
served even by reprimanding and such other means. If the idea be that on
seeing
him punished others would desist from similar acts, - the suffering meant
to be
caused could be brought about even by fines. Then again, even though criminals
are punished, thousands of men are found to do the same act again and again.
