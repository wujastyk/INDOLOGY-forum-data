I think that this old Kurd I talked to circa 1971 who said sex was
the "entertainment for poor people" knew more about sex and love than
you did :-)

Nobody else except people with full stomachs usually in 20th century
or royalty in earlier times could actually make a big deal of "love"
as opposed to sex. IT is usually a euphemism, and poor and hungry people
don't care if they screw sheep, and love is far from their minds.
