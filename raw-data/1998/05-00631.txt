Subject: Sarasvati: sa_gara, samudra; 'cults' and meanings
Message-ID: <161227039347.23782.13578685656853866701.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

hi,

How about 'device' as an alternative? Primarily because, the motif is
also used independently as a field symbol and in some tablets is shown
being carried on the shoulder of a person. Of course, it is integrally
linked with the 'one-horned heifer or bull' (or 'unicorn'). Note how
Dr. Sharan calls it a rhinoceros!

Regards,
k.
