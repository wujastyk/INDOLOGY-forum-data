In the Indian Lexicon containing 8000+ semantic clusters, not a single
reconstruction has been made of an assumed original root word. I have
clustered the lexemes as they are attested in the dictionaries of Punjabi_,
La_hn.d.a, Jat.ki (Jukes' dic.), Sindhi, Gujarati_, Ma_rwa_ri_, Western
Paha_r.i_, Bashkari_k (Dardic), Ga_ndha_ri_ (Dharmapada ed. J. Brough, Oxford
1962), Gar.hwa_li_, Gypsy, Bhojpuri_, Awadhi_, Kashmiri, lexemes attested in
Corpus Inscripionum Indicarum, Kumauni_, Brahui, Prakrit, Pali and Rigveda.
Since over 3000 lexemes of Dravidian Etyma (DEDR) are also so clustered, I am
confident that most of the lexemes collated in the Lexicon related to very
ancient times. Many Urdu lexemes are certainly relatable to these languages.
Wherever a Persian or Arabic concordance is found as recorded for e.g. in
Balsara's Gujarati Etymological Dictionary, the Persian or Arabic lexeme has
also been cited.

I believe that the stunning finding from the Lexicon is the remarkable
phonemic stability of the lexemes over perhaps five millennia or more. Hence,
there was no need to reconstruct a hypothetical *INDIC for reading either a
glyph or a substantive word for a weapon.

Thanks and regards,
Kalyanaraman
