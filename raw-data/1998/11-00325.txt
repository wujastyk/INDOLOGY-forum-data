Budhdhism had the most exalted frame of logic and Hinduism was the most
accomodative , in fact Hinduism is not a relgion in the classical terms of
the meaning, itis pity that it is made out to be so by zealots,


I wish your conference very well, take care that it does not become a
platform for revivalism

the science is the basis for any replicable, testable and generalizable
statement,

every religion has many of such statements just as each has many belifes
that are beyond science

but the important point is:  where does morality spring from, and can
scientific pursuit be carried on without moral context
