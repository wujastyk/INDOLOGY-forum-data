( Tchto Vy ! konietchna nielizia eto znats ). How would that be possible to
"know
more or less definitely "... N. Roerich, an extraordinary man, was a
mystical
painter deeply attracted to India and Tibet from both political and
"spiritual "
reasons. I don't think he did perform _a role_ in spreading that
unfundamented
assumption of Jesus'  "passage to India". On the other hand, assuming that
Christ was
a Jew and that his teaching was radically different from the
tradition he came from, except for the monotheism, it's not impossible
that part of his teaching could have been drawn from Hinduism, whose sages
seem to
had been around the Mediterranean areas since at least
Alexander's time. He may have done a trip to India...

I have only some vague

Hmmmmmmmmmm!

N. Roerich did know Tibetan, not to the extend as his son did, of course,
for he was not an schollar in stricto sensu. But he knew for sure much
more about the soul of that region than you and me.

I do hope that his son

You do hope ?
