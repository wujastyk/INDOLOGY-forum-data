In addition to E. Kahrs' volume forthcoming from Cambridge, there are also
older discussions of the question of the legitimacy of the Nirukta's
etymologies, which might be of interest in the history of Indology:

Hannes Skold, The Nirukta, its place in old Indian literature, its
etymologies (Lund: CWK Gleerup, 1926) Acta Regiae Societatis Humaniorum
Litterarum Ludensis 8)

Siddheshwar Varma, The etymologies of Yaska (Hoshiarpur: Vishveshvaranand
Institute Publications 1953)

Mantrini Prasad, Language of the Nirukta (Delhi: D K Publishing House,
1975)
