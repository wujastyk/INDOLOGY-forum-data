On the contrary, Kaalidaasa in s'aakuntalam says that females have superior
innate intelligence (as'kSitapaTutwam) even in the case of non-humans
(amaanuSiiSu), then, he says, 'think of women who are educated'
(pratiboodhavatyah). A female cuckoo gets her chicks raised by other birds
(crows). He gives this as metaphor.
striiNaam as'kSitapaTutwam amaanuSiiSu
sandrs'yate kim uta yaah pratiboodhavatyah
praag antarikSagamanaat svam apatyajaatam
anyaair dvijaai parabhrtaah khalu pooSayanti.

DuSyanta was referring to the intelligence of S'akuntala, when he noticed
her find some pretext or the other to look at him, as he was leaving (in a
way not to be misunderstood by her women friends)

Sorry this does not answer your question, but questions it!
