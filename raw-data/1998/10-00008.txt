Subject: why is rice used and not wheat in north indian rituals???
Message-ID: <161227041571.23782.3078168721053094311.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


I am curious if some one could educate me on why is rice grain used in tilak or various other ceremonies and not wheat grain???

We are planning the cover page of honey bee news letter next issue on this subject and will appreciate any input, information or even speculation on the subject.

Does it have to do some thing with the Aryan attempt to incorporate symbols of Dravidian cultures in its mainstream and there by assimilate them with in its fold??

I look forward to hear soon

Thanks very much
