Amen in Hebrew means "I believe" (first person singular). Similar term in
Arabic. One of the traditional explanations of Om (actually A-U-M) is that
it is a quick summary of the linguistic-sonic principles encoded in the
Sanskrit alphabet, starting at the back of the throat (A) and moving the
sound forward until the lips seal it off (M). In other words, it's an
abbreviation of the Sanskrit alphabet, which as Sabda, spanda, bIjA, etc.,
is all inclusive and the creative principle in action. Om therefore means
'everything', not 'I believe.'
