I second that. Here is some more info on Western music inspired by India.

Gustav Holst (the guy with the Planets) actually learned a smattering of
Sanskrit because he wanted to set hymns from the Rigveda to music. This he
did in his opus 26, Hymns from the Rigveda, composed 1908-10. He also
composed a chamber opera called Savitri, but I have no info about it except
the name. Anyone else out there with such info? Is it available on CD?
