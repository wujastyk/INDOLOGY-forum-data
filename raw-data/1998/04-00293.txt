Does anyone know whether there are on-line or CD-ROM English translations of
the following available?  Ramanuja's "Shri-Bhashya," Shamkara's
"Brahmasutra-Bhashya," Nagarjuna's "Madhyamika-Karika," and Vasubandhu's
"Twenty Verses" and "Thirty Verses"?  If so, can you instruct me as to how
to obtain them?  Thank you.
