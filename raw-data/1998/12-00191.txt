>?From Hsuan Tsang, we understand that
In the Northwest they make a belated
conversion of Panini to Buddhism.
After 500 years of his times, Panini was reborn
a bright boy who converts to Buddhism.
We are NOT told by Hsuan Tsang that
this boy, a reincarnation of
Panini after some 500 years, was
inspired by Avalokitezvara.


PART II:
--------
DharmakIrti, the author of the grammar RUpAvatAra is
from South India. Malur Rangacharya in his RUpAvatAra edition
done at Madras guesses him to be the Ceylonese DharmakIrti,
author of bAlAvatAra. When Rangacharya made this guess,
Manimekalai, the Tamil Buddhist epic was not discovered.
After that, 10s of avalokitas and 100s of buddha statues
have been discovered standing in maNDapams of
Siva or Vishnu temples. Inst. of Asian studies, Madras
is bringing out a book on these Tamil Buddhist sculptures.
But Rupavatara is attested in many
inscriptions widely in Tamilnadu and Kerala at least 100 years
before the time of bAlAvatAra."At eNNAyiram in South Arcot
the Chola Rajendra I endowed a large collection
of (1) 270 junior students of whom 40 studied the
elements of grammar according to the rUpAvatAra..."
(A History of South India by K. A. Nilakanta
Sastri, p.323). He must have been named after the famous
logician,  DharmakIrti who hailed from Tamil South
also.

DharmakIrti, a Buddhist of 10th century, cites
the same verse as quoted by Haradatta earlier.
First is that prayer to Mahesvara and then only
to Buddha. In the Mahayana Buddhist context,
it means that DharmakIrti makes a prayer to Bodhisattva
Avalokitezvara first and then only to Buddha.
