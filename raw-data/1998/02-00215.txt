Two other publications of Sri Santananda Sarasvati are listed in the
Amazon.com catalogue.

1. Good Company: An Anthology of Sayings, Stories and Answers to
Questions

2. Pure Wisdom: Insights for Those Seeking Happiness and Peace of Mind

In addition, see Andrew Rawlinson, "The Book of Enlightened Masters:
Western Teachers in Eastern Traditions" for some general information on
(ex-TM) British followers of Sri Santananda. This is a rather well
researched publication, and provides reliable lineage information for a
number of Hindu and Buddhist traditions that have found a home in the
West.
