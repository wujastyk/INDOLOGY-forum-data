Yes. In India, cats are considered sly, but dogs are dirty.

That is Saiva Saints, the Tevaram Nayanmars often describe
themselves as lowly dogs (naayinEn, naayEn, ...) in their
pleadings to Siva.

A beautiful book, with an essay by Dr. Wendy Doniger is:

Stella Snead, Animals in four worlds: sculpture from
India, UChicago p. 1989
