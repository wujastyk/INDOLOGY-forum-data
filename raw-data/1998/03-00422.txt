        Even without the PhD, I believe it's a problem to evoke racial
references in a language which don't had words to design a "race" in the
today's sense.
        anvayaH, kulaM, saMtAnaH, saMtati, vaMzAvalI, gotraM, jAti, vargaH
seem words for family, lineage, categories internal to a society, and I
don't have found Vedic references for any of them.
        Considering the more largest gaNa of the words zatruH, ariH,
vairin, dviS, &c. don't give nothing but hostility. "to hate the enemy"
don't is "to be racist".
        I don't have found any word with the meaning "people inferior
because having a different look"*. Hence this "racial references" are
perhaps nothing but an anachronical interpretation.
        In Greece, the word "barbaros" just means "not Greek-speaker" and
the Hesiod's myth of races lies in the diachrony, not in the synchrony; his
Indian equivalent is the theory of yugAH, the today's "iron race" being the
kaliyugaH.
        Even with the animals, the differences between them are not
considered as "racial" but as "provenance". That's allways true today with
the geographical names of cats, dogs, cows, &c. and I suppose the notion of
"race" don't exist before Mendel.
        Regards,

* see recent debate on this list showing that "dark-skinned" don't is
pejorative nor "racial" in India.
