Exactly...

Why not?  If it's independent in Kannada (or Spanish), so it can be
in Brahui.

That's additional evidence for North Dravidian.  It doesn't tell us
where and when such an entity existed.  Andronov (I think) derived
his dates (6000 ~ 5000 years) for the split between Brahui and
(North-)Dravidian from glottochronology, which we all agree is
suspect.  But is the divergence between Brahui and Kur-Mlt really
consistent with a separation of a mere 1000 years ("800-1100 CE")?
Language families at such an extremely shallow time depth (e.g.
Romance [c. 2000 y.] or Tamil-Malayalam [< 1500 y.?]) are not usually
controversial.
