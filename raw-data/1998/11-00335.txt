*Myth and Reality*, another of D.D. Kosambi's books (Bombay: Popular
Prakashan, 1962) advances the same dating claim (page 26), but footnotes it
(#19). Here is the text of the footnote:

"See JRAS 1960; 17-31, 135-144, or chapter IV of this book; for the cave
painting (originally discovered by Carlleyle) Mrs. B. Allchin in Man,
58.1958, article 207 + plate M (pp. 153-5)."

I am at home, and do not have access to these journals here, but hope that
at least one of these references discusses criteria for dating the cave
painting.
