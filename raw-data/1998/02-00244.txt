Even after revisionist attempts, majority of academics are confidant
and write that Aryans migrated into India and not the other way around.
That is., Aryans did not spread out from India.

If there is no divide between Indo-Iranian languages and Dravidian
languages, can Tamil (for eg.,) be derived from Sanskrit?
