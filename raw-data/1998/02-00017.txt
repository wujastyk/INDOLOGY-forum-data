Subject: A question on Tamil dialects
Message-ID: <161227035347.23782.13184534127104548039.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am interested in the colloquial forms of the Tamil word "vai" meaning "to
scold". In Madurai dialect, when one wants to say he scolded one would say
"vaJjAn2". (The other word used is "tiTTin2An2".) I have heard a person with
East Tanjore ancestry using the form "vassAn2". The interesting thing is I
distinctly hear two "s" es as opposed to "vasAn2" with a single "s". Have
anybody else heard this form from in East Tanjore or any other dialect?

Regards
