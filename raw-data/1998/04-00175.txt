Building, at 101 Independence Ave. S.E.  Tickets are not required.

Mr. Sen is known as an economist who deals with broad humanistic issues,
such as hunger and poverty, and their impact on economics.  He will offer
perspectives on the interactions of Asian cultural and economic values
with current American priorities for Asia.
