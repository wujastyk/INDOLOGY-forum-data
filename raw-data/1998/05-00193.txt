Thank you very much for your kind offer, I however regret that I cannot
give you the first words since only the translation is available to
me...can I request you to give me books where the
vacanas of people like dAsimaiya or couDaiya are available in kannaDa?
I have seen books brought out by the Institute of Kannada Studies,
Dharwar which give the vacanas in kannaDa of mahAdEviyakka and basa
vEzvara but none of the other vIrazaiva saints...




A special thanks for the explanation of the vacana, it does make more
sense to me after your explanation.

<<Though I am not sure, I suspect that this difference is a subtle one,
rooted in a metaphysical difference: the haridaasas are Dvaitins, the
;siva;sara.nas are ;Saktivi;si.s.taadvaitins, and these doctrines have
different notions about the ontological status of the individual. (Here
it is worth mentioning that Kanakadaasa apparently was from a
;Sriivai.s.nava, i.e. a Vi;si.s.taadvaitin background.)>>


This is a very interesting explanation and I'm surprised to know that
