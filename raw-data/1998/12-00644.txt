          It is interesting that if one studies Dravidian
          culture/literature (atleast from translations), s/he won't
          be pushing the Indigenous Aryan "theories"
          or justify varNa color theories.

          Reading the books by B. K. Smith and the favorable
          reviews, a sample of which is attached, I tend to
          believe in Prof. Smith's theory on varNa.

          Of course, David Frawley and company confuse
          and distort.

         I wait for the day when Mr. Bijoy Misra writes
         a book or a journal article disproving Smith's
         varna theory. Until then, I would rather go with
         Prof. Smith.
