I am not a scholar but only conducting a personal research.
I previously wrote to a few professors but I received no answer, so I
decided to ask the question to this forum.

I am trying to find a sanskrit book called Bhaskhar Sangita (or probably
Samhita?) supposedly a part of the Shiva Purana, but I couldn't trace this
name neither in the Puranas nor in the Vedas.
I know that there are rare sanskrit editions of the Shiva Purana that it
could be
part of.

I have been in India last year and asked for this title in many libraries,
in Delhi
and Varanasi, with no success. I also went to Motilal Banarsidass press in
New
Delhi but no one could help me, since I didn't found what I was looking for
in their english translations of the Puranas.

Has anyone heard about this book by any chance? It should contain a dialog
between
Angiras and Brahma, concerning Angiras' mission on earth and his other
incarnations as Vasishta and Vyasa.

A sanskrit scholar in India suggested that it could be an excerpt of the
Bhrigu Samhita, which is a manuscript of
astrological predictions about incarnations of all human beings. This
sounds
much more esoteric and difficult to trace.

Any hint would be greatly appreciated.
