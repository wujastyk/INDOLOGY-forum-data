Subject: New Ramayana book
Message-ID: <161227034847.23782.3960922490865439992.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A particularly beautiful new book has come into my hadnds:

K. Vijayan (ed.), _Ramayana in palm leaf pictures: Citraramayana_
(Trivandrum: Oriental Research Institute and Manuscripts Library, 1997).
Trivandrum Sanskrit Series No. 265.

Copies available from

Dr K. Vijayan,
Professor of Sanskrit and Director,
Oriental Research Institute & Manuscripts Library,
Kariavattom,
Trivandrum 695 581,
INDIA.

Price  Rs. 1000 ($50.00).

The book contains over three hundred colour photographs of a magnificent
15th century engraved palm leaf manuscript (Trivandrum ORIML Codex no.
12308), with useful introduction and appendices giving full documentation
of the pictures and text.

The whole book is exceptionally well produced on art paper, and the photos
are very clear.

All the best,
Dominik
