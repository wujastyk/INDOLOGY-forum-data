Baidyanath Saraswati says the followingin Pottery-Making Cultures and Indian
Civilization (1978, p.88):

"In Tantra literature, we find a few esoteric rites connected with the
potter's wheel which also aim at the attainment of vigour."

Can anybody describe what these rites are or give references? Thanks in
advance.
