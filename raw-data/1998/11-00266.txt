I guess you did.  But how is that relevant?

There was some speculation a while ago about the flooding of the
Black Sea having triggered the IE diaspora, sending massive amounts
of refugees into Europe and Asia, or even to have been the source of
the Near Eastern flood myths.  All of which is quite silly.
Population densities on the north shore of the Black Sea would have
been negligible, agriculture hadn't even been fully introduced there
yet.  All the farmers in that part of the world were high and dry on
Balkan tells.  There are no movements out of the Black Sea area
around 5500 BC, only movements into it a few centuries later
(Dnepr-Donets culture).

The event must have been highly significant for the Black Lake fish,
but otherwise not terribly important for people.
