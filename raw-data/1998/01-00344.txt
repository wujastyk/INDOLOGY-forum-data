I would like to ask a question concerning pets. As an Indologist, I "grew
up" with the idea that dogs were regarded as impure by Hindus, and that
Hindus for this reason did not keep dogs as pets. (Having seen the stray
dogs of Benares, I somehow found this attitude rather understandable). But
here you tell us that people in Pune (presumably Hindus, most of them!) keep
both cats and dogs. I have also seen pure-bred dogs kept as pets in
Bangalore, but I am curious: How does this square with the idea that dogs
are impure? Is the question of caste involved here (as in : brahmins don't,
kshatriyas do)? Or did  I get this completely wrong?

Best regards,
