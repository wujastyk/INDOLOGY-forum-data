The original Kannada text has been already posted by Prof Pierre Filliozat.  However, I am posting it again with minor corrections.

"HaRida gooNiyalobba kaLaveya tumbida
IruLella naDedanaa sunkakkanji
kaLaveyellaa hoogi baRi gooNi uLiyittu
aLimanadavana bhakti intaayittu Raamanaatha"

<<As for an explanation, I suggest this: many vacanas of that period deal with relationships between the (at that time) new Virasaiva community and the orthodox around them. It appears that many new followers hesitated to openly admit their beliefs for fear of public opinion. Daasimayya's imagery may mean this: the grain is the man's faith, the sack is his conduct (not firm and in agreement with the faith he would like to profess), the toll gate represents orthodox society, which he fears to face, and when finally he is confronted by the orthodox (which may be relatives, friends, or just anybody) his faith has weakened so much (because he is too faint-hearted to live in agreement with it) that it is practically no longer existant.

The explanation given by Robert Zydenbos is, no doubt, interesting.  But the meaning of this Vacana is quite different as I understand it from my traditional background.  If you refer to the previous Vacana of Daasimayya, it becomes clear.  

"God makes his devotees beg and suffer
(For testing the purity of their heart)
Rubs them like gold
Grinds them like a sandal-wood
Crushes them like a sugar-cane
If they remain unperturbed and unalarmed
(And continue to have unflinching faith)
Our Ramanatha
Would lift them up by hand."
