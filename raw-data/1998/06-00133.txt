Just a few notes on:

except: armaka 1.133.3 and (if one follows Geldner): [mahaa-]vailasthaana
also in 1.133.1  (cf. paper on arma(ka) by Harry Falk: Vedisch arma.
Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenlandischen Gesellschaft 131, 1981,
160-171

Not in this passage. One would have to look more carefully. I do not
remember any passage to that effect right now.

Yes,  but they CAN also be quite mercenary, esp. in their daanastutis...

restrictive also as the RV is a collection of hymns (almost exclusively?)
composed for the (New Year [thus, Kuiper]) Soma sacrifice. What do you
expect of a liturgy for Easter or Passover? David's latest military
exploits and his love affairs? As you pointed out: we have to be happy
with what the poets actually mentioned, often in their similes! (usually
one of the best sources for contemporary info).

The famous daasa/dasyu references.... Or S'ambara with his mountain
fortresses... We still do that as well: foreign devils, the
great/small Shaitan, the Hun...

Fine. Here H.Falk's comparison with the Godaar tribe of SW Afghanistan (in
the volume "Inside the texts..")  can serve as a starting point! Societies
can live side by side in that manner: RV poets and cattle herders have
little interest in agriculture and agriculturists, though they are
mentioned (kiinaaza) .- cf. similar situation in the later PGW culture,
discussed recently. -

They refer to these 'neighbors' occasionally: I like RV 3.33 best:  "what
is the use of cows with the KiikaTa"? i.e. a "Massai" attitude:  all cows
belong to us, and only we know how to handle them and how to offer them to
the gods...

But there is alrady Iranian (Avest.) is'tiia, from the same root...
Apparently they knew of bricks, maybe learned it from the (pre-)BMAC
cultures, before c.  2000 BC. at the northern fringes of Iran/Afghanistan.
Note the two separate formations (perhaps, also cf. Tocharian izcem).

They did not take the closely related Iranian evidence into account...
Not everything must come from Harappa... (Staal now has a paper, forthc.,
which takes note of the Avestan evidence).

I agree for the rest...
