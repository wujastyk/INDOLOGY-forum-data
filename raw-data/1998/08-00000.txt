Hi,
You may like to view some Mesopotamian (Ur, Tell Agrab) and IVC (Chanhudaro)
images of the carts/war-chariots and an overview of Gordon Childe) at
http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/html/bronzeage1.htm
There are parallels in the use of non-spoked wheels, wheels moving with the
axle and the yoke and pole fixed to the frame. Of course, onagers were used...
Regards, K.
