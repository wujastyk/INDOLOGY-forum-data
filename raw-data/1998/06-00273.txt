Message-ID: <161227040049.23782.15821056800707716513.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Check the URL <http://sdlcfsn.cs.iitm.ernet.in/tidbits.html>, for
software being developed for Grantha characters at IIT, Chennai. The
necessary files are not available on the IIT website or at their ftp
site, but write to <rkk at shiva.iitm.ernet.in>.

As an aside, the vehement discussion about Grantha on the Tamil
discussion list a few months ago didn't seem to know about this effort
at IIT at all. It might be useful not to duplicate effort.
