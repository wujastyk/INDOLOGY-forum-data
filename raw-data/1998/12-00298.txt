About Koenraad Elst, of Belgium, I think Vidyasankar Sundaresan
wrote in Indology long ago. Pl. search the archives.
Mr. Elst is a curious phenomenon, acc. to that Indology posting.

Mr. Elst was touring US Hindu temples, his speech was full of
polemics against Muslims and very appealing to
Neo-Hindus.

He is rarely seen nowadays.
