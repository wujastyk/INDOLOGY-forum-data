In the case of Malayalam, it is perhaps not very accurate to say that
the earliest writing dates from ca. 14th century or so. For some
reason, these dates seem to applicable to  kavya type works in these
languages. Prose might however be a different matter.

In this context, I would like to draw the list members' attention to
the fact that many lost Sanskrit classics viz., kavya, natya and even
sastra works (and their commentaries) were uncovered from
Kerala. Examples would be manuscripts of Bhasa's dramas etc.. In some
cases, commentaries  have been found with annotations written in what
has traditionally been held to be Tamil.  Expert opinion however
confirms that these are in what has later come to be known as
Malayalam.  At least one of these commentaries ('tika') dates from the
12th century or before.

Warm Regards.
