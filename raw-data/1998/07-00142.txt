Pace Panini I feel rather uneasy about the use of meta-grammatical
arguments, because they invite to pressing linguistic data into
preconceived schemes of interpretation. In this case: "tam pustakaM
darzayati" is felt to be equivalent to English "he shows him a book"
(German "er zeigt ihm ein Buch"), and since "him" in this case can be taken
(in analogy to the German "ihm") as an indirect object, we feel entitled to
interprete the accusative "tam", too, as an indirect object. But is it not
more sound to take case endings seriously and to understand the sanskrit
sentence as "he makes him see a book", where we feel no doubt about the
direct object character of both "him" and "the book"? And the fact that
"darzayati" could (since when?) be used with a dative or genitive shows
only that its semantics gradually shifted into the direction of "to show"
(i.e. "to give someone something to see") so that it could be used in
analogy to verbs like "dA". But that does not entitle us in my opinon to
call the accusative "tam" an "indirect object".
