According to KRSNa in Bhagavad-gItA 4.13:

cAtur-varNyaM mayA sRSTaM
guNa-karma-vibhAgaZaH

The four castes (cAtur-varNyaM) were created by Me, according to
quality (guNa) and activity (karma).

Race and birth are not mentioned.

Furthermore, the sage, NArada, states in the BhAgavata PurANa 7.11.35:

yasya yal lakSaNaM proktaM
puMso varNAbhivyanjakam
yad anyatrApi dRSyeta
tat tenaiva vinirdiZet

"If one shows the symptoms of being a brAhmaNa, kSatriya, vaiZya or
ZUdra [varNa]. . . even if he has appeared in a different class [anyatra],
he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification."

I hope these references shed some light on the discussion.
