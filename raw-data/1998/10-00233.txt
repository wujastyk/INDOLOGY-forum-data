        The Shrinathji temple in north India is also seen as the mansion
(haveli) of Nanda, Krishna's foster father in Braj. This may or not be
considered cosmology, but almost everything in and around that temple has
spiritual significance assigned to it. Even the nearby river Banas is
regarded as the YamunA, the temple cows as those of Nanda, etc.
