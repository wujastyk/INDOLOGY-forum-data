The stuatus of puur is controversial. It seems to have cognates outside
India, in Lithuanian etc.

uur is unlikley to be of IE origin.

There is another problem in language contact situations: The meaning of
similar sounding words in different langauges can be influnced by one
another. This is why ``this in IA and Dravidian. so IA borrowed it
from Dravidian'' are too facile. This is precisely what the problem is in
discussions of retroflexion. I will expand on this when I get time,
may be tomorrow.
