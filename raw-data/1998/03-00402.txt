Dear friend,

I have made available a tool for transliteration
of Malayalam between English and Malayalam scripts,
under the URL:
http://members.tripod.com/~CibuCJ/varamozhi.html.
Varamozhi is the name given to it. May be it is the
first tool which allows font conversion, transliteration
scheme conversion, for any font in Malayalam.

Please forward this mail to those whom you think
will love to edit or view Malayalam text in their
computer.


-With Best Regards,
 Cibu C. J.
