S.P.Gupta in "The Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, Origins, Problems
and Issues" 1996, writes:
 "The Saraswati before 10,000BC, may be still earlier
 by a few thousand years, however appears to have flowed not
 through Kurukshetra but through the Panchabhadra region in the
 Aravalis, following the path of the Luni and and ending up in the
 great Rann of Kutch (Ghose, et al 1990). The landsat imagery and
 the geological changes now recorded show that tectonic movements
 which took place in Rajasthan and Haryana shifted
 the course of the Saraswati to its present position in the
 north-west."

SP.Gupta doesnt give more details on the paper by Ghose (1990) but
there is an older paper which is given below.
Here are some of the references given by SP.Gupta.

 Ghose, B et al 1979
 "The lost courses of the Saraswati River in the Great Indian desert.
 New Evidence from Landsat Imagery".
 The Geopgraphic Journal  Vol 145 (3) pages 446-451

 Yashpal, et all 1984
 Remote Sensing of the lost Sarasvati river. In "Frontiers of the Indus
 civilization"

 Bharadwaj, O.P 1988

 Journal of Indological Studies, Vol II, nos1-2, Chandigarh

In addition There are  other papers by Raikes and Gurdip Singh
which deals with the geographical/environmental conditions.

On superficial comparision of a not very detailed map given by
SP.Gupta(fig 9,pg15) with a map of pre-harappan sites in Frontiers
of the Indus  civilization(1984) where the oldest course of the
Sarasvati is not marked, it appears that there is greater concentration
of pre-harappan sites on the oldest course of the Sarasvati!,
(I would appreciate any feedback on this observation,as I havent been able
 to get the references by ILL yet ).
