Let us see what an authority on Mahayana Buddhism
has to say on 'siva-avalokita acoonexions.

Lokesh Chandra,1979, ODDiyAna: a new interpretation says:
"the acculturation of 'Siva into Buddhist tradition
may have takenplace in South India and thence it was
transmitted to Indonesia where 'Siva-Buddha
syncretism was deeply entrenched."

Avalokita is enshrined in Borabudur.
