Prof. Vassilkov has just answered most of the points but since this and
the following messages were in my machine anyhow, here are my 2 cents:

That is, of course, one of the items we have to settle and the present
discussion is but a minute aspect of it. As I mentioned last time: we have
to make data from various sciences FIT each other, not pursue just one
thing, the Sarasvati. But the S. data *also* have to fit, therefore:

Exactly, the latter: RV 3.33 is a quasi-eye-witness account of the
crossing of the Beas and Sutlej by kind Sudas, composed by Visvamitra and
7.18 is a quasi-eye witness account of the 10-Kings'-Battle compsoed by
his arch-enemy, Vasistha.  (As is well known, Visvamitra was ousted as
purohita by the newcomer Vasistha. This is so well remembered that even in
the middle ages and more recently their decendants do not quote each
others RV poems....).

Of course, both Suuktas are in highly poetic format. Tricky. Many puns.
(H.-P. Schmidt has dealt with 7.18 in Indica, some 15 years ago.) How else
do you talk about your (defeated) enemies? : the Yadu become yaksu
"sacrificial animals", the Matsya are 'hooked' etc.

And since such hymns could not be changed after the fact (except for the
minute phonetical changes made by the redactors, Sakalya and others, we
have here, as I like to call it: a tape recording from the Vedic period.

As I said. -- But as for archaeological evidence for an immigration of a
movable (groups of) tribes, that's tricky business. For example, even the
highly invasive Huns (375 AD+ in Europe) had not been located
archaeologically until some of their graves were found in Hungary a few
years ago...

To follow the "arch.line of argmentation":  until then, c. 1980, they did
not enter Europe, "there was no disturbance [of late Roman civ. which
continued, politically, for another 100 years]", but  *now* the Huns have
entered indeed!

So all we  are missing are a few Rgvedic graves... and they may even have
been found already. More below.

(Of course, we have massive literary evidence for the Huns, just as we
have it for the Indo-Aryans in the Rgveda, but that does not count in an
'archaeological' argument as made above, or as always pursued by J.
Shaffer -- more on this below.)

I am afraid this is arm chair sociology. Just supposition.  I forget the
number of sites surveyed by Mughal in the rest of the Panjab, but I
remember it was not a *small* number. I can find out. And they did settle
there: otherwise no Harappa, Mohenjo Daro etc. -- But these are large
sites.  Mughal mostly found small ones in undisturbed, dry Cholistan which
would have disappeared in many other locations.

The Sarasvati (Gh.-Hakra) never was stable as the multiple channels
especially in its upper courses show. All Panjab rivers are unstable,
inculuding even the Yamuna and further east.  As I said: the
Ghagghar-Hakra presents a SPECIAL case as it has been FOSSILE, dry and and
undisturbed since late Harrappan times.

THEREFORE you find a lot of sites there, on the Sarasvati/G-H. -- sites
which have been washed away in other places, leveled, ploughed over etc.

We actually know this about the modern town of Harappa; Delhi has 7 sites
(Indarpat etc), and Benares 3 from North to South. Lahore, of course,
needs investigation.
