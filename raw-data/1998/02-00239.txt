The following is a question I recently posted on RISA-L. The great silence
that followed is perhaps an answer in itself, but I still thought I'd give
it a try on Indology-L, too:

>>Does anybody out there know of any scholarly work/s on Hindu techniques of
divination, apart from David Pingree's on ancient astrology? I am trying to
discern to what extent this particular aspect of Hinduism has been explored,
and so far I've come up with very little. Haven't scholars of religion taken
any interest in this topic?>>

Best regards,
