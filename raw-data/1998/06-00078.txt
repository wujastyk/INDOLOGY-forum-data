Yes, [zrai'iSTha] or, as Kuiper probably would have it even for the RV,
[zraiHiSTha]  (with surviving laryngeal)

As for point 2:  Vedic [zrai'iSTHa] < Indo-Iranian *[c'raiHis`'tha]
                 < IE *k'reiHist(h)o-

In all these (pre-)forms, not [zre:'iSTha], as comparatives and
superlatives work with full grade (guNa) in the root, not long vowel grade
(vRdhhi).

cf. guru ;  gar-Iyas ; gar-iSTha,
or without the problems of laryngeal in guru:
dhan-iSTha, pan-, van-, san-, han-, tap-,vep-, rabh-, zobh-iSTha etc.etc.
