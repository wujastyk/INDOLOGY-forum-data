Subject: Madame Blavatsky and the swastika

Japanese use it because of Swastika in Buddhism.

The poor Swastika was invented and in use from
the Indus Valley Civilization, (IVC). Most likely scenario:
the dominant people of IVC were Dravidians.
(cf. A. Parpola, Decipherment of the Indus script, Oxford
uinv. press, 1994 and decades of work by I. Mahadevan)

If true, the IVC people have nothing to do with the later
appropriations and usage of their symbol, Swastika by Aryans
either for good or bad.

No they can't. The problem is that most people don't know the origin of
those signs and symbols. I always recall an history some twenty years
ago.
I played Judo in a sports center and the bathrooms were shared by all
sports. One day there were people that practiced Shorinji Kempo, a
Japanese
Martial Art that uses a green swastika as their symbol. My country -
Portugal - had just thrown away a fascist dictatorship a couple of years
before. So, a man that practised another sport just starts shouting at
the
Shorinji practitionners because they were carrying a Nazi symbol. How
could
they have the nerve to do it? I remember all too well the surprised and
confusion of the Sensei, and his innability to explain the mistake.
