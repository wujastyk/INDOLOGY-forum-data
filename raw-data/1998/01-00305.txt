I am researching a chant - Jaya Jaya Vitthala. Would anyone know who
Pundalika and Panduranga are and what is the significance of Vitthala, who I
believe is the incarnation of Visnu, standing on a brick. Also is there
significance in the names? The dictionary, i.e. Monier-Williams, does not
indicate that.

Thank you for your kind response.

Martin
