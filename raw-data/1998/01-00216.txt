The change in Norway (and Scandinavia) has been tremendous. Nora was a
revolutionary. Today, 80% of all women have work outside the home. In many
respects, the change in Scandinavia has been more dramatic than in other
European countries, that tend to be more conservative in outlook.

When you introduce the word Bedeutungstr?ger, I feel far more comfortable
with your point of view.

That is of course true. But my point was that it would have been
linguistically *possible*. All the words and concepts needed to translate
oscenities, for instance, were present in English a 100 years ago. They just
weren't used in print. The fact that it wasn't done, had to do with
non-linguistic values, but with moral concepts (Bowdlerization of
Shakespear, for instance). 

When I consider our discussion, I have a sneaky feeling that our
disagreement is slightly artificial. I seem to be discussing something
closer to "la langue", whereas you seem to be discussing something closer to
"la parole" (to use Saussure's expressions). I see language as a flexible
and changeable system that can be manipulated to express any given concept
*over time* while still being the same language in linguistic terms, whereas
you pounce upon language as it is used at a given moment in time. A
practical example: The manipulation of language performed by Communists and
Faschists in this century.
