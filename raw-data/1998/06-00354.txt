My impression is that /t./ and /t'/ are rather similar in tehir
acoustic effect (articulation is very different).  I'm afraid I can't
confirm that with an authoritative quote.

According to Ladefoged ("A Course in Phonetics"), retroflex sounds
show a "general lowering of the third and fourth formants".
Unfortunately, no acoustic correlates are given for ejectives.
