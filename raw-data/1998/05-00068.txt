appropriate.

  Comments and suggestions from Asia librarians about the BAS

to me (jccamp at umich.edu).  Remarks and questions about the BAS itself and
how it workdsw should be sent to bas-note at umich.edu, and we will respond

  Finally, please note that although the BAS is fully functional,
including the on-line documentation, there are still some errors in the
