It looks as though that I have committed a faux pas by apologigimg.
Professor Witzel, I apologige to you for apologiging. I hope that
puts the whole thing out of the way.

purANAs contain

1) myths
2) interpolations
3) sectarian propaganda
4) politically slanted accounts
5) fantasies that are sometimes obscure to interpret.

But that is the case with all such chronicles world over. Just as the
tendency of a school of Indian Indologists to treat everything in the
purANAs as infallible is wrong, so is the tendency of other scholars
to dismiss them summarily as source of information and history (some-
times the only source however unreliable it may be). purANAS I believe
were originally intended to be something like encyclopeadias and as such
they carry the body and the state of knowledge in those times.

This shows that information can be extracted even from the motivated
and slanted accounts. By the way, Andhras (that is we) are to the south
not east.

I think that the Europian scholarship should take a more serious and
critical look at purANAs.
