I would like to know what sort of online resources/encoding
has been done on the tale collections such as panchatantra,
kathasaritsagara, etc. I have checked out the sanskrit documents site,
but it is a bit unclear as to what has been done and what needs
doing--apparently the panchatantra is partially done?

In any case, any possible leads would be appreciated...

Thanks!
