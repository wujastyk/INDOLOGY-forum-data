        The situation from Kamban's RAmAyaNa, described by N.Ganesan, does
not give any ground for such generalization. Hanuman speaks with Seethai in
the forest of Asoka trees just because SHE IS A WOMAN, and the antaHpura is
not a place to speak Sanskrit! In the Mbh there is a story of Indra's
attempt to seduce RucI, wife of a RSi. To prevent it, the RSi's pupil Vipula
leaves his own body and keeps guard inside the body of RucI. When Indra
gallantly addresses the beauty, Vipula answers him in her voice. Indra is
greatly astonished to hear correct Sanskrit speech from a woman (even the
wife of a great Brahmin sage)! He immediately understands that some other
person speaks through her mouth.
        Best regards,
                                Ya.V.
