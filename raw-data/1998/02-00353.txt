Dear Jaco Baltuch:
You are right; I do not think any genuine Indian linguist buys the theory
that Sanskrit originated in India and travelled north and west. The
rejection of the Skt descent of Dravidian is over 100 years old, although
you occasionally  come across pseudo experts/traditional pundits who repeat
the abandoned theory, because they are not basicaly linguists. The other
kind, like Subrahmanya in the list, mistake aspects of convergence between
languages through contact as genetic phenomena. They have basically no idea
of how genetic relationships are established among languages. I do not think
Edwin Brynt is correct in saying that the main stream academia support the
theory that India was the homeland of IE.   Regards, Bh.K.
