A simile is a simile. I spoke about Europe!!

I have mentoned the highly suggestive Ural burials, c. 2000 BC, with a
Dadhyanc-like figure (human body, no head, but instead: horse head). As in
RV. (Gening 1977!) Any other Dadhyances in Uralic, Siberian myth?>
Parpola has given other comparisons, especially for the BMAC (again,
Erdosy, 1995)

Yes, but we do not have historical writings from India at that time.
Must use the RV.

And there was no Vedic invasion but a complicated pattern of gradual
clan/tribe-wise movements and a lot of acculturation in the Panjab,
See Erdosy 1995...

Anyhow, enough to see whence and how *speakers* of Vedic Old Indo_Aryan
arrived.

Read Parpola's and my paper in Erdosy 1995....
