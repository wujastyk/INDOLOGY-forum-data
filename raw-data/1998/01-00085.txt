Dear members of the list,

I am looking for publication(s) giving a general description of Sindhi
sailing vessels of the traditional type.

So far I have been able to find only one reference:

Zur geschichtlichen Bedeutung der fr?hen Seefahrt. (Schlingloff 1982, in:
Kolloquien zur Allgemeinen und Vergleichenden Arch?ologie, M?nchen, Verlag
C. H. Beck, 2 vols., pp. 51-85).

--Unfortunately, the volume of this series corresponding to the year 1982
is not available in any of the countries cooperating with our library.

Could anyone suggest something else that might be available, that would
provide the required information? I need only a general description and not
detailed technical information.

Or failing that, does any library in Germany provide the service of
photocopying and mailing articles contained in German publications? I would
of course be happy to pay the required charges.

Thank you, and with best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
