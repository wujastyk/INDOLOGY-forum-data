This place well-known to IIT Madras students (it is bordering the IIT campus)
is known as vELa/AccEri today. In the inscriptions its name is given as
vELiccEri. I have thought about this. It is possible for  vELir cEri >
vELiccEri. I did not pursue it further since I wanted items more directly
comparable to vELAn2/r.
