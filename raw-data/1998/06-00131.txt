I would like to know the earliest known mention of the practice of
Niyoga in ancient India( historical/mythological).{Niyoga is the
practice of a woman marrying her brother-in-law on the demise of her
husband}.

  Further, from what I know of the Ramayana, rUmA the wife of sugrIva
is made to marry vAli when sugrIva is exiled by vAli. Is this an example
of niyOga i.e. the difference being that sugrIva wasn't dead
when rUma became the wife of vAli.

Regards,
Krishna
