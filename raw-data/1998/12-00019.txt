Dear members of the net,

The warmest thanks to those who responded to my plea for information about
Urdu speakers in Bengladesh! I recommend everyone to have a look at
http://www.sil.org/ethnologue
(yes another website but a very useful one).

Now, if I am not overly importunate, is there someone out there who knows
the number of Urdu speakers in:

The United Kingdom
Germany
The United States

This information will be included in an article to be published in a book
on Indo-Aryan Languages by Curzon Press (it is a good cause), so if you
will be so kind as to cite your source I would be very grateful.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
