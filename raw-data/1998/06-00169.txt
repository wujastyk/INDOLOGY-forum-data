CPD sv AyogapaTTa:  bandage, strip of cloth, referring to AyogapallatthikA
(skt. paryastikA), refers to Lueders, Bharhut und die buddh. Lit (AKM XXVI
3), p. 5, and Coomaraswamy, La sculpture de Bharhut (Annales du Musee
Guimet, Bib d'art, nouv. ser VI), fig 202.

Apologies if this repeats what has already been said -- I haven't been
paying much attention to this thread.
