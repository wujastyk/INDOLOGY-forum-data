Dear Listowner,

Please pass the following message on to your mailing list.

And a big thank you to all of you for your assistance with getting the
word out to your respective mailing lists. It IS appreciated.

Curt

For those of you who are interested, the proposed Usenet group
soc.history.early-modern passed its vote. The group has appeared on some
news servers.

I encourage mailing list members to join in on the discussion - there's
not much yet, but I'm confident that will change.

If you look for the group and don't find it, then your news server
probably hasn't started carrying it yet. Sometimes it takes a couple of
weeks for new groups to show up, however you may want to drop a note to
your news administrator asking them to start carrying it.

Thanks to all of you who participated in the news.groups discussions and
cast a vote.
