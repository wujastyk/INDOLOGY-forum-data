One of my old Classics teachers said exactly the same thing: "They come to
the battle on their chariots as if they were riding taxis." His conclusion
was that Homer knew about chariots but that he had not seen them used in
battle. The Romans used chariots too, but only for racing. Old instruments
of war sometimes end up as pure sports articles. Today, we throw spears and
shoot the bow at the Olympics, but - pace Rambo - both weapons keep a low
profile in today's warfare.
