I am grateful to vidyasankar Sundaresan for his clarification:

Actually the MSS of the story of Naciketas, mostly variations of the
name  "NAsiketopAkhyAnam", are recent versions of the ancient story from
the VrAha PurANa.
All the commentators that I know of - old and modern, Western and
Eastern - do not mention the recent story at all. Belloni-Filippi
translated the MSS found in the British Library and S. Krause, who
translated a Rajastani version of the story, refers to Belloni-Filippi.
So, as far as I know, in commentating on KaTHopaniSad, no one refers to
the recent versions of the story.
If anybody could enlighten me about the subject, I shall appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.
