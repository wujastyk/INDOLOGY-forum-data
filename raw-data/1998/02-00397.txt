when he was alive. From his handwritten manuscripts,
Prof. R. P. Sethu Pillai edited for the whole of Arattuppaal section
of Tirukkural.
Tirukkural: Ellis' commentary.
Edited by R. P. Sethu Pillai, Univ. of Madras, 1956, 406 p.

It appears some more of Ellis' manuscripts, translations remain
unpublished.

His Commentary on Tirukkural.

It is interesting that Beschi(1680-1747) wrote the Christian epic,
Tembavani in chaste Tamil on the life of St. Joseph. Likewise,
F. W. Ellis composed several poems that are included in
tanippaaTal tiraTTu (Anthology of solitary verses).
After Beschi and Ellis, I do not know of non-south-asian scholars
who can compose tamil poetry using ancient or medieval meters.
May be, in 18th/19th centuries, in order to
prove oneself in tamil scholarship, composing poetry was
deemed essential. Nowadays, prose would do.
