Dear Colleagues

In connection with the proposed International Standard for Indic
transliteration, I have put on the Web a draft 7-bit scheme, as well as
notes on the draft scheme with diacritics.    The 7-bit scheme is not
supposed to be the best for all purposes, but is intended principally for
the transmission and storage of text for direct reading.   See:

Please give your comments and suggestions (which are very welcome) before
the end of November 1998.

With apologies to those who receive more than one copy of this posting,
