Maybe, but I would think at least pre-Semitic and pre-Sumerian.
Sumerians by their own accord came by sea from Dilmun, although I know
there is some controversy surrounding this subject. Semitic speakers
probably came only around 5,000 to 4,000 BCE (using biological
anthropology as a guide). Using the migrations occurred after the change
of monsoons in the Sahara, it would seem the first evidence of AA
speakers in Palestine is associated with the early wavy-handled pottery.

The Elamites, however, might well be related linguistically to these
early farmers.

Again, we come to the problem of whether the spread of agriculture
requires demographic changes.

Given the case in Europe, didn't the pre-IE languages have non-IE terms
for agriculture?  This would indicate the first people to spread
agriculture to Europe were pre-IE folk like the Etruscans (and possibly
the Basques, Iberians and Picts.)
