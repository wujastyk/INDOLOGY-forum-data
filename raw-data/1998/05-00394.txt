Subject: "vELAppArppAn2": potter-priest or non-sacrificing brahmin?
Message-ID: <161227038871.23782.17279573293098845304.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is a poem in the Classical Tamil text akanAn2URu which has the follwing
lines.

vELAp pArppAn2 vALaram tumitta
vaLai kaLaintu ozinta kozuntin2 an2n2a
taLai piNi avizAc curimukap pakanRai

This has been conventionally interpreted as " the unloosened spiral-faced
pakanRai flower like the tip of the conch shell remaining after the conch
shell is cut for bangles by the saw of the non-sacrificing brahmin". This text
has been used as evidence for the practice of some brahmins to be engaged in
making bangles from conch (shank) shells in ancient Tamilnadu. For instance,
Clarence Maloney, in his article "Archeology in South India: Accomplishments
and Prospects", uses this to state that in Sangam period, there were "non-
sacrificing" Brahmans who cut conch shells. Also according to a medieval poem,
nakkIran2, the Classical Tamil poet, put down ziva by saying that nakkIran2
had a caste/lineage that was one of cutting conch shells while ziva had no
lineage whatsoever. Based on this story, nakkIran2e is claimed to have been a
non-sacrificing brahmin.

I have always wondered about this interpretation. As far as I know, there is
no other evidence in Indian texts that says that non-sacrificing brahmins were
engaged in making conch shell bangles. (I am willing to be corrected on this.)
