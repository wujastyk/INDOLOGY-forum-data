"Loss of essential material intended for worship due to the devotee's
oversight, or non-availability of the necessary pUjadravyAs according to
the owe taken by him inspite of his sincere efforts, is in some cases
considered to be one of the important reasons for self-sacrifice. The
devotee takes such circumstances as god given opportunity to prove his deep
devotion and smilingly offer his own limbs, which may stand as a substitute
for the intended flowers which are not easily available, or offering one's
own head if the necessary fruit is not available, is noticeable in some cases.
