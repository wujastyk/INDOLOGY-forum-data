        Dear Dr.Ganesan,

                In a way you were correct in saying that the
        "Thiru naLLARRuth thirup pathigam" is used to invoke
        Siva's help in attenuating the evil effects of planets.
        It is used for afflictions by SanaiSchara.
        People  with Ashtama, Ardhashtama, and Ezharai afflictions
        of Sani, recite this particular pathigam. It is also known
        as the "Pachchaip pathigam" and  is involved in a
        particular miracle called "analvAdham" performed by
        Sambandhar.

        So far I have not come across the translation of any full
        Tevara pathigam. We do see many pathigams in transliteration
        or in any one of the fonts. But translation- no. Not as yet,
        any way. We don't even see some form of brief introduction
        which might be a slight consolation.
        But there are rumours that more than one person is
        involved in translation. Periya puranam is one the works-
`       I was told.
                The "kOL aRu thirup pathigam" was composed
        as a  reassuarance against all forms of ills including
        the disasterous effects of planets and asterisms.
        For the true beleivers of the Supreme Lord Siva, all the
        various forms of evils will certainly turn good and do good.
        That is what is reiterated again and again in every one
        of the verses.
                That is the gist of the whole hymn.
                Sambandhar mentions about the planets, ie.,
        the nine of them in the first verse. For a devotee of Siva,
        these will become good. The last lines of every verse
        contains this pledge and assuarance.  In the second, he
        deals with the twenty-seven asterisms. In the third,
        he pledges the help of other deities like Lakshmi,
        and Durga. In the fourth, some natural calamities
        like mass death, fire, fatal epidemics are mentioned.
        In the fifth, he talks about demons, raksasas, and more
        natural disasters like thunder and lightening; in the sixth,
        all the dangerous animals; in the seventh all the various
        illnesses and diseases; in the eighth, cruel tyrants
        like Ravana; in the ninth, he says that  Vishnu and
        Brahma would help the devotees of Siva; in the tenth,
        he curses the alien heretical doctrines; in the last
        and eleventh verse called "thiru kadaik kAppu" he swears
        by Siva that those who recite this pathigam will rule over
        the heavens.
                This pathigam can be said to be the earliest
        precursor to all the "kavacam'" hymns that are to be found in
        Tamil.
                All though it was named as the "koL aRu thirp pathigam",
        which roughly translated would mean pathigam which
        dispels the planets, in its true nature covers all ills.
                P.S. The words "catastrophe" and "disaster"
        are both derived from the word "Aster"= star.

        Regards

        Jayabarathi
