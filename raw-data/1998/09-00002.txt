In reply to Dominique Thillaud's question about the legality of
the wedding between Arjuna and Subhadra, Georg Von simson says:


 You may be right that the introduction of Kuntibhoja in
>the story was meant to make the case more acceptable. But, as you point

as
>far as I can see, not acceptable according to dharmazAstra.


  My "prazna" on  this: Since Subhadra was "kidnapped" for the wedding
by Arjuna, do the DharmazAstra rules apply strictly? As my understanding
goes, the bride was always blameless in case of a "forced" marriage and
the rules governing "forced" marriages were different from that of
arranged marriages; so can the conventional rules be invoked for a
special case like this?

Krishna
