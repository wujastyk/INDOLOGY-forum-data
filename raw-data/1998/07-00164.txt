Dear Avinash Sathaye,
        Many thanks for your very complete answer.
        Apparently, for the maNDaka, 'very thin' and 'thick kneaded dough'
seems contradictory, but I've seen old Italian pizzaioli making very big
and thin pizzas, doing jump and turn the initially small and thick disk in
their both hands with an astonishing dexterity. Do you believe the same
knack could be known in India?
        Namaste,
Dominique
