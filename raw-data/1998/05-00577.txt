As usual in this discussion the baby is thrown out with the bath water.
Of course, there are no RV time manuscripts. But, except for some minute,
well known details, the ORAL tradition has been fixed from the beginning.
No changes allowed. Thus, I call it a "tape recording" of the RV period.
It is as good as any well preserved inscription.

Of course, as Indologists have underlined for some 150 years, even such
texts are POLITICAL. If you can read between the lines, and that is of
course part of our training, you get a pretty good idea of what was going
on.

The geographical data can be studied just like anything else in the text.
Some things are obvious, such as a RV area of the Greater Panjab and
surroundings. Others such as the samudra and the Rasaa need more study.

And we have to use the *RV* since we do not have anything else for the
whole period, say from 3000-1000 BC, except archeology, or, as we cannot
read it (Indus inscriptions). Or we can resign ourselves, and shut up.
Archaeology? - Archaeology alone did not tell us that the Mayas were not
as peaceful as they had been portrayed until we could read their
texts....

That last sentence alone shows that the data are not taken into account.
The data of the Indus civ. just do not fit the RV (we need a special
e-sattra on that), but the PGW has many correspondences, in spread,
material culture, etc., with the *POST*-RV texts.

Again the arch. evidence alone. Even tehre w have soem data as I have
already pointed out. Should I repeat myself again? -- What about language,
material and spiritual culture, customs, beliefs, rituals, religion etc as
found in RV?  These data have all the kinks with Iran and beyond, not with
the Indus civ.  etc.
