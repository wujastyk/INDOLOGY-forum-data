        Alas, not just in Indology! Supposed loan words and postulated
"substratum influence" are the medicine against the unknown in the all
range of the linguistic! Fabulous domains where there are no rules nor
laws: not even necessary to give any clue about the mysterious influencing
language, the best being to choose it very bad known or even undeciphered!
Thraco-Phrygian, Lycian, Illyrian, even Etruscan or Minoan are the common
shops of a lot of Hellenists...
