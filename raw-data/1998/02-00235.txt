It is amazing how, what starts of as guesswork, changes into attestations
and then turns into undisputed fact a couple of iterations later with a
little bit of
tinkering here and there and hardly any kind of proof or verification.

As the Aryan Invasion/Migration theory chokes,sputters and dies, so will its
other face,the
artificial Aryan(or the PC indo-european)/Dravidian language divide die
under the weight of its own contradictions and distortions.
