Dear Member,
Further to my e-mail dated Nov 9, here are some more details:
The Vedashastrottejak Sabha, a century-old institute of Pune, functioning
as a university for the traditional type Sanskrit schools, has recorded the
recitation of two complete Vedas on 90-minute audio cassettes: the Rigveda
and the Samaveda (Kauthuma branch). The first (RV) consists of 34
cassettes; the second 32. These are priced at Rs. 150/- per cassette;
shipping charges extra. (This would roughly come to about 300 US Dollars at
the current exchange rate.) The RV recitation is by a traditionally trained
Pandit from Pune (Shri D. M. Phadke); the SV recitation (that is, singing
of the SV songs) is by a traditionally trained Pandit from Madras (Shri
Vishvanath Sharma).
On the basis of this information, you can directly contact the institute at
the postal address already given. If you wish to get any further
information, feel free to contact me.
With best wishes,
KSA
