Subject: Proposal for Exchange of Publications
Message-ID: <161227041206.23782.2946066958413861820.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

We're attempting to extend our exchange of publications to new
institutions and would welcome all proposals from interested
parties. The exchange will be with indological publications only.
The modalities of the exchange will be worked out with individual
institutions.


Thank you,
