Not really. But it seems that what you want boils down to CSX fonts that
will work in TeX. You might like to look at the collection of TeX virtual
fonts, implementing CSX for both Computer Modern and various PostScript
typefaces, that you can find by following the "fonts" link from the URL
given below. I use these on a Linux system and they work fine. (There are
also CSX PostScript and TrueType fonts using a Times-lookalike, in case
these are of use.)
