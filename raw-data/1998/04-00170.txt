        (c 300B.C.-300A.D.),. But planetary effects on human
        and mundane affairs are touched upon in PuRanAnURu
        etc.

                But there are some small facts that I put forward
         which I hope will be of some use to you.

                All these temples have their own ThEvAram hymns.
                Usually the hymns would contain some reference to the
        worship done by a paricular planet, or the grace bestowed
        upon that particular planet by Siva. Which means that, the
        association of that planet was already in existennce when
        the hymn was sung. Which puts the legend earlier than the hymns.
        So it can be safely surmised that the planetary association with
        all these Siva temples are at least one thousand four
        hundred years of antiquity.
                So in all these temples, it became customary to
        build special shrines to the planet concerned.
                There is also another custom among the Saivites.
        If a person is affected by a particular planet, he has to
        recite the ThEvAram hymn dedicated to that temple associated
        with that particular planet.
                Eg., For AngkAraka DhOsha, one has to recite the
        hymns of VaidhIswaran KOyil alias Thiru PuL irukku vELUr.
        Because that place has the Mars-connection.
                The hymns are recited repeatedly.
                Actually this is a form of PrayOga.
                All these hymns are compiled as the "VENdukOL
        Thirup Padhigam".
                For general coverage, one has to recite KOLaRu
        Thirup Padhigam" or the "Thiruk KOLili Thirup Padhigam".
                There is more on Agamas, Silpa Sastra and
        the Puranas in the next posting as you have asked.
