What comes closest to a pancake in my experience is a doose
(Kannada) / doocai (Tamil). Roo.ti etc. is two dry, while a doose
has something fluffy about it, like a pancake (i.e. the thicker
variety of pancake; a French crepe or Dutch flensje is of course
something different).

But there are varieties of doose that resemble a crepe or flensje
too: for instance, what in Mysore is called a "paper doose". So
perhaps 'doose' is not such a bad choice after all.
