Hello all

I am very very very (I can't stress this enough) sorry for posting a
personal reply to this list. I am _deeply_ _deeply_ sorry for any damage
done!!!

As I have said, it is my responsibility for this and I deeply regret waht I
have done. This is very unethical and I am terribly sorry for any
consequences. I can't stress this enough. I am SORRY.

I am sorry and as of now am leaving this list.
My aoplogies.
Sorry,
Harsh Vedak
