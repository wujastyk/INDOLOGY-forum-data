About a year ago I was asked by someone on the list for information
regarding the effects of photocopying and scanning on manuscripts. I've
just recently come to know of the following:

        The Digitization of Primary Textual Sources
        by Peter Robinson
        Office for Humanities Communication Publications, No. 4
        Oxford University Computing Services, 1993.

A note on the last page (p. 104) says:

Copies can be obtained from The Office for Humanities Communication,
Oxford University Computing Services, 13 Banbury Road, Oxford  OX2 6NN,
enclosing cheque made payable to Oxford University Computing Services.
(The cost is 5 pounds.) Addition for postage and packing per copy:
1 pound for UK and Europe, 3 pounds outside Europe.

 best, Tim Cahill
