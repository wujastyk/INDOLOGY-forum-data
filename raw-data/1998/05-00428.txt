Sometime back there was a discussion on this list of period impurity
following birth and death. The following sloka from viSNupurANa
may be of interest.

        bAlE dEzAntarasthE ca patitE ca munau mRtE
        sadyazzaucaM tathEcchAtO jalAgnyudbandhanAdiSu 3.13.17

On the death of a child, a person living in a far off country, a fallen
person, a muni and people who committed suicide in water, fire or by rope;
immediate purification. (Period of pollution nil).

There is also a general discussion of period of impurity for the various
castes in the above chapter.
