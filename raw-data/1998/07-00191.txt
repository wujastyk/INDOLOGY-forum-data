In Belgium only two universities still teach Sanskrit, Ghent and Li?ge.

There was a time when some simple secondary school teachers in Belgium
could produce Sanskrit translations ("Cakuntala", trad. par Frans De
Ville, Office de Publicit?, Bruxelles, 1943).

One Indology dept per 7 million people in Belgium & the Netherlands.
