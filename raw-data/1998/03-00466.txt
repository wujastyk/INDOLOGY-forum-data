        This personnal neologism was early polemical, an answer to a German
scholar defending "indogermanisch" with the argument: "too much hiatus in
*indoeuropaeisch!". Hence, I suggested Eurindian, eurindisch, eurindien,
evrindikos, &c. as a simple alternate solution, just refering to the two
subcontinents. There was also a funny hommage to the Indian brothers, their
part becoming the more stressed in this new compound, fitting well against
the English colonization and, for the old Frenchman I am, against the
well-known "ueberalles".
        But all this is past. Today, I've just one answer: SHORTER!
