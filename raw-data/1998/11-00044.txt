>Dear Members,
>Of the many works I have authored in the area of linguistic study of
>Marathi, I wish to gift 25 copies of the History of Marathi Grammar (in
>Marathi) to academic/educational institutes and individuals interested in
>this study, -- to ensure the survival and knowledge, and facilitate the
>study, of this subject and work in places where Marathi is spoken and/or
>studied.
>
>This work, published in 1992, is the product of a devoted study of more
>than 20 years, and covers the history of the subject of about 7 centuries
>from its beginnings in 14th century upto a recent work published in 1990.
>It reviews 109 small and extensive works on the subject divided in suitable
>groups; and discusses in its epilogue the strong and weak points of the
>tradition as well as the scientific lines on which it should proceed.
>
>Those interested can contact me on the e-mail address given above.
>
>Best wishes.
