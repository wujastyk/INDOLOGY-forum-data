Subject: Paired Horse and PIE breakup
Message-ID: <161227042407.23782.6803851844051170423.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 I was really surprised to read P. K. Manansala's
writing in Indology list earlier that
"...,but I don't recall the horse as a particularly important
symbol in the Greek, Roman, Persian or Celtic mythology
I have seen. ..." All my readings indicate the
opposite: Horse played a unique, important role in
IE religion and culture. For eg., horses and Aryans
go hand in hand in the Vedas.

Reading the recent postings, Scythians are related to
Iranians more than to anyothers.

That is why, I am interested in references comparing
the religious complex of Scythians and Altaic-Uralic
peoples? Does the horse complex
of the points given below really extending from Manchuria
to Eastern Europe? Anybody else to confirm or deny
about this? Any publications on the horse
culture civilization myths compared for the
"Scythian-Uralic-Altaic" cultures?

For the record, I don't believe in Computers just
skipping language groups and reaching others.
My cousins work for Microsoft and IBM in India.
They tell me their gurus are American (some may
be India born Americans). Just as Buddhism and Islam
also did not hop over to other lands from
the lands of their birth.
