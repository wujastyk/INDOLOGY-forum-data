The Sanskrit text (which is, by the way, rather fragmentary) uses
n(i)kSip(ya) (46.7) and there is nothing that would suggest a sitting
position of the body on the funeral pile.

The Sanskrit text says: ... citAM citvA dhyApyate, which is just a
resanskritisation of the Pali verb jhApenti which you quote in the
following. Subject of the sentence seems to be "rAjnaz cakravartinaH kAyo",
mentioned in the beginning of the passage, and then the Sanskrit text would
say the same as the Pali text, namely that the body of the king/Buddha is
burnt. But, as you point out in the following, it does not seem likely that
the body could be burnt to ashes if it was put in an iron vessel filled
with oil and covered by an other iron vessel!

I find this idea very tempting, and I think you will find parallels in the
anthropological literature.

I can't answer this question. The whole episode may be a blend of real
customs and mythological imagination.

In the Sanskrit MPS (51.2,6; 51.8), too, the bones are divided into eight
parts (but the text has to be reconstructed here after the Tibetan Vinaya
parallel).

>General question: Could that mean that what he was dividing was

An interesting idea. But it may also be (and this is, as far as I remember,
Bareau's explanation) that the tradition happened to know about eight
zarIrastUpas.  As the story goes, the relics are divided into eight parts
for political reasons.
