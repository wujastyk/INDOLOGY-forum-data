I disagree.  While some of the other evidence you cite might help
explain the theory of Indo-European linguistic and cultural influence,
it hardly has any bearing on the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT).

There is nothing in external historical sources that suggests an
invasion of India, and really nothing in the archaeological or
anthropological record either.  I believe the archaeological record now
strongly shows that IVC was *not* overthrown by invaders from the North
or West.  Also, there is no biological evidence to show a sudden
intrusion anywhere near the time of the downfall of IVC.
