Not only Drews. Anthony also writes years after Drews.
(Also, Anthony writes that PIE as a language existed after
3500 B.C. and the breakup could be as late as 2000 B.C..
He also places much emphasis on technical innovations (chariots)
for the spread of IE).
In her critique, Mary Littauer calls Sintashta chariots (2000 B.C.)
are 'proto'chariots because it is possible that they
lacked yoke saddles. They predate Neareastern chariots,
( Littauer, The origin of the true chariot, 1996).

So far, absolutely no evidence of chariots earlier than
Proto-IIr. ones. Or, is it something that I am missing?
