Subject: Indo-Aryan im/e-migration (scholarly debate)
Message-ID: <161227038315.23782.10856834955000162971.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I will be very grateful for examples of animal domesticated in one region
introduced in naother region without human migration,

Are you referring to trade in animals and distinguishing that through
permanent migration? in that case it is ok
