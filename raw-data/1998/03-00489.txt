Hello again, Edwin!

As far as I know, nothing else. But I would be terribly grateful if you got
me a copy of the article. The alternative is to go through the library
service of the university, which would take several weeks. That is why I try
to use my Indology connections.

Is there anything I can get you? Our library is not so well geared for
modern Indological studies as some collections I have seen abroad, but it
has a good classical collection.

Best regards,

Lars Martin
