The original situation of `rAma.m pustaka.m darzayati' then is like `(he) makes rama - see the book. In other words, rama as the higher object, and the book as the lower object.

However, Boris Oguibenine wrote

The original situation of `rAma.m pustaka.m darzayati' then is more like `(he) makes the book - (so that) rAma sees (it). Much more difficult to analyse in terms of (apologize) generative grammar, but more satisfactory also. The analysis with rAma as the higher object goes wrong, as then `see the book' as a whole also functions as a direct object. Two direct obects are difficult. So, it looks as if Boris' observation yields the better conclusion.

Of course. Unless you indicate this shift-to-come-in-later-times already by a term like indirect object. As we all observe that there is `some' difference between the two accusatives.
