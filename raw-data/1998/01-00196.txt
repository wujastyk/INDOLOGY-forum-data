>Dear INDOLOGISTS,
>I have two questions for you:

describe two separate

pada) and  the

pr`thvI and pr`ithivI

different, but both are

>Other examples are : mukunda and mucukunda( both
mean "viSNu"),
>vasudhA and vasundharA( both mean "earth") and
probably zabarI and
>zaurI ( the lady who appears in the rAmAyaNa,
though I'm not sure if
>"zaurI" can mean "zabarI"). How have these words
been derived?( spelling
>is nearly the same but the words are treated  as
separate)
>
>2. Can anyone point me towards the
derivation/origins of the word "AI"(
>mother) in marATHI and assamese? The word AFAIK
does not exist in Hindi

Maharashtra and

geographically

of such words?
