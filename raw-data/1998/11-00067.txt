   After the demise of Achaemenid empire, the Iranian artisans
   found no patronage in Iran. They dispersed. Some of them
   could have been at Paa.taliputra, according to scholars.
   Compare with Mughal painters at the time of Aurangzeb
   left for Hindu courts. Mughal style in Rajput painting,
   Pahari painting, gets established after that.

   There were Greek ambassadors at Mauryan courts. Not
   long ago, Aramaic inscriptions of Asoka are found.
   J. C. Harle, The art and architecture of the Indian
   subcontinent, p. 22:
   "Although they no doubt  conformed to a practice
    derived from Achaemenid Iran, Asoka's edicts ..."
    p.24:
   "Some of the pillars were unquestionably raised by Asoka.
    others are probably somewhat earlier, but not a great
    deal, for a longer tradition of stone carving would
    certainly have left other remains. The sudden appearance
    of stone carving of such sophistication probably argues
    for some foreign workers or at least contacts, just as the
    rather cold hieratic style of the Saranath lions shows
    obvious Achaemenid or Sargonid influence. ..."
