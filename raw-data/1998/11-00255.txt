Isn't this one of the features that connect Indo-European with the (or
some?) Semitic languages? As far as I remember, in Arabic, which has (like
the Romance languages) the two genders m. and f., any inanimate, regardless
whether m. or f. in singular, is  grammatically (i. e. if connected with an
adjective or referred to by a pronoun) treated in plural as a *feminine
singular*.
