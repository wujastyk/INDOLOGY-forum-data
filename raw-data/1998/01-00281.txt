Dear Dr. Rabe,

What the respected sthapati, Sri. Vai. Ganapathi Sthapati says can be checked
thru' his magnificient work on temple architecture written in early
1970s. The book title is ciRpac cennUl. He got lot help to finish and
publish this book from Saw. Ganesan of Karaikkudi, Rajaji and Annadurai.
His paramapara is really astonishing and continuous for generations.

They are innovators too. His father, Sri. Vaidhyanatha Sthapati
built Ramanasramam in Tiruvannaamalai, Gandhi MaNDapam in Chennai, ...


V. Ganapathi Sthapati designed Puumpukaar Art Gallery at the place
where Kaveri enters the sea. There about 80 basrelief sculptures
narrating the entire Cilappatikaaram are awesome. He later
built almost a 70 feet temple car mimicking the aazit tEr
at tiruvaaruur celebrated from the days of Tevaram saints.
This temple car is built out of pure granite. Valluavar kOTTam in Madras,
a memorial dedicated to the author of TirukkuRaL has this this temple car.
I hear he is designing a very tall TiruvaLLuvar statue for Kanniyakumari.


Regards,
N. Ganesan
