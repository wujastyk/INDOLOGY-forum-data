I can't help but get into this pet thing, by writing that I suspect a
major reason why dogs are less welcome round a house or any other area
where levels of ritual purity must be maintained is because dogs, if
left to their own devices,  eat human and animal manure, whereas cats
would not touch either. If someone decides to bend the regulations a
bit, cats would have a distinct edge over dogs.

There's a similar problem with pigs. While pigs have become trendy pets
in the USA,  I doubt if anyone in India would treat a pig as a pet.
Free roaming pigs also eat excrement.
