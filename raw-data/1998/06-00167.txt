There is some thing left out here. I have been unable to find a source
for my belief that some of the texts are older than Kikkuli. So
I did not wish to assert it. It is the use of chariots in war that
is definitely attested in the Old Kingdom period.

What is the purpose of an archive? Archives often contain all sorts of
documents.

Two turning points => 2n-1 turns for n circuits. Precisely what I said
earlier.
