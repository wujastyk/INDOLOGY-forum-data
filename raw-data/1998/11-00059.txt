Subject: Paired Horse and PIE breakup

Well these latter examples are really relevant.  Buddhism started in
India, but often is transmitted by non-Indians.  For example, Chinese
were largely responisble for the spread of Buddhism in Japan.  Tibetans
and Japanese have done the most to spread Buddhism in the United States.

So religion and technology are not language or "race" specific.  They
skip from one language or ethnic group to another.  Thus, attempting
to judge the breakup of PIE on the spread of horse rituals and/or
chariot technology is open to much criticism.
>>>>>>>>>

     In the history of religions, buddist monks are the
     first missionaries known to us. Many Indian monks
     like Bodhidharma and Dharmagupta were in China spreading
     Buddhism. Later their spiritual descendents took
     from Sino-Korean region to Japan. Some Indians
     could well have been there along with Chinese.
     1) To teach Buddhist Sanskrit texts and 2)
     Alphabetical order in one Japanese script
     shows Indian influence (K. A. Nilakanta Sastri quotes a
     1910s article saying it can be from Tamil; Southeast Asian scripts
     derive from Pallava grantha). Japanese or Tibetan Buddhism is
     recognizably different from the earlier Indian Buddhism.
     This is in the last millennium. Why the horse ritual and
     divine horse-twins myth are similar for a much greater time depth?
     No evidence for such an effective horse complex evangelism
     in second or third or seventh millennium B.C.

     If we must rely on solely on archaeology
     and textual materials are irrelevant and myths/legends
     cannot be compared, IE studies won't be where it is.
