My dear Palaniappan,

Your assumption is that the scholarly motivation is to explain *Indian*
pre-history, as opposed to I-A or I-Ir or I-E pre-history. So long as
this is not satisfied, Dravidian will not receive the same level of
attention. That is why your prediction will come true.

Indeed. Forget pre-history, which involves a lot of careful
reconstruction from often meagre leads. Even the recorded history of the
south is not very well-known, is it?
