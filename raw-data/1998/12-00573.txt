Dear Sri Krishna,

NamaskAram.

Bhagavad Giithaa was written by "anonymous Brahmin writers".
(cd. Norton anthology of World literature)

Around 100 BC. It is a composite text compiled
over centuries, inserted into the middle of Mahabharata.
It could be as late as 200 AD.

Regards,
N. Ganesan

Hi all

Sumarian civilization is considered to be the first Civilization
dating back to 3000BC from the history books.

But Geeta was dating back to 5561 BC [Ref. The scientific
Dating of Mahabharata by Dr.PV.Vartak] which is contradicting
the history books that Sumarian is the first civilization.

can you through some more light on this?

thanks

krishna
