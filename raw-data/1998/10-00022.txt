I agree with Lars Martin Fosse entirely. Without such postings, we will be the
losers. If there is a problem on the size of word count in a mailing, I will
be happy to host the lists on the web with an URL reference on the indology
mailing list and add a link at the yahoo sarasvatisindhu club site.
