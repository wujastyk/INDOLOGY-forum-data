Subject: Pali Manuscript Sale?
Message-ID: <161227041023.23782.4464901479343585806.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I've been approached by an elderly lady, a member of our local Indian
community.  She has an old Pali palm leaf manuscript that she'd like
to sell.  It's been in her family for ages.  Does anyone have any
suggestions as to how she might go about doing this?

Thanks, Lance
