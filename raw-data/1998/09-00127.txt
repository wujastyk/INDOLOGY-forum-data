Dear list members,
        For which reason Drupada has such a name? Could be he a lame (a
staff being the wooden leg)? More precisely, could be a link between
Pancalas and pangu? Are the people of Pancalas a people of smithes?
(smithes are frequently lame).
        In a same way, who is the God worshipped by smithes?
        Thanks in advance,
Dominique
