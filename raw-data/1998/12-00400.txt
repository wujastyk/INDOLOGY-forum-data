B.N.K. Sharma, in his _History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta and Its
Literature_, mentions one Raghuuttama Tiirtha who lived 1557-1596.
According to Sharma, this author wrote 7 works (listed in the book);
there is no "Bhaa.syacandra" listed among them. This author was from
northern Karnataka (modern Bijapur district). If the Raghuuttama whom
you are looking for turns out to be the same, this would be an
interesting discovery.
