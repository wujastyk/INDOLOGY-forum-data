Pigs and rice rather than barley and cows. Not Vedic.

But all this seems to confirm the non-Vedic nature of PGW. You seem
to simply give explanations why there is no evidence.  We could apply
also give such explanations for IVC.  The saffron argument is that
there have been wheels discovered in the IVC, so there could have
been chariots.

Well this is a hard view, which certainly is not universal.  Sounds
more like the semi-nomadism found among some modern "tribal"
populations. How do they figure people with brick or timber houses
are nomadic?  Shouldn't they be living in tents or temporary
shelters.  Also, most of the information I've read ascribes mud huts
as the primary shelter in PGW.  Generally rice and pig farmers are
not nomadic, unless you're talking about very common shifting around
in a small area.

I thought the IE peoples of this time were iron age.  We should see iron coming in
from the West, and iron artifacts similar to those found outside India.
