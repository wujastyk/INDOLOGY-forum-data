Dear Klaus,
        thank you and all other contributors for an interesting list of
works on Indian themes in European music. My own contribution to it:
"Nal' i Damayanti" ("Nala and Damayanti"), an opera by Anton Arensky
(1861-1906). Its libretto, based on V.Zhukovsky's translation of the poem,
was written by Modest Chaikovsky, the brother of the great composer.
The opera was written in 1897, first performed in concert in 1903, and
staged at the Bol'shoy theatre (Moskow) in 1904.
        All the best,
                                Ya.V.
