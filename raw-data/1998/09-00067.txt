Hello Jibunnessa!

The "Advertisements" related to "Tripod" etc. and were probably related to
the web server the site is hosted on.

I am sorry, I brought up the subject because I was hoping better
understanding would defuse the situation.

Our focus should be on the content of the web site.

In this age of almost instant communication, we can get impatient. The
content of the web site deserves more of our focus. If the hosting server
has a problem, maybe the author may consider hosting it elsewhere  -- just a
suggestion if anyone else experiences difficulties.

Maybe Dominique being in France has a problem with his ISP and a slow
connection.
