There is a short Japanese article by Amano Hirofusa, "on the composite
purpose of the Abhisamayaalam.kaara'saastra" in Indogaku Bukkyougaku
Kenkyuu 34/1969. According to my notes, this
article compares prayojana, prakaran.a, sambandha etc. in the AA'S with
the corresponding statements in the Tattvasam.grahapa~jjikaa.
