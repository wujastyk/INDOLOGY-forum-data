Aside:
May be D. Shulman's book on human sacrifice in Indic literature,
art, & a comparison to the West does not have the above reference.
David will be happy on this reference, as I have given him rare
titles of tamil stalapuraaNam, pirapantam, etc., almost for a
decade now.

If people leave me alone, I can do good things.
eg: Chola Pallippatai temples & who built them
for umaadevi.
