*By the way, according to R. Ghose, "It is significant that the tyAgarAja
*temple in tiruvoRRiyUr has a vyAkaraNamaNDapa, a pavilion for the teaching of
*grammar and the God is called vyAkaraNadAnapperumAL or the "Lord who has
*given grammar as his gift." Inscriptions connect this temple with the
*kALAmukhas of Kashmir.

"This record also refers to two officers who held an enquiry into
the temple affairs at the 'vakkaNikkum maNDapam' (ARE 128 of 1912)

Is vakkaNai in tamil from vyAkaraNa? It looks so.
Jayasinga kulakAla vizupparaiyan was associated with this temple.
The nataraja is called kArAnai viTaGka tEvar in inscriptions.
In JayamkoNTaar's kArAnai vizupparaiyan maTal, aatinaatan
is praised with many sanskrit epithets. May be kArAnai
vizupparaiyar, high Chola officials were important in fostering
PaaNinIyam in TN.

p. 305
"PaaNini's vyAkaraNa seems to have received cond=siderable attention
in TiruvoRRiyuur. According to tradition, the first 14 aphorisms
of that grammar were produced by his Siva from His damaru (kettle-drum)
and made a gift of them to PaaNini. Hence the name of
vyAkaraNa daanap perumaaL is applied to Siva. The name of a
local temple-priest is given as vyaakaranadaana bhattar.
The above hall is presumably set up for the purpose of
expounding this grammar".

kuutta nuul, a dance treatise of medieval times speaks
of the sounds emanating from one side of "Siva's damaru
becoming Sanskrit, sounds from the other side becoming
Tamil. kAnchip purANam of Madhava Sivagnaana YogigaL
says that "Siva taught Sanskrit to Panini and Tamil to
Agastya.

In which Sanskrit text, "Siva teaching grammar to Panini episode
occurs?
