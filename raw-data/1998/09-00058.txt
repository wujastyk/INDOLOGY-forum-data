Hi,
In addition to the posting of Krishna on Mahadevan's survey in an Indian
History Congress, there was a comprehensive review of Rao's decipherment by
Mahadevan in Puratattva. An excellent bibliography which also references mine
is in Parpola, Deciphering the Indus Script.
Regards,
kalyanaraman.

Journal of Oriental Studies. I would be grateful for bibliographic references
to this review, and also to any other reviews and discussions of Rao's books
("Lothal and the Indus Civilization"; "The Decipherment of the Indus Script").
