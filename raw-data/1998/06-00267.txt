>?From Tarim Basin to Baluchistan you find tremendous variety of languages -
Tocharian, Dardic,so called "Kafir", Bangani, Brahui etc...

Also migrationists typically tend to regard the language of the Rgveda as
indicative of all Arya presence in the subcontinent. This is not correct.
The Rgveda mostly represents a Puru dialect. There were most definitely
other people in the area who  considered themselves "Arya" as well.

You are right. That is why it is not correct to say that migration into
India caused the development of retroflexion.

Witzels reconstruction of Vedic Textual history demands all kinds
of reminiscences !!.  Let us not get into that again.
None of the archeologists seem to think that there is any evidence
of a migration.
As for the genetic evidence, let us wait for the book.

Please give details, as to what has not been discarded and what the new

You make an excellent point here !..Is central asia been capable of producing
the population needed to go all around Asia and Europe to make such an impact
as the Indo-Europeans have done. Nomads who generally do not have such surplus
food cannot be expected to produce the population needed to colonize such a
large
 area !!. Is Ukraine capable of producing the population neeeded to go out and
populate the whole area form India to Ireland so thorougly as the
Indo-Europeans have ?

Wrong!. First you have to prove that whatever area in Central Asia could produce
the population needed to overwhelm all of North India and impose its own culture
and language on a more advanced civilization.

I am willing to discuss the methodical problem - but did not want to
