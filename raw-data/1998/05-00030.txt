>?From the day you appeared on indology, whenever I say something "tamil"
surely a response will come. Not a pleasurable experience though.

This is just an illustrative example. For my writings, most of your responses
can be answered this way. I do not have so much time like people do
in India.

Mr. D. V. Sarma writes (in the same posting, a little earlier)
"Tamil arrogance is equally abhorring..."

Whenever Tamil's antiquity is even hinted at, fury comes.
We are repeatedly told that we are
regional/parochial/political/short_sighted/chauvinistic/arrogant/
narrow_minded/.... What are the political overtones and
undercurrents?

I do not agree that these are true.
I am glad that you are not.

When the Sanskritization of Malayalam, a dialect of tamil until
10th century AD can be studied, is it wrong to ask a preliminary
question on sanskritization of Telugu?
