Thank you, but I have just been to the VRI a couple of months ago, and they
are not holding the material I was looking for.
        Industrial unrest was still affecting operations when I was there
in December-January, but at least the library was opening.  The director's
position had not been filled by then, but there was to be a series of
meetings of the trustees and managers in January to try and sort things
out.  After the death of Gupta-ji the whole place was in the doldrums
waiting for something to happen.


Adrian.
