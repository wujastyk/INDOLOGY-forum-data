PRECISELY:  in later literature. The Epics and the Puranas are
re-formulations and re-interpretations, with a lot of changes made, of the
Vedic texts.  Vasistha as been promoted "to the Heavens" in such texts,
while in the RV he is a newcomer, without Angirasa background etc.

Or do you also doubt that the Epics/Puranas are *late* texts compared to
the Vedas?

How do you know that? Standard presumption? There simply is no means so
far to date any Avesta texts independently from the Near Eastern sources
and from correpondensces with the Vedas, see O Skjaervo in the Erdosy
Volume 1995. (We would love to have a Chinese ambassador at that time in
Bactria. Unfortunately, he came 1000 years too late!).

Avestan is often MORE archaic than the frequently INNOVATIVE Rgvedic.

The last sentence gives away your suppositions. -- On reading any Avesta
section in the original you would see that it does not contain anything
(linguistically) that could have come out of India. No Indian words, no
Indian ideas, no Harappan items etc.

Of course, there is a RV religion: many books have been written about it.
-- It differs somewhat from Iranian one (even neglecting the reform of
Zoroaster), and it differs somewhat from post-Rgvedic religion. Some
intra-RV regional and clan-wise distinctions in belief and ritual can also
be seen. But it stands out clearly against the other types of "Arya"
religion mantioned just now.

Yes, and from the high Iranian Mountains (Yasna 9). Apparently in the way
you go and collect your Peyotl, send out somebody or trade it from the
local people (whom you then beat up in the process, according to the
post-RV ritual).

All? - The Rasaa /Rangha/ Rha is indeed a special case which is in need of
a *long* discussion. The above note on Rasaa is primarily linguistic.  But
it can be sustained. We can have a discussion of that.

"Are not usually forgotten" -- a sweeping statement. We need details. - As
I said, I have supplied such data in Erdosy 1995. No need to repeat myself
again.  My fingers are tired by now.  And Parpola has done so for 2
decades or so.

I suggest to read his papers and then come back.
