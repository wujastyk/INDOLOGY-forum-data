*Apart from Hastinapur, Pirac, Stacul and one or two other places, what

*(say, 1500-500 BCE) that would suggest that the horse increases

*despite the fact that the horse-centered Indo-Aryans were very much
*present during this period.  [...]

I do not know the archaeological record. What I wrote is
from art history & literature perspective. I thought I
made this clear. AND, I posted a questio regarding archaeological
record in my original posting:
*Has systematic study of the horse finds vs. century BC/AD
*is conducted? (something like this)
