within the editor.  Two files are provided as a courtesy to the user:
  TAMCHRT.WB3
  TAMKYBD.WB3
These are Quatro Pro Version 7 spreadsheet files which contain the
Character-Keyboard Dependencies Chart and the Keyboard Layout.  The printout
of these files may be easier to read than the graphics in the online help.
