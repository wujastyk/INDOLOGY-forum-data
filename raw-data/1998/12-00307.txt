I should be most grateful for information on the following:

An English translation of Vagabhata's _Rasaratnasamuccaya_ was
published serially as a supplement to the Indian Journal of
History of Science from 1987-1992 (?).

I would like to know the extent of the work. Was it completed or
not?  And which chapters were published in which volumes of the
IJHS.

With much appreciation,

Ken Zysk
