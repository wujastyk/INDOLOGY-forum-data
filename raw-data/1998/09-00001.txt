Dear Indologists,
        I have a request about a marriage in the MBh, between arjuna and
subhadrA, the kRSNa's sister. A very important one: by it the continuity of
the lineage will be assured with abhimanyu.
        But vasudeva, the subhadra's father was the brother of kuntI, the
arjuna's mother, and hence the wife and husband were very close relatives.
        Is such a marriage (between first crossed cousins) a legal one?
        If not, the fact that zUra (biological father of subhadrA and
kRSNa) gave his just born daughter to kuntibhoja, son of his paternal aunt,
making him the legal father of kuntI, could make the marriage to be legal
(between third cousins)?

        I summarize:
(biological)
zUra > kuntI > arjuna
zUra > vasudeva > subhadrA
(official)
X > a woman > kuntibhoja > kuntI > arjuna
X > citraratha > zUra > vasudeva > subhadrA
        Thanks in advance,
Dominique
