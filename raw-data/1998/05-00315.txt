>?From the book in which the vacana translaton occurs.
AKR, Speaking of "Siva, Penguin, 1973, p. 62
"In kuuDalasangama, he found a guru, with whom he
studied the Vedas and other religious texts"
I would think in Kannada also, there is a long
tradition of kuuDalasangama as the place name.

Earlier N. Ganesan wrote
<<There was a suggestion that kuuDala is the place name and
sangamesvara refers to the God's name.kuuDala samngama is a place name.
How do we know this?There were two Chola era prabandhams of war, now
lost except for a few verses and their names occur in medieval
commentaries.The 10th century paraNi prabandhams are called
1) koppattup paraNi and 2) kuuDala sangamattup paraNi.
Hence, koppam and kuuDala sangamam will refer to place names.
AND, kuuDala sangamam is hybrid name.This may very well be the case of
BelgAm too.>>
