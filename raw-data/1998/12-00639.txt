No, Zvelebil says his hypothesis is based on "the frequent occurrence of
the elements *ko-/koo- or *ku-/kuu- (DEDR 2178), (DEDR 1864) as well as
*mal-ay (DEDR 4742) in the names which various Dravidians used to
identify themselves." (the same book, p. 50).

We'd have to see what the 'Elam' in Iran means.

I dimly recall that someone had reported a Tamil inscription from New
Zealand, but I don't have the reference here, nor can I say whether the
identification is correct. And there is the hypothesis of a relationship
between Dravidian and Japanese. When I first heard this on NHK (the
Japanese shortwave radio) and mentioned it to Zvelebil, he was utterly
skeptical (he presumed it was just another kookie theory), but several
years down the road, in that book from Pondicherry, he has devoted a
short chapter to the matter. But all this is still in a hypothetical
stage.
