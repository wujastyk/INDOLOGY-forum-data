I would still claim that any language, in terms of grammar and morphology,
is capable of transmitting any value system.

The problem is, of course, the vocabulary and concepts connected with the
culture, as you say. However, vocabularies are not static. They develop,
partly through loans, partly through the development of new meanings to
words. Thus, a language that at a given moment in time lacks the words or
concepts necessary to express a certain set of values, can be made to do so
over time, just as it can loose the ability to express values it could
express before. My point is: You have to see language as a flexible system.
To use Yiddish as an example: Used for a 1000 years by Jews, and only by
Jews, it would of course have all the concepts necessary to express Jewish
values. However, if you convinced the British upper class to use Yiddish
instead of the Queen's English, it could equally well be manipulated to
express English upper class values. The same argument applies to any other
language.

Consequently, I will still maintain that a language is a neutral agent.
