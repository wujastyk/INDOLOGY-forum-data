I do not think this explanation is valid. These slokas occur in the context
of explaining the lengthening of the day in uttarAyana and the shortening
in dakSiNAyana.

   rAzipramAnAjanitA dIrghahrasvAtmatA dinE 2.8.46(2)
   tathA nizAyAM rAzInAM pramANairlaghudIrghatA
   dinAdErdIrghahrasvatvaM tadbhOgEnaiva jAyatE 2.8.47

Obviously the context here is not the ahOrAtra of dEvAs but of
earthly beings.

sarma.
