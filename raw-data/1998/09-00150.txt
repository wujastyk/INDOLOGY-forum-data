Dear Mr. Ganesan:

I find this compilation really interesting... Ofcourse, the Indology novice
in me wonders if there is a connection between Potalaka and Sabarimala.. the
ardurous journey (something we still follow), the river Pampa, the Amman
temple next to the temple of Lord Ayyappa (Here according to the legend, the
goddess is not wedded to this lord of the hills)... the temple architecture
is reminiscent of Buddhist influence? The directions in the texts mentioned.
All very suggestive of some homology, if not similarity.

Thank you,

Lakshminarayan
