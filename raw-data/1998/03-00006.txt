I haven't got time to comment upon this, but I can't contain myself:

Just as part of the general argument, I would like to supply the information
that both East Norwegian and West Swedish have produced retroflexion. So
have some South Italian dialects. All quite independent of Skt.

The argument I have seen revolves around the idea that the Iranians refer to
airyanam varsha and thereby mean aryavarta in India. They are, apparently,
unaware of the fact that the Iranians called their *own* country by that
name, and that the modern term for Iran is derived through normal
phonological development from airyanam (the Middle Persian term, I believe,
is Eran).
