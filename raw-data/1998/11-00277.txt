Dear Mr. Karp,

Please post Dr. Jan Braun's address.
On Elamitic and Dravidian, only David
McAlpin's books and one review are known.

May be, Prof. Braun can be requested to
post a summary and a list of words here?

Regards,
N. Ganesan

Aside: Do you know Prof. K. Nachimuthu who was
in Warsaw for 2 years and left for Trivandram?
