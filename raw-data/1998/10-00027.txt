I downloaded the ramayan1.zip (700 KB) containing the first
six slokas. It is a great effort no doubt and Monsueir Andre must
congratulated for his nice idea. But the pronunciation
is far from satisfactory. This indicates that there is a need
for Ramayana and similar works in the form of audio cassettes.

sarma.
