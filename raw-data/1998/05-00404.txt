Dear John Smith, I have been really happy to receive your response.
Regarding the inscription, I need comparative material - mainly
epigraphical one - to give an adequate historical and linguistical
collocation to this small inscription. In the meanwhile, let me offer you
the small results of such a study in progress. Paleographically, the
inscription's characters fit very well with the specimens from Sirohi
district belonging to XIII-XIV century. The engraving is rather rough, so
that it shows the secondary importance of the commitment.
The tentave reading so far detected by me is as follows:
1.      siddham || sa?vat 1349 phagu?a ?udi 5 ravidivyo | u esa (?)
y?cchaka kva(?) dh?c? ya(?) san?to ?r^ Siddhasanasuri ?r^(?) Vikrama(?)
2.      bhadr?saha draja(?) sakha?ga?aputtra suta som?j? s^tala e(?)s^?ha
usas dra  bhaya s^havasan?th? (raralu?)
3.       padamadgarap?la | deh?suta naradeva (ka?) dh^j? | prat? (?)
kya(ka?)lpy?? je gamala {ma?gala} ||

The date has been tested as corresponding to AD 1292, February 24th,
sunday. The language should be a kind of early Gujarati, but on order to
get a better idea I need to see several inscriptions of this type, but in
Italy libraries are not so well endowed with...
Moreover, I add the scanty bibliography available to me at moment:

Literature, Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, XVI (June
1954-March 1955). Poona.

As attachment you will find a short note (in Italian language) on the small
item, written in McIntosh - Microsoft Word 5.1.
Any kind of suggestion and emprovement of the study - through
bibliographical material for instance - well be greatly wellcome!
Many thanks. Riccardo Garbini.



sincerely yours,riccardo
