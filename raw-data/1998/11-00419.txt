As for point 2) You can refer to: Anthony J. Alston, *A /SaMkara Source
Book*, 6 volls., Shanti Sadan, London 1986-1993 (I am not sure about the
dates of publication). The passages are all translated into English, and
no original sankrit is quoted. The reference edition is Gita Press
unless otherwise specified. The volumes are thematical, one being derived
to the polemic with rival schools, another to the concept of the soul, and
so on. As far as I know Alston is a pupil of Hari Prasad Shastri.
