Please examine RV 1.116 more closely. You will see that, besides having 100
oars, these "ships" had Atmans [Atmanva'tIbhiH] [and thus alive], they swam
in the sky [antarikSapru'dbhiH], and were far from water [a'podakAbhiH, if
we accept the explanation of Lueders, in *VaruNa*, p.115].

Elsewhere in this hymn there is referemce to chariots with 100 feet [st.
4], to a horse's hoof from which 100 jugs of wine are poured [st. 7], etc.,
etc.

This ocean by the way is without basis, without support, and ungraspable
[st. 5: anArambhaNe' ...anAsthAne' agrabhaNe' samudre'].

I think that Michael Witzel's point was that we can't expect such wildly
mythological material to lead us to any solid conclusions about geography.

Wouldn't you agree?
