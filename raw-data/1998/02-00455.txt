parAzarA is supposed to be one of the famous ancient astronomers.
But in viSNupurANa he appears to believe that the Sun in addition to  going
round the zodaic once in an year, goes round the zodaic once
in a day also as can be seen from the following verses in viSNupurANa.

        ahOrAtrENa yO bhuKktE samastA rAzayO dvija  2.45.(2)
        SaDEva rAzIn yO bhuKktE rAtrAvanyAJsca SaDdivA 2.46(1)

But this could have been easily found to be incorrect by the observation
at the time of a total solar eclipse.

Thank you in advance for any elucidation of this.

regards,

sarma.
