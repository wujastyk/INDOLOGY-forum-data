Hello,

I also think that this is an issue of great importance.

A little off topic, I would like to mention the web site created by Shigeki
Moro, in which he attempts to gather information about all the available
Buddhist e-texts of Chinese Taisho Canon (available online or in CD-ROM,
etc.).  It is at:

http://www.bekkoame.or.jp/i/moro/ebt_index/

It is certainly not very complete; and the site itself could be improved
(for example by using some web form, to let people who watch these pages to
send informations...), but I think that this is a very good beginning.

There is an electronic discussion group, in a Japanese commercial BBS called
NiftyServe, dealing with problems related to Asian humanity studies and the
use of computer (in which there are many scholars of Buddhism).  Mr. Moro is
an active member of this discussion group, and we can assist him to improve
his web site.

I am sure that Indology list can play a similar role if some member decides
to build a web site of "union list" of Indology related e-texts.

Best regards,
