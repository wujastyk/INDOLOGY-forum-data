Subject: a question on viSNu and dadhIchi
Message-ID: <161227041298.23782.2795310231149096072.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Tamil kantapurANam refers to a story where viSNu tries to attack dadhIchi
with his discus but the discus loses its sharp edge and turns harmless as a
potter's wheel. I would like to know more details of this story and references
from the Sanskrit side.
