You might try Prof. J.C.Wright, at cw3 at soas.ac.uk.

He has just retired, but may still be available. SOAS's contacts with the Vrindavan Research Institute have loosened since the deaths of Drs. Mukherjee, Gupta and now Wright's retirement. It may be preferable to communicate directly with the VRI. I am extremely sorry that I don't have the exact address or the name of the director, but I imagine that a letter written to the director, VRI, Vrindavan, Mathura, UP should reach its destination.
