Subject: prajnAnam Anandam brahma
Message-ID: <161227040970.23782.9696708433670337774.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Can somebody point me to a reference in one of the principal upanishads
where the sentence prajnAnam Anandam brahma occurs? aitareya has
prajnAnam brahma, while bRhadAraNyaka has vijnAnam Anandam brahma. I
couldn't find a reference where prajnAnam and Anandam are put together.

Thanks,

Vidyasankar
