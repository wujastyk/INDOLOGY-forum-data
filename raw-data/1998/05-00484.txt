Subject: A question on Jain temples
Message-ID: <161227039047.23782.13046489261739116002.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In the worshipping rituals of Jain temples of South India, were there any
intermediaries like brahmin priests? Who administered these temples? Lay
persons or monks or other intermediaries?

Thanks in advance.
