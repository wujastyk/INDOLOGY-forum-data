Subject: Indic transliteration scheme 2.03 on the Web
Message-ID: <161227037409.23782.12689654101276555334.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In the plain text form of the Tables, the transliterations of CANDRA E,
CANDRA O have been corrected to e_breve, o_breve, respectively.

Again, my apologies,    Tony
