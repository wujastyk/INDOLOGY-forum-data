sorry for wasting the band width, but I would like to know if other
subscribers also receive my posts "as attachments". If you do, please
forward the entire message to: sreeni at ktp.uni-paderborn.de

I checked the Indology list archives and there I don't see my message
as "an attachment", nor the copy (of my own posting) I received.

I am puzzled ...
