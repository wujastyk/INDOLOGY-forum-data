Dear members of the list,

We are arranging language-laboratory practice for students of Hindi and
would be very grateful for information about audio tapes of Hindi
conversational material (with accompanying text) which we might be able to
order.

If the recorded conversations accompany a textbook, and/or are accompanied
by drill or exercise materials, that would be even more useful.

With many thanks (as usual!), and best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
