As far as I know there is no reference in sanskrit literature for
specially high sexual powers of elephants. Horse is  slightly connected
with sexual power. Aphrodisiacs are known as 'vAjIkaraNa auSadha'. But I
suspect that it is the untiring capacity to gallop of a horse that is
linked with the sexual activity of men rather than the actual sexual
prowess of horses.

The word vAjIkaraNa can be interpreted another way also. That which gives
men the capacity for men to ride women as though they are horses. Anology
between sexual intercourse and horse rinding is ancient and pancultural.

sarma.
