True enough. However, if you read Kautilya's Arthashastra (which is my most
important reference "idea bank" for ancient Indian politics) you get a very
clear impression of punishment as a mechanism for social control. Religion
is interestingly enough portrayd as a means of increasing this control and
manipulating the populace (a function of religion that seems to be prevalent
all over the world). As always, when we discuss opinions - today or in
earlier times - the crucial question is: Says who? The ideas of people
involved in the business of politics may have been different from the ideas
expressed by the priest caste. But it is perfectly correct that spheres that
we keep clearly apart today, were not kept apart in the same manner in
ancient societies.

It depends on how you would analyse it. It was brought up in a "modern"
context, as an answer to something Jean Fezas assumed that I was saying. In
a modern context, Medhatithi's arguments are simplistic. However, I think
that they are simplistic in his own context as well as a discussion of the
"value" of punishment. Punishment in the Arthashastra is strictly functional
- the typical punishment is a fine, which boosts the treasury of the king.
If I remember correctly, I don't think Kautilya mentions purification of the
criminal at all (but correct me if I am wrong). The argument may seem
theologically sound to a philosopher or a priest, but their approaches are
sometimes idiosyncratic, as we can see with theologians even today.
