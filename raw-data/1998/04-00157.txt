I want to set one record straight. The teacher of rAmaswAmi dIkSitar
in vocal music is the tanjAvur AsthAna vidvAn vIrbhadrayya, a telugu
man. rAmasvAmi dIkSitar learnt upto AlApana and pallavi svaras from him.
This fact is usally underplayed in taking about the musical tradition
of muddusvAmi dIkSitar.
