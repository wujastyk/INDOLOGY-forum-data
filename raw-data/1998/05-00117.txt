One could find notices like this in many culture. For example, both
the Chinese and Japanese cultures place the horse fairly prominently
in their cultures. However, neither was  a nomadic horse
culture. I'm no expert in IE mythology, but I don't recall the horse
as a particularly important symbol in the Greek, Roman, Persian or
Celtic mythology I've read. We do encounter the symbol, but not in
the same sense as in Mongol or Turkic legend, where the horse was
central to life itself.

It played a role maybe in the Rgveda, but not such a major role.

There may have been horse figures among the IVC.  However, my point
there is no evidence of  a horse culture entering India.  There is
some evidence of domesticated horses entering India, and horses do
appear in the Rgveda. However, I'm at a lost to how anyone could
derive anything remotely similar to Kurgan or Scythian culture from
reading the Vedas.  These latter people lived on mare's milk and horseback.
