For those who know Tamil/Malayalam, the actual symbol makes little
difference; humans can get used to almost anything. I no longer
blanch when I see z for "s.  But for others,
z-underdot may be too confusing: There have been people who thought
that the sound is a voiced retroflex >sibilant<, a sound that is rare,
and not found in modern Dravidian languages, but is reconstructed for
proto-IA. I have never heard it in any natural language, but it is not
hard to voice .s, and the result does not sound anything like the sound
in question.

I doubt that there is any easy answer. Any choice will confuse those
who have never heard it.
