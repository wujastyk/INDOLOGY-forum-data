                [Posting on behalf of an acquaintance]

---------------------------------------
Could you pl. provide any information on Bhuleswar temple near Pune,
where I could see, for the first time, Goddess Vinayaki - the female Ganesha,
and also female Shiva (not ardhanariswara!), female Garuda, female Vishnu ...
I find it fascinating. Are there any scholarly studies on this interesting
temple?

Meanwhile I could find 3 monographs on _Vinayaki_, and references to her
in matsya & skanda purana-s. What about others?

Thanks!

mfG,
R.Braun
