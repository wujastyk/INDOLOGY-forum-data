No early religion or scripture suggest a theory of evolution similar to
Darwin. As for God's actions, scripture does not contradict Darwin as
long
as it does not suggest a creative method or procedure that is different
from the one suggested by Darwin. In principle, God may be behind
evolution. But strictly speaking, scientific models do not include God.
They only deal with what can be studied systematically and explained in
natural terms. God is beyond the reach of science, which can neither
prove
nor disprove his existence.

 What about Dasavataarams of Vishnu? Does this concept
 have anything to with Darwin's theory?

 N. Ganesan
