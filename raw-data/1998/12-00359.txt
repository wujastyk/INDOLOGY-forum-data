Not really.  In fact, most broad recent genetic studies show that
Northern Indians are closer to Asians than to Europeans or North
Africans.

Genetics are hardly the smoking gun that some believe.

Solar Aryans (predominantly dolicocephalic) came later.

Actually, in terms of long-headed and broad-headed people, the reverse
happened.  I don't know about solar and lunar "Aryans."

Again, not really.

The evidence is quite mixed.  Only a few genetic studies show that
Dravidians are more closely related to Africans.  In fact, most studies
try a bit too hard to deny any connection.
