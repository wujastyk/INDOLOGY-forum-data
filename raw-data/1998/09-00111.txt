I apologise to INDOLOGY members for the commercial advertising sent to the
list by
       ROCKLAND <rockland at DEL2.VSNL.NET.IN>
apparently representing an insensitive and unscrupulous company called
      JTA Communications
The terms and conditions of the INDOLOGY list are well-known to everyone,
and clearly explained in our documentation.  It is an academic list for
scholarly exchanges.  The internet is saturated with commercialism and
profit-seeking activities: our little group is a haven of academic and
intellectual activity, aimed only at nurturing the growth of knowledge
concerning classical India.

The above company has crudely taken advantage of our scholarly list, by
subscribing under false pretences in order to promote its self-interest
through inappropriate advertising. I must ask you whether you would
consider it wise to have any contact with such a company, especially in
any financial transaction.

Please spread this warning to anyone you know who might have been
considering using the services of JTA Communications.

All the best,
Dominik
