Friends and respected scholars:

A few Indology listmembers asked me for this information.  Here is the
details of my book on RSS and BJP. I am posting this information here
because I make NO PROFIT on it, therefore, I believe, it passes the ethical
standards of posting in usenets and mailing lists.

Some of you may know that I was in RSS, BJP (Jana Sangh), and Vidyarthi
Parishad for more than fifteen years of my life. Yes, this life.

If you want to get an overview of the book, please look up the proXsa
(www.foil.org) website.

I would much appreciate if you let friends know about the book on RSS and
BJP. I heard that Dr. Asghar Ali Engineer is writing a review in his
journal. Dr. Partha Chatterjee is also reading it. I will try to post their
comments when I get them.

If you/they want to get a copy of the book, please send me an email to
partha at capital.net

The price is $15; please add $5 for mailing.

Thanks.

Partha

p.s. -- If you school or organization wants a copy, please write me or my
publisher. Publisher's address is: S. Balwant, Ajanta Books International,
1-U.B., Jawahar Nagar, Delhi 110007, India.
