In the Cologne online Digital Lexicon, the word "ratha" is given the following
meanings.

ratha

chariot (lighter and swifter than the %{anas} q.v.) , any vehicle or equipage

L. ; a limb , member , part L. ; Calamus Rotang L. ; Dalbergia Ougeinensis L.

The word "tariratha" is given the following meaning.

tariratha
Meaningm. `" boat-wheel "' , an oar L.

Has the word "ratha" been used in Sanskrit texts to refer to the wheel per se
instead of the chariot/wagon? Is the meaning "wheel" found in Vedic?

Thanks in advance.
