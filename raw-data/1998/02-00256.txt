I wish someone would make a handlist of the names of Buddhist sects
occurring in inscriptions to update Lamotte's avowedly incomplete list. It
would be extremely useful. Actually, it's the sort of thing that would be
well-done on the Net,  perhaps as a collective effort.

You sometimes find Theravaada used in this way in verse. Plainly it _can_
be a bahu-vriihi compound used as a noun.

Well, I think you are right. Yes, Sarvaastivaada and Theravaada can
probably be used as adjectives in Sanskrit. But you wouldn't often find
that in well-written prose. I would certainly say to students that they
should use Sarvaastivaadin and Theravaadin as the adjectival forms in
English. I would also simply say that the alternative is wrong to avoid
unnecessary complication.
