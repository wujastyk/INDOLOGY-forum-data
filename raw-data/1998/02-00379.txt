Not necessarily in conflict with Mormon mythology.  The Mormons don't claim
that the American people Jesus visited have "lost tribe" status.  They also
explicitly teach that America was only one stop on a kind of "world tour"
for Jesus, and that we don't yet have any record of where else he hung out.
So why not Kashmir?

There is some contradiction, though: the Mormon idea is that Jesus started
globe-trotting after the resurrection, so while they probably wouldn't
object to the concept of Jesus in India, they wouldn't likely buy the idea
that his grave is there.
