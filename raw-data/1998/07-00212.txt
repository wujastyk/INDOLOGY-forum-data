But it does.

We pay too much attention to phonology, because that was the main
istinction in medieval India. But some registers of Sanskrit show
Prakritic influence in morphology. In case of syntax and the steady
loss of indeclinables (to be replaced by case forms or gerunds) this
conclusion is inescapable.

Also, I don't see any difference between vatersprache and gurubhaashaa
in this matter.

What about those who have voice/voiceless distinction, but not
aspiration (typical of priests in minor temples in Tamil Nadu) :-)
