I do not know if you understand Dutch (I see you have .BE as country code), but maybe you understand 3) if I say

1) rama geeft nala een boek
rama - gives - nala - a book
2) een boek wordt door rama aan nala gegeven
a book - is - by rama - to nala - given
3) nala is een boek gegeven geworden (door rama) / gegeven doen worden
nala - is - a book - been given (by rama) / given cause to be

Here, the idea of dative-like subject is felt.
