This is as bad an assumption that they are!

But evidence shows indeed that cultural processes do have plenty of
determinism even if not at the same level as physical processes. Look at
civilization all around you. Why do they all modern civilizations
resemble
each other?  Why do traditional civilizations resemble each other? If
they
do not, then what exactly causes scholars to create these categories?

What you are writing contradicts even what social scientists themselves
say and do.

What you want to say is something like "we do not yet have equations
like Maxwell's
Equations of sociology".

That's true enough but it never stopped economists from posing theories
and
testing them using math and statistics. The only thing stopping social
scientists and historical linguists is inertia and obstructionism.

BUT: Having said that, I'll say once

Yes, they should use more :-)
