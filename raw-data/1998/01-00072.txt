A new issue of Acta Orientalia (ediderunt Societates Orientales Danica,
Fennica, Norvegica, Svecica)  has  come out with the following contents:

Abdelmadjid Allaoua: Sur les pronoms personnels: questions d'autonomie
primitive (pp. 7-23)
Jaakko Hameen-Anttila: Qur. 53: 19, the prophetic experience and the
"Satanic verses" - a reconsideration (pp. 24-34)

of cooking in Modern Chinese (pp. 152-184)
Book reviews (pp. 185-294)

My earlier appeal for more subscriptions to save Acta Orientalia from
ceasing publication seems to have had some effect (many thanks for all who
responded positively), but we are still near the danger zone.  It would
help us to keep Acta Orientalia alive if we got some more subscriptions!!

placed with Munksgaard International Publishers, PB 2148, DK-1016
