In Normandie a number of Norse place names have been conserved and even some
personal names are continued in last names such as Anquetil P Anskjetill (or
something similar). In the reverse situation we get a similar effect: onomastic
studies easily reveal the Gallic components in the place names of France and the
Greco-Roman component in the place names of the Arab speaking parts of the
Mediterranean.So we have here perfect counterexamples of the situation in Northern
India were we do not find a Dravidian layer in the names of places and persons.

No doubt they were coming IN, but they were also going OUT and the questions are
then when and whence did they come in and when did some go out and to what places
did they go.

This is itself a political statement and I am not the least interested in that.
