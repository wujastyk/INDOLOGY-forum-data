Isn't Vasistha connected with Eastern India in later literature?
Some intereresting facts about Vasistha:

1. He promoted cow worship (among beef-eaters?).
2. He raised tens sons on King Sudas' wife (among patriarchal
    peoples?)
3. In later literature he is the priest of Danavas and Daityas.

But the Avesta is in neighboring Iran several centuries after the
proposed "invasion".  If the Avestan language is younger, then using
the standard  presumption we should suggest a migration from east to
west.

Is there a religion of the Rgveda?  Or do these simply reflect a
particular type of hymn to certain deities.  Besides we should not be
comparing the Rgveda or Avesta only to IVC seals. Is there anything
in Iran or Central Asian remotely more "Vedic" in nature?

Highly questionable.  We have to question the "Aryan" identification
here.  A lot of presumptions used to back up other presumptions.

Well, soma is a particularly interesting subject. Didn't it come from
the Himalayas (Mt. Mujavant).

All very questionable.  Maybe we should discuss each passage that
supposedly speaks of migration.  How in the world can you be sure
that Rasaa is the Volga?

Mass migrations are not usually forgotten by people.  We should not
have to thread together tidbits if the Vedic peoples really did
migrate from all the way from the Volga.  All of this should be very
clearly spelled out.
