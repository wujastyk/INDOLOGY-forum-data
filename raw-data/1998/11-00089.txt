Again you have ignored the fact that culture does not require monks to
spread. The extremely close similarities between the Scythians
and the Hsiung-nu, for example.

Also, the similarities described are really as striking as you seem to
suggest.  For example, have horse-human burials been found in India?
They were common in Altaic-speaking and over the area inhabited by
Uralic speakers.  How about burials with a horse's head combined with a
human body?
