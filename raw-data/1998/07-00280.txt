Subject: Velthuis' Devnag preprocessor in Perl

I ported an early version of Velthuis's Devnag program
to Perl. The Perl version ran much slower in those days (about
5 years ago) but with today's faster computers, it should
be ok. I can send those who are interested the Perl script.
Once again, this is based on an older version of the Devnag
C source file.
