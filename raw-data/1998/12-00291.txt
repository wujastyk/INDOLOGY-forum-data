Garn!  Of course, you are right.  I was thinking of computer media.
However, maybe only books printed on acid-free paper will be around in 50
years.  Most of what is published in the 20th century will not survive the
acid and chlorine in its own fibres.   Talk to librarians about this if
you feel like getting seriously depressed.

All the best,
Dominik
