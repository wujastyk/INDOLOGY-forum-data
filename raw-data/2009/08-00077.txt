If the Halle servers are indeed suffering from inadequate bandwidth
&c. then it might help to use a dedicated download manager rather than
one's web browser to get hold of the material. I've found Sun
Microsystems' `Download Manager' useful (it can also automatically
unzip archives after the download):

 Sun Download Manager 2.0 :: Download
 http://www.sun.com/download/sdm/download.xml

This application is free and runs on any system with Java installed on
it. Reasonably exhaustive instructions are available here:
