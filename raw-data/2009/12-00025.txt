Surely ?K?lid?sa?s Ritusa?h?ra, too well-known, has not been missed. The seasons are often enumerated in the Atharvaveda.

Could anyone direct me to interesting passages describing the seasons in
Sanskrit poetry and any articles or books that have been written about
'rtu-varnana'?
Thank you very much,
Venetia
