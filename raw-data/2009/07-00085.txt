Invitation to the workshop
The Jaina and the British
Collaboration and Conflict, Concealment and Contribution during the 19th and
early 20th century

19th/20th February 2010

University of T?bingen
Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies (AOI)
Department of Indology and Comparative Religion

Some questions we would like to discuss:
* Which Jaina entrepreneurs were among the most successful middlemen on
behalf of the British East India Company, and the Empire? How did these
successful Jaina invest their profits for religious or for social purposes?
* Are the life histories of influential Jaina merchants exceptional or do
they reflect the general history of their local communities?
* How do the Jaina perceive their own role in the 19th century? Do oral and
written family histories, as produced during the last 150 years, provide
answers and questions?
* What kind of references to the Jaina community can be traced in journals
of British travellers, missionaries, or British East India Company employees
during the 19th century? How are ?the Jainas? characterized in these
accounts? 
* How do these findings correspond with those data of German sources from
the late 19th and early 20th centuries? Why were German indologists more
successful in getting access to Jaina manuscripts than the British
researchers? 
* Which ? newly formed or existing ? Jaina institutions, organisations or
outstanding personalities openly promoted the study of sacred texts in spite
of the opposition among orthodox Jaina?
* Did the ?discovery? of ?Jainism? as an independent religious tradition
have an effect on the Jaina?s entrepreneurial position within the colonial
economy? 
* To what extent do recent Jaina demands for the legal acknowledgement of
their minority status refer to findings of the late 19th century scholars?
* Which ? newly formed or existing ? Jaina institutions, organisations or
outstanding personalities successfully promoted the revival of the almost
extinct mendicant orders during the 19th century?
