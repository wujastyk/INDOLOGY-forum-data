Dear Petteri,

I seem to remember receiving a message from you some time ago about a 
proposed Festschrift for Klaus Karttunen; but I can't find any record of it. 
Is my memory correct, or just fantasy?

In any case, if there is such a project, and if it is not too late to submit 
something, I do have a short article which would be appropriate for it. 
Please let me know about this,

Thanks

Richard
