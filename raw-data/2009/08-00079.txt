Hej, Ulrich! G?r det godt med dej?

This is unscientific--and perhaps entirely anachronistic--but since  
you are urgently in need, I figured I'd give it a go:

The end of the name, I would suggest, is more than likely Bih?ral?la.  
Nowadays, it would be pronounced Bih?r L?l.  "L?l" is a pretty  
common name, to this day. (Consider the early 17th century Hindi poet  
Bih?r? L?l.)

The beginning is more difficult, perhaps. It could refer to a  
particular vih?ra (b?h??), but I don't know of one by that name.  
It is possible that it could be a vih?ra founded by (a) M?nadeva,  
which was known as "M?navih?ra." But, my hunch is that it is in fact  
m?na, but for another reason. M?na ("M?n" today) is also a commonly  
occurring name in that region (e.g the contemporary Nepali politician  
Gopal Man Shrestha [gop?lam?na ?re??ha]).

I'm not at all confident these names were current in the period you're  
talking about (I don't see anything like it in the few inscriptions I  
have to hand), but anyway, that's my hypothesis: M?navih?ral?la (or,  
in a contemporary idiom, M?n Bih?r L?l).

Sorry to say I have no idea who he was.

Med venlig hilsen,

Christian
