Subject: "samsara" meaning "life"

The Hindi world maps they sell here in India use the word "samsaara" on 
them for "world". Or maybe "samsaar", I don't have one in front of me.

Although they show the planet quite accurately, they don't seem to have 
an 'exit' marked anywhere, so they aren't much use for religious purposes.

Best,

I used the word 'world' not in its strict literal sense but more in the sense of life in general ie in the sense of the relevant world. Like samasaara 'world'  too has polysemous facets. 'Lara is the greatest batsman in the world' should mean 'in the cricketing world' and not 'in the universe'. Sorry for too much advice!
