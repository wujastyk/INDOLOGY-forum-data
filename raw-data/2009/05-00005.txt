Dominik,

Sorry for the delay, but mail takes a long time to get to Australia!

Your friend may be interested in the following article by myself, Richard Salomon, and two scientists:

Allon, Mark, R. Salomon, G. Jacobsen, and U. Zoppi. 2006. ?Radiocarbon Dating of Kharo??h? Fragments from the Sch?yen and Senior Manuscript Collections.? In Jens Braarvig, ed., Buddhist Manuscripts III. Manuscripts in the Sch?yen Collection 4, pp. 279?91. Oslo: Hermes Publishing.

If he wants a pdf, I'll send it to you.

Regards
Mark Allon
