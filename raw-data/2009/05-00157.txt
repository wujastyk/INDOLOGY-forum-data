Subject: Movies on Shankaracharya et al AND saving word docs as pdf
Message-ID: <161227086577.23782.12411779891882957511.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

G V Iyer (the maker of Sanskrit film on Adi Shankaracharya) also made films
on other great Hindu figures:

Ramanujacharya (in Tamil) can be bought at:

Madhvacharya (in Kannada)can be bought at:
http://www.vedanta.com/store/product361.html

Also, regarding saving word documents as pdf, I would like to share that
MS-Word 2007 has a built-in option for this, just click on save as and then
choose pdf (you will need to install a microsoft plugin to enable this
feature, available at:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041&displaylang=en
)

Hope this helps,

Best,
Pankaj
