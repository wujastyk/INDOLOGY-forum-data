I'd really like to see some of the lesser studied Tantric texts, for
starters, the Gandharva Tantra and the several volumes available in the
Tantrasa?graha Series edited by V.V Dvivedi in the Yogatantra-Grantham?l?
published by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University and Brahm?nanda Giri's
??kt?nandatara?gi??.
