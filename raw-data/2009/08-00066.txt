It is wonderful to have the ZDMG available for download.  But I downloaded a number of articles, only to find that they could not be opened (by my Acrobat 7) because they were "damaged" and "could not be repaired."  Have others had the same problem, or is it unique to me?

Just scroll down the third column on the right-hand side to the bottom of
