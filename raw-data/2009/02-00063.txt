Subject: AW: Macdonell and Whitney Grammars [DjVu format at Internet              Archive]
Message-ID: <161227084847.23782.10664725777234951564.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is so much to learn here, though not necessarily with regard to the
original question. I still have to figure out what recommends the "Internet
Archive" DjVU image files and their unusable "Full Text" alternatives, when
there is a GRETIL e-book with a fully searchable background text,
standardized diacritics (Whitney) in accented and unaccented versions
(Whitney's "Roots"), bookmarks for navigation, etc.

This brings me back to the original question:

"Does anyone on the list have information on the availability of ETEXTS" of
the said works, other than these?

_Roots-ACCENTED.pdf

_Roots-UNACCENTED.pdf

[For more go here

and enter "Whitney", "Macdonell", etc.,

or click the "All titles" button in the left frame.]

 

Cheers,
