Subject: ZDMG articles downloadable as single files

Interrupted downloads were indeed the problem.  (Downloading from India, so it may be a problem on my end, although I have not been having this problem with other sites.)  I am having success now with Down Them All for Firefox.   Thanks for the tips.

If the Halle servers are indeed suffering from inadequate bandwidth
&c. then it might help to use a dedicated download manager rather than
one's web browser to get hold of the material. I've found Sun
Microsystems' `Download Manager' useful (it can also automatically
unzip archives after the download):

 Sun Download Manager 2.0 :: Download
 http://www.sun.com/download/sdm/download.xml

This application is free and runs on any system with Java installed on
it. Reasonably exhaustive instructions are available here:

Kind regards,
