There are haMsas in the Dhammapada (91, 175), and the equivalent 
verses in the Patna Dharmapada (231, 232) and Udanavarga (17.1, 
17.2); also their path in Uv. 12.12. The DhammapadaTThakathA (c. 5th 
century CE) on Dhp 91explains that, when the birds are leaving a 
pond, they don't think, 'This is my water, my lotus, my water-lily, 
my pericarp': they just go.
