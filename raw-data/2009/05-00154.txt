Dear Stephen,

I am familiar with gzhi gsum as a Vinaya term,
referring to the three basic rites of
po.sadha, upavaasa, and pravara.na.
But this does not seem to be suitable
for your context. 

As Stein pointed out (Tibetica Antiqua I),
the conventions adopted in Tibetan translations
from Chinese are sometimes quite different from
the "standard" Tibetan Buddhist vocabulary,
and have not so far been very extensively documented --
Stein's work was a great start, but much remains
to be done.

best,
Matthew
