Subject: Chancelier in a French University
Message-ID: <161227086882.23782.10698471060902170566.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Professor Houben,
Could you kindly let me know the if the term ?'Chancelier', with reference to a French University, means what one understands by 'Vice-Chancellor' in India or by 'Rektor'?in Holland or Germany. The French equivalent is 'Recteur', I heard somewhere.
Will you kindly clarify?
Best wishes
DB
