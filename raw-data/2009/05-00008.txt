Message-ID: <161227086107.23782.12574010489654482647.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues,
I am working on a 19th century Jain manuscript in Hindi which contains three 'Sanskrit' slokas. Well sort of, they are as follows, any guesses on where they might be from or might mean? You are welcome to reply off list to me as well on clspgf at nus.edu.sg?if you can suggest any leads on them. thanks, Peter
