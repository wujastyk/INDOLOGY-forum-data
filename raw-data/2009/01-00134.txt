Subject: resending question on chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions and              conjugations?
Message-ID: <161227084659.23782.1722932994477532666.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Sorry about the bad formatting. Yahoo Mail has been acting up lately.

I was thinking of working with a pandit to create some mp3 files with 
chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions and conjugations for teaching 
purposes. They would be made freely available on the internet. I haven't 
yet found anything quite right for that purpose.


Has this already been done somewhere?


Best,


Dean
