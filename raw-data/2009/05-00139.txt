Subject: What Devanagari text would you most like as an e-text

E-publications can serve their purpose the best when out-of-print/ or difficult-to-purchase books are made available thru them. Examples
1.The Nalanda edition of the Tripitaka in Devnagari
2.Aryabhatiyam with Bhaskara 1 and Parameshvara
Best for all

In the last decade or two, a substantial amount of Sanskrit literature has become available in e-text form.? Veda, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Mahabhasya, Astadhyayi, Kasika, Puranas, many Tantras, dharmasastra and jyotisa texts, Buddhist literature, much else.

What next?? What text is there in Devanagari script that hasn't been input yet, and that you would dearly like to have as an e-text?? I wonder if we can put together a prioritized list?

Best,
