Dear Friends

Ms Tomomi Sato, a Sanskrit student at the ANU, has created a wonderful 
website on the trees and flowers of the Meghaduta. For each item, she 
provides her own artwork, the relevant verse, an audio file with her own 
recitation, and translations into English and Japanese.  I and delighted 
to invite you to view Tomomi's beautiful work. It is best viewed with 
Internet Explorer. It does not work with Firefox. To enable the sound 
files to play, you may have to disable ActiveX control.

Tomomi's website is here:

I'm sure Tomomi would be pleased to hear from you.  If you would like to 
send her a message offlist, she can be reached at:

Please feel free to circulate as widely as possible among friends and 
colleagues.

Yours

McComas
