Subject: ha.msa in para-ha.msa and ha.msa-samde/sa
In-Reply-To: <B4F75EA866F043B6BAA8DE13F8C00BF7@VICPC>

Hoping not to "grind flour" too much, I would say 
that the double ha.msa's quality of travelling 
freely the world and distinguishing milk mixed 
with water (cf. Slouber's post), as reminded in 
Puur.nasarasvatii Ha.msa-sa.mde/sa (9) :

pauna.hpu.nyaad bhuvanam akhila.m bhraamyata.h svairav.rtte.h
/saktasyoccair api samudite k.siiraniire vivektum |
maarga.m taavanmahita mahataa.m notsahe te pravaktu.m
j?aataj?aana.m na khalu sudhiyaa.m tu.s.taye pi.s.tape.sa.h ||

is enough for explaining why the name of this 
migrating and vivekin bird, as "parama" denotes a 
all-discriminating and super-liberated ascetic 
(=? in the poem the su-dhii to whom the path, 
maargam, to liberation is already known, 
j?aataj?aanam).
