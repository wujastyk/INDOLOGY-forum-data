Dear Colleagues,

I am writing as Academic Director of the South Asia Summer Language 
Institute (SASLI) to ask for your help in encouraging students to 
participate in this year's program.  SASLI is the nationally coordinated 
effort to ensure that less commonly taught South Asian languages are 
available to students for intensive study during the summer.  This year, 
SASLI intends to offer 14 languages (including Sanskrit) at both 
beginning and intermediate levels.  Graduate students are eligible for 
FLAS funding both through their home institution and through SASLI 
itself (deadline: Feb 20th, see the Funding link at our website).  
Undergraduates and graduates are also eligible for fee remission 
(partial or full).  There is no need for me to emphasize the importance 
of language study to all areas of South Asian studies.  So, I hope you 
will take a moment to make your students aware of this terrific 
opportunity and please forward this message to other listservs, as 
appropriate.  If you need any further details, please do not hesitate to 
contact me or Laura Hammond, Assistant Director of SASLI 
(ljhammond at wisc.edu).
