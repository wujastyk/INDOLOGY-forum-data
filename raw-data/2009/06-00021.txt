Greetings!
As for the Paippal?da-Samhit?,?corrections may indeed be found at any place near the original reading, but I do not remember having found small?comments eg. the commomly found rak.s?mntr?.h above or below the line. They occur either in the left margin or in the right.
When it is not a running commentary but only occasional gloss?of?the vrtti type?small lines may occur above the object line with some distinguishing features in late medieval Navya-Ny?ya manuscripts of Bengal.
Best wishes for all
DB?

Corrections are written on any margin: left, right, top or bottom and usually marked by a small cross (looks like this +), kakapada, or also some other sign(s).

This can be found from Kashmir to Comorin, whatever the script.? (Not to be confused with secondary word dividers or Vedic accents).

Sometimes also found above the word, especially as small glosses, tippani. In old MSS and in more recent ones. (I have seen it in those from c. 1150-1800, don't remember it for older ones such as the Skandapurana from Nepal, early 9th c., or Gandhara and Xinjiang MSS).

Paleontologists have discussed this before, since Buehler. A nice list is found in a local Nepalese paleography which I do not have at hand now.

Cheers,
Michael
