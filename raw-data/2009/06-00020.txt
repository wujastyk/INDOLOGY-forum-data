Thanks for your helpful comments.  The areas you mention are possibly 
significant for me, as is your mention of the Jains.  I wonder how 
conservative the Jain scribal traditions would have been.   Since there were 
several areas, such as Gujarat, in early medieval India where the Buddhists 
and the Jains rubbed shoulders, I wonder if they also shared similar mss 
scribal mannerisms at one time.  The problem for me, of course, is that 
almost all mss remains available are far too late for the period I am 
concerned with ~ roughly 200-350 CE or are neat monastic library exemplars, 
as I mention in my reply to Michael.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
