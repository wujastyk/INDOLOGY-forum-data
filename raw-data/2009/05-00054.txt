Dear List,

The Thieme article is found in his *Studien zur indogermanischen 
Wortkunde und Religionsgeschichte* [Berichte ueber die Verhandlkungen 
der Saechsischen Akad. d. Wissenschaften zu Leipzig. Phil.-Hist. Klasse, 
Band 98, Heft 5] 1952.  It is reprinted in the Weg d. Forschung series 
Band CLXIX 1970 [Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft].  The article does 
not deny that amrta can mean 'immortal.'  It argues that it can also 
mean 'having, giving life' ['lebendig, Lebenskraft spendend'], citing 
many Vedic passages.

I hope this helps.
