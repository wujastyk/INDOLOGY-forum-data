Subject: Devanagari Unicode fonts for the Mac?
In-Reply-To: <d313d8c10905131625s3fe7be62yae642acc0f7b6a09@mail.gmail.com>

Unfortunately, not all ligatures seem to work in this way: for example  
-Gg- (as in gaGgA) appears (both in NeoOffice and in Mail) as G+vir?ma 
+g (?????). This ligature I, for one, can only generate in  
TextEdit by enabling "All ligatures". Or is there any way to get  
around this problem?
Best wishes,
Sven Sellmer
