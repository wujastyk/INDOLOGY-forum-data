There are no "authorities" on the so-called Indus script, at least  
not if you take "script" in the linguistic sense, since obviously a  
lot of people no longer view it as a script. But scholarship isn't a  
matter of auctoritas, as I see it.

What are those arguments? Do you want to discuss them>

Further on Rao et al.: the linguistic community has been very harsh  
on that paper,and  for good reasons: Rao unambiguously made up data  
at the very center of his argument. I earlier posted the (now much  
expanded) critique by the computational linguist Mark Liberman, at  
the U. of Pennsylvania, who quotes us at length; there may be a  
reason for that:

On Liberman, see:

Now another very well-known computational linguist -- Fernando  
Pereira  -- points out why the statistical arguments of Rao's are  
meaningless. See:

This on Pereira (bio three years old).

Note that Pereira links to our article on Rao et al. that we wrote in  
a few hours right as Rao's article was appearing. Our piece has been  
downloaded over 30,000 times in the last three days, and there are  
links everywhere. There might be a reason for that.

Here's that link, which discusses Rao's invented evidence:

We end with a little argument about whether this was a "script" or  
not, and it doesn't use sophisticated statistics. I wonder, Pankaj,  
what you think about the argument? Here it is:
