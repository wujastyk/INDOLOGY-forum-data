Subject: Machine-readable version of the Mahabharata and Prof. Daniel              Ingalls

I just received the following note from Dan Ingalls, Jr., the son of  
Prof. Ingalls.

I am posting this (with Dan's permission) for comments.  My own  
feeling is that if Dan has an unbound copy, he could run it through a  
scanning machine and make available a graphic version -- surely the  
BORS edition of the MBh is one of the great achievements of 20th  
century scholarship in any field.  I don't know whether it is still  
under copyright.  As far as scanning it goes, I think the wiggly lines  
under many words would pose a problem -- and it would be almost  
impossible to scan the apparatus criticus, which is of course a vital  
part of the work.  But with Dan's fluency in smalltalk, perhaps these  
issues could be overcome.

For anyone interested in seeing Prof. Ingalls giving a lecture in 1980
