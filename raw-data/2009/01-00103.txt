Dear Herman, 
    I've come across this image of the lolling tongue, mostly in meditative
visualizations in Tantric texts dating from the 15th - 18th centuries.
For an example of other goddesses with a lolling tongue, this visualization
is to the Blue Goddess of Speech, N?lasaraswat?, who is also equated with
the Goddess T?r?, & the reference is from the N?lasaraswat? Tantra
2.49 caturbhuj?? lalijjihv?? mah?bh?m?? varaprad?m |
khadgakartrisam?yuktasavyetarabhujadvay?m ||

(this entire text of the visualization is longer than this). What I found
most interesting about the visualization is the scissors that she holds and
I think I've seen an actual image of this, though I'd have to track back to
remember where exactly. I'm thinking it may be in Buhnemann's text on
visualizations, which might also be quite helpful in your specific query.

If you're interested in more than just Sanskrit textual references, (which
seems to be what you're asking for,) you might be interested to take a look
at Schweder and Menon's article on Kali in Encountering Kali.
 
All best,
Loriliai
