Indeed, I should have said BR rather than MW, careless.

I've just finished the updates to the website. The index to the BHSD is now
publicly available.

http://www.ebmp.org/a_bhsd.php

I've also added, with permission, a combined electronic text of two articles
by Boris Oguib?nine which serve as supplements to the BHSD.

Oguib?nine, Boris. 2002. ?Materials for the Lexicography of Buddhist
Sanskrit of the Mah?s??ghika?Lokottarav?dins (I).? *Ch?? Gakujutsu Kenkyujo
Kiy?* ????????? *(Bulletin of the Ch?? Academic Research Institute)* 31:
44?92.

Oguib?nine, Boris. 2005. ?Materials for the Lexicography of Buddhist
Sanskrit of the Mah?s??ghika?Lokottarav?dins (II).? *Ch?? Gakujutsu Kenkyujo
