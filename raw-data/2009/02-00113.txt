Dominic,

Which journal and what publisher is this?  Also, am I right in thinking the title is Lexicographica not Lexicograpohica?

Allen


"There is a good article that many will know, that goes into this matter 
with subtlety and care:

Ladislav Zgusta, "Copying in Lexicography: Monier-Williams' Sanskrit 
Dictionary and other cases (Dvaikosyam)" Lexicograpohica 4 (1988): 
pp. 145-164."
