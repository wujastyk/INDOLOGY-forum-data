Subject: Obituaries for Friedhelm Hardy?
Message-ID: <161227087823.23782.1872169085378397710.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear All,

is there any obituary available online for the late Friedhelm Hardy,
who wrote the book /Viraha-bhakti : the Early History of K???a Devotion 
in South India/, Oxford University Press, 1983.

The only one I have been able to find is the short announcement by 
Richard Gombrich, available at:

<http://ochs.org.uk/node/201>

The BnF (Biblioth?que Nationale de France) seems to think he is still alive:

<http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/autorite?ID=12239830&idNoeud=1.1&host=catalogue>


It might also be the case with the Library of Congress 
<http://authorities.loc.gov/>, unless I misunderstand the codes used:


Thanks for any pointers
