In 2006 STIMW moved successfully to Manchester to continue to offer a 
forum for the discussion of papers on varied aspects of Indian 
religions. Papers have been presented by leading scholars in the 
field as well as by research students.  Papers are sent to 
participants in advance, so that they can be read and discussed in 
detail.  They are available to those who cannot attend for a small 
charge.
