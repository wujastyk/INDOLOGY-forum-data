The best way to contact Dr. Saroja Bhate these days is to email to: bori1 at vsnl.net .  Specify in the subject-line:  "Message for Dr. Bhate."  She is the current secretary of the Bhandarkar Institute.  I was recently in Pune and she responded to my emails sent to the Institute's email address.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
