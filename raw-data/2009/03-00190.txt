There is an anthology of Christian works in Sanskrit by Jean Calmette, S.J. (1692-1740), William Hodge Mill (1792-1853), John Muir (1810-1852), and Brahmabandhava Upadhyaya (1861-1907):

LC Control No.: 96902803 
Personal Name: Amaladass, Anand, 1943- 
Main Title: The Indian Christiad : a concise anthology of didactic and devotional literature in early Church Sanskrit / Anand Amaladass and Richard Fox Young.
Published/Created: Anand, Gujarat, India : Gujarat Sahitya Prakash, 1995.
Description: xviii, 378 p. ; 22 cm.

It includes a section of "Common Prayers" attributed by the editors to Calmette, many of them standard Catholic prayers translated into Sanskrit, others original compositions.  The editors believe these were at one time in actual use by South Indian Catholics, but that the memory of their use had been forgotten.

The bibiography at the end contains a section Church Sanskrit, of published and ms works of the genre, and another Secondary Sources, including some other discussions of the subject.
