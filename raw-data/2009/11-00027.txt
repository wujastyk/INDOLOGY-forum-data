Subject: Muni Shri Jambuvijayji Passed away - A Great Loss to the entire Jain Community


Agam Prabhavak, an eminent research scholar, most respected Jain monk by all sects of Jainism and by the scholars of South Asian regions, Muni Shri Jambu Vijayji passed away early this morning (November 12, 2009 - Thursday - Indian time). 
Early morning, Muni Shri Jambu Vijayji was traveling on foot along with other monks from Balotra (a town in Rajsthan) to Jesalmer and they were hit by a high speed truck.  Two munis, Jambuvijayji and Namaskarvijayji died in the accident and others are seriously injured.  Jambuvijayji was 87 years old.

A great loss not only to the entire Jain community but also to the entire South Asian Religion Research Scholars.

I do not have any further detail at this time but will keep you informed as we receive further information.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
