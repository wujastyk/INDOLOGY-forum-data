A couple of years ago I received this message from Madhav Deshpande.  
I assume it is still available.

"A freely downloadable complete set of MP3 audio files in my voice  
for my book "Samskrta-Subodhini: A Sanskrit Primer" (published by the  
Center for South Asian Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,  
Michigan) is now available at the following URL:

My students liked it very much.
