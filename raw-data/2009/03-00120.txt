Samr?? Jagann?tha translated Euclid into Sanskrit at the court of 
Jayasi?ha (1688-1743).  Ed by Kamal??a?kara Pr??a?a?kara Trived?, Bombay: 
Nir?asas?gara Press, 1901.  It was the Nasir ad-Din al-Tusi's Arabic tr. 
of Euclid that was translated, not the original Greek.

Michael Dodson has written a good article on Ballantyne's 19th century 
efforts in Benares to present European science of the time in Sanskrit 
treatises.  He and his pandits produced treatises for example on 
chemistry, the moon, and other topics.  See

Lancelot Wilkinson and his pandit Bapu Deva Sastri too worked on 
translating Arabic and European astronomical treatises into Sanskrit.  See 
Minikowski's paper in Michaels' book The Pandit 
(http://books.google.com/books?id=0TtuAAAAMAAJ&pgis=1) and other papers.

Best,
