Excellent news!  I've forwarded the information to the Indology list, and

I'll work out a way of making a link somewhere on the Indology website.



Many thanks to you and your colleagues.  I hope this book will now start

to take its rightful place as one of the best Sanskrit primers available.



Best,

Dominik
