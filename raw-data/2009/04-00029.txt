"Finally, discourse on the brain in ancient Indian texts, including medical texts, is extremely limited. It's function was certainly *not* known, and it was viewed as some sort of fatty tissue (vas?(-cha??))."

How do they deal with the fact that blows to the head can affect mental functionings, or even permanently damage them?
