Dear Ryan,

To the present day in Sanskrit Buddhism (as practiced in nepal) a  
place to be demarcated as sacred is "purified" by spreading a thin  
layer of mud mixed with cow dung over it.  It is a simple but deeply  
rooted ritual that I have never really investigated but I know it to  
be a necessary preliminary for any major ceremony. Once accomplished  
every one must remove their shoes when entering the sacred space.  In  
one case, the officiants at a puja did the entire floor of a big room  
in an upper story of a Bahal (Vihara) as the intent was to make the  
room the interior of the mandala palace in Akanishta Paradise. I am  
sure I have numerous photographs of this if you would like to see  
some. The initiation that was going to take place was to the  
Dharmdhatu Vagishvara Manjughosha.


I hope this is useful for you


John
