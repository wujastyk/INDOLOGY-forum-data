Tim,

Given the la particle, my guess is that this is the name of a Newar  
monastery from which your (unnamed) pandit came - or perhaps it was by  
committee there - so the phrase might read, `the great Sanskrit pandit  
at Manovihara'. (Sanskrit rather than Indian because lowland pandits  
came to live in Newar monasteries, some Newar pandits who studied in  
the lowlands came back,  and both might be called ?bal po? or ?rgya  
gar? and the point here is linguistic competence. Others may disagree.)

One likely candidate, given the dating of the translation and the  
rather abbreviate name, is Su Bahal in Lalitpur (Jayamanohara  
Mahavihara). The article in Buddhist monasteries of Nepal (Locke 1985:  
79ff) lists a number of early mss with colophons there. If you don't  
have the book I can scan and send you the text.

Lo Bue's useful article on Newar scholars and the transmission of  
Buddhism to Tibet unfortunately does not have much information on  
specific monasteries - I couldn't spot anything in a quick scan.
