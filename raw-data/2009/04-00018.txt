Dear friends,

It's time to play the perennially pleasant
Indological game of "can you identify the
source of this verse?" It's one that
I learned orally long ago, and, if I recall
correctly, it was attributed to one or another
Deviitantra. I am not awarding prizes for the
the successful entry, but I will be grateful
for the reference:

dharm.m janaamy aha.m, na ca me prav.rtti.h
adharma.m janaamy aha.m, na ca me niv.rtti.h

thanks in advance to all contestants,
