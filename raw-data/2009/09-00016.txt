The seed from which this book germinated was a workshop entitled 
?Between Preservation and Recreation: Tamil Traditions of Commentary in 
Pursuit of the Ca?kam Era?, held in the Pondicherry Centre of the EFEO 
in July 2006 in honour of the late and much lamented Pandit T.V. Gopal 
Iyer. A presentation of the life and work of T.V. Gopal Iyer, along with 
his bibliography, is followed by essays.

After a general introduction by Eva Wilden, Thomas Lehmann gives a 
survey of the types of commentary found in Tamil. Jean-Luc Chevillard 
addresses the interaction between scholastic Sanskrit and Tamil. G. 
Vijayavenugopal, Eva Wilden and A. Dhamodharan deal with the genre of 
grammatical and poetological commentaries. Martine Gestin explores the 
possibilities of retrieving social and anthropological information from 
a poetological commentary. T.V. Gopal Iyer (?2007), T.S. Gangadharan and 
T. Rajeswari write about literary commentaries. R. Varadadesikan 
introduces the genre of Vaishnava theological exegesis and, finally, 
Sascha Ebeling characterises the ?neo-commentaries? of the 19th century.

Keywords: Tamil literature, exegesis, philology
