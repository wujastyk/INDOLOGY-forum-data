I think one has to clarify what is meant by manas. The translation as  
"mind" is convenient, but does not convey the sense of "mind" in  
English. According to the major philosophical schools  
(Nyaya,Vaisesika,Mimamsa) the mind is as small as an atom and does not  
have a fixed location, but moves very quickly throughout the body: One  
can only feel or cognize something because the "mind" is there and is  
in contact with the soul. Although the soul is all-pervasive, its  
cognitions are limited to the place where the "mind" is located. There  
is only one place in the body, a special area in the heart called  
puriitat (mentioned also in the Brhadaranyakopanishad), which is  
exception to the rule. If the mind retreats to the puriitat, the soul  
stops cognizing (as in sleep without dreams).
