Scroll down to the second image, and you'll find Picart's version, 
including a violin and a drum; a very large scan is available.

In Lebedev's book the image was presented and discribed in details as  Durga's.  Have you any idea how to get access to the original picture?

This illustration appeared there as a wood-engraving and has been reproduced also by Partha Mitter in his "Much Maligned Monster" (Oxford: Clarendon press, 1977, fig. 28 p. 65 & see pp. 57-59 & 64). It is there evident that there is no violin in the hands of the god, but an object which looks like a bottle (which also does not make much sense). Apparently, the engraving included in the PDF document to which you refer copied the original by Baldaeus (reversing left and right and misunderstanding the god's attributes - but Baldaeus himself did not understand all of them !).
