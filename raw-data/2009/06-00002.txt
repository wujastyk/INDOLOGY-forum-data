This of course depends on what one considers 'right'. G.V. Iyer was not 
a historian but a traditionalist and a cinematographic artist, and his 
intention was not to do Western-style historical research. I know that 
it was a tremendous hit in brahminical circles in Karnataka (it was 
screened by many a 'br?hma?a sa?gha' in various towns). Iyer first had 
the dialogues written by one pandita in Bangalore, but he was not quite 
pleased with what he thought was the 'naturalness' of the quality fo the 
language, and then he requested Bannanje Govindacharya of Udupi, the 
leading M?dhva scholar, to rewrite the dialogues - which Govindacharya 
did on the condition that a similar film would be made later on Madhva 
also, to which Iyer happily agreed. Govindacharya also participated in 
writing the scripts for the Madhvacharya and Bhagavadgita films by Iyer. 
(By the way, an interview done by me with Govindacharya - of course in 
Sanskrit, but about his Sanskrit writings, not about the films - is due 
to appear in the maiden issue of the M?nchener Indologische Zeitschrift, 
which hopefully may appear in another month or two.)
