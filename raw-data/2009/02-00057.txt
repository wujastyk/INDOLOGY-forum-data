Dear List Members,

Published by the Clay Sanskrit Library (www.claysanskritlibrary.org):

Bhatti's Poem: The Death of Ravana

http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volume-v-78.html

Romanised text and facing page translation. The translation is literal enough to be a useful study aid. 

The Bha??ik?vya provides a systematic illustration of large sections of P??ini's A???dhy?y?. The s?tras illustrated in each verse are given in the notes so that it is possible to read the Bha??ik?vya in conjunction with a commentary such as the K??ik? or a derivative work such as the Siddh?ntakaumud?. In many cases Bha??i uses the exact words or phrases that are also the standard examples in the commentaries.

There are notes giving references to ala?k?ra texts for Canto 10 which illustrates the figures of speech.

Significant variants are discussed in the notes.

It also happens to be a damn good poem.
