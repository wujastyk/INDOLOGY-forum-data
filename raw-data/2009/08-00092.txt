Subject: Gap in e-text of Jayatirtha's Nyayasudha on Sansknet?
Message-ID: <161227087480.23782.11019417930455492877.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Respected members of the list,
when I recently checked the earlier GRETIL version of the Nyayasudha against
K.T. Pandurangi's multi-volume edition I became aware of a huge gap (from
vol. 2, p. 269 to vol 3, p. 38) in my copy of the e-text I had downloaded
from Sansknet sometime ago. Unfortunately, the Sansknet server seems to be
down again, so I can't check whether this problem can be remedied by another
download.
 
I have temporarily stored my copy of the Sansknet file here:
http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_
phil/vedanta/nysu1_1sansknet.htm
 
The file is unchanged, apart from a few added page marks (like *2,263*). A
search for "lacuna" will bring you straight to the gap (which is also marked
in the revised GRETIL version announced in update #353 a few minutes ago).
 
My request is:
Will someone be so kind as to check this against another copy of the Sansknet
file?
 
If this should be a genuine gap in the e-text (and not just a transmission
error), the Sansknet people should be informed about it. However, I have no
contact address. Perhaps someone can help?
 
Thanks in advance
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
