If the disagreement between epigraphists is resolved in favor of the signs  
being letters, then there is no need to consider the three characters to be 
 Prakrit and hence vayra to be a misprint for va-yi-ra. JLC got it right. 
Please  refer to Early Tamil Epigraphy, p. 369 where we have 'matiray' as a 
variant of  'matirai' in p.351.

The  spelling va-yra presupposes a Brahmi aksara yra which is  unattested
anywhere in the periods concerned and extremely unlikely  anywhere in early
Prakrit "orthography", be it a Northern or Southern one.  Stefan was most
likely right when he expected a simple misprint for  va-yi-ra.
