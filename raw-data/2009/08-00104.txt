Subject: AW: Gap in e-text of Jayatirtha's Nyayasudha on Sansknet?
Message-ID: <161227087521.23782.12597299723724177976.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Dr. Pandurangi,
thank you very much indeed for the confirmation! I tried to reload the text
this morning when Sansknet briefly came to life again, but it when down
before the job was completed. However, judging from the size of the file, it
is most probably still the defective e-text.
I have added minor missing portions in the GRETIL version, but cannot handle
a gap of this size. I'd be much obliged if you would keep me informed.
 
In spite of the shortcomings you mentioned the Sansknet material can be a
great help, I think, and it is always easier to improve something that's
already there than to start from scratch.
 
Many thanks again
Reinhold Gr?nendahl (not a professor, by the way)

Prof. Reinhold is correct. same portion is missing in our e-version which
was downloaded many years ago. please inform us if you get keyed in it,
before we do it. same will be done by us.
