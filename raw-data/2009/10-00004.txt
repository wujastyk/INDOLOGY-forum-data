Subject: AW: Unicode-compliant Garamond font ?
Message-ID: <161227087673.23782.4492209849183207327.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The key question seems to me whether the respective font covers  the Unicode
range "Latin Extended Additional" (with underdot characters etc.).
 
Look here for those that do:
 
http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/latin_extended_additional.html
 
The list contains "jGaramond" (of which I know nothing). For download and
additional information try here:

Good luck!

Betreff: Unicode-compliant Garamond font ?



Dear list members,

is there a Unicode-compliant Garamond font
available somewhere on the internet?
(or a Garamond look-alike?)

Thanks for your feedback
