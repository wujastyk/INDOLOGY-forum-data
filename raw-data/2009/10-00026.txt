Greetings,

 

Does anyone recognise some or all of these verses ? or parts of them (my translation included)? They are at the end of a section called upade?a?o?a?? in a text called Bodhas?ra. They may have been witten by the author, Narahari, but even if he did, often verses like this are based on traditional sources. Any suggestions as to where to begin looking for a possible source would be much appreciated. Since this text was written in the 18th century I am wondering if there is some Sufi/Urdu poetry influence. Kaishmir Shaivism is another possibility.

Some verses on this.

 

13. O beautiful one, you are ready for a husband. You will not remain without a husband. The husband to be chosen should be one free from aging and death.

 

14. O auspicious one, as long as you do not hear about your husband your mind will be agitated. After (hearing) you will choose your husband with great rejoicing.

 

15. O friend, now, because of my words, delight with another man (the supreme puru?a). Later establish your mind, yourself, where there is superior happiness.

 

16. O youth, the past day will not come again. You have new youth. Abandon modesty and enjoy that beautiful one. When this supreme puru?a is met then what is the use of heaven or human happiness for you? 

 

Thankyou,
