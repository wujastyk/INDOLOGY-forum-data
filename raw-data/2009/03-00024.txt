The last sentence should read "Note the present tense in the first half of
the verse and in the reading dahyati."

a.a.


The association of the remark with Janaka and Mithilaa is rather widespread.
Mithilaa is known primarily as an ideal city, not as the richest city (and
Janaka as a philosopher king). The reference to burning is hypothetical
('even if Mithilaa is ablaze, even if Mithilaa were to burn ...'). Note the
present tense in the reading dahyati.
