Yes indeed, it is Ludwik, but I typed the name looking at a paper 
where it is spelled "Ludwick" (there are a few like that, esp. 
published in India, among which a paper, in the Bhaaratiiya Vidyaa 
15/1954, where in the errata it is precisely said to correct 
"Ludwick" into "Ludwik" !).
Thanks to Reinhold Gruenendahl for the reference to the pre-1977 
bibliography - maybe I could complete it in looking at some obituary 
of the scholar.
