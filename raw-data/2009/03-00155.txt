Dear Dr. Bijlert
I regret that I was in a way responsible for the event since I had expressed my own disapproval of the debate in the forum in a personal mail to you.
It is good that?sense has prevailed

Some days ago I cautiously attempted the same warning. But instead of
understanding I was met with barking from various sides at my temerity. This
is precisely why a forum or discussionlist needs moderators.
Greetings

I find the use of the Indology list
by our colleagues in Germany to be
tiresome in the extreme and not 
to accord very well with the purposes 
for which Indology was established.

If this continues much longer, I, for
one, will withdraw my name from the subscription list.

Perhaps a separate listserve dedicated to
settling scores in Germany should be contemplated,
so that those interested in this will have
their own playpen.
