A text that should probably be included as the earliest extant 
translation into Sanskrit (as far as I am aware). is the /YavanajAtaka/ 
of Sphujidhvaja. It was written in the third century CE. It is 
purportedly a versified version of a prose translation of a Greek text 
on astrology composed in Hellenistic Egypt. According to David Pingree, 
the prose translation was carried out by Yavanezvara in the second 
century CE during the reign of the Saka ruler Rudradaman I of Ujjain.
