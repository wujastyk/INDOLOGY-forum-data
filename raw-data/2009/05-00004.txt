Dear colleagues,

Richard Mahoney and I have been pushing the SARIT project
 	http://sarit.indology.info
forward with energy.

1.
The British Association of South Asian Studies has awarded a grant to 
promote the SARIT project.  The amount we were awarded is lower than we 
requested, but is still enough to enable progress.

I would like to thank all those who provided letters of support for our 
application.  I am certain that these votes of confidence made a major 
difference.

2.
We have recently been in active discussions about possible collaboration
with institutions in India.  We have also been talking with members of the 
TEI consortium about setting up training courses in India for inputters. 
If this initiative succeeds, and there are still many hurdles, it might be 
possible for SARIT to grow rapidly.  Of course, the bigger the database of 
searchable Indic texts, the more useful it will be to all of us.

3.
Richard has now developed a software pipeline so that all texts added to
the SARIT library will not only be searchable, indexable, etc., but will
also be downloadable in toto, as HTML (as with GRETIL) or as PDF.  See the
new "Downloads" menu entry in the Navigation menu on the right side of the
main screen.


Best,
Dominik
