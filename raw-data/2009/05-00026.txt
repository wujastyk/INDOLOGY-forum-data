On the first of May Dr. Godard Schokker had passed away. Dr.Schokker had
been teaching Hindi language and literature as well as Marathi and Bengali
at the Institute Kern of Leiden University, The Netherlands. Dr. Schokker
had retired many years ago was still very active in his field of indology. I
am sure many people: colleagues and former students will miss him and fondly
remember his patient but steady way of explaining the knotty points of Hindi
grammar. One of dr. Schokker's last writings was a contribution together
with dr. M.K.Gautam on Johan Josua Ketelaar (1659-1718) and the first
summary of Hindustani grammar in Dutch for the servants of the Dutch East
India Company (the VOC).
