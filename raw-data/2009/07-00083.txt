> Dear Indologists,

> I am looking for an English translation of the Bhagavad Gita with

> English and commentary by Swami Chidbhavananda; it is no doubt out of print.

> This is for an introductory class for study abroad undergraduates. They are
> studying Hindi, so can read Devanagari, but it is rare to have a student who
> has had Sanskrit. I hope to find something with useful commentary, and a
> feeling for the poetics....

> Any suggestions would be most welcome!

> Many Thanks,
