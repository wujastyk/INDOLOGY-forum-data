Just a random thought -- though hopefully not completely off the mark
... is it possible that what you're seeing here has something to do
with unicode character normalisation, i.e., that r underdot, say, or a
macron &c. are being displayed by Vista in their `decomposed' form,
rather than as combining characters. For background on all this please
see:

 Unicode Standard Annex #15 :: Unicode Normalization Forms
 http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/

And possibly:

 Charlint - A Character Normalization Tool
 http://www.w3.org/International/charlint/


Admittedly nothing more than a stab in the dark but ...


Kind regards,

 Richard
