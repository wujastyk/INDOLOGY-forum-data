Panditji S.D. Joshi was trying to get signatures for precisely this project at the 2001 Delhi World Sanskrit Conference.  I didn't get the impression he was doing very well with the crowd there.

What about the Deccan College Dictionary?    Imagine having all the  
slips online, transcribed and digitized in searchable form with all  
the pandits' annotations included.  Last time I was in Pune the slips  
were still rotting in the scriptorium.  The publication is taking for  
ever, and the printed volumes don't include everything.  It would be  
a fantastic resource, and it would rescue the work of some brilliant  
scholars over many decades.  I heard there was some plan to scan the  
slips, not nearly as useful, but I suppose more realistic.  Does  
anyone know what the current state of the project is?
