I am sorry to say that the persons from whom I came to know of Dr.Chatterjee in 1972 and his works are all dead. I may try but this may take time.?Please go on with your own search. If I?get anything that couldour?help I will let you know.
Best of luck!

I shudder to send out the same query twice, but
as there were no takers first time around, I
thought to try again:

Does anyone have any information regarding what became
of Prof. A. K. Chatterjee, a specialist on Buddhist
Yogacara philosophy, following his retirement from
Benares Hindu University about two decades ago?
