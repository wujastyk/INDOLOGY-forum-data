Allen,

You are probably thinking of Francis Wilford's "On Egypt and other 
countries adjacent to the Cali River, or Nile of Ethiopia, from the 
ancient books of the Hindus," /Asiatic Researches /3 (1792): 295-468.

I vaguely remember that Daniel Ingalls touched on this in a brief article on Sanskrit frauds in JAOS, but am not having any success locating the citation at the moment.  Perhaps someone else will remember.
