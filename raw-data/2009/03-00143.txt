Dear colleagues,

Thanks to those of you who responded with information about the relative 
states of the cultural heritages of Europe and India. I shall be 
monitoring all other information which comes in with respect to this 
matter. It seems to me that, properly marshalled, this information can 
serve as a very powerful argument to increase funds to at least those 
parts of Indological studies which can help to mitigate the risk of loss.

Best wishes,

Brendan Gillon
