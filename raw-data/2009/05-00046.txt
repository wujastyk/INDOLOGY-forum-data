First publication of a group of thirty documents 
on leather in Imperial Aramaic, dating to the 
fourth century B.C.E. and reflecting the practice 
of the Achaemenian administration in Bactria and 
Sogdiana. Eighteen inscribed wooden sticks, for 
use as tallies, dated to the third year of King 
Darius Ill, are also included. They are 
considered to be the second most important 
discovery of its type known.
Two of the leather documents relate to the fall 
of the Persian Empire: one mentions Bessus, the 
usurper of the Persian throne, travelling to 
Warnu (Greek Aornos); the other is a long list of 
supplies in the year 7 of King Alexander. In 
addition to their valuable historical contents, 
the documents enrich our knowledge of Aramaic and 
its lexicon. The documents are given in Aramaic 
with translation, introduction, commentary and 
glossary. The volume is lavishly illustrated.

>>Dear List,
>>
>>Back in 2005 we discussed on the List the recent finds of
>>Achaemenid-era Aramaic texts from Bactria -- really critical to
>>understanding the spread of writing to Central Asia and, presumably, to
>>NW India as well.
>>
>>The manuscripts in the collection were to be edited by Joseph Naveh and
>>Shaul Shaked, and were announced in a tantalizing pr?cis by Shaked that
>>came out in 2004:
>>
Shaul Shaked, Le satrape de Bactriane et son 
gouverneur: Documents aram?ens du IVe s.
avant notre ?re provenant de Bactriane. 
Conf?rences donn?es au Coll?ge de France 14 et 21
mai 2003 (Persika, 4), Paris: De Boccard, 2004. 62 pp. ISBN 2 7018 0170 2.

>>I wrote to Shaul Shaked in early 2005 and asked when the edition would
>>come out. He wrote that it would be out that Fall, and I've tried to
>>buy it periodically ever since. This morning, however, I ran into
>>the following notice that says that it is not planned now to be
>>published until 2008:

>>Michael and I have both read Shaked's pr?cis, which includes quotations
>>from the texts that have a number of oddities in them. The texts also
>>contain direct references to Alexander the Great and Bessus, the
>>supposed murderer of Darius III, which makes one a bit curious....
>>
>>Anyway, I thought I'd give an update on the text. If anyone is in
>>contact with Shaul Shaked at present and has more up-to-date
>>information on the release of the book, please let us know!
