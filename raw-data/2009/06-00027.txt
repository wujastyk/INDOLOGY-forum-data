Dear Stephen,

copyright allowing, the one certainly doesn?t rule out the
other. While we would like to have BHSD available in the same
search interface as our other dictionaries (and our own):

   http://ebmp.org/a_gdp.php

a flat digital text file can easily be extracted from that.

Cheers,
Stefan
