Dear Friends,

We are pleased to announce the 2nd Prakrit Summer School (Aug 17-28, 2009). The
two-week introductory course in Jaina-Maharastri, held in Finland in 2007,
will make a reappearance, this time in the city of W?rzburg, Germany. The
Summer School is again going to focus on the Jain epic and narrative
material.


Further details as well as memories from the first meeting are available on
the website:

Please inform any students who may be interested in participating.



With best wishes,

Eva De Clercq (evadeclercq at gmail.com)
