Dear Allen,
As far as I know there isn't much, if any. Sarnami is slowly being replaced by the Dutch, especially in the youngest generation. Hindus from Suriname understand also Hindi, thanks to the Bollywood films for example. I think that one can buy Sarnami books on 'popular subjects' in the 'Indian shops' in The Hague or Rotterdam, but I never tried that. There was (and still is?) a news program called 'Sarnami Magazine' in Sarnami language, but the magazine (paper) of the Surinam Hindus, Lalla Rookh, is published in Dutch. 

Best regards,

Anna Slaczka.
