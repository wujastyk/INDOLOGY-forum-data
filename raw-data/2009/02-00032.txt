Dear colleagues,

Since I was much concerned in this issue, I expressed
my own opinion in the latest volume (Vol.9) of SCIAMVS
which I have been editing.
Please read my editorial at:

You can also read A Joint Response from History of
Science, Technology and Medicine Editors.

With best wishes,
Michio Yano
