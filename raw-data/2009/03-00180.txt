I own a ms book on the diseases of elephants in some form of 'Hindi' or 'Rajasthani'  in which the diseases are illustrated in the form of demons attacking the elephants.  I think I have a complete set of rough and ready digitized images around somewhere.  I saw a sheet or two of what appeared to be the same book on display in the Sanjay Sharma Museum and Research Institute, Jaipur.
