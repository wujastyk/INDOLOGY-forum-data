By chance I recently ran into a scholar who apparently worked on the  
Critical Pali Dictionary!
The scholar's name is Ole Pind (ohpind at post.cybercity.dk ). He was  
very much interested in visiting the Cornell library and had an  
exciting time being able to go near the stacks of books!

Perhaps, an email to Professor Ole Pind might help to access the  
Critical Pali Dictionary online.

Regards,
V.S.Rajam
