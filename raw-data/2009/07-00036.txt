Dear INDOLOGY colleagues,
I hope your summer is going well. I am writing to give you the good  
news that after much demand from faculty and students at Princeton, we  
have an approved position (4-year full-time term appointment) for a  
South Asia Librarian at Princeton, who will also be teaching one  
undergraduate course per year. You will note from the posting below  
that the position requires a PhD in a relevant field, but does not  
require a library background (though that would certainly be  
preferred). If you know of any up-and-coming scholars, recent  
graduates, etc. who might be interested in and appropriate for this  
position, please pass this posting along to them and encourage them to  
apply. PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD.

Many thanks and regards,
David
