One would hope that Prajnavarman in his voluminous Udanavargavivarana 
(ed. M. Balk, Bonn 1984) would relate a somewhat interesting story but
all he has to say is:

"In order to illustrate that there is a special happiness after one has
abandoned even the minutest [possession] without any remainder [the
Buddha] spoke [the verse containing the name] Mithila. The ruler of
Mithila, a royal seer, once dwelt in a state that was free from longing
caused by desire. When he saw that Mithila was consumed by a big fire he
spoke the stanza that had been uttered by the Buddha."
