Subject: resending question on chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions              and conjugations?

I haven't explored the many Indian sites that are now including  
Sanskrit instructional materials on their sites.  There may be some.   
The tapes I have of one pandit reciting paradigms are good but his  
voice is not of the best quality.  If you find a pandit with a  
melifluous voice, clear pronunciation, and who recites in the proper  
order:

i.e. nominative sg., du., pl., vocative sg. du. pl, etc. for nominals
3rd sg. du. pl., 2nd. sg. du. pl. for verbs.
It'd be a good additiona I'm sure.

Yours,
Peter
