My dear Professor Akamatsu:
Many apologies for botheriing you on an extra-professional inquiry:  I arrive at Tokyo airport early morning on Monday, Aug. 30th.  There will be some representatives of WSC at Tokyo aorport?  I should take the bullet train (oh, I can't wait) to Kyoto?

Very best regards,

T.P.Mahadevan

Dear Colleagues,

The 14th World Sanskrit Conference will be held in Kyoto, Japan in
September 1-5, 2009. The organizers would like to inform that the
detailed information concerning the registration, accommodation, and
other practical matters is available at our revised web-site:

In addition to the web-version of the 2nd circular, the site contains
the on-line system of registration and payment of registration fee. We
request all the participants to make the on-line registration for the
sake of our manageability, even if you have already sent us your
registration form. We appreciate your cooperation.

I apologize for a possible double mailing, as some of you might have
received this document in another posting.
