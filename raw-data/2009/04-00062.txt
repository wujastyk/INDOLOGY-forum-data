Dear colleagues:

I have two brief queries regarding points of Prakrit:

1. As a general rule, a word final consisting of a long vowel
with anusvara (e.g. iiM) can only be followed, in the next
word, by a syllable beginning with a single consonant. 
(A double consonant adds a mora to the preceding syllable,
which is ruled out when the syllable is of 2 morae.) This rule
should be scrupulously observed in verse, of course, but my
question concerns its treatment in prose. Are exceptions to be
considered simply as wrong? or does prose composition allow
some leeway here? (I am ignoring, by the way, and am not
interested in, the treatment of a following word initial
beginning with a vowel.) 

2. Can someone recommend a convenient guide to Prakrit
prosody, similar to the appendix on Skt prosody in
Apte's dictionary?

thanks for your recommendations,
