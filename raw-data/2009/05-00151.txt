Subject: What Devanagari text would you most like as an e-text

Looking at the responses to this post, I wonder if anyone has compiled a 
comprehensive list of available Sanskrit e-texts and the collections where 
they can be located?  I am not a "full-time" Sanskritist, and I find that 
when I do need a text, it can necessitate long hours of searching through 
the different collections and databases.
