Apologies for creating the impression that Edgerton referred exclusively to
pw, and not to PW. His abbreviation for the former ("pw") is simply more
obvious than "BR". His references to "pw" may outweigh those to "BR", but
that's beside the point.

Indeed, I should have said BR rather than MW, careless.

Why not say "pw"? After all, that's what Edgerton is about, isn't it. And,
talking about "pw", "BR" is hardly a fitting replacement because "R" wasn't
involved in that one (cf. Edgerton's list, Vol. 1,  p. XXIX).



Cheers
