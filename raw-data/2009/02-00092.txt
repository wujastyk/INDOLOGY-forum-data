Is it not possible that the language of the hymns (or at least some of them) was largely an artificial one, at least that it exploited every possibility of the language for artifice, artifice which might extend to morphology as well as imagery?  And is it not also possible that at some stage, without the use of writing, archaic vocabulary and archaic grammatical features which had fallen out of the everyday spoken language were preserved for the production of new hymns?

Victor's observations pertain to post-Paa.ninian Classical Sanskrit. But early Vedic was a living language with a Vedic dialectal base. There was no Prakrit (that has a system different from the one common to Classical Sanskrit and Vedic) around in say 1000 BCE. The fact that post-Paa.ninian records outnumber Vedic ones is no reason for forgetting the reality of the Vedic dialects. To observations like "Sanskrit is by definition an artificial language" one must add "if we do not regard Vedic as Sanskrit" But that does not stand.

I think we should also take into consideration that Sanskrit is by
definition an artificial language. The word itself means after all something
like: purified, perfected. It stood in contrast to the Prakrits, the natural
languages (of the Aryan elites?). Being an artificial language, Sanskrit
would not have the same features as a spoken contact language used in the
bazaars.

Correct, but does it also hold for the top100 of used words? I doubt so, I
personally think that the highly specialized vocabularies, or jargons,
fall in a lower category, except of course of the name and ways of address
of the deity in a purana devoted to that particular deity and so on and so
on. Anyway it would be interesting to see whether indeed the different
genres in Skt texts are so different as we generally assume, restricting
ourselves to the top100. It would be equally interesting to see whether
there is a shift in language use throughout the centuries in the
high-frequency words.
