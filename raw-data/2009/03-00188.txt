According to A. L. Mudaliyar, Bibliography of the books, papers & other contributions of Dr. V. Raghavan (Ahmedabad: New Order Book Co., 1968), p. 21-22, a work by V. Raghavan discusses some of these:

V. Raghavan, Modern Sanskrit Writings, Adyar Library Series, No. P. 31 [sic]. Adyar, Madras: The Adyar Library Book and Research Centre, 1956.  Also in Adyar Library Bulletin, 20 (1956), pp. 20-56.

Amongst other modern writings in Sanskrit discussed by Raghavan, according to Mudaliyar, are "Sanskrit versions of the Bible, translations of of English works of Western authors and Indian authors...."

I have a distinct but quite possibly false recollection that Raghavan wrote an article or pamphlet entitled "The Bible in Sanskrit," but I can't locate a copy anywhere online.  Maybe a section from the above was published separately.
