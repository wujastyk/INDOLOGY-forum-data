Madhav is right and I forgot to mention that Microsoft Word for Mac is  
not 100% unicode compliant (but many programs are).  Microsoft only  
claims to be compatible with certain keyboards (I pasted below  
Microsoft's unicode/keyboard statement).

Based on the recommendation of several people, I will be transitioning  
from Word to Mellel (http://www.redlers.com/) for this and other  
reasons, unless anyone here could suggest a reason not to or a better  
alternative.

My best,

Steven

international keyboards" --

Unicode is an encoding standard that can represent the characters of  
most written languages with a single character set.

In Office 2008, you can type, display, and print Unicode characters  
that are associated with the following keyboards:

Australian, Austrian, Belgian, Brazilian, British, Bulgarian,  
Canadian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Dvorak, Estonian, Faroese,  
Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic,  
Inuktitut, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian (FYROM),  
Northern Sami, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,  
Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss French, Swiss  
German, Turkish, U.S., Ukrainian, Unicode Hex Input, and Welsh.

You can also use the following Mac OS X input methods: Hangul,  
Kotoeri, Murasu Anjal Tamil, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional  
Chinese.
