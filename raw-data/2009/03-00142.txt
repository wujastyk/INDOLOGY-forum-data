Dear Indologists,

I am writing on behalf of a student who is doing a research project on  
the place of bangles in Indian society. She is looking at images  
(plenty, not a problem!) and she is also searching for poetic  
references (not so successful). I hope that one of you could offer up  
some possible poetic references. I can only think of the poem by  
Sarojini Naidu.

Any help would be most appreciated.

Thank you so much for your thoughts!

Mary
