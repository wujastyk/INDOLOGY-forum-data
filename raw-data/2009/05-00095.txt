Dear Birgit,

that was my impression too, but I can?t back it up with more than
MW s.v.: ?the first part (of a verse), first word Br. &c. &c.?
right now. (The first p?da of a verse being what traditionally
served to identify it, hence its lemma.)

I would rather not. What I currently do is use ?lemma quotation?
for prat?ka proper and ?quotation? for other quotations. Not
elegant, but I guess it could be whittled down to just ?lemma?
(prat?ka) and ?quotation? (not prat?ka). What we really need,
however, is a three-way distinction between (1) root-text lemma,
(2) other quotation of root text material, and (3) external
quotation from somewhere else than the root text. The extended use
of ?prat?ka? in Western scholarship is probably partly due to the
fact that it handily distinguishes (1) and (2) from (3).

Cheers,
Stefan
