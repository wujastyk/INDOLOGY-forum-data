>> Now, like all other objects, India is different ? was opened up different ? 
>> in the different worlds. While I don?t want to belabour this point (who 
>> does not admire the pioneering work of the English fathers of indology?) I 
>> certainly would not like to give up ? just as an example ? a world 
>> envisioning India as a ?Land der Sehnsucht... [ein] Wunderreich... eine 
>> verzauberte Welt... [ein] gesuchtes Land,  ein wesentliches Moment der 
>> ganzen Geschichte? (Hegel), in favour of another, where we are made to ask 
>> ourselves whether ?we shall countenance, at public expense?, preserving the 
>> culture of a land with an ?Astronomy, which would move laughter in girls at 
>> an English boarding school, History, abounding with kings thirty feet high, 
>> and reigns thirty thousand years long, and Geography, made up of seas of 
>> treacle and seas of butter? (English politician, historian and /poet/ 
>> Macaulay, only some fifteen-twenty years later). Of course, it would be 
>> unfair to the extreme to put a Macaulay up against Hegel (and a politician 
>> up against a philosopher); still, apart from the two personalities in 
>> themselves, I suspect there is as much typically Anglosaxon 
>> matter-of-factness speaking in Macaulay?s infamous ?Minute on Indian 
>> Education? as there is  typically German longing for the ineffable 
>> transfactual in Hegel?s winged eulogy of India. (By the way, Macaulay would 
>> have seconded the motion that indologists should give up writing in their 
>> respective mother tongues in favour of English, a language which in his 
>> opinion ?stands pre-eminent even among the languages of the west?, 
>> embodying a literature ?of far greater value than all the literature which 
>> three hundred years ago was extant in all the languages of the world 
>> together?).
