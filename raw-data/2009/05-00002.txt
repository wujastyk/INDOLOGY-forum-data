... sarve santu nir?maya?

I've been asked where this famous sentence comes from, historically, and I 
don't know.

The Mah?mantr?nus?ri?? (thanks to Peter Skilling and GRETIL) has it:

C.3.16. sarve satv?? sarve pr???? sarve bh?t?? ca keval?? /
sarve vai sukhina? santu sarve santu nir?may?? /
sarve bhadr??i pa?yantu m? ka?cit p?pam ?gamat //

But people usually ascribe it to one of the upani?ads, where as far as I 
can see it doesn't appear.  Is it known from other, older sources?

Thanks,
Dominik
