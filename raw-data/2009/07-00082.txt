Subject: Bhagavad Gita Translation?
Message-ID: <161227087113.23782.12492173976284433634.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,

I am looking for an English translation of the Bhagavad Gita with  
commentary. Years ago I had one with Sanskrit, then transliteration,  
then English and commentary by Swami Chidbhavananda; it is no doubt  
out of print.

This is for an introductory class for study abroad undergraduates.  
They are studying Hindi, so can read Devanagari, but it is rare to  
have a student who has had Sanskrit. I hope to find something with  
useful commentary, and a feeling for the poetics....

Any suggestions would be most welcome!

Many Thanks,
Mary
