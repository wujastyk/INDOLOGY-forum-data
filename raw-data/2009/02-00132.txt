Dear Allen,

I guess these feathers are of the sacrificed birds, certainly of more than one, and most likely from the head or neck. They must be attached there together with a piece of flesh or clots of blood. In Nepal, particularly the KTM valley, one can even find the upper part of a buffalo skull together with horns nailed on the temple-walls of the fierce goddesses or gods. The 'sacred' book of power, being one of the object of devotion, also can receive such offers, I think.

No comments on the relations of the two in Nepal, please; that's why the scare quotes.  Anyway, it had feathers on the cover, rather unattractive ones to my taste.  I find it hard to believe they are there for aesthetic reasons.  Sam Fogg in London offers a somewhat ms: < http://tinyurl.com/ap4xra >.  Does anyone know what this is for?
