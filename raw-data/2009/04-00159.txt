I can't help calling to mind the Beale treasure:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_ciphers

I had a great uncle who spent his entire life searching for this  
treasure.  He once hypnotized someone who claimed he could see the  
treasure under a tree.  He tried to dig it up (fruitlessly), and later  
learned the landowner almost shot him thinking he was a thief.   
Fortunately, people searching for the key to the IV symbols? script?  
writing? are not likely to be shot, though some of the rhetoric makes  
me wonder.  George Hart
