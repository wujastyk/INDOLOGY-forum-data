 IeB :: Lexica Search (Legacy)
 http://lexica.indica-et-buddhica.org/dict/lexica-legacy

Initially I would search for:

Term: adhimuc*

Search strategy: POSIX 1003.2 (modern) regular expressions

Database: Any 


(All of these databases are available for download.)


The various definitions and references available through the following
may also help (also available as a download for off line use):
