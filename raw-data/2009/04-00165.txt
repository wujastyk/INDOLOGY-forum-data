Subject: Professor Asko Parpola on the Indus script
Message-ID: <161227086024.23782.10973023106650974204.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I just came across this paper by Professor Asko Parpola, one of the 
leading authorities on Indus Valley Script.

This was published last year in "Airavati" and is available at 
http://www.harappa.com

In this paper, he has argued for language being represented by the Indus 
script, which is also argued by Rao et al in their paper published in 
Science last week.
