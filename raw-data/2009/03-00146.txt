Is your student's focus only on North-Indian/Hindi/Sanskritic  
material? If she would be interested in knowing about the "role" of  
bangles, armlets, and so on in the South, I can provide many  
references from Tamil (starting from old/classical literature to  
modern movies) and also discuss some religious/social significance of  
bangles. If you would like, I can send you a PDF document with the  
references in Tamil poetry (gathered through a computerized search  
program). But then your student may have to find someone locally to  
translate the material for her (or, I can help her electronically).  
Just let me know. Thanks.

Regards,
V.S. Rajam
