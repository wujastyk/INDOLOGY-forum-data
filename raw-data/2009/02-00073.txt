Dear Oliver,

the erratic spacing is caused by a communication problem between my OCR
programme and Adobe Acrobat. No fault of the OCR-programme, I have been
assured - which doesn't make it any better. When I did Whitney's Grammar
almost a year ago, I didn't have a clue how to work around this problem.

Since you drew attention to it I thought this might be the right time to
bring out a revision. It is still far from perfect, but there shouldn't be
too many spacings left. You can now download it from the same PURL:

http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl/?gr_elib-2

Or look it up in the online catalogue:

http://opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de/DB=1.20/LNG=EN/

[Unfortunately it doesn't come up on top of the chronological "All titles"
list as it should, having today's date. I'll have to sort that out to make
sure that future revisions are properly announced.]

 

Kind regards

Reinhold
