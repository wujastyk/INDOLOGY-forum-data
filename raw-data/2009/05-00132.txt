Is there also a link online to this film. I was able to download the Sankaracharya film from Google videos and watch it on the ipod.
Many thanks for these interesting discussions

Another Sanskrit film is "Bhagavatgita". I saw the film in 2002 on the occasion of an International Conference on Bhagavat gits held at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.
Both films were appeared in the national television channels before 10 or 15 years.
