Many translations from Indian and non-Indian languages into Sanskrit have
been published in Sanskrit periodicals right from the time of what is
considered to be the first periodical in Sanskrit, namely The Pandit  or
Kaa;sii-vidyaa-sudhaa-nidhi. It has become very difficult to get the issues
of several of these periodicals. Some library specializing in their
acquisition as well as in the acquisition of the notebooks of highly
regarded ;saastrins and pa.n.ditas (in original form or in copies) needs to
be created. My efforts in this regard with the Ramkrishna Dalmia Shrivani
Alankaran Nyaas Endowment (supporter of the most generous award for writing
in modern Sanskrit of which am aware) in New Delhi have so far not been
successful.
