Subject: "samsara" meaning "life"

In some modern Indian language samsar(a) can mean something like "one's personal world" or "family life."  For instance there are the novel and movie Apur sansar of Bibhutibhushana Bandhopadhyaya and Satyajit Ray, and the Maharashtra State Family Planning Bureau's magazine Sukhi sansar.  How widespread is this usage, and how far back does it go, I wonder?
