Jan Meulenbeld's monumental "A History of Indian Medical Literature" in 5 
vols (1999-2002) is the bible in this field.

The publications of Jinadasa Liyanaratne address Sri Lankan ayurveda 
specifically, and are excellent.

Meulenbeld's Annotated Bibliography of Indian Medicine (ABIM) is 
comprehensive, up-to-date, and keyword-searchable.  See:

Best,
