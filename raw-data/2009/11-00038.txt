Call for Expressions of Interest: Jill Hart Fund for Indo-Iranian 
Philology for applying to the Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship 
scheme

Please note, the following information outlines an internal 
pre-application selection process. It is not authorisation to make an 
application to the Leverhulme Trust through this Institution.

Leverhulme Scheme
The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship scheme is aimed at those at a 
relatively early stage of their academic career but with a proven record 
of research. The Humanities Division at Oxford has a track record with 
the Trust, having received four fellowships over the past two years 
(with a number also awarded to other parts of the University). 
Fellowships are normally tenable for two or three years on a full-time 
basis. The Leverhulme eligibility criteria are that applicants must 
normally be under 35, not hold or have held a permanent academic 
position in a UK university or comparable institution, and have an 
awarded doctorate or equivalent research experience. (Applications from 
those aged 35 and over will be considered if they began their academic 
studies at a later age than is usual or if they have had a career change 
or break.)

The award requires matched funding from the institution and there is 
provision for personal research expenses of up to ?6k per year, if 
requested at the time of application. The Jill Hart Leverhulme Early 
Career Fellow will be appointed jointly by the Faculty of Oriental 
Studies and the Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics, 
normally in the first three points of University Grade 7, salary range 
currently ?28,839 - ?30,594, depending on experience.

Call for Expressions of Interest
The Faculties of Oriental Studies and of Linguistics, Philology and 
Phonetics propose to use some of the income from the Jill Hart Fund to 
provide the matching funding for an application in the subject of 
Indo-Iranian Philology. They now invite expressions of interest from 
potential applicants in the relevant field who wish to be considered for 
the faculty?s support in applying to the Leverhulme scheme.

2009 and should include the following:

examiners;

Leverhulme guidance stated: ?If an applicant wishes to remain in the

reasons for this.? If you are currently at Oxford, please include 
justification of why it is appropriate for you to remain here to hold an 
ECF, in the statement);
3. a 150 word abstract summarising the research for a general audience;
4. an indication of what additional research expenses may be claimed;
5. two letters of reference;
