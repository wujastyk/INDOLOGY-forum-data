This article discusses the Indian, Persian and Harranian planetary images 
and the Indian vahanas for them.  Evidence from MSS and from statues in 
the Suryanarkoyil sun temple near Thanjavur.  Crabs are not mentioned, but 
there is a very brief mention of the scorpion.

Perhaps it's good to look for other zodiac-representations in India. There should be at least a few more.
