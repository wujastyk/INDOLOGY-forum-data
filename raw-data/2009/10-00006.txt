This is a great opportunity to study Jainism and the Jain  community in an
experiential based academic settings in India in the summer of 2010.

ISSJS was established in 2005 and so far nearly 122 scholars and students
from 9  countries and more than 20 universities of the world have attended
the last 4 ISSJSs.  In addition to class room lectures by eminent scholars
of Jainism, the other  great features of this program are the meetings and
interactions with the Jain professionals , practitioners, monks, nuns and
visits to temples, historical and architectural  places. The emphasis is on
the study and learning of  philosophy, art , history and culture of the Jains.

Another great beauty of this unique program is that nearly full cost (
except $400-500) of the program such as tuition, course material, boarding
and lodging  in India for the entire stay are paid for by ISSJS to all
participants. In addition, some full time faculty and Grad students
attending the advance program/module  also receive economy class return trip
