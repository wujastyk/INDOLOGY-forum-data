Subject: signature verses and cikacika?

A footnote to the discussion on signature verses. There are also such  
allusions in prose, for instance Aanandavardhana in Dhvanyaaloka  
(towards the very end of the commentary on the first verse--also  
identified as such by Abhinavagupta thereon: aananda iti ca  
granthakrto naama).

I came across a most peculiar sounding word in  
Pramaanavaarttikalankaara 334,7, which I can't find in the  
dictionaries: caikyacikya. I assume it is derived from cikacika, and  
it must desribe some color (or shape) (ruupa). Any idea anyone?
