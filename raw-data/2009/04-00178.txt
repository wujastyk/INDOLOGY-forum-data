Might I ask colleagues what is currently considered best practice Sanskrit
terms for what in English we refer to as 'a scientist' or 'a researcher' in
the modern academic sense? (understanding that there are many different
scientific fields, many different types of research).  Or might someone
refer me to a list of terms in this area?
