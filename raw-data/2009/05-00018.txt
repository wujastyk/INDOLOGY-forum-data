Interesting, George! Can you quote some posts from before late 1999  
(when I first posted on the List) where that is "often expressed?"  
I'm interested in seeing them.

I've pointed to Fairservis' early partial suggestions to this from  
around 1969, but then he changed his mind after the claims came out  
that the "code" had been "broken." Lots of people have said after our  
work was published that they were privately skeptical about it (e.g.,  
Frits Staal), but I didn't know of expressions (with arguments?  
without them?) on the List. Possehl's overview of the field from 1996  
doesn't contain any hints along this direction.

Anyway, credit isn't what is a stake here.

Best,
Steve
