As reported by Nepalese media, Father John K. Locke, S, passed away early this morning. He spent almost his whole life in Nepal  and will be remembered by all scholars of Nepalese history and culture by his insightful and detailed writings, inter alia the monographs "Karunamaya, the Cult of Avalokiteshvara-Matsyendranath in the Valley of Nepal" and "Buddhist Monasteries of Nepal".

Best greetings,
