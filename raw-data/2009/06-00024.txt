Dear Allen and Andrew,

yes, please do check the paper copyright files if it is not too
much trouble. After verifying the copyright situation as best we
can, and if no copyright appears to be assigned, we shall of
course still contact Yale University Press one more time as well
as Edgerton?s estate. It is very exciting that we may yet be able
to go ahead with the digitization and share our results!

Many thanks to all,
Stefan
