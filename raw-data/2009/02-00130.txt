Subject: Nepalese book with feathers on cover
Message-ID: <161227085007.23782.1578085322630699279.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Someone came round today and showed us a Nepalese thyasapu (contents stotras, yantras, mantras, medical prescriptions, and 6 or 8 color illustrations looking more 'Buddhist' in content than the apparently 'Hindu' oriented text.  No comments on the relations of the two in Nepal, please; that's why the scare quotes.  Anyway, it had feathers on the cover, rather unattractive ones to my taste.  I find it hard to believe they are there for aesthetic reasons.  Sam Fogg in London offers a somewhat ms: < http://tinyurl.com/ap4xra >.  Does anyone know what this is for?
