I had already suggested as much, some days ago but all I harvested was
criticism and a lesson to the effect that this list does not moderate. But
obviously, this is necessary. Not because the subject of
'Nazi-indology'would not be appropriate as a topic to discuss here, but
because the discussion deteriorates into mud-slinging and personal
allegations and counter-allegations.

It is sometimes easy to be carried away, but  in order to protect the large
majority of "good guys/girls" from this list and in order not to scare them
away:
Dominik's old rule of thumb "two warnings then out" (stemming from the early
times of the "wild" indology list) should be announced, should be known to
all list members and should be adhered to.
