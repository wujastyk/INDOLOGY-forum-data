Subject: typing Devanagari
Message-ID: <161227086068.23782.3234099993187520190.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Might a colleague advise me on whether there is a facile method for typing
Devanagari in MS Word 2008 for Mac? Or, failing that, in NeoOffice 2.2.5
Patch 8?  Or, in some other Mac-compatible program that would allow me to
convert the created files to MS-Word/Neo Office format?
