Dear Dr van Bijlert,

May I draw your attention to my posting of yesterday, in which I asked all 
members of this forum to refrain from discussing this topic for at least a 
week.  Possibly you did not see it.

I must insist upon this restriction, for the sake of this forum as a 
useful arena for discussion of academic matters.
