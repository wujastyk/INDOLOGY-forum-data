Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help needed to identify numeration system
Message-ID: <a8c894a4f145aece5969c8c2b5baa43e@fabularasa.dk>

Dear friends,

I am trying to figure out which numeration system is being used in the 
19th-century ?r?tattvanidhi attributed to K???ar?ja O?ayar III (r. 
1799-1868) of the Kingdom of Mysore.

Dates are read from right to left, with the rightmost numeral given as a 
bh?tasa?khy?, and the three preceding numerals as syllables. The 
syllables largely follow the Ka?apay?di system 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katapayadi_system), but the syllable for 
"7" varies more than the system seems to allow for, e.g.:

gha?achendu: gha (4) + ?a (5) + cha (7) + indu (1) [?aka 1754]

?agha?hendu: ?a (5) + gha (4) + ?ha (7) + indu (1) [?aka 1745]

gha?a?endu: gha (4) + ?a (5) + ?a (7) + indu (1) [?aka 1754]

Can anyone identify the system being used here?

Best regards,
Jacob
