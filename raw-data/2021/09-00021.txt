Dear colleagues,

With many of you, I too am sad to receive this news. I first came to know Dr. Dharmadhikari personally in the 1990s when he served as the founding Head of Faculty at the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute, of which I was the then President. I know many join me in saying that Dr. Dharmadikari was a scholarly gentleman in all respects: deeply knowledgeable, erudite, dignified, gracious, generous, and supportive of others. Although he will be deeply missed, his scholarship will long continue to inform, guide, and inspire others.

Dear Madhav and colleagues,

I am sorry to hear about TN Dharmadhikari's passing. I met him in April 1974 during a visit to Pune. He was most gracious in allowing me to film his then not yet published dissertation on the Maitrayani Samhita and of many Maitrayani mss that he had collected in Nandurbar (now being used for a new edition by a Japanese colleague). We have been in contact since then. His manifold contributions to our field will be remembered for long.

Best wishes,
Michael
