Dear list members,

I am looking for a further attestation of the strophe below, which I 
came across in a P?rvapak?a ascribed to a/some Brahmav?din/s in the 
Satya??sanapar?k?? (ed. Gokulacandra Jain 1964, p. 2).

The strophe is used to exemplify the concept that transformations 
(vivarta) of the brahman are illusions (m?y?) only. An earlier source 
for the strophe would have to be dated in or before the 10th century.

With many thanks for any reference,

Himal Trikha

"It's me [who is] the supreme, the essence of transmigration, [whose] 
shape is permanent, without ill and immortal,

upon whom the threefold world appears out of error like a snake upon a 
rope, although [I am / it is a place] without fright."
