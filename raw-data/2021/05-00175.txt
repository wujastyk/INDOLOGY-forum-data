Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with a simile
Message-ID: <4064D5BB-7AE9-4D27-8E61-3A1E875D8835@gmail.com>

???Dear Jim,

I was just looking at this verse recently when considering different definitions of ha?ha and I wonder whether perhaps the verbs are the issue rather than the simile? I?m sure you probably know more about this than I do, but it seems to me that once the ku??alin? is awakened (which I know can take some force) it should actually arise quite easily like a key unlocks a door?

Best wishes,
Zo?

I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.
