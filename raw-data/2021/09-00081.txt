 and Methods" switch to online format with reduced registration fee
Message-ID: <CAOuG4CaSH3BvBJCAp-3e8qyHqhka1BhfMNKkisv7OF4WytZ9tA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

A while ago I had the pleasure to announce on this list the international
conference ?New Light on Yoga: Insights, Perspectives, and
Methods,?(September 16?19) that is organized by the Universities of
Hamburg, Leipzig and Yoga Vidya e.V. as a hybrid event.



Due to the present COVID-situation at our conference venue, the organizers
had to make the difficult decision to move our conference online entirely.
It is regrettable that we shall miss the opportunity to meet in person and
informally discuss our research. However, our concern for health and safety
did not leave us any other choice. For the revised online program please
visit www.yoga-vidya.de/events/conference-new-light-on-yoga/program/



The registration for online participation is still open, now with a reduced
last-minute registration fee.



We are confident that in spite of all adversaries, we will have fascinating
presentations and lively and challenging discussions on the latest research
on yoga.



Corinna Lhoir and Philipp Maas
