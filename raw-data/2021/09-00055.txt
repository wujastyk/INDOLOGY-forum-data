Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit terms on title pages of books
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_UF749XyN7gPmYdztXC39Sgu0uvo7=tDHQXqoU11BbHw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

A few years ago there was a discussion of sanskrit terms that appear on
title pages of sanskrit books.  Can someone give me the dates this occured
on, so I can reference it.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
