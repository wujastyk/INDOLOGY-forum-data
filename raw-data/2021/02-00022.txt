I remember David Seyfort Ruegg and his mother dropping in at our house 
in Brussels on his way from Paris to Leiden in 1965 or so. He did not 
say that he was about to take an appointment in Leiden. He struck us, 
besides being a serious scholar, like a gentlemen of means ready to 
pitch a comfortable tent at whatever place and institution would best 
serve his research at a particular time.
