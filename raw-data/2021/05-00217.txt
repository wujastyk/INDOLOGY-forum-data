Subject: [INDOLOGY] Central Asia/Silk Roads Maps
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf91VrO4uroZ=jFzpj+MEFv3xeZ3SftYD6N5U0tNph4y6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

Maybe someone can help me. I need a few maps of Silk Roads and Eastern and
Western Central Asia Buddhist centres. Do you know any website where I can
find good quality maps or can you submit any scan of 2-3 maps of this
geographical area?

Best wishes,
Paolo
