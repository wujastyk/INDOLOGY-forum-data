>From Archiv.com I have downloaded Rajendra Nath Sen, Brahma Vaivarta Puranam, Part IV,Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol, xxxiv. which contains a translation of the Ga?e?akha??a and the K???ajanmakha??a. However, in the scan only the K???ajanmakha??a is present, the Ga?e?akha??a having been left out even though its contents are listed in the contents of the book.

If anybody could supply me with the relevant forty-six chapters or can direct me to an online version, it would be very much appreciated.

Cheers,


Greg Bailey
