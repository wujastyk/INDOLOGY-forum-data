Dear List Members,

I am writing on behalf of the organisers to advertise this symposium hosted
by the University of Rome on Thursday the 9th of December. Here attached I
forward the flyer with all the necessary information, including the link to
follow the presentations via Zoom. Each session is allotted some time for
discussion and participants are eagerly welcome. Please remind that the
time is given according to the Italian hour (GMT+1).

Kind regards,

Omar Abu Dbei
