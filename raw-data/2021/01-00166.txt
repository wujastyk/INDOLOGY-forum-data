Sorry, I obviously meant repha (typical scribal mistake, I was thinking of rekh?...)

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] names of devan?gar? penstrokes

Dear Matthew,

I believe that the short answer is that there is still no in-depth study of the terminology you mention which is based on sources that precedes the introduction of print. I am working precisely on a study of Sanskrit terminology in early print and if you want, I can tell you more off list. (Incidentally, I would consider reph? as a term rather defining the sound and only by extension used to define the written sign for ra.)

Best wishes,

Camillo
