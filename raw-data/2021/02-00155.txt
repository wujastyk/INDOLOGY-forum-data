Dear Panaiappan,

what I meant is that the group of people called p?r?pp?? could include ?c?ryas, which term beside spiritual teacher is also used for a master stonemason, goldsmith or any other artisan. So, a p?rpp?? who does not officiate at sacrifices and other rituals could be an ?c?rya in the sense of master artisan. As I wrote, it is just an idea..

Dear Herman,

I do not think it likely that ?p?rpp??? in Akam 24 referred to a stonemason or goldsmith despite the goldsmiths calling themselves later Vi?vakarma Br?hma?a. They are not presented as serving as priests in the rest of the Classical Tamil poetry. But a potter is a priest in Na?. 293. And potters serve as priests till today in Tamil Nadu

Ku?u. 156 refers to the unwritten texts learnt by a p?rpp?? who is most likely a brahmin based on other information in the poem. Akam 337 has a p?rpp?? serving as an emissary carrying a palm leaf, apparently with a message written on it. Given the brahmins? attitude towards writing, it is unlikely this p?rpp?? was a brahmin. We have Tamil writings on pottery from the earliest times. These were most likely written by potters. Moreover, as I have posted several years ago, even during medieval times, Brahmin sabh?s engaged potter scribes/accountants. The chief scribe/accountant in the Tiruv?r?r temple was a potter during the later P???iya times. The number of potter scribes/accountants is overwhelmingly larger than goldsmiths. While engraving on copper plate grants involved metal workers, even in these cases, and stonemasons were involved in stone inscriptions, there was likely a palm leaf document which needed to be signed and involved potters in many cases. In any case, we do not have any instance of stone masons or smiths serving as ambassadors.

We also have an emissary in the Peru?katai (4.4.36-84 and 4.9.47-48), the Tamil version of B?hatkath?, who is a potter. We have no instance of goldsmiths as emissaries.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
Palaniappan

Dear list members, or those interested in the details of poetic Ca?kam vocabulary,

Given the fact that the v?l??p p?r?pp??, "a p?rpp?? who does not sacrifice". in the Akan????u is an artisan cutting bangles from conchshell, it may be asked if p?rpp??, "seer, brahmin" might not be used for ?c?rya here, which beside "spiritual teacher, priest" is also used to refer to a master (stonemason, goldsmith).

Mind you, it is just a question.
