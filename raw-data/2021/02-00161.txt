Hi Bill,


Thanks for this interesting material!

I am willing to contribute ... if time permits ;-)

Could you share more (and higher-resolution) pictures?



Here is my quick reading and translation of one of these (?image3?).



(1) {pi??aiy?r c??i}

(2) cival?kam? ?

(3) p??avar?ka?? A-

(4) ?aiy??am? ?

(5) mut?tiya?? Ira?- ?

(6) ??vatu kum??a?

(7) cantirappi??ai ?

(8) ye?anta n?? ?

(9) ?



Sign/mark [of/for] one who has gone [to]/ reached the ?ival?ka.

The day when Cantirappi??ai, the son of Muttiya? the second, died (ye?anta,
i.e. i?anta) [is] ? [the date appears to be stated in lines 8-9, which I am
unable to read.]



As for references, you could check

Cotton, Julian James. List of Inscriptions on Tombs or Monuments in Madras:
Possessing

Historical or Archaeological Interest. 2 vols. Edited by B. S. Baliga.
Madras: Government

Press, 1946. [available, I think, on internet archives]



Here are some pictures of late-20th/21st-century epitaphs, dating back to
the good old days when fieldwork in India was possible. These were taken at
the entrance of an Aiyanar temple in Pudukkottai district, between K?ra??r
and Vir?limalai:

Maybe knowledgeable colleagues in this list might enlighten me on this
practice.



With very best wishes.



Manu
