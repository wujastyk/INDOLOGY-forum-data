P??ini refers to the formation *yavan?n? *which K?ty?yana interprets as a
reference to the script of the Yavanas.  Assuming that P??ini belongs to
the pre-Alexander period, where would this familiarity with the Yavana
script come from?  I read the following information in Wiki on Bactria:

"Under Persian rule, many Greeks were deported to Bactria, so that their
communities and language became common in the area. During the reign of Darius
I <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I>, the inhabitants of the Greek
city of Barca <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barca_(ancient_city)>, in
Cyrenaica <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica>, were deported to
Bactria for refusing to surrender assassins.[10]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria#cite_note-10> In addition, Xerxes
also settled the "Branchidae" in Bactria; they were the descendants of
Greek priests who had once lived near Didyma
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didyma> (western Asia Minor) and betrayed
the temple to him.[11]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria#cite_note-11> Herodotus
also records a Persian commander threatening to enslave daughters of
the revolting
Ionians <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt> and send them to
Bactria.[12] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria#cite_note-12> Persia
subsequently conscripted Greek men from these settlements in Bactria into
their military, as did Alexander later.[13]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria#cite_note-13>"

Is this something one could consider for possible connection of P??ini's
awareness of the Yavana script?  Where can I find some more detailed
references to Yavanas in the regions of Bactria and Gandhara before
Alexander.
