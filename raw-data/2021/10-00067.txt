Dear Jacob,

Fabulous, thank you! A yantra of 5 by 5 and the number written next to it - that makes perfect sense. I can try to read the engravings with better light, but I doubt that I can read all of them, ever. I can see a ?ta?, and probably ?Ta? (or ?da?), but not in a sequence. Where could I find examples of such yantras (might be too many of them?).

With thanks,
Anna.

There does not seem to be any obvious connection to games, though the Yantracint?ma?i does contain a similar yantra for achieving success in games (yantra no. 73). It is inscribed on an 8x8 grid which is navigated by a knight's tour (v?jikrama). This means that you place a chess-knight in one space, and then jump around the grid according to the knight's move until you have landed on all the squares without landing on the same square twice. If you do it correctly, the resulting series of 64 syllables go together to form two ?lokas which can be used as a mantra to ensure success in games.
