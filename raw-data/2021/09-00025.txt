Respected scholars,
Presently I am going through a book entitled "TatwaBodh,", which happens to be a unique treatise on Vedanta philosophy from the the point of views of Absolute Monism.The book is an English translation of the Sanskrit original.However, it's not clearly mentioned as to&nbsp; who wrote the original version in Sanskrit.Can the authorship of "TatwaBodh" attributed to Shankaracharya? I would be benefitted ,if anyone can enlighten me with the author's name of "TatwaBodh".Regards.Alakendu Das.
