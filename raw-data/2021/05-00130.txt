Since Rupert asked about the "wider Prakrit evidence," I can just cite the
following verse that is included in the "late canonical" Anuy?gadv?ra of
the ?v?t?mbara Jains (p. 91 of vol. 1 of Jamb?vijayaj?'s edition):

S?tram (giving a list of synonyms for suya, i.e., ?ruta, learning):
    suya-sutta-gantha-siddhanta-s?sa?? ??a-vaya?a-uvad?s?
    pa??ava?a-?gam? y? ?ga??h? pajjav?-sutt?

C?r?i? of Jinad?sa: gur?hi? a?akkh?ta? jamh? ?? bujjhati tamh? p?suttasama?
sutta? (i.e. deriving *sutta*- from *supta-*)
Vivr?ti? of Haribhadra: s?can?t s?tram.
Vr?tti of H?macandra: arth?n?? s?can?t s?tram.

The idea of taking *suttam* from the verbal root ?*s?c *is clever (via
something like *s?k-tra-*), but of course ?*s?c *is secondary from ?*s?* (via
the noun *s?-c??-*), so maybe it doesn't work.

Sanskrit of ukt?- usually corresponds to vutta- in Middle Indic (including
Ardhamagadhi), and although utta- is used too under the influence of
Sanskrit at a later period.
