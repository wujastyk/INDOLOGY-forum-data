From the point of view of symbolic logic, the two rules of inference are distinct:

Modus Tollens, defined in modern logic, is this inference form:

 not q, if p then q |-  not p


Reductio ad absurdum, on one formulation, is this rule.

Gamma, p |- q and not q, then Gamma |- not p (where Gamma is a set of premisses)

Rules can be distinct, but turn out to be equivalent.
