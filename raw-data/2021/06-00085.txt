Andrew:

One place to start in the US would be the South Asia sections of AOS and AAS, and RISA in AAR. That will not be complete or comprehensive, but will give some idea of the people working in the field.

I have no knowledge of anyone doing any field-wide surveys (such as the MLA does on a regular basis). One might make an approximation by looking at the membership counts of EASAS, BASAS, IASS, or even this email list, but that will involve a lot of over- and under-counting. One could also count papers given at recent conferences (ECSAS, Madison, WSC) but that is not the same as having a list of programs and positions. The publications of some relevant journals and book series might also be a good proxy, but I'm not very confident that I would manage to get a good sample.
