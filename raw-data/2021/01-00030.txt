Mr.David and Nancy Riegle.
The Primeval darkness which you have spoken of ,by way of referring to the Nasadiya Sukta or the Hymn of Creation(RV 10.129), I am not sure, whether it can be taken in an objective literal manner.The darkness which the hymn speaks of does not indicate "chaos"Rather, it indicates a highly articulated ,omnipresent ,unmanifested entity , beyond this veil of darkness.The hymn states-" Then there was neither Aught ,nor naught, ... neither Earth nor vault of heaven..."This seeming "nothingness" indicates "fullness" and "oneness"of&nbsp; the cosmic soul variously called "HiranyaGarbha", .On the other hand, "Tamas" is one of the three qualities of "Prakriti" i.e.the&nbsp;Primordial Matter , and is a term used in the Samkhya school of Philosophy.
Regards.

Dear Dmitry,
When you refer to the Western concept of "chaos," I wonder if you mean the Greek idea of a primordial chaos from which the cosmos emerged. If so, we would have to think of the primeval "darkness" (tamas) in Sanskrit texts such as Rigveda 10.129.
Best regards,

I would be very thankful for any suggestions and works, which have studied the concepts in Indian philosophy and religion related or similar to the Western concept of "chaos".
Best to all,
