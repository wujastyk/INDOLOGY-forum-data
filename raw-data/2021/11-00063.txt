Greetings!  The best sources on Sanskrit in the Philippines are the
writings of my teacher, Prof. Juan Francisco.  If you search on Google
Scholar "Juan Francisco Sanskrit Philippines" one can get all the titles of
his work, in addition to others.  Prof. Francisco finished his PhD at
University of Madras
