Subject: [INDOLOGY] apology for involving the list
Message-ID: <74b955c1de6d45a9b2f555c11d694f9e@hum.leidenuniv.nl>

I apologize for the fact that the message below was by accident also sent to the list. I do take this opportunity to add that I am glad that I am also a sanskritist: Sanskrit does not have speakers. This is true in the sense that one is not born a Sanskrit speaker, or a "son of Mother Sanskrit", to vary on Tamiltt?y.

Dear Jean-Luc, thank you very much for the information.
