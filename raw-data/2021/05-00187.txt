Dear colleagues,

Many thanks to all those who replied to me, on and off the list, with their valuable suggestions. Having been altogether unable to make sense of the simile I now find myself with a surfeit of possible solutions.

In particular I thank Andrea Acri for reminding me that I myself have written about ku?cik?s. Chasing up that lead led me to a half-verse in the Khecar?vidy? (2.105ab) in which udgh??ya refers to removing an argala or ?bolt?:

udgh??y?rgalam ?k??e jihv?m ?rdhva? pras?rayet |

I find a similar usage in the Ha?hasa?ketacandrik?. Because of these usages, and the suggestions from colleagues that udgh??ayet and vibhedayet might have subtly different meanings in the Vivekam?rta??a verse, I now suspect that udgh??ayet is being used in the sense of ?unlock?. And that ha?h?t, as some colleagues suggested, gives a sense of certainty or inevitability. (By the way, I should have noted that the Vivekam?rta??a does not call its yoga ha?ha, so it is unlikely that there is any connotation of a particular type of yoga in ha?h?t.)

My latest translation of the verse is: ?In the same way that by means of a key one may be sure to unlock a door, by means of Ku??alin? the yogi may [be sure to] break open the doorway to liberation ?

But I feel a long footnote coming on. To help with that, would any colleagues be able to point me towards a pdf of the book by von Hin?ber that Sven Sellmer kindly mentioned (or provide just the relevant pages)? Here are the details again:

Oskar v. Hin?ber: Sprachentwicklung und Kulturgeschichte. Ein Beitrag zur materiellen Kultur des buddhistischen Klosterwesens. Stuttgart: Steiner (Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur. Geistes- und Sozialwiss. Klasse. Jg. 1992, Nr. 6)., esp. pp. 14??24, 30??34.

All the best,

Jim

Basically, with the right ku?j?, you can "crack" an entrance exam. I realize that the door-key-opening-breaking through metaphor is continuing here, from ku??alin? yoga to the IIT qualifying test, which yields its own version of mok?a for the successful candidates. And certainly getting through such ordeals to breach the portals of these vaunted institutions -- engineering / medical / architecture / management / law colleges -- requires a certain ha?ha, determination, force, effort, discipline, rigour, zor-zabardast?!

I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.
