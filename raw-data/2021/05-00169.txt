Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with a simile
Message-ID: <A070D498-25A4-4C75-9E81-EF14B05891FA@soas.ac.uk>

Dear colleagues,

I wonder if anybody can help me understand a simile in a ha?hayoga text I?m editing, the Vivekam?rta??a. Verse 34 reads:

udgh??ayet kap??a? tu yath? ku?cikay? ha?h?t |
ku??aliny? tath? yog? mok?adv?ra? vibhedayet ||

My incomplete translation is as follows: ?The yogi should use Ku??alin? to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a ku?cik? to force open a kap??a.? I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.

All the best,

Jim
