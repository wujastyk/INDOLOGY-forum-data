Very sorry to hear of this, Patrick. I knew Sunil  reasonably well and met and spoke with him at various conferences and at the DU History Dept. . He was a resident fellow at our Townsend Center for the Humanities in 2007?08. A very  nice persona and an outstanding scholar. A very sad and significant loss.

I did not know him well, but interacted with him when I published a paper in  Indian Economic and Social History Review, and gave a talk in his department a couple of years ago. He was a very friendly person, and a fine medieval historian; did his doctoral work at Duke.
