Dear JLC,

 

I doubt if aruvi in the sense of 'shapeless one' could be used here since 'uruvu' is used in the sense of shape of letters in the Tolk?ppiyam. Tamil-Br?hm? had graphical representations of numbers (see ?va?am 15, p. 143) even though no artifact with ?mpal represented by a symbol has been found so far. It is possible before Tamil-Br?hm?, some graphic representation using graffiti symbols could have been used to indicate numbers. Given the significant bead-making industry in Ko?uma?am (now Ko?uma?al) and the port of Pantar involved in overseas trade in the king?s domain praised by the same poet in Pati??uppattu 67, I would expect graphic representation of numbers must have been well-known locally. ?Since the concept of graphic representation of numbers was present ca. 1st century CE-3rd century CE, I doubt if shapelessness could have been used to disambiguate ?mpal. ?

 

Regards,

Palaniappan

??? Dear SP,

 

??? the explanation which I have seen for what you refer to as

??? ? /aru+vi/, a compound ?

??? relies on "vi" to be the modified form of "v?" ?? (i.e. "flower)

 

??? I imagine the interpretation is

??? /aru-v? ?mpal/ = The ?mpal whose flowers are difficult to find (i.e. the 

?????mpal which does not have flowers, i.e. the big number referred to by 

????the designation ?mpal

 

??? But why is there a need to shorten v? into vi in the first place?

 

??? Another possibility is to take "aruvi" as being the item referred to by 

????one entry on page 136 of the Madras Tamil Lexicon

 

??? ????? aruvi (p. 136)

??? *?????? aruvi , n. < a-r?pin. That which is formless, shapeless; 

?????????????????. ??????? ???? ??????? (?????. 6, 53).

 

??? Then "aruvi ?mpal" means the shapeless ?mpal

??? (which is not a flower but a big number)

 

??? Does that sound plausible?

 

??? Best wishes
