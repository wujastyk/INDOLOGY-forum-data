Shinjo Ito Postdoctoral Fellowship - Buddhist Studies - Center for Buddhist Studies (JPF02828)

With the generous support of the Shinnyo-en Foundation, the Program in Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley is pleased to invite applications for a two-year full-time postdoctoral research-teaching fellowship. The term of the appointment is July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2023.

The Fellowship is intended to foster the academic careers of recent Ph.D.'s, providing time to pursue their research along with the opportunity to gain teaching experience. Fellows are expected to teach one course per year as a Lecturer under the auspices of the Group in Buddhist Studies. In addition, Fellows will give a public lecture on their research as part of the Center for Buddhist Studies Colloquium Series, and they are expected to take part in regular Center for Buddhist Studies events and workshops. We particularly welcome applicants whose research and teaching interests complement areas covered by Berkeley's Buddhist Studies faculty.
Fellows will be provided with office space, library privileges, salary of approximately $60,000 per annum, benefits, and $2,500 per annum in research/travel funds. Funding and administrative support is also available for Fellows to convene workshops and conferences in their area of research.

Applicants whose teaching and research interests are primarily in the area of Japanese Buddhism should apply to the Shinjo Ito Postdoctoral Fellowship in Japanese Buddhism, administered through the Center for Japanese
Studies at UC Berkeley, rather than to the Shinjo Ito Fellowship in Buddhist Studies.

Applicants whose teaching and research interests are primarily in the area of Chinese Buddhism should apply to the Sheng Yen Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chinese Buddhism, also administered through the Center for Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley, rather than to the Shinjo Ito Fellowship in Buddhist Studies.

Basic Qualifications (at the time of application):

? Completion of all degree requirements other than the dissertation.

Additional Qualifications (must be met by the start date of the job):

? Candidates may have no more than three years of post-PhD research experience.

? PhD or equivalent international degree by start date.

? PhD or equivalent international degree in Buddhist Studies or a closely related field.
