Yes ? like foot ? probably developed an objective length from a previous subjective measurement. Even today, I have seen workers take a rough measurement outdoors for fences etc but putting one foot after the other to arrive at X number of feet. But I think in many ??stric works ?a?gula? has a specific meaning.

Very interesting, thanks. Do you think in the 'objective'-use instances of the terms the tradition somehow developed an 'average' version of the personal measurements?

I've worked mostly on yogic-tradition related texts, where the term a?gula was used mostly for personal body measurements (length of arm, elbow to wrist, distance between cakras, etc).

There are numerous instances where a?gula is not personal but an objective measure:

See Artha??stra, 2.11.76, 80, 84; 2.19.11, 12 etc. I have assumed it to be approximately 2 cm long.
