I am aware that the "proto-Siva" interpretation of certain Indus Valley seals has been much contested during the last few decades [...]

I was long ago convinced by the compelling arguments of Doris Srinivasan that the Indus seals having nothing to do with either ?iva or yoga.

Srinivasan, Doris. ?The So-Called Proto-?Iva Seal from Mohenjo-Daro: An Iconological Assessment.? Archives of Asian Art, 29 (1975): 47?58. http://www.jstor.org/stable/20062578.

Srinivasan, Doris. ?Unhinging ?Iva from the Indus Civilization.? Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 116, no. 1 (1984): 77?89. https://doi.org/10.1017/s0035869x00166134.
Surely this issue isn't "much contested" any more, at least scholarly circles?

Further discussion in Samuel, Geoffrey. The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: Indic Religions to the Thirteenth Century. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, in Asko's work and elsewhere.

Dominik
