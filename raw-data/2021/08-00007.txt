namaskaromi friends, The K?mandak?ya N?tis?ra also picks up the A.?.
material Mark brings up and goes into detail about the construction of what
it calls the "m?gay?ra?ya." See N.S. 15.29-15.42, prior to which there is
an elaborate warning against the dangers of hunting and a pitch for
alternative ways to get the benefits of hunting, e.g. "yantralak?ya" for
improving aim, exercise for toning the body, etc. Best to all, bhavad?ya?,J

It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the
individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a
relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and
its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or
demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for
the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and
that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have
experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their
time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of
someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, *Playing and Reality*
