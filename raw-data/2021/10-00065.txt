Dear Dominik,
You wrote that the  ?r?s?kta is  post-Vedic .  I asked my question because
both Michael Witzel and Scheftelowitz say the Rg Veda Khilas (in which
?r?s?kta occurs)    are old.
Michael Witzel wrote in his article: The Development of the Vedic Canon and
its Schools:
"This collection [the RV Khilas] contains quite diverse materials,
including such
famous hymns as the ?r?s?kta, RVKh 2.6, Suparnas?kta 1.3, etc. The
bulk of the material is of Rgvedic and Mantra period age".

Scheftelowitz says the Rgvedic Khilas are from the vedic period.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
