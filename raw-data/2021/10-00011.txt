Dear Colleagues,

Jerry's death is indeed a great loss to our discipline.? His first 
degree was in Sanskrit at Oxford.? I too met him in Pune (in 1969) and 
subsequently co-operated with him on some textual aspects of the 
mounting of the Mewar R?m?ya?a on the web.? He was always a friendly and 
helpful colleague.

John
