Dear colleagues,

Please join us on Thursday, May 27, at 11am MDT (6pm UTC+1), for the launch
of the AyurYog project's interactive timeline of Sanskrit alchemical
literature.

I've attached the poster with the details for registration fyi. The event
is public and free, but we ask that you register on eventbrite at
