(* Apologies for Cross-Posting *)

Dear list,

Due to Pandemic 18th World Sanskrit Conference is postponed and now will be
held in Jan 2022. In view of this, the revised deadlines for *section 19
Computational Sanskrit and Digital Humanities* are as below

*Important Dates are:*

# *Submission of full papers closes on: 31st March 2021*
# Acceptance notification for full papers: 30th May 2021
# Camera Ready copy: 30th Sept 2021
# Proceedings for Publication: 30th Nov 2021


*FULL papers* are invited on original and unpublished research on various
aspects of Computational Linguistics and Digital Humanities related to
Sanskrit (Classical and Vedic), Prakrit, Pali, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit,
etc. Accepted papers are to be published in advance of the WSC 2022
meetings in January 2022, or soon thereafter in ACL Anthology
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/>.

Scholars interested in participating in Section 19 (Computational Sanskrit
and Digital Humanities) should submit their manuscripts by email to
*sanskrit at kaigi.com.au
<sanskrit at kaigi.com.au>* with a copy to *ambapradeep at gmail.com
<ambapradeep at gmail.com>* and *hellwig7 at gmx.de <hellwig7 at gmx.de>*  with
"*Computational
Sanskrit and Digital Humanities NEW SUBMISSION*" in the subject line.

It is possible that some of you who have already submitted your manuscript
may have advanced your work further and would like to revise your
submission. If you would like to do this please email your submission
to: *sanskrit at kaigi.com.au
<sanskrit at kaigi.com.au>*

These manuscript submissions will be reviewed by members of the Programme
Committee of the section. To prepare your manuscript for submission and to
