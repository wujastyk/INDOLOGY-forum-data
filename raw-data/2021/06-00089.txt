I'm sure many universities in the US offer an undergraduate major in
Sanskrit, if that is also what is meant by an undergrad BA. Here at
the University of Virginia we have an undergraduate major in South
Asian Languages and Literatures in which the student may choose
Sanskrit as the language. In my time here, though, we have had only a
handful of such students.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] French and Sanskrit: was Where can you do a BA in
Sanskrit??

Dear Jan,

Thank you for this informative post. One question. You wrote that
French was:"the language which was the first occidental language of
the scientific study of Sanskrit"

Could you please give me more information on this? I was recently
briefly covering the history of Sanskrit in the West and, while I was
aware that France was one of the major players, I was not aware that
it was the "first" in this sense.

I am not doubting you, since you no doubt know more about this than
me.

Could you please point me to some publications on this? Sadly, though,
French is not one of my main languages and is only at the tourist
level.

Of course, in today's climate in the US, even that is enough that some
might consider it un-American. I've heard that more than one person
said, "If English was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for me."

Best,

Dean

Dear Dominik,?
Thanks for asking this useful question.?
In addition to Isabelle's earlier contribution to this thread I would
like to add a few elements: the BA in Sanskrit at the Sorbonne
Nouvelle is pedagogically one of the best in the world -- the only
limitations I would?add are: in the occidental world, for a Western
public, because the strategy to teach Sanskrit to Indian / South Asian
students can be and should be different as most of them, even if their
main subjects are IT, engineering etc., are already so much familiar
with Sanskrit and Sanskritic vocabulary which often helps but may
frequently also put the student on a wrong or deceptive track.?
Hence during my stay at IIT-Bhubaneswar as visiting professor in 2019
(teaching, among other things, an introductory course on Sanskrit,
German and comparative linguistics specially for IIT-students with an
Indian linguistic background), I planned and organized a seminar on
"Functional and Communicative Sanskrit" on 21 December 2019 with
contributions by Godabarish Mishra, Amba Kulkarni, Siniruddha Dash and
others. My plan to help to develop this further, in 2020, to an
introductory course on Sanskrit and comparative linguistics specially
for these students could not be realized due to the Corona crisis.?
As for the BA in Sanskrit at the Sorbonne Nouvelle, another plus is
that it is in French, so that the student at the same time can develop
familiarity with the language which was the first occidental language
of the scientific study of Sanskrit, extensively used also by the
earlier generation of German Sanskrit scholars such as the brothers
von Schlegel and Franz Bopp.?
As for the Sorbonne Nouvelle, the manual used, or one of the major
manuals used, isLe Sanskrit?by Nalini Balbir (Paris, 2013) of which an
English version is in preparation. The specialty ofLe Sanskrit?is that
it presents, for the first time, the language not only in its
grammatical structure but also as a living means of expression and
communication,entirely on the basis of examples attested in Sanskrit
literature (fiction, fables, dramas) -- hence it is different both
from classical occidental introductions to Sanskrit and from modern
introductions to "spoken Sanskrit". It is a worthy contribution to the
series "Assimil" in which Le Sanskrit is published, as it follows
throughout the "assimilation" method (nip?na-r?ti) of language
learning.?
When it appeared I composed a brief verse:?
????????????????? ????????????????????? ?
???? ????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?
nip?nar?tim?rge?a?? sa?sk?t?dhy?pan?rthakam?|
cak?ra Nalin? ??stram??ato?dhyet? prasidhyati ||?
Jan Houben

N.B. Specifically topractice and read Sanskrit there is a yearly
"stage de Sanskrit" organized by Sylvain Brocquet at the Universit? de
Provence et Aix-en-Provence
(https://cpaf.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article423&lang=fr); another "stage de
Sanskrit" is expected soon at the new institute ILARA, here in
Paris.??
