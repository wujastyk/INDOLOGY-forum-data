 There is of course the old study by Paul 
Hacker (I believe it is included in his study Vivarta) that says that ?di ?a?kar?c?rya did not write 
really much (he simply died too young for that), and that everything 
besides the Bhagavadg?t?bh??ya, Upani?adbh??ya-s, Brahmas?trabh??ya and 
Upade?asahasr? (unfortunately I cannot check right now) is apocryphic. 
(This does not mean that other texts are uninteresting or unimportant.)
