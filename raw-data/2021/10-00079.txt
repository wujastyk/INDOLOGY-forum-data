Dear Harry,

thank you for your kind of reply off-list! The contents of ?gveda Khilas 
are not all the same age ? Prof. Witzel himself remarks in his footnote 
(118) to the quote you gave: ?The? hymns? are? of? various? age, and? 
many? have? various? additions,? e.g.,? the? ?r?s?kta has Br?hma?a? 
time? and? even? later,? unaccented? additions.?

I have not studied the ?r?s?kta in detail, but I'm confident that the 
age of the modified G?yatr? mantra it contains does not depend on its 
source (i.e. it's probably a later addition). In this particular case, 
it is important to bear in mind that the worship of Mah?lak?m? and Vi??u 
only developed more than a millennium after the composition of the 
?gvedic hymns. Cf. Marion Rastelli, ?Mah?lak?m?. Integrating a Goddess 
into the Ahirbudhnyasa?hit?.? /IIJ/ 58 (2015): 325?356, doi: 
10.1163/15728536-05804002.

For a critical assessment of Scheftelowitz's arguments, see Theodore N. 
Proferes, ?The Relative Chronology of the /nivid/s and /prai?a/s and the 
Standardisation of Vedic Ritual.? /IIJ/ 57 (2014): 199?221, doi: 
10.1163/15728536-05703013.

Best,

D. Haas
