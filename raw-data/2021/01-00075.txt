Subject: [INDOLOGY] contacting Shodo Yamakami, learning about Swami Yogindrananda
Message-ID: <CADbR+Y-uNge5rf4R6n3x2xADKO9fxUqLKZusH2zCECYf-eBikA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I am interested in asking Shodo YAMAKAMI about certain of his work
on Bh?sarvaj?a's Ny?yabh??a?a. I'm familiar with his personal website, but
I cannot find his contact info anywhere. If anyone happens to know him
personally, could I please request that my email address be passed on to
him with a message that I am interested in being in touch?

This concerns a certain e-text of the Ny?yabh??a?a, based on the edition by
Yogindrananda, that I have been working with for the last few years. If
anyone else ever involved in producing such an e-text is also listening,
I'd also be interested in talking with you. My hope is to get a working
version of this text in general circulation soon.

Finally, if anyone has suggestions for learning more biographical details
about Swami Yogindrananda himself, I'd appreciate that very much, too.

With thanks in advance,
Tyler Neill
