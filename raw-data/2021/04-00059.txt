Dear colleagues?
I?d like to draw your attention to three new episodes of Sensing the Sacred <https://anchor.fm/finnian-m-moore-gerety>, a podcast on South Asian Religions from the Center for Contemporary South Asia <https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/news/podcasts> at Brown University. 

Episode 2: Islam and Political Imagination in Early Modern Afghanistan with Tanvir Ahmed (Brown University)
