Dear Rosane,

Thank you for sharing this shocking information. As you rightly say Agnes was a great scholar and a model collaborator and will be dearly missed. She was probably the only person able to decipher Albrecht Weber?s and other great scholars? handwriting. I am glad that she was at least able to complete many of her ongoing projects over the last years before her illness set in.

Peter

We have lost a great scholar, a model collaborator, and a wonderful friend. Her memory and her example will live with us.
