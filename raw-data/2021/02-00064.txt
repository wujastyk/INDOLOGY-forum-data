Dear All,

     I have the 1955 booklet "The ?rauta Ritual and the V?japeya Sacrifice"
published by the Vajapeya Performance Committee, Poona.  I will have to
scan it and make it available. Give me some time.  There was a film about
this sacrifice that was distributed by the Vaidika Samshodhan Mandal, Pune,
and I had bought a video cassette copy of it many years ago. I will look
for it.  Best,
