Dear Diego,

it is true that regularly in G between vowels, OIA th and dh
develop to [z], while OIA t and d develop to [?]. Note, however,
also Brough, G?ndh?r? Dharmapada, ? 43, where he suggests that the
development th, dh > [z] proceeded via [?], and that palatal
environments (as in S?t?) may have accelerated it.

There are some few words in G proper where we have a [z] for
expected [?], such as samughasa- < (apparently) OIA samudhgh?ta-
in line 11 of the Senavarma inscription:

That is interesting.

All best,
