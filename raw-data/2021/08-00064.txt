Dear Colleagues,

In this regard, has anyone mentioned the mnemonic verses to remember the various meters, like ????? ?????????? ???? ???? ?? ? (found in the Appendix A of Apte)?
The only silly mnemonic device I can think of at the moment is that my students once called the ninth ga?a the ?n?n?? ga?a. 


With best wishes,
