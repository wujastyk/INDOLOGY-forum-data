There are a number of important reports on such institutions in the
nineteenth century, the best known being Adam's reports on Bengal
(discussed by DiBona and by Baber) and Leitner for the Panjab and Parulekar
for Bombay.  There are important reports too by Campbell, Thornton,
Parulekar, Hunter and others. Ward talks about Benares.  I found Whitehead
a good overview
