Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question about the Indian grammatical tradition's impact
 on Western philology and linguistics
Message-ID: <6b7ba4d8-0aff-d529-e05d-b125839606a4@mcgill.ca>

Dear colleagues and friends,

I have an undergraduate student interested in getting a better 
understanding on the impact of the Indian grammatical tradition on 19th 
century philology and early 20th century linguistics. I would be 
grateful to receive some suggestions of books and article he, and I for 
that matter, might read.

Best wishes,

Brendan
