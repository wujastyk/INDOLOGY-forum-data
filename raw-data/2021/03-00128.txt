Hi all,

Would anyone happen to have a PDF version of the following edition of the Brahm???apur??a?

The  Brahm???a Mah?pur??a with English Introduction, Verse-Index and Textual Correction
Editor: K. V. Sharma
Varanasi: Krishnadas Academy, 2000 (reprint)

A PDF of another edition would work as well.

Alternatively, if anyone has access to the physical book of the above edition, I?m merely looking for a couple of page references.

Many thanks in advance.

Best wishes,
Toke
