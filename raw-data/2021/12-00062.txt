Dear all,

I am hoping that someone might be able to help me with an edition of the
?pastamba Dharmas?tra with Haradatta's Ujjval? V?tti. In particular, I need
the edition cited in Olivelle 2011, p. 395 (Cultural, Historical and
Textual Studies):

?pastamba Dharmas?tra. Ed. with Haradatta?s commentary Ujjval? by
U. C. Pandeya. Kashi Sanskrit Series, 93. Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit
Series Office, 1969.

I've been able to consult three other editions:

the Kumbakonam edition of 1895 ed. by Halasyanatha Sastry

the Mysore edition of 1898 ed. by Mah?deva ??stri and K. Rang?ch?rya

the Kashi edition of 1932 ed. by Ramanatha ?astri

But none of them give a reading quoted on p. 304 of Olivelle's publication,
namely, ad ?p 2.7.7: pr?ye?occhabda? ?i??? na pa?hanti. In the editions at
my disposal the word ?i??? is omitted.

Thanks and happy holidays!

All the Best,
Victor
