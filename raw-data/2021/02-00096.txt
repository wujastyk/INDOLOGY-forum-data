Dear colleagues?

Some years ago a colleague shared a digital copy of this vanishingly hard-to-find film with me. You can download this large file (over 2GB!) from here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D61bcVxk_I0KNDG7LXYLEL2eHC_WWHz0/view?usp=sharing> for the next week.

In addition, I?ve compiled a list of Multimedia Resources (Films and Videos, Audio Recordings, Archives) relating to modern Vedic traditions in my 2017 annotated bibliography on this topic for Oxford Bibliographies Online <https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/> > Hinduism > ?Vedic Oral Tradition.? This document, complete with hyperlinks, is visible only behind library paywalls. Another caveat: the bibliography is a work-in-progress and is overdue for an update. If you notice significant omissions, please let me know and I will do my best to address them.

Beyond that, alongside the efforts of Jan, Borayin, and others, my own multimedia projects relating to Vedic pedagogy and ritual performance in South India can be readily viewed online <https://vimeo.com/user10256084>. 

Yours,
Finnian

(Perhaps he has the typescript in his possession.)Also, the entry for Van Buitenen's papers, held at the UC library, suggests that there are at least field notes to the film in their collection (but perhaps not the actual typescript that accompanied the film).
