Dear list members,
This link was given to me for online sanskrit OCR.
https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/

I don't recall if this has already been passed on to the list, but 've just
tried it, pasting in some text from a Chaukhamba publication from the
1980's and it converted it to text perfectly.  It was even smart enough to
join words separated by a dash at the end of lines.

I didn't see any credits on the website. Does anyone know who is
responsible for this website?
