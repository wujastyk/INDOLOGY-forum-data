Dear All

Ashoka University is seeking to appoint a Sanskritist, at either the
Assistant Professor or Associate Professor level.  The application deadline
is two months from now: March 15th.

Application details are given here:
https://facultypositions.ashoka.edu.in/JD/Sanskrit_JD_20-21.pdf

Note that this is a different position from the one in Indian Philosophy
that I posted about recently.

Yours Alex
