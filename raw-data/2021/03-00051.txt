Dear Ryan,

I agree that things on the ground were probably never as clear-cut as our modern doxographies typically presume. Just a few days ago I was reminded of the following passage from Yijing?s Buddhist Monastic Traditions of Southern Asia (sometimes known in secondary lit. romanization as I-Tsing, because of how Takakusu?s 1896 translation of rendered Yijing?s name). What he describes, which would reflect the situation in the second half of the 7th century, probably remained the case for awhile, especially the ?mixing? of the two y?nas. Here is Li Rongxi?s tr. of the passage.

Among the four schools there is no definite classification as to which ones should be put under Mahayana and which ones under Hinayana. In the regions of North India and the South Seas, what is prevalent is purely Hinayana, while in the Divine Land of China, the monks keep the great teaching in their minds. At other places both the Mahayana and the Hinayana are practiced in a mixed way. Through an examination of their practices, we see no differences in their disciplinary rules and restrictions. Both of them classify the Vinaya rules into five sections and practice the four noble truths. Those who worship bodhisattvas and read Mahayana scriptures are named Mahayanists, and those who do not do so are called Hinayanists. What is known as Mahayana consists of only two sub-schools, first, the Madhyamika and second, the Yogacara. (p. 14)

In a conversation reported in ??kya mchog ldan?s rnam thar, Vanaratna tells the adolescent ??kya mchog ldan that he was ordained as a Sarv?stiv?din, and gZhon nu dpal identifies this as the vinaya lineage he received at the Mah?caitya Vih?ra in Sadnagara. Given the time period I think we can safely assume this means the M?lasarv?stiv?din. That said, there are traces of P?li and Therava?sa influences in Vanaratna?s early narrative (heavily obscured by the Tibetan biographers, if not Vanaratna himself), so I suspect the situation was much more complex than the rnam thars let on.

It does seem that a Mahay?na-Vajray?na education was still available in the region at the turn of the fifteenth century, but the quality and extent of it is uncertain.
