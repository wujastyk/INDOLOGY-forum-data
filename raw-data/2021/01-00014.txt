 Thanks! I would greatly appreciate the photos of just the English pages. If I need to go deeper, I can try to find the originals.
Yes, my first name is Dean and my middle name is Michael. Actually, you just solved a mystery for me: why I am occasionally called Michael. People must assume it's the academic title. Dean is a not uncommon name in the US ... regardless of educational qualifications. In fact, sometimes I wonder if there's not generally an inverse correlation. :-)

Best,
Dean

 Dear Michael (or is Dean also your name ?),

I have at my disposal a discussion of the 11th chapter in an edition of 
the BSS by "A Board of Editors headed by ACHARYAVARA RAM SWARUP SHARMA, 
Chief Editor and Director of the Indian Institute of Astronomical and 
Sanskrit Research" in 1966. The edition is accompanied by the Vasana, 
Vijnana and Hindi Commentaries. Are you interested by a scan, or rather 
photos because the (bulky) book is uneasy to scan. I also have the 
edition (without translation nor discussion) by M.S.Dvivedin, Banaras, 
1902.

Best regards,

J.M.Delire,
Lecturer on Science and Civilization of India - Sanskrit Texts, IHEB 
(University of Brussels, Belgium)
