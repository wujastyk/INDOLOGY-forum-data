Dear Matthew,

the news about the discovery of the skeletons seem to date back at least to September 2009 (http://varnam.org/2009/09/a-4000-year-old-lepers-tale/). It sounds strange that it didn?t reach the academia since.

Best,

Marco

If you know of pertinent references to reliable sources that will help to shed light on this, I would be most grateful.
