Dear Friends,

Might anyone have a copy of or access to this pdf? I've looked, but seem
unable to find it in full.

Shakespear, J. 1820. "Observations Regarding Badheks and T'hegs J
Shakespeare." Asiatick Researches, Vol. 13.

It is mentioned in the (footnote) of the
following article: Stevenson, J.A.R. "Some Account of the P'hansig?rs, or
Gang-robbers, and of the Sh?dgarshids, or Tribe of Jugglers." The Journal
of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/42755200?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents>
Vol. 1, No. 2 (1834), pp. 280-284.
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/42755200?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents>


I'm wondering if this mention of the Vij??ne?v?ra??stra and "G?r?di (juggler
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garodi>)" can be taken to mean Mit?k?ar?'s
Vij??ne?vara
<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/corpustei/transformations/html/sa_vijJAnezvara-mitAkSarA.htm#d1e12831>.
Or is there are another similarly named text? I don't notice the term in
this file on GRETIL.

I wonder how it comes to mean juggler if in the Tulu/Kannada dictionary
gives garo?i the meaning of gymnasium (????? garoo?i / ????  (gara?i).
