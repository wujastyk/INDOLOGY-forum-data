*Defending God in Sixteenth-Century India: The ?aiva Oeuvre of Appaya
D?k?ita*

This book is the first in-depth study of the ?aiva oeuvre of the celebrated
polymath Appaya D?k?ita (1520-1593). Jonathan Duquette documents the rise
to prominence and scholarly reception of ?iv?dvaita Ved?nta, a
Sanskrit-language school of philosophical theology which Appaya
single-handedly established, thus securing his reputation as a legendary
advocate of ?aiva religion in early modern India. Based to a large extent
on hitherto unstudied primary sources in Sanskrit, Duquette offers new
insights on Appaya's early polemical works and main source of ?iv?dvaita
exegesis, ?r?ka??ha's *Brahmam?m?ms?bh??ya*; identifies Appaya's key
intellectual influences and opponents in his reconstruction of ?r?ka??ha's
theology; and highlights some of the key arguments and strategies he used
to make his ambitious project a success. Centred on his magnum opus of
?iv?dvaita Ved?nta, the *?iv?rkamanid?pik?*, this book demonstrates that
Appaya's ?aiva oeuvre was mainly directed against Vi?i?t?dvaita Ved?nta,
the dominant Vai??ava school of philosophical theology in his time and
place. A far-reaching study of the challenges of Indian theism, this book
opens up new possibilities for our understanding of religious debates and
polemics in early modern India as seen through the lenses of one of its
most important intellectuals.
