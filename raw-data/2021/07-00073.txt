POSITION DESCRIPTION
The Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley seeks to appoint an Assistant Professor in Sanskrit Studies,
tenure track.
Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are core values of the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies. We believe that our excellence can only be
fully realized by faculty, students, and staff who share fully our commitment to these values. The Department seeks a highly qualified scholar of Sanskrit
Studies. The Department will consider applications from Sanskrit scholars working in any humanistic discipline or period, but it is especially interested in
expanding its research and teaching activities in non-Buddhist areas including poetics, epic studies, philosophy, ritual, architecture, grammar, or traditional law
and history. Knowledge of Prakrits such as Middle Indic, Apabhra??a, etc., or Dravidian or early modern Indian languages will be a further plus. Advanced
training and competence broadly in South Asian Studies encompassing specialization in literature and religion as well as cultural and intellectual history is a
further desideratum.
Duties will include developing and teaching graduate and undergraduate courses, supervising graduate students, coordination of the Sanskrit language
programs, supervision of graduate degree candidates, and participation in the administrative activities of the department and the University. For more
information about the Department, go to: http://sseas.berkeley.edu
The department is committed to addressing the family needs of faculty, including dual career couples and single parents. We are also interested in candidates
who have had non-traditional career paths or who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved excellence in careers outside academia.
