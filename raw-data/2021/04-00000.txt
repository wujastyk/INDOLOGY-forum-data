							iWe couldn't verify the sender of this email.Dear All:



I wonder whether any of you have come across the expression: pariparamaguru? I find this in a text I am editing, although this sentence cited by T. Ganapati Sastri omits the initial pari. It could be he just felt it was a mistake, but I want to be sure that it not another way of referring to the par?tparaguru. Thanks.



Patrick
