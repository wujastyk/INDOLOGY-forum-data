Dear Jim,

Please disregard if you find this silly, but my thinking went in a different direction. Ku?cik? = a key, but it evokes a sense of similar terms, such as ku?cana, ?curving, bending, contracting; contraction (of a vein)? (MW), and ku?cita ?crooked, curved, bent, contracted; curled (MW), i.e., an image of a coiled snake; keys do force locks to unlock by exerting pressure on tumblers, etc., so just as a key ?snakes? its way to open a door, Ku??alin? breaks through the doorway to liberation for a Yogi. The violence of the snake is implicit in the imagery.

best wishes,
Dan

Maybe my imagination is too influenced by images of huge Tibetan locks and keys that served also as lethal weapons. Might not some old Indian locks be preserved in one or another of the palace museums?

>> I wonder if anybody can help me understand a simile in a ha?hayoga text I?m editing, the Vivekam?rta??a. Verse 34 reads:
>> 
>> udgh??ayet kap??a? tu yath? ku?cikay? ha?h?t |
>> ku??aliny? tath? yog? mok?adv?ra? vibhedayet ||
>> 
>> My incomplete translation is as follows: ?The yogi should use Ku??alin? to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a ku?cik? to force open a kap??a.? I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.
