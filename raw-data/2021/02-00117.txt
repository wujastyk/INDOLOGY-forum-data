Dear colleagues,

Allow me to be in the discussion. I find it quite legitimate that the EPHE, as a French ? Grand Etablissement ?, on the model of the ?  Coll?ge de France ?, considers as a prerequisite a ? good active mastery of French language ?. University is not meant for the comfort of the Professors but that of the students. In France, a French speaking country, if I have to recall what is sheer obviousness, classes are delivered in French.

On the basis of their outstanding skills and talents, the EPHE gladly welcomes scholars who are not native French speakers, but a minimal mastery of French is expected, which is meant to serve also the comfort of the teachers themselves. Matthew Kapstein and Jan Houben, both Directeurs d??tudes in the EPHE,  would certainly agree with my assertion, as well as the many Italian researchers working in different French academic institutions, including the EPHE.

And shall I remind you that some countries, if they do not officially require a good mastery of their own language (which is not very difficult for many of them, since both the applicant and the members of the election committee are English speakers), do apply the rule of ? National Preference ? (as is the case in Canada, for instance), which is not at all in use in French Universities, which consistently  privilege scientific excellence, whatever the nationality?

Best wishes,

Lyne Bansat-Boudon

Dear All,
The professor-researcher recruitment campaign 2021 at the ?cole Pratique des Hautes ?tudes (EPHE) is open.
This time, none of the open positions are directly "indological" but some of the positions in Sciences historiques et philologiques or Sciences religieuses *could* in theory accommodate indological (indological-linguistic) or buddhological applications.
Please explore at

A good active mastery of French is of course a prerequisite.


"of course"?  No, this is not obvious or normal.  Many countries hire professors on the understanding that if they don't know the indigenous language they will commit to learning it within the first two years of tenure.  As far as I am aware, that is normal international practice.

Best,
Dominik
