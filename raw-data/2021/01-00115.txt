Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about the publication details of an article
Message-ID: <32a30f0f2d8a4ba1b220ab0f369f41e0@hum.leidenuniv.nl>

Dear List members,

I am looking for an article of which I have forgotten the details. If I remember well it has appeared in BSOAS and was written by Henning or a person with a name like that. It deals with the horror vacui (maybe the words are in the title), or how missing information in inscriptions is filled in by historians. I am not so much looking for a pdf ? I do have access to the electronic version of BSOAS ? but would like to know where I can find it.

Herman
