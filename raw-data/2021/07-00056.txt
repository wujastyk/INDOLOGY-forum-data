?gvedic dh?mahi was already recognised by the authors of PW (s.v. ?dh?) as
belonging to ?dh?, rejecting the error of native interpreters, who
attributed the verbal form to ?dhy?, an historical inaccuracy with a shift
of meaning that European scholars on occasion have also supported,
intentionally or unintentionally (e.g., ?we concentrate? [Michaels,
Hinduismus, 108f]).
On this mode of the optative formed from the stem of the root aorist:
dh-?-mahi from ?dh?, cf. Oldenberg (?Noten?, 261); Renou (?tudes XVI, 103);
Witzel, Got? et al. (Rigveda in German Transl., Komm. p. 460, with further
literature); ?might we make our own? (Brereton/Jamison, vol. I, 554).
Already before Oldenberg, it was correctly understood and accordingly
translated by Ludwig (?wollen wir uns schaffen? / ?we would procure us?);
Gra?mann (?Da? wir (...) erlangten doch?). However, the past tense
(?empfingen wir?) is used by Geldner.
