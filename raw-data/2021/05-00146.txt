Dear Professor Schlingloff,
Thanks for reminding us of this important textual research, which has
significant implications for our lexical understanding of the term sutta.
Your conclusion would be in harmony with the indications found in P??ini?s
A???dhy?y?,
AA 4.3.110 p?r??arya-?il?libhy?? bhik?us?trayo? and 110 karmanda-kr???v?d
ini?
according to which two groups of ascetics (mendicants) receive a name
according to the Brahminical ascetic school to which they belong.
In the Sanskritic-Prakritic, widely understandable diglossic vocabulary of
the time, still preceding the origination of classical Sanskrit with
several centuries,
the term s?tra/sutta was apparently used with regard to (sometimes
currently lost) texts for teaching, which were within their school a
Leitfaden, thread or guide
in relation to some larger body of discussions or texts, such as, also, the
Br?hma?as and ?ra?yakas in case of the ?rautas?tras.
This can never exclude (the development of) other contemporaneous
interpretations and understandings of the term sutta : yog?d r??hir
bal?yas?...
With best regards,
Jan Houben
