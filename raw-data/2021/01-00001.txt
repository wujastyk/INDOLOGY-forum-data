Dear list members,

a friend of mine (not a member of indology-list) is working on the  
sociology and economics of gold in India. She is interested in the  
ritual and economic significance of gold, in particular temple gold.  
Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thank you and all the best for 2021!

Yours
