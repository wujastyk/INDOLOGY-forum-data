Dear colleagues,
I am urgently seeking the text of a verse in the 2nd chapter (Ratna) of
K???a's Ratnam?l?. The first 8 chapters (of 108) are translated by Forbes,
JBBRAS IX, pp.20-?100. According to A.K. Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat,
p. 418, this is an unpublished Prakrit text by an author of whom nothing is
known other than his name. According to Majumdar,  K???a's chronicle ends
with Bh?ma II. I would be most grateful for any help in finding this text.
Best wishes,
David
