But, interestingly, conditioned by my teacher some years ago, Frances Wilson, I always go first to Apte?s dictionary. Frances disdained Monier-Williams because it gave the words in transliteration and not in Devan?gar?! Apte in this case was unhelpful. I usually, anyway, always look at Monier-Williams aside Apte for things, as both dictionaries contain items the other doesn?t. But, obviously, I didn?t do my back-up work in this case.
