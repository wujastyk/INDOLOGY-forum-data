Would it be possible for someone senior at Berkeley to communicate to the
managers of the SA library at Berkeley the experience of scholars at Leiden
and Utrecht and Oxford and what was lost by the changes?  This would
include (at least) information on the social factors about meeting-spaces,
about the importance of serendipity as a form of knowledge-discovery and
about the identity-formation of a research field.

The Ithaka foundation <https://www.ithaka.org/> - the people behind JSTOR -
regularly produce influential reports to the academic library world.
Perhaps they would be willing to look into this issue in a serious way?
Perhaps they have already thought about this issue?

I happened to be a fellow at the IIAS in Leiden during the last year of the
Kern Library's existence.  It was a wonder.  The most fabulous place to do
research.

At my university, we've never had a distinct SA collection.  But all the
main stacks are open access, which really helps discovery, and they have
tables and chairs in them to encourage working near the collections.  It's
not the same as the Kern etc., but it helps a bit.


Best,
Dominik
