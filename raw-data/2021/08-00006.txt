Dear Heiner,

As much can be implied in the Artha??stra at 2.2.3, which provides rules for establishing the king?s m?gavana. It is to be provisioned, among other things, with bhagnanakhada???ravy?la: various kinds of vicious animals with their claws and fangs broken or removed. Here is the passage from the Ky?to e-text:

t?vanm?tram ekadv?ra? kh?tagupta? sv?duphalagulmaguccham aka??akidrumam utt?natoy??aya? d?ntam?gacatu?pada? bhagnanakhada???ravy?la? m?rgayukahastihastin?kalabha? m?gavana? vih?r?rtha? r?j?a? k?rayet | sarv?tithim?ga? pratyante c?nyanm?gavana? bh?miva?ena v? nive?ayet |

Best,
Mark

Dear listmembers,

I am searching for quotations (preferably in Sanskrit/Pali sources) which clearly describe that for a royal hunting trip the animal to be hunted has been caught beforehand and later released for this royal hunt.

This would be helpful for the interpretation of a picture strip which visualizes the ?lavaka-damana-story according to thr Buddhist commentary literature.

Has any of you stumbled upon such a passage by chance?


Many thanks

Heiner
