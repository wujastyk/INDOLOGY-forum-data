Dear All,

I am looking for a PDF of the following dissertation written in Sanskrit
about the *Harin?m?m?tavy?kara?a *and the *Mugdhabodhavy?kara?a*:

??????????-??????????, ??????-??????????? ??? ????????-, ???????????
????????. (??). ? ????????, ??? ????? *** ?????? (??.??????.??.){????? ?????
}, 1992, ??. ??????.

I found the mention of this dissertation at the following link: ???
(sanskrit.nic.in)
<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/Thesis_Modified/Thesis-E-H/H_f/myweb10/ha.htm>.
Unfortunately, I was not able to find it on the ProQuest website. I would
very much appreciate it if you could share the dissertation if you have
access to it or advise me where I can find it.

Gratefully,

Radhika
