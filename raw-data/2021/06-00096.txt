Yes, the two chairs, for Sanskrit and Chinese, were created at the same time.
Best wishes,

>> Dear colleagues,
>>
>> It strikes me that I ought to have given some reason for my abrupt
>> warning against the English translation of Raymond Schwab'sOriental
>> Renaissance. Let me quote the introductory paragraph of the review I
>> gave it back in 1988:
>>
>> "Scholars interested in the East-West intellectual encounter will
>> welcome the publication of an English translation of Raymond
>> Schwab's "La Renaissance Orientale", a book that, though 34 years
>> old, has not been replaced. A look at the contents of this handsome
>> volume reveals useful added features, such as an alphabetical and
>> updated bibliography and a fuller and more readable index. A
>> thorough perusal of the English translation, however, turns elation
>> into disappointment. Not only was Schwab's difficult, poetic French
>> occasionally beyond the powers of the translators, their lack of
>> familiarity with Indian culture and Anglo-Indian history not
>> infrequently led them astray."?
>>
>> Examples are given in the core of the review. The full text can be
>> found in Orientalistische Literaturzeitung 86.4, 1988, coll.
>> 471?473.?
