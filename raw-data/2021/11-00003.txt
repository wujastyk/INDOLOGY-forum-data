Dear colleagues,

I'm looking for an electronic text of the Mahabodhiva?sa (ed. S.A.  
Strong, PTS 1891). As far as I can see, it is not included in any of  
the collections of electronic Pali texts known to me. Even partial  
inputs of the text will be much appreciated.

With many thanks in advance
Martin Straube
