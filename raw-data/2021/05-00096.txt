Zitat von "Lubin, Tim" <LubinT at wlu.edu>:

> Oskar von Hin?ber (1994: ?Die Neun A?gas,? p. 132) approvingly cites  
> Mayrhofer?s judgment (EWA III/ 492) that the derivation from s?kta  
> is ?entbehrlich?; he cites a long discussion of the term in  
> Buddhaghosa?s Atthas?lin? 19.15?26 as evidence against it.
