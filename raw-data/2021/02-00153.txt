Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tamil tombstones inscriptions
Message-ID: <B1048D34-7FF3-4685-AF94-A9190F852213@gmail.com>

Dear friends,
I am helping the local Hindu Association to catalogue some 19th century tombstones here in Hong Kong. I wonder if someone could help me to transcribe the Tamil inscription and to direct me to some resources on the practice of tombstone inscription in Tamil. I include some photos here. Please contact me either on or off list.
Many thanks,
Bill Mak
