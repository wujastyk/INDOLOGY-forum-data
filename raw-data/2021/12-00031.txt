*Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions 2022 (online)*


Call for Papers ? Proposal deadline: 24 January 2022


*Theme ? Consciousness, Death and Immortality*


We invite proposals for papers for the 47th Spalding Symposium on Indian
Religions, which will be held *online*, on 22-24 April 2022. Our purview
includes both religions of South Asian origin wherever in the world they
are being practised, and those of non South Asian origin present within
South Asia. We welcome papers based upon all research methods, including
textual, historical, ethnographic, sociological and philosophical. Papers
that address the theme of the conference are particularly welcome, although
other proposal topics may be considered.


Presenters are allocated forty minutes for their paper and twenty
minutes for discussion. There is no conference fee, but all presenters and
attendees must register. We also welcome proposals from advanced doctoral
candidates, who will be allocated twenty minutes for their paper and ten
minutes for discussion.


If you would like to give a presentation, please send a title and abstract
(maximum 500 words) to the Spalding Symposium committee:
spaldingsymposium1 at gmail.com, by 24 January 2022


Due to the typical volume of submissions, individual feedback on proposals
cannot be provided. Successful proposals will be announced in early
February.
