Do?amite sukhadukkhe pariyantakate sa?s?re, natthi h?yanava??hane, natthi ukka?s?vaka?se. Seyyath?pi n?ma suttagu?e khitte nibbe?hiyam?nameva paleti;  evameva b?le ca pa??ite ca sandh?vitv? sa?saritv? dukkhassanta? karissant??ti. 
Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there?s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. It?s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.?

On one occasion when the monks from the group of six were making robes, they asked for a large amount of thread. 
Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiy? bhikkh? c?varak?rasamaye bahu? sutta? vi???pesu?. 

Yet even when their robes had been sewn, there was much thread left over. 
Katepi c?vare bahu? sutta? avasi??ha? hoti. 

They said, 
Atha kho chabbaggiy?na? bhikkh?na? etadahosi? 

?Well, let?s ask for more thread and have weavers weave us robe-cloth.?
?handa maya?, ?vuso, a??ampi sutta? vi???petv? tantav?yehi c?vara? v?y?pem??ti. Atha kho chabbaggiy? bhikkh? a??ampi sutta? vi???petv? tantav?yehi c?vara? v?y?pesu?. 

Yet even when the robe-cloth had been woven, there was much thread left over. 
V?tepi c?vare bahu? sutta? avasi??ha? hoti. 

A second time they asked for more thread and had weavers weave them robe-cloth. 
Dutiyampi kho chabbaggiy? bhikkh? a??ampi sutta? vi???petv? tantav?yehi c?vara? v?y?pesu?. 

Once again there was much thread left over. 
V?tepi c?vare bahu? sutta? avasi??ha? hoti. 

A third time they asked for more thread and had weavers weave them robe-cloth. 
Tatiyampi kho chabbaggiy? bhikkh? a??ampi sutta? vi???petv? tantav?yehi c?vara? v?y?pesu?.

Sutta by another etymology (cf. supati) means ?sleep,? as in

?How many sleep while others wake? 
?Kati j?garata? sutt?, 

How many wake among the sleeping? 
kati suttesu j?gar?;
