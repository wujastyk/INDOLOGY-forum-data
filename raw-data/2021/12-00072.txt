Sorry for once again spilling over the South Asian borders but I can't seem to find a reliable reference for this claim:
"Zoroaster is said to have had a miraculous birth: his mother, Dughdova, was a virgin who conceived him after being visited by a shaft of light.
Perhaps some of our Indo-Iranians might know.

Best,
Dean
