Dear List members,


The only copy I have of my own article "The Artha??stra as a Fount of Fun", Journal of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. Sanskrit Vimarsha Vol. 6. Sanskrit Conference Special, pp. 113-120, is the link on my website. When I wanted to have a look at the article, I discovered that of Vol. 6 only the title page is available. When I checked with the webpage of the organisation, only later issues are available. Does anyone know what has happened with the earlier issues, or how or where I can excess my own article?.


With kind regards, Herman
