Hi everyone,

I am reminded by Professor Paul Dundas of a few other points that might be
relevant to this discussion:

   - Paul Dundas (?Somnolent S?tras: Scriptural Commentary in ?vet?mbara
   Jainism," *Journal of Indian Philosophy* 24: 73?101, 1996) says the
   following (p. 78: see the notes for the sources):
      - The Jain position with regard to scripture and commentary upon
      it, of whatever type or period, is strongly predicated upon the
      acceptance of meaning as being superior to word.  This can be
seen clearly
      from the standard Jain etymology for the term ?s?tra? which
would derive it
      from the root s?c, ?indicate.? A s?tra ?indicates? many meanings
which the
      teacher explicates through commentary, obtaining the sense from the root
      text in the same manner as a potter creates shapes from a lump of clay.
      - Mari Jvy?rsj?rvi (?Retrieving the Hidden Meaning: Jain Commentarial
   Techniques and the Art of Memory,? *Journal of Indian Philosophy *38.2:
   133?162, 2010), cites Sa?ghad?sa?s commentary on the *Br?hatkalpa *(p.
   138):
      - Sutra [becomes sutta] just like supta; or s?tra has a double
      meaning [ 's?tra is a thread']. Or it becomes sutta because it indicates
      [s?cana] the meaning, or is well-spoken [s?kta]. These are its
etymologies:
      it 'indicates' or it 'sews,' or also 'it is produced,' or 'it follows.'
      These are the divisions [of etymology], and these are its names. S?tra is
      like a person who is slumbering: unless it is "awakened" by meaning,
      it cannot be known. Or due to the similarity in [words that have]
      double meanings, many meanings are joined together. A needle, even when
      broken, can be traced by the thread as long as it is threaded. Likewise
      meaning [is pointed out] by the s?tra. It 'sews together' words and
      meanings like a thread [sews together] jackets and so on.13
      - The name of one of the older texts in the ?v?t?mbara canon,
   S?yaga?a-, is often rendered as S?trakr?ta-, but the first part doesn't
   correspond to the usual development of the Old Indic word s?tra-. Willem
   Boll?e suggested that it might come from *s?ca-kr?ta- or *s?ca-gata- (in
   his glossary to *Studien zum S?yaga?a*, vol. 1, p. 197). Compare the
   Sanskrit word *s?c?*.
