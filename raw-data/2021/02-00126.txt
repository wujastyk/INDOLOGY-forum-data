A critical edition of the V?yu-pur??a is underway at the Oriental
Institute, Vadodara.

The ?nand??rama editions used multiple manuscripts. These include the Padma
(1894), Brahma (1895), Agni (1900), V?yu (1905), and Matsya (1907) pur??as.

Of the Bibliotheca Indica editions, at least the V?yu edited by
Rajendralala Mitra (2 volumes, 1880, 1888) used multiple manuscripts.

A composite edition of the Bh?gavata-pur?na with three or four commentaries
is *?r?mad Bh?gavata Mah?pur??am*, edited by P. Radhakrishna Sarma, and N.
C. V. Narasimhacharya, 12 volumes (in 14 parts?). Tirupati: Tirumala
Tirupati Devasthanams, 1989-2005 (not yet completed?).

A composite edition of the Brahma-pur??a is found in *Sanskrit Indices and
Text of the Brahmapur??a*, by Peter Schreiner and Renate S?hnen. Pur??a
Research Publications, T?bingen, 1. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1987.

According to the extensive researches of R. C. Hazra, most of the pur??as
now extant are not the original ones. This is based on his gathering
quotations from the pur??as found in the old sm?ti-nibandhas, and on
descriptions of the contents of the pur??as given in some of the pur??as.
The results of his researches were published in a series of journal
articles, and mostly included in his book, *Studies in the Pur??ic Records
on Hindu Rites and Customs*. He concluded that only seven of the now extant
mah?-pur??as can legitimately claim to be the original ones: *M?rka??eya*,
*V?yu*, *Brahm???a*, *Vi??u*, *Matsya*, *Bh?gavata*, and *K?rma*, and even
the *K?rma* with considerable qualifications. Of the other eleven erstwhile
mah?-pur??as, he discovered the original Agni-pur??a in manuscripts under
the name Vahni-pur??a. This was edited and published after his lifetime:

*Vahni-Pur??am, also referred to as ?gneya-Pur??am*, edited by Anasuya
Bhowmik. Bibliotheca Indica Series, no. 336. Kolkata: The Asiatic Society,
2012 (includes as an Introduction the extensive 2-part article by Rajendra
Chandra Hazra titled, ?Studies in the Genuine ?gneya-Pur??a alias
Vahni-Pur??a,? originally published in 1953 and 1954).
