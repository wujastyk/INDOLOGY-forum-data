Dear Madhav,

I second what Andrew says. I also recommend Karl Praust's 2004 paper
(reference below) on the development of the class IX presents. According to
Praust, the realization of /CnHC/ as [Cn?HC] in class IX presents was
avoided already in Proto-Indo-European in favor of [Cn?HC], with an
epenthetic vowel, in order that -n- be non-syllabic throughout the
inflectional paradigm, i.e. like the strong forms, which have the sequence
/CneHC/. In other words, there was analogical pressure to keep the *n* a
consonant, and the epenthetic vowel made that possible. The further
development to -n?- in Indic would then be the result of regular sound
change.

Praust cites the previous literature. Since then, there have been some
further discussions: Lipp 2009:392?4 n. 97; Yoshida 2013; K?mmel 2016; and
Gunkel 2018.

In my paper, I talk a bit about the development of the ? in class III
presents of the type m?m?te. The metrical evidence from the Rigveda
suggests that we should restore some forms with a short i, esp. *mimih?
(for transmitted mim?h?). jahima? 'we leave' is attested in the
Atharvaveda. Those show us the regular phonological development to short i
(in accordance with Jamison's foundational study). The long vowels there
are analogical, and I think it's attractive to have them be analogical to
the class IX presents. If we follow Praust, then the chronology works
nicely: the long ? in class IX would be in place early enough for that
analogy to take place.

Best,

Dieter
