I always thought this was the self-benefactive use of the middle voice,
just as d? in the parasmaipada is to give and d? in the ?tmanepada is to
give to oneself, and thus to take, dh?mahi as 1st pl middle optative to dh?
as wishing "may we place/establish X for ourselves" = "may we requisition
X" ? -- C
