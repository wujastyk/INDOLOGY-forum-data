Perhaps not quite a mnemonic, but I always told my beginning Sanskrit
students as an aid to remembering which of the stops were voiced and which
unvoiced (for their sandhi work), to think of a number line, with the
negative (-) on the left (voiceless) and the positive (+) on the right
(voiced). (That is, e.g., the line: ka, kha, ga, gha, ?a, divided midway as
"-" and "+")
