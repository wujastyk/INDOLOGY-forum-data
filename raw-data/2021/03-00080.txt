Dear all,

Would anyone know what ?Pa?car. 4,8,37? in B?htlingk and Roth?s dictionary refers to? It?s cited under bh?gola:

https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csl-apidev/servepdf.php?dict=PWG&page=5-0334

The abbreviation ?Pa?car? is not found in the dictionary?s list of abbreviations. The Cologne people provide this note:

PA?CAR = PA?CARATNA ? [Cologne Addition]

Monier-Williams, under bh?gola, cites ?Pa?car,? which is explained as ?Pa?car?tra? in the list of abbreviations. I assume therefore that Pa?car?tra is correct and Pa?caratna is wrong. Under the entry p??car?tra, MW has ?N. of sev. works,? which doesn?t help much. P??car?tra is a large body of literature.

The fifth volume of B?htlingk and Roth, which has the entry bh?gola, came out in 1868. As such, I assume that we?re dealing with a work for which a Western edition was published prior to 1868. Since three numbers are needed for the reference in B?htlingk and Roth, I further assume that we?re dealing with a larger work.

I have looked in the NCC under Pa?car? and P?ncar? for a work with a printed edition published before 1868, but without luck.

Any help in identifying the text in the reference will be greatly appreciated.

Have a good weekend.

All best wishes,
Toke
