Not quite answering Harsha's question, but I thought that I'd share that
R?dh? is mentioned earlier than the 11th c., namely in two places that I
can think of:

(a) an Apabhramsha verse by the poet Govinda is cited as an example of the
mattavil?sin?-m?tr? by Svayambhu, who wrote in the 9th c., in
Svayambh?cchandas 4.10.2 (p. 56 in Velankar's edition):

savva g?viu ja? vi j??i
hari su??hu vi ?ar??a
d?i di??hi jahi? kahi? vi r?h? (r?hihe?)
k? sakka? sa?var?vi
?a??hanaa?a n?he?? pal???a? (?a??hanaa?u?)

?Although he looks at all the g?p?s, Hari is no doubt giving special
attention to R?dh?. Who can conceal a glance that has already been sent
with affection??

(b) a Prakrit verse in the Sattasa? (v. 89 in Weber's edition), which has
often been considered to be an interpolation just because it is about
R?dh?. (The date of the Sattasa? is a big problem, but if anyone wants to
argue that this verse is later than the 11th century on textual grounds, go
ahead.)

muham?ru??a ta? ka?ha g?raa? r?hi?i ava?ent?
???a vallav??a? a????a vi g?raa? harasi

?Krishna, in blowing the dust away from R?dh? with your breath, you?re
taking away the consideration you?ve paid to these other cowherd women.?

There are probably other references if one looks for them (which I haven't
done).
