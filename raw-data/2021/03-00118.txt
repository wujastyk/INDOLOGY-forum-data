Dear John,
According to the information I have, the Purana Journal ended with the vol. 51 of 2009. Here a list sent by the Antiquarian Banerjee (who has himself stopped his activities).
Best wishes,
Christophe

Dear Colleagues,

The most recent issue of the journal Pur??a of which I am aware isvolume 49 (2007).  Does anyone have firm information about whether any later volumes have been published or whether it has ceased publication.  Also, I am particularly interested in two articles in vol. 45 (2003), those by Bob Goldman and by Sally Sutherland Goldman; if anyone has PDFs of these I should be grateful to receive them.

Best wishes

John
