Dear Indologists,

 

I would like to know 

 
 the difference in geographic extent indicated by terms such as r???ra, vi?aya, ma??ala, etc. 
The earliest datable inscription/s where dynasties claim solar, lunar, or mythical lineages
 

 

Thank you in advance for any information.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
