Dear JLC,

To your nice question ...

/// I wonder whether the botanical species of palm leaf used here (as measurement tool) is the same as that of the palm leaf used for writing?/// ? 

My quick reply:

My reading from https://www.hindutamil.in/news/spirituals/51275--4.html <https://www.hindutamil.in/news/spirituals/51275--4.html> is that the leaves used for the measurement  of making bronze idols are ????????????? ?????? (from coconut trees) which are different from ??? ?????? (from palmyra trees) that I suppose were/are used for writing. 

I?ll share more information if/when I get them.

Best wishes,
VSR
