I'd appreciate a copy of an article by N.R. Gore that has the text (or
prat?kas) of Vrajan?tha's Padyatara?gin?.  Poona Orientalist vol. 11 pp.
46-55.

Also, I have Kulkarni's article on the Prast?vamukt?val? was published in
the Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute (1958). Does anyone
know if this text was ever published?

Thanks in advance,
