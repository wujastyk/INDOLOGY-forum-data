Subject: [INDOLOGY] Esoteric Buddhism in Central Asia

Dear All,

I wish you all are safe and well during this endless global pandemic. Anyone can point out a few articles on Esoteric Buddhism in connection with Silk Road's sites and particularly with Eastern centres (such as Dunhuang). I am very interested in articles based on iconographic developments (from the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia).

Best wishes,
Paolo
