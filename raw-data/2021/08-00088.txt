Dear Indologists?
Gudrun Buhnemann has asked me to share this announcement with the Indology list on behalf of Ulrike Niklas (University of Cologne) and the effort to ?Save the Cologne University India Summer Schools.? 

GoFundMe, https://gofund.me/bca6f6b8 <https://gofund.me/bca6f6b8>

Even a small donation could help Ulrike Niklas reach their fundraising goal. And if you can't make a donation, it would be great if you could share the fundraiser to help spread the word.
