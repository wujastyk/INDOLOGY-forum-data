My thanks to P?ter Sz?ler for confirming off-list that the Southern Recension of the Mah?bh?rata does not mention dances by K???a, Vi??u, Indr??i, and Manmatha. 

On this day of happy ??am, it is interesting to explore what these B??a stories suggest regarding the question of Bali. Clifford Hospital has discussed in detail the stories regarding Bali in various Sanskrit texts as well as the connection between Mah?bali and ??am in Kerala in his book, The Righteous Demon: A Study of Bali. But what he has completely missed is any discussion of the dynasty of the the B??as, who claimed descent from Mah?bali. Given that this claim was articulated during the period when different dynasties were claiming descent from the Solar and Lunar dynasties to buttress the legitimacy of their sovereignty over their domains, it is interesting that the B??as chose to claim their origin from Bali. After all, in most Sanskrit accounts, he loses his sovereignty. Also, the lineage has a much better ancestor in Prahl?da. Even B??a is not pushed into hell or netherworld losing his sovereignty. So, the reason for the chiefs/minor kings of the B??a dynasty to trace their lineage from Mah?bali is the possibility that there must have existed a tradition in the Tamil country, that gave a much better treatment to Bali than the Sanskrit texts. It is possible traces of this tradition had influenced the role of Mah?bali in the ??am celebration of Kerala.

In the meantime, with the kind help of Simon Broadbeck and McComas Taylor, I have looked at the content of the critical editions of the Harivam?a and the Vi??u Pur?na. They do not have any mention of the dances by K???a, Vi??u, Indr??i, and Manmatha in connection with B???sura. I am assuming that the critical edition of the Mah?bh?rata does not have them either since you mention only the Southern Recension.

Paleography,? discusses the Southern Recension?s Malayalam version (SRM) and its alignment with the ??rada version of the Northern Recension. The date of the Cilappatik?ram was close to that of the date of SRM being moved into Kerala by p?rva?ikha Brahmans discussed by T. P. Mahadevan. The location of I?a?k? A?ika?, the author of the Cilappatik?ram, was also close to that of SRM postulated by Mahadevan. But, the Cilappatik?ram mentions the four dances performed in B??a?s city, which are not mentioned in any Sanskrit text produced in the north, especially before about fifth century CE.

> Does this mean stories related to Mah?bh?rata and K???a were transmitted from north India to the Tamil country through non-Brahman traditions even before the Brahman migrations discussed by Mahadevan? Does this also mean that among the stories that were circulating in north India, only whatever were preferred by Brahmans became part of the previleged literary texts, the rest being lost or relegated to folk traditions? So, does the Cilappatik?ram give us a view into some of the lost traditions of north India? Or does it represent creative innovations in the Tamil south as in the case of K???a defeating the seven bulls to marry Satya in the later Bh?gavata Pur??a as discussed by F. Hardy in his Viraha Bhakti?

In describing Damayant??s search for Nala mentions her approaching an a?oka, the Mah?bh?rata has her say, ??h, woe on me, here stands this beautiful tree in the deep of the forest, shining with its many chaplets of blossoms, like the illustrious king of Drami?a.? I do not know which Tamil king is being referred to in this narrative.

>> Apart from the Hariva??a, the Southern recension of the Mah?bh?rata and many pur??as relate the story of B???sura. The Mah?bh?rata (2.35.29.d*21.1448?1534), the Bh?gavata? (10.62.1?63.53), the Brahma? (205.9?206.50), and the Vi??u?pur??a (5.32.6?33.50) share more or less the similar storyline with the Hariva??a, while the version of the K?rma?pur??a (1.17.1?7) differs a bit more from the others. B??a also appears in the K?lik??pur??a, in the story of Naraka. In this pur??a, it is he, who taught the worship of ?iva to Naraka (K?lik??pur??a 39.1?8).
