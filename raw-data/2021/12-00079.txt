Hello Dean,

I don't know of any Middle Persian sources that would support Nabarz's
view. It's quite inaccurate, and goes against what we, or I, know about
Zoroastrianism. I have had a brief look at some of the other descriptions
of Zoroastrianism in Nabarz (2005) and would say that most are outdated by
now, if they had not already been then.

A couple of the Middle Persian texts associate Zarathustra's mother with
the Endless Light, but none seem to suggest any virgin birth. That's why I
said yesterday that the process is complex involving a number of steps.
Zarathustra is certainly not conceived like other people, and
divine/supernatural beings go to various lengths to make his birth
possible. In D?nkard 7 that I mentioned yesterday, his parents have
intercourse three times with the idea to conceive a child.

If you read Persian, I can warmly recommend this book which is a collection
of sources:

Amoozgar, J. & A. Tafazzoli. 1997. Zoroaster's mythical life. Tehran.

Best wishes,
Arash
