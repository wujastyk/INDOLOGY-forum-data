Subject: [INDOLOGY] Photograph of manuscript with Newari script
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_=V1zA0sYzfafXTBZzN=1S0SnWg5FcvridYFhN_QYWaw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
Would anyone have a colour photograph of a manuscript with newari script.
Something suitable as a visual for a websiite page.  The contents aren't
important, only that its in colour and the script is Newari, the more
photogenic the better.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
