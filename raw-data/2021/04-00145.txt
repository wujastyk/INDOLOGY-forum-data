*One Flew Over the Nest: an Externalist Among Prama?n?ava?dins*

*Serena Saccone*
* University of Naples, ?L?Orientale?*

S?ubhagupta (8th cent.) is a key figure within the Buddhist tradition of
logic and epistemology (*prama?n?a*). Most of his works are in fact a
systematization, as well as elaboration, of the doctrines and arguments
found in Dharmaki?rti?s writings. In this respect, he shares views
with (and perhaps also directly influenced) his fellow Buddhist
contemporaries, S?a?ntaraks?ita and Kamalas?i?la, who represent the
mainstream tradition in the 8th century. On the other hand, as seen in his
magnum opus, the ?Verses on the Demonstration of External Objects? (*
*Ba?hya?rthasiddhika?rika?*), S?ubhagupta significantly deviates from that
mainstream tradition on some crucial tenets by advocating the existence of
external objects and the illogicality that cognitions bear their objects?
images (*nira?ka?rava?da*). The main point of contention appears to be (to
some extent) the theory of self-awareness (*svasam?vedana*) of cognitions.
In this lecture, I shall present the pivotal elements of that internal
debate, which, arguably, made S?ubhagupta the Buddhist externalist (
*bahirarthava?din*) *par excellence* for that tradition.

*Bio*

*Serena Saccone *is an Associate Professor at the University of Naples,
?L?Orientale.? She holds a PhD in Indology and Tibetology from the
University of Turin and was a research fellow at the Austrian Academy of
Sciences from 2015 to 2021. Her main area of research is the intellectual
history of Buddhism, focusing on South Asian authors from the early
medieval period, with a specific interest in epistemology, logic and
soteriology, as well as their interconnections. Saccone?s monograph, ?On
the Nature of Things? (2018), concerns the internal Buddhist debate on
cognitions and their object in the 8th century. Her second book, ?Tantra
and Prama?n?a. Studies in the Sa?raman?jari?? (2021), co-authored with
Pe?ter-Da?niel Sza?nto?, deals with the interrelationship between Tantric
Buddhism and the Digna?ga-Dharmaki?rtian tradition of logic and
epistemology.
