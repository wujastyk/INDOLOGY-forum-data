Subject: [INDOLOGY] Upgrade of the Mailman software
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cf=+-GckrM4ECaxY-c03RbyEewYtC5285+0WEJNX9+HZA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

The INDOLOGY mail forum runs on a piece of software called Mailman.  Our
installation was recently upgraded from version 2 to version 3
<https://docs.mailman3.org/projects/mailman/en/latest/src/mailman/docs/NEWS.html>.
At the same time, our service provider has changed the interfaces for
registering and controlling our accounts and for consulting the archive.

The links on the main indology website, INDOLOGY.info were updated several
days ago; if you find any errors there, please inform the INDOLOGY committee
<indology-owner at list.indology.info>.

The new interface for managing your account is here:

   - https://list.indology.info/list/indology.list.indology.info

The software interface is called "Affinity."  Your INDOLOGY subscription
will work as always without taking any action.  But if you would like to
change the settings of your subscription, you need to "register."  The
procedure is simple and self-evident.

The new interface for the INDOLOGY Archive is now here:

   - https://list.indology.info/empathy

The software is called "Empathy."  As before, the archive is open to the
public.

Please let the committee <indology-owner at list.indology.info> (not me!) know
if you discover any bugs.

Best wishes,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY list <http://indology.info> committee member
