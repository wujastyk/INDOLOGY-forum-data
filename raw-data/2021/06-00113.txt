Dear colleagues,

This is to corroborante the answer Rosane Rocher gave to the interesting question of  Dean Michael Anderson.
It was indeed the other way round for those creations were the result  of an increasing aspiration to secularism (?   la?cit? ?). It was specially the case, regarding the Ecole pratique des hautes ?tudes (EPHE),  with the creation, in 1886, of its 5h section, which was named section ?des Sciences religieuses?  (and not ?d'histoire des religions?, for instance), for the issue was to provide a non-denominational teaching  of religious facts.  Moreover, under the aegis of Victor Duruy, the Minister of Education (Ministre de l?instruction publique), the credits allocated until then to the Faculties of Catholic Theology were transferred to the EPHE at the occasion of the creation of the section of Sciences religieuses, to the great displeasure, not surprisingly, of those Faculties.


Best,

Lyne

No, that was done by the government. The Arabist Silvestre de Sacy had long lobbied for them.

Were these the ones founded by the church to facilitate conversion to Christianity, as so many of those early positions were?
