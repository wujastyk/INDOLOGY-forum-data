Dear All,

Does anyone of you have a pdf of the entire *Prau?hamanoram?*, especially
beyond the *avyay?bh?vaprakara?a*? I have access to several scans ending
with the *avyay?bh?va *section, but cannot find the remaining sections. I
would be very grateful if you could share it with me.

?????????? ??????,
??????
