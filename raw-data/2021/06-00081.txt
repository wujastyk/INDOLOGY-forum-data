Dear Dominik,
That our BA in Sanskrit includes a few courses without Sanskrit requirement
does not disqualify our BA as one in Sanskrit! It definitely focuses on the
Sanskrit language, as is specified on the first page to which I sent a link:

son objet principal est le sanskrit et ses litt?ratures, dont elle met en
?vi?dence la richesse: l?apprentissage du sanskrit s?y fait avant tout par
la lecture et la traduction in?tensives de textes appartenant ? des genres
tr?s diff?rents (contes, ?pop?e, po?sie savante, litt??ra?ture
historiographique, trait?s philosophiques, trait?s d?esth?tique, etc.).

With all best wishes,
Isabelle
