AV21-218
Hindu Philosophy Unit and Jain Studies Unit and Philosophy of Religion Unit

Theme: Jain Philosophy: Perspectives on Non-One-Sidedness
Sunday, November 21, 12:30 PM-2:30 PM (Virtual)
Michael Allen, University of Virginia, Presiding

This panel is conceived as an opportunity to assess the contemporary relevance of studying the Jain theories of perspectives, especially in the field of philosophy of religion. The theory of viewpoints allows Jain authors to classify the metaphysics of their contemporaries in relation to their own position through a unique method of categorization. In this categorization, ones decision for a certain kind of metaphysics directly informs ones liberating practices as well as this-worldly oriented religious activities. Such a comprehensive type of classification might aid the formation of a more inclusive philosophy of religion, inasmuch as it is meaningful for both theist and atheist as well as philosophical and religious traditions.

AV21-413
Hindu Philosophy Unit

Theme: New Approaches to Advaita Ved?nta

Sunday, November 21, 5:00 PM-6:30 PM (Virtual)
Elaine Fisher, Stanford University, Presiding

Advaita Ved?nta is probably the best-known tradition of Hindu philosophy, yet there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of its history. The three papers in this session offer new approaches to the study of the tradition in the second millennium. The first two papers draw attention to vernacular works of Advaita Ved?nta, from 12th-century Maharashtra to 17th-century Rajasthan. The third paper focuses on the 18th-century Tantric intellectual Bh?skarar?ya and his creative, critical engagement with Advaita Ved?nta.

AV22-212
Buddhist Philosophy Unit and Hindu Philosophy Unit and Religion in South Asia Unit

Theme: Productive Influences between Hindu and Buddhist Thought
Monday, November 22, 12:30 PM-2:30 PM (Virtual)
Leah Kalmanson, University of North Texas, Presiding

The few hundreds of years bookending the turn of the second millennium CE saw a golden age of Indian dialectics. A period of highly intertextual philosophical exchange and debate, this era was incredibly intellectually productive. Not only were there intense debates raging between philosophical schools, but within them as well. It was the friction of these exchanges that defined a forging crucible, helping to further solidify the Indian dar?anasand Buddhism in contradistinction to each other. Indeed, it would be the last formative event of Indian Buddhism until it all put disappeared from the sub-continent shortly thereafter. The proposed panel examines the exchange between Buddhist and Hindu philosophical schools of this era through the lens of their productivity. That is, each paper examines the manner in which these confrontations lead to a more nuanced articulation of both Buddhist and Hindu philosophy.

AV22-312
Hindu Philosophy Unit

Theme: Udayana on Buddhist Idealism: A Philosophical Roundtable
Monday, November 22, 3:00 PM-4:30 PM (Virtual)
Parimal G. Patil, Harvard University, Presiding

The philosopher Udayana (10th/11th c.) was a leading representative of the Ny?ya-Vai?e?ika tradition and a fierce critic of Buddhism. This session brings together several scholars to discuss and debate Udayana?s arguments against idealism, as presented in the ?tma-tattva-viveka, section 2 (?On the [Buddhist] Refutation of External Objects?). The goal is to create a space for lively and rigorous discussion among the panelists and with the audience. A handout with the original Sanskrit and an English translation of selections from Udayana?s text will be provided.
