Dear Jim,

I've pasted below two derivations given in commentaries to the
Prakriy?kaumud? or R?macandra; the first is by Vi??hala in his Pras?da (p.
3 of the first volume) and the second (spanning two portions) is by
K???a ?e?a in his Prak??a (pp. 8ff. of the first volume). The former text
can be downloaded here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YrjVLXHkqneSwwEjNzWK2vx_CNfA-sHn?usp=sharing>.
The latter, here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NysQ-LteMaqetcAjSKp3QnnxbxOLyLYU?usp=sharing>.
Hope that's helpful.

All the Best,
Victor
