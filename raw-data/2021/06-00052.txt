Dear All,

I am looking for a pdf of Pieter Nicolaas Ubbo Harting, *Selections from
the Baudh?yana-G?hyapari?i??as?tra, *Amersfoort: J. Valkhoff & co., 1922. I
have a scan of the Introduction only. If anyone of you has a pdf of the
entire work, I would be very grateful if you could share it with me.

Best wishes,
Chiara Policardi
