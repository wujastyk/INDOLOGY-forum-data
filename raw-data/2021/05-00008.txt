Dear friends,

Many thanks to all those who answered my query on and off list. You are 
wonderful colleagues and an amazing group.

I am tempted to impute Stahl's avoidance of even initials to the need he 
would have had to choose between two languages in what was a politically 
thorny situation.

In gratitude and with best wishes,
Rosane
