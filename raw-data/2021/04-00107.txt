Is there such a thing as a western perspective on the RV?  What might be
the demarcation criteria for such a taxonomy?  And if such a category could
be delineated, would it be desirable or fruitful to do so?  In my view, the
category "western" or "the West" is best avoided because it is so deeply
flawed, conceptually, that whatever you say it is, there are ten
counter-examples.  The most obvious of which being that Japan, where much
Vedic research is conducted, is east of India.

I prefer to proceed on the basis that all serious scholars are united in
their pursuit of truth, wherever their desks may happen to be located.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
