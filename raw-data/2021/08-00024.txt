Dear colleagues,

Due to (ongoing!) library closures I have been unable to locate the
following article:

G. von Simson, "Die Buddhas der Vorzeit: Versuch einer
astralmythologischen Deutung," *Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik *7,
1981, pp. 77-91.

I would appreciate it if anyone could provide a copy.

Thanks in advance,
Rich Salomon
