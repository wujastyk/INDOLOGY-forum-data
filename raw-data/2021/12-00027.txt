About Nyayamrta
Nyayamrt is one of three great works of Shri Vyasatirtha. Vyasatirtha, well
known Saint and Philosopher of Vijayanagar time, has composed the Nyayamrta
for the comprehensive review of Advaita Philosophy.
"In my opinion Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha present the highest dialectical
skill in Indian
thought. Readers, introduced to the philosophy of Vyasa-tirtha will realize
the strength and uncompromising impressiveness of the dualistic position."
Dr.S.N.Dasgupta A History of Indian Philosophy.
