Dear Jim,

I see your problem, and I think that the replies you have got so far are being helpful in clarifying this matter. Thinking about how to make sense of your passage in the light of other occurrences of ku?cik? in a yogic context (sorry in advance for stating things that may seem just obvious to you), I?m wondering whether the use of ha?h?t in your passage could refer to the quintessentially/necessarily forceful nature of utkr?nti, even if one has the ?key? that opens the doors (keeping in mind the remarks by Matthew Kapstein etc.). As you know (better than me, as I am using your own writings as a reference!), the word ku?cik? is sometimes used in Sanskrit (and, I add, Old Javanese) texts in connection with practices of drawing up (utkr?nti) the kun?d?alini? along the central subtle channel of the body (some sort of ?yogic suicide?), as well as practices involving breath control, and sometimes the retention and violent expulsion of the breath (ku?cik? would refer to the retention in some Old Javanese texts, which mention the ku?ci rahasya or ?secret key? through which one may close rather than open the doors). See, e.g., Kubjika?matatantra 8.73 (ku?cikodgh??ayed bilam), 23.114 (e?u sth?ne ?rgala? yojya ku?cikordhva? niyojayet; this seems to imply the same metaphor: if my understanding is correct, one has to impel the ku?ick? upwards when the orifices are locked with the bolts, meaning one has to break them open by way of the ?key?/ku?cik??), and the related passages that yourself discuss in Mallinson 2007:21 and 177, notes 79?80. It seems interesting that the Old Javanese texts seem to use ku?cik? in the context of closing the doors and then breaking them open, and I?m wondering whether this represents some alternative or perhaps even earlier trend of thought/practice.

Best,

Andrea

> I wonder if anybody can help me understand a simile in a ha?hayoga text I?m editing, the Vivekam?rta??a. Verse 34 reads:
> 
> udgh??ayet kap??a? tu yath? ku?cikay? ha?h?t |
> ku??aliny? tath? yog? mok?adv?ra? vibhedayet ||
> 
> My incomplete translation is as follows: ?The yogi should use Ku??alin? to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a ku?cik? to force open a kap??a.? I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.
