Dear colleagues,



(With apologies for some crossposting), I wanted to pass along word of an
upcoming lecture on South Asian languages and scripts from the Library of
Congress Asian Division and Endangered Alphabets Project. At the bottom of
the message, you will find info and registration links for two additional
lectures on African and Southeast Asian writing systems, too. Please feel
free to forward to colleagues and groups who may be interested.



Script Invention and Revitalization in Eastern and Northeastern India since
1950

Wednesday April 14, 11:00am-12:30pm EDT

In this livestreamed lecture, Tim Brookes ? a world authority on endangered
writing systems and director of the Endangered Alphabets Project ? will
discuss the recent history of two areas of India that have seen vibrant
movements to create or recreate writing systems for languages, such as
Santali and Sora. These efforts by communities who speak these languages
provide alternatives to external pressures to render languages in dominant
scripts like Devanagari and the Roman alphabet.



This lecture is part of the Library?s ?Endangered Alphabets and Why We
Write? lecture series. See the registration links below for information on
the other two lectures in this series:
