Dear Patrick,

I too was wondering about this a while back, and received the following two
references from Professor Oskar von Hin?ber, which I pass on to the list
because they may be of more general interest:

J. F. Blumhardt: Catalogue of the Gujarati and Rajasthani Manuscripts in
the India Office Library. London1954, S.6 on the name devanagari. (

Walter H. Maurer: On the name devan?gar? , JAOS 96.1976, S. 101-104 (
