udgh??ayet kap??a? tu yath? ku?cikay? ha?h?t |
ku??aliny? tath? yog? mok?adv?ra? vibhedayet ||

Just as one might throw open the palace gates by forcibly turning the key,
So must a yog? break open the portals of mok?a with the force / power of
his (awakened) ku??alin?.

Jim I think ha?h?t here is like Hindi "zor se", and kap??a is like kiv?? (a
ba??, bh?r? double darv?z?). It's just easier in Hindi:

??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ?? (?? ???) ?? ????? ????? ??
??? ??? ???? ???? ????????? ????? ?? ?????? ?? ????? ?? ????? ??? ???? ??

I trust you are on the very verge of what the verse describes... the
ku??alin? is key, so to speak.

Yours,

AV.
