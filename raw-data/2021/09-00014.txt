Subject: [INDOLOGY] various Sanskrit resources
Message-ID: <CAEjEOsC+aNmNeyvwOM_1NRa862X+1fxOrNfY+=2+SST1psTwvA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

There are a few resources I've been putting together for Sanskrit students
and teachers that I thought might be useful for the List to know about.

-- My Reader still hasn't come out (it will in November!), but the online
flashcards for the 900-word study vocab list are available on Brainscape
<https://www.brainscape.com/l/dashboard/an-introductory-sanskrit-reader-17671407/decks>.
To access them all for free, students need to open a (free) Brainscape
account and then click on this code:
https://www.brainscape.com/p/16X72-LH-AIRCF (The list is meant for
beginning to intermediate students; it focuses on epic and narrative texts
(so: the kinds of genres students would likely encounter early on), is
split into two parts (ca. 450 very frequent words, ca. 450 frequent words),
and was put together using the word frequency tool at sanskritdictionary.com.)
If anybody would like the pdf of the entire list, please simply email me.

-- A few days ago, the second episode of the Sanskrit Studies Podcast
<http://sanskritstudiespodcast.com> went live. I started this podcast to
introduce the breadth of scholarly work on Sanskrit in all its facets and
applications to a wider public: precise and detailed, but always
accessible, in the hopes that it will not only help us attract students to
the field, but perhaps also give us a better idea what our colleagues
further afield are doing. I hope you will agree that my first two
interviewees, McComas Taylor and Dagmar Wujastyk, both introduce their work
and interests splendidly!

-- The grammar posters I made to go with my intro textbook are now also
finally available <https://shop.yogicstudies.com/collections/accessories>
online. (The bigger ones are *really* big, so I'd recommend those only for
classrooms or offices.) In the past, my students have found them very
helpful after about a term/semester or so of Intro Sanskrit.

All my best,
     Antonia
