Subject: [INDOLOGY] Source of a half stanza
Message-ID: <CAOYD-QCNtH4cbeReWq5HH4a1anPMjgvJTWJrvdX3nFp=zjcH1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I encountered this half stanza:

> viyog? v?tha yog? v? advait?pattim icchati

and could not find a specific source for it.
Of course it could be one of those sayings that just float around, but if
anyone should have a suggestion about a (likely) source, I would be happy
to hear it.

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
