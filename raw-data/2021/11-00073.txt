This is of course absolutely wonderful news for younger scholars and the field in general, especially since the funding for the South Asia Across the Disciplines  series , which also published first books on the region (not just indology) was finally exhausted. 

Rosane, Patrick et al  at the  Foundation are doing great work for the field. 

Best wishes to all for a pleasant and productive holiday season.

> The Ludo and Rosane Rocher Foundation has created a program that provides subventions for the publication of "first books" by young scholars in the field of classical Indology. The scholars are expected to submit a CV, a book title, summary, and table of contents to the Foundation, with a list of potential publishers. These should be academic presses: either US university presses or the US offices of foreign academic presses, such as Oxford University Press. Upon preliminary approval, the author will send the full manuscript for review. The manuscript should be in publishable form, that is, one that the author sends to a publisher, in most cases a thoroughly revised dissertation. Once a book has been approved by the Foundation, it will provide a subvention of $ 5000 to the press that undertakes to publish it. It will be the responsibility of the author to find a suitable press. The published book must carry on the Copyright page the acknowledgment: ?Published with the support of The Ludo and Rosane Rocher Foundation.? This program is intended to support young scholars in the early years of their postdoctoral academic life.

> It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, Playing and Reality
