Sorry, some of the embedded links dropped out of my earlier mail:

A similar exercise was undertaken comparatively for India and China and the
study of classical Chinese
<http://www.sheldonpollock.org/archive/pollock_what_2018.pdf>. Some aspects
of the history of Indology in France is here, I think:

d?Intino, Silvia, and Sheldon I. Pollock, eds. *Enjeux De La Philologie
Indienne: Traditions, ?ditions, Traductions/Transferts*. Paris: Institute
de Civilisation Indienne, Coll?ge de France, 2019.

Thanks and best,

AV.
