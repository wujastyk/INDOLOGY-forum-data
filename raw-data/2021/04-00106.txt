Dear Prof. Pandurangi,

Regarding comprehensive study material for the ?gveda, and in particular your question as to whether a ?gveda reverse word index had been prepared by anyone: I do not know of a reverse word index. You no doubt already use the complete ?gveda word index prepared by Vishva Bandhu and his team. Besides this, there is another helpful study tool, A ?gvedic Word Concordance, by Alexander Lubotsky, 2 volumes, 1997. It lists every word found in the ?gveda, followed by the number of its occurrences there, and then it gives every p?da in which the word occurs. So you can easily see the usage of each word throughout the whole ?gveda in one convenient place. Of course, you often have to go to the whole verse, or even the whole s?kta, to get the context. But it provides a good start. I do not know if it is available online.

Best regards,

David Reigle

Thanks.
It is good they are moving ahead with this commentary, which was available partly few years ago.

Still many mantras are left out for being too clear? for example 1.2.4-6 are left.
I hope they will cover whole rgveda.

This will help us to understand the western perspective which I want to note in my new commentary on first mandala.

Any other suggestions?
