Dear Jim,

     No. P??ini does not consider r? and r to be Savar?as. The traditional
phonetic classifications cited by Bha??oji do consider these two to be
m?rdhanyas, but that is not sufficient to make them Savar?as. Their
Prayatna "phonetic effort" also needs to be the same. Theoretically, all
vowels, other than short "a" are considered to be Vivr?ta "open," namely
having an open gap between the point of articulation and the articulator
which is usually some portion of the tongue. The tradition includes r? in
the same category. At the same time, the actual articulation of r? is
explained by Pata?jali to be a consonant r flanked by two vocalic elements,
something like ?r?. However, phonologically, r? is treated as and acts as a
vowel, while r acts like a consonant.
