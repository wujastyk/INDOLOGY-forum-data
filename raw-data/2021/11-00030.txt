Subject: [INDOLOGY] Anup, Bikaner 1944 manuscripts' catalogue
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdTMJdaAE5i_+jOG4UXW0jNvs_tkPjw63_8mZ8JKJNy5g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm pleased to announce that there is now a scan of the Kunhan Raja 1944
Anup library catalogue available at catalogues.indology.info (direct link
<https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/index.php/s/yfwp8XFRtmnQ8Mr?path=%2FBiswas%200106%20Bikaner%20Anup%201944>).
It has taken a long time to get a scan of this rare catalogue and the
present contribution is thanks to the splendid service of the Wellcome
Library, London.

This catalogue is number 0106 in the Biswas survey

The Wellcome has a temporary policy at the moment of offering scans of
their out-of-copyright items free of charge.  Their search interface is now
