Madhav, Hans,


Many thanks for the references and detail. As Madhav stated earlier, the issue of retroflex ? is ?complicated? and it was instructive to see the factors at work behind its various incarnations, going back to PII.

Are some of your examples [other than ruki and o?t? > a?t? ?eight?, covered by these theories?

The ?ra?yaka says that the M????keya version of the RV was sa?ak?ra/sa?ak?ra, and that ??kalya followed M????keya in this respect. But the discussion itself indicates that there may have been other reciters whose Sa?hit? was a?ak?ra/a?ak?ra.
