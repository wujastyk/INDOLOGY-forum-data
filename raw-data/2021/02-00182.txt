With thanks for Peter Wyzlic's help, I'd like to let the curious know 
that Hermes regrettably ceased publication at the very same time 
Schlegel was recommending it to Lassen.

Dear (especially German) Colleagues,

Might you know if Christian Lassen published reviews/articles in 
/Hermes, oder kritisches Jahrbuch der Literatur/ in the 1830s, as A. W. 
Schlegel suggested he do? WorldCat shows that magazine to be preserved 
almost exclusively in German libraries, and I have not found digitized 
copies for the 1830s.

With thanks and best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
