Dear Johanna,

I was just wondering to what extent, without native speakers (and even with
modern native speakers), we have any chance of reconstructing classical
Sanskrit phonetics. Devanagari is of course much closer to the ?one
grapheme - one phoneme? ideal than e.g. Greek or Latin writing are, and in
some later grammatical works we have descriptions is how sounds are to be
pronounced; but that still usually only gives us an overview of phonemes,
and not necessarily their complete phonetic reality.

I think it?s much more important to teach our students to be consistent in
their approximations, so as to be intelligible, than to give them the idea
that there is *one* correct ?ideal? pronunciation, so to speak.

All best,
     Antonia
