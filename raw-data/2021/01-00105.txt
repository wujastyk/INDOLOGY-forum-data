Subject: [INDOLOGY] video Buddhacarita murals Sri Lanka
Message-ID: <8efda755-d3e3-43bb-e037-dbc4de87d013@gmail.com>

Dear listmembers,

for about two or three decades, starting at the end of the 19th century, 
it was very popular in Sri Lanka monasteries to visualize buddhist 
themes in a style which is reminiscent of theater performances.
I came across a monastery in Colombo where the complete Buddhacarita is 
depicted in this painting style and I decided now to make a video with 
(german accented) englisch eplanations.

are missing
