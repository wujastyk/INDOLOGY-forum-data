Noteworthily,  the R?p?vat?ra and the Siddhar?pa  (a simple list of paradigms based on the former), which clearly distinct nominal stems ("originally") in -t or -d, place the pronominal stems (tac-/yac-/etac-chabda) just after the -d stems (da-k?r?nta) not after the -t stems.

Such however, is not the recitational practice." [HOS 52]. So, should a pada end as tat or tad seems to have been a very long debate. The practice of the ?aunak?ya-Atharvaveda Padap??ha, as noted in the Atharva-Pr?ti??khya reads: tat iti tak?r?nta? ?aunake.  This is also the case in the manuscripts of the Padap??ha and Ja??p??ha that I used for my edition in the Recitational Permutations of the ?aunak?ya Atharvaveda [HOS 61].  Such is also the practice of the RV Padap??ha. But as the rule in the ?aunak?ya-Catur?dhy?yik? shows, there was a dispute among different scholars about this.
