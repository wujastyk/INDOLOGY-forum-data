Subject: [INDOLOGY] Trippunitura MS catalogues?
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeYCs1Pp_K9WeU1yFnLUnC3aRO=nz3050ichfi8-k74cw@mail.gmail.com>

Biswas records the following two finding-aids for the library of the
Government Sanskrit College in Trippunitura (near Kochi and Ernakulam).

Does anyone have a scan of any of this material, by chance?  0995 probably
only exists at the NCC project at the U. Madras.   But 0996 may have been
published.

I visited this library some years ago, and saw their hand-written ledger /
accessions list.  But I was searching for a specific item, and it didn't
occur to me to do more.

Best,
Dominik
