Dear All,

I was wondering if anyone might have a pdf of this article:

Verardi, Giovanni. "Osservazioni sulle sculture in argilla e su alcuni
ambienti dei complessi templari I e II di Pendzikent." Annali
dell'Instituto Orientale di Napoli 42,1982.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!


Thanks,

Luther
