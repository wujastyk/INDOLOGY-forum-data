Many thanks to Professor Roland Steiner, who came to my rescue with Tilak Raj Chopra's paper, and to Dr. David Reigle for mentioning the GRETIL version of Chopra?s edition. I was aware of this version, as always very reliably input by Klaus Wille, and had used it, but needed to look at some of the documentation accompanying the edition. 
I'm grateful to this list!

But I have no access to a library and I need the article or, in particular, the 'Supplement: Text of the Sabhika-Parivarta, edited for the First Time from Manuscripts?, relatively quickly for a research project. Ordering the book and waiting for it to be delivered would take too long...
