Dear colleagues,

I wanted to bring to your attention that the Faculty of Asian and Middle
Eastern Studies at the University of Cambridge is now advertising a
two-years postdoctoral research associate position. The researcher will
work in the research team of the project "An Intellectual History of Late
Ved?nta (1750-1900)," which began last September.

The application deadline is December 13th, with interviews in early January
2022.

Best wishes,

Jonathan
