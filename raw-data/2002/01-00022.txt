Unfortunately this confirms what I had feared, namely that it is not
at all easy to go from the fairly wide spread varieties of
WP-solutions for diacritics to PDF. Unless there is a WP wizard who
can enlighten us, we will have to share documents by using unformated
text in those mediation codes that are not limited to one platform or
pogramm, like csx or that of the devnag package - just as in the
e-text archive(s).
