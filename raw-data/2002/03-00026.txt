At the time (c.1880?) Knauer (in Kiew, I think) could not have known what
was in the KGS (LGS) as only Barth (in Paris) had made some copies of the
Kashmir MSS brought by Buehler fro Kashmir in 1875 & kept at Poona since
then.

However, he might have referred to Haug's older paper (c. 1870, Bavarian
Academy) about the relations between Katha and *VisnuSm*/Manava texts.
Must check details in my office.
