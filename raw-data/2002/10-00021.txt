There a recent dissertation that should be of interest:

The ksanabhangasiddhi-anvayatmika : an eleventh-century Buddhist work on
existence and causal theory / Jeson Woo.
Publisher:      1999.
Description:    Book
xii, 280 p. ; 29 cm


The Nyaya school also has some interesting positions on the duration of a
moment.  I don't have specific references at hand, but ch. 3 ("Cognition")
in K.K. Chakrabarti's _CLASSICAL INDIAN PHILOSOPHY OF MIND_  provides good
introductory material, plus a good bibliography.

best,
Tim Cahill
