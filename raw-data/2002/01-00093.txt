Subject: Paa.ninian description of German
Message-ID: <161227070308.23782.9793075863018925970.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

For the Paa.niniiyas among you:
For centuries western scholars and missionaries have
been describing most divergent languages all over the
world in the categories of Latin grammar. What will
happen if we start to describe a European language,
for instance German, "through the eyes" of Paa.nini's
theoretical approach? Will it give new insights on the
structure of German? Does it solve old problems or
does it create (interesting or unnecessary) new ones?
Does it also give new insights on Paa.nini's
theoretical system?

These issues are courageously taken up in a recent
paper by Prof. Peter Raster (Essen). See the *Essener
Linguistische Skripte - elektronisch*, issue of
December 2001:
