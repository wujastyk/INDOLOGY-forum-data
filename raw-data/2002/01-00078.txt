Subject: Is Unicode welcome yet on the list?
Message-ID: <161227070271.23782.3054251390721083061.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List,

since all the major operating systems and email clients have come to
support Unicode by now (even though it might require some
configuration), I was wondering whether its use for sending email
messages with proper diacritics (instead of Harvard-Kyoto
"transliteration") might be welcome on this list, or in other words,
how many of the participants do not yet use software supporting it.
As a test, here's the half-"sloka of my last post in proper Unicode
encoding:

   n?sty udyamasamo bandhu? kurv??o n?vas?dati

I realise that this is a touchy subject, and that some out there even
still continue to write "ae oe ue" for the German umlauts etc., so
please be gentle...

Kind regards,
Stefan Baums
