I have WordPerfect which I prefer for longer texts and had some trouble
with WORD which seems to be primarily made for business correspondence.
Using some other then popular system, I had many problems sending
attachments (which I now open very rarely in any case). It invaded other
parts of my system and wanted me to do things in a different way. I
wouldn't even think of touching PDF unless I knew it was very easy for me
and my system and had no imperialistic leanings.
