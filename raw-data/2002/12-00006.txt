Dear Patrick,
this is the only explanation I have at the moment:

I may have caused this problem by updating the ATIL files several
times from morning to noon. In the process the files are temporarily
unavailable

The "Mahabharata online" opened with a reminder to
1) configure your browser to UTF-8
2) to make sure that you have a UTF-8 font installed on your
computer.

You could then " ... proceed to Mahabharata online" (lower left
corner).

I have now removed this reminder. So you can now directly enter
theMahabharata online.

Please let me know in case the problem persists.


Best regards

Reinhold Gr?nendahl
