Thank you for taking the trouble!

>Should someone need a new Windows font for the old
Norman font (which is also incompatible with modern
Windows; see the read-me-files at John Smith's site),
such a new Norman font could be made too, if needed.

I would like to subscribe to such a font, if possible!

Best regards,
