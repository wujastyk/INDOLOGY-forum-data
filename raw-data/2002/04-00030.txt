>?From the context of the inscription I can say that the term is expressive of
the Makarasam.kraanti. I am just wondering why it is called Dinakshaya. I
think it has nothing to do with the literal meaning of dinakhaya. Could you
tell me what this means in the present context and whether the term is
attested elsewhere or not.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
