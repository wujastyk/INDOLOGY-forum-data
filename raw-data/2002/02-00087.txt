According to the Tamil Lexicon, Tamil Nayanar (cf. Malayam Nairs, Telugu
Naidus, all from nii, "lead"), are "Title of certain castes such as Cainar
(Jains), KaikkooLar, UTaiyar, and a section of VeeLaaLar."  These are all
extremely high castes -- indeed, on the basis of privilege, power, wealth,
and influence (and, often, even education), one could make a persuasive
argument that they are (and always have been) significantly higher than most
Brahmins.  Consulting only Sanskrit texts and speaking only (I stress only)
with Brahmins are activities that are fraught with peril -- they give a very
strange and inaccurate picture of South India (and, I suspect, North India
as well).  It is good to remember that 2-3% of South Indians are Brahmins
and that over 90% of South Indians are non-vegetarians.  Chakravarti is also
a name found among Tamil Brahmins.  George Hart
