I am very happy to have Stefan Baums' list but have a few additions, the
first not exactly responding to the question but worth knowing:

Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle, 1968, The Sound Pattern of English, New York
etc.: Harper & Row, page 435 (the last page of the text), the last rule:

(62)    a > a

(disregarding macrons which I don't have on E-mail)

Finally, I warmly endorse  Stefan Baums' recommendation "to go through the
indices of recent linguistic handbooks" (add: journals).
