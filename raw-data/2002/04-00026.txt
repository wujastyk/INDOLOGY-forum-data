Traditionally the word zariira is derived from the root zRR (which is
listed in the sense of hi.msana "injure", z.r.naati, past pple ziir.na) by
adding an affix  -iiran, cf. the U.naadisuutra 4.30:
kRR-zRR-pRR-ka.ti-pa.ti-zau.ti-bhya.h iiran.  The fact that this is
accounted for by the U.naadisuutra also means that Panini himself
considered this word as an underived nominal.  Yaaska's Nirukta (2.16) also
derives zariira the same way: zariiram z.r.naate.h
