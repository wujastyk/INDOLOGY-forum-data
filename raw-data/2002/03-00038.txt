This may not be a question of "ayurvedic" immunization.
Hugh Richardson (I believe) once wrote on a Qing dynasty smallpox
immunization program in Lhasa, during the late 18th century.
This may well have become known in Nepal.
Some knowledge of Chinese immunization methods may have
also been current in SE Asia, of course.
