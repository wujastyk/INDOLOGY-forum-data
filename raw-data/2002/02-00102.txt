Subject: Kh instead of S in Yajur Veda
Message-ID: <161227070606.23782.16504770768606292473.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Madhav Deshpande mentions in "Genesis of Rgvedic Retroflexion..." that some
branches of Yajur Veda show 'kh' where the retroflex 's' is normally
expected. Where is this found? Is is associated with a particular Shakha or
geographical location? Are there any other aspects of the vedic literature
that show this?
