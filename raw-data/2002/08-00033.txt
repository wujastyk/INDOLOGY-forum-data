Subject: suggestions for a name for a hospital
Message-ID: <161227071309.23782.8033178047898914601.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Friends,

the following was forwarded to me, and I pass it along in the hope that some
of you might have a nice suggestion or two to make. If you have anything to
offer, perhaps the best course is to send your suggestions to me, and then I
will pass them along. By the way, UCSF = University of California at San
Fransisco.

>Hello.Your name was given to me by the Department of Eastern Languages

>I am a producer here at Imaginary Forces; a film,design, animation and
>branding production company in Los Angeles.
>We are involved in a project which I believe to be very special.  We have
>been asked to come up with a name and then a logo for The Palliative Care
>Center (a new care facility) which is a sub-unit in UCSF's Children's
>Hospital.  The palliative care unit is an end of life care unit for
>children, and it supplies physical, emotional and spiritual support to
>children and their families during this very difficult time of the child's
>life.  It is not a hospital with the intention of healing.  More for
>providing care.
>
>This is a project that we are doing pro bono, of course.
>
>The director of the facility would like very much to name it a "cultural"
>(or different than English) name with Sanskrit being a choice language.  We
>would like some choices of words that has to do with:
>
>comforting care, supportive care, compassion, transition with enlightenment
>or enrichment.
>or "Starlight" or "Guiding Star"  (the Sanskrit equivelent, if one
>obviously) could be a nice choice.
>
>I am open to the sensitive and other possibilites.....
>
>It would be titled:
>
>The xxxxxxx  Care Center for Children, or,
>The xxxxxx Center
>A Care Center for Children and Their Families
>
>It would be interesting to find a word which does not have an exact
>translation in English, as I am sure many asian languages provide.
>
>Examples:
>
>Yugen           is a Japanese word that means, evidently, an awareness of
>the universe that triggers feelings too deep and mysterious for words.
>                I like this meaning....   the words  ("The Yugen Children's
>Center" doesn't quite flow however.)
>
>Kiva            is a Native American word for an under ground cermonial
>chamber believed to be an entryway to the spirit world.  (Maybe too serious
>for this kind of center.  Maybe not)
>
>A little bit of whimsy or childlike spirit to it would be great.  Not over
>the top whimsical.
>
>Anyway, I am sure that you can understand what we are trying to find in
>Sanskrit as good possibilities.
>If you could help with some possible words, I / we would be ever so
>grateful.
>
>Thank you so much.  I look forward to hearing from you.
>I know that your time is very valuable and so will understand and
appreciate
>if you are able or not to spend some time on this.
