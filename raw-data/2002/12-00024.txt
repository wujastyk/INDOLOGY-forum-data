A pleasant curiosity I just discovered is that the mosaic "Law"  in the
Congressional Members Room of the Library of Congress is inspired by Sir
William Jones's poem "An Ode in Imitation of Alcaeus." See
http://www.loc.gov/law/public/asl/htdoc/index.html for the mosaic,
the ode, and background information.  A further Indian connection is
that the republican sentiments of the poem delayed his appointment to
the Supreme Court of Bengal.
