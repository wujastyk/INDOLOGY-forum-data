For a paper on the so-called "ten epithets" of the Buddha in
early Chinese translations, I would appreciate hearing whether
any of the list members have ever seen an explanation of the
meaning of this term as "world-honored one" (or anything
close) in any Indian source (not necessarily Buddhist).

with thanks in advance,
Jan Nattier
