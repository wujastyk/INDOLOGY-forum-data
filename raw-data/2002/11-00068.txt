Dear List,

Although Sumit Guha shows no signs of being interested in such things, I
would remind other list members of earlier discussions on this list
concerning these matters.  I recall one that took place in May 1998 or
thereabouts, and which can be tracked down on the list archives under the
subject "Iranians in Ancient India."

If discussion of an Iranian presence in ancient India offends, well, let us
turn instead to a discussion of Indians in ancient Iran.  There is good
evidence for such a presence too, if anyone is interested.  Does this subject
offend anyone?

As for Central Asia in general, there is no question whatsoever that there is
a significant Central Asian substratum present in early Indic and Iranian
languages and cultures.

I am presently working on the very good evidence that suggests that the Vedic
Soma cult has significant roots in some Central Asian substrate language.
The evidence is purely linguistic and philological.  No Jungian Aryanism in
it whatsoever.

This "Iranian heresy" business is NOT an attack on the indigenous origins of
Buddhism by racialist theorists.  To persist in saying so is sheer blindness,
induced by uninformed poltical correctness.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
