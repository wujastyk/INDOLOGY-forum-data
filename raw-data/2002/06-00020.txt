COPAC is a union catalogue for all the major academic / university
libraries in Britain.  It is increasingly becoming a valuable one-stop way
of finding books.  The addition of the BL catalogue projects it into a
very important position.  Apart from anything else, the COPAC interface is
(I think) nicer than the BL's own one.

The British Library Public Catalogue has been loaded onto COPAC,
bringing to 23 the number of catalogues included in the COPAC
database.

Over 10 million British Library records have been loaded, representing
both reference materials held in the London Reading Rooms and document
supply materials held at the Document Supply Centre, Boston Spa.

COPAC is available free of charge to all searchers. COPAC is a MIMAS
