Below are some such.  Many of the old-school generativists (Kiparsky,
Zwicky) had an interest in the "scientific and precise" descriptive
model of Panini's grammar and partially modelled their own theories on
him (rule ordering, etc.), though generative grammar in its G & B
incarnation and subsequently has moved away from that formal
apparatus.  Phonologists were particulary intrigued by the "ruki" rule
(see Zwicky, below) and Grassmann's law (Anderson, Mey, below), which
ran counter to some of their theoretical presuppositions.  A certain
fascination with Sanskrit continues in formal linguistics, so going
through the indices of recent linguistics handbooks and checking for
Sanskrit among the language examples may well be worth your while.
