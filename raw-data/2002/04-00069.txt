It sounded to me like a hymn to the dawn.  I wondered too, why it was there,
and since the credits were in Farsi, I couldn't read anything about the
music.

Indologists,

   There's a Sanskrit verse in Kandahar that gets repeated 2-3 times
in a stylized recitation. Part of it went: "Shri Satya-Sai" and in another
place I had a vague sense of it being from the Gita.  (Didn't stay for the
credits.) If anyone knows what's being recited I'd like to know.

best,
Tim Cahill
