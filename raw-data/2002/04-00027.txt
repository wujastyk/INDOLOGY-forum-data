Your email fault caused all messages from INDOLOGY to your account to
bounce back, creating a problem in Liverpool.  This computer behaviour
(nothing to do with you personally) is tolerated for a limited period by
the software, but after some days the listserv closes your subscription,
since it is the only way to stop a mounting pile of error messages.

Again: it's nothing personal.  Just the INDOLOGY software and its
administrators (Chris Wooff) doing what is, after all, reasonable.

Now that your email system is working normally again, we can reinstate
your membership without any problem.

Best,
Dominik
