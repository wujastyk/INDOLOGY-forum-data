Subject: sharing documents: in praise of PDF
Message-ID: <161227070137.23782.4061970462463872097.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Well, since you ask...
I am a dedicated WordPerfect user who, back in the days of WP5.1
devised a set of overstrike macros to create letters with overdots and
underdots without using a special font.  Despite the wealth of fonts
available today, I have (foolishly?) continued to use this system in
WP7/8, waiting for the day when all Indologists use Unicode based fonts
and I can change over without worrying about portability and conversion
problems.

The PROBLEM is that these overstrike-characters drop out completely
when the document is converted to Word or any other program.  Also, they
seem to be preventing Adobe Acrobat from successfully creating a PDF out
of my WP8 files.  Any time I have tried to run the conversion, it has
failed.  Now I am stuck, because WP's search and replace function cannot
deal with overstrikes individually.  (I cannot speak to how PDF
conversion works from the older WP versions.)

I would fully support the praise of PDF. . . . And since you are
mentioning WordPerfect, which
expecially in its antique versions is fairly wide spread among
Sanskritists, I wonder whether it is as simple for them to produce
pdf-documents.
