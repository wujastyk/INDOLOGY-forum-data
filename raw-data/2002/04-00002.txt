Re:   Resources/Networks of the Harvard Forum for Central Asian Studies


Dear Mr. Dominik Wujastyk:

I outline below a number of information resources and networks which I hope
will be of interest to you.  Central Eurasia is understudied and it is
generally difficult to get good information about the region.  The Harvard
Forum for Central Asian Studies is working on a number of fronts to address
this problem by promoting information exchange and building of the field of
study.  With heightened focus on Afghanistan and the region, now is an
opportune time to bring these resources to wider attention.  Please help to
pass this on to anyone you know who would be interested.

The resources/networks described below include:
  * The Central Eurasian Studies Society
  * The <CentralAsia-L> Announcement List for Central Asian Studies
  * The Central Asia Experts Directory (an on-line resource)
  * Dissertations in Central Asian Studies (on-line)
  * Guide to Scholars of Central Asia (print publication)
  * <Central Asian Studies World Wide>

You are encouraged to visit the web addresses listed below, or to contact
us via e-mail for more information about specific items or to sign up for
any of the resources/networks.

More information about Central Asia/Eurasia is available on the <Central Asian
Studies World Wide> website (http://www.fas.harvard.edu/casww/).  Note that we
use the terms "Central Asia" and "Central Eurasia" in more or less the same
meaning, encompassing a broad region from Mongolia to the Black Sea and
Afghanistan to Siberia.

I write to you because you are in our database as someone with interest
in/commitment to Central Eurasia.  We send a broad mailing such as this about
once a year to provide an update on resources which may interest you.  If your
interest in the region is not sufficient to justify our writing to you, please
let us know and we'll take note accordingly.

Please also let us know if your e-mail address changes so that we can stay in
contact.  If you receive more than one copy of this note from me, please let us
know the duplicate addresses so that we can avoid this in future.

Thank you for your interest!

Sincerely,

John Schoeberlein
