Dear Dominik Wujastyk

I thought your list subscribers might be interested in a new book of mine:
_Indo-European Origins: The Anthropological Evidence_ (Institute for the
Study of Man, Washington, DC, 2001; xxiv + 546 pages; ISBN 0-941694-75-5).
One can order it for $68.00 from http://www.jies.org/DOCS/mono14.html

Prof. Victor Mair, co-author of _The Tarim Mummies_, called it "a truly
remarkable and valuable piece of work". And Prof. Friedrich R?sing, of the
Institut f?r Humangenetik und Anthropologie in Ulm, said: "F?r die ?lteren
bev?lkerungsgeschichtlichen Fragen in Europa is dies eine Scharnierarbeit,
sie teilt in davor und danach, denn sie behandelt nicht nur jene einfache
Grundfragestellung, sondern vieles Weitere."

Based on a doctoral thesis supervised by J. P. Mallory, the book uses
evidence from biological anthropology -- in modern genetic patterns, ancient
skeletal remains, ancient dermatoglyphics, and hints about pigmentation
recorded in ancient texts and artworks -- combined with linguistics and
archaeology to determine where Indo-European originated and how it managed
to spread over much of Eurasia.

As for Indo-Aryan in particular, the most useful sections will be: 5.3.2.2
and 5.4.2.3 about texts describing ancient Indo-Aryans and their deities;
6.3.2 about artworks depicting ancient Indo-Aryans; 8.5.3 about the skeletal
remains of ancient Indo-Aryans; 9.3.9 and 9.3.10 about genetic studies of
modern Asia and India; and 11.7 about the present-day pigmentation of
brahmins in northwest India and several peoples in the Hindu Kush (pages
348-50).

With best wishes,

John V. Day
