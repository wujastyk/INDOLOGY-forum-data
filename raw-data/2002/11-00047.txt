Refer to
Peter Harvey, An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and
Issues. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. Chapter four
provides considerable information on issues relating to pest
control and other matters concerning our treatment of animals.
The most useful feature of Harvey's work is his extensive
documentation of the manner in which normative directives
are actually interpreted in practice in a great many Buddhist
societies.
