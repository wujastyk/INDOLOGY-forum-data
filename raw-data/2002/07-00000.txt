The Kern Institute Library (Leiden University)

The library of the Kern Institute provides access to academic
literature related to the languages and cultures of South and Central
Asia for teaching and research. Apart from an extensive and
internationally unique collection of books and magazines, the library
possesses a number of special collections.
One of these is the collection of Tibetan block prints and
manuscripts (numbering some 1756 items) that was assembled by Johan
van Manen between 1916 and 1943 when he was residing in Calcutta.
Under the Metamorfoze scheme, the national programme for the
conservation of library material, this collection, including the
archives belonging to it, will be completely set on film, described
and repacked.

To carry out this project, we are looking for a
