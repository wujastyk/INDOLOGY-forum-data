Dear George,

I'm finishing editing an essay of Norman's for publication, and I
would be extremely grateful for your help.

He cites the following verses from Purattirattu, using the
Ilankumaran edition of 1972. If you've got that edition handy, can
you kindly provide me with the actual pages numbers of the following
verses:

15-18

259-62

and two verses from the Civakacintamani, 1235 and 2765, that are
cited in the Purattirattu.

I hope that makes sense.

Many many thanks in advance.
