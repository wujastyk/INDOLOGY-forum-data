Subject: eye (gaze) in the Katha Upanishad

Apologies to the list for my stupidity.   I had somehow got the erroneous
idea that this sutra was written much later in E Asia.  The internet never
fails to amaze--i just found this URL containing Burton Watson's edition of
the LS and am proceeding to study it.
