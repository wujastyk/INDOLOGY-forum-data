I have to agree.  could the principles in the discussion put together
a position presentation (very short) and let us see where it goes.

I for, one have no biases in either direction, it more a matter of
timing and historical context for me.

If we push the veil of history back far enough, we'll get back to the
African eve problem, and I do not think that is the point or the
purpose, rather closer ties would seem more appropriate.

What about the later phases of Iranian influence for example in
Kushan and post-Kushan thinking?
