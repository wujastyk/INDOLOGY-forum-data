Subject: Insects in Buddhism
Message-ID: <161227071680.23782.11889683826654492236.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Netters,

a colleague of mine, who is not a member of Indology, has approached me

with a query regarding the approach of Buddhism towards insects, vermin
etc.

- apart from, and in addition to the general notion of "abandonment of
harm to sentient beings". He has in mind such instances as using
insecticides against vermin

destroying people<fontfamily><param>Tahoma</param>'</fontfamily>s crops
or killing "noxious" insects such as wasps or hornets

endangering human life, or farmers inadvertently killing dew-worms.

Are there any specific textual references to insects you may be aware
of?

In appreciation of your metta and karuna,

Jan Filipsky
