Friends:

I have a question about a reading in Manu 11.58 (or 57 in some
editions). All editions read the paada-a as: retaHsekaH svayoniiSu.
This is, of course, the grammatically correct reading. But most of my
manuscripts -- especially the important southern manuscripts in
Grantha, Telugu, and Malayalam scripts -- read svayonyaasu [sometimes
svayonaasu]. Can you account for the form -yonyaasu? Have you seen it
elsewhere? It is not recorded in the dictionaries. Thanks for your
help.
