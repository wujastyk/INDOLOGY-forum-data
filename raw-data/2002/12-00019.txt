Subject: ConTeXt support for UTF-8 Roman Translit and Nagari

Dear All,

I am not sure how many subscribers to INDOLOGY use ConTeXt, although
it seems that a number use TeX and LaTeX. It seems to me that ConTeXt
may be useful, especially if it can be successfully configured to
support UTF-8 encodings for Skt. in Roman translit. and Nagari. Over
the past two weeks progress has been made in this direction. These
developments can be followed through the ConTeXt mailing list:

Of note is a recent posting from Hans Hagen:
