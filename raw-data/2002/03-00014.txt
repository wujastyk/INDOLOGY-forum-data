Dear,

The rules for peculiar pronunciation of particular var.nas (y, r(esp.
repha), l, v, .r, .l and .s) in the Maadhyandina branch of Yajurveda can be
found in the Pratij~naapari"si.s.ta also known as Pratij~naasuutra ascribed
to Katyayana. There are some conditions, of following or preceding var.na,
to have such a change in original pronunciation.
But I wonder, there is no rule of pronouncing j~n as dny which also is in
current practice.

In the case of .s, the rule is: atho muurdhanyo.sma.no .asa.myuktasya .tum
.rte sa.myuktasya ca khakaaroccaara.nam. 2.7

Best wishes,
