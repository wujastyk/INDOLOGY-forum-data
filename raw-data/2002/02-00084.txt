SUMMER SCHOOL IN SPOKEN SANSKRIT 2002

The Department of Classical Indology offers you this unique opportunity to participate in a spoken Sanskrit course this summer under the tutelage of a Sanskrit native speaker. It is the aim of the course to enable students, particularly those pursuing Indological Studies, to overcome the perception of Sanskrit as a written language alone and, instead, to learn to pronounce, speak and recite it. The four-week course will make the study of Sanskrit a playful experience and demystify it.
