Research Assistant

A research assistant is required for six months to assist Dr
Dominik Wujastyk with a project on the history of medicine in
India on the eve of colonialism, 1550-1750.  The project aims to
systematically collect prosopographical information on medical
authors and practitioners of the period, their works, and the
surviving manuscripts of these works.  It also aims to discover as
much as is possible about centres of medical excellence and
education during the period, as well as revealing professional and
scholarly networks of activity amongst pre-colonial Sanskrit
intellectuals and medical practitioners.

The successful applicant will be expected to provide general
research assistance on the project.  This is likely to include
normal office work, as well as entering data into a database,
clarifying issues of authorship and identity of pre-modern medical
authors and practitioners,  and providing summaries of research
publications and of selected Sanskrit works on ayurveda and
related subjects.

Applicants should have a good command of the Sanskrit language to
at least BA level, and some familiarity with the history of
Sanskrit literature.  Familiarity with other Indian languages
would be an advantage.  Applicants should also be familiar with
computer skills such as word processing, email, databases and data
entry, and be willing to take the European Computer Driving
License if deemed necessary.  A knowledge of TeX would be an
advantage.

Applicants must be citizens of the European union, or be eligible
to obtain a full UK work permit.  The position is available
immediately.

The salary will be pro-rata to the annual salary range of ?18,655
to ?21,503 plus ?2134 London weighting.

To apply, please send or email your CV and the contact details of
at least two academic referees to Mr Alan Shiel, Wellcome Centre
for the History of Medicine at UCL, 24 Eversholt Street, London
NW1 1AD, UK.  For further details, please send email to
a.shiel at ucl.ac.uk.

The closing date for applications is 17 May 2002.
