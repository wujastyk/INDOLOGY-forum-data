Dear Yves,

Your Dutavakya encoding using Unicode Devanagari is truly remarkable.
I've uploaded it to

  http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/bhasa/

and also as an ftp-able file from the INDOLOGY ftp archive, as
bhasa-dutavakya.zip (including all the TEI files).

When I view the xml file with MS IE 6, the conjunct consonants don't work
properly.  When I use Opera 6.01, everything looks very fine (and
different font).

This is a pathbreaking piece of encoding.  Thank you very much indeed.
