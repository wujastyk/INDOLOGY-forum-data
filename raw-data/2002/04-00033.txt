Well, I've got the Arial Unicode, but not XP or Office.  Apparently Opera
6.1 has the necessary glyph rendering built into it.  (It appears to be
better than IE 6 at handling XML in other respects too; and there's a
Linux version.)  That explains why things look wrong with IE but right
with Opera, on my workstation.
