There has been some discussion in the past about ideal formats for e-texts
of works in verse, but has there been discussion about formats for prose
works?  When the prose is not a commentary on a verse or suutra text (in
which case the verses or suutras themselves often create conveniently
numberable paragraphs), what are good ways of providing clear referencing
that is visible for every screenful of text?  E-texts which indicate page
and line numbers of a well-known edition break up the sentences
arbitrarily.  And how and where to present variants?
