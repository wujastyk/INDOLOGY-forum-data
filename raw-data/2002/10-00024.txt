For a Buddhological study of the subject as discussed in an
important text of traditional philosophy, see
Katsumi Mimaki, La refutation bouddhique de la permanence des choses
(Paris: de Boccard, 1976).

For interpretations on the part of contemporary cognitive scientists
who are interested in meditation and the like, try
Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, The Embodied Mind (MIT 1992)
