Dear Reinhold:

I must be doing something wrong, but access to the site with ATIL was
denied to me. When I did try to download the MBh it wanted me to
download also the font which appeared as HELVSN---1.TTF; but on my
Word it did not show up as a font even after restarting the computer.
I am on a MAC with OS 9.2. Thanks.

>ATIL encompasses the entire range of CSX+ (Classical Sanskrit
