If anyone would be interested in a 19th century book on Buddhism
which has turned up second-hand, please would they contact me
off-list?  The book is:

  J. Barth?lemy Saint-Hilaire, trans. Laura Ensor, The Buddha and His
Religion, George Routledge and Sons, n.d. (The original text seems to
date from around 1860.)  It's in very good condition, and comes with
a special bonus offer for Buddhists--a test for your equanimity.
