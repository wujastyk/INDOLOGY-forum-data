Subject: demonology and Indian medicine
Message-ID: <161227071202.23782.138719496769417023.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have a patron who is interested in the role of demonic forces in
traditional Indian medicine, as background for their role in Tibetan
medicine.  I have referred her to the Kumaratantra and vernacular works
on demons as they affect children.  My library's copy of Meulenbeld's
History of Indian medical literature is unavailable in processing.
Could someone give some references on the subject?  The patron knows
English, Russian, Tibetan, and Mongolian.

Thanks,

Allen
