Subject: Which number the naada indicates?
Message-ID: <161227071069.23782.4068800597394527621.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have had a quick look through the two most comprehensive lists of
chronogram words, namely:

    D.C. Sircar, Indian Epigraphy, pp. 230-3
    P.V. Kane, History of Dharmasastra, vol.V.1, pp.702-3.

I didn't find any listing for either naada or s'abda, so I think taking
naada as = svara = 7 is the safest. But please check these lists (and also
the one in Buhler's Indian Paleography) more carefully than I did before
reaching a final conclusion!
