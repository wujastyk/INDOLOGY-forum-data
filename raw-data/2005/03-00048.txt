Subject: Nakula's Shield
Message-ID: <161227076043.23782.14033965866685577593.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In MBh 2((28)66.14 Nakula is said to take up his sword and shield with the
eight moons. A seemingly identical shield is found in the Dev&#299; M&#257;h&#257;tmya 9:12
Ni&#347;umbha is found to wield an identical shield. Is there a connection
between the two sets of twins?

Thank you in advance.
