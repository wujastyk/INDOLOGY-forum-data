Dear List Members,

Does anyone of you know when exactly and where the present transcription of
Sanskrit was introduced - to be uniformly used by indologists all over?
That with macrons over vovels, dots under to mark retroflexes, acute over s
to make it denote palatal sibilant, small circle under sonantal l and r.
Etc. I kind of remember that it was done at some International Congress -
in Paris?

Your help will be greatly appreciated.
