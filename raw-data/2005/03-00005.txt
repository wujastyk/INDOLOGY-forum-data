Subject: EJVS 12-1: Vala and Iwato.  (Compar. myth. in India/Japan/Beyond)
Message-ID: <161227076041.23782.16153982042134042682.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies is now beginning its 11th year
(after completing 10 vols. and one special volume on Soma).

We now start off with vol. 12, issue 1 (March 1, 2005), 1-69,
containing a longish paper on comparative mythology:

"Vala and Iwato. The Myth of the Hidden Sun in India, Japan, and
beyond."

Similarities and congruences across Eurasia and the Americas (Laurasia)
are investigated, and a scenario is proposed for the surprisingly close
relationship between the Vedic and Old Japanese versions, both in myth
and ritual.
