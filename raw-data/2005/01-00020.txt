> I was wondering whether anyone has access to issues from the
> 1960s of the Hindi journal "Sarasvati", which is most likely
> ISSN 05586496, published in Ilahabada, by Indiyana Presa
> (Pablikesana) Praiveta Limiteda, 1900-1980 (information from COPAC).
>
> Specifically, I am trying to locate a series of 14 articles
> written by the photographer Fany/Feni Mukherjee (also known
> as Pheni Moukherji, and in various other orthographic
> disguises) who accompanied Rahula Sankrtyayana to Tibet in
> 1938. This series of travel reports has the title "Rahulji ke
> sath Tibbat ke abhiyan mem". Unfortunately I don't know
> exactly which volumes of Sarasvati contain them; all I know
> is that the issues of June, October, November and December
> 1963, as well as January, February and July 1964 contain some.
>
> COPAC records the following holdings for the British library:
>
> "St. Pancras Reading Rooms ; HIN ST 2 OIOC //
> Holdings: 11, no.10 (1967/Oct. 1910)-82 (2037/1980). Incomplete"
>
> If anyone with access to the British library (who
> coincidentally happens to go there sometime during the next
> weeks ...) could check which of the issues mentioned above
> are there, and how complete the library's 1960s holdings are,
> or if anyone has information about other libraries that may
> have this journal, or knows whether Mukherjee's reports have
> been published in any other form - well, for any help that
> gets me closer to digital or paper copies of these articles,
> I would be very grateful.
