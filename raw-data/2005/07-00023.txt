I am curious about this, since it had been my impression that it was 
not easy to produce paper in Tibet itself, and I had been told--but 
maybe this refers only to a more modern period--that if one wanted a 
book printed, one had to provide one's own paper, and then of course 
pay for printing (donations, tea, etc.).  Was there paper production 
in Tibet proper in historical periods?
