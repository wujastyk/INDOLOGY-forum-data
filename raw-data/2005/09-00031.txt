Dear List,

I am forwarding a request for information from Victor Mair, a Sinologist 
at the Univ. of Pennsylvania.  I will forward any responses to him, but 
if anyone wishes to respond to him directly, he would be grateful:

vmair at sas.upenn.edu

Thanks in advance from Victor and from me.

Dear Colleagues,

Are any of you familiar with the famous works of Indian story-literature
that are listed below?  A friend of mine has discovered a Chinese story
from the mid-9th c. that is an exact mirror of a story found in
Somadeva's (--> Raaja"sekharasuuri's [?]) collection and in the
Kathaako"sa.  She is particularly interested in finding out as much as
she can about the Tamil collection of stories, but she would welcome
information about any of the other collections as well.

Best,

Victor

[diacriticals omitted; sorry for any other errors; the list is copied
from my friend's message -- she is a Sinologist, not an Indologist; I've
made a couple of corrections and notations in brackets, but they are by
no means complete]

Brhatkathasaritsagara by Kashmiri Somadeva (1030 CE)
