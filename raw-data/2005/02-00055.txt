Subject: elves = siddhas?
Message-ID: <161227075922.23782.2450927980916261104.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Videhins are siddhas devoid of their gross material body and possessing
extraordinary powers due to their meditative absorption into the subtle
causal energies (indriyas, or noetic grahaNa) of the external sense organs.
Their body is called _causal_ because the _subtle_ is the cause for the
_gross_. Yet they are human beings, evolutionary degraded, just like the
elves, but still humans whose only soteriological duty is to perform
_asaMprjJAta-samAdhi_.
