Many thanks to Madhav and David.  This is the article that I need to 
cite.  Madhav, would you please forward the page numbers from that 
publication when you have the time?  What is of interest in this article 
is that it claims that the Babylonian god Tiamat is referred to at AVZ 
5.13.4 with the word *taimAta'*, apparently a water-snake of some sort.  
The article also claims that the Babylonian goddess Apsu  is referred to 
in a number of Vedic apsu-compounds.

As it turns out, an intrepid comparatist has recently used these, um, 
fanciful etymologies to support his claim that there was  a significant 
diffusion channel connecting Babylonian mythology not only to the Indus 
Valley Culture, but also to Vedic.  My article attempts to debunk this 
silliness.

Also, another curiosity in this AVZ hymn: the presence of the obscure 
term *tAbu'va* at AVZ 5.13.10, which seems to refer to another snake, or 
a snake-demon, or snake-poison.  Nevertheless, it used to be suggested 
that it is a certain Polynesian word, which has surfaced in English as 
"taboo." 

Human imagination is a marvelous thing!

Thanks again to David and Madhav,

George

If you need, I can give page numbers from this publication.
