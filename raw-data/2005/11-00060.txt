Update #3 - Current version re-released under the SIL Open Font License

Dear friends of Gentium,

We're thrilled to announce that we have re-released Gentium under a
free/open-source license - the SIL Open Font License (OFL). This will give
much greater freedom to everyone using the fonts, and allow for easier
inclusion in free, open-source and commercial software packages.

The only changes we've made in addition to the licensing change were a
couple of bug fixes releated to PostScript glyph names and to the reported
italic angle.

All of this can be found at

      http://scripts.sil.org/gentium

We know that many of you have been waiting for eons for Bold and Bold
Italic, more ancient Greek letters (like the digamma), etc. We have been
working on these (very sporadically) over the last couple of years, but
they're not ready yet. We hope to have a greatly improved set of Regular and
Italic out mid next year, and then work on completing the additional
weights.

In the meantime, if the lack of one letter is hindering you, the OFL now
gives you the freedom to change the fonts, and even distribute modified
versions - with some conditions. We also warmly welcome your submissions of
work to be included in the main Gentium project. See the Status page on the
web site for details.

Thanks for your continued interest in Gentium.
