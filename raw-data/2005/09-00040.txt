Subject: question about gender of two names

Kavita Krishnakumar Pandit

Kavita is Female. In Gujarat, women write their husband's first name after 
their personal name and before their last name or surname. So it becomes 
like a middle name. To me it looks like Krishnakumar is Kavita's husband's 
name. Mostly men write their father's first name as their middle name in 
Gujarat and some parts of Maharashtra. I am not sure if in other parts of 
India also this practice is prevalent.

In Rajasthan, Tilak would be a man's name. Tilak even in the sense of 
ornament would be masculine.

Hope this helps.
