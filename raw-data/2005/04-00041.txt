Dear members,

following this thread I take the advantage to ask a side question, namely if
anybody is familiar with the term "saMsarga" applied to the body?

I assume this usage in the SatyazAsanaparIkSA of the Jaina VidyAnandin which
in the context of the discussion of NyAya-VaizeSika hands down a verse where
saMsarga is counted as an element of the 21-fold duHkha:
saMsargau sukhaduHkhe ca tathArthendriyabuddhayaH |
pratyekaM SaDvidhAz ceti duHkhasaMkhyaikaviMzatiH || (Edition of Calcutta
1964)
