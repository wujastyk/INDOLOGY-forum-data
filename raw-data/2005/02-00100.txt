Subject: conference on orality-literacy scholar Walter Ong
Message-ID: <161227076025.23782.4217862584274011486.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Some might find the forwarded message of interest.  In my opinion Ong is
right up there with Lord, Havelock, Goody, et al in dealing with these
issues, but I see him mentioned less often than I would expect.
