The verse quarter (harer naamaani kevalam) is found in the Venkatesvara 
edition of the Vi.s.nupuraa.na, but alas it does not form part of the 
"sloka at issue:

yaj~ne"saacyuta govinda maadhavaananta ke"sava |
k.r.s.na vi.s.no h.r.siike"sa vaasudeva namo stu te || ViP_2,13.9||
iti raajaaha bharato harer naamaani kevalam |

The paada is absent in the text constituted in the critical edition 
from Baroda:

yaj~ne"saacyuta govinda maadhavaananta ke"sava|
k.r.s.na vi.s.no h.r.siike"sety aaha raajaa sa kevalam || ViP 2,13.9||
