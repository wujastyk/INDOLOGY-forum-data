Subject: bibliography for Indian numerals
Message-ID: <161227076632.23782.5521820416304203018.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Stephen Chrisomalis has posted on his website on word oddities, the Phrontistery, a working bibliography for his doctoral dissertation, The Comparative History of Numerical Notation (McGill, 2003).

The URL is <http://phrontistery.info/nnsbib.html>. 

There are numerous articles on Indian numerals included.  I have quickly scanned the list and haven't noticed any articles specifically on the number-word systems, or any titles that aren't in the usual bibliographies, but there are over a thousand titles in the list and it needs a closer look.
