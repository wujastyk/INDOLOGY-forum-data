Subject: metre of MMK
Message-ID: <161227076196.23782.15468282499208238852.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am wondering if anyone has run a metrical analysis of Nagarjuna's
MMK. I know there were at some point programs around which could
produce automated analyses of metre, but I'm a computer illiterate,
and in any event, I think those programs never ran on Macs anyway.
But any pointers would be most appreciated.


thanks so much, JAS
