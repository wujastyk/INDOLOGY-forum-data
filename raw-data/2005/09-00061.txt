>>Dear list members,
>>
>>Here's a quotation from the new book _Oak:  The Frame
>>of Civilization_, by William Bryant Logan, Norton, 2005,
>>page 24:
>>
>>'The name of the historic Buddha, Shakyamuni, means
>>"the sage of the oak tree people".'
>>
>>This surprised me, and I haven't been able to find any
>>corroboration on the internet or in my library.  I'm not
>>an expert on Pali or Sanskrit, so I can't judge the
>>accuracy of this statement.  The book is not a scholarly
>>volume, so there aren't footnotes  -- otherwise I'd just
>>look at his references and I might have my answer already.
>>
>>Was the Shakya tribe/clan really named after oak trees?
>>
>>Sincerely,
>>
>>Greg Bungo
