One can see the depiction of Kumarila sitting in a self-sacrifice fire in the Sanskrit-language movie on Sankara's life that is now available in a DVD format.

Dear friends,

Does anyone know of there being any notice or surviving 
examples of representations of Kumaarila, whether sculptural 
or otherwise?

Thanks in advance,

Whitney
