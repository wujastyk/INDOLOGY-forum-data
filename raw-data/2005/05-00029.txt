The thread began with this enquiry, but took off in various
directions afterwards:

Allen found out afterwards that there was already a Thai translation
of the whole of The Lord of the Rings in existence, but I don't think

Whatever may be the situation elsewhere, in Tolkien's works Elves and
Dwarves are quite distinct beings.
