By the term "Indian iconography" do you mean "Hindu
iconography"?
As far as the Hindu iconography is concerned, Hindu
gods such as Lakshmi and Surya were depicted, in a way
known from later times, already on the Buddhist stupa
of Bharhut (2nd BC) and on the stupa railings in
Sanchi. For a quick look, see Harle: The art and
architecture of the Indian subcontinent (p.26ff).
