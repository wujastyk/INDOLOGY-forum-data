His renown likely wouldn't have been as great if he actually settled in
the States, and less if he took out citizenship.  We may be arrogant in
foreign policy, but there is still the cultural cringe.  ;>)

So likewise perhaps it was better to remain an Indian.  Double ;>)

In response to Jonathan Silk's comment:
if an Indian travelled, was he thereby no longer
Indian "as such"?

JayAnanda's comm. was likely composed in Xixia,
according to the colophon, but the author was
a visiting professor from abroad.

One wonders: was Foucault no longer French "as such"
when he lectured in the States?
