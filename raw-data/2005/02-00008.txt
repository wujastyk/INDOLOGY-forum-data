Al,

I'd recommend you check out Aksharamala, which I have found to be
quite a good program, fully compatible with MSWord 2000+.  See:

http://www.aksharamala.com

Cost is reasonable (about $40), and they provide prompt and helpful
tech support by email if you should need it.  Also handles most other
Indian languages.
