For the association of the Shakyas (zAkya) with the Shaka (zAka)  
tree, there is a canonical source in dIghanikAya 3.1.16 (ambaTTha  
sutta). In the Pali episode -- basically the same one the  
Saundarananda refers to -- the sakya princes, sons of ukkAka  
(=ikSvAku), are said to take their dwelling in a sAka grove, thence  
the name. The same texts also says that they are living with their  
sisters, "sakAhi bhagInihi", so as not to spoil their race. This  
would suggest a multiple pseudo-etymology.
