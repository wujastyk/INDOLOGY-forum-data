Is it sure that the "sisters" in question were sisters of the same lineal 
descent as the brothers? The term "sister" is sometimes not very precise 
when translating local kinships. I note from J. Silk's message that there 
must be a term for "full sisters" and "agnatic half-sisters" ....these 
latter could be daughters of a different mother same father;  or, father's 
brother's daughters would be agnatic sisters (parallel cousins). Northern 
Indian kinship forbids consanguineal marriage within 7 generations on the 
male side and 5 on the female side. But an article from The Hindu asserts 
that

"Buddhism allows first cousin marriages..." although which first cousins is 
not specified.(

)

I ask because there are and were kinship systems in India where uncles 
married their own sister's daughters (several Brahmin castes in south 
India), -- a way of sort of "marrying a sister" without doing it -- or their 
mother's brother's (maternal uncle's) daughters (cross-cousins. Parallel 
cousin spouses among Hindus are usually if not entirely taboo. These of 
course would not be referred to as agnatic.) Nur Yalman among others has 
written a lot on these preferential marriage choices. Granted, the ones he 
studied were not from northern India. However, the presence of some types of 
"sister-marriage"  in the hills is conceivable.
