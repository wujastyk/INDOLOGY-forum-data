Thank you, Peter.  That's very useful.  That's the bit of the journal 
that's missing in the Cambridge Univ. Library set.  So there's only a very 
brief mention there, and this would seem not to be what Raghavan is 
referring to, which sounds longer.  I'll see if I can get hold of the 
Sahityaratnakara.

Many thanks again,
Dominik
