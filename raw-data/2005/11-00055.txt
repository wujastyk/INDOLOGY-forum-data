Dear Indologists,

The next to last issue of Frontline, which I only got around to  
reading last night, contains a review which will be of interest to  
many of us: the review is accessible online at <http:// 
www.flonnet.com/fl2223/stories/20051118000607600.htm>, and deals with  
a CD-ROM edition of the original Epigraphia Carnatica with  
Supplements and a new Index. Curiously, the review does not indicate  
where this CD-ROM can be obtained, and at what price --- the review  
only makes clear the CD-ROM has been brought out by the Southern  
Regional Centre (Bangalore) of the Indian Council of Historical  
Research (ICHR), and is the brainchild of Prof. S. Settar. It would  
seem to be a potentially very important research tool.

Would those who have more information on this CD-ROM (the quality of  
the data entry, and how the thing can be obtained) please come forward?

By the way, other issues of Frontline in recent months have also  
brought items on new, post-Tsunami discoveries on the shore at  
Mahabalipuram, and new discoveries of supposedly ancient Tamil Brahmi  
inscriptions/ostraca from other sites (if I remember well). Has  
anybody outside of the ASI seen and evaluated these discoveries?

With thanks in advance,

Arlo Griffiths
