Subject: conjunct characters in devanagari
Message-ID: <161227076389.23782.3404770123752801448.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I had forgotten about Ulrich Stein's remarkable conjunct list in his Itrans manual.  Thanks for the reminder.  

Incidentally, has anyone else worked with Mueller's "Sanskrit Grammar for Beginners"?  Are there known defects?  I find it a fascinating work (though decidedly not for "beginners"--at least not in this century).

  About a year ago there was a thread on this very topic that led to a

  Does anyone have a saved record of it?
