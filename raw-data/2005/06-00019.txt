Dear Whitney-ji and all interested,

I don't remember that fragment in Nehru's Discovery. But I do 
remember  ajja/jje used in Epigraphia Indica as honorific particle AFTER 
the names of donors. Makes better sense than "may-you-live". Now, in 
Sanskrit drama Arya is used often, exactly in the contexts where one expect 
modern jI. "Arya tathA" sounds quite familiar. And it makes, decidedly, 
better sense considering social realities.
