True. And the fonts are not correctly set in the CSS. When you start the
font sequence with Code2000 or Gandhari, everything is OK - all diacritics
is there. The problem is that these are not fonts to be used by aesthetic
grinders. :-)

I am looking for Verdana. If not present, probably it would not be a problem
to extend it fontographically.

Best,
