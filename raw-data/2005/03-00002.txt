Dear Srivar,
I am happy that you liked the quotation of my kaavya.The reference deals with the tortise meditataion.
It is published from Chaukhamba Sanskrit Prakashan, Delhi. If you send me your mailing address, I will ask them to send you a complementary copy.By the way I have recently published "Upaasanaa-citaamani" in eight parts It is 4000 pages. It is on meditation.
With kind regards,

Yes. In BhAgavata-purANam as I remember, it is said that tortoise will rear their young by simply thinkig about them. The verse reads as "apatyamiva kUrmANAm.....". I will locate the exact verse and let you know in one or two days.

with regards,
srivara.

Does anyone know where and when the view was first expressed (in India)
that certain species rear their young simply by looking at or thinking
about them? And are there different versions of this idea? All suggestions
for sources are welcome.

Thanks in advance,
