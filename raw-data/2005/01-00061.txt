Subject: Diacritics in MMK, attn R. Mahoney

Dear Richard,

I see less than half of the diacritics in the online UTF-8 rendering of MMK
http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/mmk_text/mmk_01_utf8.html

Correctly represented are only:
long vowels
circumflex vowels
palatal n and s

all the rest is replaced by squares

I am using Code2000 and it seems to have problems with all utf-8 pages containing Dev. transliteration. PC, Windows 98

Any suggestions or known solutions to this issue would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
Plamen
