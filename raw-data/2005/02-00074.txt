I myself am very sceptical about the identification of 'elf' and 'r.bhu'.
Beyond their obscurity, there is nothing "elvish' about the Rbhus.  In the
RV they are 'divine artisans', which amounts to saying that they are able to
create merely by speaking: "'let there be light', and there was light", as
it were.

They also have nothing to to with Orpheus, as far as I can tell.

Joel Brereton was presented a few papers on the Rbhus in recent years, but I
don't know whether he has published them yet.

Hillebrandt's discussion remains persuasive to me.

Best wishes,

George Thompson

It should be noted here that a Indo-European lexico-mythological
correspondance between the Germanic *alf (? cf. also Gand?lfr, name of a
king in the V?lusp? - I found that in Simek's Lexikon der germanischen
Mythologie, with bibliography  - so even the Tolkienian wizards could be
seen as "cousins" with the elves and dwarves), on the one hand,
and the Vedic  .rbhu, on the other hand,  was established by Adalbert Kuhn
already in 1855 (KZ 4, 103-20, p.113, cf. Wackernagel, KZ 24, p. 297,
Brugmann, Gundriss vol. 2, p. 298), followed by H. Oldenberg (Die Religion
des Veda, Berlin, 1894, pp. 64, 238, 452, 454), A.A. Macdonell (Vedic
Mythology, Strassburg, 1897, p. 133-34) and, more recently, J. Haudry, but
rejected by A. Bergaigne (La religion v?dique, Paris, 1897, vol. 2, pp.
407-8), Alfred Hillebrandt (Vedische Mythologie, second revised edition
Breslau 1927-29, English translation Motilal, vol. 2, p. 87-88),
and on linguistic ground not accepted by M. Mayrhofer.
