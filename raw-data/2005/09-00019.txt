it is from the unpublished Jaiminiiyasa.mhitaa of the Brahmaa.n.dapuraa.na,
a south-western "kaavya-kathaa" puraa.na from about 1150-1350 AD (contra my
first attempt of dating in Proceedings of the DICSEP2, 2002), in the story
of the conflict between the Hehayas and the Kosalas, an episode happening
at the svaya.mvara of the daughter of the king of Videhas:

Thank you for the reference. I was also now thinking about the drama
Kamaliniiraajaha.msa by Puur.nasarasvatii (active in Kerala in the
beginning of the 14th century), which describes the love between the king
of swans and a lotus flower of the Pampaa lake and in which the hero's
rival is an elephant chief of the Vindhya mountain - however, here the
furious elephant is stopped before being in position to abduct the flower.

Of course that could be well simply mean that, and the qualification of the
gaja as raaj is justified by the play with the word  raajaku?jara of the
following verse.
(in a previous /sikhari.nii verse, the princess was already presented:
dvipAnAM mattAnAM mukham abhi madAndheva kariNI
I shall thus try to find poetic examples for the image of the elephant
pulling up lotus flowers.

Thank you.
