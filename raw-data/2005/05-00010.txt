Subject: conjunct characters in devanagari
Message-ID: <161227076375.23782.16140899429870708075.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Max Mueller lists 248 conjunct characters in his Sanskrit grammar.  Macdonell repeats the same list; a similar list (though with some slight differences) appears in Deshpande's Primer.  Is there a standard list?  If there is, does anyone know sources that discuss its history?

Thanks,
