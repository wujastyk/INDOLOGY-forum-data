Subject: arsenic-treated traditional papers available?
Message-ID: <161227076561.23782.3791325221091138171.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Does anyone know if the yellow papers traditionally used in Bengal, Assam, and Tibet against insects are still produced, and if so, how to contact the firms?  Our Conservation department is interested in studying the ones in our manuscripts, and I'd like to get some fresh samples.

I will of course consult the several recent books on traditional South Asian papers, and the magazines on the subject.

Thanks,

Allen
