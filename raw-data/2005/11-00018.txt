caa of bhuutalecaa may be just an error of vaa. And bhuutale vaa may be
a scribe's marginal note that has entered into the text.
In that case, the original quotation would be

kalau tri.m"sasahasraa.ni vi.s.nus ti.s.thati mediniim|. (I follow Somdev's 
tri.m"sa.)

The accusative mediniim appears to be used instead of medinyaam by metrical 
reason.
This usage of accusative for locative is often found in regard to words of time.
But I wonder whether this is possible for words of place.

I also wonder what this half-"sloka means---what a manifestation of Vi.s.nu
stays on earth for thirty thousand years? Arlo, is there any hint in the 
immediate context?
