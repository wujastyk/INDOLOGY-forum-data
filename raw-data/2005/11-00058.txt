Subject: How to change subscription options

Many thanks to Birgit Kellner, Valerie J.Roebuck and Eliot N.Stern for 
their suggestions.
As Birgit and Eliot suggested, I used (once more) the "Quick link to 
add/remove/modify a subscription...".
It proved to be a blind alley. I was asked to confirm my wish to change 
the address by sending them a command
with a certain code number which had been given to me in the same 
latter. I did it, and then recieved  a note saying that
the code number was wrong. It was not.
I had the same results when I tried to do this  before I sent my quiery 
to the list.
Now I can only follow the way suggested by Valerie: to unsubscribe and 
then ask one of the commettee members to subscribe me.
Thank you very much again for your readiness to help.
Yaroslav
