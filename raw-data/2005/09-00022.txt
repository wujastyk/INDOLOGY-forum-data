Thank you very much, that is nice, and Vallabhadeva ad loc. (v. 75 ed.
Murti/Janert) identifies the suragaja with Airaava.na, viz. the "royal"
elephant of Indra:

suragaja airaava.no vi.saa.nadh.rtaa.m naliniim udvahan yathaa
pratipathagatir bhavaty evam adriraajo'bhuut

P.S. read g.rhiitvaa in the extract I gave in my previous mail
