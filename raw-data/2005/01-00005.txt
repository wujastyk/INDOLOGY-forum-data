Dear Birgit,
Sarasvati is held by several libraries in the United States. The issues
from 1900-1957 are also available on microfiche at Library of Congress and
Center for Research Libraries. The paper copies of some of the issues are
available at:
Location  Library                      Code
NY        COLUMBIA UNIV                 ZCU
NY        CORNELL UNIV                  COO
CA        UNIV OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY  CUY

HI        UNIV OF HAWAII AT MANOA       HUH

IL        CENTER FOR RES LIBR           CRL
IL        UNIV OF CHICAGO               CGU

MI        UNIV OF MICHIGAN LIBR         EYM

NC        DUKE UNIV LIBR                NDD

TX        UNIV OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN       IXA

WI        UNIV OF WISCONSIN, MADISON    GZM

Aftre searching the catalogues of these libraries, I have come to a
conclusion that Cornell University and Univ. of Chicago have paper holdings
of the issues you are looking for. Some other libraries may also have them
but their opac doesn't give details of their holdings.

If you are looking for Rahulji's travel to Tibet, you may find some
information in the following book:

Esiya ke durgama bhukhandom mem
/ Rahula Sankrtyayana.  Nai Dilli : Bharatiya Prakasana Samsthana, 1995.

Thanks,
Bindu
