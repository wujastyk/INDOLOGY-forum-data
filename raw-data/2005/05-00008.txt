of a Thousand Columns, From Hindustan to Malabar with Ibn Battutah.  I 
would be extremely grateful for any help you could give in promoting this 
event through friends and acquaintances. This is the first time that the 
Society has embarked on such a venture and am very eager for it to be a 
success. I have put some blurb about it below.  I have attached the flyer 
for it [removed -- ed.] but would be very happy to send you some in the 
post. If you would like to come please send a cheque to Royal Asiatic 
Society, 60 Queen?fs Gardens, London W2 3AF Tickets are ?10 non-fellows ?8

With thanks and best wishes,
