Dear Brad Clough,
You may find very useful my Sanskrit Mahakavya "Ramapratapa-caritam"(2 vols) with Hindi and English translation and a long introduction, available at Chaukhamba Sanskrit Prakashan, Bunglow Road, Delhi-7. Ths Mahakavya deals with the life and teachings of Ramaprata who was a great sanskrit scholar of the twentieth century and a great Raja-yogi. He had several spritual powers such as Vaak-siddhi( all his words became truth) and Divya Drsti(divine transcental perception) which were experienced by thousands and thousands of persons. An Italian translation of this mahakavya  "Vita Di Un Saggio(has been published in Milan (L#Oca Del Cairo) in 2005.
You have selected an excellent topic and I wish you all success.
Rasik Vihari joshi

Asunto: Supernormal Powers in Ancient Indian Traditions


Dear Colleagues,

(Apologies to RISA subscribers for cross-listing)

I am working on the topic of supernormal powers ("divine" ear and 
eye, knowledge of others' thoughts, memory of past lives, and other 
siddhis/rddhis) in Indian Buddhism, and would like to situate my work 
in the larger context of ancient Indian religions, and so I am 
looking for early Jain and Hindu treatments. I am aware of the Yoga 
Sutra chapter (and commentaries on it) on vibhutis, but am interested 
in other treatments as well. I am more interested in systematic 
discussions, but sustained narratives (from the epics, for example) 
of yogins and tapasvins displaying such powers would be worth 
considering as well. Any suggested references would be most 
appreciated!
