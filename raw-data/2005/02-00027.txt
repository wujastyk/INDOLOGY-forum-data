I think I remember there is a discussion of maNis  in the Amarakosa, and
the various places they come from (oysters, conchs, elephants, bamboo),
inc. snakes.  Perhaps the commentaries, and in particular those in
Tibetan, might be helpful.

Ingalls' Anthology does have a note on jewels in snake's heads, but it
is very brief and just refers to several poems where their luminosity is
used as a figure.
