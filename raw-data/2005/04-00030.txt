Look at the Library of Congress catalog under Ganesa (Buddhist deity), and you will find three books on Ganesa in Japanese. Also, there is Alice Getty's classic book on the deity, which I know deals with the god in Buddhism:

Gane?sa; a monograph on the elephant-faced god.  [2d ed.] New Delhi, Munshiram Manoharlal, 1971

I am sending you Joel, separately, a list of some other general books on Ganesa which might have something on his Buddhist forms but which I'm not sure would.  The file would be too long for the list.

Hello.  Can anyone point me to some books or articles discussing Ganesha as depicted/worshiped in Buddhist traditions?  I know Ruegg has done a little work on the subject but wasn't sure what else to suggest to this person.
Thanks,
Joel Bordeaux, Columbia
