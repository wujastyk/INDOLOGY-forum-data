Subject: question about gender of two names
Message-ID: <161227076759.23782.11059080141194789309.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A patron needs to know the gender of this person:

PANDIT, Kavita Krishnakumar  (1956- )

Temporal and Spatial Variation in Sectoral Labor Allocation during Development.  Ohio State University [United States], 1987 (Ph.D. in Geography).  Chairperson/Major Adviser: Emilio Casetti.  xi, 159p.  DAI 48, no.9 (Mar. 1988): 2423-A; UM 8726704.

Kavita of course is female, but the middle name is male.  Is there any part of the country where a woman may have a male middle name?  Could this be from  a patronimic naming system, as in the Maharashtrian 'middle names'?   Attempts to get the information from Ohio State have been unavailing because of privacy laws (sic).

A similar question from another source:  In Rajasthan would Tilak be a man's given name or a woman's?  In Sanskrit the common noun is masculine, but on the other hand one might speculate the meaning, "ornament," would also be appropriate for a woman.

Thanks,

Allen
