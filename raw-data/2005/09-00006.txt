Historically, vaiduurya and beryl are cognates. So, one should expect
vaiduurya to stand for the same gem as beryl does.

vaiduurya becomes velura in Prakrit, from which, through metathesis, we get
Veruu.la, the name of the place where in greenish-bluish stone the amazing
top-to-bottom temple is carved.
