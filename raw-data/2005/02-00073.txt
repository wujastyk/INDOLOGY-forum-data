Artur Karp said, "In Polish tradition "small people" are called
"krasnoludki", which can be
translated as "little red people". It may be of interest that they are
believed to have their homes either in or near toadstools (amanita
muscaria)."

In Germany also, I think.  My nurse in Giessen  in 1947-48, when my
father was in the Occupation, did silhouettes and watercolors.  I have
one of a little white-bearded fellow in a red coat under an amanita.  He
also has ladybugs around him (small red beetles with black spots). While
we're on the latter, has anyone ever actually seen the red beetles or
bugs called indragopas?  Can one find a picture anywhere?
