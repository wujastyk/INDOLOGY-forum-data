Sure... Adya : "eatable" and svar : "sky"...

For the transcription of the KS, I used two editions of the KS :
The first was published in saMvat 1991 (1935), in Bombay, par gaGgAviSNu
zrIkRSNadAsa, owner of the lakSmIveGkatezvara sTIm pres (i.e. steam press),
it was 'for private circulation only' ! and includes in its two volumes : 
The text : zrIvAtsyAyanamaharSipraNItaM kAmasUtram, 
Yazodhara's commentary : zrIyazodharaviracitayA jayamaGgalAkhyavyAkhyayA
sahitam,
And the vernacular gloss (bhASA-TIkA) of a "non specialized (?) independant
research scholar", a certain paNDita mAdhavAcArya :
sarvatantrasvatantra-risarca-skAlar  paNDita mAdhavAcArya-nirmitayA
puruSArtha-prabhAkhyA-bhASA-TIkayA TIppaNIbhiz ca vibhUSitam

The second is the well-known Kashi Sanskrit Series 29, the kAmasUtram of
zrI vatsyAyAna muni... edited with Hindi Commentary by zrI devaduTTa
zAstrI, VaranasI, 1964. (To which refers A. Dani?lou's translation : K?ma
s?tra, le br?viaire de l'amour, commentaire Jayamagal? en sanskrit de
Yashodhara; extraits d'un commentaire en hindi de Devadatta Sh?str?.

I happened to make occasional references to both hindI commentaries in the
French notes of my transcription, more often to Yazodhara's gloss or
remarks, the problem is that none of these commentators undertands the
chapter in question (purUSAyita) like D. 
	It seems clear from the text and the commentaries that, when her lover is
a bit exhausted, a woman can, with his consentmen.t (2.8.1) or not (2.8.2),
or on his demand(2.8.3) come on top of him. 
Let's take a look at the following :
2.8.4 tatra yukta-yantreNaivetareNotthApyamAnA tam adhaH pAtayet. evaM ca
ratam avicchinnarasaM tathA pravRttam eva syAt. ity eko 'yaM mArgaH.
D. "Elle est d?cid?e ? l'unir ? l'instrument qu'elle lui introduit dans le
cul de fa?on ? ce qu'il prenne go?t (Rasa) ? un plaisir (Rata) apr?s
l'autre. Cela est une des fa?ons de proc?der."
For those who do not read French :
"She is decided to unite him to the tool she is busy introducing into his
ass, so as to make him taste (rasa) one pleasure (rata) after the other.
That is one of the ways to proceed."

	This kind of remedy to impotency  (seasoned with some spices) may be
familiar to the readers of Petronius Arbiter (Satyricon CXXXVIII) but this
classical practice (only used in cases of emergency) has nothing to do with
vAtsyAyana. 

If we take a look at yazodhara' commentary :
tatreti -- puruSAyite / dvividhaH kramaH / tatrAyaM prathamo
yukta-yantreNaivAparityakta-zalya-saMyogenaiva itareNa nAyakena
tryasra-sthitenAsInena cotthApyamAnA bAhu-pAza-saMdAnitA saty upari
kriyamANA taM nAyakam avapAtayed iti / evaM sati ratam avicchinna-rasaM
tathA pravRttam eva syAt / yantraM vizleSya punaH saMdhAne ratam apUrvam
eva syAt ...
The gloss makes it clear that he woman gets on top of her lover keeping his
penis inside of her (a-parityakta-zalya-saMyogena ... nayakena), and that
in consequence there is no interruption in sensation, which would not be
the case otherwise.
The HindI commentary just gives a (poetical) confirmation: puruSa-kA
sAdhana us-ke madana-maMdira-se alag na hone pAe ([this way], the
instrument of the male has not the possibility of being separated from her
'love-palace'... [KSS29 p.340]

D. did not rely heavily on Sk. or Hindi commentaries.  He was not
interested at all in the Kama-sutra. He relied on his own obsessions and
was only interested in promoting them.

I believe that erotism and erotical practices, are an important part of any
civilization. That the kAma-sUtra is one of the keys to understand the
relation between men and women in ancient and in modern India. To try to be
an indologist is also to warn against translations which distort the texts
to make them fit to the religious, political, or sexual obsessions of the
translator.

>General question: can one be a bad philologist, but still a good Indologist
>in some sense?

My answer : a bad philologist cannot be a good indologist in any sense; but
a good philologist can still not be a good indologist :-)

NB1. For the collectors, another recent french 'translation' of the KS
exists : Les K?ma-s?tra, V?tsy?yana, Traduit du Sanskrit et pr?sent? par
Jean Papin, Zulma, 1991 "Publi? avec le concours du Centre R?gional des
Lettres Midi-Pyr?n?es" [?] Its only relation with the sanskrit original is
a photocopy of the first page of the text in the Kashi Sanskrit Series
edition of the text (Varanasi, 1964), otherwise it owes most of its
substance to Burton / Arbuthnot's translation.
