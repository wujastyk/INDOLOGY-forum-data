Exactly. This is why I find the hyper-sensitivity of some well-meaning
non-Germans, when such topics are discussed, pretty ironical, given that
Germans of this generation have no trouble at all discussing them, and
are much more ready to approach them just as what they are for them,
namely history.

When I posted on this list a comment on Bopp's position on "IE",
I tried to make clear I did not believe the use of "IG" by German
Indoeuropeanists nowadays was anything other than idiomatic (while suggesting
that they might want to look at the pedigree of the term nonetheless)

Sure enough, I was immediately jumped on by a non-German (of course),
for not leaving old history alone, for treating the Germans like pariahs
and I don't know what else.
