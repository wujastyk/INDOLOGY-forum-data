I believe it is in Deussen's "System of Vedanta" that he has an appendix
which goes into this in some detail.  If someone else could furnish the
citation--I don't have it here at my office--it is the very small thin
Deussen Vedanta book.  In this appendix he goes so far as to liken
Zankara's teachings to "the perfection" achieved in the Sermon on the
Mount of the New Testament (Book of Matthew?).

Keep me/list posted as this is a most interesting topic.  C. Rhys-Davids
has a note that "Deussen was a staunch Parminidean, and admitted as much
to me himself"

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other
than that of which it is the transformation.
