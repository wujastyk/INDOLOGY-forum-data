S. Palaniappan --

I'm interested by your remark --

While not acquainted with this field & its literature, must say I'm a 
bit curious abt. the work you mention from the late singer/scholar S. 
Ramanathan.  Do you happen to know if if Ramanathan's study (or 
studies) found their way into print?

So happens, his daughter and son-in-law (Geetha & Frank Bennett) are 
long-time acquaintances.  Also a footnote:  Geetha Ramanathan Bennett 
has become somewhat noted as a contemporary vina exponent; -- when 
I saw them in LA last spring, there was (for instance) mention of a 
concert-tour taking her to Australia, and a recording gig in Germany.

Might you (off hand) be able to identify the Hindustani-system 
equivalent raga (supposing that there must be one, at least in terms 
of the scale)?  Again, this is from simple curiousity ...

thanks, d.i.
