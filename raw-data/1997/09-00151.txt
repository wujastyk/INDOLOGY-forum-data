Subject: IMPORTANT list changes PLEASE READ
Message-ID: <161227032332.23782.7956175017194777034.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

One of the jobs we are carrying out over the summer is moving all local email
lists to a new list server. Last night the Indology list was moved. You have
received this message because you are a member of this list.

It is important that you take note of the following:

1) The listname is unchanged and you should continue post to indology at liverpool.ac.uk
exactly as before.

2) The email address of the new list server is listserv at liverpool.ac.uk
(listproc is the old server and should not be used).

3) The syntax of most of the commands is similar, if you want chapter and verse
then send listserv the message:

    help

4) The new server provides better facilities for offering list archives.
Archives are still available via email. In addition, you can access them at the
following URL:

http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/archives/indology.html
