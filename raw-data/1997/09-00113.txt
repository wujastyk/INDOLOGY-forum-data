Well, now that you bring up the subject, I'll have to reveal a well-kept
secret:  the Egyptian, Greek and all other great civilizations are derived
from the Mayas of Central America.
If you have doubts, read Augustus Le Plongeon's 1896 book 'Queen Moo and the
Egyptian Sphinx.'  He gives irrefutable proof that the Greek alphabet is
derived from the Mayan language.  The Greek alphabet is a cryptic
description, in Mayan, of the sinking of the ancient continent of Mu (now
you know where the name of that letter comes from!).  The ancient Mayas
traveled to the Middle East and beyond, and their teachings informed all
great civilizations.

Another author, a certain Tony Earll (who sold more than his cosmically
allotted share of paperbacks), described the discovery of some ancient
tablets in the outskirts of Mexico City that talked of the ancient sunken
continent.
As it turns out, Tony Earll is an anagram of 'not really.'

Here are some of Le Plongeon's books.

For those interested in possible pre-columbian contacts between the Americas
and the rest of the world, a good starting point would be:

 Needham, Joseph, 1900-
      Trans-Pacific echoes and resonances : listening once again / Joseph
    Needham and Lu Gwei-Djen.  Singapore ; Philadelphia : World Scientific,
    c1985.
