	This seems to be a good opportunity to introduce the list to a
superb book currently in press by Thomas Trautmann called ARYANS AND
BRITISH INDIA, California Press, which traces the development of, and
relationship between, philology and race science in nineteenth

Inden and Schwab on one's bookshelf.   Edwin Bryant.
