Of course there is much more to the analysis of IE roots. There may be
ablaut -- alluded to in earlier posts in terms of Skt. guNa & vRddhi, etc.
-- there may be laryngeals, when a consonant seems to be missing, there may
be resonants and sibilants, etc. etc. However, my intention in posting only
the core pattern was not to elaborate on IE root structure, but to add one
more argument to the view that IE roots do have vowels.
