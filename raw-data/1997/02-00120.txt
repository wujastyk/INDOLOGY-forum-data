Firstly, the nakshatras from Anuradha to Punarvasu would normally mean
Anuradha, Jyeshtha, ... , Asvini, ... , Punarvasu.   The zodiacal sign
Mesha covers 2 1/4 of these nakshatras, beginning with Asvini.   Hence if
the sun is in Mesha it is high in the sky and the time is not midnight.  
The translation would have to be quite different to change this situation.

Secondly, a clue to the date of the poem is that the zodiacal signs are in
use, but the date of introduction of the signs into India is is a vexed
question.   David Pingree believes it was in the 2nd cent. AD, while P V
Kane thought the 3rd or 4th cent. BC.
