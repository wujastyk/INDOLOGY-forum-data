E. Obermiller announced an English translation in: "A Sanskrit
ms. from Tibet -- Kamala"siila's Bhaavanaakrama." In: Journal of the
Greater India Society. 2,1 (Jan. 1935), p. 1-11, resp. p. 4: "We have
prepared an edition of both the Sanskrit and Tibetan text of the
Bhaavanaa-krama which we intend to publish before long with a
translation in English and a complete bilingual index verborum." 

The same year Obermiller died and the plan, it seems, did not
realize. I don't know if the unpublished papers of Obermiller are
stored somewhere.

I am aware of a Hindi translation and a Sanskrit "restoration" made by
Gyaltsen Namdol which was published in 1985 by the Central Inst. of
Higher Tibetan Studies, Sarnath-Varanasi.
