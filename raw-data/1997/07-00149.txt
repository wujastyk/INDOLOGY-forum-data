Through a mistake the Library of Congress has in Washington a run of the
New Delhi ed. of Dainika jagarana, a Hindi daily.  LC plans to film the
Kanpur ed. and has no use for this run.  The sequence is approximately 1
Nov. 92-1 Nov 93 (they are not completely in order and there may be some
slightly later).  Would any library with an exchange relationship with the
Library of Congress like these?
