Subject: Color of Skin
Message-ID: <161227030263.23782.14166532063668300332.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is a text which _denies_ the correlation between varna and skin 
colour: the _VajrasUcI Upanishad_. This text has been printed many times; 
the most accessible is in Radhakrishnan's _Principal Upanishads_. There 
is a substantially different recension published by A. Weber in 
Abhandlungen der Ko"niglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin 
(1859), pp. 205-6. Rammohun Roy published a version which shows some 
similarities to Weber's as against the usual recension (reprinted 
in _rAmamohana granthAbalI, part 4, pp. 45-8). 

The text, composed from an Advaita Vedant viewpoint, denies the reality of 
the notion of brAhmAna in any sense other than 'knower of Brahman'. It 
does so by asking whether one is a brahmin by birth, action, knowledge, 
etc., reducing each hypothesis in turn to absurdity.

It includes this passage (using Rammohun's version):

If one is a brahmin by varna, then a brahmin would be white because of 
his sattva guna, a kshatriya red because of his sattva and rajas nature, 
a vaishya yellow because of his rajas and tamas nature, and a shudra 
black because a shudra is made of tamas. Because, now and in former 
times, these colours are found in random distribution, varna does not 
make a brahmin.
