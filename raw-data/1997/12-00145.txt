  Dear coleagues,

  does anybody of you know the whereabouts of
Dr. J. L. Shaw? If I'm not mistaken, he taught philosophy at Victoria
University of Wellington several years ago. I tried to find his e-mail
address through
Infoseek, but failed.

  Many thanks in advance.

  Sincerely Yours,
                    Olenev Dmitry
