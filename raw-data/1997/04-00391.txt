meant 'fine web' of spiders. From Nature, Dravidians
got the clue and used 'nuul/nuval' also for composing texts. That is why,
`nuul/nuval' refers to both 'thread' and 'text'.
Similarly, in Sanskrit also, suutra (related to 'sIv-', 'syU')
means 'thread' as well as 'text'. Are there any other languages
where some term from weaving industry and text are identical?
Again, Sanskrit and Tamil use a single word to denote
'thread' and 'text'.


Any thoughts,
