	Naaraaya.nabha.t.ta uses the expression kalaayaavalii several
	times in his famous poem Naaraayaa.niiya.  As far as I can tell, 
	it must be kalaaya + aavalii, a row/line of kalaaya.  The dictionary 
	meaning of kalaaya (Apte) is "green peas", (vaa.taa.naa in Marathi).  
	I wonder if anyone knows the significance of this expression in the 
	context of describing the Krishna image in the temple at Guruvaayur?  
		Thanks.

S.N.Sastri, in his book S'rimannaaraaya.niiyam, translates kalaaya as
blue lily.
