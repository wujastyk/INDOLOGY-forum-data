And also inscriptions from Sumeria and Crete, published by Abhedananda
Academy of Culture, Calcutta. Sankaraananda is a 20th century author. Some
interesting titles of his are - Hindu States of Sumeria, The last days of
Mohenjodaro, The Rgvedic Culture of the pre-historic Indus, Decipherment
of inscriptions on Phaistos disc of Crete and The Dictionary of Indian
Hieroglyphs.

The Rgvedic Culture of the pre-historic Indus has also been published by
Ramakrishna Vedanta Math, Calcutta, in 1943. And presumably because of the
publisher's name, Library of Congress annotations {see LC Call No.:
Microfilm BUL-ENG-358 (D)} identify this Sankaraananda as a disciple of
Anandaatman (13th-century)!
