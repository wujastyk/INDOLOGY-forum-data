        Not only the nakedness of the hermit, but the very image of the wheel
of Time whirring (and whirling) IN THE CAVE with absolute certainty points
to India. See. e.g., the so called "Uttanka's Vision" (Mahabharata I.3.147-149,
174) where the Wheel of Time whirls in a cave (here also two gods of Fate,
Dhata and Vidhata, in the guise of two female weavers, weave the destinies
of the world), and Mbh XII.237.32, where again the Wheel of Time whirls
in a cave, but this time probably the "cave of the heart", the depth of
human psyche is meant. Not so the symbolism of the wheel of time, but the
symbolism of the cave in both these pictures is specifically Indian, quite
distinct from European symbolism of the cave in all its varieties
("Plato's cave" and so on).
        But unfortunately I have no idea what the Indian source of
Wackenroder's tale could be and am eagerly waiting, together with Paolo
Magnone, for an opinion of the erudites.
