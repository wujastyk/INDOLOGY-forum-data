        I thank you for this precisions but it seems that was not the
unique form of the abhiSEka. See MBh I, 206 where YudhiSThira is going to
the 'puNyAni tIrthAni' of Hardwar. It is said (v.11):
abhiSekAya kaunteyo gangAm avatatAra ha
and, immediatly after:
tatra abhiSekam kRtvA sa ...
        Is it impossible to understand from the use of ava-tR- that he goes
himself in the GangA's water ?
        And the mahezvara's declaration (MBh XIII, 18, 36) I've used for
the subject seems to going towards the same interpretation.
        I was perhaps misoriented by the English word 'bath' (in French,
the 'bain' suppose an immersion of the body in the water, not just a
superficial cleaning) but my question is:
        in ANCIENT Indian religion, the ritual performed at places such
saras or tIrtha:
        - can suppose complete immersion ?
        - can be named abhiSeka ?
        - can be used for statues of Goddesses as it happens in ancient
Greece ?

        I known the ziva's story and His name tripuraghna, but I don't
understand how it can explain the name tripurasundarI and I was not
searching for a theological but for a mythical explanation (where sundarI
has simply the meaning 'woman').
        Please, don't see any offense against your religion (we have
probably the same pitaras), but my scope is the archaic forms of It and I
subscribed to Indology with comparativist intentions. My main interrest for
the name tripurasundarI is that it can perhaps (?) explain some obscure
Greek names as Tripolis, tripolos, Triptolemos or Tritogeneia.

        Namaste,
