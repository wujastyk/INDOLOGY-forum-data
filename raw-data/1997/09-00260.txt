".L" is the name of a goddess, the mother of the wishing-cow.  I think that
most other cases of the vowel result from a metastasis from .r to .l for
phonological reasons.  I always thought that the long version was a logical
"contrivance" to support Panini 1.2.27 where vowels are divided into short,
long, and superlong (pluta).  But I looked in Monier-Williams and found that
".Lii" is an epithet of Siva.  Does anyone know of its origin?
