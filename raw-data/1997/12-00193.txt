When a simple explanation `tArakamayah=full of stars' explains every thing
and it has the puranic sanction why should we invoke far fetched explanations.
When the word tArakA in the samAsa means simple `star' and not tArA the
person why should we try to give tArA the name of tArakA which does not
occur anywhere else except in the prose portion of the edition you have and
which could be a wrong reading. I feel this discussion has gone far enough
and as far as I am concerned the explanation `tArakamayah=full of stars'
seems to be alright.

sarma.
