Yes, there certainly are such words. The first section of pataJjali's
mahAbhASyam, for example, is the paspaZ?hnikam. A commonly occurring term
for 'seta' is Aspadam. There are verb forms like caskanda, and asprAkSIt.
The <s> is also maintained in compounds like vAkyasphoTaH, and the
sequences in question are maintained when no longer initial because a
negative a- is affixed, and when one of various upasargAH is affixed.

Sorry, you will have to continue typing those H's.
