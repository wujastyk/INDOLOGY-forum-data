I think  G. V. Iyer made at least two Sanskrit movies, with
one of them said to have won some kind of award in 1992.

I wouldn't mind hearing anything you might know about those
movies or G. V. Iyer, primarily where one can get the tapes
of the Sanskrit versions, how good those movies Sanskrit is,
how one could get a hold of the scripts (maybe someone here
knows the director), how good the movies are as movies, etc.
