If Staal is correct in the assertion that bricks are first mentioned
only in the Yajurveda, then this is a very sound argument.  I have
always thought the Angiras were indigenous priests.  They are
sometimes associated with the domestication of cattle as in Rgveda X
169-2 where domesticated breeds are created by the tapasya of the
Angirasa.  Wild rice is the offering to Brhaspati, an Angirasa
priest  (Satapatha Brahmana V 3-3-5).  The Mahabharata mentions
that the ancient rishis gathered wild rice for sustenance.

The strongest evidence is the close association of the Angirasas with
the Atharvaveda.  The latter work is often seen as a compilation of
indigenous beliefs and practices.
