Being myself interested in the subject, I was very much disappointed
to see in the Indology archives that there had been no replies. I could
add only one item, far from being recent too: Louis Renou's translation
of both hymns with brief commentary in: Hymnes speculatifs du Veda
traduit du sanskrit et annotes par L.Renou. Gallimard/UNESCO, Paris, 1956,
pp.215-220,272.
