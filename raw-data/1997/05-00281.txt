George, I too found Howard's original posting to be a little convoluted
(although, in honesty, your analysis of it above seems more of a 'rant' to
me than his original statement).  However, Howard clarified his point in
a subsequent posting and has done so again in his last posting, making 
his argument quite plain and in no need of further comment from me. 

My question to Louis remains: why was it
considered appropriate, to drag in and broadcast Howard's
personal religious orientations when this was irrelevant to the simple
point he was making (which was not to advocate scholarly neutrality)?
