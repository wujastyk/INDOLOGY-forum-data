   It is the "koDava" dialect of kodagu you are talking about. It does
   retain the two r's. koDava is having influence of both kannaDa
   and malayALam - yet remains as a seperate language. I do not know
   if you can call it as a dialect of kannaDa as koDava is not
   intelligible completely to kannaDa speaking people , although all
   koDavas can speak Kannada. Now Kodava is written in kannaDa script
   and there are news papers publushed too.

   My friend who speaks tuLu says there is no distinction of two r's
   in it.
