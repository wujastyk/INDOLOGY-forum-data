If those of you who work with the PC and use
Truetype fonts are not satisfied with the NORMAN
font, change to the HEINER font that works without
problems (it includes all diacritics in romanised
form and - depending on yours to use or use not -
there are also separate letters for the aspiratae
[gh, dh, Dh etc.] and for au, ai). This is helpful
in case you have problems with the automatic
breaking of words at the end of lines (like buddha
into budd-ha).
I will send you this font free (together with a
keyboard-layout)
