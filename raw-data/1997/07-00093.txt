Subject: How a buck/stag could have become a lion!

I think an art historian like Michael Rabe can do Tamil literary history a
big favor by dating CilappatikAram from the iconographic descriptions
discussed in this thread. The dating methodology till now based on the
GajabAhu synchronism, and Satakarni has not been very satisfactory. My guess
is that there was only a short time window when the bull was associated with
DurgA  before she is fimly seated on the lion during Guptan times. I think
Ilanko must have composed his epic during that period. The Azes coin
discussed earlier, could help in that regard. There may be other evidence an
art historian would know.
