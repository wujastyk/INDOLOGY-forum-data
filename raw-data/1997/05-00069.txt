>>Would you agree with the statement:
>>'Most Hindi speakers pronounce the vowel .r as if it were the ri in
rip.'
>>If you do then when do you think this change from the vowel sound .r to
ri
>>began to take place and is their a similar variation in Sanskrit?

In Paninn's Siksha
              " .r tu ra sha moordhanyaah"
the affinity of .r and consonant r is recognized. The guna of .r being ar
also indicates the same affinity.
