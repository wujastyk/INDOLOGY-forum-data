Dear members of indology

it is a pleasure for us to announce our newly published
handbound book in leather/line about Asia. Our intention
is to promote this Thai-Austrian friendship project on
the web.

The contents range from expeditions to ethnological
studies and Buddhism; the book is written in german.

Those interested in Southeastasian topics are welcome
