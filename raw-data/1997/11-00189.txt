According to Hc pattana, paTTana and puTabhedana
are the central places of 50 villages.
Another explanation: Hemac. DhAt. I 962:
pura-vizeSaH
Finally ArthazAstra 300.8 and 311.7: pattana is a
town and not a trade-place.

>Hi,
>
>Close to the Sarasvati River, we have names of
ancient settlements such as
>Prabhas Patan (SaurASTra), Pattan Minara
(Bahawalpur Province) (cf.
>Mughal, Ancient Cholistan, 1997 where a
'pre-Islamic' shrine is identified
>on the banks of the River).
>
>paTTaNa is a common suffix in names of ports such
as chennappaTTaNam,
>macilIpaTTaNam, vizAkhapaTTaNam.
>
>Is the etymon paTTaN related to an ancient port
of call? Is it related to
>paTTi, a street? If so, Pattan Minara could have
been a terminal port town
>on the desiccated river?
>
>I would deeply appreciate receiving guidance on
this.
