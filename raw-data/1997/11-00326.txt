Yes I first used that word. But notice "a _little_ [...] pedantry".
And I definitely did not mean it in a bad way. No criticism implied.

In fact I like Renou's terse style a lot. Simply in this specific
instance I failed to understand the purpose of his making a distinction
which only makes sense in a comparative context. Note Renou explicitly
states that his grammar does not concern itself with the comparative
approach. So I thought, is he just trying to be cute. And apparently
he was :)
