  BERKELEY URDU LANGUAGE PROGRAM IN PAKISTAN

    The 26th Berkeley Urdu Language Program in Pakistan (BULPIP) will provide
    30 weeks of Urdu instruction in two 15-week terms, with winter and spring
    breaks, from September 1998 through May 1999. Particularly well-qualified
    persons unable to spend the entire academic year may apply for one term.
    Independent scholars and faculty members who wish to improve their
    knowledge of Urdu in conjunction with ongoing or planned research are
    encouraged to apply. This is strictly a language program.

    Eligibility:
    1. Applicants must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States.
    2. Applicants must have completed at least two years of Urdu and/or Hindi,
    or the equivalent, and possess a good knowledge of the Urdu script.
    Applicants who have been instructed in one year of Urdu and/or Hindi are
    eligible if they intend to take an intensive second-year Urdu/Hindi course
    during the summer prior to their intended program stay.

    Cost:
    All participants must pay a $25 application fee and a program fee of $2000
    for the full academic year or $1300 for one term.

    Advanced language students can pay their tuition, housing, round-trip
    transportation to Pakistan, a maintenance allowance, and health insurance
    in one of the following three ways:
    1. USIA/NMERTA funding: Upon acceptance to the program, US citizens who are
    registered  students in a graduate program will be considered for a full
    fellowship sponsored by the United States Information Agency. This
    fellowship covers all costs of the program, except the application and
    program fees. No provision is made for dependents.
    2. Other fellowships: Alternate sources of funding include fellowships
    sponsored by Foreign Area Language Studies, Fulbright, and the Social
    Science Research Council.
    3. Private funding: Students may participate in the program using their own
    funds. Ask us about total costs.

    Deadline:
    The application deadline is March 1, 1998. Request applications and
    additional materials from:
