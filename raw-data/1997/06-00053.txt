Thanks to all who answered to my question about Leitner, especially 
to Ruth Laila Schmidt and Klaus Karttunen. The information in
the book Ruth named:  'The Gilgit Game: Explorers of the Western 
Himalayas 1865-95 by John Keay. London, 1979 are interesting and 
Klaus too should look into it to supplement the one or other point 
of his biographical sketch. Thus, Leitner must have converterted that 
house in Woking already in 1884 into the Oriental Institute. Stein 
lived there for about 4 weeks in 1884 and describes it and his few 
inhabitants in a letter to Roth. The whole idea was looked upon a 
failure, as Rost suggests in a letter to Roth. 
Klaus, if you like Stein's description for your collection I can send 
it as attachment to an email message. His letters I have already in 
my computer.
So long
Gabriele

As I suppose this might be interesting to others, too, I send it 
through the list.
