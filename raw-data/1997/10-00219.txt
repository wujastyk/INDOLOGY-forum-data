AIDS is no doubt increasing in India but your contention that India has
largest number of homosexuals is just a conjecture on your part unless you can
provide any basis. In India AIDS is mostly heterosexually propagated.

>that an Indian woman, a lesbian no less!, has worked to assist

Regardless of her country of origin, I am not aware of her having done
anything in India for AIDS or lesbianism.  She is an activist in USA only
where AIDS and homosexuality seem to be intertwined.

It is a consequence of initial labeling of AIDS as homosexual problem that is
responsible for the disproportionately large funding for this disease at the
cost of several diseases such as diabetes that kill many more people worldwide
