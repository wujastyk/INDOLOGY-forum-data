The genetic affiliation of Nihali continues to be disputed,
indeed. It has been variously classified as an isolate, a
divergent branch of Munda, a non-Munda Austroasiatic language,
as related to Afroasiatic and/or Nostratic etc.
The now "classical" source on the problem is:
        FBJ Kuiper (1962), "Nahali: A Comparative Study",
        _Mededelingen der Koninlijke Nederlandse Akademie
        v. Wetenschapen_, Afd. Letterk., 25 (5): 239-352
Cf. also
        FBJ Kuiper (1966), "The sources of the Nahali
        vocabulary", in: NH Zide ed., _Studies in Com-
        parative Austroasiatic Linguistics_, The Hague
        [:Mouton & Co.], 57-81
The last issue of _Mother Tongue_ (2, 1996) contains a long paper
on the Nihali language and its proposed relatives by Asha Mundlay,
with comments & discussion by PK Benedict, JD Bengtson, V Blazhek,
AB Dolgopolsky, HC Fleming, A Vovin & NH Zide.

Best wishes, Wolfgang Behr
