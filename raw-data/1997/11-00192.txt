You can do Gujarati at SOAS in London. Rachel Dwyer, the lecturer there,
has also published a Teach Yourself Gujarati book, but it might not be the
sort of thing you are looking for. (At the other extreme there is
Cardona's Gujarati Reference Grammar, a no-holds-barred technical
treatise.) I suggest you get in touch with Rachel and ask her for
suggestions. She is rd3 at soas.ac.uk.
