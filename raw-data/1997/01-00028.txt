Subject: Indus Script panel in ICANAS, Budapest, July 1997
Message-ID: <161227027802.23782.697041552006435965.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear friends,

I have suggested a panel discussion on the Indus Script and Soma in the 
ICANAS Congress. I have also sent in discussion papers 
on the panel topic. These papers will also be posted on 
http://www.investindia.com together with backgrounder maps 
on the Sarasvati river and ancient settlements on the river.

Indology members interested in the suggested panel 
are requested to advise me or 
send the discussion papers to: ivanyi at osiris.elte.hu

Best regards, 
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
