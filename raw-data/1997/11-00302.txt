Hi

I jus got 14 (no less!) messages addressed to/from Marie Genevieve at the
Bibliotheque Nationale (which is just round the corner from here, I admit,
but not her section of it)... I was wondering if this was more or less
intentional in that I'm here (France), or just a blurt out onto the whole
list?...
S'pose I could have waited for the next posting...

mike
