	In addition to Prof. Deshpande's observations, I have also noticed a
	"North Indian" pronunciation of ai as different from the "Dravida"
	pronunciation. But here I observe something different than Prof.
	Deshpande... I have noticed the word jaina pronounced "jane". (We
	"Dravidians" tend to give the dipthong its full pronunciation)

Is it possible that this is so because the Southern languages 
recognize 2 varieties (e, E and o, O as opposed to just e and o
in Sanskrit/Hindi etc) in the preceding vowels ?

I am reminded painfully ;-)
of the parodies of South Indian speech in Hindi films... Mehmood
in "paDosan" springs to mind !

I have met certain KannaDigas who themselves disown any connection 
of their language to Dravidian !!!  And certain relatives of mine
swear, partly in jest, that they have Aryan blue blood flowing thru 
their veins... all I know is that these jokers are all hot-blooded ;-)
