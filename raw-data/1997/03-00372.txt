With reference to "Twilight Language,' if you check out one of Ganesan's
references  - T.N. Ganapathy's _The Philosophy of the Tamil Siddhas_ - you
will find an entire chapter on this topic: Chapter 7 entitled 'The
Twilight Language of the Tamil Siddhas.' Actually, this was originally an
article by Ganapathy, and he constructed his book around it.
