This seems to be the accepted etymology of naranja:

Spanish naranja < Arabic naaranj < Persian naarang < Sanskrit naaranga

English orange came through a similar route < Old French orange < Arabic
naaranj, etc.

The question is, where does Skt. naaranga come from?  MW compares it to
naaga-ranga; and Gomez de Silva (in his Spanish etymological dictionary)
suggests it could possibly come from the Tamil word naru, fragrant.  Any
thoughts?
