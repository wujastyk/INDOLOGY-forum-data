One thing has struck me: For many years, the term "IG" has been used in a
perfectly inocuous manner, having been emptied of its ideological content.
Have you thought about the possibility that by making it an object of
discussion, you may contribute to its being ideologized again? Maybe we
should let sleeping bears sleep?
