Hi,
The word appears in an epigraphical inscription and is interpreted as a culivator; it is also an affix
to the names of cultivator caste in Tamilnadu. A synonym is: vELANmai-mAntar.
kO-vEL means a potter (ancient Tamil)
vEL-ANmai means agriculture

gO = horn (Skt.)
bEl, bail = bull (Gujarati, Punjabi)
aNDemu, aNDiga = one side of a pannier (Telugu)

Interpreting the 'unicorn' on the Harappan seals as an hieroglyph,
the pictogram can be read as kO + vEl + ANma
The substantive meaning is: potter-cultivator; kO is a honorific connoting eminence.

In such an interpretating of the script symbol, the underlying assumption of the language is that circa
3000 B.C., the NW India, particularly on the banks of the Sarasvai and Sindhu rivers was a linguistic
area which intermingled the dravidian, indo-aryan and munda sememes.

Would appreciate receiving comments and suggestions to further advance this methodology in
cracking the script problem.
Regards, Kalyanaraman.
PS. There is an interesting interpretation for the lexeme kshudraka in Kautilya's Arthazaastra:
the word means: a maker of micro-beads. (micro-beads are the major products of the civilization).
Ancient geographical references seem to locate the kshudraka's in the region of Sindh-Rajasthan.
