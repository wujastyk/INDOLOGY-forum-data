Perhaps I'm just overly looking to take a break from my curent writing,
but the point made below (especially as I'm occupied with Vedic accent and

I would append the last line-  Through rhythm, Memory . . . fixates texts.
For it is with meter and accent that deviation is easily revealed, even in
the arrangement, for instance, of the hymns in the family books of the RV.
