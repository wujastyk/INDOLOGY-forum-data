Classical Chinese has a word jing1 (< Old Chinese *ke:ng), regularly used
for "classic" or "canonical text", which originally meant sth. like "warp"
or "thread" during the Archaic period. Other Classical usages include "rule",
"norm",  "law"; "to regulate", "to plan"; "to pass  through" etc. The word
is written with a character that consists of a  phonetico-semantic element
that is usually explained as a depiction of a "hand-loom" by modern paleo-
graphers, and a (semantic) siginific meaning "silk" or "thread", which was
added to the original character during the early classical period. It comes
as no surprise then, that jing1 is used as _the_ standard translation of Skt.
suutra in Chinese Buddhist texts, although it occasionally stands for prava-
cana, pi.taka, nirde"sa, upade"sa, even "saastra as well.
For a (_semantic_) comparison of the Sanskrit and Chinese concepts see
