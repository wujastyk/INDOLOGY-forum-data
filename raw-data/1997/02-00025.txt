There is a paper, 'Statistics and its antiquity', by Dr B. D. Tiwari,
Professor and Head of Department of Statistics, University of Rajasthan,
Jaipur, published in the Journal, Bhaaratii-"Sodha-Saara-Sa.mgraha, Section
2, of year 1, parts 3-4, January 1972, pp.57-63.   Published by Bharati
Mandir Anusandan Sala, R-2 Visvavidyalaya Puri, Jaipur-4, Rajasthan, India.
   (Addresses correct in the early 1980s.)

It is mostly about collection of data in ancient India and does not give
