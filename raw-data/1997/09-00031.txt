India recently celebrated its 50th anniversary of independence from Britain, and to

economy. There is also a feature on three famous protest walks led by Ghandi, views 
of the New Delhi based Center for Policy Research on the shape of India in the year 
2047, views of 35 people on what it means to be Indian, essays by Salman Rushdie, Shahid 
Amin, and Upamanyu Chatterjee, and a photo section. The India Today home page contains a 
connection to India Today, as well as six other Living Media India Limited publications.
