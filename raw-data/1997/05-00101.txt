Subject: Name of laghu/guru patterns
Message-ID: <161227030188.23782.4803657421050838602.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have an incomplete list of the names of patterns of laghu/guru syllables
in a pada. For example,

gajagati (gait of an elephant) is the name given to the pattern GGGLGGGL
(where G is Guru and L Laghu) and
pramANikA (measure) is the name given to the pattern GLGLGLGL

Can somebody tell me where I can find a complete list of such pattern names?
English commentary would be helpful.

TIA
