re: Max Nihom's request for information about "the root of an elephant's ear"
(cuulaka): The Oxford English Dictionary includes as a possible definition of
"root" the following: "Tge imbedded or pasal portion of the hair, tongue,
teeth, fingers, nails, or other members or structures of the body."  One of
the examples is to a 1523 work on husbandry which refers to "the rotes of the
horse eares"
