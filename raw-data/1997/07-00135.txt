Subject: More propitiating the planets
Message-ID: <161227031608.23782.15426814008500590150.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

This message is being sent to the Indology and RISA lists; my apologies to
those who receive it twice.

According to Hazra, the Puranic texts mainly dealing with the propitiation
of the planets appear to be the Matsyapurana, chapters 93, 94, and 228-239,
as well as the Srishti-khanda of the Padmapurana, "chapters 78 to the end".

Is there anyone out there who could be of help in providing me with *the
Sanskrit text* of some or all of these chapters? Monetary recompense
guaranteed, naturally.

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
