To answer this question of ultimate concern for any indologist: Things are
changing rapidly. As late as 30 years ago, you could meet lots of Fraeulein
Doktor in Germany, regardless of their age. Nowadays you have to address
every female student, married or not, as Frau. Marital status has lost its
former importance. But to keep the distinction Herr Dr. and Frau Dr. -
though from an academic point of view irrelevant - may be a useful means to
avoid misunderstandings as long as we have gender distinction as an
integral part of our languages.
