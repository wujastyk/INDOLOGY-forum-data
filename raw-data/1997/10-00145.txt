  Leaving aside the merits or lack thereof in Kakar's works (by the way, he also
co-authored a book with Catherine Clement, where he analyzed the case of a woman in
France who had been treated for hystery and Clement analyzed Ramakrishna, I think
the German title was "Der Heilige und die Verrueckte" - if not unproblematic, his
musings on religion and madness are at least well-written and stimulating) - his
training as a psychoanalyst is decidedly 'Western' (he even studied in Vienna, as
far as I know), so why should there be any problems counting him amongst "Western"
psychologists, in that his theory and also (I presume) his practice largely derive
from theories developed in the "West"?
