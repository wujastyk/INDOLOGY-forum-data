I have a small Kannada-Sanskrit dictionary which contains some neologisms. I
also know of a pictorial Sanskrit dictionary for beginners with similar words.
My impression is that for typically modern things (auto-rickshaws, buses, etc.)
either English words are adapted, or whatever word is in current use in the
modern language of the region. As for modern abstract terms (hermeneutics,
deconstructionism et al.), they are simply not used.

I'm afraid this depends on the specific Indian and Western languages in
question.

This is indeed the most pragmatic course to take. It may not lead to an elegant
or near-native pronunciation, but it is an important start.
