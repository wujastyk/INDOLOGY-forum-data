Subject: How a buck/stag could have become a lion!

In the medical literature, in particular .Dalha.na on Su"sruta, 
there is a clear distinction in groups of animals:  vyaala versus m.rga.

A vyaala is a hunting predator: lion, tiger, etc.
A m.rga is a not a predator: mongoose, jackal, cat.

Best wishes,
Dominik
