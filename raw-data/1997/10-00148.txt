Has she anything published yet anywhere on this?

Thanks also to John Robert Gardner, David Dargie and John Brockington
for answering this query.

Deussen is a character I would like to know more about (besides reading
what he had to say), as he is presumably one of the first to have seriously
made this kind of connection at a time when professional philosophers tended
to act as if nothing outside of the Western tradition qualified as "real
philosophy".

Apparently he wrote an autobiography, apparently in German, but I only have
seen mention of an English translation published at Madras in 1920, which
as apparently must be a pretty hard to find book, seeing that the Library
of Congress only has the microfiche of an incomplete copy.

Thanks
Jacob

ps: Sorry about the spelling, it's obviously "zaGkara" or "zaMkara".
    (in Harvard-Kyoto ?) I have to publicly acknowledge it so I'll
    remember next time. Can't allow myself to slide into bad habits :)
