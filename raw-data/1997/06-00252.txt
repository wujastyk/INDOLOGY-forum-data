Having already deleted the messages I cannot give exact references, but 
someone rightly pointed out the importance of the Hobson-Jobson by Yule 
and Burnell, and some other the importance of finding out the first (and 
not necessarily English) reference for words borrowed or supposedly 
borrowed from India. For this the little known (recently reprinted, but 
very expensive) Portuguese counterpart of the Hobson-Jobson, the 
extensive Glossario Luso-Asiatico by S. R. Dalgado offers interesting 
material.
