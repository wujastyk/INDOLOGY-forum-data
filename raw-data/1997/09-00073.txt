It is difficult to add anything of significance to the most excellent
commentaries of the pundits Jonathan, Lars, Greg, JR, and others.  So then,
what about the In-do-log-y list?  I wish to submit that it is now evident
that it provides the means to LOG-on to true knowledge, to infinity, to
being as well as non-being, and to what was there before being and
non-being!  Some might even call it the Aquarian Soma. (have you landed
safely, Dominik?)
