Regarding reviews of the two volume (a third in press, if I'm not
mistaken) collection of essays on the dating of the historical Buddha:

Lance Cousins published a very informative review in Buddhists Studies
Review (London). I don't, however, have my copy with me so I can't be
very specific. BSR publishes two issues a year and it was in 1996 or 1997.
