Mr. Das Devaraj,
             If you do write to Mr. Muthu Kumara Samy, please feel free 
to refer my name.
             I, very much doubt, whether they have ablist of all their 
publications. They have published more than 1500 books to date.
And they have a long history.
             There is a rare book called "kanakkadhikAram" which was 
published by them in the twenties. On being enquired, they did not even 
know the very existence of the book. 
              Pssst.....(I have a copy).<smug grin>
