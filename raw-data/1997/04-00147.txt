I assume that you are aware of the following, and only, article on the
subject:

Hardy, Friedhelm. 1974. Maadhavendra Purii: A Link Between Bengal Vaiavism
and South Indian bhakti. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 1974: 23-41.

I have also wondered if any material from other Vai.s.nava
sa.mpradaayas is available, and have so far come up empty.
