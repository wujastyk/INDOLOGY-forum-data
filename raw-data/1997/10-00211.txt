Hello!

I am working on Aathinaathan vaLamaDal  by JayamkoNDaar
from a palmleaf manuscript. The only two known mss.
(one at GOML, Madras and other at Perur, near Coimbatore)
are used.

This  12th century work from the age of the imperial Cholas is beautiful.
It praises "kaamam" to be superior to all other purusharththas.
