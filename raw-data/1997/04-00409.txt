Was kazhakam _originally_ a gambling place, or was it a place of assembly
in general, with 'gambling place' as a specialized meaning? Sanskrit sabhA
offers a parallel: generally an assembly, but in sabhA parvan of MBh it
has the special meaning of a gambling session.  In both instances, the
specialised meaning may reflect the importance of public gambling in the 
culture.
