Dear friends,

I'm preparing a webpage dealing with transcription of various scripts and
languages, as well as phonetic notation, in ASCII and HTML. Any suggestions
and/or pointers to existing standards/proposals/existing habits are most
welcome. ALL languages and scripts are of interest.

Thank you,

Philip Jonsson <bpj at netg.se>
