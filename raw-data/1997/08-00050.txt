 hold on for dear life, like the baby monkey? >>

While this cat vs. monkey debate is generally associated with Vaishnavism,
here is a zaivite context where it is discussed by paTTin2attAr.

Here, paTTinattAr explicitly says he is not a baby monkey but belongs to
father ziva  who is like a mother cat holding the kitten.
