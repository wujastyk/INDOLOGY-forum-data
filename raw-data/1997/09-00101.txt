Leona Anderson remarks those concerned about the year 2000 cite
prophets living under the Julian calendar.  But people's worries
concern the year as a whole, not just New Year's Day, and anyway
the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars is (as I
recall) only 11 days.

Another problem of course would be when the year began.  There
used to be significant differences between the countries of Europe
on this question, and differences at different times within a single
country.  Part of the Gregorian reform was making the beginning of
the year January 1, at first in Catholic countries and later in others.
