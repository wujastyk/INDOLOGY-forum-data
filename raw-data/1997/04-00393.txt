See earlier reference to UrNavAbhi = "spider". -vAbhi derives from the same
root as Avestan vaf-, cited above, meaning "to sing".  Clearly,
Indo-Iranians, without any necessary assistance from Dravidians, also "got
the clue from Nature".

I could cite [already have cited] Indo-European, Semitic, and Niger-Congo
language families, if anyone is interested.

As I have already said privately to S. Palaniappan:

"Let me say first of all that I have sympathy and respect for the industry
with which you attack this problem.  In general, I am persuaded [as most
Vedicists are, I think] that Dravidian has left its mark on Vedic, even at
the earliest attested stage [i.e., the RV]. So our disagreement does not
involve this general point."

Our disagreement arises when it comes to specifics.

Best wishes,
