Subject: Any other name for arundhatii in Sanskrit?
Message-ID: <161227028910.23782.13167232431502499317.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Classical Tamil literature, arundhatii, the wife of vasishtha is referred
to as "caalini" or "caali". Does the Sanskrit tradition have any other name
like this besides arundhatii? Thanks.
