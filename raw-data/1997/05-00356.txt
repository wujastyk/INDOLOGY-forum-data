Having wanted to learn Tamil for quite some time, I now see that desire
gradually turning into a necessity. Unfortunately, though, the universities
in my vicinity do not offer any such courses. I have therefore begun to look
around for some self-tuition packages (including audio cassettes or CDs for
learning pronunciation) to get me started. Could the Tamil scholars on this
list recommend any such particular package, or conversely, are there any
that you would advise against buying? All suggestions are most welcome.

Thanks in advance,
