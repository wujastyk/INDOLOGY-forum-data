Which is one reason why some modern authors call the language of the puraa.nas
"corrupted" because of "errors in sandhi". But whether these are really to be
considered "errors" is debatable in some cases, and could indeed reflect a
manner of thinking about prosody that relaxes the application of sandhi rules
in favour of a more natural pronunciation of verses instead of considering the
metrical verse the unit of pronunciation.

Well, I suggest that you watch the behaviour of the suffix "-ku" and of words
like "inta". And when do "words form a whole"? It may be that in contemporary
Tamil prose, written sandhi is largely, though not completely, limited to the
internal sandhi of compounds (though I call it "internal" here, we could debate
over whether "words forming a compound verb" is an instance of internal or
external sandhi). Unambiguous external sandhi is very much there in Kannada
(both loopasandhi and aade;sasandhi), besides internal sandhi.

Adjective and noun?

Perhaps you should go through some linguistic literature to see how linguists
use the term 'sandhi', and that sandhi has not much to do with objects and
verbs.

 voe> `less far-reaching' is to put it mildly.

Are you suggesting, in your criticizing of other sandhis, that only Sanskrit
has the "full variety", and that other languages (French, Italian, Portuguese,
Tamil, Kannada, what else? Irish is another good one) do not have "real"
sandhi? But then, who owns sandhi and decides what real sandhi is? (This is a
rhetorical question, mind you. I am just being nasty. Ignore it.)
