Subject: Indic baby names with a link to SURYA
Message-ID: <161227028034.23782.16143399849193948293.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

"sAyan" is a synonym for "sUrya". So, how about "sAyanI"or, even, "sAyanA"?

Since we are talking about Indic names...I thought I'd ask you folks if
anyone knows the meaning of the GArgi. I know who she is in the upanishhads,
but what does the name mean?

Thanks.
