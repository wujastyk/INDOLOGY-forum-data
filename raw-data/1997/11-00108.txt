You might suggest Josiah Cox Russell's MEDIEVAL REGIONS AND THEIR CITIES
(Bloomington : Indiana U. Press, 1972), which includes a chapter on India
and makes use of Chinese Buddhist pilgrim accounts to arrive at population
estimates.

Also, the pilgrim's records themselves would be useful, particularly
Fa-Hsien's (dates:  ca 337-ca. 422) and Hsuan-Tsang's (dates: ca.
596-664).  Samuel Beal has translated both in SI YU KI = BUDDHIST RECORDS
OF THE WESTERN WORLD; there are other translations available.
