As I don't know how many of you would be interested in the following, this
is merely a preliminary survey. If these topics are not of general
interest, I'd suggest to anyone who has any relevant info to, please,
e-mail me privately at <reusch at uclink4.berkeley.edu>. Thanks.

[1] Does anyone use a database to store their biblio's -- with different
layouts for different purposes, etc. ? If so, how do you get your DB and WP
software to cooperate?  Since I'm a Mac user, I'm primarily interested in
Mac (AppleEvents, etc.); still, the question is open to the users of all
platforms.

[2] Considering the challenges of cross-platform exchanges for the users of
South Asian languages, and even for people on the same platform but using
different fonts, at what point in our work does something like LaTeX become
a necessity? Again, I'm primarily interested in Mac, but the question is
open to all.

Looking forward to your advice,
