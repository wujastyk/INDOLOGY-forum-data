Dear All,

I would very much appreciate your help at the following questions.

1. Is there any English or French translation of TantrAloka (TA) of 
Abhinavagupta published? Do you know of any translation that is planned 
to be published?

2. Is anyone of you aware of courses on TA topics? I have heard on some 
courses given in England (Oxford) and Belgium, but I do not have any 
other details.


Thank you very much for your attention to my request for help.

Sincerely,


Catalin BUIU


Bucharest, Romania
