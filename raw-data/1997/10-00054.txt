I wonder if Palaniappan might cite some well-accepted examples of the
following claim.  It would strengthen his argument.

"But we know that the exigencies of trying to get themselves elevated in
the Aryan/brahminical hierarchical social structure has led many groups in
India to concoct for themselves far more etymologically fanciful names and
histories."
