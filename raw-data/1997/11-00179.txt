    AFAIK, SrirangapaTTaNa was never a port. In Karnataka, "paTTaNa"
    stands for a town and there are many place names ending with
    paTNa, paTTaNa etc - regardless of them being situated on a
    river.

    The name SrirangapaTNa can be explained as "Sriranga's town" as
    it houses a large temple dedicated to Sri Ranganatha.
