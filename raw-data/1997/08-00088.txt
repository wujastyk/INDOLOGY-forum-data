Subject: Q: Black Draupadi?

Dear Indologists,
	The true name of DraupadI (= daughter of Drupada) is KRSNA just
because she's born in the same fire's sacrifice as his brother
DhRSTadyumna; she's no more black than Arjuna is silver-made.
	The polyandry of DraupadI is not ethnological but mythical and
there are many explanations of the fact in the MahAbhArata itself. She's
not the only woman to have many husbands in the epic: KuntI and MAdhavI are
in the same situation and I recall the three ones become again virgins for
each change of husband, not very usual in 'tribal' is'nt it ?
	The fact is not specific to Indian epic, the Greek Helen and the
Irish Medb have many husbands. Sorry for the male chauvinists!
	About Dumezil, it's very hard to explain in few words the work of
an entire life. The best is perhaps to read the first volume of Mythe et
Epopee (an english translation exists).
	Regards,
Dominique
