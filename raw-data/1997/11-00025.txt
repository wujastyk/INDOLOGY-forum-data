Now you're stepping into upadhaaniiya territory! Is reaching for shift
really that burdensome?! :-> Just consider it phlangeal calisthenics.

Also, one point to consider is whether you will be processing this text

scheme each time would cause you a greater pain than just sticking to an
already defined scheme.

Best,
