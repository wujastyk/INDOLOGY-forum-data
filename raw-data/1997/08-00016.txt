Creating the Future:  the use and abuse of Indian role models today

The 1998 DHIIR conference will explore ways in which textual and 
other normative role models have been used to provide paradigms for 
values and behaviour in contemporary Indian communities, both within 
and outside India today.

Four main sections for the conference are envisaged:
i)   Textual sources for role models
ii)   Role models in popular culture and the arts (including a 
performance)
iii)  Transmitting role models to the next generation
iv)  Communalism and the use of role models

Each section will contain two or three thirty minute papers (to 
include time for questions from the floor) with a further hour for 
chair's response and group discussion.  Offers of papers on any of 
the above topics or on the general theme of the conference will be 
welcomed.

The conference will take place in the University of Cambridge and all 
speakers will be provided with accommodation for up to two nights.  
Accommodation will also be available for partners, but this will not 
be funded by the conference organisers.  At the moment, it is 
unlikely that funds will be available for travel expenses.

Proceedings of previous DHIIR conferences are being published by 
Bayeux Arts, Calgary, and a similar volume will arise from this 
conference.  Papers for the volume should be between 5000 and 10000 
words and be ready for 30 September 1998.
