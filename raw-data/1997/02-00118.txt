Subject: New Usenet group:  soc.history.ancient is alive and well
Message-ID: <161227028314.23782.11491903702030310404.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I tried posting to soc.history.ancient using zippo.com
I got the answer: no such newsgroup.
Is there any other site like zippo.com which i can use to access the Usenet group?
My internet service provider does not offer newsgroup access(NNTP); I have to use
websites like www.zippo.com to overcome this problem.
Regards. Kalyanaraman.
