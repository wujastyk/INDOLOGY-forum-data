It should be obvious that the ancient Indians would not write "hm" when they
meant "mh" -- only to discover, when they write in Prakrit, that "mh" can be
written: and so 'brahma' becomes Prakrit 'bamha'. The "mh" pronunciation is
clearly later.

This inversion of h and something else also occurs elsewhere in the
pronunciation of pundits: cf. the name 'Prahlaada' / 'Pralhaada'. And (perhaps
we may say "of course") this also occurs in several modern languages. I
overheard a discussion of precisely this topic of "hm" and "hl" once among
pundits in Mysore, and their conclusion was that although the pronunciation
"mh" and "lh" was historically wrong, it had become extremely common, and
misunderstandings would not occur anyway, so it did not matter much how one
pronounced these combinations.
