Hi, since a lot of you shows interest in the WINWORD97
Visual-Basic-Application program for converting romanized transcribed texts
into Devanagari: the Modul is ready. You get it free including two fonts. In
reverse please mail me each bug.
Okay? You need: Basic knowledge of VBA, WINDOWS95 and preferable WINWORD97.
Writing any text you just choose in WINWORD some lines of texts you liked to
be converted. Then you call the macro-programm. After some seconds the part of
text you choosed will be in devanagari mode.
The modul covers several pages, so please contact me with email. You will get
a zip-file which includes 4 files: the code, a readme-file and two
truetype-fonts.
N o   M a c i n t o s h
Good luck
Heiner
