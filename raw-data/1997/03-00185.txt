Subject: Q: IGNCA - Gitagovinda
Message-ID: <161227028950.23782.16507215637016636651.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 Does anybody know some information about a research project 
 done on Gitagovinda in IGNCA by Kapila Vatsyayan et al  ?
 I wrote there but got no reply so far. I'd appreciate some names of
 scholars who were involved in it (anyone of them residing in Calcutta?).
 I have some vague information that it was basically a research on GG's
 representation in art, dance... Were some textual studies of GG itself a
 part of it?
  Thanks for any info (which I'll be able to receive till 22.March)
