About a week ago I circulated an appeal on behalf of Acta Orientalia that
this journal is at risk of ceasing publication. This original message will
be repeated at the end for those who may not have seen it or have lost it.

In the meanwhile I have received several responses, and in some of them I
have been encouraged to list the contents of some recent issues to
illustrate the relevance of this journal to potential subscribers. It was
also pointed out that I forgot to mention (in most of my messages) that
this is a refereed journal that has always retained a very high quality of
scholarship. A third point occasioned by the replys: please note that there
exists also another journal with exactly the same name (at least as far as
the main title is concerned), namely ACTA ORIENTALIA Academiae Scientiarum
Hungaricae, published from Budapest and now in its 48th vol. (1995). The
ACTA ORIENTALIA now in danger is published from Copenhagen, its ISSN is
0001-6438 and the latest issue is vol. 57 (1996). It has the following
contents (diacritical marks ignored):

I apologize for not giving the final page numbers of the book reviews - I
have only copies of the tables of contents at hand now.

Here follows my original appeal:

ACTA ORIENTALIA, a journal founded in 1922 and published annually under the
auspices of the Oriental Societies of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden,
is devoted to the study of the languages, history, archaeology and
religions of the Orient from the earliest times to our days. It is issued
once a year, and each issue normally contains at least 300 pages. This
well-known refereed journal is now on the verge of ceasing publication. The
Nordic Publications Board for Humanistic Periodicals funding the journal
has
stipulated that a conditio sine qua non is that the journal has a minimum
of 200 subscribers. Due to tightening budgets the world over, the number of
subscriptions has been steadily dropping and is now very close to that
limit. If your library is not already subscribing to Acta Orientalia,
please make a suggestion to that effect. The annual subscription rate is
420 Danish crowns (DKK) (around 70 USD), and the subscription order can be
placed at MUNKSGAARD International Publishers Ltd, POB 2148, DK-1016
Copenhagen K, Denmark (tel. +45 33 12 70 30, fax +45 33 12 93 87) or at
their regional office in the US: MUNKSGAARD, 238 Main Street, Cambridge, MA
02142-9740 (tel +1-617-547-7665, fax +1-617-547-7489).  Every subscription
counts!!! Thanks in advance for your efforts to help AO survive. Yours,
