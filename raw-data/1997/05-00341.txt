The average duration of pregnancy is about 280 days, or 40 weeks of 7 days.
The sidereal lunar month currently lasts 27 days 17 hrs. 43 min.  Ten of
these months equal about 280 days.  So when old texts talk of a gestation
period of 10 months they are, most likely, referring to these 10 sidereal
lunar months.

The sidereal lunar month is the time it takes the Moon to go once around the
Zodiac and return to the same place with respect to the stars.  In other
words, the time elapsed since the Moon is in conjunction with a certain star
until it reaches the same star again.

The synodic lunar month, on the other hand, is the time elapsed from new
Moon to new Moon, or from full Moon to full Moon.  Put differently, it is
the time between two consecutive conjunctions of the Sun and the Moon (in
the case of the new Moon to new Moon scenario).  It is longer than the
sidereal month because by the time Moon goes around the Zodiac, the Sun has
also advanced slightly, and the Moon must catch up.
The current duration of the synodic lunar month is 29 days 12 hrs. 44 min.

I remember having read about a ten month gestation period in the
KathAsaritsAgara, but I don't have access to the reference at the moment.
I'm sure there are many more, probably in Buddhist texts.

Both lunar months were used in ancient India.  The synodic lunar month was
divided into 30 so-called lunar days, the tithis.  And the sidereal month is
the one that defines the nakSatras, the lunar constellations of the Zodiac
(as opposed to the solar constellations, the rA'sis).
