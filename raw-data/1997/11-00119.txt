Dear Dr. Deshpande:
I forwarded your request for the chaturvedi contact information to my
friend. It appears that he would prefer to consult his guru before
revealing his contact information.
This is his response:

>Ravi,
>With regards to my tutor, he is very averse to any kind
>of investigation in to vedic issues. He may respond favorably; my father
>would
>any how be consulting him and he could ask him first. Then we could get the
>address.
>
>     -A
>aravind iyer (aravind at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

I urge you to correspond with aravind regarding this.

With regards
Ravi

Subhaashitam: (Ancient Sanskrit Couplet)

||Kshamaa balam a-shaktaanaam; shaktaanaam bhUshaNam kshamaa|
  Kshamaa vashikrte loke, kshamayA: kim na sidhyati ? | ||

Subhashitasya anuvaadam (Translation):

Forgiveness is the strength of the weak.
Forgiveness embellishes the mighty.
In a world that can be conquered by forgiveness,
what is not possible by forgiveness?
