While not being specifically on Punjabi and Vedic, the following may be useful:

Misra, Siva-kumara; et al (eds). 1987. Panjabi-samskrta sabda-kosa =
Punjabi-Sanskrit glossary. Ilahabada: Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan's G. Jha
Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth.  LC no. PK 2637 P295 1987.

There is also an old article by Satya Vrat Shastri on something like old
Skt words in Punjabi. Full reference may be found in the earlier volumes of
R.N. Dandekar's Vedic Bibliography.

I think I have seen one more, relatively recent,  publication in my
university's library. I may be able to give details later.
