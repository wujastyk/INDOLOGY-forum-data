>  For [ri] in particular I can't recall some evidence right now.
>Only in Jayadeva's Gitagovinda, which is too late (there a .r si clearly

>The pronunciation ri appears earlier also, as pointed out by Wackernagel
>(Ai.Gr. 31 [par. 28], Nachtraege p. 19).  The Pratijnasutra recognizes re
>for the Suklayajurveda, which goes along with the fact that in this
>tradition the svarabhakti in words like zIrSa is e (zIrekha) and not a.
>The a-coloring is also known early, with evidence from the Rkpratisakhya,
>where vocalic R is classed as jihvAmUlIya (RPr. 1.41) and the sound list
>for which has R after a, not after u.  Originally, though, R must have
>begun with a vowel, as evidenced not only by Avestan but also by the fact
>that the Rgveda has sequences like pUrvebhir RSibhir; if R began with r-,
>one would have deletion of preceding r with lengthening of the vowel
>preceding this original r.  Other factors also point to a variety of vowel
>colors in early R, comparable to the variety in modern pronunciations.
