OK, let's put the question this way: given that most students will effect a
broken pronunciation, should one allow _any and all deviations_, or should
we aim for a pronunciation that, while broken, preserves as much as
possible of the functionally most loaded distinctions, even if it does so
in a non-native manner? To take two examples from experience as
Swedish-as-second-language instructor: (1) if the students cannot make a
distinction between dental and retroflex consonants, should one allow them
to conflate them, or should they be encouraged to pronounce [r]+dental
where a native Swede has retroflexes (in Swedish retroflex consonants and
/r/+dental are in complementary distribution, though /r/+dental clusters
are only used by those who have a uvular /r/ [R]). (2) Should a student be
allowed to conflate the Swedish /%/ (High front to mid central lax rounded
vowel [Yw]<>[U+]) with Swedish /u/, which distinction carries high
functional load, or encouraged to conflate /%/ with /y/ which carries a low
functional low, or encouraged to conflate /%/ and /@/ (Low front to central
rounded vowel), as some native dialects do although this distinction
carries a considerable functional load -- a very real problem; incidentally
Finnish, German and Turkish learners follow quite different spontaneous
strategies here! A parallel in Sanskrit is the distinction of long final
vowels: should students be encouraged to stress these, to preserve this
functionally rather highly loaded distinction?

Yes, and how do they explain/describe the relevant distinctions to students
without phonetic training? When I took part in a group learning Tibetan
from tapes the problem wasn't with reproducing the tones accurately, but
with understanding their distinctiveness and applying them correctly. And
that in spite of Swedish being a tone language!

The phonetically untrained are often not aware even of the distinctions of
their own language. A fact, btw, that king Seidzong noted among Koreans
half a millennium ago: people thought that the sounds of their language
were those that the rhyme dictionaries described for Middle Chinese! I
wonder if this applies wrt to Sanskrit in relation to modern Indic
vernaculars also?
