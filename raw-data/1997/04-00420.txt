Most probably you mean sanskrit.tar.gz? The compression program
gzip can only store one file.

I am using tetex 0.4 which is based on the previous version of
Web2c, so things may have changed. In my case the MakeTeX-scripts
look for filenames either in the filename database which rests in
/var/texfonts/ls-R or in the .map files in $TEXMF/fontname. I
have a file $TEXMF/fontname/special.map where I can specify
filenames and their locations for non-standard font names. For
example I have added the following:

tc		jknappen	tc
wasy		jknappen	sauter
stmary		jknappen	sauter
@c Added by pwyz (local stuff)
skt10		public		misc
gtib		public		misc
gtibsp		public		misc

This means: search skt10 in $TEXMF/fonts/source/public/misc.

Perhaps this helps.
\bye
