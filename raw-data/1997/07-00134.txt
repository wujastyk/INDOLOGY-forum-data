Dear Martin,

Regarding your request for the Sanskrit text of Matsyapuraa.na, chapters 
93-94 and 228-239 and Padmapuraa.na, chapters 78 to the end - 

I'll be going to the University of Toronto Library within the next five 
days. If you wish to send me your postal address, I'll photocopy what I 
can of the relevant material and send it to you.

Let me know.

Regards,

Joel.
