Most of the OCR programmes using the Omnifont approach (like Omnipage)
can - to a certain extent - also be trained for new characters. But try
Finereader Professional by Bitsoft. It can be trained to read all kinds
of characters (I even had good results with Tibetan print type) and it
seems to be better than the much more expensive Optopus. There is a
try&buy version available at the Bitsoft site (http://www.bitsoft.ru)
