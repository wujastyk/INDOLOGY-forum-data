Subject: Svara for Yajurveda mantra
Message-ID: <161227028039.23782.16993033667923633699.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In the Shuklayajurveda mantra 32.6, the second paada, yena sva.h ...
I found one reference with no svara for sva.h, while five others
have what appears like an anudaatta with a small vertical line on
the left side (|_____).  In the Rigveda for this mantra the word
has a svarita.

Could someone please explain the meaning of the yajurveda marking?
Thanks for any help you can provide.
