The svastika is one of the most widely distributed signs. I am
deeply sceptical of the assumption that it is a marker for any particular
ethnic group or that it `belongs' to any particular group.

In fact, I remember reading a claim that if young children, not exposed
to this sign, are left to freely doodle, this is one of the doodles that
occurs very commonly. I don't know if this is indeed true. Can anyone
confirm or deny this. [If true, it seems that this is worth being
publicized more.]
