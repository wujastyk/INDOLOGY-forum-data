Just a brief note (probably well-known amongst specialist, but...)

The famous sequence of women dancing with keris in the film TRANCE AND
DANCE IN BALI by M. Mead is a bit of a fabrication, as well as history.

As Bateson wrote in 1942: "We had seen women dance with krisses at temple
festivals at night and had observed that their dancing, though nominally
the same as that of the men, was fundamentally different ... we ...
suggested ... that they should include in their performance some women
with krisses.  This they did without any hesitation, but by 1939 the women
were an established part of the performance."  (Bateson and Mead, 1942,
p.167: BALINESE CHARACTER: A PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS)
