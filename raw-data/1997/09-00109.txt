Hi,

andcomputer noise.

>  I would like to explore this phenomenon, in more detail, with a view
to

I have come across a very old email 1994 in my trawl through the
internet which originated from your group - do you know of any other
literature? have you carried on the work?

> As a starting point I have classified computer noise as originating
from
> three sources.
> 1      ' Mechnical ' most notable keyboard and mouse clicks.
> 2       Software itself (eg windows opening, 'customisation' of sounds

by
> enthusiasts, mail delivery)
> 3       'Hardware' - fans and disc whirring
>
> Variables which are likely to effect the degree of irritation include;

> 1       the source of the sound (if you are creating it, it is less
noticeable).
> 2       extent of control over the environment
> 3       length of exposure
> 4       characteristics of the noise

> Cheers
