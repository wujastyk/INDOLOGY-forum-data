	That's highly improbable. The Indian word for tin is trapu (AV) and
kastIra, appearing only in lexicography, is borrowed from the Greek
kassiteros (Hom.), perhaps via the Latin cassiterum. According are
Mayrhofer (KEWA) and Chantraine (DELG). (Eurindian common origin is
impossible, the Greek 'k' is palatalized in Sanskrit)
