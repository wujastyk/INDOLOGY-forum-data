My comment: I am very grateful to Prof. Schlingloff for the booklet German 
Indologists which I found very useful. I confess that I have had no grim 
thought while perusing it! Just for information: about three or four 
years ago Russian Academy published two huge volumes on Orientalists in 
Russia, much alike to Prof. Schlingloff's work. I do not know yet about any 
adverse reaction towards this Russian publication.
