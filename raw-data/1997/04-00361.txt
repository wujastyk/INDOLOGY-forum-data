I've been away and am late in the conversational Sanskrit discussion so I'm
sorry if my question has already been dealt with, but I'd very much like to
hear from Sanskritists familiar with the current Sanskrit pronunciation in
various parts of India how the vowels "ai" and "au" are pronounced in the
different areas.
