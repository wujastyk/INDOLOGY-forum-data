Subject: wives celebrating for husbands' longevity

Hi,
A ceremial fast is observed by women when the sun passes from aquarius to pisces, praying
for the longevity of their husbands (the confluence of maaci and panguni  or maagha and phalguna months). This is the Tamil tradition. This is called kAraTai-y-aan-nOnbu. In Skt. karaTa connotes a royal dynasty.
Are there similar festivals observed in other parts of Indian subcontinent?
Regards, Kalyanaraman.
