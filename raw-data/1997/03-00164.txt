Subject: star "aardraa" and Tamil calendar

In his book, Ananda-Tandava of Siva-Sadanrttamurti (page 31), Kamil Zvelebil
writes, "The star aardraa (lit. 'wet, soft), representing Ziva, was once the
initial star of reckoning in the stellar calendar of the Tamils;..". He does
not cite any reference for this statement. Does anybody know the source for
such a conclusion? Thanks.
