Subject: [ADMIN] new listserv options
Message-ID: <161227032450.23782.7334488210009943429.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The new software running our INDOLOGY group has a couple of options which
were not available before.  In addition to being able to choose whether to
have INDOLOGY come in as separate emails, or as a digest, you can also
choose just to have the subject headers gathered together.  Also, you have
new control over the structure of the email headers of the incoming
messages; for example you could have them all say INDOLOGY instead of the
name of the original sender.  A particularly subversive new feature (could
be very tempting sometimes) is that you can instruct listserv not to send
you messages with a particular subject line.  In effect, you can censor
your own subscription!

To find out more, send the message

   help

to

  listserv at liverpool.ac.uk

You will receive basic help, plus instructions on how to get more detailed
help.  (For example, the message "info refcard" will make listserv send
you a useful brief reference card of commands.)


All the best,
Dominik
