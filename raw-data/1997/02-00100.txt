Beatrice,

There are three problems with saying this:

1. there are also [virile, young] bulls

2.  vaZA' cows are strictly "non-pregnant" rather than "old, barren" [cf.
Falk, Jamison]

3.  both are explicitly "food"

So, I take the passage to be a little ambiguous [i.e., metaphorical],
admittedly, but about "beef-eating" in some sense.

George
