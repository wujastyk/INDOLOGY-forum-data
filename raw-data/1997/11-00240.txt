I was under the impression that the original poster was quoting Caldwell
himself. I thought the term Dravidian was coined by Caldwell in his com-
parative Dravidian grammar (1st ed. in 1856?) from (Sanskrit) draviDa,
which itself was somehow related to damila? Is that correct?

Incidentally is there a Dravidian term for Dravidian? Was the genetic link
of the dravidian languages traditionally perceived by their speakers before
Caldwell?
