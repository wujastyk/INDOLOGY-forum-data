namaste,

Recently a new mailing list (sanskrit-l at hindunet.org) has been started
(announcement came on the Indology List) to assist learning of simple
spoken Sanskrit. The subscribers of the list get daily five sentences
along with a Sanskrit quotation.

Now, these sentences are available as simple HTML text files
in Devanagari ! These pages use XDVNG font developed by
Sri Sandeep Sibal (for Unix) and Sri Arun Gupta (for Windows and Macintosh).

** Check out http://rbhatnagar.ececs.uc.edu:8080/sanskrit/mlist.html **

Of late, magazines, newspapers etc. in Indian languages are appearing
in this format (HTML text file with a font). One needs Netscape 3.0
upwards or Internet Explorer 3.0 to view these files in the native
language fonts.

- Raghavendra.
