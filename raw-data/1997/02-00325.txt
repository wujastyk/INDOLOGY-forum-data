Dear Professor Tokunaga and Dear Indology Colleagues,

I find that this is a VERY alarming situation.

I understand very well the feeling of Professor Tokunaga, but I think
that this is not only a trouble that happens to him, but to all the
Indologist community, and more generally to all the researchers
working in the fields of humanities.

If the files that that campany in Munich is intending to put into their
CD-ROMs are taken from the free on-line e-texts that are the results of
incalculable and invaluable efforts of many scholars -- and I am almost
sure that this is the case, and I think that it is not very difficult to
prove it --, even if they don't intend to make commercial profit from
their CD-ROMs, they MUST ask the permission of the authors of these
e-texts to do so. If they don't do that, we should all do some action to
stop their piracy. Free and on-line e-texts are so important for all of
us that we should do all what we can do to protect them and their authors.

I don't know for the moment what *I* can do personally, but at least I
would like to repeat all my gratitude to Professor Tokunaga and the
authors of the other e-texts, and also, I would dare ask Professor
Tokunaga to not limit the distribution of his e-texts -- and encourage
him to fight against this piracy, because, I am sure, all of us are on his
side...!
