"Jyotishi / http://www.flex.com/~jai Om Shanti" is of course our good
old Jai Maharaj again. Someone else (shame that I dont' remember who -
brilliant tip!) already had suggested here that we should have a look at
the document http://www.loop.com/~taxi/jayfaq.txt - the Jai Maharaj
Frequently Asked Questions Sheet. I suggest that this be made compulsory
reading for Indology list members. JM surely knows what he's talking
about, when he mentions egos and ridicule - the above-mentioned text
documents quite seriously high-level ego stuff. Fine bedtime reading.
(It says Jai Maharaj is not a Vedic astrologer at all, but merely a kook
who bothers lists because he wants attention. Is this so?)
