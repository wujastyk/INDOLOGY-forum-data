Message-ID: <161227031464.23782.15739126232254106984.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am looking for renditions of the K.r.s.na story from outside
Puranic/Epic/Vaishnava literature (ie from Buddhist, Jain, Shaivite or any
other sources).
Can anyone kindly assist me with any references?   

Thanks.   Edwin Bryant
