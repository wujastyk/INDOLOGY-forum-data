Dear Dr, Tomabechi,

I tried to access the following address you give in your announcement.

 http://www.unil.ch/orient/IABS/1ST-CIRC.HTM.

Unvortunately I have got back the message "Not found - file doesn't exist
or is read protected"

If you tell me how to get more information on the conference, I am grateful
to you.
