Dear Prof. Bh.Krishnamurti,

You complain that you do not get a reply from
Japan. Something is wrong about the connection between India
and Japan. I have sent my mail repeatedly, but every time it
has been rejected.

I am trying to find the e-mail address of Kodama-kun.
Please be patient a little more.

It was very nice to hear from you anyway.

With best regards,
