What one does in a tIrtha is snAna. One immerses his whole body including
head under water. In current usage(?) this is not called abhiSEka. abhiSEka
is usally performed by some body else to the person who is undergoing it.
It is snapana rather than snAna. But the slokas you have quoted from MBh
about arjuna (not ydhiSThira) have to be carefully gone into. It looks as
though the word abhiSEka has been used for snAna. But the following slokas
from a slightly earlier chapter clarify what I am saying. ( I am not giving
chapter and verse because I do not have the critical edition)

I am not wellversed in the Greek religion. I cannot say.
