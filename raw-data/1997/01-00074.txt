Regarding the query of Mr. Raynald Prevereau <raynaldp at bbsi.net> regarding
devanaagarii fonts for Macintosh, there is a font called Kanchi which is
available for Macintosh. I last saw the file at the Yamada Language
Center site. The file can be directed accessed at the following URL:

	    http://babel.uoregon.edu/yamada/fonts/hindi.html

As well as fonts for other South Asian languages, the Yamada archive hosts
a number of other language fonts. The general URLM for the Yamada Language
Center is:

	    http://babel.uoregon.edu/yamada

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
