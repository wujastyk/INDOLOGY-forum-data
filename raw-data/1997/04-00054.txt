According to KathAsaritsAgara 5.3.158-161 & 169-171, string made of cow's
gut were used on the vINA : the sight of a caNDAla bearing a load of cow's

fisherman's family (dAza-kula-) because she was cursed for having cut with
her teeth a string made of dried cow's gut while installing it on her vINA :
