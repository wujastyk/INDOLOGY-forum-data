Hello,

In the year 1984/85 there was a series of publications on the subject India/Indology by Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg. The occasion was the 35th anniversary of GDR. Many of these texts were previously unpublished manuscripts of the missionaries Barholomaeus Ziegenbalg, Benjamin Schultze a.o., who travelled the South of India during the first half of the 18th century.
My question is, how can I acquire some of these contributions, especially the works of the above mentioned persons. I have tried to find a contact at the Institute for Indoligy at Halle Univ., but it seems that none of the colleges there has an e-mail address.
I will be thankful for any help in acquiring these texts.

With friendly greetings,
Sreenivas
