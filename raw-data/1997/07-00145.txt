Dear John,
I would like to ask you whether it would be possible to reserve any 
locum for me in Dubrovnik between 10.08 - 18.08 (the cheaper the 
better) ? My situation is as follows : I applied to Batory Foundation 
and now I am after the first selection. The final result will be 
known in the first week of August so comparatively late. So I have 
reserved the plane and I have a good hope to meet you soon.
Thank you again for your recommendation letter. I am sending my best 
kisses to both of you. Iwona.
