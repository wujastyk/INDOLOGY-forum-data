Dear colleagues,

I am looking for references dealing with the following subjects, on which I
have no expertise, and would very much appreciate any suggestions from the
members of the list.

1. The genre of qawwali in Urdu
2. Critical studies of Indian and Pakistani literature written in English

Thanks in advance,
