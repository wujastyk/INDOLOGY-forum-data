Instead of the expected form "sattiyam", all the editions in my possession read "satiiyam" in ChU 8,3,5 except B"ohtlingk's and Senart's eds. which read "sattiyam". Even so, the point of the passage is the etymological analyzation of the word "satyam" into "sat" + "ti" + "yam", partly based on the phenomenon of the duplication of the first consonant of a consonant group in pronounciation (e.g. aggni for agni). Cf. Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik I, p. 112f. and Tsuji, Veda-gaku Ronso, p. 34f.
