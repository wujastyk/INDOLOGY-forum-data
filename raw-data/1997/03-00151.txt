Dear Ms. Stark-Wild,

D.K. Agencies can supply you with most of the INDIAN newspapers on 
microfilms as we are already doing for other libraries world-over.
Please let us know as to which range of years of these newspapers you 
are looking for on microforms. As my memory goes "Times of India" is 
available on microform for more than 80 years. They are also working 
on the CD-ROM project, though I don't have the latest of information 
on their success on CD-ROM project.

Regards,
Surya P. Mittal
