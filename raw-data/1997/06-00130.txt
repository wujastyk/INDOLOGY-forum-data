The following message is from someone who needs help compiling the C
pre-processor used for the LaTeX+Tibetan text processing system.  If you
can help, please send your reply not to me (Dominik), nor to INDOLOGY, but
directly to the originator of the query, Angel Munoz
(constisevilla at arrakis.es). 

I confess that I am forwarding this to the list partly because I so
enjoyed the machine translation.  How could I ever hold a grudge against
the groins of anyone so polite?

Dominik

I request to her answer to some problems related to their your program
"Latex-tibetan" and "Sirlim":
I have attempted to compile it with "Turbo c ++", and not me has been
possible by giving mistakes, which is the version with the one which was
created, or with which can be compiled?
in which operative systems operates?
there are other versions but recent of these programs?
where I can find them?
forgive my groins, since not I speak it, and this has been translated by
a computer
thank you very much
