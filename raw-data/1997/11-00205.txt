>>Towns are noisy. Can puTabhEdana be (karNa)puTabhEdana ?

>sarma.

puTa seems to mean a packet. e.g. puTa-pAkam in ayurveda
refers to the process of infusion in a covered pot.
It is likely that AmarakOza's reference to puTa-bhEdana
should relate to unpacking the wares from a bundle in
a marketplace or customs port?
regards.
