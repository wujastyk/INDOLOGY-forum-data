Sri Lankan Tamil dialect maintains the distinction between "r" and "R". So
does Malayalam. Malayalam also maintains alveolar stop "R" in geminate ("RR"
pronounced like English "tt") and in post-nasal ("n2R" pronounced as English
"nd") contexts. I believe this also applies to some dialects in parts of
Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts.
