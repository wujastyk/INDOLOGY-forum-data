Dear Indology netters,

excuse me for asking a non-indological question, but I am pretty hard up for
an answer. Could anybody explain the expression "layback" in the following
sentence:

"Happy hours, discount drinks and irresponsible promotions such as laybacks
were found to be a prime cause of violence in Australia."

Thanx in advance!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
