I do not know if it is right for Nepal Govt. to demand a price...
Maybe, both Nepal and India Govts. should demand that world citizens/
american universities and other institutions should help UNESCO preserve
the ancient mss. as world heritage documents, just as world heritage
sites are sought to be preserved as national monuments...

Maybe the developed country institutions can do a lot more in making
the docs. available freely on the internet as UPEnn is attempting to
do...

Sarasvati Sindhu Research Centre, Chennai will be willing to digitize
and 'webbify' in cooperation with librarires... Internet has the
potential to be used by indologists as the indology library on demand.
<I will post later on a new website>

I agree with Bijoy; 'rescue' is not the bon mot. It can be replaced by
'preserve, protect and disseminate'.
