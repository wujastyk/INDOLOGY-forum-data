Although I think this is not what Dominique meant, what he seems to says in
his first line is that "Argentina" is derived from "Arjuna". Of course,
what he shows -- that they have the same ROOT (or are cognate) -- is an
entirely different matter! I say this only to nip in the bud any possible
encouragement of this type of nonsense seen recently on this list by
certain people who would not recognize a careful historical linguistic
argument if -- to quote an old college professor of mine -- it jumped up
and bit them on the ass!
