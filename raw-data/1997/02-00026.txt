I sometimes got e-mails from
kapila at ignca.ernet.in (Kapila Vatsyayan, the Academic Director)
ranjan at ignca.ernet.in (Neena Ranjan, Secretary)

but it is only one way, i.e., my messages to them do not seem to have
been delivered even though I got no message of 'undelivered mail'. 

Since I worked there last September I know the problem.  They had some
problem in mail spool and they could not properly handle incoming mails.
I hope they solve the problem before I get there next September!
