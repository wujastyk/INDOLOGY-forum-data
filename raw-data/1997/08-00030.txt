Dear colleagues,

I will be on research leave until January, 1998. During this period I can
be reached at my usual mailing, fax  and email addresses, however I will
not be available at my usual telephone number.

During this period I will also discontinue my subscription to this list. I
look forward to rejoining it in January.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
