Subject: Question about vikrtis in Vedaadhyayana
Message-ID: <161227031915.23782.4613680548050061608.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Shaunakiiya Caturadhyaayikaa suutra 4.108 relates to the value of the
recitation (adhyayana) of Krama :  it is meant to firm up one's control of
the Samhitaa and the Pada recitations.  I have not seen any sources which
prescribe the use of the Vik.rtipaa.thas in ritual.  Would like to know if
such prescriptions are found anywhere.
