Hi!

This message is w.r.t my earlier posting( Posted on the evening
of the 19th)....when I said integer, I meant positive number i.e.
2**n -1 where n is an integer should be interprested as 2**n-1
where n is a positive number.

   I believe that the mistake has occured in two different places.
I apologize for the confusion


Krishna
