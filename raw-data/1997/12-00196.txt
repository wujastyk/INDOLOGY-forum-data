 For the meaning requested the Madras Tamil Lexicon has the following
 entrance:

 avattam2, n. prob ava-sthaa.  Evil, calamity; keeTu. avatta.nkaL
 viLaiyum (tiv. tiruvaay. 10, 3, 9).

 I guess the reference is maNavALamAmun_ikaL, tiruvAymol_i nURRantAti,
 cen_n_ai:  kaNEca accukkUTam, 1920.

 Hope that is helpful

 All the best
