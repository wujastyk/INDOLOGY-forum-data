Subject: ANNOUNCE: upgrade of SKT-series fonts
Message-ID: <161227029011.23782.1890326543557421323.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


ANNOUNCE: Upgrade of SKT-series Devanagari font package.

In response to user requests, this package has undergone major changes:

 o  Accents for ALL Vedas (23 symbols in devanagari, 25 in roman).
    In transliteration the *form* follows that of the nagari.

 o  Accent marking in colour or grey shading.

 o  Choice of basic character forms (21), e.g. for a .r .na.

 o  Wide selection of samyoga forms (70 interacting options):
    a table in the documentation lists more than one thousand 
    samyogas together with their optional forms in devanagari.

 o  Range of inter- and intra-syllable spacing.

 o  Dynamic option selection (replaces skt.opt file).

The upgraded files are currently on CTAN in the /language/sanskrit
subdirectory.  A 600-kByte 600-dpi PostScript print file of the 
documentation and samples is available by anonymous ftp from:

      ftp://ftp.nacdh4.nac.ac.za/wikner/sktdoc.ps600

This site is rather overloaded: you may find the Jaguar temporary
site more accessible:

      ftp://t.ms.uky.edu/incoming/sanskrit/sktdoc.ps600

Charles Wikner.
