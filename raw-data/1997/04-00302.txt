	You are certainly not alone in thinking about precedents such as
these being set for the future. But then, since 1969 as I can remember, 
no opportunity seems to have been missed to set as precedent, things
clearly in open violation of the spirit of the Constitution - foisting of
Chief Ministers on states, Governors reporting to Prime Minister, 
Department Secretaries (IAS cadres) taking orders from Party chiefs, open
support of dissidence and so on. In the current situation, it may not be
too much to expect Annual Elections hence forth.
