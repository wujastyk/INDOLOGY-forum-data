This raises an interesting point. Many attribute a prejudice in North India 
against the sarangi (as distinct from a prejudice against sarangi players) 
to the 'polluting' gut strings. Given that gut strings were standard for 
the violin in the nineteenth century, did this cause a problem in South 
India? Did Indian violinists quickly adopt metal wires for stings?

This relates to an earlier unanswered post about the introduction of metal 
stings, and the production of wire in general in India. The 
Sangitaratnakara refers to wound strings of silk, and eleventh century 
sculptures sometimes clearly show that stirngs were made of a wound 
substance (silk or even grass, as suggested by earlier, non-musicological 
texts).
