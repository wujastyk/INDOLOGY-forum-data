if you accept the idea that ot exist for a thing means to exchange energy, a
perpetuum mobile, which has no energy exchange, is impossible because of its
obsoleteness

I don't want to advocate any use of violence, but as far as we know a
jIvanmukTa wouldn't mind. Since his/her actions and words are
incomprehensible, there would be no reason to suppose that s/he would protest.
Maybe s/he welcomes it.There's a story about Nagarjuna that his beheading
caused him to start living again several hundred years later and of course
write many more holy scriptures. BTW a jIvanmukTa could be capable of writing
understandable texts, since a text doesn't have to reveal the actual
intentions of the person who wrote it. Those are fleeting and entirely
personal.
