Subject: Rudra as animal killer
Message-ID: <161227034305.23782.6960325083495165812.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the net,

in Mbh. 7.18.35, we get the following verse:

tad babhau raudra b-ibhatsa.m b-ibhatsor y-anam -ahave /
-akr-i.da iva rudrasya ghnata.h k-al-atyaye pa/s-un //

Does anyone know about any other places where Rudra kills animals
"k-al-atyaye"? I would also be interested in literature discussing Rudra's
role as an animal killer.

Thank you for any help!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
