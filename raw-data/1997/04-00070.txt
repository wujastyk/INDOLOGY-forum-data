These are the four viparyaasas, usually translated as "perversions" but
meaning conceptual reversals. I'm not sure, off-hand, if these are listed
in early Pali texts (I can't remember them there), but they do appear in
early Prajnaparamita literature and other Mahayana texts. Check in
Edgerton's Buddhist-hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary under viparyaasa for
references (I don't have one in my office or I would have checked for you).
