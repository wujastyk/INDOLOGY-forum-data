	It appears I have actually misunderstanded you.

	I agree.

	That's right, they have done it. But the problem is the size and
homogeneity of their corpus, both too small. And their analysis of
repetitions, standardized formulas, &c. as mnemotecnics is nothing but an
hypothesis. That can be just a matter of rhetoric: see Shakespeare's
"Honourable men", see RV I, 80 with "arcann anu svarAjyam" and many others.
The true base of their hypothesis is "mnemotecnics are necessary", perhaps
wrong ... (but the story of Truman Capote reported here is a well known
"tour de magie").

	Not already, but until an other one would be more credible by me.
Firstly, I believe using statistics on a text before a stylistic and
pragmatic study is a methodological mistake. Secondly, I'm sure (but
perhaps I'm wrong) that using "cutting and counting" on human productions
is a paranoical behaviour because human productions are never context-free
...
