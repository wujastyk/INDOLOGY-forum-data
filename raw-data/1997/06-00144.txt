Dear Tina,

In case you missed this. If you can't get on the web site (which seems to
deal with books in English), perhaps you could send e-mail to him.

Glad to hear that you are going to Europe with your daugther. This is the
sort of activity that both of you will be completely natural doing (or you
aren't doing it right.)

>Only a few days back I downloaded my messages of Indology and 
>Sasialit as I had not been using my this account for past 
>sometime.  This was so because I was busy with our software for 
>USMARC and my planned trip to the USA to attend to ALA-Annual 
>Conference.

>It was a matter of great pleasure and to an extent of pride to be 
>a topic of discussion on "Indology".

>My personal deep bows and many thanks on behalf of D. K. Agencies 
>to all those who responded to the email of Jacob Baltuch.

>Such comments have always driven us to further improve upon our 
>services.  The new development at DKA after launching "online 
>booksearch" at our website "http://www.dkagencies.com/booksearch" 
>is that now we are capable of giving bibliographic data of Indian 
>publications in English language in USMARC format.
>
>For sample data, please visit:

>Option (1) on this page does not work with MS I.E., for which 
>please excuse us.  But we hope the gap will be filled in by 
>option (3) at least for IBM-compatible users.
>
>Jacob, we, at DKA, would also receive with equal enthusiasm the 
>criticisms, if any, received by you directly, as those are always 
>something to learn from.
>
>I request all of you to update your address books to show our 
>email address as: <custserv at dkagencies.com> instead of 
><indbook.dka at axcess.net.in>.  We wish to phase-out the 
><indbook.dka at axcess.net.in> on account of slow transmission speed.

>Thanks again,
