It comes from a famous Japanese proverb:
 "mi-zaru, iwa-zaru, kika-zaru",
the literal meaning of which is
"Not seeing, not saying, not hearing."

The Japanese equivalent of monkey is "saru",
which is sometimes pronounced  "zaru" 
especially when used as last member of a compound; 
e.g. "kani-kui zaru" (a crab-eating macaque).

And again "zaru" means "not", 
so "mi-zaru" has a double meaning:
"not seeing" and "mi-monkey".
It is a kind of play on words.

Carvings of the three monkeys are familiar to Japanese.
