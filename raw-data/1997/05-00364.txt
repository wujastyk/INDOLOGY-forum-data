Yes. Almost everything that is said about varNas is an oversimplification.
Those who read only the texts probably do not realize it, and continue to 
think of all brahmins as one homogeneous group. Those who research the
social reality understand how complicated the power relationships within
the castes really are.

to be a result of a curse that SankarAcArya is supposed to have laid on
some relatives of his, barring them from Vedic study. Is this correct?
