I am afraid these combinations are commonplace too!
They cannot be pronounced with an M sound.

mna     samaamnaaya (collection), aamnaaya (veda)
mya     ramya(pleasant), gamya(reachable) etc.
mra     aamra (mango), namra (humble)
mla     aamla (sour)

However,

mva     This I cannot think of right now! Perhaps it survives!
