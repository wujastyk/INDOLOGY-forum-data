I misunderstood the nature of the model proposed by Bh. Krishnamurthy. I
thought he was presenting a more general model than he actually intended.

In any case, here are some comments regarding his specific questions.

<<5.It is difficult to give all the arguments here. What I need is more
information on (a)When was aaytam first found in the writing system?  (b)
why was it written with three circles, similar to Skt. visarga? (c) how does
one reconstrcut its phonetics in Old and Medeival Tamil? (d) Since h+P
(voiceless stop), contrasts with PP and P, h must have been a phoneme in
Early Tamil unlike the short u and short i with which Tolk classified it as
caarpeZuttu.

6. After TVB I hav been using *w for PDr because I think it was phonetically
a bilabial in PDr and not a labiodental. >>

According to Tolkappiyam, H occurs only following a short vowel and preceding
one of the six hard consonants/obstruents, k, c, T, t, p, and R or during
puNarcci involving l and L with t (Tol. 1.2.5-6). Further Tol.1.3.19 says
that the dependent letters have their birth in the same place as the leeters
they are dependent on. This means Aytam is born in the same place as the
corresponding  hard consonant. Thus H occurs only in association with the six
hard consonants.  If Tolkappiyar is right, then this goes against  BhK's
