Parents know that a darker skinned girl will not be treated as well by her
inlaws (unless of course, they are even darker than she is).  Discimination
on the basis of color seems, unfortunately, fairly universal (except
amongst African tribes perhaps?).  An Indian family I know visited a beach
in Maryland in the late 1950's.  The wife and kids who were fairly light
skinned were allowed on the beach, but the husband who was darker was
forbidden to enter.  They all went home.

Remember, "only mad dogs and English men"!  Even after 23 years in the US,
I still instinctively avoid basking in the sun.  Besides, I know, that even
today, if I traveled 50 miles away from the city, I would have trouble if I
"tanned" further.  Indians are definitely very sensitive to nuances in skin
color.  But here in the United States "color" is an indication of race, and
is equated with lack of intelligence and poor social status.
