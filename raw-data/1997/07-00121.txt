Requesting the presence of divinity in a localized form, here
and now, occurs both in Saiva and Vaishnava worlds.
This aagamic practice is detailed in R. H. Davis' book.
The mudras by a sivacharyar doing an aatmartha puja are also included.

PS:
I don't know whether the following has anything on Kumbhabhishekam
"eye-opening" rituals. But we can ask the sthapatis/sivacharyars in USA temples.
May be Dr. Joanne P. Waghorne, N. Carolina knows too. She is studying the
colonial and modern temple rituals.
