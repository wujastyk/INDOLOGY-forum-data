I have tried twice to download the file MAJJHIMA.ZIP from
scorpio.gold.ac.uk, but both times the compressed file I have got seems
to be corrupted. With (Unix) unzip I get the error message:

----------------------------------------------------

pkunzip under DOS is not better:

-----------------------------------------------------------

As last resort I have used Winzip from within Windows95. But all in
vain. Maybe this is a transmission problem (but I have downloaded the
file with different clients [lynx, ncftp] from different machines). So
I can't figure out if the problem is on my side or if the file on the
server is bad.

My question to you: Is there anybody out there who succeeded in
uncompressing this file?
