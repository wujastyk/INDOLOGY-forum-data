This is where you are back in self-rationalization.
In some sense we do this mImAmSA all the time.
The question that you might ask is "what is the truth",
or in this sense what is the right conduct.  Is it the
right conduct to move the stuff away or try to preserve
it locally?  Moving the stuff away has been called "rescue"
in these discussions and I object to such conduct.

I agree that the color of skin or nationality has
no bearing on whose property it is.  Geographic
location in the form of origin has.
