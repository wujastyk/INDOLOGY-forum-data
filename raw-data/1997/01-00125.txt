You will find a useful free utility for typing with special characters and
fonts at:

http://www.sil.org/computing/silkey.html

For those of you that use Windows there is a similar program at the same
site, which is well worth a look-around in any case.

It takes a bit of simple programming to make Silkey work. If anybody needs
a hand I'll be happy to help.

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(XIV Dalai Lama)
