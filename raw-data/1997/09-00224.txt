1. send a message to this address:

LISTSERV at LISTSERV.LIV.AC.UK

2. in the body of the message, put these words only:

SET INDOLOGY DIGEST

3. send it.  You'll get a confirmation from the mother computer
advising you of your settings.

Also note, you can toggle back to nodigest by doing the same thing,
sending this message:

SET INDOLOGY NODIGEST

If you do that, you'll first get a cumulative digest for all the
posts up to that point (since the prior digest -- probably sent out
every night at midnight, or something -- anyway that's fairly common
for listservs, but may vary); and then you'll again be getting the
individual messages.

Posting this, as others may wonder.

By the way, now that this is a listserv instead of a listproc, some
readers may be interested in this command (which can be sent to the
same LISTSERV@ mother computer address):

REVIEW INDOLOGY BY COUNTRY

That will generate (i.e., will have send back to you in a jiffy) a
listing of the subscribers & their addresses, itemized by country.
Quite a hefty list . . .

cheers,
d.i.
