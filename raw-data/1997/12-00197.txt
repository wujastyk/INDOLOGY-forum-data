The relation of avattam to skt. avastha, I think, is correct.

In telugu 'vAdu cAlA/nAnA avasthalu paDDADu' means "He has undergone many/
various type of difficulties/dire straits". One of the meanings of
upasarga 'ava' is low or down. 'avastha' means being low or down. A man in
difficulties is low or down.

sarma.
