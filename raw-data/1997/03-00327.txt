Francois Patte has kindly made available a Mac executable for the current
version of the Velthuis TeX Devanagari (including hyphenation).

This is now available via the INDOLOGY web site, under "Supplementary
files...".  See file "Devanagari.sea.hqx[.readme]".
This can also be fetched by ftp directly from

  ftp.ucl.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/software
