With no intent of offense, there is a phrase "allam .gallam" meaning
"nonsense", as in the Urdu "allam .gallam bakanaa" (= to talk nonsense).
But I doubt this would be found in an Islamic text. In Arabic "`alim"
means "wise, one who knows" (an epithet applied to God) and "aalam" means
"world" (as in the epithet of a Mu.gal emperor "Aalamgiir"), so roughly
"`alim aalam" would mean "one who knows the world/knower of
everything(?)". Could very well be the name of a software company.
