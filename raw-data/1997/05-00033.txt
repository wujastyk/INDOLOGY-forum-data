It seems the obsession with skin and hair shades is only Western and
Dominique's outburst about  the lack of response does not make sense to
me. Similarly while Western culture including  the  bible is so obsessed
with homosexuality there is no such attention paid in Indian literature
and there are no words corresponding to gay or lesbians as well. The
recent movie "Kama Sutra" is an exception and imported concept and it
shows in the resentment that Indians have for the movie.

Indian have basically two skin colors, fair(feminine)  and dark
(masculine) and do not have words for any minor variations, just like
you have to go to an eskimo to find 20 words for snow. 


Have a peaceful and prosperous day.
