Agree, but I was speaking specifically of the needs/requirements of WESTERN
students. A bit of loud reading out of a book is normally the most oral
their Sanskrit gets!

Agree again. I think this variation has a cultural identity value, and
should not be rashly suppressed in favor of a "reconstructed" pronunciation
having its origin in the head of western phoneticians. But as I said that
was not the issue.

Assuredly, I'll stick to Swenglish, or even try English in worst cases! I
was talking about what level of perfection would be worthwhile for loud
reading, and only compared that to ESL use. In actual fact I, as a
practicing Buddhist, recite in Sanskrit quite often -- preferring
reasonably correct Sanskrit to crappy Tibetan, or English, until the day a
Swedish translation of the relevant texts is available.
