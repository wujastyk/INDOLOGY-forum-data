I would recommend Jadgdish Dave's Colloquial Gujarati: A Complete Language
Course (Routledge, 1995), which we use at the Univ. of Penn. to teach the
first year Gujarati course.  It comes with a cassette.  The dialogs and
excercises are good and pretty natural and colloquial, though somewhat
England oriented.  George Cardona
