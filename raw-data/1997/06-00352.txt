Excerpts from
Global Dharm News Digest
HINDUISM TODAY, April 1993

   "A 1992 Motilal Banarsidass newsletter reports that the oldest known
civilization yet recently discovered at Nevali Cori in Turkey has close
similarities with the Rg Vedic civilization, according to Dr. B. G. Sidharth,
Director General of the Hyderabad-based B. M. Birla Science Center.
   "Dr. Sidharth, who recently visited the excavation site near Ataturk Dam,
gave a report to the United News of India that the Nevali Cori people could
be dated back as far as 7,000 BCE, when the earth was in the last phase of
the great ice age.  While others were primitive nomads, the Nevali Cori
people were domestic, used lamps and played a dice game.  Excavations showed
definite "Sanskritic" influence which could be traced to 2,000 BCE --
inscriptions with names of Vedic Deities, such as Indra, Mitra, Varuna and
Dasaratha, and horse-racing terms.
   "A major find in the excavation was a large head sculpted from limestone
with features identical to that of an Indian Vedic priest.  The head was
clean shaven and had the characteristic tuft of hair, an ancient Vedic custom
and common to this day in India."
