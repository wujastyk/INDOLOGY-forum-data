The above discussion suddenly reminds me too that mention way made of a
Buddhist jataka variant on some facet of Krishna's life.  Checking my HD
memory, this is all I can recover: Jim Hartzell
<jh at cubsps.bio.columbia.edu>, in 1995 a graduate student at Columbia
university, was the source of this information, but I never followed up to
acquire the actual citation.
