MBh 1.155.41-2, 50 in van Buitenen's translation:

    Thereupon a young maiden arose from the center of the altar, the
    well-favored and beautiful Daughter of the Paa~ncaalas,
    heart-fetching, with a waist shaped like an altar. She was dark
    ["syaamaa], with eyes like lotus petals, her hair glossy black and
    curling...Her they called K.r.s.naa, for she was dark of complexion
    [k.r.s.nety evaabruvan k.r.s.naa.m k.r.s.naabhuut saa hi var.nata.h].
