Subscribers to this list either believe in or take very seriously
(or both) all kinds of things that many of their academic colleagues
(and not only their academic scientific colleagues) regard as
ludicrous, discredited and not worthy of study.  That some of
these subscribers should rush to distance themselves from the
topic of vimanas is as sociologically interesting as it is
inconsistent.
