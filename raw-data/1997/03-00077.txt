Dear Netters,

a group of people here (including me) are trying to prepare a seminar on the
problems related with cultural contact between Westerners and South Asians.
We are thinking in terms of cultural challenges seen from the point of view
of both sides. Westerners and South Asians deal with each other in a number
of contexts - business, politics etc. Could any of you refer me to
persons/institutions/literature that deal with this kind of problems?

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
