Notice of U. S. Library of Congress Mellon Fellowships
**************************************************************************

                   LIBRARY SEEKS APPLICATIONS FOR NEW MELLON
                    FOREIGN AREA FELLOWSHIP RESEARCH AWARDS

        The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded the Library of
Congress $330,000 to enable it to seek applications for the Mellon
Foreign Area fellowship research awards, aimed at U.S. citizens with
Ph.D degrees who are interested in pursuing research in the Library's
unrivaled foreign-language and area studies collections. The Mellon
Foundation grant finances three years of competition for the
fellowships.

        In addition to the requirements of U.S. citizenship and
possession of a doctoral degree, the awards are for scholars who are
proposing or working on a second major research project with a focus on
foreign-language materials.  The fellowships will last from five to
eleven months and can begin no sooner than Aug. 1, 1997. Stipends of
$3,000 per month, up to a maximum of $33,000 for eleven months, will
be awarded and may be used to extend the research period supported by
other funds.

        "These fellowships for younger scholars will play a major role
in sustaining our understanding of other cultures at a critical time,"
said Director of Scholarly Programs Prosser Gifford. "They also make
possible the arrival of fellows when we can provide new scholarly
facilities in the Jefferson Building." The Office of Scholarly Programs
will administer the program and ensure that fellows have opportunities to
meet other scholars with experience in the relevant language areas and
disciplines.

        Many of the Library's distinguished users are known for their
work in history, philosophy and culture of other countries, and they are
familiar with the richness of the Library's holdings, two-thirds of which
are in foreign languages encompassing all media--books, films, sound
recordings, maps, newspapers, periodicals and government documents.

        The Library of Congress is already committed to working with
foreign scholars pursuing research in the collections through its
Congressional Research Service and Law Library as well as through
support from the Soros, Korea and Thatcher foundations.

        Selection for the fellowships will be made by a five-member
committee including at least three outside members appointed by the
Librarian of Congress and chaired by the Director of Scholarly programs.
Mellon Foreign Area Fellows will be brought together once every month to
discuss work in progress, research strategies and findings.

        Fellows are expected to reside in the greater Washington area
during the course of their research and to devote full time to their
projects.  They will have access to special research facilities at the
Library of Congress.

        The application deadline is March 15, 1997. Forms may be
obtained from the Office of Scholarly Programs, Library of Congress,
101 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, DC 20540-4860;
telephone (202) 707-1517; fax (202) 707-3595;
e-mail pgif at loc.gov.

Applications may be submitted by mail, fax or e-mail.
