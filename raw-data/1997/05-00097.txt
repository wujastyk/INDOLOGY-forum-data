Brown referring to soil is a much less felicitous example than the other
two.  Soils can also be (in American English) black, yellow, etc.  In much
of my state of Virginia it is a beautiful red.  And in countries which
have undergone intensive agriculture for many centuries one can't assume
the soil's color is the same as it was in the time of some classic
literature.
