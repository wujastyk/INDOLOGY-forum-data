Subject: beef eating in the Veda
Message-ID: <161227028250.23782.11625130605704245316.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

OK it figures that vegetarianism is a logical and moral consequence of
ahimsa, but that is still different from the situation wrt _beef_ in the
Hindu tradition and in the Vedic times: the question here seems to be if
beef was taboo, while the eating of other meats, or at least of meat in
general, was not restricted. In that case it has nothing to do with ahimsa,
and the question of beef vs. other meats has no bearing wrt meat eating vs.
ahimsa/vegetarianism. A distinction must be made between the Buddha's
prohibition of wilful killing, and prohibition of eating certain kinds of
food because they are seen as taboo or impure.

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(XIV Dalai Lama)
