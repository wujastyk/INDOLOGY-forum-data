        From all that, "idam" seems to be a good Eurindian word.
        About Dravidian forms "itu", "idi" or "idu", I don't know anything
but I'm dubious a link exists with skr. "idam" for two reasons:
        1) borrowing grammatical (tool) words is very rare (in fact, I
don't remember any example of it).
        2) with short words, the probability of a simple coincidence is
very high (we have examples all over the world).

        Hoping to help,
Dominique
