In 1969 a couple of Belgian ethnologist, Jean and Danielle Bourgeois,
found an edict of Ashoka near Jalalabad, eastern Afghanistan. It
is usually called Laghman I. While searching for it a few year later
Laghman II was found, but Laghman I was seen never again. The
Bourgeois couple (not a pun) should be now in its late fifties. They
may be in a position to clarify the exact spot, once they are traced.
Could someone with stronger ties to Belgian ethnologist or though
web searches help me in getting their address?
Thanks
