Even the earliest book printed in Indic characters,
"Doctrina christam en lingua malauar tamul" (Tamil
title - tampirAn vaNakkam), a 16 page publication
from Quilon dated 20.2.1577, seems to have had block-
printing only for the illustration... not surprising
since it is almost a century after Gutenberg... this 
book is in the Houghton library at Harvard.
