Does anyone know of good and reputable software shops in Delhi or elsewhere
in India for purchasing various India-produced software:  CDAC language
materials, CD Rom, etc.?  I shall be in India in March and again in July and
August and would very much like to look over what is being produced now:
especially for use in Sanskrit, art history, cultural history, religious
studies, etc. courses and for library materials?
