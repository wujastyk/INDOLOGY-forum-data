Ruth, could you check and see if the lates issue of History of Religion has
arrived? It should contain a review article by Bruce Lincoln on "Classifying
the Universe" by Brian K. Smith. If it is there, could you make a copy of
the review article and bring it here on Wednesday night? 

Sorry to bother you!
