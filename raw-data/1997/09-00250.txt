the Raj. The Party stood outside the mainstream of either nationalism or 
Muslim separation but it was overtaken by the political developments in 
the rest of India which finally led to its collapse in 1946. The Muslim 
League with its demand of Pakistan, a separate homeland for the Muslims

India by June 1948 had a disastrous effect on the situation in the
