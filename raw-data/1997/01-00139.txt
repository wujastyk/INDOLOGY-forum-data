Subject: Elephant processions, naaga temples
Message-ID: <161227028010.23782.16951657064558091247.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I received the following queries from a person planning to visit Kerala 
(especially the Trichur and Cochin areas probably from 10-14 February.

When are the elephants taken out in procession and in which areas? 

What are the addresses of snake shrines or naaga temples that one should 
visit? Are there privately owned sacred places falling in this category?

Any help that individuals knowledgeable about Kerala and its culture can 
provide will be gratefully received. If communication through fax or 
telephone is more convenient, kindly use the following numbers: fax: 
604-822-8937. Tel: 604-822-5185 or 604-274-5353.
