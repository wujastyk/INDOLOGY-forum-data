I think there is such a thing as photographic memory. Similar feats of
memorization were related about the Norwegian historian P. A. Munch (last
century), who allegedly got access to papers in the Vatican, but was not
allowed to copy them. Whereupon he learnt them by heart and copied them back
in his hotel room. He was also reportedly able to remember page upon page of
ordinary novels he had read in his youth. I discussed this phenomenon with a
psychologist, who said that the problem with such people was that they could
never forget anything, and therefore had various psychological discomforts.
As for music: Mozart reportedly heard a mass in the Vatican that was treated
as a "trade secret", so that the notes were not available to the public.
Mozart went home after hearing the mass and wrote it all down from memory.
He went back the next day to hear it once more, and discovered to his
chagrin that he had gotten one note wrong!

Any other memory lore out there?
