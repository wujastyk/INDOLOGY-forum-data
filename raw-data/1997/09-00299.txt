May it be just Persian for "[person] knowing the universe", a savant?
('aalem 'aalam )The spelling of the both words in modern Persian may be the same.

Could someone help me to find out what "Aalim aalam" means in Islam? Some
students have come across this term and have approached me for its meaning.
I have absolutely no idea what that can mean.   Is it a coranic or islamic
concept? Or could it be some new islamic  computer software?  Thanks.  A.
