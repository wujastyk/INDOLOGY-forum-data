It is possible (or likely?) that a parallel, though certainly not cognate,
construction in the Dravidian languages has contributed to the popularity of
-tavant, namely the combination of a relative participle with a pronominal
ending. E.g.: Kannada maa.dida-, or Tamil ceyta-, is the past relative
participle which means "having done" or "which / who did" (I am now slightly
simplifying the matter), and Ka. maa.didavanu, Ta. ceytava_n, with the suffixes
-vanu and -va_n, mean "he who did", which would be suitably translated into
Sanskrit as k.rtavaan.
