Hello,

>Dear Dr. Jonsson,

FYI it is, alas, still "Mr.", and probably going to be well into the
future, since it's hard to get the academic position necessary to get a
Ph.D. here in Sweden. The alternative is to be wealthy enough to be able to
do it without a position, and that won't probably happen before my kids are
grown up. Of course I manage well without a PhD anyway. Would like if jobs
for editors were more available and better paid, though...

Thanks for the info.

Regards

It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
