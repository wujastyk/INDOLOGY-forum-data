Subject: Q: Univ. Koeln Tamil Library catalogs
Message-ID: <161227029038.23782.11877231010245062026.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>



 I am trying to search for few words in classical Tamil texts
in IITS, Univ. of Koeln gopher site. That is linus.informatik.uni-koeln.de
In the "\oTukkalAm" directory.

Also, some book title searches in the library catalogue.
I have been doing this for years. But I could not look into those
in the last month. What is happening?


Can someone at Univ. of Koeln help, please?
