Not to forget the new critical and annotated edition of Weber's study
on Hinduism which was published under the auspices of the Bayerische
Akademie der Wissenschaften (Bavarian Academy of Sciences) at the end
of the last year (I do not have the references here at home). The
publisher is Mohr/Siebeck in Tuebingen, the chief editor Helwig
Schmidt-Glintzer, the editor-in-charge Karl-Heinz Golzio.
