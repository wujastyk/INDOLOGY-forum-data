Dear Sreenivas,
I checked the works at our card catalogue - they are all in 
Tuebingen! To avoid further complications with your 'Fernleihe' 
please TELL the people in your library to send the orders directly to 
the Sondersammel-Gebiet in Tuebingen. Here are the shelf numbers:
>  
Myth and reality : studies in the formation of Indian culture 
(Popular Prakashan, Bombay, 1962 & Sangam Books, London, 1983)
(21=Tuebingen) 10 A 6517

> Also, I see the following three commemoration volumes in Kosambi's honour, 
> in US on-line catalogues, but not in German ones. Your help in acquiring these 
> four books in Germany is highly appreciated.
>

> P.S. I could find the following commemoration volume in a micro-fiche catalogue:
> 	Dr. D.D. Kosambi memorial volume : Festschrift
> 	Ed. P.V. Kane, Bombay, Asiatic Society, 1970, 304s.
This is part of the 
Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay; N.S. 43/44 
and therefore should be ordered as such. That Journal you should find 
in your state as well. If you must, you can order the volume from us,

So, I hope this helps.
So long
