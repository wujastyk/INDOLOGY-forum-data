It has been shown that the root is 'ai'. In Old Tamil when IA words are
borrowed they are modified to suit Tamil phonology and morphophonemics. But,
as far as I know,  a polysyllabic word is not shortened to form a
monosyllabic word and made into a root. For 'ai' to be the result of deletion
of 'ya' from 'ayya', a Tamil grammarian should have first started with the
form 'ayyar' or 'aiyar', treated the 'ar' as a suffix, 'y' as the glide, and
thus extract a root 'ai' and then recommended to the public the use of 'ai'
by itself and in combination with suffixes such as 'tu' and 'mAr' - totally
different suffixes from the IA forms. This seems far-fetched and totally
alien to the Old Tamil notion of 'literature preceding grammar' and explicit
acknowledgment of borrowing from IA.  In fact, given the basic nature of
Dravidian to keep adding suffixes to the right, the creation of a new root by
deleting 'potential' suffixes from a borrowed IA word and creating a root
seems to be very much against the basic nature of the language. Even more
unlikely is to create an abstract noun such as ai by this process. 

TolkAppiyar (uriyiyal.87) defines 'ai' as 'viyappu'. 'viyappu' is derived
from the root 'viya' (DED 4430) meaning 'to wonder, be proud, wonder at,
esteem, admire, praise, extol, compliment'. Thus the semantic range of the
