According to the legend, it is told that one blind singer (anthakak
kavi/pANaN) (named Veraragavan ?), played the yAzh in the court of the King
(don't know which kingdom and got Jaffna as the gift. Hence it is called
yAzh + pANaN's place = yAzhpANam.
yAzhpANavaipavamAlai may through more light, I think.

Do not know.

>2. What was "Batticaloa" originally called in Tamil?
Still the Tamil name is maddakkiLappu aka maddu nagar; Do not know the
cause; But, this town is known for its 'singing fishes' (about which some
tried to prove scientifically as the sound due to some oysters'
biomechanism?); One word for oyster in Tamil is maddi; kaLappu/kiLappu is
from kaLam (field/living region/kuRichchi). Hence, I think (note it: it is
only my guess) it is called maddakkiLappu.

Right; Again, myth says this as rAvaNan's capital; The legand for the root
of the name is,
Once AthisEshan and vAyu bahavAn wanted to test who the strongest; Then,
AthisEshan wrapped the mERu mountain by his body, and by his force vAyu
hurled three pieces; one is tirukkONamalai (aka tadshaNakailAyam), the other
two are thiruvaNNAmalai and thiruvAnaikkA (not sure of the third).
