Some additional information on Emacs 20 + Devanagari:

The implementor of Emacs 20 Devanagari support, Mr. Taichi KAWABATA,
told me that comments / bug reports from users are welcome and he is
happy to integrate new features proposed by users in his
implementation. Mr. Kawabata can be reached at:

    kawabata at exa.onlab.ntt.co.jp

Please note, however, that Mr. Kawabata is not responsible for the
global implementation of Emacs, other than its Devangari support. If
you have non-devanagari specific questions about Emacs, the following
mailing-lists may be your place to ask:
