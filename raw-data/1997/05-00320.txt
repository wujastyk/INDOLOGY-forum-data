	You're right. I don't remember the exact terms of the question
(ontological nature of Agni ?) but my own reflexions are perhaps linked to.

	In MBh Agni is in DhRSTa-dyumna, the leader of the army.
	dhRS- is 'to dare' but Vedic dhRSTi- is fire tongue.
	In dyumna, the dyu- is precised (I, 57, 91) by agnisamadyuti.
	So, for this heroe, dyu- is a fire-like light and dhRSTadyu- an
enforcement: dhRSTadyu-mna is probably to understand 'staying in fire'.
