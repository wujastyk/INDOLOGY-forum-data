It was the masterwork of his life; He redesigned (or 're-invented') yaazh
from the information given in the ancient tamil literature and wrote 'yaazh

Under that service he was the first pricipal of my Alma Mater, R.K.M. Hindu
College, Trincomalee; He was the first Tamil Professor in (my other Alma
Mater,) University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka too as far as I was told.
He did a great job in establishing RK schools in Ezham (in addition to my
Alma Mater, Sivananda Vidyalayam, Batticoloa, Akkaraippaththu R.K.M. Hindu
College)
