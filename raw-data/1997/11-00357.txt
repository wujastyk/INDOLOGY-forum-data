I said I won't comment.  But I must make a statement.
Anyone thinking of so called "rescue" of documents
from India or the subcontinent is utterly on
the wrong track.  It's not a question of credentials,
it's one of ethics.  It's a personal view, but
I believe I am speaking on behalf of a large number
of silent and "out of list" people.  All work
can be done on site or by collaboration.

Thank you all for your respect to a country's
heritage and her people.
