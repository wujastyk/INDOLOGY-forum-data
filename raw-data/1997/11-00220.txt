   paTTi in Kannada does mean a strip, but AFAIK, it does not have
   a meaning as 'clearing'
   haTTi in Kannada. haTTi means a dwelling, place of stay. It can
also mean a small settlement. This is mostly used with places where
   cattle/sheep are also reared. This word has come from 'paTTi' of
   old Kannada.

   Aren't smaskrita paTha and pata ( as in patati) from different
roots ?
