term includes wonder as well as respect. From this 'ai', an adjectival noun
is also seen in Old Tamil as 'aitu' (KuRuntokai 401.6).  

If 'ai' were to be hypothesized as an IA derivative,  then we have to look at
comparable monosyllabic words in IA with similar meanings. It cannot be from
'ayya'.

It is a lot simpler to treat it as a native root.
