Dear List,

I received a few days ago the following query re T.R.V. Murti. Unable to
give an adequate answer, I have offered to forward the query to the list.
If anyone can help, please forward a reply to Debbie <debrc at ix.netcom.com>.
She is a psychotherapist who very much admires Murti's command not only of
Buddhist philosophy, but of Western philosophy as well.

Speaking for Debbie, thanks in advance.

p.s. She would also be interested in speaking with scholars from Canada.
