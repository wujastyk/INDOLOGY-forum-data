An Exciting New Development


Nai Dunia is a well respected and authoritative Hindi daily, published
from Indore, in Madhya Pradesh. I remember many summers spent at my
grandmother's place in Burhanpur, when I devoured it with gusto, every
day. It is a superb paper. It has also been at the forefront in terms of
applying information technology in its day to day running. 

So it was quite a treat to learn that it is now the first Internet Hindi
daily. What is interesting is that they have accomplished this without
using complicated gif or postscript files. Once you download a font,
which they make available free of charge, you can use the capabilities
available in the latest generation of browsers (for example Netscape
3.0) to view the pages directly in Devanagari script. Since they own the
font and the software associated with it, no additional permission is
required from anyone.  You can access their site at www.naidunia.com

In one swoop they have opened up several and exciting new possibilities.
I would like to explore some of them here in the hope that others will
do likewise.

1. Vinay Chhajlani, who owns a software firm in addition to belonging to
the family which owns Nai Dunia, has kindly offered to make the font and
the associated Windows files available to everyone. It will then give
all of us the capability to exchange mail in Devanagari and to read it
