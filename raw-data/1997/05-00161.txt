The texts usually identify the four yugas with the four colors, and as the
varnas are sometimes associated to the yugas, the relation is probably
indirect.  It is a symbolical correspondence that is frequently applied to
sets of four.

According to the Mbh, the color of Narayana/Visnu/Krsna throughout the yugas
is white, red, yellow and black (Mbh 3.148.16,23,26,33); but soon after it
is said to be white, yellow, red and black (Mbh 3.187.31).
