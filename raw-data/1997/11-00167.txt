        Improbable. An evolution 'p' > 'h' is phonetically acceptable (it
occurs in the Celtic and Armenian domains: skr. pra- = ir. ro ; gallish
-ritu = ford ; the Hercynian forrest comes probably from perkus "oak" ;
skr. padam = arm. het) but I don't know any example in Indian one.
Moreover, both senses are not well linked and *if* the evolution 'rt' >
'TT' is acceptable (no answers), the root hR- (via hartR ?) would be a
better candidate ...

        In both cases, we must remember than  latin portus is not
specifically a haven or a ford but a "point of passage" (the French word
'port' is still used for a pass and I remember the Redhorn's Gate in
Tolkien's Lord of the Rings). A river is not necessary and a mystical
meaning can't be excluded ...

        There is allways some people to say a word Dravidian when it
contains a retroflex. Perhaps right, perhaps wrong ;-)

        Toponymy is a very hard science because it involves a big lot of
dialectes and many possibilities of corruption and popular etymologies.
Moreover, naming the towns of a kingdom is a power act and, sometimes, the
state servants in charge of it were not knowing the local language.
        Without ancient historical documents, it's practically impossible
to say anything serious: the French town of Lyon had a lion as an emblem;
how, without old texts, find the etymon Lugdunum "fortress of the God Lug" ?

        My question about tIrtha and saras was induced by the fact than
fords and bathing places play an important role in Eurindian religious
practices. I profit of the occasion to recall an ancient ask of mine who
was left unanswered:

        Thanks in advance,
