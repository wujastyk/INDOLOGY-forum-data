Dear members of the Indology list,

the library of the Oriental Institute, Prague considers purchasing the
Encyclopaedic District Gazetteers of India (updated) in 11 vols., ed. by
S.C. Bhatt, New Delhi 1997. As the complete set is rather expensive and
none of us here in Prague has seen this edition, we would appreciate
very much a basic description of this source by a person familiar with
it. We would like to know, for example, whether the names of localities
are written only in the Latin script or whether the versions in Indian
scripts are also included, etc.
We would appreciate any information which will help us in evaluating the
suitability of the purchase.

With best regards,

PhDr. Jaroslav Strnad
