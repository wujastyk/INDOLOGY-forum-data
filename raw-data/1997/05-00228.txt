I'll split G. Thompson's post into two shorter parts to answer it, as a lot
of important issues come up and I know that wading through one long post can
be annoying. Greg Downing/NYU

Before I get started, let me thank Jonathan Silk for the solar-religion
article reference in his post, of which I was not aware, and which looks
extremely useful and spot-on with regard to one issue I have to deal with in MM.

Thanks also to others for comments and advice given offlist in the last 48
hours.

As for MM's (shall we say) "retro" status, that I was definitely aware of!!!
both  later 19C and later 20C), it's pretty clear that even before the final
phase of his career (d. 1900) MM got blasted by English, German, and US
scholars not only in the Vedic and mythological/religious areas but also in
the area of language-theory, etc. I'm not trying to resurrect MM as a
serious voice in these areas, but to look at some of the similarities that
show up between Joyce's work (he attended university in 1898-1902) and the
ideas in MM's more speculative (and thus, in fact, less solidly grounded)
work on language and myth/religion. MM's first major publication on
language-theory (his prior efforts were quite narrow/specialized) is
_Lectures on the Science of Lang_ (1863), where to understand what MM is
doing (for better or for worse) one has to take account of the work of
Richard Chenevix Trench.

MM is following up on the great success Trench had with the series of
pop-philology books, from _The Study of Words_ (1851) through _Words
