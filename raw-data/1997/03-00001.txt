	In India the problem is that people do not connect the "aryan" 
	with fascism. That is after all a European phenomenon. How will 
	you convince your Indian colleagues to go easy on the term "Aryan"? 
	Their aryans are, after all, their legitimate forefathers. 
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	Somehow, you would be forcing upon them a moral dilemma for which 
	they are not responsible to begin with.


Lars,  I do appreciate your sympathetic statements above... but I have
trouble with the marked line above...  as a traditional Indian,  I would 
refuse to see the term "Arya" in any genealogical/lineal/racial sense as 
implied above.  Acceptance or rejection of the Vedic heritage doesn't
affect this.

On the other hand, as modern Indians (dis)abused by Indology ;-) 
at least a good many of us would deny any Aryan forefathership
claiming Dravidian/Australoid or whatever.

Anyway, inspired by all of this,  I wrote this ponderous verse:

	We're Aryans fair and true
	Shout some Northies out of da blue
	But,  we're in there too
	Chime the Southies along a few
	
	Dravidians we stand proud
	Claim a chunk of the rest aloud
	Damn it, for crying out loud
	It's all an Indology shroud 
	
	Whine the rest of us mongrels, a crowd. 

Regards,
-Srini.
