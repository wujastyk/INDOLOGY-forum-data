     It is my sad duty to report the death of a friend and colleague, Mr.
P. Sankaralingam.  A brief obituary follows.
     Sankaralingam's energy, wisdom, and integrity has left an indelible
mark on the field of Tamil bibliography and preservation of Tamil culture.
In equal measure his humane life with friends and colleagues has left us in
deep sorrow over his passing.
     A part of Sankaralingam's legacy is a well trained staff in care of
the Tamil collection at the Roja Muthiah Research Library.  They are
carrying on well with the responsibilities entrusted to that Library.

collection of the late Roja Muthiah would be acquired and preserved for the
use of scholars.  The University of Madras generously gave Sankaralingam a
