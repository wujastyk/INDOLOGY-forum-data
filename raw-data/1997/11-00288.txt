>Dear Colleague,

>You have been added to the distribution list INDOLOGY (Indology
>discussion list).
>
>You may leave the list at any time by sending a "SIGNOFF INDOLOGY"
>command to listproc at liverpool.ac.uk . Please note that this command must
>NOT be sent to the list address (indology at liverpool.ac.uk) but to the
>listproc address.
>
>The amount of acknowledgement you wish to receive from this list upon
>completion of a mailing operation can be changed by means of a "SET
>INDOLOGY MAIL option" command, where "option" may be either "ACK" (mail
>acknowledge) or "NOACK".

>Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can
>obtain a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX
>INDOLOGY" command to listproc at liverpool.ac.uk . These files can then be
>retrieved by means of a "GET INDOLOGY filename" command.

>INDOLOGY was started in 1990 as a forum for Sanskritists, MIA and NIA
>language specialists, Dravidologists, historians, and others interested
>in any aspect of Indological studies. That includes other languages, of
>course, and anything related. It's not restricted, except that
>discussions about contemporary politics and social issues are better
>carried out on soc.culture.india and other forums like that.
>
>As a rough guide to subject content, if you enjoy receiving journals
>like the JAOS, JRAS, BSOAS, IIJ, etc., then INDOLOGY is for you! The
>forum is targetted at professional participants in Indological studies,
>and is not primarily a forum for discussions with undergraduates or
>scholars from other fields who have an amateur interest in Indian history
>and culture. For example, if you do not recognise any of the above
>acronyms, or never read any of these journals, or if you never attend
>academic conferences in some aspect of indology, then perhaps another
>forum would be more appropriate for you. Of course non-professionals are
>welcome to join the list if they wish, but elementary questions and
>discussions about Indian history and culture should be addressed
>elsewhere. The discourse in INDOLOGY assumes a familiarity with the
>specialist literature of the subjects discussed.
>
>Please do not muddle addresses: if you want to post a message for
>everyone on the list mail it to indology at liverpool.ac.uk . If you want to
>send a message to the list-owner mail it to
>indology-request at liverpool.ac.uk . If you want to sign-off for some
>inscrutable reason of your own then mail the command SIGNOFF INDOLOGY to
>listproc at liverpool.ac.uk .
>
>Some users of INDOLOGY from within the UK should note that they may
>still need to use the old JANET name order, i.e. uk.ac.liverpool in the
>above addresses.
>
>Please note that the listproc facility at Liverpool is based on a Unix
>look-a-like of the original IBM LISTSERV and that you cannot send it
>interactive messages. Most of the original commands are supported but we
>suggest that you get the help file by sending the message help in the
>body of a mail item to listproc at liverpool.ac.uk . Please read this first
>and make sure you understand the differences between the original
>LISTSERV code and this program. If you have any problems, please contact
>the list owner or list.admin at liverpool.ac.uk
>
>Archives of the list and related files are available via gopher. See the
