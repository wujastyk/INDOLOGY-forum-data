Subject: beef eating in the Veda
Message-ID: <161227028190.23782.18064792529875687182.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Recently I read Agehananda Bharati's _Great Tradition - Little
Traditions_, in which he refers to Vedic passages which prove that
beef was a common foodstuff among the Vedic people. Not being a Veda
specialist myself, I want to ask: has anyone here on the list seen any
such clear, unambiguous passages? (Please give references.)
