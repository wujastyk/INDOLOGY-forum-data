To all members of the List,

I am presently working on a translation of the Uttara Khanda of the Ganesha
Purana, using three printed editions and five manuscripts.  The latter are
from Poona and Madras.  A comprehensive search of manuscript catalogues
reveals that no manuscript is to be found further North than Rajasthan,
Uttar Pradesh or West Bengal.

        Is anyone aware of the existence of such manuscripts in Kashmir or
Nepal. If such exist it is posssible that they may be older than the oldest
(1745ACE) manuscript I am presently using.

With best wishes,


Greg Bailey
