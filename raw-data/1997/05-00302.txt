In response to Vidyasankar Sundaresan's recent remarks, let me isolate just
one sentence:

>In a discussion of agni and dIrghatamas, contemporary science just has to
>keep >silent.
>

I have no trouble at all with anything that Vidyasankar says in this post
abt science, nor with anything that anybody has said abt science on this
thread. But I *knew* that this thread was headed toward a sentence like the
one above. I just *knew* it.

Maybe this will make my position clear:

I am a Vedicist.

Not a logical positivist, not a scientist. Not a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor a
Muslim or a Christian.  I'm not an American.  I'm not a father.  I'm not
anything else at all.  I am a Vedicist.

As a Vedicist I will not keep silent abt agni and dIrghatamas. I will study
them both and I will say exactly what I think abt what I find.

If that offends anyone, so be it.

George
