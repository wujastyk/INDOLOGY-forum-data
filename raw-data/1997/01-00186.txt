The relation between external alchemy (gold deposits in the earth, etc.)
and internal alchemy (the alchemy of the body) is quite explicitly
articulated in Chinese medicine, as well as South Indian Siddha practices.
For an entire volume on this topic, see part V, of Volume 5, of Science
and Civilization in China by Joseph Needham on 'Physiological Alchemy.'
Joseph Needham argues that Chinese 'physiological alchemy' was deeply
influenced by Indian yogic practices.
