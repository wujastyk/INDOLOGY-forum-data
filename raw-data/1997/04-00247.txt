I happen to know G.V. Iyer personally. He reads Sanskrit and is obviously very
fond of classical Sanskritic India, but he did not trust his own Sanskrit
enough to write the Sanskrit portions of his scripts himself, so he had this
done by his friend Bannanje Govindacharya in Udupi, who previously edited the
collected writings of Madhvaacaarya and is a Sanskrit author in his own right.
Govindacharya wrote the Sanskrit text for both the Shankaracharya and the
Bhagavadgita movies which Iyer made, and he wrote the whole script for Iyer's
film on Madhva. (And that Sanskrit is very real.) I do not know whether the
scripts have been published.
