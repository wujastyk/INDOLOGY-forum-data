Tiruttani is in TN now. But S.Radhakrishnan is a telugu and he never denied
it. I think claiming S.Radhakrishnan as a tamil Iyer is a mistake.
But a number of telugus who settled in the interior of tamilnadu at the time
of Nayaka rulers pass for Iyers. That is how Tyagayya is called Tyagayyar.
Some of these people do not have any contact with with telugu now. For example
the Melattur Bhagavatars who migrated to Tanjavur in Nayaka times know little
telugu though they still stage the telugu dramas penned by their ancestor
Melattur Venkatrama Sastrulu. Even today there are villages in the heart of
tamilnadu, especially in the Tanjavur district where the language spoken in
the homes is telugu.

Parallel to this Tamil brahmins migrated to Andhra in the Chalukyan times
along with Chola princesses Kundava, Ammanga Devi and Madharantaki who
married the successive Chalukyan Kings. These are known as Dravida Brahmins.
Because of the longer time gap involved these people have lost their contact
with tamilnadu completely.
