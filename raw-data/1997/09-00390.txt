What kind of Australians are these students of yours? I wouldn't normally
presume to post here, but I can tell you straight away that a layback is
the practice of lying back over the bar while someone else pours strong
alcohol directly into the mouth: often tequila is used for this purpose.
Naturally, after just a couple, extreme drunkenness can result. Wahey!
