Both. For some reason we have a double system of addresses. Our 
university started e-mail early enough to be able to reserve the simple 
name at Helsinki.fi for its use, but at the same time the systems used for 
e-mail add also their own type of address. Thus I can be reached both at 
Klaus.Karttunen at Helsinki.fi and at kjkarttu at elo.helsinki.fi.
