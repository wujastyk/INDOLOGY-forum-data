Please excuse my ignorance but what is that three-language formula?

You mean a non-Hindi language to add as language of the Union?

Are you talking of a federal two-language formula (in which case how can
Tamilnadu and West Bengal do it on their own since this by definition
would involve the whole country?), but if you mean at the state level,
I thought (has that changed?) Tamil Nadu and West Bengal had one official
language each?
