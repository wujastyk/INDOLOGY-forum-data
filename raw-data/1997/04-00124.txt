I would like to thank Dominique Thillaud for organizing this Indology list
but for which I would not have been able to solve the problem of tracing the
history of the 'text' in India, at least to my satisfaction. Without this
'web' of persons interested in Indology, solutions and insights like this may
not have come about this soon, if ever. Distance, time, accessibility to
information, and areal specialization would have presented considerable
obstacles. 

I would also like to thank all those who contributed with information.

Regards.

S. Palaniappan
