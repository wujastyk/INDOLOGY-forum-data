Dear Friends

I will be grateful for some help in understanding various theories
explainaing the concept of perception,
causality and explaination in Indian and Other Traditions in comparative
sense.

I happen to have a few books on my desks:
specifically on the problem of perception one may start with
B.K. Matilal, Perception: An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge,
Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986.
The problems of causality and explanation are basic to the entire South Asian
philosophical tradition. One may start with
Karl Potter, Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, vol. 2, The tradition of
Nyaaya-Vaisesika up to Gangesa, Delhi 1977, perhaps continue with
vol. 6 by Karl Potter and Sibajiban Bhattacharya, Delhi 1993, Indian
Philosophical Analysis: Nyaaya-Vaisesika from Gangesa to Raghunaatha Siromani.
Both volumes have an elaborate introduction, and although the comparative
perspective is not prominent it is always there at the background.
On Saamkhya: vol. 4 in the same Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, by Gerald
James Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, Delhi 1987. Each volume abounds in
bibliographical references, details of which are found in vol. 1 of the
Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Bibliography (recently, the third updated
edition has appeared).
