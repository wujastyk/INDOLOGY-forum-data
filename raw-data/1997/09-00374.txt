Dear Friends

I will be grateful for some help in understanding various theories
explainaing the concept of perception,
causality and explaination in Indian and Other Traditions in comparative
sense.

In Sankhya I remember having read about several attributes of  a phenomenon
for exlaining its essence such as Guna, Karma , Prakar, swabhav etc.,

Pl forgive my ingorance. Is Sankhya Yoga available on inetrnet sites? What
else shoudl one read on thsi subject.

Thanks
