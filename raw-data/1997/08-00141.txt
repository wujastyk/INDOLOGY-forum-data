Satapatha Brahmana 12.1.2.9 (in Eggeling's transl: Part V, p. 279): "...
But his wicked enemy seeks to lay hold of him who performs the
horse-sacrifice, and the horse is a thunderbolt;-- having killed the
four-eyed dog, he -- with `Undone is the man! undone is the dog!' --
plunges it under the horse's feet: it is by means of the thunderbolt he
thus stamps him down; and the wicked enemy does not lay hold of him."

There are two lengthy footnotes to this passage, which I shan't type up,
and they also refer one on to other texts (Samhita and Sutra). It appears
that the sacrificial priest tells a mixed-caste woman or a lewd man to
kill the four-eyed dog before passing it below the horse. "If a four-eyed
dog is not available(!), a dog with marks about the eyes should be used."
