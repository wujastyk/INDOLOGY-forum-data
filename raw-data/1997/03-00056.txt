	ripuvairisaptap.rthvii

	I would have read that this as 1766 VS, but the catalogue for 
	the MS says 1733 VS.  Can anyone clarify the usage of "ripu" 
	and "vairi" as anka?

ripu = vairi = 6 seems the right interpretation... but could the
3 be due to the Adibhautika-Adidaivika-AdhyAtmika categories of 
troubles ?
