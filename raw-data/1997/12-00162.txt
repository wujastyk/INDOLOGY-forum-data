>Dear members of Indology list

>Could anybody kindly give me detailed informations on the Kumbha mela as
>it will take place in Haridwar in spring of 1998?
>It seems to be a 'big' one, as it takes place every 12 years. As a
>research group of our institute we plan to go to Cidambaram in February,
>during Sivaratri - if things turn out fine, we are thinking to connect
>this stay with a visit at Haridwar in March; only we are not sure
>whether it will be a proper time to go.
>Does anybody knows about special tithis/ ritual events connected with
>kumbha mela in March?
>Any kind of further informations on this subject is most welcome.
