went to Pakistan. From April - 1947 there was a concerted Muslim effort 
to burn the Hindus and Sikhs out of Lahore city. The riots left a legacy of 
hatred and mistrust and even the police force was communalised. 

I have vivid memories of those terrible days when my parents were stuck 
up in Lahore and there was looting and killing going on all over the 
Punjab. The Partition claimed at least a million lives, while another ten 
millions were uprooted from their ancestral homes. The extent and horror 
of slaughter and destruction represents the greatest human tragedy of the 
century. 

We Lahorias had to pay a very heavy price for the freedom of India. Apart 
from the loss of life and property we have to consider the psychological 
effects of the Partition on the people of two countries. We Lahorias are 
still groping for an identity and forced to make linguistic and social 
adjustments. It was a heart rending experience to leave Lahore, the home 
of our ancestors over the centuries, there was no one left now to look 
back to. Lahore had Eminent writers of both India and Pakistan. They have 
produced a vast amount of literature giving moving accounts of the human 
suffering that accompanied the Partition. My emotional ties to the city 
of my birth and upbringing have survived even after 50 years and
found expression in my book Lahore - A Sentimental Journey.
