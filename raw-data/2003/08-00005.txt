I distinctly remember that during my first visit to Benares in 1970 there
was a sign in Hindi  outside the temple that foreigners and Harijans were
not allowed in (harijanoM aur videshiyoM ko andar jaanaa manaa hai). I
managed to enter it in 1975 with the help of a Hindu friend who assured them
that I was a Kashmiri Brahmin. I understand he also gave the priests some
bakshish. The sign is not longer there I believe.
