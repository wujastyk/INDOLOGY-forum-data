It's my impression that in large parts of Orissa, namaskaar (pronounced
rather in the Hindi way than expected [nOmOskaarO]) is nowadays quite
common: in view of the pronunciation perhaps indeed "nationalist" influence.
"Namaste" is hardly heard in Orissa, by the way.

In those ('tribal') parts of the present Jharkhand state that I have
visited, "Johar" seems to be the normal greeting, also in the context of
Hindi (or Sadani) conversations. A variant of this greeting (with
-h-deletion: [juaar]) is the standard greeting in those parts of 'tribal'
southern Orissa where I have travelled (viz. Koraput and Rayagada Dt.), no
matter whether the language spoken is Desia Oriya, Gutob, or --- I would
assume --- any other tribal language.  There is a brief note on this word by
Jules Bloch in the Dr. C. Kunhan Raja Presentation Volume (Madras 1946), p.
129f. [reprinted in Recueil d'Articles de Jules Bloch 1906--1955 (Textes
rassembl?s par Colette Caillat, Paris 1985), p. 345f.]. Turner (CDIAL #5142)
calls Bloch's derivation from *jayakaara "extremely doubtful".
    Bloch refers to Crooke, "Things Indian" p. 294 where a rather different
usage of the term is mentioned (and a consequently different etymology is
proposed). In the context of Prof. Deshpande's reference to rural areas of
Maharashtra, it is interesting to mention here that Bloch also gives the
following quote: "Mais ouvrons le dictionnaire marathe de Molesworth sous
johaar: ``The word used by the Mahaar, Caambhaar etc., in saluting their
betters or each other 2. The word of obeisance used to a Raajaa by his
attendants, implying `O warrior'!".
