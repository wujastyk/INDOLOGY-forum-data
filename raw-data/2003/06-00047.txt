Subject: Derge Tanjur News
Message-ID: <161227072922.23782.14205803195908459818.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Recently I passed along news of the CD-ROM publication of the Derge
Kanjur. I have now been informed by Gene Smith of TBRC that the
quality control and checking of the Tanjur scans has been completed,
and the CDs will be made available by August of this year. The price
of the CD set for individuals will be $275--that's for the complete
Derge Tanjur!

I will pass along further information regarding ordering, and library
pricing, when it is available.
