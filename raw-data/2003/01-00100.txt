Subject: AW: Internal sibilant-sandhi after the i-vowel
In-Reply-To: <000501c2c7cb$403e7a00$82b68283@indo.univie.ac.at>
Message-ID: <161227072138.23782.8515563479019899130.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

But such prefixes are not subject to the normal rules of internal
sandhi: they have their own, slightly irregular version.  "Vi-" as a
prefix does not normally cause a following s to become retroflex.
However, I imagine that it is not exactly incorrect to use the
retroflex.  (The grammar books I have to hand are not helpful on this
point.)

Cp. compounds.  Strictly, external sandhi rules should apply, but in
fact we have YudhiSThira, not *Yudhisthira.  Presumably the former
sounded more natural to speakers of the language.
