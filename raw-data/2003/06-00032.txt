Oops, I'm afraid I reiterated the error, and automatically mailed my
personal reply to prof. Aklujkar to the whole list.
Sorry about that,
Alex Passi

PS. Perhaps the Indology mail demon could be set to identify mail
from the list with a tag, such as [Indology]John.Doe - the way things
are now, there is no immediate way to distinguish a letter from a
list member, sent through the list,from a personal one,  unless one
carefully reads the headers.
