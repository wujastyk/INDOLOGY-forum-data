Dear colleagues,
I take the opportunity of Yaroslav's question (to which I am unfortunately
unable to answer), for adding another one about the Nirukta (of Yaska),
that my collaborator Sandra Smets asked me, in relationship with
embryological matters that she examines.
It is said in Windisch (Buddha's Geburt, 1908, p. 87) that the
Garbhopani.sad is "zum Teil w?rtlich ?bereinstimmend mit dem zweiten
Pari/si.s.ta des Nirukta, ?6".  It would be very interesting for her to get
some information on this section of the Pari/si.s.ta (e.g. elements of its
dating or references to the study its contents), and, above all, could
somebody give the references of an edition of the Nirukta that contains
this peculiar text ?
thank you very much,
