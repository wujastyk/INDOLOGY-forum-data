Dear colleagues,
        as far as I know, the core 12 books of the Nirukta are considered to be created by
Yaska himself and dated by ca. 500 BCE, while the last two books are somewhat later additions.
Could anybody tell me, what is an approximate daring of these added books? I am especially
interested in the book 14.
        Many thanks in advance.
                                        YV
