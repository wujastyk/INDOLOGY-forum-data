SUMMER SCHOOL IN SPOKEN SANSKRIT 2003

The Summer School in Spoken Sanskrit organized by the Department of
Classical Indology at the South Asia Institute, Heidelberg, entering its
fourth consecutive year, once again offers the opportunity, particularly
to those pursuing Indological Studies, to expand the range of their use

native speaker, Shri Sadanada Das, students with a basic training in
Sanskrit grammar and translation shall learn to carefully listen, to
accurately pronounce and to slowly speak and recite it. The four-week,

skills and make the study of Sanskrit a playful and creative experience.
