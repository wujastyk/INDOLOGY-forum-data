Subject: Sanskrit word order sort program

Dear Stephen,

Here is the macro I've been using. You should paste it into a new module in
the Visual Basic Editor for Excel.

The macro, called SortCodeGenerator, prompts you for the Source and Target
ranges, and then the Sort type. For Sanskrit, only Sanskrit is necessary.
Gandhari also requires an absolute sort code.

I aim to streamline the interface at some point, but I'm not there yet. I
ran the process on 11,000 items the other day, and it took between half and
one hour to process, on a new P4 2 GHz laptop. Its probably a good idea to
test it on some smaller chunks to begin with. If I get time I will also add
Tibetan encoding this month?

Best wishes,

Andrew
