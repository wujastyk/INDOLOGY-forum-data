Many thanks to those who responded to my cross-posted broadcast on
insects in bamboo and palm leaves, in particular John Dean, Susan Go, J.
Kirk, and Ulrich Kragh.  My apologies if I have missed anyone.

We have put out traps in our rare book cage and so far none of the bugs
have appeared in them, giving hope this was an infestation way in the
past.  On the other hand, they are not very active creatures. We are
investigating chemicals that might attract them into the traps.

Gratefully,

Allen Thrasher
