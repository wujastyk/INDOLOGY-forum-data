Hello Ashok and Allen and List,

The old Indo-Europeanist view is that prapaJcayati is a denominative stem
derived from prapaJca.  paJcan [parallel with saptan] is in fact attested in
bahuvrIhis [see Wackernagel-Debrunner, Altindische Grammatik 3.354].  I have
no explanation for pra + paJca [nor for the absence of pra + dvi or pra +
daza, etc.], but paJca as 'five' thus to ''expansiveness, manifoldness" is
easy.  We have in IE languages many instances of 'five' going to 'fist, hand,
etc.'  -- not only in English but also in German, Slavic, Greek, etc. [see
Mayrhofer KEWA, under paJca].  Compare paJcazAkha = hand.

I don't see anything wrong with the old IE view.  Does anyone else?

Best wishes,

George Thompson
