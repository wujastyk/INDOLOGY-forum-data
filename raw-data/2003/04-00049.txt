Please tell me the academic value or contribution to intellectual
freedom offered by the following:

Given that the United States right now has a right-wing government, any
intervention in this case should be couched in careful language.
Otherwise, ignorant republican senators and congressmen might draw the
conclusion that you are just a bunch of leftists trying to keep an
honest conservative out of the job.


My fear is that this *type* thing will quickly degenerate into the
polemics that drove Indology out of business once (? at least once)
before.

I suggest that any further exchanges on this issue should be carried
on off-list.
