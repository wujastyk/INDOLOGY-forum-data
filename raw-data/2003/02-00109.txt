Yves Codet offered the Venisamhara by Bhattanarayana for sharing
and I mounted the files on the INDOLOGY website last September. See

   http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/xml/venisamhara/venisamhara.xml

This is an XML file encoded using TEI guidelines. Includes accented
scholarly transliteration and Devanagari, using Unicode.

Be aware that different web browsers and versions of browsers do
startlingly different jobs of displaying files like this.  I have
regularly had good experiences with Opera versions 6 and (recently) 7.
MSIE 6, sp1, seems to be doing a reasonable job, but in general Opera has
in the past been more trustworthy on issues like XML/Unicode conformance.

Best,
Dominik
