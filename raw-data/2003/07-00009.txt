Dear Colleagues,

[I apologise to subscribers to H-Buddhism for cross posting]

Drawing on Gomez[1], Potter[2] and Tsukamoto et al.[3], together with
my own notes, I have collated a preliminary bibliography focused on
"Saantideva:

  http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/biblio.html


The bibliography is divided into sections:

 1) Manuscripts & editions
     http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/bca_ed.html

 2) Translations
     http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/bca_trans.html

 3) Secondary literature
     http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/bca_second.html


It is my hope that these details might form the basis for an accurate,
up to date database of materials concerning "Saantideva. A form is
available for the submission of corrections and additions:

  http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/biblio-input.html

If you notice any mistakes in the BibTeX databases, or know of papers
not included, please do not hesitate to use this form.


Best regards,

 Richard Mahoney
