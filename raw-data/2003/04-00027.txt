Dear Colleagues,

In the SaptazatI MS (17th-18th century) belonging to the Tessitori
Collection in Udine, the older part - the last two folios being far
more recent - ends with a brief series of numbered mantra-s of
unequal length terminating in " Iti duArapAlapUjAH 14 // " [sic].
These lines come after the first ten (incomplete) stanzas of the
Laghustotra, which in turn immediately follow the text of the
devI-mAhAtmya proper.
These "dvArapAla-PUjA" mantra-s appear to be set quite some ways
apart (the number of misreadings is much higher) from the previous
sections, though the handwriting is not all that much later. Does
anyone know if they are to be found elsewhere? They do not figure in
any of the DM editions I have within my reach, and I am wondering
just how consistent with the DM is their inclusion in the MS.

With my very best regards,

Alex Passi
