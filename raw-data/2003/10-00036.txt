I thank Prof. Brockington for his useful comments, and hope that Bob Goldman could also give me some advice on these matters, with some useful references.

With best wishes,

  The best person to ask about this is Robert Goldman, who has studied them
  intensively as part of his work on the Princeton translation of the Critical
  Edition of the R-am-aya,na.  However, here are some initial reactions.

  The general consensus is that the Tilaka commentary was written by N-age'sa
  Bha.t.ta; why the CC suggests otherwise is unclear to me.

  Since this is one of the older commentaries, the earlier date seems more
  likely than the later.

  The R-am-aya.na'siroma.ni is generally ascribed to Va.m's-idhara
  'Sivasah-aya and this seems consistent with its opening verses.
