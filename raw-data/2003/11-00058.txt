Another question, or possible way of looking at it, is whether the
putrikA would inherit, while her husband would not, but the husband
would have the control of the property as husband, not as any sort of
son or quasi-son of the decedent - the usual situation of husbands of
heiresses in England and many European countries until a century or two
ago, unless the marriage settlement provided otherwise.

And then would the husband have less control over the property, e.g. to
sell land, than if he had himself inherited, because he was really a
sort of trustee for his sons by the putrikA, and neither he nor even
perhaps his putrikA wife was an owner?
