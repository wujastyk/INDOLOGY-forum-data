OFF THE LIST

Dear Alf,

Is Bhattacharya in DC?  If so he could examine our eds. of the Purana.
I really don't have time to do so.  LC has 15 eds. inc. translations.

Dear Colleagues,
I have been asked to forward the following note from Pradip
Bhattacharya, and
would, indeed, be grateful for more on the matter myself, and for any
further
references (I do not have a copy of the BP) or information. With
thanks,
Alf Hiltebeitel

=====

I wonder if you could possibly help me out to track down a reference.
This is
the sloka celebrating the panchakanya, viz.

Ahalya Draupadi Kunti Tara Mandodari tatha
panchakanya svaranityam mahapataka nashaka

The problem is to find out where it occurs. One reference cites the
Brahma
Purana, 3.7.219. Can anyone check up this reference? If found, can you
let me
know the context in which it occurs, who utters the sloka and why?
