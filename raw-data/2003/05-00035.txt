Subject: Svastika: history and interpretation
Message-ID: <161227072768.23782.2914377569747606569.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The discussion raises another issue.  The sorts of books that are being
cited usually discuss what the svastika (and similar signs) are
"symbols" of or "represent."  But there is usually no textual evidence
in India that those who employed them thought of them as a "symbol" of
anything.  Rather they are talked of as being "auspicious" (subha,
kalyANa, puNya).  As far as the texts go, at least to my observation,
the auspiciousness resides in the forms themselves without their
representing any thing or idea.

I sometimes think there is an article to be written, contra Heinrich
Zimmer, "Why there are no myths and symbols in Indian art and
civilization."  Zimmer reads Indian culture via Plato (as have a lot of
others).
