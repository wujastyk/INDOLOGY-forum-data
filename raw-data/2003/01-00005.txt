Dear Friends,
I want to know whether there is any work called muraari"sataka ascribed to "sanakaracaarya the great advaitin.
Jayateertha in his nyayasudhaa and tattvodyota.tiikaa, quotes one verse from this work. 
that verse is 
an.rtaja.davirodhiruupam antatrayamalabandhanadu.hkhataaviruddham/
atinika.tamavikriya.m muraare.h paramapada.m pra.nayaadabhi.s.tviimi//

I also want to know who is right person to disuss with my problem of some untraced buddhist verses quoted by Madhavaacaarya.
