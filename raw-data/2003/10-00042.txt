As an introduction to at least some
aspects of the vyaakara.na traditions,
I've found Matilal's The Word and the World
to be excellent for classroom use.
Staal's 'Euclid and Panini' article
(reprt. in his collection 'Universals')
is also good in this context.
Some of the articles in the Cultural
History of India that Basham edited for OUP
are useful as introductions to
the various sastra-s.
