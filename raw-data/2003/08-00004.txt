Thanks to Axel Michaels & Joerg Gengnagel for their input.

However, if you please, one more question concerning the Vishvanath Temple
(main): are there in force any regulations that would disable the members
of any segment of (broadly defined) Hindu population from entering it?
Sikhs? Untouchables? Like, for example, Banarasi Doms?

Regards,

Artur Karp
