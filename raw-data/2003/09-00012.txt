Dear Lars,

Mark Allon informs me that a "full bibliography" for Prof. Hara appears in
the recent Festschrift for him.  I assume he means the title below, but I'm
not sure as I have not seen the volume first hand.  I don't believe there
is a list available on the Net (at least my searches did not bear fruit).  

Haranandalahari :
volume in honour of Professor Minoru Hara on his seventieth birthday / 
Author(s): Hara, Minoru,; 1897- ; Tsuchida, Ryutaro. ; Wezler, Albrecht.  
Publication: Reinbek : Dr. Inge Wezler Verlag f?r Orientalistische
Fachpublikationen, 
Year: 2000 

Hope this helps,

Best,
