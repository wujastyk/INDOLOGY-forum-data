A somewhat general description of various insects and what they do to mss
(pp. 79-82) along with a number of remedies (pp. 83-86) as practised in
various Indian libraries is given by Murthy. However, the book contains
nothing specific about bamboo-materials and does not specifically mention
the powder post beetle. It might not be very helpful for your case. For
general information, the book also contains an interesting section on the
production of mss in India as well as a introduction to the standard
principles of critical editing. The bibliographical reference is:

R. S. Shivaganesha Murthy (1996): "Introduction to Manuscriptology", Sharada
Publishing House, Delhi.

The publisher's address is: Sharada Publishing House, 40, Anand Nagar,
Inderlok, Delhi 110035, India, tel. 5117390 and 5116763 (one probably has to
to predial +91-11- for New Delhi).
