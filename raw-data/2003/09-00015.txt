Dear Colleagues,
in C.?H. Philips (ed.), Historians of India, Pakistan and Ceylon.
(London 1961) Basham claims that Norwegians are angry with Christian
Lassen because he forgot his native land and even bequeathed his books
and papers to Bonn University (where he was many years professor). Now
Fridrik Thordarson in his entry on Lassen in the new Norsk Biografisk
Leksikon (6, 2003, 18) claims that they are in Oslo. Has the situation
changed after 1961 or what is the explanation? I think that colleagues
both from Oslo and Bonn are watching this list and hope someone knows
the answers.

With best wishes
Klaus
