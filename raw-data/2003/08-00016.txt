Using the perl module `Sort::ArbBiLex', I've written a perl script to
sort Romanised Tib. in Wylie translit., with Skt. words in
Harvard-Kyoto translit.: `sort-wylie-rom-tib-proto'. The script lives
at:

As with the script for sorting utf-8 Romanised Skt., I would welcome
remarks, bug reports &c.


Best regards,

 Richard Mahoney
