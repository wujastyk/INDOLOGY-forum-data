Depending by what you mean as "medieval" there is always sculpture
and painting (is Ajanta too early?) Khajuraho has some very small
reliefs that also depict rather more ordinary people.

Then there are the souvenir books from the British period depicting
persons of various castes in traditional costume.Susan had one of her
students do a master's thesis on one

While the costumes are for the most part very villagey, there is
still some Mughal influence in various details.
