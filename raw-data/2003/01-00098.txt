Subject: Internal sibilant-sandhi after the i-vowel
Message-ID: <161227072143.23782.6987162531725708533.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

By Panini's rules, one cannot have viSabhAga.  After upasargas like vi, s can change to S only if it is the initial of certain verb roots, for exampe vi+sIdati>viSIdati.  The element 'sa' in sabhAga does not occur in the same category.  
                                                                                   Madhav Deshpande

	So far as I can make out, the operative rules, PA.nini VIII.3.55, 57, 59,
	specify that the change takes place when the s occurs in an Ades'a or
	pratyaya, which is not the case with respect to the initial s of
	sabhAga. Hence, the dental should remain. But this with the
	caveat that a second opinion from one more specialized in
	vyAkara.na would be useful.
