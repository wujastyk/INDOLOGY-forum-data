Dear Richard,

Great thanks to you and the rest of the team involved in this project.

I now have the MW on my hard disk. It works very fast with Examine32.

Examine32 is a fast and versatile text search utility for Microsoft Windows
95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP with the following features:

It can search both text and binary files. File formats supported are text
files with Windows, Macintosh or UNIX line endings, Microsoft Word files,
Rich Text Format (RTF), HTML (web pages), WordPerfect and Write files. All
other formats are treated as binary files.

Examine32 can also search for text in files stored in ZIP archives. Any
type of stored file can be searched with the file formats above being
supported.

And a lot of other useful features.

The program needed 20 secs to find all the occurences of the word
"obstacle" in MW (58 matches in 12 files).

Examine32 can be had from:

With highest regards,

Artur Karp
