Dear Fellow Indologists,

As some of you may know, there is now a concerted effort by members
and sympathizers of the Sangh Parivar to get Professor Thapar's Kluge
Chair at the Library of Congress rescinded and to nominate Koenraad
Elst instead.  See the two excerpts from the WAVES list below.  The
attacks on Professor Thapar are, as usual, vicious and without any
scholarly foundation.  However, to judge by what happened last year,
when a screening of Anand Patwardhan's documentaries in New York was
(temporarily) canceled because of a right-wing signature campaign, we
should probably not take this attack lightly.  I would encourage all
of our members to let the Library of Congress know that we support
Professor Thapar's appointment and strongly deplore the right-wing
signature campaign against her.

I know, we are trying to keep politics off our list, and with good
reason.  This, however, is an attack on academic freedom and on
scholarship in general. So I hope I have your indulgence in bringing
this particular issue to your attention.

Best wishes,

Hans Henrich Hock

It is a great travesty that Romila
Thapar has been appointed the first holder of the Kluge Chair in
Countries and Cultures of the South at the Library of
Congress.

In regards to India, she is an avowed antagonist of
India's Hindu civilization. As a well-known Marxist,
she represents a completely Euro-centric world view.
I fail to see how she can be the correct choice to
represent India's ancient history and civilization.
She completely disavows that India ever had a history.


Just as the Europeans discredited the American
Indian's land claims by ignoring that they represented
a unique civilization with a wholesome variety of
distinct linguistic and cultural traits, Thapar has
long expounded the same ignorant view of India's
unique history and civilization.

The ongoing campaign by Romila Thapar and others to
discredit Hindu civilization is a war of cultural
genocide. By your unfortunate selection of R.Thapar
for the Kluge Chair in Countries and Cultures of the
South at the Library of Congress, America is now aiding and
abbeting this effort.

The result of her "Historical Consciousness in Early
India" is already a foregone conclusion. She will of
course attempt to show that Early India had no
historical consciousness.

Why waste our American resources on a
Marxist idealogical assault on Hindu
civilization?Hinduism is the world's most ancient,
ongoing and largest cultural phenonmenon. Such a long
lived civilization surely has alot to teach the world.
So why support its denigration? As a Friend of India, I
protest this appointment.

Sincerely,
The Undersigned
