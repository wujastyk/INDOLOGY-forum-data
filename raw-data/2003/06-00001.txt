Actually, the English word canyon is a particularly good illustration, as it
comes from Spanish ca??n (in Spanish the accent falls on the o, but English
shifts it to the a). Because English does not have the ? (palatal nasal), 'ny'
was adopted as the best approximation to the sound of ?. 
So, for English speakers 'ny' is as close as it gets when trying to describe
the ? sound in writing (without using phonetical explanations).

(By the way, ? is ASCII character 164, so PCs can write it in any font)
