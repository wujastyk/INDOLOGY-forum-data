Dear Artur Karp,

the present Vishvanatha temple which was constructed in 1777 and sponsored by
Queen Ahalya Bai of Indore is - like other temples in this central area - not
open to non-Hindus. There are of course other Vishvanatha temples in Banaras
(at BHU or Mir Ghat) where access is not resticted.

Best
