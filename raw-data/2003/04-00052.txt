Subject: SV: Romila Thapar appointed Kluge Chair in Countries and              Cultures of the South at Library of Congress
In-Reply-To: <p05100307bad48ec867b0@[149.142.125.67]>
Message-ID: <161227072662.23782.15335398017563793507.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

May I take the liberty to draw the list members'
attention to the Scope and Guidelines of the List
and especially to the phrase:
"List members are discouraged from posting
messages that are not part of a discourse on
indology"
Note also the phrase "Members who violate these
standards will be warned and may have their
membership privileges suspended or revoked if the
behaviour continues."
Since the basic data are now available to the
entire readership of the list I think those
interested will stay on the safe side by
continuing the discussion on the Kluge Chair
off-list.
Best regards,
Jan Houben
