Subject: Traditional dates of Buddha?
Message-ID: <161227072561.23782.12772331642035847214.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks to the person who pointed me to the writings of S. Vidyasankar who
claims that the records of the Sankaracarya Maths were most likely forged --
and relatively recently at that.

Can someone tell me where I can find his articles or discussion about them?
