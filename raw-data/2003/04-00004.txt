Subject: Traditional dates of Buddha?

Thanks for the reply. My German has gotten a bit rusty with disuse over the
years but I'm dusting it off.

So, the traditional dates of 1700 and 1000 BC are just one of a multitude of
claimed dates and don't have any particularly large or influential groups
that hold to them?

Concerning the dating of Buddha Sakyamuni, see the congress volumes ed. by
H. Bechert. There you will find lots of possible and impossible dates and
where they may come from.
