Subject: insects in bamboo and palm leaf

I am cross posting this to CONSALD, CORMOSEA, INDOLOGY, and various
individuals.

We have recently detected larva cases and frass from some small insects
in our collection of poetry on sections of bamboo from Mindoro,
Philippines, acquired in the early 20th century. The Conservation
section is taking steps to treat the items and to monitor for further
infestations.  It is possible the insect is the powder post beetle.  We
have a few more bamboo items but very many palm leaf manuscripts.  Does
anyone have experience whether insects that attack bamboo items may move
over to palm leaf materials, and how to deal with them?  Any
bibliography?  Conservation is consulting their bibliographical sources
and also the Freer and other parts of the Smithsonian.

Thanks,

Allen
