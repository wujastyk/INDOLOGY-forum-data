Dear list members,

A student of my wife's, Susan L. Huntington, has a reference to the
Mahakuta Mahatmya which none of us are familiar with.  The usual
library and internet search procedures have yielded nothing. The name
sounds good and the reference came from an article  on the Mahakuta
temple.

Could some one please tells us if this actually exists?

Is this the correct name?

Are there alternate names?

Is it published?

Has it been translated?

Thank you in advance.

John C. Huntington
