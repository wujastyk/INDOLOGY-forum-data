A major new study is Robert Goodding's dissertation submitted to U.
Texas, Austin:

"The Treatise on Liberation in Life: Critical Edition and Annotated
Translation of the Jiivanmuktiviveka of Vidyaara.nya" (2002, 522 pp.,
including a valuable introduction).

Goodding has generously made the entire text available on-line for
download as an Acrobat PDF file at:
http://www.robgoodd.net/

Be aware that the file is 1743 KB, so unless you have a high-speed
connection, it will take a while to load.

Goodding is interested mostly in Vidyaara.nya's role in "internal
debates within medieval Vedaanta philosophy" as the context for the
work, though he assesses various arguments about V.'s identity and
career.

Has anyone on the list come across good studies about the 14th-cent.
religious and political thinker Vidyaara.nya (Karnataka / Vijayanagara)?
I am
interested in studies about his writings as well as about his time and
his
historical significance.
