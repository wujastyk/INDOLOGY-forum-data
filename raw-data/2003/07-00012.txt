Subject: Sanskrit word order sort program ?
Message-ID: <161227072976.23782.8499901625588696967.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have an excel macro which will convert Sanskrit romanization (unicode)
into a number. Sorting by this number will produce correct dictionary order.
I don't have a solution for Tibetan yet.
This works for Excel XP on Windows, I'm not sure if it would work for any
other system.

Let me know if this would help.

Andrew
