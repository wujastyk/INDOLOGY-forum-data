Subject: Geldner's Rgveda transl. reprinted
Message-ID: <161227073360.23782.2371478628930102455.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Some weeks  ago the reprint of K.F. Geldner's translation of the Rigveda
(HOS 33-35) has finally been  released as HOS 63. It had been long out of
print.

The work has conveniently been bound in a ONE volume paperback; it
includes Geldner's twenty page additions and corrections (from HOS 36).

The 1300 pp. vol. is conveniently priced at $ 50. Available from Harvard
U.Press (Cambridge, MA  & London, UK)

We expect that this work, which has heavily influenced all major
translations done in the 20th century, will be of continued use to
scholars.
