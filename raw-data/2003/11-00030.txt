I have read mukta-vidyaapii.tha in the context
of Yashwantrao Chavan
Maharashtra Open University. Unfortunately, the
website of this institution
is still under construction. So, I could not
see how it speaks of itself in
Marathi. However, I did notice the following:

At

http://www.geocities.com/conceptstudies/Links_to_colleges.htm
one can
find a list of open universities in India. The
links lead to e-mail
addresses. If you find the time to do so, pl.
ask on each e-mail address how

in the local language.

For practical reasons I will not participate in
the discussion, but you can
forward, if you wish, my findings to the list.

Best wishes.
