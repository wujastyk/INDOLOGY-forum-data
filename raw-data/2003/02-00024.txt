Dear List members,
I'm probably barking up the wrong slaughtering-post putting my list on
Indology, but in case one of your graduate students might need one or more
of the following books, I  have to dispose of them -- contact me at
jkirk at spro.net
If further ID is needed for anything just ask. Reasonable......Joanna
