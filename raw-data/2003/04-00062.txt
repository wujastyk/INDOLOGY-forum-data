I thuink tht Romila Thaper is the apt person for the post in the Kluge
Chair
in Countries and Cultures of the South at Library of Congress.Any
movement
against the appointment by the Hindu fenatics is na attack against the
accadamic freedsom .So at any rate accadaqmisions and Reserchers in
whole
field of knowledge should ,react to the attack at any rate.
