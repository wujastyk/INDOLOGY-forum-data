Dear Friends

I have encountered the following passage in Purnabhadra's recension of the
Pancatantra:

"astronomical specialities such as predictions, prophecies, horoscopy,
augury, the division of each house of the zodiac into three, nine, twelve
and thirty, the shadow of the gnomon, naSTa, muSTi, [their influence on the]
elements [of the body], their houses, [their influences on] life and
thoughts, culaka, and mASaka."

Can anyone help me with the terms naSTa, muSTi, culaka and mASaka?

Many thanks

McComas
