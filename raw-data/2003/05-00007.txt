Dear Indologists,

On p. 54 of his "India as Known to Paa.nini" (2nd ed.), Agrawala states that
"[the] Divyaavadaana refers to the ;Svasas in Uttaraapatha with headquarters
at Taksha;silaa to which A;soka was deputed by his father Bindusaara as
Viceroy to quell their rebellion" and suggests that the same name may be
connected with the name of the ;Sibis.
    In neither the GRETIL electronic text (input by Kensuke Okamoto based on
the Vaidya ed.) nor in the two indexes of the Cowell/Neil ed. have I found a
trace of these ;Svasas. Can somebody who is better versed in this field of
literature (and more familiar with the available research tools) perhaps set
me on the right track towards verification of Agrawala's statement?

Many thanks!
