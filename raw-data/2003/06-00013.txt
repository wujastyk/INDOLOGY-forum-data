>?From which source is this half ;sloka taken?

The following, which he quotes from an answer
from R.P. Goldman, could be a starting point:

?As I have seen the verse, it is apparent that it
is from a version of the Ramayana story. Rama, it
appears, utters the verse to Lakshmana at some
point, probably in the Yuddhakanda. The full
verse runs:

Api svarnamayi lanka na me lakshmana rocate/

Janani janmabhumish casvargad api gariyasi//

I do not care for Lanka, Lakshmana, even though
it be made of gold.

One?s mother and one?s native land are worth more
even than heaven.?

?but I am not really sure, off the top of my
head, what the exact textual source is?I would
suggest checking other Sanskrit versions such as
the Ananda Ramayana, Kshemendra?s
Ramayanamanjari, Campuramayana etc.?

Best regards,
Jan Houben
