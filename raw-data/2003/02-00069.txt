Thanks, Prof. Kirkpatrick,

I think the easiest way is to go to
 http://www.dw-world.de/english
which allows you to access the internet broadcast of D.Welle - i f  you
have a  player installed in  your machine, such as/especially:   Real
Player.

(freely avalaible at http://www.real.com)

When you open  http://www.dw-world.de/english  and click on DW-TV live,
in the  upper right corner, this will automatically open a new, smaller
window [with Real Player] with the live broadcast.


(It will initially, before/while down loading, also give you the
opportunity to open your own (already installed) "external player", such as
Real Player. Sometimes better than the DW-window)


{{ All of this is also available in other languages, such as Spanish,
Hausa, Serbian, Indian langs., etc., thus:  http://www.dw-world.de/spanish
To choose these, go to "language selector" in upper part of first window }}

***

As for short wave, it certainly is a possibility but that would be
DW-Radio, not DW_TV.
Radio is avaibable online as well (go to upper right corner of 1st window)

I do not know current short wave frequencies.  General rule : try lower
ones in the evening (such as 49 m / 6 MHz) and higher ones in day time (25
m/ 11.5 MHz) for America; for Asia, generally, even higher frequencies will
work, such as 13 m/25 Mhz, 16, 19 m bands, etc.
PS:  I now see this note on frequencies :
http://www.dw-world.de/german/0,3367,4137,00.html

However, it seems that the MM program is only broadcast on TV (?)

***

The first MM program (saw it last night) provides some general cultural
background and reports on MM's stay in Leipzig, Paris and London. You can
also see  some of our current Indological colleagues, in interviews,  incl.
A. Michaels, D. Rothermund, R. Thapar....

***

NB:  I just see that later in February there will be a Radio program on
Nepalese Music / G.M. Wegner, who has started a Univ. Dept. of Nepalese
Music at Kathmandu a few years ago and who is a good Newari style drummer
himself....

Hope this helps.
