>religious texts with a special focus on notions of the common or public
>good; ideal forms of gender and familiar relations; theories of justice
>and political authority; and relations between deities and mortals, rulers
>and ruled, or nature and humans; the interrelationships among religions
>theologies, canons, philosophies, practices, and folk beliefs; historical
>and contemporary studies of growth or decay of syncretic traditions in
>religious texts and practices; the role and function of pilgrimage
>centres, as well as the management of religious institutions; and the
>rise, decline, and renewal of shramanic traditions within Indic
>civilisation; the politics of conversion in history or in contemporary
>India; and the limits of religions authority and the role of dissenters
>and outsiders; the impact of nationalism on beliefs and practices; Gandhi
