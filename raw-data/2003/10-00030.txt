As someone who has read the messages in this thread with interest, I would like
to join Roland Steiner in thanking Michael Hahn for his indeed extremely
helpful comments (and the conjecture), and also to say that his (Roland's)
understanding of sajjanajana seems to me natural, and the compound, as Roland
implies, not problematic. I might just add that aside from the parallel from
the Chapa.n.nayagaahaao that Roland mentions, the compound can be
found elsewhere in Sanskrit. I believe there is an occurrence in
Suuktimuktaavalii 57.22d--Krishnamacharya's edition prints sajjana janai.h, as
if sajjana were a separate vocative, but this is probably a typo, and if it is
not a typo but deliberate I think it to is a misjudgement (although this verse
is admittedly itself not without its problems). This might perhaps be
questioned; but in the second verse of an unpublished Hevajrasaadhana (the
Bhava"suddhih.rdyatilaka by Kokadatta [alias Karu.naabala?]) I think there is
virtually no doubt at all that we have another occurrence: the verse begins
nir.niitatattvasubhagaa gu.nino mahaanto ye santi sajjanajanaa.h... (MS
Niedersaechsische Staats- und Universitaetsbibliothek Goettingen Xc 14/39 f.
123v).

As for svargasya dharmalopa.h, admittedly indeed problematic, I wonder if the
text nonetheless might be acceptable as it stands, taking the genitive to be a
sambandha.sa.s.thii and relating it with dharma- (so the compound would be
saapek.sa). I don't have enough experience with this text to feel any real
confidence about this possibility.
