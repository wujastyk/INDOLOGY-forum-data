Dear colleagues,

I have been asked to suggest items for publication in the form of
facsimile editions, and wonder if members of the list might be in a
position to help.

There are no specific criteria except that the resulting book(s) will
have a good market in international academic and other particular
specialist libraries worldwide, and any additional readership that the
particular volume(s) might have.

There is particular interest in printing editions of original Sanskrit
manuscripts or out-of-print classic Sanskrit texts, in order to issue
these for wider readership worldwide.

The format would probably be: a facsimile of the original text
(manuscript or printed text), together with a translation on the facing
page or as the second part of the volume.

Suggestions should go directly to Sarah Lloyd, Commissioning
Editor, Ashgate Publishing Ltd (SLloyd at Ashgatepub.co.uk).

Thank you,
Julia Leslie
