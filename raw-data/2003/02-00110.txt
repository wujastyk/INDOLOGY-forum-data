Subject: XML/TEI-Sanskrit texts, anyone?
Message-ID: <161227072425.23782.2402899200254277912.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In June 2000 we have published in the IJTS the paper Magically Storming the
Gates of Buddhahood: Extensible Text Technology (XML/XSLT) as a Simulacrum
for Research by John Gardner. It might be useful to understand the new
tools, I think.
