Since my original plea for help, several people have volunteered suggestions
or pratical help.  However, apart from the Unicode issue, another problem
seems to be the challenge of sorting bi- or even tri-lingual work lists.
Does your sort program enable users to handle a list in which a line would
be structured thus --  [SKT] [TIB] [CHIN]  -- by fields or some other means
of delimitation ?  I think this will be a significant issue for some users.

Best wishes,
