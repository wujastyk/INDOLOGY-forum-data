The Srisukta and other Khilaani are of course part of the RV Khila 
collection, critically edited by I. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des 
Rgveda, Breslau 1906, reprint Hildesheim:Olms 1966. 

The Srisukta is RVKh 2.6 (accented) 

The Khilas are collected only in one extant MS, of Kashmir, which also
contains the little used Kashmirian RV. In India proper only bits and
pieces of the Khilas have been preserved, usually attached to one or the
other RV hymn, and already printed by M. Mueller, Aufrecht ( p. 672 sqq.;
Srisukta p. 674, no accents) 
Satavalekar, RV  has 36 of them. 
Recitation in Howard, SV Chant p. 494, from Udupi.

The khilas are of various ages. Some are Rvic, or early post-RVic 
(mentioning the 10 Kings Battle). Others (or parts of them) have Brahmana 
time grammar, others  (wrongly accented or completely unaccented!)
are still later (Epic/Puranic)...

For example: The Srisukta has 15 standard verses, some have 19 (only in 
Kashmir), but there are various further additions, up to 30 verses. I 
have even seen a Buddhist version of it in Nepal.
