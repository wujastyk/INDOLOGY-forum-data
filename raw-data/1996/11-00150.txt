May I ask Robert Zydenbos the following question: Is there any other Indic
language than Hindi that offers a certain amount of "transnational"
communication (and does so better than Hindi)? 

His remarks about English are of course correct: Eating dinner at the Musee
d'Orsay yesterday, I excused myself to the waiter for my poor French and he
replied: "Our English is not so good either". But he *was* able to
communicate, and there is a great likelihood that if you come to a European
country the language of which you do not speak, English is your best bet if
you try to use another language. It would seem to me that the same thing
applies to Hindi, and that the study of Hindi for this reason should be a
priority. (Unless some other Indic language is a better means of
communication). Anybody disagree, and if, why?

Best regards,
