One of the problems with Velthuis's otherwise excellent
Devanagari font is the lack of hyphenation tables.  This 
makes it very difficult to typeset Devanagari text that
is visually very long, either due to samAsa or sandhi,
since right-justification now becomes an impossibility
due to word wrap.  The ornate, samAsa laden literature
exemplified by Bana's ``kAdambari'', for example, just 
does not look right when typeset using this font.

Has anyone else encountered this problem? If someone
has a solution, I would love to hear it.
