On the 1st or 2nd of February, I posted on this list information about the
guaranteed / not-subject-to-enrollment summer Sanskrit course at the
University of British Columbia and about the summer Mythological literature
of South Asia in Translation course at the same institution. 

In that posting, I stated that the two courses would meet on the same days
of the week but the Sanskrit course in the morning and the mythology course
in the afternoon. Kindly note that both courses will meet in the morning on
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, from 9:00 A.M. to noon.
