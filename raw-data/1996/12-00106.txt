Hello Axel, happy to hear of you again. The whole Edition / transliteration
of the text is almost ready (i.e. it needs some proof-reading, and some
details are missing in the notes). Translation is in progress. The latest
thing I wrote on the subject is in the BEI, I'd be delighted, a.s.o... just
send me your adress.

I'd be delighted to read it, so here's my adress.

(dharmAdhikAr ?) I have different versions of the text and feel that a lot
of additions made between 1910-1925 BS to the second part of the Ain
originated from the dharmAdhikAr (himself or his office) [taste for endless
repetitions, particulars of style (archaisms?), etc.], but this has to be
confirmed by further evidence.

I did some research on ujIra siMha thApA's handbook (Paper by B.D. DaGgol;
nice and careful ed. by D.R. Pant, in pUrNimA), a paper should be forthcoming.  
I am 'tutoring' a student who works on local paJcayats in India from an
'ethno-juridical' point of view, I suppose that it will oblige me to
scrutinize procedural rules a little closer (especially eating of rice /
drinking of water by the kacahari's members).

Nice to know you are near someone interested in the subject, we are at least
three of this kind in this world. Transmit my greetings to A.H.

Best wishes and greetings, Jean
