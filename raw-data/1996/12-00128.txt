<verse>: From drinking strained water, a juiceless, vile drink, the asses
became drunk. /  But the Sindh horses which drank the choice liquor did not
become drunk.

I wonder if someone would be kind and generous enough to provide me the Pali
text for this (along with the line numbers in the PTS edition, or the
reference to whatever edition you quote from).

With deep gratitude, in advance,
Jonathan Silk
