Subject: The word BATUKA
Message-ID: <161227025184.23782.18007116304600627626.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I would be grateful if someone could help me with the etymology
and exact meaning of the word BATUKA which has the dictionary
meaning " temple priest". 
The only related word I know is BATU that is used for a boy
about to have his threading ceremony.
Thank you in advance.
Jayant
