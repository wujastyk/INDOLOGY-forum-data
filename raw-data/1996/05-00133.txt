At least two non Buddhist Hindu works found their way into the Chinese
Buddhist canon:

	   1. Taisho shinshu daizokyo, no. 2138: Sheng zong shi ju yi lun
	      (something like: *Da"sapadaartha"saastra). This is a
	      Vai"se.sika work, it has been translated into English by
	      Hakuju Ui (and Frederick William Thomas), London 1917. (I have
	      the exact references not at hand.) The famous Xuanzang made
	      the Chinese translation (this sets the terminus ad quem).

	   2. Taisho, no. 2137: Jin qi shi lun (something like
	      *Suvar.nasaptati"saastra). This is a translation of
	      II"svarak.r.s.na's (sorry if this transliteration looks odd)
	      Saa.mkhyakaarika together with a prose commentary
	      (unidentified so far I know). I am only aware of Junjiro
	      Takakusu's French translation and study: "La Saa.mkhyakaarikaa
	      etudiee a la lumiere de sa version chinoise", in: BEFEO 4
	      (1904) (I have left out the accented characters, because some
	      mail transfer agents do not know MIME). Its Chinese translator
	      was Paramaartha (6th century) (this sets the terminus ad quem,
	      too).

Other works of non Buddhist origin are certainly to be found in citations,
but to fetch them all will be a superhuman task, I think.
