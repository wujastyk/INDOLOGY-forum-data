Dear INDOLOGY-list members,

I'm looking for the following book:

             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
             +        _ _   _ _                               + 
             +       MUVAR TEVARAM (7 vols),                  +
             +       published by the Dharmapura Adinam,      +
             +       Dharmapuram, 1953-1964.                  +
             +                                                + 
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Can you please check whether this title can be found in your place? If you
know about any person who has the book in his personal property, please let
me know too. I have to make a copy of it for it seems to be the only reliable 
commented edition of Tevaram, which is a topic of my PhD thesis.

Thank you.
