Also no one "brough" Sanskrit into India. From the very name it implies that
Sanskrit is a language that was "created" for the specific purpose of
representing AND preserving the the philosophical and cultural wealth of the
ancient Indians, a task that would have been difficult if any of the
traditional languages like Tamil etc. were to be used, since it would have
identified this wealth with a community and thus would sysamatically have
been undermined by others. Time has proven this. No one in India has a
passionate objection to the Sanskrit language, but I am sure that one can
find a lot of people objecting to all other languages of India.
