Claude Setzer sure gets thumbs down from this corner.
It took 15 min, if not more, just to download his opus magna, the second
part of which froze my computer and messed up all my Eudora boxes.
Would it be at all possible to have some kind of consideration, even if
condescending, for those rare minority beings who are not into computer
sciences these days?
Best,
