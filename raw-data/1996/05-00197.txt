Dear sirs:

  Thanks to my subscription to INDOLOGY I have come to know your publication
International Journal of Hindu Studies. My main interest in the hindu world ar
languages, both Indoeuropean -the indic branch- and Dravidian. I would like to
know if this topics are treated in your journal in order to decide to make
my subscription.

	Thanks for the time devoted!
