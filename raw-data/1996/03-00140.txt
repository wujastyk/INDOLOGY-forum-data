Bangladesh at 25: A Symposium
Tuesday, March 26, 1996    1-5:30 pm
Kellogg Center, 15th floor
School of International & Public Affairs
420 West 118th Street
Columbia University
New York, NY
                   
The symposium celebrates Bangladesh's first twenty-five years as a nation 
and highlight the untold story of the country's development.  Dismissed 
as an "international basket case" at birth, Bangladesh has continued to 
draw media attention primarily for its poverty and natural disasters.  The
successful initiatives and struggles of the people of Bangladesh in
tackling poverty and maintaining a democratic, secular and tolerant
society have generally gone unnoticed.  The seminar focuses on
macro-level trends in development as well as some innovative initiatives 
(e.g. Grameen Bank, BRAC, Nijera Kari, Banchte Shekha) in the fields of 
credit, non-formal education, health, population, human rights and 
women's empowerment.
