Dear members of the list,
i'm looking for a Hindi book with the title "Kissa Tota Myna" or it's
English translation "The Story of the Parrot and the Starling".
i read that it was also published in Tamil titled "Matankamarajan Katai".
Any information about these books which are supposed to be based on
"Shukasaptati" would be of great help to me.
thanks
tobias
