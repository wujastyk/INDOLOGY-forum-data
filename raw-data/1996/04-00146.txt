As a parallel, this is essentially the greatness of the "kuRaL" 
form too, as used in the immortal TirukkuRaL of TiruvaLLuvar.
The historian P.T.Srinivasa Iyengar (1863-1931) mentions in 
one of his books, in passing, this verse form of the TirukkuraL's 
teachings as against the largely prosaic ;-) form of Sanskrit 
dars'ana literature.
