Message-ID: <161227023957.23782.9092432964589677539.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have been trying to get setup to try the new Wikner Devanagari font
but my software tools are not up to compiling the preprocessor "skt.c".
Is anybody that can compile this willing to send me an uuencoded executable?
I use the path "\emtex\texinput\latex2e\skt.opt" for the option file
that is referred to by the define statement at the beginning of the c file.
Thanks for any help you can provide.
