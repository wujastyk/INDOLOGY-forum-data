remember its address, but you can find it at the Web site below. From 
there go to Links useful for the Study of Asia. Then you might want to go 
to South Asia. There you will find news resources, updated daily, for 
India and Pakistan, particularly The Hindu and Dawn, respectively. Also, 
there is a news service for Nepal, but I forget exactly where in that 
links file I put it. It should be easily findable, however. 

Best,
