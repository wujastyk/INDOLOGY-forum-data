Colleagues:

Having raised the caution flag earlier today, I checked on the British
Library web site and found the following:

                      Oriental & India Office Collections
                                       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   To assist those planning to use the Oriental & India Office
   Collections during 1998 or 1999 the following information is provided
   about the transfer of the Oriental & India Office Collections from
   Orbit House, 197 Blackfriars Road, to the new British Library building
   at St Pancras, Euston Road, London NW1.
     * The move of the OIOC collections is expected to take place over a
       9-month period between Spring 1998 and Spring 1999
     * The Reading Room at Orbit House will remain open until the start
       of the move, but with some material being unavailable during the
       last 3 months
     * There will be no Reading Room service from OIOC collections for a
       period of 4 months from shortly after the start of the move
     * The new Oriental and India Office Reading Room in the St Pancras
       building will open at the end of this closed period, but some
       material may still not be available initially
     * Full services from all parts of the collections will be resumed
       within 5 months of the opening of the new Reading Room
       
Enquiries and photographic service

   Every effort will be made to maintain other Oriental & India Office
   Collections services as normally as possible during 1998 and 1999, but
   there may well be delays in answering enquiries by letter, fax or
   e-mail during this period, and the processing of reprographic /
   photographic orders may well also be delayed.
