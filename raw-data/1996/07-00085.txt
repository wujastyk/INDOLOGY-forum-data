In response to the many complaints that the original file (8 Mbyte) 
was not viewable on screen, another version (5 Mbyte) was released
which is; however, there are now many complaints that the latest file
is unprintable (sigh).

Until such time as the problem is resolved (I have not yet found a VMS
version of GhostScript 4.0) both files are available at the original
site: the files that definitely do print are
ftp://ftp.nac.ac.za/wikner/sktintro.ps600-a4paper-june96-zip
ftp://ftp.nac.ac.za/wikner/sktintro.ps600-letter-june96-zip
The are ZIP files, each about 1 Mbyte.

My apologies to you and others, for the confusion and inconvenience.
