For you and anyone else who may be scratching their heads, "andolya" turned
out to be a misreading. The word in question should be "andolii", which in
the context (astrological predictions of (royal) dignity) undoubtedly means
"palanquin". Sorry for wasting people's time. The question mark at
"vi.dvara" remains, however.

Thanks to Charles Wikner and George Thompson for their extremely helpful
comments on the word "upanishad". George's observation that:

>the term upanis.ad refers, like bandhu  nidaana,

-- definitely rings a bell. My half-remembered text was probably a review of
one of the articles mentioned.
