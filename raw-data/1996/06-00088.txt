Message-ID: <161227025070.23782.11302810225228208272.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


There have been several minor changes to the INDOLOGY web pages, as well
as the addition of some new links, etc.  I'm afraid I am not currently
documenting changes I make to the INDOLOGY web site, but I do keep it up
to date, with some work being done each week, and especially some
weekends.  So if you have not looked at the pages for a while, you may
expect to see some changes if you look again.

If you have a link that you think should be included on the INDOLOGY pages
somewhere, let me know.

Personal home pages change quite frequently, as people move about, whereas
library catalogues and institutional web sites are more stable.  So I am
particularly interested in links to major institutions, libraries, and
projects.  Since the amount of work in keeping a web site up to date
increases with the number of links it provides, I am interested in keeping
down the number of links from the INDOLOGY web site.  What I want is to
keep the links down to the minimum set that will provide you with the
maximum number of relevant further links.

Enjoy,

Dominik
