This is just a short note to pass on the very sad news that Alan W.
Entwistle, Associate Professor of Hindi, South Asian Studies, and
Comparative Religion at the University of Washington, died on Thursday,
March 28th in Seattle.  At the time of his death, Alan was 47 years
old.  For almost a decade Alan had suffered from a brain
tumor, for which he had undergone surgery, radiation treatment, and
chemotherapy.  For most of this time, Alan led a fully active personal and
professional life, with most of his colleagues, students, and
acquaintances unaware of his illness.  Alan's long period of remission
from the tumor ended approximately a year and a half ago, but Alan
courageously maintained his teaching and research schedule.  This past
October Alan retured to India to continue his research in Rajasthani
literature.  Unfortunately, Alan's health deteriorated seriously while in
India and he was forced to return to Seattle in January.

Alan is survived by his wife Albertine Smit, his sister, Janice Entwistle,
in London, and his father, William Entwistle, in Weymouth, England.
