A new list of interest to indologists has been started:

> As some of you know, a new list, Tantra-L is now up and running.  The 
> list was designed with three purposes in mind.  First, it will support 
> the five-year Tantric Studies Seminar of the American Academy of 
> Religion.  Second, Tantra-L should enhance interaction of the membership 
> of the Society for Tantric Studies.  Third, Tantra-L is designed to 
> provide a space for scholarly discussion concerning the tantras, both 
> within particular schools and traditions and hopefully across sectarian 
> and scholarly boundaries.  The list is closed (by subscription) but 
> unmoderated.  To subscribe send the following message to listserv at uncg.edu:
> 
> SUBSCRIBE TANTRA-L YOUR NAME

> Other inquiries should be directed to me, Charles D. Orzech 
> OrzechC at hamlet.uncg.edu.
> Thank you
