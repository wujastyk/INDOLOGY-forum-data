Kennedy's paper was presented in a conference held in 1991, but the
proceedings appeared only in late 1995 (the date on the preface is
September 1995). I think that the contributors revised their papers,
but I might be wrong.

The quotation from Kennedy's paper is from the paragraphs where he
summarizes the resultspresented by Hemphill, Lukacs and Kennedy,
``Biological adaptations and affinities of the Bronze Age Harappans'',
in Harappa Excavations 1986--1990, edited by R. Meadow. I presume
that this is the very same reference that Joe was referring to.

I did not try very hard get the Hemhill, Lukacs and Kennedy paper.
I just assume that Kennedy's summary of a paper of which he is
coauthor would be accurate.

Any way, the quote specifically states from where the `discontinuous'
samples came. Apparently, the distinction is between early 2nd millenium
skeleta and samples from populations dated to after 800 BCE (late
Bronze age and early Iron age of Sarai Khola). Given the difference
in time, this may not mean much.

No No :-). I got in there because I got riled by the articles in sci.lang
(I don't read sci.archaeology) that said `higher word count implies more
sophisticated language'. I have trouble keeping my mouth shut all the
time and get involved in the larger debate. But, I am getting better at
self control. Over the week-end, I aborted four or five follow-ups I
started.
