I currently have limited access to a Sanskrit edition of the Skanda Purana,
around five or six volumes.  I am trying to find the part that has the 108
names of each of the planets but am not having any success.  There is a shloka
index but it hasn't helped because previously I have only had the naamaavali
format in other books.

If anyone can make any suggestions about how to find this part of the purana
it would be greatly appreciated.
