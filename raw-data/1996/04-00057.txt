COME DEMONSTRATE AGAINST BARBARIC AND HORRENDOUS BATTERRER MOHAMMED MOHSIN

When: Tomorrow - Saturday, April 13, 1996 at 3 p.m.

Where: In front of Mr. Mohsin's home at 169-11 Highland Avenue, Jamaica,
New York (corner of Highland Ave. and Homelawn St.; F train to 169 St. in
Queens)

On September 13, 1995, Mr. Mohammad Mohsin doused his wife Ms. Syeda
Sufian, with gasoline and set her on fire. To this day, Syeda suffers from
severe burns all over her body. Mr. Mohsin is a batterer who subjected his
wife to physical, economic, and emotional violence throughout their
marriage.

Mr. Mohsin is currently out on bail, awaiting a formal indictment for the
crime he committed. Since his release, he and his family have mounted a
campaign of terror against Syeda by threathening to kill her.

SAKHI for South Asian Women, an organization fighting violence against
women, is asking everyone to join us this Saturday to show our support for
Syeda.

WE demand that Mr. Mohsin be held accountable for his heinous crime. We
demand JUSTICE for Syeda and all battered women.


YOUR PRESENCE WILL COUNT VERY MUCH GIVEN THE ALMOST OVERNIGHT PLANNING OF
THIS CALL FOR MOBILIZATION
