Well, we do know some things clearly, but that there was a Ramagupta of the
Gupta dynasty, much less that he was killed by his successor, we do NOT know. 
If I ever get around to finishing it I have written a piece on the
historiography of the ramagupta legend, which shows well the influences of
ideology on the study of history.  What is history and what is legend is, in
this case especially, very hard to distingish.

Cheers, jonathan
