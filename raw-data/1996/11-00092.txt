I could not agree more:

>>  The young scholar should be sure to have
    a "cash" language that he or she can teach. <<< (B.Hueckstedt)


Precisely because of this --- and also because <useful secondary>
literature exists in modern S.Asian languages --- I have been insisting,
and we have made it, at long last and not without resistance, a
requirement in our first new graduate study program (since the provisional
one of '84!): 

-- that students also learn Hindi/Urdu or another modern S. Asian language.
