Subject: Statistics (was `Out of India')
Message-ID: <161227027495.23782.2319474254978483348.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I would like to echo Lars Martin Fosse's sentiments re. discussions of
statistical Indological research.  The list's indulgence permitting, there
is much value in this line of discussion.  With our e-text resources, the
frontier of electronic research is wide open.  I am curiousif others have
worked along these lines and what methodological structures presented
themselves therefrom.  I have been loaned a copy of a Mac program called
GoldVarb, a linguistic analysis script-come-program for tracking
regressions--which, I understand thus far, amount to "error patterns."  Is
anyone familiar with this software and/or could suggest a known quanta in
the RV or ZB which might be tested along these lines?
