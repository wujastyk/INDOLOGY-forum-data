The title of this Kannada work is not Siri Boovalaya but Siribhuuvalaya. The author of this work is Kumudendu, a Jaina writer (circa 800 AD).  The date is debatable.  Some scholars attribute it to a later date. 

It is said in this work that the author is the disciple of Jinasenaacaarya and the Guru of Amoghavarsha Nripatunga.  It is written in a typical Kannada prosody called Sangatya.   

For a little more information, see on page 57 of  'Samagra Kannada Sahitya Charitre' Vol 1 edited by Dr G S Shivarudrappa, published by the Department of Publications & Extension Lectures, Bangalore University, Bangalore - 560 056, Karnataka, India.

 dns> information is most appreciated.

Unfortunately I will be here in the Netherlands for the next two months, and
not at home in Mysore, where I have a copy of the book (part one; the work has
not yet been published in its entirety, to my knowledge).

I have not read it completely yet, but there is a lot of hazy mystique (and
anecdotes that sound like horror stories) about it. To begin with, it is not
only in Kannada: it is a kind of citrakavya, and if you run through the text in
different directions, you get verses in Telugu and Sanskrit too.

The weirder side of it is that according to some, the text contains formulae
for making gold out of base metals. Of course I'm in no position whatsoever to
make any comment on that.
