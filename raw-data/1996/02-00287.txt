        Many thanks to all the scholars on the list who made very valuable
comments on my query about saris.
        Actually this query comes originally from the head of the Asian
department of the Ethnographical Museum of Geneva. They have a very
beautiful collection of rare and old saris they plan to exhibit this
summer. So if any member of the list is in Geneva during summer, please
visit it. They have a web site on
http://www.ville-ge.ch/gve_guid/musgal/ethno/methno.htm.

Thanks again.
