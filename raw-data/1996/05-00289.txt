Subject: Dakshina meaning and derivation
Message-ID: <161227024680.23782.8778283523984538443.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Martin,
Lithuanian: dezinas, once
In RV. i.100.9 dakSiNa seems linked to root dakS hence meaning dexterous,
ability. In Hindi, dahinA means right (apparent reference to the more
dexterous right hand)
When an altar is set to the right  hand side, dakSiNA, (in relation to the
eastern direction faced by the priest), it refers o the southern fire of the
altar. 

Maybe, it is not a donation but a fee offered or share of the SOMA
(electrum) for dexterous service.

dakSA is also interpreted as living energy in JBr. i.151

It is also 'dawn' in RV. vi.64.1: tasmA iyam dakSiNA pinvate sadA bhUmirapi
sasyAdisampAdanadakSA: uSas.

>I am interested in the word - dakshina -. I have seen it as a direction ,
south or southern. I have also seen it as donation. What is the connection?
Also, are there references to daksina in Upanishads or Veda with regard to
donation? I also heard that dakshina is derived from da and ksha. Any info
on that?
