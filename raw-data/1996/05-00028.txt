In answer to Leo Facq's query, I think the book in question is

Devavanipravesika : an introduction to the Sanskrit language
by Robert P. Goldman with Sally J. Sutherland
(1987, second printing with corrections: 1992)
 
Distributed by:

Center for South and Southeast Asia Studies,
Publications Program
2223 Fulton Street, 3rd floor

(Library of Congress Catalog Number 81-68583)

I hope this helps.
