Prof. H. Kulke has moved to the Univ. of Kiel (Germany), where he now teaches
Asian history in the Dept. of History. To my knowledge none of the participants
in the Heidelberg Orissa project with philological interests are any longer at
Heidelberg.

Another person who has concentrated on Oriya / Orissan studies is John Boulton.
He used to work at SOAS, London, I believe, but he may have retired by now.
