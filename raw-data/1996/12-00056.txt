Thank you for the citation, but the copy our libraries have here seem to
be missing. Alas! Probably stuck somewhere on a reshelving cart. Is this a
rather easy to acquire text? If so, perhaps an inter-library loan is in
order.

The latter text I can get (Kumbakonam), the Boehtlingk I cannot.
Nonetheless, I will refer to this to examine the differences.

Thank you for your time.
