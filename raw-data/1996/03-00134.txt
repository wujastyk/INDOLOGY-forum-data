"definitely 'studium' (partisanship) which easily clouds the view of the whole
picture and ultimately makes the attainment of something like the truth
impossible...."

The clue actually can be found in Paul Courtright's very informative article,
which tells about Wilson's competition, Rev. Mills.

Max Mueller had the missionary zeal (it is clear from his letter to his wife).
