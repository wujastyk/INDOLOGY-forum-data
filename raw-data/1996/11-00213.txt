This story is found in several puraanas: 
        vaamana p. 25.1 and following
        ziva zatarudra 33.1 -
        ziva vaayaviiya 1.18.4-
        vaamana p 6.25,-
        ziva p 2.2 and following (daksha's sacrifice)
        kaalikaa p  2-42

There a few essays in "The Divine Consort.  Radha and the Goddessess of
Inida" which address the issue of Sati's dismemberment and the associations
of places where parts of her body fell with pithas.

Also,  David Kinsley's "The Hindu Goddess, Visions of the Divine Feminine
inthe Hindu Religious Tradition" has a chapter entitled 'The Goddess and
Sacred Geography.'

These are few places to start.

Good luck
