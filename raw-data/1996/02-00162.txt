Subject: maRai, its meaning; WHOSE VEDA? - Bhaashya
Message-ID: <161227022804.23782.11891760988731798743.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

What is the meaning of maRai in Tamil?

maRai = concealment (puRanA.50); secret (kuRaL, 590); the vEdas, as secret
(tol.ezhut.102). It would appear that the secrecy is the key attribute of
the vedic
tradition continued by the siddhas of Tamil alchemical lore. In Tamil vedi-iyal
connotes alchemy.

The links with veda and Tamil may also be found thru Malayalam.
