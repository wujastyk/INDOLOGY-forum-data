Taking this thread, would it be appropriate to pose another series of questions?
Why animal sacrifice? What is the economic advantage of using bones in smelting
operations by, say, a blacksmith, goldsmith, coppersmith or metallurgist?
Aren't bones reducing agents to oxidize baser elements to yield pure gold
or silver or other metal which had economic value?
