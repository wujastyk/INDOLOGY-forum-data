powerful shakti peeth, as far as I am concerned.

>No, but if we could be kept up to date on any scholarly or celebratory
>action with respect to this great Maharashtran poet/saint, it would be

>beautiful, peaceful spots I had ever seen. Is it still that way?  Or has
>overpopulation and commercialization robbed it of its charm?
