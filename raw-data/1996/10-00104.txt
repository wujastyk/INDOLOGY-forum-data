(Apologies for double posting.)

I am looking for the _B.rhacchabdaratnavyAkhyA_ by Bhavadeva. This is a 
commentary on Hari DIk.sita's _B.rhacchabdaratna_, which is a commentary 
on Bha.t.toji DIk.sita's _Prau.dhamanoramA_, which is a commentary on his 
own _VaiyAkara.nasiddhAntakaumudI_. The interlibrary loan people here 
have come up with no "hits" in any library of the major universities in 
Canada or the major US universities that are in its data base. Any help, 
suggestions or pointers are greatly appreciated.

Gratefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
