I am not in a position to discuss the intricacies of the agreement 
that made this project possible. All this is more than 25 years ago, 
and I assume, both sides achieved whatever was possible at the time.

Well, it may be easier for German nationals. What D. Wujastyk did
not mention, though, is that everyone, irrespective of nationality,
can apply for microfilms from the National Archives (the former
Durbar Library), Kathmandu. In this way the charge for the copies
directly contributes to the maintenance of the institution that
takes care of the manuscripts. Not such a bad idea after all, is it?
At least I cannot see any harm in that. And it is still relatively
easy going, compared to the obstacles you sometimes have to overcome
in order to get mss. from other parts of the world.
