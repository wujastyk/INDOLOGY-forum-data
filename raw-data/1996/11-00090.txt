Subject: Query on translation of "anushAsana-parvan"

M.N. Dutt's translation is useful, especially because he gives verse numbers
(not from the critical edition, of course).  Actually, Roy's translation is
largely based on Dutt's.
Dutt's translation of the entire epic has been reprinted by Parimal
Publications, Delhi.  The anushasana is in vol. 7.
