I think that the context shows that I was referring to grammatical
traditions, not languages.  An important distinction.  My impression is
that Ganesan wanted to know where the tradition of grammatical analysis
came from, *not* where retroflexes came from.  As for the latter, I think
that H.H. Hock has shown that it is not at all obvious that they came into
Skt. from Dravidian.
