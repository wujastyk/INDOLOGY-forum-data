Correct.

Apart from that, I would not call it a conspiracy as that would involve 
secrecy, hypocracy in public, and hidden agendas. 

On the contrary, the Vedic Brahmins were quite open about their agenda and
motives: to form an alliance with the Ksatriyas (brahma-ksatra) in order
to exploit the rest of the people. They do so, with Marxist analysis
before its day, in the texts composed by them for their own class (and
especially their students, including ksatriyas and ... vaisyas!): 

Read , e.g.:

ZB 6.4.4.12-13 Vaizya and ZUdra are the subjects of the Brahmins and the
Ksatriyas. -- See also AB 3.11; KB 3.5; 9.5; AB 7.19; 8.7; KB 12.8; 16.4
They say: "why is the brahma-kzatra unstable, the subjects stable?" ...
Therefore the Brahmins rule the people insecurely, insecurely also the
Kzatriyas; therefore are the subjects stable"; 19.1; TB 3.8.4.3; 9.16.4;
BZS 18.2:10; ZZS 14.29.3. 

For details see W. Rau, Staat und Gesellschaft, Wiesbaden 1957 (!), p. 
59-60, 118: many examples of how they exploit the viz (an important item
missing in R. Thapar, Lineages), A.  Weber, Ind.Stud. 10, 26-35; M.
Witzel, Early Sanskritization, in EJVS 1-4 (ejvs-list at shore.net;
www.shore.net/~india/ejvs)

Note that the Vedic Brahmins pretend to be pre-eminent and semi-independent: 
"Soma is our king" they say in the royal consecration. They accept orders 
only from him and not from the king whom they just have consecrated.

The texts, however, also stress that the nobility is the "eater" and the
Brahmins are their "food", see Rau, Staat, p.34 n.6.-- something similar
to the view of the early Buddhist texts about the pre-eminence of the
Ksatriyas.

It should be noted that the *fourfold* varna classification appears only in
the *late* Rgveda (Purusa hymn, 10.90) and the word zuudra is found there
for the very first time. 

All of this is part of the late Rgvedic Bharata/Kuru "reform", see above 
on the Kurus.
