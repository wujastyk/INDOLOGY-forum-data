While I haven't been following the ins and outs of the flames in relation 
to this topic, I do have a suggestion for further inquiry about this 
temple site.  Gregory Alles writes an insightful article in _The History 
of Religions_ vol. 28, no. 1 (August 1988), entitled "Surface, Space and 
Intention:  The Parthenon and the Kandariya Mahadeva."  While he compares 
Greek temple building with Indian, he relates the meanings of the temple 
as "instruments of pwer intended to glorify two new imperial regimes." ( 
4) He then proceeds to characterize each culture's self-image based on 
the characteristics of the temples.  His evidence for this thesis 
consists of connecting the structures' surface ornamentations and spatial 
dimensions with Greek and Indian political organization and religious 
practice, respectifully.  He explains that the Greeks of the Parthenon's 
period concentrated on physique and war-power to sustain their rule; thus 
the Parthenon will detail the strained musculature of horses and warriors 
in war-time activities.  He notes that 10th cent. India developed 
controlled breath and mind as forms of strength, the Kandariya Mahadeva 
will position bodies in ascetic and esoteric postures.  In short, he 
argues that the temples' facades and their 3-d spaces correspond to 
social arrangements with the respective societies.  

In more detail about the KM:  Alles explains that the surface 
characteristics (the sculpted figures whose bodies are accented by full, 
spherical breasts, exaggerated hips, dripping with jewelry and 
transparently clothed) obscure the shape of the sculpture such that what 
catches the eye is the grandeur of the temple rather than its interior 
purpose:  Saivite devotional practice and maintenance of the deity.  

Read the article; it's helpful in making sense of the figures that you
