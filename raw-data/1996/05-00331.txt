Subject: 'Fanciful' etymologies (was re. dating)
Message-ID: <161227024756.23782.11062415605751287070.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is there an equivalent in Sanskrit to TolkAppiyam which says:
ellAccollum poruL kuRittanavE (Tol. Peya.1) "All words are semantic indicators."
Phonetics and semantics do intermingle in fanciful ways as a society finds
the need
for expressing 'enlarged' thoughts? or to absorb  'sermons' from paNDitas?

Regards. Kalyanaraman
