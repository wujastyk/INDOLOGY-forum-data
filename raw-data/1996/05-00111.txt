For # 1 the Samanna phala Sutta in the Diigha Nikaaya 2.ff has a nice 
list of different groups from the Buddhist point of view, some more 
easily identifiable, such as the Aajiivika Makkhali Gosaalo and the 
materialist Ajita Kezakambalin, and others less so.  All are refuted of 
course, though not necessarily presented as heretical.

Sincerely,
