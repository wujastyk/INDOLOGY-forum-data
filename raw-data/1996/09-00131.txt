Hinduja Fellow
Post-doctoral Fellowship

Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center
Columbia University

The Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center at Columbia University
invites applications for a one-year post-doctoral fellowship for the
1997-98 academic year. The Hinduja Center supports research that
promotes a deeper understanding of Indic civilizations and their
contributions to our modern world. It is particularly interested in
funding projects that bring insights from Indic traditions to bear
upon contemporary problems, especially those related to health,
science, gender, conflict, ethics, education, the environment, and
interreligious understanding.

For the 1997-98 fellowship, priority will be given to applicants
pursuing research related to one of our five working groups whose
respective foci are as follows: healthcare, exact sciences, gender,
conflict management, and authority and its interpretation in Indic
traditions; applications related to other topics relevant to the
Center's objectives are also welcome. The stipend will be $30,000 plus
full fringe benefits; additional research funds will be made
available.  The Hinduja Fellow will be expected to teach one course
and to be an active member of Columbia University's Society of Fellows
in the Humanities.  Eligibility requirement: Doctoral degree must have
been received after January 1, 1991. The application deadline is
Monday, December 2, 1996.
