Dominik, Eric has a point with which I personally sympathize, even if I
agree that something has to be done with the more idiotic contributions
that have hit the screens lately. Would it be possible to construct a
system with graded privileges? E.g.: Full privileges: Being able to do what
we have been doing so far; Restricted privileges: Only being able to *read*
mail from the Indology server. If graded privileges are technically
feasible, it would seem a fair solution to me. Full privileges could then
be granted to persons with an Indological education (active scholars,
students etc.) If somebody abuses the net, then it would be possible to
remove his/hers writing privilege, and the serious netters would not be
bothered.

Best regards,
