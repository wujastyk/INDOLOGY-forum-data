Hi,

I think that the question needs to be refocused. Issues raised have been 
about wives' and deities positions and the difference between the North 
and the South. In our tradition the wife assumes either the left or the right
position depending on the circumstances. However, I believe that the 
question raised is not being answered. Would anyone please give an 
explanation for the difference between the two positions described below?  
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Incidentally, the first shloka gives the position of lakshmana and the 
marutis; would anyone please explain why they have these particular 
positions? Many thanks beforehand.
