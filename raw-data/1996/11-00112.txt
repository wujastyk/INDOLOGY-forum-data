Have you looked at B G Tilak's revisions of Jacobi's dating system, which
he apparently discussed with Max Muller as well (in London at an Oriental
Conference)? I am no expert in the field and have some suspicions about
Tilak's pre-Hindutva urges, but the speculations he comes with and the
astronomical evidence he adduces are rivetting for a late Dipawali
atfernoon! See his Vedas in the
Arctic Age, and Orion (both from Poona).

Cheers
