Dear Networkers,
I would very much like to subscribe to the TAMIL-L electronic conference, if
it is still in existence, but all my attempts to contact the 
<listserv at vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de> have so far failed. Is the listserv no 
longer active or is there a queue of those wishing to join so long that it
takes more than 5 days to get through? Gratefully Yours, Jan Filipsky 

<listserv at vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de>... Deferred: Connection timed out during initial connection with lsv.urz.uni-heidelberg.de.
