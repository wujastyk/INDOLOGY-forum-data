I'm sorry, but no.  This issue has been discussed many times in INDOLOGY's
five or six year life, and the consensus is always to have the list work
with the current defaults.  See back issues for the previous discussions
(use the keyword search facility offered by the Liverpool gopher).

Again, I don't mean to be harsh about this, but it isn't *very* hard to
reply to the right person, and mistakes don't happen all that often.  The
current defaults make free open discussion between indologists
particularly easy and convenient, which is the purpose of the list.

Best wishes, and take care of those fingers over the "r"!

Dominik
