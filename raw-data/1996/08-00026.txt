Dharma-caurya-rasaayana, a short text I have recently studied, was printed
in 1946 in Brahma-vidy? or the Adyar Library Bulletin. Could anyone kindly
give me the volume number (the photocopy I have does not contain the vol
no) and also clarify if the text was subsequently published as part of the
Adyar Library Text Series.

In verse 3.50, the Dharma-caurya-rasaayan uses the expression
arbhaa.ta-dhvani. Contextually, it should stand for some kind of loud noise
- some sound like that of an alarm which was made to attract the attention
of guards to a burglary etc. I have been unable to locate the word
arbhaa.ta in the dictionaries accessible to me. It is said to occur in the
usage of speakers in the Maharashtra-Karnataka border area in the sense of
'big, great' in a somewhat non-complimentary way. As the
Dharma-caurya-rasaayana was most probably written in south India by an
Andhra author, the word is very likely to come from a south Indian
language. Can anyone throw light on the precise meaning and, if possible,
the etymology of the word?
