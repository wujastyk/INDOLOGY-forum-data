I'm still not sure the indology list is the right forum for this discussion,
but anyway: the northern and southern courses of the sun (the ayanas) are
not really related to the rAs'is; they are related to the summer and winter
solstices, which no longer coincide with the sidereal saMkrAntis. Any
paNDita worth his salt surely knows this. Like the equinoctial points, the
solstice points are slowly regressing through the zodiac; in a few hundred
years, they will coincide with dhanuH- and mithuna-saMkrAntis, respectively.
