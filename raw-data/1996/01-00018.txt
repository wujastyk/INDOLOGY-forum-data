At first have a look into the _New Catalogus Catalogorum_.Vol. 1, s.v.  
Allopanisad.

Rajendralal Mitra published as early as 1871 an article in the  
_Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (Letters)_. 40 (1871, pp.  
170-176: "The Alla-Upanishad: a spurious chapter of the Atharvaveda- 
text," and a shorter follow-up in the _Proceedings of the Asiatic  
Society of Bengal_. 1871, pp. 140-142. Rajendralal Babu gives the  
Sanskrit text accompanied by an English translation. He pointed to an  
older edition to be found in Radhakanta Deva's _Sabdakalpadruma_ I  
could not verify in the Nagari reprint and I do not have the old  
edition in Bengali characters at hand which was used by him.

A newer edition was brought out in the Adyar Library Series, Volume  
14: _Unpublished Upanishads_. Ed. by C. Kunhan Raja et al. Adyar 1933,  
pp. 392-393. An interesting comment is given by F.Otto Schrader in _A  
Descriptive Catalogue of the Sanskrit Mss. in the Adyar Library_. Vol.  
1. Madras 1908 (Adyar Library Ser. No. 2), pp. 136 seq.

This Upanisad is not "probably", but *certainly* "composed after Islam  
had formally entered India." It invokes the gods "mitravarunau" and   
contains at the same time formulae like "allahu akbar" and the shahada  
in a roughly Sanskritized version. Rajendral saw in the "akbar" quoted  
in the text a hint to emperor Akbar -- this might be the case or not.  
Moreover, the Alla Upanisad is not part of the famous list of 108  
Upanisads to be found in the (fairly late) Muktika Upanisad.

BTW the abovementioned Schrader asked brahmins what they think of the  
text. They identified the Alla(h) alluded to with the goddess Ila/Ida.

I hope this helps you
