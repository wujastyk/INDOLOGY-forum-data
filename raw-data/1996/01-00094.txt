Subject: Sanskrit for southeast
Message-ID: <161227022422.23782.17961630254538694649.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

"aagneya" ("associated with agni") in Sanskrit is "southeast".

Does someone know if by some optional internal sandhi it can
also be "aaj~neya"?

There is an instance where the meaning of "southeast" would
seem to make sense for "aaj~neya" but I can not find it in
my dictionaries.
