Dear Mr. Pulliainen,
there is, as you already might know, an elaborate cult of earpiecing 
and wearing thick ear-rings made out of wood or rhino horns among the kanphata 
asectics of Northern India. The classical study for it is Briggs, 
Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint). More recent 
literature you'll find listed in Guenter Unbescheid, Kanphata- Untersuchungen zu 
Kult, Mythologie und Geschichte sivaitischer Tantriker in Nepal, 
Wiesbaden  1980. 
With best wishes for your work, A.M.
