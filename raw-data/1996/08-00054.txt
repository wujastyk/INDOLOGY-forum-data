Subject: Source for Indian cabinets etc.
Message-ID: <161227025586.23782.3361085205844580468.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Does anyone know a source for the members of Indian state and national
governments (cabinets), when they come into power, who their members are,
cabinet reshuffles, etc.?  A couple of patrons independently have asked
for this in general and specifically for U.P. from 1975 on and I have been
unable to find anything from the computer.  I would be very grateful for
any help.
