Generally, may I suggest Motilal in Delhi? He is a bit slow, but has a great
variety of Indological books and texts, and is not too expensive. As for
Pollock's book, you could probably find it in several places, but I am quite
certain that Princeton University Store has it. Here are the relevant addresses:

Motilal Banarsidass
Bungalow Road, Jawahar Nagar,
New Delhi 110 007
India

Ask for a catalogue!

Princeton University Store
Special Order Book Dept.
36 University Place
Princeton, New Jersey 08540
USA
Phone: 609-921-8500 x 221
Fax: 609-924-9651

When I was there a couple of years ago, they had a lot of literature that is
of interest to Indologists (mostly modern stuff, such as political science,
history of religions etc.), but no Sanskrit texts. 

Try to avoid Otto Harrassowitz in Wiesbaden. Unless he has mended his ways,
he is extremely expensive. Motilal is mostly a better alternative.

Best regards,
