Interesting. If I remember correctly (I read it about 30 years ago) Huston
Smith in "Religions of Man" gives something very similar as a _Taoist_
parable. A folkloric universal? Something that got into China from India
back in the good old days when everyone in the world learned the art of
storytelling from India?
