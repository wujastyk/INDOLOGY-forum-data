Professor Kenneth W. Jones
***************************************************************************
From: Frank Conlon <conlon at u.washington.edu>


It is my sad duty to report that Professor Kenneth W. Jones, a member of
the Kansas State University history faculty for many years, and renowned
specialist on the history of the Arya Samaj and of religious movements of
the Punjab and India generally, died yesterday afternoon  in Manhattan,
Kansas.

I have received no further details at this time, and propose to post
further information and an obituary in the near future.  No immediate
plans have been announced, but a memorial service is likely to be held in
Manhattan next month.  Ken, who had survived a brain tumor a few years
ago, had been suffering from cancer and the complications of its
treatment.

We have lost a dedicated scholar and teacher and good friend.
