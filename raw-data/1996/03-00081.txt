I recommend _The Sanskrit Language_ by Thomas Burrow (London: Faber,
1973).  Also see _Indo-Aryan from the vedas to modern times_ by Jules
Bloch (Eng. tr. by A. Master, Paris: Librarie d'Amerique et d'Orient,
1965).

On Tamil, see, for example,  _Tamil Literature_ by Kamil V. Zvelebil
(Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1974) ["The earliest corpus of Tamil literary
texts may be dated roughly between 100 BC and 250 AD -- p. 9."], and the
fascinating book _The relation between Tamil and Classical Sanskrit
literature_ by George L. Hart (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1976).  There is
a great deal else, of course.
