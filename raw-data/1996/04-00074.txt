Subject: Initial capital
Message-ID: <161227023733.23782.4085009420692104511.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members,

This is a triffle, and probably one that has been discussed a lot before.
Nevertheless ...

It's irritating that initial capitals in mames look ambiguous when used
together with the Kyoto-Harvard convention. Like for instance: GaGgA,
JJAnezvara, etc. But it is also problematic to skip them in for instance
kRSNa, when this is a name and not only a color. Could we agree upon a
common marker put before initial capital, for instance ":" ? The above
examples would then be: :GaGgA, :JJAnezvara, and :KRSNa. The choice has to
bee a sign which is not taken as a part of the word by various search
programs, and which can not be mistaken for other signs that one may want to
use before a word, for instance quotation marks. Other suggestions? Or is
ASCII-Sanskrit already too weird for further complications?

Regards
