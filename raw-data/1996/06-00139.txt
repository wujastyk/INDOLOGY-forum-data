Dr. S. Kalyanaraman wonders:

"How fascinating! Kittel's Kannada lexicon gives this lexical entry:
maatarizva = wind.

Is it a far cry from agni to wind?"

Not really.  Macdonell [Vedic Mythology, pp.71f.] explains it all rather
nicely.  He knows the Rgveda very well.  One might also consult the Rgveda.
[Didn't I mention that I was referring to the RV?...]

Sincerely,

George Thompson
