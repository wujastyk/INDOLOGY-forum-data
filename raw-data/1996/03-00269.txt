Dear List Members,

Thx to those of you who notified me of the problem with the Indologist page.
Apparently, our server was the victim of a net hoodlum who deleted our
public directory.

It seems to be back up. Let me know if you have any problems or suggestions.

BTW, the page has a new URL:

        http://denton.computek.net/pub/wagers/ousia/Indologist.Shtml

The only difference is the file extension begins with an "S". (This allows
me to use server side includes.)

Please note the new URL.

Regards,



Will wagers at computek.net
