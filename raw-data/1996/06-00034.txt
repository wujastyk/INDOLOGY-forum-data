I am looking at a Sanskrit text which mentions two technical expressions
for time (kaala) whose meanings are unclear: mahendra and vaaru.na. I
have a hunch that they may be muhuurta-s, but cannot varify it. I should
appreciate any help on this, with citations and/or references.

Thanks a bunch,
Ken Zysk
