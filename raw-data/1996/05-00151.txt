The idea that transmigration could have been an ancient Indo European 
esoteric tradition that later surfaced in different corners of the IE 
world, but became more important in India, is interesting.  However, what 
solid evidence do we have that, even in India, it was important at an 
early stage, before the punar-mRtyu of the BRrhadAraNnyaka UpaniSad?
