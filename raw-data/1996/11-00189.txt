The quality of communication in Hindi with a native speaker of KannaDa who
only knows little or no Hindi is poor indeed.

Besides, are we talking about the languages helpful to a tourist, or to a
student of Indology?

I guess the above argument amounts to:

 (1)  Hindi has, as I gather from this discussion, more funding than, say,
         Sanskrit, without clear indological reasons;
 (2)  One should nevertheless give it the first place in Indology because
         it receives this funding, rather than try to disseminate 
         information about other branches of Indology. 

The idea is not to take funding away from Hindi, but to attract more
resources to Indology. This would benefit everybody, including Hindi
studies.
