Try to avail yourself of these instruction:

To subscribe to INDOLOGY, send the email message:

"subscribe indology Your Name"

(where "Your Name" is, obviously, your real name) to the address:

"listserv at liverpool.ac.uk".

That will do the trick.

Later, messages to (and from) the are sent to:
"indology at liverpool.ac.uk"
To get a list of members, send the message:
"review indology"
to the listserv address. To resign, send the message:
"unsub indology"
to listserv.

If you unsubscribe, you may get rid of Indology net.

Best regards,
