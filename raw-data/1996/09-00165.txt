>Dr. Magier, and others interested:
I am afraid that the final publication of my collection will take some 
times, still. I have worked on this as a kind of hobby and my main work 
lies in other questions (mainly on Graeco-Indian relations). You must 
wait some years for it, unfortunately. In the meantime, I am ready to 
forward some information from it, like in the case of Preciado-Solis' 
question, supposing that such requests do not become very frequent and 
that they are only concerned with one or a few scholars. When the 
collection is finished (I have just reached Macdonell in computerizing 
my hand-written files), it will contain perhaps 900 pages. You see, not 
only Indologists, but a lot of archaeologists, art historians, colonial 
officers and missionaries working on Indian linguistics etc. have been 
included.
