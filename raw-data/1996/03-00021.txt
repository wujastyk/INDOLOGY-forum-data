This is a central question, and hard to solve.  I and the others who are
discussing this matter with me certainly want you and others in your category to
continue to stay with the list.  In the end, any system has to balance openness
with the risk of misuse, and there is no perfect solution.  There is another
category we can imagine too, of people who are qualified in Indology, but keep
posting advertisements, or something else unsuitable.  

I think that when people join the new INDOLOGY, there will be a questionnaire
and this document will make the aims and rules of acceptable conduct very clear.
 There will also be a system of graded warnings: "Dear Sir or Madam, if your
<xxx> posting does not meet the criteria of conduct or acceptability described
for the INDOLOGY list.  This is a first warning.  After two more such warnings
your name will be removed from the list of subscribers."

Another idea under discussion is that every message passes before an editor
before appearing on the list.  This is very labour intensive, but may be the
only solution.  If a message is judged by the editor to be unsuitable, it never
gets to the list, or gets edited first.  If the poster feels aggrieved, s/he
takes it up with the editor; it never gets to the public list.

Rest assured, the category of member which you describe is not under threat.
