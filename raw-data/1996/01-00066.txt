*This is a question about the relationship between grammar, literature and 
language.*
I have been working for some time now on a project to catalogue over a 
thousand manuscripts in Hindi and Panjabi. They date from ca. CE 1500 
onwards (Hindi mss) and c. CE 1700 onwards (Panjabi mss). 
Now in the case of 20th century works it is fairly clear that Hindi and 
Panjabi can be distinguished by their grammers. But it seems to me in 
pre20th century works this distinction is much less clear. 
In particular because many works are in varieties of Brajabhasa, and other 
dialects, and can be found in both histories of Hindi and Panjabi 
literature. Likewise, there are many instances of works that some describe 
as Rajasthani, or Old Rajasthani, and some describe as Old Gujarati (and 
some describe as Maru-gujari).

So I would be grateful for any pointers towards contemporary academic 
discussion of this issue, what distinguishes such SA languages. Or any 
comments from list members on how they decide to refer to a pre-modern text 
as being in Hindi/Panjabi/Rajasthani etc.
