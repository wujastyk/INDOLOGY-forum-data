I've only read parts of this book, but it seems to be fairly comprehensive
(I don't really know enough about comparative IE linguistics to judge the
veracity, hetero-, or orthodoxy of what he says ). My only problem is the
somewhat prosaic writing-style (combine this with the presentation of
_lots_ of comparative IE data and the text becomes slightly confusing at
times).
