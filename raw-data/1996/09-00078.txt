I would agree with Lars Martin Fosse concerning the language of Indology: 
If we want to be understood by all, we must use English (or Sanskrit and 
perhaps Hindi). But we cannot dismiss the fact, that French and German 
are important languages for the Indology and that anyone who is not able 
to understand them will not have access to certain important books.
So is just for example the still completest dictionary from Sanskrit to an 
European language the Petersburger Woerterbuch (I do not think that any 
of us will live to see the Poona-Dictionary reaching the end of the 
vowels...) and it is Sanskrit-German.

With kind regards

Andreas Bigger, Zuerich
