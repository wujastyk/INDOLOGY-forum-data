SAyaNa does take sindhuH as referring to Parjanya: sindhuH syandanaxIlaH
parjanyaH.  However, sindhur apAm can also appropriately be taken as
involving a genitive of the type xUrANAM xUratamaH (the Sindhu among the
waters), which is the construction Geldner seems to assume.  On the other
hand, Renou (Etudes vediques et panineennes vol. 7, p. 69) seems to assume
that apAm is construed with an understood term (napAt ?).  As for tad, this
is the corelative to yad of the preceding verse.  Regards, George Cardona
