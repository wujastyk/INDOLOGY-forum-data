> WARNING!!!!!!!  INTERNET VIRUS
>
>The FCC  released a warning last Wednesday concerning a
> matter of  major  importance  to  any  regular  user  of the
> Internet.     Apparently  a   new  computer  virus  has been
> engineered by  a user of AMERICA ON LINE that is unparalleled
> in its destructive capability.  Other more well-known viruses
> such as  "Stoned",  "Airwolf"  and  "Michaelangelo"  pale in
> comparison to  the prospects  of this  newest creation  by a
> warped mentality.   What makes this virus so terrifying, said
> the FCC,  is the  fact that  no program needs to be exchanged
> for a  new computer to be infected.  It can be spread through
> the existing e-mail systems of the Internet.  Once a Computer
> is infected,  one of  several things  can  happen.    If  the
> computer contains  a hard  drive, that  will most  likely be
> destroyed.   If the  program is  not stopped,  the computer's
> processor will be placed in an nth-complexity infinite binary
> loop -which can severely damage the processor if left running
> that way too long.

>       Unfortunately, most  novice  computer  users  will not
> realize what is happening until it is far too late. Luckily,

> there is one sure means of detecting what is now known as the
> "Good Times"  virus.   It always travels to new computers the
> same way  in a  text email  message  with  the  subject line
> reading "Good  Times".   Avoiding infection  is easy once the
> file has been received- not reading it!    The act of loading
> the file into the mail server's ASCII buffer causes the "Good
> Times" mainline program to initialize and execute.
>     The program is highly intelligent- it will send copies of
> itself to  everyone whose  e-mail address  is contained in a
> receive-mail file or a sent-mail file, if it can find one. It
> will then proceed to trash the computer it is running on. The
> bottom line  here is - if you receive a file with the subject
> line "Good  Times", delete  it immediately!   Do not read it"
> Rest assured  that whoever's  name was on the "From" line was
> surely struck  by the  virus.   Warn your  friends and local
> system users  of this newest threat to the Internet! It could
> save them a lot of time and money.
