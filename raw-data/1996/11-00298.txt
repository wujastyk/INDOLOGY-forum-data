Yes, as Daniel: --  but while being the lion's pit.


You probably refer to Harry Falk, in Zeitschrift der deutschen 
morgenlaendischen Gesellschaft, a few years ago (c. 1988?). Have to check 
in my office.

Falk has, I think, most of the older literature: still useful, besides
Hermann Oldenberg (Die Weltanschuung der Upanischaden...), is Stanislaw
Schayer, c. 1925: "Upanisad", probably in Zeitschrift fuer Buddhismus Vol. 
5. - where he derives it from upa-ni-sad, but in the meaning of "to lay
siege to (the knowledge of the teacher"; cf. also: Schayer, Die
Weltanschauung der Brahmana-Texte, Rocznik Orientalist. 3. 

Hope this helps. MW
