My term as a research fellow is soon up, I leave the University of Oslo, at
the beginning of June (but I will do my utmost to come back!) So even if I
personally would love to offer your journal(s) political asylum, you would
probably have to rely on another Scandinavian colleague. Nevertheless, I
wish good luck. Your homepage is beautiful!

Best regards,
