Dear Members,
 
Can anyone suggest references (in English) on water in
Indian culture?  I am particularly interested in
environmental concepts such as finding sources of water
(water dosing), conceptions of subsurface water
(Patalaloka; Nagas and water; the idea that all rivers
and underground water are linked to the Ganges)
concepts of water and purity, means of purifying water,
both ritually and in terms of sanitation, and myths
related to all of the above.  
 
It is that time of year which the university
administration (where DO we get these people??) calls
"vacation" and so closes the university library!
