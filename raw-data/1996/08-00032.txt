Members,
Since both writers presumably have email and the address of the original 
is in the header, it would seem easy enough to email a request to the 
original author to publish the quoted matter.  I think it is one thing to 
quote one another in LIST discussions (ie. public forum) and another to 
carry this to printed/published media where there is no possiblity for 
quick reply.  Besides, email tends to be ephemeral, print is forever.
