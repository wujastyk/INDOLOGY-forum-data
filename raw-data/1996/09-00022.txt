 Maybe, I used words which sound to sharp. Sorry, if I
offended anybody. The name INTRANS suggests to me International
Transcription and I think many net surfers while getting to a site
presenting this scheme of transcription of Sanskrit into Roman script will
get an impression the scheme is internationally accepted one. 
While I think it is all right to have international or universal aspirations
I would rather avoid the names suggesting international acceptance of a
project. The international convention I meant was the international scientific system 
 transcription of Sanskrit (with diacritical marks above or below letters
which I was trying to render with upper or lower strokes (respectively)
after a respective letter. "Respect" can be undestood in pragmatic terms.
The international scientific transcription is going to stay with us for some
time. This is why I think some similarity of a transcription scheme meant
for typing Sanskrit (and other Indian languages) to the scientific
transcription makes the whole set of procedures more coherent.
