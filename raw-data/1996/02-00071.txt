Dear Gardner ,
No matter how you cut it an apple is an apple and a thorn is a thorn .
in the past many racists have used a bad word to describe a non- white 
culture and when strong opposition was presented by facts they either
withdrew without honestly accepting their bad actions or tried to
justify by devious means by connecting to subjects , scientific but
which unfortunately do not connect with the word used in the context
of describing a society . For example would you describe your community as the sladering word R - c - s -t  by stating that in sports the word race is
a very good and acceptable term ? it is not honest scientific approach 
to keep on insisting to use a word that dewscribes a society wrongly
saying that that wordhas a different connotation in different areas .
	words which give a wrong connotation to the readers and which have
demeaning implications should not be used by scientists in describing
a society unless that demeaning nature of the society is firmly
established first . M.Rajagopalan.
