 I believe the one that should have most immediate appeal to Americans is
the verbal root YABH (present indicative YABHATI). It corresponds to a very
common English four-letter word, usually worked to death in American movies
depicting people of lesser breeding. Since I do not want to fall afoul of
the new puritanism in American networks, I refrain from translating it. Look
it up!
