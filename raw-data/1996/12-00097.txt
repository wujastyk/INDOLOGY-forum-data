This is an interesting way of putting it, given that it is usually assumed
that Srividya and the worship of Tripurasundari originated in Kashmir
Saivism, and was absorbed by others, specifically Advaita Vedantins. See,
for example, publications of Douglas Renfrew Brooks, Andre Padoux etc. 

One such online text is available on gopher at 
gopher://gopher.cc.columbia.edu:71/00/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia/
Groups/institutes/DHIRC/VedaSeminar/Padoux.txt, which has a summary of
Andre Padoux's April 1996 presentation at the Columbia University's Dharam
Hinduja Indic Research Center.
