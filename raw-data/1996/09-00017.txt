Just for completeness, I would like to know how one would type the
Urdu-based sounds of /fe/, /ze/, /qaaf/, /khe/, and /ghain/.  All five are
needed for Urdu words, and the first two of course for English-derived
words as well.  If this system is to work satisfactorily for Hindi, it can
hardly do without these sounds.  Since the f, z, and q keys have been
assigned to other purposes, can these letters be accessed in some other
way?  I do not see them on the chart.
