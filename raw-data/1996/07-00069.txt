Subject: Population Estimates in Ancient India
Message-ID: <161227025347.23782.1610691600181645222.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Subscribers,

I am presently doing some work on the economic and social history of
ancient India primarily utilising Pali sources.  As part of this work I
have been trying to get some idea of population estimates in North India at
various times during the first millenium BCE.  Without such estimates the
value of many of the statistics collected on the social backgrounds of
converst to Buddhism is substantially reduced.  I would be very
appreciative for any references pertaining to this subject.


Cheers,


Greg Bailey
