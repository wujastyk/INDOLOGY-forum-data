This is a repost of something I've sent to Indology several times
before. Unfortunately recent events indicate that it is again
relevant!
----------------------


There has been a spate of people trying to signoff Indology
and making a mess of it. The list software has trapped most
of these but one or two have gone to all subscribers. It
is therefore opportune to reiterate the procedures for
signing off Indology:
 
1) Requests to leave or join should be sent to:
     listproc at liverpool.ac.uk

2) Point 1 therefore implies that it is inappropriate to send
such requests to the Indology list. None of the people reading
the list can sign you off the list. (I am not a member of the
list so don't even see such requests unless Dominik passes
them on).
 
Some network users pay real money for each message they receive.
They quite rightly feel aggrieved to have to pay for messages
which shouldn't have been addressed to them.
 
3) Occassionally people's email addresses undergo subtle changes
and the address they attempt to signoff from is not identical
to the one they used to join Indology. If a signoff fails 
then *don't* panic. I see all failed signoffs and will (if at
all possible) compare your old and new address so I can remove
you "manually".
 
4) If you find a signoff fails and I don't remove you within a
   reasonable amount of time then contact me as:
     indology-request at liverpool.ac.uk
   and I will remove you.

I hope I can rely on your cooperation in this matter.
