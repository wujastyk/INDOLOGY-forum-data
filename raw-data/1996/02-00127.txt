one additional point- for users without snazzy grpahics, netscape, 
netshark, etc.-- they might try the same web address listed below, just 
put the word "lynx" and a space before it once they've logged on to their 
plain old ordinary humble e-mail server.

lynx is a nice way to browze text on the web without all the time of 
downloading buttons, bells, and often-superfluous graphics.  one's tab 
key will move from URL to URL, then a simple press of "return" activates 
the link.  it's fast, especially if text munching is all you need, and 
pricey grpahics-supporting software/hardware/home connections are not 
available to you.
