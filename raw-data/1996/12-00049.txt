I observed this also throughout Pakistan, as part of the Eid rituals.
It was explained to me that the purpose of painting is that it makes the
goat festive and attractive, which helps the family develop a sense of
attachment to this particular animal, so that the sacrifice becomes a
more poignant recreation of the sacrifice of Abraham.
