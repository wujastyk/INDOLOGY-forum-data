Furthermore, Dominik Wujast is quite correct that the 
understanding at which Janaka ultimately arrives is presented in

        Venekatesananda, S.* The Concise Yoga Vasistha*.  
           Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1984 (pp. 164ff); 

and also that in this presentation--in which the power of reflection is 
stressed--no vision occurs.

The "vision version" is said to be in the complete work, which 
has been published in three English editions:

  1) Venekatesananda, S.  *Yogavasistharamayana. - The Supreme Yoga: 
            A New Translation*  Foreword by H.H. Swami Ranganathananda.
            1st ed.  2 vols.  Cape Town, S.A.: Chiltern Yoga Trust, 1976.  
            (2 leaves of col. plates : ill. ; 21 cm.  3000 copies.) 
            
  2)  ---------.  *Yogavasistharamayana*.  Western Australia: Chiltern 
            Yoga Trust, 1981.

  3) ----------.  *Vasistha's Yoga*.   Albany, NY: State University of New 
            York Press, 1984.

Edition #3 may be purchased from Amazon.com ($49.95).  Amazon also
has  

        O'Flaherty, Wendy D.  *Dreams, Illusions, and Other Realities*.  
            Chicago: University of Chicago. 1984
 
a book Roy Perrett suggests may deal with the vision, as well.  Amazon 
sells this for $24.95.

For those in the San Diego area, Venekatesananda # 1) is available at the 
SDSU library (stacks);  #2) at the UCSD library (SRLF); and O'Flaherty 
may be found in the stacks at both locations.

Best wishes and many thanks to all,
