(Apologies for any cross-posting.)

Fellow Indologists and Hindi teachers,
For primarily pedagogical reasons, I would like to be able to send and 
receive email 
messages in Devanagari. The systems I use are UNIX, OS/2, DOS and Windows 
3.1. 
As far as I am aware, no such program exists for those or for any other 
systems. I don't have the computer chops myself to build such a program. 
Does anybody know if any such program already exists or is in the works 
somewhere? (Ideally, I would like to be able to mix English, etc. 
languages and the Devanagari script in the same message.) 

Hopefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
