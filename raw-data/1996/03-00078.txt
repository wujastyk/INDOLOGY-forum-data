V. Raghavan's _New Catalogus Catalogorum_, vol. 2, lists manuscript
copies in Madras (M. Descriptive Cat. 14758, M. Triennial 3477b, 3825
(extracts)), and Punjab University Library (II. App, p.54, by Marici).

The PUL copy, is part of the Woolner collection in Lahore, which has
been unavailable since partition.
