Subject: what is a jalabIna?
Message-ID: <161227025226.23782.3102929468637370259.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear listmembers
In a passage about observing the moon in a Hindi text I am working on there
is a mention of a dUrbIna (telescope) and another device called a *jalabIna*
(a 'waterscope'?)
I can find no reference to a jalabIna so far. Has anyone else ever seen this
word, or even better a *jalabIna* itself!
