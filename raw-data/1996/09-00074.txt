May I ask how the accents are floated to the appropriate positions over
the characters, when using applications like MS Word?  Is there some trick
I don't know?

Secondly, are you aware of the modified Bistream and Utopia fonts
available via the INDOLOGY web site?  These fonts contain extra accented
characters (accent+char = single glyph) for work with Indian languages. 

Best wishes,
Dominik
