It's true that the country couldn't afford to subsidize schools or
textbooks in all of India's languages. It would have to continue doing
that only with state languages (currently called official languages). 
Schools and provision of textbooks in the remaining languages could be
done perhaps by private agencies or NGOs interested in this issue. Some of
these languages are spoken by pretty wealthy and powerful communities who
could perhaps finance schools in their own languages. The important point
is granting people the *right* to open schools in their own languages. 
The implementation of that right is the next step. Correct me if I'm
wrong, but I think that at present schools can be run only in the official
languages plus English.
