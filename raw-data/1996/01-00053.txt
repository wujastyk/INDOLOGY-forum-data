Unfortunately it is true  that my name doesn't appear in normal letters but as
numeric code:  \\9$9J7F8@*?f:&8. The customer service of compuserve is working
on this since quite a while and I hope the name will soon show up in normal
letters.
If any of you have an idea what to do about this please let me know.
However, the messages are correct, i.e the complete email address for Prof.
Barlingay in Pune is indeed as follows:
