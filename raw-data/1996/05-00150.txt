Thank you for your answer.

To be precise, the question concerns

	vol. 38: we have fasc. 1-7 (January 1969-July 1970) (publ.
		1970-1981), the titlepage, the table of contents as well as
		the index are missing

	vol. 39: fasc. 1-7 (January 1971-January 1973) (publ. 1981-85), here
		also we have never got title, table of contents nor the index

By the way, the last fascicle of the "Arabic and Persian Supplement" seems
to be the volume "1975" (publ. 1983).

I can't figure out if this is due to the negligence of our bookseller or of
the publisher(s).
