Hello--and thank you,

I am grateful for the assistance I received from members of both the 
Indology and Sanskrit lists re: Janaka's vision of himself as a beggar  
and the Yoga Vaisistha.  

For those interested in this topic, Mantralaura has advised:

>Here are a few titles of books regarding
>Yoga VashiShTha that are currently in the
>Arsha Vidya collection:

>Essence of Yoga VashiShTha - (tr.) Samvid
>Laghu Yoga VasiShTha of Abhinanda - K.N. Aiyer (tr.)
