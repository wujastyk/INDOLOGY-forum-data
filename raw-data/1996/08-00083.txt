I don't know of a text that does this but the national languages are
actually only Hindi and English -- that is, Hindi is the primary one and
English is the associate national language. The other 17 mentioned in
previous discussions are official languages; that is, each of them is a
state language of at least one state, and schools in these languages are
officially sanctioned.
