Take a look at Barbara Holdrege's book, Veda and Torah (SUNY Press,
1996).

  As far as I understand, the various Tantric traditions, to name
one, abound with such concepts... the description  of the Goddess as 
                  
                mAtrkArNa svarUpiNI
                a-ka-ca-Ta-ta-pAdi varNe
                ekAkSarI etc. or using bIjAkSara are examples of
this.

A.Bharati's "The Tantric tradition", Douglas Brooks's books,
"Understanding Mantras" edited by Harvey Alper,
Andre Padoux's "Vac: the concept of the word in selected
Hindu Tantras", may be of help...
