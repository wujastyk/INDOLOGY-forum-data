Subject: South East Asian Scripts
Message-ID: <161227025804.23782.11265494115966154910.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have seen it suggested that the Indic alphabets used in South
East Asia (Khmer, etc.) are derived from the Grantha or southern Indian
script, not the Devanagari or northern Indian script.

If that is so, I'm wondering who used the Grantha script, e.g. were they
Indo-Aryan or Dravidian types?  Did they use it to write Sanskrit and 
Pali?

The SE Asian countries have borrowed a lot of Sanskrit as well as Pali 
vocabulary, so one must wonder in what script it came to them.
