Dear Frances:

        In terms of typing Urdu or Hindi using Vedatype, it is easy to
accomodate a number of additional sounds on the keyboard:  The shift z (Z),
shift x (X), shift k (K), shift g (G), shift p (P), shift f (F), and shift
v (V) keys are all unassigned for devanagari in Vedatype.  Do you have some
suggestions which of these keystrokes would best go with which sounds?
        We have a Hindi version of VedicFont, called VedicH, which has the
ja, kha, ka, pha, ga, .da, and .dha devanagari characters all with a dot
under them.  Sanskrit is taught in our university, but not Hindi, so there
has not been a demand for a Hindi typing program, and the development of
this Hindi version of Vedatype has languished.
        If even a dozen people were interested in such a typing program it
might be worth pursuing.
        However, the Vedatype system may not be readily adaptable to Hindi
because Vedatype requires typing an "a" or other vowel after each
consonant; otherwise the program will put the successive consonants
together into a conjunct; alternatively, if there is no following
consonant, and there is no vowel, it will insert a virama.  The Hindi habit
of dropping a's may prove no end of confusion for the typist.
        Vedatype is designed for a strictly phonetic, syllabic script,
without spelling aberrations. We're not sure any script/language other than
devanagari and Sanskrit fulfills these requirements.

        Sincerely,


        Peter Freund
