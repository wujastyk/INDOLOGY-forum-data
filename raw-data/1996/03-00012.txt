Due to serious system crashes at the VSNL in India, the email addresses
for some subscribers have had to change.  Also, if you have
correspondents on VSNL systems, be aware that recent email to them may
have been lost.

A few days ago I posted the address of Dr. Shivamurthy Swamiji, Chairman
of the Organizing Committee for the next World Sanskrit Conference. That
email address has now been changed to

        swamiji at giasbg01.vsnl.net.in

(i.e., giasbm01 -> giasbg01)
