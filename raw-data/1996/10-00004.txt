In some South Indian temples (especially in Kerala, 
but also in Tamil Nadu) males are required to remove 
their upper body clothing before entering the temple.  
An example is the famous Guruvayoor temple in Kerala.

Also, when meeting the "Aandavan", a highly-respected 
religious figure among the Tamil Srivaishnava
community, it was proper respectful etiquette for all 
of us males to remove our upper clothing and be 
bare-chested.

I have no idea if this custom is directly related to 
the practice mentioned in your Buddhist sutra, but 
based on my upbringing, I would have imagined that
it is a similar gesture of respect. 

Regards,


Raja.
