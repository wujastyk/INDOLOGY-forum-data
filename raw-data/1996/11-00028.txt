The Sanskrit verb _yabhati_ is the equivalent of the English word 'fuck'. 
It is an ancient Indo-European root; compare Russian _ebat'_, which is 
used in maledictory contexts with even more vigour than the English term 
is.

I used plain English in this message. Latin translation available on 
request.
