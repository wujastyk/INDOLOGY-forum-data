Subject: [Q]jyoti.h'saastra - what is "catarchic"?
Message-ID: <161227024675.23782.12216204596322154379.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

	I must express a revervation as to what Birgit Kellner says in the message
quoted below on using Greek or Greek-derived terminology in discussing
Indian jyotihsastra.  Certainly the Sanskrit terminology ought not to be
omitted, but the case of jyotihsastra is different from that of grammar,
philosophy, and other fields where the two civilizations developed their
Wissenschaften in isolation from one another.  Even if one discounts the
evidence that Indian astronomy/astrology is profoundly indebted to
Babylonian and Greek counterparts, many if not most of the concepts are
shared or similar.  For this reason to use terminology of Greek origin is
one might argue to reflect accurately the fact that it's a body of
knowledge that is in large part shared across several civilizations.  In
addition, in pursuing a sort of ethnic purity of terminology one risks
putting the research off into a exoticist, "Orientalist" corner in which
there is on the one hand _the_ history of astral science and on the other
the history of _Indian_ jyotihsastra.  In discussing the closely related
field of Indian mathematics, would scholars recommend, and do they in
fact, routinely eschew the use of international mathematical terminology
for the near-exclusive use of Sanskrit (or Prakrit) terms?
