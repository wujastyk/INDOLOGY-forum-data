Subject: how to reference list discussions
Message-ID: <161227025469.23782.5753978420168628276.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

	Communications on Indology or a similar network are scholarly, 
but casual, and not to be treated as anyone's "considered final opinions" 
on a given topic.  Therefore, there is a great danger of citations from 
e-mail messages leading to misrepresentation.  Minimally, I would suggest 
that the author of a message needs to be explicitly asked for his/her 
permission for a specific quote, and be given an opporunity to review 
that quote.
