Thanks for announcements of you seminars.  I am keenly interested in Arun 
Agrawal's topic i connection with my dissertation research.

Would you kindly pass on an email address for him so that I may find out 
if there is a published or other available version of his research.

Thanks,  Thelma Lowe
