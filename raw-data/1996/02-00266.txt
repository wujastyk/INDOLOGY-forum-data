Subject: Removing people from Indology
Message-ID: <161227022979.23782.5967120481996420756.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I gather this has been the source of some discussion recently.
I posted the following quite some time ago:
------------------------------------------------------------
As administrator of Indology I get copies of all rejected mail which
can't get delivered to you. At present I'm seeing a lot of mail rejected
by sites which implement 'quotas' on their systems. This means that the
site rejects all mail messages to users whose mailbox size exceeds some
locally defined limit.

If you are at one of these sites then can you please try to ensure that
you leave sufficient space for incoming mail. By talking to your local
Computer Centre staff you may even be able to have this limit increased.
The consequences of doing nothing are that *any* mail to you (not just
from Indology) will not be delivered. In addition you will help reduce
the cost of managing the Indology list.

This morning I have had to remove two Indology subscribers who have
been over quota for a considerable time. I don't like having to do
this, but it is the only effective way to constrain this problem.

Thank you for reading this message.

The above message is even truer now! Indology is now busier than ever
and has more subscribers than ever. In addition, I now get many failures for 
lots of other reasons. The number of failures I get is
enormous, typically around 50/day! I can only cope with running the
list if this number is kept manageable. Thus, I have with regret, to
often delete people whose accounts have rejected many messages across
several days. This is not something I want to do. It is borne largely
out of necessity.

It can be avoided in some instances by making sure that you do have
the capacity to handle Indology mailing.
