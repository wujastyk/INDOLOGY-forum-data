Dear Noel,

The  Mueller  quote  on  comparative religion  comes from   his  'Introduction 
to   the Science of Religion' (1873),  p.16.   Also see   Eric J.Sharpe's  
'Comparative Religion: A History' ( London: Open Court, 1986, 26-46),  in 
which he discusses Mueller and other scholars with a simliar stance on  
religion in the chapter of  the same title, 'He who knows...'.  As for  the  
'he who knows too much...' quote  - well, I haven't  come across it!  

Hope you're doing well!

Regards, 
Sujata
