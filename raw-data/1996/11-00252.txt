Btw, who are these "language activists in the south"?  The only
opposition to Hindi in the South is in Tamil Nadu, and that too only
from the DMK-type politicos who use that as a vote-generating issue.
And the bulk of the anti-Hindi agitation was before I was born.  I
submit to you that there is no significant opposition to Hindi
elsewhere, and that in fact Hindi/Urdu are better understood in other
places in the South like Karnataka, than English.
