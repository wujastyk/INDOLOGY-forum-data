There are three names of the moon that I am trying to understand.
I was hoping someone here could help.

1.  catura'sraasanaaruu.da.h
    catur a'sra aasana aaruu.da
    "The One mounted on a four-cornered seat."

    Does someone know the significance of the "four-cornered seat?"

2.  vivasvanma.n.dalaaj~neyavaasa.h
    vivasvat ma.n.dala aj~neya vaasa
    "The One who has an unknowable abode in the globe of the sun?"
     or perhaps "vivasvat ma.n.dala" mean "shining globe?"

3.  audu.mbaranagaavaasa.h
    audu.mbara, audu.mbara tree or wood, or copper
    na ga vaasa, tree dweller, peacock
    "The peacock {of the audu.mbara tree, of audu.mbara wood, of copper}?"

Thanks for any help you can provide in understanding these names.
