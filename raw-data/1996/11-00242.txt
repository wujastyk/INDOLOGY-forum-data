I haven't heard of any school by that name (unless you mean `shAkhA'),
but there certainly is a Rshi referred to in the Atharva Veda and
elsewhere, by the name pippalAda.  He is the master who is approached
by six disciples, who each ask him a question, the transcript of the
dialogue being in the appropriately-named shhaTprashnopanishat.
