Hello Girish,

You wrote on "Sanskrit characters for Wikner font":

How about Theodor Benfey's _Die Hymnen des Samaveda_.Leipzig 1848? I think
there must be newer editions which use the numerical accents, too.

I really don't know anything about the musical notation of the Samaveda, you
should consult works like Wayne Howard's _Samavedic Chant_.New Haven and
London 1977 or his _Veda Recitation in Vaaraa.nasii_.Delhi 1986 (not to
speak of the older works by Richard Simon who published the Pu.spasuutra and
wrote a paper on this theme).

Perhaps you should say better "halanta"-sign; this use of "viraama" is -- at
least -- un-Paa.ninian, although found in many primers.

It seems that the varieties of the different characters go back to different
writing traditions. E.g. the "a" looking like "'p' with hatch marks" is
already to be found in the Kashmirian "Saaradaa script. 

My impression is that the history of Devanagari typography and printing (in
India and the rest of the world) is still to be written. I have not found
any comprehensive (and reliable) monograph. Or am I wrong?
