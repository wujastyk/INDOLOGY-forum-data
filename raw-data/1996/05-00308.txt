I would like to raise the question of how appropriate it is to call these verbal
derivations "etymologies,"in our sense of the word.  According to Webster's,
etymon is the "literal meaning of a word according to its origins." To my
knowledge, there's no claim to historical authenticity in these word
derivations. Luis Gonzalez-Reimann wrote that << these etymological exercises
very often pretend to be given as  historical explanation, one that is linked to
the origins of a tradition.>> This is not doubt true, but there's no claim to
historical derivation in the philological sense, as far as I can tell. Or am I
missing something?

It seems to me they are rather creative ways of unfolding meanings inherent in a
term. I fully agree with Madhav Deshpande when he writes that << Such
linguistically fanciful etymologies are critical for our understanding of the
synchronic comprehension of those terms and concepts by the respective
communities>>

By calling them "etymologies" we are ensuring that they will be inadequate, and
therefore can qualify them as "fanciful." It would be perhaps more accurate to
find a better term for them. The best I can think of now is something along the
lines of "cultural word derivations." I would be very interested in hearing more
learned opinions than my own on this.
