THe project is very doable, as I'm sure multiple postings will inform 
you.  Still, isolating all the symbols for conversion to, as I did it, 
ITRANS standards, is time-consuming.  perhaps they could be posted to you 
here, or snail  mailed.  Otherwise, look in the back of your 
word-processor or dos manual and it should list all the codes.  I have 
made a very functional convert.sg file.  convert is the quickest and 
easiest of the programs to use.  If I remember correctly, it is the one 
requiring a space along the left margin in the syntax before each convert 
code.  If not, I have the convert files made out for the other program on 
the disk as well.  To adequately convert it, however, there are some 36 
actual codes used in order to support all the accents when they are added 
to the basic diacritic marking.

Good luck and have fun!

In the instructions there is a mention of a file called CONVERT.SG which accompanies the program SG.EXE. I do not see this file on the diskette. Is it embedded somewhere or was it not included in error. If it was not included would anyone know how I would obtain it?
