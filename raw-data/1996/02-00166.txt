Subject: maRai, its meaning; WHOSE VEDA? - Bhaashya
Message-ID: <161227022812.23782.10202476336328338306.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

One additionnal information on the word maRai
as it is used in tolkAppiyam (T) and its commentaries.


1. in the preface of T, attributed to pan_ampAraz_Ar,
 we meet with the expression
   "... nAn_ maRai muRRiya
    ataGkOTTu AcaRku ..."

 {the expression is translated by Kamil Zvelebil [JTS-1, 1972]
  as:
    "...of the Teacher of AtaGkOTu
    ripe in the wisdom of the Four Vedas"   )

  He probably relies on the commentary of iLampUraNar (XII cent.),
  which says: "nAn_ku vEtattin_aiyum muRRavuNarnta ataGkOTu
  en_kin_Ra Urin_ Acan_ukku" }
    
      
2. in the first book of T (el_uttatikAram)
 we meet with (references given according to Rajam edition):

 a.  "... icaiyoTu civaNiya
     narampin_ maRaiya ..." (1, 33)

 b.  "... antaNar maRaittu" (3, 20)

 {Zvelebil (loc.cit.) translates
   a. "in books on vocal and instrumental music"
   b. "in the secret scriptures of the antaNar"

  iLampUraNar's commentary says
    a. "kural mutaliya El_icaiyOTu poruntiya narampin_aiyuTaiya
        yAl_in_atu icainURkaNNum"
    b. "pArppAr vEtattuk kaNNatu"

  naccin_Arkkin_iyar's commentary (XIV cent.) says:
    a. "yAl_ nUl iTattan_a"
    b. "pArppAratu vEtattu uLatE"  }

>maRai = concealment (puRanA.50); secret (kuRaL, 590); the vEdas, as secret
>(tol.ezhut.102). It would appear that the secrecy is the key attribute of

>The links with veda and Tamil may also be found thru Malayalam.

>>An interesting related point is that the Tamil word used in this
