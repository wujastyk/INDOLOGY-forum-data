          Library of Congress Joins SHARES

The Library of Congress (DCLW) has joined SHARES.  As a full
participant in SHARES, LC need no longer be a lender of last
resort.  Ariel delivery will be used whenever possible and every
effort will be made to provide prompt turnaround time for
requests.

The Library of Congress is also now accepting ILL requests from
non-U.S. libraries for both loans and copies over the RLIN ILL
system.  Filled requests for international SHARES partners will
be included in the annual net lending calculation. Domestic
lending will not be included in the net lending calculation
because of LC's long-standing policy of free document supply for
U.S. institutions.
