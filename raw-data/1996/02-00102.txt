>>It reminds me of my undergraduates who are deeply
>>offended by the use of the word "myth" to refer
 
I was similarly offended at first by the use of the
word "cult" to describe systems of worship and ritual
such as s'rIvidyA... am not sure if I have gotten over
it... but I realize that its academic use is value-free...
or is it :-)
