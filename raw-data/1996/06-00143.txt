Subject: Encoding Vedic Bib, and TEI Standards

In the process of decoding the 1971 Lehmann/Ananthanarayana Rig Veda, I 
received from Dr. Lehmann's assistant the following confirmation of their 
code which is both simple in an inuitive sense, and easy on the fingers.  
It could/should also alleviate conversion confusions mentioned below.

Their code:


&       Aufrecht's grave accent
:       length
-       voicelessness (visarga)
=       palatalization
!       accent (udatta)
+       anusva:ra
8       syllabic 1
\       retroflection
)       aspiration
>       velarization
'       avagraha
9       syllabic r

The diacritics follow the Roman letter to which they are related.

I hope this is of assistance in the work.  In addition, as a general 
point, Text Encoding Initiative standards (ISO 8859) of SGML headers 
would be a great asset to all e-text encoders-- AND prospective users.  
The absence of such a standard in 1971 left us spending more time than 
shoudl have been necessary tracking down information about the RV in 
question.  Dominik kindly forwarded the following to me for learning more 
about TEI:

The web home page is <a href="http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei/">.
There are good tutorials etc.
