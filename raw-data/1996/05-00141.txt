Burton Stein (August 1, 1926 - April 26, 1996)
***********************************************************************
From: Frank F. Conlon <conlon at u.washington.edu>

As reported on H-ASIA on April 26, Burton Stein died in London
from the effects of cancer against which he had been struggling
for several months.  Burt, who was my graduate advisor at the
University of Minnesota, had been residing in London with his
wife, the writer Dorothy Stein since 1983.

When I first met Burt in 1960, he had been teaching for three
years at the University of Minnesota.  He talked very little in
those days about his own education, and it was only later that I
learned a bit of his background.  Born and raised in Chicago, he
served in World War II, returning on the G. I. Bill to commence
study at the old Navy Pier facility that was then the University
of Illinois' Chicago campus.  However Burt never completed a
baccalaureate degree.  He was admitted to the University of
Chicago directly in to a Master of Arts program, completing the
M.A. in 1954, studying with Robert Crane.  Burt then completed a
Ph.D thesis in 1957 on the economic functions of the famous
Tirupati temple in medieval South India.  I know that he had
initially entertained a more conventional study of the economic
functions of the East India Company in early modern Madras, but
research on Ceylon had brought into his sights the complexities
and institutions of pre-modern agrarian economies.

Burt taught at the University of Minnesota from 1957 to 1965 and
at the University of Hawaii from 1966 to 1983.  He held visiting
professorships at the University of California, Berkeley,
University of Washington, University of Chicago, University of
Pennsylvania, Centre for Historical Studies of Jawaharlal Nehru
University.  Upon shifting to London, where he lived within a ten
minute walk of the India Office Library, he became a Professorial
Research Associate of the University of London School of Oriental
and African Studies and a regular participant in a wide range of
seminars and other South Asian scholarly activities.  He did not
stop teaching--a glance at prefaces and acknowledgments of many
books by many authors will find recognition of Burt's incisive
comment.  His seminar at Minneapolis was occasion for asking
fresh questions and proposing new conceptual frames.  I had never
had a professor like Burt.  He treated students as colleagues
with a dry, sometimes cynical wit.  He did not supply answers.
If one were lucky, he might supply a question.  Two decades
before I had ever heard the term "ethnohistory", and when
"subaltern" made one think of Kipling rather than Gramsci, Burt
was pushing us to look at India in its own terms.  And I think we
took it for granted that that was just what happened in seminars.

Burt Stein's scholarly contributions were primarily concerned
with pre-modern and colonial South India.  I recall him in the
early '60's poring over microfilms of inscription collections as
he was evolving his hypothesis concerning the nature of the
"state" in South India.  Burt doubted the reality of the Chola
"empire" as a bureaucratic structure, and proposed a radically
different conception, borrowed from Aidan Southall's studies of
African society, the "segmentary state" which he applied in his
first book, _Peasant, State and Society in Medieval South India_
in 1980.  With retirement, Burt's pace of writing increased
steadily, four more books came forth, and, just prior to his
death, he completed an innovative interpretation of the history
of the entire subcontinent, to be published by Blackwells.  Burt
his colleague at Minnesota Jan Broek first conceived of a
historical atlas of South Asia, and gained the support of Mr.
Charles Leslie Ames in creating a fellowship in South Asian
historical cartography.  The atlas project, under the guidance of
Joseph Schwartzberg commenced in the mid-1960s.  Burt remained
active as an advisor to the project, which finally appeared as _A
Historical Atlas of South Asia_ (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 1978) -- a milestone in the study of the subcontinent.

Burt's students and friends around the world mourn the passing so
soon of a man who had taught us so much.  Yet it would be
characteristic of Burt to say, should he reply as he did to me on
more than one occasion, "no, you all taught yourselves."  Burt is
survived by his wife Dorothy Stein and three children from a
former marriage, Sarah, J and G.

What follows is a preliminary bibliography of the significant
works of Burt Stein.  On several items I have been unable to
provide pagination, and I am also not certain that I have
identified all publications produced in the past few years.
However, what appears here may stand as a monument to Burt's
intellectual depth and breadth which will bear witness to the
extraordinarily fruitful and broad-ranging contributions which he
made to our comprehension of the Indian past.
