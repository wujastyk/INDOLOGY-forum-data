Subject: Seeking reviewers and books for review
Message-ID: <161227023987.23782.6502444111594231398.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Recently I joined the _Critical Review of Books in Religion's _
staff as an assistant editor responsible for Buddhism and
Comparative Religion. Anyone interested in reviewing books for
the journal, and anyone desiring to suggest books in either of
the above areas for review, should contact me at Cohen at rhodes.edu

If you wish to review books for the CRBR, please supply an
abbreviated c.v. detailing your degrees, most recent
publications, and -- most importantly -- your areas of competence
within the sub-fields of Buddhist studies and/or Comparative
Religions.

If you wish to suggest a book (or books) for either a short
review or a review article within CRBR, please supply full
bibliographic detail(s) and a brief abstract describing the
work's audience, content, and import.

Thanks in advance.
