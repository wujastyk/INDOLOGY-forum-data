> 
> 
> Recent years have witnessed a considerable growth in academic articles in
> the field of Hindu Studies. At present these contributions to knowledge
> remain fragmented and appear in a wide range of academic journals. The
> International Institute of India Studies (Canada) has therefore launched a
> new journal, <International Journal of Hindu Studies>, with the aim to
> provide an interdisciplinary and international focal point for such work. 
> 
> <International Journal of Hindu Studies> is primarily a forum for the
> presentation of research studies on Hindu societies and cultures and for
> the discussion of different approaches to their study. 
> 
> 
> COVERAGE 
> 
> Research essays from such diverse fields as anthropology, art, cultural
> studies, economics, geography, history, literature, law, musicology,
> philosophy, politics, psychology, religion, sciences, sociology, and so
> forth are welcomed. 
> 
> <Hindu Studies> welcomes submissions of an interdisciplinary nature.
> <Hindu Studies> especially encourages essays that consider Hinduism
> theoretically in a comparative and analytic terms, direct itself to what
> Hinduism did, what its comparative peculiarities were, what were the
> historical and ecologial causes of those peculiarities, how did they
> effect processes of historical change and stability, what were its effects
> on actors, etc--all as illuminated by comparison with other "religions"
> and situations--rather than limiting itself to South Asian historical and
> philological studies, for that would make it more interesting to
> non-Indologists and more relevant to contemporary thought. This editorial
> policy, along with the Interreligious Dialogues section of <Hindu
> Studies>, will, we hope, promote religious and secular tolerance in South
> Asia and around the globe.
