According to Stutley's Dictionary of Hinduism, Holaka is commonly called
Holi.  This book, refering to Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary,
suggests that the word Holaka is perhaps derived from a cry, shout or sound
in singing. 
 Auboyer's "Daily Life in Ancient India,"p. 144 is also suggested as a
further reference on the subject. 
Basham in "The Wonder that was India" states that the festival was originally
held in honor of Kama, the Love god.
Hope this is helpful.  Amita Sarin
