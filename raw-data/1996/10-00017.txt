Subject: Baring the right shoulder

Regarding Peter Claus' question about the Buddhist practice of baring the
right shoulder:

This practice seems to date back to the Indus Valley civilization.  The
famous bust (National Museum Karachi) of the "priest" wears a shawl or
robe-type garment, sculpted with trefoil motifs.  It covers his back and left
shoulder, sloping across the chest to under the right arm, but leaving the
right shoulder bare.

In circumambulating a stupa or shrine, isn't it the right shoulder that is
pointed towards the sacred object?
