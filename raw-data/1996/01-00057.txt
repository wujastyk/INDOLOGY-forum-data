A quick scan of OCLC WorldCat shows that the following libraries hold
the Zeitschrift (though not *necessarily* that particular volume). It
is very likely that *many* other libraries also hold it, but have
simply not converted their catalog records (from the 1920's) to their
online catalogs yet ;-)
