I believe that a program that is based on the  Unicode standard will be the
way to go to have most, if not all the features. BUT I doubt if such a
program will be available for US$10, considering the payments a developer
has to pay to Unicode Consortium for membership and/or to acquire the
necessary development tools. Perhaps it is possible for around US$99, for
the PC, and a higher fee for Unix. I cannot comment on the Macintosh.

We hope to have a program released in January that plans to support input
(typing) methods based on the Tuebingen-Zuerich format, ITRANS format as
well an the INSCRIPT (Govt. of India std. script keyboard layout) format.
