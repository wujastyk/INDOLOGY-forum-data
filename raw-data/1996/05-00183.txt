Subject: Correction: hypergamy-hypothesis
Message-ID: <161227024487.23782.13017324726604858462.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks for valuable answers by Deavadas and Peter Claus. Obviously, the
subject is far from being exhausted, however, and more information /
reflection is welcome. I believe that the basic theme here, the relation
between women and land, is central. Land is often gendered as female, and
what is fascinating about Quigley's suggestions is that they indicate
relations between the two that are more than merely literary.

In fact, Declan Quigley responded to my first mail. Although he is not a
member of this list, it seems, another member was kind enough as to forward
the post to him. As his subsequent answer to me showed that my summary of
the pages referred to was not quite accurate his remarks ought to be forwarded:
