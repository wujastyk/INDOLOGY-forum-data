	The following recommendations, circulated elsewhere, may be of
interest to scholars on the list: 
 
	Post when you have a question; can answer a question posed on the
list; or can clarify, expand, challenge, or forward the argument.
	Quote only directly relevant portions of previous posts in your
contribution.
	Send scholarly posts, not polemical or pious ones. 
	Engage in scholarly debate, not personal attacks.
	Use the subject line to indicate the subject of your post. Change
subject lines when you are changing the direction of the conversation. 
	Put your name and e-mail address at the end of your message.
