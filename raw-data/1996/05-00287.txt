Perhaps it is not fair to say 'in a way which renders it impossible to
actually guess the meaning' without giving the passage(s) in which Pingree
actually uses the word 'catarchic'.  He says:

'Eventually a separate science developed that used this notion of
auspicious and inauspicious time-units, in connection with omens and
astrological yogas, to establish the correct time for initiating various
kinds of actions; this is the science of muhurta, corresponding to
Hellenistic catarchic astrology.'

lines 10--13.
