Dear Peter,
	A good question!  After a certain soul-searching about what I 
must have meant by the word "relatively late Sanskrit", I believe I used 
it to mean "post-Vedic".  Lately I have been spending more time reading 
Vedic, and everything that came after Vedic seems rather late.  
	Apart from the humor, you have probably dug up the earliest 
occurrences of this word.  Congratualations!
	Madhav Deshpande
