Dear List-Members,

I would very much like to see a videofilm that has - as far as I know - come
out under two different titles:
1. Salvation. A film on the widows of Vrindavan.
2. Moksha.
According to the limited information I have, the video was published in 1992 in
Great Britain, by 'Vital Films'. Production for Channel Four television.
Director: Pankaj Butana.
Does anyone know where I could get the video?
Kind regards,
Mirjam
