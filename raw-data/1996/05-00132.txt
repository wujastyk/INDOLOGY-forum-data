Hello l.m.fosse,

In your

You wrote on "Gymnosophists etc.":

Nietzsche knew C.F. Andreas' later wife Lou Salome *before* she married
Andreas. There was no direct, personal aquaintance with the Iranist.

Some other personal connections may be mentioned here: Paul Deussen and
Nietzsche were at the same time pupils in Schulpforta. They knew each other
well and exchanged letters. Nietzsche claimed that he converted Deussen to
Schopenhauer. In his student days in Leipzig (till 1869) Ernst Windisch was
one of Nietzsche's fellow students. Of course: in the field of Classical
Philology. Windisch introduced Nietzsche to Hermann Brockhaus in whose home
he met Richard Wagner for the first time (about 1868). By the way: the young
Jacob Wackernagel learnt Greek with Nietzsche (Nietzsche's teaching
assignment at the university of Basle comprised the teaching of Greek to the
higher classes at the Paedagogium in Basle).

But in most cases Nietzsche's knowledge at least of the Indian tests he
alludes to was not well sounded. I am remembering an article of Annemarie
Etter where she proved that Nietzsche's Manu citations were taken from the
rather fanciful French "translation" of Louis Jacolliot (who created a
Krishna-"Khristna" (sic!) relationship).
