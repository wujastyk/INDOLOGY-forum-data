Dear Indology Members:
        I study Sanskrit and have a life-long interest in classical India
and the Vedic texts.  I enjoy and learn from the discussions that generate
in this conference.  I would benefit even more if I could crack the code
you use to write the Sanskrit in roman script without the diacritics, but I
am a beginner in the language.  Can somebody help me out with this?

Appreciatively,

Francisco Rocco
