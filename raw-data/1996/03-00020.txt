Dear Anantanarayanan ,
I said that in a news paper reort in India it was said that some
assamese still speak in sanskrit. I also mentioned as an internal evidence
to think about that many inscriptions in the temples of north india
are i sanskrit and not the local languages. Many inscriptions in
the recently built temples in tamilnadu ( where tamil is spoken ) is in 
tamil and it is not neccessary to work hard to prove that
tamil is spoken by masses to-day in tamilnadu .These are evidences to
think about in the decision making of whether sanskrit was 
spoken in the past history of india by masses . Persons like kalidasa
are said to have written the great sanskrit epics before they joined
any royal court and at that situation Kalidasa was just an ordinary 
person among the masses .Please read hinduism from hindu sorces and learn
and do not be ashamed of knowing the truth .
