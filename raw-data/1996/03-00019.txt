Dear Michael Rabe ,
	The statement I made was that the sculptures which are shown
repeatedly in many photographs of Khajuraho is not the correct 
interpretation of what the Hindu temple stands for . The yemple stands for 
the noblest of all human principles as it is incribed in the walls of khajuraho itself .
	In fact the hindu religious texts like the vedas , puranas 
stress brahmacharya which is control of such sexual bestility .
	The pictures of carvings have been used for a long time to give
a wrong interpretation of the hindu temple.
	As for the quotation given  on the walls of that Hindu temple it is 
for anyone to go there and see. A picture of it can be taken if one
wants.  I did not say that such sculptures are non-existent on that temple.
