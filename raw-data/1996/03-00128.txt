It's nice that this tedious, dendentious, voluminous thread has lightened up
somewhat. While quarter 'c  of 

"AkAshAt patitam tOyam   yathA gachchati sAgaram
    sarva loka pAdarakshA:  pratigachchanti mAm tathA"

may not be metrically correct, Aklujkar's emendation of  c & d to:

"tathopaanaha aayaanti sarvaa maam ii a-mandiraat "

makes less sense to me. Might the learned nizAcara provide us with the
analysis of the sandhi of the last pada?
