That was the oft-repeated view of no lesser a Chinese linguist than Y.R.
Chao, and I guess we can take his word for it. The same script-artifact
"monosyllabism" is also found in Tibetan, btw. The facts are:

(1) most _morphemes_ (not words) in  these languages are monosyllabic.

(2) the scripts delimit syllables, but not words.

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(XIV Dalai Lama)

"A coincidence, as we say in Middle-Earth"
