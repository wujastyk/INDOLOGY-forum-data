======================================================================
Barnard College is hosting an international conference called

         "Encountering Kali: Cultural Understanding at the Extremes"

All day on Friday and Saturday, September 20-21, 1996
and part of Sunday, September 22, 1996.
         
         It is being coordinated by Jeffrey Kripal, of Westminster
         College, and Rachel McDermott, of Barnard College. Invited
         paper-givers include: Sarah Caldwell, Vidya Dehejia,
         Patricia Dold, Sanjukta Gupta, Cynthia Humes, David Kinsley,
         Stanley Kurtz, Patricia Lawrence, Malcolm McLean, Usha Menon,
         Carl Olson, Narasingha Sil, Hugh Urban, and Cornelia
         Vogelsanger. Original art work on the goddess Kali is
         provided by Steven Livick.

         Would any of you like to join us as participant observers?
         Because all of the participants are paying their own ways, we
         have no funds or grants to offer, but there is no
         registration fee, and the meals are a bargain!
