A good volume about earrings is 
Postel, M.  Ear Ornaments of Ancient India.  Bombay: Project for Indian
Cultural Studies, 1989.
There is also:
Chandra, Rai Govind.  Indo Greek Jewellery.  New Delhi: Abhinav Publications,
1979.
For jewelry accross cultures you could look at
Mack, John.  Ethnic Jewellery.  British Museum, 1988.
Don't know which of these has specific information about men's earpieces.
 But I hope these will be helpful.  Best of luck, Amita Sarin
