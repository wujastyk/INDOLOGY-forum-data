For the time of the BrAhmaNas it may also be worth reading Klaus Mylius: *Die
gesellschaftliche Entwicklung Indiens in jungvedischer Zeit nach den
Sanskritquellen*, published in a series of articles in
Ethnographisch-Archaeologische Zeitschrift, Berlin 2/12 (1971), 3/13 (1972),
3/14 (1973), 3/15 (1974)
