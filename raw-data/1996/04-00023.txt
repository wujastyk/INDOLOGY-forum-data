>>Discussion of the brahmodya among Vedicists is fairly extensive, beginning
>>with an important article by Renou [in collaboration with Silburn] "Sur la
>>notion de brahman" in JA 237, 1949 [the second half of this article is
>>devoted to the brahmodya, which Renou considers to be a crucial Vedic
>>practice. Kuiper wrote an article on "The Ancient Aryan Verbal Contest" in
>>1960, in IIJ 4.  More recently Witzel has written an article that mentions
>>the brahmodya frequently, "The Case of the Shattered Head" [Studien zur
>>Indologie und Iranistik, 1987], which apparently has triggered a response
>>by Insler, "The Shattered Head Split and the Epic tale of ShakuntalA," BEI
>>1989-90 [I have not seen this article].

Would somebody please tell which journal the initials BEI refer to?

Thank you!
