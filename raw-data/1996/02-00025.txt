I think this reaction is uncalled for. One may use the word, 'chaos' without 
normative implications. What is meant is merely that the usual norms 
followed in a milieu are suspended during the Holy festival. One may have an 
alternative perception of what Holy festival  is, and may want to contest a 
particular description. But this can be done without calling names.
