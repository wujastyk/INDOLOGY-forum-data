Dear list members,
I need to know some details about the following scholars:
1. A. Venis (or Venice?), who was principal at Government Sanskrit 
College (Queen's College?) at Banaras during the 1890s or 1900s. What was 
his particular field and what publications he had.
2. L. de Baron Holstein (Baron de Holstein?), where was he from, what was 
his special field, from where he published Kazyapa Parivarta?
I would appreciate very much any information in this regard.

Sincerely
Benjamin Preciado-Solis.
