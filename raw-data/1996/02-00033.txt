Dear colleague,
I don't know whether all members of the list received my message from
*anonymus*. If so, please let me know. I have not experienced that 
problem before.

As to lemon grass oil, it is the most common - and perhaps the most
adequate - way of *inking* South Indian palm leaf mss. If you 
enter the well-maintained ms-collections of the south, you 
immediately recognized its pleasant smell. 

There is at least one other, cheaper concoction around - I forgot
what exactly it consists of - the smell of which I would associate
with a garage rather than a library. Read mss. treated like that for
a couple of hours, and you will probably feel the intensive wish of
being somewhere else.

In terms of readability, I cannot see a lot of difference between 
lemon grass oil and the other stuff. As to microfilming, I'm not sure.

This leads me back to my question: Does anyone have suggestions for 
microfilming this type of material? Can the often poor result be 
enhanced by filters, special light or other tricks of the trade?
