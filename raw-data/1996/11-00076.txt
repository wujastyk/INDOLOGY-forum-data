Subject: Uniform transliteration of Brahmic scripts

After this summer's discussion on this list and with the expectation of 
further discussion at Bangalore in January (at which I can't be present), 
here is a _brief_ presentation of four *tentative* transliteration 
schemes, for different purposes. They are largely based on existing 
schemes.  I am grateful to Leslaw Borowski, P D ("Das") Menon, and 
Dominik Wujaskyk for input of various sorts; the shortcomings of the 
schemes are my own.
         
                 = Draft 0.2 dated Nov 8, 1996 =  

SCRIPTS covered: Assamese, Bengali, Devanagari (+ extensions), Grantha, 
Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu.  
The question of what belongs to what script is not considered in detail. 

Transliteration SCHEMES:
   P. for print, using the full resources of fonts/type;
Computer storage using 7-bit coding (ISO/IEC 10646, IRV):
  C1. Case insensitive coding (stressing elegance);
  C2. Case sensitive coding (stressing economy);
also variations for use on a typewriter.  

NOTATION for Latin characters with diacritical marks: If L stands for any 
Latin letter and A, B, C, D stand for any diacritics, the expression   
 L(A/B)   denotes the letter L with diacritic A above and B below it, and 
(given here for completeness) the expression    scriptname L(A/B)[C/D]    
denotes the form of L(A/B) in the script 'scriptname', with diacritic C 
above and D below it; where mark A is to replace the dot of a dotted Latin 
letter. (Superfluous elements may be omitted depending on context.) 
Marks which cannot be typed in 7-bit ascii are:
       o = small circle
      ss = small semicircle open upwards [usual short vowel sign]
      cb = candrabindu
      at = acute accent

NOTES are at the end.

NOTES
(1):e, :o are the short Dravidian vowels.
(2)^e, ^o are 'new' Dev vowels, used (e.g.) for English words.
(3)jihvamulia and upadhmaniya each have old forms; ardhavisarga is an 
   old form of both (cf. F. Kittel, A Kannada-English dictionary, 1894).
(4)R. Caldwell distinguishes Tam aytam (velar fricative) from visarga.
(5)Dev .lh may be treated as a ligature, as its graphical form suggests.
(6)Ori has .l here and l later.  Ben, Ori do not distinguish v from b, 
   but Ori has a separate v (pronounced /w/) for Urdu and English words.
(7)Ass, Ben, Ori.  
(8)Mar reph.
