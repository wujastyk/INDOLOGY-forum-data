But the compiled program searches the file "skt.opt" in the path you have to
specify in the source code. This, however, may vary. So, in a precompiled
version you have to work always in the directory where your *.skt files are
located. Else the program "skt" will end in an error message longing for
your input where to find skt.opt. The result may be that you have everywhere
"skt.opt" files. The problem becomes even worse if you consider a DOS system
in a network where you have to consider different disk drives.

I think the program distribution with the source code is the best solution
to face these problems.
