Amita Sarin asked about chronograms in Hindi works
These are quite common as a way for giving the date of the composition of a 
work.
They follow, I think, the same conventions as are found in Sanskrit and 
Prakrit literature. 
Mostly terms like moon, for one, wing, for two etc. are used. 
There are some fine lists of such words used in chronograms. A good one is 
found in:
Jinabhadrasuri jnana bhandara jaisalamera suci patra dvitiya khanda. Seva 
mandira, Ravati, Jodhpura, 1988.
On the other hand the use of the Katapadya system to give a date for a Hindi 
work is very rare indeed.
