I don't know if this helps you or not, but, Kutsa figures in the 
JaiminIya brAhmaNa as the son of Indra (made from 
his two thighs.  As such, I suppose he would perhaps qualify as 
divinity.  He later goes on to seduce ZacI, who isn't capable of 
distinguishing between the two of them. (JB 3. 199)
