North Indian classic music consist on four elements, the drone, the melodi,
the second melodi and drums. 

1. Is there any book/articles available which discuss this form or four
elements in Indian music?  I havn't found any.

2. Is there any book/articles available that deals with the "drone"?
       I havn't found any.

3. Contain "classical indian literature" any reference to the tambura?
