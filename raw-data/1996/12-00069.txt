  For the numeral notation of the Kauthuma-Saamaveda, see Wayne Howard, 
Saamavedic Chant (New Haven and London, 1977), pp. 29--75: Chap. 1. The 
Kauthuma Numeral Notation. Concerning the saaman in ChU 2,24, which you have 
quoted, it is to be noted that there is another version of the same passage 
with different musical numbers, which, I think, are those of the 
gaayatra-saaman: O. B"ohtlingk, 'Kh^andogjopanishad (Leipzig, 1889), p. 23f.; 
Chaandogya Braahmanam, III (Kumbakonam, 1980), p. 60f.
