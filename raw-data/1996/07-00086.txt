Dear Indologists,

I am designing a web site which will feature translations from Latin,
Sanskrit, Greek, Hebrew, and Egyptian. I had in mind to make the pages
reflect the qualities of the original manuscripts, e.g. translations of
hieroglyphs on stone or plaster.

My question is what backgrounds would be most representative for:
        Sanskrit

Someone tells me some manuscripts were written on leaves ?

TIA for your suggestions. If you have any appropriate backgrounds, I
would appreciate a copy or URL.

Please respond off-list.

Thx,
