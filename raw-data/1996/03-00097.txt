Subject: Changes in INDOLOGY??

Dear Dominik,

I wholeheartedly endorse the recommendations of Prof. Witzel. The problem
is analogous to the debate in the USA on the V-chip to control violent TV shows
not suitable for children. There are all types of printed media; it is for
the discerning buyer to decide on what magazines he wants to pick up from
the news stand. So too on the internet newsgroups; the core interest group
will last out the transient spammers. Regards. Kalyanaraman.
