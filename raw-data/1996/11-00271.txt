Dear Robert Zydenbos,

it seems that our discussion has reached a kind of impasse, we are beginning
to repeat ourselves. It has also reached a temperature where I see little
hope of some kind of mutual understanding, and finally the debate now seems
to require more time than I have at my disposal. I therefore drop out of the
discussion.

One point, however: You imply that I try to protect my own paycheck. As a
matter of fact, I am not a Hindi scholar but a Sanskritist. I was a research
fellow at the university of Oslo until June this year and I am now not
employed by a university. I have nothing to gain personally from defending
the position of Hindi/Urdu. 

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
