----------------------- From Announce Message ------------------------------

An introductory course to the Sanskrit language is now available
by anonymous ftp from ftp.nac.ac.za/wikner/

BEWARE: there is a very thin piece of wire to South Africa, 
        and it is stretched rather taut, so the best time to
        ftp would be Sunday morning local time (GMT+2:00).

The files are:

sktintro.ps600-a4paper-july96         (5695k)
sktintro.ps600-a4paper-july96-zip      (676k) - remember to set TYPE to BINARY

sktintro.ps600-letter-july96         (5696k)
sktintro.ps600-letter-july96-zip      (677k) - remember to set TYPE to BINARY

Enjoy!

Your file sktintro.ps file is loaded to jaguar site so that in case
it is faster for people in US or UK they can access it.  In case anyone
had difficulty accessing your site you can ask them to try this.
For size constraints, they are compressed as
sktintro.ps.Z (Unix) and sktintps.zip (PC) and will be linked through
ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/
or through sanskrit.html.

namaami 

	I downloaded the book by shrii Charles Wikner. For the sake of
convenience of folks in US ( as a support to the thin wire going to
south africa), I have kept in

http://reddy20.tamu.edu/~msr/sktintro.ps.gz
	
	With browsers like netscape and lynx, it is possible to
download this file.

	It is a compressed file ( using gzip) of original letter
format file. I don't have enough space to keep the file in original
form ( close to 9 MB). May be sanskrit site at jaguar can host these
files.

Thanks for your attention.

Subject: Those big sanskrit files on ftp

I have put that much talked about sanskrit file on the ftp site

ea.biz.usyd.edu.au/pub/sanskrit

These are both the a4 and letter size versions there. Note that this site 
is in Australia and hence may be slow for some people. I also ask that if 
people are having trouble getting the files, please email me and let me 
know. If the site gets too busy, they will be removed from there very 
quickly so please be responsible :>

Hope this helps some people...

Scott

Subj:	Wikner's Sanskrit Course

Dear Indologists,

Charles Wikner's materials for Introductory Sanskrit are now available under
"Sanskrit" at the European mirror of ousia:

        http://www.inca.de/user/will/ousia/Indologist.html

Please use this site instead of Wikner's FTP site to download the materials.
That server is rather slow and overloaded. The larger files are zipped.

Regards,

Will Wagers        "Reality is the best metaphor."
