Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone know where the Sprenger collection of Indian mss. is currently
housed, and if it has been catalogued and the catalogue published? How can
one obtain a microfilm of a manuscript from this collection?  My impression
was that it was in the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek in Berlin, but I would
appreciate more concrete information.

Thanks,
