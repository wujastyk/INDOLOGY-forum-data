In answer to Francois Quiviger's query about Indian versions of debates with
Christians, I can recommend S.A.A. Rizvi's Religious and Intellectual History
of the Muslims in Akbar's Reign (Munshiram Manoharlal, 1975).  Chapter 3 on
religious discussions contains a section on the Christians at Akbar's court
(pp. 131-6) with references to Abul Fazl's and Badaoni's accounts.  Hope this
is helpful.
