Subject: Sankara Centenary?
Message-ID: <161227022387.23782.1233203231564179420.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Reading Govind Chandra Pande's _Life and Thought of Sankaracarya_ 
(Motilal, 1994), I find a reference to "the celebration of the Twelfth
Centenary of Sankara's birth" having occurred recently.  Does anyone know 
when or how extensive this observance was?  Or who promoted it?
 
Thanks in advance.
