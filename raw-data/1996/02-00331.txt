	The subject of male ear-rings in India is indeed very interesting 
and important.  We indeed hear of KarNa in the Mahaabhaarata as 
possessing divine Kavaca and KuNDalas.  In the 17th century Maharashtra, 
there is clear evidence of ear-rings as being common for Brahman males.  
They are given as gifts of honor by kings.  The Marathi word for it is 
"bhikbaaLii".  Male Brahman children to this day have their ears 
routinely pierced.  I myself have pierced ears, which were indeed useful 
to me when I acted the roles of the kings Agnimitra and Dushyanta during 
my college days in Pune, and I had to wear the royal ear-rings, along 
with the rest of the costume.
