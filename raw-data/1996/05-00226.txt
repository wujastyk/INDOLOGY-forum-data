Does anyone know:

a)  whether Francois BIZOT has an email or snailmail address?

b)  whether it is possible to get a copy of a paper he delivered at the 10th
International Conference of the International Association of Buddhist Studies
(Pari
s, July 1991) on " The obscure 'Yogavacara's manual' edited by T. W. Rhys
Davids in 1896"

I understand Bizot thinks this text is a Khmer composition, and wish I had
more details.

Thanks for any help,

jonathan
