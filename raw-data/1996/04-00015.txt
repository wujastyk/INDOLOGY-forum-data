I also do not have references to literature on medieval debates, but I also
am interested in the topic.  I do know that such debates go back, also, to
Vedic brahmodyas, about which I am very concerned, and about which there is
some secondary literature.  If there is interest in broadening the
discussion to Vedic origins, I would gladly forward references and
observations.
