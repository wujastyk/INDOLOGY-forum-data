Enormous thanks to the Kyoto scholars, especially Profs. Tokunaga, Yano,
and their colleagues and students, for the slew of smrti texts which were
made freely available on the net a few weeks ago.

I have made links to these files from the INDOLOGY web page, under
"Virtual archive of e-texts", as well as having made copies of the files
(and zipped them and extracted readme information) available from the
INDOLOGY ftp site in London.

So these and other files are now available via
   http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
as well as by direct anonymous ftp from
   ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/texts

Best wishes,
