Actually, at least in the U.S., "pragmatic" concerns were a main reason
for the development of area studies programs--essentially products of the
cold-war. Area studies got a big boost from WW II and its aftermath, when
the U.S. government put a lot of money into funding programs teaching
about various areas of "vital national interest" (e.g., Eastern European
and Soviet studies, South Asian studies, East Asian studies, etc.), and
this included linguistic training, of course. In the academic geography of
the U.S., various "centers" stand out as being particularly important for
this-or-that areal program (for South Asia, e.g., Chicago, Berkeley, and
others). Funding, especially governmental funding, is _never_ for purely
"intellectual" concerns.
