Subject: Significance of crossroads

Does anybody know what the sources are for the specific connotations attached to
crossroads? I'm thinking, for example, of how in the cAturmAsya sacrifice, the
tryambakeSTi must be offered at a crossroads. It's easy to see why Tryambaka
would be dealt with outside the sacrificial enclosure, but why precisely at a
crossroads? Is it because it's a sort of no-man's land?

Thank you in advance for any leads,
