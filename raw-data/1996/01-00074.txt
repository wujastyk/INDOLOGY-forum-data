The South Asia Gopher
(gopher://gopher.cc.columbia.edu:71/11/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia)
has, under the SOUTH ASIANISTS sub-menu, a listing of all South
Asia-related mailing lists and listservs, complete with descriptions
and instructions for each. The entry for VYAKARAN follows below.

Welcome to Vyakaran, the mailing list for all aspects of South Asian 
linguistics!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This list was started in October 1995 as an informal forum for all who are 
interested in the languages of South Asia, both modern and classical.

The aim of this list is to further discussion among interested scholars in 
ALL aspects of South Asian languages, primarily but not only Indo-Aryan 
languages. Thus comments and questions on everything from historical 
linguistics to the modern Indo-Aryan languages, from socio-linguistics to
morphology and syntax, from phonology and diglossia to Panini and the 
Hindi-Urdu question are welcome, just to name a few.

Right now, all mailings are being done by hand, so it will sometimes take 
two or three days for postings to be sent out. All you have to do to join 
is send a message with the subject: VYAKARAN to
 
                      gor05 at rz.uni-kiel.d400.de

with the message:

subscribe VYAKARAN firstname_lastname, email at address

and that's it! Within a few days you should receive confirmation of your 
subscription along with the week's postings.

To send a message to everyone on the list, just send your message to the 
email-address above with a short message of the contents in the subject 
line. Within a day or two everyone on the list will get a copy of it. 
That's all there is to it! As all mailings are now being done by hand, 
please include the word 'vykaran' in the subject, so that I'll know it's 
for the list and not for me, as I'm using my own mailbox at the moment. For 
example: 'vyakaran: tense and aspect', etc.

To quit the list at any time, just send a short note to the email address 
above.

Within the next few weeks, I expect that the list will end up with a new 
address, and will be fully automatic, but until further notice, 
<gor05 at rz.uni-kiel.d400.de> is it. 

As I am very new to this sort of thing, I'd greatly appreciate any tips 
any of you in the list could share with me to make the list operate a little 
better. However, have no fear, I'm told that within 4 or 5 weeks we should be 
'automatic'.

If you have any questions, feel free to write to me at the following 
address:

SVAGATAM!
