Asceticism, Religion and Civilization in South Asia: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism

National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Seminar for College Teachers

Professor Steven Collins, Director
24 June 1996 - 16 August 1996
University of Chicago

        This 8-week seminar will explore asceticism as a phenomenon in  the
history and comparison of civilizations.  Not all civilizations have given
a place to ascetic values and practices: among those which have, none has
done so more clearly than the South Asian.  Ascetics reject the basic
requirements of society: production and reproduction, providing the food
and children necessary for any continuing collectivity.  In what sense can
asceticism be of value to the majority of members, male and/or female, of
any society?  The meetings will examine classical texts from the three
religions, as well as modern secondary sources and documentary films,
intending to offer a creative environment for the individual research
projects of participants, who may be either South Asia specialists or other
interested scholars.

        Participants receive a stipend of $4000.  The application deadline
is 1 March 1996.  Notification date is 29 March 1996.  Applicants cannot be
enrolled graduate students and cannot be from institutions which grant a
graduate degree in a field related to the above topic (South Asian Studies,
etc.).  Please contact via email for fastest response (information can be
emailed and an application can be sent via regular mail).
