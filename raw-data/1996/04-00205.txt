My apologies if this message is "late", and if it has already appeared. I 
have been having difficulty in sending messages to this address.

To the best of my knowledge, the drone is not mentioned before 
the dates given by several other respondents.

In looking at the early musical treatises, the other three elements are 
there. However, it is often difficult to determine whether a passage refers 
to the secondary melody or the drums, since the same word vaadya is used to 
signify both the drums and the instruments that supply the secondary melody 
with which the voice is accompanied.

On the subject of early references to drones, I recently read a reference 
in Chitrabhanu Sen's "Dictionary of Vedic Rituals" to the upagaatr: "a 
subordinate chanter, chorister; there are at least 4 upagaatr who say "ho" 
continuously in a low tone".

Aside from the references given by Sen to the Laatyyaayana and Apastamba 
srautasutras, can anybody tell me a little more of this practice, or 
further sources for it. I am a student of modern Indian music, rather than 
a scholar of Sanskrit, so my efforts to decipher Sanskrit are rather 
tenuous.

Thanks

John Napier
