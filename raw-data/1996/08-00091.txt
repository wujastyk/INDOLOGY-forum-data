And the reverse is also sometimes found: what is frequently referred
to as a language (e.g. "Chinese") can actually be a set of mutually
UNintelligible "dialects", again for political/cultural/literary reasons.

I have no objection to such a procedure is applied explicitly with
such explanations. But note: the tiny set of "Official Languages" of
India were never intended to be a set of all the spoken varieties that
are politically, culturally, literarily, or historically treated as
"languages". That is, "Official Languages" are a specialized subset of
"languages" given a special recognition in the constitution, but never
claiming that the other varieties are not languages.
(Historians: please elucidate if I am mistaken).
