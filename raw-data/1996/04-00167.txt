I have found Bonnie Wade's Music In India: The Classical Traditions
(Prentice Hall, 1979) very useful for her discussions on melody, drone and
drums.  She discusses melody at length in chapter 3, surveying Hindustani
and Carnatic notions.  There is a whole chapter on percussion instruments (I
think she calls it "Rhythm Instruments and Drumming").  Several references
to the drone and a discussion on it in one chapter, but I agree with the
earlier note from Sri Pichumani that B. Chaitanya Deva has the most
extensive research on it in "The Psychoacoustics of Music and Speech"
(Madras: Music Academy ?).
