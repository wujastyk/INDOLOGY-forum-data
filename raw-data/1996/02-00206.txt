I would like to welcome warmly the announcement just posted on the Indology list by 
Asko Parpola about the establishing of an institutional network for collaboration in 
the field of classical South Asian studies in Europe.    We should all be grateful to 
our colleagues in Scandinavia for taking this initiative.   It will be, I am sure, an 
important development and on behalf of the Department of Sanskrit in Edinburgh I wish 
to announce that we should be pleased to become involved with this venture in whatever 
way proves feasible for a department of just two members (Paul Dundas and myself).
