> For various reasons (I have no e-mail connection at home and no time to

> Bollensen had moved to Kazan in 1852 and to Germany in 1858. Petrov 
> taught in Moscow. Minaev (1840-90) was still student in Germany and 
> started his teaching in St. Petersburg only in 1869. As was noted by 
> Wyzlic, Boehtlingk never lectured and Roth did not even live in Russia. 
> The man in charge of Sanskrit at the Oriental Faculty of St. Petersburg 
> University was Kaetan Andreevich Kossovich (1815-1883), known of an 
> unfinished Sanskrit-Russian dictionary (1854-56), of an edition of Old 
> Persian cuneiform inscriptions (1872), of several Avestic studies and 
> translations of Indian classics into Russian (parts of the Mbh and some
