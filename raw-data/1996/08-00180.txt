Message-ID: <161227025836.23782.156833303452459278.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I'm having some trouble finding a copy of D. M. Datta's book entitled The Six 
Ways of Knowing: A Critical Study of the Advaita Theory of Knowledge.  It was 
originally published in 1932 but the most recent edition was 1972, published 
by Univ. of Calcutta.  Can someone help me find a copy for purchase?

Thanks!
