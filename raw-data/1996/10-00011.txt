Ashok gave me a reference to panca-parva in the Yogasutra. For that, I am
most grateful. However, the panca-parvan with which I need help derives
from the tradition of jyotihsastra, and refers to five changes, including
the time of the new and full moons. Specifically, I would like to know
what the five are, and where in the literature they are mentioned. parvan
here is neut. noun. Many thanks again. Ken
