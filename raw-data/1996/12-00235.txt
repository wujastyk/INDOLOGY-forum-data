Lars Martin Fosse, who temporarily has withdrawn from our discussion group,
asks me to comvey the following message:

"Dear Indology netters,

I am now disconnected from Indology net, and if any of you want to send me a
message, please use my private email address: L.M.Fosse at internet.no. I'll be
here on the 25th and 26th before proceeding to India, and I'll check my
email then.

A merry Christmas and a happy new year to you all.

Lars Martin Fosse"
