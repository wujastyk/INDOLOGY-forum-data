                                                  Marathi
I don't have a currency note right here, but would guess 
that it is actually Marathi (not Hindi) that comes after 
Malayalam.  Also, Gujarati is missing from the above list,
and I'm pretty sure "Rajasthani" isn't an official language.  
Hindi and English are on the center and margins, and don't 
reappear in the "list" area with all the other languages.

I think that's Marathi.  The list seems to be
in (English) alphabetical order.

Marathi and Gujarati are missing from the
above list;  I don't think "Rajasthani"
exists.  I believe Konkani is the state
language of Goa; possibly Manipuri for
Manipur; English for Nagaland and possibly
some other Northeastern states; maybe Nepali
for Sikkim (there was a big controversy about
it at one time, for fear of irritating the
Nepalese government).  I believe there is a
language called "Divehi", which may or may not
be an official language in the Union Territory
of Lakshadweep.

Just some educated guesses...


Raja.
