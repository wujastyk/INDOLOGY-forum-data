In his commentary on VAkyapdaIya 2.37 (vAkyeSv arthAntaragateH ...)
PuNyarAja gives tailapAyikA as an example of a term which involves rUDhi in
that the vigrahavAkya utterance (tailam pibati) used to give its analysis
has a sense different from that of the derivate.  Earlier, in his NyAsa on
KAzikA 6.3.2 (Varanasi ed. V.196), Jinendrabuddhi had used the same example
for this purpose.  In his AmbAkartrI commentary, RaghunAtha Sharma (vol.
II. p. 84 of the *1st* ed.) remarks that tailapAyikA refers to a particular
*insect* (kITavizeSa), called telcaT in Bhojpuri.  George Cardona
