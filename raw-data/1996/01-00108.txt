From: Irene Joshi <joshi at u.washington.edu>

I wonder if anyone on H-ASIA could provide a useful answer to the
accompanying query recently received.

Subject: Photographing? text

A professor here is traveling to India this summer and needs to "record"
some images of ancient Sanskrit text to bring back to the University to
translate.  He needs to be able to enlarge this images to a readable size,
yet maintain a "clearness" of image so that the characters are discernable.
Preferably, he would transfer the images to a computer format so that he
could translate them on screen.

Does anyone have any experience with this type of project? We need to
suggest necessary equipment, so that he can determine how it will fit into
his grant money. Best case scenario, is it possible to purchase some type
of lens for a standard 35mm camera to shoot clear images of the text and
make either prints or slides, or PhotoCD that are readable? (We were
thinking low budget here)

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Lisa

Response to query on photographic copies of manuscripts
**********************************************************************
From: Lance Brennan <HYLB at sigma.sss.flinders.edu.au>

With reference to the query just posted on research photography of
manuscripts and documents:

My experience of taking microfilm of manuscripts and newspapers in
India suggests that an ordinary 35mm SLR camera with its usual lens
is the most appropriate instrument. The film should be normal black
and white. It is important to have a cable release to prevent
movement of the camera, and most important is to have a tripod or
some other stand to hold the camera steady. I have generally
ended up tying my tripod to a chair, but there were splendid
tripods with an adjustable overhanging fixture in London in 1992.
Where the material is indoors you need artificial light - a couple of
desk lamps purchased in India with 100 watt globes is more than
ample. Outside, the light should be reasonable through most Indian
seasons.
In terms of technique, the crucial elements are 1. Getting the light
even over the page or object, and checking this with the light meter
of the camera at each shot (especially outside). This is what makes
the process rather slow. 2. Keeping the camera steady. 3. Keeping a
record on the film where possible - and in a diary.
If the light is poor you can use slower film (I have used microfilm
specially cut up for the camera cassettes) but more recent experience
suggests that normal film will give satisfactory images if the camera
is rock steady, and will not be as sensitive to shifts/ variations in
light.
The camera I used in Mauritius in 1992 to film hand written shipping
registers was a Pentax KF1000: hardly a sophisticated instrument.
I was able to buy extra black and white film in Mauritius, and have
it developed there.
If you need any more information about the speed of the film - which
I cannot remember off hand - please let me know.
