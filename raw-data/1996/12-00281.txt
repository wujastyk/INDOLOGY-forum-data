 Tobias asked about MadanakAmarAjan's story. It is available in translation.
 I don't recall that  it is about which gender is better. But there are 
 lot more debates in Tamil folk settings.

eg.,

thAy makaL Ecal - Mother teasing her daughter(D) about D's new love affair;

kuRavanji -  quarrels/debates amongst a couple (Singan & Singi)

paLLu - debates on various themes (like Saiva & Vaishnava - which is 
         better) between two wives of `paLLan` (agricultural servant)

No book length studies have appeared in any Western language.
