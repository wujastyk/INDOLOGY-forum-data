Hello,
	I am looking for an edition of the pArijAtahraNa champu by sEshakrishna
kavi with a good commentary either in Sanskrit or in English. I have an edition
published by Chaukhamba publications of vAraNAsi, with a minimal commentary in 
Sanskrit (just the anvayakramam), but I am looking for an edition with a more 
extensive commentary. Does such a thing exist? I will be grateful for any 
pointers towards this - by the way sEshakrishna kavi lived in vAraNAsi in the 
16th century, and was patronized by the son of Todarmall, who was the finance 
minster of Akbar.

regards,
K.Desikachary.
