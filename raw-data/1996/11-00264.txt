Dear Indology members,
I would appreciate comments and guidance on the following lexemes:
pIliyAr in Tamil (tEvAram. 346,10) refers to Jains.

The Tamil lexicon relates it to pIli which has
the following meanings: peacock's feather; white umbrella, peacock fan.
pIli also means GOLD.

I am told that the pIluka, pIruka referring to a bear in Tamil may be 
derived from Skt. bhIruka, bhIluka from bhallUka, bear.
regards, kalyanaraman.
