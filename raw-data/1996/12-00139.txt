With reference to Katherine Ulrich's query about Bengali, I may note that
an intensive first year Bengali course has been offered, and I anticipate,
will be offered in the future during the summer sessions at the University
of Washington in Seattle.

For further information contact the Dept. of Asian Languages & Literature,
University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.  The department's chair is
Michael Shapiro <hindimcs at u.washington.edu>.
