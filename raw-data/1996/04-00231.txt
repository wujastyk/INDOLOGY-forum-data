Dear Partha Banerji,

While cleaning up the pile-up of 2,534 indology messages especially 
during my time away, I came across your message. hve you seen my paper" 
Hindu doubts about God - towards a Mimamsa deconstruction" ? It was 
published in International Philosophical Quarterly in 1992 ( can send you 
the exact reference in a few days).
