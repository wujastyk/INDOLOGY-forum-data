I am posting the following message for a friend (Viveka Sharma) who does not
have access to an email:

"I am planning to take my Macintosh PowerBook Computer (5300cs) during my
forthcoming trip to India.  I will appreciate any suggestions concerning
general precautions to take or problems to anticipate. Thanks in advance." 

Please respond directly to me at <mittals at ere.umontreal.ca>. Thanks a lot.
