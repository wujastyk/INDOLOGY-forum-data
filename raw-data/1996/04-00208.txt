Dear Indologists,

There was a posting on this forum earlier this year about a Sanskrit
Conference to be held in Northern Europe in August of this year.
Unfortunately I lost all the details about it.  Could someone send me a
copy of that posting or at least the e-mail address of the conveners.

merci d'avance
