(Apologies in advance to those of you who will get this twice.)

I have searched high and low, up and down, and all around for the 
following, but I have so far had no luck at all. Now I'm beginning to 
wonder if this has even "come down" to us from the seventeenth century. 
The work is:
	(Prau.dha)manoramAkha.n.danam
The author is:
	CakrapA.nidatta or "Se.sacakrapA.ni(datta) or just CakrapA.ni

It is an attack on the SiddhAntakaumudI of Bha.t.toji DIk.sita.

With the help of our loyal but sometimes mystified interlibrary loan 
people here, I have checked all the libraries in the major universities 
in Canada, and the libraries in most of the major universities of the US. I 
will be grateful for any suggestions.
