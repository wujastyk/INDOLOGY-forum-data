`SPEAK SANSKRIT' classes by Sri Krishna Shastry: Mar-May 1997

Last year's tour of Sri Krishna shastry was a big success with more 
than 1000 people attending his classes all over USA. Speaking Sanskrit 
looked so easy for those who attended the classes for 6-8 hours. His 
stay was very short in each city and only a glimps at the new teaching 
techniques for sanskrit could be given. A rare combination of humor, 
wit and his dynamism made the classes very lively.

This year, we plan to organize full 20 hours classes for 7 days in each 
city and also weekend camps for teachers training in few cities.

Alongwith Sri Krishna Shastry, we will have other two experienced 
teachers in spoken Sanskrit- Sri Vishwas, Chief Editor of the 
Sanskrit monthly "Sambhashana Sandeshah" and Sri Vasuvaj, co-ordinator 
for Samskrita Bharati in Kerala and Tamilnadu. Both of them have 
conducted more than 300 `Speak Sanskrit in 10 days' classes.

Other than the 15 cities that Shri Shastry visited last year, we plan to have
these 
classes in few more cities where there is enough interest and  volunteers to 
co-ordinate. Cities where we will definitely have the classes are San
Francisco, 
Los Angeles, Houston, New Jersey, New York,  Philadelphia, Washington DC, 
Boston, Miami, Orlando, Columbus, Chicago and Atlanta.

NEED VOLUNTEERS : It will be a memorable experience to work with a 
group of energetic and enthusiastic volunteers from all over USA to 
promote Sanskrit. The tremendous interest for Samskrit in USA and the
enthusiastic 
work done by volunteers contributed to the great success last year. We expect
more volunteers to join us this year to take this movement to still greater
heights. 
Please send an email to volunteer. Any talent and any 
amount of time you have will be useful (Even internet time is counted:)
