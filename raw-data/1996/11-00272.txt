If you haven't done so already, I would recommend checking the translation of
the critical edition edited by Robert Goldman and published by Princeton. The
Ayodhyakanda is in the second volume of the series, translated by Sheldon
Pollock. It contains very useful annotations (including references to the
traditional commentators) and bibliography.
