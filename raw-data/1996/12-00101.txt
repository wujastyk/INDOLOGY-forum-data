Good point!
But I would suggest another comparison, this time to the spread of Spanish
in Latin America.  This is more recent and, obviously, better documented.
It was a combination of military conquest (in the earlier stages),
settlement (at first mainly by men), intermarriage (well, not really, rather
white Spanish men having children with dark-skinned native women) and
gradual acculturation, shall we say "Spanishization," to coin a familiarly
sounding term.
