I am not amember of the indology conference so cannot post this directly.
Please post this response to your and several other questions about making
copies of manuscripts and other items. There is a fantastic product that
recently came on the market in the US. It is called "Snappy" and connects to a
pc thorugh its parallel port. It uses advanced digital signal processing to
get 4 or 5 times the physical resolution of a common camcorder. (there is
nothing else like it on the market at any price) You can captue fantastic
still photos using a tripod and a camcorder. It can take a lot of disk space,
but at least you know instantly if you have a good shot or not. The cost is
only $200 US.
You can get a 4GB disk for about $1,000, which will hold quite a lot. Or you
could get a 1 GB and bring along a CD recorder for about $1,000. Be careful,
though, CD recorders tend to require the full SCSI capability of a docking
port. They will not run on MAC SCSI portables or PC parrallel port SCSIs. A
less expensive alternative would be to take a portable printer with you and
print the shots as you take them.
