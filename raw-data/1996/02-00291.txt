There is only one English translation to my knowledge: that by Ganganatha  
Jha published in the early thirties in the Gaekwad's Oriental Series. It  
contains only the translation.

Have a look at J.-M. Verpoorten's history of Mimamsa literature (published  
in the Harrassowitz Series "History of Indian Literature"). Perhaps this  
helps you.
