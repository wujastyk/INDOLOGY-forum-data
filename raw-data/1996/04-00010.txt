end-run around Unicode, which means that their standard would not
necessarily include the fullest complement of diacritics (e.g., for
Sanskrit and other Indian languages) nor non-roman fonts (e.g., CKJ,
Arabic, Persian, Russian, etc.). If so, it'll still be some time before
those become standard accessible fonts (as opposed to add on capabilities
as is now possible for East Asian languages with Netscape). Has anyone
heard differently?
