Jan Nattier, I think, must have written something on Sogdian Buddhism. The
only text of hers I have to hand, _Once Upon a Future Time (Asian
Humanities Press 1991), makes reference to Sogdian materials in passing
(citing E. Benveniste's 1946 edition of the Vessantara Jataka from the
Sogdian & an article by N. Sims-Williams in Sprachen des Buddhismus in
Zentralasien, ed. Roerhborn and Veenker 1983). I know she has done
extensive work across the various Central Asian Buddhist traditions.

To answer your question directly, Nattier cites the Sogdian material
precisely in the context of Buddhist missionary activity. They were also
responsible for the spread of Manichaeism eastwards.
