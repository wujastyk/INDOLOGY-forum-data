Dear Indology members,

I have four question with which I hope you could assist me:

1) Could anyone reccommend  recent articles or books on the life and teachings 
of the Tamil Saivite saint Arunagirinath? More specifically I am looking for 
any commentaries etc. on his Kandar Anubhuti ( I am presently working from  
the translation and commentary  by Karthikeyan).

2)I am looking for any references in  Saiva siddhanta on the relationship of 
the jivanmukta to God  _after_  the soul's departure from the body. I have 
come across many verses on the relationship of the embodied liberated soul to 
Siva but have yet to locate anything on their afterdeath relationship.  Could 
anyone point me in the direction of helpful references or better yet- provide 
me an answer...?

3)Could someone pls give me the names of  scholarly books or articles 
available  on the Lakshmi Tantra apart from the Sanjukta Gupta's?  I am 
particularly interested in any text which could shed light on how the goddess 
Lakshmi defines herself and her relationship to Visnu.

4) Could someone  suggest  contemporary works on the sociological and 
historical significance of the Tirukkural?(I must confess that my knowledge of 
this text is very scant).


Any  sugestions or thoughts on this somewhat scattered list of queries would 
be most  appreciated.  

Looking forward to you replies and thanking you in advance, 
Sujata Ghosh
