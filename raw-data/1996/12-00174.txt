Both the Velthuis and the Wikner systems for using Devanagari with TeX and
LaTeX support the hyphenation of Devanagari.  Jun Takashima is doing very
interesting work on creating TeX hyphenation tables for transliterated
Sanskrit, and aims to bring this into the fold of Babel.

On the Velthuis hyphenation support, see
ftp://ftp.ucl.ac.uk/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/software/
and the file devanagari-with-hyphenation.readme


Best wishes,
Dominik
