Dear Thursby,
	It is natural that people want to know about other cultures and hence ask
ask questions either publicly or privately about variuos aspetcs of a cuture .
Hinduism is no exception to this reasonable curiosity and knowledge of  people .	It will go a long way in promoting friendship and understanding
when non-offensive words are used . ( especially when such words give 
a wrong and bad interpretation of a society) It is enough if people ask ,
" how can we know about holi " wothout adding " chaotic " in the description.
If one wants the religious aspects of the festival one can say so 
and if one wants the social aspects then one can say that too .
So why should anyone insist on using the same insulting terms
used by early aggressive missionaries that were intended to misrepresent and demean
demean others ? That is not a scientific attitude .So the indologists should refrain from using the same wrong  and insuting descriptive words by early
19th century missionary zealots in describing hinduism . m.rajagopalan
