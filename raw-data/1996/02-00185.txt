> Dear Indologists,
> Some time ago I obtained a very nice version of Bitstream Charter
> for Windows. I set a short booklet of Adi Sankaracharya, translated
> by Swami Yogananda Sarasvati of Kaivalya Ashrama ("Forty Teachings
> in Five Verses") that so pleased the Swami at least in respect of
> the typeface that he has asked whether the font can be sent him
> in a Mac version.
> 
> This is pleasing--but now I cannot find where I got it, and do not
> recall whether it is available for the Mac. This is embarrasing, and
> I wonder whether anyone can help me.
