Abstract

In the Philippines, at the time of the Spanish conquest, the Catholic 
priests were instructed by Bishop Salazar to learn and preach in the 
languages of the inhabitants. However, certain cluster of words, 
especially those involving Animist priestesses were altered, negated and 
then marginalised almost to extinction. This movement paralleled the 
demonisation and eventual disappearance of the priestesses from 
historical texts. The paper wants to: 1) describe the process involved 
in this double negation; 2) recover the forgotten words; 3) give Animist 
priestesses back their rightful place in Philippine history.
