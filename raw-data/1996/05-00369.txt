Since some of you have shown interest and appraciation in my
earlier posting, and to those who have asked for further
infomration on the subject, I post herewith some more references, 
not only in school textbooks but also in other print media, that
you may wish to consult for writing an article/paper on 'Images
of Stereotypes of India and Indians'. I may have missed some
publications due to my neglect of this subject for the past
several years. If it is the case please do post your findings to
the list.
