Colleagues,
A long time ago I reported to this list that "our computer guy" had 
promised to compile Charles Wikner's ANSI-C file for me to produce DOS 
and OS/2 exe files. It looks like he won't be able to do that. Has anyone 
else done that? If not, can anyone tell me how to do it?

Gratefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
