Maybe not. In Hebrew "body" is guf, which eventually entered English as 
"goof", implying, I guess, someone who is present physically but not 
mentally... a dummy who makes mistakes.

Grammars give the appearance of neat logic, but interlinguistic 
transmissions are more chancey and happenstancish.
