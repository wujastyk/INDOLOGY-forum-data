I am currently involved in a research project investigating the mouth and
tongue positions while pronouncing correctly the different vowels and
consonants, in particular for each varga i.e. kantya, talavya, murdhanya, etc.
and aspirated, unaspirated, and nasals.  Does anyone know of books on
Linguistics or Phonology (or any related subject) which provide studies and
digrams.  Thanks in advance for your help.
