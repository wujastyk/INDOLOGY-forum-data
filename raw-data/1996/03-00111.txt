The best way to find reviews of F.D.K. Bosch's The Golden Germ is by means
of the Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology, published at the Kern
Institute, Leiden.

The ABIA for 1958-1960 mentions:
Oriental Art n.s. 6/3, 1960:114-115, by Edward Conze;

The ABIA for 1961 mentions:
East and West n.s. 12/4, 1961:266-267, by Rita Taticchi
L'Homme 1/1, 1961:132-134, by Louis Dumont

The ABIA for 1962-1963 gives:
OLZ 57, no.s 5-6, 1962, pp. 299-300 by W. Kirfel

The ABIA for 1964-1966 gives:
Arts Asiatiques 10/1, 1964:95-99, by Arion Rosu

We are presently working on details of a project proposal to turn
the ABIA into a modern computer database in which one can quickly
and completely find the answer to questions such as yours (including
references to older material, going back at least to circa 1925).
