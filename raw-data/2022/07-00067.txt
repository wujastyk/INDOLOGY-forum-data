Dear colleagues,

as some of you may still remember, I already announced here the publication 
of this partial Sanskrit translation of Don Quixote more than a year ago (on 
April 21, 2021) and included in my book announcement all the necessary 
details. One can easily find the same details about the book and the 
accompanying (freely available) audiobook also on the website of the Pune 
Indological Series (http://cms.unipune.ac.in/pis). This is also the best place 
from where this publication can be easily procured. As for the recent official 
book release by the Instituto Cervantes in New Delhi, one can now learn 
about it not only from the Guardian but also from the DD News in Sanskrit:

With best wishes,
Dragomir Dimitrov
