Dear colleagues,

I am trying to understand Raghu Vira's (negative) critical apparatus on S?rasamuccaya 6, where he labels the reading of one manuscript as "adhip??ha". I am unsure how to understand the term. Might Raghu Vira have meant the reading in question to be written over something else? Or to be in addition to something else?

Thanks and best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
