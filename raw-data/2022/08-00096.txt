Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the sixth update of our material on the 
Oxford Research Archive, first deposited in January 2016; this update is 
identified as July 2022. We do so in order that it can be available for 
others to consult even in its present, unfinished state. It can be 
accessed at the same location 
<http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8df9647a-8002-45ff-b37e-7effb669768b 
<http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8df9647a-8002-45ff-b37e-7effb669768b>> 
or you can find it via the Bodleian Libraries website, under ORA, by 
looking for either our surname or its title, "Development and spread of 
the R?ma narrative (pre-modern)".

As before, there are additions, revisions and corrections to the 
material throughout.However, areas which have seen the greatest changes are:

?Within the folder D. Ancillary material and then the folder 
?Photographs (JLB), the addition of a number more R?m?ya?a-related 
photographs and the inclusion of a substantial number of photographs of 
various Indian monuments taken over more than fifty years.

?Apart from minimal changes to the folder C. Narrative Elements, work by 
MB consists mainly of more on the folder F. New Beginnings: an overall 
survey of the effects on the traditional portrayal of the /VRm?s/ heroes 
and villains when varied supplementary elements now mostly collected 
into the CE /B?la /and/Uttara k???as/ were added to the core text, 
classified as Stage 3 (JLB 1985).The two books are themselves far from 
unitary; their diverse nature sheds light on the development, not only 
of Stage 3 itself (including the occasional transformation of the human 
R?ma into an /avat?ra/ of Vi??u), but also of a few puzzling episodes in 
the so-called ?core? books.Six chapters are planned, with the first 
three now complete:
1: Techniques and structure, including the role of allusions within the 
narrative
2: The core narrative: evidence from three summaries and from the 
/R?mop?khy?na/ for its contents and segmentation
3: The role of boons
4: [/planned/] Establishment of a R?ghava dynasty
5: [/large part composed/] Agastya?s post-victory narrative, 7,1?34
6: [/largely incomplete, focusing only on the Ahaly? and Hanum?n 
episodes/] Change of genre and divinisation of the heroes
7: additional files presenting supporting material and notes.

?Work by JLB includes considerablefurther additions to all the 
bibliographic sections of files within B.?Bibliographic Inventory, as 
well as substantial additions to the data within 10. visual (India).

//

If you are aware of colleagues in other fields (for example Southeast 
Asian languages or visual culture) who might be interested, do please 
pass the information on to them ? and similarly, if any of you have 
access to suitable academic lists on which it could be posted, we would 
be grateful if you would send it to them.

As always, we shall be grateful for any comments from anyone who has 
used the material.

With all good wishes

John and Mary
