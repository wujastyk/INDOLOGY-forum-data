Critical Edition, Translation & Study of the ?iv??ram?dhy?ya of the ?ivadharma??stra. Studies in the History of ?aivism, I.

A PDF of the book can be downloaded from the following link:

Hard-bound copies will soon be available for purchase.


This is the first volume of a new, fully open access monograph series based at the University of Naples L?Orientale and financed by the two ERC Projects Shivadharma and Dharma (see here: https://shivadharmaproject.com<https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshivadharmaproject.com%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cp.c.bisschop%40hum.leidenuniv.nl%7C13602b95a94749bfdeed08d9d5b3a86f%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C637775789873982892%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=8kUdEmx3EboxX53h5jv0GpnFFetP03%2BBav3DpiimUwI%3D&reserved=0> and here: https://dharma.hypotheses.org<https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdharma.hypotheses.org%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cp.c.bisschop%40hum.leidenuniv.nl%7C13602b95a94749bfdeed08d9d5b3a86f%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C637775789873982892%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=AHaBlCgAwaNKChGwwKLtLNu4jpmW7mIEYKGr3x5vat4%3D&reserved=0>).


However, as we welcome contributions from a wider research network, and we would like the series not to be solely bound to the projects, do not hesitate to get in touch if you have a book proposal in this field.


More volumes are already in preparation, and we hope to be able to advertise them very soon.


Congratulations to our authors for this important piece of work! It is the best possible way to get this series started.


All the best,

Florinda
