Dear Colleagues,

J?rgen Hanneder
S?hib Kaula's Tree of Languages (Kalpav?k?a)
A multilingual carmen cancellatum from 17th century Kashmir.
Marburg 2021. x, 124 pp.

ISBN 978-3-923776-66-5 (Hardcover)
15.5 x 22cm, 330g
? 32,00

ISBN 978-3-923776-67-2 (eBook)
? 23,99

The Kalpav?k?a was composed in the 17th century by the Kashmirian  
author S?hib Kaul and is edited here in its original Sanskrit for the  
first time. During the editing process it became clear that the "text"  
of the Kalpav?k?a is only the basis of an elaborate piece of verbal  
art, a crossword-like carmen cancellatum, which was originally  
displayed on a large cloth. Three of these are preserved today. The  
Kalpav?k?a is not only the largest carmen cancellatum known in world  
literature, with its roughly thirty languages used for its intexts, it  
is also displays a baffling multilingualism.
