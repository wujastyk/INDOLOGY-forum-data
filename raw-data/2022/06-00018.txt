Dear Raja,

This method popular with Jaina scholastics to highlight single, distinct 
views (nayas) of the concept under study is used very often in the 
commentary literature.
See e.g. Jinad?sa's ?va?yaka-c?r?i p. 379 and Haribhadra's 
?va?yaka-v?tti p. 181 (vs. 754).

Secondary literature e.g. Schubring, The Doctrine of the Jainas, ? 76.

Best

Heiner
