Dear Charles,

the manuscript seems to be Balinese. I?m not sure it is the R?m?ya?a though.

Best regards,

Andrea

Dear friends,

A student of mine sent me some pictures of a palm leaf manuscript they were gifted asking me if it is real and if so what the script is. It is certainly real, but I am not an expert in Southern scripts and figure someone here can give me the answer fairly immediately. It is said to be the Ram?yana.

With my best wishes,
Charles
