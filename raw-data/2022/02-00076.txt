Subject: [INDOLOGY] Current Emails for Emily Hudson and Laurie Patton
Message-ID: <CED8F39E-7A4D-4357-9564-34BB0F711DC0@googlemail.com>

Dear Colleagues, 

Could anyone supply me with the current academic emails of these two colleagues? 

I can only find emails that are ex officio for Prof. Patton and I can?t see anything up to date for Prof. Hudson.

They both might be on the list, of course!

Best,

James Hegarty
Cardiff University
