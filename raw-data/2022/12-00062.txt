Dear list members,
Its now over a year since Dhaval Patel informed the list that through his
great efforts the NMM (National Mission for Manuscripts) was ordered by the
Central Information Commission to put all the manuscripts it had
photographed into the public domain.

Does anyone know the current status of this.  Has the order been complied
with either partially or in full.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
