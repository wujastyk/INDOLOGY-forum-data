There are indications that yoga (meditation) was practised (or at least
prescribed) between the two phases of sleep, at midnight, in P??car?tra
texts ? Marion Rastelli has written a bit on this in her paper "Yoga in the
Daily Routine of the P??car?trins" - I can send you a pdf of this paper if
you like,

Best wishes,
Robert
