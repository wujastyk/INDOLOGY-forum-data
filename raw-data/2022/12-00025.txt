This is a difficult question, Peter.  The people now in charge at the
Sanskrit Department at the U. of Madras
<https://www.unom.ac.in/index.php?route=department/department/deptpage&deptid=64>,
NCC's spiritual home, do not seem actively engaged with NCC (after Prof.
Dash it was Padmanabhan; now seems to be Dr C. Murugan).  The NAMAMI in
Delhi have been funding the publication of recent volumes, and have some
unstated control or support for the project (see here
<https://www.namami.gov.in/catalogus-catallogurum>).  Prof. Dash was
invited back to finish publication copy for the final volumes from 40-42, I
believe.  That is done, but as far as I know, 40-42 have not actually been
published yet.

The person nearest to the NCC today, in terms of current information, is
probably Martin Gluckman, who is responsible for the online version of NCC
<https://vmlt.in/ncc/39?page=1>.  And it is still possible to email Prof.
Dash, whose post-retirement work takes place at the K. V. Sarma Research
Foundation <https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108561/institution>.

Best,
Dominik
