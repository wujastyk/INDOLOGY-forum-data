Quotes like ???? ?? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????????????????? indicate
words like ???????? and ?????????????????? as words close in meaning to
conscience in classical works.

In most contemporary Indian languages, Sanskrit borrowings like ???????? ,
????????(???) is used in this sense.

In Tamil, the word manassaaklshin is found used, which can be guessed to
have some Sanskrit source.
