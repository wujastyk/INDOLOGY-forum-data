Dear All,
According to Yoga-s?tra 2.35, ??????????????????, ?????????? ????????? ?
which apparently means that when someone is thoroughly established in
non-violence, (mutual) enmity disappears in his environment.
Commentaries and references given for aphorism and referred to for instance
in James Wood?s translation emphasize that in this situation *even* wild
animals, no more attack their prey. An example is Kir???rjun?ya 2.55 (meter
viyogin?): Vy?sa is looked at by Yudhi??hira:
madhurair ava??ni lambhayann   api tirya?ci ?ama? nir?k?itai?  /
parita? pa?u bibhrad enas??   dahana? dh?ma vilokanak?amam  //
?Calming even wild animals by his gentle looks, spreading a blazing
radiance around which burns away guilt, (but which yet) can be gazed at
(the sage, i.e., Vy?sa son of Par??ara, was seen by the king, Yudhi??hira)?
(tr. following Roodbergen 1984, p. 143; cp. also Raghuva??a 13.50, 14.79.)
Are any more convincing stories or anecdotes known in Sanskrit literature,
in which the peace-creating influence suggested in YS 2.35 inspires animals
or *even* humans to behave in a more peaceful way ?
With best wishes for a Peaceful Christmas New Year to all:

?????? !  ??????? ??? ?????   ???????? ??????????? ?
