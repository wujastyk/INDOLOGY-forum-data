Dear Friends:

Bob Goldman jumped the gun, but let me give the official announcement of the three programs currently supported by the Ludo and Rosane Rocher Foundation. Its new website contains all the information need to apply to any of the three programs

The Ludo & Rosane Rocher Foundation (rocherfoundation.org<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Frocherfoundation.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7C883765afaffa4aa25a7708da2efa1f71%7C31d7e2a5bdd8414e9e97bea998ebdfe1%7C0%7C0%7C637873949079316411%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GbQop6FmvHVRubGdXEvyAE%2BK2uNFoa3gAfo7x3emHBE%3D&reserved=0>), devoted to American scholarship on Classical Indology, is pleased to publicize its three current programs:

1. a new Indological book series published by Oxford University Press;
2. a subvention program for first books;
3. a postdoctoral fellowship for recent PhDs.

All programs are described in detail at rocherfoundation.org<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Frocherfoundation.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7C883765afaffa4aa25a7708da2efa1f71%7C31d7e2a5bdd8414e9e97bea998ebdfe1%7C0%7C0%7C637873949079316411%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GbQop6FmvHVRubGdXEvyAE%2BK2uNFoa3gAfo7x3emHBE%3D&reserved=0> .
Please help us spread the word about these opportunities for Indologists.
