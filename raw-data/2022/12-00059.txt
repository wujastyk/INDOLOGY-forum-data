Dear Lubomir,

Many thanks for finding this and sending the link. Getting access to this
book is very important to me. The varying spellings of titles for the books
scanned by the Digital Library of India often thwart my attempts to find
them. You seem to be an expert at finding them. I surely do appreciate your
kindness in getting me this link.

All the best to you,

David
