Dear Patrick, Tim, and Indology colleagues?

With apologies for belatedly reviving this thread, I wanted to respond to Patrick?s query by mentioning several articles of mine on this theme of Vedic revivalism:

2016 	?Survivals & Revivals: the Transmission of Jaimini?ya Sa?maveda in Modern South India.? In The Vedic S?a?kha?s: Past, Present, Future, Harvard Oriental Series Opera Minora 9, edited by Jan Houben, Julieta Rotaru, and Michael Witzel, 443-74. Cambridge, MA: Dept. of South Asian Studies, Harvard University.

2017		 ?The Amplified Sacrifice: Sound, Technology, and Participation in Modern Vedic Ritual.? Journal of South Asian History and Culture 8.4: 560-578. DOI:10.1080/19472498.2017.1371505

		?Vedic Oral Tradition.? Oxford Bibliographies Online: Hinduism. Ed. Tracey Coleman. New York: Oxford University Press. DOI:10.1093/OBO/9780195399318-0184 

2018		?Digital Guru: Embodiment, Technology, and the Transmission of Traditional Knowledge in Kerala.? Asian Ethnology 77.1-2: 3-31. 

The Oxford bibliography cited above includes annotations of work by other scholars that may be relevant?including several mentioned by Tim a few weeks back. I?d also highly recommend the following piece, which takes a look at Vedic revivals in Kerala in the decades following Staal?s seminal research:

Mahadevan, T. P., and Frits Staal. ?The Turning Point in a Living Tradition: Somaya?gam 2003.? In Indische Kultur im Kontext: Rituale, Texte und Ideen aus Indien und der Welt; Festschrift f?r Klaus Mylius. Edited by Lars G?hler, 365?389. Beitr?ge zur Indologie 40. Wiesbaden, Germany: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. 

Yours,
Finnian
