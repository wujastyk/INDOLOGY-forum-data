Message-ID: <CA+4Bw=C9tB4YQWprXrGPbG_+LKtoczYGnhTGeF8sFkA740ERKg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm happy to share with you the link to a volume on colophons across pothi
manuscript cultures that I've had the pleasure of coediting together with
Nalini Balbir:

https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110795271/html#contents

The publication is open-access as all volumes in the series Studies in
Manuscript Cultures since 2016.

I hope it will be of interest to some of you.

Season's greetings and Merry Christmas,
Giovanni
