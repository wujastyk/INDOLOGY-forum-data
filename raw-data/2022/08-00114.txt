Subject: [INDOLOGY] Two pages of book needed.
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_sLS6TsjSdAgmT31Gwan6mpnskiC1+TZtFSgs=3K7uVw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I need pages 143 and 144 of Paul Courtrightt's Ganesa: Lord of Obstacles
and Lord of Beginnings.  If someone could copy and send these pages to me,
I'd greatly appreciate it.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
