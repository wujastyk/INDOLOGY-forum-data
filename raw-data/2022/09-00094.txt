There is an article in the journal "Worldviews" by the same authors:
Apffel-Marglin, F., & Jean, J. A. (2020). Weaving the Body and the 
Cosmos, in: Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 24(3), 
245-284. doi: <https://doi.org/10.1163/15685357-02402001>

Maybe this is what you are looking for.

Hope it helps
