Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzc31n9m+EU=Sj_Whxov42s7BwHAre873gKByG-wED7gaA@mail.gmail.com>

This question occurred to me recently. Does the massive flooding that
Pakistan recently experienced give us some possibilities about the demise
of the Indus Civilization? Are there any indications of such massive floods
in Indus archaeology? I would appreciate any suggestions for reading on
this topic. Best regards,
