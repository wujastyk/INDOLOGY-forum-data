Dear Westin,

Please see pp. 421-430 in Harunaga Isaacson & Francesco Sferra. 2014. *The
Sekanirde?a of Maitreyan?tha (Advayavajra) with the Sekanirde?apa?jik? of
R?map?la. Critical Edition of the Sanskrit and Tibetan Texts with English
Translation and Reproductions of the MSS*. Manuscripta Buddhica 2. Hamburg:
Asien-Afrika-Institut, Universit?t Hamburg & Napoli: Universit? degli studi
di Napoli ?L?Orientale?.

These pages contain a re-edition, translation, and a reproduction of the
ms. (Kaiser Library 142, b/w but very legible).

Best wishes,
Peter
