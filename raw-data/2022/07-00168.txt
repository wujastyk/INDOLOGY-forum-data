Dear Oliver

Congratulations.

While I am sure that this is widely known,  I remember now decades ago
Stanely Insler showing me his heavily annotated copy of Bloomfield. I have
no idea what happened to this  (I recall it as having been rebound in two
volumes, but perhaps this is a faulty memory) but it would doubtless be
very valuable if his notes could somehow be preserved.

Certainly his students know more.
