Oliver,

I?d like to add a bit to Harry?s account. The pdf document properties indicate it was created May 8, 2006 by Peter Freund. This is most likely the same Peter Freund on staff at the Maharishi International University library (library at miu.edu <http://library at miu.edu/>).

QuarkXpress is publishing software.  When I download the file, it downloads as a pdf but when I look at the properties, the fonts in the file are embedded Type 1 postscript fonts.

Since the fonts aren't unicode fonts, and the names of the fonts are disguised,  the only thing I can think of is to make a jpeg of each page and enter it into SanskritCR  https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/ <https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/> and then manually correct the errors.
