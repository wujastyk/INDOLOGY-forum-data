Subject: [INDOLOGY] Velankar's Prosodial Practice of Sanskrit Poets
Message-ID: <CAETY2G2vBxRqg3MueEuhoYk6ds3C_cNqVFPd7i0X-rmNqLQ0zg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Does anyone happen to have a pdf of Prosodial Practice of Sanskrit Poets by
Velankar? I've attempted to get it from

https://southasiacommons.net/artifacts/2361293/journal-of-the-bombay-branch-of-the-royal-asiatic-society-new-series-1948-1949/3369940/

but have not succeeded.

Thanks in advance.

All the Best,
Victor
