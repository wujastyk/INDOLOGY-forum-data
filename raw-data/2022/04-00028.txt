Abstract
If two rules are simultaneously applicable at a given step in a P??inian
derivation, which of the two should be applied? Put differently, in the
event of a ?conflict? between the two rules, which rule wins? In the
A???dhy?y?, P??ini has taught only one metarule, namely, 1.4.2 viprati?edhe
para? k?ryam, to address this problem. Traditional scholars interpret it as
follows: ?in the event of a conflict between two rules of equal strength,
the rule that comes later in the serial order of the A???dhy?y?, wins.?
P??in?yas claim that if one rule is nitya, and its simultaneously
applicable counterpart is anitya, or if one is antara?ga and the other
bahira?ga, or if one is an apav?da (exception) and the other the utsarga
(general rule), then the two rules are not equally strong and consequently,
we cannot use 1.4.2 to resolve the conflict between them. The nitya,
antara?ga and apav?da rules are stronger than their respective counterparts
and thus win against them. But this system of conflict resolution is far
from perfect: the tradition has had to write numerous additional metarules
to account for umpteen exceptions. In this thesis, I propose my own
solution to the problem of rule conflict which I have developed by relying
exclusively on P??ini?s A???dhy?y?. I replace the aforementioned
traditional categories of rule conflict with a new classification, based on
whether the two rules are applicable to the same operand (Same Operand
Interaction, SOI), or to two different operands (Different Operand
Interaction, DOI). I argue that, in case of SOI, the more specific i.e.,
the ?exception? rule, wins. Additionally, I develop a systematic method for
the identification of the ?more specific? rule ? based on P??ini?s style of
rule composition. I also argue that, in order to deal with DOI, P??ini has
composed 1.4.2, which I interpret as follows: ?in case of DOI
(viprati?edha), the right-hand side (para) operation (k?rya) prevails.? I
support my conclusions with both textual and derivational evidence. I also
discuss my interpretation of certain metarules teaching substitution and
augmentation, the concept of a?ga, and the asiddha and asiddhavat rules and
expound on not only their interaction with 1.4.2 but also their influence
on the overall functioning of the P??inian machine.
