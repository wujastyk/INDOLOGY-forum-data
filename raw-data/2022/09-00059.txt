Greetings!
I need help identifying one Matsya S?kta, said to be a work of tantra which
consists in a conversation between ?iva and Parvat?. I have found a
reference to the work in the Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts
Asiatic Society (Vol 08 Part 02) where it says that it  "deals with the
details of the worship of T?r?."
   Any help as to where this has been published (or any other info) would
be appreciated.
Sincerely,
Tim
