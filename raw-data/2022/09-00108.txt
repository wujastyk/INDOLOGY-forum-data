Subject: [INDOLOGY] Affiliations for Fulbright
Message-ID: <CAP_RTBB5ubVuNPYWLNW_S79MZjXCB=8mWh1x+zPjCK=HxSJnqw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I have a fantastic undergrad student in her final year here at Brown,
Catherine Nelli, who is applying for a post-bac Fullbright to work in India
on her project examining French colonial reception of Sanskrit texts
juxtaposed to contemporaneous reception recorded in Sanskrit and Bangla.
She is hoping to establish institutional affiliations at Jadavpur and
Pondicherry, but has faced some difficulty in getting responses from
general department email addresses there. If anyone can suggest a personal
contact at either university who might be able to help her establish an
affiliation to strengthen her application, please email either me and/or
her (catherine_nelli at brown.edu) off-list.

Thanks,
Dave
