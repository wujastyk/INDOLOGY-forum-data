From what I can tell, he does not mention the Sanskrit inscription but he does discuss numerous other South Asian discoveries at Berenike, including a beautiful Buddha statue at 47:00, a South Asian textile resembling an Ajanta mural at 26:50, South Asian beads at 28:00, and more.

There's a video available but I have always found the Gandh?ra Connections website to be very finicky and have not been able to get it to play on my computer but only on my phone.

I present an exciting discovery - the first ever Sanskrit inscription found in Egypt, dated in the reign of Roman Emperor Philip 'the Arab'! It is a dedicatory inscription left by a Kshatriya named Vasula, and undoubtedly of a Buddhist nature as indicated by its colophon. Thanks again to Steve Sidebotham and Team Berenike!"
