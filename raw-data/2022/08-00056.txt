Subject: [INDOLOGY] Announcing Karl H. Potter Memorial Lecture Series on the
 problem of 'Other Minds' - II
Message-ID: <CAJz4T_4kEMH-4Y6_O5EwftcA5FV3DMGpdG4fr=FjAaDffmnpCg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am happy to announce the continuation of the lecture series on the
problem of the *Other Minds* that I organized last year. It seemed that we
were not able to cover all the nuances of the problem. Hence I decided to
continue with the series this year as well. Please see the enclosed poster
for more details on the speakers and their lecture titles.

The individual zoom link will be shared a day before the scheduled lecture
with the registered participants. Please register using the link

Thanks.
