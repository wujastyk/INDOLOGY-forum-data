Dear all,

The following courses might be of interest to anyone who has students
interested in learning Sanskrit, Pali or Hindi, but whose institution does
not offer instruction in those languages:

https://www.yogicstudies.com/language

This coming Tuesday (April 12) from 1:30-3pm Pacific time, we are also
offering an online Open House with all course conveners and instructors. To
hear more about the classes and ask all your questions, join the Zoom
meeting with the following link: https://bit.ly/3DQ3BJr.

This is the third year Yogic Studies is offering Introductory Sanskrit, and
the third time I am teaching for them. I have approached my classes there
in the same way and with the same expectations that I taught my Sanskrit
courses at Cornell. Pali and Hindi were added this year due to the great
demand from students.

All classes are reasonably priced, and students in financial hardship can
apply for scholarships and reduced fees.

Any questions, please simply ask me.

All my best,
     Antonia
