I do not have at hand Stephanie Jamison?s book "The ravenous hyenas and the wounded sun: Myth and ritual in ancient India?, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1991 (xxi, 336 pp.), and though I have read the book, I do not remember how closely the hyenas are described, but surely this is a book to be consulted.

Best wishes, Asko

Indian Mammals Sculptured Through Time", Leiden 2008, p. 427, mentions that the stripped hyena is totally absent from stone sculpture. So, I would be very interested too in any descriptions or depictions of this conspicuous scavenger.
