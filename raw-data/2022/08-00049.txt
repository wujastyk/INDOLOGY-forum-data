(With the usual apologies for possible cross-posting - )

As last year, the course "Kannada-I" (Introductory Kannada) at the LMU 
Munich in the 2022/23 winter term will be held online, which means that 
registration is open also for interested persons who wish to participate 
from outside our university.

For details please see the attached PDF file.
