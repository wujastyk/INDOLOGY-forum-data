Dear Martin, Sonja, and others,

The Navagraha are frequently depicted above the front entrance to most temples in Odisha. They are often carved in stone relief, but I do recall seeing several painted representations. I?ll dig through my fieldwork photo albums and report back with any findings.

Sincerely,
