Dear Ram-Prasad,

I wrote the attached piece entitled ?Conscience is Tradition: Classical Hindu Law and the Ethics of Conservatism? for a recent edited volume on rules and ethics. My JAOS article ?On Atmatusti as a Source of Dharma? also addresses the idea of conscience. Hope these are useful.

Best, Don

A colleague who is not on this list asks whether there is any literature on ?the concept of conscience or its analogues in pre-modern Indian literature?.
Thank you,
