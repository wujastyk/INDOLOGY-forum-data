Thank you both!

 

Yes an alternative spelling of long vowels, such as ?+? instead of ? would be an example. Other situations I could envision why that would happen could be to express even-longer-than-long vowels, like ?+?, or alternative spellings of diphthongs or diphthongs that do not exist Tamil. I have not seen these myself but wanted to check with others.

 

In fact I am interested in any cases where the initial vowel would take any mark - how about pulli on vowels? 

 

I am imagining not everyone is adhering to the Tolka?ppiyam rules, be it either modern usage, transliteration of other languages, or manipravalam texts. 

 

Best regards,

Jan

Dear Jan,

Do you mean ?+?  instead of ? at the initial position?

Best regards.

Dear all,

 

has anyone come across a Tamil orthography where a vowel sign would be attached to an initial vowel, presumably most likely it would be A or AA, e.g. ???

 

Thank you and best regards,

Jan
