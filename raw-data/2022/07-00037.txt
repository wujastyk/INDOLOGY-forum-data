Hello,



I am not sure if there is a ?traditional? etymological explanation, but
here is a back of an envelope note.



The older lexicons [ Amara, Hal?yudha, ???vata etc]. don?t attest these
senses, but Ke?avasv?min and Hemacandra have some relevant entries. I don?t
included later lexicons since their entries are mostly derivative.



*tantra? svar???ravy?p?re tantuv?ne paricchade* // 25cd //

(N?n?rth?r?avasa?k?epa_Ke?avasv?min, Dvyak?arak???a?,
Napu?sakali?g?dhy?ya?, , 25, 0035)



*tantra? svar???racint? sy?d ?v?pas tv aricintanam* / 715 ab /

(Abhidh?nacint?ma?i_Hemacandra, Martyak???a?,  715, 0030)



*ka?aka? dhvajin? tantra? da??o 'n?ka? pat?kin? /*

* var?thin? cam?? cakra? skandhav?ro 'sya tu sthiti?* // 746 //

(Abhidh?nacint?ma?i Hemacandra, Martyak???a?, 746, 0031)



*tantra? siddh?nte r???re ca paracchandapradh?nayo?* // 413ab //

(Anek?rthasa?graha_Hemacandra, Dvisvarak???a?, Dvisvarar?nt??, , 413, 1)





If tantra has the meaning of bind ? control ? administrate, as attested in
words such as *svatantra* and *paratantra*, it stands to reason that it
extends to the agent* par excellence* of control and administration i.e.
the state (*r???re ca*). Similarly, the meanings ?matters concerning one?s
territory? i.e. defense (*svar???racint?, svar???ravy?p?ra*), and army
(*ka?aka?
dhvajin?* etc.) seem to be tenable metonyms for *tantra *meaning the
kingdom/state.

Dear Martin,

is the meaning 'army' for tantra (and 'soldier' for tantrin) explainable
on historical or etymological grounds, or is it even explained by
Sanskrit commentators?
