Dear Scholars,

I recall reading a passage in Anandavardhana?s Dhvany-aloka wherein he explains the principle of aucitya, ie propriety, suitability, etc. In his analysis of Mahabharata, he teaches the aucitya principle in this sense: one may change the narrative details of a story in order to produce propriety or suitability of the narration?s rasa, or impact on the reader.

One example of this principle in action might be Kalidasa?s Shakuntala, the details of which differ at times from the Mahabharata?s version of this story.

My questions:

1. Did I get this right?

2. If so, where exactly in the Dhvany-aloka is the aucitya principle taught, and what did I leave out?

Sincere thanks for any help with this,
Howard
