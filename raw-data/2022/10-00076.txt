Dear Harry,

Here is a ma?gala?loka from the /Lak?ma?otsava/ (1450 CE, according to 
the NCC) in upaj?ti metre that might fit the description of what you're 
looking for. I don't know if the text has been edited; this is the 
incipit of manuscript Sanscrit 1228 from the Palmyr Cordier collection 
at the national library of France, copied in 1899 from a manuscript at 
the Sanskrit College of Benares (photo attached). See lines 6-7:

    namo stu dhanva?taraye samastajar?par??ta? katamas savitre ||
    divy??gan?sa?gatayauvana?r?sa?pattid?y?m?tas?dhan? ya? || 3 ||

Maybe it should read samstajvar?* in line 1? But that messes up the metre.

Best,

Charles
