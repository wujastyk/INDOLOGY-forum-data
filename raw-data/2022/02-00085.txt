Hello Martin,

even if a concept with an Arabic-language term is hidden behind that, it is
by no means certain that the author also understood it in Arabic (unless he
was an expert). He could well have associated something Persian with this
wording (t?jikabh???y??!) and made up a vague meaning, which he then simply
translated literally into Sanskrit. Anyway, I would rather understand it as
Karmadh?raya, i.e. as a kind of "subtle sweetness". In any case, it is
striking that saha-mas?da could perhaps conceal a truncated Persian ????
m?zah/m?ze ("taste") as well as a truncated Persian ??? sahl ("soft,
easy"). The Persian experts on this list will be able to judge this
immediately.
Suppose this were possible, the sentence could come to mean that in the
Tajik language, a wording like saha-mas?da (~ ~ "soft taste") is the
equivalent of s?k?ma-sv?du ("subtle sweetness").

So much for my amateurish guesswork.

Best wishes,
Walter
