Dear list members,



Six new Virasaiva searchable e-texts have been added to the Muktabodha
digital library.  Revisions have been done to another 14 Virasaiva texts. The
texts were selected by Dr. Elaine Fisher, and the digitization of the texts
was funded by a fellowship granted to her by Stanford University. The texts
were data-entered by the staff of Muktabodha under the direction of Dr.
Anirban Dash.
