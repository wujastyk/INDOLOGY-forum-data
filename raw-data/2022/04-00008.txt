Subject: [INDOLOGY] Goshima & Noguchi, A Succinct Catalogue
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CerHf_eF9Uzxg0+MdXnE0fMAPJ6jrcQm6C0HkTis48N4A@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have a scan of the following catalogue, by chance?  It's #0522
in Biswas:

 *A succinct catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts in the possession of the
Faculty of Letters, Kyoto University*
compiled by Kiyotaka Goshima and Keiya Noguchi. -- Society for Indic and
Buddhistic Studies, Kyoto University, 1983.

If not, I'll order it on inter-library loan.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
