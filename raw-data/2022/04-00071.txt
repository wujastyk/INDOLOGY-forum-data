 In looking more closely at the lettering based on the comments here, I'd say it almost certainly seems to be showing ?tmatattvam.
The word is found in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam 5.5.5 and according to this site, also in the Upanishads: 
http://sanskrit.segal.net.br/en/mw?id=23512#23512which translates it as "the true nature of the soul or of the supreme spirit S3vetUp."
Gavin Flood -- is he on this list? -- talks about it in The Concept of Mind in Hindu Tantrism which can be found as a pdf via Google.
So it seems to be a consistent representation of a tantric yantra and mantra associated with ?tmatattvam.

The appeal of such a tattoo to a young seeker of Indian wisdom is clear.

Best,
Dean

 Dear Colleagues
Thank you very much for all your helpful replies, which I have forwarded to Jackie Hirst.?
Most suggestions have centred round the idea that the characters were an attempt to write the mah?v?kya tat tvam asi, but there is also the possibility that it is ?tmatattvam, which seems closer to the lettering we have, though perhaps less likely to be known by a non-specialist. If it is the former, it seems a very good message for the young man to have left to his family.?
Again, many thanks.

Dear indology list
Could you please advise Dr Jackie Hirst about the tattoo design shown in the attached picture??
She says: ?It?is a sketch, now in the possession of a father, that was found in the effects of his son, a young man who died tragically recently, and the family are keen to know what it means. He was interested in the Upani?ads and the?Bhagavad G?t??amongst other things and frequently sketched lotuses. Would anyone be able to shed more light on this as a particular (basic indication of a)?yantra?and/or on the particular (mainly n?gar?) characters which do not seem to make sense as a word/words - could they be (an attempt to indicate) specific individual seed?mantras? or?? If anyone has any further ideas, and how to convey them sensitively to the family, please reply to the list and/or to Jackie direct (jacqueline.hirst at manchester.ac.uk?- Honorary Research Fellow South Asian Studies).? With many thanks.'
Below is a Dropbox link to the design in question.?It?s shared with the permission of the family.
