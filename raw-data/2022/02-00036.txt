 Thanks to everyone for replying. Yes, Burrow sounds right.
Madhav, could you point me to your own work on this, please?

I had read somewhere that there are two dialects of Sanskrit that tend to use either the 'r' sound or the 'l' sound and that they appear to be geographically separated.

Can anyone provide me with more information about this?
Best,
Dean
