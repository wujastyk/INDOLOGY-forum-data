 Dear Dean,
While "wolf warriors" are news to me (the wolf is a negative sign of anxiety or danger), if you look at Diwakar Acharya's "How to Behave Like a Bull," the paper argues that the emulation (and I personally would say *impersonation*) of Indra as an unruly bull was an ancient Vedic practice, elements of which survive in the P??upatas?tras. I am happy to send a pdf of this excellent paper.
Best,Caley?

I was watching a video about berserkers inspired by the new movie The Northman and they mentioned that not only were there Viking bear warriors but there were also wolf warriors as shown in the movie. The video said that these wolf warriors are widely found among many of the early Indo-Europeans including in the Vedas.
Can anyone point me to sources about Vedic wolf warriors?
Best,
Dean
