Subject: [INDOLOGY] Two PDF Requests - Horstmann and Kiehnle
Message-ID: <CANJQKUPm+qw=Ppi4TUg6h1XJJYta9sKEyjG0w509OtoWnQb9nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Indologists,

I am looking for two PDFs -- one article and one book. Please see below...

Horstmann, Monika. ?The Emergence of the N?thyog? Order in the Light of
> Vernacular Sources.? *International Journal of Tantric Studies* 10, no. 1
> (2014).


I found a URL for Horstmann's article (
http://asiatica.org/ijts/10-1/emergence-nathyogi-order-light-vernacular-sources
), but the PayPal links on the page seem to be broken and I cannot access
the full article. WorldCat requests through my library have gone unanswered.

Kiehnle, Catharina. *Songs on Yoga: Texts and Teachings of the Mah?r???rian
> N?ths: J??ndev Studies I and II*. Stuttgart: Steiner, 1997.


I already own a hard copy of Kiehnle?s two-volume set back in the USA, but
I am currently conducting research in Nepal and international shipping
costs are too expensive. If anyone has scanned a soft copy I would be
greatly appreciative. NOTE: At present, I only need a PDF of the first
volume (ie. *Songs on Yoga*), not the second volume.

Thank you.


*Sincerely,*

*Westin Harris*
