Subject: [INDOLOGY] hyenas
Message-ID: <CA+XoKzV4LfBVsKWAVxqMaU-y5FtqH=Gwji0hGZ57MqBZpdwSpg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List members,

Can anyone point me to sources that describe hyenas (tarak?u) in detail or
contain the word yuyukkhura/k?udravy?ghra? Are there any studies about the
depictions of striped hyenas?

Kind regards,
P?ter Sz?ler
