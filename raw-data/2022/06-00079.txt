Dear list members,


Prof. Walter Slaje very kindly pointed at a different meaning of sa?+bh?.
With his permission, I am sharing his message:


I think it is a passive-infinitive construction, with *sa?bh?vita* taking
> the position normally expressed by ?*?ak*, etc: ~ *?akyate bhavitum*, *?akya?
> bhavitum* = "it is possible, it can be".
> *sa?*-?*bh?* expresses possibility (like ?*?ak*), so *sa?bh?vita* as a
> participle may form part of a passive construction as well. Thus, *nir?k?itu?
> na sambh?vita?* would mean "he cannot be seen," literally, ?he is
> impossible to be seen?.


The improved translation would be something like: He could not even be
seen, forget about being made love to.

My question with regard to rantum as the subject of ?st?m is still open.

With best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
