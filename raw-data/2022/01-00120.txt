In the South Indian languages (including Marathi), the word  ????? (p?jya)
is used to mean zero, nothingness. Is there any evidence of such usage in
Sanskrit texts?

I notice that Marathi dictionaries also give a similar meaning:

????? *p?jya* ??. ? ?????; ????.'?????????? ???????? ?????.' [??.]
(Date, Yasavanta Ramakrshna. Maharashtra ?abdakosa)

My question is whether such usage is limited only to the South Indian
languages or is it found in other languages too. It would be interesting if
there are Sanskrit, Prakrit or Pali texts with such usage.

Thanks,
Suresh.
