Dear All,
Thank you all who have reacted with precious references to passages
relevant to what is perhaps a kind of "radiance of peace" concept,
expressed briefly in Yoga-s?tra 2.35, ??????????????????, ??????????
????????? ?
It seems that only the extensive passages in the R?m?ya?a Kakawin to which
Andrea Acri referred extends the concept explicitly to human society.
I am grateful for the references to the Mah?bh?rata, ??kuntalop?khy?na
(famously elaborated also by K?lid?sa), and the Telugu commentary on it.
Also the reference to the Caitanya-carit?m?ta in Sanskritic Bengali bring
us beyond the scope of Sanskrit literature in the strict sense of the word.
The reference to A?vagho?a?s Saundar?nanda I find important because it
concerns the legendary sage Kapila, known as one of the founders of the
S??khya system of philosophy (as I have argued, S??khya was originally more
a movement, partly in protest to Vedic ritualism, and became a
philosophical system afterwards).
The scene described in this reference is almost a S??khya illustration of
the concept (later on?) formulated in YS 2.35.
One part of a similar formula is perhaps found in the sa?ny?sa-vidhi
attributed to a certain Kapila,  ???? ???????????? ?????? ??????
?(Baudh?yana-G?hya-?e?a-S?tra 4.16.4).
The other part remains here apparently unexpressed, namely: the expectation
that this declaration will lead to ????????? and to wild animals etc. to
provide, reciprocatively, abhayam to the ascetic (and, near the ascetic, to
each other).
A very similar or rather parallel concept, expressed in different terms, is
found, in my view, in the maitr? and maitr?-bh?van? of Buddhism, as
discussed by Lambert Schmithausen in his *Maitr? and Magic : Aspects of the
Buddhist Attitude Toward the Dangerous in Nature*, Vienna, 1997.
As we know that nonviolence was and is an important religious duty in
JAINISM it would be interesting to know whether in that context, too, a
concept of a "radiance of peace" was known or developed...
With best wishes to all,
