Dear Colleagues,
as there are still a few places available, I wanted to send this reminder.
We invite applications for our online intensive course on Classical  
Kannada from May 9th until 13th 2022, conducted by Prof. B.A. Viveka  
Rai at the Chair of Indology, W?rzburg University:

This course focusses on Vachanas. After an introduction into classical  
Kannada, selected Vachanas of Veerashaiva poets of the 12th century  
will be read and studied. Participants are expected to possess  
knowledge of fundamental grammar and the Kannada script before  
attending the course.

Prof. Dr. B.A. Viveka Rai is a retired professor of Kannada Literature  
and Folklore at the University of Mangalore. Since 2010, he is a  
regular guest professor at the Chair of Indology, University of  
W?rzburg, teaching modern and classical Kannada, as well as courses on  
the culture and literature of Karnataka.

The fee is 50 Euro for teaching materials. A reduction for students  
and unemployed persons is possible upon request. Interested persons  
are requested to enclose a short letter of motivation (max. half page)  
until April 25th 2022. For any questions and for registration please  
write to Anna Aurelia Esposito (anna.esposito at uni-wuerzburg.de).

We would be grateful if you could widely circulate this call for applications.

Best regards,
Anna Aurelia Esposito
