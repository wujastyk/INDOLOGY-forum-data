Subject: [INDOLOGY] Missing page of Bharadvajavrttibhasya of Gangadhara
 Kaviratna Kaviraja
Message-ID: <CAGbCkeU40=xpV98+AEyHV7ouFjKoetb7rMPRcg-Q7iP0uiFM8A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Scholars,

Might someone help me get the scan of p. 2 of the Bharadvajavrttibhasya of
Gangadhara Kaviratna Kaviraja on Vaisesikasutra, which covers Sutra 2
partially and Sutra 3 entirely? The otherwise complete text of the same is
available as a PDF here:

https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.409674

Thanks in advance and apologies for cross-posting.

Best regards,
Sudipta Munsi
