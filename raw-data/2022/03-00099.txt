Duan Qing, Professor of Indo-Iranian Studies and Boya Chair Professor of Peking University, passed away on Saturday, March 26, 2022, at Peking University First Hospital at the age of 68. A preeminent scholar and educator, Professor Duan devoted her career to the research and teaching of Sanskrit, Pali, Khotanese, G?ndh?r?, among other ancient languages.

Born in Beijing in May 1953, Professor Duan studied German as an undergraduate at Peking University from 1971 to 1974. In 1982, she completed her Master?s degree in Indology under the guidance of Professors Ji Xianlin ??? and Jiang Zhongxin ???. She pursued her doctoral studies at the University of Hamburg, Germany, where she majored in Middle Iranian Studies with Professor R. E. Emmerick as her advisor. She also studied Indology and Tibetology as secondary fields under Professors L. Schmithausen and A. Wezler.

Professor Duan was a prolific writer. She authored several monographs in Chinese and German, including Das Khotanische Aparimit?yu?s?tra (1986), Bonini yufa rumen ???????

Professor Duan was an inspiring teacher and a generous mentor to her students, colleagues, and countless others. Apart from being a highly accomplished scholar, she was also a talented dancer, an intrepid traveler, and an avid gourmet. Professor Duan Qing?s passing is a huge loss to all of us. She will be dearly missed and fondly remembered by her family, friends, and colleagues around the world.
