Subject: [INDOLOGY] Access to Sanskrit manuscripts in the Tibet Museum, Lhasa
Message-ID: <CAPAZeka1ZugXVcjypWGePy2B8iOUcLaEOb7HuECJb2e3ASxkCg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Is there any access to reproductions of the Sanskrit manuscripts now
preserved in the Tibet Museum in Lhasa?

A catalogue compiled in 1985 by Wang Sen lists 259 such manuscripts. This
catalogue had been almost impossible to find until Haiyan Hu-von Hin?ber
reproduced it as an appendix to an article published in 2006, which I have
posted here:
http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/Sanskrit-Manuscripts-once-kept-in-the-Palace-of-Culture.pdf
.

Many of these manuscripts had been described earlier by R?hula S??k?ty?yana in
three articles, which I have posted here: http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/279/.

In particular, I am seeking scans or other reproductions of a manuscript or
manuscripts of the K?lacakra-tantra.

Thanks and best regards,
