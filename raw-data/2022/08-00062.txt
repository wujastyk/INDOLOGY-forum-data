The ?Emerging Scholars in Jain Studies? event series is co-organized and
co-sponsored by the Departments of Religious Studies at UC Davis and UC
Riverside. We envision this platform as a way for junior scholars working
on Jain materials to share their work with and receive feedback from junior
and senior scholars in the field of Jain studies and the larger academic
and Jain communities. We invite PhD students, postdoctoral fellows,
lecturers, untenured and newly tenured faculty, as well as independent
scholars and curators to deliver talks in this series.
