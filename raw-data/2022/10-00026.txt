Not particularly on its evolution, but in case you haven?t seen it, some
sources are in https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14283-bhujinmol.pdf

 

Thanks,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bhujimol script

 

Dear friends,

 

Might any of you be aware of anything particularly good on the evolution of
the Bhujimol script, used mostly in the Kathmandu Valley.? There are several
examples in the excellent indoskript.org database, but I do not see a way to
search there for just the Bhujimol manuscripts in particular. (Perhaps there
is, in which case I would be delighted to be enlightened about just that.)

 

Your kind advice would be most welcome.

 

best to all,

Matthew
