Dear Colleagues,

Students and well-wishers of Professor Ram Karan Sharma approached the IASS
during the Vancouver WSC in July 2018 to set up this award under the
auspices of the IASS (International Association of Sanskrit Studies).

Professor Sharma sadly passed away in the meantime on 18 December 2018. He
was the President of the IASS from 1994?2006 and one of the Vice Presidents
of the IASS from 2006 till his passing away on 18 December 2018.


The award in his honour was welcomed by all the members of the Board,
Regional Directors and Consultative Committee of the IASS.

Details were announced in the IASS website in August 2018 for the award, to
be coupled with each World Sanskrit Conference. Since the WSC in Canberra
had to be postponed because of the troubled Covid time, it is being
announced again.

One of the he conditions for the award includes:
"In the five years previous to the next WSC applicants 1) shall have
received a PhD and 2) shall have published journal articles and/or
published a book in the area(s) mentioned above. Theses and publications in
English only are eligible for consideration."

and the winner to be announced soon after the Canberra WSC in January 2023.
