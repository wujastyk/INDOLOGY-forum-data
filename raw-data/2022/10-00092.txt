Perhaps the most complete list of Vi?i???dvaita commentaries on the Upani?ads is in the 20th volume of the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies (Vi?i???dvaita Ved?nta, ed. by Stephen H. Phillpis and Karl H. Potter, Motilal Banarsidass, 2017). It is useful that each entry indicates where the text was published (or whether it exists only in manuscript). Modern authors (from the 20th century) are also included.

The former particularly has an intermittent commentarial tradition after Ved?nta De?ika wrote a commentary on it. Finally, we seem to have virtually no Upani?adic commentaries extant between the 17th-20th centuries until Uttam?r Swami who was one of the last living polymaths of the Va?akalai tradition, as far as I am aware. But I am always happy to be enlightened further on this interesting issue.
