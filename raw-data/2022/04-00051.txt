Dear list members,

I have a related question. In the introduction to the soon to be finished edition of Vidhiviveka, Ny?yaka?ik?, etc., I include an image each from two mss of Ny?yaka?ik? in the Nepal National Archives collection (filmed by the Nepal German project). In an appendix, I include details of six folios to illustrate the reading of a word in one of these manuscripts. I expect the edition to appear as a printed book (not online). I scanned the microfilms, which I received in 1978 and 1980, about ten years ago for personal use in completing the edition. Do I have any legal obligation to get permission from the Nepal National Archives for use of this selection of images, or is this considered a fair use of copyrighted materials? I am of course gratefully identifying the source.

Some years ago while I was working at BDRC I had attempted to forge some agreement to make the NGMPP images available online. For example, in Hamburg there is an intranet with many of these images available to research staff (I'm not sure if this is the case still). During a trip there, I had a meeting about this where I laid out my understanding of copyright law, which I understand just as Jonathan and Stefan have already explained, and was met with polite but firm disagreement where I was told that it would be absolutely impossible to make the images publicly available. I looked into the situation with the National Archives in Nepal and, as Prof. Michaels has suggested, they do not wish for these images to be freely available. I was told that this may hypothetically change at some point, but at least five or so years ago it was impossible. Good luck!

(I'm not sure if this is by international copyright law or just by Indian copyright law) and I'm wondering if it is the same case for photographs/microfilm. I.e. copyright expires 50 or 75 years after the photograph was taken.

The reason ist the same as Jonathan mentioned: they want to make money. The situation is terribly complicated and many colleagues have suffered from it. However, you can always ask for a permission to publish the copies, and the South Asia Institute branch office of Heidelberg University in Patan is ready to give you assistance: see here: https://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/kathmandu/ <https://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/kathmandu/>

And if so, when.  Or do the agreements signed between the project and the Nepal government supercede this, and the Nepal government has copyright for the images forever.
