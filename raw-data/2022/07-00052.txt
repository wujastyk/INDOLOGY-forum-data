Dear colleagues,

I don't suppose anyone has a pdf of G. Dum?zil's 1929 book

*Le Probl?me des Centaures. ?tude de mythologie compar?e Indo-Europ?ene*

that they're willing to share?

Many of his books are available on archive.org, but not this one it seems.
I'd be very grateful if anyone can help.

Many thanks!

Robert
