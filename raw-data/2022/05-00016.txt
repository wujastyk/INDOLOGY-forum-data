Subject: [INDOLOGY] Call for applications for FWO-Odysseus projects
Message-ID: <AM9P195MB12977279B7E4223C5EA9BDE2B6C59@AM9P195MB1297.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear colleagues,

I would like to spread the word on the Odysseus funding scheme of the Flemish government, set up to attract international scholars to Flemish (Belgian) universities to host them for developing their own research and research group. This scheme comes with a tenure track professorship position.
I paste the link to the official regulations below.
Applications only go through nominations by the universities. If you are interested in applying for a project that would fit our research group (South Asia Network Ghent), please get in touch with us asap (definitely before the end of June) with a proposal abstract. Also, feel free to forward this to anyone who you think may be interested.
