From the book Interpreting across Boundaries<https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400859276/html>?

I would also be grateful for any other references you may have to the teaching and study of Advaita-Ved?nta (or any other "orthodox" form of Ved?nta, for that matter) among "scheduled castes" in modern or pre-modern times.

with thanks as always,
Matthew
