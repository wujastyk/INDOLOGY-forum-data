Subject: [INDOLOGY] Journals publishing epigraphs currently
Message-ID: <CADSGPzVZoBXEGuqVpoiDfYFrid10v4djjme4fcd=gU=OFwowEg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear scholars,

I would appreciate if any of the members can point me towards journals
which currently publish epigraphs of India. Earlier journals like Indian
Antiquary and Epigraphica Indica seem discontinued.

With regards,
Dhaval
