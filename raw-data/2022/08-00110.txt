Introductory Sanskrit Ia
US101a.
US101--102 aim to provide a linguistically rich study of the world's most fascinating language equivalent to a first-year university course. Exercises introduce the extensive literature, profound philosophy and rich mythology of ancient India which has and continues to influence over a quarter of the world?s population today. Live weekly meetings are supplemented by recorded lectures with slide presentations that introduce each topic. Homework exercises use a uniquely designed pleasant interactive Web-based platform that provides vocabulary and reference material at one's fingertips and immediate feedback thereby enriching the students knowledge with each item and eliminating doubt and frustration. 
US101a is the first of four quarters of ten weeks each. This quarter presents a rich introduction to the Devan?gar? script and Sanskrit phonology, and introduces the intricate and highly organized structure of the grammar, including the present and imperfect tenses of verbs and the declension of a-stem nouns and adjectives. The quarter culminates in the reading of a short story.

Introduction to Digital Philology
UT101
With the current transition of knowledge transmission from the printed to the digital medium, it is essential that students of Sanskrit, as students of every discipline, learn to use the technologies of this new medium. While the written manuscript and the printed book dominated as the principal media of knowledge transmission it was essential for students to learn how to read and write and to use pen and paper, and the facilities that help to navigate books such as tables of contents, alphabetical indices, and page numbers. In the digital age now there are new facilities to navigate knowledge in the digital medium: Web-pages, links, and search interfaces. Yet the digital medium offers many more complex methods of discovering knowledge relevant to one?s interests, such as automated information retrieval and information extraction. Conversely, the facilities available for interlinking resources and the expectations of users now in the digital age demand greater attention to various facets of the preparation of knowledge for distribution. The course offered here prepares students to make such preparations for Sanskrit.
