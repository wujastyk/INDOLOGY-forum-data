Indology list archive is a valuable repository of knowledge. But the lack of proper search facility makes the information as good as lost and we have to repeat questions/discussions that are already in the archive. See https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/2015-July/041594.html. If a good search feature is enabled, all the past discussions will become accessible.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] iti in Sanskrit

 

V.S. Rajam?s book is an essential one for students of classical Tamil, covering syntax, meter, morphology, etc. What I meant is that to my knowledge no one has made a substantial study of every use of e? in Sangam literature. Such a study might include uses of iti in early Sanskrit. For example, in modern Tamil we often find ?? e???l, ?If you ask why,? which corresponds exactly to Sanskrit "kuta iti cet.? One wonders how old this usage is in both languages. George Hart

Dear List Members,

/// I am sure many have noted that in Tamil, the word e?, which has equivalents in other Dravidian languages (an in Telugu, for example), is far more productive than Sanskrit iti.

It would be interesting to analyze the uses of e? in Sangam literature ? I?m not sure anyone has done this. /// 

 

Just to kindle your memory ? 

 

Please look into my book ?A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry, V.S. Rajam, American Philosophical Society, 1992? 

 

Thanks and regards,

V.S. Rajam

Of course, the use of this construction could be an areal phenomenon ? it is not necessarily true that its presence in early Sanskrit is due to Dravidian, though I think it is highly likely, given its richness in Dravidian languages.

I do not know if the question was about iti as an areal phenomenon. If so, see F.B.J. Kuiper, "The Genesis of a Linguistic Area", IIJ 1968, where, if I remember well, he compares Skt iti with Tamil e??u.

If I remember correctly, the possibility of the "iti" constructions being an areal phenomena have been discussed  for many decades. The best person to provide information regarding this topic may be Hans Hock. I will see if I can locate any of these older publications.

See the many explanations of ?iti? in Gary Tubb and Emery Boose?s book ?Scholastic Sanskrit?.
