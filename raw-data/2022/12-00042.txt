Dear Diego, dear Indology List members,

The gandhari.org site and the Journal of Gandh?ran Buddhist Texts (JGBT) articles on the Gandh?ran Buddhist Texts (GBT) site are entirely complementary. Gandhari.org is an invaluable resource for Gandhari scholars, whilst the GBT site is the published output of a collaboration platform that embeds scholarly editions within framing content, with translation, Sanskrit ch?y?, glossary, structural analysis and paleography report aimed at engaging a wider audience, such as those with command of Sanskrit and those interested in Buddhist Studies and Gandharan Studies more broadly.

Best wishes

JGBT Management

  Dear all,

  I congratulate the authors on this useful publication, but would like to add a small mini op-ed of sorts.
  Young and small as the field of Gandh?ran studies is, it has been crucial for indology and buddhology in the last few years on account of its paradigm-shifting discoveries. Gandh?ra has elicited interest even among a general public in recent years and shows great promise as a field of investigation.
  What exactly is then the point of sprouting many alternate versions of the features that Stefan Baums and Andrew Glass' online repository, gandhari.org<https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/unZEC71R2NTm0zJqqHNWzbG?domain=gandhari.org>, has been offering, to great benefit of our community, already for more than a decade? Certain features in this new presentation of the text such as the ch?y?, the English translation, and the gloss of certain technical terms are extremely useful, but wouldn't the most fruitful course of action be to incorporate these features to the gandhari.org<https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/unZEC71R2NTm0zJqqHNWzbG?domain=gandhari.org> entry (https://gandhari.org/corpus/ckm0244<https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/Vc_gC81V0PTjAXKrrTo5shS?domain=gandhari.org>), which has been in place since 2016?
  My point is only an invitation to collegiality and to collaboration. It would be a pity if our collective effort to unveil the rich treasures of Buddhist Gandh?ra was splintered rather than sharpened by our individual initiatives.

  nama?aro karemi,

  Diego
