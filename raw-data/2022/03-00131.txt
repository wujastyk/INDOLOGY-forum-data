The South Asia Center at the University of Washington is happy to announce an upcoming workshop on Old Hindi and its vernaculars led by Purnima Dhavan (History) and Heidi Pauwels (Asian Languages & Literature).

Braj and Beyond: Hindavi Reading Workshop

August 5?6, 2022
University of Washington, Seattle

The South Asia Center at the University of Washington, Seattle invites submissions for a workshop in the scholarship of Old Hindi and its associated vernaculars. This is a rare opportunity for scholars to read together texts related to their research in the company of other experts in order to widen their inter-disciplinary engagements with pre-modern primary source texts. Scholars are invited to submit 500-word abstracts describing the primary text they would like to discuss in the workshop. Each session will focus on helping the presenter polish a short translation of the piece they have selected for the workshop. This in-person workshop will take place in Seattle on August 5?6, 2022. Housing will be provided, and travel reimbursements up to $500 will be provided to all presenters selected for the workshop.

The selected texts may be in Braj, Awadhi, Khari Boli, Rajasthani, Purbia, Dakhani, Rekhta, or Punjabi and associated vernaculars. The selected texts need not be literary or religious works. We welcome submissions that include historical works, correspondence, inscriptions, and other textual forms as well. Submissions in any script are welcome, but authors may be asked to provide a Romanized text to aid participants not familiar with lesser-known scripts. Please contact Prof. Purnima Dhavan<https://history.washington.edu/people/purnima-dhavan> (pdhavan at uw.edu<mailto:pdhavan at uw.edu>) and Heidi Pauwels<https://asian.washington.edu/people/heidi-pauwels> (hpauwels at uw.edu<mailto:hpauwels at uw.edu>) with inquiries.

The application deadline is May 15, 2022.
