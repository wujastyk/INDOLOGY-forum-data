Thank you, Robert.

If it is useful for the technicians, Windows Defender reports the malware attached to the ganakastadhyayi software as ?trickbotsc!bit,? whatever that is.

Hopefully all is good in my side, I switched to avast and seem to be virus free now.

Best wishes
Aleksandar

@Aleksandar:

I'm extremely sorry about the virus attack. This is a serious problem in India: I recall how once my computer returned from a computer repair shop ? and then was infected beyond usability. Since then I have stopped using Windows and have been a happy user of Mac and Linux (my latest book was layouted using the Linux Mint distribution. It has excellent support for Indian scripts).

But that is of little help for those among us who, for whatever reason, are not free to choose their operating system ? and for victims of current attacks.

@all:

I have reported the problem to Dr. Shivamurthy Shivacharya. He asked me the following question:

-----
We have two websites:
1) math.taralabalu.in
hosting our news portal
and
2) www.taralabalu.org/panini<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.taralabalu.org%2Fpanini&data=05%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7Cf2b824039c9d42fad51808daea6a6dc8%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C638080040083556918%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=x86lMHrWrlRD2mzO5jE%2BQO5rbOmGrdOmB516XTWyQQM%3D&reserved=0>
hosting our Panini software

Are they getting malware warning in both the websites?
-----

Meanwhile he has had his technicians investigate the site www.taralabalu.org/panini<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.taralabalu.org%2Fpanini&data=05%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7Cf2b824039c9d42fad51808daea6a6dc8%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C638080040083556918%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=x86lMHrWrlRD2mzO5jE%2BQO5rbOmGrdOmB516XTWyQQM%3D&reserved=0> with some two dozen anti-virus programs, and he says the site in itself is clean. They are looking into the other site. (Meanwhile I have forwarded Aleksandar's second message about viruses in the P??ini software to him.)

I got the malware by installing the Panini software mentioned in the note, spent a good part of the morning removing viruses and upgrading my antivirus protection.

Thereby I arrived at a novel interpretation of the matter at hand: With respect to prohibition (of malware), doing something is paramount -- viprati?edhe para? k?ryam.

Yours,
Aleksandar
