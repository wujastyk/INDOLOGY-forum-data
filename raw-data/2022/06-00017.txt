Hi Howard,

Last year in the Mahabharata Seminar at the AAR,? Andrej Babkiewicz of 
the University of Warsaw did a presentation on "Sacred, mundane and 
religious geography of the /Mah?bh?rata" - /about a wonderful project 
funded by the Polish government, on mapping the Mahabharata. I would 
contact him.
