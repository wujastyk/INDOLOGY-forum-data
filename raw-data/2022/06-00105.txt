For references to svaya?vara in the dharma??stras, see Kane's HDh?, vol. II, pt. 1., pp. 523-524 (3rd ed. 1997).
For (a few) Vedic and more other sources (incl. dharma??stars), see Hanns-Peter Schmidt, "To Choose or not to Choose: How Many Forms of Svaya?vara", in Some Wome's Rites and Rights in the Veda, BORI 1987, pp. 76?109.
