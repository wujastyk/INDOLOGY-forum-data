Dear Colleagues,

I would like to bring to your attention two new works from Patrick Olivelle. The first is the third volume of his collected papers, published by Primus Books under the title Collected Essays III: Reading Texts and Narrating History<https://primusbooks.com/ancient/collected-essays-iii-reading-texts-and-narrating-history-by-patrick-olivelle/>. The second is an edition of the Vacanam?l?<https://www.mlbd.com/product/vacanamala-a-sub-commentary-on-visvarupas-commentary-balakrida-on-the-yajnavalkya-dharmasastra/?v=7516fd43adaa> published by MLBD Publications. The Vacanam?l? is a sub-commentary from Kerala on Vi?var?pa?s B?lakr???, itself a commentary on the Y?j?avalkya Dharma??stra.

All best,
Mark McClish
Northwestern University
