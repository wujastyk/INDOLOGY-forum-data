Dear Yuto

It's so good to hear from you!

And thanks for your interest.

Firstly, contrary to your statement, I do actually discuss the issue you
have raised about the karakas. Please see footnote 75 on pg 31 of my
thesis. Contrary to what the tradition says (see joshis essay mentioned
below for details) there is no conflict at all between the rules you
mention. The two labels are never simultaneously applicable and the choice
between the two karakas in question lies entirely with the speaker, as I
say in my thesis too in the aforementioned footnote. (SD Joshi has written
a beautiful piece on this: see pages x and xi of the introduction to his
translation of the karakahnika of the MBH)

And no, it has to be param because it has to agree with karyam ("rhs
operation"). So nominative.

Enjoy your holidays! ?

Best
Rishi
