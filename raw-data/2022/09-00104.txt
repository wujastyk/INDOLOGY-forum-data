>From my understanding (as a non-Sanskritist) as a Tamilian ??
1. The term ?bhagavAn? is used as an epithet to a revered religious guru, personal deity, and such.
2. In Kerala, 'bhagavati? refers to the ?goddess.??2a. In the Earliest Missionary Grammar of Tamil by Henrique Henriques, a Jesuit Missionary, ?we find the term ?pakavati? to refer to the local usage ?goddess.? ?If you can, please see?https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674727236?
3. Here?s what I find in Apte?s translation:?

Dear list members,Firstly happy Navaratri.Secondly I'm wondering what the best way to translate bhagavati and bhagavan would be.? The target audience is a non-specialist non-sanskritist audience.? The contexts are typically where someone is addressing a god or goddess? where the actual name of the god/goddess is also mentioned fairly close . A typical example would be this?gayatr? to annap?r?? .??
bhagavatyai ca vidmahe
m?he?varyai ca dh?mahi
tan no annap?r?? pracoday?t

Thanks,Harry Spier?
