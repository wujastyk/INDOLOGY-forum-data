Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Thanks to those who already responded.

In the meantime I have been able to solve the issue, and I am sharing this in case somebody else might encounter the same problem.

The important thing is not the font (Gandhari Unicode), but the rendering machine ? Easy Unicode. Once that is properly installed it works, even on OS 11.5.2 (?Big Sur?).

All the best,

HHH

I was able to install the Gandhari font files, but can?t get the font to appear in the list of fonts that is accessed from the top tool bar and I can?t seem to access the required rendering machine. Further, I understand that the font is no longer supported.

(I have mainly used the sub- or superscript circle, the subscript ?umlaut? (for the retroflex rhotic of Dravidian), and the nonsyllabicity symbol; but would like to also have access to the full range of diacritics.)
