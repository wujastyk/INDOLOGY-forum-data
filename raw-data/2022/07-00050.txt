Dear List Members,

Please pardon me for posting this query to a broad audience. I need help. 

I?ve been getting alerts from McAfee Total Protection about my computer being in danger, my license with them has expired, etc. etc. I don?t know if it is for real or a marketing strategy or scam. So, I don?t respond to such alerts. Lately, for the past few days YouTube music/food-recipe channels are getting affected; they just freeze unexpectedly. Is it again a marketing game? Did you have any such experience? How do I respond to such annoyance? Please advice. 

Thanks and Regards,
rajam
