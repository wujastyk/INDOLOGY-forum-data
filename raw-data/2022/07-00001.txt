Colleagues,
A math colleague of mine here asked if I could track down this text for him, especially if it had an English translation. I've looked all over, WayBack, everywhere. No luck. And information about the text, which I found both on Wikiwand and the Hindi Wikipedia, is word-for-word the same.

According to that information, the original was in Prakrit by a Digambara Jain called Sarvanandi, which is no longer available, and a Sanskrit translation of that by one Simhasuri is available. The WayBack Machine supposedly has it in the Digital Library of India, but I couldn't find it, even after installing their TIFF reader.

??,
Bob Hueckstedt
