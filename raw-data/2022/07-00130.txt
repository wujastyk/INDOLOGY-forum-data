The interpretation of luk, lup, ?lu as zero elements may require some further thought. In P??ini?s grammar (1.1.60-63) there is a general ?zeroing? process called lopa, in addition to the three specific ?zero? elements luk, lup, ?lu. The two differ from each other as follows: lopa does not delete the grammatical features associated with the zeroed element; luk, lup, and ?lu do. This may raise the question as to which is the ?real? zero element. Although luk, lup, ?lu are named elements, they actually designate just absence or complete deletion. Lopa, by contrast, can be understood as introducing an element that has zero content but has grammatical properties like other, full elements in P??ini?s grammar. From this perspective, then, lopa might be considered to come closer to zero in numbers theory, where questions such as what is 0 x 1 or 1 : 0, questions that are addressed in some of the later mathematical treatises. Perhaps some P??iniyan scholar can through more light on this matter?

I?m not sure whether this adds to the discussion or leads to more confusion.

All the best,

Hans Henrich

Might one say that sunyata may arise where sunya is well understood?

Friends:

Thank you for the many useful responses.

While it is clear that no definite scientific evidence is forthcoming to suggest that the mathematical concept of sunya arose from the Mahayana concept of sunyata, it is difficult to dismiss that the similarity of the two words is accidental.

Sunya can only rise in an ethos where the concept of sunyata is well understood.

Kind regards,
