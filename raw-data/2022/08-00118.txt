You can contact Dr. Vasu Renganathan, who teaches Tamil at Penn, and ask him if he could help. The librarians I used to know must have retired by now.

I was curious to see it, but I don't find any used copies floating around, and according to WorldCat, the only library copy in North America is in UPenn. Would anyone have a soft copy of it?
