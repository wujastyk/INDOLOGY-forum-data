Subject: [INDOLOGY] Jaya with double genitive?
Message-ID: <91f47947-aaf2-dc2e-d551-5edf61508a8d@gmail.com>

In an astrological text of which I so far have only a single manuscript, 
I recently came across an expression which may be in need of emendation 
or may just be an idiom I haven't seen before:

a?vadvayasya madhye ko vijay? lagnabh?ji hore?e |
ya? prathama? h?daye ?bh?t tasya jayo ?nyasya vaktavya? ||

'Out of two horses, which will win? If the ruler of the hour occupies 
the ascendant, the one that first occurred in the [querent's] heart 
should be predicted to win /over the other/ (?).'

It is the double genitive in /tasya jaya? anyasya /that I am uncertain 
about. Can anyone confirm (or deny) that this idiom exists?

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
