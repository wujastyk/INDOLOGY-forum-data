Dear Raja,

Primary sources in Prakrit and Sanskrit are dedicated to the concept of
*naya* in Jain Philosophy:


Shastri, Kailash Chandra (1971):* Davvasabh?vappakasako ?ayacakko by **M??lla
Dhavala*. Varanasi: Bh?rat?ya J??nap??ha Publication.


Jain, Ratancand (translator and commentator) (V?ranirv??a Samvat 2467)
(1940): *?r?mad Devasen?c?ryaviracit? ?l?papaddhati Apara N?ma Drvy?nuyoga
Prave?ik?*. Saharanpur (U.P.): Pr?c?n ?r? Granth?yatan.

I hope this helps.

Best wishes,
Abhishek
