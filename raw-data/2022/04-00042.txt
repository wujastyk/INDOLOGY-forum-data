Subject: [INDOLOGY] NGMCP images and copyright law
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o-bPtDDd9x7OUk7aO9sXtY+yvZ0n9UNgqeKdaoDsLD4eA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
Does anyone know, if according to international copyright law, the
manuscript images of the  NGMCP (Nepal German Manuscript Cataloguing
project) will eventually go into public domain. And if so, when.  Or do the
agreements signed between the project and the Nepal government supercede
this, and the Nepal government has copyright for the images forever.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
