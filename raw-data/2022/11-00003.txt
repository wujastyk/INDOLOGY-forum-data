Next winter finally we fervently hope to be back on schedule (after the 
long COVID break) with the CTWS at the centre of the EFEO in Pondichery.

This 21st seminar will last for two weeks (13th to 24th February), with 
the main text in a double session in the mornings and with various 
sessions to choose from in the afternoons.

The first week will be dedicated to yet another chapter of the 
Cilappatik?ram, namely canto XVII, the ?ycciyar Kuravai, a series of 
devotional songs to K???a, early testimonies to his worship in South India.

The second week we will delve into the realm of didactic poetry for the 
first time in all these years, looking at the Pa?amo?i, one of the more 
popular K??kka?akku anthologies on wordly wisdom.

The whole is planned as a live event, and there will NOT be a hybrid 
option. Everybody with at least a basic knowledge of classical Tamil is 
welcome.

For further questions, contact Eva Wilden (wilden.eva at gmail.com).

Please register with Prerana Patel at the EFEO 
(preranapatel at efeo-pondicherry.org) and note that you will require an S5 
student visa to participate. It will not be possible to participate with 
a tourist visa.
