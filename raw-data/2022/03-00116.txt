Dear Bob and colleagues: 

This is indeed shocking and deeply saddening news. Luis had, for those of us who followed him on as your students at Berkeley, been a generous, inspiring, and unflaggingly encouraging older brother to lean on, learn from, debate with, and look up to, and who handled with seeming ease and grace the various challenges that life would bring. 
I was very much looking forward to seeing him again soon, after many years. But now I may only cling to the memories of our time shared together in your sa?nidhi. 
Thank you for writing such a thoughtful and detailed conspectus of his many endeavours and accomplishments, over and above those that we all know of in the domain of Indology. 

My sincere condolences to his family, and to you and Sally, as well as all of his colleagues in the department. 

with all best wishes,

?
Adheesh Sathaye

It was exactly one week shy of  his 74th birthday.

Prior to turning his attention to the study of classical Indian language, religion, and literature, he had completed a Licentiate in Business Administration at the Universidad Nacional Aut?noma de Mexico in 1974.

He published several books and articles in this field including Tiempo c?clico y eras del mundo en la India (1988), La Maitrayaniya Upanisad: introducc?on, traducci?n y notas (1992) and The Mahabharata and the Yugas: India?s Great Epic Poem and the Hindu System of world Ages (2002). His scholarly articles covered a number of critical issues in vedic, epic, literary, and puranic texts. He was a frequent contributor to the list.

The Universidad Iberoamericana and El Claustro de Sor Juana, all in Mexico City. During his time at Berkeley, he served the campus in a number of ways as a Lecturer and research scholar in the Religious Studies Program, the Center for South Asia Studies, and the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. But it was to the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies that he most fully devoted his outstanding pedagogy, teaching a wide variety of undergraduate courses in Hinduism, Mythology, and the Indian Epics. Indeed, he was in the middle of his spring semester 2022 offering of  ?The Great Epics of India? when, at the end of spring break, he suddenly left us.

> Before devoting himself to the study of Indology, Luis was a significant figure in the Mexican youth countercultural scene  (La Onda)  during the turbulent ?60s especially in the area of rock music. He was instrumental in the launch of the journal Piedra Rodante based on its inspiration, Rolling Stone magazine, and was one of its reviewers and editors. He also served as a rock disc jockey for the UNAM radio station hosting a new daily show ?La Respuesta Est? en el Aire? with  a nod to Bob Dylan. He even ran his own rock music store ?Yoko? where young Mexicans could acquire foreign rock albums.

> Luis was a kindly and beloved and teacher and a generous scholar always ready to help students and his colleagues with his vast knowledge of  Hinduism and its literature. It is difficult to express the depth of our sudden loss and the prospect of imagining our department without his gentle and caring presence. He will be deeply missed by his students, friends and colleagues.
