Prof. Hock is of course quite right. However, perhaps one should add that although figure of Dyaus is already obviously going out of worship  even in the RV, his function as  sky/storm divinity has been largely transferred to Indra in particular, as the latter's worship becomes more central to the vedic religion.  But we must remember that, practically speaking, none of the vedic divinities actually disappears from the textual tradition, as witness e.g. the role of Dyaus in the Mah?bh?rata where he is cursed to be re-born as a mortal and thus becomes the critically important epic figure Pit?maha Bh??ma.

Other deities (Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varu?a, etc.) play a more important role, and in Vedic Prose, Vi??u, as personification of the sacrifice, becomes more important (as well as Rudra), and of course Praj?pati, the ?lord of creatures?.
