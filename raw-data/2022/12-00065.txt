side item replaces its first sound. From these examples, it becomes clear
that in the rules I have listed under group B, *para* is used to mean
?right-hand side? in the context of P??inian derivations.


Let us confirm this by considering some rules which contain both *p?rva*
and *para*. 6.1.84 *eka? p?rvaparayo?* teaches that (in the following
rules) a single sound replaces both the LHS sound and the RHS sound in case
of *sa?hit? *?immediate proximity?. Similarly, 1.1.57 *aca? parasmin
p?rvavidhau* teaches that a substitute for a vowel, if it is conditioned by
an RHS context, is treated like its substituendum with respect to an
operation on an LHS element.


This leads to an important question: if traditional scholars interpreted
*para* as ?RHS item/operation? in so many metarules as shown above, why did
they interpret it as ?the following rule? in 1.4.2?[1] I think this
misunderstanding possibly arose because another metarule, 8.2.1
*p?rvatr?siddham*, uses *p?rva*, the opposite of *para*, to mean ?preceding
rule?. 8.2.1 teaches that from 8.2.1 onwards, a preceding rule treats a
following rule as suspended. This may have led K?ty?yana, the first scholar
to comment upon P??ini?s *s?tra*s, to think that, in *s?tra*s dealing with
relationships between rules such as 8.2.1 and 1.4.2, *p?rva *and *para*
mean preceding rule and following rule respectively. However, upon closer
examination, one realizes that when P??ini wants to indicate that he is
referring to the relationship between preceding and following rules rather
than operands, he adds the affix *traL *to the base: he says *p?rva-tra* in
8.2.1.

I discuss the suffis -tra again in chapter 5. In appendix F, I have listed
all the rules of Group A and Group B.
Best,
Rishi
