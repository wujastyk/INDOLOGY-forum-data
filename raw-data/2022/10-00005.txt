 ?Dear colleagues,

I'm searching for reference to any texts/traditions that suggest how 
long it took Valmiki to compose The Ramayana. The Mahabharata has Vyasa 
compose that text in 3 years, but I haven't found any comparable 
reference to Valmiki's work. I'd be grateful for your thoughts.

Best,
Arti
