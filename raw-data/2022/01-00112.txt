Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devanagari character variants
Message-ID: <21d01741-02af-0af8-5749-2d4aa63c9877@gmail.com>

I have seen several variants of the Devanagari character ?, but recently 
I came across a manuscript (paper, 18th-19th century, northern 
appearance) where it is very often, though not consistently, written in 
a style that makes it look like ????. I haven't seen that style before, 
but it is too frequent to be a simple copying error. Is it 
characteristic of any particular region and/or period?

Thanks,
Martin Gansten
