Such a beautiful human being and scholar. I always felt close to him from
the first moment I met him, such a brilliant and generous spirit. It's so
sad that he has gone so suddenly. The consolation is the people he
mentored--to whom you alluded Andrea, people such as yourself--who keep his
legacy alive through the impact he has had on them. His work also
guarantees his immortality. It is still so sad to lose him like this.

It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the
individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a
relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and
its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or
demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for
the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and
that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have
experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their
time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of
someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, *Playing and Reality*
