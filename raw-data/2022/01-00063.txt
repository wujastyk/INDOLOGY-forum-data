Subject: [INDOLOGY] biphasic sleep in Ancient India?
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4LTCx03JtRg18Qr5KLchJyeb=HpRonXp=QvWJYTeM5jag@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues

I just read an interesting article:
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep

this led me to wonder whether anyone has run across any indications in Skt
(or Tamil) literature of this so-called biphasic sleep.

Best thanks in advance,
Jonathan
