Dear Dr. Ghosh,
Thank you for this. We have lost one of our great scholars of premodern Indian history with his demise. So many of us have contextualized our own work through relying on his insights and his passing affects us as a community of scholars that much more.
With best wishes,
Srilata Raman,
Professor of Hinduism,
University of Toronto.
