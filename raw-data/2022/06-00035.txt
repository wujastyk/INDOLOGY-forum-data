Dear Dr Patel, dear colleagues

I would dare to remind readers of this list that the *Indo-Iranian Journal*
(IIJ) is happy to continue its tradition of publishing works relevant to
Indian epigraphy. (As far as I recall,  at least in the past the journal's
coverage has been largely limited to Sanskrit and Prakrit epigraphs, but I
do not see why South Indian epigraphs could not also be considered.)

This said, the IIJ looks for articles which would place such epigraphs in a
meaningful context, and thus are more than what at least some of the ASI
publications present, namely raw data as it were, as valuable as such data
of course are!

Jonathan Silk
co-editor of the IIJ
