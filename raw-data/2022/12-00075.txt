Unfortunately, the actual number of accessible manuscripts is much lower, not 17290. Far from all the items that come up through this search actually contain pdfs (e.g. a search for "Yogas?tra" yields six entries and only three have the pdf; similarly with other texts I tried searching for).

I think the problem is the metadata, which is quite messy. Not to mention the transcription of the titles, which is terrible (e.g., Gorak?a?ataka is written as Gorakxha?ataka or Gorak?????aka  and Gorak?an?thabodha as Gorakxhanatobodha, etc.).
