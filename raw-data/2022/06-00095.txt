Subject: [INDOLOGY] Publication: Sanskrit/Hindi equivalents to scientific
 terms
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o8aDf1MQvcJwmOGRCs=VY4gX63j=yVFenTXJO2+r0ijMg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
This was posted on another forum.
Decades ago GOI established a body to formulate Sanskrit/Hindi equivalents
for scientific terms. I have seen their publication, but I don't remember
the bibliog?aphic details.

Can anyone identify this publication, or better yet have a link to an
on-line version of it?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
