Dear members of the list,

I wonder if any of you may have a scan of the following article (perhaps, a short monograph):

Joshi, S. D. 1966. ?Adjectives and Substantives as a Single Class in the Parts of Speech?. Publications of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit. Poona: University of Poona.

Many thanks in advance!

best,
Andrey
