Many people have thought about this issue, obviously, but it would be a very expensive undertaking to catalogue even a part of what's there and even at a minimal cataloguing record level.  The Archive.org <http://archive.org/> people take the "Google search" approach, i.e., you find what you need by searching using carefully-constructed keywords.  This is surprisingly effective, but lots falls through the cracks, as we all know from personal experience.
