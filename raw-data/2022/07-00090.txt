Relevant too would be the complementary notions, in Buddhist Abhidharma, of hrI and apatrApya, roughly conscience and a sense of shame. They're of interest in particular because of the explicit distinction between self-regarding and other-regarding moral attitudes made in this context. I'm not sure that there are dedicated studies on just this topic, but any good work on the abhidhamma/abhidharma will deal with this at some point.

best,
Matthew

Dear Ram-Prasad,

I wrote the attached piece entitled ?Conscience is Tradition: Classical Hindu Law and the Ethics of Conservatism? for a recent edited volume on rules and ethics. My JAOS article ?On Atmatusti as a Source of Dharma? also addresses the idea of conscience. Hope these are useful.

Best, Don

A colleague who is not on this list asks whether there is any literature on ?the concept of conscience or its analogues in pre-modern Indian literature?.

Thank you,
