Dear Dean,

While "wolf warriors" are news to me (the wolf is a negative sign of
anxiety or danger), if you look at Diwakar Acharya's "How to Behave Like a
Bull," the paper argues that the emulation (and I personally would say
*impersonation*) of Indra as an unruly bull was an ancient Vedic practice,
elements of which survive in the P??upatas?tras. I am happy to send a pdf
of this excellent paper.

Best,
Caley
