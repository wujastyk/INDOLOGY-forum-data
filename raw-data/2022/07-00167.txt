Subject: [INDOLOGY] New version of Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
Message-ID: <8ccaef04-1df7-3666-eda2-ce760cdc9989@gmx.de>

Dear all,

a new XML version of Bloomfield's VC can be found here, along with a
paper describing how we built it:

https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/papers/2023wsc

The new version is hopefully much easier to parse and and therefore more
accessible for searching as well as for computational approaches.

Best, Oliver
