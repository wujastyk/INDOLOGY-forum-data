Dear all,

as the title suggests, I'm looking for soft copies of the SadvB:
* the edition by Sharma
* the translation by Boll?e

I was not able to trace any of them on archive. Also, does anybody have
an e-text of this Brahmana and would be ready to share it? It would be
proofread + integrated in the DCS.

Best, Oliver
