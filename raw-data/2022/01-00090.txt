Dear List membersA warm thanks to Dr. Ruppel, Prof. Olivelle, Dr Birch and others for
their responses and further questions.

To clarify one question: by digital edition I mean not a digital text
of the sort available on GRETIL for example, but something more, like
this:
https://editions.byzantini.st/ChronicleME/#/home

As you will see above, the digital edition of the Chronicle of Matthew
of Edessa by Dr Tara Andrews and her team, is an interactive critical
edition, including graphs, maps, the transcriptions of all the
manuscripts used available for view and much more that you wouldn't,
or perhaps are unable to, include in a regular printed critical
edition. Also one could potentially show a text as multiple
historically protean texts rather than the single archetype we
reconstruct in traditional philology.? I found this exciting and was
hoping to develop something like it but with many more layers of
content, something dense and rich.?

I hope that explains a bit more what I was after.?

Thank you
Bihani?
