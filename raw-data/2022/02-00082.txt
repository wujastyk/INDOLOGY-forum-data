That year Karl joined the Philosophy faculty at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota where he met Antonia Fleak whom he married in 1957. From 1956 he served at the University of Minnesota teaching analytical philosophy and introducing courses on the philosophies of India. He also played a major role in the formation of  the South Asian studies program at Minnesota before joining the University of Washington in 1971. Along with his continued teaching in Philosophy, Karl led the growth of the Washington South Asia program, serving many years as its director. Grounded in his scholarly focus, he also was an active promotor and participant in significant inter-disciplinary projects such as that on Karma and Rebirth sponsored by the Joint Committee on South Asia of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies. He retired in from Washington in 1997 but continued his active scholarly endeavors toward completion of the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies.  In recognition of his great contributions to this project he was celebrated by the Government of India which bestowed upon him the Padma Shri award in 2011.

Beyond his own extensive scholarly publications, Karl was active nationally and internationally in the scholarly study of philosophy and South Asia.  He contributed service to scholarly organizations such as the Association for Asian Studies and the American Institute of Indian Studies. For many years he chaired the South Asia Review panel for the Fulbright Senior Scholar Awards.

I first met Karl when I was a graduate student at the University of Minnesota in 1961 when he and his wife Toni joined our first year Hindi class.  Later I had a chance to enroll in his Introduction to Indian Philosophy course?a most rigorous and enlightening experience.  I was delighted when he joined us at Washington, and benefited enormously from his leadership and support.  I am staggered to realize that we first met 61 years ago.

Karl Potter was an intellectual giant of great discipline and organizational capacities. Yet personally he was unfailingly ?low key??personable, empathetic and welcoming. He was a wonderful colleague. He and Toni opened their home for myriad meals and social gatherings for faculty and students. Beyond his family Karl loved wilderness hiking, golf, chess and classical music.  He introduced many of us to the compositions of Franz Schmidt whose music he rightly felt to be underappreciated.  Perhaps stemming from his mother?s artistry he was a skilled pianist. In some ways it is difficult to comprehend how all that Karl accomplished could fit into one lifetime..

He is survived by his wife Antonia, their children David and Julie, grandson Raphael and sister Nancy.  He was predeceased by his brother, the political scientist David Potter. His family have suggested donations in his memory to Sequoia Forest Keeper: (https:/www.patagonia.com/actionworks.grantees/Sequoia-forestkeeper/)

A virtual Zoom memorial for Karl Potter will be held on Sunday, February 13 at 11:00 am (Pacific Standard Time/ 19:00 GMT/12:30 IST). It is anticipated that it will last about one hour.  If you would like to attend, please contact Julie Potter <juliepotter68 at hotmail.co.uk<mailto:juliepotter68 at hotmail.co.uk>>] to receive a Zoom invitation.
