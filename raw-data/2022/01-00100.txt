dear Colleague

While there may certainly be historical reasons to read Julien, if it is
the content you are after you might think of a more modern rendering such
as that freely available online at
https://bdkamerica.org/product/the-great-tang-dynasty-record-of-the-western-regions/

Be that as it may, the volume you asked about is easily located online
through a simple google search:
