Dear list members,

in a k?vya commentary I am editing I found in close succession the
definitions of six types of glances.
As it happens, the same six glances are defined in N??ya??stra, ch. 8, but
both the wording and the content of the definitions differ in various
degrees in the two texts. The N??ya??stra editions I have at hand are
Gaekwad Oriental Series, vol. 1, 2nd ed., 1956, K?vyam?l? 1943 and Grosset
1898; the six definitions are very similar in the three editions. Of course
it is not impossible that editions of the N??? that I could not access read
the same wording that appears in the commentary I am editing.

Interestingly, Harihara's commentary on M?lat?m?dhava (ed. by Fran?ois
Grimal) includes a definition of one of the six glances, namely the snigdh?
glance, that is very close to the one in the commentary I am editing.
Compare the following three excerpts:
1) from N??ya???tra (GOS ed., p. 9):
vy?ko?amadhy? madhur? sthitat?r?bhil??i?? |
s?nandabhr?lat? d???i? snigdheya? ratibh?vaj? || 8.57 ||
2) from the commentary I am editing:
smerat?r? s?bhil??? madhur?ntarvik?sin? |
sahar?? ?asyate snigdh? d???i? sy?d ratisambhav? ||
3) from Harihara's commentary (p. 47):
sahar?? s?bhil??? ca madhur?ntarvik?sin? |
smerat?r? bhaved d???i? snigdh? raty?khyabh?vaj? ||

I am wondering if anyone has encountered, in works of any genre, quotations
that treat topics covered in the N??ya??stra but that neither are attested
in its published editions nor come from other known sa?g?ta??stra treatises
or cognate literature. In particular, I am interested in definitions. If
passages of said kind do exist, I would like to know if a trend has been
noticed as for their content or other features.
I'd be very grateful for references, suggestions etc.

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
