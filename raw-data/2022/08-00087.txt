Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Greetings from Mumbai!

I wanted to informally bring to your notice that we are looking for a
specialist in Indian/South Asian philosophy. Interested candidates may
apply as per the guidelines mentioned on the IITB website:

https://www.iitb.ac.in/en/recruitment-faculty-positions-academic-units-other-dsse-cminds-kcdh-idp-cs

Fresh PhDs may also apply. Women candidates will be given preference. Only
the Assistant Professor level position is open. If you have students or
colleagues who may be interested in applying, you may bring this to
their attention. They should read the eligibility criteria carefully before
applying.

Any queries can be addressed to me. Thanks and regards.

Mrinal Kaul
