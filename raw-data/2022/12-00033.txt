Subject: [INDOLOGY] Invitation for 2023 EASR conference in Vilnius
 (Lithuania, 4-8 September)
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf_XzRRh-O119QnEuYRE4N3yJCdO42gY7nRnkGyEu4ODLg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

First of all, apologies for cross posting.

I am writing because I would like to invite you to submit a paper proposal
for the panel I arranged for the next EASR conference (Religion and
technologies) in Vilnius (4 to 8 September 2023), entitled *Practices,
tools, and ecology of magic-shamanic traditions across pre-modern and
modern Monsoon Asia (PO40)*.

This panel will *focus not only on tantric traditions but also (and
particularly) on folk and indigenous traditions of South Asia, Southeast
Asia, and Southern China and their intersection with magic and shamanism*.
As in the previous EASR conference the panel will be a multidisciplinary
one. Studies on the woman's agency in magic-shamanic contexts are very
welcomed.

*- The call for papers will close on 31st January at 23:59 CET*. You can
submit -- if you wish -- your proposal following this link:
https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-papers/
*- Paper's presentations are expected to be 20-25 minutes with 5-10 minutes
discussion.*

As in the previous EASR conferences I will work to publish all the papers
that will be presented in the proposed panel through a special issue or a
collective volume (after a process of internal review and after a
double-blind review).

Please, feel free to forward this invitation and panel's details to your
colleagues and students.

*Title:*
Practices, tools, and ecology of magic-shamanic traditions across
pre-modern and modern Monsoon Asia (PO40)

*Author:*
Paolo E. Rosati

*Short Abstract:*
This panel aims to shed light on tools, environments and ecology of
magic-shamanic contexts in mainstream Indic, tantric, vernacular, and
tribal religions across Monsoon Asia. Perspective authors are expected to
focus on that practices often labelled as phenomena outside the mainstream
religiosity.

*Long Abstract:*
This panel considers Monsoon Asia as a geographical area?which includes the
Indian subcontinent, Tibet, mainland and maritime Southeast Asia, and
Southern China?where several religious practices are shared, hence, a
socio-cultural unity of the region is marked. In fact, Indic mainstream
(e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism), tantric, vernacular, and tribal
religions, share several socio-religious traits whose origin could be
traced back to an ancient common, and complex substratum. The resilience of
magic-shamanic elements is among these common traits.

This panel aims to shed light on that (material or intangible) instruments,
which have been used as ritual, magic, or shamanic tools since pre-modern
history of Monsoon Asia. Indeed, usually mastering magic and shamanic
powers is closely related to meditation, yogic practices, severe penances,
manipulation of bodily fluids, the consumption of intoxicating substances,
the use of bones and skulls as talismans, the use of ashes, mantras, spells
and spell-books, geometric diagrams (such as ma??alas and yantras), music
instruments (particularly drums and other percussions), etc. Panel?s papers
discuss in depth the role of these and other tools in magic-shamanic
contexts and how they affected practices such as ecstatic possession,
shapeshifting, trance and other altered states of consciousness, healing
and/or harmful capacities, alchemy, divination (such as scapulimancy and
plastromancy) in mainstream, tantric, folk, and tribal traditions across
pre-modern and modern Monsoon Asia. Furthermore, this panel invites to
analyze the ecology of magic-shamanic contexts in order to better
understand the role of the locus sacer as a sacred space where the
practitioners can cross the borders with the supra-human world or may reach
the enlightenment or other transcendental states.

Perspective authors are expected to use both empirical and theoretical
methodology and to engage the subject with a multidisciplinary approach,
considering disciplines such as textual studies, history, art history,
archaeology, ethnography, anthropology, folkloric studies, religious
studies, etc.

I wish to hear from you soon,
Paolo
