Dear All:

I want to alert you all to the Resource Library for Dharma??stra Studies created by Don Davis. It contains eleven Dharma??stra commentaries and Nibandhas digitized and searchable. I think it will be a great resource for those interested in the medieval Hindu/Brahmanical world. The texts are:

B?lakr??? of Vi?var?pa, commentary on the Y?j?avalkya-dharma??stra.
Mit?k?ar? of Vij??ne?vara, commentary on the Y?j?avalkya-dharma??stra.
Apar?rka?s Commentary on the Y?j?avalkya-dharma??stra.
Bh?ruci?s Commentary on the M?nava-dharma??stra.
(contains also the first five chapters that were omitted in Derrett?s edition)
Manubh??ya of Medh?tithi, commentary on the M?nava-dharma??stra.
P?r??ara-m?dhav?ya, M?dhava?s commentary on the Par??ara-sm?ti.
K?tyakalpataru by Lak?m?dhara, digest (two volumes on gifts and legal procedure available).
D?yabh?ga of J?m?tav?hana, treatise on inheritance.
Sm?ticandrik? by Deva?abha??a, major digest in five volumes.
Vyavah?racint?ma?i of V?caspati Mi?ra, treatise on legal procedure.
Sarasvat?vil?sa by Prat?parudra, digest on legal procedure.

In addition there are:

Dak?asm?ti, short m?lasm?ti.
The four Dharmas?tras (?pastamba, Gautama, Baudh?yana, Vasi??ha), earliest texts of the dharma tradition in one searchable unicode file.

Others will be added as and when we manage to digitize them. With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick Olivelle
