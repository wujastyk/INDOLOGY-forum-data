Dear Scholars,

Regarding the stage of the A?vamedha yaj?a in which the queen lies by the dead horse --

1. What is the the original ??stra source that enjoins this procedure?

2. Have traditional commentators tried to sanitize thru exegesis this apparently strange requirement?

Many thanks for any help with this,
Howard
