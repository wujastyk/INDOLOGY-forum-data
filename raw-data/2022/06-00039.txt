Various forms of the word siddhi or siddha occur in the Gita in the following verses, often in the sense of achieving ?perfection? or ?success? in yoga or spiritual practice:

2.48, 3.4, 3.20 (sa?siddhi), 4.12 (karma??? siddhi), 4.22, 4.38 (yoga-sa?siddhi), 6.37 (yoga-sa?siddhi), 6.43, 6.45, 7.3, 8.15, 10.26, 11.22, 11.36, 12.10, 14.1, 16.23, 18.26, 18.45 (sa?siddhi), 18.46, 18.49-50

I hope this helps,
Howard Resnick
