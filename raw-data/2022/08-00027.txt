As in Sanskrit we have to distinguish between internal and external sandhi.

Examples like in-temperate, im-possible, in[?]-congruous or the difference in pronunciation of s as [s] or [z] depending on what precedes have internal sandhi. Examples like gocha = got you or an apple vs. a pear have external sandhi. (Many English examples of external sandhi, such as gocha, are found in causual or informal speech; others, such as won?t = will not are restricted to enclitic forms. One type of sandhi with broad application which is found in formal as well as informal speech is the British English r-linking in structures like the idea-r is vs. the idea was.)

All the best,

Hans Henrich Hock

Sandhi in Sanskrit is an example of sound shifts at word boundaries.
In English we have shifts such as the transformation into 'an orange' from 'a n' from the original 'nara?ja' (Spanish from original Persian).
Also 'an apron' from 'a napron' loaned from 'napperon' (napkin) (from French with an obviously related cognate).
There is the example of the presumed 'Lady Mondegrain' from a hearing of a line in a poem mentioning a death, which reads "...laid him on the green..."

Dear Harry,

Another example that comes immediately to mind is the indefinite article: "a" before words beginning with a consonant, "an" before words beginning with a vowel. Here the sandhi is not just a matter of pronunciation but of orthography.

Best wishes,
Michael

Thank you all for these great replies. Howard Resnick gives an example of a spelling change for internal sandhi.  Can someone give me an example of a spelling change for word junction (external) sandhi in a non-Indian language (if such a thing exists?).

English sandhi, n -> m before a labial consonant:

Examples: in-justice but im-possible; in-scrutable, but im-mature.

etc.

Good luck,
Howard
