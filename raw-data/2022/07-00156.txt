I also would be happy (and surprised) to see references to a divine origin of Sanskrit. It is true that Sanskrit is daiv? v?k (Bhart?hari) ?divine language? or ?language of the gods?, but this does not mean that is has a divine origin. In Brahmanical circles, at least since K?ty?yana and Pata?jali, Sanskrit is eternal and has no origin at all.
