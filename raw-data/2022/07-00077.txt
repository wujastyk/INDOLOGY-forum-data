Dear All,

There does not seem to be anything wrong with "encouraging an attitude of questioning and not merely accepting whatever the textbooks (or print/electronic/social media) say as infallible truth". 

On two specific issues raised in the message below, here are (very brief) indications :

(a) Newton's theory of gravitation is interesting and useful, but not correct for very basic reasons, as we now understand after the advent of the Special and General theories of Relativity.  As for the interplay between scientific theories and social conditions or ideologies, see what Aldo G. Gargani says about Newton's physics ("Le savoir sans fondements", Vrin, Paris, 2013).

(b) We have no statement of a general theorem that goes back to Pythagoras. The attribution is quite late (Vitruvius, Cicero,...), and may not refer to the full theorem. 
Cautious historians avoid referring to an alleged "Theorem of Pythagoras" or if they must, always use quotation marks, as we did. It is best to call the theorem popularly attributed to him "theorem of the square of the hypotenuse" (or, "of the diagonal (cord)" -- the Indian formulation), or Euclid I.47. There is a similar issue with what is called "Thales' theorem" in France. There are no named theorems in Euclid.

The earliest attribution extant seems to be Vitruvius' (several centuries after Pythagoras' putative time). Since the exact reference is almost never given, let alone the text, we include it. It only mentions a special case: a triangle with sides 3-4-5, and explains that the result is useful to make nice staircases):

Source : https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/vitruvius/vitruvius9.html#P.1

De Architectura, Book IX, Praefatio.

[6]  Item Pythagoras normam sine artificis fabricationibus inventam ostendit, et quam magno labore fabri normam facientes vix ad verum perducere possunt, id rationibus et methodis emendatum ex eius praeceptis explicatur. Namque si sumantur regulae tres, e quibus una sit pedes III, altera pedes IIII, tertia pedes V, eaeque regulae inter se compositae tangant alia aliam suis cacuminibus extremis schema habentes trigoni, deformabunt normam emendatam. Ad eas autem regularum singularum longitudines si singula quadrata paribus lateribus describantur, cum erit trium latus, areae habebit pedes VIIII, quod IIII, XVI quod V erit, XXV.

[7]  Ita quantum areae pedum numerum duo quadrata ex tribus pedibus longitudinis laterum et quattuor efficiunt, aeque tantum numerum reddidit unum ex quinque descriptum. Id Pythagoras cum invenisset, non dubitans a Musis se in ea inventione monitum, maximas gratias agens hostias dicitur his immolavisse. Ea autem ratio, quemadmodum in multis rebus et mensuris est utilis, etiam in aedificiis scalarum aedificationibus, uti temperatas habeant graduum librationis, est expedita.

(Vitruvius then explains why this is useful to make staircases).

See also X.6.4 for another application of the same triangle.

Best wishes,
