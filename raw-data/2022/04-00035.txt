Dear list,

Thank you Jim, this announcement was indeed shocking and saddening. Luis was a lovely man whom I had the pleasure of working with on a Mahabharata AAR panel in 2010 and subsequent IJHS issue. In the next while an edited volume will appear including a chapter in which I build on Luis's 2002 The Mah?bh?rata and the Yugas, and I was so looking forward to sending him copy and getting back in touch. My thoughts go out to his family and friends.

Chris
