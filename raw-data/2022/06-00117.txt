Dear friends and colleagues,

does any of you happen to have at hand a soft copy of an edition of Kaly??amalla's Ana?gara?ga? At least the following four have been published, but none of them seems to be available through archive.org or other free open-access resource sites ? possibly because none of the editions is a free open-access resource (yet)?
Bha???r?, Vi??upras?da (ed.), Ana?gara?ga? kaly??amallaviracita? (K???: Vidy?vil?sa Yantr?laya, 1923).
?c?rya, Y?dava?arma Trivikrama (ed.), Ana?gara?ga? kaly??amallaviracita? (Mumbai: Gujar?t? Ny?s, 1924).
Jh?, R?macandra (ed.), Ana?garangah k?makal?n?makahind?vy?khyopeta? kaly??amallaviracita? vi??upras?dabha??ar??? p?rvasa??odhita?; bh?mik?lekhaka? Devadatta??str?, K???sa?skr?tas?rijapustakam?l? 9 (V?r??as?: Caukhambh? Sa?skr?ta Sa?sth?na, 1999).
Trip??h?, R?mas?gara (ed.), Ana?gara?ga? hind?bh???y?m anuv?dena saha ra?jin?ti vistr?tavy?khyay? sa?valita? kaly??amallaviracita?, Vrajajivan ayurvijnan granthamala 8. (Dill?: Caukhamb? Sa?skr?ta Prati??h?na, 1999).
Many thanks in advance.
All the best,

Marco
