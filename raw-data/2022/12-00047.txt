Thanks for sharing this. A great example of close reading, if true. I was
most intrigued by Prof. Vergiani's statement:

"Mr Rajpopat said he had a ?eureka moment? after his supervisor at
Cambridge, Professor of Sanskrit Vincenzo Vergiani, advised him: ?If the
solution is complicated, you are probably wrong.?"

All best,
Arash
