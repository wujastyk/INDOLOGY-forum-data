A thorough historiographic review - along with an engaging dispute - of the
linking of wolves and male warrior bands in Indo-European scholarship
appears in the recent co-authored book by Carlo Ginzburg and Bruce
Lincoln: *Old
Thiess, a Livonian Werewolf A Classic Case in Comparative Perspective
*(UChicago
Press, 2020).

Take care,
Eric
