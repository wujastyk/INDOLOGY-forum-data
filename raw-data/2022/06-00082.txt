Subject: [INDOLOGY] Translation of Ratirahasya?
Message-ID: <CADKwQ2nS7bdgzb=GaaUr5QfXGA6g7WmaFna5WuE4Y-mJESGq5A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List Members,

Greetings!

I wonder if anyone could kindly provide me with more information about this
particular translation of *Ratirahasya* (*Koka??stra*)?

https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.219313/page/n3/mode/2up

Neither its translator nor publishing place is indicated in the document,
and it's clear that it's not the translation of either Alex Comfort or S.
C. Upadhyaya. I would really appreciate it if anyone could kindly shed some
light on this.

Thank you so much!

best wishes,
Yang Qu
