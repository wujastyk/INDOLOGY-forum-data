Of course the terms right- and left-hand are used often in linguistics in
precisely the sense that Dr. Rajpopat uses them, without any reference to
writing. (E.g., right-branching, left-hand context, rightmost morpheme,
etc.)

Although I am convinced by Dr. Vergiani's arguments that P??ini was
literate ("P??ini?s A???dhy?y?. A Turning Point in Indian Intellectual
History," pp. 11-36 in Rivista degli Studi Orientali N.S. 92.3?4, 2019).

Congratulations to Dr. Rajpopat for this idea, which if true would join the
ranks of Kiparsky's reinterpretation as a simple and effective corrective
to the grammatical tradition.
