Dear list members,

I?m searching for a pdf of the Journal of the Tanjore Maharaja Serfoji?s Sarasvati Mahal Library, vol. 9, no. 3, printed in either late 1953 or 1954. Archive has only a handful of the journal volumes; same with South Asia Commons and the Tamil Digital Library. It seems that Hathi Trust once allowed digital access to collections in North America, but no longer. I?m nowhere near a library anytime soon, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
Jonathan Peterson
