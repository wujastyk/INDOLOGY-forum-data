 Ahmedabad University, India

Dear all,

The School of Arts and Sciences
<https://ahduni.edu.in/academics/schools-centres/school-of-arts-and-sciences/>
 at Ahmedabad University is seeking to appoint a small number of additional
professors in the Humanities and Languages
<https://ahduni.edu.in/academics/schools-centres/school-of-arts-and-sciences/divisions/humanities-and-languages/>
 division. Our teaching and research base will include History, Philosophy,
Religious Studies, Modern and Classical Languages, World Literatures and
Global Humanities. This is an exciting opportunity to join a fast-growing
school in India at a new private university with a public ethos.

Applicants must already have a doctorate (or be close to completion) from
an institution with international recognition. Appointees will be expected
to engage in high-level research, to publish in their specialist field, to
teach and examine undergraduates, to seek opportunities to win external
funding for their research, and to supervise and examine both Masters and
Doctoral work. They must have a record of excellence and potential,
commensurate with their appointment level and stage of career. They will be
expected to provide evidence of excellence as demonstrated by publications
in leading academic journals or a research project at an international
level, an emerging record of scholarly accomplishments, presentations at
significant conferences and examples of original forms of knowledge
production. Applications are especially encouraged from scholars of Indian
or non-Western Philosophy with philological training in Pali, Tamil,
Persian, Prakrit and/or Sanskrit.

Ahmedabad University supports innovative, interdisciplinary, project-based
education, and asserts the centrality of the arts and sciences in a broad,
fulfilling education. We welcome applications from scholars with strong
communication skills who can contribute to imaginative learning, and have a
willingness to work collaboratively as part of a community of emerging
scholars. All faculty at the University are expected to engage in both
teaching and research, and we operate a six-year tenure track. Ahmedabad
University is committed to diversity, and welcomes applications from
qualified persons from underrepresented groups regardless of ethnicity,
gender, religion or similar status.

Applicants are requested at this stage to submit

1.    a letter stating their interest in a position at the University and
outlining briefly their qualifications for it;
2.    an up-to-date CV detailing their training, jobs held, university
teaching experience, and publications;
3.    one representative article or other publication as an example of
their scholarship; and
4.    a statement of their future research and teaching interests (maximum
length, 1000 words).

Applications and enquiries should be made to the office of the Dean of the
School of Arts and Sciences using the email address
artsandsciences at ahduni.edu.in. Please quote the reference SAS/HL/003 on
your application and in any associated correspondence.

With best regards,

Shishir Saxena
