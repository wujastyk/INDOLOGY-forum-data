Subject: A query re. aa;sviina as a measurement
Message-ID: <161227093941.23782.4124310247431086385.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The dictionaries give aa;sviina as a measurement of distance: 'distance traveled by a horse, that is, by a horse-rider, in one day.' Saaya.na in his commentary of Pa;nca-vi.m;sa-braahma.na clarifies that a twenty-four hour day, ahoraatra, is meant in this context. Has anyone of you come across a statement expressing ancient understanding, especially ancient Indian understanding, of how much distance a horse/mare being normally ridden covered, assuming that the horse/mare did not stop? 

(In actual practice, a horse/mare could have been changed at certain stops, but this possibility is obviously to be ignored in associating a distance with aa;sviina.)
