Message-ID: <161227091313.23782.3301692964626790904.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Department of Philosophy at the University of Durham invites
applications for two PhD scholarships as part of the project
&#346;&#257;stravid: A New Paradigm for the Study of Indian Philosophy
funded by the European Research Council, to be taken up from October 2011.
The successful candidates will hold a graduate degree in Philosophy or
Buddhist Studies and will work under the supervision of Dr Jan Westerhoff
on philosophical problems posed by the Indian Madhyamaka texts to be
encoded and analyzed during the project. Familiarity with some of the
relevant Asian languages (Sanskrit, Tibetan, Japanese) is an advantage but
no prerequisite. The positions are not restricted to EU nationals,
suitable candidates of any nationality are invited to apply.
