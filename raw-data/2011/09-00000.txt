" The present project is the result of a larger re?ection on the common sensical statement that the most interesting parts of a conference are the co?ee breaks. One yawns or falls asleep while most papers are read ?apart from a couple of them and one?s own one."

Sounds like an excellent idea.  Ananda Coomaraswamy when attending lectures would compose himself very comfortably and shut his eyes, to go to sleep if the talk weren't interesting.  He felt it was the speaker's duty to keep the audience interested and awake.

But I must say it sounds a little inconsiderate, unless one were part of a big audience and not noticeable.  I have sleep problems and sometimes if I know the speaker go up to explain and apologize in advance.  (Present company is hereby notified.)
