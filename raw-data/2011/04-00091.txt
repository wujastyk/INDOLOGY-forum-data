References to seeing something as clearly as an ?malaka in the hand are 
quite common in Pali commentaries from Buddhaghosa on. It is usually 
explained in terms of clear or plain seeing or in terms of direct 
experience. However, the older ??k? to the Abhidhamm?vat?ra glosses the 
final p?da of Abhidh-av v. 181:
  ekavidh?dinaye pan' imasmi?,
yo kusalo matim? idha bhikkhu.
tassabhidhammagat? pana atth?,
hatthagat?malak? viya honti ||
with:
*hatthagat?* hatthapavi??h? *?malak? viya* suddhama?ik? viya honti.

So the ?malaka is compared to a clear gem. That seems somewhat parallel 
to the Tibetan interpretation.
