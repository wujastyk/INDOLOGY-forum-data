Dear Indologists,

Evidently, the ad for the South Asian Art at Michigan that I sent a few minutes ago as an email attachment went out as a blank.  I don't know why.  But here is the full text of the relevant ad:

The Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and the Department of the History of Art at University of Michigan invite applications for a tenure-track position in South Asian Art and Visual Culture, at the rank of assistant professor, beginning September 2012. Ph.D. is required prior to appointment and a high level of proficiency in relevant languages is essential.  Specialization is open, but the committee expects successful candidates to be committed to interdisciplinary or cross-cultural investigation. The appointee will be expected to teach a broad range of undergraduate courses and graduate seminars on the arts and visual cultures of South Asia, including both the pre-modern and modern periods, as well as, on occasion, a survey course on Arts of Asia; to supervise doctoral dissertations; and to participate actively in departmental and area studies initiatives within a large university community that encourages interdepartmental dialogue. Applicants should provide a letter of application, CV, a statement of teaching philosophy and experience, a statement of current and future research plans, evidence of teaching excellence (if available), representative publications or a writing sample, and at least three letters of recommendation. Applications must be received by November 1, 2011. The University of Michigan is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer and is supportive of the needs of dual career couples. Women and minorities are encouraged to apply. Email kjmunson at umich.edu with questions.  

Application materials, except letters of recommendation, must be submitted electronically. Please submit your materials as email attachments to southasianart at sharepoint.umich.edu. The subject of your email must appear as follows: ?Last name, First name?.  For example: Doe, Jane.   

Letters of recommendation should be sent as PDF files to kjmunson at umich.edu.
