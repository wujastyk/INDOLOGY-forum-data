Dear Mrinal,

Thank you for sharing this sad news.  I last saw Panditji in 2008, on his 90th birthday.  He was a good soul, and I learned a lot from him studying "Saiva tantric texts for half a year in 2002-2003.  He will be missed.

He was a student of Gopinath Kaviraj and learnt many ?aiva texts with him besides the Ny?ya??stra. He taught many Indologists and helped many of us learning the texts of Abhinavagupta. He worked for long term projects with Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (Varanasi) and contributed immensely in the series of the Kal?tattvako?a. He kept on teaching many of his students till his last breath. His annotated English translation of the Tantras?ra of Abhinavagupta is still awaited.
