Girnar Rock Edict II: PaMthesU kUpA ca khAnApita, vrachA ca ropApitA paribhogAya pasu-manusAnaM.



E. Hultzsch (1925, p. 4): "On the roads wells were caused to be dug , and trees were caused to be planted for the use of cattle and men."



Jules Bloch (1950, p. 95) reverses the order, for him men must go first : "[...] ? l'usage des hommes et des b?tes".

Is the order of the compound in the original based on any sort of priority, or merely on style, the presumption that in a dvandva longer words should come after shorter?

Doesn't paZu here, as frequently,  mean "domestic mammal" rather than "animal" in general or "cattle" in particular,  and refer to other animals that would go along a highway with people, such as buffalo, sheep, goats, asses, and camels?
