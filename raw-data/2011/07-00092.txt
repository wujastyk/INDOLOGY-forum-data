Dear list,

After the interesting responses I received on and off list to my query about recaka, p?raka and kumbhaka in March, I am returning with another question about pr???y?ma.

Although it is commonly divided into three parts, recaka, p?raka and kumbhaka, the Nayas?tra of the Ni?v?satattvasa?hit? divides pr???y?ma into four, the fourth being something it calls supra??nta.

n?bhy?? h?dayasa?c?r?n mana? cendriyagocar?t|
pr???y?ma? caturthas tu supra??ntas tu vi?ruta?|| 4:113||

?There is a fourth breath-exercise which is called Supra??nta [achieved] by moving [the vital energy] from the heart into the navel and [by moving] the mind away from the sense-objects.?

This fourth part of pr???y?ma is found also in the Svacchandatantra, which has drawn a great deal upon the Ni?v?sa, and in the Tantrasadbh?vatantra, which has drawn in turn upon the Svacchanda.  And Nirajan Kafle has pointed out to me that the fourth division is to be found also in the Dharmaputrik?, a text of the ?ivadharma corpus (Dharmaputrik? 1:19):

p?raka? kumbhaka? caiva recakas tadanantaram
pra??nta? caiva vij?eya? pr???y?ma? caturvidha?.

Is such a fourth pr???y?ma to be found in any other traditions of yoga ?
