Dear List,

It turns out that what Dominik and Daniel Stender have forwarded to me
was just the first page of my Semiotica article.  I have been sending
pdf's of a version of this paper that I published in Indo-Iranian
Journal in the same year.  The Semiotica paper is obviously a version
intended for the semiotics community.

So it turns out that I still do not have access to this paper!

I have a few offprints.  So I can scan it and make a pdf for anyone
who wants a pdf of it.  Sorry for the confusion.

George
