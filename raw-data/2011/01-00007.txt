Thank you, Peter Wyzlic alerted me to this.  My own library has purchased the Goettingen scan (available now for a fee, but it will eventually become available online as an ebook). so I'm all set.  Thanks again to all who contacted  me off-list with offers of help.  
Tim

it seems that this book is currently being scanned at the library in Goettingen:

http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=146&ppn=PPN641186703
or
http://opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de:80/DB=1/SET=5/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=1

probably, one can contact them and ask for a guesstimate about how long it will take before letting anyone else double their efforts. (with some luck, such an inquiry might even accelerate the digitalization)
