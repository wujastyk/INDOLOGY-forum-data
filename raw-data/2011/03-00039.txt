I have always been led to believe that 'Tartar' was a European corruption of 'T?t?r' (as in Persian), perhaps by association with Latin Tartarus.  In that case, I would have expected a Sanskrit rendering to be begin taataar- or taatar-, no?  Or are matters less clearcut than that?  Perhaps you can give us the relevant snippet.

I should be very interested to know of any instances of terms like 
t?rt?ya or t?rt?yaka, with the meaning 'Tartar', in (late) Sanskrit 
literature. I have come across a single occurrence, in the T?jikabh??a?a 
(16th-17th cent.), where this seems to be the only reasonable meaning of 
the word (it is definitely not related to t?t?ya); but I haven't found 
it in any dictionary.
