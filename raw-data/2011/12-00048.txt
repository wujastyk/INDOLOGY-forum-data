1. As a person from Madurai in South India, I'm very familiar with  
the "nagaraa" drum used during festivals of the local temple.

2. In my ancestral village Viravanallur (Tirunelveli District),  
there's a "nagaraa mandapam" close to our agraharam.

3. Upon my request to a professor in Chennai (Tamilnadu, South  
India), I got the following details. This professor is married to a  
woman from Meghalaya, so the details must have solid authenticity.

Here are the details with two images of the drums attached.
