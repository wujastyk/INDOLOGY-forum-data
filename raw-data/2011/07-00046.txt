Subject: New version of the DCS
Message-ID: <161227093135.23782.1423063539478244518.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list,

a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS) is now available at 
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php. My special 
thanks go to Mr. Dulip Withanage at the HRA in Heidelberg for his prompt, 
competent, and patient help in setting up the new version!
 
As citations and similar text passages have been a big issue in Germany for 
the last few months, the corpus now displays parallel passages in Sanskrit 
literature. You can find some theoretical background about the search 
algorithm at http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?
contents=help_citations. Basically, the database has been scanned for text 
passages that have at least 4 "non-trivial" words in common. Words may 
occur in free order, so dharmArthagobrAhmaNa and brAhmaNArthadharmago are 
accepted as similar. Parallels are displayed on the one hand in a large 
graph (select the menu item "Parallels"). Here, a line between two texts 
represents the parallels (click on the line to display the text passages). 
Texts marked green in this graph contain many incoming and outgoing links 
and are, therefore, important nodes in the network of parallels. On the 
other hand, parallels can be displayed for each individual chapter in a 
text. Try, for example, Manusmriti 1.1, which contains 130 parallel or 
similar passages (sentences starting with "=> ..."). Hope, this function 
may be helpful for a better understanding of some aspects of text 
transmission in ancient India.

In addition, I corrected a bug that prevented user input and corrections on 
the text page.


Best regards,

Oliver Hellwig
