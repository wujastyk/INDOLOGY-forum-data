Dear Allen,

The map of A?oka's empire, published in Kulke-Rothermund "A History of
India", 2004, p. 69, shows his main highways, the "Northern Route"
(uttarapatha) and the "Southern Route" (dak?i?apatha), and their
important outbranchings.

What kinds of animals would be moving/moved along these highways, long
enough for them to need access to water?

Buffaloes do not look like right candidates. Caravans and military
trains would use mainly bullocks and, to a lesser extent, camels as
draught animals. And, as mounts, horses, camels and elephants.

Were herds of goats and sheep driven long distance along those highways?

Is there any textual evidence for the presence of large herds of
cattle on those highways? Cattle as movable commodity, driven to where
it could have been sold?

Regards,

Artur Karp
