Dear colleagues,

the e-texts included in SARIT (Search and Retrieval of Indic Texts,
http://sarit.indology.info/), are now available in an online
repository that, so the hope of Dominik Wujastyk and myself, will make
the collaboration on the existing files and the addition of new files
to SARIT easier.

Please see https://github.com/paddymcall/SARIT/blob/master/README.org
for a description of what this repository is and how it might be used.

Yours,

--
