Dear Stephen, dear colleagues,
Assuming that the Sanskrit equivalent of *nyan du mi/ma btub pa* is not recorded in Negi?s Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary, which I do not have at hand at the moment and which you may have already consulted, I am tempted to suggest *a?rava??ya* or *a?r?vya,* that is, not in the sense of *inaudible* but rather in the sense of *unfit to be heard* (MW, s.v. a?r?vya). Compare also MW (s.v. ?rava??ya), which has also the meaning of *worth hearing.* The adjective in Tibetan seems to mean precisely *unworthy of hearing or listening to.*
Best wishes,

Dorji

Has anybody come across or can suggest a reliable / attested Sanskrit origin for this ~ contextually it seems to mean "disregard / ignore" something said.  I have looked in all the obvious sources, but cannot find anything.
