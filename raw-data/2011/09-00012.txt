The grammar is all right, since anu-gam "to follow" is construed with 
the accusative (cf. Boehtlingk and Roth's dictionary for examples): thus 
anugacchatu prav?ha? translates as "let one follow the flow" (though I 
think "prav?hamanugaccha" comes closer to GWTF).

That seems to be what many of my students expect. They come to class 
expecting to learn more about 'what is good', and if don't tell them 
what is 'good' according to their wishful thinking, then I must be 
'wrong'. (Fortunately they sometimes explicitly say so, which leads to 
amusing discussions and gives me the opportunity to set things straight 
and to be a greater guru than their gurus.)

In any case, Sanskrit is cool. My wife actually made a little bit of 
money through a tattoo: a fellow wanted to have some rather 
un-Sanskritic phrase tattooed on his arm, and he asked her to translate 
the phrase and give the translation in "Sanskrit script" (sic). She 
wrote back that she would do it only for a fee since, after all, she had 
spent a good deal of time learning the language and wanted to see her 
skill rewarded. He was decent and paid.
