there is a journal called "drk" fully dedicated to critical evaluation of
modern samskrita literature. it is published from Allahabad. most of the
contemporary critics and poets publish their critiques and poetries therein.
it is edited by Banamali Biswal who can be contacted by , "banamali biswal"
<banamali7 at gmail.com>.
offcourse there are many a seminars organised on this subject by many poets.
you can contack prof. Tarashankara sharma on who organised/part of some of
these seminars. he can be contacted prof.tspandeya at gmail.com, whose father
Pandit Mohanlal sharma, is a recipient of many awards in poetry like Padmini
etc.
since I have nothing to do with poetry, I have no biblio records on hand.
