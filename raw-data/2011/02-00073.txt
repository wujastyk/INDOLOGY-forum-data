> It may well be the case that Sanskrit curses far outnumber the vernacular ones in Indian epigraphy, although when one hears about the tens of thousands of Tamil inscriptions lying unpublished, this might give cause for hesitation with regard to such comparisons of numbers. In any case, in Southeast Asian epigraphy vernacular curses are very common, both on the mainland and in Indonesia.

> This seems to mean something like: 'The man who incurs this imprecation, may the black dog, the white dog, the red dog, the four-eyed dog, all of them visit that man's mother!'
> There is obviously something similar going on if you look at the different regions of India and of Southeast Asia, despite the differences of language and specific themes chosen to express curses. This asks for comparison.
> Whitney mentions curse-images. Harry Falk told me about the 'obscene' images he had noticed on some stone inscriptions at Ratnagiri and in the Orissa State Museum. I happen to have seen and photographed the same last month, so can attach some photos here. (I particularly enjoyed the innocent label for one of the two OSM pieces.) Although I haven't checked the texts of these inscriptions, and am a little unsure about the identification of the sexually aggressive beast, I suppose we see here a depiction of the 'ass-curse' that figures prominently also in text and image in the inscriptions of the ?il?h?ras of the western Deccan. The language used for the curse is there often (always?) Marathi.
> The reference for the Karashima article I alluded to is as follows:
> Noboru Karashima, "New Imprecations in Tamil Inscriptions and J?ti Formation", in: idem, Ancient to Medieval: South Indian Society in Transition, Delhi: OUP, 2009.
> Whitney mentions the Telaga Batu Old Malay inscription, which is indeed one of the most important (and most studied) inscriptions of Indonesia. It raises the problem of whether we make a difference between 'oaths' and 'curses'. The Sanskrit and vernacular languages may not make a clear lexical difference, at least the forms derived from ?ap in Sanskrit and borrowed into many vernaculars --- see Cham ?an?pa above --- might be ambivalent from the English language point of view. But it seems to me there is a difference implied at least by the difference in structural composition. The Telaga Batu text is different in several ways from the common 'curses' in Indonesian land-grants. The (to Southeast Asianists) famous epigraphical Khmer 'oath' of allegiance to S?ryavarman I is likewise fundamentally different from the 'curses' that are very common in Khmer epigraphy (both Sanskrit and vernacular). These 'oaths' make up the entire text or at least the bulk of it, whereas the 'curses' that started this thread normally stand at the end and are a relatively minor part of the inscription's message. Actually I think the mentioned 'oaths' also use a different vocabulary for 'oaths' (vaddhapratij?? in the Khmer, sumpah in the Malay case) than they do for curses (loan-derivatives of ?ap).
