Does anyone know why the state-run Xinhua news agency should issue this
particular piece of non-news at this time?

For anyone coming to this afresh, I recommend the essay "A Tale of Leaves"
by Ernst Steinkellner, freely downloadable here:
http://ikga.oeaw.ac.at/Mat.html, and the *Sanskrit Manuscripts in
China*proceedings ed. Steinkellner, Qing, & Krasser, from the same
site.
