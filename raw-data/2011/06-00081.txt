A colleague who is not on Indology has asked me a question to which I do not have a ready answer. So I promised him that I will post it on Indology, which generally elicits great answers from the pandit-network worldwide. The question relates to any studies done on the contrasting themes of "pa?ubh?va, v?rabh?va, and divyabh?va" -- I assume within the ?aiva-Tantrik traditions. Thanks for any leads.
