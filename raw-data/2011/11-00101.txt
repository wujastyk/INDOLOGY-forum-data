The swami must be Visvamitra, who brought Rama and his brother to Videha, to Sita's svayamvara.
Best,

This takes place during an exciting week-long mela (religious fair). Thousands of pilgrims come from India.  Cultural, agrarian and commercial exhibitions are held.   Hundreds of booths and bazaar shops sell all sorts of wares to thousands of pilgrims.  Dust, flies, loudspeakers blare-- and the roar of the crowd can be heard for miles around.

A gold-tipped umbrella is twirled over his head, musicians play, and the festive crowd swarms along the route to the Janaki Temple of Sita, which is only a short distance away.  The next day, the image of Sita is taken out from her temple and carried with great fanfare to Rama's side in a re-enactment of the Hindu marriage ceremonies, including rituals before the sacred fire.
