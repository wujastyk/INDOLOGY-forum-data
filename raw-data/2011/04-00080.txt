Dear Colleagues,
The rivers originate in the Western Himalayas or some adjacent range and 
some of them flow thru Kashmir. But they flow down through 
Panjab/Haryana. So one cannot be definite about the Kashmir connection 
tho that is possible. Definite evidence is necessary before drawing a 
firm conclusion.
There is a tendency among us to connect anything that 
might lie in or be just adjacent? to the regions surrounding Kashmir, to
 the? valley itself. But that may lead to unconscious errors.One has to 
be careful.
Best wishes for all
DB

Dear Jim,

?atarudr? (occurs also in the Matsyapur??a, see pw) is mentioned by Al-B?r?n? in his enumeration of rivers having their source in the Himavat (Sachau, Vol. 1: ch. 25).
Sircar identifies it with the ?atadru river (Geography of Ancient and Medieval India 1971: 51, n. 3).

> ?atarudr? might be a corruption of ?atadru ( = Sutlej).
?atadru/?dr? itself seems to be the result of post-vedic folk etymology (ved. ?utudr?, etc.), and the situation could have been similar with the formation of ?atarudr? (and possibly also with ?r?r?tri) as deliberate attempts of giving these rivers an easily comprehensible meaning. "Corruption" in the strict sense is perhaps not applicable to such names.


Best, Walter
