An excellent study reflecting, among other things, the student's
particular focus is: 

_Being a Buddhist Nun: The Struggle for Enlightenment in the
Himalayas._ By Kim Gutschow. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University
Press, 2004. 333 pages. Cloth. ISBN 0-674-01287-9 

Gutschow not only studied nun culture but monk culture as well,
and the interactions between these groups.
