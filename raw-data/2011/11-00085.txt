This refers to the "Windows format", the so-called "Mac OS format" is 
still available. Under Windows, some unarchiving programs like Winzip, 
Stuffit Expander, ALZip etc. are able to extract the contents of the 
.hqx file. But, after that you still need to install Nisus Writer which 
is nowadays only available for Mac OS, so far I know.

Otherwise you may to try the plain text version of Bloomfield's 
concordance provided by Masato Fujii, URL: 
<http://www.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~mfujii/shiryo/concordance.txt>

A scanned version of Bloomfield's concordance is available in the 
Internet Archive, URL: 
<http://www.archive.org/details/vedicconcordance00bloouoft>.

Hope it helps
