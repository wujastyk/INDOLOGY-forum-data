In the *Rasendrama?gala*, a tenth-century alchemical work ascribed to
N?g?rjuna Siddha, there's a word "challapalla" that seemed to mean something
like jhaka?aka too.  "Trouble, fuss, argument."  (Or it could be associated
with chal "cheat,"  meaning "deceptions, pretences"?)

(diplomatic transcription sic from MS, ch. 1:)

...

Maybe these words could be compared, linguistically, to English expressions
like "argy-bargy <http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/argy-bargy>."
