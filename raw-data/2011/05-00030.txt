Richard Schmidt: Nachtr?ge zum Sanskrit-W?rterbuch (1928), p. 194 lists 
jhaka?aka, "Streit" (quarrel); Jhaka?akas?ra, proper name; jhaga?aka. He 
does not have an entry bhaka?aka.

Google Books gives some results, too. E.g., Abhijit Ghosh: Non-Aryan 
linguistic elements in the Atharvaveda: a study of some words of Austric 
origin. Calcutta: Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 2000, p. 158 (for jhaka?aka).

Hope it helps
