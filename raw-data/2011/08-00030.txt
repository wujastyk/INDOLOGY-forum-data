Ad 2: for EUR 12.45 (around USD 18) you can get a PDF directly from the publisher:
URL: <http://www.shaker.de/de/content/catalogue/index.asp?lang=de&ID=8&ISBN=978-3-8440-0121-1&search=yes>
(It's a non-print PDF, I guess)

Ad 1: e.g. a review by Konrad Klaus, in ZDMG 161 (2011), p. 216 seq.

Hope it helps
