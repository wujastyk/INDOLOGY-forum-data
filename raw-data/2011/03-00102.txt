Dear Dominic,

I think your hypothesis is strong. The one text I thought of that  
might weaken it is the Vaikh?nasasm?rtas?tra. I have only Caland's  
translation with me, not the Sanskrit text, from which it would appear  
that, in the few references to breath retention, recaka/p?raka/ 
kumbhaka are not used.

(By the way, the Yogay?j?avalkya mentioned by Christophe is not very  
old - 13th century or later. It borrows many verses from the  
Vasi??hasa?it?, which itself is derivative of P??car?tra  
Sa?hit?s such as the Ahirbudhnya and P?dma.)

In later ha?hayogic works there is a confluence of three types of (or  
theories behind) breath retention: (1) the ancient (and not  
specifically yogic) tradition of regulated breathing or pr???y?ma  
which is thought to get rid of karma and physical impurity; (2) a  
yogic principle that links the breath, the mind and semen - by  
stopping one, the others are also stopped; (3) specific methods of  
inhalation and exhalation known as kumbhakas (somewhat paradoxically  
since kumbhaka of course means the holding of the breath) which have  
various effects on the subtle body. The latter are first found in the  
c.13th century Gorak?a?ataka (a different text from the one better  
known by that name but which was originally called the  
Vivekam?rta??a). They include techniques such as ujj?y?, in  
which a rasping noise is made during inhalation, and bhastrik?, in  
which the yogin is to breathe in and out rapidly, like a pair of  
bellows.

The terms recaka/p?raka/kumbhaka are used for all three types. To  
hijack your question, Dominic, I wonder if you or anyone else might  
have an answer to a question I have been pondering recently. Why do  
all the ha?hayogic kumbhakas have feminine names when kumbhaka is  
itself masculine? What might be their referent?

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim
