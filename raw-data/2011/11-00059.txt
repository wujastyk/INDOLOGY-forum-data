Dear Jan,

I already responded to you about this off-List, and also about other issues you've asked about (especially the Gandharan thesis that Michael W. and I developed, re. new ways of dating Vedic manuscripts). 

But to rehearse all the arguments about the fake bark manuscript (made in the 21st century!) is superfluous, since many of us now have discussed the obvious evidence that it is a fake on the Indo-Eurasian Research List, starting with message #15562. 

Our archives are open to everyone, not closed. Just go here:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indo-Eurasian_research/

Then click on "messages." You'll also find info there on joining the List, if you want. We aren't an Indology list per se -- we deal with cross-cultural issues in antiquity -- but many Indologists are among our core members. 

To go right to the messages, go here:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indo-Eurasian_research/messages

Note that there are messages quoted in there on the faked manuscript from the writer of the BA thesis (who wrote me yesterday saying she knew it was a forgery) and others iI've mentioned.

What is the motive in making such a forgery? Well, what would a *real* Indus manuscript -- quite impossible -- be worth? As Asko Parpola notes in a message quoted on our List (by Naga Ganesan), when manuscripts that Askop says are written in the same hand as this fake went on the market in London (around 2003) the price was millions of pounds. 

If the thing were legitimate and not a clumsy fake, it would be solid evidence of "writing" in the Indus Valley, and as the earliest Indian "writing" would be bought for millions and displayed with nationalistic pride in New Delhi.

Do look at the arguments presented by many people (me, Michael, Richard Sproat, others) in the IER List. On earlier, possibly related, forgeries on bark of "Indus manuscripts," see this newsletter from 2003, posted on our List by Ron Davidson of Fairfield University:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indo-Eurasian_research/message/15568

I second Ron's comments about how distressing it is that any serious researcher could get "suckered" into thinking this obvious fake is real.

Best,
Steve

The signs are based on modern redrawings or linearized/computerized "fonts" of the sort we find in modern studies from the time of Hunter 1929 to Mahadevan 1977 to Parpola 1994 to Wells, etc., and not on study of legitimate Indus artifacts.

Just looking at the photographs provided in Zuberbuehler's paper, it appears to me that the chance of such material surviving from the Indus Valley period is remote, but the "manuscript" is most likely older than the modern archaeological discovery of the Indus Civilization, and perhaps similar in date to the box itself, namely 16th century A.D.  If that be the case, it is still astounding that the knowledge of the Indus characters in some form had continued in some remote corners till the 16th century.  Even if it be later than the 16th century, but older than the modern discovery of Indus, we still have the same amazement.  Unless it turns out, by modern dating methods, to be later than the modern discovery of Indus Seals, one still needs to explain who had preserved/discovered these signs before the modern archaeologists, and what was he attempting to encode.  As we are more or less familiar with the languages used in this area in the 16th century, it may be worth investigating whether someone could attempt to write a language like Pashto or Dari, using an inventory of Indus signs as replacements for the elements of a more contemporary Perso-Arabic script.  In any case, this looks like an important find, and if more of such finds become available from that area, our understanding of the history of these signs may move further.  The whole thing becomes worthless if, by modern methods of dating, the "manuscript" turns out to be far more modern, and thus representing a post-Indus-discovery attempt by someone to create an Indus manuscript to further some disputed modern arguments.  (How would it end up in the Kabul museum?)  Only time will tell the true nature of this "manuscript".
