Dear Colleagues

I am hoping that one of you erudite folk might be able to remind me of the title of a recently published edited volume on Sanskritic 'peritexts', which includes a chapter with a title like, 'Why we should read pra?astas'.

Please reply off-list to mccomas.taylor at anu.edu.au

Thanks in advance

McComas
