Dear All:
2 Issues:
1) Does anyone know of any published reviews of Bronkhorst's /Greater 
Magadha/?

2) My library cannot get a hold of Kohler's new book Kavi im rgveda. 
Dichtung, Ritual und Schoepfung im fruhvedischen Denken Book Author 
(ISBN/ISSN: 978-3-8440-0121-1).

Here is the message:
"We have exhausted all possible ILL sources. There are no libraries that 
own this item that are ILL suppliers; I checked in OCLC, and the ISBN 
you supplied does not match any records. I also searched by title and 
was unsuccessful in my search. If you know of an institution that has 
this book, please let me know and I will contact them on your behalf."

Can anyone let me know how to get a copy of this new book? Do I have the 
details wrong? I think I took them off this list a few months back.


Cheers
JLW
