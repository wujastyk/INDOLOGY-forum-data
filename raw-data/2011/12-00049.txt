 From Professor Nagarajan Vadivel:
----------------------------------------------

Meghalaya's main ethnic communities, each having its own distinctive  
customs and cultural traditions are the Khasis (of Mon-Khmer  
ancestry), the Garos (of Tibeto-Burman origin) and the Jaintias said  
to be from South East Asia. The common trait binding all three  
communities is its matrilineal system in which the family linage is  
taken from the mother's side

The principal languages in Meghalaya are Khasi, Pnar and Garo with  
English as the official language of the State. It was at the  
initiative of the Christian missionaries that the Khasi, Pnar and  
Garo languages and literature have developed and emerged in the list  
of Modern Indian Languages.

The Khasi language is believed to be one of the very few surviving  
dialects of the Mon-khmer family of languages in India today.

  I am afraid that there is a mix up in the terms mentioned in the  
email.

?One of the drums collected was from the Khasi of Meghalaya, a wooden
kettledrum named by the Khasi as ka naakraa. Sachs traces the etymology
through Arabic, Persian, Hindustani/Urdu (naqqaara, which is  
correct), and
Skt. naagaraa (?).

A second drum from the Garo of western Meghalaya, a double-headed wooden
drum, has the Garo name dama, for which Sachs indicates 'zu sanskr.
daamaamaa' (?). In South Asian tradition, damaamaa is a Persian and Urdu
name for a very large metal kettledrum in Mughal India.

Wangala Festival


The Wangala is a Garo post-harvest festival that marks the end of the  
agricultural year. It is an act of thanksgiving to the sun god of  
fertility, known as Misi-A-Gilpa-Saljong-Galapa. A nagara (a special  
drum used for calling the people on solemn occasions) is beaten.  The  
men wear dhotis, half-jackets and turbans with feathers. The women  
wear colourful dresses made of silk, blouses and a head-wrap with  
feathers. The highlight of the festival is when 300 dancers and 100  
drums descend on the field in all their splendour in celebration.


The Khasis and Jaintias are particularly fond of songs praising the  
nature like lakes, waterfalls, hills etc. and also expressing love  
for their land. They use different types of  musical instruments like  
drums, duitara and instruments similar to guitar, flutes, pipes and  
cymbals.

As far as the written form is concerned the Kashi language is like  
Tamil has a huge repository of poems in oral form depicting the  
valor, love and devotion to nature.  Attempt was made to introduce  
the script to kashi using Sylhet Nagai. The people of Meghalaya did  
not adopt the Bengali script.  The Britishers who a charter with the  
ruler of Meghalaya developed the Roman script and the Roman script is  
currently used.

In the field of music due to its proximity to Hindi belt and due to  
the dominance of Persian in the area many words could have entered  
into the daily usasge words in the speech community. As indicated  
below damaru is an Indian term and not an Islamic term.  Since the  
inquiry is is on ethnomusicology the following passage will be of help

The invasion of India by Persian and the Mongolian armies brought in  
a newer stream, though contacts with these countries were centuries  
older. The mercantile, religious and martial connections of northern  
Indian with its bordering lands had been in existence from ages, and  
with these also were linked the exchange of music and instruments.  
Various flutes and drums as depicted in our own murals as well as in  
those of Central Asia, besides certain common words in music, bear  
ample testimony to this fact. But, a drastic encounter began by about  
the 11th Century A.D. from when what is termed the Islamic influence  
noticeable begins. However, it may not be correct to call all this  
Islamic, except for the Sufi content and spirit, just as it would not  
be right to think of a musical instrument as of Hindu origin, except  
the damaru, the veena and the venu which have definite associations  
with the pantheon. Be that as it may, along with the fresh ingress,  
developed different musical forms and quite possibly even instruments  
such as the daff, the sitar, the sarode and the shehnai were brought  
by these aliens.

While it has to be conceded that number of instruments have come to  
us from outside, it is equally true that quite a large number have  
also traveled out. The Far East received many instruments from India,  
mainly through traders and Buddhist monks who went on missionary  
work; so has the Middle West. As a matter of fact, the general  
consensus of opinion is that bowed instruments originated here and  
then migrated to various parts of the world. Again, from the 8th  
Century A.D. till about the 15th Yavadveepa and Suvarnadveepa  
(present Indonesia) were highly Indianized musically, which fact is  
revealed in the names of their old instruments: padahi (Skt. Pataha),  
murava (Skt. Muraja, Tamil murasu), vangsi (Skt. vamsi), kahala,  
ghanta and bheri.
