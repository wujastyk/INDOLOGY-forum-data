Although I can't claim any real knowledge of the history of the name, I 
do believe the first r to be a corruption, albeit a readily 
understandable one (ta-tar > tar-tar, by analogy), which could have 
occurred in Indian languages as well as in Latin. T?rt?ya does look 
rather odd, but the meaning would fit very well. Here is the snippet:

brahmadve?ituru?kasambhavam ida? t?rt?yaka? vidyate
??stra? [...]
