Dear members of the list,
 
I have come across an expression in the Kamasutra which leaves me completely
dumbfounded. In KS 5.6.25, I find the following:
 
( anyaizca jalabrahma+kSemaziraH+praNItairbAhyapAnakairvA ). 
 
This seems to be a marginal comment. I am unable to come up with a
translation of kSemaziras. Would anybody have a suggestion?
 
Best regards,
 
Lars Martin Fosse
