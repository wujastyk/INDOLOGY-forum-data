Thanks to all the scholars who responded to my call for help regarding
the Vedic concordance.  Since I no longer have access to a research
library (my former institution discontinued its Sanskrit program and
me with it), this sort of assistance--along with all the great web
resources available (again often due to the efforts of the scholars on
this list)--is what allows me to continue my research.
