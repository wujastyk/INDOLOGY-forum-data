Many thanks to Madhav, Patrick and Christophe for providing additional 
sources for the quotation 'vidy? ha vai ...'. I now have a rather 
different question:

In a late 16th-century text (the Pra?natantra attributed to N?laka??ha) 
I came across the two words jhaka?aka and bhaka?aka, which I have been 
unable to find in any dictionary. A Google search tells me that the 
former occurs in Samantabhadra's Ratnakara??a?r?vak?c?ra, but brings me 
no closer to a meaning. Any light on these two words would be most 
appreciated.

Martin
