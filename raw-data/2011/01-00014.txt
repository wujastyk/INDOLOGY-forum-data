Dear Colleagues,



I have the pleasure to announce that the Centre for Eurasiatic and
Afroasiatic Studies (CEAS) ? Bucharest, will hold its second Intensive
Course in Manuscriptology, 12-17 September 2011.

Please find below the relevant information.



Thanking you,

Associate Lecturer, University of Bucharest

The Second Intensive Course on Manuscriptology:





Title: History and development of North-Indian Scripts

(old N?gar? and early Devan?gar?)



Course Description:

Among ancient scripts, many scholars expect N?gar? to be a relatively

easy one because it is thought to be close to the well-known modern

form of Devan?gar?. However, in several respects old N?gar? and even

early Devan?gar? are closer to Br?hm?, early Gupta script and to the

sister script Siddham?t?k?  than to modern Devan?gar?. In order to

master old N?gar? and early Devan?gar? it is therefore important to

study them in their historical context.



The course will contain the following sections.

i. Introduction: the origin and development of scripts in ancient

India (northern branch);

ii. Learning, writing and reading the old N?gar? script;

ii. Learning the style and varieties of

a. old N?gar? (inscriptions to manuscripts);

b. early Devan?gar? (manuscripts) with p???am?tr?;

iii. Practice with the reading of manuscripts;

iv. A certificate will be provided for active and successful participation.
