Dear all, 

I'm searching for publications (or any other academic input), which deal or touch upon the topic of religious attitudes, rituals etc. concerning conception/ embryonal development/ birth and early childhood in India (past or present). 
I would be absolutely grateful for any hint or advice. 

best,
Andrey Klebanov
