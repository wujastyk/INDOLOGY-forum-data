Here is an interesting binary classification in two levels, though it  
doesn't situate humans in juxtaposition to the insentient, just to  
gods and animals.
The Kau?ika S?tra mentions "the mother of gods and mortal beings,"  
then, unpacking the latter term, "mortal beings," it specifies "mother  
of animals and men."

bhartr? dev?n?m uta marty?n?? bhartr? praj?n?m uta m?nu????m |  
(Kau?S_13,14[106].7)
[transliteration taken from Arlo Griffiths' GRETIL etext - thank you!]

I hope it helps.

CU 5.10.8 sets up a taxonomy of sorts in its reference to the ?small  
things? (kshudrANi) that continually live and die in the round of  
rebirth, in distinction to men who attain one of the two paths after  
death (path of the gods, path of the fathers).

Thanks Adheesh, I'd forgotten about "car?cara" (mobile/immobile), and  
thanks for the reference.

Can we state then that what we modern folks call inanimate objects, as  
well as plants, fit the acara category, and then all animals and  
humans fit the cara category?  Or are there other distinctions?

My linguist colleague has clarified that she's looking specifically  
for the linguistic taxonomy of this.

Cheers
James

     Dear James,

     In the epics, the phrase "car?cara" (mobile/immobile) is quite  
common--see for example Bhagavad-g?t? 10.39:
     yac c?pi sarvabh?t?n?? b?ja? tad aham arjuna |
     na tad asti vin? yat sy?n may? bh?ta? car?caram ||


     All best wishes,

     Adheesh
