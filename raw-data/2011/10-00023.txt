Subject: working emails for BORI, Baroda?
In-Reply-To: <CAB59521.B8E2%slindqui@smu.edu>
Message-ID: <161227094028.23782.1620606905355666988.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The present secretary of BORI is Dr Maitreyee Deshpande. I do not have her personal email address, but I have her Facebook email: <maitreyee.deshpande at facebook.com>


Alternately, one can contact Dr Shreenanda Bapat who is the assistant curator in BORI, on his email: <shreenandbapat at gmail.com>

BORI Contact numbers are:

020-25661363 (Secretary)
020-25656932 (Office)

Dr Mukund Wadekar's recent email is: <mlwadekar2008 at hotmail.com>

I hope that helps.

Best wishes.
