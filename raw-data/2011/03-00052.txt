I have looked through the on line-archive of this journal but this paper was not there.Any other enlightening materials on this difficult subject are also welcome! I am trying to write an entry about this subject for the Encyclopedia of Buddhist Philosophy which is under preparation in my Institute, but the more I read the less I understand: those whom I believed to be nirakaravadins seem to be sakaravadins, and vice versa.Best regards,Victoria LysenkoResearch Professor,Institute of PhilosophyRussian Academy of SciencesMoscow

All volumes of IBK from 1952 to 2007 are available here:
URL: <http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnltop_en.php?cdjournal=ibk1952>

And the article in question is here:
URL: <http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=ibk1952&cdvol=14&noissue=1&startpage=429>
Shortened URL: <http://tinyurl.com/69tofz7>

It is from the part of the journal with two different page numberings (p. 26-37 correspond to p. 429-418 of the Japanese numbering scheme).

Hope it helps
