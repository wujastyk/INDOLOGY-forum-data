Dear Colleague, 

I do not know if the following will be of any help.

The transformation from the pa?u-state to the ?i?u-s. and
then to ?iva-s. is dealt with in the ??rad?tilaka
and the Pad?rth?dar?a in the chapter on Kriy?vat? D?k??.

Some
studies were made by the present author in the seventies, published 1984. Pardon
unintended self-canvassing.

Best

DB

A colleague who is not on Indology has asked me a question to which I do not have a ready answer. So I promised him that I will post it on Indology, which generally elicits great answers from the pandit-network worldwide. The question relates to any studies done on the contrasting themes of "pa?ubh?va, v?rabh?va, and divyabh?va" -- I assume within the ?aiva-Tantrik traditions. Thanks for any leads.
