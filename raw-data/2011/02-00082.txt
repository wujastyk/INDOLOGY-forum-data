Dominik,


I would like to point out that in response to Patrick Olivelle's recent query regarding Dandin, no message was posted to the list. But Patrick has received many responses as mentioned by him in his second post. While there may be cases where people might send information offline deliberately, I wonder if any Indologists simply hit 'Reply' and the responses went to Patrick alone and not to the list.


Regards,
Palaniappan

Can we review this?  It's a change that was made in the default behaviour of
the INDOLOGY list, by popular request last year.  It annoys me a lot, but,
unlike Muammar al-Gaddafi, I'm perfectly willing to abide by the will of the
majority.

The problem we were trying to solve was private replies to colleagues on the
list that inadvertently became public.  Perhaps that is a greater danger
than the annoyance of posts not going to the list at all.

How do others feel?  Reply to sender, or reply to list at large?

Best,
Dominik
INDOLOGY committee member
