You may like to have a word to Christian Lindtner. Please say if you'd
like his email. I should perhaps mention that I have to hand a digital
version of Christian's edition. We were to make it freely available
but I didn't follow up with Adyar about permission. Perhaps something
could still be done if there is a need.


Kind regards,

 Richard
