Please note:

E-books added to the GRETIL e-library after July 5, 2011, are generated
according to a modified standard.

All GRETIL e-books produced before that date will be replaced with new
versions in due course.

 

It is recommended to replace e-books downloaded before July 5 with these new
versions as they become available. They are easily recognizable in the
catalogue by the "REVISION" notice (second line of each entry in the title
list).

 

Please, proceed as follows:

1) Open the GRETIL e-library catalogue:

http://opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de/DB=1.20/LNG=EN/

 

2) Click "All titles" in the left frame (grey).

This will generate a chronological title list, with the most recent additions
and/or revisions on top.

 

3) Check catalogue entries 3, 4, 9, 10, 13-15, 19 and 20 (#20 = Windisch:
Geschichte der Sanskrit-Philologie, REVISION #2, 5.7.2011).

[NOTE: These numbers are valid only from today, August 12, until the next
addition/revision! The present entries 21 to 213 will be revised in due
course. It is therefore recommended to check the OPAC regularly, or subscribe
to the RSS feed by clicking the icon in the left frame of the OPAC.]

 

4) To download the revised PDF file(s), click the respective catalogue entry,
and then click one of the two URLs at the bottom of that entry.
