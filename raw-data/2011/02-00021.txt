Dear colleagues,
Having failed to obtain any leads by consulting some individual colleagues, I now wish to consult you collectively about the term raajaku.tii, which I find in a few Cambodian inscriptions:
K. 95, st. XXXIX.= K. 309, st. XXXIX = K.362, st. XXXVI [all three inscriptions date to 811 "saka]?raajaku.tyantare raajadvijaatin.rpasuunava.hvi"seyur atra nirddo.san ta evaabhara.naanvitaa.h //?

K. 279 XCVIII = K. 290, st. XCVI = K. 701, st. XCVIII [all three inscriptions date to the 10th c. CE]dvau lekhakau raajaku.tiipaalau pustakarak.si.nautaambuulikau ca paaniiyahaarau .sa.t pattrakaarakaa.h //

This raajaku.tii may correspond to the vra.h ku.ti seen in some contemporary khmer-language inscriptions, although the term vra.h is ambiguous (it can mean both 'king' and 'god'). I also find the expression ku.ti haji,?which literally means 'king's?ku.ti', in an Old Malay inscription of Northern Sumatra (date ca. 10-11th c. CE).?Can anyone furnish comparative data from South Asia, or elsewhere, which may throw light on what these ancient Khmers and ancient Malays had in mind when speaking about a 'king's ku.ti/ii'?
Many thanks in advance. Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths (EFEO/Jakarta)
