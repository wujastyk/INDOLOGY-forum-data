Dear list,

A colleague asked me to spread the word about the following workshop:

The Department of Linguistics & Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is proud to host the second Formal Approaches to South Asian Languages (FASAL) workshop. The main aim of this workshop is to provide a platform to discuss South Asian Linguistics from the perspective of formal syntax, semantics and morphology.

Date: 17-Mar-2012 - 18-Mar-2012
Location: Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA
Deadline for submitting proposals: 23-Dez-2011

Please visit the workshop homepage for more information: http://linguistlist.org/callconf/browse-conf-action.cfm?ConfID=138423

Best,
Markus Viehbeck
