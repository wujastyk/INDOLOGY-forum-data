Is there any attested dvandva 'yoga-yoga' like which could prove that 
is is not only a plurality of meanings (polysemy) for one same word 
(so perceived by common Sanskrit speakers - I do not talk here about 
indigenous grammarians classifying different verbal root-derivatives, 
or 'yoga'-theoreticians commenting on the plurality of yoga-'real' 
techniques or ideas), being myself more than skeptical about a true 
'homonymy' in the narrow and common meaning of the word.
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
