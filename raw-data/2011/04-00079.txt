Dear all,

I recently came across a reference to the ?malaki fruit in the Buddhist 
/Mah?m?y?tantra/ and in its commentary, the /Gu?avat?/ by 
Ratn?kara??nti.  The citations are as follows:

First from the root tantra, in Tibetan (there is no extant Sanskrit 
manuscript): /lag tu skyu ru ra bzhag bzhin/.

Which Ratn?kara??nti glosses with: /svahaste sthitamekam?malakam 
yathetyartha?/

I initially took this to mean simply that the referent was as clear to 
the subject as a fruit placed in one's own hand.  However, two Tibetan 
colleagues both asserted that the /?malak?/ fruit, as understood in the 
Tibetan Buddhist tradition at least, is a translucent fruit which 
reveals its inner structure to the subject (not my personal experience 
with the contemporary version of Amalaki fruit).  Thus for a situation 
to be "like an /?malak?/ fruit in one's own hand" means one is able to 
see the referent inside and out, that is, in totality.  My question then 
is this:  is this analogy common in Indic traditions and, more 
importantly, are there any known references to these properties of the 
/?malak?/ in Sanskrit works?

Much thanks,

Ryan
