Dear friends,
Could anyone inform if H.M?ller's works on the laryngeals are available on the internet? Any information on the availability of further works on early Semitic laryngeals will be received with gratitude.
I have nothing post-Sturtevant-Kurylowicz with me.
Best wishes and thanks in advance

Dipak Bhattacharya
