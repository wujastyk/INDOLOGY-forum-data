Thank you, Professor Lubin, for your touching, eloquent, and much  
needed words, which I now forward to her family in case has not  
already been done. Beyond her
dissertation (Harvard 1983) which you mentioned, we owe to her  
translations of portions of several Vedic hymns in Sources of Indian  
Tradition (2nd Ed. Vol. 1 by A.T. Embree, S.N. Hay, and W.T. De Bary,  
1988): RV 9.62, 108 (pg. 15-16) and AV 4.17; 6.56 (pg. 22-24). I  
believe there were conference papers as well. For me, she was a  
patient mentor, harsh critic, deep inspiration, and dear friend, who  
is sorely missed.
-M. B. Jones

I hope you'll all indulge me a reply in a personal vein to Joanna's  
question about a dear friend now passed.

Lucy Bulliet was an eminently thoughtful and humane soul.  Her  
appreciation of .Rgvedic poetry was matched (or perhaps exceeded) only  
by her love of golden-age recordings of jazz.  Self-effacing to a  
fault and devoted to her family, she did not publish much after  
completing her dissertation on the V.rtra myth in the .Rgveda under  
Ingalls.  But her erudition bore fruit rather in her friendship and  
mentoring of a generation of students and young colleagues at Columbia.

Lucy certainly filled a crucial gap during my doctoral studies at  
Columbia when my interests led me toward the Veda.  She was always the  
only Vedic specialist around the university, and especially after  
Barbara Miller died and Brian Smith decamped for the West Coast, she  
was a great help and conversation partner in my Sanskrit studies  
during my time there.

Over the last two decades, she made several trips to India, especially  
Kolkata, to read with a scholar, and it was a great pleasure to meet  
up with her near the New Woodlands in Chennai.  She was always eager  
to discuss a difficult passage, and she brought to these discussions  
-- and to life in general -- patience, reflection, and a wry, often  
sardonic humor.  Those fortunate enough to know her are missing her  
singular voice.

Dear Professor Kirkpatrick (and list members),

I'm not sure if you are referring to the (planned) bibliography of
Lucy's library of indological volumes, a list of her publications, or
something else I am not aware of that she compiled as a bibliography.
Although neither of the first two are planned for publication per se,
either or both may certainly be shared (upon completion) individually
with members of the list by contacting me (mbjones at utexas.edu).
Further, a posthumous volume of an intended work of hers, an
(undergrad level) introduction to Vedic Religion, may eventually be
forthcoming, though at this point her progress has not been ascertained.

Thank you,
Michael Brattus Jones

May I ask, will her valuable Bibliography be published in another
obituary?
Or is there one somewhere on Columbia's website?

Thanks,

It is with great sadness that I pass along this obituary for Lucy
Bulliet, which was written by her husband Professor Richard
Bulliet of Columbia University.
