Subject: working emails for BORI, Baroda?

Many thanks indeed to everyone who has helped with the query!

The email address on BORI's website <http://www.bori.ac.in/contact.html>,
> bori1 at vsnl.net, doesn't work.

Recently given by Prof. Thite: bori at dataone.in
This doesn't cause email errors, at least.

Prof. M L Wadekar: mlwadekar2008 at hotmail.com

This works.  Prof. Wadekar and I are in communication.

Many thanks!
