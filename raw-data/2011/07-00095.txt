Dear Dominik,

Thank you for mentioning this. Irrespective of the intricate claims made by
these authors, it may be worth noting there are here analogous
arguments regarding pirate legitimacy which somehow survived from a history
of 17th-18th European ideas about pirate/brigand practice, including in
colonial oceans. However, more about electronic storage, copyright issues
and the cost of newer knowledge in South Asian / Buddhist Studies research
is to be found in a splendid contribution by Marcus Bingenheimer -
'Collaborative Editions and Translations Projects in the Era of Digital
Texts', in Konrad Klaus (ed.), *Translating Buddhist Chinese Texts: Problems
and Prospects*, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2010: 21-43 (without reviews up to
now?). It is a relief for younger or not well connected or indeed all
researchers to conveniently follow grand scholars like e.g. Johannes
Bronkhorst or Guy Stroumsa or yourself - as they made readily available for
free their recent contributions.

kind regards
Eugen
