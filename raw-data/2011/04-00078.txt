Dear Jim,

?atarudr? (occurs also in the Matsyapur??a, see pw) is mentioned by 
Al-B?r?n? in his enumeration of rivers having their source in the Himavat 
(Sachau, Vol. 1: ch. 25).
Sircar identifies it with the ?atadru river (Geography of Ancient and 
Medieval India 1971: 51, n. 3).

> ?atarudr? might be a corruption of ?atadru ( = Sutlej).
?atadru/?dr? itself seems to be the result of post-vedic folk etymology 
(ved. ?utudr?, etc.), and the situation could have been similar with the 
formation of ?atarudr? (and possibly also with ?r?r?tri) as deliberate 
attempts of giving these rivers an easily comprehensible meaning. 
"Corruption" in the strict sense is perhaps not applicable to such names.


Best, Walter
