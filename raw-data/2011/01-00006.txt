Subject: looking for book "Goraksh Kimayagar"
Message-ID: <161227091265.23782.14637541749344505375.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A patron in India is looking for a book in Marathi or Hindi of the above title, which I am unable to find (under any plausible spelling in Nagari or romanization) in any bibliographies of the Gorakh Panth, nor in WorldCat.  Has anyone ever heard of it?

Thanks,

Allen
