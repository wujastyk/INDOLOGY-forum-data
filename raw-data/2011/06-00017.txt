Dear McTomas,

Therorise might be a bit of an overstatement word, but I did explore the
implications of phala?rutis in my masters thesis on the ?rya Sa?gh??a s?tra,
a Buddhist s?tra. Much of the s?tra itself can be read as an
extended phala?ruti. I found very little on the topic in the literature that
had been published at the time (2003).

If you are interested, it has the rather long title of *Reading the *Sa?gh
??as?tra: Time, Narrative and the Ethical Formation of Persons *in a
Mah?y?na Buddhist Text of Great Claims* and is available through the
University of Wisconsin-Madison library.  I can also direct you to an
electronic copy if you contact me off-list.

Warm regards,

Damcho Diana Finnegan
