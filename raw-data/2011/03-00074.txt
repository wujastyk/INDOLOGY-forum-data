Dear Dominik,

I hope you doing great. We at Knowledge Must have been very busy (as usual),
and have just launchend a new project, and besides the fact that we just
want to let you know about it, we are also always grateful for a little
assistance to spread the word...

This new project is called the "India Summer Program" and, in a nutshell,
it's a 4 weeks program with intensive Hindustani language training, seminars
on Indian Culture, Politics, and Society and unique excursions and field
trips in Delhi, and to Varanasi, Rishikesh, and Alwar.

All the facts about the program can be found at the newly launched website:
http://www.summerinindia.com and the detailed program can be downloaded from
here:

Looking forward to your feedback and many thanks for your interest.

Best regards,
Daniel
