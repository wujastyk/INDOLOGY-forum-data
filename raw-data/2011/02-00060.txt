Don't know if your student would be interested in this aspect at all  
-- to see if there is / are any difference(s) in the way in which  
different religious affiliations had impacted the nature of the curses.

For example, in the Tamil epic Cilappatikaram, a Jain nun curses two  
people to become "old jackals," whereas in Tamil inscriptions the  
curses normally center around sending the affected parties to "hell."
