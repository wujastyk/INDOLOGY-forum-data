Dear Adriano and list members,

I second Dominik's recommendations about XeTeX.  There is also an email list specifically for Ledmac and Ledpar: <https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ledmac-users>.  I will send Adriano and any other interested party an example file using Ledpar for a parallel edition of verses.  Please write to me off-list.  

Best,

You can type Devanagari directly, or you can type using the Velthuis encoding (aasiidraajaa, k.r.s.na.h), or standard scholarly romanisation (IAST).  The Velthuis or IAST can be converted automatically into Devanagari by XeTeX itself.

Your difficulty with the stanza environment in LEDMAC is a TeX problem, not an indological one, and you'll have much more luck with responses if you send your question to the main TeX discussion forum, called comp.text.tex.  Questions about LEDMAC are commonly asked and answered there (e.g., here).

Could anyone give me a hand on that?
