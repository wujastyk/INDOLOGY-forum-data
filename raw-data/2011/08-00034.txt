*Time of India: 'The East has been deeply influenced by
India'*<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/opinion/edit-page/The-East-has-been-deeply-influenced-by-India/articleshow/9570043.cms?intenttarget=no>

The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) has opened a centre in the
South Korean capital Seoul and set up a chair of Sanskrit at the Preah
Sihanouk Raja Buddhist University in Cambodia. These initiatives are part of
the Indian government's 'Look East' policy. ICCR president Karan Singh
talked with Shobhan Saxena about India's growing soft power and need for
more engagement with countries in our extended neighbourhood.
