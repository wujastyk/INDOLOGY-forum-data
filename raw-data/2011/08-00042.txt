A?oka's Edicts again.

Another broad taxonomical division appears in the text of Pillar Edict II.

Delhi-Topra version (Hultzsch,line E): dupada-catupadesu
pakhi-vAlicAlesu vividhe me anugahe kaTe [...].

Amulyachandra Sen's Sanskritized text: dvipada-catuSpadeSu
pakSi-vAricareSu vividhaH mayA anugrahaH kRtaH [...]

- and his translation: "On bipeds and quadrupeds, on birds and aquatic
animals, various benefits have been conferred by me [...]".

It's not clear whether the category "bipeds" includes also monkeys and
apes, and whether animals such as crayfish or water insects are
included in the category of "aquatic animals".
