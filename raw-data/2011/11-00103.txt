Dear Friend,
After much hesitation I bring to your notice the some very old publications. In fact my present studies are far removed from the subject mentioned by you. The books mentioned below were studied during student days just out of curiosity without any professional zeal. There is, moreover, every possibility of their being out dated. That is the reason for my hesitation. Please inform if you found them of any help.

Influence of Islam on Indian Cultureby Tara Chand, The Indian Press, Allahabad, 1936 particularly from p.49
Glimpses of medieval Indian Culture Yusuf Husain, Asia Publishing House, 1958??

Dear list members,
I was asked the following question by a student: Are there any comparative studies that treat Hindu and Sufi ritual?
I would be very grateful ?for any hint to such a study.
Yours,
