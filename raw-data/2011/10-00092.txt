Actually Monier-Williams simply defines adhara-svastika as "the nadir." The reference to Maitr?ya??-sa?hit? concerns the previous term: adhara-sapatna.
See http://tinyurl.com/6fadbuq bottom right.

I'm not familiar with the term -- perhaps someone else can help (adhara itself means low, inferior, nadir; not sure what svastika indicates here).

  According to Monier Williasms,  adhara-svastika is a compound word given the Maitrayani Samhita. But I cannot find the word in the text. I wonder if any body is familiar with this word.
