Dear colleagues,
I have at my disposal here in Jakarta a very mediocre xerox of the item below, and it does not include the title-page allowing me to confirm all bibliographic data. I'd like to have a clean and complete xerox or, better still, a PDF file. I have asked our library in Paris, but the volume is not available there. 
Can anybody else oblige?
Many thanks in advance.
