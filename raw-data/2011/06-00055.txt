 Dear Colleagues,

Please excuse me for mentioning a new publication to which I have
contributed. A two-panel gathering was held in October 2010 at the 39th
Annual South Asia Conference in Madison, WI that was conceived to coincide
with the roughly half a century since the completion of the Pune Critical
Edition of the *Mahabharata*. Seven of the papers from that conference have
been updated and comprise, along with an Introduction, the latest issue of
the *Journal of Vaishnava Studies* 19,2 (2011) under the overall heading
"Mahabharata Conference." The contents are:

Vishwa P. Adluri, Introduction: The Critical Edition and Its Critics, A
Retrospective on Mahabharata Scholarship

T. P. Mahadevan, The Three Rails of the Mahabharata Text Tradition

Christopher Austin, Evaluating the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata:
Inferential Mileage and the Apparatus Materials

Alf Hitebeitel, On Sukthankar's 'S" and Some Shortsighted Assessments and
Uses of the Pune Critical Edition (CE)

Joydeep Bagchee, Inversion, Krsnafication, Brahmanization: The Explanatory
Force of Some Extraordinary Figures of Speech

Vishwa P. Adluri, Frame Narratives and Forked Beginnings: Or, How to Read
the Adiparvan

Wendy J. Phillips-Rodriguez, The Critical Edition: The End of Mahabharata
Textual Scholarship?

Simon Brodbeck, Analytic and Synthetic Approaches in the Light of the
Critical Edition of the Mahabharata and Harivamsa
