Dear Prof. Dehejia

If you mean by mind what is referred to in the Brahmanical schools (or in ?aivism) as sa?vit, sa?vedana, cit, cetan?, caitanya, j??na etc. (consiousness, cognition), I doubt you will find such a statement since the view is that these are ontologically utterly distinct from the body.

If you mean by mind what the Naiy?yikas and Vai?e?ikas term the manas (a faculty of attention that provides a link between the self and the particular sense faculty whose data is being attended to), this was not regarded as forming a `continuum' with the body in any usual sense of that term.

The four mental skandhas in Buddhism are not usually characterised as forming a continuum with the r?paskandha, but rather a conglomerate (samud?ya) or a causal complex (s?magr?).

If you mean the buddhi or manas or aha?k?ra in S??khya, or the combination of all three, at least here they fall on the same side of the fundamental divide between puru?a and prak?ti, as does j??na according to this tradition.

But your best bet may be C?rv?ka/Bh?tacaitanyav?da contexts:

1) Ontological Continuity

One `C?rv?ka s?tra' was  
tebhya? caitanyam to which it is claimed (for example by Kamala??la and Prabh?candra) that commentators supplied either utpadyate or abhivyajyate, of which the former serves your purpose best:
`Conscious emerges from the [material elements].'

The Sarvadar?anasa?graha clarifies:
tatra p?thivy?d?ni bh?t?ni catv?ri tattv?ni.  tebhya eva deh?k?rapari?atebhya? ki?v?dibhyo mada?aktivac caitanyam upaj?yate.
`There the elements, earth and [water, fire and air]' are the four tattvas.  Consciousness emerges from them alone when they have been transformed into the form of a body, as alcohol's power to intoxicate emerges from ki?va [yeast, molasses] etc. [when they are mixed in suitable proportions, even though they are not intoxicating separately or when combined in the wrong proportions, just as matter is not conscious when not transformed into the shape of a body].

2) Continuity in the sense of necessity of mutual influence

Ny?yama?jar?, Vol II, p. 289, Mysore edition:

nanu j??nam api tadanvayavyatirek?nuvidh?yi pr?ye?a d??yate. bh?te?v annap?n?dyupayogapu??e?u pa?v? cetan? bhavati, tadviparyaye viparyaya?. br?hm?gh?t?dyupayogasa?sk?te ca kum?ra?ar?re pa?upraj?at? j?yate.
	 ...
caitanye ca gurul?ghavavyavah?ro 'pi bh?t?ti?ayasadasattvak?to bhavi?yati.

[C?rv?ka:] We can observe that for the most part consciousness conforms to positive and negative concomitance with the body.  When the elements [in our body] are well nourished by the consuming of food and drink etc., consciousness becomes sharp; and when the elements are not nourished, the opposite kind of consciousness arises.  And when the body of a young boy is purified by the eating of things like the ayurvedic concoction called br?hm?gh?ta, the boy becomes sharp-minded.
...
And the linguistic usage of heaviness and lightness referring to consciousness can be caused by the existence or non-existence of excellence in the elements. 

3) Continuity in the sense that mental attributes arise from physical attributes:

Tattvasa?grahapa?jik?, avatara?ik? to verse 1960:

?le?ma?a? sak???d r?ga?, pitt?d dve?a?, v?t?n moha iti.

If you would like information on secondary literature on these C?rv?ka views (e.g. by Franco, Preisendanz, Steinkellner, Namai, Ramkrishna Bhattacarya), or more Sanskrit passages, let me know.

Yours Alex
