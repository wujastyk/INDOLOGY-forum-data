Dear Sir!

In the University of Salamanca we have decided to commemorate with an
International Conference the official beginning of Oriental Studies in
Europe, which is the "Canon" of Pope Clemens at the Vienne Concile 1311
(exactly 7 centuries ago) urging the Universities of Salamanca, Bologna,
Paris and Oxford to teach oriental languages, concretely Hebrew, Arabic
and "Chaldaean".

Our main aim is to put in contact Spanish Oriental Studies with the
European ones. We have had a long tradition of Semitic Studies, but other
oriental cultures and languages have only a brief and difficult tradition,
because of the rigidity of our University system. Notwithstanding there
have developed several research teams, mainly about India, Iran, China,
Japan and Philippines. Wee would like to present theses studies and to
discuss with our colleagues of other countries the actual developments and
the role of Oriental Studies in modern societies.

I attach You our "call for papers" and I beg You to include it in Your
Home Page and to broadcast it among the members of IASS.

Thank You in advance.

Sincerely Your's

Ana Agud
Prof. for Indoeuropean Studies
University of Salamanca, Spain
