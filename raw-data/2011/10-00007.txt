Subject: RORI 2007 catalogue of Bharatpur collection
Message-ID: <161227093970.23782.15861605647471119277.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues,

Does anyone happen to have easy access to the RORI MS catalogue of their
Bharatpur collection, published in 2007?  I wish to know whether the
Bharatpur collection contains any MSS of the Carakasamhita, and I'm finding
it hard to get that particular catalogue volume.

Best wishes,
Dominik
