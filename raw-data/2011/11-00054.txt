70th Dhammachai Scholarship for Gandhari Studies

at the University of Washington

 

Description of the Fellowship

The Department of Asian Languages and Literature, University of Washington (Seattle WA) announces the inception of the 70th Dhammachai Scholarship, sponsored by the Dhammachai International Research Institute. This scholarship will be offered to a qualified applicant to the graduate program in Buddhist Studies in the Department of Asian Languages and Literature whose studies will focus on research on Buddhist texts in Gandhari under the auspices of the department's Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project. The scholarship will offer up to five years of full support, conditional on satisfactory annual progress.

 

The Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project

The Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project was founded in 1996 to promote the study and publication of newly discovered Buddhist manuscripts in the Gandhari language, dating from the first century b.c.e. to the third century c.e. The manuscripts contain a wide variety of Buddhist texts and genres including sutra, abhidharma, avadana, commentaries and scholastic treatises. For further information, please see the project's website at http://ebmp.org/. 

            

Prerequisites for the Scholarship

The holder of the 70th Dhammachai Scholarship will be expected to pursue research on one or more of the unpublished Gandhari manuscripts, with a view to preparing a scholarly edition and translation. The holder will need to have a suitable background in Buddhist Studies and one or more of the relevant languages, including Sanskrit, Pali, and Chinese. Previous knowledge of the Gandhari language is not required, but will be a focus of the awardee's studies in the first few years in the program.
