dear all,
I am happy to announce the new publication ?????????????????????? by
prof. KV Ramakrishnamacharya, prof. of Vyakarana, RS Vidyapeetha
Tirupati. (??????????????????????, ???????????????????????????????????
214, ?????????????????????? 11,???????????????????????????, ???????,
2010, ??????? ??.300. ??.XXIV+353)

This book aims at the critical exposition of the ?????????????? of
Koundabhatta of bhattojidikshita school. ?????????????? is an
important work from Vaiyakaranas dealing with philosophy of panini's
grammar.

this is the enlarged edition of the book ??????????????  published in
1996.   chapter no. second is enlarged with newly included
?????-?????????-??????????????-??????????????????-???????????????-?????????????-??????????????????
etc. but most importantly a whole third chapter is newly included in
this edition which i think is the most important point.
This third chapter consists of author's critical expositions on the
difficult sentences of ??????????????. this kind of exposition was
long overdue, and ably authored by a teacher who taught the ???????
for over thirty years.
each of the topics dealt in ??????? are critically examined in a
historical way and in each point of disagreement the opinions of
Naiyayikas and Meemamsakas are critically observed.
I hope this work will be made a text/reference book for the
Bhushanasara classes everywhere.
One fine point I observed in the book in a quick glance is that
prof. KV Ramakrishnamacharya deviated from tread path of traditional
vaiyakaranas on Sphota. he clearly dismisses the hypothetical
extra-sensory sphota and accepted the observable sphota that is
??????? ??????? ????? ?????? ?????????.... ??????????  ??????????????
?????????? ? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????
???????????????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????????????????
(??.285)
true, prof. KV Ramakrishnamacharya never clinged to traditions.

I request to all the senior scholars to write new works like on the
difficult texts of indian hardcore shastras so the fine points of the
texts observed by these senior scholars can be grasped by younger
ones.
