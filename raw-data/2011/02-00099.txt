If you use Mac Mail, it's actually about 5 steps, to Reply All and then remove the individual sender's email and move the 'Indology' address from 'cc.' to 'to'. That's not counting the original 2 when you accidentally reply just to the individual and then delete it. When I get emails that are not meant to be public, I stop reading and delete them as soon as I realise. I would hope that we'd all do that.

As I said then, of the 8 or so professional lists I belong to (some moderated, some not; some with 'reply to list,' some not), I had never received anywhere near the number of accidental emails (or radically inappropriate emails for public consumption) as on this one.

While it is true that occasionally a member sends a private message and broadcasts it to the world, I suspect it is infrequent enough (and sometimes so "interesting"), that the alternative is not really satisfactory.
