Regarding Professor Silk's helpful message, I would like to add that a
wonderful lot of photos of the same and later periods of ASI are still
preserved in Paris, in the Soci?t? Asiatique, within the Fonds Alfred
Foucher.

Some mentions, including some data on Vogel's connections with the French
school of Buddhist Studies, are offered in Annick Fenet's recent
publications, esp. in her *Arch?ologie militante* on Foucher, DAFA, and the
exploration in Buddhist Afghanistan (M?moires de l'Acad?mie des Inscriptions
et Belles-Lettres, 2009), or in the Proceedings of a Journ?e d'?tudes,
edited by Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat and the late Jean Leclant (also Paris:
AIBL/De Boccard 2009).

with kind regards,
Eugen
