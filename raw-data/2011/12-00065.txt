Dear members of the list,

 

Once again, I am forwarding a message from Brian Akers, who is not on
Indology. If anyone can help, he'd be delighted.

 

Best regards,

Big thanks to Lars for posting my request, and an even bigger thanks to
Steven Lindquist for his helpful suggestion. Unfortunately, I made the
switch to OS X about four years ago and no longer have that file on my
computer. I still have the original floppy disk that I purchased twenty
years ago, but now none of our computers have a floppy-disk drive!

I realize that what I'm asking for is a bit of a hassle, so I'd be delighted
to send the first person living in the United States who sends the updated
Ecological Linguistics Devanagari font for Mac OS X to sfauthor at aol.com a
complete set of our paperbacks <http://www.yogavidya.com/complete.html> in
appreciation.

Brian Dana Akers
