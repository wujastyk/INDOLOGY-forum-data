Thanks to George Cardona, Artur Karp, John William Nemec, Asko Parpola, Judit T?rzs?k and Vincent Eltschinger for their responses.
I should have made it clear that it was not so much the element ku.tii which bothered me, as I tacitly assumed there to be a connection with the Buddhist gandhaku.tii 'Perfume Chamber' (the chamber for the principal Buddha resident in a monastery) --- at least the monumental context of the Sumatran ku.ti haji is certainly Buddhist.
