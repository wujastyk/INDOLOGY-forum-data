Dear Prof Tieken,

Thanks so much. 

Let me clarify; I am looking for an introductory modern spoken Tamil text for American undergraduates. A textbook that would cover an introduction to script, basic grammar, drills, etc. Something on a par with Usha Jain's Introduction to Hindi Grammar.

Warm Thanks from Chilly Delhi,

Mary

As to a grammar, I find Thomas Lehmann's grammar very useful: A Grammar of Modern Tamil. Pondichery Institute of Linguistics and Culture. As far as I know, however, it is out of print.
