Dear Colleagues,
The follwoing does not inform about Sanskrit translation but may be of interest. The earliest translation of Shakespeare into an Indian language is perhaps the Bengali translation Bhr?nti-vil?s (Comedy of Errors) by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820-1891) published around 1860 at Calcutta. Vidyasagar?s contemporaries like like Michael Madhusudan Dutta imitated Shakespeare and Ramnarayan Tarkaratna followed the Sanskrit dramaturgy in dramas written by himself. Before them Gerasim Lebedev (1749-1817) translated some European/English farces into Bengali. I miss the exact details. I wonder if he had?translated Shakespeare.

There is a Sanskrit "adaptation" of Hamlet by S. D. Joshi and V. Deo:
Candrasenah? Durgades?asya Yuvara?jah? : Sanskrit adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the prince of Denmark / by S.D. Joshi and Vighnahari Deo. - Pune : University of Poona, 1980. - (Publications of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit., Class G ; no. 1)

Macbetht:
Meghavedham : Maha?kaveh? S?eksapi?yaramahodayasya 'Maikabaith' iti na?t?akamadhikr?tya pran?i?tam / pran?eta?, Mohanaguptah?. - Dilli?, Bha?rata : Jn?a?nabha?rati? Pabl., 2009. - xvi, 110 p.

The Merchant of Venice:
Ven?i?s?a sa?rthava?ha = Merchant of Venice / by William Shakespeare [sic] ; anuva?daka Ananda Tripa?t?hi? S?arma?. - Gan?ja?maman?d?alam : S?armma?, 1969. - 3, 2, 115 p. - (S?iks?a?priya granthama?la?ya?[h?], pus?pam 3)

As you like it (by the same translator):
Yatha? te rocate = As you like it / by William Shakespeare ; anuva?daka Ananta Tripa?thi S?arma?. - Brahmapurama : S?iroman?i Mudra?s?a?la?, 1969. - 114 p. - (S?iks?a?priyagranthama?la?ya?, pus?pam 4)

Romeo and Juliet
U?thika? : Shakespeare Romeo-Julieta?s?rita? Sam?skr?itana?t?ika? / sana?tanasya S?ri?-Reva?prasa?da-Dvivedinah?. - Va?ra?n?asi? : Chaukhambha? Orientalia, 1978. - 74 p. - (Gokulada?sa Sam?skr?ta granthama?la?, 31)

I remember that I have seen a Sanskrit version of Lamb's Shakespeare's tales somewhere. But that is not the original, of course.

This collective volume contains some informations on Shakespeare in Indian translations:
India's Shakespeare : translation, interpretation, and performance / ed. by Poonam Trivedi and Dennis Bartholomeusz. - Delhi, India : Pearson Longman, 2005. - 270 p. ISBN 8177581317

Hope it helps
