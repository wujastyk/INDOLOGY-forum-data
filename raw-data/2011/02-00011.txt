Dear Allen,
There is a gentleman in Gujarat, Dr Wakanker, who has done much research on traditional Indian games.  Would you like me to put you in touch?
If carrom boards are of interest, there is at least one manufacturer that I have used in Bangalore.  Again I can dig out the details if helpful.
Best,
Venetia
