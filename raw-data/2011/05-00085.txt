Subject: Translations of Rig Veda Suparna Sukta (RV I.164)
Message-ID: <161227092624.23782.12728266609425318346.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A colleague asked me for recommended translations of the? Rig Veda Suparna Sukta (RV I.164).

I've been meaning to get around to working with it myself but, like so many things, I haven't gotten around to it.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Best,

Dean
