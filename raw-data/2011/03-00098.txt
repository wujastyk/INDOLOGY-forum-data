Dear list,

I hope you won't mind a another terminological discussion related to yoga !

Is it known when the terminology of recaka, p?raka/p?ra?a, kumbhaka first started to be used for pr???y?ma ?

It seems that the Yogas?tra (2.49) and Yogabh??ya speak rather of ?v?sa and pra?v?sa (in 2.49).  

In the tradition of commentaries on the s?tras perhaps it is the Yogabh??yavivara?a which first uses the recaka-p?raka-kumbhaka terminology ?

Kau??inya?s Pa?c?rthabh??ya (on P??upata 1.16) refers to recaka and p?ra?a. Are there other attestations likely to be earlier than the Yogabh??yavivara?a ?
