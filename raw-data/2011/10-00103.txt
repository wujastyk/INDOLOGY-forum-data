McGill University's Indian Ocean World Centre 
(http://www.indianoceanworldcentre.com/) invites applications for a 
doctoral fellowship for the study of the transmission of ideas either 
within the Indian Ocean World (i.e., any region(s) from Africa to the 
Middle East to South and Southeast Asia to China) or between the Indian 
Ocean World and other cultures, such as Arabic or Chinese. Among the 
possible subjects of investigation are: logic and debate, grammar, 
mathematics and astronomy. The successful candidate is expected to have 
a good reading knowledge of one or more of the relevant languages. 
Interested applicants should send Prof. Brendan Gillon 
(brendan.gillon at mcgill.ca) a two-page outline of a project proposal and 
a CV. The proposal must make clear how it fits with project and the 
subjects of investigation listed above. The successful candidate's 
department of affiliation will depend on his or her
project and background. Possible departments of affiliation are: the 
Department of Philosophy (www.mcgill.ca/philosophy/), the Institute for 
Islamic Studies (www.mcgill.ca/islamicstudies/, the Department of East 
Asian Studies (http://www.mcgill.ca/eas/) and the Department of History 
(www.mcgill.ca/history/). The successful applicant must meet the 
criteria for admission to the relevant department and complete its 
degree requirements, but will be working under the partial or complete
supervision of Prof. Gillon.

The deadline for application is January 15th, 2012 and the fellowship 
will start in the Fall of 2013.
