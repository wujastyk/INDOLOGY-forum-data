Many thanks to all who responded to my query so far. I have consulted Weber's work, and now find that I need to qualify my original question somewhat.

Weber (1887: 21) gives a list of Sanskritization of Persian phonemes in the P?ras?prak??a (c. 1600). However, this list does not quite tally with the examples I have seen in Sanskrit astrological works dating (probably) from the 13th century or earlier. One obvious possible explanation is that pronunciation had changed over the intervening centuries.

My modified question, therefore, must be: what are the earliest documented examples (preferably lists) of Sanskritized Persian or Arabic words after, say, 1000 CE?

Vidvajjanaday?p?tram,

Martin Gansten
