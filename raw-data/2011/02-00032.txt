>From a practical point of view: the numbers and sun serve to frame the central image (the numbers thematically next to other numbers on one side -- 5 Rs and year; bh?rat/India, sw?stika, sun, and name on the other side).  The sun, the manuscripts on the ground, and bh?rat/India especially keeps the overall image from being "left heavy".  More perfect symmetry might put "India" further down (or P??ini himself more towards the center), but visually that might look overly contrived.
