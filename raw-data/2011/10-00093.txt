>>TEXT OF THE PETITION
>>
>>To: Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi
>>
>>We express our profound shock that the Delhi 
>>University Academic Council has decided to drop 
>>A.K. Ramanujan?'s highly acclaimed essay on 
>>many Ramayanas from the B.A. History course. 
>>The late Professor Ramanujan is recognized all 
>>over the world as one of the most eminent 
>>authorities on pre-modern literature and 
>>culture. The essay "Three Hundred Ramayanas: 
>>Five Examples and Three Thoughts" shows in rich 
>>detail how Indian culture is constituted of a 
>>multiplicity of traditions, how it speaks with 
>>many voices. It is an essay that all young 
>>people, not just history students, ought to 
>>read. To delete it from the syllabus is an act 
>>that is deeply disturbing, an instance of 
>>thought policing. Such a measure will only 
>>encourage sectarian groups to try and prevent 
>>intellectuals from expressing their ideas 
>>freely. The action of the Vice Chancellor and 
>>the Academic Council is particularly 
>>distressing since it overrules the majority 
>>opinion of the Expert Committee that was set up 
>>(under the direction of the Supreme Court) to 
>>look into the controversy.
>>
>>Sincerely,
>>
>>EMAIL SUMMARIZING THE CASE

>>Subject: Protest Letter agains the removal of 
>>AK Ramanujan's essay on the Ramayanas
>>
>>Dear all,
>>
>>Many of you may know that for some time now a 
>>controversy has been brewing in Delhi 
>>University around Ramanujan's essay on many 
>>Ramayanas. This essay was part of the readings 
>>in one of the B.A. history courses. Over a year 
>>back some Hindutva activists attacked teachers 
>>in the DU history department and demanded that 
>>the essay be removed from the reading list. The 
>>history department teachers, of course, refused 
>>to comply. The issue ended up in the Supreme 
>>Court which wanted the opinion of an academic 
>>expert committee. Three out of the four members 
>>of the committee stated that the essay ought to 
>>be read by students. Recently the Vice 
>>Chancellor and the Academic Council overruled 
>>the opinion of the history department, as well 
>>as the expert committee and removed the essay 
>>from the list of recommended readings.
>>
>>best,
>>
>>Anubhuti
