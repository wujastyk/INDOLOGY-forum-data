Dear list,

In my research on the Vedic schools of Mah?r???ra I have come across the
claim from many ?gvedins reciters that they study the so-called* Da?agrantha
*s as their curriculum. These ten 'books' are: Sa?hit?, Br?hma?a,
?ra?yaka, ?ik??,
Kalpa, Vy?kara?a, Nigha??u, Nirukta, Chandas and Jyoti?a. An alternative
list include the pada and krama (recitations), instead of Nigha??u and ?ra?yaka
but give the list in a slight different order. Someone who claims to master
these "ten books" is entitled to the name da?agranthin/da?agranth?.

Does anyone here know how this particular list came to be put together? Why
are these the "ten books of the ?gveda"? Does anyone know of a ?gvedin who
actually recites all these texts from memory? It seems that today it has
become not more than a prestigious title (and a inherited family name)
without the actual knowledge it is supposed to designate.

Any clues and suggestions towards more clarity on the subject would be much
appreciated.

Greetings,
