Subject: SRI CAKRA PAMPHLET READY

          Re:  Pamphlet on Sri Cakra-Sri Vidya 
           
          I'm sorry but  the names and addresses of  the  3  people besides 
          Doug Brooks who took up my offer of copies of the pamphlet on the 
          proper way of constructing the Sri Cakra: 
           
          Caturvedi, Candrasekhara 
          Tantrik varg  se nirnay ki  mang  :  Sri Vidya mantra ka visuddha 
          svarup? 
          Mathura : Rajesvari Press, n.d. 
           
          have  dropped  off  my  computer files.   (I  have  extended  the 
          retention period of all of them) 
           
          The photocopies are  ready.  Could anyone wanting a  copy  please 
          contact  me  directly  (not  through INDOLOGY) with  their  snail 
          addresses?   I do have Doug's address. 
           
          Apologetically
