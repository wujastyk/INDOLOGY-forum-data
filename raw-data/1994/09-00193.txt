Dear fellow list-members
Since I raised this issue some time ago, there has been a large 
volume of mail on this network and a small amount of it has been 
quite useful to me. I am very grateful to those people who contributed
to the discussion and suggested reference works that I could peruse.
I am sorry that some of the discussion has produced some 
unpleasantness and a rather unsavoury and totally unnecessary 
pollution of the normally pristine academic information-exchange.Such,
unfortunately is life.
Having perused many of the available works, I have come to the 
conclusion that:1)There is a reasonably serious challenge to the 
Aryan invasion theory 2)Unfortunately the proponents of the challenge 
themselves have no firm conclusive evidence to justify their case and 
3) This whole area is in need of some totally unbiased and thorough 
research. I STAND CORRECTED and apologise for my naive summation.
My original point however was somewhat different. In my researches
I have encountered this perception on the part of the present day 
Marathi Brahmins that they are Aryans, Shiva is a non-Aryan god and 
the south Indians are non-Aryans. I find it a bit simplistic to blame 
this on the teachings of the wicked British (or the Poms as we fondly 
call them in Oz.) Wrong as it is, where did this perception come from?
               And it does not pertain only to the Marathi Brahmins 
any way. We all know how the DMK in the south burned the Ramayana 
some years ago. My trips to North India have also shown that the same 
thinking as the Marathi Brahmins persists there as well.
              This apparent rivalry between the North and the South 
must surely predate poor old British.
              What is the reason behind this phenomenon? Is there 
any research in this area? These are the questions I need to answer 
in order to understand and explain the strange case of the Temple-
priest in Maharashtra.
   If I am stirring another hornet's nest, my sincere apologies.
Jayant Bapat
