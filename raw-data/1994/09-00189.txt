Thank you, Julia!

WA hotel I was staying in at in Madras had huges sige signs hanging both inside and 
outside the front door.  The outside sign read "Entrance In", and the
outside signsinside sign read "Entrance Out".

A few weeks later I passed a laundry in Bombay with a sign that said:
"Ladies, leave your clothes with us and enjoy your day."

My boyfriendA little closer to home...my boyfriend's favorite Chinese restaurant in
Washington sta

te has a sign in the parking lot that warns, "Parkers will
be violated."
