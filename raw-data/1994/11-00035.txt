	I entirely agree that we as scholars of India need to be fully 
aware of all the political issues both modern and ancient.  I have no 
problem with that.  However, being aware of these issues and discussing 
these issues is significantly different from blatantly advocating certain 
political views.  It is this latter type of behavior that has made the 
traffic on this network more like a soap-box forum.  I hope we can either 
change the "soap-box" character of the discourse, or start a new group.
