POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT: Asst. or Assoc. Prof. in Classical Hinduism

	The Department of Religion, Columbia University, announces a 
position in classical Hinduism. Candidates at the assistant and 
nontenured associate professor level can be considered for this 5-year 
term appointment; PhD required. Teaching responsibilities will include 
both graduate and undergraduate courses, some of them assuming a

asministrative aptitude are essential.  Academic interests of a 
particular relevance to the DHIRC are Veda, Vedanga (including Ayurveda), 
Vedanta, shastra, and the long history of interpretation associated with 
the vedic tradition, in the broadest sense, and with classical Hindu 
texts and ideas.

Robert A. F. Thurman, chair, Department of Religion, Kent Hall, Columbia 
University, New York, NY 10027 (212-854-3218), to whom applications
