I have just ordered a set of Devnagri fonts which appear quite nice and 
capable of writing Sanskrit and mixing up with Roman characters as well.
 If that is what you want you can ask them to send you a free sample which 
has characters on the middle row of the key board.
If you want the full fonts it will cost $19.80 in US and you may inquire by 
email from : info at impros.com
If you want mailing address, I can send me email or directly to them.
