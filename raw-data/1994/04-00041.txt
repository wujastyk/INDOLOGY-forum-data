Subject: BJP WHITE PAPER ON AYODHYA

          I  have discovered that  LC's  copy  of  the  BJP White paper  on 
          Ayodhya is already assigned to reference her in the Southern Asia 
          Section.  However, if  the person seeking a  copy is  not able to 
          find another library willing to let it  out  on interlibrary loan 
          to Canada I would be willing for it to go out.
