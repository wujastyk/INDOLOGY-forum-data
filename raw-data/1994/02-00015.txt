Subject: N.AM. INDIC MS. COLLS.

          I  have  just  come across a  paper  on  South Asian  and Tibetan 
          manuscripts and other primary source materials in  the  U.S.  and 
          Canada.  I has no t.p. and no other author, title, or date info.  
          It consists  of  a photocopy of  42  typed  pages.   The  chapter 
          headings are: Introd., Principal repositories of South Asian MSS. 
          in  the  U.S.  and  Canada, Principal Depositories of  Texts  and 
          Translations in  the  U.S.  and  Canada,  Tibetan  MSS.  and  XX. 
          including  prayer-blocks,   other   primary   source   materials, 
          Appendices. 
           
          I can't locate it in Maureen Patterson's bibliography.   
           
          Does anyone know anything about this?   I  would like  to contact 
          the author because they seem to  know things about the history of 
          LOC's  manuscript  collection  that  have  passed  out   of   the 
          institutional memory of our section.
