Subject: Conservation of Nature in Classical India?
Message-ID: <161227017131.23782.16576283464994959329.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hello, I am in search of references/pointers to Nature
protection/conservation and ecological awareness in the Classical
Age. Was there such a concept at all? Was it warranted in the first
place, what with the absence of polluting industries and motor cars
etc?

I do remember reading that there were protected reserves/Natural
resorts and sanctuaries for wild animals during Asoka's time. Is this
true? Can someone give me references?

Thanks very much.
