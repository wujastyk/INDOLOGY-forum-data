Subject: B.G Tilak and his theories
Message-ID: <161227017321.23782.9963040497652322586.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


     I would like to point out that one should not place B.G. Tilak and his
theory about the arctic home in the Vedas in the same boat as the theories
of some of the other names mentioned, and especially the theories coming
out of the RSS, VHP, BJP mode of scholarship.  While Tilak's theories may
safely be abandoned now, one needs to recognize that his theory was based
on considerations of astronomy etc. and not on considerations like the modern
politicized Aryanism of the VHP, BJP type authors.  In fact, at the beginning
of his work, Tilak clearly states that his ideas will displease a lot of
traditionalists for whom the eternal Vedas cannot contain any historical
information.  Additionally, he was willing to consider a home for the Aryans
outside of India proper, and that did not seem to hurt his individual pride.
Therefore, his motivations in proposing his theory were not of the same kind.

 A most interesting note, and it raises several questions in my mind;

1) What is modern politicized Aryanism of VHP, BJP ? What basic tenets 
does this particular school espouse ?

2) Is one of the bones of contention the question of an Aryan 
homeland ? Is homeland equivalent to the place where a particular 
group of people gestated for some time to forge this particular 
identity, or the geographic origin of a specific identifiable race ?

 These are sincere questions, and any answers will be appreciated.
