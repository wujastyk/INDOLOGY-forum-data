  On Saturday and Sunday Jonathan Silk and Lars Martin Fosse inquired
about titles on microfilm at Harvard.  In both cases the titles are in
Indological series microfilmed under a joint project at the University
of Chicago and Harvard University funded by the National Endowment for
the Humanities.
  Information on obtaining copies of microfilm prepared under that
project and under another project between Chicago and the British
Library is available on the South Asia Gopher.  By selecting the
options for "Bibliographic Information on South Asia" and "Catalog
of Indological Series Available on Microfilm" it is possible to
find the required details for ordering copies of film.  The file
also contains the titles of series filmed and the library or libraries
holding microfilm negatives for reproduction.
  A short-title catalog of works preserved under the two projects will
be available before the middle of 1995, I hope, on a World Wide Web
server being installed here.
