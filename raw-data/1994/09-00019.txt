 For the past year or so I have been looking into to viewpoints 
discrediting the Aryan Invasion theory, a la Max Mueller. The works 
by David Frawley and Subhash Kak among others point to significant 
inconsistencies in Max Muellers theory of Aryan invasion based 
primarily on the interpretation of the verses of the Rig Veda. One of 
the things pointed out by Frawley was that Mueller was a Christian 
missionary and a creationist, and this was a consideration in his 
fixing the Aryan invasions to about 1900 BC; This date had to be 
within 3000 BC as that is when he believed creation came to be ! This 
does not sound like a sound basis for historical science. Input from 
liguistics and archeology also does not support Max Muellers view, 
and casts his scholarship in doubt.
 One of the interesting alternate theories is that the Harrapa 
culture was a vedic or proto vedic culture. It was based along the 
now extint river Sarasvati (Hakkar-Ghagra basin) which ran thru parts 
of Rajastan to the sea in Gujrat. They have found fire altars 
suggesting fire worship, and other evidence of vedic culture. The 
vedic river Saraswati is is most often mentioned in the Rig Veda, and 
Ganga assumed greater significance after its demise. This does 
suggest a urbane Harrapa culture with distinct vedic features. I dont 
think that the entire picture is yet clear, but the cut and dried 
Aryan invasion theory is cleary inconsistent. I can dig up a few 
references in a few days if anyone is interested.
  No doubt more light will be shed on the subject as more work is 
done. A cursory glance at the historical wastebasket does indeed show 
it to be full of discarded paradigms ! 
All the best..
