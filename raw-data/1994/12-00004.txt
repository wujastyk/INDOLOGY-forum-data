 ADVAITA VEDANTA (NONDUALITY) -- AS REVEALED BY SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 NONDUALITY: Self-Knowledge  "The final conclusion of the Vedas"

 - "Man's real nature is happiness...  Happiness is inborn in the
   true Self. Man's search for happiness is an unconscious search for
   his true Self. The true Self is imperishable; therefore, when a
   man finds it, he finds a happiness which does not come to an end."
     (Sri Ramana Maharshi)

 - Spiritual instruction through discourses, dialogue, and
   meditation. Under the guidance of Master Nome, a Self-Realized
   disciple of Sri Ramana Maharshi.  Satsang and other holy events. 

 - The same perennial wisdom as expounded by Adi Sankara, Ribhu,
   Ashtavakra, Dattatreya, Nisargadatta Maharaj, and other sages.

 - An extensive free bibliography of Sri Ramana (TREAS-1) and other
   nondual sages (TREAS-2) is available. Information about SAT (the
   Society of Abidance in Truth) is available as SAT-INFO and WISE-1.
