Subject: Buddhism-Tibet: History of Jo-nang-pas
Message-ID: <161227017982.23782.9239011673166251530.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Dear reader,

in 1992 I wrote my MA-thesis on the following subject:

The "dBu-ma gZhan-stong" (Empty-of-other) -Philosophy in 
Kong-sprul Blo-gros mTha'-yas buddhist encyclopaedia (called:)
"Shes-bya kun-mkhyab mdzod". If there's anybody interested in some
related subject, I'll be happy to receive a message. Look, for instance,
for the short discussion on the "rang-stong/gzhan-stong discussion" in 
Paul Williams' excellent book "Mahayana Buddhism", which is one of the few
recently  

Currently, I'm working on a translation of a text (hopefully my future
PhD-thesis), which is a tibetan "chos-'byung", a religious history of the
Jo-nang-pa tradition. This tradition was renowned for it's origin in
India and the important role it played in transmitting the Kalacakra-tantra
into Tibet. It was stopped in the 17th cent. by the 5th. Dalai Lama because
of 'heretic views'. The short title of the text is "Jo-nang-ba'i chos-
'byung", published by D. Tsondru Senghe, The Bir Tibetan Society; Delhi
1983. It's author is one "Dzam-thang Bla-ma Ngag-dbang blo-gros
Grags-pa". However, there's no date of neither him, nor the text, 
so far. 

Well, I must admit, I'm just getting started with my work. 
In case anybody of You have heard of this author, this text, have 
information about interest in this subject,please send a message 
to the above adress (ami0209) 

Thank you
