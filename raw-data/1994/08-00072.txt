Does anyone know of a written source for the belief that peacocks are able
to digest poison in general, and black aconite in particular.  Have seen
this in Tibetan texts, and trying to track down its Indic origin.  Two
knowledgable people have said this is a common belief in S. India, perh.
related to Siva Nilakantha and the cult of Kartikkeya, but can't cite any
textual origin.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
                                          Michael

See Rgveda 1.191.14 for the earliest reference to the peacock consuming 
snake poison. I have heard in Tantric circles (no known text) that the 
dark blue centers of the peacock's feathers can be prepared as a bhasma, 
along with other substances such as aconite, to be used as a rasaaya.na.
