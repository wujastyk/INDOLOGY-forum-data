Subject: Politics and my two cents

        We just (seem to have) finished a highly contentious discussion of
politics in Indian studies.  This was at least marginally connected with
Indology, and might, perhaps, maybe, in some way shape or form, have had a
place on this list.  But I BEG you, let us not make this a forum for
debating the politics of Israel!!!  I am sure there are more than enough
places appropriate to that sort of discourse.  This is not one of them.
        In the spirit in which Indology is intended (as I understand it), I
am posting separately a list of questions concerning classical Indology,
regarding which I ask the help of specialists.
