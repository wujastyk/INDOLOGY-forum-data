The file

  bitstream-charter-font-CS-encoding.zip

is available from the internet site

  ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology

This file contains the publicly-available Type 1 font, Bitstream Charter
(normal, italic, bold, bold italic), reencoded for use by Sanskritists.
This is suitable for Windows, OS/2, and Mac systems, or any system that
supports Type 1 PostScript fonts.  It is free.  NB, it uses the CS coding,
not CSX (yet).  So it is okay for classical Sanskrit, but may not be enough
for Tamil, Prakrit, Vedic, etc.

Everything is explained in the readme enclosed with the file.
