Aryan origins or not; From my study of the subject, I do believe that 
Tantra has Aryan origins, but is not exclusive to it. Taoism, Zen, 
Ancient Celtic religion and various other traditions have strong 
Tantric elements in them. I believe that this is so as Tantra 
addresses the common human condition seen by sages of all cultures. It 
is my opinion that Buddha cut thru the Brahmanic exclusivism which 
had developed over centuries, and pointed out moksha was availible to 
all and the starting point of the journey is from where we 
are. Buddha was a great Tantric in the sense of his rejection of 
dogma, and emphasis on sincere personal experimentation and 
observation to find the self. His teachings however are in accordance 
with the vedic/upanishadic essence of "neti-neti". 
 J.B. Bapat made a point about Shiva being a non-aryan diety. Is 
there someone on the net who knows more about this? I do know about 
the vedic precursor of Shiva being Rudra. On a related note, I was 
very struck by the similarity of the Shiva like figure on the 
"Gundestrup Cauldron" (ancient eastern Celtic art, found in Denmark), 
and the Indus vally seals depicting once more a Shiva like figure, 
surounded by forest animals etc. Has any scholarship been done on 
this?
 All the best..
 J.B. Sharma
