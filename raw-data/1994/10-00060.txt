My PTS Dictionary gives the Jaataka and the Vimaanavatthu Commentary as
references for veyyaavaccakara: J iii 327 and VvA 349. I can not check
these references, although going by Masefield's translation it appears to
be used to explain pesiyo. It occurs more than eight times in the Vinaya
commentary. See Samantapaasaadikaa Vol VIII = Index Vol. The sense in Pali
seems to be someone who performs service e.g. a lay helper for monks
(kappiyakaaraka), but I have not checked all the references.

I hope this may be of some help.
