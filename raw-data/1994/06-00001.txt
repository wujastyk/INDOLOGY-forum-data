MINORITY LIBRARIAN EDUCATION AND TRAINING DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY 
  
  
The University of California, Berkeley has received a federal grant to 
fund a nine month resident Institute for the Recruitment, Education, 
and (Re) Training of Minorities in Academic Libraries.  The Institute 
objectives are (1) to provide education and training for minority 
librarians so that they will be prepared to consider the academic 
library environment for their continuing career; and (2) to enable 
participants, regardless of library background, to become immediately 
competitive as experienced, accomplished research librarians, 
particularly in the sciences. 
  
Through a combination of academic study and consultation; practical 
research opportunities; individual mentoring by library school faculty 
and successful professional research librarians; and actual research 
library experience, those selected to participate in the Institute should 
find themselves well prepared to adopt a research librarian career path. 
  
Institute Dates:     September 1, 1994 through May 31, 1995 
Participants:        4 racial/ethnic minority librarians 
Location:            University of California Library, Berkeley, CA 
Resident Stipend:    $2,000 per month 
  
Project Director:    Janice H. Burrows 
  
Participant Qualifications: Candidates should possess the MLS degree 
from an ALA accredited school and a demonstrated interest in the 
sciences.  It is the program's goal to select two recent library school 
graduates and two more experienced librarians who have worked in other 
than academic library settings. 
  
Candidates should submit with their resume a detailed cover letter 
describing their interest in the Institute, their goals for a future in 
academic librarianship, and a summary of how their past education and 
experience has led them to consider participation.
