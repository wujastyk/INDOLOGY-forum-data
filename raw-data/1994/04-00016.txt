Subject: T.R.V. MURTI'S DEATH DATE

          Does anyone know OFFHAND the death date of  T.  R.  V. Murti, the 
          scholar of Buddhism and  Indian philosophy?  I  have referred the 
          patron who needs it  to JAOS, JAS, and Philosophy East  and  West 
          for obituaries.  I don't have the  time  to  look  in  the stacks 
          myself.  I  also suggested he  call  the Center for  the Study of 
          World Religions in Harvard.  But  it  anyone knows without having 
          to search I would appreciate knowing it. 
           
          Thanks
