Research Paper:
 
A BUDDHIST ETHIC WITHOUT KARMIC REBIRTH?
 
Author: Winston L. King
Publication Date: November 10th, 1994
 
ABSTRACT
 
      Is a viable and authentic Buddhist ethic possible without the
prospect of rebirth governed by one's karmic past? This paper explores
traditional and contemporary views on karma with a view to determining
the importance of this doctrine for practical ethics in the West. The
Theravaada emphasis on the personal nature of karma is discussed
first, followed by a consideration of the evolution of a social
dimension to the doctrine in the Mahaayaana. The latter development is
attributed to the twin influences of the //Bodhisattva// ideal and the
metaphysics of Naagaarjuna and Hua Yen. Following this survey of
traditional perspectives, attention is turned for the greater part of
the paper to a consideration of the relevance of the notion of karmic
rebirth for Buddhist ethics in the West. The notion of "social
//kamma//"  advanced by Ken Jones in _The Social Face of Buddhism_ is
given critical consideration. The conclusion is that a doctrine of
karmic rebirth is not essential to a viable and authentic Buddhist
ethic in the West.
