What a golden opportunity.  Perhaps we should be very trendy and
forthwith carry out all communication on INDOLOGY only in 
Sanskrit.  (this will also solve the problem of encoding
Middle Indic vowel combinations such as a-u -- they are banned!)
This will significantly cut down on junk mail (= Sanskrit??), and
of course an on-line dictionary, presumably English-Sanskrit will
be necessary immediately (including items like "junk mail,"
"DOS format," "TrueType," etc.).  On the other hand, the result
might be that most the the messages on INDOLOGY are from Profs.
Deshpande and Aklujkar for the forseeable future.
And just think, if you think Indian Bureaucracy is troublesome
now, just imagine it all in Sanskrit!
I'm looking forward to a wild time!
