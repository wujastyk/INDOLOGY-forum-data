>From Louis Fenech <lfenech at epas.utoronto.ca>:

While translating an early nineteenth-century
Punjabi/Braj text I came across the name of a king who has me
completely stumped.  The passage goes something like this:
	"As Raja Bipasachat witnessed the attractions of Maya so too
	do the Sikhs..."  

The passage may also read this way:
	"As the Brahman Raja Sachat [Bip is a Punjabi word for
	Brahman]..."
  
Any word on a text which deals with this elusive king will be a great help.
