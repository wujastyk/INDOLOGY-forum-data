Thanks to all of you who responded to my request for suggestions
for possible authors for articles on Indian and Tibetan philosophy
for the new Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I shall answer
all your messages individually, but it will take several days to
sort through them all and write replies. Meanwhile, please accept
this less personal expression of collective gratitude.
