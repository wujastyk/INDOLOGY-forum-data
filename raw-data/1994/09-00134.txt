> AHIMSA, NON-VIOLENCE
> (Produced by Marion Hunt and directed by Michael Tobias, 1987, 58 min.)
> Distributor: Direct Cinema
> R-753 = AA 91,4 (1989): 1094-95
> ".. about modern followers of the Jain religion in India... Because of its
> vivid and colorful subject matter, its seductive narration ... and its
> unique depiction of an important religious community seldom studied even
> in South Asian ethnography courses, this film will be tempting to plug in
> as a remedial ethnographic profile of the Jains. However to do so without
> additional background material would be a _big_ mistake. The film's made-
> for-television slickness will encourage students to overlook its lack of
> sociohistorical context and its consistently pro-Jain hyperbole... I would
> certainly use this film in my courses, but only with additional materials
> to ensure a critical viewing." (from AA review, which also makes several
> suggestions for additional reading)

> ALTAR OF FIRE
> (Robert Gardner/Frits Staal, 1976, 45 min)
> Distributor: University of California Extension Media Center (film and
> video)
> R-270 = AA 80,1 (1978), 197-9
> "... consists largely of footage taken during the course of the
> performance of the Vedic Agnicarana ritual by Nambudiri Brahmins in Kerala
> Province in April of 1975." Robert Paul's AA review focusses on the
> dubious nature of the film's claims to "authenticity," and its lack of
> contextualizing the event depicted: the makers of the film "pretend to
> give us an authentic glimpse into ancient Vedic times, rendered hollow and
> ethically repugnant through the patronizing, rigid, antiquarian, and
> neocolonialist attitudes it reveals."
>
>
> BAKE RESTUDY 1984
> (Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy and Amy Catlin, 60 min)
> AA 96,2 (1994), 484-6
> Distributor: Apsara Media for Intercultural Education
> "This videotape explores the preservation and transformation of
> performance in India's southern states of Tamilnadu, Kerala and Karnataka.
> It compares Arnold Adriaan Bake's unique 16mm films, photos and audio
> recordings of music, dance and ritual, made in 1938, to the audio-visual
> documentation collected on a revisit to the same sites by his students and
> colleague, Nazir Jairazbhoy, in 1984." (details from _Asian Studies
> Newsletter_ (Apr-May 1993), p.11)

> BANARAS
> (Michael Camerini, 22min)
> Distributor: Michael Camerini, Inc. (Made in cooperation with Dept of
> Indian Studies, Uni of Wisconsin, Madison)
> "The feeling and mood of Banaras rather than a detailed description of any
> given facet of the city. The film relies on visual images and the original
> score to evoke the feeling of being in Banares. It shows the cycle of
> daily activity, life on the ghats, ties the formal worship in temples to
> the devotions of pilgrims and the people of the city at the river, and
> explores the many different types of shrines found in the city. There are
> many rhythms to the city: the pattern of daily life, the market places,
> the multiple uses of the river and of water in general, and all contribute
> to the holiness of the city. In exploring these rhythms the film also
> gives the viewer a feeling for the people of Banares; their faces, moods
> and actvities." (details and description from H6: 30)

> BEING MUSLIM IN INDIA
> (1984, 30 min)
> Distributor: South Asia Film Center, University of Wisconsin

> BENARES: STEPS TO HEAVEN
> (Richard Riddiford, 1984, 30 min.)
> Distributor: Wombat Productions
> R625 = AA 89,1 (1987) 251-3
> "Its 30 minutes are devoted to the city as a pilgrimage centre... leaves
> this viewer with a sense of a guided tour, unattached to the actual lives
> of people who live in the city and depend on its religious importance for
> their livelihood... Yet its use in teaching about Hinduism, about Benares
> as a pilgrimage center, about the antiquity of Hindu custom and the beauty
> that can be allied with death and distress is certain..." (AA review)

> CHANDALIKA: A DRAMA OF KARMA AND SOCIAL CHANGE
