In The Ancient Indian Royal Consecration (p. 2 Note on the Material), J.C.
Heesterman calls attention to the film and sound recordings made by prof. 
van Buitenen of a "revivalistic performance of the vaajapeya at Poona, which 
covers the whole paradigma of the Soma sacrifice". Does anyone know whether
this material is still available, possibly on VHS?
