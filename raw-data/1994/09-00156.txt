About laying the whole thing to rest...

I have been following up this thread with interest and find I can't
complain. Even most of the flames were nicely written and made good
entertaining reading.

As far as the content of the thread goes, if there is one thing it
makes clear, it is this:

After meticulous investigation, careful consideration of all available
empirical evidence and profound rationalisation, a human will choose
to believe bloody well what he or she wants to. 

This is a modified version of the one about the lab rat I heard: Under
carefully controlled laboratory conditions a rat will do damn well as
it pleases.  :-)

Cheers.
