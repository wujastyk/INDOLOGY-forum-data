Subject: PAPER ON N.AM. INDIC MSS.

          Thanks to those who responded to  my query.  Susan Meinheit found 
          another copy of the article, with a title page, and  it turns out 
          to be this: 
           
          Walter H. Maurer. 
          "Primary  source materials,  the  location  and acquisition, with 
          particular reference to manuscripts, texts and translations." 
          Conference  on  American  Library  Resources  on  Southern  Asia, 
          Washington,  D.C.,   1957.   Proceedings,  reports,  and  working 
          papers. 
          Working paper no. 3. 
           
          LC's bound copies (Z3001 .C584 1957) appear to be photostats, but 
          there  are indications that  at  least Maurer's  paper  was  also 
          published in an Indian journal.  More on this later.
