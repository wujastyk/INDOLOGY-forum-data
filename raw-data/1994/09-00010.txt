In an 1895 letter Vivekananda mentioned that he wanted to invent some
rituals for Westerners by referring to "Hemadri Kosha".  Does anyone
know what precisely he may have been referring to (and whether an
edition, preferably in translation, is available somewhere)?
Thanks, Tim Bryson (bryson at harvarda.harvard.edu)
