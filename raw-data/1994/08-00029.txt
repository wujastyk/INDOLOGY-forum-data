Many thanks to the learned list denizens who have responded to this query
with valuable and varying opinions.  Leonard Zwilling, with whom I'm
collaborating in this research, is most appreciative.  By the by, in
reference to Ken Zysk's posting, we have done some work on the medical
literature re this topic "The First Medicalization," in the "Journal of the
History of Sexuality," vol.3, no.4, pp.590-607.
