I am interested in recent research/scholarship on the
Soundaryalahari.  Has the authorship of this poem been
determined? What are the theories? I have heard that the
traditional attribution of this work to Sankara is not accepted
any more by scholars. Some seem to attribute it to one mUka
kavi. Who is this person?

Any pointers to literature will be appreciated.
