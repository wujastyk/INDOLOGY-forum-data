>>THE "Good Times" VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND
>>
>>In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information requests
>>about a supposed "virus" which could be contracted via America OnLine, simply
>>by reading a message.  The following is the message that CIAC received:
>>
>> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>| Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.    |
>>|                                                                           |
>>|  Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on   |
>>| America Online being sent by E-Mail.  If you get anything called "Good    |
>>| Times", DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your |
>>| hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |
>> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>
>>THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
>>originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university
>>at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax.
>>
>>CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any
>>electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" will infect your
>>computer.
>>
>>This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to the
>>fact that many people have seen a message with "Good Times" in the header.
>>They delete the message without reading it, thus believing that they have
>>saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports give a false
>>sense of credibility to the alert message.
>>
>>There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with
>>"xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic, because
>>he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he
>>checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his machine.
>> He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the
>>virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail
>>message).  This person then spread his alert.
>>
>>As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely through
>>reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program must be executed.
>>Reading a mail message does not execute the mail message.  Yes, Trojans have
>>been found as executable attachments to mail messages, the most notorious
>>being the IBM VM Christmas Card Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm
>>(reference CIAC Bulletin B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).
>> But this is not the case for this particular "virus" alert.
>>
>>If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists, simply
>>ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a false rumor.

So it's just a net Rumor :-)

hup's

Hi everibody, let me introduce me, my name is xavier Martin-Dupont, I'm
french student in linguistic field (so my english is prety bad) and I'm
reading this list with a lot of interest (one of my interest topic's is
historical Linguistic : ). I'm also quite interested by the work of
G.Dumezil (comparated mythology, cf Mythe et epopee 3t galimard bibiotheque
des sciences humaine) and the E.Benveniste studies : le vocabulaire des
institutions indo-europeennes (2t edition de minuit col le sens commun)...
and so on
