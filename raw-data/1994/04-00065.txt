It is a most interesting community, although many of its members now 
reside in Israel.  For very up-to-date insights on the present condition 
of the Bene Israel in Israel, contact Professor Joan Roland at Pace 
University.  

Indologists may note with interest that the Shanwar Teli 
(Saturday Oilmen, or Oil pressers), as they were known in rural 
Maharashtra's Konkan coast, owed some share of their rediscovery as Jews 
to the efforts of the Reverend John Wilson and others who were doing 
their orientalist shtick in Bombay in the early nineteenth century.

The community seemed to be eroding through emigration entirely out of India 
to Israel during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  In Israel a number of them 
prospered, but faced discrimination, sometimes subtle, sometimes blatent, 
and they had eventually to fight a political battle to be recognized as 
Jews in instances of marriage with other ethnic groups.

Professor Roland tells me that with Bombay's economic growth and the 
relative stagnation of opportunity in Israel, it appears that the Bene 
Israel population in Bombay city, at least, has stabilized.

When I was last in Bombay, I was told by a Cochin Jewish friend that the 
Bene Israel still had two synagogues where sufficient numbers permitted 
regular services.


That should get you started.
