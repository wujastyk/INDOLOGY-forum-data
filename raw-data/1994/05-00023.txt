Dear friends: 
  
Does anyone have a collection of references on the 
Hindu goddess Durga in Sanskrit, Tibetan and 
English?  How is Durga referred to in Tibetan? 
Is there a Hindu scholars discussion group? 
Is there a computer program for learning sanskrit? 
  
Thanks for any information you may provide.
