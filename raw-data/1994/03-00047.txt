Apologies for cross-posting.  The announcement which follows was sent to me
by Alexander A. Stolyarov whom I met in Hong Kong at the ICANAS/IAOL
meetings last August.  I have also received two numbers of a bulletin which
his group has published entitled:  Bazy dannykh po istorii Evrazii v
srednie veka (Data Bases on the History of Eurasia in the Middle Ages). 
The translations of article titles in Vypusk 1 (1992)  and Vypusk 2 (1993)
are listed after the conference announcement.  If anyone wants a particular
article, please make a request to the Interlibrary Loan Department of the
Ohio State University Libraries.  This publication was issued in 250 copies
so it might be hard to find.  That is why I am inputting the information
for everyone's benefit.  Please pass this on to other appropriate
listservs/individuals.

The list of themes embraces the historical period from archaic times to the
