Dear colleagues,
I've been off the net for a while -- a month to be exact -- and now
I'm back I find that a disk crash on the vigyan machine has caused
all email between 10th and 25th of October to be lost. So if you
sent me anything important in that period, please send it again.
This applies to Julia Leslie too, who also has an account
on vigyan.

Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
