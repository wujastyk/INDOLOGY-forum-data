Subject: HINDI SELF-INSTRUCTION PROGRAM

          Would  the  person  who  has developed  a  computer  program  for 
          self-instruction please contact me (NOT the net)  at  the address 
          below?  A library patron has asked me  if such  a thing existed I 
          and told him I had heard of one on INDOLOGY.  
          Thanks,
