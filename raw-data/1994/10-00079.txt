Van Nooten uses the CSX format, which means that if you use a PC, you need
the wnrir - files to get an indological transliteration character set.
These files you can get hold of by using ftp. Try these sites:

Indology ftp: Indology FTP : ftp.bcc.ac.uk
Login: anonymous
Directory:  /public/users/ucgadkw/indology

or

blackbox.hacc.washington.edu
(hacc = Humanities and Computing Centre in Washington)


Otherwise, with a bit of patience, you can convert van Nootens
transliteration into any other kind of representation by means of
search-and-replace.
