   nine-month American academic year.
   
*Eligibility: Applicants must be American citizens or permanent
   residents and "must be committed to a teaching career."  Graduate
   students are preferred, but unusually qualified undergraduates may
   also be considered.  For the academic-year program, all applicants
   must have at least two years or 240 hours of classroom language study
   before going on the program.  For the summer program, applicants in

"The program will be administered in India by AIIS staff.  This is an
   intensive language program which provides four hours of classroom
   instruction five days a week.  Classes are small and individual
   tutorials are provided.  There will be regular assignments outside of
   class, and participants must take part in all program events, such as
   attending films, plays, and other cultural activities.  This is not a
   research program; participants are expected to devote all their
   energies to activities which will increase their competence in all
   areas of language skills--speaking, listening, reading, and writing."

   with guest lectures from local professors; courses and field research
   are offered for 12-16 semester hours of college credit.  Basic
   Buddhist meditation techniques are also taught.

A good beginning can be made in language study, but the brief time of
   the program means that only a certain amount can be achieved.
