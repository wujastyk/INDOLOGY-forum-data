This message was forwarded to me by a friend who subscribes to a list 
dealing with Native American languages.  Can anyone shed some light on 
this, posting to our list for our general edification and copying to 
David Cole?  As many of you know, the archetypal trickster in American 
Indian tradition is coyote.

required. Teaching responsibilities include textual work in one of those
middle-period/modern languages offered in the program: Bengali, Hindi,
