	I appreciate your not boring us by regurgitating the discussion. 
I would be very happy if also cultivate the habit of not inflicting your 
sweeping judgments on us. J.B. Sharma has not said anything remotely 
similar to "anything goes". If you think so, please prove it. Or else, 
indulge in your mud-slinging in private.

	You are being very pessimistic indeed. The faculty of buddhi 
ddoes not show up in your behaviour. Or else you would not make this 
network your private playground, where the only people who are free to 
speak are the likes of Rosane Rocher and Richard Lariviere (who make 
noise about "discrediting the discredited" and "rancid pablum" without 
mustering the decency to support their slanderous accusations with facts 
or even plausible explanations.)
