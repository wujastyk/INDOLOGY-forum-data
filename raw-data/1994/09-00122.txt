About the Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center:

The Center was established at Columbia University by Srichand P. Hinduja
on May 19, 1994 in memory of his late son, Dharam, a student in America
who cared deeply about human and spiritual values and the betterment of
relations between India and the Unite d States. 

The Hinduja Group, a worldwide business complex run by the four Hinduja
brothers, is active in international trade, finance, banking,
manufacturing, power, transport, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals,
industrial project development, petroleum and lubr icants.  With offices
in Europe, India, the Middle East, the Far East and the United States, the
Group employs 20,000 people. 

Through the Hinduja Foundations in India, Europe and America, the Hinduja
family makes resources available for philanthropic activities in the areas
of health, education, social welfare, art, culture, and sports.  The
Center at Columbia, dedicated to res earch on the Veda (the earliest
religious texts in an Indo-European language) and the later Vedanta
(philosophical texts) of India, works closely with other leading
universities and scholars throughout America, sponsoring research,
seminars, and conferenc es.  The Center has also funded positions at
Columbia for research and teaching in Sanskrit and classical Hinduism. 
Beginning in 1995, it will offer doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships as
well.
