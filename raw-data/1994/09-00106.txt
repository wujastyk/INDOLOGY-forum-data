Dear Members,
 
Is there any one on the list who is a specialist (actually a
generalist) on the Eastern Himalayan States of India (ie. Sikkim
eastward) and who would like to write an article about the region
for an encyclopedia of South Asia folklore?  Or specific folklore
topics (genres; from oral narrative to art and material culture)
in that region?  
 
Or do you know anyone who IS a specialist on that region and
MIGHT like to write on it? (Please include their address if
possible.)
 
Please send responses to me personally at the addresses and
numbers below.
