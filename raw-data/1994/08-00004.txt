I have one with the Sanskrit verses in Devanagari and English
transcriptions and translations together with Gaudapada's Karika plus
Sankara's commentary is published by the advaita ashrama, Mayavati,
Himalayas. I can post further pointers tomorrow if you like. I think I
bought mine at the Ramakrishna Mutt in Mylapore, Madras some years ago.
