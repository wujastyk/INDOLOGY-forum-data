Dr. Hawley,

Hi, I am sending this to you in hopes that you might be able to help us out. 
I am on the staff of the Asian American Policy Review and we are 
looking for articles for our upcoming issue on Immigration.  Enclosed 
is the Call for Papers for the Asian American Policy Review.  If you 
are interested, submit something.  We are accepting student 
submissions.  Please pass this on to everyone you think might be 
qualifed or interested, or, if you can, please send me email/call me 
and put me in touch with people, even if you've only heard of/read 
their work.  I would appreciate it if you could canvas your 
colleagues and friends who are practitioners in these areas or 
advocates for these issues.  We really need to get articles soon so 
we can go to print by the end of the semester.  In any case, I'd 
appreciate it if you could tell me who you send this to so we can keep 
them in mind for future issues.  Thanks for the help.  Email me if 
you have any questions.

MOST IMPORTANT:  WE ARE TRYING TO GET SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN POLICY ISSUES OUT 
INTO THE MAINSTREAM AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO IT.  IF 
YOU CAN STRESS THIS TO THE SOUTH ASIANS THAT YOU KNOW, THAT WILL HELP 
US TO BROADEN THE ASIAN AMERICAN POLICY REVIEW TO INCLUDE THOSE 
COMMUNITIES

ASIAN AMERICAN POLICY REVIEW

CALL FOR PAPERS

VOLUME 5:  
A SPECIAL INVESTIGATION ON 
IMMIGRATION AND THE LIFE OF IMMIGRANTS

The Asian American Policy Review is a non-partisan, academic journal devoted 
to the critical examination of political, economic, and social policy 
issues affecting Asian Pacific America ns.  The AAPR is produced by 
graduate students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard Univ
ersity and the Graduate School of Public Policy at the University of 
California-Berkeley.

Submissions focusing on the following issues will be given high priority:

--  social and cultural adjustment issues (domestic violence, 
identity crises, assimilation, bilingualism, political empowerment)
--  health care delivery
--  welfare reform
--  affordable housing
--  primary and secondary education in underprivileged communities
--  labor
--  legal immigration issues

We are concerned with specific policy issues as well as some survey research 
on broad areas of policy as they relate to recent immigrants (i.e., 
1st, 1.5, and 2nd generation APAs).  We are looking for scholarly 
work but it does not have to be from the perspective of an academic.  
Articles from practitioners or advocates in the community are always 
encouraged.

We are also looking for articles that explore the diversity within the Asian 
American group.  Articles that target specific Asian American 
subgroups (e.g., Indian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, etc.) rather 
than all Asian Americans as a whole would be preferred, but there is 
no formal restriction.

Submissions should follow the following guidelines:

--  the paper must be ORIGINAL and UNPUBLISHED and include both a hard copy 
and a copy on disk 
(preferrably Microsoft Word for the Macintosh)
--  Suggested length:  8-10 pages for commentaries, 15-25 pages for articles
--  Please send us a two to three paragraph abstract of the paper ASAP, 
preferrably by fax or email
