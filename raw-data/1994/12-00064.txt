Subject: The Varangacarita once again
Message-ID: <161227018036.23782.8393552373033720299.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

During the last year or so I have been searching the world for an edition
of Jatacarya's Vara;ngacarita. The book is on microfilm at Harvard (Harvard
Microreproduction Service), but they only supply photocopies of journals.
Our library service has been trying a number of other places, but to no
avail. In spite of the fact that I have bothered the honored members of the
list with this question before, I have to ask once again: Does anyone know
where I might get a copy of the book?

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
