I am a senior at Virginia Tech located in Blacksburg Va and am taking a
"Religion and Culture in India" class.  For this class I will be writing a
term paper on the effects of mountaineering on the religion and culture of
India.  If someone could send me information on books or articles availabe
on this subject it would be much appreciated.
