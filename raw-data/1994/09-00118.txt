Subject: What is India?
Message-ID: <161227017336.23782.17342617476599840431.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

        In his recent summary of the Aryan Invasion theory Mr. Dileep
Karanth has repeatedly used the word "India."  He is certainly not alone is
his unnuanced use of this designation, which, it seems to me, especially in
the present context is an inadvisable term -- and indeed it may be that Mr.
Karanth himself is only reporting the usage of the authors whose views he
is presenting.  (I would like to assure him that I am not singling him out
here.)  I merely want to bring up the question:  What does "India" mean?
Does it refer only to the present political borders of the nation of India?

        I doubt it, but I am not sure what is intended with the term.
Sometimes we try to play fast and loose with this by using "South Asia,"
but without a definition this is hardly more helpful (although it avoids
confusion with the State of India).  I  would note in this regard that some
time ago G. Fussman published a couple of papers in the _Annuaire du
College de France_ in which he discussed definitions of "India" in
different classical sources.  I do not have the articles at hand just at
the moment, but if I recall correctly he discussed European (Classical)
sources, and also native "Indian" sources in his examination.  Perhaps
someone with access to Fussman's work can post the exact references for
interested readers.
        It might clarify at least part of the discussion if "India" were
defined by those who use the term in the formulations of their theses.
