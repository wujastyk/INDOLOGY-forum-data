I too ran across some similar ideas last year, and posted a query on 
the South Asian Reflector, asking if there was any good scholarship 
backing up these ideas.  In the end, I only received one answer 
(unfortunately I can't remember who sent it to me), which included 
these three items:

1.  Renfrew, Coli.  Archaeology and Language
	
2. Parpola, Oscar.  1983.  The Pre-Vedic Indian Background of the 
Srauta Ritual.  In Fritz Stahl, ed., 	Agni: The Vedic Ritual of the 
Fire Altar.  Berkeley: Asia Humanities Press, pp. 41-75

3.  "A New View of Ancient India" by Georg Feuerstein, David Frawley 
and Subhash Kak appeared in the "Yoga Journal" (Berkeley, CA) 
July/August, 1992.

I haven't had the time to follow this up, so I don't know if these 
items truly are relevant to the debate or not.  Nor can I vouch for 
their scholarly quality, though I do recall that the person who sent 
them to me was not impressed with the third item.

If anyone has any more information, I'd be most interested.  

Cheers,
