Apparently-To: magier at columbia.edu

RURAL AND URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IN SOUTH ASIA
Conference in Oslo, Norway
18-22 May 1995

(NASA: Nordic Association for South Asian Studies)

The conference will provide a forum for discussion of social, cultural 
and material dimensions of "the environment". It will have themes 
contemplating natural and the human-made environments, the sustainable 
and unsustainable practices of villagers, industries, and government 
departments, as well as local, trans-local and international patterns of 
co-operation and conflict characterizing environmental issues in South Asia.

MAJOR THEMES:

1. Too little: Farming and Pastoralism in Arid Zones
2. Too much: Farming, Fishing and Flooding in Wet Areas
3. Urban Fields: Industry, Pollution, and Slum
4. Political Ecology.

The conference organizers have decided to combine Nordic and North 
American models in organizing this conference. This means that we plan 
participation through panels. Conference organizers and participants will 
cooperate to inject sub-themes relating to specific interests into the 
main themes. Any group of two or more paper-presenting participants may 
define a sub-theme by contacting the organizers in advance of the conference.
