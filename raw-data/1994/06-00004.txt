Dear Dr. Thrasher,

I would be very interested and appreciative to receive
this pamphelt on the sricakra.
It's right up my alley.

Thanks,

p.s. You likely don't  remember me but we met years ago
at UWashington.  I have long admired your work on Mandana Misra.
Thanks for your efforts here.  I am also checking this
reference to Nani Ammal...but it rings no immmdedate bells.
(I muck about in Tamil as well...)

shanti
