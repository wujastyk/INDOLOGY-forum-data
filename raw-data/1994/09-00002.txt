I have a question about casting a horoscope in the Indian astrological
system which Kane's History of Dharmasastra and other books on the
practicals of casting a horoscope can give me no help on. 

The question is this: in preparing a chart of the positions of the planets
at birth, can a planet inhabit two houses at once? I. e., is it possible
for Mars to be in, say, the second house and the seventh house at the same
time? If so, what textual documentation is there for this? If not, why not?

I tend to think not, but I'll be happy to be corrected. The text I am
reading is the Avadhi Candaayan by Maulana Daud, and its resolution depends
on the reading of the nayaka's horoscope by a trader disguised as a
Brahmin. I think the horoscope is a fake, just like the pandit, but clearly
I need a real pandit to tell me whether it is so!

I'd be grateful for any help in resolving this crux.
