Hi,

A friend has come across the article by 
B. Van Nooten, "Binary numbers in Indian antiquity", Journal of Indian
Philosophy, vol 21, pp 31-50, 1993.

He does not have the affiliation or the address
of the author. Our library does not get this journal and I do not
know how gopher might be used to get his address. Could someone please
help me in getting this address? 

Thank You,

Dileep Karanth
