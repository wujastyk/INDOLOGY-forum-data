At the cost of several crores of tax rupees, politicians are
trying to get the maximam out of this. They will bring in truck
loads of illiterate masses from villages to Tanjore and feed them,
show some cinemas, etc., Driving home the point that they are
the custodians and saviors of Tamil culture and heritage will be
the main thrust. The relatives and friends of the people in power 
will make money. In spite of all this, some good things  will
happen to tamil too. The conference gives a rare chance for scholars
to contact, meet and discuss things together. Some new books and projects
will be conceived or produced. On the Fifth World Tamil conference,
(Madurai, 1981) Norman Cutler (University of Chicago) wrote his
views in a nice article in Pacific Affairs as "The Fish-eyed Goddess
goes to the Movies". Fish-eyed Goddess is Minakshi, the patron-goddess
of Madurai and the word "Movies" hints at the powerful connection
between Tamil politics and cinema.
