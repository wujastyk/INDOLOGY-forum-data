Dear Daniel,
Be sure to examine very carefully the works of Richard Schmidt, who did
considerable work with Kamasutra mss, as well as texts of many other Kamasastra
texts. Likewise, take a close look at more recent translations of the
Kamasutra, especially the one by Klaus Mylius. There are far more interesting
and important Kamasastra texts awaiting careful study and analysis.
