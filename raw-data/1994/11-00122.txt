          Tamil Saiva Saints  in Cambodia?
          ---------------------------------

Karaikkal Ammaiyar (5th cenury A.D.?) is represented sculpturally in several
Cambodian temples. She is one of the Tamil Saiva saints called Naayanmars.
Indira Peterson has translated some of Nayanmars poems. (Poems to Siva,
Princeton, 1989). Their legends appear later in Telugu (Siva's warriors, 
Velcheru Narayana Rao, Princeton University press) and in Kannada 
(Ragale poems of Haridasas). Also, their stories appear in Sanskrit as
Upamanyu Bhakta vilasam and Sri Puranam (on Saint Sundarar).  I have 
seen the references given at the end.

Are there any stories/folklore in Cambodian literature referring 
to Tamil or South Indian or Indian Saiva saints or Alvars (vaishnava saints)?
Is there any tradition in Cambodia and its literature or any South East
Asian literatures connected to South Indian/ Tamil Saiva saints?
I am posing this question because Karaikkal Ammaiyar is represented in so many
sculptures of Cambodia and so her story must be widely known there.
And, the literature must have traces of it.

If so, any western language articles on it. What period
do these literatures belong to? the age of great Khmer temples???

Any pointers welcome. Thanks a bunch.
