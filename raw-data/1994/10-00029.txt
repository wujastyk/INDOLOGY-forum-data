> The Supreme Court has directed the Central Board of Secondary Education to
> include Sanskrit as an elective subject in the syllabus so far as teaching
> in secondary schools is concerned.  Necessary amendment in the syllabus shll
> be made "within of three months."
> 
> Mr. Justice B. L. Hansaria, who delivered the judgment, noted that "in view
> of the importance of Sanskrit in nurturing our cultural heritage, because of
> which even the official education policy has highlighted the need to study
> Sanskrit, making of Sanskrit alone as an elective subject -- while not
> conceding this status to Arabic and/or Persian -- would not in any way
> militate against the basic tenet of secularism."
> 
> A Bench, which in cluded Mr. Justice Kuldip Singh, held that there was thus
> "no merit" in the objection raised by the CBSE that if it (CBSE) were to
> include Sanskrit as "an elective subject," it would have to make facilities
> available for learning of Arabic and Persian -- these also being classical
> languages.
> 
> The two other objections raised by the CBSE -- inclusion of French and
> German also in the syllabus and of language like "Lepcha" -- did "not
> deserve any consideration for obvious reasons."
> 
> The Bench adverted to the importance of Sanskrit and its role in national
> ethos and cultural heritage as highlighted in the roport of the Sanskrit
> Commission (1957) and also in the broad framework of the Education Policy
> formulated by the Centre in 1968 and 1986.
> 
> There was "no doubt" that "teaching of Sanskrit alone as an elective subject
> can in no way be regarded as against secularism."  The constitution requires
> giving a fillip to Sanskrit because of what has been stated in Article 351,
> in which while dealing with the duty of the Union to promote the spread of
> Hindi, it had been provided that it would draw, whenever necessary or
> desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit.  Encouragement to
> Sanskrit is also necessary because of it being one of the languages included
> in the Eighth Schedule.
> 
> The bench was allowing a group of connected writ petitions seeking a
> direction to the CBSE to include Sanskrit in the syllabus of the Board as an
> elective subject in secondary schools.
