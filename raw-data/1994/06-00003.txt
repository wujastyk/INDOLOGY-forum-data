Subject: TAMIL POETESS NANI AMMAL

          Could anyone tell me anything about a Tamil poetess whose name is 
          informally Englished as Nani Ammal?  I have not been able to find 
          anything in LC's names authority or in standard reference books.  
          The  question occurs  in reference  to  the following uncataloged 
          book at Library of Congress: 
           
          Isvaran, Manjeri S. 
          Song of the Gipsymaiden (sic). 
          Madras-Madura : Shakti Karyalaya, 1945. 
           
          In  the introduction the translator says  the  poem came  to  him 
          orally, that  the author lived  "a couple of centuries ago," that 
          she was widowed young, and that her father in  law wrote down her 
          songs.  The songs are of an Advaitic tendency.
