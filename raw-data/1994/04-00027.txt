Subject: Oral tradition in Tantra
Message-ID: <161227016726.23782.793470008757768239.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

As a non-specialist in Tantra, I would appreciate any references anyone
could send me on oral tradition and/or secrecy in Tantra, whether Hindu or
Buddhist.  Has anything good been written lately on this subject?

Thanks in advance.
