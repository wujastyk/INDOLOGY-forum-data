Subject: Happiness is inborn in the true Self...
Message-ID: <161227017024.23782.7781051802197784634.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Good Friend,
Sri Ramana Maharshi said, "Happiness is inborn in the true Self.
Man's search for happiness is an unconscious search for his
true Self. The true Self is imperishable. Therefore, when a
man finds it he finds happiness which does not come to an end."

This reminder is about the first Meditation Retreat of Master Nome 
open to the public. An event of a lifetime for devotees of Sri
Ramana Maharshi, and all who seek the Non-dual Self.
  Namaste
