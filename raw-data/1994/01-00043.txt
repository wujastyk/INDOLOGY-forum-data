          Re:  'Saiva connection of Hindi and Rajasthani mss. 
           
          I  just took  a quick look over the 'Sivapraka-a'sar-am-aya.na ms 
          and  saw  no references to Siva.  Could Sivaprakasa have been the 
          poet's patron?  I  see  no references to Siva  or Saivism in  the 
          other  mss  of  3  works, although  I  can't  make  much  of  the 
          Rajasthani.
