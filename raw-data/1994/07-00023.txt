I took a MacSE to India and Kashmir and it worked wonderfully. The Mac has a
variable power supply which accepts voltages from 100 through 240 volts at 50
or 60 cycles. This is especially important in India where the voltage may
fluctuate widely. In Kashmir the power was out hours at a time and I
compensated for this by using a battery powered inverter. 
The users ability to edit and create non Roman fonts on the Macintosh is
unparalleled.
A dealer in New Delhi and Hyderabad who a the authorized distributor for
Apple Computer is Odin Computers India Ltd. Their phone number in New Delhi
is 685 7717 or 7718.
