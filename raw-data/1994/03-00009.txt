> In my research on the social reform of devadasis in Karnataka/Maha

> 
> 1. What historical/mythical/religious sources are there for
>    this myth?
> 2. How do the Saivite and Vaishnaivite versions vary?
> 3. Given #2 what are the geneaological relationships?
> 4. Is Parushrama's parentage, or his relationship to either
>    parent, contentious in any of these sources?
> 5. Are there any sustained academic discussions/interpretations
>    on this myth? (Articles? books?)
> 6. Do you think this myth lends itself well to a psychoanalytic
>    interpretation? Other?
> 7. And finally. What sources of a similar nature are there that
>    illustrate the father's role, duty, especially in relation
>    to the son? Vice versa, son to father? (Succint quotes? sections?)
