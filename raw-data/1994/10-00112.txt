Subject: Origin and symbology of "Monsoon rain"

My understanding of  Ashok Sharma's query  is that he was not really asking 
for the etymological replies that he got, but rather for more general 
literary and cultural information.  If this is the case, a good place to 
start, from the classical Sanskrit side, might be the collection of 
verses on the rainy season in Section 10 of Vidyaakara's 
Subhaa.sita-ratnakos'a, translated by D.H.H. Ingall's as An Anthology of 
Sanskrit Court Poetry (abridged edition: Sanskrit Poetry from Vidyakara's 
"Treasury").
