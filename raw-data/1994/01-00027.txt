Subject: HINDI AND RAJASTHANI MSS I.D.

          The Library of Congress has  been offered from  a  Western dealer 
          the following work in Hindi or some related language or dialect: 
           
          Gosv-am-i Ras-alagiri 
          'Sivaprak-a'sar-am-aya.na. 
           
          It has also been offered 1  ms containing these works labelled as 
          being in Rajasthani: 
           
          1. Sadaivacchas-abali-ng-ar-iv-arat-a 2. Jos-ijagann-atha.        
          Kokabh-usha.na 
          3. Pan-av-iramadek-iv-arat-a. 
           
          So  far  I  have been unable to find  any information about these 
          books.  I will of course be consulting all  the reference books I 
          have available in  LOC.   Does anyone out there however have  any 
          acquaintance with these works?   I  am particularly interested in 
          whether mss  of  them  are abundant, whether they have ever  been 
          published, and whether they are important enough to purchase in a 
          time of budget stringency and  in view of LOC's general policy of 
          not purchasing non-American mss. 
           
          Diacritics should be read with the letter following them. 
           
          Thanks for any help.
