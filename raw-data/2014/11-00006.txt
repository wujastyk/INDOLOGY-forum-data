Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit scans database
Message-ID: <4B4DA848863D48EBA489DABA51DA2D1F@OliverHP>

Dear list,

a new resource for searching - partly undigitized - Sanskrit books is available at
http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/sanskrit-scans/query.php

The website gives you access to a database of Sanskrit books that have been digitized WITHOUT manual correction. This is the very first release, and I'm planning to increase the database with scanned texts that are freely available in the web.
To search the database, enter a word in simplified Harvard-Kyoto in the search field (e.g., narmada or sarasvati*), and press the button 'Search'. Enter does not work at the moment. More details about the input conventions are available when you press the help button on the website. The rest of the website should be self explanatory.


Best wishes, Oliver
