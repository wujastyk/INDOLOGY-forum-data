Dear Indologysts

The publication of the German translation of the Vi??upur??a provides 
the occasion to make the transliterated version of the Sanskrit text as 
constituted by the Critical Edition available in electronic form.

It is a great pleasure for me to be able to acknowledge that the 
permission to make this electronic version of the constituted text 
available has been granted by the authorities of M. S. University of 
Baroda and of Prof. M. L. Wadekar, acting director of the Oriental 
Institute (email dated September 9, 2012). I wish to express my profound 
respect for the work done at the Oriental Institute and my immense 
gratitude for the long standing cooperation, support and generosity that 
has been accompanying my own work on and with the ViP, from 1975 till 
today.

For details about the files (sources, conventions of transliteration, 
etc.) deposited in the text archive of the Institute of Indology at the 
University of Z?rich 
(http://www.aoi.uzh.ch/indologie/teaching/textarchive.html) please see 
the file "ViPCE_transliteration".
