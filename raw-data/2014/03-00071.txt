Dear Everybody,I saw a figure of Ma Shashthi in a temple at Panchanantala, Howrah (on the other side of Kolkata Ganga) in my boyhood days. She was worshiped by the female family mothers of a mother giving birth to a babe on the eighth day of the child's birth. There was a ceremony of distributing eight kinds of fried snacks.I think the temple is still there, and the figure has not been done away with. The vehicle animal figure was a cat, I remember.BestDebabrata Chakrabarti

Yes, she seems to have been a popular subject in Kalighat painting. Officially it?s supposed to be a black cat, as in this splendid one in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, but often it isn?t: http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/88464.html
I am told that there is a temple of ?Ma Shoshthi? (with cat v?hana) in Kolkata, but I cannot find any pictures or information online. I am probably hampered by my lack of Bengali, as I wouldn?t be able to pick up if e.g. someone blogged about visiting it.

As I confessed at the outset, I don?t know much about these things; and, many traditional scholars (of Sanskrit & Tamil & religion) in South India are not in touch with ?modernism!' So much for our generation gap!
One way to preempt controversy and confusion would be to refer to the source of the art work with acknowledgement.

I do not know much about these things, but received a comment from a friend in India that "the Chinnamasta Devi does not have a lion for her vehicle.?


May I know the source of the picture on the cover, so I can write to him and clear his doubt? (He is not a member of this group.)


Thanks,Rajam
