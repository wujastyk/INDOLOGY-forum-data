Hello All,

Thank you,

*International Journal of Dharma and Hindu Studies*



*Call for papers for inaugural issue*

*International Journal of Dharma and Hindu Studies* is a peer reviewed
international journal published online by Hindu University of America
dedicated to Dharma and Hindu studies covering all the religions with roots
in Vedic philosophy and originated from India.

The journal invites original scholarly articles for publication in its
inaugural issue scheduled to launch in October, 2014.

The journal is dedicated to encourage scholarly inquiry into the study of
all aspects of Hinduism. Hence, the inaugural issue of the journal is
especially interested in papers on subjects related to the examination of
original sources of Hinduism, and other Dharma traditions of India. The
journal seeks interdisciplinary analytical studies of original texts,
myths, archaeology, sacred geography, cosmology and cosmogony of Dharma,
and Hindu traditions. Historical, religious and cultural interpretation of
the multiple aspects of Hinduism and Dharma traditions, as adapted to
modern life also forms the central focus of the inaugural issue.
