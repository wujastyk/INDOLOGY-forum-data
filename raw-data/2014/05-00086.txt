Announcement of a PhD Scholarship in the History of Mathematical Sciences in India

An international project on the history of mathematical sciences in Sanskrit sources has  been awarded a
five-year grant from New Zealand's funds for research excellence, the Rutherford Discovery Fellows, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.
(http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/rutherford-discovery/news/2012-rdfs)

The 5-year project is entitled "New perspectives on the history of the exact sciences in second millennium Sanskrit sources".

As part of the activities of this project, the investigators are offering a PhD scholarship jointly with the Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI) in Chennai, India.  The scholarship will provide an annual living allowance/stipend of NZ$25,000 and full tuition costs while in New Zealand and an allowance in Indian Rupees commensurate with living expenses while resident in India. It  is tenable for study towards the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the appropriate department or program on the topic of the history of mathematical sciences, at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand (http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).

The awardee will research and write a PhD thesis under a supervisory committee including the Principal Investigator, Dr Clemency Montelle,  Associate Investigator, Dr Kim Plofker, and, where appropriate, scholars at  associated  institution(s).  The thesis topic will relate to the project goals, e.g., a critical edition with translation and commentary of a previously unpublished text on Sanskrit computational astronomy.  Approximately one-third  of the study and research for the thesis will be carried out under the auspices of CMI, based on materials and training at CMI and/or neighbouring institutions.

The successful applicant will meet the following criteria at the time of appointment:

- sufficient knowledge of and interest in some combination of relevant fields of study, within history of the mathematical sciences and/or Indology, to design and complete under the supervisor's guidance a doctoral thesis relating to the project's objectives;
- ability to enroll for a three-year  PhD programme at the University of Canterbury.

With the approval of the Principal Investigator, this position may be held concurrently with any other scholarship, award, or bursary, excluding any such award requiring teaching or other duties separate from this project.  For further details, please consult the UC doctoral regulations.
