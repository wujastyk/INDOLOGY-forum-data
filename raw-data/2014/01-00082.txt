Dear Colleague,
The answer might lie in the emergence of the kaaya theory along with the
docetic concept of an apparitional (nirmaa.nakaaya)Buddha among the
Maahaasaa.nghikas.
Could you consult the Journal of research, Visva Bharati, vol.i, part 1,
1976-77: 41ff? I made some preliminary observations on the emergence oif
the kaaya concept. It seems that the concept of a Buddha which is not the
historical one should have originated among the Maahaasaa.nghikas.
Best
