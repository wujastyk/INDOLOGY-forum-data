I would like to draw your attention to V. Raghavan's (separately published) paper (33 pp.)

Yantras or Mechanical Contrivances in Ancient India. 

Transaction no. 10 (2nd edition)
The Indian Institute of Culture
(6, North Public Square Road, Bangalore 4)
1956

He also deals with "aerial vehicles" extensively, with text passages taken from Epic and Classical literature but also (importantly) from:
* Mane?vara's M?nasoll?sa (c. 1131 CE) and 
* Bhoja's  ?r?g?rama?jar? and his Samar??ga?as?tradh?ra.

Extensive description of a light wood bird, with several fires heating mercury inside? 

Amusingly, the texts often refer to the technical knowledge of ?  the Yavana.

Cheers!

Michael
