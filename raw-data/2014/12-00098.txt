Dear? Indologists,According to Panini's Grammar it is well advisable that we accept prapyate as a passive form of causative prapayati .Then it is construed with the accusative form svargam.It has also been suggested by Prof Cardona.Girish K. JhaProfessor,Dept of SanskritPatna UniversityPatna 800 005?

Thanks! But my intention was not one of clarifying the usage but of drawing attention to the elusive character of the solutions offered. I never got a satisfactory answer to the problems associated with abhidhaana, with due respect, even from Pata;njali.

Dear Dipak,
? ? ?Thanks for these clarifying comments.? The syntax of constructions with passive forms of ?ak is very complicated.? Pata?jali's usage of "?akyam (neuter nom) c?nena ?vam??s?dibhir api k?ut (fem nom) pratihantum" in the Mah?bh??ya has generated long debates in the commentaries.? With best wishes,
Madhav

<sabh?mv? na prave??avyam (Manu 8.13)>30 12 14Dear Colleagues,Perhaps the P??inian assessment of the case is notexactly what has been observed here. According to the P??inian system the k?tya-categorysuffixes may mean the action or the object (3.4.70). When action is meant by thesuffix in prave??avyam it does not affect the object of the active voicewhich shall retain its second (dvit?y?) case-ending by 2.3.1 and 2.3.2. Thisexplains sabh?m. But when it means the object it becomes an adjective itmust have the number, gender etc of the object.?The above means that in the P??inian system theproblem of M?dhav which occurs with a finite verb and not with a k?tya-suffixis not solved by the example from Manu. In the sentence cited by Madhav, whichhas a passive-voice, the object is understood as abhihita (by 3.4.69) andnormally its case-ending should be the first one by 2.3.46. I just put the P??inian point of view without anyclaim to its theoretical correctness. The basic problems of the P??inianstandpoint have been dealt with by me in a recent publication on P??ini withstatement of its opponents' standpoints. But I have not yet got a copy of thebook. The problem of accord between the k?tya-endingword and its corresponding noun has often to be faced in Sanskrit. Cf., ?akyama?jalibhi? p?tu? v?t?? ketakagandhina? R?m., Ki?kindh? 28.8. Here too ?akyamis taken to mean the action.My best wishes for all for a happy 2015DB

Of all the explanations I have received, this one seems most convincing, and especially the example from Manu seems like a good parallel.? Thanks, Hans.

Hi, Madhav.
If pr?pyate?is construed as a verb of motion (in the sense ?reach?), the structure has precedents; compare the structure below, which shows that with verbs of motion the goal is not always construed as object in post-Vedic. Of course, the parallel with?labhate?might suggest an interpretation ?obtain?. In that case (i.e., if it is not to be taken as a motion verb), there may be a parallel in late Sanskrit (one of the versions of the Vet?lapa?cavi??ati, perhaps the one edited by Uhle); unfortunately I can?t find the exact reference.
sabh?m v? na prave??avyam (Manu 8.13)
All the best for the New Year,

n a Sanskrit work titled Nity?c?radarpa?a by Brahm?nanda, on p. 2, I see a quotation from Dak?asm?ti:

??????????? ???????????????? ?????: ?
???????????????? ??????????????????????? ????? ??

Here, ?c?r?t pr?pyate svargam is an irregular usage, unless one assumes that the word svarga is somehow used in neuter gender.? With the normal masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.? In Marathi, such passive constructions are possible: ?????? (instrumental) ??????? (accusative) ?????? (passive verb).? This usage alternates with a more Sanskrit like passive: ?????? ???? (nom) ??????/????? (nom).? I am wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bh?ve) constructions where the object shows up in the accusative case.? Any information or suggestions are appreciated.
