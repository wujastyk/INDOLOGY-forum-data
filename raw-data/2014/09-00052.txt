 Assistant Professor in Hindu Traditions

The Department of Religion at Emory University invites applications for an
assistant professor appointment in Hindu traditions, beginning in Fall
2015, with primary research in one or more regional languages and
traditions. Preference is for colonial and/or pre-colonial period of
specialization. The successful candidate must have capacity to guide
graduate research in Hindu traditions and teach undergraduate courses on
Hinduism. We seek a scholar who will complement existing strengths at Emory
University in South Asian religions and who has the agility to engage in
robust interdisciplinary conversations in the Department of Religion and
the Graduate Division of Religion. PhD is required by the time of
appointment, as well as excellent teaching potential in both the college
and the graduate school. Letters of application, curriculum vitae, writing
sample, and three letters of recommendation should be submitted
electronically by October 15, 2014, to Gary Laderman, Hindu Traditions
Search Committee Chair (hinduismsearch at emory.edu). Members of the committee
will conduct preliminary interviews at the American Academy of Religion
conference in San Diego. Emory University is an Equal
Opportunity/Affirmative Action/Disability/Veteran employer. Women,
minorities, persons with disabilities and veterans are encouraged to apply.
