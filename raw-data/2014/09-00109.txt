Dear List,

Back after vacations and back to King Vena's story.

My search for a digitalized version of the *Vishnudharmottara-purana* was
unsuccessful. Two websites offer the pdf, but not without a specific price:
a bunch of files (seen as high-risk malware by my anti-virus program) to be
downloaded before the main pdf's download.

Could someone, please - someone with ready access to the text - scan for me
the pages (kanda I, 108-109) referring to King Anga, his son Vena and his
grandson Prithu?

With eternal gratitude (in advance!)

Artur Karp
