There is an interview of Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat
in The Hindu dated 27 november 2014.

The link is:

"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/interview-with-dr-pierre-sylvain-filliozat/article6639706.ece?ref=sliderNews"

The title is "Paninian from Paris".

The interview contains three reference to M. S. Narasimhacharya,
in the passages which read:

?Filliozat studied classical languages in Paris, and Vyakarana and 
Saiva agamas in Pondicherry, under M. S. Narasimhacharya and N.R. 
Bhatt, respectively. He learnt about Visishtadvaita too from 
Narasimhacharya.?

??Someone like my teacher Narasimhacharya, had no difficulty following 
any of this, because he had committed the Sutras to memory. But if you 
are using a book, you will have a tough time.??

P.S. in case the WebMail through which I am sending this has messed up
