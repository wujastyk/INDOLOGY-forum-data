Dear colleagues,

it is with deep regret that I convey to you the sad news of the passing away 
of our beloved teacher and good friend Professor Michael Hahn. After a 
prolonged illness this distinguished scholar left us peacefully in the evening 
of July 12, 2014. For almost two decades from 1988 till 2006 Professor 
Michael Hahn held the chair of the Department of Indology and Tibetology at 
the University of Marburg, where he fostered many students and contributed 
numerous books and articles. Even to the very last days of his fruitful life, 
despite the impediments of his illness, he was always keen to promote 
scholarship and generously shared his vast knowledge. We will all dearly 
miss him. A small memorial service will be held today at 5 p.m. in the St. 
Elisabeth-Hospiz in Marburg. At present arrangements for a funeral service at 
his birthplace in Otterndorf are being made.

Kind regards,
Dragomir Dimitrov
