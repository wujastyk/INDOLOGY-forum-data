Subject: [INDOLOGY] Origin of the term "Indology"
Message-ID: <web-141604447@univ-paris7.fr>

Dear Peter,

you might want to see the diagram obtained
when you add a fourth term to the list,
as seen in:

"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=indologie%2Cindianisme%2C%C3%A9tudes+indiennes%2C+civilisation+indienne&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=19&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t4%3B%2Cindologie%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bindologie%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BIndologie%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Cindianisme%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bindianisme%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BIndianisme%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BINDIANISME%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2C%C3%A9tudes%20indiennes%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3B%C3%A9tudes%20indiennes%3B%2Cc0%3B%3B%C3%89tudes%20indiennes%3B%2Cc0%3B%3B%C3%89tudes%20Indiennes%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Ccivilisation%20indienne%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcivilisation%20indienne%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCivilisation%20indienne%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCivilisation%20Indienne%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCIVILISATION%20INDIENNE%3B%2Cc0"


The fact that "civilisation indienne" has more hits that "indianisme",
which has more hits that "indologie", which has more hits than "?tudes 
indiennes" will probably be self-explanatory to those who are familiar 
with the French Academic landscape, and know about the ICI (Institut 
de Civilisation Indienne), with the BEI (Bulletin d'?tudes Indiennes, 
etc.)


As one who was an eye-witness of the closing down, in the early 
nineties, of the "section 40" of the CNRS (Centre National de la 
Recherche Scientifique), I am well aware of the possible consequences 
(in the administrative realm) of statements concerning the inexistence 
of a word (or of a combination of words).


What will happen to the EPHE is someone starts to explain, 
/doctement/, that:

"Les sciences philologiques n'existent pas r?ellement"

(http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/recherche/section-des-sciences-historiques-et-philologiques/)

"Les sciences religieuses n'existent pas r?ellement"

(http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/recherche/section-des-sciences-religieuses/),

etc.
