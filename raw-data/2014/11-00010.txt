Subject: [INDOLOGY] Childhood and Children in Ancient India
Message-ID: <bfb544237ece4f72b7aad0cadc9df42a@BY2PR06MB188.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear colleagues,

I would be grateful for further recommendations of secondary studies pertaining to childhood and children in ancient India, especially those with a historical, epigraphical, or literary focus.  I am aware of the studies below that touch on some aspects of children?s lives and training. The literature on sons specifically is easier to find, but it clusters around the ideal twelve-sons categorization in Dharmasastra.  I?m looking for studies outside of Dharmasastra, if possible.  SARDS-3 was helpful.  Is there nothing more like Phillipe Aries?s Centuries of Childhood, for those of you who may know it?  Any leads would be appreciated.

Thanks,
