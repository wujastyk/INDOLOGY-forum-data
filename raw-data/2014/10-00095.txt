I am not sure whether it has been mentioned or not, but I have long used a handy Word macro written a decade ago by Ferenc Ruzsa.  It still works beautifully in my Word for Mac (just as it did when I used a PC).  I simply insert it into the macros, and then assign a keystroke to invoke it (e.g., Command-0).  There is one to convert Unicode transliteration to Unicode Devanagari, and another to reverse the process.  Just select the text to be converted and press a button.  If you want a space between a final consonant-with-vir?ma and the da??a, or to force a vir?ma, you need to insert two spaces after the Roman consonant.  The Rom>Dev macro produces nice results in most Devanagari fonts.  The macros are attached.

Best wishes to all,

To add to the flurry of options here, I have found the Sanskrit Library's transliteration tool quite useful for this purpose: http://sanskritlibrary.org/tomcat/sl/TranscodeText

?Cheers,

Tim

Dear friends,

I would appreciate recommendations for a readily available, efficient and accurate
program to convert unicode Sanskrit romanization to devanagari. (Vedic accents
are not needed.)

with thanks in advance for your suggestions,
Matthew
