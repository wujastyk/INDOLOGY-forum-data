"I am happy to inform you that one of my disciples has translated  
Herman Hess' classic novel "SIDDHARTHA" into Sanskrit from its English  
translation by HILDA ROSNER.

We wish to send a copy of this translation to Sanskrit scholars and  
Universities in Europe/America. Would you please provide us the names  
and email address of scholars and universities who might be interested  
in having the translation?"
