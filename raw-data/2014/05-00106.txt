Dear Dominik,
I received the following message from MLBD:

Dear Eli Franco

Mein Kampf has not been published by us. It is on our website as we  
also distribute books of other publishers. However, we deeply  
appreciate your concern. In response to your petition, we are removing  
it from our website and catalogue and will stop selling it with  
immediate effect.

We have no words to express our gratitude to you for taking the  
trouble to write to us.

Kindly circulate this mail to all those who have signed the petition  
and also to those who have not signed it.


With regards
Poonam
