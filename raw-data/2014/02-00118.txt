I did not know about this author and the articles in Desh. Thanks for that. I would only like to add that Sri Aurobindo never had any doubts about the true evil character of national socialism and wholeheartedly supported the Allies.

Any precise reference to ?r? Aurobindo's statement in his literature (Complete Works?) would be welcomed.

Thanks in advance.
