Also not mentioned: the most detailed data on the numeral system in Sanskrit (also historical) are found in:

Wackernagel & Debrunner, Altindische Grammatik, vol.III (Noun and pronoun)

Author :	Wackernagel, Jacob
Title :	Altindische Grammatik, von Jakob Wackernagel und Albert Debrunner.
Published :	 G?ttingen, Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1957.

But you would have to be able to read German.

On the one hand, I am interested in numeral systems as a subgrammar of a natural language illustrating many of the problems of the larger grammar of which it is a part; and on the other hand, once I work out the details for a language, I then formulate an exercise,on the basis of the grammar I have worked out, for my students in my course, Introduction to Semantics.
