See:
Upadhyaya, Ramji/Ramaji. Adhunika Samskrta naataka. (Hindi)
Varnekara/Warnekara, S.B. 1963. Arvaciina Sa.smk.rta saahitya (Marathi)
 Sam?skr?ta va?n?maya kos?a / sampa?daka S?ri?dhara Bha?skara Varn?ekara. Kalakatta? : Bha?rati?ya Bha?sha? Parishada, 1988.


See also the surveys of modern Skt literature written by V. Raghavan for the Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, roughly from 1960-1974.


Since I am traveling, I do not have these books at hand to give page references, but they should have something more than what the Internet tells you.

I do not know if S?evad?e is still with us but I believe that some of you might know more about Brahma?nanda Tripa?t?hi? than what the Internet tells us. I will be very much thankful if anybody could let me know any piece of information regarding them, their disciples/ successors or relatives.
