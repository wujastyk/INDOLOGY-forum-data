It seems to me that quite a lot of it , not just ?liberal dubo toto suferanza?, is made up from Western languages. E.g. ?Adythum? < adytum, the sanctuary of a temple in ancient Greece. ??sicurah? non lasharay? sounds again like garbled Italian (We won?t leave <lasciare you safe <sicuro?). In the final passage quoted, there is also a lot more material in the ?translation? than can be accounted for by the ?original?.
