Dear Professor Brockington,

I believe this should be Damilica, and the volume you're looking for belongs to:

Damilica - journal of the Tamilnadu State Dept. of Archaeology =
Tamil?akam : Tamil?na?t?u Aracu Tol Iyal Tur?ai a?n?t?ital?  (1970-)

Cornell does not have Damilica, but various universities on Borrow
Direct do (one lists specifically a vol. 2.3 from 1973). I'd be happy
to order it, yet perhaps someone from UChicago, UPenn or Harvard is
reading this and could get it for you more quickly.

All the best,
     Antonia Ruppel
