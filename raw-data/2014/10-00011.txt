Dear Christophe,

could it be that my phrase ?ideologically biased ascriptions" was
misunderstood?
Being rather aware of all that you mentioned (i.e., the research [Hacker,
Nakamura, etc.],
the Advaita Ved?nta tradition's ?inclusivisms? [to say it with one of
Hacker's notions] etc.),
it should be clear that what I characterized by that phrase were exactly
those traditionally
performed ascriptions ? given these are still very much alive in
contemporary India.
How else to characterize this kind of ?living reception? of traditional
history?
Is it not ?ideologically biased? for you?

No doubt, I would advise contextual sensitivity when being in India and
addressing
such things (say, in Sringeri, Kanchi or Chennai), but a minimum of
explicit critical
awareness should better not endorse these as a sort of generally accepted
views
among indologists.

Well, the general fact of these ?inclusivisms? being too long already known
to me
in order to still consider them as ?highly? significant, you are of course
perfectly
right with what I assume you implied to say: that further research into
their contextual
circumstances and dynamisms of development would be highly appreciated.
Personally, by the way, given the fundamental significance given to it, I
am rather
curious to learn about pertinent new research ? that is, research which not
already
on the title page proclaims naive assumptions of authorship ? with regard
to the
Vivekac???ma?i. Probably we share this interest.

Best wishes,

Hartmut Buescher
