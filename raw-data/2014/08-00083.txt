Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Longevity of Crows
Message-ID: <53F54A7D.8070400@berkeley.edu>

Dear list,

I'm posting this on behalf of Robert Goldman, who has been having 
trouble sending messages to the list.

Has someone ever come across any references to crows being, if not 
immortal, then very long lived and not dying of disease or other natural 
causes?

At /R?m/. 7.18. 23?25 Dharma (Yama) who had hidden from R?va?a by taking 
the form of a crow, blesses the bird as follows.

?Then, O R?ma, King Dharma addressed that crow, which now was perched on 
the beam of the eastern sacrificial hall: ?O bird, I am pleased with 
you. Now hear my words of gratitude. Since I am pleased, those various 
ailments with which I afflict other creatures shall have no power over 
you. Of this there can be no doubt. ?Through my boon, O sky-going bird, 
you shall have no fear of death. Indeed, so long as men do not kill you, 
you shall live forever."

We haven't been able to locate any other literary or folkloric source 
for this.

Thanks for any replies.
