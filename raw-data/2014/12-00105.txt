The other reading is found in the later and northern manuscripts; the important southern transmission in Grantha, Telugu, and Malayalam script manuscripts have Medh's reading; and so do medieval authors such as Vij??ne?vara, Apar?rka, and Deva??abha??a. Here are the manuscripts recording sabh? v? na prave??avy? in my note (the small letter in front of the sigla indicate the script):

The alternate is given by Ku and Rn, but Ku acknowledges the correctness of Me's reading: medh?tithin? tu sabh? v? na prave??avy? iti r?jv eva pa?hitam.

Thus Medh?tithi, and Kull?ka remarks medh?tithin? tu sabh? v? na prave??avyeti ?jveva pa?hitam.  Doubtless, the apparatus on this verse in Patrick Olivelle?s critical edition, to which I do not have access at the moment, can contribute here.  George

Of course, the parallel with labhate might suggest an interpretation ?obtain?. In that case (i.e., if it is not to be taken as a motion verb), there may be a parallel in late Sanskrit (one of the versions of the Vet?lapa?cavi??ati, perhaps the one edited by Uhle); unfortunately I can?t find the exact reference.

With the normal masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.  In Marathi, such passive constructions are possible: ?????? (instrumental) ??????? (accusative) ?????? (passive verb).  This usage alternates with a more Sanskrit like passive: ?????? ???? (nom) ??????/????? (nom).  I am wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bh?ve) constructions where the object shows up in the accusative case.  Any information or suggestions are appreciated.
