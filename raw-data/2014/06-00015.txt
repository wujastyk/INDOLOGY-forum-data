Subject: [INDOLOGY] Anusvara plus nasal

Dear Franco,

Elisa Frechi and Tyler Williams have suggested the same to me off-list, 
i.e. that the use of anusvara before a nasal stop indicates the 
nasalization of the preceeding vowel.

Tyler Williams further suggests that it is likely due to "the influence 
of the phonology and orthography of the vernaculars". This would fit 
well with the "vernacularized" (Gujarati/Rajastahani) circumstances in 
which I have come across the most examples.

Best,
Jacob
