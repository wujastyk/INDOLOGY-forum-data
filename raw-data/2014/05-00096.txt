Dear List members,

I add that the Indian version of the MLBD News letter has no advertisement
of the Mein Kampf.

Secondly, H.Oldenberg was one of the ideological forerunners of Hitler. He
explicitly stated that the Aryan race in India lost their purity and
culture by blood mixture with non-Aryan Indians. He maintained that blood
was the soul of the man.
To these rustic primitive ideas Oldenberg added his myth -- unfortunately
shared by many 'scientific' minded Indologists - that the Greeks etc were
pure Indo-European races. As if there were no pre-Indo-European indigenous
people in the lands of Europe before the invasion/ migration by the
Indo-Europeans. The question whether the primitive Indo-Europeans had been
a race or communities with cultural affinity unit was, of course, too
refined for Oldenberg.

My question is why should we not first recommend writing off Oldenberg's *Die
Literatur des  alten Indien*, 2nd ed., Stuttgart 1923 where the racist
ideas of Oldenberg prominently occur, from the lsts of recommended books in
the Universities?
