Dear Dr Montelle,

Besides the seminal work by Janetr suggested by Prof. Slaje and the two 
Gujarati works suggested by Dr Patel, it is worth having a look at 
Murthy's Introduction to Manuscriptology. According to Murthy (p. 109), 
"In a context, letter/s or word/s may have to be omitted. [...] 
sometimes, yellow pigment or turmeric is smeared over such portion."

This technique was very widespread, but judging from the manuscripts in 
our Cambridge collection (a fair sample of 1600 mss) I have the 
impression that it was applied more often on paper manuscripts, whereas 
in the case of palm-leaf manuscripts other techniques were more often 
employed -- for instance, expunction, deletion or erasing of the 
relevant aksaras or of an entire passage. Yet we do not have any 
quantitative study.

Another very useful book that you can consult on the topic of 
corrections is of course

Einicke, Katrin:
Korrektur, Differenzierung und Abk?rzung in indischen Inschriften und 
Handschriften / Katrin Einicke. - Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 2009.

Best wishes,

Camillo Formigatti
