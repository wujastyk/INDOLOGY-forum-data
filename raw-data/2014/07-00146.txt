Dear Manu,



Thanks for confirming my understanding of the epigraphic data.


It is interesting that we seem to have no references to Savar?as outside the Tamil country while we do have references to Amba?thas in the north.


The origin of Savar?as given by the Dharmas?tras is not convincing to me for the following reason. There were no 'native' K?atriyas in the Tamil country. Even if one considers the Tamil kings who have gone through the Hira?yagarbha ceremony to be K?atriyas, I do not know of any evidence for a large number of Tamil (C??a and P???iya) royal women marrying brahmins to produce a class of Savar?as. On the other hand, in Kerala, we have Nambudiri brahmins marrying princesses to produce offsprings who were considered K?atriyas and not Br?hma?as or Savar?as. If these Savar?as had migrated from north of Tamil Nadu, there should have been some evidence for their presence there. But we do not seem to have any such data. 


What is interesting is that in a 13th century inscription, one Savar?a is described as a cook in the Madurai temple. But his village was Maruttuvakku?i (meaning 'village of physicians'). This suggests that even though his ancestors were probably physicians, he had taken up employment in the Madurai temple as a cook. If he had not been considered a Br?hma?a in practice, I do not think he would have been appointed as a cook in this famous brahminical temple. Today we hear of no Savar?as in the Tamil country.


As for 'Amba??ha', we have an 'Amba??ha' translated by Hultzsch as 'barber' (based on the modern usage). But this Amba??ha had the title ca?a?kavi (Tamilized form of '?a?a?gavid') which was usually associated with Brahmins in many inscriptions. 


This seems to suggest that while the Dharmas?tras might have come up with theoretical names for possible permutations and combinations of var?as and their derivatives, at least in the Tamil country, between 11th and 13th centuries Savar?a and Amba??ha seem to have referred to Brahmins who hailed from families of physicians. 


If you have information related to the inscription mentioning Savar?a-v?tti, that will be wonderful. I would also appreciate if you have any information on the Savar?as engaged in other occupations.


Thanks


Regards,
Palaniappan

Dear Palaniappan,
I find in my files 10 hits of inscriptions mentioned in the ARE that use the word savar.na. I have not checked all, but most are from TN and indeed seem to confirm that this word is used mostly for physicians.

I can check thoroughly, if needed.

Best.

Thank you for the information. This is interesting. Given that Savar?as are most often seen as physicians, I would have expected savar?a-v?tti to be glossed as a grant for the livelihood of a physician instead of a scribe. Is the posted interpretation given by Sircar or T. N. Subramanian? Is there any reference to an inscription or SITI reference?

Possibly, it is a question of a rather late inscriptions.
In any case, I didn't find "savarNa" mentions in my base (and don't remember such definitions) in texts of inscriptions till the V-VIII centuries.
Interestingly, that D. Ch. Sircar in his Epigraphical Glossary mentions savarNa only once (savarNa-vRtti = profession of writing the document).
And just refers to a South Indian Temple Inscriptions by T.N. Subramanian

In an inscription of ca. 1009, Brahmin villages, Vaikh?nasa villages, and Savar?a villages are mentioned separately. (E. Hultzsch, the editor of the inscription corrects the reading of 'Cava??ar' as 'cama?ar' and interprets them as Jains. This correction was not necessary.) There are other inscriptions where individuals mentioned as Savar?a are listed with their Brahminical gotras and at least in one inscription a Savar?a is described as belonging to Bh?radv?ja gotra and Bodh?yana s?tra. One inscription mentions 32 Savar?as being given 32 house sites as an agrahara. These Savar?as seemed to have functioned as physicians. It is clear that they were Brahmins but are classified as separate from 'Br?hma?a'. K. V. Subrahmanya Aiyer mentions (without citing the specific reference) Y?davaprak??a as explaining in his work Vaijayanti that Savar?a was an offspring of a Brahmin father and a K?atriya mother. To me this explanation seems to be suspect. It looks like a section of Brahmins was willing to engage in professions such as being musicians, physicians, etc., notwithstanding any objections from the orthodox Vedic Brahmins who  seemed to have reserved for themselves the designation 'Br?hma?a' (without any modifier), at least in the beginning.  Inscriptions also differentiate Br??ma?a from ?iva-Br?h?a?a. (The Tamil epic Cilappatik?ram mentions the music-loving Brahmins as having their own quarters separate from Vedic Brahmins.)  This is similar to the adoption of the Tamil classical dance form by the Brahmins in the 20th century. In spite of the earlier objections from orthodox Brahmins, that dance form has become very popular among all Tamil Brahmins nowadays. Tamil Brahmins serving as physicians also seem to have gained acceptance from the orthodox over time. I would like to know if 'Savar?a' as a Brahmin was known to texts/inscriptions outside the Tamil region. 


 
Thanks in advance.

Palaniappan
