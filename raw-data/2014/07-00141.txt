Subject: [INDOLOGY] BrahmaNa and SavarNa
Message-ID: <CAJGj9ebie_O8G8PkTJf3Sqho5wrPXeSfPXxFdFiyGUGrjb+wwQ@mail.gmail.com>

The VN Jha article pp 274 has the following lines:


"Accordingly, Baudhayanal)a nd Gautama2), as inter-preted by Haradatta,
state that the offspring of a brahmana from a Ksatriyaw ife is as much a
savarnaa nd a brahmanaa s is a son begotten from a savarya wife".



"as much a savarna " does not help to understand savarNa as a separate
category than brahmaNa as found in the inscription under discussion.

Nagaraj
