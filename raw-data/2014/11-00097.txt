McComas,  thanks for sharing this essay--it seems to me a very fair summary
of the conflation of legal issues and the threats --overt or covert-- of violence
on behalf of "hurt sensibilities."

But I was correspondingly dismayed when my publisher prematurely capitulated in a patently winnable law case, and publicly cooperated with those who oppose free speech and promote a view of Indian history, culture and public life with which I profoundly disagree.

> I therefore wrote to Random House Penguin India, saying that I was now ashamed to be associated with them, and that I would like to stop my book being published and distributed by them.  They wrote back (within five minutes) saying that they would let my book go, since they did not wish to hold on to an author who was unwilling to be published by them.  It has taken some time, but I have now signed the final papers severing my publication contract with Random House Penguin India.  All rights relating to the book have now reverted to me.  The negotiations were civil, even friendly.

> There's a twist.  In 2002, Penguin Books India sold Penguin UK a license to publish my Roots book (they're different companies).  That resulted in a new, revised, re-typeset and freshly indexed third edition that appeared in 2003.  As I understand it, that 2003 UK edition (with Dhanvantari on the cover) remains available<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Roots-Ayurveda-Selections-Sanskrit-Writings/dp/0140448241>.
