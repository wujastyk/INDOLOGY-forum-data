Dear Ashok,

Thank you for your comments.

(1) I recognize that my use of "causative" was inexact and "agentive" would have been better.

(2) Can the Tibetan not be understood in any way other than 'It is the finest transformer because it causes very great transformation'." 
The short answer is "no." 'Sgyur' can also mean "to translate," but that makes no sense in this context.

best regards,
Matthew
