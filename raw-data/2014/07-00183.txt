Dear Michael,

As I recall, Gerry Larson is quite knowledgeable on the subject. I have not heard from him in some years, but I think that he is still in or around Santa Barbara.
Try to contact him via UCSB.
Best,
Ken

Subject: [INDOLOGY] asatkhy?tiv?da

Dear list members,

I am currently becoming more interested in the doctrine of asatkhy?tiv?da and its critique by later Brahmanical thinkers. The primary sources I have read (e.g., V?caspati and Citsukha) present it in a confused and rather unconvincing way, and the secondary sources I have seen are threadbare.
Does anyone know of a good specialist study of this doctrine and its origins?

Many thanks,

Michael Williams,
University of Vienna.
