Message-ID: <CAGCGLoBxpo3Cwa4=vkbn0S2oJ+e-se+H-w2RAqb6mn-Y8sN1pg@mail.gmail.com>

16th World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok, Thailand 28 June?02 July 2015:
Section of Linguistics
New closing date for the submission of abstracts: 30 NOVEMBER 2014

Linguistics is one of the most widely recognized branches of science
represented at all major universities in the world.  It is also the
scientific discipline where solid and clearly identifiable pioneering
achievements of the Sanskrit tradition from the first millennium before CE
onwards (in the form of the linguistic analyses of the Padak?ras, P??ini?s
grammar, Bhartrhari?s linguistic theories, etc.) are most widely
recognized. Abstracts of papers in the broad domain of Sanskrit Linguistics
are invited preferably in English because of its general accessibility, but
also, in view of its long-standing status as academic language in
linguistics, in Sanskrit. All abstracts proposed for the Section of
Linguistics will be judged in the same transparent way according to the
originality of the contribution (ap?rvatva), the indication of evidence in
the form of linguistic observations and citation of sources (pratyak?a),
the theoretical framework (?gama), and, if applicable, a summary of the
argument (anum?na). Papers which primarily deal with philological problems
or with non-linguistic topics will be referred to one of the other
Sections, for which please see:
www.sanskrit-silpakorn.org/images/pdf/16th-WORLD-SANSKRIT-CONFERENCE.pdf
where also the form for submission of the abstract can be found.
