Dear Professor Brockington,
It happens that I scanned parts of this issue of Damilica a few months ago.
Here it is:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/h0ehe8hpdv5vun6/Damilica_vol_2_part_3.pdf
The transliteration of the sitename according to Madras Tamil Lexicon is
K?purappa??i.

The R?m?ya?a panels are miniature panels frequently found on the base of
C??a period temples.
If you are interested, my colleague Charlotte Schmid (EFEO) has scans to
share of the series of miniature panels.
With very best wishes.
