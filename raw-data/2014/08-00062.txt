Dear Colleagues

I checked with Oxford University Press on whether there is an ebook version
of

The Rigveda
3-Volume Set
Edited and translated by Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton
Hardcover
22 May 2014
1728 Pages
6-1/8 x 9-1/4 inches
ISBN: 9780199370184


They wrote back to say that they produce their ebooks in cooperation with
Amazon, but that there was no date yet scheduled for when this title might
become available.

Cheers
