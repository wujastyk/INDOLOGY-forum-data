Subject: [INDOLOGY] Font with Brahmi characters
Message-ID: <53DEB143.1040708@gmail.com>

I recently heard about Google Noto fonts (somewhere - perhaps even 
here?), which include Noto Sans Brahmi: 
http://www.google.com/get/noto/#/family/noto-sans-brah

Might be useful for those struggling with Unifont.

Cheers,
