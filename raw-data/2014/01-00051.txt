dear Dr Chakrabarti,

Thank you so very much for sharing this delightful biography. The lives of
our forebears are extremely interesting. I just a few days ago had the
opportunity to discover (again, with delight) the story of Hermann
Grassmann <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Grassmann>, whom we all
know for his work on the Veda, but who, it turns out, is one of the fathers
of linear algebra (I discovered this discussing with my son the question of
how one proves that 2 + 2 = 4, which turns out the involve, or can involve,
the Peano axioms, which owe much to Grassmann). In the biography of
Grassmann which I have seen, Sanskrit receives no more than a few lines
(just as the math is only mentioned in passing by Windisch p 365). I am
reminded of all of this of course by the connection between Winternitz and
Einstein.

In any case, thank you for this fascinating reminder, and for the idea to
do something to celebrate the life and contribution to a scholar who, among
other things, wrote the three volumes which probably sit near the desks of
most readers of the Indology list.
