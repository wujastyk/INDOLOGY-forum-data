Subject: [INDOLOGY] Horsch on the Wheel
Message-ID: <EEF6FCDE-771A-446E-9B55-EBF7F932B2C4@googlemail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am in search of Paul Horsch's paper 'The Wheel: an Indian Pattern of World-Interpretation', which was published in 'Sino-Indian Studies' ed. Kshitis Roy, W. Liebenthal Festschrift, vol. 5, (pts. 3 and 4), Visvabharati Santiniketan, 1957, pp. 62-79.

My library does not have it and I am pushed for time for an inter-library loan!

Thanks,

James Hegarty
