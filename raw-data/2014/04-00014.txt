> This (i.e. the KathAsaritsAgara, KSS) is just like (= as to the content identical with) the Original (mUla). There is not the slightest (manAg api)  excess (atikrama). Only of the size of the book a reduction is being performed and the language is effected (vidyate). Or: the language is being changed (bhidyate) regarding the reduction of / in order to reduce the size of the book.

> As far as possible (yathAshakty) literary conventions (lit.: fitting logical connection and syntax) (aucityAnvaya-rakshA) and the kAvya character (lit.: the connection (yojanA) with the being a part (amsha)  of kAvya)  are being kept (-rakshA  abhidhiiyate)  without destroying (a-vighAtena) the essence / core (rasa) of the stories.
