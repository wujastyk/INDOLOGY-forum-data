Dear Dhaval,

Very good.


Since you say- "The machine gives step by step derivation of words as per
prakriyA mentioned in Siddhantakaumudi.", may I make one suggestion?

1. In the derivation of rAmau (1/2 and 2/2), can you mention the
pratiprasava of 6.1.88?

Also

2. Can you number the steps?

with regards.
Malhar Kulkarni.
