Message-ID: <CALaEieiN4vWc4qRg3uzWadhbEe005kC8POj9Zih1cYs7myySDA@mail.gmail.com>

You may want to check this site

http://www.indianscriptures.com/scriptures/puranas-18-puranas-mahapurana/agni

Please see http:/www.dli.gov.in/ and archive.org. I am sure you will find
Agni Purana with text English and Hindi translations.
Why don't you search DLI and archive sites are not searched before asking
for books

Regards
