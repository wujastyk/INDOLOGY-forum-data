My first thought was that these might be what are called ???khal?s, chains,
which I've encountered in MSS of the A???dhy?y?. These are aids to memory
and recitation, like this:

ra??bhy?mubhau??unoda?sth???au

At first they look completely nonsensical.  The key is that they consist of
a concatenation of the opening part of the first and then each twentieth
s?tra in each p?da.  The final word a??au signifies that there are eight
s?tras to the end of the p?da. In the above, ra??bhy?m..., it's s?tras
8.4.1, 8.4.21, 8.4.41, 8.4.61, and then 8 s?tras to the end (counting
8.4.61).

You might be looking at something like this, but I can't make it work (in a
few minutes) for your case.

Best,
Dominik
