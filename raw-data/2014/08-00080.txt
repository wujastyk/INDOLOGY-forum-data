But the Cilappatik?ram (older than the Ma?im?kalai)  has the famous character of the Jaina scholar-nun Kavunti, about whom I wrote an article long ago :-). So if fictional women scholars also qualify for the list of references, see my ?The Jaina Nun Kavunti.? Bulletin d'?tudes indiennes (Paris) 5 (1987), pp. 387-417.
