Cultural Connections Between ancient Mesopotamia and India
Mesopotamia, the ?land between the rivers?, is in European scholarly thought part of the ?Orient?, the Eastern civilizations. The ?Oriental? influence on classical civilizations has long been recognized, yet Mesopotamia had, from early on, also connections with civilizations farther to the East, in particular to ancient India. Ancient Mesopotamian civilization is often seen as a ?precursor? to the Bible and to Christianity. This conference explores the Eastern connections of ancient Mesopotamian civilizations. This will be explored in a twofold manner: in some cases direct connections and contacts can be established, either via material or textual cultures. In other cases, a comparative approach has the potential of enhancing our understanding of these two ancient civilizations. In bringing together specialists of ancient Mesopotamia and ancient India, the conference will systematically gather the evidence and draw comparisons with the goal of re-orienting both Mesopotamian and Indian studies and offer a fresh perspective on the intellectual, religious, and material cultures of these two geographical areas.

The conference will take place at the University of Copenhagen, southern campus:
Place: Building 27.0.09
Karen Blixens Vej 4
2300 K?benhavn S
Denmark

Time: Sept. 12-14, 2014

Participation is free but we ask that those interested in participating register with Troels Arb?ll (tpa at hum.ku.dk)
