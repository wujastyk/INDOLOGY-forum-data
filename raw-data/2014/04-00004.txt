Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit position at Leiden University (with proper link)
Message-ID: <CACDreE8qyajPFvm3QzLm6A8JE8HaT6vqi6ChLFPgBo9TepR8Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Apparently the link did not come through correctly, so I am posting the
announcement once again:

Leiden University invites applications for a fulltime University
Lectureship in Sanskrit and Ancient Cultures of South Asia. Research
specialization is open. Teaching will include Sanskrit courses and
courses on premodern cultures and literatures of South Asia. This is a
temporary replacement position, and appointment will be fixed-term
from August 2014 through August 2016. Leiden University aims to employ
more women in areas where they are underrepresented. Women are
therefore especially invited to apply. Applications must be in by 5
May 2014. Before submitting your application or your query, please
read the full Call at
