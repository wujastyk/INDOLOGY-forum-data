Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit phone app
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CetiGhOoy2AujEwPv8fadApUX_8ycC6S_hkOmr52UyyMg@mail.gmail.com>

I recently installed the Sanskrit smartphone app by Liberation Philology
<http://www.libphil.ca/sanskrit.php>, and I'm liking it (no connection with
LP).  Like having Skt flashcards in your pocket.  Any other recommendations
for smartphone apps along these lines?

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
