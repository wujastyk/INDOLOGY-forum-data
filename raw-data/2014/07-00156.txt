Subject: [INDOLOGY] In search of an unpublished? work by L. Sternbach

Dear List,
In the ABORI 1980 article referred to below (http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/41691857), L. Sternbach refers several times in the foot-notes to a work by himself entitled
 "R?ja?ekhara and his Unknwon Verses"
without date nor place (but 'part', 'annex' and '?' are given).
This reference is also quoted by Sures Chandra Banerji in his Companion To Sanskrit Literature (1st ed. 1971, 2nd 1989), also by the only title.
It seems that this work intended to be published by Sternbach remained in press (or in state of manuscript) and never issued, as it does not appear in any catalogue of libraries (I tried KIT and other tools).
Thank you for any further information thereabout,
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
