Dear Jarrod,

You can answer those questions for yourself by checking Monier-Williams, 
where you will discover that Brahmin is indeed a bone fide Sanskrit term, at 
least as old as the ?ra?yakas.

See
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0741-brahmodumbara.jpg

for Braahma.n, this would follow the modern habit of dropping the final -a, 
since braahma.na is another term with a long history.
