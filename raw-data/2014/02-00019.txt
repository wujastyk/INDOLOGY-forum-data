Dear Members,
I am preparing an edition of ?nandavardhana's Dev??ataka, with the
commentary by Kayya?a (978 d.C.). The latter states in the pu?pik? that his
teacher was some ek?yanasya acyutatulyam?rter ?c?ryan?r?ya?agartanamna?.
Has anyone ever heard of him or has any hint about names ending in -garta?

Best wishes,

Alessandro Battistini
PhD candidate at Universit? di Roma La Sapienza
