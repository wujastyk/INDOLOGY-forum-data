> Indian Buddhism in Its Social Context: From Sakyamuni Buddha to the Present.
> ******************************************************************** 
> In a significant section of Indian historiography, Buddhism is believed to be a world-negating soteriology of ?asocial? monks. It is also generally believed that beyond the monastic walls, it hardly had any social presence. When the Turkic invasions destroyed the big monastic centres of Indian Buddhism, Buddhism simply disappeared from the land of its birth. This approach fails to explain why a religion without any social relevance survived in India for more than fifteen hundred years and why it was reinvented, reformulated and adopted in the context of social reform movements in Colonial and Post-Colonial India. In contemporary India, we see that Buddhism has become an essential component of Dalit identity formulation, mobilisation and consolidation. That is another indication of the continuing social relevance of Buddhism in India. 
> For long, study of ancient Indian Buddhist religious institutions has been dominated by art historical concerns only. A more pertinent approach may be to see them as important constituents of the overall societal matrix, as institutions in dynamic interaction with other societal institutions, acting and reacting with them, influencing them and getting influenced by them in turn. That is to say, Buddhist institutions must be visualised as social institutions, in dynamic interaction with other societal institutions. Unfortunately, Indian Buddhism has not been studied much from this perspective. 
> This Conference hopes to be an endeavour in unravelling some aspects of the patterns of interactions between Buddhism (including Buddhist institutions) and other social institutions in India from Sakyamuni Buddha to the present.  Papers are invited on the following themes: 
> 1.	Defining the ?self ?, defining the ?other?: Did Indian Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana) had any notion of self? Or did it consider itself just as a soteriology for the world-renouncing monks? If it had some definite notions of the ?self?, how did it negotiate ?other? or ?others??  And what did it do nurture and cultivate the ?self??  Did the Buddhist ?self? include the lay followers?  That brings us to assess the relationship between the Buddhist Sangha and the laity. 
> 2.	Buddhism was one of the earliest world religions, yet it has developed remarkable local colours across the vast landmass of Asia. This ?localization? process, what has been earlier referred to as ?translation in the local idiom?, has been well documented in the case of many Asian countries, but it has barely begun for India. Future researches on the functional dimensions of Indian monastic Buddhism may negotiate one core issue: how does the Sa?gha localize at a particular place by resolving what Richard Cohen calls ?uniquely local problems?, yet retain its supra-local character? To analyse the twists and turns of this supralocal?local dialectic, shifting the focus away from the ?rya- caturdi?a-bhik?u-sa?gha, (?Universal) Noble Sa?gha of the Four Quarters? to the individual monastery in its spatial context may not be a bad idea. This will naturally entail a greater use of archaeological data and archaeological fieldwork.
> This approach forces us to revisit many established notions regarding the social bases of patronage to Indian Buddhism and Buddhist institutions. How did the monastic tradition localise at a particular place? How did it try to negotiate the local socio-economic, political and cultic situations? Once a Buddhist monastery or a stupa established its presence at a particular site, how did it mobilise resources for its survival? Which section of society patronised Buddhism and Buddhist institutions? With what motives?  What did the Buddhist Sangha provide in return to its patrons? Are there spatial variations in the patterns of interactions between the Sangha and its patrons as one moves out of the middle and upper Ganga valley? How did Buddhist institutions survive without any kind of royal patronage in many cases? 
> 3.	Ancient Indian  Buddhism and social hierarchies (Varna/Jati/ gender)
> 4.	 Patterns of interaction between Ancient Indian Buddhism and Indian political orders and processes. 
> 5.	Ancient Indian Buddhism and economic processes: craft production, trade, urbanisation, agriculture. 
> 6.	Buddhism and medicine in ancient India: textual and archaeological perspectives. 
> 7.	 Socio-economic contexts of ancient Indian Buddhist art and architecture. 
> 8.	Archaeology   and the reconstruction of social and economic history of ancient Indian Buddhism.
> 9.	Role of pilgrimage in Indian Buddhism: textual, epigraphic and archaeological perspectives. 
> 10.	The social and economic philosophy of  ancient Indian Buddhism 
> 11.	Buddhism and Environment 
> 12.	Decline of Indian Buddhism: socio-economic factors. 
> 13.	 The social dimensions of Buddhist revival movements in colonial, post-colonial and contemporary India. 
> In this section, we are particularly interested in tracing the interface between the Dalit and backward castes identity movements and Buddhist revival movements. Why and how was Buddhism appropriated and reformulated by the Ambedkarite Dalits? What are the ideological and institutional aspects of Buddhist revival movements in post-Colonial and contemporary India? Do we see any variation in the patterns of Buddhist revival movements in different parts of India? 
> 14.	Any other theme related to the social dimensions of Indian Buddhism.
