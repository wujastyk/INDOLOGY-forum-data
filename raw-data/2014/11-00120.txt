About P.C. Bagchi (1898-1956), it should be added that a collection of his papers has been published this year in Kolkata.
See the complete reference with the Table of contents at:

A previous "P.C. Bagchi Centenary Volume" was issued in 2009 - Table of contents available at:

> Thanks, dear colleagues! Bagchi's translation is available here but not the original.
> 
> I just relate some old anecdotes. We owe it to the poet Tagore that Bagchi translated the work into English. L?vi made such an impression upon Tagore that the latter requested L?vi to train Bagchi in his own way. L?vi and Bagchi became legends at Santiniketan.

> I also thank Professor Houben who was instrumental in my becoming a member of Indology.

> Ok, I worked a bit on the files (reducing the size, adding OCR [a rather crude one], changing the page orientations). You will find Vol. 1 under URL: <https://archive.org/details/BagchiCanonBouddhiqueChineVol1>
> Vol. 2 under URL: <https://archive.org/details/BagchiCanonBouddhiqueChineVol2>
> 
> But the entry is currently processed by the Archive.org uploading system, so it may take some time to be ready. So look in some hours or the next day. When the files are ready I can add links from Vol 1 to Vol 2 and vice versa.
