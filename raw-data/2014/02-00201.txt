Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sindhu- names of Indian submarines

sindhu is used here in the sense of 'sea, ocean.' 

"dhaj" in the second name should probably be dhvaj/dhvaja, meaning 'flag, banner.'

The INS Sindhughosh, Sindhudhaj, the Sindhuraj, Sindhuvir and ill-fated Sindhuratna, all Russian-manufactured Kilo-class submarines, were all inducted between 1986 and 1988. The most recent of the Kilo-class fleet, the Sindhushastra, was puchased in 2000, preceded by the Sindhurakshak in 1997, and the Sindhuvijay was inducted in 1991.
