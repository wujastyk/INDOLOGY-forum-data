Dear Dominik,

thanks for the information.

That explains why, yesterday, as the OWNER of the mailing list called 
CTAMIL (hosted by one CNRS server), I received an automatic message for 
which the subject line was:

**********************************************
"WARNING: bounce rate too high in list ctamil"
**********************************************

The message said

**********************************************
Bounce rate in list ctamil is 48.2.

You should delete bouncing subscribers
**********************************************

I did not delete any subscriber
but I immediately started to reset
the error level of 48% of the list members :-(

Each one of them had ONE BOUNCE.

After that, I crossed my fingers, hoping not to have to do it again :-)

I am glad to know there was a REASON

Cheers

-- Jean-Luc
