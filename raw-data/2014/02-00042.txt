With greetings to all!

The dialogue reminds me of a linguistic phenomenon that I had tried to
guess, wrongly or rightly, from a wrong reading in the Kashmir ms of the
Paippal?da-Sa?hit? of the AV. In 12.19.2 the AVP reads *?raddhema? brahma
ju?at?m?*. The Kashmir ms reads *bhraddhema? ju?at???* This was the only
confusion between *?ra *and *bhra *that I had noted in the Kashmir ms. My
guess at that time was that the *bhra* had come via a *tra*. The source of
the *tra*, I had guessed, was a noted early tendency to replace an initial
s- by  t- in the South. The AVP had sometimes remained in the South.

Later I had to consider the similarity between *?ra *and *bhra* in
16thcentury ??rada. Still I do not think that that satisfactorily
solves the
problem.

Best
