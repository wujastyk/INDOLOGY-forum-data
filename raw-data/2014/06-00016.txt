Dear Jacob,

this would seem to include ancient vernaculars, cf. Allen,
Phonetics in Ancient India, p. 40:

   there was a tendency, censured by the R[k]P[r?ti??khya]
   but general in the modern Indo?Aryan languages, for
   vowels to take on some degree of nasal ?colour? in
   contact with nasal consonants.?

   ? RP xiv. 56 raktai r?ga? samav?ye svar???m. Cf. also
   xiv. 9.

All best,
Stefan
