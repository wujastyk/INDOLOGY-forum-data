Dear Emmanuel,

the Lifco edition of the NATP calls them ??????? [a?ivaravu]

See the Madras Tamil Lexicon:

"http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:1387.tamillex.524618"

<QUOTE>
??????? a?i-varavu, n. < id. +. Mnemonic of initial syllables of stanzas 
in a poem; ???????? ?????????????. Vai??.
</QUOTE>

You may also remember our discussion, last March, in Pondicherry,
during the NETamil workshop
concerning the passage
????????????????? ?????? ??????? ???????
????? ???????? ????????? ??????????????
[urup?vat?ratti?ku n?takac cul?kam? p?lavum
mutal ni?aippu u?arttiya ilakkiyattat?y]
which is found in the commentary
to the Y?pparu?kalak k?rikai (YK).

This was the occasion for a SEARCH FOR INFORMATION
concerning the R?p?vat?ra
on the CTamil mailing list,
a few years ago.

I could locate the pointers,
if necessary.

The editions of the YK do contain such lists
(I could provide explicit references if needed)

Best wishes

-- Jean-Luc (Paris)
