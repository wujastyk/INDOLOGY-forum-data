Subject: [INDOLOGY] Gemology in S. Asia?
In-Reply-To: <CAMGmO4+SPsV_ZOV9aN8UZh_40OqOJah7WdZnPsRCBq1w2aeqPA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CALoZ1nVBNd4RcYW1Lb=eUSOBJBz5DwFeoahF5jobRoFTtCFh6w@mail.gmail.com>

Not to forget Richard Garbe's "Die indischen Mineralien, ihre Namen und die
ihnen zugeschriebenen Kr?fte". Leipzig 1882.
Contains text and translation of chapter 13 of Narahari's R?janigha??u (c.
13th century, Kashmir).
A quick subject search on "gems" in the SARDS3 database resulted in over 30
hits of papers dealing with gems in India (though perhaps not on "gemology"
in its strict sense):

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
