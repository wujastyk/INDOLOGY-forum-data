I second this suggestion, especially since some scripts (e.g., Nandinagari) have an inverted /bha/ that is easily confused with /ta/.

Is it possible to read the name as narayanagarbha? A Google search will give you references for this scholar.

Dear Members,
I am preparing an edition of ?nandavardhana's Dev??ataka, with the commentary by Kayya?a (978 d.C.). The latter states in the pu?pik? that his teacher was some ek?yanasya acyutatulyam?rter ?c?ryan?r?ya?agartanamna?. Has anyone ever heard of him or has any hint about names ending in -garta?
Best wishes,
