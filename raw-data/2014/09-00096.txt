Dear James

Murugan is a synonym for Kataragama (Skanda).

You may find here all the literature you are looking for:

  Subject: [INDOLOGY] Query about Sinhala apocalypse myth


  Dear all,

  I would greatly appreciate any help finding some more information about an apocalypse myth mentioned in Richard Gombrich's Precept and Practice (Routledge, p.336). 

  Gombrich describes it as a murugasa?vars?va (wild beast deluge) and the basic premise is that the end of Buddhism is triggered by moral degeneracy that ultimately leads to a great flood. This in turn causes humanity to transform into wild beasts and everyone is killed. 

  I am interested in this murugasa?vars?va event: 1) Does anyone know if there are any primary sources (in Sinhala or otherwise) that detail the event? 2) Apart from Gombrich is there any other secondary literature on this specific subject that you would recommend?

  Thank you all in advance.

  Kind regards,

  James
