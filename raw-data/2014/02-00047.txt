Many thanks, Professor Slaje! I shall download it, but I have already read
it. It is a valuable contribution. But will you mind my remark that the
prehistory of the Kashmir manuscript could go well beyond the borders of
present Kashmir? I do not mean early pre-history but even so near a time as
the late first millennium CE. In fact, you must be better aware than me
that there had been some close cultural relation of Kashmir with the
current Himachal Pradesh -- a relation that extended as far as Kumaon at
least as far as script is concerned.
What you say of intra-Kashmir developments is a valuable factor in
determining the traits of the unique manuscript (sadly, the original
destroyed by the war) -- Witzel spoke of the surrounding environment in the
seventies. You are most welcome to continue as you have been. What draws my
additional attention  -is that the external factors too should get the
attention they deserve. .
All the best wishes.
