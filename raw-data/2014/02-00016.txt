Dear Martin and All,

I would gladly sign such a petition: I've also found SBL very difficult to work with directly, and I eventually gave up trying. But to clarify one point in Martin's original query: while you do need written permission from SBL (as with any other library) to procure copies of their digitized/microfilmed manuscripts, you do not need their permission to read and review them onsite at IGNCA in Delhi. This is of course helpful in determining which MSS copies - and at which librarie - are worth mounting a chase for. 

All best,
Travis

Perhaps obviously, I'd be all for such an initiative...
