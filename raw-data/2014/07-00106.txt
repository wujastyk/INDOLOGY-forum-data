Very sad news. Please accept my condolences.



Please announce H-Buddhism list too, as his readers for many decades
consisted perhaps mostly of Buddhist scholars, irrespective of country and
language. His oeuvre is another reason in South Asian studies, perhaps
worth mentioning it already, to learn German in order to benefit from his
manifold contributions and discoveries. I do hope his grand love for German
music, including playing, comforted him during his last years, as may
comfort his wife and many direct disciples. R.I.P.
