Dear Christopher,

"catalytic" meaning "pertaining to that which acts as a catalyst," which in turn is
1. a substance that causes or speeds a chemical reaction without itself being affected.
2. a person or thing that precipitates an event or change.

I.e., "catalytic" = "bringing about a transformation"

which is how I understand Prajnakaramati's causative interpretation.
But the Tibetan paraphrase seems fine as well.

all best,
Matthew
