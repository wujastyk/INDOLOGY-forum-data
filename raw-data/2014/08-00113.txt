Subject: [INDOLOGY] Atharvasirsopanisad !
Message-ID: <BAY179-W707E1B1D59B1A516A20189D9DF0@phx.gbl>



Dear All,Since I have not specialized in this subject I raise a question. If there is a Ganapatyatharvasirsopanisad mentioned in the mail of Mr. Harry Spier, I would request to tell me how many Atharvasirsopanisad are there? Is there any with Shiva? It would be nice if you give me a reply.RegardsDebabrata Chakrabarti
