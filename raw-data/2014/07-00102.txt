This is not a new phenomenon. Rao is not the first prominent Indian in
position of power to entertain such ideas.
It is for more than a decade or so that critical historians are on the
defensive. Elements of the Western Indology are partly responsible. Many
obscurantist elements were encouraged during the final decades of the cold
war in the name of research into the true Indian tradition.    The
enlightened tradition that saw its beginning in the 1860s in Bankim Chandra
Chattopadhyay, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, R.G. Bhandarkar and others
rapidly waned in the eighties when the cold war was in its peak. The
present correspondent too suffered and was even mocked at for his way of
enquiry by friends in the West who hardly saw the danger. Only an
insignificant percentage of the Western Indologists has cared to sift the
husk fron the grain. As you sow so shall you reap!
