Dear list members,

I am working on a paper and translating therefore parts of  the Sanskrit
text known as *K??ipar??ara, *in which practices of astral sciences are
applied to  agricultural activities. Verses 8b and 9 are a tribute to the
practice of honoring guests. As they are not related neither with  previous
nor with subsequent verses, and as they remind Brahmanical prescriptions
found in *dharma??stra* literature, I suspect they may have another source,
which however I struggle to locate. Any information offered would be very
much appreciated and, if used, would be properly attributed.


*k??irdhany? k??irmedhy? jant?n?? j?vana? k??i? *

*hi?s?dido?ayukto ?pi mucyate ?tithip?jan?t* ||8||



*ten?rcita? jagat sarvamatithiryena p?jita? |*

*arcit?stena dev??ca sa eva puru?ottama?* ||9||





P.S. Verse 2  may also sound *dharma**?**?stric*:



*caturved?ntago vipra? ??strav?d? vicak?a?a? |*

*alak?my?? g?hyate so?pi pr?rthan?l?ghav?nvita?* ||2||



Thank you very much in advance,

yours sincerely,

Alessandra.
