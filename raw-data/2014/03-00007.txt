There has been a fair amount of work on aspects of Buddhist hermeneutics
that treat of analogous issues, in both tantric and non-tantric contexts.
Don Lopez's edited vol. Buddhist Hermeneutics would be one place to
begin, but there has been further relevant work since that was
first published over twenty years ago. 

David S. Ruegg devoted considerable attention to the question and, more than
most, explicitly relates the Buddhist developments to issues in non-Buddhist theories of language.
