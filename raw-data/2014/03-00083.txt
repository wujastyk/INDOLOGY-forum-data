Subject: [INDOLOGY] Churning king Vena
Message-ID: <CAEgrCzBn12wuYUbRW51giBNgqOF4aqxYYOcFH_vCcCe0QQ1sQA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

Bhagavata Purana has the brahmans churning at first the dead king Vena's
thigh and then his arms - in order to create a new king.

BhP_04.14.043/1 vini?cityaivam ??ayo vipannasya mah?pate?
BhP_04.14.043/2 *mamanthur ?ru?* taras? tatr?s?d b?huko nara?

BhP_04.15.001/1 atha tasya punar viprair aputrasya mah?pate?
BhP_04.15.001/2 *b?hubhy?? mathyam?n?bhy??* mithuna? samapadyata

Would someone comment on the procedure involved and the meaning of that -
certainly - strange ritual?

Has someone worked on the king Vena's story? Any book? Paper?


Regards,

Artur Karp
