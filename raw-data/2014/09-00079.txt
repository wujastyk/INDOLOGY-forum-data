Subject: [INDOLOGY] text memorization
Message-ID: <CAKA8X43uz5VvmhdD495tTi6hiWU7p+E3p5acUa2ELAueBt=nSA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues

Might someone have handy some references on the practice of memorization in
the Sanskrit (and Tibetan) traditions?  I know memorizing texts is a basic
part of, for instance, traditional medical education, jyotishastra, etc.
What I am looking for are good published studies describing these practices
(pdf's would be a bonus).

Cheers,
