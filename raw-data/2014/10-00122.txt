Subject: [INDOLOGY] The place of Indology in the Academy

This has an interesting history in American education.  W. D. Whitney's
salary was paid through an endowment set up for Whitney by his predecessor,
E. E. Salisbury. (When Whitney nearly jumped ship to go to Harvard,
Salisbury significantly increased the endowment.)

Whitney's appointment was not originally to Yale College, but to their
nascent graduate school, The Department of Philosophy and the Arts. Based
on the German model, it was the first institution to grant the PhD in the
US.
