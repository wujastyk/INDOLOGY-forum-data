A nice article in the Mumbai

about
the BL project of reuniting - by digitization - the 17th century Jagat
Singh Mewar Ramayana. By Jeremiah Losty and Marina Chellini at the BL,
and Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sanghralaya (CSMVS).  See
also the BBC report <http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26670449>.

See the digitally-reunited Mewar Ramayana, "one of the world's most
beautiful *Ramayana* manuscripts," at the British Library's
