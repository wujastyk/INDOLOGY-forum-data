Thanks, dear colleagues! Bagchi's translation is available here but not the
original.

I just relate some old anecdotes. We owe it to the poet Tagore that Bagchi
translated the work into English. L?vi made such an impression upon Tagore
that the latter requested L?vi to train Bagchi in his own way. L?vi and
Bagchi became legends at Santiniketan.

I also thank Professor Houben who was instrumental in my becoming a member
of Indology.

Best wishes

DB
