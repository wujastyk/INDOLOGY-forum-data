Sudhir Kakar's work and also Manisha Roy's Bengali Women are certainly worth consulting (both, as am I, are perhaps a bit dated).

A unique genre of literature, called Pillaittamiz (pi??ai-t-tami? ?????????????) exists in Tamil. ?pi??ai? means ?child.? In fact, the ?child? here is a god/goddess. Later texts (in the 20-th century) also include political leaders in this group (as a ?child?). There are many old texts on this genre, celebrating 10 successive phases in the growth of a child. These texts are highly structured, differing only in three sections depending upon the gender of the child being celebrated.

For an introduction, you may refer to Paula Richman?s work ("Extraordinary Child: Poems from a South Indian Devotional Genre?).

For more details, feel free to contact me off-list and I?d be glad to share my knowledge.

Hi Viktoria,

On the childhood of gods there's of course a lot of scholarship on the myths of Krsna. One
work on this I'd recommend is Jack Hawley's Krishna the Butter Thief (Oxford University Press).

best for the new year,
Matthew
