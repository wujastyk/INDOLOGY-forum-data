*The OED:Forms:*  ME?16 *bragman*, 15 *bramane*, 16?18 *brachman(e*,
*brachmin*, 16 *brackman*, *braman*, *bramen*, *bramine*, *braminy*, 17?18
*bramin*, 17? *brahmin*, 18 *brahman*.

*Etymology:*  < Sanskrit *br?hmana*, < *brahman* praise, worship; some of
the older English forms were derived from or influenced by the Greek
spelling *?????????* (plural), Latin *brachm?ni*, *brachm?nes*, and
medieval Latin corruptions; the form *Brahmin*, a corruption of the Indian
vernacular pronunciation, is still all but universal in popular use; during
the 19th cent. Orientalists adopted the more correct *Brahman*, which
(often written *Br?hman* or *Br?hman*) is employed by most writers on India.
