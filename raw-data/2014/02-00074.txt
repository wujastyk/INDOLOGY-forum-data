In case it might be of interest, the story made the front page of today's Hindustan Times.

Here is a link to the copy of the original legal notice sent by Dina Nath Batra to Wendy Doniger:

Sad and worried to see the trend of publishers withdrawing scholarly works in the in the face of opposition from a few fringe groups. But as Wendy suggests, in the age of the Internet, it is no longer possible to suppress a book.

Regards,
Suresh.
