Subject: [INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Message-ID: <CAM3HWN-NbJ9U--QGOm1X13ncicWyCo=947tHtBCvaK6+QzLVJw@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear respected colleagues,

I wonder if anyone here knows about alchemy (ras?yana) and can clarify the
meaning of the word *j?r?a *in that context. In the passage below (?Pvv III
p. 328), in discussing mystical experience, Abhinavagupta uses an
alchemical metaphor involving *siddharasa *(? mercury)*, drutarasa, *and
*kanakadh?tu*. The meaning of the passage is fairly clear to me, I am just
wondering about the alchemical significance of of *j?r?a *(matured?) and
*drutarasa*.

the passage follows.

*yad? tu par?m???a-nityatva-vy?pitv?di-dharmakai?varya-ghan?tman?
ahambh?va-siddharasena ??ny?di-deha-dh?tv-anta? vidhyate yena prameyatv?t
tat cyavata iva, tad? turyada??*;
*yad?pi viddho 'sau pr??a-deh?di-dh?tu? sa?vid-rasena abhinivi??o ?tyanta?
kanaka-dh?tur iva j?r?a? kriyate yena sa druta-rasa iva ?bh?ti kevala?
tat-sa?sk?ra?, tad?pi tury?t?ta-da?? s? bhavati*
'But when the [layers of limited selfhood] from Void to the physical body
are penetrated by the ?alchemical elixir? that is the (true)
I-sense?replete with the sovereignty of the qualities of eternality,
all-pervasiveness, etc. which are cognized [as aspects of that I], by which
their objectivity falls away as it were, then it is the Fourth State.
When, further, these elements of *pr?**?a*, body, etc., penetrated by the
elixir of Consciousness, are completely immersed [in it], they are
?matured? like the element of gold . . .'(?)
