As far as "Yogav?si??ha" VI.126.4 (= "Laghuyogav?si??ha"
VI.15.14) is concerned, the following publication is of essential
importance:

J?rgen Hanneder: "Dreams and other States of Consciousness in the
Mok?op?ya". In: Claudine Bautze-Picron (Ed.): The Indian Night. Sleep
and Dream in Indian Culture?. Delhi 2009, pp. 65?99.

Best,
Roland Steiner
