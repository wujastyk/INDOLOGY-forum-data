My experience with the Sarasvati Bhavan Library is similar to that of
Michael.  In mid-80s, I had located a manuscript at the SBL, and paid for
making a microfilm/copy, but there was no response.  Finally, if I remember
correctly, my Guruji, Professor Cardona, happened to be in Banaras, and it
was his personal intervention that got me the ms copies that I needed.
