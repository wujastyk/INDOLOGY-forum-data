Dear Patrick,

Another possible Sanskrit verse ? from a Kashmir source

?from Bodhas?ra by Narahari (in a section on the 7 steps of knowledge in
R?ja Yoga)

ath? ca v?si??he  |
cal?r?avayugacchidrak?rmagr?v?prave?avat  |
anekajanman?mante vivek? j?yate pum?n  ||17||

Also in the work called Yogav?si??ha,

17.    Just like the head of a struggling turtle
         finally surfaces into a calm
         in the midst of  innumerable turbulent waves,
         so a person finally becomes discerning after many births.

(Cover, Jennifer and Grahame (2014). Bodhasara The surprise of awareness,
Createspace, USA, p174-175)
(Narahari (1905). Bodhas?ra (with a commentary by Div?kara), Benares
Sanskrit series. Benares: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Book Depot, p223)

F/N (Cover p175-176)
Yogav?si??ha (Nirv??aprakara?am Book 6.1 Section 126, verse 4)
(Yogav?si??ha of V?lm?ki 1984:1050) and Laghu Yogav?si??ha
(Laghu-Yogav?si??ha 6.15.14). The sense here is that it is extremely
difficult to become discerning. There are seven steps of knowledge, but
even to begin on the first step takes effort, and possibly many births. The
difficulty of a struggling turtle finally surfacing into a calm in the
midst of  innumerable turbulent waves, is a clear metaphor for the level of
difficulty. Mark Allon has found a short s?tra, for which this same
powerful image is central, in the third of six texts written on scroll 22
([recto]II. 31-56) of the G?ndh?r? texts preserved in the Senior collection
of Kharo??h? Buddhist manuscripts (Allon 2006).([recto]II. 31-56) of the
G?ndh?r? texts preserved in the Senior collection of Kharo??h? Buddhist
manuscripts (Allon 2006).
