In the hope that it might be of use to some scholars here, I wanted to let
you know that I have just uploaded a Unicode version of Ksemendra's
Darpadalana (based on the Kavya Mala version of the text) at archive.org:
https://archive.org/details/DarpadalanaKavyaMala

Please let me know if you notice any typos.
