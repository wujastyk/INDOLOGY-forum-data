May I suggest, McComas, that you have a look at CreativeCommons.org, and
choose an appropriate license from there that suits what you want?  It's
the best way to be totally clear about how stuff gets - or doesn't get -
shared.

The CreativeCommons licenses are also based on solid legal grounds, so
there's no ambiguity.  For example, your statement that your book is in the
Public Domain is probably not what you really mean, and may not even be
true, even though you said it.

I strongly recommend that you adopt a Creative Commons license.  Did I say
that already?  :-)

Best,
Dominik
