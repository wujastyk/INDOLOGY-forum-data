Subject: [INDOLOGY] RV translation
Message-ID: <CAP1Y1zu4kEwXKBec-xY4kOkEAni7BJ_vYvzOzRufWTQ_9br0uQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,
I just realized that my recent emails intended for the list have been going
only to the individuals to whom I have been responding.  I want to let you
all know that there is also an edition of the recent RV translation by
Jamison-Brereton that will be published in one volume at a more affordable
price: US $ 65.

According to US Books in Print this edition will be released next month.

There will be a less expensive alternative to the $ 400 set next month.

Best wishes,
George
