PS. Apart from these three levels of the digital
representation of text, a desirable way to keep close to
your sources (or rather to keep your sources at your
fingertips) is of course to produce facsimile images and to
link them to their textual interpretation (whether encoded
as Brahmi and displayed with a suitable font, or as Latin or
Devanagari etc. transliteration).
