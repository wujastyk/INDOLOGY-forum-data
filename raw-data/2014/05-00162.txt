Subject: [INDOLOGY] FYI: Ho Family Foundation Program in Buddhist Studies: new round of grants
Message-ID: <538376AF.4090005@asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de>

Dear colleagues,

FYI: the Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation initiated a program - 
channeled through ACLS - in Buddhist Studies last year, supporting 
dissertation fellowships, postdoctoral fellowships, collaborative 
research grants and distinguished visiting professorships.

The list of the first 23 grant recipients can be found at 
http://www.rhfamilyfoundation.org/#!/press/74. The second round of 
grants was just announced: 
http://www.acls.org/programs/buddhist-studies/; the deadline for 
applications is 8 October 2014.

Note that these are global competitions. There are no restrictions as to 
the location of work proposed or the citizenship of applicants.

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
