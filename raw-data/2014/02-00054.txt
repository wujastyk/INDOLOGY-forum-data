Subject: [INDOLOGY] Wendy Doniger's book to be withdrawn in India by Penguin	India
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeyvU-yooLK+NcHbD8VqZqcWyYK_bMcPKWrVo9yx6Gijg@mail.gmail.com>

?Dear colleagues,

?
?I am appalled to learn of yet another book-banning episode in India, this
time
?affecting our colleague Wendy Doniger.?


?Yesterday, if I understand correctly, Penguin India agreed to withdraw the
book rather than fight the law case:

?If you read the five objections offered against the
book<http://scroll.in/article/five-piece-of-evidence-offered-by-fundamentalist-group-against-donigers-hinduism-book?id=656130>,
they are risible.  It beggars belief that any court, much less a publisher,
would take objections of this type seriously.

As a Penguin Delhi author myself, I shall be writing to Penguin India to
protest this dark-ages ruling.  ?
