Dear all,

if you take Google's ngram research tool (that takes the materials at Google Books as basis) and look for "indianisme", "indologie", "?tudes indiennes" with search options "Language=French", "Date Range=1800-2000" you get the following graph:

URL: <http://goo.gl/8bAhmd>

So, in the majority of sources the red line with "indianisme" prevails. Of course, Google's text recognition isn't perfect, and it may occur that the language is wrongly assigned. But it shows a trend, nevertheless. You may click at the date ranges at the bottom to view the links in Google Books where the search terms can be located.

All the best

Peter Wyzlic
