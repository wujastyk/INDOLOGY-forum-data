Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on Sanskrit Syntax
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzeBgNRcJ8Whrffc7OuqyW146_9ib=zK3Jjzwt0v+Q9uGA@mail.gmail.com>

n a Sanskrit work titled Nity?c?radarpa?a by Brahm?nanda, on p. 2, I see a
quotation from Dak?asm?ti:

??????????? ???????????????? ?????: ?
???????????????? ??????????????????????? ????? ??

Here, ?c?r?t pr?pyate svargam is an irregular usage, unless one assumes
that the word svarga is somehow used in neuter gender.  With the normal
masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case
form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.  In Marathi, such
passive constructions are possible: ?????? (instrumental) ???????
(accusative) ?????? (passive verb).  This usage alternates with a more
Sanskrit like passive: ?????? ???? (nom) ??????/????? (nom).  I am
wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bh?ve) constructions
where the object shows up in the accusative case.  Any information or
suggestions are appreciated.
