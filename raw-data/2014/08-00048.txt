I can't speak to the exact problem with Hindi, etc. (I don't use them, though both of your problems sounds suspiciously similar to problems I've had before with keyboard layouts and also Apple/Microsoft more generally), and I've usually been able to find (often inelegant) workarounds from various places.  The always obvious solution is to give up on Microsoft (but I'm too stubborn).

Barring that or a fix from either corporation, I would try (a) use a hot key to toggle layouts quickly, (b) toggle on/off the 'use document input source,' (c) change keyboard input at login, or (d) modify the hidden default file (I've never done this one since I didn't know it was possible, but it showed up in the link below; if I understand it properly, this could solve your US Extended problem, Tim).

When you find a solution, do let me know as I'm sure I'll encounter the problem soon enough.

My best,

BTW: I always keep (b) off as it has caused me problems before.

Similar problem here, as of yesterday.  Whenever I open a Word doc the keylayout switches to Devanagari. If I remove Dev from the list, it switches to US Extended, which cannot be removed. I normally use a customized version of EasyUnicode. The problem seems limited to Word.

Dear List,

I am having trouble with the factory Hindi and Gujarati fonts on my Macbook Pro. In the middle of typing they just reverted to the Latin font. The Urdu font and phonetic fonts I also work with are fine.

I made sure that caps lock was not on.

I think it may be due the latest update?

I went through keyboard preferences and uninstalled/unclicked both languages but that has not worked.

Has anyone experienced this problem before or currently?


All the best,
