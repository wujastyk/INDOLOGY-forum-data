Subject: [INDOLOGY] A query on Sunya Purana
Message-ID: <1415436705.50913.YahooMailBasic@web121906.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Respected Colleagues ,
I am trying to find out a copy of Sunya Purnana .It was originally written in 10th-11th century Bengal. Later it witnessed a substantial interpolation in the   14th -15th century . If any of you has a scanned or PDF copy of both versions , kindly forward them to me.
