Dear Kenneth Zysk,
In the Datt?treyayoga??stra, there is a verse in which ahi?s? is regarded as a niyama. The Datt?treyayoga??stra was probably written three or four centuries before the Ha?haprad?pik?.
laghv?h?ras tu te?v eko mukhyo bhavati n?pare |ahi?s? niyame?v eko mukhyo bhavati n?pare||33||
In fact, Sv?tm?r?ma borrows other verses from the Datt?treyayoga??stra, so HP 1.38ab may have been inspired by DY? 33.
You are right to say that HP 1.16-17 were appended. In Kaivalyadhama's critical edition, only one of the eleven manuscripts in the apparatus has these verses on yama and niyama. However, they do appear in the four printed editions consulted by the editors. Also, I recall that the version of the text commented on by Brahm?nanda includes the verses on yama/niyama and, presumably, nearly all modern editions have followed this.
Best wishes,
Jason
