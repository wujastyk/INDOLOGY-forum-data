Subject: ABORI on JSTOR !!!

Dear All,

This is to inform you with great pleasure that the first 87 volumes of the
Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (ABORI) have become
available on the JSTOR.

Indeed  a major source of studies !!

--Shreenand


?While what JSTOR and BORI have done is excellent, it is not enough.  There
are two drawbacks in what they've done:

   1. Some volumes are missing.
   2. The method of access is clumsy and restricted.  Unlike most articles
   in JSTORE, ABORI articles can't be freely downloaded and read comfortably
   on one's own tailored screen, or printed out.  They can only be read on the
   web, and one can only read a very limited number of articles within a
   period of three weeks.  Three, articles I think, if memory serves.

It's all very clumsy and restrictive, and makes rapid, wide access to ABORI
articles difficult or impossible.  ABORI often printed rejoinders or
follow-up articles.  So in following a single topic, it's not uncommon to
want to read several articles together.  This isn't possible if there are
more than three (without waiting three weeks).

So, a big cheer for what they've done, but also a request that they remove
the existing strait-jacket and make ABORI articles available under the
normal JSTOR terms.
