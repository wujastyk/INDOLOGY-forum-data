Subject: [INDOLOGY] Hindi courses at universities in India?
Message-ID: <1413513521886.93078@anu.edu.au>

Dear Colleagues


This is tangential to normal Indology business, but can anyone recommend a university in India were we can send our intermediate Hindi language students for Hindi language courses?  Our government regulations stipulate that it must be a university. Our university is looking for an exchange, rather then paying fees upfront.


Thanks in advance


McComas
