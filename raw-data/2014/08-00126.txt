Dear Colleagues,

Would anyone be able to supply me with a scan of all three volumes of the
PTS edition of: *Suma?galaVil?sin?: Buddhaghosa's commentary on the D?gha
Nik?ya*?

I've been able to find a PDF of vol 1 but it is of very poor quality. If
anyone just has scans of individual volumes I'd be keen on those as well.

My thanks in advance!

Best wishes,
Charlie
