Dear Professor Salomon,Richard Salomon: rsalomon at u.washington.eduThank you very much for your letter. I read also the following review on appreciative terms:Joachim Friedrich Sprockhoff, (Witten a. d. Ruhr), Anmerkungen zu kleinen Schriften von Moriz Winternitz, WZKS 39 (1995), (pp. 5-14),  P. 13 I am giving you the remarks of Syed Muztaba Ali, a prolific writer of Bengal - who studied at Santiniketan when Winternitz taught there. Ali wrote later in 1961:?Winternitz, as I came to know him accorded perfectly with the author I encountered in his writings, and they drew everybody?s attention. In his History of Indian Literature he gives us the quintessence of all the best books of the Vedas, the Upanishads, the R?m?ya?a and the Mah?bh?rata, the six schools of philosophy, and provides the kernel of the philosophy of ?ankara, R?m?nuja, adding his own commentary. The skill he has shown at the time of presenting the quintessence is completely unparalleled and unequalled. It is my strong conviction that the sage Vy?sa, if he happens to appear in person, would be unable to detect any important missing factor in those summaries.? Could you send me your review of Kleine Schriften? RegardsDebabrata Chakrabartidchakra at hotmail.de
