I am pleased to announce the addition of the Su?rutasa?hit? to the SARIT
library.

   - http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.8

With thanks to the hard work of Tsutomu Yamashita and Yasutaka Muroya.

Furthermore, another major text has been added to the SARIT GIT repository,
and will be uploaded to the SARIT library in the near future.  Watch this
space.

Best,

Dominik Wujastyk
