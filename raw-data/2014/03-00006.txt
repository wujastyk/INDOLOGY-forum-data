Dear Edwin,

In the Gau??ya Vai??ava tradition there is an allowance to move from the
primary meaning to a secondary (non-literal) meaning when the primary makes
no sense; in this regard they follow K?vya, especially well known texts
like Mamma?abha??a's K?vyaprak??a. For discussion, see J?va Gosv?min's
auto-commentary on his Tattvasandarbha called the Sarvasa?v?din? (p.25 ff.
of Hari D?sa ??str?'s edition). Vi?van?tha Cakravartin goes so far as to
say that the Bh?gavata Pur??a was composed according to three types of
meaning (e.g. v?cya, lak?ya and vya?gya, the latter two being
"non-literal") in his S?r?rthadar?in? 1.1.1 (p.53 of K???a ?a?kara ??str?'s
edition).

I've got an article called, "When Stones Float and Mud Speaks," which
examines J?va's views on ?r?ti passages that should be understood
non-literally; it will be out in the J of Hindu Studies in a few months.

Re Vallabha: He only alludes to the three types of language, bh???, in the
4th ma?gala of his Bh?gavata Pur??a commentary (p.65 of K???a ?a?kara
??str?'s edition), promising to show how they appear throughout the text. A
more full examination is in his Tattv?thad?panibandha, especially verses
11-12.

Sincerely,
