In this regard, Akananuru 255, probably from the first to the third century CE, is worth looking at (my translation below).  George

255. P?lai

The heroine, who has changed (grown thin and pale) in separation, overwhelmed by despair, speaks to the friend.



Fearfully, his ship sways as it cleaves the water

and it seems the earth has turned upside down

on the great expanse of the ocean with its waves that smell of fish.

It is tossed by swift winds that never cease day or night,

and the helmsman steers, guided by the bright lamps	5

on the tops of mansions by broad bays with high shores heaped with sand.

My man has left me to find wealth, friend.

Could he come without delaying many days

and make the pain that kills me go away?

In our rich town where water dashes against the cool fields, 	10

the north wind blows incessantly, touching the innermost petals

of the rich flowers of cool paka??ai bushes,

their blossoms white against the dark karuvi?ai plants,

and making the green fruits of p?kal with skin like jackfruit

sway among all the k?ta?am vines with their fading leaves.	15

If only we could find someone kind enough to go

and tell him how the wind blows all night in our guarded, many-storied house,

and how my perfect ornaments grow loose, and how my beauty withers,

and the rows of bangles on my arms slide down.

Maturai Maruta?ilan?ka??r



8. ?Could he come? translates ma???l, a word that indicates her wish will probably not come to pass.

10. The land described is paddy land, whose fields have raised borders to keep water in them when the paddy grows.  Here, it would seem the water from outside the fields dashes on the raised borders.

13. ?White blossoms? and ?dark? are added for clarity.

15. ?Fading? is mutu, ?old.?

19. ?Slide down? translates ?rum, ?be unloosed.?

Whether people would take it for granted or would discard it as a story full of myths ? what we read in this text cannot be ignored. If the stories in the Mahabharata and Ramayana are to be believed ? the stories found in the Tamil epic Manimekalai ought to be believed as well, I think.

>>> May I ask you one question about the prohibition of sea travel in ancient and medieval India. As I know, it was only in Baudhayana and some minor dharmasastras. In Manu the navigator was not to be invited for sraddha, and that is all. As I understand, this was no obstacle for Hindus to navigate from Aden to China. The prohibition, if any, concerned Brahmans only. Am I right? If so, whence the overwhelming ostracizing of the sea travelers in the nineteenth century? While Banyas in the sixteenth century actively traded everywhere the future Mahatma was expelled from his caste for going to England!
>>> 
>>> Is there any history of the Kala pani concept (in the sense of not the Andaman jail but the mysterious ?sea border? that was prohibited to cross?) What was it ? a folkloric notion? How did it gain such popularity, and even with the educated elites in colonial times? Or maybe it was an Orientalist invention disseminated by colonial education?
