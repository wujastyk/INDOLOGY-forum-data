Subject: [INDOLOGY] Available Works on Bhaskara's Brahmasutrabhashya
Message-ID: <CAHuz+CqXNByBzi+fXeunVn1P4McstqiOE8s80q0QaLjB_e2Jcg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Namaskar!

I'd be greatful if any body could point out me the available works on
Bhaskara's Brahmasutrabhashya (I do have the original bhashya but need to
know the availability of other works made on this bhashya either in Hindi,
English or in any other Indian languages).

Sincerely,

Niranjan Saha
