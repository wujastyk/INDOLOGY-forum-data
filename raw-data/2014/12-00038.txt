UC Berkeley Shinjo Ito Postdoctoral Fellowship in Buddhist Studies, 2015-2016

With the generous support of the Shinnyo?en Foundation, the Program in Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley is pleased to invite applications for a one-year postdoctoral research-teaching fellowship. The term of the appointment is July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, with the possibility of a one-year renewal.
The Fellowship is intended to foster the academic careers of recent Ph.D.'s, providing time to pursue their research along with the opportunity to gain teaching experience. Fellows are expected to teach two courses per year under the auspices of the Group in Buddhist Studies. (At least one course will be at the undergraduate level.) In addition, Fellows will give a public lecture on their research as part of the Center for Buddhist Studies Colloquium Series, and they are expected to take part in regular Center for Buddhist Studies events and workshops. We particularly welcome applicants whose research and teaching interests complement areas covered by Berkeley's Buddhist Studies faculty. Fellows will be provided with office space, library privileges and a salary of approximately $50,000 that comes with benefits.

Applicants must have their doctoral degrees in hand by June 30, 2015, and must be no more than six years out of their doctorate. Candidates who do not yet hold a Ph.D. but expect to by June 30, 2015, should supply a letter from their home institution confirming their schedule to completion.

Applicants whose teaching and research interests are primarily in the area of Japanese Buddhism should apply to the Shinjo Ito Postdoctoral Fellowship in Japanese Buddhism <http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cjs/postdocs.html>, administered through the Center for Japanese Studies <http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cjs/> at UC Berkeley, rather than to the Shinjo Ito Fellowship in Buddhist Studies.

Applicants whose teaching and research interests are primarily in the area of Chinese Buddhism should apply to the Sheng Yen Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chinese Buddhism <http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/shengyen/>, also administered through the Center for Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley, rather than to the Shinjo Ito Fellowship in Buddhist Studies.

Applicants should submit the following materials:

Curriculum vitae

Graduate school transcripts

A personal statement of no more than 2000 words outlining previous research (including dissertation), the research the applicant will undertake during the term of the fellowship, future professional goals, as well as any other information deemed relevant to the application

A writing sample

A two- to four-page statement of teaching interests, along with two brief course proposals (with optional syllabi) of courses they propose to teach for the Group in Buddhist Studies (Note: UC Berkeley courses normally meet a total of three or four hours per week throughout a fourteen-week semester)

Three letters of recommendation

Application Deadline and Notification of Award

All application materials, including letters of recommendation, must be postmarked on or before Friday, January 30, 2015. Faxed or emailed applications will not be accepted. Only complete applications will be considered. It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that all documentation is complete and that referees submit their letters of recommendation by the closing date. Awards will be announced in March, 2015.

Send all materials to:

Group in Buddhist Studies
University of California, Berkeley
