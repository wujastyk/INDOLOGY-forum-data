Subject: [INDOLOGY] what is the best place in India for epistemological	studies
Message-ID: <196881393673894@web28g.yandex.ru>

Dear colleagues,
I have an opportunity to go to India to finalize my research project on the problem of nirvikalpaka-savikalpaka pratyaksha in Indian philosophy. In fact, I already translated a number of Buddhist and Brahmanical texts for an anthology of Sanskrit texts on perception in Russian.
Now  I have to make a proposition for Indian Embassy and to indicate the centre or institution where I want to stay and work and the names of Indian specialists with whom I want to corroborate on this subject. For many years I worked with late professor Sri Narayana Mishra in Varanasi, now I would like to find a place with good library and research facilities as well as with experts  who could help me in my reseach. I read a book of Professor Rita Gupta on perception and would like to make her a key person of my fellowship but I could not find any references to her actual situation. I hope that she lives in India. 
Could anyone send me her e-mail?
Any other suggestions concerning the place and the person or persons which I may refer to are welcome!
I also will be grateful if you could suggest me Indian experts in cognitive sciences and philosophy of mind who live in India. I have head about National Institite for Advanced Studies in Bangalore, but on their site I could not find any information about these kind of studies...
Thank you in advance
Victoria
