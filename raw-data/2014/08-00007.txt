Subject: [INDOLOGY] Font with Brahmi characters
In-Reply-To: <CAKdt-Cf9J6-Z6Wq09XPijEtWmApr0QbVPnbbYF2MHCCHb4h8BA@mail.gmail.com>

Andrew Glass reminds me that Stefan Baums (also an INDOLOGY committee
member) was the primary author on the Brahmi proposal which led to the
inclusion of Brahmi in Unicode. I produced the original font which Michael
supplemented.

Thanks for the update, Andrew.
