These files are tremendously valuable, and the PTS, Rupert Gethin, the 
Dhammakaya Foundation and Reinhold Gruenendahl deserve our heartfelt 
thanks. This is truly a great initiative.

Are there any plans to make them available in TEI-XML? That would 
increase their utility tremendously.

Or, to ask the question differently: Is there any particular reason why 
TEI-XML was not chosen from the start?

It has its disadvantages, like every markup language and encoding 
schema, but it is so widely used now, and much more flexible than HTML.

Thanks again,

best regards,

Birgit Kelner
