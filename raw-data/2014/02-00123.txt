Dear Ms. Cover,

I recall seeing similar verses that play on phonetically close words yielding opposite meaning,
in this case the contrast between egotism and equanimity. I am not sure that it
is to be classed as a "grammatical pun," however, but perhaps as a type of anupraasa,
'assonance, alliteration,' such as var.nasaamya, 'phonetic similarity.' But it's really out of my
area and I will be pleased to be enlightened by some of the list's aala.mkaarikas.

good luck,
