Dear All,

I am facing a problem using Unicode Devan?gar? font in desktop publishing software QuarkXpress.

I have a text typed in Devan?gar? Unicode using the font "Devnagri MT". When I copy this text (or import the file) to a new file in QuarkXpress (I tired versions 8, 9 and 10) it breaks all the sandhis and shows separated alphabets with vir?ma/halanta.

Then, I also tried typing in a new file of QuarkXpress (I tired versions 8, 9 and 10) using Devan?gar? Unicode (Devn?gar? MT), but it gives me the same problem. 

Does Devan?gar? Unicode work in QuarkXpress ? Would someone be able to help ? I would really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

Yours,

Mrinal Kaul
