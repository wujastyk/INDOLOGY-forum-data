Dear List,


In connection with my work on A?oka?s Edicts I ordered several years ago a
professional scan of Eugen Hultzsch?s monumental ?Inscriptions of A?oka?
[1925].  Thanks to Dominik Wujastyk the ?Inscriptions? are now made
available to Indological and Buddhological community - the scan has been
placed by him on archive.org:


https://archive.org/details/InscriptionsOfAsoka.NewEditionByE.Hultzsch


and is also linked to the OpenLibrary:


https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6683747M/Inscriptions_of_Asoka


The *.pdf of the ?Inscriptions? is fully searchable.


My thanks to Dr. Wujastyk, once again, and


with Best Wishes,


Artur Karp
