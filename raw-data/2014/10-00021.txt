Subject: [INDOLOGY] text memorization
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eZEJYp5sMN6jujh+N2djDVXN+Q5V1FK1CJnF5g3vATUuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Prof. James Hartzell,

I recently stumbled upon this website

https://avagraha.wordpress.com/

with a tagline of

"Memorizing texts in a digitized world"

with pages such as

http://avagraha.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/memorizing-long-rules/

remembered your post.

Wanted to share.

Regards,

Nagaraj











Dear colleagues

Might someone have handy some references on the practice of memorization in
the Sanskrit (and Tibetan) traditions?  I know memorizing texts is a basic
part of, for instance, traditional medical education, jyotishastra, etc.
What I am looking for are good published studies describing these practices
(pdf's would be a bonus).

Cheers,
