Pulping Intellectual Freedom: Academics will not bow down to vigilantism


 

It is an abject shame that Penguin will pulp Prof. Wendy Doniger?s The
Hindus: An Alternative History. That this decision was reached in a deal
with the petitioners, with no consultation with the author compounds the
folly.  Coming in the wake of Oxford University Press? similar meek
surrender by suspending publication of Paula Richman?s Many Ramayanas ?
though forced to revert its decision in the aftermath of a spirited protest
by senior academics from across the world ? and the Delhi University?s
purging of A.K. Ramanujam?s essay, ?Three Hundred Ramayanas?, this episode
shows that mighty publishing houses and premier universities will crumble
under the slightest attack on academic freedom.  


 

Wendy Doniger writes on subjects long considered taboo by mainstream
Indologists: animals, sex, violence ? but her style of writing, full of wit
and humor and storytelling, was beloved of many outside of academia. This
has also turned her into an object of scorn and hatred among Hindutva
groups, especially among the diaspora. The low level of attacks ? from the
egg thrown at her in London to distasteful speculation of her personal
sexuality by a US-based Indian businessman, patron and poseur of Right wing
Hindu Studies ? has only exposed the shallowness of her critics. 


 

In 2003, Paul Courtright?s Ganesha: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings
was similarly attacked for its psychoanalytic approach. A petition by Hindu
Students Council in the US demanded from the author an ?unequivocal apology
to the Hindus?, leading the publisher Motilal Banarsidas to swiftly withdraw
the book with the promise that such a ?lapse? would never occur again. The
petition also insisted that Coutright re-write the passages which the
petitioners found offensive and issue a revised version with clarifications.



 

This demand that academic study of religion be directed by, and tailored for
a community of believers, with an unlimited potential for ?hurt? is simply
preposterous and thoroughly unacceptable.  Many of us ? Historians,
sociologists, Indologists ? are engaged in scholarship on religion. Some of
us are believers, some are not. Some of us study our own communities, many
train their lenses on others. 


 

We believe that all scholarship is open to criticism ? especially by those
who claim to speak on behalf of the community, as insiders. Indeed, it would
add to the richness of debate. However, threats, personal attacks, calls for
censorship and recourse to perennially offended sentiments cannot be
permitted to hold academic enquiry to ransom. 


 

As academics, we will robustly defend our right to work on themes of our
choice with theoretical frameworks of our choosing.
