Dear Colleagues,

I hesitate to comment after so many learned postings informing of the
various studies on visualizing the Buddha. These are welcome. Still, one
more point, it seems, is difficult to avoid.

It is more or less admitted by all that in the earliest concept there was
no other Buddha than the historical one.  It must have been so even in the
third century BCE. A rational concept of the Buddha could not engender the
idea of visualization. Our stark Cartesianism prevents comprehending even
the two concepts of the Christ. In ?Christ protects us all? the protector
is not the historical person rationalists are used to think of. A
visualization could not be conceived without an intervening concept of the
transcendental Buddha. Does not the rise of a docetic concept culminating
in the k?ya concept gain importance in this context?

Best

DB
