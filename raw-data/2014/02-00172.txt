The closest picture I could get to show how the i??i tree can be rooted in stone is at http://ookaboo.com/o/pictures/noindex/picture.original/12325800/Name_corrected_as_Ficus_mollis_in_Bhongi .  This tree is called kal icci. Now if this tree grows it will probably look like this http://www.biotik.org/india/species/f/ficutalb/ficutalb_02_en.html. This tree is called kal itti. We do not know which tree the Classical Tamil poems refer to. I am sure they are closely related species, if not the same in the days of Kapilar. In any case one can see how securely they can be rooted on the side of a mountain/rock face and also how they would resemble a waterfall. 


As for the suggested meaning, the semantics of 'ivar' is interesting. Compare the usages of  ivar in kal ivar mullai (ku?i?cipp???u 77) 'jasmine creeper attaching and spreading on rock', kal ivar i??i 'i??i attaching and spreading on rock' (Ai?ku?un??u 279.1) , and ka?i ivar cilampi? 'of the rock pepper creeper attaches and spreads on'(Akan????u 112.14), on the one hand and ?iva being called M?tu Ivar P?ka? ' man with a part a woman attaches to' (Tiruv?cakam 43.1). In all these cases, the verb ivar attaches some thing to a supportive thing. (See Comacuntara??r says, "kalli?m?? pa??ip pa?artali? kal ivar i??iv?r e????".) The jasmine creeper, i??i tree, pepper creeper, and woman belong to the one group and the rock and man belong to the other/supportive group.  In Ku?untokai 106, the hero is the rock and the heroine is the i??i tree. As for the roots of the i??itree resembling a waterfall, the heroine outwardly looks like an innocent girl but she has already united with the heroine. Outsiders do not know that. What appears to be one thing is something else in this case too. Like the rock does not change its position, the hero does not waver in his commitment to her even though he may be separated from her for now. That is the message brought by the messenger. 


So Wilden's analysis meets all the requirements of having to explain the suggestion in the poem.  This also means the ti?ai is Ku?i?ci and there is no need for anger on the part of the heroine, thus matching I?amp?ra?ar's view. 


The assumption of a deceitful hero by Comacuntara??r ultimately results from his interpreting ney pey t? as a brahminic wedding. He says, "kara?akk?lai ney peyt? tu??i e?untamai ka???? ?tali?". 


As for Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2, this is an utterance by the heroine's mother. The mother's complaint is about the hero having changed the heroine so that she no longer listens to her mother as she used to. In the Classical Tamil tradition, I do not know of any poem in which the mother talks in Marutam or about the son-in-law's other woman.  The respectful reference to p???? cannot be explained something from the bhakti sphere. The poem has to be explained from the akam perspective and bhakti perspective independently. One cannot bring in the role of ?c?ryas in the bhakti sphere to explain the form p??a??r in the akam sphere. The explanation of p??a??r cannot be done on the basis of Marutam.  But Ku?i?ci will pose no problem.

(My last post on this subject).  I don't agree.  The aerial roots of the fig do not root in stone, as far as I can tell.  The word for ?stone? is kal, which can also mean ?mountain,? ?hill.?  Most likely the poet means that the aerial roots of the fig (which are brown) reach down on a hill and find stone.  Unable to root, they dry out, turn a lighter shade and spread.  The image at the beginning of the poem is an u??u?ai, and in such cases the comparison is not to one quality (e.g. moonlike face) but to an action or fact (roots like waterfalls).  The point here, clearly I believe, is that what appears to be one thing is something else ? the messenger insists that the hero is good but he actually is not just as it looks as if there are waterfalls in the hero?s land (an image of prosperity and fertility) but what appear to be waterfalls are only the whitening roots of a parasitic plant.  Often, when the formula ??n??a?? (man from a land where?.), this sort of u??u?ai is intended.  I am pasting in a much more elaborate instance of an u??u?ai in a marutam poem (about the courtesan).  Those who work with Sanskrit suggestion may find it interesting, I think.  George Hart


Akan????u 46. Marutam
The friend refuses the request of the hero who asks her to allow him to see the heroine.  (This does not seem to fit the poem, which appears to be the words of the heroine.)


In your town, a red-eyed buffalo gets tired of being penned in mud
and at night, when everyone is asleep, breaks the rope holding him,
opens the sharp-thorned fence with his horns
and, as the fish all flee from him on the water-filled field,
stirs up the va??ai flowers with their lovely throats	5
and eats the cool lotuses while the bees buzz inside them.
Who are you that we should be angry with you?
Others brought a woman to our house, her dark, falling hair
more lovely than a line of descending rain clouds,
and said that you had made love to her.  We have nothing to say about that?	10
may you live well, my lord.  I am as beautiful as A???r
thick with stacks of paddy, city of victorious Ce?iya?
whose armies have shining spears that cut through and kill
in fierce battle with enemies and their elephants, yet
if the bright bangles on my arms must grow loose, let them.	15
Go, my lord, no one will keep you here.
A???r Na?mullaiy?r
OC construes the suggested meaning (u??urai) of this as follows: ?The buffalo has turned its shed into a mire with its water and dung, broken its bond, broken open the fence that is protecting the field with its horns, stirred up the swamp morning glories that surround lotuses so that fish run away, and investigated the lotuses that are closed and unflowering with bees (inside).  Like that, you have made her who is protected by you other (i.e. ruined her beauty as she is distraught), broken the bond of shame, broken open the fence that protects the courtesan with the horn of your bard (who serves as a messenger to the courtesan), stirred up the mothers of those courtesans so that the friends who stay with them flee, and been a person who, bursting with egotism, enjoys women who do not welcome you.?


5. Va??ai is the swamp morning glory.  Its flowers have the same shape as ordinary morning glories.
6. ?Bees buzz inside  them? is va??u ?tu pa?i malar, literally ?the cool flowers where bees hum (or feed).?  Because it is night, presumably the lotuses have closed and trapped the bees.
10. ?Had made love to her? is vatuvai ayarnta?ai, which could also mean ?had married her.?

Eva Wilden has already given a satisfactory explanation for the tree and mountain.  According to Eva, "more easily to be connected with the rest of the poem may be that SHE is as much rooted in HIM as the I??i in the stone." Analyzing further, the stone can be taken to represent the strong hero and the tree with low aerial roots being the heroine weakened by the separation but still holding on to her faith in the hero.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY]  Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2


Here is a literal translation of Ku?untokai 106 by Kapilar.


In his land, the white roots spreading on the mountain from the dun-colored (i.e. nondescript) runners of the i??i
look like waterfalls descending from a hill.
The words of his heart that holds no malice
have come (to me), friend,
and (I took them) as fire takes ghee/oil (OR they were like fire when ghee/oil is poured on it).
(Now) I must send a messenger to say
that I am the same as when we became (or were) lovers (or were married).


Here are two possible interpretations that I see:


The image of ghee/oil feeding a fire means that his words, which she did not expect, made her suddenly experience relief and passion.  In this case, Palaniappan is correct in interpreting ma?a as union and not marriage, especially as this appears to be a kuri?ci poem dealing with premarital love.  The messenger is likely to be a P??a?, though this is not expressed, and the situation, as in other ku?i?ci poems, is that the hero who used to come and see the heroine secretly at night is no longer coming.  The heroine becomes distressed but is suddenly heartened when a messenger (P??a??) comes and tells her that the hero still cares for her.  She immediately (like oil feeding fire) feels her passion and love flare up and wishes to send a message to the hero to tell him that she still cares and feels the same as when they were lovers.


HOWEVER there is a problem with this analysis, and that is the image of the runners and roots of the i??i tree, which clearly are intended to suggest that things are not as they seem.  That would suggest that we take ?which holds no malice? as sarcastic and the image of the fire taking the ghee/oil as one of anger flaring up (following the suggestion of the Kazhagam commentator, C?macuntara??r).  In that case, ma?a could mean ?marry? and the last line could mean ?the same as when we married.?  In this interpretation, the poem, in spite of its ku?i?ci imagery, is really a marutam poem and the hero, who has been with his courtesans, has sent the P??a? off to conciliate his angry wife.  She hears his words sanctimoniously describing the hero?s pure heart and sarcastically echoes them, concluding that she will send the messenger to tell him that while he has changed and is unfaithful to her, she has not changed.  She wishes to make the hero feel guilty.


Of these two interpretations, I think the second one is likely to be the correct one, as otherwise the image at the beginning of the poem does not make sense.  The point of the image would appear to be that just as the root of the rather ugly and parasitic i??i tree looks like a beautiful waterfall, the hero?s reprobate heart appears pure.  I don?t think the poem can be understood without discovering the intent of the image at its beginning, and that would seem to mean that this has to be a marutam poem.  It?s worth noting that Kapilar is one of the greatest Indian poets ? he is unlikely to have put in an image at the beginning of a poem that has no relation to its content.



n?? nil? mu??attu ni??u iva? n?kki???;
k??um?, Ka??apuram! e??u k???i???;
p??a??r ti??am irukka, i?i, iva?
n??um?? na??u na??u Na?aiy?rarkk?!



A literal translation:
She stood on the open space with its long moonlight and looked.
And she pointed asking ?Can one see the city of Ka??a? (Krishna) (from here)??
The excellent P??a? was firm, and now will she feel ashamed?
A fine thing indeed is this for the person from Na?aiy?r (Vi??u)!


It would seem that the hero/Vi??u is leading the heroine on, and that the P??a? is insisting on the hero?s uprightness.  The last line suggests that the hero (or Vi??u) is not as upright as the P??a? suggests.  This makes sense as a marutam poem, I think ? especially given the last line, which seems to me to have the connotation that the hero is not being honest with the heroine.  The poem has two perspectives ? the marutam situation in which the hero is with his courtesans but tries to conciliate the heroine by telling her he is a good person (which he is not, since he is visiting courtesans) and the religious one, in which God is playing with the soul of the devotee and is hard to get.  A notable thing about this is that P??a??r is made respective, suggesting that, as the commentary says, the P??a? symbolizes the ?c?ryas whose teachings bring the souls of others to Vi??u.  Perhaps the intent is that the ?c?ryas are firm in their teaching, and so devotees who hear them should not feel discouraged or ashamed, even though (last line) Vi??u is elusive.


There is a lot of speculation here. I believe that the Ku?untokai poem is probably a marutam poem about the hero visiting his courtesans and the same is true of the verse from the Periya Tirumo?i ? but it?s a tough call, and I would certainly see Palaniappan?s analysis as possible.

I think the solution to the problem presented by Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is given by Ku?untokai 106 by Kapilar. What I am giving below is the poem based on the critical edition by Eva Wilden but with gemination of consonants shown in pu?arcci.








pul v?? i??ik kal ivar ve? v?r
varai i?i aruviyi? t???um n??a?
t?tu il ne?cattuk ki?avi namvayin
vanta??u v??i t??i n?mum

The translation below is basically Eva Wilden's except that I have changed 'ghee' to 'oil' for ney.


Word has come to us, oh friend,
	from the faultless heart of the man from a land where,
	    like the waterfall descending the mountain,
	appears the stone-climbing white root of the talbot fig
									with low aerial roots,
   After receiving [his words] like fire into which oil is poured,
we too shall send a message saying    
					    'we are still those he united with.'


While ney can mean both oil and ghee, ney pey t? simply refers to a situation of 'adding fuel to the fire' as in the following passage from Arttamu??a Intumatam by Kannadasan, showing the common usage of oil being poured into a fire. 



"???;????? ???? ??????????????, ?????????????? ?????????.
???????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ??? ??????????? ?????????.
 
??? ????? ??????????????????, ???? ???????????????? ??????? ????????????????? ??????????????????."


The notes given by UVS to Ku?untokai 106 show that the commentator I?amp?ra?ar considers the poem to describe a pre-marital situation in which the heroine does not dislike/is not angry at the messenger from the hero. But Nacci??rkki?iyar, another commentator, thinks the poem deals with a situation after marriage. A comment by P?r?ciriyar, another commentator, that receiving 'like fire into which ney is poured', is not possible in a pre-marital situation. May be he associates ney being poured into the fire with the Vedic fire ritual. I do not consider that a likely scenario. In contrast, I?amp?ra?ar's discussion of the poem in Ka?aviyal makes more sense. Wilden is right in translating 'ma?a-' as 'unite' and not as 'marry' as some scholars have done. The waterfall and mountain clearly suggest Ku?i?ci as the landscape, as some scholars have considered. There is nothing in the poem that suggests that there is an 'other woman' in the picture. So I do not agree with T. V. Gopal Iyer's view that this poem belongs to Marutam.


Who is the messenger here? According to Tolk?ppiyam Poru?atik?ram, those who are allowed to speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love include p?rpp?? (brahmin/priest), p??ka? (companion), heroine's friend, heroine's foster mother, hero and heroine. Although the commentary for I?aiya??r Ka?aviyal 3 identifies the companion as a p?rpp??, Nacci??rkki?iyar (commentary for Ka?aviyal 10) only says that the companion is "perump??mai p?rpp???m", i.e., in majority of the instances the companion is a brahmin/priest.  Although poems like Ku?untokai 156 suggest the companion being a brahmin/priest, Na??i?ai 250 and Na??i?ai 370, in both of which, the hero invites the bard to laugh with him, suggest that the companion could have been a bard earlier. Moreover Nacci??rkki?iyar in his commentary on Tol. P. 193 refers to p??a? as p??ku pa??o?ukum p??a? and p??i?i as talaivim???up p??k?yo?ukum p??i?i even as Tol.P. 193 lists p??ka? separately from the bard and his female counterpart. Interestingly, in their commentaries to the s?tra beginning with "ava?a?i v???a", I?amp?ra?ar considers Na??i?ai 90 as spoken to the hero's companion. But Nacci??kki?iyar considers the same poem as spoken to the bard. 


Thus whatever be the view of the later grammarians in classifying the companions as distinct from the bards and that only companions could speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love, the internal evidence from the poems suggest that the bards could have been companions too. If that were accepted then, they could have served as messengers not only after marriage but before marriage too. 


If that were accepted, Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2, makes eminent sense.  A maiden being in love with the hero (Vi??u), the bard (p??a??r interpreted as religious teacher) acting as a messenger, and the girl being resolute in passion towards Vi??u, all fit the pre-marital love scenario with no 'other woman' being present.  The lack of anger towards the messenger also explains the honorific form, p??a??r.


I would appreciate any comments on this solution.


Thanks in advance.

Palaniappan

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2





Even with the understanding that the devotional poems of the Vai??ava saints do not strictly follow the conventions of the Classical Tamil love poetry, the interpretation of Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is perplexing. Here is the verse given in Periya Tirumo?i Ira???m Tokuti (with Periyav?cc?? Pi??ai's commentary translated into Tamil by Ti. V?. K?p?laiyar) produced by EFEO and published by Teyvac C?kki??r Caivacitt?ntap P??ac?lai, Ta?c?v?r, 2006, p. 962.


n?? nil? mu??attu ni??u iva? n?kki???;
k??um?, Ka??apuram! e??u k???i???;
p??a??r ti??am irukka, i?i, iva?
n??um?? na??u na??u Na?aiy?rarkk?!


The verse is supposed to be the utterance of a mother about her daughter in love with Vi??u. The traditional commentary (p. 965) explains 'p?????r' in the verse by relating it to the Classical Tamil Marutam genre in which the bard acts as a messenger from the husband to his wife , who is mad at him for having gone to the other woman. But then it goes on to explain that 'p??a??r' represents the religious teachers, who act to bring the souls toward 'God' and that in the verse the girl is resolute in her faith because of the religious teachers. And the mother concludes that the resolute girl will not be bashful in expressing her love toward Vi??u.  See attachment. 


I am not convinced by the commentary's explanation about the association with Marutam, the resoluteness of the bard, who is referred to in a very respectful way, and the lack of bashfulness of the girl. The respectful way the bard is mentioned suggests more of Mullai.  Won't a better interpretation be that the mother talks about her daughter, a maiden, who sends a message to her beloved through the bard; the bard comes back with the message that the hero will join her soon; emboldened by this certainty, the maiden has no bashfulness in expressing her love; and the mother is critical of the hero for causing this immodest behavior in her daughter? (Of course, many ti?ai conventions are violated here too.)


I would appreciate any comments on this verse and possible interpretations.


Thanks in advance

Palaniappan
