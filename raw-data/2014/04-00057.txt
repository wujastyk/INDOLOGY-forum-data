Dear Patrick,

R.L. Turner's _A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Languages_ (p. 168, right column) lists kutta as meaning 'rent, lease ... rent in kind ... hire of land ... letting for a fixed rental ... survey, valuation'. The CDIL also informs us that the word occurs in Prakrit, Kumauni, Nepali and (only in the last, possibly unrelated  sense 'survey, valuation') Hindi. 

Your phrase "with the stipulation" does not seem to correspond to any word in the Sarasvat?vil?sa passage you quote. As I read the passage, it seems to gives two understandings of kutta, one paaribhaa.sika and one non-paaribhaa.sika. Are there any readings available that would give us the meaning (or has a typo occurred that when corrected would mean) ... ??????????, ?????? ???? (???????? contextually understood) ? (?????????? contextually understood) ?????????????: ?
