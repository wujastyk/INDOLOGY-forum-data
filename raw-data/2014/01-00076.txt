Dear Dr Chakrabarti,

Thanks for your email. I am grateful for you tried to look for information on J.C. Chatterjee. I wrote to the list only because there is not much published information available on him. Obviously, we do have all the volumes of KSTS available in PDF including the ones edited by J.C. Chatterjee. Thanks anyway for your email.

Best wishes.

Mrinal Kaul
