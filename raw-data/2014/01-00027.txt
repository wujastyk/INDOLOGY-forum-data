> Dear colleagues,
> 
> Would anybody have a pdf scan of the following work? I could only find the 1905 Report. The 1901 Report is not available anywhere here in Japan and I have searched through archive.org,hathitrust.org and Wujastik's mss catalogue site but to no avail.

> Shastri, Haraprasad. Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts (1895-1900). Calcutta: Asiatic soc. of Bengal, 1901.
> 
> The work appears to have only 25pp. So it should be light enough to send through private email. 
> 
> Many thanks in advance and best wishes for the festive season,
