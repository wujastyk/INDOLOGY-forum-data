Subject: [INDOLOGY] In search of a copy of one article by L. Sternbach
Message-ID: <7B8C2490-0BBD-4B5C-8CF2-94437D14D532@uclouvain.be>

Dear List,
would it be possible for some colleague to provide me with a .pdf copy of the following article:
L. Sternbach  "An attempt to reconstruct a ? lost? work of R?ja?ekhara", In: Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, vol. 61, 1981, p. 21-?
Maybe I am wrong, but I did not find (as expected from below) the ABORI on JSTOR.
Best wishes
Christophe Vielle

Dear All,

This is to inform you with great pleasure that the first 87 volumes of the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (ABORI) have become available on the JSTOR.

Indeed  a major source of studies !!
