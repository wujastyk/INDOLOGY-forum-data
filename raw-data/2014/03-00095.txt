Dear List,

I am looking for a PDF of the Vakyapadiya edited by Prof. Charudeva Sastri. My searches for it in the usual repositories have so far been in vain. The Wordcat entry <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/83847640> shows that it is available only at Harvard. I will be much thankful if anybody could kindly help me locate an electronic copy of this work.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
