Revealing interview with Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, Modi's new Chairman of
the powerful Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), in today's
_Outlook India_:

"Ramayana, Mahabharata Are True Accounts Of The Period...Not Myths"
http://tinyurl.com/qadhsft

Commentary in the same edition by Anuradha Raman:
"Ram, Where Art Thou"?
http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Ram-Where-Art-Thou/291362

Total public silence from Western Indologists so far on Rao's appointment,
which is curious.

Typical quotation from the interview with Rao, a colleague of NS Rajaram,
responding to questions from the interviewer:

*You are the author of the Mahabharata project? What is the project about?*

There is a certain view that the Mahabharata or the Ramayana are myths. I
don?t see them as myths because they were written at a certain point of
time in history. They are important sources of information in the way we
write history. What we write today may become an important source of
information for the fut?ure in the future. When analysed, of course, they
could be declared to be true or false. History is not static. It belongs to
the people, it?s made by the people. Similarly, the Ram?ayana is true for
people...it?s in the collective memory of generations of Indians. We can?t
say the Ramayana or the Mahabharata are myths. Myths are from a western
perspective.

*What does that mean?*

For us, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are true accounts of the periods
in which they were written.
