1. In fact it has been applied to the story of Ramayana too.

2. In Das'aroopaka too this comes as part of discussion of Vastu, Vastu in
general and not Vastu of Rupaka alone. Vastubhedas such as Prakhyaata,
Utpaadya and Mis'ra also , though discussed in Das'aroopaka are applied to
the Vastus or Itivrittas of S'ravyakaavyas als.

3. S'aakuntalam is not khyaatavrittam. It is mis'ravrittam.

4. Whether the Panchasandhi structure helps in understanding Vastus of
Roopakas alone or it applies to Vastus of other narrative literary works
also, can be checked by literary scholars. There is nothing inside the
theory which is roopaka-specific.

5. Comparable to this in the western poetics is the  five part structure of
exposition, rising action, climax/crisis, falling action,
denoument/resolution  also in its origin comes from the theory of Drama. Is
it not applied/applicable to other narratives?
