Subject: [INDOLOGY] Hess' "SIDDHARTHA" in Sanskrit

In all this discussion nobody seems to have noticed that Hermann Hesse's name was misspelt. And that from someone in Germany! It is Hesse, not Hess.
Happy New Year to everybody!

Most people will be angry that their email address has been given to a distributor without their permission, and correspondingly unhappy to receive this work.  It will create the opposite of the intended impression.
