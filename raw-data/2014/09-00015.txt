Subject: [INDOLOGY] Call for papers JSARH
Message-ID: <CADUnV1091tB-j4b8osYz27i8YoddHxON__Y1wxkv+xJiHh=x3w@mail.gmail.com>

 Hello All,
Please see below JSARH call for paper. Next issue is slated for publication
in January, 2015.
Thank you,
Lavanya

*CALL FOR PAPERS:* The *Journal of South Asian Religious History* calls for
original papers for inclusion in its inaugural January-February 2015 issue.
*JSARH* is the first scholarly journal devoted solely to the role of faith
systems in the history of the subcontinent as part of a broader effort to
increase understanding of Hinduism and its variants, Buddhism, South Asian
Islam, Jainism, Sikhism, and other South Asian religious traditions *as
historical agents* (with special emphasis on religion-and-politics) in
South Asia, the Indian Ocean rim, and the wider world. Paper topics should
focus on some aspect of one or more South Asian religious tradition *as a
force in subcontinental history*. Emphasis should be on history rather than
theology and/or religious practice. Topics of any historical era will be
considered, with preference given to papers highlighting the
religion-and-politics phenomenon, especially in the early modern or modern
periods.
