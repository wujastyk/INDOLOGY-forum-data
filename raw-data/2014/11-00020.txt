Thanks to everyone for excellent recommendations for this topic.  The earlier thread was also very helpful.  My first impression is that the topic is fairly well addressed within Buddhist Studies but that other Indological areas rich in primary sources have only begun to put the various pieces together.  I greatly appreciate your help.

Best regards,

Don Davis

this topic has come up before.  A keyword search of the INDOLOGY archive, link at indology.info<http://indology.info>, will give the earlier recommendations.
Best,

Dear colleagues,

I would be grateful for further recommendations of secondary studies pertaining to childhood and children in ancient India, especially those with a historical, epigraphical, or literary focus.  I am aware of the studies below that touch on some aspects of children?s lives and training. The literature on sons specifically is easier to find, but it clusters around the ideal twelve-sons categorization in Dharmasastra.  I?m looking for studies outside of Dharmasastra, if possible.  SARDS-3 was helpful.  Is there nothing more like Phillipe Aries?s Centuries of Childhood, for those of you who may know it?  Any leads would be appreciated.

Thanks,
