Subject: [INDOLOGY] Jain names and titles
Message-ID: <e07a819f3c937d6305c8d14d15ce75b6@fabularasa.dk>

Dear list,

In reading the colophons of Jain manuscripts, I am often overwhelmed by 
the plethora of names and titles and what they communicate about the 
position and ranking of individual monks. I often have to resort to the 
aid of my Jain friends to clear things up for me, but I wonder if there 
might be a compendium of Jain names and titles where these things can be 
looked up.

Any references or suggestions would be much appreciated.

Kind regards,
Jacob
