Thanks for sharing this Dominik. I guess this is in preparation for Modi's
expected victory. Motilal has been heading downhill fast for some time--I
guess now they have finally hit bottom. A petition is a great idea, but
maybe one could also address the general decline in Indological titles in
favor of new age crap that preceded this. Best,J
