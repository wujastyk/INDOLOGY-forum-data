Subject: [INDOLOGY] Precomposed characters vs combining characters
In-Reply-To: <1712AE20-8631-47D0-BBF9-ACD63D238655@fastwebnet.it>
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CcwD-QNS-vd8kcm4TbWwL+DPpappGBtgq+yEGV8OtLndg@mail.gmail.com>

Although the Unicode standard describes both forms as canonically
normalized,* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence> I would
recommend precomposed (or NFC, *Normalization Form Canonical Composition*).
At the top of my XeLaTeX files, for example, I routinely say
"\XeTeXinputnormalization=1" which means the output PDFs contain
precomposed characters, whatever I do in my input file.  I think you should
not pay too much attention to the current (dis)abilities of various
word-processors.  In the Big World, and in the future, precomposed is what
makes sense.  The task of intelligent printing, searching and sorting -- of
searching for ss and also finding ?, for Mueller and finding M?ller --  is
most appropriately located in the rendering and search/sort routines, not
the encoding of the text.  Actually, properly Unicode-compliant text
processing utilities are required to handle all NF(K)C and NF(K)D forms
without blinking.  Also, W3C normalization requires NFC. So if a text is
going to be rendered on a website, it should be in NFC (or in a character
reference entity, which looks nice but is normally horrible to work with).

See also question two, in the Unicode normalization
FAQ<http://www.unicode.org/faq/normalization.html>:
"NFC is the best form for general text, since it is more compatible with
strings converted from legacy encodings."

?Best,
Dominik?
