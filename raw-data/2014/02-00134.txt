I have learnt from a reliable source that Mr. Batra initiated no less than ten lawsuits against NCERT's (NCERT stands for National Council for Educational Research and Training) textbooks during the years 2004-2010. He lost all of them. Isn't it strange that Penguin so easily gives in, when NCERT fought back and won. One would assume that a great company like Penguin can manage the legal fees involved.
Best to all
