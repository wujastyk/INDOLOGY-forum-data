I was immediately put in mind of Col. Sleeman's decipherment of the secret
language of the Thugs, which he wrote about in 1836 in his book
Ramaseeana.

I also seem to remember that there's a little about Buddhist tantric
"sandhaabhaa.saa" in Agehananda Bharati's book on Tantra.  There may well
be a more developed literature on this, but it's not my field.  I read
Bharati's book a long time ago, as an academic tourist, so to speak.
