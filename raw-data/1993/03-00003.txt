Subject: GRIERSON AND HALL WRITING

          LOC  has  a  vol.  of minor works  of Tulasidasa with interleaved 
          blank  pages  and extensive notes, which  there  is  some  slight 
          reason to think may have belonged once  to George Grierson.  Does 
          anyone  have examples of  his handwriting, in  both  English  and 
          Nagari, they could send me for comparison? 
           
          Likewise we have recently acquired a  copy of Bhaskara's Lilavati 
          with  the signature of  F. Edward Hall, i.e. Fitzedward Hall, and 
          extensive corrections and annotations.  Does anyone  have samples 
          of his handwriting in both scripts of which they could send us  a 
          copy? 
           
          If  no  one  can directly supply me with copies of  the hands, do 
          they know where some of Grierson's and Hall's papers are held?  
          Please reply directly to  me (THRASHER at MAIL.LOC.GOV) rather  than 
          to INDOLOGY.
