Blurb:
This volume was prompted by a felt need for an introduction to South Asia,
and also to the Centre of South Asian Studies at the School of Oriental and
African Studies (SOAS) in the University of London.
... The editors, helped by a wider committee, made a selection from among
recent published works of internal staff-members of the Centre, of whom there
are currently 47, their scholarship embracing languages and literatures,
history, law and the social sciences.
... Here we focus on some institutions and ideologies - the state, an army,
a political party, and religion, law, medicine, language, literature and
political thought.
