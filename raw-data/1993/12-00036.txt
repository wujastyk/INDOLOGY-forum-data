The fairly orthodox anthropological explanation would be that the backwards
feet are just one more (arbitrary) sign of reversal. The churel or bhut is
a woman who is malevolent and powerful, where 'normal' women are (supposed
to be) benificent and subordinate; she often sucks the blood of babies
where 'normal' women nurture them with milk; and so forth. There is a
smallish anthropological literature on such things in the Indian context.
