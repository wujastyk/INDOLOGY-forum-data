    Date: Tue, 21 Sep
 
 
    This is a Request For Discussion for a usenet newsgroup,
    soc.culture.tibet.  All discussion on this should take place in
    news.groups.  A Call For Votes on this group will be posted soon.
 
    Third Request For Discussion: soc.culture.tibet (moderated)
 
    Charter:
 
    Soc.culture.tibet will be a forum for all aspects of Tibetan culture.
    Cultural discussion includes the topics of Tibetan history, language,
    arts, religion, geography, politics, people, and current events.
    Anyone with an interest in Tibetan culture is invited to participate.
 
    The Tibetan culture developed over many centuries in near total isolation.
    The geographic inaccessibility and a formidable language barrier kept
    authentic information about the Tibetan society and culture from reaching
    the West throughout most of its history.  Many people have embraced the
    study of Tibetan culture since Tibetans began emigrating recently.
 
    Moderation policy:
 
    Discussion of all aspects of Tibetan culture from all viewpoints is
    welcome.  The intent of moderation is to ensure that postings are topical.
 
    Moderators, at their discretion, may request a submission be restated,
    or may refuse a submission, if the content of the submission fits any
    of the following conditions:
 
    a) The content does not directly fit the description given in the Charter.
    b) The content is a duplication of material recently presented.
    c) The content is obviously abusive, incoherent or slanderous.
 
    Cross-posting between this group and others is discouraged.
 
    Moderators:
 
    The moderator responsibilities will be shared by:

         Jan Isley           jan at bagend.atl.ga.us

    group.  Moderators or advisors may be replaced by a 2/3 majority vote
    of the advisors.  The advisory group consists of the following people:
