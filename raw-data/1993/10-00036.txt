 Absolutely! Vigyan Bhairava Tantra prescribes gazing at the skies as 
a technique in meditation. Folks who gathered at these places in 
ancient (and modern) times studiously stared up for long periods of 
time on starlit nights trying to gauge their place in the universe, 
and ultimately themselves. Observatories still remain special 
mystical places for the folks who gather there on starlit nights.
