I make some very brief remarks on translation in my recent book Metarules of
Paninian Grammar (Groningen: Forsten, 1993), vol. 2, pp. xxix, xxx.  My
remarks are about technical translation (vyakarana), not literary
translation, though.

A conference on translation from Indian languages into English has just
taken place this last week in London.  A large number of active
creative writers and translators from India and elsewhere attended; I
met Girish Karnad last night: he was at the meeting and said it had
been very stimulating and well-attended.  Contact Julia Leslie
(j.leslie at ucl.ac.uk) from more information.
