One Year After Ayodhya: Conference, Concert, Exhibition, Rally
_____________________________________________________

On December 6, 1992, the Babri Masjid, a 500-year old historical
and cultural monument belonging to all Indians, was demolished 
in a premeditated act of political vandalism. In the violence which
followed, more than two thousand people were killed.

One year later, the Indian Progressive Study Group (IPSG), along
with other organisations, is marking the occasion with a series of 
events aimed at finding ways of ensuring tha such tragedies are
never allowed to happen again.

We would like to invite you to attend all or part of these
programmes.
