I am not really an expert, but I think the problems will not be to difficult.
Using a table lookup, you can easily find the equivalent Tibetan character for
a Devanagari character. I think that the parallell encoding of the various
indic scripts is misleading, in that sense that you still need to do table
lookup if you want to transliterate one in the other, as in most Indic scripts
there are minor differences in encoded characters, for example, in Tamil, both
aspirated and voiced versions of consonants are missing, and when trying to
display Malayalam in Tamil script, these should be mapped to other characters
(which indicates that round trip mapping is not possible).

The additional problem with Sinhala is then that it includes some more
characters (A, AE, AA, AEAE, and nasalized characters) which cannot be coded
in parallel, as they are not known in the Devanagari prototype.

The filling nature of TSEG is still under investigation, as far as I know.
