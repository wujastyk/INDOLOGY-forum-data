Message-ID: <161227015775.23782.13923783137347178939.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 blackbox.hacc.washington.edu is now host to rasratna.zip in
 pub/indic.  This file is accessible via anonymous ftp.
 If you do not know about 'zip' or 'ftp', read the postscript after
 my signature.

 This file contains the IASS/CSX encoded version of:
{
 The Rasaratnasamuccaya of Vagbhata: machine readable transcription,
 based on the Anandasrama Sanskrit Series edition, vol. 19,
 edited by Krishnaravasharman Vinayaka Bapata, Poona 1890.

 Covers up to chapter 5, verse 23.

 Transcription by Wieslaw Mical, Som Dev Vasudeva and Anne Glazier,
 of SOAS, London.
}  IASS/CSX refers to a proposed standard encoding for romanized
indic textual material.  For those who are new to this group, the same
directory contains other texts in CSX---get the file README.

You have recently read about the current text in a message from Dominik as:
> 1/ Vagbrasa.zip
>    The first five and a bit chapters of the Rasaratnasamuccaya of
>    Vaagbha.ta.  This is an alchemical text.  Here is the readme file:
> 
> ---------- beginning of vagbrasa readme --------------
> 
> The Rasaratnasamuccaya of Vaagbha.ta: machine readable transcription
> ====================================================================
This rasaratnasamuccaya is that rasaratnasamuccaya; only the encoding is
different.

cheers,
Tom

Zip is a standard method for archiving and compressing files for more
compact storage and faster transmission through networks.  You must
have an unzip utility to make use of a zipped file.  Consult your local
computer support team if you need assistance in acquiring an unzip

Ftp is the 'file transfer protocol' widely used for moving files from
machine to machine over the network.  That you are able to recieve this
e-mail message suggests (but does not prove) that you have the capability
of performing ftp (if you knew but how!).  For assistance in this matter,
consult your local computer support team.  N.b. zip files must be
transferred in binary mode: be sure to ask what that means.  Also tell
them that you need to know how to do 'anonymous' ftp.
