1969. From this book I need nothing but pp. 394-404: B. Prakash: On Panini
5.3.99.
    The book seems not to be available in Germany. They sent me a Aditya
Natha Jha Comm.Vol (JGJSV 31.1975), nice but useless. If some good soul
out there could send me a Xerox (H.F.; Erwinstr. 26; DW-7800 Freiburg)
it would be necessary to pass a note to the list in order to prevent others
from sending 20 odd more copies and to tell me frankly how I can
return the help.
    Is it necessary to discuss this sort of possible service? Or are we
already completely satisfied with what has been achieved so far?
