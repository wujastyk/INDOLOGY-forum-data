Subject: SOFTSWITCH

Lloyd,//  Here is an explanation of Softswitch provided at my request fo 
r an Indian correspondent.////Dear Mr. Kuppuraj, 
Allen Thrasher forwarded to me your message about Soft Switch.  We 
have an in-house EMail package here at LC called CA-eMail which has been in 
use for over 10 years and supports 3500 staff members.  Soft Switch is a 
mail gateway that enables us to exchange mail between CA-eMail and SMTP 
(Internet mail). 
  
The way that Soft Switch works:  CA-eMail users receive an Internet address 
of the general form LASTNAME at MAIL.LOC.GOV.  (for example, the Internet 
address for my CA-eMail account is kearns at mail.loc.gov.)  When an Internet 
user sends to this address, a router here at LC recognizes the host name of 
MAIL and routes those messages to the Soft Switch application on our IBM 
mainframe.  Soft Switch then looks up the LASTNAME and translates that to 
the user's CA-eMail address and then sends the message on to the 
recipient's CA-eMail mail box.  Also, so that the CA-eMail user can respond 
to the Internet user, Soft Switch saves the Internet user's address in its 
names directory.  When the CA-eMail user responds to you, the message goes 
through Soft Switch and gets converted to an SMTP message with the proper 
address. 
  
I'm not sure if this is the type of info you wanted.  Feel free to write 
back to me at the address below or to kearns at mail.loc.gov.

----Lloyd, 
 
  Kearns confirms my conclusion that therefore the only pertinence of Softswitch 
to non-LOC people is that  if  they have several LOC correspondents or  wish  to 
acquire a  new one, it might make  it easier for  the  LOC person to supply them 
with the outsider's Softswitch address.  Softswitch is confined to  LOC and  not 
used by anyone else including other Federal agencies.   
 
  I  have noticed by  the  way  that they same outside correspondent can acquire 
multiple Softswitch addresses,  I  guess  depending  on  multiple  routes  their 
messages take coming in.
