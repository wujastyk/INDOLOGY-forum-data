          The  Royal Nepal Academy of Science & Technology (RONAST) has 
          obtained an ERNET node for the Kingdom of Nepal. Their system 
          is connected  to  the  VIKRAM  system  of  the  Department of 
          Electronics,  New Delhi, India. The ERNET is connected to the 
          INTERNET through this VIKRAM system. 
            
          This system has been recently established. It may still be in 
          a testing stage. I just received  a  meassge which was mailed 
          four days ago.The Email address of the Computer Section Chief 
          is listed below. INTERNET users can  write to him for further 
          information.

               The following article of mine was published in the Florida-N 
          Association's Newsletter a couple of months ago. Dual-citizenship

          any interest to the TND community which I assume consists mostly  
          who have more things to worry than that of dual citizenship. Howe
