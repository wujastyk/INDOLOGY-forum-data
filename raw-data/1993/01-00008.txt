A colleague in my department has gotten a grant, part of which is
to be applied to setting up a computer laboratory in which there will
be software installed for drilling students in classical Greek and
Biblical Hebrew. Such software reportedly exists for the Macintosh
platform, and it seems likely that that is what will be purchased
to get us started. My colleague has indicated that some of the
grant money could be applied to purchasing computer-assisted drills
for Sanskrit, Pali and Tibetan, if any exist. Do any exist?
