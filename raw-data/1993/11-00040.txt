Subject: ARALIKATTI

          The word Aralikatti means a platform with Arali tree.  I have not 
          seen Badami Cave.  Arali  tree  is worshipped by  women  to  have 
          children.  Couple  will install Stone serpents to  worship around 
          the bottom of this tree (sometimes 2 trees).  Katti 
          Katte, the platform, is used   in small towns to settle disputes, 
          jave meetings, etc.    Shantha
