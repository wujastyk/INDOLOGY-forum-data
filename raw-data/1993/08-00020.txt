Subject: WM. PRUITT'S ADDRESS

          Does  anyone  know  the current address  of  William Pruitt,  the 
          scholar of Pali and Burmese?   The Library of Congress would like 
          to  know  if  he  is interested in several Burmese MSS  that have 
          surfaced since he did his catalog of Burmese MSS in LOC.  I would 
          also like to discuss another collection he might be interested in 
          cataloging.
