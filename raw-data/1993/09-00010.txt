There is a very useful (and long) document by Art St George which lists
over 100 on-line library catalogues world-wide, mostly in the US but also
including Bodley. It also provides a description of what's there and very
clear instructions on how to make contact. Below is an extract from a
recent announcement which gives details of how to get the latest version of
the document.

For those of you who can use a gopher server, I searched 'gopherspace' with
the key words 'library catalogs' (NB: US spelling of catalogue) and turned
up dozens of leads to follow, including direct search facilities, documents
like the one described below, discussions on compatibility etc.

=================================

A new relese of the Internet-Accessible Library Catalogs
and Databases has been posted on LISTSERV at UNMVM.

To obtain the revised file, send mail or a command to
LISTSERV at UNMVM.  The body of the mail or command should say

the file.  The Postscript version is obtained by using the
command GET LIBRARY PS.  Because of the size of the PS
file, some users may experience difficulties in retrieving
it.

Both the ascii and PS files are also obtainable via
