The rules governing the use of the Internet are very strict in forbidding
any commercial use of the net, *especially advertising*.  While the above
message may be interesting and useful, it could get us all into a lot
of trouble.  INDOLOGY might have to close down.

So please, be careful about this sort of thing.  There are ways of
mentioning commercial services and products en passant which let
everyone know about them without blatantly advertising.
