Hi, Dwight.  The text by Nagarjuna is the Rasendramangala, not 
Rasaratnakara. (A common error: see my article in the journal
_Ambix_ 1984).  I have been collecting manuscripts for about a 
decade, and I now have about eight or nine.  I have a 
transcription on disk of one of them that is *extremely* 
corrupt, so much so that it is hardly worth offering you a copy 
yet.  I plan to work on the text over the next couple of years.

If it is actually *Nityanatha's* Rasaratnakara that you are interested
in, it has been printed in parts here and there, with varying degrees
of quality.  There's a bibliography at the end of my 1984 article 
that lists the editions.

Best wishes,

Dominik
