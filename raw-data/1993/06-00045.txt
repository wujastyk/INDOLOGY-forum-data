The FontShop in Toronto sells a product called ParaWin for $79 (Canadian)
separately or packaged with a Cyrillic font for $121.
ParaWin is a keyboard manager tool for windows which allows the user
to select which code will be generated for any key or combination
of keys. The tool also allows the user to switch from one keyboard 
to another.
