Dear Dr. David Magier,
Thank you very much for giving us very valuable information.
I successfully downloaded two graphic images of from caltech
archive (tajmahal.gif and multan1.gif).  They are really
beuuuuutiful!.
I wanted to get srinagar.gif but it was missing in the
directory.  I wonder whether it was removed by some political
reason.
