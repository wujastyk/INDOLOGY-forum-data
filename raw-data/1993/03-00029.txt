I have a forthcoming book to be published by the Smithsonian Institution
Press, Washington DC, in May 1993:

Civilized Shamans: Buddhism in Tibetan Societies.

This is an anthropological study of Tibetan religion (or maybe
more accurately religion in Tibetan societies). Part One is a
survey of Tibetan societies, Part Two an account of Tibetan religion
in the pre-modern period (mainly), Part Three a history of its
development. The general stress is on variety and fluidity of
Tibetan religious forms, linked to the variety and fluidity of
Tibetan political and social forms.
