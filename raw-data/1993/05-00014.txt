Subject: Diacritics for Word Perfect
Message-ID: <161227015809.23782.9415795840299038415.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear David Nelson-
 
Some time ago I purchased a diacritics program for WordPerfect designed by
Tony Duff of The Tibetan Computer Company in Boulder, Colorado. It works with
the DOS based WP 5.0 and 5.1 versions. I have it for Palatino fonts (the
equivalent of Times Roman) and Courrier fonts. I have found it to be absolutely
great in all respects. It does everything I could ask of it.
 
The problem is that I think the company may have gone out of business. The last
time I tried calling them to get some support, I was told that the phone number
was discontinued. I would suppose that there are enough people with copies that
if you needed some, they are certainly available. All you need is a system with
some hard drive space, VGA graphics with 256K, and an HP LaserJet printer and
you're in business. They did make a printer driver for dot-matrix printers, but
the system is actually desinged for HP LaserJet or printers that emulate it.
 
If there's any way I can help beyond my superficial knowledge of how it works,
don't hesitate to ask.
