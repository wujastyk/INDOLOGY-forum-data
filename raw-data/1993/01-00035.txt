Subject: Re: Rigveda

 In contrast to folks like Richard Cohen and Michio Yano, I do find
Subhash Kak's postings to be original and thought provoking. They
certainly are in the spirit of this list which I understand to be a
discussion of classical India. Since the Rigveda is the core of
Indian culture, a new insight into its structure and meaning is
certainly of great interest to me and other Indologists.
 Linkage of resignations from this list to Dr Kak's postings, seems
more spite rather than a scholarly observation.
 Furthermore, Michio Kano is to be reminded that Al-Biruni is no
great authority on classical Indian literature. His comment can
equally be applied to any culture, including his own.
