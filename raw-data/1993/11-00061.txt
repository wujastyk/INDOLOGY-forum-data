Subject: 22 YEARS MISSIONARY WORK

          Would whoever contacted me  a couple of months ago about the book 
          Abbs, John,  22  YEARS  OF MISSIONARY WORK  IN TRAVANCORE, please 
          contact  me  at  my  email address  below,  not  via  CONSALD  or 
          INDOLOGY?  I have located two libraries that have it.
