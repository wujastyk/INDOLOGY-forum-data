Because Takao Hayashi has some trouble in sending e-mail to Indology,
he asked me to transfer his reply.  I got this today through
a Japnese commercial e-mail network.   Michio YANO

Dear lovers of Indian magic squares,
 
  Sorry, but for me e-mails seem to take longer time than regular ones.
  I am sure that my knowledge about the history of Indian magic squares
is quite insufficient, and on the other hand I am not very sure about
what kind of information is needed by each researcher, but I hope the
following bibliographical information is amusing to those who are
interested in them.
  As Wujastyk guessed, Pingree told me before about the existence of
magic squares written on leaves of various Indian manuscripts, but
I did not ask him about their details because at that time I was
interested only in older ones.  Wujastyk's list will be valuable
for writing a whole history of Indian magic squares, and now I am
certainly interested in it.  I am also interested in Allen's collection
of "a large number of sources in print and MS in Sanskrit, Prakrit,
and vernaculars."
  I do not know exactly what is the magic hexagon talked about before
in this circle, but there is a hexagonal formation of the first 48
natural numbers with the constant sum 98 in the last chapter (called
bhadraga\nita) of N\ar\aya\na's Ga\nitakaumud\i (A.D. 1356), which
mathematically treats magic squares as well as magic figures of various
shapes in a quite general manner.
