I'd appreciate pointers/help with a couple of things I've wanted to track down
for a while:

1. Is there any published genealogy/lineology, albeit incomplete and fragmented,
of the characters in Indian mythology?

2. Are there any English descriptions/sketches of the metallic
ornamentation/armor worn by men in ancient India in the upper arms and chest?

Thanks,
Raj Sehgal
