I've just arranged for a list of such projects to be emailed
to INDOLOGY.  I hope you won't find it too long.  It contains
information from all over the world about what Sanskrit texts
are available in machine-readable form.

The list is derived from the new gopher service on the topic
of machine-readable text projects, which is at guvax.georgetown.edu.
If you don't have a gopher client ... get one (ho ho ho!) ... but
you can contact the Georgetown information by ordinary ftp to 
the same address.  (You just don't get the same overview and 
ease of access.)
