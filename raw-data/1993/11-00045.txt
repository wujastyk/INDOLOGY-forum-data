But still, anybody can subscribe to the list.

It is possible to filter out messages if it contains one or more 
occurances of certain strings, such as:

1.  Konrad Elst
2.  P.N. Oak
3.  Subhash Kak
4.  Negationism
5.  Golwalkar
6.  Babri
7.  Ram Janambhumi

And so on...

If you went to Madras, it should have been butter-milk and rice, rather 
than chapatti and ghee!  In any case, I would be very grateful if you 
care to summarise your experience in Madras.  It would certainly be a 
refreshing change from the usual shop talk one sees here.  

  Incidentally, I am glad that you found out that `some middle-class 
Indians are actively forming groups' to counter communalism.  The fact 
is, there always were groups of individuals who faught communalism, and 
sometimes paid for their conviction with their lives.  There are many 
grassroots organisations whose works are seldom reported in New York 
Times, but they do exist.  I am sorry if all this has nothing to do 
with Panini and Truetype Devnagari fonts, but I hope you will 
understand the anguish one has to go through when one sees one country 
literally torn apart by a bunch of... [I daren't write anymore]
