Subject: MARATHI ZOOL. BOOKS OFFERED

          Would any library like  the following Marathi books which I  will 
          donate if I get an acknowledgement for tax purposes: 
           
          Gokhale, Vi. Na. 
          Pakshi vijnana 
          Pune: Anatha Vidyarthi Grha Prakasana, 1967 
           
          Medhekara, Janardana Sankara 
          Kitaka-paricaya, Bhaga 1 la 
          Pune:Citrasala Presa, 1930 
           
          Kolhatakara, Balakrshna Sridhara 
          Kitaka-paricaya, Bhaga 2 la 
          Pune: Citrasala Presa, n.d. 
           
          Graba, Sailaja Rabarta 
          Maharashtratila vanyaprani 
          Mumbai: Maharashtra Rajya Sahita Samskrti Mandala, 1978. 
           
          I'd  give them  to  LOC  but  they  are outside the scope of  our 
          policies.  They  might  be  of  some  use  in  language teaching, 
          however.
