Ecological Linguistics will release later this fall 8-bit script
systems for most of the Indic scripts on Macintosh, based either on the
ISCII-88 or the ISCII-91 standard.  We would like to use the code page
which will yield greatest compatibility with existing implementations,
whether on DOS or Mactintosh.  The ISCII-88 standard was used in the
16-bit Unicode and ISO10646, while the ISCII-91 standard is more recent
official India.  What is actual de facto dominant in India?  Anyone
replying, please specify the domains of different dominance.
 
Thanks for any help.
 
Lloyd Anderson
