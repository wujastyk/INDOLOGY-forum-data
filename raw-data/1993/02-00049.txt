Dear Indologists:

	I am forwarding this announcement FYI. We, at the Department of
South Asia Regional Studies, University of Pennsylvania, have launched a
reflector service for scholars of South Asia Studies. The message below
explains the service and the subscription procedure. Please be aware that
the subscribers to this list will have widely different disciplinary
interests.

Sincerely,

Richard J. Cohen
