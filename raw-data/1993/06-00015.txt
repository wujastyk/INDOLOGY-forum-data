Subject: Scorpions in Indian mythology and iconography
Message-ID: <161227015859.23782.6537784854691257505.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Amy Heller, a scholar of Tibetan art and iconography, would like to know
what role the scorpion plays in Indian art and mythology, both Buddhist
and non-Buddhist. You can send whatever information you may have to me,
and I will pass it on to her.
