  righto; virtually any environment ( ? except X-windows ?) which will
  support these outlines is going to be hostile to a pure CSX encoding
  (which explains why they are starting out as an expanded-CSX/ANSI hybrid.

  and, unfortunately, saying symbol (or OEM) torches the font for windows-
  truetype.  I suspect that until unicode (a 'real' character set---except it
  doesn't support CSX) arrives in force, anyone with odd character tastes
  is going to need to keep font manipulation utilities at hand because there
  will be no across the board solutions.
