But a word of warning: the Bodley on-line catalogue does *not* include all
the holdings. As with many other British libraries now going on-line,
retrospective catalogue conversion is a long, slow and expensive process.
The lack of an entry does not mean the book is not in the library (of
course this is only really relevant to those who wish to use the library in
person).
