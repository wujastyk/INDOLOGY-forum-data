Subject: MAGIC SQUARES

          To  all  who responded to  my messages of  last month about magic 
          squares, 
           
             Thank you very much for your assistance.  I  will try  to type 
          up  my bibliographies on  the  subject, starting  with  the  most 
          important categories of  items,  and  adding  the  new  citations 
          people have so kindly sent, and will advertise their availability 
          via the network.  Unfortunately I  am not enough of  a hacker yet 
          to make them available online but I will be able to send them out 
          on diskettes or paper.
