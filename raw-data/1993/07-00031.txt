If anyone could inform me of the current postal or email addresses
for Claus Oetke or Karin Preisendanz, I would be most grateful. I
have heard that Oetke is at University of Stockholm and that Preisendanz
is back at Hamburg, but my informants were not certain when these moves
would take effect. Any accurate information will be gratefully received.
