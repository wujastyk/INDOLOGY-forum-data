Well, like Alex Passi -- or is that Giuseppe, or is it Carlo Della Casa --
Phyllis uses an email address with another name (her husband's actually):

   Phyllis Granoff <shinohar at sscvax.cis.mcmaster.ca>

And in this guise I believe she does listen to INDOLOGY. (Easy to check:
for a list of all members, send the message "review indology" to the
address "listserv at liverpool.ac.uk".)
