Allen, 
  
I subscribed to CURRENTS at the end of July but have not received any 
mail from it since. 
  
Below I'm appending its "welcome" file.

Subj:   Your subscription to list CURRENTS 
  
Dear networker, 
  
  Your subscription to  list CURRENTS (South Asian News  and Culture Electronic 
Magazine) has been accepted. 
  
  You may leave the list at any time by sending a "SIGNOFF CURRENTS" command to 
LISTSERV at PCCVM.BITNET. Please  note that this command  must NOT be sent  to the 
list address (CURRENTS at PCCVM) but to the LISTSERV address (LISTSERV at PCCVM). 
  
  The  amount of  acknowledgement  you  wish to  receive  from  this list  upon 
completion of a  mailing operation can be  changed by means of  a "SET CURRENTS 
option" command,  where "option"  may be  either "ACK"  (mail acknowledgement), 
"MSGACK" (interactive messages only) or "NOACK". 
  
  Please note that it is presently  possible for other people to determine that 
you are signed  up to the list  through the use of the  "REVIEW" command, which 
returns the network address and name of all the subscribers. If you do not wish 
your name to be available to others in this fashion, just issue a "SET CURRENTS 
CONCEAL" command. 
  
  More information on LISTSERV commands can  be found in the LISTSERV reference 
card,  which  you  can  retrieve  by  sending  an  "INFO  REFCARD"  command  to 
LISTSERV at PCCVM.BITNET. 
  
Virtually, 
  
   The LISTSERV management
