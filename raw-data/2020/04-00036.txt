Subject: [INDOLOGY] English-sanskrit grammatical terms list or book

Dear list members,
Does anyone have or know of books or resources that relate western grammatical terms for sanskrit to their sanskrit equivalents . Something like Abhyankar's Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, but in the reverse direction, english to sanskrit.

Thanks,Harry Spier
