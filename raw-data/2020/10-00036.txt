This is a simple case of vedic sandhi, which everyone could easily look up
themselves in any grammar:


-*?n* before vowels is replaced by ? *??* (= *?*+Anun?sika)

So,* s?rg?n iva* results in *s?rg?**?* *i**va* (= *s?rg?*[+ Anun?sika] *iva*
)



A glance into the Padap??ha of your quote shows that ?ba?a'v?(gum)?
actually terminates in ?*v?n*, not in ?*m* (as in the cited cases of ?
*bhy?m*). The present *n*-sound is replaced by Anun?sika before the initial *u-
*of *uta*, hence the ?*gum*? of the reciters.



Regards,

WS
