Dear all,

Just to comment quickly, though I haven?t studied the Vajras?c? in any depth, the same passage that Vincent highlighted, naming the Vedas, Grammarians, et al. is also the one that caught my attention, especially the mention of M?m??sikas. As far as I can tell, while the others do get mentioned in Chinese translations of Buddhist texts, the only text preserved in Chinese that mentions M?m??sikas is Xuanzang?s translation of Bh?viveka?s Praj??prad?pa, which mentions them twice in close proximity:

????????13?22 ????????????????????????[1]????????????????????????(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, b15-17)
[1]???????
[1]???????
?Again there are the non-Buddhist (t?rthika) M?m?msikas who say: ?What is said by Buddhists In the twelve divisions of the their s?tras (canon), is that no person is omniscient, because they are conditioned (sa?sk?ra), just as is stated in treatises by the Vai?e?ikas, and so on.?

????????13?22 ??????????????????????(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, c5-6)
?This like the non-Buddhist M?m?msikas who imagine that the Word of the Vedas is eternal.?

I have found no other mention of M?m??s? in any other Chinese sources (if anyone has information on discussions I might have missed, please let me know). Bh?viveka, of course, devoted an entire chapter in his Madhyamakah?daya to M?m??s?, but his description of their doctrines suggests they differed in several ways from the versions we are more familiar with post Pr?bh?kara and Kum?rila. It is the latter?s ?lokavarttika, of course, that made M?m??s? hard to ignore for subsequent Buddhists.

Harivarman?s Tattvasiddhi (translated by Kum?raj?va at the beginning of the 5th c) identifies (among others) Vai?e?ika, S??khya, Ny?ya, and Jains as p?rvapak?ins. More generally in Buddhist literature preserved in Chinese prior to the middle of the seventh century, the most commonly cited opponents are Vai?e?ika and S??khya. Ny?ya is mentioned infrequently, as are Jains.

As for the pram??a issue mentioned by Matthew, the Vajras?r? verse identifies what serve as authorities for non-Buddhists (the following verse turns to lineage):

ved?? pram??a? sm?taya? pram??a? dharm?rthayukta? vacana? pram??am |
yasya pram??a? na bhavetpram??a? kastasya kury?dvacana? pram??am || 2 ||

Which are more or less equivalent to ?ruti, sm?ti, and ?pti-pram??a, and analogous to ?scripture and reason? (?gama, yukti) that was the established criteria for validity for Buddhists, even into the pram??av?da era. And, as I wrote elsewhere:

"Prama?n?a-theory rst appears in the eleventh chapter of the first part (Su?tra-stha?na) of the CS [Caraka-sa?hit?]. Here the CS intriguingly proposes, along with the three prama?n?as one would expect (perception, inference, and authori- tative testimony), a fourth not found anywhere else: synthetic inductive reasoning (yukta-prama?n?a). Discussion of prama?n?a occurs in two other parts of the CS: part 3, Vima?na-stha?na, chap. 4 and chap. 8, but the unique yukta-prama?n?a is absent from those discussions, a sign of the strati ed nature of the text.?

So a yukta pram??a suggest to me a possibly early date for that category.

Has anyone considered whether it is possible that the verses may have been written by A?vagho?a or someone relatively early while the prose exposition may have been added by a later hand?

Manu ? which may be the reason for Patrick?s query. It is well known that the Vajras?c? attributes several verses to Manu that cannot be traced in the extant M?navadharma??stra (if I remember well, this is the reason why some scholars tentatively attributed them to a lost M?nava Dharmas?tra). Whatever the case may be, we might perhaps agree that the Vajras?c? is unlikely to have been composed before the 3rd-4th century CE. I am inclined to believe that it is even younger.

> As you know, A?vagho?a directed some arguments against the Brahmanical understanding of the caste-classes in one of his dramas, the ??riputraprakara?a/?aradvat?putraprakara?a, several fragments of which have been preserved in Central Asian manuscripts and edited by Heinrich L?ders around 1910. It is thus plausible that A?vagho?a dedicated an individual treatise to this topic. The style, the method and the philosophical ressources of the Vajras?c?, however, are very different from the ones we know from A?vagho?a?s genuine works, and may presuppose Buddhist works such as the ??rd?lakar??vad?na if not Kum?ral?ta?s Kalpan?ma??itik? D????ntapa?kti?. Even if I am not aware of any convincing argument against the attribution of the Vajras?c? to A?vagho?a, I have always regarded the following statement as anachronistic: d??yante ca kvacic ch?dr? api vedavy?kara?am?m??s?s??khyavai?e?ikanagn?*j?vik?disarva??str?rthavida? /. ?And one observes in some cases that even ??dras know the meaning of all ??stras such as the Veda, Grammar, M?m??s?, S??khya, Vai?e?ika as well as [those of] the Jainas and the ?j?vikas.? (*-nagn?- em. : lagn?- Ed.) Although such a list is not per se impossible in A?vagho?a?s time, i.e., although most of its individual elements could have been known around 100 CE, I do not believe that such an enumeration would have been possible, as a doxographic statement, at that time, and even less so under A?vagho?a's "pen." (The absence of the Ny?ya from the list is intriguing.)
> Another element possibly deserving some consideration is the Sanskrit colophon in which A?vagho?a is characterized as siddh?c?rya (k?tir iya? siddh?c?ry??vagho?ap?d?n?m iti), an expression the exact meaning of which remains somewhat unclear to me.

As you no doubt know, the Chinese translation is late - 10th c. if I recall correctly - and is attributed to DharmakIrti. I rather doubt that the true authorship can be established, given the available evidence. The emphasis on pramANa seems to suggest that it was written during the second half of the first millennium, not much before. But the way in which pramANa is used there does not resonate closely with the Buddhist pramANa school. The precise milieu in which it was composed remains a puzzle (at least to me!).
