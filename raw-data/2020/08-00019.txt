Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have access to the journal in which this article is 
contained, even though it is outside the rune of Indological journals?? 
If so, I should be very grateful for a PDF of it.

Sioris, George A. 2002-3:?The Ramayana in Japanese literature?, in 
/Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan (Tokyo)/ 4th series, 17: 
27-49.

Best wishes

John
