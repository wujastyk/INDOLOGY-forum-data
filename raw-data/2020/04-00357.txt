This is really in the *Indian Journal of History of Science* (published by
INSA).  Should be downloadable from http://www.insa.nic.in but the server
is down as I write this email.  You might be able to get it from the
snapshot at the Wayback Machine
<https://web.archive.org/web/20190812060901/http://insa.nic.in/UI/journaldetails.aspx?AID=Mw==>.


In general, with IJHS articles, you can just do a google search for the
title and you'll get a PDF returned.  Google says the article you're after
is found here:
https://www.insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol03_1_2_BDash.pdf
.

Best,
