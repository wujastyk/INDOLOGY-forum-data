Dear Alakendu,
That all depends on which texts you consider to be authentic to Nagarjuna. He mentions two bodies (the dharmakaya and the rupakaya (presumably = nirmanakaya) in the Ratnavali chapter 3 verses 10-12. He also mentions the Dharmakaya in the Dharmadhatustotra and some of the other hymns. I don't think he was aware of the Sambhogakaya, but if you want to admit the authenticity of the Kayatrayastotranama then he was.
For a good discussion of the hymns ascribed to Nagarjuna and the issues around their authenticity, see Drasko Mitrikeski's 2008 dissertation from the University of Sydney.

Be well,
-j

Respected Scholars,
About the 3 kayas in Buddhism, namely-Nirmana Kaya, Dharma Kaya, Sambhoga Kaya, I would prefer a question, as to whether they are post -Nagarjuna or framed by Nagarjuna himself?
May I kindly be enlightened on this issue.

Alakendu Das.
