Subject: [INDOLOGY] Metrical inconsistencies and tradition

I am extremely reticent to join a discussion of metrics with specialists,
but I might just dare to mention that in Buddhist texts the matter has been
much discussed, especially in light of the clear tendency to transfer
Middle Indic texts to Sanskrit, with the result that sometimes lines are
entirely rewritten while at other times it would appear, as Roland says,
that license is found. In a small paper on the so-called *K??yapaparivarta'*s
verses, I observed the following:  " in the KP there are, in the roughly
600 lines amenable to examination, 31 cases in which the cluster pr does
not make position, that is, in which a short vowel standing before the
cluster pr must be read as metrically short..." I also tabulated the cases
with other clusters.
The whole paper is available here:

Very best, Jonathan
