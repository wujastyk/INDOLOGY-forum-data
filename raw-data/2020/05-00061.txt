Dear Indologists,

 

I would appreciate if anyone could share a pdf of the following article:

SHULMAN, David. 2007. ?How to Bring Goddess into Being Through Viable Sounds,? in S. La Porta and D. Shulman (ed.) 2007. The Poetics of Grammar and the Metaphysics of Sound and Sign. Leiden: Brill, pp. 305-341. 

Thank you in advance.

Regards,

Palaniappan
