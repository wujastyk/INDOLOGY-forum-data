Your student should be aware that Tucci?s edition and its various Devanagari successors - Vaidya?s edition etc. - are very much inferior to Hahn?s superb work on this text. In this case, the edition you are using makes a very great difference.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Text request: Nagarjuna's Ratnavali (Devanagari script)

On behalf of a student, I was wondering if any of you might have a PDF of the Sanskrit edition of N?g?rjuna's Ratn?val? published in Varanasi by Bharatiya Vidya Samsthana in 2003, edited by Avadhe?a Kum?ra Caube:
Ratn?val? / ?ryan?g?rjuna viracit? ; s?nvaya "Vimal?" Hind?vy?khy?sahit? ; samp?daka? vy?khy?k?ra?ca Avadhe?a Kum?ra Caube.
If it is not available electronically, perhaps someone knows where I could order a physical copy?

I am aware of the Indica et Tibetica Verlag 1982 edition of this work from Michael Hahn, but if I am not mistaken that edition was published in Latin script. My student requires the text in Devanagari.

Thanks very much!

Andrew
