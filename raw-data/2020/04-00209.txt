That indeed is included in my remark "[n]othing really good comes from 
such publications". That article reminds me of a pa??ita (no, I will not 
say who) who told me that he wanted to use the computers in his 
institution to show that Vi?i???dvaita is the one true, correct style of 
Ved?nta philosophy. This sort of talk turns away people who would like 
to be seriously interested in Indian philosophy.

Meanwhile the modern myth of 'Sanskrit as the ideal computer language' 
(instead of the usefulness of ancient Indian theories of language, as 
Briggs wrote -- quoted in the article, and then? how shall we call it: 
'creatively re-interpreted'?) seems to be so firmly entrenched in 
certain circles that it is beyond criticism. Criticizing it is like 
criticizing Donald Trump: the believers will vilify the critic, the 
popularity of the myth will be strengthened, and the crazy caravan moves 
on.
