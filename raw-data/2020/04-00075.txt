Professor Jha's citation from Mamma?a's K?vyaprak??a calling the usage *bh?ti
padma? sarovare *was also on my mind.  Clearly, he knew that some poets
used *padma *in masculine, but considered it to be a *do?a.  *If we
discount Mamma?a's value judgment, his statement probably means something
like this: the neuter usage of *padma* is the mainstream usage, while the
masculine usage is marginal.  This is something like
Kiparsky's interpretation of P??ini's term *vibh???* referring to marginal
usages.  On the other hand, the Amarako?a says: *v? pu?si padmam nalinam *etc.
indicating that Amara knew the alternating genders and didn't see any
problem.  So we have Mamma?a on one side and Amara on the other side.  An
interesting situation indeed.  ???? ?????????? ??: ?????????
