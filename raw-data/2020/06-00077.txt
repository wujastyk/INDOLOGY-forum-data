Dear list members,

Can anyone identify the meter of the gop?-g?tam (Bh?gavata X, chapter 31).
See this link: https://iskcondesiretree.com/page/gopi-gita

It is 11 syllable's per line but as far as I can see it is different from
the 11 syllable metres in Apte's dictionaries appendix.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
