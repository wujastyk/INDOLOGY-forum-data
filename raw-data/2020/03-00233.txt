If you do a search for these terms you will find what little is known about it. I assume that the Tibetan spelling is rlung sgom, where rlung means pr??a (or v?yu), and sgom means meditation or contemplation or cultivation (bh?van?).

Among the actual yogic practitioners, the separation between Hinduism and Buddhism is not always so clear cut (the same is often true with Islamic fakirs and Sikhs as well).

It has an interesting paradiddle-like ratio of inhalation/exhalation that supposedly can extend one's ability to stealthily run across mountains at night, as long as the individual breathed in this complicated way while running... I've recently tried it...I guess, I need more practice.

Interestingly, a re-orientalized and imagined mythical Ninja culture is framed as being able to help reduce stress and tension, make people fitter, run for the train... and generally more able to endure more of life's problems, and, also have a transformative potential related to the twins of transglobal yoga's popularity: 1) accumulate power(s) and 2) achieve moral reformation.
