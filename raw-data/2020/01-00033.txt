Subject: [INDOLOGY] Texts about translators and translation?
Message-ID: <CACcR+FBDpe-bztM2cXmQEYghmXiMC-GByEg2P=xyX4TbqaaEPg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Prof Nataliya Yanchevskaya,

*A propos* your recent mail on texts on translation in Sanskrit, here is
some information that may be relevant.

The term ?*anuv**?**da*? currently used in the Indian languages for
translation, had a wider remit in  ??stra jargon, and was use for scholarly
paraphrase or citation, and the denotation of translation for  ?*anuv**?*
*da*? is a semantic extension of this idea of paraphrase. Prof Radhavallabh
Tripathi [currently at the Bhandarkar Institute, Pune]has recently written
a treatise on the expanded notion of ?anuv?da? covering paraphrase,
citation as well as translation. His book is in the sutra-bh??ya style,
with an auto-commentary, as well as auxiliary ?parikara-?loka-s?. I had
occasion to see a partial draft of the book. You may contact Prof Tripathi
if his book is of interest. Drop me a personal mail if you need his contact
details.

I noticed that other members of the list had pointed out a few papers that
reflect upon translation *from* Sanskrit. I add some more to that list.



Damrosch, D., 2008. What could a message mean to a cloud? Kalidasa travels
West. *Translation Studies*, *1*(1), pp.41-54.

Gopinathan, G., 2000. Ancient Indian theories of translation. *Beyond the
Western tradition*, pp.165-173.



Nelson, B., 2011. Beyond free and literal: Translating a Buddhist text
(Bodhicaryavatarapanjika) from Sanskrit. *Journal of the Oriental Society
of Australia, The*, *43*, p.83.

O'Flaherty, W.D., 1971. A New Approach to Sanskrit Translation. *Mahfil*,
*7*(3/4), pp.129-141.



Ramanujan, A.K., 1991. Three hundred Ramayanas: Five examples and three
thoughts on translation. *Many Ramayanas: The diversity of a narrative
tradition in South Asia*, pp.22-49.
