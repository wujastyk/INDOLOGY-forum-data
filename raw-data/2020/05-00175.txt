Dear colleagues,

I noticed this nomination with some excitement:
http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/laghukalacakratantrarajatika-vimalaprabha/

Does anybody happen to know what became of this nomination and, more
importantly, whether this means that colour images are available?

Some years ago I tried my luck at the ASB, but my request was refused on
the grounds that "the bundle broke in half". Not sure what that meant.

I'd be very grateful for any information.

Best wishes,
Peter Szanto
