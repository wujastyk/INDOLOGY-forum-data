Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF Request: Vajracharya's "Crown Jewel of Newar Painting"
Message-ID: <7F69C792-DDC2-487E-980A-6101BCBA7A45@berkeley.edu>

Dear all,

Would anyone happen to have a pdf of Gautama Vajracharya?s ?Crown Jewel of Newar Painting: Discovery of a Masterpiece,? which is found in Pratapaditya Pal?s Nepal: Old Images, New Insights? I actually have a copy myself, but it's inaccessible to me at the moment. 

Many thanks in advance,

Ryan
