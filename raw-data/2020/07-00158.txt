Dear Dagmar,

Chapter 8 of Andrew Nicholson's *Unifying Hinduism, *entitled "Doxography,
classificatory schemes, and contested histories," has a useful discussion
of colonial-era receptions of *Sarvadar?anasa?graha, *especially in the
section "M?dhava and the influence of advaita doxography" (pp. 158ff.)

All the best,
Eric
