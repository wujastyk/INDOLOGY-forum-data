This is amazing, thank you Harry!
I looked for some way to say thank you on the website, but I found no
contact information. If anyone knows... (I do not have permission to
post to the google group which you referenced)
(Further, although it is perhaps churlish to ask... if there were a
way to link between the often very complex abbreviations of catalogue
references under each text title to the catalogue of origin, that
would be fantastic. But even as it is, it's a wonderful resource!!
