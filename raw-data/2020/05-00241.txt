Subject: [INDOLOGY] looking for horses
Message-ID: <faa0ef35aaba422184be95d05cbc6157@marianopolis.edu>

Dear colleagues,

I am looking for a book chapter that I am hoping someone might have digitized. It is the following:

Leshnik, Lawrence S. ?The Horse in India.? In Symbols, Subsistence and Social Structure: The Ecology of Man and Animal in South Asia, edited by Franklin C. Southworth. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, South Asia Regional Studies, 1977-78.

I am also wondering if anyone knows of research focused on the horse, Uccai??ravas, that emerged from the churning of the ocean.

With best wishes,

Vanessa R. Sasson
