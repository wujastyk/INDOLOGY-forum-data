Thank you Dominik,

In light of your reply, I'm posting this which was sent to me off-list
-------------------------------
---------------------------------
I found the following entry in B?htlingk's small Petersburg Dictionary:

"argal?stuti f. und argal?stotra n. Bez. eines dem Dev?m?h?tmya
vorangehenden und dasselbe verschliessenden Lobgesanges" (= Name of a
hymn of praise preceding the Dev?m?h?tmya and sealing the same).

As you know, argala means "bolt, latch".
----------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------


Argala and k?laka are synonymous, and from this entry in
Boethlink-Roth  it appears
that  the  argal?stotra has the same relationship to the  Dev?m?h?tmya
as a k?laka
syllable to a stotra.  I.e.in the preamble of many stotras 6 items are
listed, one of which is  the k?laka. syllable.  I.e. ??i, chandas, devat?,
bija, ?akti and k?laka.

But for over 10 years I've been trying to find information on what exactly,
in the context of this kind of preamble of a stotra, is the meaning of the
k?laka.syllable.

a) Would it be possible for a french speaking indologist to translate the
entry for k?laka (which I've attached) in the tantrikabhidanakosa.

b) Other than this entry in TAK does anyone know of any articles on  k?laka
in this context.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
