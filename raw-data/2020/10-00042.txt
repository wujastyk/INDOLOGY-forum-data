Dear Paolo,
yes, there is the case of a yogi alchemist active at the court of the Ilkhanid ruler Argun in Iran, that I mention in this article:
"Ras?yana and Rasa??stra in the Persian Medical Culture of South Asia", History of Science in South Asia, 7, 2019, pp. 1-41?Best regards,
Fabrizio

 Dear Fabrizio,
thank you very much for pointing me out Mir Mahmud. I am far more interested in biographies than in alchemy. It should be relevant for my purposes also to know if we have any document (hopefully in Latin) regarding Indian alchemists in European royal courts or in the Middle-East and North Africa. 

Sincerely,Paolo

Dear Paolo,
there is the case of Mir Mahmud (d. 1689), a Sufi?master of the Ni'matullahi order who migrated from Iraq to the Hyderabad in the Deccan and to which alchemical knowledge is attributed in hagiographical sources. On Mir Mahmud you can check my articles which however do not focus?on alchemy:
?? propos du renouveau ni?matull?h?. Le centre de Hyderabad au cours de la premi?re modernit??, Studia Iranica, 42, 2013, p. 91-118.

? The mujaddid and the majdh?b. Sh?h ?Al? Ri?? (d. 1215/1801) and the Different Narratives of the Ni?mat All?h? Renewal ?, in Denis Hermann ? Mathieu Terrier, eds., Shi?i Sufism in Modern Times, London, I. B. Tauris ? Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2020, pp. 157-174.

I also mention several Sufis expert in alchemy who however were Indian Muslims, in my work?Soufisme, religion et m?decine en Islam indien. Paris, Karthala, 2010.
All the best,
Fabrizio?

 Dear Dagmar,
Yes, I did. But I would like to understand if any European or Arabic alchemist went to South Asia or had any contact with South Asian alchemists or royal courts in pre-Modern time.
Best wishes, 
Paolo

Dear?Paolo,You may have heard of Marco Polo's description of alchemists in India and also of Al Biruni describing ras?yana.?Both accounts are featured in David White's The Alchemical Body. There is also the story of Siddha Iramatevar/ Yakoppu visiting Mecca.?I don't know of any journeys by European or Arabic alchemists to the Indian subcontinent. However, Fabrizio Speziale may know something about that: He has been working on Persian sources on alchemy and iatrochemistry and these may feature accounts of visiting or at least corresponding alchemists.?Very best wishes,Dagmar
