Respected scholars,
If anyone of you is aware about a PDF scan of the following work, or is
willing to scan it afresh for me, I would appreciate it.

Trivandrum Sanskrit Series XLIII
Amarakosha with Amarakoshodghatana and Tikasarvasva.

I am aware about the following archive.org file, but it is not amenable to
OCRing.

A separate scan if any exists would be helpful.
