Subject: [INDOLOGY] Metrical inconsistencies and tradition

Perhaps a short note on the modified ?G?yatr?s? in the 
Maitr?ya??-Sa?hit?: the creators of these verses simply inserted a 
certain deity without too much regard for metre. The non-adjusted 
accentuation perhaps also shows that the ?G?yatr?s? in this text are 
more pieced together than composed anew (/pracod?y?t/ is still accented, 
even though it's now the verb of a main clause ? or is there another 
explanation?). I wonder whether and where they are actually called 
G?yatr?s?

In any case, I think it's time for an anti-Corona G?yatr? ? unbrushed 
and with wrong accents as it should be:

/m?? savit?r dvi???ya? /
/kovidavi??? dh?mahi/ /
/t?t t? dev? 'pacod?y?t/ //

?May we not obtain the malevolent
poison for scholars from Savit?.
The god shall rather drive it away!?


Best regards,
D Haas
