Owing to the kindness of a number of well-intentioned colleagues (Lubomir
Ondracka, Peter Wyzlic, David Smith, Christophe Vielle and an old
acquaintance who wishes to remain anonymous) it is my pleasure to pass on
the information they have provided me with on the two titles I had been
unable to trace while writing my earlier mail:

A PDF of Jagann?tha T?rtha's D?pik? on Madhva's BS?Bh??ya is available from
GRETIL:

http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil_elib/BBs900__Badarayana_Brahmasutra_COMM_Madhva-Bhasya_Jagannatha-Dipika.pdf
The quoted passage will be found on p. 319 of this edition.

respositories:
