Dear list,

I'm looking for bibliographical details (i.e. pdf of or link to) of the
following works to find out the reference to   Bella?ko??a R?mar?yakavi,
1875-1914, there.


1.  Ny?yacandrik? of  ?nandap?r?amun?ndra, Government Oriental Manuscripts
Library, Madras, 1959.

2. New Catalogus Catalogorum, Vol. I, ed. V. Raghavan, University of
Madras, 1968 (I'm not sure if Vol. I has reference to R?mar?yakav, or in
any other volume).


With regards,
Niranjan
