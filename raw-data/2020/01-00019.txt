Also the  d?rgha-svarita is used in chanting books of the Rudram but on
looking at a few different editions of the  taitir?ya-sa?hit? (Sastri and
Mahadeva, Sntakke and Dharmadhikari, and Satvalekar, as far as I can
see d?rgha-svarita
isn't used in these editions (most of these are multi-volume editions so
its possible its used in other volumes than those I looked at).

Does anyone know of any editions of the taitir?ya-sa?hit? where  d?rgha-svarita
is used?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
