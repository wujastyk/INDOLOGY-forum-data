Message-ID: <AM6PR10MB2422A2B442E16392F863B5D8A5610@AM6PR10MB2422.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear colleagues,

Allow me to draw the attention of those among you interested in the use of TEI and in issues of romanization to the following two publications of the DHARMA project:

DHARMA Encoding Guide for Diplomatic Editions
https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/DHARMA/halshs-02888186

DHARMA Transliteration Guide
https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/DHARMA/halshs-02272407

A companion Encoding Guide for Critical Editions is currently being drafted.

Best wishes,
