Friends:

With apologies for cross posting, I am delighted to inform you of the publication of the book:

Y?j?avalkya Dharma??stra: The Textual History of a Hindu Legal Code (Delhi: Primus Books)

http://primusbooks.com/yajnavalkya-dharmsastra-the-textual-history-of-a-hindu-legal-code/#

This is a companion volume to my book: Yajnavalkya: A Treatise on Dharma in the Murty Classical Library of India (Harvard: 2019), which contained only the text and translation.

The current volume contains the critically edited text together with the critical apparatus, detailed statements about editorial principles and the criteria for text selection, a concordance, and a p?da index.

With thanks and best wishes,


Patrick
