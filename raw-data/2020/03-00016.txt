Subject: [INDOLOGY] Survey about digital tools and resources
Message-ID: <CAANHO16j1V+1_BK+8q=-P+vw0ja_VAzgZx4pUziZ9YzKG18E4A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I have put together a brief survey about the use of digital tools and
resources (broadly defined) in South Asian studies (also broadly defined):

https://forms.gle/4e7MToRciYCqV2Rg7

I hope that a few of you will find the time to respond to it. Of course
I'll be happy to report the results back to this list, and please also feel
free to contact me off-list with any further thoughts or questions about it.

Andrew
