Thanks to Kengo and Elliot for follow-up advice. I have updated to MacTex2020, but my Velthuis-formatted dn files are still generating some errors. I?ll try to sort them out off list!

Best,
Tim

Dear Tim and members of the list,

A bit late response but getting back to the original point? and just in case there still is a need to run devnag on a Mac?

If you have the latest MacTeX that corresponds to TeXLive 2020, it installs the binary of devnag as part of the package. /usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-darwin/devnag

It shows up as /Library/TeX/texbin/devnag. So, as long as /Library/TeX/texbin is in your PATH, it will run.

I discovered this by chance a few weeks ago, to my surprise. It works fine on Catalina.

Best,
