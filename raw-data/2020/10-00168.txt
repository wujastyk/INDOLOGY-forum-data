Thank you very much!!! You can imagine how it trickles down to Tamilnadu, especially to people who don?t know Sanskrit and who hate Hinduism, brahmins, ? and so on. People who hate brahmins use Manusmriti and similar texts as their tools in their politics. I wonder how many of them could read these original texts in Sanskrit. Depending upon the translations, everyone?s understanding and interpretation may vary. It is truly a sad scene. 

Thanks and Regards,
V.S. Rajam

However, the misogyny of the text is unmistakeable (though hardly out of line with nearly all texts in antiquity) and 9.14-15 seem to (mis-)characterize females generally. However, I would add is that pau??calya here denotes lust or an innate sexual desire for men. While it may sometimes refer to a prostitute, the primary meaning of ?prostitute? (at least in American English) is one who has sex in exchange for money. Granted, there are other meanings, but the money piece matters, I think, because the condemnation in Manu is about women?s temptations and attributed inclinations toward adultery, not prostitution in a strict sense. The passage is exhorting husbands to control their wives (or, more deviously, keep women hyper-occupied, 9.10-12) in order to prevent their adultery. It then justifies this control on the false grounds of women?s innate lechery, fickleness, and general inconstancy.
