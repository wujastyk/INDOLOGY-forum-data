   - Coningham 2013, "The earliest Buddhist shrine"

      - Article about the 2013 finds, with Julia Shaw's response
      <http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/11/131125-buddha-birth-nepal-archaeology-science-lumbini-religion-history/>
      .
      - Gombrich 2013, "Recent discovery of "earliest Buddhist shrine? a
      sham?
      <http://tricycle.org/trikedaily/recent-discovery-earliest-buddhist-shrine-sham/>"



After studying Coningham 2013 carefully and the responses from Shaw and
Gombrich (which are informal but clear and damning), I no longer attend to
Coningham's publications.

Best,
Dominik
