Congratulations to Patrick !
A look at the list of the 2020 recipients in Section IV (Humanities and Arts) reveals that it includes at least two other specialists of Indian and, more broadly, Asian Studies : Paul V. Kiparsky, from Stanford University, whom I do not need to introduce to this audience, and Bernard Faure, from Columbia, a leading specialist of Chinese and Japanese Buddhism. Congratulations to them, too !
With kind regards,
Vincent

Dear Colleagues,

Professor Patrick Olivelle has just been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, among the new members for 2020. He is likely to be too modest to share the news with us, so I thought I would let his colleagues, students, friends and admirers know.

With warm congratulations to Professor Olivelle for this well-deserved honour,

Yours,

Ananya Vajpeyi.
