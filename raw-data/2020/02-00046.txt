Dear Colleagues?
(Apologies for cross-posting). As some of you may know, I?ve been working for the last few years on a monograph on the history of OM in early India. The scope of this project, covering some 2000 years from Veda through Tantra, has compelled me to work on texts and materials far afield from my training in Vedic studies. Along the way, I?ve greatly benefited from the expertise of colleagues working in other domains, including many members of this list. I?m grateful to those who have shared their research and ideas with me so far?
Now I?d like to reach out with another query. Having completed my basic research on OM in the Vedas, Dharma texts, Yoga texts, and Epics, I?m now delving into the Pur??as and Hindu Tantra. I hope that some of you can help me hone in on key material in these massive textual corpora. While recommendations on secondary literature would be useful, my priority is to collect passages from primary texts. My aim is not to be comprehensive, but rather to choose excerpts and case studies that give insights into how OM is used and interpreted in these traditions. So passages that either exemplify broad trends or represent notable exceptions are especially welcome. 

Please send any info to me off-list at finnian_moore-gerety at brown.edu <mailto:finnian_moore-gerety at brown.edu>. Thanks in advance!

Yours,
