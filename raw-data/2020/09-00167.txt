Subject: [INDOLOGY] MacDevnag on 64-bit systems

Dear Tim and members of the list,

A bit late response but getting back to the original point? and just in case there still is a need to run devnag on a Mac? 

If you have the latest MacTeX that corresponds to TeXLive 2020, it installs the binary of devnag as part of the package. /usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-darwin/devnag

It shows up as /Library/TeX/texbin/devnag. So, as long as /Library/TeX/texbin is in your PATH, it will run.

I discovered this by chance a few weeks ago, to my surprise. It works fine on Catalina.

Best,

I am going to appease them for now by upgrading to Mojave, which can run 32-bit (yes, I am an update laggard, still running [Low] Sierra!), but that is inevitably just a temporary fix.  I confess to being only semi-literate in LaTeX and XeLaTeX, so I may have missed a crucial new development.
