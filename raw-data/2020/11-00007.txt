Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bharatiya Itihasa Samshodhak Mandal, Pune
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeX=WG29BTzv0Y1Wuw3QOY+csCisD_DGyekgYausF72bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone in Pune and likely to visit the BISM any time?  Or do you have
contact details for the BISM?  I am interested in a manuscript that may be
there, but I don't know whom to write to or how to request a copy or
photograph.

The details of the MS are given at PanditProject
<https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108197/work>.

Many thanks,
Dominik
