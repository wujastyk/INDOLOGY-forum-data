Subject: [INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding

Note that (beside the fact that one of the actors of the film, Irrfan Khan, recently died) the blinding with acid is the technique  recommended in A? 4,10.13 
(Tokunaga's input on GRETIL)
KAZ04.10.13/ ??drasya br?hma?a.v?dino deva.dravyam avast??ato r?ja.dvi??am ?di?ato dvi.netra.bhedina? ca yoga.a?janena^andhatvam, a??a.?ato v? da??a? //

(tr. R. Shamasastry  https://archive.org/details/Arthasastra_English_Translation <https://archive.org/details/Arthasastra_English_Translation> )
When a Sudra calls himself a Brahman, or when any person 
steals the property of gods, conspires against the king, or destroys 
both the eyes of another, he shall either have his eyes destroyed by 
the application of poisonous ointment, or pay a fine of 800 panas.
(Sorry, I have not Olivelle's translation at hand)

> But that is not my main reason for responding. The reference to the use of a needle recalled a scene in Orhan Pamuk's novel Red set, not in India, but in Ottoman Turkey. Perhaps the practic e was rather widespread in earlier times.

My source is a representative of ? if I might say so ? ?Sanskrit literary realism?, namely Kavi ?r?vara, who depicts a technique of blinding in his R?jatara?gi?? as it was practised in Kashmir between c. AD 1472 and 1474.

It comes closer to the verbatim meaning of netra-utp??ana (?tearing out one?s eyes?), as they seem to have gouged out the eyes of the victim, to wit, Bahr?m Kh?n, pretender to the throne and uncle of the ruling Sultan Hassan:

> In preparation of a new edition and annotated translation of ?r?vara?s masterpiece I would like to ask if someone might be aware of any other source having preserved details of the techniques of blinding in India? My request does not concern the undisputed occurrence of netrotp??ana, but only the techniques, if known.
