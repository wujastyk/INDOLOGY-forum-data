Dear colleagues,

I am interested in the compound anyas?ra, of which I find only very few occurrences in the sources available to me.

One of them is ?abdakalpadruma, s.v. upap?takam: tat tu suvar?adravy?d anyas?radravy?pahara?am | devar?ipit???m ????odhanam 38.

Can anyone help me understand if the quotation here is from an original Sanskrit work, or is due to the compilers of the ?abdakalpadruma? The source reference at the end of the lemma leads me to the mega-lemma pr?ya?citta, where I lose track of anyas?radravy?pahara?am and devar?ipit???m ????odhanam.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
