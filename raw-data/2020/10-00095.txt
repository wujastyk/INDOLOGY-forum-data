Subject: [INDOLOGY] diacritical marks on Mac

HI Matthew
I use Catalina on a Macbook Pro. For Sanskrit diacritics I find EasyUnicode
added as a keyboard sorts out most diacritic challenges (thanks to Tom
Yarnell for originally pointing this out). On iOS devices you can create
your own diacritic shortcuts in the Keyboard Text Replacement feature.
Cheers
James
