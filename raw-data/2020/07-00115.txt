Dear Friends,

One of our doctoral students is looking for the following paper. Would
someone happen to have a PDF copy? I should be grateful if you can share a
copy with me.

Desai, F. A. ?The Story of Nala-Damayanti as told by Faidi and its
Comparison with the Original Sanskrit Version? *Journal of the Oriental
Institute**, *Baroda*,* 8, no. 1 and 2 (1958): pp. 81-96 and 183-196.


Thanks in advance.
