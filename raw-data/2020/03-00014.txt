Dear all,

for those interested in Vedic syntax: There is now a treebank of ~4,000
text lines from Vedic metrical and prose text; hopefully growing in the
future.

The paper describing the treebank, the treebank itself and additional
material such as syntactic labeler using (flat) deep learning can be
found here:

Best, Oliver
