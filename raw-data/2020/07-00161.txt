Dear colleagues,

I am posting this request for John Newman, who is currently not a member of the list. He is interested in the Sanskrit edition of Asa?ga?s Tattv?rtha chapter that appears in ???? [Takahashi K?ichi]. ????????????????????????????? : vastu ????????. Bibliotheca Indologica et Buddhologica 12, Tokyo: Sankibo press, 2005. The Sanskrit text should be on pp. 83-117 of that study of the concept of vastu in that chapter of the Bodhisattvabh?mi.

If someone could provide us with an e-version of the whole work or at least the Sanskrit edition, we would be grateful. I would like a copy as well. John can be reached at newman at ncf.edu <mailto:newman at ncf.edu> .

Thank you,
Dan
