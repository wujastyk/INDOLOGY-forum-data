"You get along with Henry?
?"Oh, sure thing," said Bunny, reared back in his chair. "We were roommates. Freshman year."?
"And you like him?"?
"Certainly, certainly. He's a hard fellow to live with though. Hates noise, hates company, hates mess. None of this brining your date back to the room to listen to a couple Art Pepper records, if you know what I'm trying to get at."?"I think he's sort of rude."?
Buddy shrugged. "That's his way. See, his mind doesn't work the same way yours and mine do. He's always up in the clouds with Plato or something. Works too hard, takes himself too seriously, studying Sanskrit and Coptic and those other nutty languages. Henry, I tell him, if you're going to waste your time learning something besides Greek -- that and the King's English are all I think a man needs, personally -- why don't you buy yourself some Berlitz records and brush up on your French. Find a little can-can girl or something. Voolay-voo coushay avec moi and all that."
"How many languages does he know?"
"I lost count. Seven or eight. He can read hieroglyphics."
"Wow."?Bunny shook his head fondly. "He's a genius, that boy. He could be a translator for the UN if he wanted to be."?
"Where's he from?"?
"Missouri."?

p. 356 also has a [not historically great] description of Buddhist Tantra.
