Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)
In-Reply-To: <DM6PR19MB2524217B9102461738B9CF30A0C00@DM6PR19MB2524.namprd19.prod.outlook.com>

 I notice that this post uses the term 'mayavada' in referring to Advaitins. This is appropriate in this context I suppose because it is offering an alternative perspective to Advaita.
But some of the Advaitins I have spoken to say that that is a term coined by their opponents and that it is inaccurate, even if it has been adopted by some ill-informed Advaitins to refer to themselves and become part of the popular speech. These Advaitins say that the emphasis should be on 'avidya' or 'mithya' rather than 'maya'.

I wonder if anyone has any comments about this or could point me to some publications that discuss it.
Note: I am interested in the scholarly discussion of these terms and the associated concepts, not in a discussion about which is the supreme realization. :-)

Best,
Dean

Inspired by Madhav Deshpande and with a long history of my polite confrontations with Advaitins I propose to write 100 lines.
I am a staunch Krishna rasika. Writing in English deprives my lines of the majesty of Sanskrit. However what English lacks in the melody and rhythms of Sanskrit it will hopefully make up in its rasa.

Wait O! Advaitin, before I accept your mayavada
Let me tarry a bit and enjoy the lotus face of Krishna.

Kind regards,
