>From my experience, there are a number of premodern Old Gujarati and Nepali & Newari translations (often quite hybridized) of ?ivad?sa's Vet?lapa?cavi??ati. On the latter, I can recommend very much a new essay by Felix Otter,  ?The Robber, the Demon, the Girl, and Her Lover: An Episode from the Newari Version of the Veta?lapan?cavi?s?ati? in Carmen Brandt & Hans Harder (eds): Wege durchs Labyrinth: Festschrift zu Ehren von Rahul Peter Das. Heidelberg; Berlin: CrossAsia-eBooks, 2020. DOI: https://doi.org/10.11588/xabooks.642.

He has made it available on his Academia.edu <http://academia.edu/> page here: https://uni-marburg.academia.edu/FelixOtter <https://uni-marburg.academia.edu/FelixOtter>
(On the Nepali, there is Theodore Riccardi?s equally excellent book)
