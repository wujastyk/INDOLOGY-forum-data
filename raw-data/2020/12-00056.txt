Subject: [INDOLOGY] A grammatical question
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzenykNDRd=aP-BP3MwKy14aANcy8mwSvhzZDJbiCC8XuQ@mail.gmail.com>

P??ini lists the root ?ru in the bh?-?di conjugation and then stipulates
the rule ?ruva? ?r? ca [3.1.74] that changes ?ru > ?r? and also prescribes
the substitution of the infix/vikara?a ?ap > ?nu.  Thus we get forms like
?r??oti.  The form outwardly looks similar to sunoti, but the root su is in
the 5th conjugation.  The question is why P??ini chose to list the root ?ru
in the first conjugation and then go through the additional effort of
prescribing the infix ?nu as an exception to the first conjugation.  The
commentary Tattvabodhin? on P.3.1.74 says the following: yadi ayam
?rudh?tu? sv?dau pa?hyeta tarhi cak?ro na kartavya iti l?ghavam ity ?hu?.
So, the author of the Tattvabodhin? feels that P??ini should have listed
the root ?ru in the 5th conjugation, and that would have been a more
economical path.  I would like to hear an explanation as to why P??ini may
have listed this root in the first conjugation.
