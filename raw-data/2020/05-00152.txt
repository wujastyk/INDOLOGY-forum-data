Dear colleagues,

Would anyone be able to help me obtain pdf of the following article, or (better) of the whole volume?

J.G. de Casparis, 'The use of Sanskrit in inscriptions of Indonesia and Malaysia', in: J.G. de Casparis (ed.), Sanskrit outside India, pp. 29-41. Leiden: Brill. [Panels of the Vllth World Sanskrit Conference 7.]

Thanks!

Arlo Griffiths
