Looks to be ?atapatha Br?hma?a 4.2.1.[27], part of a description of the ?Great Pressing? (Mah?bhi?ava) within a Soma offering. 

sa juhoti | sa pratham? sa?sk?tirvi?vav?r? sa prathamo varu?o mitro agni? sa
prathamo b?haspati?cikitv??stasm? indr?ya sutam?juhota sv?heti 

(from the GRETIL e-text). 

Eggeling?s translation from 1885: ?He offers with, ?This is the first consecration, assuring all boons; he is the first, Varu?a, Mitra, Agni ? he is the first, B?haspati, the wise: to that Indra offer ye the liquor, Hail!?. (vol 2, p. 285-6).


Best wishes,
