Dear listmembers,

anyone of you came probably across a description of someone? who is 
adorned with a /rattam?la/ "a red garland of flowers"
And: Where, at which part of the body, he wears this garland?
I found two quotations in J?takas: Here in each case it is a executioner 
(/vadhaka/, /coragh?taka/) who is adorned with a /rattam?la/.
The artists of the last centuries painted the executioner with a garland 
hanging around his neck or even across his upper body.
But there is another quotation, in the Vessantara-J?taka, where the 
Brahmin J?jaka is adorned ... /dv?su ka??esu ratta-m?l?/ ...= with a 
garland of flowers bound at each of his two ears.

I think a /rattam?la /original adorned the ears. But I need textual 
references.
Someone can help?

Thank you

Heiner
