Dear Indology members,

Apologies for crossposting, but I am happy to announce that the American Oriental Society is now on Twitter! Please follow @AmOrientalSoc (https://twitter.com/amorientalsoc) and feel free to publicize elsewhere as you see fit.

Also, it?s a good time to remind everyone that the 2021 AOS Annual Meeting will be on Zoom March 12-18th. Please submit your abstracts by October 15th:?https://www.americanorientalsociety.org/annual-meeting/call-for-papers/

See y?all on the Twittersphere.

Cheers,

Matt
