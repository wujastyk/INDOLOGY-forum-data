Yes, Prof. Watson. There is a difference, of course.

My focus was on the Sanskrit term and the possibility of that being in the
path of sources of the English term.

?tmas?k??tk?ra and ?tm?bh?va can be synonymous for Advaitins as you noted.

But for others , the two can be different.

Self as the 'Who am I ?' concept , can be an identity issue and we can take
self as the common axis for comparing and connecting the Sociological Self,
, the Psychological Self and the Spiritual Self, Aatman.

In fact, the discussions on Dehaatma braanti etc. are based on the
recognition that there are other answers than the spiritual Aatman to the
human enquiry of Who am I . All non-spiritual answers turn out to be
bhraanti relative to the ultimate validity of the spiritual answer of
Aatman . But they are valid in their own reference frames.
