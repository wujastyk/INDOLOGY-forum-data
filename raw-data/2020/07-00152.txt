Subject: [INDOLOGY] Navagraha worship in Tamil literature
Message-ID: <CABcuftQBRgfFQSRjZBzvxsAfMr8qwEfy30WG7FoOx1VrPDpLAw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I would be grateful for any reference to pre-modern Tamil literary texts
(or Sanskrit texts that originated from the Tamil-akam) that mention
Navagraha-worship and the worship of Saturn in particular.

Many thanks,

Ofer Peres.
