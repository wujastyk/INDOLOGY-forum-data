Subject: [INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses

I don't know what P??ini would have done, koro??/koron?, masculine or
feminine.  There are exceptions to the retroflexion rules even in single
words  [as ???????????? ? ??????. ? ??? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????
??????? ??????? ???????? ? ????? ???????????].  In any case, importing an
expression from a modern language into Sanskrit, one represents it as one
hears it around.  Around me here in San Jose, I don't hear the retroflex.
But either representation is fine with me.  In early Marathi writings, the
name of Mountstuart Elphinstone was written as ????? ??????????
??????????.  In more recent Marathi writings, I see ???? ????????
??????????, and the more Apabhramsha version was known as ?????? ?????. I
write ????????????.  No retroflexion there.
