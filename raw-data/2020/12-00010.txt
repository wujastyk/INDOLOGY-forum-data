Dear Indology list members,


Apologies for cross-posting.


Please find below our call for papers for the Spalding Symposium on Indian
Religions 2021.



*Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions*

*Call for papers: 2021 Symposium *

We invite proposals for papers for the 46th Spalding Symposium on Indian
Religions, which will be held *online*, on *23-25 April 2021*. Our purview
includes both religions of South Asian origin wherever in the world they
are being practised, and those of non- South Asian origin present within
South Asia. We welcome papers based upon all research methods, including
textual, historical, ethnographic, sociological and philosophical.


Presenters are allocated forty minutes for their paper and twenty
minutes for discussion. There is *no conference fee*, but all presenters
and attendees must register. Registration details will be released in the
new year. We also welcome proposals from doctoral students, who will be
allocated twenty minutes for their paper and ten minutes for discussion.


We are delighted to announce our keynote speakers:


   - Dr Jacqueline Suthren Hirst, who recently retired from Manchester
   University, UK
   - Prof. Oliver Freiberger of the University of Texas at Austin, USA
