'Sanskriti' in the sense of 'culture of a human group'  is a neologism
found in most contemporary Indian languages.

'Sanskriti'  in  the ancient particularly Vedic Sanskrit usages is a
synonym of or a word related to Sanskaarah which is making better =
bringing in the required effect (for the tradition, ritual, collective
convention of the group including linguistic convention etc.)

There are many such ancient Sanskrit terms whose contemporary understanding
landed into / lead to problems because of the same words being used as
neologisms in the contemporary Indian languages.

Itihaasa is another example.

Itihaasa is a contemporary word for history in many north Indian languages.

As a result, texts that are conventionally called intihaasa have been
viewed as books of history.
