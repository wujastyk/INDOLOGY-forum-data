Subject: [INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?

Dear Rupert,
Pradhan?s edition (1975, p. 126.22-23) reads:
? pu?sa? sata? pau?sno r?ga utpadyate pitari. viparyay?t pratigha?.

However, the lacuna is easy to reconstruct with the help of the Vy?khy?:
?pu?sa? sata? pau?sno r?ga utpadyate m?tari, striy?? saty?? strai?o  
r?ga utpadyate pitari, viparyay?t pratigha?.

When the intermediary being is a male, a masculine desire for
his mother and repulsion (pratigha) for his father arise in him; when it is a
female, she has a feminine desire for her father and repulsion for her
mother.

See also my Compassion and Rebirth pp. 70-71.
With best wishes,
Eli
