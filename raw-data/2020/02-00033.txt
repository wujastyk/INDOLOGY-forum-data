Subject: [INDOLOGY] Access to NAK/NGMPP manuscripts
Message-ID: <BL0PR04MB4499A70A791CBA62B87343E385020@BL0PR04MB4499.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Indology List,

I would like to inquire whether anyone has access to NAK/NGMPP manuscripts or can recommend a way to get them electronically, short of going to Nepal. I would be grateful for any help or advice in this matter. The specific manuscripts I am looking for are as follows:

Manthanabhairava Siddhakhanda NAK nos. 5-4877, 1-228, and 1-787/2
Manthanabhairava Yogakhanda NAK nos. 2-165, 1-1151, 2-118, 5-4654, 3-164, 2-298, and 2-291.
Kulakaulinimata NAK nos. 5/9 (87) (17) 982-1009, 217a, A178/4, 3-788-139, and E 4041.

I apologize for cross-posting.

With gratitude,
Anya
