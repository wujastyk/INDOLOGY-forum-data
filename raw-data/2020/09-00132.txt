Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cf7J67z18Yh5ccXUb1MCTW+CHqBVQsWPYFiiPHFkfni+w@mail.gmail.com>

The Internet Archive is piloting an ambitious project specifically to
archive and make available *academic* journal articles.  See for example:

   - https://scholar-qa.archive.org/search?q=indology&filter_time=past_year

They say,

This fulltext search index includes over 25 million research articles and
other scholarly documents preserved in the Internet Archive. The collection
spans from digitized copies of eighteenth century journals though the
latest Open Access conference proceedings and pre-prints crawled from the
World Wide Web.
