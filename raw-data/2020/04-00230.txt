The issue will be published online and in hardcopy by print on demand.

> Nick was a wonderful friend for the past 18 years or so. Besides his work as a Sanskritist and comparative anthropologist he was a regular participant in the Annual Conferences of the International Association for Comparative Mythology (IACM) ? formally founded in 2007 in Edinburgh, but going back three years earlier, to comparative mythology conferences Michael Witzel initiated at Harvard, Kyoto, and Beijing in 2004, 2005, and 2006.

> Nick?s work in comparative mythology was most closely associated with his extension of Dum?zil?s work in studies of Indo-European epic traditions, which Dum?zil and Nick after him argued were all based on earlier proto-Indo-European myths.

> Besides being one of Dum?zil?s last and most articulate defenders, Nick was a warm and generous human being in every imaginable way. We argued good-naturedly for years about his defense of Dum?zil, but it never affected the warmth of our relationship.

> I posted a note on Nick's death a bit ago on the Indo-Eurasian Research List (IER), which he contributed to frequently after Michael Witzel and I founded it in December 2004.
