Along the lines of Professor Dhadphale's suggestion for *vekura?ja *as
coming from Skt. *dvaikulajanya*, there are expressions like
*dvaim?tura*, *???m?tura
etc. *The term *dvy?mu?y?ya?a* refers to a son with two fathers, one legal
and the other biological. The sons born out of the so-called *niyoga
*"levirate"
are described with this term.  The term *ku??a *used in the passage has a
meaning of "out of wedlock," but having a dual connection, suggesting
something unnatural, illegal.   So *dvaikulajanya* sounds like a very
possible source.  I wonder if there is a northern Sanskrit ?gama version.
I read from earlier messages that the non-Pali versions translated into
Chinese show that this term was eliminated from the text, possibly being
considered some sort of an error.
