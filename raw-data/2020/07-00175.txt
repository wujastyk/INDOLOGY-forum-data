Dear Indologists,

I just read the review essay, ?Greater Magadha and the New Brahmanism: Recent Publications by Johannes Bronkhorst? by Tim Lubin published in 2015. Now that we are in 2020, have there been any updates to scholarly opinions or consensus regarding Bronkhorst?s conclusions, especially the ones considered controversial? 

Thanks

Regards,

Palaniappan
