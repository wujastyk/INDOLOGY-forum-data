[MARCELLO   Steiner! What are you doing here?

STEINER   What about you? I am at home here... Father Franz gave me a book...

And, while displaying a book he is holding under his arm, he also points at the young and short priest who has remained where he was and who has been observing the scene with a faint smile.

STEINER   ...which I had been looking for all across Rome. A Sanskrit grammar.

And Steiner laughs, as if about a joke.]


With warm regards,
Christoph
