For the children:

?????? ?????? ????? ????? ???? ?????? ???? ?
??-??-??-?? ????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?

"We are three friends, the cuckoo, the rohu fish and the snake,
the Corona gang, as they say, and we are striking the virus in the air, 
in the waters, and on the ground!"


A question to the grammarians: Can the rood adjective gha as the last 
member of compound be as freely used as the similar adj. -ghna, or is it 
restricted to lexicalised words like p??igha and r?jagha? I can hardly 
find instances of -gha in online texts.

Thanks
