Dear list members,
While doing a search of GRETIL  I noticed that the following verse is
a Ma?gala verse in six different pur??as.  As far as I could see the rest
of the  Ma?galam was different in each pur??a.  Do any list members know
why this verse should be so popular as a ma?gala verse in pur??as.

o? n?r?ya?a? namask?tya nara? caiva narottamam  /
dev?? sarasvat?? caiva tato jayamud?rayet  //

is a ma?gala verse in these pur??as:
garu?a-pur??a?
k?rma-pur??am
m?rka??eyapur??am
vi??u-pur??a?
v?mana-pur??am
bhavi?ya-pur??am

Thanks,
Harry Spier
