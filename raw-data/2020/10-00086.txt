Subject: [INDOLOGY] mas, masti, masta

Dear colleagues,

With reference to the Dh?tup??ha, PW (whence MW) records a class-IV root mas, 'to measure, mete', and derived nominal forms masa, masana, masti. MW further records a ppp masta 'measured'.

In B?htlingk's edition of the A???dhy?y?, in the appendix giving the Dh?tup??ha, I indeed find "mas? parim??e (pari??me)" as entry 4.112.

I am eager to know whether there is any evidence for the actual use of any forms derived from mas 'to measure', and particularly of the forms masti and masta, whether in ko?as or other kinds of sources liable to have been known to any author writing in the 9th century.

Thank you.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
