Dear Alessandro,

years ago, answering to a question concerning anklets, a member of this group recommended this volume: Tewari, S.P., N?pura. The anklet in Indian literature and art. With a
foreword by C. Sivaramamurti. Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 1982.

I?ve never had the book in my hands, but its title strongly suggests that it focuses on anklets only? Unfortunately, no Italian library has it.

Best,

Marco

References on jewels in literature would be highly appreciated: I am trying to ascertain if the poet had been somehow influenced by other k?vyas or by technical literature. Thanks.
