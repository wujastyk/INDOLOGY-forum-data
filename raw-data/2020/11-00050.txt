Subject: [INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?

Dear fellow members of the Indology list,
Most people think of reincarnation being a somewhat deterministic process based on past karma.
I read someplace, however, that Tibetans, and maybe other Buddhists, consider the process of assigning one's karma for the next life as something akin to reaching into a box of chips and grabbing a random collection of karmas that set in motion the next life. Thus, it is not so strictly deterministic.

I'm sorry if I'm not describing this accurately.
Can anyone point me to some original sources or commentaries for this idea ? 

Also, is this something that is mentioned in Hinduism or other reincarnation-based religions?
Best,
Dean Anderson
