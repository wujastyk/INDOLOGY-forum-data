Message-ID: <CADSGPzVewScc0vQAFwpBqab+bEm=naP=LcgVVKTRzHhjP96b5g@mail.gmail.com>

Respected Scholars,

I am in need of scanned copies of the following lexica. Any help on list or
off list is appreciated.
The names of works are taken from History of Indian Lexicography by Claus
Vogel.

1. Paramaanandiiyanaamamaalaa of Makarandadaasa.
2. SiddhashabdaarNava of Sahajakiirti.
3. Koshakalpararu of Vishvanaath. (Part 1 seems available on archive.org.
Part 2 is not available)
4. Pancatattvaprakaasha of Veniidatta.
5. Shabdaratnaavalii of Mathuresh Vidyaalankaara.
6. Shivakosha of Shivadatta Mishra.
