I?m very sorry to hear about the passing away of my friend Sasha Dubyanskij. 
Among his principal works I would like to mention the new Russian handbook of the Dravidian languages, of which he was the chief editor:
Dubyanskij, A. M., E. B. Markus, N. V. Gurov & A. A. Kibrik (eds.) 2013. Yazyki mira: Dravidijskie yazyki. Moskva: Academia. 584 pp. Hb ISBN 978-5-87444-369-6.

After returning from the army, he graduated and did his PhD at the Moscow State University, where he got interested in Indology and later taught Tamil language and literature for more than 40 years. He also taught at the Russian State University for the Humanities.
