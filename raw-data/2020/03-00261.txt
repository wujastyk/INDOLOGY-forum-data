Thank you for this Dominik.

The author in the following link, for the reasons you've mentioned and
because the gayatris are  mostly to later deities, argues that this section
of the  Maitr?ya??-Sa?hit?:   is interpolated:
https://books.google.ca/books?id=X0JUwf2BXVAC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=maitrayani+samhita+x.9.1&source=bl&ots=zfBpMv9w-q&sig=ACfU3U2LME_WHFLc9K4mr4lvOD8UVoCkEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIuojYs8LoAhUImuAKHYHQDPEQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=maitrayani%20samhita%20x.9.1&f=false

You also asked:
 I wonder whether and where they are actually called G?yatr?s?

If you do a search of the Muktabodha searchable e-text  digital library
for <gAyatrI> you'll see that throughout the tantric literature these types
of mantras are called   g?yatr? or g?yatr?matra or  the deity name
compounded with  g?yatr?  such as: n?si?hag?yatr?  etc. If I recall
correctly they are called  g?yatr? much more often than  g?yatr?mantra.
