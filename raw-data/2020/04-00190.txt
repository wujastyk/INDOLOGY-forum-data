Dear Indology list friends,

I happened to give a talk recently at University of Hyderabad on a related topic: how should Panini?s grammar be regarded from an informatics perspective.
The talk is available as a YouTube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxkp_fuZkks&feature=youtu.be>, but the quality of sound is not very good. The slides are available from my Web site <http://gallium.inria.fr/~huet/talks.html>.
Best,

G?rard

> As someone who is familiar with both Sanskrit and professional computer programming, I'd say that any contribution of Sanskrit is more likely to be from an abstract level of thinking deeply about language rather than any kind of direct application of Sanskrit as a programming language.

> In fact, one of the very things that makes Sanskrit such a fascinating language for philosophy and poetry -- its ability to have multiple meanings and nuance -- are the things which make it unsuitable for computers, as least in a simplistic application. At the moment, computers don't do nuance very well.

> Dear Friends, I'm wondering if I might be directed towards any objective discussion specifically related to Sanskrit and computers.To give some more context, this is an evolving component of my Imagining Sanskritland project. It links in with assertions like Sanskrit is the "language of the rural masses." The idea that Sanskrit is the best language for computing holds particular currency. I'm keen to look into it more. I'm guessing most are likely aware of the factoids circulating, which are ultimately based on the infamously disembedded NASA article by Rick Brigg's from 1985. It is consistently recycled as a means to justify several cultural nationalist assertions, one being that Sanskrit is the most "computerable" language. To illustrate, here is a very recent assertion,

Sanskrit?s credentials to be a language of future India are definitely better and greater than we have realised so far. Its revival will not only renew and revive the pride in our own cultural heritage, but will also bring about spiritualism and the concept of a meaningful society and polity, thereby bringing order and peace all across the country, a desideratum for any developed society.

However, what I'm ultimately looking for is cogent discussion of the sociological side of this phenomenon, if it exists.
