Dear Dominik,

Others may provide a more informed account ? like you, this is not something I?ve given much thought to ? but a quick look at the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, while still only representing a limited albeit important range of Sanskrit literature, lists nearly 500 instances for ko?a, starting with ?g Veda (41 occurrences), Atharvaveda (13 occurrences), Ch?ndogyopani?ad (3 occurrences), A???dhy?y? (A???dhy?y?, 4, 3, 42.0 <http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=526840> ko??? ?ha? ||),  Buddhacarita (4 occurrences), Hitopade?a (10x), not to mention Abhidharmako?a, Amarako?a, and so on, but only 4 instances of ko?a (Nighantu?e?a 1x, Vi??upur??a 1x, and ?ry?sapta?at? 2x), the nod would seem to overwhelmingly favor ko?a. The term can have a range of meanings aside from encyclopedic compendium or lexicon, so many of those instances may reflect a variety of different meanings.

best,
Dan

(ko?a), is quite common, perhaps even preferred, especially in the title ????????? (ko??dhipati), which was the official in change of the Phra Khlang, or treasury, in Ayutthaya.

Then I saw "-ko?a" on the title page of Ingalls's Subh??itaratnako?a <https://archive.org/details/ananthologyofsanskritprosepoetrysubhashitaratnakoshakosadanielingallsh.h.univers/page/n2/mode/2up>.  He must have thought about this.
