Regarding:  Introductory Suggestions:
Quit now before it's too late!

Almost the same quote in the same location is given in Felix Otter's
Grundkurs Sanskrit, p. ix:
,,Give up now before it's too late.''
Handschriftlicher Zusatz eines anonymen Vor-
besitzers unter der ?berschrift ,,Introductory
Suggestions'' in einem antiquarisch erworbenen
Exemplar von C.R. Lanmans Sanskrit Reader.

Could this be the very same book or is it a coincidence?

All the Best,
Victor
