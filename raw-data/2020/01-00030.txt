Hi Natasha,

On translator poems, jokes, etc.: When struggling for a decade translating an outrageously obscure medieval (Latin) text, I always wondered if there were something in Sanskrit (or Chinese, etc.) that could match the poetic efficiency of the classic Italian ?Traduttore, traditore!? 

I never found one, but I?d assume sentiments like this are linguistic universals of sorts. :)

If anyone  knows anything similar in Sanskri, I?d assume he/she would be on the Indology List.
