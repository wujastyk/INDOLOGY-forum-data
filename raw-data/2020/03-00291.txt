The secret is to search for Parthasarathi Misra.

There are at least two editions at archive.org<http://archive.org/>. The second of these is not complete (some pages missed in the scan). I?m responding in case Andrew and Madhav did not report these.

Dear All,
I was hoping someone out there could point me to some online or PDF edition of the Mimamsaslokavarttika. I am aware of portions of it that are on GRETIL, but I actually need the whole thing. Like many of you out there, this virus has left me suddenly housebound without a chance to get the materials I needed to teach the remainder of the semester from home.
Be well,
