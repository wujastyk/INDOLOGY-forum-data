Dear Harry,

     The word ?rtikyam does appear in late Sanskrit texts, mainly texts
describing the procedure of P?j?.  I have seen "?rtikyam pratigr?hyat?m".
If you search with the word ?rtikyam on Google, numerous such texts will
pop up.  This is probably explainable as Sanskritization of the vernacular
word ?rati.
