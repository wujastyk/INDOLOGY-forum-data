Strictly speaking, as Antonia pointed out already, yuddha and yudh mean both "battle" and not "war", unless we'd like to take them as a synecdoche, so I don't think they apply in the case of the scene in Arrival. When I watched it, my first impression of the scene in which the linguist Louise Banks says that gavisti means desire for cows was that she was trying to make precisely the point that Antonia made in her tweet. I don't think the meaning of the whole scene is that if you know the Sanskrit word for war you are a better linguist, it is more about how you should think about language. On the other hand, I might be reading too much into it.

Sincerely yours,

Simon Moon

That scene from Arrival (and much of Arrival) got my goat from a linguistic perspective, and given how many people were talking about it back then, I tweeted the attached as an attempted Public Service Announcement. (Feel free to share, should the need ever arise!)

?Antonia

For anyone on gmail who also doesn't receive attachments, here's the text:
The Sanskrit Word for ?War?
If you watched the recent science-fiction movie Arrival, you may remember the question asked to test a linguist?s usefulness for a military enterprise: ?What is the Sanskrit word for ?war??? The answer provided: ?A desire for cows?. Is it? Well ? yes and no. Sanskrit is a literary language. Literature tries to say what it says in ways that are interesting, appealing, aesthetically pleasing. If a text about a war were to only ever use the word ?war? (and not also, say, armed conflict, battle, clash, bloodshed, strife, misery, excitement), it would soon get boring. Sanskrit literature, furthermore, takes the use of alternative expressions even further than other literary traditions. War is called ?a coming together of chariots?, ?a stirring?, is evoked by referring to ?the battle  call?, ?the battle prize?, ?excitement? and, yes, in the poetic language of the Rigveda, the word gav-i??i- ?cow-desire? is used to mean ?desire? in general, a ?desire for fighting?, and, finally, ?fighting? in general. ? So, is ?a desire for cows? the Sanskrit word for war? More or less to the extent that ?shock and awe? is ?the English word for ?war??.

(The Sanskrit word that means ?battle? and nothing else is yuddham. Whether knowing an ancient word for ?battle? makes you more useful to the military is a question we will leave undiscussed here!)

There is, of course Roger Zelazny?s 1967 Scifi novel, Lord of Light and, perhaps tangentially, there is the 2016 sci-fi film ?Arrival?in which  the actress Amy Adams plays an expert linguist and translator, Louise, who, because of her earlier assistance to the military with a translation from Farsi, is recruited by an army colonel to decipher the language of some extra-terrestrial visitors. When asked about other experts who might help, she says of a colleague at Berkeley, ?Ask him the Sanskrit word for ?war,? and its translation.? When the colonel reappears, he says the other linguist said ?gavisti? means ?an argument,? whereas Louise translates the same word as ?a desire for more cows.?

Bes to all. Be safe Stay well.

Dear Antonia,

Yes, I think you are correct.  The G?yatr? mantra and other features of the show are no doubt meant to create an "atmosphere" as much as anything, and to build up to the idea that several ancient cultures of earth could plausibly have been descended from the culture of the humans who fled the Cylons.  (I think I just dropped a huge spoiler!  But the show is absolutely worth viewing to see how all of its various themes and character arcs play out.)  And yes, it is definitely significant that Glen A. Larson, the creator of the original series, was Mormon, and consciously included aspects of Mormon thought in it.  (The important planet Kobol, for example, is a clear anagram for the planet Kolob described in a Mormon text called the Book of Abraham.)  The re-envisioned Galactica series is much less tied to Mormonism than Larson's original, but certainly contains nods to it.

As I argue in my piece on Hinduism and Star Wars, the creators of most of these successful sci-fi series are typically not trying, consciously, to communicate specific religious themes so much as they are trying to tell an interesting and entertaining story, with at least as many hints of a deeper cultural background as needed to evoke what Tolkien called the "inner consistency of reality."

Michael's post made me google around a little bit, and the answer to how we got the g?yatr? mantra in the credits may lie not with the creator of the show, but with the composer of the score, Bear McCreary. It seems that he likes the trope of 'ominous Latin [sic] chanting', and has used it in a variety of languages:

Ominous Latin Chanting<https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting>: Chanting in Anglo-Saxon[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjPAx5-vD_A>, Armenian[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9CqxkuSldY>, Gaelic[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGcMPp7TNo4>, Greek, Italian[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWxric37OyA>, Latin[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDs6yZ4dbs> several[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3QJObI711U> times[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMzkuKAIoL4>, Samoan[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIvppNWZUtc>, Sanskrit[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3YVq0Hvd8k>, Sinhalese[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eON5O5MRz5M>, and Icelandic[https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoT2MgT2LVI>.

Go to https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BearMcCreary for links to each of those languages in action.

That does not explain the non-musical Sanskrit/Indic elements in the show, but given that there is copious Greek mythology present as well, I suppose maybe the unifying theme here is 'ancient' (and thus 'mysterious' etc), rather than a specific culture? After all, the series as a whole is meant to be taking place in an ancient past.

(And then of course there are the various Mormon bits inherited from the original series, which one could argue are 'ancient' or at the very least 'old' by US cultural standards.)

I am delighted that the topic of science-fiction, my favorite genre, has come up on this list!

Michael, the G?yatr? mantra, or a version of it, is indeed used in the opening credits of the re-envisioned Battlestar Galactica (a series which is a huge improvement on the original, on which I grew up in the seventies, but for which I still have a sentimental fondness).  The word pracoday?t is mispronounced as prakoday?t, presumably because the creators of the series were not aware of how the unaspirated 'c' is pronounced in the standard international transliteration system for Indic languages.  But it's clearly an attempt to sing the G?yatr? mantra.

The series is rich with fascinating themes, including a problematizing of monotheism.  The mainstream human culture depicted in the series has multiple deities, and other interesting resonances with non-Abrahamic faiths.

Though it diverges from the topic fo the G?yatr? mantra, others have posted on relations between aspects of Hindu thought and ideas found in popular sci-fi series.  My own humble contributions to this discourse are as follows:

A piece on Hindu themes in Star Wars.  It's the second part of a two-part series, the first being on Hindu themes in the music of George Harrison and the Beatles:

I owe the title, 'The Yoga of Yoda,' to Swami Sarvapriyananda, of the Vedanta Society of New York.  He knew this was a favorite topic of mine and was the person who first encouraged me to speak and write about it.

A further developed series of reflections on this topic are going to be in my forthcoming Hinduism in America: A Convergence of Worlds, due to be published later this year by Bloomsbury.

Though Game of Thrones is technically not sci-fi, but fantasy, I have a piece on Hindu themes in Game of Thrones that is also going to be in a forthcoming edited volume by Matthew Brake on religion in Game of Thrones.

May the Force be with you!

Dear Michael,

There are various bits of Sanskrit throughout Galactica - at the end of the mini-series, Elosha chants the 'asato m? sadgamaya' (helpfully subtitled as 'priestess chanting in foreign language':-)); the surname of Roslin's aid Billy is Keikeya (close enough to Kaikeya to make me think:-)); Roslin's medicine is kamala extract - and so on.

I've long been wondering how this made it into the series - so far to no avail. Ron Moore, the creator of this Galactica remake, was a Cornellian, and Cornell has long had a fairly solid Sanskrit tradition - but beyond that I have no idea. If anyone on the List can contribute to this, I'd be most grateful!

(And for what it's worth, I hear the intro as sva?, over two notes, rather than sv?h?.)

All the best,
