Dear Artur,

There is indeed a large literature on the subject.
Michael Jerryson's article, "Buddhism, War, and Violence," ch. 22 in The Oxford Handbook of Buddhist Ethics,
provides a useful overview with a good bibliography.

Some contemporary studies on the theme of Hate as a kind of Love :

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01940/full#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20love%20and%20hate%20are,psyches%20(Alford%2C%202005).

In Jung, we have " Love as a Shadow of Hate" "Love -hate binary"  etc.,

This theme is also connected to the theme of Vaira Bhakti or Vidvesha Bhakti.

This paradoxical concept of Vaira Bhakti is rooted in the idea of raaga and dvesha being the two forms of the same thing called sanga (e.g., in Gita).

Thus intra-Indic historical , global historical, intra-Indic comparative/cross-cultural , global comparative/cross-cultural  studies on  the theme of hate as a form of love also may provide diachronic and synchronic clues to the development / occurrence of the theme.

Studies on the history of the theme of Jaya -Vijaya and their incarnations as demons could be one route to tracing the history of this theme.

Studies on the historical background of the occurrence of this narrative in Bhagavata Purana may provide clues.

Dear friends,

It is often said that the demons killed by R?ma
are in fact liberated or dispatched to favorable rebirths, which of course provides a needed ethical fig-leaf with which to gloss the violence done to them.
The notion that the demon is in fact freed by R?ma is, so far as I am aware, explicit in some cases (e.g. the story of Vir?dha), but not in every case.
When and where does it become a universal principle applied to all those killed? And are there any studies that you can recommend that focus on this particular theme? (which is perhaps more systematic in Kampan than in V?lmiki??)

Thanks in advance for any references you may be able to provide to scholarship on this subject.
