Dear Prof. Vielle,

An electronic version of the item is indeed available on HathiTrust.
However, the way HathiTrust works is that, in an electronic imitation of a
physical library, only one individual at a time is permitted to "check out"
the item and view it digitally through the HathiTrust portal. You then
"keep" the item for one hour (with ability to renew for additional
hour(s)), and then "return" the electronic item for the next patron.
According to my university librarians, at least, there is no way to
download the PDF.

Wish I could be of more help,

Shankar Nair
