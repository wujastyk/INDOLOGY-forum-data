Dear Mr Das,Thanks for your reply.But I seek the reference as to the Skandha , Adhyaya and shloka? No.where it has been used in the Srimad Bhagavata Purana.?????? refers to the meaning that Shrikrishna is beyond the grip of the Maya and Maya is his servant.I have not that edition of the SrimadBhagavata in which exhaustive Word Index is contained.RegardsGirish K.
