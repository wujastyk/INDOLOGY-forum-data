Hi Patrick,

There?s a Schopen article which I believe is also in the yellow ?Bones, Stones? book:

Schopen, Gregory. "Filial piety and the monk in the practice of Indian Buddhism: A question of ?Sinicization' viewed from the other side."?T'oung Pao?70, no. 1 (1984): 110-126.

This deals with a few inscriptions with references to non-Indic material.

There is also

Strong, John S. 1983. ?Filial Piety and Buddhism: The Indian Antecedents to a ?Chinese? Problem.? In?Traditions in Contact and Change, ed. Peter Slater and Donald
Wiebe, 171?86. Waterloo, Canada: Wilfried Laurier University Press.

And the issue is discussed in several places in Reiko Ohnuma?s book, ?Ties that Bind: Maternal Imagery and Discourse in Indian Buddhism."

Hope this helps!
