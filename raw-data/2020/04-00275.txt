The two articles by S.K. Chatterji both titled "The Pronounciation of
Sanskrit" but written 30 years apart address the pronounciation of anusvara
in different parts of India and also whats considered "correct"
pronounciation of sanskrit.  I've attached one article and given you a link
to the second one on archive.ort

Indian Linguistics 21:  pages 61-82
I've attached this article

K. B. Pathak Commemoration volume  pages 333 - 350
