Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scan needed
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o8Dhg21oHYC_03fFRSQF-dmf=-eE7jL5ycQV1KuNN4N3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

If anyone has access to the Vi??upur??am critical edition by M. M. Pathak,
would it be possible to scan the pages that give the manuscript variations
for verses 2.6.1 thru 2.6.3 .

I know the main text based on this critical edition is on GRETIL but its
the manuscript variations for these three paragraphs I need.

Many thanks,
Harry Spier
