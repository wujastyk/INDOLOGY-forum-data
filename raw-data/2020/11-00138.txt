Dear Professor Dominik Wujastyk,
Congratulations and thanks to you and to all the members of the 
management committee.
Let me wish our Indology group a long life, ?/candr//?//dityavat?/?as 
long as the moon and the sun last? as it is often mentioned in the Tamil 
inscriptions!
Thanks and best regards.
A. Murugaiyan
