Dear Prof. Michaels,
the elephant who remembers his former births is also a topos in  
several Jain narratives, e.g. the white elephant who is carrying  
Vimalav?ha?a because of their friendship in a former life  
(Vasudevahi??? p. 157, Tri?a??i?al?k?puru?acarita 1.2.140-142 etc.),  
or the elephant who saw the ascetic S?hacanda, remembered his former  
birth as king S?hase?a (the father of S?hacanda), was instructed by  
the ascetic and spent the rest of his life in meditation  
(Vasudevah???? p. 256) - to mention only two instances.
Kind regards,
Anna Esposito
