Dear all,

I picked up the Motilal Banarsidass pbk edition of Sandal, a 1999 rpt. of their ?first? 1993 edition, in India years ago. It does not contain an introduction, only a preface that barely spills over to a second page. The rest is entirely a bilingual, non-annotated edition of the sutras, each verse in devanagari followed by an English translation.

Dan

S?tras of Jaimini, vol. 27, they also included Sandal's Introduction, vol. 28, of ccxl pages. If you have that reprint, you have Sandal's introduction. I have not seen the Motilal Banarsidass reprint. AMS Press also reprinted the ccxl-page Introduction separately (vol. 28), as a hardback. This reprint is still available, and cheap, from Powells Bookstore Chicago, through AbeBooks: https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?clickid=WOTxVOVT3xyORVZwUx0Mo3bwUkiQabWRyVQIyA0&cm_mmc=aff-_-ir-_-1783343-_-684384&ref=imprad1783343&afn_sr=impact&tn=mimamsa%20sutras&isbn=&kn=&an=sandal&vci=62903 <https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?clickid=WOTxVOVT3xyORVZwUx0Mo3bwUkiQabWRyVQIyA0&cm_mmc=aff-_-ir-_-1783343-_-684384&ref=imprad1783343&afn_sr=impact&tn=mimamsa%20sutras&isbn=&kn=&an=sandal&vci=62903>. It is a high quality hardback. I have both physical volumes.
