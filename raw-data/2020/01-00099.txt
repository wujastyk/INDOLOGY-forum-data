Dear Andrey,

No, I do not, and will be grateful if you can share in case you manage to obtain a pdf. In the meantime, two related references that have probably not yet come to your attention:

J?kl, Ji??. 2017. ?Liquor in Glass Vessels: A Note on Glassware in Pre-Islamic Java and on Its Socio-Religious Symbolism.? Archipel: ?tudes interdisciplinaires sur le monde Insulindien 93: 15?29. https://doi.org/10.4000/archipel.404.
Perret, Daniel, and Zulkifli Jaafar. 2014. Ancient Glassware in Malaysia: The Pengkalan Bujang Collection. Kuala Lumpur: Department of Museums Malaysia.

Despite focus on Southeast Asia, both are heavily concerned with production and use of glassware in ancient Indian.

Best wishes,

Arlo

Dear members of the list,

I wonder if anyone may have (and is willing to share) a pdf of Dikshit M.G. 1969. History of Indian glass. University of Bombay. Bombay.
Many thanks in advance!
