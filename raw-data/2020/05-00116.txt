Dear colleagues,

I hope this email finds you in good health and spirit.
I have been trying to get a hold of a digital copy of the Proceedings of
the All-India Oriental Conference, twenty-fifth session, Jadavpur
University, Calcutta, October, 1969. Poona, All-India Oriental Conference,
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.
Would anyone happen to have a digital copy? The digital resource available
at our university is not working today.

Best wishes,
Borayin
