Dear Matthew,

I briefly discuss this topic in a 2016 article, which you can download from Brill's website:

Formigatti, Camillo A. " 6 A Forgotten Chapter in South Asian Book History? A Bird's Eye View of Sanskrit Print Culture". In Tibetan Printing: Comparisons, Continuities and Change, (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2016) doi: https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004316256_008

(You can find my thoughts about it on p. 84 and following. By the way, I have continued my research on the issue since then and I have a more informed opinion now, which I can share with you off list.)

Best wishes,

Camillo

Dear friends,

When and where does one first see the development of the ornamental script known in Nepal as Ra?jana (Tib. Lantsha)? I'm assuming Pala-period Bihar/Bengal, but would be pleased to be corrected about this or to receive greater specification.

thanks in advance,
Matthew
