Addition: A Sanskrit example of s-mobile would be the coexistence of a root tan- and a root stan-, both meaning ?thunder?


Dear Madhav and All,

There is also pari-?k?ta-. Unfortunately, Mayrhofer could not find any convincing parallels outside Sanskrit. However, there is a general phenomenon in Indo-European, called s-mobile (the varying presence or absence of a root-initial s). The Wikipedia entry "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_s-mobile? has a useful summary, as well as some relevant references. (An alternative, but more speculative explanation would be that in structures like namask? the s was reinterpreted as a simplification of earlier ss (similar to asi ?you are? for expected as-si, not also the Vedic external sandhi for -s#st etc.) and that this led to the notion that there is an alternative root form sk?-.)

All the best,

Hans

Dear colleagues,

In R?gveda 10.127.3 there is a verb form askr?ta showing the trace of the root skr?.  The Padap??ha of ??kalya presents this form as akr?ta, indicating that the root skr? as an independent root is no longer recognized. What is going on? Can one presume that forms like sa?skaroti where P??ini prescribes the insertion of "s" are actually survivals of this earlier root skr?.  Please suggest references that I can look up.
