I appreciate the additional information and sources. This confirms that for at least some authors, a?vatar? was used for hinny. It is still unclear whether that was specialized usage for just these authors, or implicit for all authors and texts even when not specifically explained as such. That Bh?skaraka??ha and ?nandabodhendrasarasvat??s had to provide that explanation, and in similar terms, might suggest that that meaning of the term was not that well known, thus requiring explanation, as well as suggesting that they are drawing on the same or a similar tradition which, since both lived in the 18th century, may or may not have been how the term was used prior to that time. The term is old, appearing in Br?hma?as, the Ch?ndogya-U., Atharva-veda, Mah?bh?rat?, etc.

Since the Chinese translation of the independent non-Pali version of the Assal?yana sutta was made in the late 4th century, and clearly differentiated mules from hinnies by parentage as well as assigning each its own designation ? ?? juxu for hinny and ? luo for mule ? one might assume that the Indic original did so as well, though that is not available to us. It is possible that a?vatar? was the term translated as juxu, but that is not certain. One might also assume that given the importance of equine species for both Indian and Chinese cultures from an early period, they would have been keen observers of breeding habits.

Female hinnies giving birth to foals is apparently a fairly rare event, but I haven?t seen anything in the modern literature indicating it requires C-sections, though hybrids between lions and tigers (which, since they roam in different territories only happens in captivity, often involves birth defects) do often require C-sections.

Again, thank you for that information.

best wishes,
Dan

His explanation matches the one given by Bh?skaraka??ha (AD 1725-1775 [Stanislav Jager, Bh?skaraka??has Citt?nubodha??stra. Marburg 2018: 15]):

To them, any crossbreed between a donkey and a horse equalled a ?mule?. This is probably the reason why the (English) dictionaries show no entries of the term ?hinny? at all, but use ?mule? throughout without further distinction.
> It must, however, be said that in the given context of the risk of death for a pregnant female ?hinny?, N?laka??ha?s elucidation of the above-quoted MBh 12.138.30cd (= MBh 12.140.30cd) contradicts the one of ?nandabodhendra and Bh?skaraka??ha. His would point to a mule instead a hinny, as N?laka??ha uses gardabha-j?. If this reading is correct, he seems to have had a crossbreed between a male donkey (gardabha) and a mare in mind. In this case, he either displays an inaccurate knowledge or shows the same indifference as the dictionaries do to facts of nature, which were perhaps dismissed as insignificant. However, in light of what other Indian authors had had to say on the subject, I have my doubts whether, given the uncritical state of the edition of N?laka??ha?s commentary (I have quoted from Pu?e 1932), variants with gardabh?-j? would not come to light one day. Reading gardabh?-j?, it would match our hinny from above. Here is the line, which in its present editorial state runs as follows:
> a?vatar? gardabhaj? a?v? udarabhedenaiva pras?ta iti prasiddham

However, we should never forget that in the present case we see the unspectacular depiction of an everyday reality, and that the authors were able to observe their environment more closely than we can today. If, what Bh?skaraka??ha had had to say about female hinnies, had been made up, his explanation of the d????nta would have come to nothing. He would have simply made a fool of himself among his contemporaries. Maybe he did, maybe he did not. I for one believe he did not.

>> Thank you for those examples. However, as far as I can tell, the idea that a?vatar? is a hinny, rather than a she-mule, seems to be only in Steiner?s interpretation, not in the texts themselves. Bh?skaraka??ha only explains it as a female mule (khara = mule, str? = female animal). Similarly, dvij?t?ya similarly just means a mule, without specifying that the parents must be a male horse and a female donkey rather than the inverse.
>> 
>> Monier-Williams has around 24 terms that can mean a mule, several of which mean a she-mule (e.g., a?vatar?, khar?, etc.), typically by giving a word for mule a feminine form. For instance:

>> 
>> But a she-mule is not a hinny. A mule has a male donkey and a female horse for parents. A hinny has the opposite: a male horse and a female donkey for parents. Mules and hinnies are physiologically different from each other as well. A hinny can be a male or a female.

>> A 1939 article in the Journal of Heredity describes two offspring of a fertile mare mule named "Old Bec", which was owned at the time by Texas A&M University <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A%26M_University> in the late 1920s. One of the foals was a female, sired by a jack. Unlike her mother, she was sterile. The other, sired by a five-gaited Saddlebred <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Saddlebred> stallion, exhibited no characteristics of any donkey. That horse, a stallion, was bred to several mares, which gave birth to live foals that showed no characteristics of the donkey.[23] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-JHeredity-30-12-23>

>> The wikipedia entry on ?hinny" has the following on fertility:
>> ==
>> Hinnies are difficult to obtain because of the differences in the number of chromosomes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome> of the horse and the donkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey>. A donkey has 62 chromosomes, whereas a horse has 64. Hinnies, being hybrids of those two species <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species>, have 63 chromosomes and are in the majority of cases sterile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertile>. The uneven number of chromosomes results in an incomplete reproductive system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system>. According to the ADMS: "The equine hybrid is easier to obtain when the lower chromosome count, the donkey, is in the male. Therefore breeding for hinnies is more hit-and-miss than breeding for mules."[2] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-LongearLingo-2>
>> The male hinny or mule can and will mate, but the emission is not fertile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility>. Male hinnies and mules <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule> are usually castrated to help control their behavior by eliminating their interest in females.[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>]
>> 
>> Female hinnies and mules are not customarily spayed, and may or may not go through estrus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrus>. Female mules have been known, on rare occasions, to produce offspring when mated to a horse or donkey, although this is extremely uncommon. Since 1527, sixty cases of foals born to female mules around the world have been documented.[4] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-Kay2002-4> In contrast, according to the ADMS, there is only one known case of a female hinny doing so.
>> 
>> Namely, in China <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China>, in 1981, a hinny mare proved fertile with a donkey sire. When the Chinese hinny was bred to a jack, she produced the so-called "Dragon Foal", which resembled a donkey with mule-like features.[5] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-FertileMule1985-5> In Morocco <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco>, in 2002, a mule mare bred to a donkey sire produced a male foal.[4] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-Kay2002-4> DNA testing revealed the foal has a mixed karyotype <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype> hybrid like the Chinese hinny offspring "Dragon Foal".[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>]
>> 
>> Hinnies are rare for many other reasons. Donkey jennies and horse stallions can be choosier about their mates than horse mares and donkey jacks.[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>] Thus, the two parties involved may not even care to mate. Even if they do cooperate, donkey jennies are less likely to conceive when bred to a horse stallion than horse mares are when bred to a donkey jack. Breeding <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breeding> large hinnies is an even bigger challenge, as it requires stock from a jenny of large size, such as the Baudet de Poitou <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudet_de_Poitou> or American Mammoth Donkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mammoth_Donkey>. Mammoth donkey stock is becoming increasingly rare and has been declared an endangered domestic breed. Fanciers are unlikely to devote a Mammoth jenny's valuable breeding time to producing sterile hinny hybrids, when Mammoth jennies are in high demand to produce fertile purebred Mammoth foals

I wonder if there is a northern Sanskrit ?gama version.
