On second look, a?va (not asv?), would be a male horse, so kharastriy?m a?v?j j?t? va?av? would mean born from a female donkey and (male) horse, though I?m not sure what to make of va?av?/va?aba ?a male horse resembling a mare (and therefore attracting the stallion)? (MW).

So that is an attempt to treat a?vatar? as a hinny. But is that followed consistently in the literature?

Bh?skaraka??ha only explains it as a female mule (khara = mule, str? = female animal). Similarly, dvij?t?ya similarly just means a mule, without specifying that the parents must be a male horse and a female donkey rather than the inverse.

> Hinnies are difficult to obtain because of the differences in the number of chromosomes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome> of the horse and the donkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey>. A donkey has 62 chromosomes, whereas a horse has 64. Hinnies, being hybrids of those two species <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species>, have 63 chromosomes and are in the majority of cases sterile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertile>. The uneven number of chromosomes results in an incomplete reproductive system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system>. According to the ADMS: "The equine hybrid is easier to obtain when the lower chromosome count, the donkey, is in the male. Therefore breeding for hinnies is more hit-and-miss than breeding for mules."[2] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-LongearLingo-2>
> The male hinny or mule can and will mate, but the emission is not fertile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility>. Male hinnies and mules <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule> are usually castrated to help control their behavior by eliminating their interest in females.[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>]
> 
> Female hinnies and mules are not customarily spayed, and may or may not go through estrus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrus>. Female mules have been known, on rare occasions, to produce offspring when mated to a horse or donkey, although this is extremely uncommon. Since 1527, sixty cases of foals born to female mules around the world have been documented.[4] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-Kay2002-4> In contrast, according to the ADMS, there is only one known case of a female hinny doing so.
> 
> Namely, in China <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China>, in 1981, a hinny mare proved fertile with a donkey sire. When the Chinese hinny was bred to a jack, she produced the so-called "Dragon Foal", which resembled a donkey with mule-like features.[5] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-FertileMule1985-5> In Morocco <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco>, in 2002, a mule mare bred to a donkey sire produced a male foal.[4] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-Kay2002-4> DNA testing revealed the foal has a mixed karyotype <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype> hybrid like the Chinese hinny offspring "Dragon Foal".[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>]
> 
> Hinnies are rare for many other reasons. Donkey jennies and horse stallions can be choosier about their mates than horse mares and donkey jacks.[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>] Thus, the two parties involved may not even care to mate. Even if they do cooperate, donkey jennies are less likely to conceive when bred to a horse stallion than horse mares are when bred to a donkey jack. Breeding <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breeding> large hinnies is an even bigger challenge, as it requires stock from a jenny of large size, such as the Baudet de Poitou <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudet_de_Poitou> or American Mammoth Donkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mammoth_Donkey>. Mammoth donkey stock is becoming increasingly rare and has been declared an endangered domestic breed. Fanciers are unlikely to devote a Mammoth jenny's valuable breeding time to producing sterile hinny hybrids, when Mammoth jennies are in high demand to produce fertile purebred Mammoth foals

The Chinese terms clearly differentiate between a mule (? luo, the result of mating a mare with a donkey) and a hinny (?? juxu, result of mating a stallion with a female donkey). I remain curious what the underlying Sanskrit or prakrit term behind juxu might be.

In addition to the Madhyama-?gama passage I posted, there is a version of the Assal?yana sutta that was translated as an independent text: Fanzhi eboluoyan wen zhong zun jing, ?????????? (Sutra on questions to Buddha about caste from the brahmin Ebulouyan=Assal?yana), translated by ???? Zhu Tanwulan (*Dharmarak?a, *Dharmaratna), a Central Asian monk in the late 4th c. Since it expands the discussion a bit, I translate it here. Like the Madhyama-?gama version, it omits the problematic word, unless the word was glossed instead of translated. But it adds an additional equine reproductive set:

It is the reciprocal cross to the more common mule, which is the product of a male donkey (a jack) and a female horse (a mare).

The sons born out of the so-called niyoga "levirate" are described with this term.  The term ku??a used in the passage has a meaning of "out of wedlock," but having a dual connection, suggesting something unnatural, illegal.   So dvaikulajanya sounds like a very possible source.  I wonder if there is a northern Sanskrit ?gama version.  I read from earlier messages that the non-Pali versions translated into Chinese show that this term was eliminated from the text, possibly being considered some sort of an error.
