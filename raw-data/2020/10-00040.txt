Dear Colleagues,

in response to a few queries I've received off-list, I thought it might be
useful to convey the information that it is possible to order the recently
published volume *Research on the Sa?yukta-?gama* (as well all as all our
publications that have come out with Dharma Drum Corporation) also for
shipping outside Taiwan. Please see the section ??????????on the
publisher?s FAQ page at https://www.ddc.com.tw/faq/#faq-17

For those who cannot read Chinese, it is possible to contact the publisher
directly and place an order in English through the following email address:
market at ddc.com.tw

With kind regards,

Bhikkhun? Dhammadinn?
