> (I don?t have an e-copy of the Skt to paste from, but Jolly provides it in ?Mosquitoes and Fever in Su?ruta? with a different translation, but the same conclusion, as above ? the ancient and medieval Indian medical sources do not connect mosquitos with malaria or disease other than local irritation, except for one lethal variety.)

> from Ch. 3 (diacriticals as in the book):
> 
> "Locations : ?An animal poison is usually situated in the following parts, viz; the sight, breath, teeth, nails, urine, stool, semen, saliva, menstrual blood, stings, belching*, anus, bones, bile, bristles (?uka) and in the dead body of an animal. 3.
> "Of these, the venom of celestial serpents lies in their sight and breath, that of the terrestrial ones in their fangs while that of cats, dogs, monkeys, Makara (alligators?), Frogs, P?ka-matsyas (a kind of insect), lizards (Godh?), mollusks (Snails), Prachalakas (a kind of insect), domestic lizards, four-legged insects and of any other species of flies such as mosquitoes, etc., lies in their teeth and nails. 4.
> The venom of a Chipita, Pichchataka, Kash?ya-v?sika, Sarshapa-v?sika, Totaka, Varchah-kita, Kaun- dilyaka and such-like insects lies in their urine and excreta. The poison of a mouse or rat lies in its semen, while that of a Lut? (spider) lies in its saliva, urine, excreta, fangs, nails, semen and menstrual fluid (ovum). 5 ?6. 
> "The venom of a scorpion, Vi?vambhara, R?jiva-fish, Uchchitinga (cricket) and a sea-scorpion lies in their saliva. The venom of a Chitra-?irah, Sar?va, Kurdi?ata, D?ruka, Arimedaka and ??rik?-mukha, lies in their fangs, belching, stool and urine. The venom of a fly, a Kanabha and leeches lies in their fangs. The poison lies in the bones of an animal killed by any poison, as well as in those of a snake, a Varati and a fish*. The poison lies in the bile of a ?akuli, a Rakta-r?ji and a Ch?raki fish. The poison lies in the bristles (?uka) and the head of a Sukshma-tunda, an Uchchitinga (cricket), a wasp, a centipede (?atapadi), a ?uka, a Vala bhika, a ?ringi and a bee. The dead body of a snake or an insect is poisonous in itself. Animals not included in the above list should be deemed as belonging to the fang-venomed species i.e., the poison lies in their fangs. 7? 11.?

> It goes on (ch. 8) to discuss ?characteristic features and purifications of poisoned water, etc.?
> 
> Later it discusses bites from various types of insects, etc., such as centipedes (?ata-padi), poisonous frogs (manduka), ants (pipilik?), ?stinging flies? (makshik?), and mosquitos (ma?akas):
> 
> "Ma?akas (Mosquitoes):?Mosquitoes (Ma?akas) are divided into five species, viz., the S?mudra, Pari-mandala, Hasti-ma?aka, Krishna and the Parvatiya. A mosquito (Ma?aka)-bite is characterised by a severe itching and swelling of the affected locality; while the symptoms which mark a bite by a Parvatiya one are similar to those of a bite by fatally venomous insects, and a sting of the points of their antennae is followed by the appearance of pustules (Pidak?) attended with a burning sensation and suppuration therein, when scratched by the finger-nails. The characteristic features of a bite by Jalaukas (leeches) with the mode of treatment thereof have already been described. 18.?
