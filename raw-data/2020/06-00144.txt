Dear List,

Might anyone be able to share a scan of Karl Potter's, *The
Pad?rthatattvanir?pa?am of Raghun?tha ?iroma?i; a demonstration of the true
nature of the things to which words refer* (Cambridge, 1957)?

I've looked in the usual places but with no luck; and I cannot access the
HathiTrust scan,

Many thanks,
Sam

Ahmedabad University
