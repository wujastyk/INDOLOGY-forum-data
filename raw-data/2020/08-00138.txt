There is the important difference, of course, that 'self-actualization' as
it is used in western psychology tends to involve maximal individuation,
whereas ?tmas?k??tk?ra or ?tm?bh?va involve the opposite: becoming devoid
of individuation ? devoid of both qualitative and numerical individuation
for Advaitins; devoid of qualitative individuation for Naiy?yikas,
S??khyas, etc.
