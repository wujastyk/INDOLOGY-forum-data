Dear all,

A colleague not on the list asked me to post the following query:

"I would be grateful for any (translated) primary or secondary sources that discuss funerary rites involving the preservation of the bodies of realized masters or sangha members. The sources can draw from canonical, ritual, or commentarial literature that directly addresses the topic of whole-body relics. Ideally I would like sources on such practices in Therav?da cultures, but would appreciate anything generally pertinent to the topic."

Many thanks in advance,

Ryan
