Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
Message-ID: <8aa0df17-feea-d81c-1172-8599e3a30a83@gmx.de>

Dear all,

those working with Vedic texts may be interested in this resource:

https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/dcs/data/bloomfield-vedic-concordance

It contains a script which resolves complex citations in the VC and
stores the result in a new file (data/ directory).

E.g.:
original: RV.8.23.22b; 39.8e; 60.2d
transformed: RV.8.23.22b; RV.8.39.8e; RV.8.60.2d

Should make searching in the VC much easier.
The data directory also contains parts of the transformed data in
various formats such as JSON or an R-style data frame, which can be used
for analyzing the data more closely.

If you find errors, please adapt and update the script or send me a mail.

Best, Oliver
