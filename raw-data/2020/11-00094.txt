Dear Colleagues,

In addition to the work of Ian Stevenson, mentioned by Gleb Sharygin, I would add the ongoing work of Jim Tucker, Stevenson?s successor at the University of Virginia, who has sought to correct the elements of bias found in Stevenson?s research.

A noteworthy article in this regard, co-authored by Jonathan Edelmann and William Bernet, is ?Setting Criteria for Ideal Reincarnation Research? (Journal of Consciousness Studies, 14(12), December 2007). (I apologize if this has already been mentioned somewhere in this thread and I failed to notice it.)

All the best,
Jeff

First is of American (but Canadian-born) Professor of psychiatry Ian Stevenson, who analyzed many cases of remembrance of previous lifes and studied uncanny cases of inborn injuries or birthmarks on those areas of the bodies of supposedly reincarnated person, which were damaged due to their violent death in their "previous life/lives" (accident, murder etc.). Stevenson, being a scientist, tried to apply rigorous scientific methodology in his research, but, as the critics pointed out later, he still could not avoid bias in his research, so most of it is considered to be flawed.

In his book "Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research" (2018), which I can highly recommend as an introduction to that area of inquiry, he takes up the research of Stevenson, provides a necessary theoretical background for the study of reincarnation and adds new empirical dimension to it: a philological one (!). He argues that a Sri Lankan boy, who at a very early age "remembered" his previous life as famous ancient Buddhist commentator Buddhaghosa, "remembered" the portions of the ancient Buddhist canon that are unique, having analyzed the tapes of the recitation of the canon by the said boy.

I may add here that the Buddha says that one should not think about the workings of karma(n), because it will drive them insane (because of complexity of the matter).
