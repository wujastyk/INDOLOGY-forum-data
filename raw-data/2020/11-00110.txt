Is there a Skt term for a hinny?

Cp. Mok?op?ya  I.38.8:
avi?r?ntaman?? ??nyam ?yur ?tatam ?hate |
du?kh?yaiva vim??ho 'ntar garbham *a?vatar?* yath? ||

Bh?skaraka??ha explains it as follows:
"a?vatar?"* kharastriy?m a?v?j j?t?* va?av? | tasy? "garbha?" kuk?ip??ana?
vin? na niry?ti (Mok?op?ya??k? on I.13.8)

Cp. the translation by Roland Steiner (Wiesbaden 2014: p.52):
13.8 Ein innerlich verwirrter [Mensch, dessen] Denken *(manas)* nicht
beruhigt [ist], strebt nach einem leeren, ausgedehnten Leben, [das einem]
nichts anderes als Leiden [eintr?gt], wie eine *Maul??eselstute*[1] <#_ftn1>
eine Leibesfrucht [begehrt].

------------------------------

[1] <#_ftnref1> Eine Maul??eselstute (Vater: Pferdehengst; Mutter:
Eselstute) kann nach Bh?skaraka??ha nur mit Kaiserschnitt geb?ren; M? I *ad*
13.8: *a?vatar? kharastriy?m a?v?j j?t? va?av? / tasy? garbha? kuk?ip??ana?
vin? na niry?ti*.


pw offers a series of entries of Sanskrit words for "Maulthier" (= "mule"):

and gives one entry for "Maulesel" (= "hinny"), namely dvij?t?ya. Schmidt
adds "?p?ra?ama":
