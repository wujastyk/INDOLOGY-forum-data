Subject: [INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka

The same Sri Lankan chronicles that talk about the Buddha?s visit to Sri
Lanka would be the main primary sources about Mahinda?s transmission of the
Dharma/Dhamma there. And it must be added that these sources also say that
Ashoka?s daughter, the nun Sanghamitta, was part of that mission, with her
establishing a bhikkunis order just as monk Mahinda established one of
bhikkhus.

Additionally, this is not ?proof? either, but regarding the Buddha?s
alleged visit, many Buddhists believe that the tallest peak in Sri Lanka
bears the footprint of his Lankavatara or ?descent onto Lanka? (as in the
name of the scripture Matthew mentioned). Hence this mountain is known as
Sri Pada or ?Sacred Footprint?. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many Christians
maintain that the dent in the rock is not Buddha?s but Adam?s footprint
(hence the mountain?s well-known English name), Adam?s Peak), many Hindus
believe it Vishnu?s, and if memory serves, many Muslims say it is that of
some Sufi saint.
