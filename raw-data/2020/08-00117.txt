Subject: [INDOLOGY] Haribhadra about vikalpa
Message-ID: <CY4PR07MB3416CE019D8BDF7AB898913FD4590@CY4PR07MB3416.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Haribhadra (the Buddhist, not the more famous Jain scholar) states the following definition of vikalpa in his ?lok?:

vikalpo ?vastu-nirbh?s?d visa?v?d?d upaplava iti mati?.

(Wogihara 1932-1935, p.158).

It seems like this could be a quotation, and Wogihara suggests so by the typography. He does not, however, give any source as he does in other cases. Sparham, in his English translation, does not either. I haven?t been able to track this definition back to any text. Dharmak?rti, who would be my prime suspect, does not seem to have authored it.

Does anybody recognize this definition and can give me a lead? Or should I conclude that this is just Haribhadra?s own creation?

With many thanks in advance for your help,
