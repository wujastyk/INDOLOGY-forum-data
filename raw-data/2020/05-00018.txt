All:
	I usually delete the poetry msgs. It has become so frequent and dominant that I considered unsubscribing this morning, which is sad, since this is supposed to be a scholarly list serve. Please post poetry (albeit skilled) and nonsense neo-Vedanta preaching for other lists and contexts, that Indology members can create on their own. Can the Indology admins please step in and make executive decisions about this before Indology becomes RISA-L?

sincerely secular and skeptical,

Deepak

Nevertheless, I object to the definition to distraction, not to the stanzas themselves. They are not a distraction, on the contrary. Moreover, I share Arlo's opinion and I cannot easily navigate the list as before due to the excessive number of messages on this topic - even if I skip them, it's still a nuisance.

Since I read every single day both Italian and British newspapers, my father lives alone in Lombardy (the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy) and we live in the UK, two of the most affected areas in the world, I don't share the need to read again on this list about the coronavirus in any form. I confess that the daily bulletin of deaths I follow daily on the worldometer website is enough for me.

I found the Sanskrit poems about the coronavirus disturbing from the very start and to me they were not a distraction, they represented rather the contrary. They were always a reminder of the fragility of our lives and in this incredibly sad moment, this is even more in my mind than ever. I haven't read a single one fully and I don't plan to read any in the future, regardless how refined their language might be. I just don't want to read them.
