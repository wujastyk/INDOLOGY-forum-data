Dear wise Sanskritists,

In the ?gveda padap?tha the word han, 3sg injunctive of the root han, is marked with parig?hya at the end of a verse. This occurs at 5.29.4d, 5.32.1d, and 10.99.6d. At 6.47.2d there is no parig?hya, and here h?n has ud?tta (vs. anud?tta in the other three passages).

Can anyone explain why this happens? This is not one of the uses of parig?hya that I am familiar with, such as for ka? = kar at verse end, where it has an obvious disambiguating function. This does not happen with all anud?tta monosyllabic words ending in -n, as e.g. vran at 5.29.12d, and I can't see what it would be disambiguating anyway.

Thanks for any answers received! Best wishes
John
