Dear Madhav and Christian (and dear Walter),
As the impact on our daily lives is only growing, and as long as worldwide
the mortality curves are, although perhaps slowly flattening, not yet
really coming down, it is difficult to get distracted for long from the
"coronavirus"...
Your verses with epic and mythological references are fascinating even in
translation; since the ?lokas I have composed simply describe the current
situation and what people do and believe, I guess a translation will
neither be interesting nor required.
Incidentally, the first professor of Sanskrit in Europe (the continent
having a name which perhaps suggests it should have a "broad outlook", *urv?
prek??*), Antoine L?onard (de) Ch?zy (partly latinized name: Apud-y),
specifically appointed for the academic study and teaching of Sanskrit in
Paris in 1815, was also, or so it seems, the last one for whom Sanskrit was
not only an object of study but also a medium of scientific expression: in
his *Th?orie du Sloka*, Paris, 1827, he summarized his conclusion on
Sanskrit metrics in a Sanskrit verse which illustrated the theory he had
extracted from his large reading samples.
For the last few centuries, however, "expressive Sanskrit" and "functional
and communicative Sanskrit" constitute glaring lacunae in the occidental
Sanskrit teaching of interested students, even though a little training in
these domains can contribute significantly to a basic mastery of Sanskrit
and even to the critical study of "archival Sanskrit".
To conclude, for those who have not yet rushed away from my longish
message, I would therefore like to commemorate in a simple descriptive
sragdhar?, also by way of distraction away from the corona virus, this
forgotten pioneer, de Ch?zy, who passed away prematurely 188 years ago due
to the cholera pandemic in 1832:

?????????? ?????????????  ???????????  ?????? ???????????

????????????? ???????  ???????????????? ?????? ????????? ?? ?

???? ??????????????  ?????? ???????????? ???????????

  ??????????? ???? ?????? ? ??????  ?????- ??? ????????????-????? ?????? ?

Stay well,

N.B.
Dear Christian, Thanks for your verse with special qualities.
Apart from ??????? in the first p?da,
or else ?? ????????? but then you have to give up ? which you obviously
like to keep after ???, to harmonize with the current Hindi orthography
of ????? ,
I would suggest for the second line: ??????????????????  ???????? ????????
?
