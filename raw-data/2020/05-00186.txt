Dear Friends,

Does anyone have access to this 2 volumed book?
Tantr?gam?ya dharma-dar?ana
by  Vrajavallabha Dvived?
Hathi Trust has an ebook version, but only allows one to search for word
counts, but not view the pages (if VPN is reset to USA).
<https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ssd?id=mdp.39015051496688;seq=1>

It supposedly has a discussion of the Siddh?ntas?r?vali and the rule for
fixing the widths of the sarvasama-li?gas. If there are other discussions
of this that are available, please let me know.

Thank you.

All the best,

????? ???????
