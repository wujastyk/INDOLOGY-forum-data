Message-ID: <CAP2uK7W6y5=je+oZKZVzNkU1ewKRHYfvoUrh3HYEhXCuh7Nr8w@mail.gmail.com>

*The 37th Annual Sanskrit Traditions in the Modern World Symposium*
*Friday 28th May 2021*
Hosted online by the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies

The 37th annual STIMW symposium will take place *online* on Friday 28th
May, 2021, hosted by the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies. We invite
proposals for papers on any aspect of South Asia?s rich Sanskrit religious
and intellectual culture.

Proposals of no more 300 words should be submitted by *28th February 2021*.
They should be sent to the organising committee: *stimw at ochs.org.uk
<stimw at ochs.org.uk>.*

Sanskrit Traditions in the Modern World (STIMW) is a forum for the
discussion of the Sanskrit traditions of South Asia, and the texts and
cultures that have arisen out of them. Older archives and information for
past STIMW events at the University of Manchester can be found here:
https://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/religions-and-theology/connect/events/stimw/

*Papers and Format *- Papers are presented by leading scholars in the field
as well as by research students. Papers are pre-circulated so that
participants can read them before the seminar to ensure the best possible
use of discussion time. Papers are therefore not read out at the seminar
itself but instead briefly introduced by the chair who will then raise
questions to the paper-giver, before opening the discussion. Papers should
be no longer than 20 A4 pages, including notes and references. To
facilitate discussion for those short of reading time, paper-givers should
provide a one-page abstract of the key argument of the paper, along with
their paper. Please include your email address for further feedback.
