Call for Papers

This year we plan to explore the relationships between art, literature, and religion in India and China. We encourage submissions on the following themes:
Religious Narratives and Visual Arts
This will be a traditional papers session. We seek individual papers (rather than fully formed panels) exploring the relationship between religious narratives and visual arts (sculpture, murals, mandalas, illuminated manuscripts, etc.) in India and China. Comparative proposals are welcome, as are proposals focusing exclusively on India or China (so long as the material is accessible to a broader audience).

Religion, Literature, and Global Humanities
This will be an experimental session. The goal is not to present specialized research, but to initiate a conversation between scholars working on religion and literature in India and scholars working on religion and literature in China. What might the study of Indian literature have to offer to scholars of Chinese literature, and vice versa? What challenges are distinctive, and what challenges are shared? How might Indian or Chinese reading practices and literary theory contribute to the global humanities more broadly? The session will begin with a brief statement from each panelist, but the majority of the time will be devoted to open discussion. In lieu of a traditional paper proposal, we ask potential panelists to provide a description of their work, its relation to the field of religion and literature more broadly, and their vision of the global humanities. Potential panelists should also suggest one or two literary examples they might share with a non-specialist audience to illustrate their work.
Proposals should be submitted through AAR?s PAPERS system (https://papers.aarweb.org <https://papers.aarweb.org/>).
