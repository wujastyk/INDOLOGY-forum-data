Subject: [INDOLOGY] sources on markers of girls' transition to adulthood
Message-ID: <CACh7YrRu95R52LukOgy3y9e4+dOZd_rppzk2zva9re8p2JcqTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am looking for sources that explore the age at which a girl traditionally
becomes an adult woman (meaning, she transitions into defacto adulthood by
the standards of the time) in Hindu culture, prior to the 19th century. I'm
already aware of the Indian Penal Code setting the age of consent for
marriage for girls at 10 years old in 1860, and the history following that.

In particular I'm looking for primary and/or secondary literature that
mention bodily processes, rites of passage, age, or other markers of that
transition to adulthood.

Many thanks!
-sundari
