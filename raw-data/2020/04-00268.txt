Verse 3 of the kuNDalinIstavaH has the phrase:
  kula-m?rga-mukta-nagar?-m?y?-kum?rga?

I'm wondering if   m?y?-kum?rga?  in the phrase refers to  m?y?v?da and the
phrase means something like:
"having abandoned the bad path of M?y?v?da for the Kula path".

siddh?rth? nija-do?a-vit sthala-gatir vy?j?yate vidyay?

ku??aly? kula-m?rga-mukta-nagar?-m?y?-kum?rga? ?riy?

yadyeva? bhajati prabh?ta-samaye madhy?hnak?le 'thav?

nitya? ya? kula-ku??al?-japa-pad?mbhoja? sa siddho bhavet


Thanks,

Harry Spier
