Dear Friends,

Might someone know the source of this quote?

*Sa Prathama Sanskrati Vishvavara*
<http://www.livescience.com/28634-indian-culture.html>

It is found embedded in assertions, like this:

*India has been described by some traditional texts as Sa Prathama
Sanskrati Vishvavara
<http://www.livescience.com/28634-indian-culture.html>, the first and
supreme culture in the world. To this day, the South Asian country remains
a hotspring of ancient wisdom on mind-body health and spirituality.*

If one puts this phrase in a search bar, then similar to the return of
recycled factoids of 'Sanskrit-speaking' villages the same paragraph citing
the AWGP is mentioned in countless websites. But AWGP website also offers
little in the way of a textual reference.
<http://www.awgp.org/spiritual_wisdom/indian_culture>

I am wondering what the traditional texts might be that describe this
assertion.

Thanks.

All the best,
