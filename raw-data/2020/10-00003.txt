Dear Colleagues,
I have been unable to obtain a copy of this old article by Stanislaw
Schayer:
?New contributions to the problem of pre-H?nay?nistic Buddhism", Polski
biuletyn orientalistyczny (Polish Bulletin of Oriental Studies) 1 (1937):
8-17.
Does anyone have access to the journal and would be so kind to send a PDF
version?
With many thanks and kind regards,
Bhikkhun? Dhammadinn?
