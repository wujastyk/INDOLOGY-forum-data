Dr.Walser,Thank you very much for elaborating on the issue.Yes, what comes out probably, is that Nirmana Kaya and Dharma Kaya was introduced by Nagarjuna, while Sambhoga Kaya&nbsp; goes to the credit of VigyanVadins.In fact, I am in possession of a Sutra&nbsp; from Nagarjuna's "VigrahaVya artani", which has the term "Nirman"Kaya.
Regards.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alakendu Das.

Dear Alakendu,
That all depends on which texts you consider to be authentic to Nagarjuna. He mentions two bodies (the dharmakaya and the rupakaya (presumably = nirmanakaya) in the Ratnavali chapter 3 verses 10-12. He also mentions the Dharmakaya in the Dharmadhatustotra
 and some of the other hymns. I don't think he was aware of the Sambhogakaya, but if you want to admit the authenticity of the Kayatrayastotranama then he was.



For a good discussion of the hymns ascribed to Nagarjuna and the issues around their authenticity, see Drasko Mitrikeski's 2008 dissertation from the University of Sydney.






Be well,

Respected Scholars,
About the 3 kayas in Buddhism, namely-Nirmana Kaya, Dharma Kaya, Sambhoga Kaya, I would prefer a question, as to whether they are post -Nagarjuna or framed by Nagarjuna himself?
May I kindly be enlightened on this issue.



Alakendu Das.
