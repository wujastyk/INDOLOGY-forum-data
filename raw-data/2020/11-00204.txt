There is also a Marathi Abhanga rendering of the Bhagavadg?t? attributed to
Tuk?r?m.  The 13th Century J??ne?var? is more of a Marathi verse commentary
on the Bhagavadg?t? rather than a translation.  The 19th century is the
real beginning of Marathi translations of Sanskrit and English works on a
large scale.  This coincides with the emergence of printing and publishing.
