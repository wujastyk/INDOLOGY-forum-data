Dear Harry,

    Compare Bhartr?hari's verse:

????????????????????????
???? ?????? ???????????? ? ?
???? ????????? ?????? ????????????
???? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??

The verse suggests that a dog is willing to go through his ??????? in order
to get his food, while the proud elephant is not.  In the verse ??????
?????????? ??? ???????: ???????:, the term ??????? is used.  The expression
????????? ??????? in my view refers to the kind of life where one's pride
is not broken by the circumstances, and that one can only preserve one's
pride ????? only with  qualities like ???????-??????-????.
