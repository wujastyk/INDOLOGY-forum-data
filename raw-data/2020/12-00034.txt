Dear List.

A friend not on the list has asked me the following question:

"A quick question: where can I find out more about

Anjaneya taila chikitsa   ie Hanuman oil massage?

Is this some kind of traditional medical/herbal massage?"

Does Jan Meulenbeld have anything to say about this in his work.

Thanks in advance for any information.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey
