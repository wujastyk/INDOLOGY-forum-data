With pleasure. I take the opportunity to correct a lapse that Prof.  
Isaacson kindly pointed out to me. For the sake of convenience, I had  
copied the Bhart?hari stanza from GRETIL, adapted the orthography to  
Kosambi's editions
and only corrected the obvious typo /m??kha/. However, I forgot to  
remove the space following /pracalad/?, because the latter is, of  
course, the first member of the compound /pracalad?rmim?l?kulam/ (if  
only because /pracalad /cannot refer to the masculine /samudram/). In  
our translation: "von UNGEST?MEN Wellenkr?nzen aufgew?hlt".

prasahya ma?im uddharen makaravaktrada???r?ntar?t
samudram api sa?taret pracalad?rmim?l?kulam /
bhuja?gam api kopita? ?irasi pu?pavad dh?rayet
na tu pratinivi??am?rkhajanacittam ?r?dhayet //

(Bhart?hari, /N?ti?ataka/, ed. Kosambi 1946: 1.4; ed. Kosambi 1948: 1.9)

While I'm correcting: Please read /?abda??stram /instead of  
/??bda??stram /(a true typo) in CC's second stanza.

Best regards,
Roland
