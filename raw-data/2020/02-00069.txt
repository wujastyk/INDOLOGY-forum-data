Message-ID: <20200219100822.871.qmail@f6mail-235-77.rediffmail.com>


Respected Scholars,About the 3 kayas in Buddhism, namely-Nirmana Kaya, Dharma Kaya, Sambhoga Kaya, I would prefer a question, as to whether they are post -Nagarjuna or framed by Nagarjuna himself?May I kindly be enlightened on this issue.
Alakendu Das.
