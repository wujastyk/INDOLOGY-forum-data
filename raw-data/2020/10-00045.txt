Dear Colleagues,



although for linguistic reasons probably only of interest to a small
percentage of list subscribers, I would like to draw your attention to the
following set of new publications in the German language. It contains:


1) B?hler?s Sanskrit Primer in a new typesetting (with continuous
references to the respective paragraphs in Kielhorn),

2) Kielhorn as a reprint, and

3) Study materials consisting of

a) a Key to the Exercises,

b) B?hler?s ?Third Book of Sanskrit? with

c) a Glossary by Eugen Hultzsch

Each volume can also be purchased separately at a price of EUR 35,--, but
as a triplet at an unbeatable discount price of only EUR 59,--.
