Measuring number of claps, correlating with the number of pandas, what is

the poet through some constructive criticism from your side, without
involving comments of others made with good intentions.

Sorry, Dr (?) Christian Ferstl for engaging with such unwarranted
discussion. I am sure you will understand my true appreciation of your
poetic skills.
