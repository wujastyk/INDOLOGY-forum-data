Dear All,

I just got a scan of Ramanujacharya's "Kriya?-vis?es?an?a?na?m? karmatvam"
and wanted to express my gratitude for getting this long saught opportunity
to read this paper, so many thanks for sharing! Also, if anyone happens to
have this paper by Bahulikar, kindly let me know.

Bahulikar, Saudamini, "The constructions stoka? p?ka? and stokam
p?ka?", *Proceedings
and Transactions of the All India Oriental Conference*, 22, pp. 93-98.
(1966)
