Dear Jonathan,

The journals hompepage is here
https://read.dukeupress.edu/cssaame/
but searching for ?Hertel? or ?Neubert? does not yield anything.
Maybe one could write to the editors and ask?

Best,
Agnes

Dear Friends,

In its entry on Johannes Hertel, Iranicaonline refers to the following:
Frank Neubert, ?German Indology, Aryan Studies and Anti-Semitism: The Case of Johannes Hertel,? in Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East, vol. III, 2003 (forthcoming).

Whatever happened to this piece, it did not appear in this journal (despite it having been cited at least once as if it did, itself interesting...). Was it ever published?

Jonathan
