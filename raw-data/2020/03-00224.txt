In-Reply-To: <CAAPrgbooJT_Qk4f7z7CdS=86dW5oqCVEWsdVuYyJUwhkM45u7w@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_POL30d_i0aEkbBnnasPGgAvLhsa-kPJz91mJQ-Axk-Q@mail.gmail.com>

A new area of research.  The possibility of new research papers is endless
such as:
"Viral gender in sanskrit, a joint medical and linguistic study"
"Non-retroflexion, evidence of modern loan-words in sanskrit"
"Change and continuity in modern sanskrit discussion, ??????, ?????, ????? "
"Transmission of linguistic forms in sanskrit"
