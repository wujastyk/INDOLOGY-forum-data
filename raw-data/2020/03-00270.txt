By the way, Colebrooke already described the phenomenon in 1808:

"By poetical license, a vowel may be short before certain conjuncts  
(viz., /pra/ and /hra/; as also /bra/ and /kra/. [/.../]."
(H. T. Colebrooke, "On Sanskrit and Pr?krit Poetry", in:  
/Miscellaneous Essays/, Vol. 3, London 1873, p. 65)

In his PhD thesis of 1988 Michael Balk noted the same metrical license  
for the /Ud?navarga/ (especially for the case of /pr/- and /br/-). See  
M. Balk: /Untersuchungen zum Ud?navarga. Unter Ber?cksichtigung  
mittelindischer Parallelen und eines tibetischen Kommentars/. Marburg  
2011 (Indica et Tibetica. 53), pp. 39-42.
