>From what I have seen, it is clear that, generally speaking, these are ?translations? of the Sanskrit VP, and not ?transcreations? in the terminology of Purushottam Lal (and AK Ramanujan). That is, they largely have a one-to-one textual correspondence with the Sanskrit (?ivad?sa) version.
I imagine there are other examples of such kath? anthologies that were translated rather than transcreated (Si?h?sana?, ?uka?, Pa?catantra, etc.).
