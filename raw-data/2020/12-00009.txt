Subject: [INDOLOGY] What are the ways to express pervasion (vIpsA) in Sanskrit?
Message-ID: <CAPNpus1N95CWm-jej1PfM8SbZncB5E554EH4RP2SpzTG=PWwtA@mail.gmail.com>

As far as I know, pervasion can be expressed more or less three ways in
Sanskrit:

1. Iteration (*?mre?ana*): v?k?a? v?k?a? si?cati
2. Avyay?bh?va compound: with the particles *prati, pari *and *anu *when
compounded as the first members, as in *pratyartham, pratyekam, pratidinam,
anudinam *etc.
3. The secondary suffix (taddhita) *?as: *This suffix is used with numerals
and words in the singular number. Such as eka?a? (one by one), pa?ca?a?
(five by five), var?a?a? (to each Var?a). The words with the suffix ?as
behave like adverbs.

The P??inian s?tra for karmapravacan?yas *prati, pari *and* anu*
(*lak?a?etthambh?t?khy?nabh?gav?ps?su
pratiparyanava? 1.4.90*) also says that these adnominals can be used in
these senses, one of which is v?ps? (pervasion):
1. Lak?a?a (characteristic mark in direction): *v?k?a? prati vidyotate
vidyut *(lightning flashes towards the tree).
In this sense, *prati* can make avyay?bh?va compounds as well. *pratyagni
?alabh?? patanti* (the moths are falling towards fire) [*lak?a?en?bhiprat?
?bhimukhye 2.1.14*]

2. itthambh?t?khy?na there(description of one who is like that): s?dhur
devadatto m?tara? prati (Devadatta is good to his mother)

3. bh?ga (share): *yad m?? prati sy?d* (which should be to me [my share])

4. *v?ps? (pervasion)*: *v?k?a? v?k?a? prati si?cati* (s/he waters every
tree). In this sense, there can be avyay?bh?va compound: *pratidinam* =
every day

I looked into the commentaries and found that Jay?ditya says these meanings
are expressed through the context *(vi?ayabh?ta) *and the function of these
adnominals (karmapravacan?ya) is to establish a relation. This example, *v?k?a?
v?k?a? prati si?cati* was given by Jay?ditya in the K??ik?.
Jinendrabuddhi says that the pervasion (v?ps?) is already expressed by
iteration (*?mre?ana* or *dvirukti*), the adnominal (*karmapravacan?ya*)
*prati *is to express the relationship between the action (watering) and
the trees. But then it goes against the fundamental definition of
adnominals (connected to nominals) and behaves like an upasarga (preverb)
[upasarg?? kriy?yoge]. But then the commentators leave it as a special case
saying that although it is connected to the action we won't call it an
upasarga because upasargas would involve other kinds of changes. Had it
been the upasarga it would have been *v?k?a? v?k?a? prati?i?cati. *The
non-retroflexion of the sibilant here allows us to consider it a
karmapravacan?ya and not an *upasarga*.

I think that P??ini made things a bit complicated here stating all these 4
meanings of the adnominal *prati, pari *and* anu. *All these we can
translate with the English preposition 'towards' or 'to'. But I think when
P??ini thought of a directional use, he thought of physical objects. In the
case of the example, *s?dhur devadatto m?taram prati *(Devadatta is good to
his mother) we cannot perceive a physical direction. So, he postulated
these meanings and later commentators had trouble in explaining those. So,
I would translate *v?k?a? v?k?a? si?cati *as "s/he waters every tree"
and* v?k?a?
v?k?a? prati si?cati *as "s/he waters towards every tree" (if this makes
sense at all).

I am wondering if there are secondary materials available on these issues.
I checked Joshi and Roodbergen's and Rama Nath Sharma's translations of the
A???dhy?y?. There I did not find anything more than what Sanskrit
commentators said. But it would be great to find some new researches on
this issue.
