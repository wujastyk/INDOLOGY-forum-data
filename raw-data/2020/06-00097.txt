Subject: [INDOLOGY] Moral economy of the Petavatthu pdf
Message-ID: <36976.159.147.33.169.1592044602.squirrel@www.cantab.net>

Dear list members,

I am looking for a soft copy of Jeffrey Shirkey's PhD dissertation,
"The Moral Economy of the Petavatthu: Hungry Ghosts and Theravada Buddhist
Cosmology." I would be most grateful if someone could share it.

Many thanks and best wishes,
Aleix
