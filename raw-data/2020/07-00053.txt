Subject: [INDOLOGY] Shabdaratnavali missing pages request
Message-ID: <CADSGPzXjOUF__zvf+iJ5RkcY4B5xS_aMdvUEHOa+4U+-jdV+BA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Scholars,
If anyone of you have access to this work, kindly share with me the second
page of the table of content and the first page of ?abdaratn?val? of
Mathure?a.
https://archive.org/details/SabdarRatnavaliAsiaticSocietyMathuresa_201710/mode/2up
seems to be missing these two pages.
With regards,

--
