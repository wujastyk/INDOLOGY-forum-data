Dear Nataliya,?
While not commentarial on translation?per s?, I have an article that has just come out in the Wiley-Blackwell's Companion to World Literature in which I try to use the aesthetic sensibilities of the Rgveda to imagine what it would consider essential to a graceful translation itself (hint: the enigma of the imagery has to remain, well... enigmatic). It is aimed at a comparative lit audience rather than a strictly philological one, but if you would like a copy, I am happy to send you a PDF.
Best,Caley?
