Subject: [INDOLOGY] Rigveda Samhita with New Vedic fonts
Message-ID: <CAODNnZjWEiLWJRPiZ6Vy-1K3Dj-BL=TBtO77uoc7POiBn_k2mA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all
I am attaching a pdf of Rgveda with newly developed Vedic fonts. For only
the first mantra I used double svara due to time constraints. Also to
indicate the padapatha I have used a gap similar to Satwalekar's editions.
Any changes required please let me know.

Thanks all
KP
