Dear Professor Zydenbos,

Just for the record: I shared this article not because I think that there
is anything worthwhile about it - it seemed so obviously flawed that I
didn't think that needed pointing out. I do however think it is a good
article to know about - the whole 'Sanskrit and computers' story is one of
the main ways in which Sanskrit is being talked about in public. We as
Sanskritists are best placed to counter such myth and misinformation, and
to do that, it helps to know what is out there.

Mostly what *I* find sad is that there are so many unquestionably wonderful
things about knowledge of Sanskrit that go happily ignored by a public
apparently interested in Sanskrit - and instead, it's this misinformation
that takes root. I'm always happy when I hear about initiatives such as
Patrick's that try and do something against this - it would be such a shame
to just cede the field to those with political/nationalist agendas.

All the very best,
      Antonia
