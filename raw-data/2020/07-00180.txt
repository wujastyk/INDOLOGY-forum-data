There is discussion of the relative chronology of the B?had?ra?yaka
upani?ad in Bronkhorst's *Greater Magadha,* esp. chapter IIA.3 and in part
III Chronology.  The discussion is mainly in the context of the doctrine of
Y?j?avalkya's teachings and ?tman, karman and punarjanman, and does not
discuss the ???v?syopani?ad specifically.

Best,
Dominik
