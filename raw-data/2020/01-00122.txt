I searched for "m?yik" in order to allow for and discount any possible sandhi combinations of the first and last vowel of the word. The text available at GRETIL does not say what edition was input. Probably the word you are seeking occurs in a different edition.Best regards,David ReigleColorado, U.S.A.On Wed, Jan 22, 2020 at 1:18 AM jhakgirish via INDOLOGY <indology at list.indology.info> wrote:Dear Mr Das,Thanks for your reply.But I seek the reference as to the Skandha , Adhyaya and shloka? No.where it has been used in the Srimad Bhagavata Purana.?????? refers to the meaning that Shrikrishna is beyond the grip of the Maya and Maya is his servant.I have not that edition of the SrimadBhagavata in which exhaustive Word Index is contained.RegardsGirish K. Jha
