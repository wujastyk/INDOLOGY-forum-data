Dear David, dear Friends,

As always, David, your indications are most valuable. In one small respect
however we now have a most wonderful resource which can enhance our use of
canonical Tibetan materials, namely the database of the Resources for
Kanjur Tanjur Studies from Vienna, conceived by Helmut Tauscher, built by
Bruno Lain? and now also with the collaboration of Markus Viehbeck.
Regarding the two versions of the K?lacakra mentioned, there are further
sources now available than those mentioned by David (no doubt on the basis
of his extensive notes built in the days when we had only paper catalogues).
See

My own project (openphilology.eu) is working with partners including the
Vienna project and Esukhia (https://esukhia.net/) toward full digitization
of the Tibetan corpora, although that goal is still a bit in the future.
Ultimately we hope that all canonical collections will be available not
only in scans (which for most witnesses can already be accessed via the
Vienna site) but also in unicode. (See in this regard already the very
valuable https://adarsha.dharma-treasure.org/home/kangyur).

Haappy reading!

Jonathan
