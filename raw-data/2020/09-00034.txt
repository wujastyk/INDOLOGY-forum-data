Subject: [INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] sources on markers of girls' transition to adulthood

So, for what it is worth, Kull?ka on the MS passage regards the verse to be more of a recommendation than a rule. etac ca yogyak?lapradar?anapara? na tu niyam?rtham. He also puts bit of thought into the term satvara?, ?if in haste? which appears to be rendered as ?sooner? in the translations offered.  Kull?ka  understands that a girl who has reached the  age of menstruation is a suitable bride for a youth who has completed his vedic studies and made his parting gift to his guru since such a  youth should not then delay in entering the stage of a householder. Hence, he says, the term satvara?, ?in haste? is specified.  tribh?gavayask? ca kany? vo?hur y?no yogyeti g?h?taveda? copakurv??ako g?hasth??rama? prati na vilambeteti satvara ity artha?.

Cheers to all.

According to the latter?s testimony there were ?c?ryas who stipulated intercourse with prepubescent married girls lacking pubic hair, if these girls themselves desired so:

>>  
>>    The end of the above passage uses the quote fromthe Brahm???a-Pur??a to argue that the word gaura? used by Pata?jali in defining a Br?hma?a does not refer to the skin color, but it has a Dharma??stric significance as "the son of a woman who was given at her age of eight to a learned and righteous Brahmin."  The same quote is used by the great N?ge?abha??a in one of his commentaries. I have cited that in one of my publications, and I have to hunt down that reference.  But it is exactly the same argument.
>>    On a personal level, the history of my own family shows the gradual change from that old standard for the age of marriage.  My grandmother was married when she was 9.  My two paternal aunts were married at the age of 14 or 15, and since that was considered rather too late, they were married to widowers.  My own mother was married at her age of 16.  This is an interesting trajectory of history within a single family.
