Dear Harry,

Please read the whole Chapter 16 ?Astronomy, Time-Reckoning, and Cosmology? of my book ?The Roots of Hinduism? (OUP 2015) for evidence on the basis of which I suggest that the basic ideas of the Ku??alin?-yoga and the tortoise as representing the setting/night sun (and the yogi restraining his senses) go back to the Indus Civilization.

With best wishes,  Asko Parpola

I don?t know of any clear references to this idea in texts, but one often sees Ku??alin? supported by a tortoise in ?cakra scrolls? from the 17th century onwards. See the attached image for an example.
