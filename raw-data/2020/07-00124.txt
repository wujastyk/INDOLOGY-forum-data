Dear John,

in this regard I can warmly recommend The Centre for the Study of
Manuscript Cultures (CSMC) in Hamburg:
https://www.manuscript-cultures.uni-hamburg.de/index_e.html

The researchers there are fully equipped with a variety of different
instruments to digitalize and further analyze manuscripts and writing
materials on the go, if necessary also only with light baggage, they
surely might be of help for you. A sub-project also is invested in
developing a model for pattern analysis in manuscripts.

Best,


Raik Strunz

Adeline Levivier, Visual Data Manager for the DHARMA project, whom you
see in action in this photo, has conceived this cube-shaped tent with
movable LEDs and obtained excellent result for photographing copper
plates during our fieldwork in Bangladesh last year. If there is
interest, I can ask her to write up a description of how to build this
very portable contraption.

?Dear John, I've never tried to buy one, but there's an "order" button
on this web page:

* https://readcoop.eu/scantent/

If you do get one, I'd love to hear your experience with it.  If it's as
good as it sounds, I'll get one too.  I don't have thousands of images
like you, but I do some manuscript photography in India from time to
time.  I've used a downward-facing Nikon on a tripod with a remote
shutter release in the past.  Good results, but quite a fiddly setup,
and good light is usually difficult.

Best,
Dominik

Dear Dominik
I was truly excited by your note on the Transksribus not so much by the
project itself but by the scan tent that they are using. As you may know
I have been both an art historian and  photographer of fine arts, of
primarily Buddhist art, for five decades and the scan tent they are
using with its internal lighting and ease of object manipulation seems
ideal for some of our work. To that end I have tried to find one in the
photographic equipment market. No luck. Do you have any idea where such
a tool might be available?


Sorry to bother you with this but there are a couple of thousand flat
images to prepare for the Archive, it will be a great service to me if
you know. 


Thank you 


John Huntington
