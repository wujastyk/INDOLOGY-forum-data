Dear Madhav,

for a detailed refutation of the Advaitaved?nta position in the ?aivasiddh?nta text, see Paramok?anir?sak?rik?, verses 2b (p?rvapak?a) and 49?52 (pp. 231?236 and 423?441 in Alex Watson's translation).

In the introduction (pp. 23?27), Alex discusses the question of what kind of Advaitaved?nta it is, and develops Alexis Sanderson's argument that while Sadyojyoti? is arguing against pari??mav?da, the commentator R?maka??ha already knows m?y?v?da of Mandanami?ra and ?a?kara. However, Alex demonstrates that R?maka??ha seems to refute some third type of Advaitaved?nta here.

Best
Lubomir
