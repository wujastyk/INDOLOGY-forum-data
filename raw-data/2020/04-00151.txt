Dear Dean,



thanks to Harry Spier, who referred to a previous thread, you?ve already
received

numerous references addressing your bibliographic question concerning
?which texts

are considered to be from which Shankara? comprising decades of research by
scholars,

and some major names (such as Nakamura, Hacker, Halbfass) had likewise
already

been mentioned in the course of this thread.

Unfortunately, Potter?s online Bibliography is hopelessly incomplete

(https://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/xsec.htm#[AV]),

yet going through it might also help you getting references related to your

earlier request (? 'avidya' or 'mithya' rather than 'maya' ? scholarly
discussion of

these terms and the associated concepts ?).

E.g., neither Sengaku Mayeda?s *A Thousand Teachings *(1992) nor

Govind Chandra Pande?s *Life and Thought of ?a?kar?c?rya* (1994), both
containing

significant discussions (and further references) related to your request,
are mentioned.

Neither is Vidyasankar Sundaresan?s important article

?What determines ?a?kara?s Authorship? The Case of the Pa?c?kara?a?,

*Philosophy East & West*, vol. 52.1 (2002): 1-35.

Among the numerous works (often discussing technical terms) of Sri Swami

Satchid?nandendra [spelling as on the title page], not least the one
translated by

A. J. Alston under the title *The Method of the Vedanta. A Critical Account
of *

*the Advaita Tradition* (Delhi, Motilal, 1997) might be relevant for you

(adding to that made by others [cf. references provided by the indicated
previous

thread], for a concise scathing critique of ascribing the *Vivekac???ma?i*
to ?a?kara,

the author of *Brahmas?trabh??ya*, see p. 22).



Studying all of these works might keep you busy for quite some time.



All the best, Hartmut

Writing in English deprives my lines of the majesty of Sanskrit. However what English lacks in the melody and rhythms of Sanskrit it will hopefully make up in its rasa.Wait O! Advaitin, before I accept your mayavadaLet me tarry a bit and enjoy the lotus face of Krishna.Kind regards,HarshaProf. Harsha V. Dehejia
