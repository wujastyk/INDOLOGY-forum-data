Just thinking out loud: I wonder if there is a way to crowd-source
correction of such metadata.
As all of us who have used Archive.org know, finding things is often a real
matter of hit and miss, since so many things are put up with either wrong
or horribly incomplete data. Moreover, one of the first things I noticed in
the Canadian data is that there seem to be cases where all the diacritical
letters in a title have either disappeared, or simply do not appear on
screen -- I didn't do any systematic sort of survey. But the resources are
wonderful and often really crucial for us, most especially in this lockdown
situation, so it would be a positive thing if there were a way to make the
resource better.
