Subject: [INDOLOGY] Masica on Language X pdf?
Message-ID: <E3A6AB42-E802-4D8F-B54D-8A2D32E9C12F@fas.harvard.edu>

Dear All, a colleague (not on our list) has asked me for a pdf of:


Masica, Colin: Aryan and Non-Aryan elements in North Indian agriculture. In Deshpande, M. M., and P. E. Hook, Eds. Aryan and Non-Aryan in India. Ann Arbor: Karoma. 1979

Though I have the book, I cannot get to our offices/library now.
Any help is greatly appreciated!

Michael
