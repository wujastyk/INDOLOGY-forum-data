Dear Prof. Zydenbos,
thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience from years of  
teaching with us all! Finally there is a textbook for Kannada that is  
really recommendable and in addition easily accessible to all!
Best regards,
Anna Esposito

> Indological matters? (this  is a hint. Encouragement. Prodding). Kannada
> is a conservative language,  which has remained largely unchanged for the

> This learner?s manual of  standard modern written Kannada was written for
> use at the University of  Munich and tested in teaching practice with
> students over the past few  years, but it can also be used for
> self-learning. The focus is on the  written language (which is the only
> truly sensible thing to do, as is  explained on pp. x-xi), but there are
> occasional remarks about speech  variations in regional and colloquial
> usage. The grammar is covered in  19 lessons, followed by appendices about
> the phonemic system and script,  numerals, strong verbs, colloquialisms,
> and sandhi. Experience has  shown that the material in the book can be
> studied in the classroom with  4 hours of weekly teaching very easily
> within an academic year (30  weeks of teaching), and a few times this was
> accomplished with a group  of students within a single winter term.
