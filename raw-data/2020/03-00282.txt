Dear Colleagues,

Apologies for cross-posting. I am pleased to draw your attention to the
publication of a new volume in Gonda Indological Studies (GIS 21):

Elizabeth A. Cecil, *Mapping the P??upata Landscape: Narrative, Place, and
the ?aiva Imaginary in Early Medieval North India*

In *Mapping the P??upata Landscape: Narrative, Place, and the ?aiva
Imaginary in Early Medieval North India*, Elizabeth A. Cecil explores the
sacred geography of the earliest community of ?iva devotees called the
P??upatas. This book brings the narrative cartography of the
*Skandapur??a* into
conversation with physical landscapes, inscriptions, monuments, and icons
in order to examine the ways in which P??upatas were emplaced in regional
landscapes and to emphasize the use of material culture as media through
which notions of belonging and identity were expressed. By exploring the
ties between the formation of early P??upata communities and the locales in
which they were embedded, this study reflects critically upon the ways in
which community building was coincident with place-making in Early Medieval
India.

Thanks to the generous support of the J. Gonda Foundation, the E-book is
also available via Open Access on Brill's website. You can access the book
