Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone happen to have an access to a scanned version of the following
publication:

*T?htinen, Unto (1964) **Non-violence as an ethical principle with special
reference to the views of Mahatma Gandhi**.* *Turku: Turun Yliopisto *
*Julkaisuja*?

I?ve been trying to get a copy, but in vain - at the time when all
libraries are closed. I?d greatly appreciate a copy.

Best regards

Piotr Balcerowicz
