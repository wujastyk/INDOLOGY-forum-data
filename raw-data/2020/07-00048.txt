Subject: [INDOLOGY] Overseas students and online teaching (US)

Overseas students have never been able to get a student visa to live in the
US for online only education. So this ruling should not impact universities
that are already online-only.

However, this could impact tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of overseas
students already in the US. It threatens to force students already living
in the worst-hit by covid country in the world to leave everything behind
(I can only imagine the headache of rents and roommates and belongings and
etc.) and potentially risk the health of everyone they come across on the
journey "home" (assuming everyone has a safe home to return to) while
simultaneously risking the health of everyone who works in higher education
across the country by forcing them to return to closed spaces.

It also takes the decision-making away from universities and puts those
decisions in the hands of the US' Immigration and Customs Enforcement and
Department of Homeland Security, which are entirely separate from the US
Citizenship and Immigration Services.
