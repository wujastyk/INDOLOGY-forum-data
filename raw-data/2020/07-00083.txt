Dear Alakendu Das,

There is no "proof" of this, but it is certainly a very old and widespread tradition.
The important Mah?y?na scripture, the La?k?vat?ras?tra, which dates in its present form to about the early fifth century C.E.,
is in part based on this tradition, for example, and therefore shows that it must have been current before this time.

Perhaps the rapid and successful implantation of Buddhism in Sri Lanka encouraged the development and acceptance of the legend.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka

Respected Scholars,
I had posted this query in the past
.May I be excused to raise it once again , as I haven't got any answer to it.
I quote from "Dipavamsa" the oldest Pali Chronicle , from Sri Lanka,which goes as follows-

"DipAgamanam Buddhassa Dhatu ca Bodhiyagamam"
I would like to stress on the word"DipAgamanam Buddhassa"

My question is whether any evidence exists which goes on to prove that Siddharth Gautam Buddha  visited Sri Lanka?

Alakendu Das.
