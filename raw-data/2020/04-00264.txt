Dear list members,
I'm trying to translate the ku??alin?-stava? but I'm finding quite a few
obscurities in it.  The latest is in verse 3.  I'm not clear the meaning
of  sthala-gatir in this context and how it relates to the rest of the
verse.
Verse 3 is:

siddh?rth? nija-do?a-vit sthala-gatir vy?j?yate vidyay?

ku??aly? kula-m?rga-mukta-nagar?-m?y?-kum?rga? ?riy?

yadyeva? bhajati prabh?ta-samaye madhy?hnak?le 'thav?

nitya? ya? kula-ku??al?-japa-pad?mbhoja? sa siddho bhavet


In line 1 is it nija-do?a-vit sthala-gatir or nija-do?a-vit-sthala-gatir
and what is the meaning of  sthala-gatir  and how does it connect to the
rest of the verse?

Thanks,

Harry Spier
