Dear colleagues,

I have tried in vain to trace a set of passages which Baladeva VIdy?bh??a?a
(18th c) cites in his commentary on R?pa Gosv?min's *Yamun???aka *in the
*Stavam?l?*. Each time he cites them as "*tann?mastotre" *with the
*tad *contextually
presumably referring to Yamun?. I've listed the citations below, with the
hope that someone here might recognize these or be able somehow to point me
in the right direction. The only lead I managed to uncover was what appears
to be a Pu??i-m?rg?ya (because of the words "?r?k???a? ?ara?a? mama" in
Gujurati script) photocopied document someone uploaded onto Scribd with a
picture of K???a's feet and a list of all the traditional marks on either
side, with then 30 feminine names listed below. When put together, these
names clearly form anu??hubh verses: *tray? rasamay? ?aur? brahmavidy?
sudh?vah?...*

Thanks,
Dave Buchta

Here are the citations:
*?ara??gatasantr??anipu??*
*mah?p?takabhe?aj?*
*saptas?garasa?gat?*
*nilotpaladala?y?m?*
*k?lind? k?lasalil?*
*brahmavidy? br?hm?*
*t?pin? yamun? y?m?*
