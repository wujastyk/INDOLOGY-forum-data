I'm not sure this is a fair representation of the current scientific
paradigm.  Of course it depends on whom in the scientific community you
listen to.  I've been watching some of the online lectures by Roger Penrose
recently (he just got a Nobel).  He's proposing some very interesting and
definitely non-physical speculations about the non-computable nature of
consciousness.  He's not mainstream on these topics, at least amongst
physicists, but he is a major voice.  And there are others too, in the
rapidly-evolving field of consciousness studies.  There has always been a
philosophical stream in Physics that thinks creatively about the
consequences of quantum mechanics, such as non-locality, quantum
entanglement, etc.  Henry Pierce Stapp, David Bohm, etc.  And anyway, is
electromagnetic radiation, for example, best thought of as a "material
phenomenon"?  Perhaps the science paradigm is not best thought about as
material vs. nonmaterial, but as falsifiable vs. metaphysical.

Best,
Dominik
