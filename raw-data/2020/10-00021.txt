SUMMARY: The present book contains the entire Sanskrit text of 
Haribha??a?s J?takam?l? (ca. AD 400), as far as it has been preserved 
in a few manuscripts presently accessible to us. Haribha??a?s work 
belongs to the Buddhist genre of ?Garlands of stories about previous 
lives of the Buddha? and represents a rare specimen of early Sanskrit 
poetry written in the Camp? style. Since 1904 when scholars first 
learned about Haribha??a?s J?takam?l? from Tibetan sources, it was 
assumed that the Sanskrit work has been irretrievably lost and that it 
has survived only in its Tibetan translation. Although in the 1970s 
some parts of the original Sanskrit text were discovered and later 
made known in various publications by the late Professor Michael 
Hahn, a complete and handy edition of the entire work did not appear 
in print. The present book aims to close this gap by offering a critical 
re-edition of all parts which have been previously published, and by 
supplying new editions of those parts which have not been published 
before. The Sanskrit text is fully annotated with text-critical notes and 
explanatory comments, and is followed by various indices and a 
glossary of unknown and noteworthy words.

"Haribha??a?s J?takam?l?" will appeal to scholars in the fields of 
Buddhist and Sanskrit studies, as well as to connoisseurs of Sanskrit 
poetry. To meet the needs of the latter the text has been printed in 
Devanagari script with the critical annotations confined to the end of 
the book.
