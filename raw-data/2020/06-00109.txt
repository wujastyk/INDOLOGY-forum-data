Dear Madhav,

Voiceless (agho.sa) consonants generally raise the pitch on neighboring syllables, voiceless (gho.savat) consonants lower it, especially voiced aspirated consonants. I don?t know whether there is a similar difference between plain and aspirated voiceless consonants.

My former student, Indranil Dutta, wrote his dissertation on the properties of aspirated and plain stops in Hindi. He?s now at EFLU Hyderabad. If you would like, I can send you his contact from my work computer

All the best

Hans

Dear Professor Deshpande,

There are such studies, and you will find them by searching for "intrinsic pitch," "intrinsic fundamental frequency," and "intrinsic F0." I'm not an expert in this area at all, but you might take as a starting point Carlos Gussenhoven's 2004 The Phonology of Tone and Intonation ?1.4.3, ?3.6.1, and ?5.3.3.

Wishing you all the best,

Dieter Gunkel

I have been wondering if there are any phonetic studies of the different inherent pitches for various vowels and consonants. Is Sanskrit ? intrinsically higher in pitch compared to ? ? and ??
