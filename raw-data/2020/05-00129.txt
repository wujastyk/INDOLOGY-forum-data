Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tilopa's Mahamudra Gangama (also called the Ganges Mahamudra)
Message-ID: <3F0D58E8-A71B-451A-8C2A-22024CC54E0F@gmail.com>

Hi 

Does anyone know of an extant (ideally digital edited) Sanskrit text of Mahamudra Upadesa Gangama (also called the Ganges Mahamudra)? 
A colleague not on the Indology list asked.

Cheers
James
