Dear Tim,

You can use RomDev available at https://indology.info/etexts/archive/soft/ <https://indology.info/etexts/archive/soft/> and MacTex/TexLive mentioned in Dominik?s posting. I have been using these on a Mac since 2013, when I could not coax MacDevnag and TexLive to produce texts longer than 2 or 3 pages. I also found articles at https://cikitsa.blogspot.com <https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/> (Dominik?s site).

Best,

Elliot

I am going to appease them for now by upgrading to Mojave, which can run 32-bit (yes, I am an update laggard, still running [Low] Sierra!), but that is inevitably just a temporary fix.  I confess to being only semi-literate in LaTeX and XeLaTeX, so I may have missed a crucial new development.
