Dear all,

Does anyone happen to have a bibliography or collection of texts on
p?ka??stra? A student of mine is interested. A pdf of the following book
would also be helpful:

Ksemakutuhalam (Classical Treatise on Health Care, Dietetics and Cookery
Culinary Science) Chowkhamba Krishnadas Academy,2014

All the Best,
Victor
