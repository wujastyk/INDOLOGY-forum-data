I have seen the interchangeable use of ???/??? in published books from
Maharashtra ???????/????????, but ??????????, and this variation is also
seen in the Marathi usage of these words.  The popular Marathi poem is
written as ???? ????????? ??????? rather than as ???????.  But you have
??????-????????-???, ???????? etc. and ???????/??? almost with equal
frequency.  This variation is facilitated by the fact that while ? and ?
are distinguished in Marathi writing, they are not distinguished in
pronunciation, except by a few ultra-conscious Sanskritists of Pune like
the Late Professor Arjunwadkar in my memory.  Here is a good example of
this variation on the same page:
