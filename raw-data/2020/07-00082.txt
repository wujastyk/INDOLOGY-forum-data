Subject: [INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka
Message-ID: <20200712132033.1704.qmail@f4mail-235-225.rediffmail.com>

Respected Scholars,I had posted this query in the past.May I be excused to raise it once again , as I haven't got any answer to it.I quote from "Dipavamsa" the oldest Pali Chronicle , from Sri Lanka,which goes as follows-
"DipAgamanam Buddhassa Dhatu ca Bodhiyagamam"I would like to stress on the word"DipAgamanam Buddhassa"
My question is whether any evidence exists which goes on to prove that Siddharth Gautam Buddha&nbsp; visited Sri Lanka?
