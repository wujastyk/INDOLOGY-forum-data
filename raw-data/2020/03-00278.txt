It was just pointed out to me off-list that  the  g?yatr? to ga?e?a
in the ga?e??tharva??rsam,
, the meter is called  nic?dg?yatr? = broken  g?yatr?, but I don't see why
the meter is called "broken g?yatr? .  Its three lines of 8 syllables
each.  Or are there other rules for  g?yatr? meter other than number of
syllables.

sai?? ga?e?avidy? | ga?aka ??i? | nic?dg?yatr? chanda? | ga?apatir devat? |
o? ga? ||

ekadant?ya vidmahe vakratu???ya dh?mahi | tan no dant? pracoday?t ||

Thanks,

Harry Spier
