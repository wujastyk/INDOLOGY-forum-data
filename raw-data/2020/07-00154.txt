Further, there is a collection of stotras to the Navagrahas and Ca?ipakav?? which is also available in the Tamil Digital Library under the following title:

Dear list members,

I would be grateful for any reference to pre-modern Tamil literary texts (or Sanskrit texts that originated from the Tamil-akam) that mention Navagraha-worship and the worship of Saturn in particular.

Many thanks,

Ofer Peres.
