*Sanskrit Traditions in the Modern World *

*Friday 29th May 2020 *
Trinity College, Oxford

The STIWM symposium for 2020 will take place in Oxford on Friday 29th May
at Trinity College (Sutro Room). We invite proposals for papers from both
established and rising academics on any aspects of South Asia?s
rich Sanskrit religious and intellectual culture. Sanskrit Traditions in
the Modern World (STIMW) is a forum for the discussion of the Sanskrit
traditions of South Asia, and the texts and cultures that have risen out of
them.

Proposals of no more 300 words should be submitted by *Friday 27th March
2020*.

Please send your proposal to *stimw at ochs.org.uk <stimw at ochs.org.uk> *.

More information about STIMW can be found here:

Manchester can be found here:

*Papers and Format *- Papers are presented by leading scholars in the field
as well as by research students. Papers are pre-circulated so that
participants can read them before the seminar to ensure the best possible
use of discussion time.  Papers are therefore not read out at the seminar
itself but instead briefly introduced by the chair who will then raise
questions to the paper-giver, before opening the discussion. Papers should
be no longer than 20 A4 pages, including notes and references. To
facilitate discussion for those short of reading time, paper-givers should
provide a one-page abstract of the key argument of the paper, along with
their paper.  Please include your email address for further feedback.
