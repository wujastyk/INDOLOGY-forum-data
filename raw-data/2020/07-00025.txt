 From the context, it seems likely that /vidum?la/ should mean 
'retrograde', and indeed, some later text witnesses 'correct' the phrase 
to /kila vakrag?m?/; but I am fairly sure that the lectio difficilior is 
correct here. However, I have been unable to find /vidum?la/ (or 
/dum?la/,? supposing the /vi- /to be a prefix) in any lexicon, and it 
does not seem to be an Arabic term. This makes me wonder if it could be 
a borrowing from a North Indian vernacular. All suggestions would be 
gratefully received.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
