Dear Harry,

thanks a lot for the reference, didn't know this one! Even the wrong accent is noted there already.

Well yes, mantras like these were called G?yatr?s. The matter is a bit complicated though. As far as I have come to understand it, they were called thus because they imitate the famous G?yatr? verse (?gveda III 62.10) or are modified versions of it. But this verse acquired the name ?G?yatr?? rather late (considering its own age), for the first time perhaps in the Taittir?ya-?ra?yaka and then also in later additions the Dharmas?tras (in the Mah?bharata, too, the verse is called G?yatr? several times, especially in the later strata).

So the point is that the modified G?yatr?s were perhaps never actually thought to be in the g?yatr? metre (not even by its creators, whenever they lived), but were only called G?yatr? because they resemble the verse. I normally use g?yatr? for the metre and G?yatr? for the verse (I did not do so in my previous email though). So the modified G?yatr?s are probably not examples for metrical license, i.e., they are not g?yatr? verses, even though they are called G?yatr?s.

But it could very well be that some commentator explained them to be in the g?yatr? metre, but a g?yatr? metre with extra syllables etc.

Best regards,

Dominik

Perhaps a short note on the modified ?G?yatr?s? in the Maitr?ya??-Sa?hit?: the creators of these verses simply inserted a certain deity without too much regard for metre. The non-adjusted accentuation perhaps also shows that the ?G?yatr?s? in this text are more pieced together than composed anew (pracod?y?t is still accented, even though it's now the verb of a main clause ? or is there another explanation?).

Thank you for this Dominik.

The author in the following link, for the reasons you've mentioned and because the gayatris are  mostly to later deities, argues that this section of the  Maitr?ya??-Sa?hit?:   is interpolated:  https://books.google.ca/books?id=X0JUwf2BXVAC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=maitrayani+samhita+x.9.1&source=bl&ots=zfBpMv9w-q&sig=ACfU3U2LME_WHFLc9K4mr4lvOD8UVoCkEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIuojYs8LoAhUImuAKHYHQDPEQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=maitrayani%20samhita%20x.9.1&f=false<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__books.google.ca_books-3Fid-3DX0JUwf2BXVAC-26pg-3DPA57-26lpg-3DPA57-26dq-3Dmaitrayani-2Bsamhita-2Bx.9.1-26source-3Dbl-26ots-3DzfBpMv9w-2Dq-26sig-3DACfU3U2LME-5FWHFLc9K4mr4lvOD8UVoCkEg-26hl-3Den-26sa-3DX-26ved-3D2ahUKEwiIuojYs8LoAhUImuAKHYHQDPEQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ-23v-3Donepage-26q-3Dmaitrayani-2520samhita-2520x.9.1-26f-3Dfalse&d=DwMDaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=tFXzIbyKS2C0TpVqKsMrj46qwsAermBN5wzaDe51So0&m=D4CPG7AdYt2M9wvLgDyU9v4FiVY8uLgVd_HKq5xVfGM&s=wp_nAROr8ZmmHizUXyUIS26tKLO2dbPIOY-F3LTGoLA&e=>

You also asked:
 I wonder whether and where they are actually called G?yatr?s?

If you do a search of the Muktabodha searchable e-text  digital library   for <gAyatrI> you'll see that throughout the tantric literature these types of mantras are called   g?yatr? or g?yatr?matra or  the deity name compounded with  g?yatr?  such as: n?si?hag?yatr?  etc. If I recall correctly they are called  g?yatr? much more often than  g?yatr?mantra.
