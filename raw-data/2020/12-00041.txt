Subject: [INDOLOGY] The source of a quote
Message-ID: <CY4PR0701MB3634BD98062999FE5B76751DBEC30@CY4PR0701MB3634.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Dear List,

Does anybody know the source of the following verse?
devadatto gha??bh?to, gha?a? vetti gha??tman? prak??ate

It appears in the Na???ku?a, a polemical text, perhaps from the 15th century Kerala, against the innovations of the K??iy???am theater. The quote seems to refer to an Advaitin epistemological stance on perception, where the consciousness conditioned by a cognized object becomes identical with the consciousness conditioned by a cognizing subject.

I'll appreciate your help!
Dimitry
