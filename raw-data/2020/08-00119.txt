Dear members, I am following up from H.N. Chakravarty's annotated
translation in S?marasya and am having a difficult time finding the
following title:
Bahur?pagarbhastotra assigned to the Lalitasvacchanda, with the commentary
(-vi?amapadasa?keta) of Ananta?akti, ed. ?ambhun?th R?zd?n. New Delhi: ?r?
L?l Bah?dur ??str? Kendr?ya-Sa?sk?ta-Vidy?p??h, 1986. I am hoping the
kalpav?k?a (which is this list) might be able to point me in a more
fruitful direction, or perhaps even have some type of electronic access.

with all best wishes,
