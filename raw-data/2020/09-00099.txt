Subject: [INDOLOGY] locative of goal
Message-ID: <4c6a8538-6bd4-5047-077e-3c4ac5c7ba2c@gmail.com>

Dear list members,

can anybody point me to the Sutra/Bhashya in which Panini or the later 
Paniniyas state their view(s) regarding the grammaticality of locatives 
that denote the goal of a motion verb like /gam/- (as, e.g., in RV 
7.32.10d /gamat sa gomati vraje/)? Even after hours of searching, I have 
to confess that I failed to find any Sutra/Bhashya vel sim. explicitely 
allowing this particular use of the locative...

NB: I am aware that the (from our perspective intransitive) motion verbs 
count as sakarmakas in native grammar and thus the accusative usually 
applies (apart from some cases in which the dative is licensed as well).

Thanks a lot in advance

Tim
