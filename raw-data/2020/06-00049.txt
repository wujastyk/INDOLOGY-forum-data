Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bikaner RORI
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CfTjQK_4ufqBwpg0kSS3ix0bdcU16YEHwesqCJXZMFMrw@mail.gmail.com>

This is a long shot, but if anybody is in Bikaner in the next year or so, I
would be glad of a copy of a manuscript in the RORI branch office there.
Letter-writing has been of no avail and the MS is not amongst those filmed
by IGNCA.  It's only 12 folios.

Here are details:
