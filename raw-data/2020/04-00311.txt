Dear Colleagues,

Professor Patrick Olivelle has just been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, among the new members for 2020. He is likely to be too modest to share the news with us, so I thought I would let his colleagues, students, friends and admirers know.

With warm congratulations to Professor Olivelle for this well-deserved honour,

Yours,

Ananya Vajpeyi.
