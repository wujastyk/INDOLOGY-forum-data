Dear Harry Spier,

according to my limited knowledge, V?jasaneyins pronounce(d) Anun?sika
before semi-vowels, sibilants and h as "*?g*", represented in writing by a
special sign (as in your edition): ?ata*?* ???uy?ma ? "?ata*?g* ???uy?ma".
Quite similar to how Germans - in the majority of cases - pronounce French
nasalizations, e.g. "Karto*ng*" for "carto*n*"

However, the pronunciation when reciting Sa?hit? texts replaces the
articulation of Anusv?ra with a spoken "gu?". So "t? *gu? *hait?m ..." for
t?*?* hait?m ..."

Your symbol represents an Anusv?ra sign in a particular phonetic
environment.

Vedicists will know better.

Best,
WS
