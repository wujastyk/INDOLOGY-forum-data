Subject: [INDOLOGY] Some Ganesha gayatri mantras
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_Hc3wFu2WM9k2dvR8vwsgJkSFmud9UedcgoPrMdOBngQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I've been asked to verify the authenticity of the following two Ganesha
gayatri mantras.  I.e. if they are not a modern creation. I haven't found
them in either Muktabodha or GRETIL libraries.  Would any of the list
members know a scriptural source or have heard these in a temple ceremony?

Thanks,

Harry Spier
