For my students I made a few help pages on how to type Kannada on Linux, Mac and and Windows machines:

http://lmu.zydenbos.net/kannada/kannada-windows.html
http://lmu.zydenbos.net/kannada/linux/kannada-linux.html

I use the font Kedage for my Kannada work. A number of fonts can be found here: http://kannada.nd4.org/kannada-fonts

(Sorry for this very late response. I was out of station for a few weeks when the original query was sent to the list, and I saw it just now, while cleaning up my computer.)

> Thank you to everyone who replied on and off line.? The font is for a colleague who will be entering small amounts of text (bhajans) and will be having some helpers typing in from home.? So are there on-line or dpwnloadable tools for typing in Kannada text? (keyboards or online sites for text conversion etc.)?
