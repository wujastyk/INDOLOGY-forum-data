Respected scholars,It has long been studied that Akhshapada Gotoma was the one who authored "NyayDarshan".However , of late, I came across one more source, namely a translation of "Nyay Darshan" by Phanibhushan TarkaBagish, which states that Nyay Darshan even existed before Gotama.May someone elaborate on this?Alakendu Das.
