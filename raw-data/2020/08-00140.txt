Dear Patrick,

The text referred to should be the Pi?galacchanda?s?tram, which is printed and discussed in this volume:
https://archive.org/details/pingalachandasutraastudyasokechatterjeesastrichandas_202003_76/mode/2up

8.1 of the text begins: atr?nukta? g?th? (p. 11 of the book).  I don?t see the prat?ka quoted by Medh?tithi, but another book
https://archive.org/details/OriginAndDevelopementOfSanskritMetrics/page/n51/mode/2up
says on p. 37 that the phrase atr?siddha? g?th? used of g?th?s not accepted in a particular tradition, those which are an?kta? in that tradition (if I understand correctly).  I hope this clue leads somewhere.

Best,
Tim

Friends:

I hope someone can lead me in the right direction in identifying this citation given by Medh?tithi (on MDh 9.42) from Pi?gala:

yathokta? pi?galena: "atr?siddha? g?th?? iti |


With thanks,

Patrick
