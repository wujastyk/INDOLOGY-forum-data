Dear all,

?

does anyone know where I could find a copy of this document, online or in a library?

?

Selected Papers, Punjab Police Department, No. XVIII, 1869.

?

These papers are mentioned in Rose?s and Ibbetson?s works on Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and contain a description of the Rawals, a group of Muslim yogis.

?

Best wishes,

?

Fabrizio
