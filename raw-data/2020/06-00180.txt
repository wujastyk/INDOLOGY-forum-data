Subject: [INDOLOGY] Lubotsky RV Word Concordance
Message-ID: <05899d8a-966a-26c9-516e-ab15d38bf998@gmail.com>

Dear list,

does anybody know whether there exists an online-version of Lubotsky's 
two-volume "A Rgvedic Word Concordance"? Any hints (or Pdf...) would be 
highly appreciated.

Thanks and best

Tim
