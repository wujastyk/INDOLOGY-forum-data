Cheers,

Oh, what a said news!

Nick  was such a wise, and, at the same time, kind and straightforward person.

I will miss him and his work.

Nick was a wonderful friend. I met him in Pune as a PhD student in 2001. He wondered up to me at the Bhandarkar and, with his characteristic high-pitched hum, said ?Mmmmm, is that Soren Sorensen?s Index of Names to the Mahabharata?? A friendship commenced then and there (how could it not?).

Nick was an inspiration to me as both a person and as an intellectual; he was unworried by the fashions of the day, inclusive in his interests, and could walk up a mountain like a sprightly goat after good pasture.

I will miss him.

James

So sorry to hear of Nick?s passing. Came to know him well when I was a visiting fellow at Wolfson many years ago.
