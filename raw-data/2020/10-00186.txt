Dear Colleagues,
I would be the last to give the Manusmriti a clean chit or reproach a stance against it. Nevertheless, the politics of Tamil Nadu are torturous and complicated and some issues - the Manusmriti among them - tend to be pulled up at strategic moments in the long history of Dravidian politics  and waved like red flags by men wanting as usual to decide what they need to get indignant about when it comes to ?their mothers, sisters and daughters?. Right now it has become part of the ugly fight between Hindutva forces and those which oppose it. This being said, I  don?t see Professor Rajam as a person who takes a politically aggressive stance against Dalit politics or Thol. Thirumaavalavan. Above all, I don?t think she should be condescended to. 
Kind regards,
Srilata Raman

This has been well-documented in the press.

> With all due respect, Professor Rajam, your query was made explicitly in response to what you called "a severe extremist movement," i.e. the Viduthaliai Chirsuthaigal Katchi, a Dalit political group. You also quite clearly characterized such critiques of the Manusmriti as being by "people who don?t know Sanskrit and who hate Hinduism, brahmins." Critiques of the Manusmriti, especially by Dalits and feminists, do not constitute anti-Hindu or anti-Brahmin sentiment, though they may indeed constitute anti-Brahminical politics. If you have been misinformed in this regard, I and others on the list will be happy to point you to the relevant sources. I think you will find that those who want to symbolically burn the Manusmriti do not want to end its study--quite the opposite--but rather want something much more simple: to not be killed, raped, spat upon, or discriminated against by upper castes.

If you are criticizing Dalit rights and women?s rights movements and their critiques of the Manusmriti in your post, let me take this opportunity to kindly remind you that this is an academic and scholarly forum and as such casteism, sexism, and communalism have no place here.

People who hate brahmins use Manusmriti and similar texts as their tools in their politics. I wonder how many of them could read these original texts in Sanskrit. Depending upon the translations, everyone?s understanding and interpretation may vary. It is truly a sad scene.

However, the misogyny of the text is unmistakeable (though hardly out of line with nearly all texts in antiquity) and 9.14-15 seem to (mis-)characterize females generally. However, I would add is that pau??calya here denotes lust or an innate sexual desire for men. While it may sometimes refer to a prostitute, the primary meaning of ?prostitute? (at least in American English) is one who has sex in exchange for money. Granted, there are other meanings, but the money piece matters, I think, because the condemnation in Manu is about women?s temptations and attributed inclinations toward adultery, not prostitution in a strict sense. The passage is exhorting husbands to control their wives (or, more deviously, keep women hyper-occupied, 9.10-12) in order to prevent their adultery. It then justifies this control on the false grounds of women?s innate lechery, fickleness, and general inconstancy.
