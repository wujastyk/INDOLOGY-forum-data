"Gilead then cut Ephraim off from the fords of the Jordan, and whenever 
Ephraimite fugitives said, 'Let me cross,' the men of Gilead would ask, 
'Are you an Ephraimite?' If he said, 'No,' they then said, 'Very well, 
say "Shibboleth" (??????).' If anyone said, "Sibboleth" (??????), 
because he could not pronounce it, then they would seize him and kill 
him by the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites fell on 
this occasion."
