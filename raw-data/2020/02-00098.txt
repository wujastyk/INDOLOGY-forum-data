Dear Jonathan,

     Most of these north Indian names are two part first names, and by
convention generally the initials of both parts of the first names are used
in giving English abbreviations, i.e. Ganga Nath Jha = G. N. Jha; Vidya
Niwas Misra = V. N. Misra.  My daughter's father-in-law is Hari Shanker
Gupta = H. N. Gupta.
