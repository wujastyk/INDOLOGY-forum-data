Deadline for manuscript submissions: 31 December 2020. 

Dear Colleagues,

Current debates and conversations among bioethicists have largely ignored Hindu materials and perspectives, despite the growing number of Hindu clinicians and patients in the global medical world. In addition, purportedly secular bioethics seems to be based largely on Christian and western ethical foundations. The end result has been a field that claims to be universal but is actually quite limited and arguably quite parochial.

But merely adding a ?Hindu? voice to the mix is not the solution. There are so many disparate voices within the Hindu context and each one claims to offer a unified, legitimate and authoritative voice. While Cromwell Crawford has indeed contributed to the field, his contributions are from one narrow slice of Hinduism. Other articles that have appeared in medical journals have been written by enthusiastic doctors who have little or no knowledge of ?Hindu? literature and classical texts. Still other, more academically driven books and articles by Katherine Young, among others, are sufficiently esoteric that they exclude bioethicists seeking guidance on Hindu bioethics.

This issue on contemporary Hinduism and Bioethics is an invitation to contribute to a developing field.  Contributors should submit articles that address the methodological issues concerning the very idea of a ?Hindu Bioethics,? that offer contemporary ?Hindu? responses to particular bioethical issues or concerns (Covid-19 related scenarios are especially welcome), that concern the connection between traditional and contemporary ?Hinduism? and bioethics, and that provide guidance and is a useful tool for students of Hindu bioethics who are clinical bioethicists and/ or healthcare workers.
