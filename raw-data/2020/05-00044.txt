Subject: [INDOLOGY] DHARMA Project Blog
Message-ID: <CANVHsm43vxsphgkVMuG_feSe=fFem=fmZ6WjnjoR1xc=CBn0iw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

It is my pleasure to announce the existence of a blog dedicated to the
DHARMA Project (ERC Synergy Grant no. 809994, 2019-2025
<https://erc.europa.eu/projects-figures/erc-funded-projects/results?search_api_views_fulltext=DHARMA>)
with the following URL:

https://dharma.hypotheses.org/

The blog has been online for several months already and contains now enough
content, I hope, to be of interest.

Please note that:
- you will find blogposts appearing in the main page, but also pages in the
menu, that will be progressively enriched.
- the blog is furnished with RSS feeds.
- the blog is the primary communication and dissemination channel of the
project. In due time, it will be complemented with another website for the
epigraphical corpora from South and Southeast Asia that are the main focus
of the project (online editions and search facilities).

With very best wishes in this very strange days
