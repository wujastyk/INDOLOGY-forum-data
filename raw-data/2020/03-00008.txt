Dear James,

The Pali suttas and other canonical texts, commentaries, etc., can be viewed in a variety of scripts, including Roman and Burmese, within the Cha??ha Sa?g?yana Tipitaka Version 4.0, which you can download from https://www.tipitaka.org/cst4 (and elsewhere).

Best wishes
Mark

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pali suttas in Burmese alphabet

Hi

A colleague not on this list sent me the following question:

"I had a request from someone wanting to transliterate Pali suttas
written in the Burmese alphabet using the roman alphabet.

Do you know anyone who may be able to help with this transliteration
work, or who I might ask for help."

Any suggestions will be much appreciated

Cheers
James
