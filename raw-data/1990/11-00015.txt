Brett,
 
I would give my right arm for a program of the type Harry describes.
To be able to feed in data like "Friday 11 suklapaksa of Asadha, sam
1617" and have it converted to the European era and verified, and a
nearest guess made if the thing didn't check (assuming that scribes
might be more likely to have the day of the week right than the
tithi).  Please, please go ahead!  Prof. David Pingree is a foremost
authority on these dating systems, and is well up on issues like where
Pillai's tables are wrong.  I would be delighted to help by testing,
or in any other way.
