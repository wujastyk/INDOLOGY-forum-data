Subject: uuencoded version of indhist ...
Message-ID: <161227015559.23782.18043604627111997488.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 

Thanks to Tarun for providing indhist in compressed, uuencoded
format. BUT...
 
I tried the following but couldn't get indhist to install properly.
 
 1. uudecoded the file (Note: it gave me message "Short file" !!)
 2. uncompress ind.tar.Z
 3. tar xvf on ind.tar
     This created a directoy "ind" with only *one* file "INSTALL" in it.
     I ran INSTALL and it completed by saying that installation is
     complete but I couldn't find the command anywhere.
 
I think the problem is in tar. It should have created more than one file
in directory ind.
