"Quick, quick, the anthropologists are coming" -- Gary Larson
(natives in mud hut, rapidly hiding the TV and video, etc.)
 
Delighted to have you aboard, Bo.
 
INDOLOGY is for the discussion of all matters indological,
and anyone who knows what indology is is welcome to be a member.
 
And this sentence is a lie.
