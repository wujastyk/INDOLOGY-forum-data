This is a very nice example of how a common coding scheme can help
us all in dealing with Sanskrit texts.  The text Madhav has on his
mac started life on a DOS PC, then went onto an OS/2 PC, then lived for
a while on a Unix machine.  Now he has a perfectly legible, fully
accented text on his Mac.
 
Long live the CSX scheme!
 
Perhaps a committee at the next IASS meeting in Australia could
consider adding some of Madhav's "Paninian" characters to the
official set?  Or perhaps some positions in the set should be left
intentionally blank to allow for customization?
