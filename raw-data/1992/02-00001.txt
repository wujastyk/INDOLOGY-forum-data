Hi !
Here is some info I have about e-mail to India.
 * The e-mail gateway to India is via Bombay.
 * It is possible to find out places which have e-mail facility using the
   whois command. This allows one to search the database which has , or rather
   ,supposed to have addr of all institutes with e-mail facility in India.
   I am including the help info on this facility and also a sample session.
   (which is mainly aimed at pointing out the fact that not all addr are in the
    DB).
 
Hope this helps.

=============================================================================
     Online Email directory of ERNET users in India (maintained on sangam)
 
     The whois program examines a central database of registered users  and,
     based on a user supplied search key, looks up and displays information
     about all selected users. Display is always truncated to fifty lines.
     The command
       whois -h sangam.ernet.in help
     gets you a copy of this document.
 
SEARCH KEYS
     All searches are case-insensitive. When searching the database  with  a
     name  key,  you can  use a few  characters  of the  name instead of the
     entire word.  This is handy if you are not sure of the exact spelling.
 
     A search key consists of a single word or group of words  contained  in
     (double) quotes (" ... "). The single word form matches city name.
 
     whois -h sangam.ernet.in bombay    (Lists ernet sites in Bombay)
     whois -h sangam.ernet.in mad       (All the Madras sites !)
 
     Queries using the form key at site will
     match user's login name or full name as in /etc/passwd  file.
 
     whois -h sangam.ernet.in joshi at shakti      (All users on shakti matching
                                                 the pattern 'joshi')
 
     The use of the symbol % in front of a name limits the search
     to the field containing the login name. Eg:
 
     whois -h sangam.ernet.in %sadanand at shakti
     (only logins starting with 'sadanand' at shakti)
 
     This will fail to match P Sadanandan, whose login name is ps
 
     Directory outputs associate a mailid with each user, for further
     enquiry, to retrieve full postal address, phone and Fax numbers.
     For example, sh287 is the mailid of PKX Thomas as shown below.
 
(sh287) thomas:(Mr. P.K.X. Thomas,NCST,,) <thomas at shakti.ernet.in>
 
     Use !mailid for getting detailed information.
 
     whois -h sangam.ernet.in !sh287
     (Gives postal address, Phone & Fax numbers of Thomas)
                    (C-Shell users must use \! instead of !)
