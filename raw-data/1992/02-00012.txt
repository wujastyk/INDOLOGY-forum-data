Many Pali texts exist in electronic form. The entire Pali canon, Thai
version, has been available for a number of years from Mahidol University,
for app. $4,000 US. Recently the PTS canon has been input with a combination
of Dhammakaya Foundation and UC-Berkeley, and mostly awaits various
massaging, and no doubt intense copyright, distribution, etc. discussions.
Many individuals have input texts as well (I used to have a number of
Dhammapada on disk). Perhaps those who have input texts could let us all
know?
