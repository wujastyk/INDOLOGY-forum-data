Sorry to hear about your data loss.
 
For sanskrit texts, try anonymous ftp to
     ftp.bcc.ac.uk
and look in
     pub/users/ucgadkw/indology
Also, send email to Lou Burnard, lou at vax.oxford.ac.uk, who is
in charge of the Oxford Text Archive, a well-organised depository
of machine-readable texts which includes some Sanskrit and Pali
texts.
