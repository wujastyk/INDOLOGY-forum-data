This is very good news indeed.  Many thanks, Madhav, for being
so flexible about the CSX coding.  This will make the font extremely
useful to a much wider audience.
 
Incidentally, for those who may not know, Madhav's PostScript font
can be used with TeX (naturally) on any printer by using a PS to PK
translator.  There are also PK to HP translators around, so the font
can also be used at 300dpi by owners of Hewlett Packard LaserJets.
