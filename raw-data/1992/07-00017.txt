Once again confusion between where characters are located in a font and how
characters in a font are accessed: any font developed for the Macintosh can
be laid down with characters conforming to the CSX coding/positions if you
are using a tool such as Fontographer. If you want to access those characters
by using keyboard sequences which in some way, degree, or form, relate to a
particular character then you simply develop a keyboard driver in order to
enable you to do so -- after all, the Macintosh comes with different keyboard
layouts for a starter.
