Dear Indology discussion list,

Apologies to anyone trying to reach me during the past six weeks. With a
combination of outside duties and a negotiation with our Computer Unit over
storage quotas, I ghave been effectively out of circulation.
 
That now continues! I am off to Israel until the beginning of June.
 
Your mail will be stored to be handled on my return.
 
Thank you for making contact.
 
Ian (Mitchell Lambert)
