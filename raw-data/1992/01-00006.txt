After getting a message to India returned to me, and after
dissecting my mail headers, I think that the correct address
for Professor Sundaram at the University of Madras is:
 
      unimad!sundaram at iitm.ernet.in
 
The two segments of the part of the address before the @ should
be in reverse order from what I first thought.
