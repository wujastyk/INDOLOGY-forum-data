Subject: Asthadhyayi in CS/CSX encoding
Message-ID: <161227015315.23782.12318759056792284217.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Status: RO

The Panini text which has recently become available from the
Indology listserv host, is now available for anonymous ftp in
the CS/CSX proposed encoding for Sanskrit from
    blackbox.hacc.washington.edu  [128.95.200.1]
    in directory  pub/indic
 
The file refers to the font wnrir10, for transliterated Indic,
whose metafont source code is also available in the same directory.
 
The text has *not* been carefully proofread after undergoing the
conversion process; perhaps I may trust that its shortcomings will
be made known to me in detail---or possibly even corrected versions
returned as diff lists . . .
 
ever hopeful,
Tom
