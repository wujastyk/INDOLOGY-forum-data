Subject: Velthuis Devanagari fonts for OzTeX
 
The Velthuis Devanagari fonts are now available for use with OzTeX: the
pre-processor was compiled by Peter Robinson from the "Computers and
Manuscripts" project and many thanks are due to him for this task. The
manual accompanying the fonts/pre-processor is available as an OzTeX DVI
file.
 
The pre-processor has been used on the test file with success: it has not
however been subjected to a more lengthy test--feedback welcome. Send it
to me and not to the list please.
