  Support for WordPerfect 5.1 with Indic in transliteration (using the
  metafont-created font) is in internal testing at Washington now.
  This is based on the same TeX fonts mentioned above translated
  by Norm Walsh's pktosfp utility.
 
    We aim to have screen-font support for EGA/VGA or Herc Plus,
  and printer support for HP LaserJet family only.  We also
  expect to be able to translate from CS/CSX encoded `otherwise plain ASCII'
  files into WP's coding.  This will definitely not be available in any form
  before summer, but sometime in the summer is a good guess.  Anyone
  with existing files can expect to have to do some conversion, as some
  Indic characters are in the inherently non-standard user-defined
  character space.
 
  Those with the capability and the interest can help us test out these fonts
  in their TeX-able form (from 128.95.200.1 in pub/indic with the bitmap pk
  fonts and tfm metric files in pub/indic/binary).  We have not had much
  material to use for testing . . . (the availability of the Panini and
  Asvaghosha texts is a *big* plus), and are just now discovering some
  inconsistencies in the font relating to subscript dot placement und so
  weiter.
 
cheers,
Tom
