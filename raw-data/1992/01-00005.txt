I am seeking the addresses of the following people.
 
Paul J. Griffiths
William Halbfass
Mark Siderits
Eli Franco
Bruce C. Hall
 
If anyone knows of an e-mail address for any of them, I would appreciate
receiving that information; I would also like to know their current
mailing addresses from anyone whose address book is more up to date
than mine.
 
Thank you,
Richard Hayes
