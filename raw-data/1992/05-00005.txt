I've been trying to find out what computer resources a good library
on Indology should have.  It seems that there are various Bibles
and texts from Western religions available on CD, or as well
constructed computer programs.  Are there similar CD's and programs
for Hindu and Buddhist texts?  If so, where does one find them?
If you were able to add computer resources to your library in the
area in Indologic studies, what would you get at the present time?
If someone could include materials that might be available in
India to this list, and what sort of equipment it would take to
use them, I'd much appreciate it.
