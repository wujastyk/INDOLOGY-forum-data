Dear K.G. Zysk, Dominik Wujastyk, and Michio Yano,
 
Thanks very much for the help. I am about to pass the replies on to my friend
in Kerala. I hope they of use to him.
 
I will be leaving Cambridge tomorrow, and there is the possibilty that I will
not be able to check my e-mail over Easter. I should be back around about the
20th April.
 
What has been said so far has wetted my appetite - I'll have to read up about
the Keralan mathematics and astronomy.
 
Happy Easter,
 
Richard Marsden
