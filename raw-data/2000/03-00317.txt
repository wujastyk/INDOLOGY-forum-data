What pray, does the term 'nairukta etymologists' mean? Do you think, the
text should be ignored completely and replaced by *IE constructs as the only
basis for all arguments? Nairukta is a fact of early linguistic history and
cannot be wished away. For e.g., modern pundits in R.gveda have to reckon with
the nature of the 'divinities' expounded in this text.

Rahul Oka has raised some interesting questions which also need to be answered
in the chat club or whatever.

Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
