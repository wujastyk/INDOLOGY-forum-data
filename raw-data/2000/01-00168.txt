NG>   The roman letters are preferred over the indian kind and, Indian
  place value notation in the world. Both for efficiency.

RB>     I am confused. My impression is that the place value notation of
today was never used by romans. Even Binary     arithmatic in microchips is
dependant on the place value notation ( scaling up by an order magnitude
with a bit      shift). I would like to know about other non INdian cultures
which independantly evolved such a notation. The chinese        abacus would
be one example but I dont know if that predates such systems in India.

        Even the mordern arabic numerals used through out the world
resemble and originate from indian numerals.
