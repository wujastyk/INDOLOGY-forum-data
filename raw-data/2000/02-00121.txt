        The problem with post-Vivekananda spirituality is that it
deliberately ignores the serious differences on all core issues between
the major schools of Vedanta and other systems of Indian thought.  While
Raamaanuja felt no shame in authoring his Zataduu.sa.nii "hundred faults
with the doctrine of Maayaavaada", a modern visiting Swamy blandly told me
that all schools of Vedanta teach the same thing and that there was no
more any reason to study the differences between these schools.

Incidentally,  Zataduusanii was written by Vedanta Desika a post Ramanuja
(visistadvaitin).  Whatever it may be I did not get your point as to "the
shame" issue.  What do you mean by that?
