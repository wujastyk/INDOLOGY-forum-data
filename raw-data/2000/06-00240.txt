By the same token, many river names in Tamilnadu
hardly seem to be of Tamil (or SDr) origin. For
example, keTilam, vaiyai, kAviri, noyyal, koLLiTam,
'kabini' or the Sanskrit sounding names like  pavAni,
tAmiravaruNi or stems of rivers with -ARu suffixes
like aricilARu, veNNARu, veTTARu, pAlARu etc..

Are there perhaps acceptable etymologies in the
literature for these?

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
