Sorry for getting off topic again, I consider this "ignorance" (?). Inner city
schools are more or less homogenous minority dominated; the "racial" problems
are in ?transitional? neighborhoods and suburbs where the minorities are moving
into.

Yes there are problems in inner city schools but the core issue there is
structural poverty which leads to crime and related problems NOT racism.

I will respond to this thread anymore.Thanks for your patience.
