Exhaustive, but rather outdated is A. W. Ryder: Die Rbhus im Rgveda,
Leipzig 1901.
Did you find my small article "Die Rbhus im Rgveda: Jahreszeitengoetter
oder vergoettlichte Handwerker?", ZDMG, Suppl. III,2 (1977), p. 955-963?
It is well-hidden in Dandekar's bibliography. I mention some of the
literature up to then. I remember that George Thompson some years ago was
interested in the Rbhus. Perhaps he can give you some hints about more
recent literature?

Best regards
