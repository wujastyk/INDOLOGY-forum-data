I am investigating having the map scanned into the Library of
Congress's collection of scanned maps or  onto some other site.

The map is NOT the same as the one in the Schwartzberg atlas.

I think I erred in saying this had been distributed to participants
in the LC Cooperative Acquisitions Program.  The card number (LCCN) is
not a field office number.  I suspect I presented LC its copy some
time ago.

The publisher, Deccan Printing Works, does not appear in the Pune
telephone directory now.
