I think you have cleverly managed to insult both me and George Thompson in
a single short sentence.

This list is not designed as a forum for insults, accusations, or
political lobbying. 

I'm getting pretty fed up with the lack of self-control shown by some
recent posters, and I shall now recommence summarily unsubscribing people
who persistently ignore the scope and purposes of this list.

I shall issue one warning before unsubbing a person.

This is such a warning.
