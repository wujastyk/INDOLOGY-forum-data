In Le Museon IV (1903) and V (1904), Cecil Bendall published an anonymous
anthology of extracts from Buddhist literature under the title
"SubhASita-SaMgraha." The library here at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison is unfortunately lacking those very volumes and no library
seems willing to send them on inter-library loan. Can anyone on the list
tell me if  that collection was at some time reprinted elsewhere (which may
be more accessible), or whether it has been the subject of scholarly
investigation? Thank you.
