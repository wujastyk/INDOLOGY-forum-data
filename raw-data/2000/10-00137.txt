Fellow Asianists,
        Would you please circulate the following invitation for
applications for the Asa and Kashmir Johal Chair in India Research.
        This was advertised last year but was withdrawn because of
administrative problems.  This year we are all clear.
        Thank you.

        Applications are invited for a newly-endowed Chair in India
Research.  The appointment, beginning in July 1, 2001, will be made jointly
