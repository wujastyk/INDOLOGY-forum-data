>   After a decade-long "Indianization" to teach regional languages in
>   the schools - and remove British-era names of streets and places
>   (Bombay is now Mumbai, Calcutta is Kolkata) - a middle-class
>   consensus to spread the learning of English is emerging. For 50
>   years, English has been a language of privilege, but today it must
>   become a more common vernacular, say intellectuals, business
>   executives, and parents alike.

>   Acknowledging these realities, in December the government of
>   Maharashtra, whose capital is Bombay, announced compulsory English
>   lessons for all students from grade 6 onward. The move, like a
>   similar one in West Bengal two years ago, reverses a policy of the
>   early 1990s to teach only the local Marathi and Bengali languages
>   in schools. Parents in Bombay were a major part of the lobbying
>   effort to change the system.
