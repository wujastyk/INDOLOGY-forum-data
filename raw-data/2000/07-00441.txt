I have just seen the price for a reprint of Mayrhofer's KEWA from a western
publisher as $995.00 !!

Contrast this with the low prices offered by Indian publishers.
I got the 4 vol. set of Turners CDIAL for $175.00.
I got the 5 vol. set of Brugmann's Comparative Grammar for $75.00 (including
airmail shipping!!).
I got a 10 vol. set of the Taittiriya Samhita for $75.00.
I've seen the 19 vol. set of Griersons Linguistic Survey offered for
$416.00.
etc. etc.
