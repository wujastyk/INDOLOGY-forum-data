But Vidyaranya did establish a matha in the newly established
capital at Hampi, so there goes this argument. Why is there this
great need to mistrust the evidence at hand and speculate about
what somebody centuries ago might have said or might have done?
Would you consider that the Virupaksha Matha in Hampi is itself
"pretending" to have been established by Vidyaranya?
