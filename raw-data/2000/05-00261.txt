Subject: Divehi speaker in DC area needed
Message-ID: <161227058788.23782.6250285092554986636.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

If there are any speakers of Divehi in the Washington, DC area, or
anyone who knows one, could you please contact me off the list?   We
need a (very) small amount of volunteer help with Divehi periodicals.
I will also be contacting the Maldives interest section at the Sri
Lanka embassy.
