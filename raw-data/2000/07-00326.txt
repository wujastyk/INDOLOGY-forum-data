Subject: Subject-prefix for INDOLOGY (fwd)
Message-ID: <161227060073.23782.18147204048428511158.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A member has made the following suggestion that all INDOLOGY messages
should have "[INDOLOGY]" prefixed to the subject line.

Personally, I have a mail filter set up that automatically sends incoming
indology messages to a separate folder, based on the string "indology" in
the "to: " field.  So I have no need for such a prefix.  In fact I would
prefer not to have it, since it "steals" ten characters from the length of
the subject line.

Let's vote on this issue.

If you want a prefix, send a message to INDOLOGY with the subject line
"prefix - yes".

If you don't want a prefix, send a message to INDOLOGY with the subject
line "prefix - no".

Subject: Subject-prefix for INDOLOGY

Dear Mr. Wujastyk,

Being a subscriber to INDOLOGY, I would like to make a suggestion:

Couldn't it be possible to generate a subject prefix for all the messages
that are distributed via INDOLOGY? I'm managing three mailing lists myself,
and Majordomo (which we use in Cologne) allows to insert a string at the
beginning of the subject header of each message. Our list "Indologie" has
f. e. "[Indologie] ":

(Original message:)

Subject: Internet-Radioprogramme in indischen Sprachen

(Message received from "Indologie":)

Subject: [Indologie] Internet-Radioprogramme in indischen Sprachen

That's extremely helpful when you go through your inbox. Especially in
times when the discussion gets out of hands and you'd like to remain
abstinent for some time (without unsubscribing)...

Greetings (^:
