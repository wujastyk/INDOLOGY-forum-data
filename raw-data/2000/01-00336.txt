Dear Jonathan,

To this plausible interpretation I would like to add this footnote:
being struck by a"sani in the sense of ``thunderbolt", especially
as a literary image, does not necessarily cause death
immediately. This seems to be evident from stanza IV.26 (or 27
in some editions) in Har.sadeva?s play Naagaananda (7th
century), also according to the interpretation of the South Indian
commentator "Sivaraama (later than 12th cent.; perhaps
13th/14th cent.?). The stanza has to be recited by Garu.da who
has just reached the slaughter-stone in order to devour the
(supposed) Naaga lying there. Observing this Naaga (who is in
fact the bodhisattva Jiimuutavaahana) Garu.da declares that
now he will pierce through the Naaga?s breast with his beak
which is fiercer than an a"sani-da.n.da
(nirbhidyaa"sanida.n.daca.n.datarayaa ca~ncvaadhunaa
vak.sasi). "Sivaraama paraphrases: a"sanida.n.davad
da.n.daakaarakuli"savat ca.n.datarayaa etc., which makes it
clear that a"sanida.n.da here should mean ``thunderbolt" (indeed
a suitable object of comparison with regard to Garu.da?s beak).
The Tibetan Shong-ston (13th/14th cent.), a specialist in Sanskrit
kaavya, renders rdo rje?i dbyug pa (``stick of a thunderbolt
[vajra]") which is a literal translation of a"sani-da.n.da.

The story goes on to say that the continuous attack of Garu.da?s
beak (being similar to a thunderbolt) does not immediately result
in the death of the hero at all, but repeatedly wounds and injures
in a very cruel and prolonged way.

With kind regards,
Roland
