--> i have read the original works neither in the original Sanskrit, neither
have i read the whole of them in translation. I have only read parts of them
in translation, and also the criticism of these books by more modern modern
scholars.

--> you keep saying that the Yogacara does not deny external material
objects/external reality. Could you give some sources for this (modern
sources i mean)? [ kindly do not give me online sources as i have found that
many of them are not reliable.] My understanding of the argument is that
according to this law "we never know an object as distinct from the
sensations or ideas. Whatever is known is known as identical with the
ideas." (See pg 80 of Chattopadhyaya's What is living and what is dead in
Indian Philosophy.) Dharmakirti himself says the following (as quoted in
Madhva's "Sarvadarsanasangraha"): "The object known as blue and the
knowledge thereof are identical, because of the law of their being
invariably known as inseparable."

--> i am not interested in how other Budhists used this argument for now;
let us concentrate, for now, on how Dharmakirti used this argument.

--> i had mentioned these by name because they are fairly renowned and it is
not so easy to dismiss away their claims (as would be in the case of some
modern scholar of whom few have heard about).

Here is a more modern souce: "Kumarila Bhatta's refutation of the dreaming
argument" by John A. Taber (in Studies in Mimansa (ed. R.C. Dwivedi) Motilal
Banarsidas Publishers.  New Delhi, 1994). In this article, Kumarila's
refutation of Vasubandhu's views (as recorded in the "Vimsatika"), is
presented by Taber.
