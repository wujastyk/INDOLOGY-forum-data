Dear members,

Does anyone know of a dictionary (or any other type of publication) of
Buddhist Sanskrit proper names? For Pali there is G.Malalasekera's
_Dictionary of Pali Proper Names_. Is there anything equivalent for
Buddhist/Hindu Sanskrit? I have searched the online catalogues of several
major libraries without much success.
