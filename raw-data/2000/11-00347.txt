'>'Kannan, Perundevi, and names ending in valli/vaLLi.

    I am glad, and pleasantly surprised
    to know that some brahmins have names like
    Murugan. What do you think would be the percentage
    (obviously only based on smaller samples, familiar to us)
    of Tamil names ? Would it be more than 1-2% ?

    Thanks
