I have heard people saying aloud things like pa me O ki MAtrA......( put the
O vowel marker on pa) and so on to describe how a word is spelt or written.

There is no notion of spelling or spelling bees in hindi or sanskrit as it
exists in english. saying the syllales aloud would just amount to saying the
word slowly.
