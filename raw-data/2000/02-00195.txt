Please see ardhanArInarezvara below.

some people believe that Kanda refers to Prostate gland, possibly due to a
procedure known as kandapidana (stimulating kanda).

are you talking about Kundalini?

If you mean by this that the Yogi loses interest in sex, it may be acceptable,
but not if you mean physical feminization.
