Re Vedaadhikara of sudras etc, there is this
interesting sloka (9.21) in the drama, Mrichhakatikam
which many of you may be familiar with:

vedArthAnprAkRtastvam vadasi na ca te jihvA nipatitA
madhyanhe vIkSHase'rkam na tava sahasA dRSHTirvicalita
dIptAgnau pANimantah kSHipasi sa ca te dagdho bhavati
no
cAritryAccArudattam calayasi na te deham harati bhUh.

The translation is as follows:

You, a low caste fellow, are explaining the sense of
the vedas and yet your tongue does not fall off! You
are gazing at the sun at mid-day, and still your eyes
are not suddenly struck blind! You are putting your
hand inside the blazing fire and yet that hand of
yours is not burnt! You are depriving Charudatta of
his good name and still the Earth does not gulp down
your body!
