Yes, what term *would* a 16th century European have used for a contemporary
Hindu? Giordano Bruno, 'De Magia', c. 1589 (para 1), gives examples of
Magi: "Trimegisti apud Aegyptios, Druidae apud Gallos, Gymnosophistae apud
Indos, Cabalistae apud Hebraeos, Magi apud Persas (qui a Zoroastre), Sophi
apud Graecos, Sapientes apud Latinos".

Was the reference to Gymnosophistae derived from Classical sources, or does
it imply some more recent contact (e.g. the 1494 visitor to Pico della
Mirandola's circle in Florence)?

Thanks to List Members for all the extremely interesting material!
