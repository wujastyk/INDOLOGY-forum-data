Message-ID: <161227056089.23782.17473024335740709242.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is anyone on Indology going to the World Sanskrit Conference in Turin?
 Is there any evidence it's actually going to come off?  If have faxed
CESMEO for information about accomodations and gotten no reply.  There
is also no program on the website.
