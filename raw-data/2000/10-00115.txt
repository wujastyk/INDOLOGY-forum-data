Or, to put it differently, their would-be investigators don't have the
wherewithal to blend in among them. In other words, how will you get the
average university to come up with such field equipment as a few
thousand-dollar suits (or haute-couture for the ladies), a Rolex, not to
mention a Mercedes Benz or a Ferrari, all necessary to mingle effortlessly
with the rich and participate in their lives on reasonably equal terms. The
rich have little patience with the pennyless, I believe.

(If you find a way, please let me know!)
