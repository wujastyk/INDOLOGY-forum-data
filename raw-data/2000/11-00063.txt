Subject:      vastusastra

Hello,
I am a student at McGill University, doing research on the vastusastraic
text, Manasara.  I am wondering whether any commentaries existed within
the sastraic tradition on this text or any other vastusastra text such as
Mayamata, Silparatna, Samaranganasutradhara,Aparajitapraccha and so on, in
the same way that bhasyas and varttikas existed on Panini's Ashtadhyayi, the
Gita etc. If they did exist, where (library/archive) can they be found
today?
I will be grateful for any information.
Jose Thevercad
