Last week in New Scientist magazine I saw an advertisement for British
Airways (I think it was) which was promoting the idea that you could lie
down and sleep in their airplanes.  In 1st class, anyhow.

The theme of the advert was the Buddha.  First there was a pic of the
Buddha sitting up, apparently alert.  Then one of him lying at full
length, on his side, resting on a pillow, exemplifying a restful journey.

I thought that pose was, iconographically, always the mahaparinibbana.  Am
I right?  It's nothing to do with having a nice rest, but rather to do
with dying after eating poisoned food.

Perhaps someone should tell BA?
