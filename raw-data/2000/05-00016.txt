Subject: Abhisamacarika Buddhist vinaya text available
Message-ID: <161227058253.23782.9410217984401268239.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Those interested in Buddhist texts / Skt texts may notice a new web
site at which one can find the text of the Abhisamacarika, a vinaya
text. Tibetan fonts are also downloadable from this page.

go to :  http://www.sobutsu.org/      then   "Information"  then
"Digital Library"

don't be freaked out that most parts of the site are in Japanese--the
texts are romanized. There is also a chart of the script of the ms
available there. I downloaded the material without any problem.

Provided to us through the great generosity of Koshin SUZUKI and
others on the team.
