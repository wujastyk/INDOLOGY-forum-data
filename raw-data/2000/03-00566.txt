Subject: P.V.Kane's HDS in abridged form
Message-ID: <161227057470.23782.11490403844218323347.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Why an abridged version of what is supposed to be a kind of compendium or English nibandha?
There are shorter publications on sections of the material Kane has collected, e.g. Pandey?s
Hindu Samskaras, Derrett?s fasc. in the History of Ind. Lit., Altekar and Sternbachs bibl. on
Arthasastra, Altekar on education, etc. - not to speak about the topics of Kane?s vol. IV-V
(karma, pilgrimage, tapas, vratas and utsavas etc.) Moreover, there are extensive indices in
each volume, but an Index of these indices would be practically helpful.

Best regards, Axel Michaels
