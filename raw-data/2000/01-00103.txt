If I'm not mistaken, Punjabi has only lost the voiced
aspirates each of which is pronounced like the
corresponding unvoiced unaspirated consonant with an
added tone.  The orthography records neither the loss
of the voiced aspirate nor the tone.

In ordinary conversation, the voiceless aspirates can
still be clearly heard. Some of the latter are still
ringing in my ears from my last trip to India :-)

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
