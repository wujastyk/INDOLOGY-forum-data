Yes, there are points and themes in common.

The question is rather ill-posed. zUnyavAda is different from
vijnAnavAda, even though they have things in common. Similarly,
advaita vedAnta is different from zUnyavAda and different from
vijnAnavAda, even if it has things in common with both.

As Kumarila was pre-Sankara, this becomes a very complicated
question. To adequately address it, one needs to check whether
the doctrines criticized by Kumarila can be found in the very
meagre corpus of pre-Sankaran texts of vedAnta. I am unaware
of any studies that progress beyond speculating about this. It
would be far more preferable to conclude, after a careful study of the
texts, rather than to assume things a priori.

Re: the two truths, if there was any borrowing, it was not very
surreptitious. It was done out in the open, but also note that
the vedAntin "two truths" theory differs in crucial ways from
the Mahayana Buddhist theory. Check gauDapAda's kArikAs, as also
Sankara's discussion in the sUtrabhAshya. As a matter of fact,
one can't borrow anything surreptitiously. Borrowal implies full
knowledge/consent on the part of the donor. Surreptitiousness
implies stealing, without knowledge or consent of the owner.
However,

1. ownership/copyrights on philosophical ideas?
2. see bRhadAraNyaka 4. 5. 15, for the upanishadic origin of
   the mature advaita vedAnta theory of two truths.

Note that in mattavilAsaprahasana, a farcical play by Mahendra
Varman, the "curiously-minded" king (600 CE), a Saiva accuses
the Buddha himself of having borrowed Upanishadic ideas. This
kind of estimation is fine in a drama, but I think comparative
study of philosophies should account for many subtleties.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
