Aurangzeb's kingdom, but this was outside Akbar's power. From this fact
alone, Aurangzeb was greater than Akbar.
VA: Are you trying to say that rulers of smaller kingdoms like Khalipha Abu
Bakr and Paigambar Muhammad were inferior to Aurangzeb? Or were the
followers of 'destructive polytheism' like Alexander and Augustus Caeser
greater than Momin Aurangzeb becuase they had beigger empires? Of course,
with regard to Alexander, you can seek refuge in Koranic Ayats according to
which Alexander had two horns on his head and was a Muslim in reality.

SA:Aurangzeb took a strong stand against disruptive separatist elements,
which was naturally disliked by those fomenting the rebellions in the first
place.
VA: Were these rebellions fomented by his father Emperor Shah Jehan, whom he
imprisoned till death. Or his younger brother Murad, whom he got drugged and
then killed? Or his elder brother Dara Shikoh, whom he accused of apostasy
from Islam and then got him killed according to Islamic law; or his other
elder brother Shuja whom he drove to Arakans (where he died an unnatural
death).

SA:Of course, Baniya Vaishyas are not happy at the prospect of Brahmanic
Sanskrit replacing their beloved Khari Boli. Fortunately, there are many
Brahmins who will agree that Sanskrit needs some piece of the cake going to
Khari Boli.
VA: Just to let you know, my mother speaks Punjabi and was born at Amritsar
a furlong from Sri Harimandir Sahib. All this should not matter to you
anyways because al-Llah speaks only Arabic according to Koran. All the other
languages therefore are irrelevant according to Islamic wisdom.


SA:Seems you are the only one on this list to disagree with
me. I shall not post any more on this thread due to lack of time.
VA: And do you realize that because of a few Muslims like you, crores of
Indian Muslims get a bad name. If not for the sake of India, for their sake
at least, please stop promoting Dalitstan and so on.
