Is this last quotation in fact from Schmandt-Besserat? I wonder, since
it reverses what I understand of her central thesis. In a number of
papers going back to the 70s, Schmandt-Besserat repeatedly argues that
there are *direct* links between the shapes of these tokens and the
earliest forms of Sumerian cuneiform writing -- not only of numbers).
What is the origins of this quotation?
