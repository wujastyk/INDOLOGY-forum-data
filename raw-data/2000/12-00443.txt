Yes. For instance ziva is often called piccan2. For example,

meyc ciram aNaiccu ulakil niccam iTu piccai amar piccan2 iTam Am
(tEv.3.67.11)

Moreover, ziva who is called a mad man (pittan2) by cuntarar is supposed to
dance with madness (piccu) as given below.

piccu ATal pEyOTu ukantAy pORRi piRavi aRukkum pirAn2E pORRi (tEv.6.55.2)
