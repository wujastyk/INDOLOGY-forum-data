Now under the sankiirn.a jaati called IAS (Indian Administrative Services), working
under the neo-kshatriyas called MP, MLA . If one is a clerk, one may be called
nimna-kaayastha. Stha (located ) in Kaayaa (bureau), hence kaayastha. But officer or
clerk, the kaayastha has retained his ancient characteristic mentioned by Kautilya,
taking bribe (utkoca).
