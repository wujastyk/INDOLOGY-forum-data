Give us a break. Frontline a magazine by the very traditonal Iyengar brahmin
institution "The Hindu" is leftist?!

I feel that Indians in thsi context has no sense. There are serious
Dravidian(ists) who refuse to be grouped under that banner, particualrly in
this context.
All that we have is that a subgroup of "Indians" not only refuse to accept hard
evidence but manipulate archaeological evidence that questions their own
preferences for theories of their ethnic origin.

A few months ago a 25-year old Indian computer consultant started this OIT
topic on his own and when I said the OIT is mainly socio-political without
reasonable scientific basis, he immediately asked me "Are you a Hindu,
Chandra?". That clearly shows the systemic nature of the problem and the
strength of the propaganda.
