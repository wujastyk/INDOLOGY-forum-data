As with vol.1, the "a" volume is text and the "b" volume consists of notes
to the "a" volume.  Vol 2b also includes a colossal bibliography, spanning
pages 783-1018.

Vol I covered the b.rhattrayii of Caraka, Susruta and Vagbhata.  Vol II is

Vol. 2b contains notes to the above, and the bibliography.


I defy any indologist with a pulse not to find materials of great interest
and importance in this publication.  Originally requested by Gonda for the
"orange" series, this book rapidly grew beyond the size allocation allowed
for Gonda's series, and has now found separate publication in its own
right in the Groningen Oriental Series.  It is a goldmine of information
on all aspects of Indian cultural history, and utterly indispensable to
anyone working on medicine, body studies, alchemy, tantra, cookery, pulse
lore, gemstones, or related subjects.
