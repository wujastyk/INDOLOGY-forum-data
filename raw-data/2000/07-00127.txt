Yes, especially item B.

Of course, the author does not make any claims but suggests that IF
there were any -- a possibility which he does not rule out -- the flow
must have been from the West.   See especially pp26 -31.  He also
states that the evidence is suggestive with regards the Madyamika
parallels but not conclusive (for obvious reasons).

Yes, agreed.

However, the article mentioned above describes a number of striking
features in common.  I suggest you have a quick look at it if
possible -- personally, I am agnostic in this respect though I find
the hypothesis intriguing.

But fact is often stranger than fiction and does not always fit well
with our preconceptions of what ought to be the case.  Events in the
real world often tend to be rather more fuzzy than William of Ockham
would allow.

Neither I nor McEvilley suggests the likelihood that the influences,
if any, went from East to West -- MacEvilley clearly rejects this
hypothesis but he does however contenance the possibility that there
was an influence specifically from Pyrrhonist type of scepticism to
early Madhyamika.  For myself, like Nagarjuna, I have no views on this
:)
