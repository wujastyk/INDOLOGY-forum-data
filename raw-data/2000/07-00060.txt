Dear members of the net!

A colleague of mine has a question which I would like forward to the
Indology group as I believe somebody out there would be able to answer it.

Question: How does one approach the Library of Congress? Is it costly?

The person asking the question has the email address:
bjarne.skov at media.uio.no

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
