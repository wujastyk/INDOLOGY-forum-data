Honestly, I dont give a damn what you consider about me or anyone else.
I am interested in knowing and understanding  Indias history and
will pursue that.

Also, I have been on this list for many years now and know enough
of Indology - so as not to take the words of europeanist academics
at face value.

I must add that the list members are also intelligent enough to know logthe
difference between invasions and migrations to see through your doublespeak.
