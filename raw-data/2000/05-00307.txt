elsewhere based on the Anup Sanskrit Library catalogue (in "From Babylon
to Bikaner") is a staggeringly thorough tour-de-force, to take a single
example.

To call Seidenberg's (note spelling) work "deeper" is to do no more than
express an emotional preference for the work.  That is fine, but it is not
scholarship.  Seidenberg's work is different, not deeper.  He comes to
different conclusions.  That's not deep, particularly.

A small number of Pingree's arguments are unpopular amongst people who
want to valorize the history of Indian science as a priority.  But the
establishing of truth in this area is a matter for very detailed and
careful scholarship, carried out by experts.  In his many critical
editions of foundation texts, including the Yavanajataka and the
Pancasiddhantika, as well as in CESS and other survey works, Pingree has
himself provided much of the basic foundational evidence that future
scholars need to take up these questions.

It just won't do to try to denigrate Pingree's scholarship with vague,
general characterizations.  If you like the heat, get into the kitchen!
