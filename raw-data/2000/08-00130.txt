   In all haste, I am rather bogged down right now: To be on the
   safe side, I would like to say that I did not make the remark above.

   Not my comment either.


I never said you said this.  My original posting
started with:

       "On Mon, 7 Aug 2000, nanda chandran wrote:

whereas lines marked with "> >" came from you.
However, I well appreciate that you want to
make it even clearer to casual readers that
you din't say the above things.  OK, that's natural.

Best wishes,


Raja.
