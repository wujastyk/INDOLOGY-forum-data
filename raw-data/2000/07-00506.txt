Subject: Rajaram's "horse seal"
Message-ID: <161227060476.23782.12402321589200247987.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The discussion of N.S. Rajaram's "horse seal" has continued over

S. Talageri, V. Agarwal, K. Elst, and a number of others. Rajaram
finally revealed this morning (as I suggested on this List a
while back) that his "horse seal" was "computer enhanced."

The evidence (not mentioning the computer enhancement, but
otherwise complete) is newly summarized at:
