Namaskar,

The only thing about "mosques destroyed by Hindus"
is that there is no such mosques. Unlike Islam, and
Christianity, Hindu scriptures don't call for
destruction of religious symbols, prayer places
and altars of other religions.

What proof do you have for "mosques destroyed by
Hindus?"

Truth is indeed two edged sword. We shouldn't lie
about others because we are not willing to face
truth about ourselves.

Politics begins when instead of addressing the
the point of asking for the land, material
and property looted after Hindu temples were
destroyed by Muslim invaders in Bharat, one
brings up the myth of "mosques destroyed by
Hindus?"
