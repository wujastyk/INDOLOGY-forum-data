                 SUMMER SCHOOL IN SPOKEN SANSKRIT


The Department of Classical Indology, South Asia Institute, University
of Heidelberg, Germany, offers you this unique opportunity to
participate in a spoken Sanskrit course this summer under the tutelage
of a Sanskrit native speaker. It is the aim of the course to enable
students, particularly those pursuing Indological Studies, to overcome
the perception of Sanskrit as a written language alone and, instead, to
learn to pronounce, speak and recite it. The three-week course will make
the study of Sanskrit a playful experience and demystify it.

 Organizer:         Prof. Dr. Axel Michaels
 Teachers:          Shri Sadananda Das, aided by Dr. Srilata Mueller
