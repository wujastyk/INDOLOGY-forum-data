I add as well a new link mentioned briefly by M. Witzel on one aspect of
this kind of mythologizing -- involving K. N. Sethna's widely repeated
claims that chariots are supposedly depicted on Harappan inscriptions ("Is
Sethna's Chariot Pulled by Rajaram's Horse?"). There is obvious a partly
humourous intent to the webpage, which was composed to counter S.
Kalyanaraman's defense of "Rajaram Horse II," but it introduces new evidence
as well.
See: <http://www.safarmer.com/sethna/pseudochariot.html>

As for the telephone/water trough object in the rajaram seal it is nothing
more than blurred text lines
see http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/rajaram.htm
So it looks like s farmer and co want to keep silent on this issue. Come Mr,
farmer if you are such an aficionado for truth why gloss over this fact.
Whatever people may say about rajarams forgery/artistic license/over
enthusiasm lets not make counter forgeries.

As for KD sethna's chariot. Can you come up with a better explanation.
1) Is it an early ad for water world showing kevin kostener with webbed
feet.
2) Is it an ekimo wearing snow shoes in sindh
3) Its a babe wearing one of those new fangled aerobic shoes.

K D sethnas conjecure is not so bad.
It looks like a man standing on a chariot   facing you. The wheels are oval
because of fore shortening. It is a stylization, a doodle. Nobody is going
to make a portrait out of a script sign.
The spoked oval/wheel object has also been showed as a circle  a fact you
want to gloss over.
you seemd to have missed out on a vital aspect of neural development wherein
the brain can reproduce 3-d in art. By the way no malice intended I am
tarring K D sethna with the same brush going by his redrawing of the wheels.

>
Also do you want to deny the presense of 2 wheeled vehicles in harappa.
Perhaps its just the spokes which are troubling you.

You lucked out with a cracked seal earlier but it does not mean you can just
go ahead and make dumb assertions about everything. There is no crack here.
