I do not know how the Tamil classification, not found in any other
language groups, of "Idangai/valngai" will be "better candidates for
ethnicity". In India or elsewnhere in the world, it is not used in academia.
Does anyone advocate this?

By the way, there is nothing wrong in something good coming from
outside and using it. For example, human flight machines - though
"brihad-vimAna-shastrams" tell us that planes were invented in
India.
