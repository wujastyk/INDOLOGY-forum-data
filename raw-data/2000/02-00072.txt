There have been important changes at the IGNCA in New Delhi.  A salvo of
criticism was aimed at the institution by the journalist Talveen Singh in
India Today, at the end of last year, which highlights some of the common
perceptions about difficulties at IGNCA (see
http://www.india-today.com/itoday/19991011/singh.html).

More recently, the major changes in the board of Trustees were reported in
the January 24 issue of the same magazine
(http://www.india-today.com/itoday/20000124/arts.html).

The new Member Secretary of the IGNCA is C. N. R. Shetty, former VC of
Bangalore University.  He replaces Kapila Vatsyayan (who was Academic
Director after being Memb. Sec.)
