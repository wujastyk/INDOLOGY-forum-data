tenure-track position in South Asian religions, at the Assistant
Professor level, starting Fall 2001. Ph.D.s are preferred, A.B.Ds will
be considered. The successful candidate for the position will be able
to teach introductory and advanced courses in Hinduism, as well as
introductory courses in Islam. We are especially interested in a
scholar who works historically or ethnographically and who can address
historical and contemporary intersections between Hindu and Muslim

interested in other kinds of intersections. The teaching load is 3-2.
All tenure-track members of our department will be expected to
contribute to our junior seminar on theory and methods in the study of
religion. The members of the department share interest in theoretical
issues of comparison, religious diversity, and the construction of
religious identities and differences.

interest in undergraduate teaching in a liberal-arts environment in
