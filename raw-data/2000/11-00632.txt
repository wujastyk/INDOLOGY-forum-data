During the muhurtam, the public wedding ceremonies, brides wear
red by custom.

The "pallo" is important, and  without the broad pallo, the white dress
is considered fit only for widows. An ancient Tamil poem describing this:

  kozunan2ai illAL *kaRaiyum*, vazi niRkum
   ciRRAL illAtAn2 kaim mOtiramum - paRRiya
  kOl kOTi vAzum aracum ivai mUn2Rum
   cAlpOTu paTTatu ila

                       (from patin2eNkIzkkaNakku)

After the Tamil kingdoms (Pallavas, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas) declined,
Vijayanagar arises and upstarts become kings. The Vijayanagar dress
was influenced by Islam a lot. Do the muslim brides wear white
during wedding or nuptials? May be without pallo?

Thanks,
SM
