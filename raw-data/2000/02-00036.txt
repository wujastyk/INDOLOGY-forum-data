Good evening,

Being new to the study of Indian philosophy, and doing so in a very 
solitary manner, I have recently encountered a slight difficulty 
establishing if the Isha Upanishad, and the "Eesa" Upanishad (out of which 
I have only a fragment) are the one and same text. This is, as you have 
guessed, due primarily to my lack of knowledge of sanskrit, which will be 
duly fixed as time permits. If the answer is not already apparent to the 
readers of which list, which would surprise me, here are the two fragments 
that comparatively plunge me into confusion concerning their dis/similitude.
