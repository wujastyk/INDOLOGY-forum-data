Dear members of the net!

I would like to look into how the Vedas and Vedic religion is being presented
to a wider audience in India today. In this connection, I am looking for books
that aim at explaining Vedic knowledge/Vedic philosophy/Vedic religion to the
more or less educated layman. The books should be in either English or Hindi. I
have tried to have a look at the various Internet book sellers and I have found
a number of titles that might be of interest, but it would be extremely helpful
if some of you had any suggestions that would make me find my way quicker to
the most relevant books.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
