Once more on copyright.
We surely have to keep(or have possibly been kept in the Buddhist sense :-))
the distance from the ORIGINALITY or creativity a dictionary has, which,
however, does not simply comes from the FACT of the exchangeable value of
meaning between the two different languages, I think.

It is a breach of copyright law to make the copy in the first place, not
just to distribute it.  Even in private, for one's own use.  Still not
legal.
