Subject: Book announcement:  First publication from the BMSC Project
Message-ID: <161227065467.23782.4013298785102659705.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I forward here the announcment of a new publication. I myself have
seen a copy, and can assure our Indological colleagues--those
interested in philology, anyway, rather than polemics--that this is a
book you will want to have. If nothing else, the very names of the
contributors guarantee the highest quality.

Please also make sure that your library orders a copy; the
continuation of the series very much depends on the success of vol. 1
(I mean commercially; the scholarly success is assured).

The book can be ordered through the email included in the message below:
