Subject: Indologist writings on the Web like R. Eaton
Message-ID: <161227065556.23782.15255197663250237676.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There are several books that will be useful for folks interested in
South Asian studies:

Totally free of cost!!

Richard M. Eaton
The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760. This book can be
read for free at:
http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/6108.html

Eaton has done part I, Temple desecration in pre-modern India which
has appeared in the latest Frontline.

Have a qn./suggestion to Indologists:
There are only about (perhaps) 200 or so serious researchers on
pre-modern India in the West. Only, they and their affliated
university libraries can afford the Indological academic publications.
Given the rupee/dollar ratio, and poor funding of humanities and
libraries in India, would it be possible to put more books written on
Indian history, etc. on the web along the lines of Berkeley
initiative? The readership market will grow exponentially as India
gets wired to the web more and more. The latest critiques and theories
will reach more pf Indian public, now they are given only hindutva
publications of Rajararam, etc. and euhemeristic authors like Malti
Shendge.

I'd guess Indologists may not mind putting their books, articles on
the web because most of their research is accomplished by funding from
tax money. UC at Berkeley is showing a way to procure funds.

Any thoughts?

Regards,
V. Iyer
