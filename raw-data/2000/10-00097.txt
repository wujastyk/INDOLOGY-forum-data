Honored members of the list!

Wanting to update my indological library, I would be grateful for some
bibliographic advice on the latest, state-of-the art introductions to
Indian philosophy. (Indian philosophy in general as well as more specialist
studies of Vedanta, Samkhya etc.)

All suggestions are appreciated!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
