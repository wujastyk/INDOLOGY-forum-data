Concerning the sgra-sbyor, see for example Simonsson's study:
	Simonsson, Nils: Indo-tibetische Studien : die Methoden
	der tibetischen ?bersetzer ... / von Nils Simonsson. -- 1.
	-- Uppsala : Almqvist & Wiksells Boktryckeri, 1957, S.
	266-268 (on bhagavat)

The sgra-sbyor explains why bhagavat is translated as bcom ldan
'das. Indeed, it does not seem to represent tantric ideas.
