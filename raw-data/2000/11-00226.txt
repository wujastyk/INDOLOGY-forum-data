Subject: etymology of mani
Message-ID: <161227063889.23782.14620515581076919454.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

'>'Dear listmembers,
'>'
'>'If mani, "jewel" etc., is a non-IE, indigenous Indian word, why and how was
'>'it accepted into Hurrian? Is there a reasonable etymology? Is the word
'>'known in Dravidian languages and what does it mean in these languages?

    In ancient and modern Tamil maNi means jewel.
    I think this stems from the root sense
    of 'maN' = dense, hard, concentrated.
