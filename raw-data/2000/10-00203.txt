You persist in making wild claims that that neither care to cite any previously
published studies nor respect the bounds of discussions prescribed for this
group.
I have not seen a single reference in any of your postings over the last year
or so.
I wonder whether I am in the Indology group or some chat club.

...
To quote George Hart from "Poems of Ancient Tamil: Their Milieu and their
Sanskrit Counterparts", page 118 when he describes how the concept of  chastity
spread from Tamil society.

"...before a group was assimilated, Brahmins would come into it and adopt those
values most admired by that group in order to gain respect. Thus the custom
would have gained a foothold in the Brahmanic religion and would be perpetuated
when descendants of the Brahmins wrote lawbooks or copied texts with the
appropriate insertions..."
So instead of the Brahmins granting recognition to Tamil elements it has been
them acting to save themselves from being swept aside by the Tamil movement.

So you would say that the optimal situation would be when the Tamil brahmins
are  neither viewed by non-brahmins as Aryans nor claimed/believed by
themselves to be Aryans?
