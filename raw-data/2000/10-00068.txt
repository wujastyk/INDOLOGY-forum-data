Subject: parallels to a key word in a Sunda/Upasunda story
Message-ID: <161227062192.23782.14303363532510956308.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Hitopadeza 4.8 (or 9, depending on the version), in the story of
Sunda and Upasunda they fight over a woman (here ParvatI), and decide
to appeal to an arbiter (pramANapuruSa), who here is in fact Ziva.
Are there parallels to this account in which a similar word for a
judge or arbiter appears (or even the same word--it is this word I am
in fact interested in)? (In MBh I.201-204 there is no judge--they
just fight and kill each other, as of course ultimately they do in
Hitopadeza too).
