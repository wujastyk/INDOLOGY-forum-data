This is of course rather interesting. Campantar seems
to show up as a pious bigot. Is he perhaps making a
snide attack on Dharmasena (Appar) for having been a
Jaina? It is probably not easy for him to forget this
fact considering his vitriolic hatred for the Jainas.

After all he seems to be calling them all kinds of
names:

"scoundrels" (3.297.1),
"filthy" (3.297.2),
"blind fools", "apes" (your quote),
"rogues" (3.297.11, 3.305.1),
"evil" (3.305.4),
"destructive" (3.305.10),
"wicked" (3.3.05.11),
"indecent" (3.366.1),
"base" (3.366.3),
"emaciated" (3.366.11)

(Transl. and verse numbering from Peterson's Poems to
Siva)

Thanks and Warm Regards,
