Subject: h after t and d in S. Indian transliterations
Message-ID: <161227059178.23782.1884952191582118336.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I notice that South Indian publications when using Anglicisations or
informal Romanizations of Sanskrit terms often add h after d dental
and possibly t dental.  Why is this?  Could it be that since English t
and d are alveolar rather than really dental and so are in between
Indic dentals and retroflexes, the h brings the tongue forward against
the teeth and so to the Dravidian speaker represents a dental better,
whereas an English dental would sound closer to a retroflex?
