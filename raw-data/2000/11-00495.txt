  No. The word is never pronounced as "namas", except when required by sandhi rules. 


Sorry, but i would beg to differ with this opinion, and I have recordings by various excellent pandits to back it up. Of course, the visarga can have three or more different pronunciations. In the "middle" of a sequence, it seems to be most proper to pronounce it without the "echo" but rather as what might be described as a strongly pronounced short "a" final. This would be like the normal short "a" sound in "Veda," but distinctly shorter and stronger. If the visarga comes at the end of a "sequence," then the second pronunciation would be a rather strong echo of the last sound. Third would be the "as" sound. The fourth would be an echo, but very soft, more like a distinct outflow of breath.
