>?From the point of view of the Dravidian, all are `outsiders', whether
Aryan, Brahman, Turk or Saka. And the outsiders appear to have helped one
another, fearful of an indigenous uprising.

The medieval Sanskrit term Turuska is a hangover from the days of Kushan
and Tokharian invasions. The Aryans confounded the later Muslim Turks
with the previous Buddhist Turks. The preceding Buddhist and Zoroastrian
`Turuskas' (ie. Rajputs) actively participated in the army of the Islamic
Turkic sultanate, forming more than half of Aurangzeb's army. The army was
thus a `Turuska' army for the medieval writers.
