I assume that you are not convinced about Yavanas  in India.

You can find the Heliodorus inscription (in central
India) photo and text in
The Indo_Greeks
by A.K. Narain
1957, Oxford Univ Press

and photographs of Indo-Greek coins with Vasudev/Balabhadra in
Mathura : The Cultural Heritage

As Klaus Karttunen wrote javaNalivi is mentioned as one of the
18 scripts in Jain literature. The Yavanas in India were
Indo-greeks, having originated from the Greek colonies in Balkh
region. Some of the Yavanas had settled as far as Tamilnadu
in India.

What I was wondering about is: could JaavaNiiya have been Yaavaniiya
rather than Yaapaniiya.
