Subject: LOOKING FOR A WEB SITE FOR BROADER INDOLOGY DISCUSSIONS ?
Message-ID: <161227061917.23782.7003800313940855960.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

My field is not literature but I have interest in broader issues which can
be called Indology . I find that my interests often are not intended for
this group which is meant primarily for those having interest in
literature .

Any one knowing about such a web site , pl post it on this web site .

I want to respond to the questions raised here on the following issues:

1. Jantar Mantar

2. What language did Buddha Speak ?

Thanks.
