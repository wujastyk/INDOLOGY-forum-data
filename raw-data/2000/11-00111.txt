POINT ONE > It is unlikely that no signs would remain of ancient settlements
because of flooding.When one seeks to connect literary evidence  with the
archaeological,one must suppose that the latter exists.After all ,we do have
archaelogical "history" of India 7000BC onwards,even if there are gaps.Since
in any case it is not easy to connect material evidence with the  ORAL
literary / linguistic tradition,one must allow for "huge error bars " in the
profferred interpretations

POINT TWO >1000BC is a round date for the Bharata battle. It could go a
century this way or that. Nobody has ever placed the event later than about
900/850 BC.I would personally feel more comfortable with -100 rather than
+100.
