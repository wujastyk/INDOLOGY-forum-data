Thats very true... Most of our Historians are still
continuing from where the Brits left...
Its something like.. if someone was asked to write
about numerals...
if Brits (for their personal gains) started writing
about "A", "B", "C" and then left.. our Historians
instead of "1", "2", "3" have started with "D", "E"
etc etc..

Only God save our history from such historians..

Vikrant
