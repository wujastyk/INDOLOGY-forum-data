>Many medieval works refer to raagas called .dombakriti, .dombakriyaa,

>.dombi, and .dombikaa. A taala called .dombuli is recorded as a popular
>(desii) one.

And the word is supposed to be the origin of the self-designation of
European Gypsies,
Roma; Rom, fem. Romni,
(who seem to be first recorded as wandering musicians at the court of a
Persian king, on their way westwards to N.Africa/Europe).

Domba (=Pkt), Dumba, Doma in Kashmiri Skt.texts.
