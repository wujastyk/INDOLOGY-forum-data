Subject: Questions about non-Tamil Jain, Buddhist and Ajivika beliefs
In-Reply-To: <"from Palaniappa"@AOL.COM>
Message-ID: <161227065018.23782.17506630700496827626.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

For the attitudes of early Jains on some of these issues, one would do
well to read:

  Johnson, W. J. _Harmless Souls: Karmic Bondage and Religious Change
  in Early Jainism with special reference to Umasvati and Kundakunda_
  (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1995)

This is still available from MB.

Another work which is especially valuable is:

 Shah, N. J., ed., _Jaina Philosophy and Religion [English trans. of
 Jaina Darshana by Muni Shri Nyayavijayaji_ (Delhi: Bhogilal Lehar
 Chand Institute of Indology & Mahattara Sadhvi Shree Mrigavatiji
 Foundation, 1998)

This is also still available from MB.


Hope this is of some assistance,

 Richard Mahoney
