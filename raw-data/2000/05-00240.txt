Those interested in Ancient Indian Mnemonics may also wish to be reminded of
Charles Malamoud's article regarding memory in ancient India:

"Par coeur: Note sur le jeu de l'amour et de la m?moire dans la po?sie de
l'Inde ancienne"
in Cuire le monde: rite et pens?e dans l'Inde ancienne
(Paris:  Editions la D?couverte, 1989), 295-306.
