>?From this verb "aaNi" seems to come from.

The retroflex letters like n, (written .n or N),
in Indian languages are supposed to come from
Dravidian. Note that the systemic retroflexion
(not spontaneous sporadic ones) is lacking in the sister
languages of Mundas in East India and in old Iranian.

The common verbs, "Ur-tal" and "nakar-tal" have
the same meaning: to crawl, to move slowly, to creep.
(You can check on-line Tamil lexicon from the
University of Cologne). Ur is the Dravidian village
name, so much so it or its variants like "oura" etc.,
are used to look for Dravidian in Indian toponymy.
"nakar" is also like "Ur", and nagara appears
to be a loanword in Sanskrit from this.

This word is maNi meaning jewel or grain. I agree
with Prof. Selvakumar that for grains/jewels have
something to do with 'maN' = dense, hard, concentrated.
