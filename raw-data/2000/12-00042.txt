In a previous message you had said that Aryan was merely a language.

How in the world can you identify a Aryan speaking
warrior by his sperm ?

This kind of idea belongs to the 18th and 19th century and
most people that such ideas died in 1945 at the end of WWII.Unfortunately it
seems to be alive and thriving in Europe.
