Vishvanath Kashinath Rajvade, the Marathi historian and scholar of
Jnaneshwari was born on June 24 1863 and died on Jan 1, 1927.  His older
brother Vaijnath Kashinath Rajvade was the scholar who worked on the RV
and the Nirukta.  He was born on Feb 27, 1860 and died on December 17,
1944.  The obituary notice about the latter may be found in the Annals of
the BORI, vol 25, 1944 (published in 1945), pp. 266-268.  The younger
Rajvade was known more widely among the scholars of the history of Marathi
and Maharashtra.  A biography of his has been published by S.S. Puranik in
Marathi: Vizvanaath Kaazinaath Raajavaa.de : Vyaktitva kart.rtva va
vicaar, Raviraj Prakashan, Pune, 1989.
