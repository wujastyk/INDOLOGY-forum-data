Dear Ven. Tantra

I agree entirely with what you say about the importance of heresy and
heretics, I was just querying the usefulness of the terms as sometimes used
in the list.  I think non-European scholars often use these words to
translate fairly neutral Sanskrit, Pali etc terms for other religious
groups.  I was seeking to point out that these words have extremely
powerful connotations for Europeans, which may give an impression entirely
different from what the writer intended.
