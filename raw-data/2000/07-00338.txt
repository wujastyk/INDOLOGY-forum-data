Rather, an Alexander by [sheer ] luck > very lucky person.


>>>How common is "taqdiir kaa sikandar" as an expression 
       in Urdu? in Hindi? 
The expressions are "taqdeer kaa baadshaah" or "muqaddar kaa
sikandar"."taqdiir kaa sikandar" seems to be a cros-phrase.

>>>Any other Indian languages have equivalents (with sikandar)? 
 NO, as far as I know. There are expressions with luck/fortune and King 
Vikrama/King Bhoja in Bengali/Hindi/Oriya. 

>>>Has Alexander's name been remembered in India/Pakistan ever 
     since his trip to Pakistan? 

The earliest reference to Sikandar in Hindi Literature is in the 16th century
Hindi poem "PadumAvat" by JAyasI [Bk. 1, verse-group 13, where JAyasI compares
his patron Sher Shah to "iskandar"].
Sikandar or Al-sikandar seems to be a theme in the Perso-Arabic source of
South Asian cultural history, rather than in the Sanskritic [Indo-Aryan]
source.
