    From Vedic literature (thus, excluding the at least one hundred passages
where the nakula- is mentioned in Mahaabhaarata and Raamaayana, as well as
interesting passages from Dharma texts, Kau.tilya and Vaagbha.t.ta), I find
in my database the following (selected) interesting passages:

I hope this helps. please check in the Mahaabhaarata yourself, because it
seems to be full of interesting passages.

> Dear list-members,

> I am looking for further information about how the relation between
> snakes and mongoose was conceived of by ancient Indian writers, as well
> as perhaps - though this is not strictly speaking "INDOLOGY-stuff" - the
> distribution of mongoose in (ancient) India.
> My starting-point is the famous list of seven inferential connections,
> attested for the ancient SAMkhya treatise "SaSTitantra", which features
> a "relation between killer and killed" (vadhyaghAtakabhAva), said to
> obtain between a snake and a mongoose. To the best of my knowledge, it
> is not specified in older sources what an inference based on such a
> relation might look like. Much later sources (VAcaspatimizra's
> NyAyavArttikatAtparyaTIkA or Udayana's KiraNAvalI) seem to assume that
> when a snake (ahi) emits a certain sound (visphUrjanazabda - a hissing
> sound?), one infers that a mongoose (nakula) is present in proximity. I
> would interpret this as indicating that this particular sound of a snake
> is caused by the presence of the mongoose as its enemy.
> It is obvious that snake and mongoose were thought of as mutual enemies,
> though the few available descriptions that provide more details on the
> consequences of their mutual hostility vary: In a passage in the
> NyAyavArttikatAtparyaTIkA, the snake (sarpa) is described as
> "victorious" (jaya) and the mongoose (nakula) as the one who is defeated
> (parAjaya); in a much earlier passage in DignAga's
> PramANasamuccayavRtti, the snake (*ahi) is described as defeated and the
> mongoose (*nakula) as victorious.
