 From the "Eesa" Upanishad:

Andham tamah pravisan?i ? avidy?m up?sat? |
Tat? bh?ya ?va t? tam?ya ? vidyayam rat?h ||...9

    Blind dark worlds they enter, [andhah, tamah, pravisanti,] those that 
perform rituals alone,  [ye, avidyaam, upasate,] into still blinding darker 
worlds they will go, [tato, bhooya,iva,tey] those that take delight in 
ascetic meditation   [ye, u, vidyayam,rataah ]
