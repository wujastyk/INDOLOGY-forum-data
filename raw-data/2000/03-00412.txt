Prof. von Simson's reference is informative with regard to insistence in
Tamil circles that Aravan's (Skt. Iravat's) sacrifice takes place on a new
moon day. This sacrifice to Kali does denote the beginning of the war,
though how the eighteen days would be counted therefrom is something I
have not learned.
