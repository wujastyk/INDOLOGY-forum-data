True engough.

<<Now we go back to the paper plane. The way english is represented
by its
alphabet is conceptually not a vast improvement over sumerian. The
letters
can mean so many things depending on context. And the speaker has to
memorize each word. Its only the human brain which is peculiarly
suited to
memorizing a large number of context switches which makes the use
such of
such a poor conceptual system possible.>>

Come on, it's not _that_ bad.  If you were raised in India, surely
you had phonics, unlike the idiotic "total language" system used in
much of the US nowadays (learn each word separately).  Indeed, some
students of the question argue that the spelling in some ways
represents the deep structure of the language
