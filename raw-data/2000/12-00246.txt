I don't think any topic related to Indology can be excluded on a list titled
"Indology". But this is a scholars' list, so posters must at least pretend
they are writing a serious research paper for publication and use suitable
language to request or share information, and avoid spilling or leaking the
conclusions of their research on the list even while they collect data.

Even if the purpose is to study a paper or book already published (recently
or long ago), still I see no reason why it must be discussed for the sake of
discussion other than with the intention to share or collect data for
writing another serious followup paper on the topic.

Regards
Bhadraiah
