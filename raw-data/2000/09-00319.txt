 D. Frawley echoes the same views on this "original Prakrit":
 "The idea that the same culture cannot produce two different
 language systems may itself be questionable. It may have been
 the very power of Vedic culture and its sages, with their
 mastery of the word, that they could have produced not only
 Indo-European like languages but also Dravidian."

See the S. Kak on "Sanskrit-Tamil-Telugu" language family in

You have argued that the Aryan-Dravidian divide simply doesn't
exist, and that the superficial differences between North and South
India are overlaid on a unified cultural foundation.

S. Kak's reply:
The concept of an Aryan-Dravidian divide is a by-product of the racist
discourse of the 19th century. It was this racism that postulated a single
language from which all modern languages were derived. Linguists now
acknowledge that there must have existed very many language families in
the past and what has survived represents complex interactions between
different peoples and languages, many of which have left no trace. It is also
being recognized that while by one reckoning Sanskrit, Greek and Latin
belong to a family; by another, Sanskrit and Tamil and Telugu belong to
another. Linguists are now talking of the concept of a linguistic area and
the whole of India is one such area.
