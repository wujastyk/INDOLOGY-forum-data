This is a slightly different proposition. There is no doubt that English is the
language "on the attack" in the EU area for a large number of reasons. The
French may not be happy about this, and the Germans may want German to be just
as important as French and English, but the tidal wave moves in another
direction. What I had in mind was "official" politics, and I don't think that
the EU could survive politically if English was chosen the one and only
official link language. All languages are in principle to have equal status,
even if this is becoming increasingly unpractical.

As for English, this is most certainly true, and as for Hindi, certainly not
impossible. But English is not being promoted as the EU's "national language",
and its preeminence is first and foremost due to the enormous economic and
cultural impact of the United States. Without the US, the EU might be opting
for French rather than English, given the traditional cultural prestige of
French. Thus, the promotion of Hindi is a political affair, whereas English
promotes itself through its sheer force and the advantages that come with it.
