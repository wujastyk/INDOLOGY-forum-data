Subject: parallels to a key word in a Sunda/Upasunda story
Message-ID: <161227062425.23782.14032336462661013087.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In the traidional south indian society, there used be an office of
"Madhyasthan", which as the name implies middle man or arbitrator. I
remember seeing this word appear in a Tamil inscription quoted in Burton
Stein book "Peasant State and Society in Medievel South India"
