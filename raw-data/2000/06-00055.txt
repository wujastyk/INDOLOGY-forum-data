We don't know that he attained samAdhi in the accepted sense, because
such an event is not mentioned anywhere, and no samAdhi of his is to
be found (unlike for Ramanuja, etc.).  He is said to have disappeared
from view in some sense (exactly what remains unclear), and the date
for this is established as 1317.  See Sharma, B.N.K., `History of the
Dvaita School of Vedanta and Its Philosophy', Motilal Banarsidass, 3d
ed., Jan. 2000.
