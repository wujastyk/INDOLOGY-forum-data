Dear members,
I hope the following can be of some help.
It seems from my works on Mac (since System 6.5 until 9.0.4), that this
problem stand with Microsoft Word, mainly between the key of Word 5.1 and
the ones of Word 98. This last version use by default some of the key for
some of his functions (that you can manage from the Word 98 menu "option")
that in the previous version were free and so used by the previous creators
of "alternative" keyboards layout.
So, what to do now: or you can deal with the menu "option" of Word 98 and
get free those key combinations that you need to tape the sanskrit fonts,
or try to find a new keyboard layout made on the new setting of Word 98.
That's my view,
Federico Squarcini
