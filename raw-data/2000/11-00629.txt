Thanks for your response. I'll try to get hold of this article.

I have not found anything factual to suggest that YS was originally written
in other than SKT language. This possibility occured to me as the result of
my attempts to interprete YS independently from Vyaasa commentary.
The text has peculiar structure with a lot of ellipsis-like gaps
that might be the result of translation from other language while attempting
to make word-by-word translation. That is all.

So I decided to make a little excursion into the textual history of it.

Best regards, Dmitri.
