You are scared twice by rhetorics.  Suppose I say
I study plasma in interstellar space, would you get scared?

Please take the above and many as rhetoric.  Scholarship is
pursuit of knowledge and not being scared by language.

Lately I study cognition, perception and neurology.
The debate and the techniques of debate interest me.
You may look up www.hms.harvard.edu/research/brain
for some of our latest work.

Last point: please don't be scared by trivial language expressions.
