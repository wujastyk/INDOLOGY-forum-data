--> You do not say who you mean by "they", but let me tell you who "they"
are. By "they", you are referring to S.N. Dasgupta (see his "Indian
idealism" and the 1st vol. of his "History of Indian Philosophy); D.P.
Chattopadhyaya (see his "What is living and what is dead in Indian
Philosophy"); Satkari Mookherjee (see the "Nana-nalanda Mahavira Research
Publications 1957" (of which he is editor); and also his "Budhist Philosophy
of Universal Flux"); Stcherbatsky (see his "Conception of Budhist Nirvana
and "Budhist Logic"); and also, with some reservations,  S.Radhakrishnan
(2nd vol. of his "Indian Philosophy") and B.N.K. Sharma (see the 1st vol. of
his "History of Dvaita school of Vedanta and its literature"). I am sure
there are other scholars who have drawn similar conclusions; this is just a
prelimnary list.

--> Suffice to say ur implication that these scholars have failed to
understand the Advaita and the Mahayana appears to be a little  presumptious
on ur part.

--> The Vedanta schools actually have several differences, ontological and
epistemological (the epistemological differences between dvaita and advaita
are significant). The chief difference, however, lies in the interpretation
of the Upanisads (since there exist "bheda sruti" and "abheda sruti", and
these have to be reconciled).


The
>Advaitin accepts "realist" epistemology and "idealist"
>ontology. (The quotation marks are important; I use
>these terms with reservations.)

--> Your claim appears to be incorrect. Advaitins are idealistic in both
epistemology and ontology as is agreed by all major writers on Indian
philosophy. (Kindly see the list of writers i mentioned for references to
Advaitist epistemology.)Sankar's Adhyaya bhasya (available as a translation
by Thibaut) contains a description of his epistemology. [I'll e-mail this to
you, if you wish.] For a general denunciation of reasoning itself, kindly
see Sankar's Vedanta bhasya ((ii.1.11)) [ i am personally relying on George
Thibaut's translation of this.]

[ The epistemology of Dvaita Vedanta, however, is realist.]


For the Advaitin, the

--> If by "nihilism", you mean that the Madhyamaka's are atheists, then you
are right. If you believe that they do not subscribe to an Ultimate Reality,
then it would seem you are wrong. See D.P. Chattopadhyaya's "What is living
and what is dead in Indian Philosophy", and S.N. Dasgupta's
"Indian idealism" for more on this.

Now,

--> Pratitya samutpada is the law of universal flux; i agree that Advaitists
do not agree with this. They do agree with paratantra, as i will make clear
in a subseq. post. The sunyavadi's way of equating the world with the
ultimate reality is strikingly similar to that of the Advaitists (although i
agree that differences do exist between sunyavada and Advaita, but these are
minor as compared to the similarites between them). Again, see the list of
writers i gave before.

--> These accusations have been leveled against the Advaita for centuries,
even by other Vedantists (including both the Dvaita Vedantists and
Visistadvaitists). Eminenent modern scholars agree with the accusations.
Surely it is not inappropriate to inquire into the matter.

I hope Hinduism and its schools receive
>the same respect eventually. Non-Indians have to do it
>first, before Indians interested in Indian philosophies
>will accept it.

--> my hope is that other hindu philosophies (Mimansa, Sankhya, Lokayata,
Nyaya-Vaisesik, Dvaita Vedanta, etc.), and not just the Advaita Vedanta,
will be treated with respect eventually.

>Except for the traditional Pundits, a
>highly reviled class nowadays,

--> there is no basis for this claim of yours. I have personally attended a
function at Benaras Hindu University at which a High Court judge gave a
lecture and took part in discussions with the Sanskrit scholars at the
university. (He was talking about the Mimansa principles of interpretations,
and how one could use it in jurisprudence, and more practically, in the
cases before him.)

--> if this was directed at me, i accept your charge. I do not know
Sanskrit, although i am trying to learn it.

>hey rely

--> This is a slap in the face on all the genuine scholars in India, who are
working on these issues.

--> Yes, that is my reaction to what you wrote.

I hope there is some scholar out there, who is

--> Much work has been done on this by Dasgupta, Chattopadhyaya, Satkari
Mookherjee, Stcherbatsky and others, although i agree that more work needs
to be done on this.
