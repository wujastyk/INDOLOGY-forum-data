I suggest that you write to Lakshmi Srinivas and ask him whether
he is a woman (I must admit that I too would have preferred to see
his name written as Lakshmisrinivas, but that is the way it is).

So much for your self-proclaimed Indian expertise on India. Further
comment seems unnecessary.

No, at times I only bait the arrogant, malicious and pretentious
(Hindu or otherwise) and enjoy seeing them make fools of
themselves.

For instance: I was waiting for somebody to take Lakshmi Srinivas'
name and try to make fun of me. I am sooo happy that it was you
<grin>.
