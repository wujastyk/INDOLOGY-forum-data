The fact that the inner planets go around the sun is implcit in  Siddhantic calculations.I do not think it is explicitly stated except  perhaps in the later-day Kerala texts.Note when an outer planet goes around the sun,it goes around the earth also.
 
Aryabhatiyam is the oldest Sanskrit text (astronomical or otherwise) which is precisely dated,and it belongs to AD 473. This tells us how acute the problem of ancient Indian chronology is.It is not at all clear  on what basis Garga Samhita can be placed in 8th century BC (V. Iyer) .
