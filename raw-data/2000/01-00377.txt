A major upgrade of the devnag package is now available from

This version is numbered 2.0, and is the successor to v1.6 (there are no
versions 1.7, 1.8 or 1.9). It contains contributions from myself, Anshuman
Pandey, Dominik Wujastyk, Francois Patte, Marc Csernel and (I think)
Charles Wikner. Here is Anshuman's README file:
