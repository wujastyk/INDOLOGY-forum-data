Thanks for the reference. Previously, to my knowledge, biparental
inheritance of mtDNA had been seen in some bacteria, angiosperms and a
mollusc species. This recent discovery of paternal influence in hominid
species mtDNA will have far-reaching consequences for anthropological
conclusions based on genetic studies. Shows how science constantly forces
one to challenge long-held assumptions.

ps. It would be better not to use such terms as "bloodlines" with respect to
genetic evidence. They are extremely fuzzy, or worse still, meaningless in
the context.
