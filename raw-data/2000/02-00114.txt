Ashok,

You might email the U. Chicago South Asian Language and Area Center:

south-asia-outreach at uchicago.edu

and they could ask his friends in the faculty or perhaps get it from
the alumni office.  There is an online UC alumni directory but it can
only be searched by alumni.

There are thousands of Donald A. Nelsons in the FirstSearch online
home telephone directory but no Donald Allan Nelson.  Don moved to DC
around 1983 but I haven't seen him since about 1985.  There is one
Donald Nelson in the Virginia suburbs but his answering machine
message (703-494-8282) doesn't sound like Donald A. but has an
Appalachian accent.
