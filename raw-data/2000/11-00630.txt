 N. J. Allen himself writes in Hinduism as Indo-European,
 (p. 21, Aryan and Non-Aryan in South Asia, 1999)
 " However , Indology's general hostility to or neglect of Dumezil
 cannot be wholly explained by external factors. Explicit attacks
 on the content of his arguments have a long tradition (for a recent
 instance see Schlerath 1995-6) ..."

 B. Schlerath, 1995-6: Georges Dumezil und die Reconstruktion der
 indo-germanischen Kultur, Kratylos 40:1-48, 41:1-67

 Is there any critique on Allen's IE origins of yoga?

 Regards,
 SM
