But it doesn't look *that* recent, in terms of the proportions of the
female figure, the style of her headgear etc.

As for the iconography, if you or the owner of the piece live in South
India, why not show it (or a photo) to a traditionally-trained sculptor?
The Sthapatis carry in their memories a huge range of iconography, as
embodied in traditional verses etc, and may instantly recognise an image
that has defeated art-historians.  (I have seen this happen.)

If you manage to find anything out in this way, I would really like to know!
