I have received the following entirely cryptic message from someone at
BORI.  I guess the short answer is that bori1 at vsnl.net is the address to
use.

All the best,
Dominik

Sir,
     In above mentioned the e-mail address bori at ip.eth.net  is the old
address. But our running address is bori1 at vsnl.net. bori1 means Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute & one (1). This is the now obsolete address.
    Thanking you,

Office Superintendent.
BORI
