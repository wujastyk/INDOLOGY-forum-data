The standard model of when Sankaran maths were establised
by mainstream academic scholars is the 14th century: Sanskritists
and authorities on Indian philosophy like P. Hacker and
Indologist-Historians like H. Kulke. Don't recollect
Prof. Zydenbos or Dr. Palaniappan accepting your view
that Sankara himself established his matha at Shringeri.
Not knowing any work on dating of the Rigveda conducted
at Manitoba, Dr. Klostermaier's date is usually not taken
as the mainstream either.

There is a good study to be done in the future on the construction
of Sankaravijayam written by Madhava Vidyaranya. Many themes
come from Tamil literature:

Taking the view that Hindus or Muslims did not refer to any religious
entity,
V. Sundaresan wrote a while ago:

This is not the case in 14th century Karnataka empire.
See my post "Calling themselves Hindu in the 14th century"
for references. Tamil inscriptions abound where Hindus contrasted
themselves with invading Muslims. See Dr. Palaniappan's

That shows the genius of Maadhava Vidyaara.nya, and the cultural politics
he established. Vidyaranya and a Shaivaite guru Kriyasakti often appear
in the same inscription. Using his royal connections with the newly founded
Vijayanagar kingdom, and from viirasaiva and earlier kalamukha/pashupata
precedents, he built a temple to the dead (some decades earlier?)
Vidyasankara,
and founded the first Sankaran matha known so far to us from
inscriptions.

With kind regards,
