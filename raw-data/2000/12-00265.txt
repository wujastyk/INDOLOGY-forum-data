Dear members of the list,

is anybody of you aware of a translation of Nageza's "SphotavAda" into any European language(s)? The text was twice published, in the Adyar Library Bulletin and as a separate edition by V. Krishnamacharya, who also added  his own commentary Subodhini, in 1946. Its summary is available in the fifth volume of Encylopaedia of Indian philosophies (1990).

Very grateful in advance,
sincerely yours,
Dmitry Olenev
