Euhemerism is simply the technical name for what Shendge is
doing. The term refers back to the work of Euhemerus, fl. ca. 300
BCE, whose _Sacred History_ suggested that all ancient myths
could be traced back to specific historical events. Euhemeristic
models were quite popular in antiquity. Beyond Shendge, you would
be hard pressed to find any modern adherents. We are *not*
talking here -- to reply to one of your questions -- about single
acts of apotheosis.

Shendge not only applies this idea to Harappa -- like Rajaram &
co., anachronistically conflating Rgvedic and Harappan cultures
-- but also provides imaginative reconstructions in elaborate
detail of supposed historical events in the Indus Valley. Hence
the passage (one of hundreds similar) on the secret spy mission
of "Vishnu, the young, tall, lanky assistant of Indra." But I'm
an evidential scholar, Stephen. I'd be happy to discuss whatever
textual evidence you think lies behind this miraculous historical
reconstruction. Again, I'm especially interested in Indra's
"tall, lanky assistant" -- as well, of course, as in that Asuran
thunderbolt:
