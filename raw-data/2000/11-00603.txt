Subject: Q: Muslim women's Black veil
Message-ID: <161227064743.23782.10126684068403865542.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List,

Why do Muslim women wear black veil? Is it a symbol
of mourning and grief. Given that the 3 religions
of the Book strongly advocate Black and White duality,
and these seem to start from Indo-Iranian practices,
does the black veil symbolize grief?

Thanks.
