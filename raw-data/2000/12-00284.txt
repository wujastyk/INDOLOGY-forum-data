>?From Kampan, an usage where "aNa" is used. There are
several centuries older references than Kamban as well.

Few other questions in my mind that I need help from Indologists are:
Is "nAra" as 'water' a well attested IIr, IE word?
If so, what are the cognates?

Or, it is just that "nAra" = water was "invented"
to give a theological explanation to explain nArAyaNa
as from water?

If you can, pl. explain what Emeneau says on
the word sAi as in sAi bAbA. But Puttaparthi
is an incarnation of older Shirdi Saibaba, no??
Then, sAi in sAibaba is from the north India.

Are there attestations in old Kannada for
svAmi as sAi? Are they cited by Gowda-Emeneau?
Usually, in tamil jaina works, (who had contacts
with Kannada lands), svAmi is rendered cAmi,
and never as "sAi". Kannada usage would be
parallel, isn't it?

Also, where can I find Burnell's forward for
vamsha-brahmana? Who wrote/edited that book?
Is it in any library with Burnell's foreward?
Is vamsha brahmana published in a book form?
or, as an article? (about 150 years ago.)
