Hi all,
This is my first posting  to the egroup..i subscribed to it yesterday.
I was going through an article, where it says, UFO sightings during the
vedic period.
i was pretty excited on reading this.It also said that the Indians of that
time had powerful nuclear and atomic weapons. Also there was a mention of
space vehicles which are supposed to resemble today's so called UFO mother
ship.
Can anyone enlighten me on this?
moreover I am interested in knowing the scope of the discussions in this
forum.
Thanks,
Rajesh
