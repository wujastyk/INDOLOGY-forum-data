Subject: Internet site announcement & a font question
Message-ID: <161227057882.23782.9353568353654893052.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

  The site uses 'dynamic" fonts and displays fine on windows pcs on Netscape and Explorer. 
  But is does not show the diacritics on macs, unless the pages are set to UTF-8 encoding in the browser and not the hmtl.
  Does anybody know how to overcome this problem?

  I'm not sure if I have the exact solution. When I clicked on your site (using IE on a Windows machine), before IE downloaded the page it asked whether I wanted to download and run something called Bitstream font player (or something like that). I clicked yes, and it downloaded in a few seconds and then the pages were displayed. I'm not sure what that "player" does, but if it is something essential then you would need to find a Macintosh counterpart.

  If the problem that Mac browsers are having is simply whether to automatically set themselves to utf-8, then the solution is to use a meta-tag denoting utf-8 before the body of the text.

  try this as one of your meta-tags:
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

  You will need to include that tag on every page that uses diacriticals.

  That should tell Netscape or IE that the page is in utf-8 code.

  Good luck.
