perceptive observation (p. 70) that "From an Indian perspective,
an orthodox metaphysical system may be only a by-product of a
proper hermeneutical approach to scripture....Western Indologists
need to divert some attention from the metaphysical carts in
Indian thought in order to give closer scrutiny to the
hermeneutical horses that may be driving them."

What Mumme says about Indian metaphysics in particular can be
claimed about premodern cosmological thinking in general. On this
issue in relation especially to the double-truth, see S. Farmer,
_Syncretism in the West_ (1998 [1999], pp. 61-63; cf. also the
Subject Index there under "double-truth," p. 576. The long-range
implications of the repeated use of methods like this in
manuscript traditions are discussed on pp. 74 ff. of that book.

Conclusion: The so-called double-truth came in countless
premodern forms. It is an error to assign credit or blame for the
concept to a single tradition.
