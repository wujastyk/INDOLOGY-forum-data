This era lasts between 3000 to 600 BCE or 1900 to 600 BCE . There are very
few hard evidences existing in this period, which possibly was the reason
Joshi  was enquiring about .  Since the Indus Valley civilization was a
magnificent civilization, how could this civilization vanish ? The next
event in the Indian History is the starting of the 16 Janpads in NOrth
India. There are cultural developments in Tamilnadu as we see evidences on
this web site .  The question of who these Santhals were , was not settled
until recently ( Pathak and Verma's book  which provides actual evidence
that they migrated from the Indus Valley - hence to North India ) . Similar
signs were also found in South India .

The Proto Dravidian Indus Valley theory ( number 1 ), and Kak, et al, have
come up with  another one that Indus People moved to the Ganga Yamuna belt
( number two ) , makes one is puzzled .

I believe that there is truth in both of them and it reminds me of Syadvaad
which is theory propounded by the Jains . My understanding of Syaadvaad is
that the actual truth is a composite of all . It is like eight blind men
touching various parts of an elephant , wanted to tell what an elephant
was .

Thanks.
