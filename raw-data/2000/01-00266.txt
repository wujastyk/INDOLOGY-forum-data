section of the Taittiriya Samhita.  From the introduction it also sounds as
if the original chanting book was composed directly from an oral recitation.
    Can someone tell me:

1) Within the tradition of the Black Yajur Veda are there sub-schools with
there own textual variations? Are there textual variations of the Rudram
within this/these schools ?

2) Is there a critical edition or failing that a good edition of the
Taittiriya Samhita or of just the Rudram portion? The Taittiriya Samhita of
Black Yajur Veda (10 Vols.) by A. Mahadeva Sastri and K. Rangacharya appears
to be readily available.  Is this a good edition?
I only need the Rudram portion.

Many thanks,
