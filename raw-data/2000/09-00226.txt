On the contrary, I'm afraid it is the general opinion of indologists that
such a book is a modern creation of the mid-twentieth century.

A quick glance through the standard index to Sanskrit literature in
manuscript, Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum, shows that no work called
"Brhadvimanasastra" nor "Vimanasastra" exists.

I have answered this query more fully in message #8932 of June 1997 which
is in the INDOLOGY archive.  See:
