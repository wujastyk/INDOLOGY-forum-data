There is a nice book called Readings in Vedic Literature by a contemporary
writer in the Vaishnava tradition named Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami which deals
with different themes and practice found in Indian religion. It may be worth
investigating for you. The author has some nice insight because of his
personal practice of the some of the teachings discussed.  The publisher's
description of the book is:

"Readings in Vedic Literature
The Tradition Speaks for Itself

as well as a sample of Vedic writings and a look at the first Indologists.

Literature; Essential Elements of Vedic Thought; Vedic Literature--Siddhanta
and History; The Teachings of the Acaryas; Impersonalism versus Theism; and
