This is a very important point which I too have tried to make on occasion.
Indians are often seriously handicapped when it comes to following up what
happens in Western Indology, simply because many Western publications (both
books and journals) are obscenely expensive. The result is a skewed debate
where Indians can be criticized for not being up-to-date, but where they
don't have the chance to be so in the first place.

I once suggested on this list that Indologists should make English their
"business language" (drop French and German etc. that are not always
mastered by Indians). Another way of getting around this problem, is to
insist upon the publication of journals and books on Indian matters in
India. In other words: drop the prestigious, but extremely expensive
Western publishers if you want to reach Indians in India as well as people
in the West.

But somehow, I don't think this will happen.
