pointing to superficially similar ideas elsewhere (at a later time). From a
Buddhist standpoint, it might not be a question of "two truths" in any
western meaning, but rather two ways of perceiving phenomena - either
accepting them as "real" and suffer, or meditate upon emptiness until they
become "unreal". In Buddhism, the only "truth" that matters is the Path.
Shantideva says that those who wish to "pacify suffering", should
"generate" the wisdom of emptiness through meditation. It is this
insistence upon meditation that makes the idea specifically Indian, I
believe. This is very different from scholastic ways of harmonizing
manuscript traditions. Buddhist thought is much deeper than anything I have
met elsewhere.
