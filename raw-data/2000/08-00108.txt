Subject: More on Kalkin, mlecchas and nAstikas

I would like to add a note to my original post (3 Aug 2000) on this subject.

Although neither the MahAbhArata (3.188.87-93) nor the ViSNu PurANa
(4.24.98-101) descriptions of Kalkin (the Brahmin who will behave like a
kSatriya and will destroy all the foreigners and heretics) mention it, by
the time of the BhAgavata PurANa (12.2.19-20) Kalkin was already described
as brandishing a sword.  It is interesting that Rajaram has decided to call
his web site "The Sword of Truth" and to prominently display a shiny,
bejeweled sword at the top of his page.  This could merely be a coincidence
but, then again, it may not.

And, ironically (in light of the "horse seal" affair), from the BhAgavata
PurANa onwards Kalkin arrives mounted on, what else?... a horse.

Best,
