Lal Mani Joshi, _Discerning the Buddha : a study of Buddhism and of the
Brahmanical Hindu attitude to it_, New Delhi : Munshiram Manoharlal, 1983

This may be a bit too technical but has the advantage of giving a
systematic, lucid and non-stereotypical account of the origin, place and
development of Buddhism within the wider Brahmanical tradition and its
subsequest impact on it.

A textbook-like study but quite dated now is
Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, _Hinduism and Buddhism_, N.Y., Philosophical
Library, 1943
