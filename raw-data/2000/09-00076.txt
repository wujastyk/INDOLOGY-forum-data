Just one reason why Minoan or Harappan language is not PIE, because PIE was
confined to a relatively compact area, far off from either Greece or NW
India.
David Anthony, Shards of Speech, 1995, Antiquity, v. 69 "Terms for wheel,
axle and draft pole, and a verb meaning 'to go or convey in a vehicle'
suggest that PIE existed as a single language after 3500 B.C., when wheeled
vehicles were invented. PIE must have begun to disintegrate before 2000
B.C.: by 1500 B.C.

While the above is consistent with limited IE influence on minoan culture or
harappan culture. the 3500 BC and and 2000 BC are not hard dates.
hard dates are provided by greek 1200  BC, hittite 1800 BC and mitanni,
kassite 1300 BC This gives us a fuzzy snap shot and does not tells us how
contained the spread was before 2000 BC. There is a theory which says minoan
was related to phyrgian or hittite and developed into greek.
