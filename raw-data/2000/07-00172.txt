If seals were employed for trade,
couldn't dolphins, or even whales,
have been employed for large-scale
immigration?

In other words, could the
notorious Aryan invasion
have been seaborne?  Have
any remains of chariots or
spoked wheels been recovered
from under the Indian Ocean?

Perplexed as usual,


Narayan Sriranga Raja.
