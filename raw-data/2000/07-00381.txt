Dear All!

After a gap of one year - which means that we skipped one vol. - the new
KOLAM is on the net as a double volume with  12 articles.
It is now published from Singapore:
http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/journal/kolam/index.htm

Along with the "geographical" change, we have included a few changes in the
concept of this "ezine". It is for instance now meant to be "A Mirror of
Tamil and Dravidian Culture", which means, that in future we will publish
also articles on and translations from the other South Indian
cultures/languages/... Moreover, KOLAM is now an internationally refereed
journal.
