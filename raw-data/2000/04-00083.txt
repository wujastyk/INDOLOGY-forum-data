Could anyone answer the following: For the book _Tamil Studies: Essays on
the History of the Tamil People, Language, Religion and Literature_ by M.
Srinavasa Aiyanger, a copy gives the publication date of the book as 1982.
Does anyone know when the contents were originally written and/or
published?
