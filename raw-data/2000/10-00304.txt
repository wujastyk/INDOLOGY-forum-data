I have now found a virtual smoking gun pointing to a direct connection
between Tamil and Prakrit traditions. The eighth century commentary on the
grammar of Tamil love poetry, kaLaviyal urai (iRaiyan2Ar akapporuL viLakkam),
mentions two texts as having been named after the persons who caused them to
be created. One of them is "iLantiraiyam" and the other is "cAtavAkan2am".
The first one was named after the king "iLantiraiyan" of Kanchi. The second
one was named after one "sAtavAhana". Both works are lost now. (kaLaviyal
urai lists tolkAppiyam as an example of a text named after the author.)
