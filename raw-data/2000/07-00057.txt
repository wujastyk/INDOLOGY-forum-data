As far as I can see, very little:

* the order of writing : in most cases left to wright, established long ago
by BB Lal, and based on overlapping characters in inscriptions on vessels.
(Sometimes, though, right to left, see e.g. some of the tablets mentioned
yesterday:
  III V   or  V III  or even   ^ III !
On the same series of tablets!! Miscopied? or just: doesn't matter as we
can read it both ways, e.g., if it meant something like [give me?here is?]
3  vessels(?) [of...] )

* some simple numbers, written as virtually everywhere in early writing as:
'  ''   '''  ''''  etc.

* Beyond that?  I have difficulty:  what is a "sign"/character? how many?
what do they represent (words)?

Any other proposals for consensus?

The rest flows form here: uncertainty in ANY reading, even sign lists,
concordances etc., and certainly  in ANY "decipherment" (including, of
course, the language(s) it is based on, see below).

Therefore, the only correct translation of the Dholavira wall board is:
lasciate ogni speranza voi qu'entrate!
(= motto of our Round Tables; -- for non-Italian speakers: 'leave all hope
