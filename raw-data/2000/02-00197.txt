Dear. Prof. Vassilkov.
Yes I meant Dr. Sadashiv Ambadas Dange. I was in close contact with him
during his last days. His obituaries were published in Dharmabharati,
JOAS Bombay and other local newspapers. However I wouldn't know about
internet publications on him.

If you need any other information about him, I'll be glad to help you.


Regards.
Vidya
