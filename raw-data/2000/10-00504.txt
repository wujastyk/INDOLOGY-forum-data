Hi Tomo

I cannot answer your question directly but I can contribute a comment and a
reference.

1.
On dRSTi meaning "wrong views" please have a look at the Pali Text Society
dictionary under diTThi to see how this word is used in another heterodox
school. I don't have my Prakrit dictionaries with me but they should be
worth a look too, not to mention the all-important Sanskrit commentary on
the SUyagaDa by ZIlA.Nka (printed in 1880, 1917, 1936-40, 1950-53 and
translated into Hindi 1922-32). Certainly the opening section of the
commentary, written in 861 CE, must explain the title in some way or other.

2.
I suggest you contact Dr. Willem B. Boll?e in Bamberg, he has done major
work on this text and would have (I am sure) a considerable amount to say
about the title of this work. Dr. Boll?e's publication is detailed below
(off-list I will send you his fax number since he does not use email nor
subscribe to INDOLOGY).
