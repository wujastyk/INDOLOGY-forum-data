Subject: [colophon verse]
Message-ID: <161227061380.23782.4227112718178498946.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In two of the manuscripts [Oriya Lit. material] I have, the scribal
plea/end-filler reads

bhagnapRSThakaTigrIvas tulA[I]dRSTir adhomukhaH |   
duHkhena likhitaM granthaM putravat paripAlayet ||

This aptly describes the plight of the scribe who doubled up on the floor
[breaking his back, waist ans neck] pushing the stylus on to the palm leaf,
and carving away the text [his eyes fixed on to the stylus- the tulI or tulA
or his eyes on balance].

The other scribal end-filler that I have seen on Mss, and even on early Oriya
printed books  reads

bhImasyApi raNe bhaGgo munerapi matibhramaH /
y[j]adi zuddham azuddham vA mama doSo na vidyate //

Best wishes.

Dear INDOLOGISTs,

If anyone knows of other attestations of the following verse from a colophon
of an Orissa ms., I would be very grateful to hear about it:

bhagnap.r.s.thaka.tigriivasthiirad.r.s.tir adhomukha.h |   [read: -sthira-]
du.hkhena likhita.m grantha.m putravat paripaalayet ||

There also seems to be a variant (in 2 other mss.), with something like
TULVA/TULII/TULAAd.r.s.tir, but I find the ak.saras hard to read there, and
cannot see what is meant.

With thanks,
