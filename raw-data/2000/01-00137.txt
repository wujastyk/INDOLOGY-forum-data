Here's a couple of references on death issues in Theravada:

Bond, George.  "Theravada Buddhism's Meditations on Death and the Symbolism
of Initiatory Death." History of Religions 19 (1980) 237-258.

Wilson, Liz.  _Charming Cadavers: Horrific Figurations of the Feminine in
Indian Buddhist Hagiographic Literature_, Chicago: U. of Chicago Press,
1996.

Happy Hunting,

Stuart
