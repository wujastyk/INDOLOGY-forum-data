I was not aware that the Nathpanthi and Dasnami Mahants were the official
spokespeople/ registrar for all naked Indian ascetics.

Agreed.

Not quite.  Yours was the comment on Indian poverty. Mine had to do with the
pain & suffering involved in exposing 100% skin to the harsh Indian climate
& insects.

What distorted perspective?  Name one other country/ religion, exotic or
