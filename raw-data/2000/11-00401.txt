Is a script reliable enough to reproduce sound rules and changes in an
extinct language.
Going by its script nobody would ever deduce that bengali does not have any
v/w sound.

In bengali:
hindi and sanskrit v/w remains v in script but becomes b in speech.
where as english u/w sounds are reated differently and some trouble is taken
to reproduce them with some degree of authenticity.

english "we" -> UI in speech and on some occasions even written as such.
"word"-> OArd in speech and sometimes written as such in self lampooning
literature.

cant help but see some superficial similarity between the english-bengali
interaction
and how hurrians are trying to deal with perhaps alien words.

For bengali the real spoken sound rule only comes out of the bag due to
perturbation by an alien language
