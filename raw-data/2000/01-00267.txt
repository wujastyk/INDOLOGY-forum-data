Dear list members,
I am trying to find a book, which I saw in the Hare Krsna Temple in Mumbai.
Unfortunately I don't remember the exact title or the name of the publisher
- maybe someone can help me with the details?
It is an illustrated de luxe version of the Mahabharata with lots of
colorful, beautiful  modern illustrations in the typical indian style
(nothing like the comic versions you sometimes find). The whole book was
quite expensive (around 80 Dollars or so).
Thank you for help. Heike Boudalfa
