Please, could someone kindly post the mailing address
of the Sanskrit Departemnt of Sampurnanand Sanskrit
University?

thank you


The postal address is:

Sampurnanad Sanskrit University, Varanasi-221 002, India

Note that there is no Sanskrit Dept. as such; it is a Sanskrit University.
You might address your letter to the Registrar or to the specific department
like Tulanatmakadharmadarsanavibhaga [Department of Comparative Religion and
Philosophy], Vyakarana etc.
Best.
