Somehow, this doesn't quite jibe whith what I have been reading in the
Organiser (and gathered from the news elsewhere). "Reconversion" is an old
theme in Hindu nationalism, going back to the Arya Samaj at least. As for
Christians: India has some 35-40 million Christians. Between ten and fifteen
procent of India's dalits are Christians, and about three-quarters of India's
Christians are dalits. We are not just talking tribals here. The majority of
the dalits started converting in droves to Christianity about a 100 years ago.
These are the people that the Hindutva crowd wants to see back in the Hindu
fold.
