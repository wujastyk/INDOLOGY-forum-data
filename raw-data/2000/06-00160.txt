A recent overview can be found in:

Possehl, Gregory L. and Gullapalli, Praveena:  "The Early Iron Age in South
Asia", in Vincent Piggott, editor: *The Archaeometallurgy of the Asian Old
World*.  University Museum Monograph 89, MASCA Research Papers in Science and
Archaeology Volume 16.  Philadelphia: The University Museum, University of
Pennsylvania, pp.153-175. 1999.

It has interesting discussion of pyrotechnology and metallurgy.

Best,

George Thompson
