Subject: 1918 Flu Discussion Revisited
Message-ID: <161227056161.23782.1950516144802344951.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Gina Bari Kolata, a science writer for the New York Times, was interviewed on
C-SPAN's Booknotes program last night. She has a new book out with a very
long title, "Flu : The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the
Search for the Virus That Caused It."

She said that recent scholarship keeps raising the estimate of the number of
people killed by the 1918 influenza pandemic. Latest estimates are as high as
100 million deaths, with 20 million of those taking place in the Indian
subcontinent.
