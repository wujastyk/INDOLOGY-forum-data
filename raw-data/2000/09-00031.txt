>???From the above  genealogy list, we can infer  that the monarch was only
Serfoji II . Sivaji II was the son of Serfoji II and not Prathapa Singh
Thulajaji as given by Sri.Vidyasankar.

3.The date of this marathi  inscription was the 10th Feb.1822. According to
this inscription Raja Sri Chathrapathi Serfoji Maharaja built the Temple of
Chandramouleeswara (Chandramouleeswara Griham) in the Math.

4.Vidyasankar wrote.(27.08.2000)?
That there was a Shankaracharya
associated with Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam in the 19th Century does not require
much proof. Around the 1700?s is the crucial time period for which one
needs information.As for as one can make out from your mails, the modi
documents do not cover this?.

The object of this interaction is to share the views on the issue whether
the Kanchi shankara Math has any historical evidence to prove its existence
at Kumbhakonam prior to 1820s as an independent Math. When some one has
been repeatedly saying that the Kanchi math is an institution dating from
1842 AD, the Math had proclaimed independence from Sringeri etc., it is
essential to take into account all the material available during this
period. Therefore, the Kumbakonam inscriptions and Modi Documents (which
cover a period of more than hundred years) shall not be rejected with out
assigning any reasons.

5.The Letter written to SivajiII contains information about the shifting of
Kanchi Math head quarters from Kanchipuram to Kumbakonam during the period
of Raja Prathapa Simhan. There are also records in connction with the Vyasa
pooja Offerings made to the kanchi Kamakoti Peetadhipathi during the
1760s.(Sri VidyaSankar might have the curiosity of  discovering more info.
from the 1700s. But  this can not reduce the importance of the documents
shown in support of my contention that the Kanchi Math had come to
Kumbhakonam during the period of Raja Prathapa simhan only as an
independent Kanchi Math and it is highly ridiculous to claim it as a sub
math of  Sringeri).

6. It was also mentioned in one of my earlier postings that the Tanjore
Kings had extended their patronage to various other maths. Sringeri Math
had not been referred in any of these Documents. Hence the tentative
assumptions that a branch of the Sringeri math was established in
Kumbakonam, the building for which was constructed in 1821 AD, with the
help of the Tanjore king  etc., are not backed by any proof.
