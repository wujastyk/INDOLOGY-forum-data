Hello,

I come very late into the discussion.  I was reading your learned messages
with great interest and admiration.  As I am unable to read neither
Sanskrit nor Tibetan, my only contribution will be for Chinese texts.

I did a search in Taisho vol. 18 to 21 for the word "jingang-cheng" (jap.
Kongoo-joo), which would be the translation of "Vajra-yaana", and for the
word "zhenyan-cheng" (jap. shingon-joo), which would be the translation of
"Mantra-yaana" (I used the CBETA e-texts; my search may be not really
exhaustive...).  Of course, the equivalences between Chinese and Sanskrit
words are very loose.  But the result is quite interesting (I use the
Catalogue of Hobogirin for the translators, their dates, the Sanskrit
titles [which are often conjectural], etc.).

Here are the occurrences of the word "jingang-cheng":

T18n0867_p0254a12 -- an apocryphal suutra of the Tang period (famouse among
T18n0867_p0257c15    other reasons for its chapter on "Raaga-raaja"...)

T18n0869_p0287c12 -- abstract of the "Jingangding-jing" (STTS and related
                      texts) by Amoghavajra

T18n0872_p0299a03 -- a little text related to STTS by Amoghavajra (??)

T18n0882_p0369b15 -- STTS translated by Daanapaala (?), between 982-1017

T18n0884_p0464c29 -- "Guhyagarbhraaja" (??), translated by Daanapaala (?),
T18n0884_p0467b07    between 982-1017
T18n0884_p0467b24

T18n0885_p0476c05 -- Guhyasamaajatantraraaja, translated by Daanapaala (?)
T18n0885_p0476c10

T18n0890_p0578a19 -- "Maayaajaalamahaatantra", translated by Dharmabhadre (?),
                     after 985

T18n0915_p0940c27 -- "Bodhicitta'siilaadaanakalpa" (??), translated (?) by
                     Amoghavajra

T19n0938_p0088a14 -- A short "kalpa" or "vidhi" devoted to 'Saakyamuni of which
                     title contains the expression "vajra-eka-yaana" (?).

T19n0996_p0522b18 -- Commentary by Amoghavajra on the dhaara.nii of the
                     apocryphal suutra "Renwang-jing"

T19n1003_p0617b01 -- Commentary by Amoghavajra on the famouse Adhyardha'satika-
                     praj~naapaaramitaa

And here are the occurrences of the word "zhenyan-cheng":

T18n0848_p0005c08 -- the famouse "Mahaavairocana-suutra", translated by
T18n0848_p0005c09    'Subhakarasi.mha and Yixing (and translated by Stephen
T18n0848_p0051a29    Hodge...)
T18n0848_p0054c19

T18n0860_p0188a04 -- a kalpa or vidhi on the precedent suutra.

--------

So, the word "zhenyan-cheng" appears only in the "Mahaavairocana-suutra"
and a related text; as Yixing's death is the year 727, it must be earlier
than that date.

The first datable occurrence of the word "jingang-cheng" is by Amoghavajra
who died in 770 or 774.  Many texts are from STTS (even in its earliest
version...) or related to it.

I hope these data are interesting for you...
