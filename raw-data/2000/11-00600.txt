"Before the funeral, the dead man would be placed on a "bed without
legs" and covered with a white cloth (PuR. 286), a practice showing
that, then as now, white was the colour of mourning. A soldier would
be carried on his shield (PuR. 310), as in ancient Greece. At the
house of the dead man, drums would beat out a rhythm called 'neytal',
which is also the name of the division of akam poems in which the
