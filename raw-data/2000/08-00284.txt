<< Is there an English translation of Hermann Oldenberg's "Die
Weltanschauung der Brahmanatexte" (Gottingen 1919)?>>


I see none on the gigantic online union catalog OCLC (mostly North
American libraries but expanding into Europe and Japan).

Have you checked his Kleine Schriften (Wiesbaden: F. Steiner, 1967)?
