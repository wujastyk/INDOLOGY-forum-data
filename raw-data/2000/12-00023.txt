To make a prior assumption that complex acculturation took place
and then trying to reconcile genetic evidence is hardly scientific.

The process of acculturation could have been any direction - from
west to east or east to west.

If genetic evidence is to be of any value - it has to show
independent evidence of migration of IE speaking people into
India.  Otherwise it will be merely data fitting.
