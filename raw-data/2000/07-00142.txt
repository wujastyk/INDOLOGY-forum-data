Granted that all below is very preliminary since we only have K.Elst's
brief report and the book announcement by N. Jha and Rajaram, a few points
stick out,  like the proverbial sore thumbs.

Following the major points of Elst's summary:

>The Jha/Rajaram  ... in a chronological framework putting the
>Rg-Veda before 3000 BC  ...  correspond contentswise with
>the late-Vedic/Sutra period, ... read with a close eye on the cultural or
>"literary"
> background...

Let's simply forget this as it has little bearing on the reading of a
script which was used from 3300/2600 BCE- c. 1900 BCE by people(s) speaking
(an) unknown language(s).
All of the above  is interpretation of data that would first have to be
shown to have been deciphered correctly.

>Jha and Rajaram claim that ... seals were not commercial documents
>but were religious in nature, hence ... contentswise they have a lot in
>common with the largely > religious Vedic corpus.

Again, a presuppostion that is not allowed. Some complex seal impressions
(36 times) were made out of a combination of several seals; some such
impressions have cloth marks on the back side. Obviously, to mark [goods]
enveloped in cloth. Second, (large) vessels stamped or written on: is that
religious? Looks more like administration in any comparative 3 millennium
framework.

All of this aside, let's look at the script itself:

>Leaving aside the remaining logographic signs,

-- that would certainly mean some 3/4 of the signs which appear only 1x...

>the phonetic mainstream of
>the script would be most comparable with the Semitic scripts.

The theoretical question is where to draw the line for a (Semitic)
alphabet.  Signs used more than 10 x through the Indus  Civ. at all times
come to c. 100, those used more than 20 x come to c. 80 signs. Nice, for
an Indian style alphabet?
Nope.
Even the ten-fifteen most common signs  include some that have clear
