I read the article written by Sri Vidyasankar ?Real History Of Kanchi Math
(Re:Former President Inaugurates
)Celebrations? in the alt.hindu Newsgroup.
This article was written on the major issues covered in  ?The weekly cover
story? of the Illustrated weekly Of India (Sept.13,1987) ?K.P.Sunil.

Page 3 and 4 of the article (Real History Of
.) give  the following
information
.

? Historians, however, hold that the Kumbhakonam math was in verity a
branch of the Sringeri math established in 1821 AD by the famous monarch of
Tanjore, Serfoji. (Mr.Sunil has a fact wrong here.The monarch of Tanjore in
1821 was not Serfoji but his son Prathap singh Thuljaji.The date 1821 is
correct.-it is the date of the oldest inscription found in the Kumbhakonam
Math building.) Later the war broke out between the kings of  Tanjore and
Mysore, the Kumbhakonam Math proclaimed independence from Sringeri and
established  itself as the Kamakoti Peetam.?(there is no war documented
between the Maratha rulers of Tanjore and the Wodeyars of Mysore after the
1821.By this time, both were more or less puppets of the British. That the
Kumbakonam math proclaimed independence from Sringeri however is a fact
)

Mr.Sunil captures the major facts regarding the Kanchi Math correctly
though. Briefly,

1.A branch of the Sringeri math was established in Kumbakonam, the building
for which was constructed in 1821 AD, with the help of the Tanjore king

2.The Kumbakonam math soon proclaimed independence from Sringeri

3(2)Thus the kanchi math as an institution dates from 1842 AD

The findings of the author in the said article made me to look out for more
fine points on the subject. Therefore a discussion was initiated in the
indology group.

Sri Vidyasankar wrote..(23.08.2000) ?
As an inscription dated 1821 is found
in Kumbakonam, it stands to reason that there must have been a matha there
for a few decades before that date. I don?t think that people and
institutions suddenly come into being , on the date of the first available
written record
The question that causes the biggest controversy is whether
the said matha came to Kumbakonam in the first place and if so, when. That
is still to be addressed?.

1.The  inscriptions relating to 1800 AD clearly mention the name of the
Math as the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and the modi documents of 18th and 19th
century also do refer the institution as the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and the
Peetadhipathi as the Shankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam.  Therefore
the existence of Kanchi Shankara Math at Kumbakonam  during this period is
proved beyond doubt.

2.The Kumbakonam Shankara Mutt inscription, according to Sri Vidyasankar
relates to 1821 AD.According to him the then ruler of Tanjore during this
period was not Serfoji  but his son prathap singh Thuljaji.
