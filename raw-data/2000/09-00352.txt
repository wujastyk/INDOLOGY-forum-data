I see the discussion about the ancient history of India prior to 6th
century BC(the period of Jain Thirthankara Mahaveera) goes round and round
about PIE, horse, Mohenjodaro,undeciphered Indus script and excavated
Buddhist Stoopas and Viharas and Tamil language.Are there any
archaeological excavations and/or discoveries that could fill up the gap
between 600 BC and 3000 BC? For example who were in the south India when
the Jewish king Soloman (900BC to 1000BC)had trade contract with Indian
king or kings?Just saying that there were Aryan people or Dravidian people
or mixture of both does not tell us anything.Portraying the picture of the
ancient Indian civilization in one way or in another way makes no sense
without the sufficient archaeological excavations.We need research papers
and information without premature position papers from either side.
