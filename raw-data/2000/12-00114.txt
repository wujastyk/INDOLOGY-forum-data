It may be that the following work is meant:

	Sharma, Aryendra: Beitr?ge zur vedischen Lexikographie :
	neue W?rter in M. Bloomfields Vedic concordance / von
	Aryendra Sharma. -- M?nchen : Kitzinger in Komm., 1959/60.
	-- XXI, 366 p. -- (PHMA : Mitteilungen zur idg.,
	vornehmlich indo-iranischen Wortkunde sowie zur
	holothetischen Sprachtheorie ; Heft 5/6)
	Orig. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. of Munich, 1939

Perhaps some libraries list it under the name of the series (note
that "PHMA" is an uppercase Greek word = Rhema).
