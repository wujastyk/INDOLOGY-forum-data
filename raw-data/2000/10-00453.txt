The advantages that Internet offers in term of speedy and free transmission,and ease of accessing information are more than offset by lack of explicit or self  refereeing,and  by the desire to score points.Technology has drastically reduced the communication time. But the human response time remains very very long in comparison.That is why there is need for taking time to collect thoughts and conveying them. It is not without reason that language has such therapeutic expressions as "stunned into silence","taken aback","lost for words".If personal details are given or asked for,or if a situation arises where a person thinks that he must give personal explanation, it must be seen as collapse of interaction,the more so when the interaction is intellectual.

There seems to be an urgent need for a "think-pause",an internet version of mauna-vrata.

Some suggestions:

*Take at least a day off from the List
*Avoid using I or you.
*Do not make personal attacks.If somebody does , do not respond:simply point out.
*The purpose of any interaction ,more particularly of this List, is not to judge, harangue,convert or convince.But to point out.
