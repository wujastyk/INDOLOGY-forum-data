A complete (approx TEN YEAR) search through the
Archives of INDOLOGY yields the following number of
matches for

JAOS ? 97
JRAS ? 55
BSOAS ? 20
IIJ - 46

Fundamental? If so, does INDOLOGIST provide them
online?
What is the relevance of such offline artifacts to a
fundamentally online community (and world)?
Recognized: as documents mimicked in pursuit of
degrees?
