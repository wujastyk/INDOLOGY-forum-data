on 12th March Harry Spier asked about emendations proposed by V. K. Rajvade
to the Rigveda. In am not a Vedicist enough to answer this, but he also
added a second question:
"Would this be the same V, K, Rajvade who discovered the Jnaneshwari
manuscript?"
While I do not know the answer, I can at least surmise it:
The Vedic scholar was probably Vaijanath Kashinath Rajvade, who also wrote
the study Words in the Rigveda, Poona 1932. The Marathi scholar seems to be
Visvanatha Kashinath Rajvade (1860-1944). Igf somebody knows more (or more
correctly), for instance the dates of birth and death of the first, I would
appreciate.

Klaus
