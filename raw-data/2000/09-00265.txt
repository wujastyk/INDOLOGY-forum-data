'>' I see Ramayana in that posting, is this "walking buddha" myth
'>' from R.? Which chapter?

        Oftentimes, the tirukkuRaL is misinterpreted. The expression
        'malamicai Ekinaan' refers to 'reaching an exalted state'
        and it does not mean 'walking on top of flower(/lotus)'.
        Almost all gods are depicted either sitting or standing on
        flowers. In Tamil 'malar' or simply 'poo' means the
        'final stage' (beyond that one crosses and reaches to God's feet).
        It is a standard spiritual expression in Tamil.
