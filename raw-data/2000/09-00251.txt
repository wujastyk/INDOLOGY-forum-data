For others interested in the dialacts spoken in and around Magadh are :

Magadhi - South of the Ganges river but east of Sone river in Bihar

Vaishali, Kashi , Gorakhpur ( Kushinagar ) - Close to Bhojpuri -

Buddha was born in Lumbini, close to Gorakhpur . His palace was farther
from Gorakhpur .

Thanks.
