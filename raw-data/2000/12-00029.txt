S. Futehally's "translation" is really interpretation. It is not clear if
she understood many of the words.

Mirabai's original language is not easily understood. It is in a
Rajasthani dialect. Popular version of her padas are closer to
standard Hindi, but not the original version. I would not trust a
translation by anyone not well versed in old Hindi dialects.

Unfortunately the generation that understood old Hindi dialects
is gradually dying out. Soon Indians will know Mirabai only through English
translations, the only Indian language english-medium-educated Indians
today are comfortable with. Futehally's and Pritish Nandi's "translations"
will prevail.
