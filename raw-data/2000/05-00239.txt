I seem to recall (read Luria ages ago) that Sherishevskii also felt
subjectively very oppressed by his memories, especially as he got
older.  Luria taught him some method of "throwing a blanket over his
memories", and that helped him to a large degree to live with his
(dis)ability.

I think your suggestion of testing some Veda reciters is fascinating.  I
hope someone does it.
