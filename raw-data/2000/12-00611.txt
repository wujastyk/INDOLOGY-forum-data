As usual this is typical spinning.

It was the european colonialists who introduced the concept
of race in the first place and then went onto conjure up
an Aryan invasion - Now the natives are being accused of
having thought their fellow cuntrymen are "racially and religiously
inferior" !!!

As usual europeanists try to hasten to cover up abuse of India
by western colonialist and religious ideologies.

For Indians to make an effort to know their own history is
to be labelled chauvinistic !
