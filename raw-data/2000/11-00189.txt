Friends;

In my quest for and study of sadhana, i have decided to undertake a study of Sri Vidya. i have a few very short questions about Sri Vidya sadhana ... If you are kind enough to respond please limit your dis

1) is there a particular way for one to approach a guru and request sadhana.

2) is there a ritual of initiation that is related to sri vidya and not held to the specific guru?

thanks 

Stephen J Brown
