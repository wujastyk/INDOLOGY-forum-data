I do not understand why 35 mm would be any different than digitizing other
things. A 35 mm slide scanner is a standard piece of equipment and the
software can easily give contrast inverted image to make it appear as black
on white text. Then it is an image just like one from paper, although
probably poorer quality.

You can obviously put that in jpg format for image file, but maybe you are
asking about converting to text or even native text. If native text is the
problem, I may suggest a product we call "manual OCR" which is a special
(Indian font) word processor that makes itself into only one line and floats
just below the text that was scanned. Thus, you can very easily and
efficiently type and edit at speeds much faster and more accurate (for a
good typist) than any Indian font ocr available today.

Please see information on the Indology web site. Go to "Virtual Archive of
Indic etexts" page, then got to "Sanskrit Texts by Vedic Engineering," then
to "full details of texts, fonts, and software   available."

Perhaps we can help you. Please let me know details of your situation: how
many pages of text (what texts they are), what language(s) and exactly what
you want done to them.

sincerely,
