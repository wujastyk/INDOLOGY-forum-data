You should consult the following work.

"A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry" by V. S. Rajam, 1992,
American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia.
ISBN 0-87169-199-X

The texts themselves are available in a searchable form at the Cologne
University website  <A
HREF="http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/ttt_search.html">Digita
l Tamil Literature</A>.

Some of the Old Tamil texts may be ordered from the Tirunelveli Saiva
Siddhanta Book Publishing Society in Chennai. Some may be ordered from the U.
V. Saminatha Iyer Library in Chennai.
