This is a very sweeping statement.  I have read most of the Yogacaara
texts and do not find much evidence of ontology there.   Perhaps you
are basing your opinions on the La`nkaavataara-suutra which is
popularly thought to be a Yogacaara text.  It is not -- it is a
syncretic text that borrows Yogaacara ideas.  It is *never* quoted as
a proof-text by any of the classical Yogaacara authors.

I suspect that part of the problem for you is that Yogaacara had a
long history in India and evolved over the centuries  -- one could
divide it up into early (classical) Yogaacara, represented by
Maitreya, Asa`nga and Vasubandhu, a middle period and a late syncretic
period.  Many claims about Yogaacara seem to me to derive from late
materials -- especially the LAS.   It is regreatable that many key
tests by the early Yogaacarins have not been translated into English
(some in French and German though) and only some are even available in
Sanskrit.   The kind of influences you are speaking of would probably
derive from the late syncretic form of Yogaacara which may lend itself
to an idealistic interpretation but even this is debatable.
