Dearest Professor Nayak,
You are - I think - right on the target. It is impossible to study, for
example, a Sanskrit text without pondering about the person (with his caste,
biography, religion and so on) who has written it. And it is impossible to
study an author only by his caste, biography, religion and so on without
pondering about his texts. For being a true *indologist* it is necessary an
holistic point of view.
I am interested in Sanskrit classical poetry, but when I translate Amaruka,
or Kalidasa or Mayura or Jagannatha I think always:
why this author *makes* poetry in this way? What is his view about the
religion, the aesthetic theories, the Liberation from samsara?
Bhadram astu.
Yours faithfully,
Daniela
