>?From UCologne OTL, pl. take a look at:
maNNu-tal maNNu-tal 1. to bathe; to perform ablutions;
2. to immerse oneself completely, as in water;
1. to wash, clean by washing; 2. to smear, anoint;
3. to do, make, perform; 4. cf. man2d2 to adorn, beautify, decorate;
5. cf. man2d to polish, perfect, finish, as a gem

The meanings in the verb "maNNu-tal" such as
"to adorn/decorate/beautify" and "to perfect/finish as a gem"
is what is "maNi" = gem/jewel in Tamil and Sanskrit.
I have argued that the Vedic karkoTaka means
"gemstone giver".

Compare maNi, maNNutal with another pair: paNi, paNNutal

The verb, paNNutal has given us important words
for music raaga, hand, trade etc.,

otl paNNu-tal paNNu-tal 1. to make, effect, produce, accomplish;
2. to fit out, make suitable; 3. to adorn; 4. to sing in an instrument,
as a tune; 5. to tune musical instruments; 6. to cook

paN - service, work, business, employment;

This is the root verb in barter trade in ancient times.
paNi, vaNi, vaNij (related to vaNiya), paNa ('money'),
pra-paNa are likely related with "paNNu-tal".
