 From the Isha Upanishad (Nilgiri edition, trans. by Eknath Easwaran):

"In dark night live those for whom
The world without alone is real; in night
Darker still, for whom the world within
Alone is real. The first leads to a life
Of action, the second to a life of meditation."

Please reply privately to avoid crowding the list with a probably
very evident (to the assembled) answer,
