I think we have to distinguish the general case from the specific. We 
have a particular distinction of two truths, often using the same or 
similar terminology, which is widely used in several quasi-absolutist 
traditions by the latter part of the first century A.D. i.e. 
Mahaayaana, Gau.dapaada and among Jains by Kundakunda. These are 
clearly related by their terminology and methodology. Only in the 
Buddhist case do we have a clear earlier history. In fact the 
distinction between the two truths derives from abhidharma. Indeed 
the Sanskritization as sa.mv.rti has long been known to be erroneous. 
It is clear that a distinction of two truths is integral to the 
abhidhamma from a very early date and has strong roots in suttanta 
material.

I do not think your examples are early enough to be of any use. We 
cannot rule out Indic influence on the Arab world. You would need 
examples from Classical antiquity.

This is precisely a form of Mahaayaana Buddhism and so hardly 
supports the independent development of the idea.

This is what you have to prove.

I am reasonably confident that the idea is not an independent 
development in the various Indian traditions. Beyond that it seems to 
me that it is premature to assume that because the idea is very 
widespread at a later date, it could not have had a single origin 
from which it spread. (But it needs more careful examination to see 
if the idea is really the same in detail.)
