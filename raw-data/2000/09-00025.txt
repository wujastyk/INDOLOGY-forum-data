Subject: IS IT THE TIME TO COME UP WITH A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR INDIA ?
Message-ID: <161227061319.23782.1344342157361657562.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

What concrete changes do you propose, which would better suit the Indian
context? Is the problem really the Indian Constitution? Are people really
complying with it in the first place?
    I cannot imagine that the Indian Constitution really allows all you
suggest in your final paragraph.
