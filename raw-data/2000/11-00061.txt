Arabs and generally Middle-eastern people have parellel cousin marriages.
On the other hand cross cousin marriages are practiced across the globe.
For example Yanamano in the Amazon and Akan of west africa have cross
cousin marriage

Are you going to include  Yanamano and Akan among Dravidians? Do you have
definite information on the marriage practices of speakers of Brahui,
Malto, Kudukh, Gondi, Konda, Kui, Manda,Parji, Gadaba, Kolami, Pengo,
Naiki, Kuvi, Telugu, Tulu, Kannada, Kodagu, Toda, Kota?
