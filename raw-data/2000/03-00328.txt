Let us assume, for sake of argument, that RV is a book on  Advanced Calculus.
Who stands better chance of decoding RV, an IE linguist or a mathematician who
knows some thing of Vedic?

You may have spent your life stduying the "language" of RV, but it does not mean
that you are better prepared to tell others what is in RV.
As far as your claim of telling if Mr. XYZ is scientist of Rv is concerned, is
it not presumming too much on your part?

I find the attitude of Indologists extremely narrow minded. Scientists do not
talk like that. You may point out mistakes of others, but to say that only  IE
linguists have claim to understand RV, and not others is too much . Are  we
building up a new caste of "super Brahmins"?
