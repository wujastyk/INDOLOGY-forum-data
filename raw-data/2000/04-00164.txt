According to Madras Census Report,1892, by M.A.Stuart: "The Dombs are a
Dravidian caste of weavers and menials, found in the hill tract of
Vizagapatnam and in Koraput..."
In the current Indian context Dombs are classified as Scheduled caste. They
live as  neighbours of Kondh. They play a subordinate role to Kondhs and
acts as a messenger for Khondhs.I have visited such Domb settlements in
Koraput and Rayagada districts of Orissa.
There are villages named after Dombs. A search for 'Domb' prefixed village
names yields following results:
Tamilnadu(1)- Dombucheri
Orissa(5) Dombaguda,Dombobisoiput, Dombo Turunji, Dombuai guda(koraput and
Donma diha.
West Bengal(2) Domberya, Dombandi
Assam (1) Dombaha
Bihar(7)- Dombaha, Domba Pahari, Dombi Duar etc.,
Karnataka (11- Domba Kuppa, Dombara Halli, Dombar Hop, Dombara mattur etc.,
It is pertinent to note that normally suffixes like 'Cheri' (as in the case
of Dombucheri) and Kuppa (as in Domba kuppa) are associated with the
settlements of so called 'low-caste' people (though always not the case).
