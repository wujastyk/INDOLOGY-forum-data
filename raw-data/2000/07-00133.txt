There is an interesting article at this URL:

http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/070400sci-archaeo-greece.html

Here is one paragraph from it:

Yet much like today's fossil
            hunters, Ms. Mayor found,
            ancient Greeks and Romans
            collected and measured the
            petrified bones they encountered
            and displayed them in temples
            and museums. They, too,
            recognized fossils as evidence of
            past life, now extinct,
            anticipating Cuvier by more than
            2,000 years.
