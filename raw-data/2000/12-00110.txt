The position in Jainism may not be that straightforward, there is a
possibility (suggested by one or two citations in old texts) that meat was
an acceptable food in early stages of Jainism. A useful place to start
looking into this would be

Paul DUNDAS. 1998. The meat at the wedding feasts : Krsna, vegetarianism
and a Jain dispute. Toronto : University of Toronto, Centre for South Asian
Studies, 1998. 28 p. ; 23 cm. (The 1997 Roop Lal Jain Lecture).
