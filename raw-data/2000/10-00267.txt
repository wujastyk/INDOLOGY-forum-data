        Objet:  Akbar's death

        Dear Gentlemen,


        I'm Italian (Sorry for my bad English) Student of
        modern History and I'm writing a degree thesis
        concerning movement of evangelization in Mughal India
        (XVI-XIX century). At the moment I study Akbar's
        death: somebody assert that he kill himself by poison,
        others killed by his son Salim.It's very difficult,
        almost impossible, to find in Italy documents and
        books about arguments interesting to me.
        Can You tell me, if it's possible, the real anedoct
        about Akbar's death?

          I'll happy to thank You


        Yours  faithfully
        Youri Martini

        p.s. Do You know recent publications about Catholic
        Missions to Mughal India (probably printed in India)
