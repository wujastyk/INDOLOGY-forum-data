Dear Indologists,

Let me announce that the pancanga program based on the
Suryasiddhanta is now excutable at my homepage:

http://www.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga

This is a perl version of the same program that was put at
my ftp site several years ago. The results of the two programs
are not exactly identical, but as far as the dating is concerned,
the difference is not very significant.

Please remember that this program was written for the purpose
of dating historical documents.
