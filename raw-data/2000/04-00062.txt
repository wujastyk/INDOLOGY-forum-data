There is direct word in Tamil 'pOtu' meaning 'young of an animal or a tree'. This word is in the same family of
words having a meaning 'new or young'.

The word 'putal/putar' is of course bush, a bunch of plants. In the South Arcot District in Tamil Nadu, there is a place
called pAatirip puliyUr. (this is part of the modern town of KadalUr). puliyUr is a modern currupt rendering of putiyUr
(meaning new village/town). This was also called once pATali putra in Sanskrit, paTali being the Sanskrit rendering
of  pAtiri, a flower tree. In a place where there was bush and plants (putal), the new town/village (putiyUr) could have
come up.

 The word 'putal' can also have a different ending and become  '*putan2ai' like in 'peruNai' (meaning river). There is
also a word 'puthin2A' meaning 'a kind of spinach'.

Incidentally, the English word 'botany' appears to be related in a curious way.

As per 'Bloomsbury Dictionary of Word Origins' by John Ayto,   'Botany' was derived from 'botanic', a borrowing,
either directly or via French 'botanique', of Latin 'botanicus'. The ultimate source of the word was Greek 'botani'
'(plant,pasture), a derivative of the verb boskein 'feed'.

Only in the last line, I differ. the word 'botani' appears to be cognate of '*putanai', The science of botany is the study of
plants. You get the straight meaning in Tamil also. The basic root 'putu' has a meaning of 'new' and 'young'. Attribution
of the origin to the greek word 'boskein' appears to be conceptually long winded.
