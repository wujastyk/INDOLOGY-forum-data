OK, that does it - enough of this disparaging of scientists or
for that matter anybody else who is not a linguist!

What really happened (or for that matter what is going to happen)
is pretty simple :-)  We wrote Vedas in our future, taped it, and
using a "Time machine (TM)" (already invented in future), went
back and replayed it to invading/migrating/loitering/indigenous
Aryans.

They are then forced to commit all these things to memory for
the next thousand years or so (pretty ease to police with a
time machine!)  When a mistake was made once every hundred
years or so, the punishment was swift, inhumane and ghastly -
they were forced to take classes in historical linguistics ;-(

Hope this puts things in the proper perspective :-)

Ducking and running for cover -
