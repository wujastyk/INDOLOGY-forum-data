Like you, I haven't read prof. Kripal or the respected Swami.

R. Srinivasan's words <<Linga does not mean phallic except in the Tantra
 context. Linga, according to Saiva siddhanta, means symbol, a mark, a sign,
 an emblem. >>

In Bengal and East India, Tantra is a way of life for centuries,
and western books on Tantra usually have pictures from 19th cent.
Bengal art depicting linga as the male member.

Best wishes,
SM
