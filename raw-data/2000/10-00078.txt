    First I wish to say that Buddhism was already in decline (according
  to the books I had cited) at the time of Turk/Muslim invasions.
  The quotes were merely to point out that interaction of Muslims
  and Buddhists in India was not as pleasant as you asserted.

    I should note that you ignored that one of the authors was a
  Buddhist (Bhikshu Sangharakshita) and one other was a christian/agnostic
  (A. L. Basham). You instead went after the caste of Romila Thapar.
  Should we ignore all that you have to say about Hinduism just
  because you have a Muslim sounding name ? I think not. We all
  have political and ideological biases. Should there be no
  discussion then ?


    The quotes talked about the facts (destruction of Buddhists
  monasteries and libraries) that could be shown to be wrong.
  A. L. Basham and R. Thapar have some reputation as Historians
  of ancient India. Given that the site you quote is not only
  ideologically anti-Hindu but is also highly political and anti-India,
  without strong evidence, one may not want to take seriously what
  it says about Hinduism/India. In the end evidence is more
  important wherever it comes from. The opinions of an ideologically
  baised individual on a subject without any evidence of reaserch
  does not have much value.

    One final note. Above authors do not say about the wholesale
  migration of people (your wrong inference about east-asian being
  bengalies), rather the migration of monks. Without the ideological
  bias, this inference from the quotes could not have been drawn.
