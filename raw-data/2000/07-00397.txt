Subject: Subject-prefix for INDOLOGY (fwd)


>A member has made the following suggestion that all INDOLOGY messages
>should have "[INDOLOGY]" prefixed to the subject line.
>
>Personally, I have a mail filter set up that automatically sends incoming
>indology messages to a separate folder, based on the string "indology" in
>the "to: " field.  So I have no need for such a prefix.  In fact I would
>prefer not to have it, since it "steals" ten characters from the length of
>the subject line.
>
>Let's vote on this issue.
>
>If you want a prefix, send a message to INDOLOGY with the subject line
>"prefix - yes".
>
>If you don't want a prefix, send a message to INDOLOGY with the subject
>line "prefix - no".
