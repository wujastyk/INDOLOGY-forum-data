Inquisitive minds would like to know why there were no
followups from "Professional"/"Mainstream"
*Indologists* to those IMHO brilliant posts from
Lakshmi Srinivas (Re: Neo-Orientalism, 4th October)
and Rajesh Kochchar (Re: making of a cultural man,
21st October).

If questioning the *professional* Indologists makes me
another "amateur"/"Hindutwa-vadin", then Amen!

Regards,
Sreenivas

P.S. Eigentlich h?tte ich so gern geh?rt, was die
Herren SF, MW, RZ, YV, GT zu obigen 2 Nachrichten zu
sagen haben.
