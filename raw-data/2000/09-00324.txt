It is perhaps asking for too much on this list - but would it be possible to
keep the bashing of a particular man from transforming itself into the
bashing of the general group to which he claims to belong? No mathematician
worth his salt puts much store by dubious premises, if said premises are
indeed dubious. There is nothing "typical" about this affair.
