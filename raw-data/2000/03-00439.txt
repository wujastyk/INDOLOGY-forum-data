Who cares? Quite frankly, I don't. If anyone is interested in proving such a
vague and useless matter, let them do so, but I have other things to do.
And I repeat that this whole issue is beside any point I was making.

I never denied that. It is also immaterial to the discussion.

"India" can have many meanings, depending on the context (e.g., the time
about which we are speaking). If you insist on interpreting my use of "India"
as "the modern nation-state known since 1947 as India, also as Bhaarata",
then this is a one-sided interpretation and an irrelevant deviation from the
discussion.
