THE WESTERN SCHOLAR

(You have fixed your sights ?
And a well-placed missile it was!)

"Compose yourself sir and reevaluate your position.
You are not well. ? We're sorry. You will have to be
asked to step down.?

As they hasten him along the dinosaur path through the
corridors of corporate philanthropy,

now preserved along side the bones of the past.
Colossal in structure: hollow in volume.

Even the kids can see right through this.
