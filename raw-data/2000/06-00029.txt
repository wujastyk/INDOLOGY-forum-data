Subject: Technical Terminology of Shastraic Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227058934.23782.16665944519200290990.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List members,
                   In the Shastras and darshanas of Sanskrit, one comes
across various technical terms. each Shastra has its own technical
terminology which it defines. It is often noticed that the same technical
term has been employed in the different knowledge domains with different
connotations. For example, the term upasarga stands for 'semantic modifier'
in Vyakarana; in Ayurveda, it stands for 'the ailment that gets imposed on a
basic disease, a secondary ailment' ; in Yoga-Sutras it stands for
'impediment' or 'obstruction'.

My question is, what are the dictionaries or reference works that one can
refer to in this regard. I will be grateful for any information in this
matter.

Thanking You in advance.
