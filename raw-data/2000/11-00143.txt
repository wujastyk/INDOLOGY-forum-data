(Non-indological) : Desis I have talked to are generally upset about the
discriminatory fee structure (they have encountered such situations as
tourists in Australia and China).  Supposedly some law limits what the
Archaelogical Survey of India can charge, and the ASI is interpreting it to
apply to Indians. The Tourism Department (under the same ministry) is upset
about the entrance fee hikes.

There is an urgent need for funds, but some more creative and less
discriminatory way of doing it has to be thought of.
