Subject: .dombii as scavenger woman

Re. Stephen Hodge?s informative remarks on the
d.ombii. Could he or anyone else kindly amplify on the
meaning and relationship of the following as regards
our present discussion on the .dombii as scavenger
woman.

1)The Kondh. (They live as neighbors of Kondh. They
play a subordinate role to Kondhs and act as
messengers for Khondhs.)
2) The Meria human sacrifices. (Historically the
.dombii are known to have procured victims for the
Meria human sacrifices until these were suppressed in
the mid 19th Century.)
3) Shavara. (The women identified as .d?kin?s are
especially linked with the .Dombi and Shavara, i.e.,
Munda peoples living mainly in parts of Orissa, Bihar
and Bengal.)

Much thanks,

Ven. Tantra
