According to Lois Sherr Dubin, "The History of Beads from 3,000 B.C.
to the Present", Abrams, 1987, p. 182, etched carnelian beads  were
created through a treatment that painted the surface with natron
(calcium carbonate) and then baked. The technique was invented in the
Indus Valley ca. 2500 BCE and both the beads themselves and the
technology were exported to Mesopotamia. Carnelian beads from the
Royal Graves at Ur have similar patterns etched in their surfaces as
some of those excavated from Indus Valley sites.
