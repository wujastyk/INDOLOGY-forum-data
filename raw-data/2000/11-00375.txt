Hi Bergit, it was i who started this discussion about Indian materialism.
Thanks for your response.

--> This is the first time i am hearing of this "four positions" that you
speak of. I obviously have to read up some more on this.

--> I may mention to you, however, that Jayarasi (whose book we now possess)
was most certainly not a Charvaka, as was convincingly demostrated by Walter
Ruben and others. He was a sceptic, and he rejected all pramanas. D.P.
Chattopadhyaya's "Lokayata/Charvaka" has two scholarly articles (one by
Ruben) which seek to disprove (quite convincingly i thought) the notion that
Jayarasi's book is a Charvaka text.

--> I have never heard of Udbhata before, but from what i know of the
Charvakas, it is almost certain that he was not a Charvaka as well.
Believing in an infinite number of pramanas goes contrary to all we know
about the Charvakas.

--> I may mention that there is a tendency among some scholars to identify a
certain Ajit Kesakamblin (who was probably a contempory of the Budha) with
the Charvakas. This, too, has been disputed by others who claim that Ajit
did not subscribe to the philosophy of "svabhav vad"--a critical component
of Charvaka thought.
