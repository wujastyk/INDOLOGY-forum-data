Dear listmembers,

I have not read Bruce Lincoln's book and do not know why he places
Parmenides in an old Indo-European tradition of which India is also a part.
Parmenides' background was  the Ionian Asia Minor, where Greek philosophy
was born, in contact with oriental influences. Indian influence on Greek
philosophy remains conjectural, but transmigration of souls might have been
one such influence, see W. Burkert, ANCIENT MYSTERY CULTS, HUP, 1987, p.
87: "Transmigration of souls is a doctrine that suddenly appeared in the
Greek world toward the end of the sixth century B.C. We find the name of
either Pythagoras or Orpheus attached to it, and we have the word of Plato
that it was told in mysteries, teletai, and found 'strong believers'
there... In addition there are the cryptic statements, to be found mainly
in Plato, about the soul enclosed in the 'prison' of the body, being
punished for unspeakable ancient crimes, waiting for release ordained by
the god... It is all the more remarkable that beyond this evidence, which
is concentrated in the fifth and fourth centuries, there is nothing to
suggest that belief in transmigration was a basic or essential tenet of
mysteries as practiced. There remains the impression of a 'drop of foreign
blood'..."

Best wishes,
Bjarte Kaldhol,
