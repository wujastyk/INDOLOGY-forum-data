The ultimate
consequences of a civil moral based on the principle of revenge (which is
really at the bottom of you argument) can be seen vividly in the former
Yugoslavia. You may turn a place into a desert and call it peace. But you
can
also turn a place into a heap of dung and call it justice.

RB>I am not talking about morals, who wronged who, or preaching anything.
When a naturalist goes into the field he does not take sides between say
prey and predator,  Such an approach would compromise truth and limit
understanding.
Its undestandable to sanitize news stories if they can be iflammatory but
such principles should not be used for long term analysis of history.
Marxist scholars indeed become defensive when its time to deal with islamic
activities in India.

If you are worried that the sight of broken pre-islamic monuments will make
hindus vengful you are off track. Compare INdian attitudes with the paranoid
israelis, Americans who bombed libya over a hijacking. INdia probably has
faced more terrorist attacks than all of them combined. Starting with 747
blown oput of the sky, stock exchange bombings ....... assasinations , bomb
blasts, mowing down of many marriage processions in jammu, migrant labourers
shot dead as they sleep to give just a few examples all happening over and
over again. These are never reported in the western media.

Even the so called rabid and nationalsit BJP government is pretty laid back
and restrained by world standards.
