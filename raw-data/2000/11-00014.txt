Dear Nanda Chandran, the above proposition is downright mischievous.  We
have all been been round and round on this issue too many times, and I
consider you are being unecessarily provocative in exhuming this
conversational corpse.

Please consider this to be a last warning.  If you continue to post
materials I consider pointlessly inflammatory I shall cancel your
subscription to the list.
