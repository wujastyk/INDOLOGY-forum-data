I have recorded the same pandit do at least the first three of these in the recitation of the same type of material recited at the same time in the same context. Very specifically doing both the "as" sound and "ah" echo sound at the end of a sequence, where the printed text may print them both the same. Also another pandit in exactly the same tradition doing the same thing will do some of these differently. I did not have the chance to ask why or how or when, etc. But I got the strong impression that these are NOT considered to be different text NOR are they considered to be different "styles," but perhaps just options that specific groups get in the habit of doing. From one of them I got the distinct impression that he might do it differently if he were not trying to make it clearly understood by the (non-pandit)listener.

It also certainly seems that the "end" of a sequence sometimes comes in a place that I would not expect it, resulting in unexpected pronunciations.
