 Dear Dr. Farmer,

 Learnt from your web URL about the computer-enhanced version of "horse"
 in the Indus seal by Sri Rajaram. It is interesting that he is
 determined to show the world that the Indus folks used "horses".

 At the same time, why is he denying with authority about the Dravidian
language
 family altogether? N. S. Rajaram writes, "empirical data provides no
 support for the existence of Dravidian languages independent of Sanskrit."
 (The politics of history: Aryan invasion theory and the suversion of
 scholarship [1995:177] ). With this mindset, will he allow for Dravidian
 to exist in the Indus age?

 Regards,
 SM
