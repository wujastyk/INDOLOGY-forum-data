CONFERENCE ON RELIGION IN SOUTH INDIA

CALL FOR PAPERS 2001

        The 2001 workshop of the Conference on Religion in South India
(CRSI) will be a felicitation of the career of John Braisted Carman of
Harvard University.  The theme of the workshop will be "Comparative
Theologies in South India."  This theme will allow scholars, both those
who have worked, taught and studied with John, and those who only know of
John's scholarship through reading it, to gather to address research
topics that reflect upon John's many scholarly interests in South India.

        We invite papers that address questions, issues, and themes in the
area of South Indian theology and theologies--Christian, Hindu, and
other--for a conversation that resonates with the distinguished
scholarship that has marked John Carman's career to date.

        The workshop will be held from the afternoon of Thursday, June 14,
through midday on Sunday, June 17, 2001, on the campus of Mount Holyoke
College in South Hadley, Massachusetts.  The two-and-a-half working days
will follow the usual CRSI format of allowing for more leisurely
presentation and in-depth discussion of papers than found in the larger
annual conventions.  Saturday evening will be reserved for a festive
celebration of John's career by all present.

        The CRSI website (www.emory.edu/COLLEGE/RELIGION/crsi) provides
some information about the history of CRSI as well as details of past
workshops.  At a later date this site will also provide information on
fees, registration, and travel for the 2001 workshop.

        Submit one-page paper proposals BY 20 JANUARY 2001 to:  Prof. John
E. Cort, Department of Religion, Denison University, Granville, OH 43023;
cort at denison.edu.
