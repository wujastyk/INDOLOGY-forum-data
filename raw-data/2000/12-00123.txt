I think you are right -- the new JPS bible has:
"Be your sins like crimson,
they can turn snow-white;
Be they red as dyed wool,
they can become like fleece"

Just before this verse, Isa 1.16 has "Wash yourselves clean; put your
evil doings away from My sight" which seems to contextualize v18.

Best wishes,
