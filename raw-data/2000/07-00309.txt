distinction is between the real and the unreal. From the unreal,
both the unreal and the real have value. But from the real, only
the real has value and not the unreal. The distinction is also
due to the approach of a philosopher who tries to teach reality
from the phenomenal and the jnaani who expounds reality based on
personal experience.

Let us take this argument further. If according to you in Advaita
the samsara = nirvAna + avidhya, equation doesn't work, then :

Logically mAyA can be interpreted in two ways : 1. The world is
merely an illusion and it vanishes after jnAna. 2. The world doesn't
vanish, but it is the duality that we perceive in the world that
ceases (the MAdhyamika position). So it is ontology Vs epistemology.

If the world is an illusion in the normal sense - i.e, it doesn't
exist for the jnAni after liberation, this would make a subjective
idealism of Advaita - i.e, then only the subject would be real. But
again if for the jnAni the world is an illusion in the normal
sense i.e, it doesn't exist for him, then to whom would he
teach jnAna to? For since the world is an illusion there's
nobody else apart from him. This would make the life of Shankara
who travelled around teaching Advaita, meaningless.

If it is said that for a jnAni though the world is an illusion,
he can still perceive it even after liberation, that would saying
that reality and unreality exists together. For when the jnAni
himself has "become reality" - brahmavid brahmaiva bhavati - how
can unreality exist along with him? Only as feasible, as light and
darkness existing together.

That jnAnis taught to others itself is the spanner in the works
for those who propound the "illusion" theory. It is also the proof
that the world doesn't "vanish into nothing" after jnAna - for then
they wouldn't have been able to teach it to others. The trick lies
in finding common ground between reality and unreality. An ontological
solution is impossible. So the samsAra = nirvAna + avidhya - the
epistemological solution, is the only answer.

Even modern sages like Ramana Maharishi have taught that it is
not the world itself which is the illusion, but only the duality
that we perceive in the world, that is the illusion.
