Subject: Indological reprint wishlist

Since I've been buying books recently I've been thinking about reprints.
Again and again you come across statements in an Indological book like "xyz
by abc  is the classic study on zzz".  More often than not the book is out
of print.  Sometimes you can find a used copy on an internet book search
service and sometimes you can't.  I would be interested in seeing list
members reprint wishlist.  Perhaps this might stimulate some publishers.
