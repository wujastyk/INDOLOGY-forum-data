I wonder if you took at look at the prices they are asking. Who would
pay such a ransom for these books? It's really outrageous! The prices
being asked by such publishers--think Curzon here too, not to mention
our friends at Brill-- are unjustified by any criteria. For reprints
the total costs are printing, binding and advertising. No royalties,
no editorial costs. As those who potentially publish with such
pirates, I think we should express our discontent... (not that it
will change anything...).
