I have collected a number of articles on cryptographic phenomena in
India, most not specifically on Sanskrit.  I will try to put together
a bibliography early in the new year.  Would anyone be interested in
mounting it if I do?  Things are too bureaucratic here. There was also
a poster put up at the World Sanskrit Conference in Turin that two
Italian private scholars (lawyers as I recall) were looking for
collaborators in the study of India cryptography.  I will try to dig
up their addresses at the same time.   Ms. Anderson will please remind
me if I'm slow about this.
