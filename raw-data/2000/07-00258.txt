Although UK "fudge" already looks bad enough, there is one US
meaning that looks appropriate in our case:

Am 13 Jul 2000, um 20:48 schrieb John Oliver Perry:

> The American Heritage Dictionary, 2nd College ed.,  lists:  [...]
> 2. To evade (an issue for example [as Elst above?]); dodge.

(But perhaps it is implied in the UK listing.)

Already long ago I have given up waiting for Dr. Elst's explanation of
how the year 1993 can precede 1992, or how every reference to
the BJP is a reference to A.B. Vajpayee, since he called me
"pedantic" for asking such questions (list members who were here
in September 1999 may recall this) and announced that he would
no longer respond to my postings. I am grateful that he has kept
his word.

Years ago, a well-known Dutch novelist, the late W.F. Hermans,
who was known for his outspoken criticisms of all kinds of people
(also fellow academics), was asked by an interviewer: "Whom do
you dislike most: evil people or stupid people?" His response was:
"First tell me what the difference is." This is indeed something to
think about: those two kinds of people are often hard to tell apart,
and on a certain level there really is no difference.
