Thanks, Ganesan. This has been educative, but I couldn't find
naalikam in the online Tamil lexicon, at

http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/otl_search.html.

nAL, nAl, nal etc. were listed, but nothing turned up under the
spellings naalika, naalaka, nAlaka, nAlika, nor under the same
entries with the letter m added at the end.

>Gowda-Emeneau is right to point out -aNa in sAyaNa as Drav.
>Do you think they are not Tamil?

I think it is right to derive it from Dravidian roots. Emeneau
and Gowda do cite Burnell and Cowell. But perhaps, it is not
right to link -aNa to -aNNa as in elder brother?

>ago. Has he? Foll. Burnell-Cowell, sAyaNa is Dravidian.
>Note the tamil cognate cAy- = 'reclining', 'sleeping stretched
>out the limbs'; Also, it has the meaning: to grow thin, to be

The only problem is that k/c => z does not explain s in
the name sAyaNa, which was never written as zAyaNa.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
