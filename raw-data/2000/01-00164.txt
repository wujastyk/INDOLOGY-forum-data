Firstly, Ashoka was a Nastik Buddhist. Whether Nastik Aurangzeb, Nastik
Ashoka or Nastik Clive things hardly matter from the Astik point of view.
Secondly, this statement is wrong, but I shall not belabour the point.
Interested readers may consult the numerous court chronicles to read for
themselves how Aurangzeb conquered Assam, Tibet, Afghanistan and Tamil
Nadu. Parts of Aurangzeb's empire were over-run with bandits, but these
were temporary phases.
