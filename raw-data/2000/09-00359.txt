Subject: Classical languages of India
Message-ID: <161227061956.23782.13458232006945110705.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Conspiracy by the Rotarians, Rosiscurians, Templars, Siddhas (not all),
Theosophists, the Kanchi Mutt, Madurai AAdheenam, The Hindu, Heidelberg
Order of the Rose, Arya Samaj, The Sangh Parivar(ofcourse!)
, Dinamani, The Society of the Order of Bath, The D.K, DPI, Strikers 1842,
Order of the Dragons, Sirens 1887, Thalians, Order of Osiris,
Knights of Ebony, Crewe of Don Quixote, La Luna Servante, Cowbellion de
Rakin, Order of Agrippa of Nattasheim, Max Mueller, Samuel Beckett,
Bakunin and others.

Why? Only to prevent the original "Seers" from completing their 'Mission' by
pushing their languages out of circulation and by establishing a new
hegemony of upstart languages like sanskrit and tamil.
