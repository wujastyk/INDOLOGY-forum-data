List of apparent references on Vedic literacy, you mean?
I wish I had a definitive list. Then we could look at them
calmly, one by one, and decide together how credible they
are. I'm an outsider - a comparative historian - forced to
reexamine this question for reasons different from those of
Indologists. I need your help. (Falk collects some of these,
but not all, BTW.)

What are the internal linguistic evidence and doctrinal grounds
that suggest it is late? How anachronistic is it? It certainly
must precede the 1000 CE date that we've been given.  On
"gantha/gandha," Hodge writes:

I'm putting forward the only evidence I know. If there are more
explicit passages in the Pali canon, I'd like to see them myself.
But this one, at a minimum, seems suggestive -- as do the
passages in Manuscriti I've already pointed to. Question: Does
anyone know any more?

It would be interesting to reexamine the passages in Panini,
which are of course much earlier. I'm content to step back and
listen to those who know far more than I do.

Regards to all,
