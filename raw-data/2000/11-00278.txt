Subject: Arrangement of the INDOLOGY Digest
Message-ID: <161227064010.23782.15050993451013543051.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

If one uses an email program that permits direction of individual messages
from particular sources to their own folders or directories (such as
Microsoft's Outlook Express, which is part of Windows), receiving Indology
messages individually, rather than in a single digest, solves this problem.
Using the program, the Indology messages can be automatically directed to a
separate folder or subdirectory ("Indology") where they will not clutter up
the rest of one's email.  They can then be read selectively, and replied to
individually more easily.
