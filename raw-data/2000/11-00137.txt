Subject: Pseudo-Sanskrit text of Our-Father?

>The text below can be found on the website of the Paternoster Church in

It is clearly an older version of the prayer in Malayalam.
"appam" is the standard translation for bread in south Indian
churches. The word "ninde" for "thy" and the nasalization
indicated by "gn" in words like gnangalude and gnangale are
Malayalam. It seems as if the text is transcribed as spoken,
before transliterations got standardized. I would guess that
the translation was done somewhere in northern Kerala, because,

>Agascianghelil irikkunna gnangelude ba'va`, nintiruna'mam

ba'va` = father -> points to Arabic influence, perhaps due to
the Moplah community, found in large numbers in the northern
coast of Kerala. Also, the first south Indian ruler the
Portuguese encountered was the Zamorin of Calicut. And there
is a history of Jewish presence in Cochin.

Nowadays the translation is more Sanskritized, as svargattil
vasikkum gnengaLuDe (engaL in Tamil) pitAvE, etc.

Best regards,
