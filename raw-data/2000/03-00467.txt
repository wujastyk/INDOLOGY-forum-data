One cannot be that certain. There is an important philosophical difference.
It has to do with the concept indicated by the Tamil word "Uz" dealt with in
the verses 371-380 by vaLLuvar. Dr. R. Vijayalakshmi has shown that it is not
the equivalent of karma as found in Jainism or Buddhism. Rather, it is
equivalent to niyati (destiny or fate) as expounded by Ajivikas. (See
"tamizakattil AcIvakarkaL" by Dr. R. Vijayalakshmi, 1988, International
Institute of Tamil Studies, Madras-600113)

It is difficult to neatly categorize tiruvaLLuvar as an adherent of any
particular religion.
