Thank you very much for your references. There is at least one Austro-Asiatc
tribe namely the Ho of Bihar and Orissa who indulge in cross cousin
marriages. "They trace their descent through the paternal line, and young
people are expected to marry outside the paternal clan, but there is a
prevalent custom of marrying one's cousin on the maternal side. Marriage by
elopement and by abduction are also traditionally common."

As you pointed out in your original post anthropologists point out that the
cross cousin marriage custom among the Sinhalese and the Divehis point to
their Dravidian origins.
