 From karu , we form the word karuNam meaning blackness. karuNan - black
person. karuNan will also become kaNNan with Tamil usage. (like peruNai
meaning river became peNNai)
The same karuNan may turn into kruNan>kruNa>krushNa>krishNa in Sanskrit.
Similarly it is possible karum  can turn into hurum>hrum>hirum>irum by
moving to the Northern tongue and back.

The word SyamA could be related to mAyam - meaning black.

mayoN is of course the black one.

I have also read somewhere (but do not remember the reference) that the
oldest iron ore mine in India is the one existing near Salem in Tamil Nadu.
Is it true?

Hope it helps.

With regards,
irAma.ki
