I have discussed the recent decipherment of the Indus Script in this
paper . Among the evidences collected, it shows that the Indus Valley
people migrated to the Ganga Yamuna basin. The evidence also shows the
metallurgical practises of the tribals living in Bihar state came from the
Indus Valley .
