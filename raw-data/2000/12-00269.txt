Dear 'Satish K. Tiwary'

Neither the list owner expelling you from the list
nor your withdrawal will solve the problem .

The real solution is to have an open minded free and
fair, candid discussion. After all, none of the
members of this list ever lived so long to see
the destruction of temples in India by Muslims with
their own eyes. :-)

Just like what we discuss now is based on the works
of the past historians of their respective time periods,
the future historians also would judge us on our own
writings - in book and in emails :-)

- Suresh
