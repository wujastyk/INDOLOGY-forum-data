There is a Tamil word "puttEL" (DEDR# 4275) listed  under the sense of Ta. putu
 = new...;
putiyar = new person(s), guest;
puttan2 = new person or thing;
...etc.
it means as per DEDR
"novelty, stranger, strange woman; god".

The phrases "puttEL ulaku" ("the world of gods" or "the world of novelty") and
"puttEL nADu" ("the country/place of gods")
is also employed to denote the heaven.
The CT maturaik kAJci says
at line# 698
"puttEL ulakam kavin2ik kANvara"
-->"...[the city of maturai is so resplendent as to] make the heaven to look to
it for exemplary beauty".."

tirukkuRaL: 1323:
"...pulattalin2 puttEL nADu uNDO?"
-->"...is there a more pleasant heaven than sulking with one's lover"

Now consulting the Madras Tamil Lexicon weighs in favor of Mr. Iyer's
conjectures as the lexicon does indeed ask the reader to confer the following
Tamil/Skt pairs:

Ta. putalvan - Skt. puttra
Ta. puttEL - Skt. puttala.

Is it possible that the Skt. "put-"/"puttala" itself got its other-worldly
 association specifically regarding progeny from the Tamil roots?
i.e. the hell was  called "put-" because it is a kind of "puttEL"
(generalizeable from heaven to hell) where those who die without "putalvan"
(son) go to?
