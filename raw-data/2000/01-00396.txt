You seem to be getting off track here. Where did you read that China and
Vietnam did not develop "dairy" culture. Cheese is mentioned in ancient
Chinese texts. Also, yogurt, milk and cheese was the primary food of
many peoples in Mongolia, the Uyghur areas and Manchuria.

Are you relating dairy culture with the Milky Ocean? Besides, milk also
comes from water buffalos (as does ghee).

In terms of the zebu of India, Bos Indicus is a tropical breed
indigenous to India, Africa and Southeast Asia, and is distinct from
West Asian and European taurine breeds. The zebu may have originated
in South Asia as that is where the greatest genetic diversity arises.

There is an apparent link between the domestication of Bos indicus and
B. Bubalis (water buffalo) as they are found over much of the same
tropical and semi-tropical range in domestic form.

But again the churning part of the myth may simply be a devise to
explain an unfamilar phenomenon.  If you've ever seen clips of a
pyroclastic volcanic eruption, you will note how the description I
posted, minus the supernatural stuff, matches with startling detail such
an event.

Also, I do not claim that the specific myth originated in the East, but
that the myth describes events and migrations from the eastern region.
The two are not the same.
