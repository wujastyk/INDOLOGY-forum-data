The Instituut voor oosterse talen of the Rijkuniversiteit Utrecht still
exists, but the Indological section (where Dr. Goudriaan worked)
was closed down several years ago due to the general decline in
support for the study of Indian culture, and Goudriaan retired.
Former colleagues of his working in Leiden should be able to say
how he can be reached.
