Thanks for an interesting discussion so far! I have a couple of questions.
A few years ago a saw a TV program (I believe) dealing with a tribe of
hunters in Siberia. The Shaman of the tribe would every year during a
sequence of ceremonies that lasted a week or so recite an epic of some
40,000 verses, presumably between 200.000 and 300.000 words. The program
 did not specify exactly how this was done, but I would like to know:

What are the longest texts known to have been memorized verbatim?
(Not retelling in the usual oral poetry way, but repeating word for word)


Best regards,
