Dear Gunthard,

I am not usually one to rise to the bait but your words seem to
display a certain partiality. I can only imagine that your candour
reflects a belief that TeX and LaTeX are not entirely redundant.

It is true that -- in common with all methods of electronic
typesetting or wordprocessing -- TeX has its
disadvantages. Nonetheless, for people such as Indologists,
Budhologists, Tibetologists and the like, who often have to typeset
heavily footnoted multilingual documents, the use of TeX is not
without its benefits.

Faced with the demands of one's work, each person has to decide for
themselves which is the best approach to take. And of course one
always has to keep in mind one's ability to share information with
others.

Personally, I think it is important for people to have choice. I also
find the spectre of everyone using the same approach, or the same
software, a little disturbing. I do not believe it is helpful, then,
for anyone to attempt to marginalise what is a perfectly legitimate
way to get one's work done.

If anyone wishes to emplore these issues further then they might wish
to follow this link:

Many regards,
