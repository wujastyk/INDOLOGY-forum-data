Given the use of the present tense ``carries'', I would assume
that the said critic is referring to modern-day Hindus. Anyway,
what is the context of the statement in Kripal's book? [I don't
have it at hand.] Is it about the early period or 19-20c.?

On a different but related note: Current depiction of the linga has
it emerging from something sometimes referred to as yoni. Can anybody
tell me how far back this goes?

Also, this has been called a depiction of union impled to be sexual.
But the linga seems to be going the wrong way for that. This
reminds me of attempts to connect linga/cosmic pillar to marriage
of heaven and earth [Parpola for example.] Again, the linga is pointing
the wrong way [at least for India where earth is female and heaven male.]
