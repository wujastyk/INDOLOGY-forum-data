Subject: Source for Indian folk tale about girl passed off as boy
Message-ID: <161227058610.23782.7893006508839439980.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A patron has asked about the source of "a folk-tale from India where
in a marriage alliance, a girl was passed off as a boy and she was
saved by a tiger at the moment where it was about to be discovered
that she was a girl. Eventually her sex was changed into a boy and the
tale ends well."  I am referring her to Stith Thompson's Motif index
of folk literature, Oral tales of India, and Types of Indic folk
tales.  But does anyone recognize this right off?

Thanks,

Allen
