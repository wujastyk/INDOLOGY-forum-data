Although I don't know about a study dealing exclusively with the topic you
have in mind I'd suggest to have a look at T. Burrow's "The Sanskrit
Language" (London 1955) which i.a. deals in some detail with interesting
parallels between Sanskrit and Slavonic (although some of the observations
therein might have to be taken with a pinch of salt maybe).
Best regards,
Mathias
