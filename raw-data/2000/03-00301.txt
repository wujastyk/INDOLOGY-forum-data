Could you please detail the criteria involved with
your assessment?

Why exactly are 'they' at an advantage, and where
might 'they' be presently located in time with respect
to an utterance once spoken in the far past, perhaps
within the same frame of mind as the original
speaker/writer?

Your response would be interesting to include with my
previous inquiry into the nature of translating from
language to language, and also interesting to think
about in terms of interpretation as well.

thank you
