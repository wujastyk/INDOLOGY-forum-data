Good point.
In fact, some of these PostScript-to-PDF converter programs are of
extremely high quality.
However, some of them don't allow you to directly integrate fonts into the
PDF file.
So it's important to integrate the fonts at the stage when you produce the
PostScript file, i.e. integrate the fonts into the PostScript file ("print
the fonts together with the document"). Then convert the result to PDF.
There are ways of adding fonts to existing PDF files (even with standard
UNIX commands), but the process is really very error-prone and the result
is mostly quite inefficient (large/slow).

Nevertheless, some of the code that these converters produce does not
totally conform with Adobe specs, and also there are some rather weird
converters out there which really produce a lot of gibberish. So generally
I really advise the use of the original PDF generator, i.e. Acrobat. (I
promise I don't own any Adobe shares........)
