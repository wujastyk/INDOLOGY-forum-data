Stanley Tambiah's work on Sri Lanka's ethnic fatricide provides a
background to this issue which has caused a political turmoil there since
the early eighties although this conflict goes back to ancient times as
depicted in the war between Dattagamini and Ellora in the rather lesser
known classic: "Mahavamsa." (See when fascism starts in South Asia long
before Mussolini :-) )
