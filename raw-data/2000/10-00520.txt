The "Speak Sanskrit " movement has done just this: created Sanskrit words
for modern words in order to be able to use Sanskrit as a spoken language.
You can contact Vasuvaj for more specific information (vasuvaj at hotmail.com)
or look at their web site: www.samskrita-bharati.org.

also the Kuppuswami Shastri Research Institute in Madras has published  some
work on Spoken Sanskrit.
