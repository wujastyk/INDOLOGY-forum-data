Having gone all the way to the Middle East and Africa, why
leave out ancient Egypt, the mother of all civilizations, as
acknowledged by the Greeks themselves? The Egyptians who came
to India never enslaved the Hebrews who came to India, for
they were now in the land of uninterrupted communal harmony.
Or else, they both came under the secularizing influence of
ancient Tamil culture. And you know, Horus, the Egyptian
falcon/sun god, healer of snakebites, could be the precursor
of Garuda in Indian myth. Proto-Dravidian speakers converted
word-initial h in Horus to k. In Tamil, karu means black, and
of course, the ancient Indo-Aryans, who all looked like modern
Western Europeans, would have none of that. So when the evil
Indo-Aryans came along, they converted k to g, and voila
(bring out the drumrolls here), you have Garut. Hop, skip
