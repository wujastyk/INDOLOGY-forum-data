As far as parts of southern India are concerned, I would say, without
either academic "Indological" credentials or old texts, that the
"practice" of ear elongation in recent years, at least, is merely the
outcome of wearing large, heavy ear ornaments ("ear plugs?") When women
stopped wearing these ostentatious ornaments, the practice of ear
elongation stopped, too. I've seem women of my grandmother's generation
with elongated years.
