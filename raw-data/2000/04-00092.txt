>?From my little knowledge about mongoose, the latter strikes me as more
plausible, since mongoose are known to attack and kill certain kinds of
poisonous snakes, for instance cobras. I am wondering however whether
the behaviour of the different subspecies of mongoose (herpestidae) that
were, or are, at home on the Indian sub-continent varies significantly
in this respect.

Thus my questions:
(1) Does anyone know of further passages in ancient Sanskrit literature
- by which I don't mean exclusively philosophical literature - which
shed more light on how the relation between snake and mongoose was
understood?
(2) Is anything known about the distribution of different kinds of
mongoose on the Indian sub-continent, esp. significant changes during
and since the first millenium C.E., and whether they differ at all
regarding their behaviour towards snakes?

Any help will be greatly appreciated,
