The term vajrayaana is very common indeed in Indian Buddhist tantric
literature. As Stephen Hodge mentions, it is used in the
Sarvatathaagatatattvasa.mgraha. There are hundreds, probably thousands,
of
other occurrences.

It is true that the STTS must precede the Guhyasamaajatantra. But that
the
STTS does not have any sexual rituals/imagery is, I would say,
incorrect.

Mantrayaana is indeed found in Indian texts preserved in Sanskrit. But
it
is much less common a term than vajrayaana. And I don't think I know of
a
single occurrence of guhyamantrayaana (note that Tibetan gsang sngags
kyi
theg pa is found to translate simply mantrayaana in those cases known to
me where the Sanskrit original can be checked; apart from this comound).
I'd be interested to learn of one, if Stephen Hodge has indeed come
across
the term in a text preserved in Sanskrit. I have seen the word
guhyamantranaya, but this seems to be very rare.
Mantranaya, which as Stephen Hodge says is an early term, contrasting
with
paaramitaanaya, continues also to be used, by the way, all the way up to
1200 (and probably later, in material written in Nepal).
