Dear members of the net.

A colleague non involved in sanskrit studies has sent me the following
question:

"Hindus normally explain their hospitality as inspired by the following line
in Sanskrit: "Atithi devo bhava" (treat your guests like God).

Can anyone tell me what scriptures this line appears in?"

I assume that it should be "Atithir devo bhavatu" or something to that effect.
Please send your answers to Kathinka Froystad, Kathinka at prio.no.
