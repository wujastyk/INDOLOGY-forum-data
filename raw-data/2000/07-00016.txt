A quick note to acknowledge N. Ganesan's recent response, but I do not wish
to respond to it.  Attempts at identifying the language[s] of IVC, in my
opinion, are not only premature.  They are also too controversial!  I'd
prefer to stick to a lower level of analysis -- in order to talk about the
signs themselves, and about proper methods for studying them.

Best,
