I am not sure if I have understood correctly what you are saying here
but are you saying that Buddhist monasteries and temples were not
destroyed by bands of marauding raiders (who happened to be Muslims) ?
That Nalanda and other major monasteries with there libraries were
destroyed by such people is well documented from Tibetan sources -- by
an eye-witness account in the case of Chak Lotsawa.

Best wishes,
