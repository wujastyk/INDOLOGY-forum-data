Subject: [ADMIN] additional INDOLOGY URL
Message-ID: <161227056936.23782.4813009689551235902.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have just registered a new URL for the INDOLOGY website:

        http://www.indology.org.uk

At present this merely redirects your browser to the website which you
have been familiar with in the past, i.e.,
        www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
But I hope that the new URL is slightly more memorable (don't forget that
.uk at the end).

Some time ago I also registered the URL http://indology.findhere.com  This
web service was out of action for a while, but it now seems to be working
again.  However, it depends on someone else's account, and so is subject
to vagaries beyond my control.  The www.indology.org.uk site is, I hope,
stable and permanent.

Best,
