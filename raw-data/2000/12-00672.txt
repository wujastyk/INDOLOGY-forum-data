= = = = Derivation of the word/s Kannada & Karnataka = = = =
This is in response to the inquiry (letter cited below, at the end) about
the derivation of the word/s Kannada and Karnataka
 ----
There are quite a few interesting theories (and references) as to how we
can derive and arrive at  the word/s Kannada and Karnataka.
First, I want to quote, in part, Mahamahopadhyaya R Narasimhacharya in his
book "History of Kannada Language", 1969, Prasaranga Publications,
University of Mysore, Mysore, pages 42-43:
"1.  Dr Gundert proposed 'kar-naadu', the 'black country.' as the original
form of karnaata, in allusion to the black cotton soil which characterises
the plateau of the 'Southern Dekhan' in which the language is spoken.
2.  Other schoalrs have suggested 'Karanaata' is derived from 'karu-naadu'
(the elevated country) with reference to the height of the plateau above
the sea level.
3.  Indian grammarians have expressed the opinion that Kannada is a
'tadbhava' or corrupt form of 'karnaata', [....]
4.  [...]Fragrance is indicated by the derivation from 'kammittu'
(=fragrant) + naadu(=country) which words when compounded become Kannaadu.
5.  Kannaadu, that is Kannada thus means the language of the fragrant
country, and the epithet 'fragrant'may be considered appropriate to the
Kannada country abounding as it does in sandal [wood] forests and lotus
ponds, the later being invariably described by Kannada poets as one of its
most characteristic features."
----
A random sampling of some other theories:
1.  Karunadagam (Dravida mUla pada)> karnataka
2.  Karnataka>kannada (kEshiraaja, tadbhava prakaraNa, 13th Century
Grammarian).
 3.   "karNeshu aTati, prabhUta yashasvinah Etad dEshastha rAjnah,
guNAdikIrtanEna sarvEshAm karNEshu bhramati iti" > karnaataka ("shabda
ratnaavalI")
4. karam>karu>kadu ( =large area); karu
(mahaa)+naadu(rashtra)>karnaadu>kannada
5.  kaN(= kaaNu, odamUdu)+AL>kannaLa>kannada
6.  kar+naata+akam (='kariya nAdannu oLagomda pradEsha")
7.  kaN + nIr>kaNNIr>kaNNar (Father Heras, 'people who have eyes'. "The
ancient word Kannadigas by which the people of modern Karnataka are
mentioned, seems to be a Sanskrit modification of 'KaNNir'")
(Refer :  Prof R Y Dhrawadkar, "Kannada Bhasha Shastra", Gita Book House,
Mysore, Sixth Edition, 1987, pp 125- 134;and 'Kannada VishvakOsha, Vol iii,
pp797, University of Mysore, 1971)
Please also refer to:  Dr R Caldwell, "Comparitive Grammar of Dravidian
Languages".

And then, there is the famous quote by Raajashekhara (900 AD) in his
'Kaavyamimaasa':
"rasah kO'pyastu kaapyastu rItih kO'pyastu vA guNah| sagarvam sarva
karNaaTaah ( including this eMailer!) Tankaarottara paThinah||" (pp34)

Subject: KarnATaka/KannaDa
What is the ancient name of Karnatak state?

  Both the words, Karnataka and KannaDa go back to the
same roots in Dravidian, and they are not from any
other langauge root as far as I can see. I would
very much appreciate and request Kannada scholars [ ...]
to explain how the words, KannaDa and Karnataka are explained
in KannaDa sources.
