4513 A Thought From The Upanishads To Ponder

As the same fire assumes different shapes
When it consumes objects differing in shape,
So does the one Self take the shape
Of every creature in whom he is present.

Upanishads (c. B.C. 800)

meaning and  relavance to the core Hindu Value System that
developed through the ages subsequent to the Upanishads.

2. ANY REFERRALS ON SCHOLARLY & READABLE BOOKS ON THE UPANISHADS ?

Can anyone recommend one or two  "scholarly" and yet "readable"
books  on this ancient Hindu scripture ? A discussion on contents as
well as  the likely origin and historical development  of  this
scripture, both subject is of  interest to us.

3. ANY OLDER SACRED  HINDU VEDAS OR SCRIPTURES ?
Are there older scriptures that are treasured by Hindus ? Can anyone

light on the meaning of this  particular thought from the Upanishads
as well ?

Kabir's "Ocean of  Passion" & Tagore's  "Gitanjali"

Some of you have sent me valuable comments on Kabir's "Ocean of Passion".
Thank you ! We are not yet done with the discussion on this historical
context and also the comparison of Kabir's "Ocean of Passion" and Rabindra
Nath Tagore's "Gitanjali". So if anyone has further comments or references,
such would be most welcome !
