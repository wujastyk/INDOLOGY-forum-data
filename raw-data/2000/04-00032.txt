Summer School on --
"Working of Mind: Perspectives from Indian Theoretical Traditions"
3rd June to 24th June 2000.
at Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Rashtrapati Nivas, Shimla 171 005
INDIA.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Indian theoretical traditions are particularly rich in exact reflection on
the working of Mind. Enigmas of Mind and conscious experience have surfaced
at the frontiers of quantum mechanics, neurobiology and computer/information
science. Emerging discipline of 'consciousness studies' is in look out for
fundamental principles underneath mind-matter impasse.

It is at this juncture that we offer a reasonably coherent, cohesive and
detailed account of the Working of Mind based on (1) Nyaya-Vaisesika, (2)
Jaina, and (3) Bauddha traditions. These theories evolved rigorous first
person methodologies to grasp moment-to-moment working of Mind. Apart from
these accounts we shall introduce wide arena of issues, debates and
solutions that were engaged in long Indian traditions of inquiry on the
subject. All this is done in full glare of modern 'science & philosophy'
traditions as well as current researches therein.

Main body of School will consist of two simultaneous Courses of 16 lectures
each --

1.  Mechanics of Mind: (Offered by Navjyoti Singh)
This course module is designed to teach fundamentals of the mechanics of
mind based on the three Indian analytic traditions. These theories drawing
from strands in Nyaya-Vaisesika, Jaina and Buddhist traditions will be
presented in details. Each of them is based on different temporal syntax of
mental events and causal operations of mental entities. They yeild
determinate chains of mental events under variety of conditions.

2.  Nature and Function of Mind: (Offered by P.K.Mukhopadhyaya)
This course module shall be devoted to philosophical issues and would
directly refer to relevant textual traditions. This module is designed such
that it not only will play critical role in grasping foundations of what is
presented in the first module but also expose to participants range of
analytically sophisticated problems and solutions when looked at from within
the Indian analytic traditions.

Thirty-two discussion sessions and tutorials will constitute rest of the
body of school.

The school will also feature Invited Talks by and discussions with eight
Experts on various subjects related to the topic but not directly dealt with
