This seems to represent the Sanskrit word s'yAma, which is black/dark
blue/green with connotations of "attractive" or "beautiful".  It is used
for e.g. the skin-colour of KRSNa, the colour of a rain-cloud, and (in
KAlidAsa, I think) for the colour of fresh grass after rain.

PS In South Indian painting RAma and KRSNa are sometimes depicted as green.
(Also in Kathakali drama?)
