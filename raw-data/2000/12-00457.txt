Buddhist thought was known in the Near East and among Greek speakers

Near East. There were Indians living in Alexandria in Trajans time.
Apollonius of Tyana (c. 50 AD) studied Indian philosophy at Taxila. St.
Hippolytus of Rome (second century AD) found it necessary to refute the
ideas of "Brahmanes" in his KATA PASON HAIRESEON ELENKHOS. Clement of
Alexandria (150-218 AD) mentioned Buddha by name. Bardesanes wrote a book
in the third century AD where he described a Buddhist monastery. Plotinus
was interested in Vedanta philosophy and yoga, reflected in his writings.
