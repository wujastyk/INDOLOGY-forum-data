Thanks for giving me a convenient out for my political faux pas.
I *am* using a Mac!

I *have* frequently said that the concept was anachronistic. But
I also disagree with your new point.  When someone (Sethna, not
you) does try to "prove the presence of chariots" in the Indus
Valley, and his *only* evidence consists in Harappan signs, he
better show us the elliptical and pointy signs with
cross-hatching on them -- and not draw round "wheels" when the
originals clearly aren't round.

Fully understood!
