Subject: Traditional etymology of Vaasudeva
Message-ID: <161227065304.23782.7356688088072164460.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

To clarify: I meant to ask, 'Does anybody know the reference?'

>Years ago, I saw a traditional etymology of the name Vaasudeva for Vishnu,
>tracing it to the root vas 'enter into, etc'. I believe it was attributed
to Vyasa,
>possibly taken from the Mahabharata; but now I can't find it. Does anybody
>know?

Thanks,
Martin Gansten
