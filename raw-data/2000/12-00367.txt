Satya Upadhya:

In regards to the part of your posting which mentioned Yogaacaara as an
"idealistic" school and also S. Hodge's posting, one way of investigating
this point alone (i.e. whether it is truly an idealist school) would be to
look at Stefan Anacker's "Seven Works of Vasubandhu" and Thomas
Kochumuttom's "A Buddhist Doctrine of Experience".

Within Anacker's book, you can read through the Madhyaanta-vibhaaga in both
Sanskrit and/or English and perhaps the Trisvabhaava (3 essence or
natures)-nirdesa.

Through grappling with the trisvabhaava (3 essences or natures) doctrine,
perhaps you can get some idea of whether or not this school is truly 100%
idealism. My impression is that it is not, but I'm not a specialist in
Yogaacaara. The reason I say that it is probably not is due to the doctrine
of paratantra svabhaava or dependent nature. It seems that this svabhaava is
indicating reality as it is, although I could be wrong.

Another way to investigate the 3 nature/essence theory would be to look at
Ake Boquist's review of much of the Yogaacaara literature related to this
doctrine. Boquist has published a short book (about 100 pgs. or so) in which
he translates passages from the Samdhinirmocana, Mahayaanasuutraalamkaara
etc.

Also, there was a good panel at the AAR this year on Yogaacaara.

Hope this helps,

Lynken Ghose


PS. I agree with S. Hodge's posting about s'uunyavaada not being idealistic.
