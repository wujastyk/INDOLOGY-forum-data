I recently was researching the various 19th century theories about
Atlantis for a small book on the subject and the following information
seems somewhat pertinent -- some may already be familiar with it but
perhaps it will interest others:

In the early decades of the 20th century, there was a secret
organization with its headquarters in Munich called the Thule Society
(Thule Gesellschaft).   It derived its name from the legendary island
in the North Sea that was believed to be a part of Atlantis and was
believed to have served as a refuge for the fleeing Atlantean Aryans
and was as such the source of all higher culture.   Dedicated to
occultism and the establishment of a pan-German state, the Thule
Society set up and funded the German Workers Party with the specific
aims of promoting German nationalism, anti-Communism, anti-Semitism
and the supremacy of the Aryan race.   Adolf Hitler joined this German
Workers Party after the First World War and soon took over its
leadership, transforming it into the National Socialist Party.  These
ideas of an Aryan "master race" appealed to the disgruntled Hitler and
he quickly adopted many of its ideas in his bid to create a German
super-state.  He also seems to have believed that Aryans originated in
Atlantis and that it was his destiny to restore the Aryan race to its
original pristine purity.   His favourite henchman, Heinrich Himmler,
who became head of the SS, was especially interested in the occult and
tried to make his contribution to civilization by eliminating the
various "inferior races".

If there is one thing that history teaches us, it is that people do
not learn from history !

Best wishes,
