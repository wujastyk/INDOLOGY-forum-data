Dear list members,

I would appreciate information from non-Tamil sources on the following
questions.

1.What did the Jains (2000-1500 years ago) believe  regarding the karmic
reward for butchers, hunters, sacrificing priests, prostitutes, and
meat-eaters?

2.What did the Buddhists believe (2000-1500 years ago) believe  regarding the
karmic reward for butchers, hunters, sacrificing priests, prostitutes, and
meat-eaters?

3. Were the Ajivikas' beliefs different from the above?

Thanks in advance.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
