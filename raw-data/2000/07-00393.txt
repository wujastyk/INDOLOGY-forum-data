G.F.Dales in his article "Sex and Stone at Mohenjo-Daro (Frontiers of
 the Indus Civilization. Ed. by B.B.Lal and S.P.Gupta. Sir Mortimer
 Wheeler Commemoration Volume. New Delhi, 1984, pp. 109-115)
 reconsidered traditional interpretation of some specific stone
 artefacts as symbols of lingam and yoni. In Dales's opinion there
 are no grounds for this "erotic symbolism" interpretation. Instead he
referred
 to the hypothesis by M.Jansen who had suggested that the stone
 rings might have been used in measuring angles and making astronomical
 calculations.


RB> a suspented cone could be used as a plumb line. The ring could be used
for marking a spot vertically below the point of suspension?

What about the circular platforms are they always of the same diameter? Are
the layout of the bricks in a standard repeated form? If so that could
signify an understanding of the relationship between the radius and
perimeter of a circle.
