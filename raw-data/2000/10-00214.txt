Mr. Abbas, perhaps you will realize that the discussion was about a
Tamil-language-speaking, Islam-religion-following, Sri-Lanka-residing
population. NOT Muslims in Tamil Nadu.

And Irish - JFK was the prime example. The trend in the US is to have all
sorts of hyphenated Americans, based on the region of ancestral origin. But
this holds largely for Christians of various denominations. There is a
category of Muslim-Americans that intersects with that of Arab-American and
Asian-American (African-American followers of the Nation of Islam are a
separate category in themselves). A Lebanese Christian in the US would only
be an Arab-American, but not a "Christian-American".
