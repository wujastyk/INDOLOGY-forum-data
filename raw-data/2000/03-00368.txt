Yes, Samar posted some of these and they should be in the archives.
The most notable are those from Bamshad et al.

Also, a study last year tended to confirm what many thought but was
never proven -- a degree of relationship between Andaman Islanders and
the Pgymy of Africa.

As Raveen noted there are still some whole groups and plenty of
individuals with 'Negrito-like' characterisitics on the subcontinent.
Also, it has long been noted that his type frequently appears in Gupta
artwork.

You can find the whole Scientific American article on the web:

"Out of Africa, into Asia"
http://www.sciam.com/1999/0199issue/0199scicit1.html

However, no study has been constructed to examine this theory
specifically. Most of the data has come accidentally while trying to
prove something else.

Yes and no -- something more recent is often suggested -- the Holocene
period.  Rashidi notes that there was an expansion of Asian "Negroid"
types around 20-30 kya, but I don't believe he specifies where this
originates. In fact, the evidence points to an Australomelanesian
movement around this time probably originating in SE Asia. These people
likely developed out of African migrants who came to Asia around 60 kya.

ANCIENT AFRICA AND EARLY INDIA

     Exceptionally valuable writings reflecting close relationships
between Africa and early India have existed for more than two thousand
years. In the first century B.C.E., for example, the famous Greek
