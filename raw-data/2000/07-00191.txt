It's hard, but could all the participants in this thread p l e a s e calm
down, and stick to the discussion of the new book in scholarly terms.

Incidentally, it's a pity Subbarayappa's 1996 decipherment didn't get this
amount of discussion.  I don't agree with that either, but it was more
interesting, I think.  (B V Subbarayappa, Indus script: its nature and
structure (New Era Publications, POB 2459, Madras 600 028, 1996).
