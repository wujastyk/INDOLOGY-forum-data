Not to turn this into a biblical studies, Stephan, but the
so-called first creation account in Genesis 1 ff. is ascribed to
the P and not E layer -- placing it many hundreds of years later
than you date it. The distinction isn't a quibble, since the kind
of transcendent deity that you find in Genesis 1 ff. doesn't
appear in either E or J. It is critical to note that such views
didn't exist before the mid part of the first millennium BCE. E
begins with the story of Abraham and not with the creation.

Many layers have been proposed by scholars after the four in
Graf-Wellhausen (J, E, D, P). There is no more consensus on which
ones are valid than there is a consensus on stratifications in
Vedic documents.
