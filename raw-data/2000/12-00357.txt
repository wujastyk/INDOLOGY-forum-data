There is, to the best of my knowledge, no evidence that
there have *ever* been matriarchal societies as such arguments
normally portray them.  The mistake often rests on either (a)
a confusion between matriarchy and matrilineal descent; and/or
(b) unjustified inferential reasoning based on the existence of goddess
worship.  Both features are reasonably common among contemporary
societies and those in the historically documented past.  However,
NONE of the societies concerned can reasonably be characterised
as 'matriarchal'.

A more radical critique would be to attack the terminology itself,
i.e., to point out the inadequacy of characterising whole
civilisations, in their full complexity, in terms of such simplistic
dichotomous labels.  In those terms, it is not meaningful to
describe societies as patriarchal either.
