also in connection
>with the donations made to non-Buddhist religions in India, I think it
originated
>with Brahmanism.
>If possible, I would like to know its origin and the legend connected with
>this custom.  I would also like to know whether there are any sculpture or
>painting in India representing the Earth Goddess (Vasumdhara).
>Sincerely,
