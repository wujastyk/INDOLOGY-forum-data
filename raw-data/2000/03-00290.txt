>?From an outsider's perspective: The Indology List is a unique
international resource. I can say that as a participant in two

put it.

I'll be back in the next few weeks. Thanks to all those off-line
who are feeding me data and pointing me to useful sources. Much appreciated.

My regards,
Steve Farmer
