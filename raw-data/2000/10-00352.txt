Subject: making of a cultural man
Message-ID: <161227062797.23782.10971851516460692343.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Steve Farmer's assertion  (18 October) that the pseudo-indological endeavours of U S -based Indian engineers might be due to their defective education back home raises some pertinent questions:

(1) If the fault lies with the education, then the class-fellows of the U S-based engineers who have remained back in India should also show similar traits. Is this the case?

(2) If we look at engineer graduates from England, Scotland ,France and Germany,is the cultural spread among them of the same order of magnitude as the spread in their education system?

(3) What are the factors that may in principle go into making a cultural man? Can one say that all factors other than technical education  are irrelevant or immaterial?

(4) What role does geographical displacement from one's natural  habitat play in shaping the cultural perception of an individual or a group?
