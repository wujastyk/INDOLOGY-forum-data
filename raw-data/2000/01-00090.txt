   The roman letters are preferred over the indian kind and, Indian
  place value notation in the world. Both for efficiency.

   The "powerful abstraction" of Sanskrit/Tamil alphabets are 100 %
  retained even while writing in roman.

   Is Phonology not a part of grammatical analysis? Transliteration
in Roman in no way reduces any specialty of Indian phonology.

  Yes, we can think of many things; However, consideration can be
given to the roman script applied world-wide successfully already.

  That is exactly what is done while transliterating Indian
languages.
