Greetings-

There seem to be two publications available of the Gilgit Buddhist
manuscripts:

1 A reprint of the Vira/Chandra facsimilie edition, offered by Vedams books,
in 3 volumes.

2 A reprint of Dutt's 1939 4-volume edition, also offered by Vedams. Is this
a critical edition? If so, is it legible and/or reliable?

Is the Vira/Chandra reprint of good quality, that is, are the
photoreproductions decent enough to work from?

Thank you for any and all advice

Dante Rosati
