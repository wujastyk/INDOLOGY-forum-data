I do not think the speech is as innocuous as it might seem to Vidyasankar.
One can subject the quote from Ramamurthi's speech to the same textual
analysis processes Indologists use with other texts.

What struck me most about the speech is the quoted time of 70 centuries. How
does one go from 50 centuries of Kali yuga to 70 centuries. Is the use of 70
centuries a common hyperbole? At least, I have not heard it in traditional
usage. If others have, I would like to know.

On the other hand, in the announcement of Rajaram and Jha's book in the web
site http://www.safarmer.com/pico/crackedcode.html, we find the following:

"The implications of these findings go beyond the borders of India --
leading to a possible change in our viewpoint on the origin of civilization
itself. Since Dholavira, according to Bisht, has shown planned cities
dating to the fourth millennium, the Vedic Civilization of the Sarasvati
heartland must go back at least to the fifth."

"well over 70 centuries" in Ramamurthi's speech equates to stating that the
Vedic civilization  must go back "at least to the fifth" millennium BC.

To me what the speech reveals is the efficacy of the propagation of views of
Rajaram and others like him in reaching the Indian intelligentsia outside the
limited circle of Indologists. This directly relates to what Dr. Witzel
stated in his post.
