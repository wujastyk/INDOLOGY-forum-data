Subject: publication of IASS papers on CDROM
Message-ID: <161227065200.23782.5430320517550798912.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I support the view of Dominik Wujastyk, that the disadvantages of
publishing on a CDROM are more (and more serious) than e.g. the
advantage of make copies from it.

All texts, which are written in older systems (MSDOS, Windows3.1 to 98)
one has to convert if one would like to publish them on the Web in a
Unicode format, which the newest standard at the moment. It takes so
much of time! On the other hand, if you use an ASCII or RTF-format you
will not have the problem of converting the file to the same extend. But
one has still the problem, that the search engine will not work anymore.
This problem I had with TLG-CDROM, which is coded in ASCII but has a
search enginge for Windows3.1.

A last point: The format of drives changes, too. If you remember the
older formats of floppy disks, which are now replased by CDROMs. I would
assume that CDROMs will be outdated and replaced by an other medium
within the next 6 or 7 years.
