>???From a practical political point of view, Panikkar's version of history is
probably less damaging to India's body politic and society than the "critical"
version of history you want to see published. However, if Panikkar's view is as
stated by you earlier, I don't share it. So should I shout my opinion from the
rooftops and contribute to  a potential blood-bath? Or should I discuss my
views in fora where I am surrounded by responsible persons who will not run off
and kill their Muslim neighbours because of injustice suffered by their
forefathers long ago? I would opt for responsibility.

As an afterthought, I come to remember the situation in France a couple of
years ago, when several books on French collabation with the German occupation
force during WWII were published. As I remember it, it transpired that such
collaboration had been much more widespread than assumed until recently.
Apparently, the true war history of France had been deliberately suppressed on
the initiative of General de Gaulle, who had the statesmanlike idea that it
would be easier to build a new and better France if the French were convinced
that they had been a nation of heroic resistance fighters rather than a bunch
of unprincipled opportunists, traitors and cowards. So for 50 years, they were
told that they had been heroes (which of course many of them were). And now, it
doesn't matter what they are told. Is there a lesson here?
