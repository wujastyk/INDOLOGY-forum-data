data. From the tone of the posts, you can see why Kumar's
interest in my homelife (mentioned in passing in answering the
absurd "racist" charge) is not welcome. These gems come from our
Hindutva friends on that List (in this case, one Ashok Row Kavi)
in the last five days:

I leave aside here the mundane accusations we've received of
being "communists" -- or details about the computer viruses that
both M. Witzel and I have received in the last week. Or this
little jewel -- the entire message -- dropped in my email box the
other day:

None of this, of course, has anything to do with critiques of
Rajaram or the absurdities of Hindutva "revisions" of history.
