 From Dahilaxmi Library, I used Nirukta with Durga's commentary and
AtharvaVeda Samhita. There are a number of menuscripts, but they are in a
sorry state. I, as a recently added member of managing committee, am
persuading the management to seek external help for preservation. I have also
computerized the library. I have my own library, of course.

I became member of this list because I sincerely think that I have something
to contribute. I have no axe to grind. It seems I have ruffled a few
feathers, is it so?
