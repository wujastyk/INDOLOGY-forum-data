The Book of the Apocalypse / Revelations is generally thought to have
been written c120 CE but seems to be a Christian re-working of typical
Jewish apocalyptic writings that were common up until the end of the
2nd Temple Period (72 CE) -- several similar ones were found at Qumran
(Dead Sea Scrolls).  I have an interesting interpretive article which
analyzes this text from a historical point of view I could send you
off-list if you are interested.

It first gained its negative overtones in the hands of the early
Church Fathers around the 2nd - 3rd century CE when they were
attacking rival brands of Christianity.
