There exists a very fine article in English on the Buddhist sites at Muktinath and its vicinity in the Himalayan journal "Kailash". Unfortunately, I do not have a copy at hand and I cannot recall its title, date or author. If needed, email me off-list and I can try to get the reference.

With best regards,
