That the brahmanic ideal was spiritual, is something that I just said in
the passing. But you blew up that particular point and went into the
- spiritual east vs materialistic west, Vivekananda myth, religious
propoganda etc - mode. Was that justified? The same is the case with
comparing India with Europe.

And yet you accuse me of indulging in polemics for fun!

Though you didn't explicitly mention Buddhism, the tone of the argument
is pretty typical of Euro centric/leftist interpreters of Indian history
who try to glorify Buddhism at the expense of Vedic Hinduism. And the
comparison between Buddhism and Hinduism, I'd also presented it in quotes,
which obviously wasn't from your post. It was only a general reference to an
attitude so typical of some biased historians. If you do not want others to
mistake you as part of this clique, then you should be careful about what
you write. If you are so, then there'll be little need for your imagination
run riot about people trying to accuse you of something that you didn't say.

Maybe you could answer it for me.
