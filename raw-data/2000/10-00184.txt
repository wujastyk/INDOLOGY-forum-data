Subject: Coronation of a king
Message-ID: <161227062478.23782.18190251351399216615.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is there a ceremony or an oath for the coronation of a king, or
description of yagyas described in the Smritis, Itihasa, Arthashastras
or other Vedic and classical Sanskrit texts?

    Thank you for your help.
