Dear Mr Jain (and list),

I am delighted to know about your new series, and I am -- as you know --
an admirer of your publishing house, with which I am happy to collaborate
closely.  But it is a long-standing rule that the INDOLOGY list is not to
be used for any commercial purposes.

Your announcement falls somewhere in a grey area: we are all academically
interested to know about a new book series in our field; on the other
hand, it is clearly in your commercial interests to promote your
publications through the INDOLOGY list.

So I would request you in future to write to me personally on matters of
this type, and allow me to act as a mediator.  I can edit your
announcement into a brief form suitable for the list's members, if I think
fit.

I do not know if you are aware, but you have posted your message about the
new series to the list five times now!  I must ask you most vigorously not
to do so again.  Do you realize your five postings will have created over
three thousand email messages.  The recipients will certainly be annoyed
by the repetitious postings, and this may have the very opposite effect to
that you are hoping for.

It may be that you are posting to the list by accident.  Please make sure
that your email address for me does not include the "indology" address.

Warmest regards,
Dominik
