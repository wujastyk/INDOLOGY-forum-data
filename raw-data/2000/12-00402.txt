>???From  all this it  is safe to conclude that in order to understand the
origins  of  the Vedic civilization,  and its history, it is necessary
first to drop the west-northwest bias that has dominated discourse for
nearly  two centuries.  One of  the keys  to this  is recognizing  the
maritime background of Vedic civilization. In this context it is worth
recording  that the  Rigveda is preeminently an Indian document. While
there  are occasional  references to the lands beyond the Indus, these
are  greatly  exceeded by references  to oceans and maritime activity.
Prayers  for the safety of ships and navigators occur in many parts of
the  Rigveda.  This again shows  a southern rather than a northwestern
orientation.

Recognizing  this will allow scholars to break free of the shackles of
the  northwest, particularly the Aryan Invasion Theory, which has been
a  major obstacle  to a rational study of India. The next logical step
is  to explore links between the Vedic Civilization and movements from
the  south,  and the  resulting exchanges of  people and ideas between
different  regions. Ecological changes, notably the ending of the last
Ice Age contributed to it in a major way, in the form of two momentous
developments.  First, rising sea levels led inhabitants of the coastal
regions,  and possibly also from now submerged regions, to move to the
interior  and the north seeking safer ground. Next, the melting of ice
caps  in the  north  resulted in  the  release of  the  rivers of  the
northern   plains-making   this  formerly   arid  region  fertile  and
inhabitable.

These  two epochal events are encapsulated in the two most significant
myths  of  ancient India- the Flood  Myth of Manu and the Indra-Vritra
Myth.  The Rigveda appears  to be the product of the mix of two groups
of  people:  tribes and  ruling families that  inhabited the north and
poets and sages from the coastal regions and the south - some possibly
from  beyond the  seas - who brought with them their maritime memories
and experiences. This explains why the Rigveda, though composed in the
Sarasvati   heartland,  abounds  in  oceanic  symbolism  and  maritime
activity. But soon the distinction between the northern rulers and the
southern sages came to be blurred as the two groups became intermixed.

It  is therefore  no  accident that  two of  the  most important  seer
families of the Rigveda - the Vasishthas (and the brother Agastya) and
the Bhrigus - should have strong maritime connections. It is important
also to know that the south or the peninsular India and beyond was not
unknown  to  the Vedic people,  especially the seer families. But much
information  about  it has  been overlooked or  misread in attempts to
make data fit the northwestern orientation of scholars over the better
part  of  two centuries.  Even so-called 'nationalistic' scholars like
Tilak  and  Savarkar have not  been able to  escape its hold. The main
point  is that in studying the Vedas, science demands that we pay much
greater attention to the south and southeast than has been the case so
far. This calls for a fairly radical reorientation.

Southern contribution

Recognizing  the  southern  contribution  to  the  Vedic  civilization
clarifies  many  literary, linguistic  and  historical  issues in  the
ancient  texts.  It is  inconceivable that these  poets and sages, who
brought  with  them the  oceanic imagery  and the maritime experiences
that  pervade  the Rigveda did  not also bring linguistic elements and
spiritual  ideas that  went into the Vedic language and literature. It
becomes  clear that  many ancient  peoples and  even places  have been
grossly  misidentified in attempts to fit history and geography to the
idea  of an  'expansion of Aryans' from the northwest to the south and
southeast.  For  example, the Ramayana  has been misinterpreted as the
expansion  of Aryan  civilization into the peninsula. In reality, what
Rama  found in the south, even in Lanka, was a Vedic civilization. The
Uttarakanda  of  the Ramayana  is a goldmine  of information about the
southern,  largely maritime  people known as the 'Rakshasa'. The river
Narmada appears to have served as the boundary between the 'spheres of
influence' of the Rakshasas of the south and Ikshvakus and Bharatas of
the  north, with  the Yadus  somewhere  in between.  And the  Rakshasa
leaders  often  retreated to  Rasatala - the  'nether lands' (or 'Down
Under')  -  when  threatened.  This  Rasatala  was  probably  part  of
Indonesia or some other region of Monsoon Asia.

So,  what  we have is not  any 'expansion of Aryans from the northwest
and  the  north', but  a  free  exchange  of  people and  ideas  among
different regions- much as it has existed throughout history including
today.  And this included lands beyond the oceans. It was interrupted,
as  previously noted,  during the  period European  domination of  the
region.  Naturally  enough, they looked  at history and culture of the
region  through Eurocentric  glasses. This  is the  'history' that  is
still  being followed by most establishment Indologists, especially in
the  West, though it is giving way under the impact of archaeology and
a more rational approach to the study of the primary literature.

In  summary, bringing  this  southern reorientation  of ancient  India
appears  to resolve  many of  the  puzzles and  paradoxes that  plague
current   theories  that   try  to  explain  the  Vedic  and  Harappan
Civilizations  in terms of invasions and/or migrations. This is not to
suggest   that  a   southern  origin  for  the  growth  of  the  Vedic
Civilization  should  replace the  current version.  All that is being
suggested  is  that it is  an important  but sadly neglected area that
merits serious study.

Of  one thing  we can  be certain:  trying to  explain the  origin and
growth  of  the Vedic Civilization  in terms of migrations/invasions a
few  thousand  years ago runs  into formidable scientific and literary
obstacles.  We should  learn from  this experience  and first  build a
scientific foundation that makes use of all data available today. Only
then can we hope to recover the history of that hoary age based on the
records  they left behind. As Albert Einstein said: "A theory must not
contradict empirical facts."
