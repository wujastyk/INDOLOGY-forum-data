Fascinating! If this influence is indeed well established it deserves to
more broadly known. Are there discernable influences of Kampan Ramayana on
Tuslidas? Is this more of an influence than Valmiki's Ramayana?  The answers
to these questions would be critical in establishing Iyer's thesis.

Would you be so kind as to quote in detail from Iyer's book since I, and I
suspect most of the members of Indology, do not have access to it.


As an aside, in what language did Kumarakurupara lecture?

Best regards,

Shailendra Raj Mehta.
