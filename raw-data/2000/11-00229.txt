Subject: etymology of mani
Message-ID: <161227063877.23782.628843445251479411.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear listmembers,

If mani, "jewel" etc., is a non-IE, indigenous Indian word, why and how was
it accepted into Hurrian? Is there a reasonable etymology? Is the word
known in Dravidian languages and what does it mean in these languages?


Best wishes,
Bjarte Kaldhol
