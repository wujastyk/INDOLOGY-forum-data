Have not read much of Klostermaier, but some of his theories
(for example, the RV several millennia before IVC) have not found
much acceptance among Indologists.

The 4-color var.na scheming is rather late. In early vedic, it is only
aarya and daasa var.nas, white and black respectively. And, this
white vs. black duality is absent in Tamil literature.
Contrary to the views of people like Prof. Hock and Prof. Farmer,
this duality idea is not universal at least insofaras India is
concerned. Many, many scholars (for eg. Joseph Campbell) attribute
the black vs. white duality in the Bible to Indo-Iranians.

There is an "anthropological" explanation for all the color scheme
mentioned in Mahabharata onwards. Take the case of the Rgveda and
Avestan gathic literature. It has "white" against "black" dyadism
well spelt out. Also, the aarya varNa vs. daasa varNa in the earliest
Vedic material. The brahminical scheme of classification seems to
have initially only black versus white dualism. Later caste
classifications for plants, animals, and even for fish, ... flourish.
Diighanikaya has an attack on aaryavarNa vs. daasavarNa (ie., white
vs. black) leading to accomadation. See M. Deshpande's  note on
B. Smith's book on varNa classification  of the Universe in India:
