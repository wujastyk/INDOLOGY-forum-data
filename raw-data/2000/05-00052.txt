Check out VKYOGAS site...

Mere repitition is not of much use, but the person must
associate some kind of value(spiritual?) with the mantra.

I remember reading that while om seems to have some effect
on people in India, studies were being conducted in
Florida on seniors who have no idea what om is.

VKYOGAS will have more information on these tests.
