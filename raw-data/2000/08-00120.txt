Ergo, the camps that want to establish

     >a sufficiently "ancient" Vedic source for the phrase
      (Peter Freund on August 4, 2000)

must not only consider the age of the MahopanoSad in itself, but also
the age of the passage, which is perhaps part of a later addition.

Deussen?s translation (*Sechzig Upanishad?s des Veda*, Leipzig 1897)
appears (p. 538 - 539) to be based on the edition of G. A. Jacob:
*Eleven ?tharvaNa Upanishads with D?pik?s*. *Bombay Sanskrit Series*
# 40. 1891, (2)1916.

According to Deussen, MahopaniSad belongs to the generally
acknowledged UpaniSads of the Atharvaveda (p. 543), and it is the
oldest of the ?tharvaNa vaiSNava UpaniSads (p. 743, n.1).
