Whoa ! Hold your horses !

The "What you see is (on the computer screen) is what you get (on the
printed page" is a skillfully created illusion created courtesy of computer
engineers.

One of the reasons that this is an illusion is simply because the video
screen has a resolution of about 100 dots per inch, while the low end
desktop printer today does at least 300 dots per inch.

Try scanning in and displaying on computer screen a group photograph with
lots of small faces in which every face appears clear to you on the print
version, and you will understand better what the above means.

The accusation of fraud against Rajaram is well-justified based on the
scanned evidence presented here.  I would not base a conviction on anything
but the printed evidence, however.
