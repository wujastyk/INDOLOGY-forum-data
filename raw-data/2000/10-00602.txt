Dear Dr. Tilak,

I just sent you a private message.  Apologies.  It went to the Indology
list as a whole.

"Herewith a copy:

Dear Dr. Tilak,


I would like to attend the conference on the Mahabharata you announced some
time ago.

If it is not too late, I would like to offer a paper fitting into the
second of your categories.  I have not yet formulated a full paper but a
tentative title would be:

The Mahabharata's Simultaneous Affirmation and Critique of the Universal
Validity of Dharma.

I apologize for responding to you so late.

Would please be able to confirm whether my paper is acceptable to you.


Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Greg Baile"


Take it is a reflection of my incompatability with computers.

Cheers,


Greg Bailey
