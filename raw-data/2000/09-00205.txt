Mughal's work is one of the many .  There are many others . Some are

I had mentioned in Part I ( 59 ) , and II ( 42 ) of Sept 2000, the possible
reason for  1700 BCE . Those having more interest in the drying up of the
Saraswati river can look into the work at other web sites . Those are not
my research . One has to start some where .

It is a fact  and well established that Indus Civilization had well
developed metallurgy and the transition from Bronze to Iron Age in a
country like India which had the necessary raw materials, and technology,
is not at all surprising if it happened that early .

It is difficult indeed to accept such a thing for those who have believed
that long that India was not advanced , as far as metallurgy is concerned .
But, the facts , and a reasonabilty points towards, some thing else.

Thanks.
