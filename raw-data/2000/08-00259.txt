Dear colleagues,

recently I heard about a new book on Atisha published
by Motilal Banarsidass and I'd like to know which treatises
of this buddhist teacher are translated in it. Here is its title:

The Complete Works of Atisa : (The Lamp for the Path, The Commentary, together with the Newly translated Twenty-Five Key Texts)((Tibetan and English))
Richard Sherburne (Tr.), Dalai Lama (Foreword)

Many thanks in advance!

Yours sincerely,
Dmitry Olenev
