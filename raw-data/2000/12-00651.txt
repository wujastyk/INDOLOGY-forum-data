Hello, Dominik,
talked to Lou the other day, and learned from your involvement with them.
Sounds like we are actually thinking along similar lines... At least we share
two teachers... I didn't know Susan Hockey was back in London. That's
phantastic.
Thank you also for the information on microfilm digitisation possibilities
in India. The RMRL already got in touch with me, but prefers to discuss
coop off the list.

Anyway, thanks for the information. Maybe we can meet on the metadata
issue when I am in London next? If you let me have your personal mail
address I could get in touch off the list.

Best wishes for the New Year,
Gunthard
