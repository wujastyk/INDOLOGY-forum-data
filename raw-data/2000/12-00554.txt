"At an early stage in his missionary career, Caldwell became interested in
a toddy-tapping caste known as the Shanars (today called Nadars), and in
1849 he published a book entitled The Tinnevelly Shanars. It earned him
considerable repute, but annoyed the English educated Shanars, who disliked
his ascribing a non-Aryan origin to their group. Some twenty years after
the publication of the book agitation against it was started. There was
great controversy, and some riots occured, and the book was withdrawn from
circulation"
