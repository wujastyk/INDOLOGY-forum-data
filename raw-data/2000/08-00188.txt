Is there a technical term for the indirect locutions that Sanskrit poets
are so fond of?  When a Viking poet calls the sea "the whale's way", we
call it a kenning.  When a Sanskrit poet calls the sea "the husband of the
rivers" (or indeed an English speaker calls it "the herring pond") we call
it--what?
