Many thanks to Arlo Griffiths, Yaroslav Vassilov and Koenraad Els for the references provided concernining S. and U"s biographies.
As a matter of fact I'm particularly concerned with these Orientalist's - as well as others'- connection with the Tibetan Buddhism in late XIX and early XX centuries' Russia, the "Great Game", the construction of the Buddhist Templo in Saint Petersburg, the role of Agwan Dordjieff and so forth. Any further bibliographical material would be most welcome- it may be in Russian or even Caucasian languages.

J.C.
