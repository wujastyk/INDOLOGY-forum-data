Subject: Tamil and Sanskrit Sound Exchanges
Message-ID: <161227064106.23782.1648201541394422980.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dr.R.Mathivanan in his book (Indus Script among Dravidian Speakers-page46)
wrote about the Second Tamil Academy ended in 2380 BCE and the third Tamil
Academy was convened by Pandya king at Madurai around 1800 BCE.Attested
records show that Sangam literature does not go back beyond 326 BCE.I am
interested in technological knowledge as reflected in the ancient Tamil
language because in 326 BCE, the South India(called Taprobane at that time)
had war machine bigger than that of the North India as evidenced by the
collection of 8000 war elephants in the south compared to 5000 by Magadha
in the north to face Alexander in case he decided to move further east.In
order to understand technology related word exchanges between Tamil and
Sanskrit,we need Tamil/Sanskrit scholars(Good suggestion by Dr.V.V.Raman-
Nov.8)to explain consistent sound changes in words from these two ancient
languages.Sound exchanges between Sanskrit and Persian are explained by
Grimm's Rule.Such sound exchanges between languages often follow set
patterns. Jewish king Solomon's "tuki-um"(peacock) was Tamil "tokei" and
Sanskrit "Shikhin(or Zikhin). Tamil "Agattiyar" is Sanskrit
"Agastya.h".Are words "Tiru-pati" and "Shri-pati" related to each other? To
the best of my knowledge there is mismatch between the number of graphemes
of NAgari script of Sanskrit and Tamil script.To the best of my knowledge,
certain sound combinations characteristic of Sanskrit like "Pra" in
"PrabhAkara" are not possible in Tamil (PirbhAkaran).In that case by what
rule "Pir" becomes "Pra" in Sanskrit? I am asking this question because
Sanskrit "Pra" in the name "PrabhAkara" is Upasarga attached to many other
Sanskrit words. Is Tamil "Pir" also a Upasarga".Could 22 to 25 Upasargas of
Sanskrit be derived from earlier Tamil Upasargas? Many technical words in
the ancient Sanskrit manuscript are difficult to understand. If we find
their ancient Tamil equivalents along with their meanings, then perhaps we
could make progress.Some refrences and books describing the laws of sound
changes etween Tamil and Sanskrit are appreciated.Thanks.Aryans clearing
forests in the North India east of GangA river in 1000 BCE when Sindh was
exporting Teak wood logs to the Middle East and the South Indian king
signing trade aggreement with Jewish king Solomon makes me wonder-something
could be wrong somewhere in the chronology in the pre-history of India.
