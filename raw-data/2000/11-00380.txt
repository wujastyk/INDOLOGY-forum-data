Dear Mr. Gupta,

You have completely misunderstood the point I was making and started
attributing non-existent motives in your last paragraph. I am surprised as
to how an innocuous expression can be misunderstood. If it had been
otherwise, I would not have written Krishnan alias KaNNan, when I signed.

What I was stating was quite simple.

Whatever be the skin colour of the child, mothers (including Brahmin ones)
often call their child 'kaNNa' as a mark of endearment. So our parents' are
stating that blackness is not something to be ashamed off . Black can be
bright and beautiful too. That I find it interesting and thought provoking,
since it shows basic human decency through a mother's expression.

With regards,
RM.Krishnan
