The Motilal (MLBD) newletter I received today (Oct 2000) refers to
the discovery of an Asokan Stupa in Orissa (Langudi hill, near
Dharmasala in Jaipur district), with inscription  "written in early
Brahmi characters", as well as terracotta seals yet undeciphered.

Is there any further news on this discovery?
