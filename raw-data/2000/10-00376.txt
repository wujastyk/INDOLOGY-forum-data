For Marathi studies in Pune, contact Professor Ashok Kelkar in Pune.
Other people who may be of help are people at the Maharashtra Sahitya
Parishad in Pune.  As far as I know, Professor G.N. Joglekar was in charge
of it.  A third contact is Professor Sarojini Vaidya (Prof. Ashok
Aklujkar's sister).  These people may be able to provide further contacts
in Pune.  And don't forget Anne Feldhaus, who spends a good deal of time
in Pune.
