I've heard counterarguments like Arun Gupta's repeatedly, but
they always overlook a glaring problem. Indo-European languages
didn't just replace earlier languages in northern South Asia in
the second and first millennia BCE. They also replaced earlier
languages in vast portions of Eurasia, including of course
Anatolia, Greece, and the Italian peninsula. The Indian problem
is not as unique as chauvinistic writers make it out to be.
