D. Schmandt-Besserat, talking of clay tokens of the
ancient Near East (which were used as counters and
tallies) in her Before Writing (Univ of Texas Press,
Austin, 1992, p. 195), says "They were the precursor
of writing and document communication in prehistory.
They were the precursor of numerals and shed light on
the origin of mathematics".

In what follows she asks certain questions. "The
tokens also raise new questions concerning the essence
of writing. Was the first script of the Near East
unique in deriving from a counting device? Or is
literacy universally tied to numeracy? Is numeracy a
prerequisite for literacy?"

In answer she quotes the following verse by Thomas
Astle and concludes the book :-)
