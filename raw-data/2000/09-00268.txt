As it seems to me, there is great difference between foundation of a
soteriological religion - and  establishing a political party or organizing
a revolution. Great political events are predetermined by many social,
economical and ideological factors, - while the "seed" out of which the
"tree" of any soteriological religion grows is constituted by the founder's
mystical, psychological experience. Human contacts with the Sacred or
Supernatural have their own history of development (and of decline!) but in
this history a founder, as a mystically gifted individual, plays an
exceptional role.
