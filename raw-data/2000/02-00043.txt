(From M.R. Kale)

This sloka is spoken to Shakara, the villain, by the
judge who's come to inquire into the disappearance of
Vasantasena.

In the notes ("commentary of Prithvidhara enlarged
where necessary"), the first line is explained as "
Your action in impeaching Carudatta is as heinous as
that of an outcast expounding the Vedas, the penalty
for which is the falling off of the tongue".

The series of bad acts in the sloka seems to attract
retribution only from Providence not from the hand of
the law giver. Even the judge, possibly a Brahmin,
seems to acknowldge that.

Is it possible to infer from the tone of the sloka
that sudras ("low born" or whatever prAkRta connotes)
could and did recite the Vedas at the time of this
drama. Perhaps it was only the Brahmins who thought
they viz., the Sudras ("low born") ought not.

Historically is it possible to compare the times of
this drama and the time of specific prescription like
"pour molten lead into the ears" etc..

Appreciate any input in this regard.

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
