Looks like the root (DEDR #3651)
nAr = fibre, string, cord, rope is not finding mention so far.
nAri = bow-strin
nAram = cord.
Ma. nAr; Ko.nar; To. nOr; Ka. nAr, nAri; Kod. narI; Tu. nAru;
Te. nAra, nAri; Kol. nARA, nAra; Go. nAr; Konda. nari.


Sanskrit nAda = sound

and in
Hindi, Bengali .....  etc

nARI = pulse/vein/sinew/nerve
nARA = draw string of pyjamas
nAl = double headed drum

Are these words considered loans from dravidian then ? Is it always possible
to trace words which have widespread use all over India to a certain
language family?
