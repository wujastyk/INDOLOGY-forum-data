Subject: Leprosy in pre-modern India
Message-ID: <161227062995.23782.1926379352677710132.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I would be very interested if any members have information on

1. The incidence or spread of leprosy/vitiligo/syphilis in pre-modern
India.
2. Therapeutic methods for leprosy and other skin diseases - did these
involve mercury, as with syphilis treatment in the Islamic world and
Europe? Also, was the cure of leprosy associated with alchemical
experiments, and thereby with Tantrics and other esoteric groups?
3. Leprosy contraction and cure myths, and any connection with solar
worship.
