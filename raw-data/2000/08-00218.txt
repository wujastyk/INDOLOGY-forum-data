Subject: CSX+ package for LaTeX


Bob Hueckstedt and I have created a package to make it possible to use
CSX+ fonts directly within LaTeX. The package consists of a set of
virtual fonts (my work) implementing CSX+ versions of all the
commonest text fonts, both Computer Modern and PostScript, and a set
of sty and fd files (Bob's work) creating a simple LaTeX interface to
the fonts.

The package will probably eventually find its way on to CTAN, but for
now it can be obtained from
