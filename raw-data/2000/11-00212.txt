Subject: EJVS 6-1: New e-TEXT technologies
Message-ID: <161227063860.23782.17876410071916884598.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

We are pleased to announce that ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF VEDIC STUDIES,
vol. 6, issue 1 (Nov. 2000)  has just been released.

It contains a paper, entitled

Virtual Vidhaana:
E-Textnology (XML and XSL/T) and Vedic Research [1]

by

John Robert Gardner, Ph.D. (in Vedic!, see http://www.vedavid.org )
Architect, Sun Microsystems
Burlington, MA 01803


The use of the new xml-based technology represents a big qualitative step going
beyond simple e-texts and search functions.

While it may seem tough, at first, to install and to learn to use the new
programs  -- especially for Mac users -- they represent cutting edge
technology, a little patience, and some added creative curiousity, will be
rewarded with unprecedented access to our texts.

More on this technology will be presented in J.R. Gardner's new book, now
in press,  "Guide to Transformations using XSLT", that will come out at the
end of the year in the Charles Goldfarb XML series of  Prentice Hall.

The internet version of this issue will be on-line in the next few days. It
will allow easy direct links to software for installing the files necessary
to run the programs described here by J.R. Gardner.

(Other papers, including one on Vedic astronomy, are due shortly).
