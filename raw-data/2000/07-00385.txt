Further thoughts on the mysterious statue: in South India, metal images* of
deities are cast solid, but other figures--donors, ornamental figures
etc--don't have to be.  Your friend can probably check this by eye, or at
least by the weight of the piece.  This would at least give a clue what
*kind* of image this is.

*  generally but not quite accurately called "bronzes", since they're made
of a different alloy of copper.
