Is this not a confusing of two different types of "two-truth theories"?
In the case of Newton and Einstein, the later theory includes the
earlier without declaring the earlier theory false. (This is rather
like the Jaina two-truth theory comprising vavahaara- and
parama.t.tha-.naya, as elaborated by Kundakundaacaarya, which I have
not yet seen mentioned in this discussion.) As I have understood them,
the Advaitin and Madhyamaka theories declare that there is a merely
apparent truth and a real truth, and the former is declared false (cf.
the metaphors of the snake and the rope, etc.).
