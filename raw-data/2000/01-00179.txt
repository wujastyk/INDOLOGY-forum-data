This takes a very narrow view of a much larger complex of data. The view
that Pali represents an (increasingly Sanskritized) eastern dialect is a
not dependent on Girnar alone but on a broad range of phonetical features,
grammatical forms, and on the clear substitution of more western forms for
eastern ones (often retained in verses, well known since Lueders,
Urkanon: thus closer to the Koine the Buddha used in the greater
Bihar area). Unless all these data  can be explained away, no eastern
(Greater Magadha) origin of the Pali Koine.

(see: H. Luders, Beobachtungen uber die Sprache des buddhistischen
Urkanons; aus
dem Nachlass hrsg. von Ernst Waldschmidt.  Berlin, Akademie-Verlag, 1954. )

This view is, to say the least, debatable. See above. For summaries, see O.
