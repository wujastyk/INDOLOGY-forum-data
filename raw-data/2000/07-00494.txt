The AIT theory finally gets some solid support in
India. Not from some daft neurologist like in the case
of the OIT theory but from a belted minister of
education.

The Education Minister of Tamilnadu has made an
original Indological contribution to the raging Aryan
debate, Paleo-Indian writing etc.. He says,

QUOTE

Sanskrit was not around when Tamil was born, the
Minister said, adding that it was introduced in the
country by Aryans when they invaded the sub-continent
500 years after Tamil originated. " No fool will
believe that Tamil was born after the birth of
Sanskrit, " he said, calling Sanskrit a mixture of
various local languages in the north, developed by
Aryans to communicate in writing.

END QUOTE

Evidently, the Hon'ble minister has privileged access
to the original birth certificates of these two
languages.

The Hon'ble minister has definite views on some more
Indological topics. For guaranteed laughter, please
