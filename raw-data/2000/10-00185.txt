Subject: Panchanga calculations in the Agni Purana

Dear list members,

Chapter 122 of the Agni Purana (pages 364 thru 369 of vol. 28 of the Ancient
Indian Tradition and Mythology series, Agni Purana part II)describes a
numeric algorithm for deriving the elements of a Panchanga (tithi,
nakshatra, karana, yoga etc.) can any of the list members tell me if this
agrees with any of the siddhantas or karanas?

Many thanks,

Harry Spier
