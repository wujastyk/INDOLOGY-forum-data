Yes, that is correct. some Kashmiri Muslims follow the anomalous custom of
preserving their Hindu names - Dar, Bhat etc. As a result, their
`conversion' is often doubted by more Orthodox Muslims. It is said that
these persons are converts from the recent 1990s jihad. Those with
authentic Muslim names are said to be the ancestral Kashmiri Muslims.

 But despite that, `Nehru' still does not fall in this category. There are
no Muslim Gandhis and Nehrus. So the Hindutva site
(http://swordoftruth.com) claiming that Pandit Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi
were Muslims is wrong.
