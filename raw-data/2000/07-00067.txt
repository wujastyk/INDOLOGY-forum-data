>?From Atmatattvaviveka, it is clear that Udayana came after Vacaspati Misra
and some post-Sankaran Buddhists like Ratnakirti. Many of his arguments
against the Buddhists end with statements that they should accept advaita
vedAnta positions. In Udayana's opinion, the advaitin theory of the
illusoriness/unreality of the world arises simply because the seeker of
liberation *ignores* the world. And he provides a hierarchical listing of
darSanas, with the vedAnta of Bhaskara occupying a low level, and the
advaita school occupying a level just below nyAya, which is at the top. All
of which suggests that he came after Sankara, not before.
