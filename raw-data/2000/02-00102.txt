The webpage: Sarasvati Sindhu Age at either site contains a book review by
Prof. KV Raman of the monumental work by Prof. Gregory L. Possehl, volume II
in the epic quartet titled: INDUS AGE: THE BEGINNINGS. The brilliant book is
indeed a significant contribution to the study of one of the greatest
civilizations of humankind. Hopefully, the missling links in chronology with
the Proto-European and later Avestan will unravel in due course. Regards. Dr.
S. Kalyanaraman
