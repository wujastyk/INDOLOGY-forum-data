Subject: Role of mind in JainA epistemology
Message-ID: <161227057689.23782.3185321546788211033.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I've a few questions regarding the role of the mind in JainA philosophy :

According to the Jainas the Self is the knower and enjoyer and the
essence of the Self is consciousness. It's said to be coextensive with
the body and that's the reason we know/feel anything that happens
in any part of the body. It's said that perception and knowledge are
the functions of the Self and that the Self and its knowledge are
indistinguishable. Thoughts are supposed to emnate from the Self
and the Self is also supposed to change with the effect of the
thoughts (one other question here is whether thoughts are the result of the
Self being polluted by the karmic particles and when the karmic particles
are wiped clean from the Self and nirvAna is attained, are thoughts supposed
to cease too? Again it is said that even in nirvAna the Self can both
perceive and know.).

So in this scenario when thought/perception/knowledge are said
to be the functions of the Self, what's the role of the mind in JainA
philosophy?

Grateful for any clarifications.
