I don't want to dwell on this too long as it is not directly
Indolological but the dating of the Thera/Santorini is anything but
definite -- it is in itself is a major area of controversy.  The
traditional date is 1500BCE but many also propose 1628BCE based on
tree rings and ice core analyses.   C14 dates on charcoal found in
1979 on site gives a mean date of 1800BCE while some fava beans also
from Akrotiri gave 1700BCE -- more and more C14 dates seem to favour
an older date but all the evidence either way is inconclusive.  I
cannot see why this need falsify Rohl's hypothesis (actually he is not
alone) -- if you are interested, I suggested you have a look at his
book.  It is well laid out and clearly explained and he does try to
answer objections.  I can't see how some of his evidence can be
dismissed -- though you should note that his "revised chronology"
covers two periods -- the Late Dynastic period and the New Kingdom and
they can be treated seperately.   It is also notworthy that some C14
tests done on Tutankhamun material tends to support a later date for
the New Kingdom than the consensus view.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
