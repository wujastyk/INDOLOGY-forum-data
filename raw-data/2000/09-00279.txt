To avoid misunderstandings - the publication mentioned by George
Baumann is Meuthrath's PhD-thesis on the composition of the
NyAyasUtras. The publication I was looking for is however that of her
MA-thesis. As Peter Wyzlic has now kindly informed me, this was published in
1999 in Reinbek : Wezler, 1999, as vol.3 of the series "Philosophica Indica : Einsichten,
Ansichten.
