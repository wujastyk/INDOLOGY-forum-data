I did notice the nose "muktAmaNidhara" in v.61 and was amused.
The text talks of "dramilas'is'u" in v.75. The commentary
(translation of Laksmidhara) speaks of the saivite saint
TirujnAnasambandhara, with a legend.

The rasa description in v.51 mentions eight; s'r^ngAra,
kutsana, rosha, vismaya, bhIta, sarasiruha (vIra),
smerA, karuNA.  The words from the verse.
