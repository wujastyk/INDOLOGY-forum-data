I am not sure that the "pizza effect" is an accurate description.

Actually the aping by AIR is an example of socialist school of thinking that
was in power in India. A school totally incapable of independent thought.

I do not think that it is correct to say that Indians suddenly
became more appreciative of Sanskrit broadcasts. It is just that
the powers that be would not have allowed such a thing and
as usual they had to look over their shoulders to get approval
from outside.

Regards.
