"Indology" List faced this problem many times before in the past. deja vu!

Perhaps, this list readers may be interested to know that Shri/Shrimati
"TW" signs, on one list, so:

                -Tarek (or Tariq)

and on Indology-List signed so:
                tAraka wANi

I wish (s)he maintains some consistency while signing his/her name!
Welcome to the club of NG/SM/VI/KR/...., DG/SC/.... Well, if you are
a long time subscriber to Indology-list or Usenet groups like RMIC,
you 'd know what club it is!
