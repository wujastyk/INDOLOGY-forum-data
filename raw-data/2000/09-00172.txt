Subject: itare.saam - what does it mean?
Message-ID: <161227061610.23782.4155953636300867022.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

itara declines as a pronoun tad, etad, kim, and so on.

Why not read Buhler more carefully? or you studied the sanskrit through
notorious Kochergina's textbook? :-)

Yours Dmitry

PS. By the way, why do u think this rendering is unsatisfactory? Have you
consulted
Yoga-bhashya?
