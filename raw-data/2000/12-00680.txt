The passage to which Richard Mahoney drew attention and on which Martin
Delhey offered very usefull comments is an interesting one. Some further
progress should be possible with its translation. To mention two points
(others could I think be added):

'Holds the opinion of the family of the Buddhas' is rather far from the
Sanskrit. The position of the tu is not very comfortable (to me, but I
have read little of the "Sik.saasamuccaya and am not really familiar with
"Saantideva's prose style). buddhagotraanubhaavaat is of course an
ablative, not another in the string of genitives (as the translation would
seem to suggest). It is because the person belongs to the buddhagotra
(rather than the "sraavakagotra or pratyekabuddhagotra) that he reflects
thus and then should set his mind firmly on (complete) awakening.

The addition of '[then it is said]' is not justified, I should say. The
second verse is not just something 'in quotation marks' but is genuinely
part of the sentence, the main structure of which is tena bodhau kaaryaa
mati.h.

Happy New Year.
