Unless you can give a web site address for people to read this or you can
summarize with sufficient detail, it does not really seem to be a reponse to
the question.

> I posted the above remark on a list for Gaudiya Vaishnava scholars to get
> some feedback.  One of the responders, Swami B.V. Tripurari, invited Mr.
> Gansten to read Krsna-sandarbha. He said, "Don't attack the Gaudiya
> tradition without first reading its philosophical foundation articulated
in
> the Sandarbhas.  If he has read them, and KS in particular on this issue,
> then where is his refutation?"

> Another responder agreed, "Tripurari Maharaja is quite correct. Jiva
Gosvami
> has exhaustively established the Gaudiya understanding of Krsna as the
> Original Personality of Godhead in the Krsna Sandarbha. The arguments are
> found in Anuccheda
> 28-41. Jiva Gosvami compares the verse ete camsa...to a great king who can
> defeat hundreds of enemies (opposing arguments). He then brings in 'the
> multitude of arguments that forms the footsoldiers, calvary, chariot
> warriors and elephant riding warriors of his army.' Whoever wants to
dismiss
> this brilliantly reasoned (and lengthy) response of Jiva Gosvami either
> hasn't read it or is too intimidated to address it."
