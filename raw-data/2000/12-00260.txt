Dear ListFuhrer

I have been on this list only for 15 days or so, and I now know that
only the western 'indologists', their Indian apologists, and people
with vested interests against Indian civilization are welcome to this
list.  I also understand that you people are shocked that the
'objects' of your study seem to have found their tongues and
backbones.

So, before you graciously expel me, I am withdrawing from this list.
I hope others who think like me will also do the same and leave
you to your ivory tower. I know that it makes your life easy in the
short run, but guess what? You guys are already obsolete, and it is
just a matter of time before nature takes its course.

Dont bother with your 'warning' message.

Satish
