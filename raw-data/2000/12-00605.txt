Since Jeffrey Kripal (Kali's Child) has been given academic appointment at
Harvard; his main work concerns a topic historical and Indian, and because
people on this list have expressed extensively their grave concerns at the
pseudo- and even fraudulent "scholarship" that is gaining ground in India, I
think this topic is important to bring up here.  Surely, one's own backyard
is more important than far-away India. Especially if one member or another of
this list might be on Kripal's tenure committee.

Please examine the allegations of mistranslations, faulty scholarship and
even direct lies in Kripal's work at
