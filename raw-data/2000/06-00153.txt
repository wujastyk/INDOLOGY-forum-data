As to my knowledge, Prof. Schlingloff - who is now retired - does not have
an email, and moreover he is not staying in Muenchen anymore. His address
is:



August-Bebel-Str. 2

09526 OLBERNHAU

Germany

To my knowledge Prof. Schlingloff does not have an E-mail address of his

own. But try indology at lrz.uni-muenchen.de to reach his institute.
