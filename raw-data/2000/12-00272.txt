-aNa can be very authoritatively linked to -aNNa as in elder brother.
DEDR # 131:
Ta. aNNan....
Ka. aNNa, aNa = elder brother; respectful address to an older male
Konda. ana elder brother;

The aN- words for elder brother are derived from the Drav. root aN = upper
DEDR #110:

Ta. aNNal = great person; aNNam = palate, roof of mouth;
aNNavi = teacher, director of theatrical performances.
Ka. aNNe, aNNa, aNa = excellence, purity


It is interesting to see from DEDR entries that onlyt Kannada seems
to drop one of the double Ns.

A cursory look at the c-initial entries of DEDR shows that there
are so many entries that have s- for non-Tamil languages.
example:
DER #2464:
Ta. cAri = time, turn
Ma. sAri = id.
Ka. sAri, sAre = id.
Te. sAri = id., repetition, occasion
