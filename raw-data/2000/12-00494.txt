> Mrdaa vaa daaruna vvatha vastrenaapyatha carmanaa|
> Loharatnaih krtam va'pi pustam ityavidhiiyate ||
>
> 'It is called Pusta and is made of clay, wood, cloth, leather, iron
> (and metals) or valuable stones'.

> This indicates that leather was not the only material and it is a

> Pusta is a sanskritized form of MIA pottha which is attested in Pali
> potthaka (or 'hempen cloth') and Ardhamagadhi potthya potthaga
> 'coarse  cloth'. The source of MIA pottha is OIA pavasta ('covering')
> which is attested in one occurrence in RV: (dve pavaste 10.27.7a).
> The word goes back to Indi-Iranaina, as OP pavasta 'envelope' shows.
> Iranian post and Iranian pottha are therefore cognates.
>
> It appears, therefore that pustaka meant primarily a bundle or bunch
> of written sheets kept under a cover, and later in it came to mean
> manuscript of a book placed between wooden covers and with an overall
> covering of coarse cloth, as it has been done till recently.
>
> OIA pravista developed a double meaning in MIA: (i) covering,
> covering tablet (kilamudra of the Niya documents), and (ii) coarse
> cloth (used in covering). Both the meanings are there in 'pustaka'
> and the second meaning obtains in MIA pottha and in NIA (Bengali)
> pota 'coarse cloth used as covering'. It has also given rise to a
> verb 'pota' 'to put underground, to plant'. There is a ghost word
> 'prothita' used frequently in Bengali Sadhubhasha. There is no such
> root in Sanskrit.  There are however two homophonic roots in OIA,
> pruth and proth; pruth (to plant, neigh, snort) occurs in Rigveda;
> proth* (to match for, withstand, overpower, destroy) oconfined to the
> dhatupathas. These toots have nothing to do with the pseudo-Sanskrit
> prothita.
