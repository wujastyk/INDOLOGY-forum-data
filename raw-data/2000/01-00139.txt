I think we have to be more precise. Of the names cited above which are
primarily place names and which are primarily language names? In other words,
we should eliminate those cases where the name of people is derived from the
place name. In the case of Tamil, the language name is primary and the place
name and the people's name are derived names.

Did the European monarchs stop at the limits of their linguistic regions?
Didn't any European state have people speaking different languages in them?

Did the European monarchs contract marriages within the linguistic group
"representing" their own state?

What is the basis for this statement?  Classical Tamil tradition makes no
such varna/jAti distinctions among the eating and drinking of soldiers.

Was there such an European state?

What is the approximate percentage Gupt has in mind when he says  "most"? If
indeed Indians had this extraordinary multi-lingual ability, how come even
after more than a century of English as the official language, English is
understood by only 2.5% according to Gupt? What is the percentage of the
speakers of the Hindi dialects/languages who understand a Dravidian language?
