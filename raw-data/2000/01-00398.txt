Perhaps Madhav should start a site called www.pandit.com. (I believe the URL
is available.) Then gurus around the world can post their wish lists, a la
Amazon and other e-commerce sites. For example:

"Mangoes always accepted; other fruits only in season."

"Pens! Pens! Pens! Always pens! I have enough pens. (However, refills gladly
accepted.)"

"Remember, a rupee isn't what it used to be. Paise will result in a terrible
curse."

"No pre-addressed havaii patras. (However, please write regularly to me.)"

Such straight talk would certainly save their students much angst and soul
searching, and save the gurus trips to the shop to exchange unwanted gifts.
