Dear list members,

A few weeks ago I came across a reference on the internet to a book called
"Additions to Bloomfields Vedic Concordance" but unfortunately I didn't take
any notes at the time and now I can no longer remember where I saw the
reference or find it again.  I also don't see the book listed on the Library
of Congress on-line catalogue.  Is anyone familiar with the book and can
give me the bibliographic reference and any other information about it
(contents, reliability etc.).

Many thanks,
