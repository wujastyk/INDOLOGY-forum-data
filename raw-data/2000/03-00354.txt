In the Tamil Jain tradition, arukan2/arukakkaTavuL, the Jain divinity, is 
supposed to have walked on the flower. It is seen in the cilappatikAram line 
forming part of a arukakkaTavuL nAmAvali 

malar micai naTantOn2 malar aTi allatu (cil. 10.204)

The section also praises arukan2 as eNkuNan2 (one of eight guNas) and 
pakavan2.
