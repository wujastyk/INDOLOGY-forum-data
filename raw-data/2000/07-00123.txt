The Madras University Tamil Lexicon groups the meaning of 'monkey' for kuraGku
in an entry based on the sense of curvature.
There is a verb "kuragku" meaning "to bend/curve" derived from the root kur-
for curvarure; other words in the sense of curl from the same root are kuruL,
kural etc.
[Cf. English crook, curl, curve etc.]
