In first line, I can think of the following two, excellant, German
works:

Falk, Harry: Bruderscahft und Wurfelspiel - Untersuchungen zur
Entwicklungsgeschichte des vedischen Opfers,
Freiburg, 1986

Lueders, Heinrich: Das W?rfelspiel im alten Indien, 
Kraus, Nendeln, 1970 (Repr.)

IIRC, Heesterman only refers to, but doesn't offer 'lengthy' discussion on
Dice Game in his monograph: The ancient Indian royal consecration - the
*raajasuuya* described according to the Yajus texts and annotations.

P.S. Ronald Inden's essay on Kingship in: Kingship and authority in south
Asia (Ed.: JF Richards, 1981, theres a recent reprint too?) 'd be of
interest to you.

P.P.S. I also have seen a discussion on same in Shulman & Handelman's
recent work: God inside out: Siva's game of dice (OUP, 1997).
