<<I'm surprised no one has mentioned the Tamil legend of Siva disguising

himself as a vaiSya woman and breast-feeding a child, thereby becoming a

mother. Hence he is called tAyumAnavar (he who also became a mother),
Sanskritized as mAtRbhUta. There is a temple in Trichy dedicated to Siva
as
mAtRbhUteSvara.

Interesting. Can you direct me to the texual source (preferably along
with translated edition) of this myth?
Thanking you in anticipation.

Vidya
