Thanks for your excellent point.

kaNNan as well as nArAyaNan mean "Black".
For nArAyaNan, sangam literature has
"mAlOn" or "mAyavan" (< mA ='black').

iLaGkO aTikaL in his cilappatikAram (and M. S. Subbulakshmi) sings:
kariyavan2ai kANAta kaN en2n2a kaNNE !
...
nArAyaNA en2n2A nA en2n2a nAvE !

Best wishes,
V. Iyer
