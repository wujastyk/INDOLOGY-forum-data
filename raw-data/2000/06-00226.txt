I suspect that Max M?ller gave the name *MokSa-M?lara-BhaTTa* 
to himself.

M?ller*s four volume Rgveda with S?yaNa, the second edition
of 1890, is available to me in a reprint from Krishnadas Academy,
Varanasi, 1983.

Immediately preceding the Sanskrit text there is the following
Sanskrit title page that does not look like it has been changed
in the reprint. (Perhaps someone can check with the original prints
of the first and second editions.)
