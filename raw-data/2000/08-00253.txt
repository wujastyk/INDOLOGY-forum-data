Dear Friends,

Re.  THE KANCHI SHANKARA MUTT AND TANJORE MODI DOCUMENTS:

There are about 59 Documents (modi manuscripts translated into Tamil and
note books containing hints in Tamil pertaining to those records) in the
Thanjavur Maharaja Serfoji?s Saraswathi Mahaal Library.

During 1984, The Tamil University,Tanjore published a book in Tamil on the
?Administration and Social Life under the Maratha Rulers of Thanjavur?,
with the help of these documents.

The Saraswathi Mahaal Library had also been published two volumes (?Modi
Palakani?) containing the copies of these Documents.

We could find a lot of information/references about the various Mutts and
the Ascetics from them.

The Modi manuscripts related to the Kanchi Shankara Mutt belong to the
period between 1786-1863AD.

01. Doc.No.21-6,20-38,3-45and 4-286

?..H.H.Sankarachary was paid annually large sums of money for the conduct
of worship of Chandramouleeswar and of the Vyasa Pooja in the solar month
of Ashada.This grant continued perhaps upto 1798AD?


02.Doc. Nos.1-312,4-30,5-6,9-37 etc., mention about the kanakabhishekams
performed by the tanjore King to the Shankaracharyas of Kanchi  between
1801-1850AD.


03.Doc.No.4-74 to 85

?
During the reign of  Prathapa Simha (1739-1763AD) the head of Kanchi
Peetam, while he was camping at Udayar Palayam, was induced to go to
Thanjavur.The Pontiff, who wanted to reside at some place on the banks of
the Kaveri, preferred to reside at Kumbhakonam.Thereupon the Rajah built a
mutt for him at the Dabir Agraharam, gifted him with inam lands,utensils of
silver and gold,jewels,horses and elephants.?


The Ahobhila Mutt,Big Mutt,Sircar Mutt,Meruswami Mutt,Siva pooja
Mutt,Goswami Mutt,Uttaradhi Mutt,Vyasaraya Mutt,Dharmapuram and
Thiruvavaduthurai Mutt were some of the other Mutts known to us from the
Modi records.

I invite the list members to share their views on the subject..

Thanks
BGS
