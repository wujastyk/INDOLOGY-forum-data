That myth should be exploded. Last I heard, that horse was dead and gone 15
million years ago.

Whatever earlier Indologists might have thought, they cannot be accused for
not knowing recent genetics. (Cow worship by Rgvedic people??? Where, by
Indra,  does that come from?)

>Also, the steppe is really not suitable for cattle herders

So why do we have the (early) 300,000 horses (their bones) at Botai,
Kazakhstan? And cattle are of course found all over the steppes, from the
Ukraine eastwards, from at least c. 4000 BCE onwards. They did not go there
of their own volition. How to keep them during winter is another problem.

How long do we have to endure such statements as the one above??

> Goats, sheep, camels, etc. are the

You forget half-asses and real asses.
