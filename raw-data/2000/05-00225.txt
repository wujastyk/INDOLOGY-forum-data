I've been following the discussion of Vidyaranya, Shringeri, and
Shankaracharyas with some interest, and would like to urge someone, either
for or post Ph. D., to take on a serious comparative study of the histories
of the Shringeri and Kanchi pithas (and their rivalry), using both textual
resources and on the ground interviews.  William Cenkner made a start at
this, but there is much more to do.  All this would mean is some mastery of
Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada, interviewing skills, and about five years of one's
life!  It would also be interesting to compare and contrast the current
audiences for the Shankaracharyas (and compare them both with Ramana
Maharshi's devotees).  Does anyone know of someone working on some aspect of
this?  Best, Andy Fort
