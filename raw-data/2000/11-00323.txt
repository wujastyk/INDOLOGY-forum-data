I seem to have touched a raw nerve in you and you make unwarranted
statements about the lengths of my posts, knowledge,etc. However, you don't
deny that Tamils use the word 'karuppargal'for Africans. Collectively, they
don't use the term for themselves, even though some people are
named 'karuppan', etc. Just as there are white people named Mr.Black or
Nigel (from Latin  nigre meaning black) does not mean there has been no
anti-black racism among whites.

I have seen an election poster attacking Kamaraj as Apprikka azhage in
front of Mambalam station when he was alive in 1965. Who was fighting to
defeat Kamaraj in 65 and putting up poters against him ? I have heard Tamil
people use this word in a snide way.

This is your backhanded way of accepting what I am saying !!

But we don't know the social reality of Kamban's days. You cannot assume
the colour consciousness during Kamban's days by reading Kamban alone Even
Bharathi wrote 'Kariyavanai kanada kan enna kanne', that does not mean you
can deny the social reality of anti-black discrimination in the 20th
century.

You raw nerves make you  unwarranted accusations against me. Under the
cloak of "scholarly insight" i.e. texts or to be precise the involved
interpretation of the texts, you somehow want to push the everyday reality
under the rug. When I expose the anti-black sentiments in the Tamil
society, you think we should read only texts and nothing beyond it
I have seen the posters attacking Mr.Pandiyan, the ex-speaker of TN
assembly as "karuppu bhoothame", which behaviour in many other countries
would have landed those behind the poster in jail. This was about 12 years
back.
