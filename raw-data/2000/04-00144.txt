UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

BODLEIAN LIBRARY

DEPARTMENT OF ORIENTAL COLLECTIONS

ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN (TIBETAN AND HIMALAYAN STUDIES) (fixed term)
ACADEMIC-RELATED GRADE AR3, Salary scale: ?25,452 - ?30,065


Applications are invited for a temporary post of Assistant Librarian with
responsibility for Tibetan and Himalayan collections in the Bodleian Library.
The post is full-time for five years, with a possibility of subsequent
extension, but not necessarily on a full-time basis.  It is available from 1
October 2000, or as soon as possible thereafter.

This is a new post, funded through the generosity of the Michael Aris Memorial
Trust for Tibetan and Himalayan Studies, that will provide library support for
the development of teaching and research in Tibetan and Himalayan studies at
Oxford. The post-holder will be expected to liaise closely with relevant
academic and library staff in Oxford.

The central Bodleian collections already include a significant number of
printed
books and manuscripts in Tibetan, and on Tibetan and Himalayan studies. The
post-holder will be responsible for developing these into a comprehensive
teaching and research collection of library materials on Tibetan and Himalayan
studies and will be expected to catalogue all Tibetan language materials and
carry out other duties relating to the Tibetan collections as well as some
general departmental duties.

Applicants should have a sound knowledge of classical and modern Tibetan. Some
knowledge of Sanskrit and basic skills in modern Chinese are highly desirable,
as is  some library experience, preferably in an academic library. Excellent
communication and interpersonal skills, including the ability to communicate
effectively in written and spoken English, are required, as are good and proven
IT skills.  Applicants should be enthusiastic, self-motivated and flexible.

The closing date for applications is 20 May 2000.

It is anticipated that interviews, which will take place in Oxford, will be
held
in the first half of July 2000.
