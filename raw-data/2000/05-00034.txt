In this connection: some years ago I read in some late Vedic text (Sutra?)
a passage quoting the beginning of "the Purana":   Manur vai raajaassiid...
making Manu not only our ancestor but also the first king (of himself & his
family...)

But, I failed to take a note, and cannot find the pasage now in any of the
available indices.
(Vishva Bandhu's Sutra index is not complete). Has anyone seen this? Or am
I dreaming?

Any hint would be greatly appreciated.
