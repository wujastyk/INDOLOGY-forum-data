There are many that have who have a quite different interpretation that
what you give.  True that some of the ideas found in the Gita are found
in the Upanishads, and Buddhists and Jainas certainly had their own
ideas about enlightenment.

However, to say that Krisna is not introducing a new concept in the Gita
is something I can't agree with and I have read the book.

Where do you read that transmigration is seen only as an endless cycle
without regard to karma?  Sounds totally novel to me.
