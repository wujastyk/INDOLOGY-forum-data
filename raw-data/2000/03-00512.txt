Evidence of an "Aryan" invasion of China is  astronomically less than
that concerning a similar invasion of India.

I don't think even in most Eurocentric circles is this accepted.

Also, the connection of IVC with the Chinese script is a little
far-fetched since we really don't know what Harappan symbols represent.
As there are tens of thousands of Chinese characters and quite a few
Harappan characters there is bound to be some vague similarity here and
there.

If there really was a connection might we not use the Chinese radicals
to figure out the Harappan script?
