A brief article by Claudius Nenninger, which seems not to have been
referred to in the responses to the original question, might just possibly
have some additional references or be useful in another way. It is called
`Wie kommt die Pharaonsratte zu den vedischen G\"ottern?', and was
published in Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik 18 (1993), pp. 161--168.
