This should have turned up on OCLC, which shows the US has 4 copies,
at Berkeley, Chicago, Harvard, and Cleveland Public.  The Library of
Congress has a copy which for some reason does not show up on OCLC,
but it is non-circulating because it has notes by Albrecht Weber.  The
OCLC number for the title 6347138.
