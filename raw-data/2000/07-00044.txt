It is not a coincidence that Calcutta and Calicut sound so similar. The
original settlement in Calcutta came up at a village called Sutanati, but
the new town was named after Kolkata, which would remind Europe of Calicut
already known through Portuguese trade. Note that Kolkata and Kalighat were
two distinct localities in the pre-Calcutta days.
