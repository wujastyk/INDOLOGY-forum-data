Dear Listers,

It is common among Dravidianists to have scientific training:
V. S. Rajam is a mathematician who works in computer industry nowadays
wrote her dissertation comparing the two old grammars, the Tamil
Tolkappiyam with Paniniyam. Peter Granda, David McAlpin, ...
have moved to fields requiring scientific/computer/mgmt. skills.
W.H.R. Rivers who studied ethnic Todas in the Nilgiri mountains
who speak a Dravidian language is an M.D. A pioneer in neurophysiology
psychiatry and so on. Jean Filliozat was an M.D., and so on.

Interested in knowing about Indologists who had/have a
scientific background & many thanks,
SM
