I am interested in various meanings of "aalambana".
Monier-Williams gives as one of possible renderings:

aalambana 153.2 the natural and necessary connection of a sensation
with the cause which excites it (Saahitya-Darpa.na)

This meaning is the same as used in Yoga-Suutra (at least, as I understand
it).

How close to this meaning is the use of "aalambana" in aalambana-parik.sa?

Best regards, Dmitri.
