I'm surprised no one has mentioned the Tamil legend of Siva disguising
himself as a vaiSya woman and breast-feeding a child, thereby becoming a
mother. Hence he is called tAyumAnavar (he who also became a mother),
Sanskritized as mAtRbhUta. There is a temple in Trichy dedicated to Siva as
mAtRbhUteSvara.
