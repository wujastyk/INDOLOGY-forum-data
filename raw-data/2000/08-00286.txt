History of Mughalstan

 History reveals that South Asia has consisted of several well-defined
distinct ethnic core regions, each with its own language, script, culture
and ethnicity. The core regions of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra are
noteable examples which have existed since the early centuries AD. As
noted by Gandasa, South Asia is more like a continent than a monolithic
nation, consisting of distinct nations. Perhaps one of the latest to
evolve was the Muslim-dominated Indus-Ganges subregion; it is proposed
that this subregion be called Mughalstan. Ever since Bhaktiyar Khilji
conquered Bihar and Bengal, the Indus-Ganges valley appears to have formed
one single distinct nation with its own language (Urdu), ethnic group
(Mughals) and culture. For most of the Delhi Sultanate, Mughalstan was one
united region, and the conquest of South India can be compared to the
extension of the French Empire into Germany under Napoleon. Likewise, the
core of the Indo-Tinurid Empire was Mughalstan, whilst other ethnic core
regions were ruled as tributary states rather than as part of Mughalstan.
Thus, from the Delhi Sultanate to the Indo-Timurieds, Mughalstan formed
one nation. The distinct culture of the conquered regions appears to have
been respected. Thus, a vibrant Dravidian civilization survived in the
South even during Mughal rule.
