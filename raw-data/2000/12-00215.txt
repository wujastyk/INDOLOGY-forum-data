Given the past discussions about appointment to academic bodies, I hope
that this is not too far offline.

What would the list members say if a person who does not know Sanskrit
(say, in the weak sense of reading a page in 15-20 minutes) is
(hypothetically) appointed as the vice-chancelor (comparable to provost in
sone US universities) of something named ``... Sanskrit University''?
