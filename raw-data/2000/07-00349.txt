Many Indian philosophical texts have a liking for similes and

I read have a great number of these.  Some are well-known stock
similes but others are more unusual.   I was wondering if anybody has
researched or compiled a list of such similes ?

Best wishes,

The only book of its kind, as far as I know, is the "LaukikanyAyAJjaliH: A
Handful of Popular maxims current in Saskrit Literature", in three parts, by
G.A. Jacob.

The three-volume[four parts]Bengali language "BhAratIya darzana koSa" by
Srimohan Bhattacharya and Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya deals with most of the
similes and metaphors [the nyAyas]in the relevant sections.

Best wishes.
