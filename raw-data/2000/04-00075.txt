here we go again.... where does all the following come from?

???
Is Skt. hRdaya = Maharastri  hiaa??  And maybe I write Pidgin here?

Nogat, mi i-tokim na i-raitim Inglis (tok bilong bikpela soldia bilong balus).
Plis, stopim kranki toksave!

The "northern" language is known, even in the Vedic texts, as especially good.

>That is why the Buddhists in Gandhar used sanskrit (or
>a sanskrit-like) language instead of Pali.

Nope.  They used Gandhari, a Prakrit much further 'down the road' towards
New Indo-Aryan than Pali.

>This is just like
>khari boli being the standard dialect of Hindi today.

???

>Use of Sanskrit lingered on in NW India for quite some time, and

No. Gandhari Prakrit was used first in inscriptions! See G. Fussman's long
paper  in C. Caillat, Dialectes dans les litteratures indiennes, Paris 1989

Sanskrit was only used *later on*. And then survived the even transition to
Islam in Kashmir in the 14th century by c. 100 years, when finally king
Zain ul Abidin, son of a Hindu mother and in general very friendly towards
the Kashmiri Hindus,  made Persian the official language at c. 1420 CE.

>The kafirs (culturally extinct now),

Nope. the Kalasha (in Pakistan) not yet, but the Afghani Kafirs, after the
Muslim conquest out of Kabul,  a hundred years ago...

>specially the Kalash, who
>were isolated in valleys,

they still are, in Chitral,  and their temples & figures & rituals survive,
in Pakistani Chitral...

> even now use words that are remarkably
>close to pure Sanskrit.

That is overdone... Kafiri (Nuristani) is not Sanskrit, just has some
conservative forms (such as gram for 'village'),  and:
since Nuristani is the third subfamily, next to Iranian and Indo-Aryan,
of Indo-Iranian, it differs from both and has preserved e.g. a sound (.c.
in du.c. '10') that is lost as early as in Vedic Skt. (daza) and Old
Iranian (dasa)...

> They have only recently given up their
>original faith for Islam (or Christianity in a few cases).

Nope, that's the Afghani Kafirs. Not the Kalasha  in Chitral.

>Their valleys are not too far away from Shalatur, where Panini lived.
