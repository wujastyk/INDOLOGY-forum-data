Subject: white as unblemish
Message-ID: <161227065050.23782.3594177737750803179.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

White is not so much colour of mourning as of unblemish.Widows wear white
not because they are in mourning.They are asked to wear white so that they
remain  unblemished.Any stain on white will show immediately. Because of
this association, married women are forbidden to wear pure white.
