Yes : he transmitted a letter by Dr. Elst who writes instead of Dr.
Rajaram, who tells (some of) us that he is too busy translating the Indus
seals. Of course, we can only *invite* him to defend his "decipherment"
himself on this list, and not via-via:   He *does* have email, vide:

Rajaram finds time, though, to write elaborate, ---how shall we phrase it
politely--- elaborate denouncements of virtually anything in Indian/South
Asian Studies/Indology that does not come from an *Indian* pen or keyboard.
The insulting quote given a few days ago is just a small specimen. I invite
members to read his effusions on the (generally rather poisonous)   website
: The Sword of Truth":

http://www.swordoftruth.com/
Read some of their news, commentary, between the lines, and very revealing,
their POLLs!! With regard to Indology proper,  read Rajaram himself:

>When I decided to forward Dr. Elst's message, who was so anxious to sign off,
>I knew the risk I was running in being a forwarder/emissary.

Simple question? Why did Elst not send a last message himself? Why some
much via-via??

PS: I just see that he has bothered to briefly rejoin us....
