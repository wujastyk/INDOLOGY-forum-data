Hello,
Aasti is of Sanskrit origin as noted in these discussions.Remember Panini's
sutra Asti nasti disshtam matih(4/4/60). Aasti is used in Malayalam to
denote asset as against liability for which the word is Baadhyataa. In
writing
accounts  both Aasti and Baadhyataa are widely used in Malayalam in the
meaning respectively of asset and liability.
