Dear list members,

I am looking for Whitney's translation of the Taittiriya Pratisakhya which
is now out-of-print.  Some bookdealers have it listed but when I check it is
out of stock (There is a new reprint listed on the internet but it is for
$150.00 !).  If any of the list members have a copy they would like to sell
then please let me know.

Many thanks,



Harry Spier
