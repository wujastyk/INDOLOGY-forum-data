Dear List-members,

I am looking for a copy of Apizali-zikSA.  It was apparently published
once in 1934 in the short-lived Journal of Vedic Studies (Lahore) by
Raghu Vira.  Unfortunately our library (or any UC library for that
matter) does not have this volume.  Does anyone know if this zikSA has
been published elsewhere?

Thanks in advance,
Chandan
