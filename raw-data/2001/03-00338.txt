Oh, but there were!
It's just that the technology was lost by the time of the BrAhmaNas.
However, "The Cybernetic Code of the RomVeda" requires of an astute
researcher not burdened by decades of boring linguistic scholarship.
Surely, someone will rise up to the challenge soon enough.
In the meantime, here are a few hints:
The technology is attributed to Siddhi RAma, "The Rama of Fantastic Powers"
(not to be confused with Parazu RAma, who came much, much later).
It was esoterically known as "siddhiH om" which, thanks to sandhi, becomes
"siddhir om." When repeated correctly, siddhir om, siddhirom, siddhirom, it
granted the reciter the hidden powers (siddhis) to burn the disk.
The modern term, Compact Disk, is nothing but a confused, garbled reading
of modern Indologists. The original name, here restored for the first time,
is KampakathA Dezika, "The Master of Trembling Tales" (the reason for such
a name remains obscure).

What do you think ViSNu's discus -his cakra- "really" represents?

Best,
