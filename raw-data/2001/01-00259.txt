The manuscript-based reasons for choosing the reading 'kaLiRu peRu valci'
in naR.310 have been stated already in the earlier post.

These are irrelevant to the present discussion involving the bards. Or
according to Ganesan, were the life and status of CT bards equivalent to that
of the post-CT brahmins and poets?

This is most likely a post-CT poem. What is being offered to the brahmins
here is a gold cow with a gold calf and not a single real live calf.  Clearly this looks like a hiraNyagarbha ceremony. Is this brahminic ceremony a justifiable evidence for building the case for the bard receiving a calf, skinning it, and using the leather for making a drum? In any case, we are not
seeking the justification for the reading "kaRRA peRu valci"  but rather
"kan2Ru peRu valci".

Apart from the objections raised earlier, this kind of justification is anachronistic.  Also, there is no evidence of a bard requesting a calf as a gift. But I have already given examples of bards seeking elephants as gifts. Even by this logic, kan2Ru  is not a winner, but kaLiRu is.
