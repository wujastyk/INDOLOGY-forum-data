In his commentary Baalabodhinii on Mamma.ta's Kaavyaprakaaza (7th reprint,
1965, p. 557), Vaamanaacaarya Jha.lkiikar cites a passage "agnir iva
raaja.h" to illustrate the function of the so-called iva-samaasa.  In his
argument, not only is agnir-iva a compound, the bigger compound is
inclusive of -raaja.h as well, and this accounts for the a-stem treatment
of raaja.h with the Paninian samaasaanta affix -.tac (Panini:
raajaaha.hsakhibhya.s .tac).  I have looked all over for the source of the
passage agnir iva raaja.h with Vedic indices etc. without success.  Any
further insight on the passage is welcome.  Best,
