Sorry, I perhaps I did not express myself well enough.   What happened
under Ataturk was a very harsh and destructive repression of religious
beliefs and practices.  One must also remember that, for example, the
Mevlevi religious practice of Sema ("whirling") was still, technically
speaking, illegal at least until the 80s.  According to my Turkish
Sufi friends, there was virtually a blanket ban on all Sufi texts
being published afresh and none could be reprinted in banned Arabic
script -- all that would have been available in pre-war years were old
Ottoman lithographic copies or manuscripts in Arabic script and access
to these diminished as each new generation grew up who could not read
the old script which is far harder to master than Nagari as it does
not represent Turkish very well.   Hence, supposing the situation in
India had been similar under the British -- a new script but no
publication permitted of most old religio-philosophical texts in
transliteration.

Best wishes,
