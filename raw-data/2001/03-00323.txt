Subject: Hindu holocaust site?
Message-ID: <161227068619.23782.15009992069942945125.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have come across a horrendously communal website called the Hindu
Holocaust Museum which, I think, is run by some RSS-BJP thugs. However, I
don't think that is the same one you are looking for. In any case, the URL
for this is www.mantra.com/holocaust/
