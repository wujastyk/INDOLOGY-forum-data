I have briefly discussed this question in the Introduction to my
translation of The UpaniSads (Penguin India, 2000), pp. xiii-xv--see
references given there.  To summarize: I think they are not, but some
others, notably J. Bronckhorst (The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient
India, Franz Steiner, Stuttgart, 1986, pp. 112-3), think they are.
