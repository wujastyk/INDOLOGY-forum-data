vaNakkam.

though  i do not post most often, i read the mails here with avid
interest.  it is  a learning  experience for  me about  a lot  of
matters,  that i  did  not get  to  learn in  my  school. some  i
understand,  some i  dont. but i hope this will certainly make me
more aware of the topics.

i  sometimes wonder  why the list moderator suddenly posts a mail
to  stop  the further discussion  about a topic/thread. of course
there are many more topics to discuss but perhaps a thread should
be allowed to die its own natural end than forcibly stop it.

i  thought  the mail from  SameerAbbas must get a strong rebuttal
but  reading the  moderator's request to stop that thread as well
as  a good  description of  abbas' earlier  mails from  aditya, i
shall  be ignoring  the future  mails from  sammer like  i ignore
rohan oberoi's emails on all other forums !!!!!!!

a  general  perception  one  gets  from  reading  newspapers,
e-newspapers, internet  sites, & the other mass media is that a
lot  of  western  influenced  stuff  gets  imposed  about  india,
hinduism  and  hindus. sadly, most of it is negative and
stereo-typed.

this  is an idealogical  war of the minds.
while  western  positive contribution must be acknowledged, their
negative influence must be strongly condemned. this should not be
taken  as  an attack on  the western scholars, for the underlying
stuff  being questioned is the influence of the mind/thoughts and
not the person.
