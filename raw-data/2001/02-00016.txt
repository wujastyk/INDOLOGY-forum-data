Urdu was as elitist as Sanskrit during muslim rule since it contained words
from Farsi that was language of the rulers. It unfortunately became a symbol
of Islam in India and Pakistan. It is not the language of masses in either
country and one of the reasons for separation of Bangladesh was the
imposition of Urdu as the official language of Pakistan.
Except Pakistan and India muslims use the local language regardless of their
religion. At one time English was also associated with the language of the
British rulers but somehow it got de linked with the Raj but even to this
day the English written in India is still the British version when the rest
of the world and internet uses the American version.

Have a peaceful and joyous day.
