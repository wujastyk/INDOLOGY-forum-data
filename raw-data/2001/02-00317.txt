In fact, a very powerful evidence can be
presented regarding the status of funerary priests.
Consider an excerpt from puR.93 and its translation
by Hart and Heifetz given below.

            pITu il man2n2ar
            nOy pAl viLinta yAkkai tazIi
            kAtal maRantu avar tItu maruGku aRumAr
            aRam puri koLkai nAn2maRai mutalvar
            tiRam puri pacu pul parappin2ar kiTappi
            maRam kantu Aka nal amar vIznta
            nIL kazal maRavar celvuzi celka en2a
            vAL pOzntu aTakkal um uyntan2ar mAtO
            (puR.93.4-11)


    Kings without majesty, they evaded what would have been done
  had their deaths come naturally, of sickness, and their bodies taken
  to be laid out on ever green grass of the finest kind by Brahmins
  schooled in the Four Vedas and the principles of Righteousness,
  who would have then chanted, "Go to where the great warriors go!
  those who wear their splendid war anklets, those who have died
  in a good battle and kept faith in their manhood!" and forgetting
  any love they may have had for them, they would have then wounded
  the bodies with the sword so as to free them of sin and buried them.

This song by auvaiyAr is interesting for the following
reasons. Brahmins act as funerary priests in a burial. Moreover,
the brahmins cut the body with the sword before burial. (According
to Prof. Michael Witzel, this was not a Vedic custom.) Although Hart
and Heifetz translate the word "pOzntu" as "would have wounded", the
real meaning is ?would have split/cloven open?. This clearly disproves
Hart?s theory of anaGku/pulai being the cause of  low caste status.

In Varanasi, the cremation priests are called mahAbrAhmaNas,
and are considered highly inauspicious because of their dealings with
death. This is a phenomenon found in all of India about the
persons performing cremation or burial rites. Birth=Auspicious/Impure,
Wedding = Auspicious/Pure and Death=Inauspicious/Impure(polluting).
The polarities of Caste society (Louis Dumont calles Indians
Homo Hierarchicus) Pure vs. Polluted is KannaDa maDi/pole,
Tamil maTi/pulai, Telugu madugu/pola, acc. to Indianists.

The question to Indologists is whether in the North,
the brAhmaNas, experts in the Four vedas,
("nAn2maRai mutalvar" acc. to sangam lit.)
participated in sacrifices involving human blood and
intestines in ancient times? Also, did they cut the bodies
of men in half before disposal? In Vedic, Epics??
