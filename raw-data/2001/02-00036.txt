Check out the webpage of the IITS Cologne
<http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/index.e.html>, the IITS-Font
is quite good for transliteration. It's similar to _Times New Roman_ and
if you mix both they look pretty good. 
For Devanagari try _Xdvng_, I also got it from the web, but don't
remember where. I can zip it and mail it to you if you want.
