Subject: posting limits
Message-ID: <161227067696.23782.4756070373625705055.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I remind members of this forum that the recommended upper limit for a
posting is 2k, i.e., one screenful of ASCII text.  And no more than 15
postings per month per person.

I have suspended N Ganesan until the end of March, since he has been
over-posting grossly.
