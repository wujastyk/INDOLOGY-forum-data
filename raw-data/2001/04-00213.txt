Very nice suggestion. No insults, quotes refering to
Indological jls.,/books, (and like Dr. Kochhar's suggestion)
not naming members of the list should curtail violent attacks.

That is to shut down this scholarly forum.

PS: This may be a typo. Do you mean to say:
"methods to *increase* signal to noise ratio"
We want higher signals.
