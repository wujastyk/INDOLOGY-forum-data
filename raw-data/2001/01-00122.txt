Vidyasankar makes a good point.  I have successfully read with my Mac
version of Manjushree CSX the Sanskrit texts created by Professor
Tokunaga.  The same can be read with the Windows version of Manjushree
CSX.  However, I have not tried to read texts created with Mac Manjushree
CSX with any Windows based CSX fonts.  Best,
                                                Madhav Deshpande
