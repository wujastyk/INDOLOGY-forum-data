When there is fire, the first task is to put it out , not discuss how it started.
May I suggest we focus our attention and energies on the problem at hand. More specifically,can we do some thing to save the Bamiyan heritage? If not, can we at least  put our joint concern on record and convey it to some suitable agency?
