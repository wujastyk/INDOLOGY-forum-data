Subject: Metre -- A package for critical editions
Message-ID: <161227069990.23782.3196013188839591743.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear all,

For those of you preparing transliterated critical editions this LaTeX
package may be of interest.

It was posted today to the comp.text.tex newsgroup.

I tracked it down at:

 http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/metre/

The demo.pdf and metre.pdf files show its capability.


Also, I would like to thank all those who helped me the other day with
my query about self-demoting verses. I now have a good number of leads
to follow up.
