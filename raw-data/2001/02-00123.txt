It is not so much a prejudice as it is inaccurate expression on my part.
My rendering would be:

1. adra.s.tu -- that which has produced no impression
2. ad.rzya -- that which cannot be observed

1. means that one tried to see, what the sensory stimulation came from,
   but cannot grasp, or form percept of it.
   The thing to be percieved might be percieved but the subject is
   in such state that no percept is formed.

2. means the  thing to be percieved is out of sight or is invisible,
  so the reason of non-perception is in the thing to-be-percieved, not
  in the state of the subject, like in 1.

Hope it clarifies it.

Best regards,
              Dmitri.
