Subject: Khambesvari puujaa with Buffalo sacrifice
Message-ID: <161227067489.23782.15571207101582469232.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Sambalpuri [language spoken in Western and parts of Southern Orissa, where KhambesvarI is worshipped by the DumAls or DumbAls] the word <puj> means 'to kill'. PUjA has certainly something to do with sacrifice and may be smearing of the sacrificial blood.
