Subject: SV: An article mentionig Indologists
Message-ID: <161227068113.23782.13967373607906139806.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The following site talks about the presence of horses at the Indus site
(claiming that horses were known to inhabitants of the Harappan
civilization) , and also contains a brief critique of Witzel and Farmer:

http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/horse1.htm

S.Kalyanaraman seems to be involved in some way with this site, as a letter
written to him by some archaeologist is published on it.

Would appreciate any comments on this.

>>Dearest Dr. Duran,
>>
>>since you asked publically an opener answer:
>>
>>This "German Romantic Colonialist Missionary Racist Communist" (NS
>>Rajaram), along with his one man cohorts, S. Farmer,  has already debunked
>>N. Jha's and NS. Rajaram's "decipherment" in two articles in the
>>"communist
>>rag" FRONTLINE (Chennai) of Oct. 13, 2000,sqq. and in the equally red
>>OUTLOOK, or so do some Hindutvavaadins say.
>>
>>See all papers  and links at:
>>http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/R&J.htm
>>and also, with subsequent discussion, at:
>>http://www.safarmer.com/frontline/  and
>>http://www.safarmer.com/horseseal/update.html
>>
>>And, please, do not forget to expand your knowledge and check NS Rajaram's
>>pertinent articles in the Indian version of the Voelkische Beobachter,
>>"The
>>Organiser" of Oct. or Nov. 2000  http://www.organiser.org/ (same text as =
>>PRAGNA of Oct. 2000: http://www.pragna.org/Art21001.html  )  and cf. also
>>http://www.organiser.org/21jan2001/cover2.htm  which reveal all the secret
>>reasons, unimaginable to outside observers, for my writing above papers.
>>Actually, also Amartya Sen's!
>>Cf. also The Hindu Research Centre,
>>http://www.hvk.org/articles/1200/124.html
>>
>>Finally, I can assure you that I am as conservative as Rajaram's statement
>>(above) indicates. And certainly,  as Aryan-invaderistic as the evidence
>>will hold, i.e. little or none, so far.
>>Please see my pertinent papers on the issue (via my website
>>http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/mwpage.htm),
>>and watch out for the next and/or the second next issue of EJVS at
>>http://nautilus.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ where most of these never-ending
>>Aryan Questions will be dealt with, Euro-centrically from Massachusetts,
>>and otherwise.
>>
>>Enjoy! Yours, qbsm, The M. Witzel
