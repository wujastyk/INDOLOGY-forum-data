Subject: How long are the  Indus and Brahmaputra (Was re: question)
Message-ID: <161227068201.23782.15932228466532695450.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

That was a very thoughtful message.

On a more flippant note: I thought the Indus kept changing its bed,
thus creating continuous political and military upheaval where
it is considered the political border...

Mathematically, I think one way of doing it would be to decide
on a common resolution (or fractal scale) for both rivers
(assuming that rivers have comparable curving properties),
then vectorize.
I would venture a guess that there is probably a geometrical
standard for this type of resolution, because otherwise relative
geometry would be difficult.

I promise I won't produce any more silly input on this issue...
Yours,
Gunthard
