Dear members of the net:

COMPARATIVE DRAVIDIAN LINGUISTICS: Current Perspectives
Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, University of Hyderabad

This volume is a contribution both to comparative Dravidian studies
and to the theory of language change and lingusitic reconstruction.
It makes available the author's most important published articles on
Dravidian over the last forty years and includes a new and substantial
introduction to the field.  The book concludes with a survey of
Dravidian language studies over the last thousand years and a critical
account of work since 1950.  Those articles reprinted in the work
appear substantially unchanged, with individual comments.

"To have these papers in a single volume will be of the greatest
value.  The result will be virtually a compendium of comparative
Dravidian linguistics such as is nowhere else available.  It will
instantly become a primary reference and tool for students of
Dravidian linguistics everywhere."--Professor William Bright,
University of Colorado

"It is impossible to do serious work in Professor Krishnamurti's
principal chosen field without consulting the books and articles he
has written over a period of four decades.  Almost everything he has
published is original, insightful, and authoritative, and put together
the collection would provide a sort of epitome of the history of the
comparative study of Dravidian languages over the period in
question."--Professor R. E. Asher, University of Edinburgh
