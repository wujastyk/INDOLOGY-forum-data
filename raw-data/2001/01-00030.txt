Dear List members:

I connection to a preface to my ?rendering? of the
_Diamond Cutter Sutra_, might anyone have any
interesting data on the life of Kumarajiva? ?i.e.,
beyond what I have compiled below. Is it the name
alone that makes me think he was ?Indian??

Much obliged,

Ven. Tantra

*Kumarajiva* (CE 344?413). Great Indian (?) Buddhist
scholar and missionary born in Kucha, present day
Xinjiang, China. When his mother, a Kuchean princess,
became a nun, he followed her into monastic life at
the age of seven. He grew up in Buddhist centers. In
383, Chinese forces seized Kucha and took Kumarajiva
