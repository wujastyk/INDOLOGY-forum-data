pANDavAs won bhArata kingdom when they were outnumbered by 18:11. The
pacifism of Buddha emasculated the armies and India lost its identity, and
by the time Sankara brought back gIta it was too late. The invaders already
got enough momentum to maintain technological lead in cannon technology, gun
powder etc. Hopefully gIta will again help in future :-)

Can we have less of euology (for or against Bible, gIta or whatever) and
some more logic?

Best,
Bhadraiah
