The tantrayuktis, which are discussed in Ayurveda but are by no means limited 
to that discipline, provide important guidelines for the interpretation of 
scholarly texts.  You might refer to the Tantrayuktivic?ra of N?lamegha, 
edited by N. E. Muthuswami as volume 1 of Kerala Pras?san?yurvedagrantrh?vali 
(Trivandrum, Government Ayurveda College, 1976).  The 33-page Sanskrit text 
is accompanied by a 42-page appendix with citations from other Sanskrit 
works, and, in English, an 18-page editor?s introduction and a 44-page 
exposition of Tantrayukti by K.R Srikantha Murthy.
