Dear Stephen (pardon my addressing you rather familiarly thus!)

Thank you for the comment about a proposed relationship between the
Sanskrit "MATI", the Avestan "HUMATA" and the Egyptian "MA'AT". It was most
enlightening, to say the very least.

What are your views about the main subject of my message? I would like very
much to hear.

Thank you again

Regards
BCP
