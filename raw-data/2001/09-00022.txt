Subject: Questions on South Asian English
Message-ID: <161227069707.23782.13710709853621828860.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Would a South Asian, particularly a speaker of Urdu, be likely to say
"you peoples" instead of "you people" in addressing a large group of
people, a collectivity?

What would be the most likely spelling in South Asia of the honorific
for a descendant of Mohammad: sheikh, sheykh, shaikh, or shaykh?


Thanks,

Allen
