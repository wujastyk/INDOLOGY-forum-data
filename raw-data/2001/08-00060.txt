Subject: URLs for a Hinduism course
Message-ID: <161227069604.23782.5947565118819680987.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hello Colleagues,

     I am trying to find a good academically appropriate collection of URLs which would be helpful as a
source of information on Hinduism for undergraduate students.  Something that would cover from IE
background and Harappan Civilization to modern times.  Has anyone put together such a collection of
URLs?   Best,

                                               Madhav Deshpande
