I don't have references on hand right now, but British policy, I
believe, replaced Urdu in the Arabic script with Hindi in the Nagari
script around 1881-1882 in Bihar.  That seems to indicate that wide
use of Devanagari (as distinct from use of Devanagari for religious
purposes) significantly postdates the decline of Islamic political
power in northern India.
