Dear Colleagues,

Before the INDOLOGY list closes, let me announce to those of you professionally interested
in the subject that a web site with some basic information about the International
Association of Sanskrit Studies has now been established, thanks to the good offices of
Dominik Wujastyk, to whom I tender my thanks on behalf of the IASS,     as well as sending my
own personal thanks to him for all that he has done to further the cause of Indology through
this list over the years.

The address for the site is  http://iass.findhere.com

(this is in fact an alias for its less memorable true address, which is
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/iasss/).


Yours sincerely

John Brockington
Secretary General of the IASS
