Noted Sri Lankan historian Lorna Srimathie Dewaraja is considered to be by
many to be the ultimate source in the history of the last three Kings of
kandy who were supposedly of Madurai Nayyakar origin.

"Matrimonial Alliances between Tamilnad and the Sinhalese Royal Family
in the 18th Century and the Establishment of a Madurai Dynasty in Kandy"

was presented by her at the Fourth International Tamil Conference Seminar

he says of Lorna's work on kandyan kings

"The first edition was a University of London doctoral dissertation by
L.S. Dewaraja, it was entitled A Study of the Political,
Administrative and Social Structure of the Kandyan Kingdom of.Ceylon,
1707-176a The Second Edition published in 1988 is an expansion of the
first and is entitled The Kandyan Kingdom of Sri Sanka 1707- 1782.
The first edition itself virtually displaced all the earlier writings
as authorities on the subject and had served as an authority for
other scholars to take-off not merely into the history of the period
but also into such inquiries as those with regard to a Sinhala-
Buddhist identity and communal relations at the present day."
