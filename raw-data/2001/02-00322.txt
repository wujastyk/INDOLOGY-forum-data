This shows how the indigenous customs spread into Indo-Aryan culture:
before a group was assimilated, Brahmins would come into it and adopt
those values most admired by that group in order to gain respect. Thus
the custom would have gained a foothold in the Brahminic religion and
would be perpetuated when descendants of the Brahmins wrote
lawbooks or copied texts with the appropriate insertions.
