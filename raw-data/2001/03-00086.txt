I am unable to find the books:

"Indo-Sumerian: a new approach to the problems of the Indus Script" by J V
Kinnier Wilson

and

"The Bronze Age Harappans: A Bio-Anthropological Study of the Skeletons
Discovered at Harappa" by Pratap C. Dutta

Any assistance putting me in the right direction would be greatly
appreciated.

Best Regards,
Michael Korvink
