"karuna.tar" is a variation I have not yet seen! But the Sanskritised 
"kar.naa.ta" seems to have existed already before then, and the 
question 
arises from which source the Cilappatikaaram word has come.

Not many, but they exist: e.g., words in which the first element is  
'kem-' ("red"), such as ken-niiru "red water, blood", ken-nettar "red 
blood", ken-naalige "red tongue". In Kannada the treatment of the 
final 
nasal in such short units of meaning in general seems somewhat 
flexible, 
and this also shows in Old Kannada orthography: e.g., an anusvaara at 
the 
end of a word may stand for an n or m, cf. e.g. Old Kannada manu.sya.m 
=
Modern Kannada  manu.syanu (the modern language demands a euphonic 'u'
at the end, because  final consonants are no longer tolerated), and 
then
the anusvaara turns  into n, as we also see in the accusative: OKa
manu.syana.m (note the n) =  ModKa manu.syanannu.
