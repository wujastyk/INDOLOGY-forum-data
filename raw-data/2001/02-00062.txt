I cannot at all agree with your conclusions. I find it much easier to read
Ghalib's poetry in Devnagri than in Urdu script even though I can read both.
One can reproduce those works on a CD without any need for a  script as most
cinema goers today do not care or know the script in which the dialogs and
lyrics are written. I do not seen any great need to burden every child with
another script just to read a few items. Moreover just because they do not
read Urdu script does not by itself leads to the conclusion that Muslim rule
was just oppression. I think the rule of Akbar was far less oppressive than
many Hindu rulers of his time.

It is OK for scholars, archaeologists and indologists to study ancient
languages but to mandate it to all is no better than mandating Sanskrit or
Pali or Swahili.

Have a peaceful and joyous day.
