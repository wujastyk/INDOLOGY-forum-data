Dear Dr. Preciado,

While agreeing that the Spanish colonialists did introduce a Caste like
system in Latin America, we should still keep in mind that the indigenous
societies of what is today Latin America did have a societies divided along
class, mostly hereditary. I think what Dr. Ganesan is trying to find out is
the about the concept of pollution with respect to the kinds of jobs they
did (by birth) in determining their position in pre-Spanish indigenous
societies specifically with respect to the many Maya groups. I am pretty
sure that there should be relevant literature in this field. Anthropology
journals dedicated to Latin American pre-colonial societies should be of
some help. Thanks
