Sorry for the error. This should read as:

Ka. himmaDi, Ka. himmeTTu, Ta. tImmozi, Ta. mummalam
etc. are not relevant and they do not have any bearing in
the formation of the language name, Kannada.
What is needed is -ann- < -amn- and not -mm- examples.

We can only show Ka. and Tam. assimilation examples in
-e(/i)mn- > -e(/i)nn-. But NOT with -amn- > -ann-.

This mentioned assimilation from -rn-/-run- > -nn- has
direct relevance in the relation between KannaDa and KarnATaka
than what is given below.

The type of assimilation happens in Sanskrit as well,
not just in Tamil.

Thanks for confirmation in Kannada as well. All the above
have to do with assimilation from -rum-/-rm- > -mm-.
Sanskrit and Tamil examples are listed in the URL above.
But, these have nothing to do with -nn- in KannaDa.

R. N's suggestion kam 'fragrant' + nADu is dubious, and no
other examples of this assimilation (C)amn > (C)ann exist in either
Kannada or Tamil.
