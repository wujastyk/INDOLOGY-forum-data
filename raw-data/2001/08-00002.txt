I see the word jo.dia listed in the sense of a hunter in the Jain Prakrit
dictionary AbhidhAnarAjendra (vol. 4, p. 1651).  The other possibly related
word may be jho.ti.mga attested from old to modern Marathi in the sense of
a goblin or a kind of ghost.  This may be related to the Marathi verb
jho.da.ne "to beat, to batter, to whack" and the related word jho.dii in
the sense of a beating, see A Dictionary of Old Marathi, S.G. Tulpule and
Anne Feldhaus, p. 272.  The word jodi.mga may be possibly related to such
Prakrit sources.  I would check other Prakrit sources.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
