For the Sri Lankan caste name, Karava, please consider
the tamil name kaLamar. (More on Jaffna naLavar,
Kannada kaLabaru who were ruling TN their name
sanskritized as Kalabhra, karunATu 'black country'
(Cf nallamalai hills in AP where nalla = black
and river Krishna) ..)

BTW, karaiyar 'shore folk, fisherman' is different from
karavar. In Dravidian, -m-/-v- does not become -y-.
Dravidian makes skt svAmi as sAmi,sAvi, sOvi, sOmi
but not sAyi. Saayi happens in the North India
For example in Bengal gosAyi.

That's why Gowda and foll. him, Emeneau's derivation
of sAyaNa from sAyi utterly fanciful. It is much easier
to get it from Dravidian words.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
