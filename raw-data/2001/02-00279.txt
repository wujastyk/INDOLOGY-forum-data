Suresh,

1. Have you read the Quran?

2. Please define what you mean by 'rationally' and why you reach the bizarre
conclusion that believing in the Quran means foregoing the ability to think
rationally.

3. Whom are 'Muslims' notorious among? Perhaps among communal , prejudiced
people like you. Spare us the offensively communal sentiments please.

Rohit
