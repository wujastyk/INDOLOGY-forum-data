Subject: "Ras Pulo" a Krishna festival
Message-ID: <161227069743.23782.17378357518955942474.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Has anyone heard of "Ras Pulo" as a festival identical with our around
Ras Purnima? A patron has been told that Mirabai was traditionally
born at Ras Pulo.  The patron cannot find this in English biographies
of Mira.  I cannot find it in Hindi dictionaries, though Pulo might be
Pulav, i.e. pilaf.  Is a pilaf a specialty at Ras Purnima anyplace?
