I think Kumarajiva was never in India.

Many translators from Sanskrit in China were Kuchean, Khotanese,
Parthian, Sogdian or  Yueh-chih, but Kumarajiva is best known.

Note that the language of Kucha was Indo-European, even though
the region is in China. Buddhism survived in the region perhaps
until 15th cent.

I'n not sure if the people there were related to the
"Caucasian" mummies found there.

PS: Sanskrit is still taught in China.
