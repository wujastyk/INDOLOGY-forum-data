Surely there was iconoclasm in "classical and medieval India" why
is it not a appropriate topic ?

Is this another example of covering up of any
topic that is uncomfortable to people studying the "Hindoos" ?
It seems that "Hindoos" can be only studied and put under a
microscope subject to guidelines set by Europeans. Data on Hindoos
has to be marshalled only to fit preconceived results.

Uncomfortable historical events of the "Hindoos" can be easily
censored and swept under.

It is probably time for the natives to study the
"indology scholars" themselves to find out their motives.

But then of course, the list owner has complete rights to
censor and select the topic.

Then, however, the claim to openminded scholarship is not valid.

Regards,
Subrahmanya
