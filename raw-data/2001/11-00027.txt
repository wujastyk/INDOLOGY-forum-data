New "Laws of Manu" Website

Dear Friends

I have established a new 'Laws of Manu' website with the following
materials:

A bilingual Devanagari-English text with  the Sanskrit text of  M.YANO and
Y.IKARI
which is based on 'ManusmRti with the Sanskrit Commentary
Manvartha-Muktaavalii of Kulluuka
BhaTTa', ed. J.L.Shastri (1983) and 'The Laws of Manu' translated by George
B?hler (Sacred Books of the East, Volume 25). The text is in both PDF and
Word format.

The devanagari text alone

The English text alone.

Please visit the site at

Yours

McComas
