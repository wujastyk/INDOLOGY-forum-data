Subject: Rani of Jhansi's letters (Re: Devanagari, ..)
Message-ID: <161227068651.23782.6859183969585940732.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have placed images of two letters by Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi
to the Raja of Banpur at

http://malaiya.tripod.com/jhansi.html

I think they are in the hand of some scribe, with the Rani's
stamp. The dialect is Bundelkhandi. They are quite readable,
both the language and the script are fairly modern (1857CE).
Commercial letters can be much harder to read because
of the speed of writing.
