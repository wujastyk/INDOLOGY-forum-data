A question of time scales. Evolution would happen over tens
of thousands of years, but nobody has lived that long. It can
be seen as what is called a quasi-steady state approximation.
There is a long-term time dependence, but this is so slow that
one would not see changes in the short-term.

Also, there is no one universal view of evolution. What people
think about it today is approximately neo-Darwinian evolution,
not strict Darwinism. Some think evolution occurs through
accumulated changes. Others argue for jerky genetic mutations
and sudden breaks in speciation events. A few people are even
reconsidering Lamarckian evolution nowadays. See Science (the
journal), 7 April 2000, p. 38, and 30 Jun 2000, p. 2318.
