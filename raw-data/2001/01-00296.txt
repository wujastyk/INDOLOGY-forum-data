Me newphew who is Belgian, has studied Indology in Leiden (The Netherlands)
and Gent (Belgium) for his undergraduate studies. He wants to continue
studying Indology and also wants to visit South America. Does anyone know of
a University in South America that has a Department in Indology? Your
reactions will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your reply.
Sincerely,
