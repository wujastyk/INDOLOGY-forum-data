I hope I won't disturb Aditya's cheerfulness, or maybe I am a bit
tired and fail to grasp the point, but there are a few things that I
cannot follow, e.g.:

If this is a criterion for being ?litist, then I fear the vast majority of
the world's languages are just that. It is in the nature of languages
to borrow, also from ?lite languages.

No language is.

(a) Muslims in Kerala speak Malayalam, those in Tamilnadu speak
Tamil; (b) what is 'local'? Urdu is basically northwest Indian and
well rooted there, as Rohit Chopra already mentioned. My own
experience is that it is better to speak Urdu in Delhi than Hindi
(i.e., to say ";suruu karanaa" and "istemaal k." rather than
"praarambha karanaa" and "prayoga k."), because everybody
understands the former, irrespective of whether Persian / Arabic
once upon a time was / were ?litist or not. Urdu was not at all local
in East Pakistan, but was local somewhere else, and so much so
that it is not a "Muslim" language there; (c) maybe localness does
not matter so much, as in:

There you go.

More or less; like in Canada or New Zealand. And why not?

Then I do not belong to the rest of the world. :-)

> Have a peaceful and joyous day.

You too. Sorry if there is some kind of misunderstanding in the
above.
