I totally agree with your observation.

I was responding originally to the reference made in Chapter 16 of Gita
about the practices that were ascribed to Asurs and thereby misrepresenting
Asurs.  Obviously writer of Gita should have known better if it was the
omniscient god. Even with the contemptuous tone of the Chapter 16, there are
many admirable qualities of a supposed Asur which can be challenged as being
better than what the writer of Gita considered as virtues.


Have a peaceful and joyous day.
