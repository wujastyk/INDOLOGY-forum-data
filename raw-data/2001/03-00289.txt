What happened between the Prophet of Islam and his wives is nobody's
business. Rushdie's book is trash with four letter word scattered several
times.It is not example of objective thinking but throwing trash
everywhere. Hindus do not go searching drainages of the houses of the other
people. When they enter the house of the other, they visit the little
sanctuary(Devagriha) of the deities in the house.Hindus are trying to
understand Islam through centuries of efforts from Saints like Guru
Nanak,Kabir and Meher Baba.Hindus could discuss the birth of Jesus Christ in
the line of David who was involved in adultry. But they do not do that. They
are trying to understand the meaning of "In Jesus Christ, the God uniquely
reconciled with Himself".Hindus believe that no avatAra takes place without
reason. Hindus are trying to find out the reasons of avatAra of Jesus and
Prophet Mohammad in the ancient history of middle east. Both Makka and Sea
of Galili were holy places thousands of years before the patriarch Abraham
the Hebrew. Whose holy places were these? By knowing their history Hindus
might get the clues for their own prehistory which was messed up by alien
scholars.I am not worried about attacks on Krishna. He will defend himself.
The sun does not need the candle of Wendy to illuminate himself.Thanks.
