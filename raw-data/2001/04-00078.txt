AFTER AIT & NGT, NOW PTT ! After AIT, Saffron researchers are busy
unveiling another `racist Nazi' theory: PTT (Pythagoras Theorem-Theory),
which wrongly gives credit for Pythagoras theorem to Pythagoras :

  "Pythagoras's Theorem was written before he was born, in
   ancient Indian treatises called the Shilpa Sutras.

   http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,3-60856,00.html

 Also, "Electrical energy was not a recent discovery, but was mentioned in
the ancient Vedic texts, along with magnetic and solar energy." and "
Wireless technology was invented by Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, not Marconi"
So, plenty of `racist Euro-centric' theories to take care of: WET (Western
Electrical Theory), MET (Marconi Electrical Theory) etc.
