Two thoughts:
1.  Dominik's plight and frustration reminds me of the following statement by
Vishvamitra (Balakanda: XIX):
"Not long ago, I initiated a major sacrificial ritual. But before I could
complete it, two rakshasas showed up to thwart my effort. They flung raw flesh
and impure blood on my altar. "
The sage recognized the magnitude of the disruptive forces. However, instead of
abandoning the undertaking, he sought the assistance of Rama and Lakshmana, and
succeeded.
I suggest that Dominik follow that illustrious model.

2. The pressures on the Indology group refelct the very stressful times in
which we live. With all their goodwill and effort at objectivity, it is very
difficult for
scholars (of humanistic disciplines) to work in their ivory towers.
Excessive as some of the utterances have been, they were prompted more often by
deep anger and indignation rather than purely sinister motives. This is not to
condone such behavior or to suggest that we cater to it, but to try to
understand it.
