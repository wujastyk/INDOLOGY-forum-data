California, Berkeley, USA

Here is the message from the July forum:

Did Tamil Cankam poetry describe a contemporary society, or an
idealized pure Tamil society of the past, as it was imagined in a
time already greatly influenced by North-Indian Sanskrit culture ... ?

The following recent publication is perhaps of interest to readers of
this list because of the challenging thesis on the relative
chronology of early Tamil poetry and Sanskrit Kaavya defended in it.
