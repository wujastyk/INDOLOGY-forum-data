List members might be interested in the following responses from Jeff Kripal
(who is not a current member of risa-l) concerning the criticisms leveled at
_Kali's Child_. The first, which is more personal and confessional in nature,
is
entitled "Secret Talk : The Politics of Scholarship in Hindu Tantrism," while
the second, "Textuality, Sexuality, and the Future of the Past: A Response to
Swami Tyagananda," is addressed directly to Swami Tyagananda's rebuttal and is
more technical in orientation. Both can be accessed at:
