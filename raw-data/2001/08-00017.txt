        I would consider a PROTO-Chinese connection or Shang dynasty
parallels worthy of discussion, but in NYTimes' 2nd article the accent
is made on the parallels with "not an early script, but one that was
not used until about 200 B.C.", that is a script "practiced in the
Western Han dynasty of 206 B.C. to A.D. 9".
        Probably all this is due to typical journalistic distortion
of scholarly opinions. You are quite right: we shall better wait not
only for new excavations, but also for a regular publication of the
seal in a scholarly magazine and its first scientific interpretations.

                                                                Ya.V.
