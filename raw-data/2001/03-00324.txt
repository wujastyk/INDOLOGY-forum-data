To the best of my knowledge, to this day there is almost 50% American Indian
(Red Indians) tribal population in Spanish and Portuguese America spread
from Mexico to the southernmost tip of the south America continent. This is
not the case with English speaking countries like US, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand. Is it OK to remove the people completely, occupy their
country, change the names and then tender apology. What about Irish Famine
holocaust? What about Vietnamese holocaust caused by 29 million gallons of
Agent Orange Dioxin? Thanks.
