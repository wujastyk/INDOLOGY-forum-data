Dear Steve,
        I think you would find useful the whole chapter on "Gold-Digging Ants"
in Klaus Karttunen's book "India in Early Greek Literature", Helsinki 1989 (Studia
Orientalia, ed. by the Finnish Oriental Society, 65), pp. 171-176, with reference to
Mbh 2, 48.4.
        All the best
                                                Yaroslav.
