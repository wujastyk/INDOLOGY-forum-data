Dear Allen,
Try the Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr at Alto Porvorim, Goa at the address
below.
http://www.goacom.com/tskk/

Perhaps you could also try Francisco Alves, currently at
alvesf at georgetown.edu

On a contemporary vein a Rev. Dr William Barboza had recently worked at the
TSKK to revise his translation of the Konknni Bible prior to publication -
to be put out by the Mangalore Diocese.

I have a feeling that you will find help at the TSKK.
