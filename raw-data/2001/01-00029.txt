G. von Simson already gave some useful references.
The Rg Veda says that the Moon becomes new again and again as it is born:

navo navo bhavati jAyamAnaH, 10.85.19 (repeated in TaittirIya SaMhitA 2.4.14).

See the previous verse (RV 10.85.18) for a comparison with the Sun's
movement. See also: VAjasaneya SaMhitA 23.45-46, and Zatapatha BrAhmaNa
13.2.6.10-11.

I dealt in some detail with the ascending-descending nature of Vedic
astronomical cycles and their relation to later ideas of rebirth in:
