Subject: Vedic tone notation, how ancient?
Message-ID: <161227067758.23782.11910836294723236867.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Could anyone tell me how old the use of various forms of notation to
indicate the tones in Vedic chanting is, and what the evidence for
this is?  I need it for possible inclusion in an exhibit as an example
of the beginnings of writing and musical notation.

Thanks,

Allen
