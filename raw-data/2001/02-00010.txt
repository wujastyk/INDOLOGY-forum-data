in all the other languages spoken in the world?there
are so many words belonging to sanskrit,and available
in other indial languages,the english words
"brother",and "sister" also are derived from sanskrit
root words"bhraatra" ,"swashaa",so if you can learn
sanskrityou will get the root from where all languages
starting.
