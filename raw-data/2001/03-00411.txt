Subject: India's UGC to fund jyotissastra
Message-ID: <161227068793.23782.3901492270940613168.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Independent's article on Vedic astrology draws some of its language
directly from :

Vedic Astrology - An Open Letter to the Chairman, UGC

Other discussion in the Indian press seems to indicate that the UGC head sees
a demand for traditional pandits, and wants the universities to meet that
demand :

Future is an MA in rituals & astrology -- UGC's chief

Being a traditional pandit is certainly a legitimate profession,
and education should be provided for, and the opportunity should be
used to expose them to modern science as well.

I believe that establishing such courses and education is not for a
government body like the University Grants Commission; it is for
institutions like the trusts that run the Hindu temples. (Of course,
while autonomous, these are government appointed.) The focus on
Vedic astrology is a tactic being used by opponents to run the
entire idea out of town. While this is understandable, I think the
focus has to be that this is not a proper government activity;
Hindus should organize and fund it themselves.
