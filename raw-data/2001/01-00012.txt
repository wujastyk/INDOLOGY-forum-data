Already there exists a Sanskrit verse similar to the Telagu one :

no gurjariistana ivaatitaraa.m niguu.dho
naandhriipayodhara ivaatitaraa.m prakaa'sa.h /
artho giraa.m apihita.h pihita's ca ka'scit
saubhaagyam eti maraha.t.tavadhuukucaabha.h //

I do not remember the source of this verse at this moment.
