Dear Dominik,

Yano:
Your message some time ago about Michio Yano's calendar program prompts me
to say that I wish you would give some publicity also to my Kairos program,
Windows program for Win95 etc.. Quite possibly you did not even know of it.
It is a general calendar coversion program that includes, among a lot of
others, the Indian calendar according to a choice of source parameters,
choice of Mean and True tithis, and a display that includes all possible
combinations of Era, amanta, punimanta months, etc. I have a web site for
it:

True, I charge ?60 for it, but it covers a lot of ground. If you would like
a full version for yourself, please tell me. It is widely used, and indeed
the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin bought no less than 4 copies.
The version to appear next will include a complete Chinese chronology,
with Chinese characters, and a calendar based directly exactly on the
authoritative Chinese calendar tables.
[...]

Best,
Raymond
