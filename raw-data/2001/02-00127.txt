Yes, I did. In fact it is interpreted this way in, say, RAma PrasAda's
translation of VAcaspati Mizra gloss on VyAsacommentary.

on p.501, col. 2 of MW draSTu is given as initial stem of compounds.

As far as meaning "percept", I think I made it quite clear that meanings
given in my interpretation often  are different from those in MW or other
dictionaries.  The meaning of words is derived according the scheme given,
not from dictionaries.

Derivatives in -tu and in -tA are quite legal way to derive words from
roots. Examples are dhAtu, vastu and devatA, vIratA.

I explicitly assumed that whatever mechanism is present in Sanskrit
for derivation, it might be present in YS. And the fact that draSTu is
present in compounds like draSTukAma is an indication that draSTu might
be a legally derived word.

Sorry to hear, that one case of what you consider a mistake made you
stop reading. I'm sure there some mistakes in what I did, but
whether they will invalidate the whole interpretation remains to be seen.

Best wishes, Dmitri.
