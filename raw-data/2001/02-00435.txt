Going over the past and blaming different countries is no help. It is quite
possible that the Taliban regime , isolated diplomatically and  economically,
wants to draw the attention of the world by this move. Just because they want to
draw attention does not mean they won't carry out their stated aim.

It is possible a UN inspired trust , with sufficient monetary incentives can
lure Taleban to leave the archeological artifacts alone. On the other hand,
Taleban may be angry at the UN imposing sanctions on them recently. But massive
monetary and food handouts by diferent countries may help save the artifacts
