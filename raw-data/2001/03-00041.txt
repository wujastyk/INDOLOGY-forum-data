Sadhanas seem to me to be equivalent to exercise, eating and sleeping. I
agree the head leads and the ego is essential, but it is not the process nor
the end. When life is fully experienced, ego and conscious thought drop away
and only the process remains which is very wholistic and everything then
becomesis a tool as you write.

You do need special tools to step into the game of life or to change it do
you not?

The average person only has kundalini if there is a real need for it. A
little lady lifts a car to free a child using kundalini, yes? You however,
cannot lift a car (I assume), but you could develop your strength to be able
to do so, but then you need to find a car that needs to be lifted.

Again what about the unplanned? The emergencies? The challenges? What if
there is something beyond your present comprehension and wisdom?
