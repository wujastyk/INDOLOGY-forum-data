Dear Birgit,

there must be some more special written about this, but in any case
Moorhouse in his book India Britannica emphasizes the role of the I.C.S.
as a sort of new creation later used as a model elsewhere, too.
According to Moorhouse the very word "civil servant" was coined in
British India.

All the best
Klaus
