Subject: Upgrade to Prof. Yano's web-based Pancanga program
Message-ID: <161227068415.23782.3633665947124867554.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Prof. Yano's extraordinarily useful and sophisticated web-based tool for
calculating various Indian eras and dates is located at

        http://www.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/index.html

Prof. Yano has written to announce an upgrade to the program, and he has
most generously made his algorithms publicly available.

Dear Dominik,

I have been working for upgrading the Perl version of pancanga
program.

There are several new features as you will see.

I have decided to make the source script of the perl version
open to the public.

[...]
I will appreciate if you announce about our new version.

With best wishes,
