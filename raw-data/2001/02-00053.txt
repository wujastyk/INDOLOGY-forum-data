>?From Prof. Asko Parpola:
>         As you will see from my 1994 book (last chapter), I think the
>Harappans worshipped a goddess of war and offered human sacrifices to her.
>It is possible, however, as I now think, that this
>"proto-Durgaa" was a relatively late addition to their pantheon, and
>that Murugan whom I believe the Harappans also worshipped, might also
>have acquired his warring nature at this late phase only, having at first
>been mainly a fertily god associated with childbirth. I suspect
>that the military functions of these divinities were imported partly from
>Mesopotamia, partly from Afghanistan (by the incoming Daasas, the first
>wave of the Aryans). As to the Old Tamils, though their traditions
>undoubtedly go back to the Indus Vally, I think their martial heritage
>largely derives from the Iron Age Megalithic culture
>that diffused all over the peninsular India from the north and was probably
>initiated by a new wave of originally Iranian-speaking Aryans around 800
>BC. In an article from 1984, and a new just submitted for publication, I am
>connecting the Megalithic culture with the PaaNDavas and the PaaNDyas.
