I am not in a position to help you as my main field of expertise, for
what it's worth, is Buddhology.  I think there are others on the list
much more qualified to speak on IA comparative linguistics -- I just
happen to have an old interest in Egyptian matters dating from my
early days before I got seduced by things further east.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
