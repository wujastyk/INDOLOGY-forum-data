is said to have been of Karnata origin. From where in Karnata?
Is it possible that svaami -> saayi is a southern influence in
Bengali, but only a feature of central Dravidian languages?
Or is svaami -> saayi a Bengali influence on the languages of
the Deccan plateau? Given documented historical interactions
between Bengal and central India, extending into the Deccan,
careful analysis of central Dravidian languages and eastern
Prakrits is required. Southern Dravidian may not have all the
answers to all such questions.

Another possibility - was Saaya.na's family a relatively recent
immigrant from the north? Between the 9th and 13th centuries,
many Brahmin families seem to have newly arrived in the south.
There are even people surnamed Mizra, in Tamil country proper.
Thus, Zrivatsaanka Mizra (Kuuranaaraaya.na) of Vizi.staadvaita
tradition and Jnaanottama Mizra (author of Candrikaa, comm. on
Surezvara's Nai.skarmyasiddhi) of Advaita tradition.

Best,
Vidyasankar
