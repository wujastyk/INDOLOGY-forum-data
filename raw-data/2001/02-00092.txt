To some extent, the statements of these kind does not tell us much. For every
statement of this  kind, so many counter examples can be brought which can render
any statemnent meaningless. For example, if you take the statement "Tamil  ...
poetry...antedates.. Sanskrit culture", we know from the earliest days Indra and
Varuna were worshipped as 'Thinai' gods. Indra is a quintessentially vedic aryan
god and so is Varuna. Even Thirumal is  Vishnu . Even at popular level, vedic
deities held sway


Vaiyapuri Pillai, without bringing in the words "sanskrtization" and
"brahminization" has brought in enough evidence to show that the change was not
that radical from Sangam to Pallavan times as suggested by Dr.Ganesan. Ganesan's
words like 'state sponsorship' gives an impresion a state on the model of model
western theories, while the social fact may only be powerful land owners .
