Subject: The evil eye in Skt literature?
Message-ID: <161227069978.23782.8552757410505774744.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks for these references and Hindi term which I do know--I'm acquainted
with Dundes's book but not the others--been a while.

I just wanted what was/is available in Sanskrit literary reference and
terminology, so kuDRSTi(ta) is a start.  To pursue this line a bit futher,
is there any situation where the glance of a deity (or divien being, even a
demon)  is said to zap one in the same way?  (As I understand it the concept
darshan applies to the devotee viewer or gazer although it's a reciprocal
gaze between deity and devotee--(i.e. the deity does not "take darshan" of
the devotee); so this aspect is not what I'm looking for--I'm looking for
the opposite, i.e. wondering if it exists--a daemonic gaze perhaps?

The Skt. term for evil eye often is kudRSTi(ta), Hindi najar etc.. For
references
see:

eye in
South Asia", in: id. (ed.) The Evil Eye. Columbia 1976, 102-149.
