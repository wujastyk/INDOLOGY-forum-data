Evidence:

A premier institution established to create think tanks, and
policy makers and academics, the JNU, is yet to begin teaching
Sanskrit at any  level. It has had a full School of Languages
and Culture but without Sanskrit.

No matter of chance, a matter of deliberate choice made to
demean sanskrit. The  Nehruvian mind-set had no place for sanskrit.
