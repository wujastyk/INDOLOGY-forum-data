Hi Madhav,

I believe that the answer to your pre-final question is, Yes. As for the
final, I have thoughts ("thoughts" is just the word) on this and it is part
of the topic about which I hope to talk at the Leiden Vedic workshop in
May-June but if you send me an address where around Xmas/New Year things
might reach you with the least delay, I'll send you something.

best
