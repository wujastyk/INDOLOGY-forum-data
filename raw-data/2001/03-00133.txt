It was M.G.S. Hodgson who in 1970 coined this term:
"by the sixteenth century, most of the East Christian, Hindu,
and Theravada Buddhist peoples found themselves more or less
enclaved in an Islamicate world where Muslim standards of taste
commonly made their way even into independent kingdoms,
like Hindu Vijayanagar or Norman Sicily."
(p.120, Hodgson, Rethinking world history: essays on
Europe, Islam and World history, Edited by
E. Burke III, Cambridge Univ. Press)

Because you are interested in Hindu, Hindutva, Islamicate
culture of North India, this will be interesting:
P. B. Wagoner, "Sultan among Hindu Kings", J. Asian Studies,
55, 4, 1996: 851-880.
