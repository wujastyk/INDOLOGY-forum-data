The common Hindi word for cowherd is "gvaala". Would
it perhaps be less strained to derive it from Skt.
gopaala?

Another point for your consideration. The ancient
Tamil name for the town of kOval (tirukkOvalUr) is
iTaikazi. kOval could actually be a rendering of
iTaikazi, influenced perhaps by the first part of the
more obscure iTaikazi.

(The name iTaikazi for the town seems to have been
inadequately appreciated :-) and in time seems to have
been totally superseded by kOval. The word iTaikazi
itself seems to have reduced in meaning from town to
temple to a passage in the temple. This progressive
reduction in meaning is evident as we proceed from
AzvAr hymns to commentaries on the hymns to
hagiographies.)

Warm Regards,
