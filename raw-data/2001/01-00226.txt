To the best of my knowledge, the verse 8 of Chapter16 of GItA describes the
view of people of AasurI category. The words Daiva and Aasura are
adjectives to the various people. Aasura people think that this world is
created without any reason and it is without the God, the creator and hence
only use of this world is enjoyment. This is the view of Aasura people
only , not of DaivI people. Among people all are included, such as Sura,
Asura, Deva, Daitya, DAnava,Manu.sya,Gandharva, Kinnara,Yaksha, RAkshasa,
NAga, Sarpa,VAnara, SuparNa etc. Devotee PralhAda belonged to Asura people
but he was of DaivI category because he was devotee of NArAyaNA. The same
is true of Rakshasa Bibhi.saNa, brother of RAvaNa.Thanks.
