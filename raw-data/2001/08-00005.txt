This d.r.s.taanta seems to occur in a number of works related to/influenced
by the so-called 'Buddhist pramaa.na school'. No doubt specialists will be
able to provide several references. Note that in the presumable source for
the example (Dharmakiirti's svav.rtti, Gnoli's edition p. 111 l. 1) we
find "srotriyakaapaalikagh.r.naavat. For those later authors who substitute
the word jo.ti"nga (joti"nga and jodi.mga seem indeed to be errors or
variant orthographies for this) this word appears to have been synonymous
with kaapaalika.

I have noticed that in the case of the Tantric Buddhist Tattvasiddhi (still
unpublished---I have read a draft of an edition of a part of the text
prepared by Prof. Steinkellner and soon to appear, I believe, in the
Festschrift for Raniero Gnoli), the Tibetan translation of that work (Otani
4531) renders the jo.ti"nga of the Sanskrit (a slightly different wording
of the same d.r.s.taanta: yathaa "srotriyajo.ti"ngaadau gh.r.naa) with
brtul zhugs chen po (Peking f. 41v5) as if translating Sanskrit
mahaavrata/mahaavratin.

The word thus appears to denote a "Saiva kaapaalika ascetic. I have a
recollection, however, that in a conversation some years ago with Prof.
Sanderson, no doubt the most widely read scholar of "Saivism, he told me
that the word does not occur in texts of the "Saivas themselves. It may
well, therefore, have had negative connotations (cf. the material from
Prakrit and Marathi languages adduced by Madhav Deshpande).
