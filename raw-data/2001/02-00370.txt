We are publishing an online translation of the Pali Dhammapada. You can
find it on:
http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/PALI/reading/dhapa.htm
Twenty new verses are added each month, the whole Dhammapada will be
finished soon.
You will need to download a ttf font to be able to read the text, go to
http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/PALI/reading.htm and download from there.
Don't miss also the main page http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw with many informations
about Buddhism in general.
