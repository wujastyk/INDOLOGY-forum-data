Dear Dominik,

I agree with Meenakshi Bauri. I hope you will reconsider this radical
move. I have been a silent lurker on the list, but have learned so much
from it! Could we maybe have a list where anybody can read the discussion,
but only serious and interested people (ones with at least general
knowledge, who are not just here to flaunt their ignorance and ill will)
can post?

Please let's think of some less draconian solution to the problem.

yours with hope for some solution,
Fran
