One is awestruck at the insistence of so many scholars
to continue to speak on the subject of Buddhism as if
one Sakyamuni actually existed. This is particularly
troubling in light of the mere ?tissue of fable? and
implausible history upon which ? perhaps better put
??Buddha-ism? so infirmly rests.

Therefore, the question truly asks itself: Where is
there any experiential knowledge upon which one bases
ones presumption of the existence of a personal
founder of the Buddha cult?

In addition to the ?the Buddha,? there are other
worryingly unqualified usages such as ?the caste
system? and ?the tradition.?

We could ask ourselves, are we in a scientific
community or church here?
