Dear Colleagues,

we would like to announce the web-based presentation of a religious map
of Varanasi. The project was carried out as part of the Varanasi
Research Project "Visualized Space" at the South Asia Institute,
University of Heidelberg:

map of V?r?nas? based on the K?sh?khanda and related texts. University
of Heidelberg ? South Asia Institute 2001. J?rg Gengnagel (editor) &
Axel Michaels (editor-in-chief). URL: http://benares.uni-hd.de

The site will be constantly updated. We look forward to your comments
and suggestions.
