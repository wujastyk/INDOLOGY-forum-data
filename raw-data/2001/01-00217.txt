Is such a nominal compound possible in a Dravidian language c. 2000 BC?
Do we know anything about nominal compounds before IA influence?
Is the assimilation supposed to have taken place in Dravidian or Semitic?

I have no objections; this sounds reasonable. But there was also a contact
across the Iranian plateau from the fourth millennium, especially connected
with the lapis lazuli trade. This connection might not have broken off in
the 20th century.
