It reminds me of a story of Lyndon Johnson's told in the Pentagon
papers. After winning a hand on a bluff, the losers ask the poker
player what cards he had in his hand. He answers reluctantly,
"Aces." The inevitable question pops up: "How many aces?" Answer:
"One aces."

In this case, Witzel had "one cohorts."

Cheers,
Steve
