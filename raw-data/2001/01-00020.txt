I found a nice link to the famous Hobson-Jobson dictionary.
Helpful for searching the Indian roots of certain english words.
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/hobsonjobson/index.html

It looks dictionaries of more Indian languages will be available
from the same site in the future.

I know Sanskrit and Tamil dictionaries from the Cologne website,
are there any other web Indian language (to English) dictionaries
out there?
