Dan,

Enter Gazetteer (singular) AND India.  I got over 500.

 Allen,

Thanks for the information.  I tried a boolean (keyword) search
yesterday on
Eureka and FirstSearch WorldCat and came up with only a few
references:
Gazeteers on Kashmir and Bihar, I think they were.  What do you
suggest
entering to get the whole listing of gazeteers?

Have a great time at the Sanskrit Congress.  I thought of going, but
knew
that with only a month to go in the semester and the temptation to
stay on
for a while to do some research over in Udaipur presented too many
obstacles.  I am in the process of translating the Ekalingamahatmyam
right
now since it has never been translated from the original medieval
Skt. and
am finding the Sanskrit interestingly challenging and lots different
from
the thirty years I have spent in the more classical Puranas, Sastras,
etc.

My thanks again for the help and my best wishes for your trip,

Dan

Dear Dan,

LC has practically all of it frequently in multiple editions, and a
year or so ago bought what is hopefully  all of it in the IDC
microform editions.

Alternatively, you can look at FirstSearch limiting the search to
WorldCat, which is a version of OCLC, the gigantic online union
catalog which supports among other things the interlibrary loan
system.

I would also expect the Research Triangle universities would have
most of this.  Contact Avinash Maheshwary the South Asia
Bibliographer
at Duke <avinash.maheshwary at duke.edu>.

Good luck,

Allen

Fellow Indologists,

In trying to locate the library availability in the U.S. of the
colonial
Indian gazeteers, I have tried both major U.S. library search
engines, First
Search and Eureka, with little success.  Can anyone point me in the
right
direction?

Thanks.

Dan White
