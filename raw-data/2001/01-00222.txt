I would also like to hear about good treatments of historical
grammars of literary Dravidian languages like Kannada, Telugu
and Malayalam.

If you are in Toronto which has 200,000+ Tamils living, it should be
easy to find Tamil teachers at different levels. Nowadays
multimedia presentaions are available. For example, UPenn site has
one Tamil program.

For classical Tamil grammar, consult:
V. S. Rajam, A reference grammar of classical Tamil poetry,
American Philosophical Society, 1992. 1081 p.

For learning Tamil, Dr. Ganesan listed some books in 1997,
