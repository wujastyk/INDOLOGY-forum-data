<< Is this a personal conversation between some
people?? I don't remember reading this sort of thing
in Indology list. >>

<< Lot of Vaishnavism went from Tamil lands to Bengal,
and not the other way around ... I have not come
across Goswami in early Vaishnava literature in Tamil.
Do you know any instance in Tamil?>>
