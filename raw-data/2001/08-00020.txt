12th WORLD SANSKRIT CONFERENCE
Helsinki, Finland, 14-19 July, 2003


As decided by the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (IASS)
at its 10th and 11th World Sanskrit Conferences held in Bangalore (India)
in 1997 and in Turin (Italy) in 2000, the 12th World Sanskrit Conference
will be held in Helsinki (Finland), from the 14th to the 19th of July,
2003. The conference is organized by the IASS and the Department of
Indology, Institute for Asian and African Studies, University of
Helsinki. The organisers look forward to welcoming fellow scholars to
Helsinki for the conference.


MODE OF OPERATION AT THE 12th WORLD SANSKRIT CONFERENCE

The 12th World Sanskrit Conference will operate in 14 parallel sections
organized by scholars specializing in the particular field. They will
be responsible for selecting the papers to be presented in the section,
for supervising the meetings of the section and for editing the papers
subsequently in a separate volume. The chairpersons may modify the title
of their section and volume, for example by giving it a specific theme.
        To guarantee a high scholarly level for the conference, we have
asked the chairpersons to pre-select a proportion of the speakers by
invitation. Scholars wishing to present a paper but not directly
contacted by the respective chairpersons in advance will be in
competition with each other. Titles and abstracts of unsolicited papers
should be sent to the conference organizers in Helsinki; they will be
forwarded to the relevant chairpersons, who will review them and select
the best.

The 14 sections and their chairpersons, who have all kindly agreed to
accept their demanding task, are indicated below. Specific themes, as
