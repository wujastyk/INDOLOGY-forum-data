Subject: Text layers in the Gita
Message-ID: <161227068701.23782.6276748333250449994.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is any historical analysis of the layers of the text of the Gita capable
of
demonstrating that there was an earlier version in which Arjuna began
the battle with compulsion
, as a pacifist, and a later version with Krishna's sermon making him
joyfully enter the
battle ?

If it were so, a historical growth from pacifism to agonism brought
about by a certain
philosophic school/social or caste order located at a particular period
in Indian histiory
would be discernable and would be of some use to history writing.

If not analysis of textual layers proves
nothing more than the fact that the text has grown, something that
traditional pundits
have also known for ages.

Also it implies a debunking of the cultural preservation of the text
through a combined
effort of pundits, performers, vyaasas and phiosophers to make meaning
relevant for the
lives of the people as a living not just 'historical' text. Has anybody
been able to isolate
the text of jaya, bhaarat and MBh? Would like to learn of this.

One has to take the Gita as a solely 'spoken' and preserved
text to see its justification, both wordly and spiritual , for a just
and unavoidable war.
One may disagree with Krishna and say that even after the denial of five
villages Pandavas
should not have fought their brothers to commit the sin of fatrcide or
civil war. But I
dont see what textual layers prove or how Gita becomes a warmongering
or'dishonest' book.
