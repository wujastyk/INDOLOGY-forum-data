Naram-Sin(2291-2255 BCE) in his reign chose the path of war and, at least
for a while, was rewarded by success. To the title of 'King of Agade', he
could proudly add those of 'King of the four regions(of the World)'(shar
kibrat 'arbem) and 'King of Universe' (shar kishshati). Here the word
'shar' means a king. Is not this title similar to the title of the ancient
Indian kings, namely Cakra-varti Rajah or Catur(four)-varti Rajah?
It appears that kibret means four (Catur)and kishshati means Universe
(Cakra-varti). His father Manishtusu (2306-2292 BCE) king of Kish
subjugated Anshan and Shirikum (southwest Iran). In the known history in
the middle of sixth century BCE, Cyrus the Great took similar title-King of
Kings, King of Parshua and Anshan and Parshumas, King of four quarters.This
title was known in the Middle-East for at least 2500 years. Now overland
route linked India commercially with coasts of Greece as early as 4000 BCE.
The excavations in ancient Sumer and Akkad have furnished evidence of this
fact. The commercial relations of Akkadians reached in the Eat to India
2000 years before King Solomon's time. Teakwood from India has been
recovered at Nippur from levels of 4000 BCE. So there is 3000 years' long
history of India prior to the so-called meeting (around 1000 BCE) between
horse riders(aryans) and Elephant riders (non-Aryans). Certainly the south
India must be in contact with those Middle-east countries 3000 years prior
to 1000 BCE.Now the Indian title Cakra-varti cannot be Dravidian because to
the best of my knowledge sound combination like 'Cr' as in Cakra does not
appear in Dravidian. So it appears that the title Cakra-varti was brought
to India by Aryans. In that case Dravidians who knew Middle-east countries
did not learn anything. It appears that they simply were faceless traders
without any kings or titles like Cakra-varti Rajah. Could there be any
explanation different from this? Thanks.
