I'm not sure of "Saantarak.sita's route but for that of Marpa the
Translator you could consult pp. xxvii ff. of:

@Book{trungpa:life,
  editor =       "Ch\"{o}gyam Trungpa",
  title =        "The Life of Marpa The Translator: Seeing Accomplishes
                 All",
  publisher =    "Shambhala",
  stitle =       "The Life of Marpa",
  year =         "1995",
  key =          "trungpa:1995",
  address =      "Boston \& London",
  note =         "a trans. of `Mar pa rnam thar' by Gtsang smyon He ru
                 ka (1452--1507) by the N\={a}land\={a} Translation Committee
                 under the direction of Ch\"{o}gyam Trungpa",
}

His journeys seem to have been protracted for various reasons not
the least of which would have been the difficulty of
acclimatisation.


Many regards,

 Richard Mahoney
