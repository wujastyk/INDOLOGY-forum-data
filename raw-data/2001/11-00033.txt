---------- Forwarded message ----------

Please note there will be major disruption this weekend.

[...]

The Liverpool listserv service is being migrated to a more powerful
server over this next weekend.

This means that any email sent to Liverpool lists between 5pm on Friday
23rd November and 9am on Monday 26th November will not be delivered
until after 9am on Monday 26th. No list email will be lost.

During this time archives of lists will be unavailable and list owners
will not be able to administer their lists.

Please note that, after 9am on Monday 26th November, the URL that
provides access to archives and list management via the web will change
to:

http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa

(note case and no trailing ".EXE"

Please update your bookmarks/favourites accordingly.

Please report any problems to

        list.admin at liverpool.ac.uk
