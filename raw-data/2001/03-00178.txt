which are reported in the Old Testament. From this to declare to a not very
well informed audience that the Old Testament is a dishonest book is not only
silly, if not sacrilege, but is irresponsible too; and certainly unbecoming of
a reputed scholar. But then, given Ms Doniger's obsessive interpretations of
Indian myths, we may be grateful she did not detect in the Gita any homophilic
relationship between Krishna and Arjuna.
        Bookish academics need to remember that when it comes to analyzing
works regarded as sacred by vast numbers of people, sound scholarship is like
the firmness of bones, while appreciation and sensitivity are like flesh and
blood. Without the latter, the former is merely an ugly skeleton: morbid and
monstrous, lifeless and lamentable. With the latter, scholarship becomes robust
and living. Ignoring this fact has led to many otherwise meaningful
commentaries.

here. If anyone wishes, I will be happy send the remaining part in a personal
e-mail if you write to me.]
