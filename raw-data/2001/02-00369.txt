and legends. From Maharashtra down South, Ellamma/Mari
myth is the most widespread of all goddess myths, and
Renukamahatmyam in the MBh. epic is called as first well-known
"Sanskritization" at work (Goldman). The headless Lajjagauri
sculptures in a love-ready posture of legs are related to the
outcaste mAri/elli-amma whose head is chopped off.

Cautions L. C. Orr in her book on Temple women in
medieval Tamilnadu, OUP, 2000:
"Our knowledge of prostitutes - even in recent history,
but certainly in earlier times - is far too slight for
us to speculate about whether there were in fact "traditional"
communities or castes of prostitutes in India and about
how colonialism may have changed their circumstances. In
Indian literature, from a very early period, there are
references to vezyas and ga.nikaas ("prostitutes" or
"courtesans"), but they are for the most part portrayed as
ideal types or stock characters of various sorts, depending
on the genre (e.g., as donors in Buddhist literature, as
royal attendents in Epic literature, and as cultural
beauties in Sanskrit drama). We know very little about
what prostitution or concubinage actually entailed in
various periods of Indian history or what relation there
may be between the vezyas and gaNikas of literature
and the forms of prostitution encountered (or created
by) European colonists."

Like calling some castes as "criminal", "devadasis" were
called a caste by themselves! and was banned. But they
were the "jewels" of old India.

This may be the situation (ie., our lack of knowledge) in the ancient
Near East still further removed in time. There also we find
songstresses playing lute represnted as 'nude'.

"Prostitutes are mentioned together with various
groups of women engaged in more or less relgious
activities. Inana/Ishtar seems to have been presented
as a protective goddess of prostitutes. In cult songs
the goddess sometimes refers herself as a prostitute,
and her temple is metaphorically called a tavern. It seems
possible that prostitution was to some extent organised
in the same way as other female activities (such as
midwifery or wetnursing) and in some way manipulated
through the temple organisation. But this is a subject
which is still not clearly understood and where further
research would shed light upon the exploitation of
women in Mesopotamia."
