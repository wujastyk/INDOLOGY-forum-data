Sorry for my shamelessness, dear Berliner colleague! I have read Your
message, and I beg You a favour. In August I shall come in Berlin for the
ICAS 2, but all the hotels signalised by the organising committee are too
expensive for me and my husband. How can I find a cheap Gasthof or a double
room in a private house?
Many thanks in advance, and sorry again for the annoyance,
sincerely Yours
Daniela
