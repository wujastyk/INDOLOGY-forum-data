So what? Did you want him to be single item in his agenda?
I think most of his reforms have been admirable and have brought Turkey to
come out of its obscurantism of the medieval age after WWI. It is the only
muslim country which still has legal separation between the church and
state.

There was no ban on translating sufi or any literature but you should
remember that after WWI Turkey had to undergo very severe economic
depression from which it has not yet recovered and people had other
priorities than reading sufi poems.

New ideas always try to replace the old ones regardless of the script in
which they are written. China has come a long way without giving up its
script and communist philosophy while India with Nehruvian dictatorship and
dynasty has not fared any better.

As a matter of fact they did make English mandatory in schools and did
everything to degrade Devnagri script by preferring Urdu script in their
courts so that there was little incentive to study Devnagri script. It was
only Arya Samaja and Gandhi who hailed from non-Devnagri regions of India
who kept the interest in Hindi written in Devnagri script alive.

BTW, in British army Hindi was actually written in Roman script and soldiers
were required to learn only one script.


Have a peaceful and joyous day.
