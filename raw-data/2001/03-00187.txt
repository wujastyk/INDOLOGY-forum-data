I am sorry, the title of Philip McEldowney's thesis should
have been

"Colonial Administration and Social Developments in
Middle India: The Central Provinces, 1886-1921"

I had the period as 1986-1921.

Also I should mention that Central Provinces has a southern
section (Nagpur region) where Marathi was common. It is now
part of Maharashtra. I assume that in the quote "northern province"
refers to northern part of "Central Provinces", now part of
MP/Chhatisgarh states.
