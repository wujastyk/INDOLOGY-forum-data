"Bone of contention" - does this mean what Prof. Zydenbos calls the "phony
debate"? The academics of Indology are 100% unanimous that Aryans and
their languages ingressed into India. Prof. Fosse wrote his comments on
the OIT friends and their (analytical) approach.

Vedic Aryans are the "genetic template" for Indians??!! Indological research
shows that the Rigvedic Aryans who entered are a small percentage of the Indian
population. Sangam literature does not say that Southerners are Aryans,
in fact Aryans are an ethnic term for North Indians. Indologists,
Anthropologists, claim that Indians in the North changed to Aryan languages
when their elites imposed  by force, co-options (cf. chariots and archery).

The endowed Sanskrit professorships in Europe and elsewhere are due to the
growth of philology from 19th century. Hope Indologists work and use their
power
to include and create many Dravidian, Dalit, Village/local anthropology studies
positions in their Depts and funding mechanisms need to be nourished.

The Sanskrit Indologists claims will be bolstered by Dravidology professionals
in the decades to come, once they have the job in acclaimed Western
universities.
