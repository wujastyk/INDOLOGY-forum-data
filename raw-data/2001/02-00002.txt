Dear Professor Gupt,

I look forward to reading your book. One question: does your own definition
of Indian heritage include the cultural resources of Islamic and other
cultures as well or only Hindu culture. I ask this not to be provocative for
the sake of it, but to then position your own understanding of the
'Nehruvian mindset' to your own understanding of 'Indian heritage'.

Rohit
