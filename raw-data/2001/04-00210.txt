I think this is a mistake, an admission of defeat by the yowling yahoos who
try to drown out competing voices with their screams and insults.

You had a better idea the first time, i.e., to cancel anyone's membership
who uses insulting language.  But you obviously do not have the time to keep
up with the volume.  How about adding two or three more moderators with
authority to squelch insults and noise, instead of setting up a private,
off-limits list (which is what everyone will assume you are doing)?  And set
up a "lurker" category for people to listen, but not write.

Free speech should not be allowed to be defeated by the saffron- or
white-shirted noisemakers.  Cure the problem, don't stop your speech.

David
