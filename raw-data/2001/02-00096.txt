The summary statements by scholars like Hart and Zvelebil
are valid for anyone studying sangam poetry thouroughly.
Not many counterexamples can be given to make the scholars'
summaries invalid.

The ascription of Gods like Indra and VaruNa to tiNai landscapes
seem to emanate from later layers of TolkAppiyam. For example,
Tol. talks of puLLi, a "negative alphabet" (= -a), an invention
that led to the non-samyuktaaksharam orthography of Tamil.
However, the occurence of puLLi is later than the earliest Tamil
inscriptions.

The Sanskrit culture in sangam texts cannot be gotten
from Tolkappiyam because Tol. has layers that are much later
than sangam times.

Sangam texts themselves give us descriptions of local
priests whose rituals were to increase auspiciousness.
