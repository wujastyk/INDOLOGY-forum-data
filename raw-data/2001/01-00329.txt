I think we are missing several pooints.

India became colonized precisely because its "materialistic" technology got
outdated. So there is nothing wrong if engineers leave India to US to
acquire the technology. As long as intellectual property rights are not
violated, there is nothing wrong for these migrants to pass on technology to
India via joint ventures etc, as is happening now at Silicon Valley.

Again not miss another important point, the materialistic progress is also
dependent upon the base which is spiritual technology. The western
materialistic progress is based on centuries of philosophical and other
foundations of Aristotle, Socrates et,al. Can any one say the spiritual
technology of Aristotel is obsolete? On the contrary Aristotle has made a
strong come back when his panspermia (sperms in space) has become the
foundation for "Intelligent Desgin" and struck a death blow to Darwinism on
one hand and something-out-of-nothing Creationism on the other hand. I do
claim that the thoery of jAtavedas (Ai.Br), which proposes that beings are
pre-conceived according to a cosmic logic; which clearly precedes Aristotle,
can be a good starting point for those who care.

Now about "those who care":

There is a story of a crab exporter in India who dispatched crabs in open
containers without lids and saved money. The crabs reached the destination
intact, and everybody wondered how. It was explained that if one crab was
going up another one pulled it back.

Never mind the cynicism, I think the Govt of India is trying to prove where
the money is. Irrespective of the outcome the importance given to Sanskrit
will create a demand for teachers, and a competitive effect on other local
languages.. generating the much feared supply side economics.

By the way India doen't always need "latest" technology. There is also
another thing called "appropriate technology" which is a logical corollary
of supply side economics, and uses what is available in abundance instead of
the "latest".

Best regards
Bhadraiah
