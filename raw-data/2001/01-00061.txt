Subject: Dravidian golla and Hindi gvAla
Message-ID: <161227066326.23782.5181537538018366649.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Telugu, golla = a herdsman, a shepherd, ...
(C. P. Brown, Telugu-English dictionary, p. 389 )
Further, Brown records that "golla" is derived from
"gorri" =  A sheep. DED 1799 Ta. koRi sheep
... Te. goRe, goRRe sheep ....

For the Telugu word "goRe", compare the Tamil cognates:
a)koRi 02 1. sheep; 2. aries, a constellation of the zodiac
b)koRi-ttal 01 1. to nip off the husks of grains; to nibble grain; 2. to
graze;
to pick up food here and there, as cattle; to eat scantily;
c)koRRi 1. young calf; 2. cow with a young calf.

gvaala in Hindi meaning herdsmen does not seem to be
transmuted from Skt. gopAla, even though this is popularly
attested in modern dictionaries.

Consider Hindi jvAr < ka. jOLa, ta. cOLam, co_n_nal, tel. jonna.
(Though Mayrhofer 1953 EWA derives yananala from
yavana - Greek, Ionian etc.!)

Just as hindi jvAr (= millet ...) < drav. jOLa,
the Hindi word gvAla ultimately has roots in drav. golla,
and not Skt. gopAla.

Regards,
N. Ganesan

a) Like jvAr < drav. jOLa, and gvAla < drav. golla,
Hindi kvAn/kuA_n 'well" seem to be related with
DED 1518 Ta. tank, reservoir, lake, Ka. koLa, koNa.
.... It appears hindi kvAn < drav. koNa

b) This process seems to be working in
Skt. jvAla, dhvani. Are jvAla and dhvani IE?
and are they attested in old Persian?
Thanks.
