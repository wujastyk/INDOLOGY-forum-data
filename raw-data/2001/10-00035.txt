A belated  answer to  an older discussion:


Leaving the agnidanda apart for the moment, I think all available
information on the Patan Agnimath (agiMmaTha) indicates that it has
traditionally been run by the Newari speaking Rajopadhyaya Brahmins,
indeed for many centuries (probably from 1140 CE, and certainly from 1430
CE onwards).

For details see:

Cf. also the  booklet by Aishvarya Dhar Sharma, in Newari, of the mid-Eighties.

Mary Slusser's brief description of the Agnimath in her "Nepalamandala" is
based on  slightly incorrect  information: these Brahmins are not Saiva but
vegetarian Vaishnava, and  the aahavaniiya, the most important fire altar
in the 'temple', is dedidated to Visnu, not Shiva/Rudra.

That may be true NOW. Already when one of the last Agnihotrins died in c.
1980, the Rajopadhyayas had trouble to find a successor. One of them told
me that the local (Buddh.) farmers (Jyapus) had threatened to take over the
running of the fire temple, upon which the Rajopadhyayas finally convinced
a former Kathmandu school teacher, a Raj., to take over. His wife, however,
complained to me about this (kasto dukh cha...)

It may be that a change has taken place upon the passing of the then
officiating Rajopadhyaya (who theoretically always must be the oldest male
of the Raj. group).

>>I would like to stress that the officiating priests in the agnimaTha in

We have to countercheck, thus, on the Joshi claim. It may be a
misunderstanding that has arisen from the fact that the Agnihotrin always
has to offer a lot of grain homas for his local 'parishioners' when they
ask for it. These requests are based on the predictions of a local Joshi,
made on their birthday, of pending dangers for the coming year.

I would doubt that an actual Joshi has taken over by now. But who knows?
