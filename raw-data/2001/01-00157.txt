           LOGICAL MODEL OF THE YOGA PHILOSOPHY

                 by Ian Williams Goddard

      Originating in India in the 5th century AD, the
      system of numeration used throughout the world
      today has proven to facilitate extreme accuracy
      in the modelling of the physical universe.

      As we shall observe, our Hindu number system
      also accurately models -- and thus explains and
      validates as logical -- central metaphysics of
      the Hindu philosophy of yoga, or mystical union.


     BRAHMAN: CONTRADICTION OR TRUTH?

     The supreme truth in Hinduism is Brahman. Deities
     such as Shiva and Vishnu represent mere aspects of
     Brahman. According to Hindu scripture, "Brahman is
     all"[1] and yet "Brahman is without attributes."[2]
     Having zero attributes, Brahman is called "sunya,"
     which is Sanskrit for void and the number zero.

          "Sunya: void; the Nothing which is All.
            Sunya Brahman: [the brahman as the
               Void]; Supreme Nothingness."
              Glossary of Sanskrit terms [3]

     According to scripture, Brahman contains all forms
     and yet is formless; is the knower, knowledge, and
     the known and yet is "bereft of knower, knowledge,
     and known."[4] How can Brahman be all and nothing?
     How can Brahman be and also not-be x, y, and z?

     This all-and-nothing paradox is the nexus of centur-
     ies of confusion and dispute, not only between East
     and West but within Eastern philosophical systems.
     I believe the following resolves this Hindu paradox
     via, appropriately enough, the Hindu number system.


     NUMBERS: MAPPING THE FACE OF REALITY

     The claim that x is equal to all and x is equal to
     nothing is true if, and only if,  all is equal to
     nothing; for, if x = a and x = 0, then a = 0. But
     how could everything possibly be equal to nothing?

     Hindu scripture says that "Brahman is one" (is an
     undivided unity) but appears to be many due to the
     process of "differentiation." [5] The mathematical
     definition of difference is that which is obtained
     by subtraction.[6] The operation of subtraction is
     therefore both the indicated and logical model of
     the process by which Brahman appears to be many.

            "Treat the laws and relationships
              of integers like those of the
             celestial bodies." George Cantor

     The subtraction table models a system wherein that
     one system (the whole table) is populated with many
     attributes by the same process that Brahman is pop-
     ulated by many: by the process of differentiation:
               (fixed-pitch font required)

                        0  1  2  3
                       ____________
                    0 | 0  1  2  3 |
                      |            |
                    1 |-1  0  1  2 |
                      |            |
                    2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
                      |            |
                    3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
                      --------------


                    Just Like Brahman

                THE TABLE IS ALL & NOTHING

     Exactly like Brahman, the whole table (as a model
     of a whole universe, or the All) contains all and
     yet is itself equal to nothing, because the sum of
     all differences between all differentiated numbers
     will always equal zero no matter how many or few
     numbers are differentiated. All difference = 0.

     ERGO: it's a mathematic fact that the sum (yoga)
     of all differences (Brahman) equals zero (sunya).
     The all-and-nothing Brahman paradox is therefore
     not a contradiction but is in fact logically true
     with respect to the nature of the identity of the
     All, where the All is a whole system wherein all
     members are derived from differentiation, which
     is the means by which Brahman appears to contain
     many and by which any identity n is defined as n
     (a number n is primary its difference from zero).

     The significance of difference lies in the fact
     that difference -- from zero difference, or same
     as, to nonzero differences -- defines the causal
     structure of identity, which in turn defines the
     fundamental nature of every thing and existence.
     Therefore, using the example of the zero-sum of
     all difference to model the supreme identity is
     not arbitrary, but is the exact model indicated.

     (The differentiation table, or identity matrix,
     serves as a comprehensive model of the structure
     of identity; a more complete analysis of this is
     here: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/identity.htm)


     MORE YOGA PUZZLES SOLVED

     The differentiation table explains not only how
     Brahman can be all and nothing, but it explains
     many if not all aspects of yogic philosophy such
     as the  profoundly mystical  and seemingly absurd
     principle of "Ajati," which declares that nothing
     ever exists or is ever actually created (the same
     is referred to in Buddhism as the "nonarising" of
     all apparent phenomena). The nonarising of things
     defines their void-like, or nonexistent, nature.
     As the Hindu scripture Mandukya Upanishad says:

     "[N]either the mind nor the objects perceived
      by the mind are ever born. ... That which is
      non-existent [0] in the beginning and in the
      end, is necessarily non-existent [0] in the
       middle. The objects we see are illusions,
         still they are regarded as if real."

                 Mandukya Upanishad [7]

     If there is no difference, and then difference
     arises, yet the sum of All difference is equal
     to no difference(0), then in fact only nothing
     arises, hence the nonarising known as "Ajati."


     LOGICAL UNION OF ATMAN AND BRAHMAN

     Yoga means "union," the union of the identity
     of the individual,  the Atman,  with the iden-
     tity of the supreme Brahman, which is the All.

     As the differential matrix shows, the identity
     of each thing relative to itself is zero, which
     is the same identity as the identity of the All.
     The zero of self-relation defines the Absolute,
     or nonrelative, nature of identity expressed in
     the differentiation n - n = 0, which means that
     there is no (0) difference between n and n, and
     therefore n = n -- the definition of identity.

     So the Absolute identity of each thing (0) is
     the same as, and thus is united with, the Abso-
     lute identity of everything (0); which also ex-
     plains why Hindu scripture proclaims that the
     absolute nature of things is nonexistent (0).


     THE GOAL OF YOGA EQUALS ZERO (SUNYA)

     The goal of the practice of yoga is to condition
     the mind to become like zero and in so doing, to
     establish an  identity-union  between the finite
     self, the Atman, and the infinite All, Brahman.

         "Everything is 'I', and I am no thing."
          Ramesh Balsekar, "The Final Truth" [8]

     The traditional yoga lifestyle strives toward the
     goals of asceticism, which seeks to zero-out all
     desires, attachments, emotions, and ego clinging.
     The goal of yoga is essentially to cause the mind
     to become like zero. In fact, the goal of medita-
     tion  (the central feature of the yoga lifestyle)
     is to zero-out thoughts, to zero-out the mind and
     realize the true condition of reality... zero. To
     know the supreme become like the supreme... zero.

       "He who contemplates on sunya...is absorbed
        into space. . . think on the Great Void un-
        ceasingly. The Great Void, whose beginning
        is void, whose middle is void, [and] whose
        end is void...By contemplating continually
         on this, one obtains success [nirvana]."

                   The Siva Samhita [9]

               Buddhists agree with Hindus:

        "[I]t is only through the understanding of
        voidness that liberation from cyclic exist-
       ence is possible. ...Insight into voidness is
       therefore called 'the gateway to liberation.'"

          Geshe Rabten, "Echoes of Voidness" [10]


     IN CONCLUSION

     The central teachings of the philosophy of yoga
     amount to a logical description of the differen-
     tial structure of identity and the zero-sum of
     all differences, proving that (1) the "All" can
     be all and nothing (zero); (2) the arising of
     infinite differences cannot constitute a devia-
     tion from nothing (zero); and (3) the Absolute
     (i.e., nonrelative) identity of each individual
     entity, which is zero, equals the Absolute iden-
     tity of the All, hence their logical union (yoga).

     This essay demonstrates how the most radically
     "mystical" and heretofore inexplicable aspects
     of the Hindu philosophy of yoga can be logical.
