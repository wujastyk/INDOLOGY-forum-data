Depending upon how much the payment would be and other details, I can contact some folks in the South and find out if they'd be interested in this assignment. If interested, please send me email off list.

Since it's out of copyright, we could then publish it (print-on-demand) and recoup our investment. Anyone interested in making this happen?  Whitney? Dominik?

The font in which the N?gar? text is set can make for hard reading for those who aren't used to it: there are many times that I've strongly recommended it to intermediate students who have found it difficult to make sense of.  Also, Speyer doesn't always translate his examples: this isn't a problem for those with more experience in the language, but the target audience of language learners are sometimes at a disadvantage, which is a real shame.

Deeply laced throughout with Paninian references (fully understood for their linguistic meaning) and showing a sensitive and original flair for translation and understanding of his examples.  Amazing book.
