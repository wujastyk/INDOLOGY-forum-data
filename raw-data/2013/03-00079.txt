Subject: [INDOLOGY] Nagararjuna finger pointing to moon reference?
Message-ID: <58C96B817F7C45F9AB438C9B91F456B1@zen>

I have not time to check, but unless my memory is faulty (quite possible), 
isn't something like that found in the Kaa'syapa-parivarta ?

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge

I  can't answer your question, but I remember seeing this expression (it's
been years and memory fades) in the Kath?sarits?gara, a decidedly
un-buddhist source....
