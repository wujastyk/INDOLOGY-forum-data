Subject: Trivandrum Sanskrit Series available for download
Message-ID: <161227098851.23782.8048369889812885162.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The TSS has been scanned and uploaded  to archive.org.  See

   - https://archive.org/details/Trivandrum_Sanskrit_Series_TSS

Note that at the bottom of all the "PDF" headings in the left margin,

there is a link to "HTTPS".  That will give a listing of the individual
files

with titles.  The "torrent" linkn next to "HTTPS" will initiate a
bittorrent

transfer to your computer that will deliver all the volumes to you in one

batch transfer.  You will need a bittorrent client on your computer

for this to work. uTorrent is good (http://www.utorrent.com/), but there

are many choices of client.


Best,

Dominik Wujastyk
