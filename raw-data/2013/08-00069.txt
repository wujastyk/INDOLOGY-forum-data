Dear colleagues:
Can you help me find out. Well, according to the ?Sanskrit used in srutis as smritis,Prabhu is the term typically used in the masculine or it can be feminine too? There are instances of this word applied to a woman in this sastras? What classical dictionaries say about this?
Thanking so much for your help let me stay as your server.
Sincerily
?
