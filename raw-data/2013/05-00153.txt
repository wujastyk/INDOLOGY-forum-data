Subject: [INDOLOGY] Searching for copy of Ejima, Text-critical remarks AKBh 9
Message-ID: <51A330D5.3070008@asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de>

Dear colleagues,

does anyone by chance have a PDF of Ejima Yasunori's "Textcritical 
Remarks on the Ninth Chapter of the Abhidharmako?abh??ya", published in 
1987? Several moves around the globe have left me with an incomplete 
copy, unfortunately.

With thanks in advance and best regards,

Birgit Kellner
