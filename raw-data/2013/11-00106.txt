In my opinion, the poems speak for themselves.  When the Sangam poems say someone was of despised birth and we see the same group among the Dalits today, that must mean they were Dalits then, I would think.  It would be very nice if Sangam society was casteless and we could point to it as an exemplar of what India would be like without the Brahmins or whatever group is supposed to have dreamed up the caste system.  The fact remains that caste is spread from Nepal to Sri Lanka and from Assam to Pakistan among many ethnic groups and religions.  I think it must be very ancient, and almost certainly pre-Aryan, as the Vedic Aryans had nothing whatsoever like the j?ti system.  But however that may be, the Sangam poems specifically mention caste many times.  No doubt Palaniappan and I will disagree on this forever, but I think it is important to state that I am not at all persuaded by his arguments.

I never claimed that P??a?s were Dalits ? they were not.  Apparently, they occupied (and still occupy) a position somewhat above the Dalits, as they stayed in the homes of rich people, sang for them, and also served as go-betweens between rich men and their women.  And in modern times, they certainly must not be a high caste, since barbers and washermen will not eat food prepared by them. Regarding the bhakti poems, it is undeniable that the Dalits and the P??a?s were not allowed to enter temples.  

If the poems don?t mean what they say, then there may not have been caste in Sangam times in TN.  If they do, then it is very difficult to argue against the existence of caste, in my opinion.

All these have been addressed in my paper available at http://www.soas.ac.uk/research/publications/journals/ijjs/file46109.pdf . We have also discussed this in Indology in 2009. Here are the last two posts of the Indology discussion http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2009-July/033485.html

> For almost four decades, George Hart has propounded his views on the concept of dangerous sacred power,a?a?ku, among the Tamils and the practice of untouchability that resulted from contact with the sacred power. According to Hart, the P??a?s and Pa?aiya?s have always been the lowest castes because they were polluted because they came in contact with that sacred power.  The only problem is that, as I had mentioned in 2009, there is clear epigraphic evidence that the Tamil Pa?aiyar (plural of the Pa?aiya?) were not untouchables as late as the 11th century and Tamil P??ar (plural of the P??a?) are not untouchables even today. These facts completely invalidate Hart's theories. The reason Hart came to a conclusion diametrically opposite to mine is that his research methodology had major errors of commission and omission.

As a result, religious rites were carried out by the lowest castes: the Pa?aiya?s , the P??a?s, the Tu?iya?s, and the V?la?s...The V?la?, who is even today found among the Pa?aiya?s of Kerala, would dance ecstatically as he was possessed by Murugan, an indigenous god...The Pa?aiya?, the P??a?, and the Tu?iya? would each play a special instrument which was thought to be inhabited by a sacred power and which was used for various ritual purposes. The pollution which is attached to the low castes is thus a legacy of indigenous Dravidian religion."

> Hart's views of Tamil untouchability and sacred power are inseparable. And for his whole theory to have any validity, the Pa?aiyar (plural of the Pa?aiya?) and the P??ar (plural of the P??a?) he has mentioned above should be untouchables or lowest castes. If even one group is not untouchable, his whole theory collapses. I have already mentioned that the Pa?aiyar were not untouchables in the 11th century.

> "Elsewhere, the drum played for the king in the morning is the muracu (Pu?. 61, 397; Ai?. 448) . While there is nowhere any indication of who played the muracu, it is not unlikely that a subcaste of the Pa?aiya?s had that office, especially as one of the modern subdivisions of that caste is called Muracu."2 [emphasis mine]

> While Hart's change of -su to -cu may be understandable in terms of the Tamil transliteration system, the change of the radical vowel -o- to -u-,  which changed the name of the Pa?aiyar subdivision matching the word for 'drum' used in the Classical Tamil texts he cited, was problematic. This change could not have been a typographical error since in a later publication Hart (1987: 475) also says:
>

> In light of Hart's suggestion of the possible antiquity of this Pa?aiyar subdivision, there is some interesting information about the Morasu subdivision not mentioned by Hart (1975b) and Hart (1987). As can be seen from the highlighted portion in page 2 of the attachment, Thurston (1909: 81) says the following:
> 
> "It has been suggested to me that the Morasu Paraiyans, included in the above list are Canarese Holeyas, who have settled in the Tamil country." [emphasis mine]

> 
> (The story of Tirupp????v?r occurs in different medieval Vai??ava hagiographical works such as the ???yirappa?i Guruparampar?prabh?vam. While the Vai??ava hagiographical works depict the P?nar saint Tirupp????v?r as not being allowed to enter the temple, the Periyapur??am, the 12th century ?aiva haigiographical work, portrayed the P??ar saint Tirun?laka??ar as originally standing outside the temple and being brought inside due to intervention by ?iva Himself. In another instance, the brahmin saint Tiru???acampantar is said to have arranged for Tirun?laka?tar to sleep inside another brahmin saint's house.)

> 
> As one can see, Hart (1975b) had left out any mention of the Tamil P??a? in present day Tamil Nadu. Based on the two statements of Hart quoted above, it seems Hart was not aware of the existence of the P??ar in present day Tamil Nadu. Otherwise, he would not have had to rely on medieval hagiography to ascertain the 'low' status of the P???r. Here lay a fundamental problem with Hart's research approach. He was producing sweeping anthropological conclusions with insufficient knowledge of people he was writing about.
>  
> All Hart had to do was to turn a few pages in Thurston (1909), which he had anyway consulted in the case of the Pa?aiyar.  Thurston (1909) spells P??a? as P????, with the second vowel being long ?. This spelling variation cannot be a reason for disregarding the entry. After all, Tamil Lexicon has entries connecting both variants as given below.
>  
> ?????? p??a?, n. < ????. [M. p?na.] 1. An ancient class of Tamil bards and minstrels; ????????? ???????. ???????????????? (????. ??. 91). 2. See ??????. (W.)

>  
> Note that the Tamil Lexicon derives 'P????' from 'P??a?'.
>  
> The entry in Thurston (1909: 29-42) on the P???? is a long one discussing both the Tamil P???? as well as the Malayalam P????. The entry opens with a very brief discussion of the Tamil P???? while discussion of the Malayalam P???? takes up the bulk of the entry. But it is the brief discussion of the Tamil P???? that Hart should have taken into account.
>  
> As can be seen in page 3 of the attachment, the entry on the P????s opens with the following statement.  "The Tamil P?n?ns are said, in the Census Report, 1901, to be also called M?stris. They are "tailors among Tamils in Madura and Tinnevelly. They employ Br?hmans and Vell?las as pur?hits. Though barbers and washermen will not eat food prepared by them, they are allowed to enter Hindu temples."   Later in the entry, as shown in page 4 of the attachment, in regards to the P????s of Travancore, Thurston (1909: 33) says, "For the following account of the P?n?ns of Travancore, I am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The word is of Tamil origin, and means a tailor. The title taken by them is Panikkan, the usual honorific appellation of most of the industrial castes of Malabar. They are supposed to be one with the P?n?ns of the Tamil country though much below them in the social scale."  
>  
> As Gundert's dictionary notes, in Southern Tamil usage P??a? could indicate a bard as well as a tailor.
> ??????? p??a? T. M. (T. ????? = ???? melody). A caste of musicians, actors & players; in So. T. also tailors B., necromancers D. (= ???????????, ?????????????, ??????). ??' ????? ???? ???? prov. ??'???? ??????????????? ???????? Bhr. ? ?????????? V1. a caste of slaves.
>  
> Based on Tamil Lexicon and Gundert's dictionary, it is clear that P?n?n and P?nan are only variants of the same word. After all, there is no separate entry for P??a?s of Kerala in Thurston (1909).  Hart should have investigated if the P?n?n/P?nan, the tailor, and P?n?n/P?nan, the bard, were related in any way.  If he had conducted some fieldwork like anthropologists do before writing about different communities, he would have quickly realized that the tailors were from the same community as earlier bards.  At least if he had done a careful literature review, he would have gotten the true picture of the P?nans. 
>  
> For instance, the Arumpatavurai commentary for the Cilappatik?ram glosses tu??ak?rar in Cilappatik?ram (5.32) as P??ar. Also, as has been pointed out by Aiyar ([1924] 1999: 109), Travancore king B?lar?ma Varma's Sanskrit work, B?lar?ma Bharatam of the 18th century, presents as a tailor the bard P??apattiran of Madurai mentioned in the opening poem of the 11th Tirumu?ai of the ?aiva canon. Irakavan (1971: 79), a 20th century scholar, stated:

> Here is a translation of the above quote.
> "Many wonder if the P??ar caste/lineage exists today. The P??ar caste/lineage has not perished. It exists in the P???iya country even today. Some say that with the disappearance of the lute, the P??ar caste/lineage is ruined too. That is wrong.  But people of the P??ar caste/lineage live in small numbers in Maturai, Tirunelv?li, and C?tta?ku?am. Without an occupation, many are engaged in the job of tailoring." 
> 
> I have attached a table from Ludden (1996:123) showing the status of the P??a? in Tirunelveli district in 1823. (See page 5 of the attachment. The date of 1923 shown in the table title should actually be 1823.) One can see that they were small in number but part of the large 'Sudra' category.  So were barbers and washermen. None of them was/is an untouchable community.  That is why K. K. Pillay (1969: 208), while discussing the use of pulaitti in Classical Tamil texts to refer to the washerwoman, said, "It is not known how the term 'Pulaitti' came to be employed to denote her, because in later times the class of washermen was not identical with that of 'Pulaiyar'."
>  
> Many of the traditional upper caste Tamil pundits of the 20th century did not distinguish between hagiography and history. For them what the Periyapur??am and the Guruparampar? Prabhavam were presenting was history. They did not see these works as propagandist texts intended to promote a specific ideology. So these Tamil pundits believed that the P??ar were untouchables of earlier Tamil society. These Tamil teachers and especially Tamil teachers in northern Tamil Nadu did not know that Tamil P??ar have continued to exist as a community even today and are suffering no untouchability. 
> 
> Most of these Tamil pundits were not knowledgeable about the reality-based social information available in the inscriptions. For instance, they did not know that  the P??ar were engaged in singing in front of the deities in brahminic temples, training the temple women in music, and were given houses and money by royal order to perform these duties. See page 6 of the attachment for a translation of a 12th century inscription in the Tiruvi?aimarut?r temple by Orr (2000: 102).
> 
> Some scholars in Southern Tamil Nadu like Irakavan (1971:78-79) were sold on the Periyapuranam's promotional view that it was the egalitarian nature of the Bhakti movement that allowed the P??ar to enter temples. (On this score, the Periyapur??am had succeeded in its promotional objective.) They had failed to note that Paripatal 3, a pre-Bhakti-movement Classical Tamil poem, calls Visnu "a good P??a? of lute" in a poem that is full of Vedic and Puranic elements. As part of the poem's adoration of Vi??u, Parip??al 3: 81-86 offers the following praise:
> 
> "You are the red-eyed one with dark complexion (V?sudeva), the black-eyed and white complexioned one (Sankar?a?a), the golden complexioned one (Pradyumna), the green complexioned one (Aniruddha), the one who dances to the left and right (of cowherd girls), the one who dances with the pot, the one who has the plough, the one who is the lord of cowherds, the one who protects, the one whose nature is not being seen, the one who never leaves the devotee's thought, the one that never dies, the one who rules the world, the poet of ancient texts, the good P???? of lute..."

> One cannot imagine this if the P??a? were untouchable before the time of Tiru?anacampantar.
>  
> One can understand the traditional Tamil pundits' ahistorical view given their possibly limited exposure to historiography, anthropology, and comparative linguistics. But one would expect a US scholar with access to Western critical scholarship and other resources at Harvard University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and University of California, Berkeley to critically explore and evaluate facts.  Even after Orr (2000) published the translation of the Tiruvi?aimarut?r inscription shown in the attachment, Hart has not updated his views.
>  
> The facts that the Tamil Pa?aiyar were not untouchable even until 11th century and the P??ar are not untouchable even today completely invalidate Hart's theories regarding untouchability among ancient Tamils.  
> Moreover, if contact with a?a?ku, the sacred power, caused one to be polluted and become untouchable, T?vantikai, a brahmin woman in the Cilappatikaram, a post-ClassicalTamil epic, who got possessed by C?tta?, danced, and offered oracles would not have been appointed as a priestess by the king in a temple with Vedic sacrificial hall. (See http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2013-November/038692.html)
> 
> It is ironic that in order to buttress his views Hart is citing Dravidian Etymological Dictionary as if its groupings are true for all time and as if it gives etymological roots. He is incorrect on both counts. (Deriving etymological roots purely based on dictionary entries without considering the philological context can lead to wrong etymologies as in the case of Tamil ??v?r 'Vai??ava saint' (DEDR 396), which S. Starostin derives from *??-. See http://tinyurl.com/q64ko6e . But literary and epigraphic data clearly show that ??v?r 'Vai??ava saint' should be grouped with DEDR 5157. See http://www.linguist.jussieu.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/supa_9d.pdf for the reasons. Hart's discussion of pul as a root is just another example of the same kind of etymologizing.)  Dravidian Etymology Dictionary's author, Emeneau, would be the last person to hold such views. A good example of Emeneau's genuine open-minded scholarship can be seen in Emeneau (1988),  after the revised Dravidian Etymological Dictionary was published in 1984.

> Actually, there is quite a bit of evidence for caste ? and untouchability ? in Sangam literature.  It should be kept in mind that references to j?ti (and especially untouchability) in Indian classical k?vya and the like are not common.   Still, there are mentions of ?people of low birth,? pulaiya?s (= Dalits or other low castes) and other epithets implying low caste and status.  The groups receiving these appellations are leatherworkers, drummers (of two types), and washermen, among others.  According to the Tamil Lexicon, the word pulai means "baseness, uncleanness, defilement [incurred from contact with a ritually polluting substance or person], evil, animal food, outcaste, and stench.?  The root pul is in the DED. Among its meaning in various languages are Kannada pole meaning menstrual flow, impurity from childbirth, defilement, Ko?agu pole, pollution caused by menstruation, birth, or death, Tulu pol?, pollution, defilement, and, far afield, Brahui p?ling, stain, stain on one?s character. Most of the Southern languages have some equivalent for Tamil pulaiya?, man of low caste.

The Portuguese started using the term "casta" when they came to the southern part of Tamilnadu (in the 16-th century) and tried to learn Tamil and describe Tamil in Portuguese for the sake of further missionary activities. "Casta" was the term they used to describe the various groups of people they noticed in the local society. I happened to have the opportunity to work through the Portuguese manuscript (from 1549 A.D.), by Fr. Henrique Henriques, which describes Tamil in Portuguese. As a "Latin grammarian," Henriques had problems categorizing people's local names when doing the declensions. So ? when he lists a set of local names for the first declension, he says, "Names for occupations. Such nouns for occupations are also nouns of castes."  For further details, please see our book "The Earliest Missionary Grammar, Harvard University Press, 2013."
