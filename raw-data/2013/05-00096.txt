Dear Jonathan,
See Malamoud, Debts and Debtors. There is also a special issue of purushaartha on this topic.

I don't think the buddhists who wrote the vinayas were in a position to declare a jubilee year. That would be the perogative of the king.

I understand the question not to refer to spiritual debt, but to monetary debt, and the origins of the questions to probably be whether we find things comparable to the idea of the Jubilee, or the Biblical necessity to release Hebrew slaves after 7 years of service (the origin of the Sabbatical, by the way!), and the like (at least as far as I know, there is no such provision in pre-modern India for manumission).
