?oes anyone have or know of a scanned version of this volume?

*Indian Studies: In Honor of Charles Rockwell
Lanman<http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6731445M/Indian_studies_in_honor_of_Charles_Rockwell_Lanman.>
*(Harvard UP, Cambridge, Mass, 1929)*?*?

I've looked fruitlessly in local uni. library, archive.org, DLI, lirs.ru,
scribd, and Google Books.  It's been
scanned<http://books.google.at/books?id=AG41bwAACAAJ>at Google Books,
but isn't downloadable, even via a USA proxy.Same for Hathi
Trust <http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001058549>.  It's a collection
of classic pieces, quite widely-cited.

Best,
Dominik
