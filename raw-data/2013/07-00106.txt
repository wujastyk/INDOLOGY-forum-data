Dear all,

There is, of course, quite a bit of variation in scribal practices over
time and region; at various places and times there is documented evidence
of, or oblique references, to scribes working singly, collectively, with
reciters, and without reciters, and with the establishment of Islamicate
courts in northern India, ateliers on the model of the kar-khana.  There
were significant differences in practice between, say, monks working in a
temple or monastic institution, itinerant Kashmiri scribes that travelled
singly or in groups around northern India, copying texts for a fee, and
court 'scribes' (who were actually much more), who have received a good bit
of attention from O'Hanlon and Minkowski. The question of mass-produced
manuscripts is an interesting one that has received a little bit of
attention in the Jain context; some helpful sources on these and other
questions include:

Cort, John E. 1995. ?The Jain Knowledge Warehouses: Traditional Libraries
in India.? *Journal of the American Oriental Society* 115 (1): 10.

Data, Kali Kumar. 1971. ?The Ritual of Manuscripts.? *Our Heritage:
Bulletin of the Department of Post-Graduate Training and Research, Sanskrit
College, Calcutta *19 (1).

Losty, Jeremiah P. 1982. *The art of the book in India*. London: British
Library.

Data's article sites a number of texts that give normative prescriptions
for how a text used for ritual performance was to be copied.  Losty
discusses a period and genre of mass-produced stereotyped Jain manuscripts.

Most references are, unfortunately, terse and scattered.  For South Asia,
more work has been done on scribal practices among the Persianate elites;
for Europe the body of research is quite significant.

Best,
