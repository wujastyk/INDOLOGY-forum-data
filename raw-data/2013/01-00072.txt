To All,
        In course of studying Indology, I have developed an interest in getting  along with the similarities and dissimilarities of Hinduism and Buddhism. In light of the above,if anybody may refer me any book(s) on Buddhist Marriage rituals.
                 
   Thanking You                                        ALAKENDU DAS
