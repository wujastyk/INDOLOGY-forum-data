Dear Dominik, Not just Kaiya?a but also other commentators take *mleccha *of
*mleccho ha v? e?a yad apa?abda?* to be a derivate with *gha?* signifying a
karman.  And clearly they mean to derive the term from *mlech* with *gha?* in
accordance with *akartari ca k?rake sa?j??y?m*.  They also derive *mleccha* of
*mlecch? m? bh?ma* from the same base, but with agentive *ac*
(*nandigrahipac?dibhyo
lyu?inyaca?*).  Thus, *mleccha* refers first to a term (*?abda*) that is
indistinctly/incorrectly uttered, then to the speakers who utter such
indistinct terms.  Pata?jali explains that *apa?abda *refers to what is
commonly known as a mleccha.  That is, emphasis here is on incorrect speech
(*apa?abda*) in the phonic aspect, identified with the indistinct speech of
the Mleccha ('barbarian' if you will), as is clear from the
?atapathabr?hma?a passage comparable to the present Bh??ya passage. I think
The S?ktiratn?kara and others got this right.  The contested issue of the
syntax is, to my mind. not so clear as some have made it.
?[...]
I don't know whether this is an improvement, but it my two cents for the
moment.  Yours, George

I'm still nagging at what Kaiya?a means by "karma?i gha?".  My present best
idea is that he's invoking P.3.3.19 *akartari ca k?rake sa?j??y?m*.  This
implies an origin from *mlich*, which is odd, but can be ignored, I think.
So "*mleccha*" is the recipient of the action.  This may explain the future
pass. part. that N?ge?a uses, *nindy?* "to *be* blamed" (passive).  *Mleccha
* = "despicable", i.e., it is the *recipient* of criticism.  And P.3.3.19
makes "*mleccha*" a *sa?j??*, which is right too. (I don't believe that P.
meant *ca* to negate *sa?j??y?m*, even if this *gha?* is desired in non-*
sa?j??* cases.)

I hope someone can improve on this :-)

Dominik
