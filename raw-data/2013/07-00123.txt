Hi,

I've just signed the following petition "?Fair and Handsome? and Shah Rukh Khan: Take Down Discriminatory Ad. Lead the Change.  #disbcampaign " and wanted to see if you could help by adding your name.

Our goal is to reach 7,500 signatures and we need more support. You can read more and sign the petition here:
