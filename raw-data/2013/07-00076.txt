Dear Christophe,

if I am not mistaken, from 1899 to 1925 it was Francesco Lorenzo Pull? who was in charge of "Indo-European Philology" at the University of Bologna. A former student of Angelo De Gubernatis in Florence, Pull? had also studied with Albrecht Weber and Heinrich Kiepert in Berlin. 
He counted among his own students in Bologna several noteworthy scholars such as Luigi Suali, Ambrogio Ballini and Ferdinando Belloni Filippi.

Best,

Svevo D'Onofrio
