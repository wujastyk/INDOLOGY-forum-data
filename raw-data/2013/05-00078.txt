PS. I should add as a warning that in OSX 10.8 a serious bug appeared: the combination -rha- is no longer handled correctly in devanagari. So, if you want to type arhati [alt+a, r, f, h, t, i], you get arheti. I have already reported the problem to Apple some time ago, and they claim to be working on it.

I think -- and here my memory fails me -- I did it by first going to "Show Character Viewer" and the pressing the "Star" key at the top left. But now when I do this, it simply gives me the option of character sizes. Hope someone out there knows how to get to the uncommon ligatures feature, available both on Pages and TextEdit.
