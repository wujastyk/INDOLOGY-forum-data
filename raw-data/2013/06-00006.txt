*Call for paper*

*? Si les genres n?existaient pas et si nous n?en avions pas la ma?trise,
qu?il nous faille les cr?er pour la premi?re fois dans le processus de
parole, qu?il nous faille construire chacun de nos ?nonc?s, l??change
verbal serait quasiment impossible ?

(Bakthine, ?Esth?tique de la cr?ation verbale?, 1984)*

COLDOC 2013 aims to examine the notion of genre in a multidisciplinary
approach and to illustrate the variety of both theoretical and practical
problems it raises. We seek to articulate different perspectives on gender
issues and to contribute to identify an essential category for
interpretation.

Although it has long remained been considered to taxonomic approaches, the
issue of genre categorisation sees new developments thanks to the interest
it has raised in various humanities disciplines, gradually integrating
different aspects in their definitional approaches: contexts of utterance,
medium (written or spoken), language norms, social practices, etc. (see S.
Branca, ? Types, modes et genres entre langue et discours ?, Langage et
Soci?t? n?87, p. 5 -24, mars 1999).

This renewal is also expressed by the fact that the studies less
systematically seek to define it through production rules or classificatory
categories, but rather try to examine the question of genre through the
process of recognition and interpretation. Theoretical approaches and case
studies tend to focus on the addressee's point of view: horizons of
expectations, habits, cultural pre-conceptions, cognitive framework,
communication circuit, etc. The genre is then modeled as a set of
constraints or necessary conditions of meaning.

COLDOC 2013, bringing contributions from diverse backgrounds, aims to
review the state of the art and the diversity of work on genres. Relying on
theoretical and applied propositions, COLDOC 2013 aims to suggest new
descriptive categories needed in the search for meaning in written and oral
discourse. This 2013 edition of COLDOC therefore strongly encourages
participation from master students, PhD students candidates and young
researchers in general linguistics, corpus linguistics, diachronic
linguistics, sociolinguistics, didactic, computational linguistics (written
or speech) and, more generally, any area that would be interested in the
study of genres for itself or as a category of analysis.

Several issues - solely as examples - can be considered as sources of
inspiration. These issues, both theoretical and practical, highlight the
variety of possible approaches in the study of written and oral genres:

- Why categorize according to genres? How should boundaries between genres
be established?
- How should genres be defined, formalized and modeled?
- What are the dynamics implied in genre building?
- What are the implied relation(s) between ?genre? and ?linguistic
operations? (describe, summarize, tell)?
- Does genre influence grammatical phenomena?
- What are the sociolinguistic instantiations of genre?
- How can usage, variety and language registers linguistic variables become
genre-specific so
