I have not read Stietencron?s thesis. So I do not know if
he referred to the older account of the community available in Nagendra Nath
Basu?s Vanger j?t?ya itih?s ?Caste history of Bengal?,
Br?hma?akha??a (=Vol.1).
Basu has other writings on them, in English too, but these require corrections
and are not dependable.

I've discovered H. von Stietenkron's PhD, published in 1966, and Humbach's helpful review of it in the IIJ 12 (1969): 43-7.

Can anyone point me to some up-to-date information about ??kadv?p?ya brahmans?? What did it mean to a twelfth to seventeenth-century author to identify himself as belonging to a ??kadv?p?ya family?? Would such a family have retained cultural links to Central Asia and Eastern Iran, to Seistan?? I would have thought not.? But is there any scholarly exploration of this issue?
