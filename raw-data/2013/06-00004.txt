Yes. It should logically and histortically mean only Siva. For, we have 
an ancient verse aabout the origin of the Mahesvarasuutra-s that are the 
fundamental to the Sanskrit Grammar. The verse runs:
     nRttaavasaane naTaraajaraajaH nanaada DhakkaaM nava pa?cavaaram .
So Siva is not only NaTaraaja but naTaraajaraaja !!!
Also we find hundreds of images ... in stone , metal, etc. of NaTaraaja 
in all parts of the Bhaaratadesa.
The Saivasiddhanta philosophy attaches so much importance to the dance 
of Siva: the five divine acts (pa?cakRtya)--creation, maintenance, , 
etc. which Siva performs are all linked with each one of the objects 
that naTaraaja holds and with His divine eternal dance.
