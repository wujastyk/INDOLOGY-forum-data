Kane, HISTORY OF THE DHARMA ??STRA, VOL. II PART I, p. 82, Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute, Poona 1941

http://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/history_of_dharma_sastras.pdf

has this:


<<...the practice current in the times of the Ved?nta-s?tras that the ??dra
is not entitled to study the Veda.

Gaut. XII.4 went so far as to prescribe:?

?if the ??dra intentionally listens for committing to memory the Veda, then
his ears should be filled with (molten) lead and lac; if he utters the
Veda, then his tongue may be cut off; if he has mastered the Veda his body
should be hacked'.>>

Hoping it's of some help,

Regards,

Artur Karp
