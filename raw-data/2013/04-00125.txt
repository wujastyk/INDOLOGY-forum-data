Dear colleagues,

I am pleased to announce that the new journal *History of Science in South
Asia* <http://hssa.sayahna.org> has officially started publication with the
appearance of its first paper,

Bill M. Mak. "The transmission of Greek astral science into India
reconsidered - Critical remarks on the contents and the newly discovered
manuscript of the Yavanaj?taka." *History of Science in South
Asia*[Online], 1 (2013): 1-20.

HSSA publishes papers as soon as they are peer-reviewed, accepted, edited
and typeset.  Authors retain copyright of their work, and there are no fees
for authors for the next two years.  Articles are published under a
Creative Commons license, and are Open Access (free to download and read).

Many thanks to my colleagues on the editorial
board<http://hssa.sayahna.org/ojs/index.php/hssa/about/editorialTeam>,
and to the publishers, the Sayahna Foundation, for their support in
launching *History of Science in South Asia*.

Contributions are welcome!
