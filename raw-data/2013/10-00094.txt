Subject: [INDOLOGY] EAAA Conference---panel on reuse in visual and	performative arts in South Asia
Message-ID: <3C5B9D1C-0324-40A3-A689-163BCF47A33E@gmail.com>

Dear friends and respected colleagues,


After years of separate work on the topic of reuse (applied to texts,  
concepts and images, see the volume Re-Use 2012, edited by J.  
Hegewald; the panel on reuse at the 2013 DOT, and the one at the 2012  
CBC), we (Cristina Bignami, Elisa Freschi and Julia Hegewald) now  
joined forces to organize a panel for the next EAAA conference in  
September 2014 (http://www.ea-aaa.eu/). The provisional title is  
"Reuse at the Borders of South Asia: Himalayas and South India". If  
you have been working on the topic of reuse or are willing to work  
through this approach on South Indian or, preferably, Him?layan  
materials, contact us. However, please note that we need to send the  
panel proposal by November the 15th, thus we would need to get in  
touch with us as soon as possible and to receive your title and  
abstract (around 250 words) by November the 1st.
