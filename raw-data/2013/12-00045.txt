Dear Arlo,

In Oppert's edition of the Vaijayant? ??? occurs on p. 161 l. 57 (
https://archive.org/details/Vaijayanti). In his glossary he lists the
definition as "*m*, white washed upstair (sic) house." Later editions of
this ko?a should probably be consulted as I've found a number of
discrepancies between Oppert's text and citations in commentaries and the
commentators seem to have a superior reading.
