This reference had escaped me when I was writing on hymn 7.6 in my 2009 book on k???as 6 and 7 of the Paippal?dasa?hit?. I too would be interested in a pdf.

See also H.W. Bodewitz, "Atharvaveda Sa?hit? 3, 12: The Building of a House," ABORI Diamond Jubilee Volume (1977-78), 59-68.

My ILL department recently sent me an email back saying the article was unattainable, although I notice that numerous libraries possess the journal.  A pdf can be sent to: charlie_higgins at hotmail.com.
Thank you!!Charlie
