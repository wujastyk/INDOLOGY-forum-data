Subject: [INDOLOGY] How the software works (was: New Book information with (hopefully) readable attachment)
In-Reply-To: <CAKdt-CdvDMZ=-ptg_sG=5bHoapmz_LGMgZvGC3GfvyquAetTuA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cf055zUqQwzsqTDbhTrKNGjHb13e4q0e9jMppsDicuPCA@mail.gmail.com>

I have now expanded the list of attachment-types that Mailman will pass on
to INDOLOGY readers. I hope this works okay, and will be what everyone
wants.
Best,
Dominik
