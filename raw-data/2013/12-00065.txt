Francois,

Please hop in. The phrase is that the one who has wrong view holds that: "natthi yi??ham natthi hutam". Since yittham and hutam are past participles, one could take this to mean that s/he believes that there is nothing sacrificed (yajayati) and nothing offered (pp. of juhati). But given the fact that (as Falk has demonstrated) several Pali sutras show a detailed knowledge of Vedic sacrifice, I see no reason not to assume that the wrong view indicated here is one that denies Vedic yajna and (agni)hotra.

Joseph,

Sorry to hop in this thread as a vedicist, but how would you (or your sources?) define "yajna" and "hotara".

Do you mean "sacrifice" (yaj;n;a-) and the "Hot.rs", i.e. officiants (from the plural hot;aara.h)?

When I look at the Nikayas and the Agamas, I notice a handful (less than 10) of very carefully worded critiques of sacrifice -- some of which appear to be quite close to criticisms that brahmanical communities were already making. On the other hand, the rejection of yajna and hotara defined as wrong view can be found in the following sutras DN 23 MN 60, 76, 110, 114, 117 AN 3.117, 3.118, 3.119, 10.176, 10.211, 10.212, and 10.217 (sorry no page numbers, I cut this from my notes). I do not disagree with you that rejection of Vedic sacrifice BECAME important for some Buddhist communities later. But to say that from the time of the Buddha onward there was a blanket rejection of Vedic sacrifice across the board by all Buddhists on the basis of a few sutras assumes that all communities used all the sutras that are available to us now. It seems more likely that the anti-brahmanical sutras were enjoyed by non-brahmin communities and that communities of Brahmin Buddhists wouldn't pay much attention to them.
