Dear list members,
due to a technical problem, the catalogue of the GRETIL e-library is not available at present. This problem pertains to all online catalogues of the G?ttingen library.
Our technical staff may need up to 10 days for repair


ALTERNATIVE SEARCH:
You can search and download the e-books via the central catalogue of the GBV.
Please, use the following addresses:

SEARCH FOR TITLES:
http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/LNG=EN/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&IKT=1016&SRT=YOP&TRM=ser+gretil+and+tit

SEARCH FOR AUTHORS:
http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/LNG=EN/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&IKT=1016&SRT=YOP&TRM=ser+gretil+and+per

Both queries will first return ALL titles of the GRETIL e-library, sorted according to year of publication in reverse order. You can browse the entire collection from this first screen.



SEARCH FOR A SPECIFIC AUTHOR / TITLE:
Click into the "search" field, steer the cursor to the end of the above query -- i.e., behind "tit", resp., "per" --, enter a blank and then the title / author, optionally truncated with *

Example for "per":
http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/LNG=EN/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&IKT=1016&SRT=YOP&TRM=ser+gretil+and+per+somadev*

Example for "tit"
http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/LNG=EN/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&IKT=1016&SRT=YOP&TRM=ser+gretil+and+tit+kathasarits*


IF A LIST WITH MORE THAN ONE TITLE IS RETURNED,
select one with a click to open the screen with the title data.


WHEN YOU SEE THE CATALOGUE DATA OF THE SELECTED TITLE
go to the bottom of the screen and click on the "+" next to "G?ttingen".
This will lead you to the usual download links.


Regards,
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
