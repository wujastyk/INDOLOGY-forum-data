Hello George,

Thank you for passing this on.  I think that I may have seen this news when
it first came out.  Perhaps it was mentioned on the list.  However, the
article, in its header, dates the writing to the 4th cent. BCE, whereas in
the body of the article Rajan is quoted as dating it to the 3rd or 2nd
centuries BCE.

Do we know more now, more than a year later?

George T
