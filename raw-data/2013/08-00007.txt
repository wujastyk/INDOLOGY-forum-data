Subject: [INDOLOGY] "Why digital humanists should get out of textual	scholarship"
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdiG_Hcw5LvT2VieMvgvUk0oxFAiA40E903niDKwtL_-w@mail.gmail.com>

If you are interested in making critical editions, I warmly recommend the
following conference presentation by Peter Robinson, as an iconoclastic and
stimulating read.  It's only 4.5 pages, but makes crucial points.

"What digital humanists don?t know about scholarly editing; what
scholarly editors
don?t know about the digital world."

"An edition is an argument about a text."
