Friend:

I am trying to identify two citations, one apparently from a sm?ti and the other from a Vedic text. These are found in Vi?var?pa's commentary on the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti, 1.7 (Trivandrum edition, p. 20). These are cited by an opponent supporting the independent authority of sm?tis: tasm?t sv?tantrya? sm?t?n?m ity uktam. Then follows the citations:

1. tath? c?ha: "agranthak?n?m arth?n?? cak?ropanibandhanam."

2. ?mn?ya? ca "yady ukto bh?r" ity?dy upakramya "yaju??as s?mata" ity uktv?, "yady avij??tam" ity ?ha.

Then he cites a samprad?ya: sm?rta? c?vij??tam iti sa?prad?ya?.

Any help in locating these would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.

Patrick
