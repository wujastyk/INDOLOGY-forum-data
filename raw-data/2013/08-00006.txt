Subject: [INDOLOGY] Study on JAOS
Message-ID: <51FB5DFD.5060004@ifpindia.org>

Dear Sir,

I am interested to study on /indologists impact on Journal of the 
American Oriental Society for the period of 2003 to 2012/.
Apart from WoS, is anybody come across literature on this subject? 
Kindly let me know.

Thanks
