Patrick,

The phrasing devo var.sati / vassati is common in Skt and Pali. deva-var.sa should be a noun based on it. Does a meaning like 'rain, shower' fit your context?

The Sm?ticandrik? at one place explains the need to put down the "var?a" in a document as "devavar?amity?di". I do not know what "devavar?a" could be. It is not one of the 60 names of the Jupiter Cycle. Any help will be deeply appreciated. Thanks.
