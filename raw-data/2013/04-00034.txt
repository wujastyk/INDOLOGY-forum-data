This is a stunningly beautiful volume.  It is important that we take note
that this work has been made available under a Creative Commons License,
and thus see all that can be accomplished through this sort of publishing.
I hope more of us will be able to move in this direction, and remove
ourselves from the limitations (intellectual and economic) of traditional
publishing.
