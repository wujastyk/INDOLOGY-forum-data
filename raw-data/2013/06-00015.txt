has succeeded in attracting major funding from the National Endowment for
the Humanities and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

Profs. Sheldon Pollock (Columbia, New York) and Birgit Kellner (Heidelberg)
applied to a
?bilateral USA-German funding program for the development of digital
humanities.  The application was a success, and the announcement can be
read on the NEH
website<http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/announcing-4-nehdfg-bilateral-digital-humanities-program-awards>
.

The SARIT website notes that,

 The history of SARIT looks back to a meeting convened by Prof. Richard
> Lariviere at the University of Texas in 1988 that brought together many
> specialists interested in creating a "TLG <http://www.tlg.uci.edu/> for
> Indic," i.e., a corpus of machine-readable texts in Indian languages. The minutes
> of that meeting<http://www.academia.edu/360194/Report_on_the_Sanskrit_Text_Archive_Conference_Austin_Texas_October_28-29_1988>still make interesting reading today, and lay out some of the rationales
> underlying the present project. [...] Things have moved forward since 1988,
> especially in corpus linguistics, computer networking, and encoding
> standards. SARIT takes advantage of all these new developments, especially
> Unicode, XML and the Text Encoding Initiative.


Prof. Pollock and I both attended the 1988 meeting in Texas, and the
present project will go a large way towards fulfilling the ideas that were
born then.

I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the fine work of other
corpus projects in our field of indology, such as the Digital Sanskrit
Buddhist Canon, the DCS, Muktabodha, Indica & Buddhica, the Sanskrit
Library, and especially of course GRETIL and TITUS.  All these projects
have great strengths, and afford important new ways of accessing and
studying Indian literatures.  SARIT will
??
make its own unique contribution.
