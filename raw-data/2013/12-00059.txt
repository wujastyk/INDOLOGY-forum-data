Just to add to the point. The designation Nastika shows up in the Pali canon, but it means something quite different from the usage Nicholson discusses. [Excellent discussion, btw.] The Nastika is one who denies the existence of karma and the efficacy of yajna and hotara, among other things. Under this categorization, "Hindus" and Buddhists would both be astikas and the lokayatas would be nastikas.  I am thinking the borderline between Buddhism and Hinduism was drawn (incompletely) around the time of the Puranas and didn't catch on everywhere. I think it likely that the distinction was still being solidified by the time of Vijnanabhiksu.

Dear Aleksandar and Howard,

Thanks for your interest in the topic of my book.

In the Puranas there is certainly plenty of vilification of certain
groups--Jainas, Bauddhas, Kapalikas, and Pasupatas among them. But in
first-millenium Puranas there is not yet any clear binary
classification of two groups of sects along astika/nastika or
Vedic/anti-Vedic lines. It seems the first clear expression of this
binary occurs in Krsnamisra's comedic play Prabodhacandrodaya (late
11th c.). By the 14th century, this way of classifying groups has
become the dominant discourse.

In the concluding chapter I offer some possibilities for how and why
this shift occurred. But no spoilers here--you'll have to buy the
book!

Best,
Andrew

With Sanatana and Jiva Goswamis, we see a worldview of progress towards Krishna in which advaitins fit, though not high on the ladder, but not Buddhist, Jains etc. This seems similar to what Vijnanabhiksu and Madhusudana were doing, with the order reversed. Brihad-Bhagavatamrita does read like a project of "Unifying Hinduism" if we have in view the milieu in which it was written -- Jains were not gone, Muslims were the rulers, sometimes even temple patrons, but they are not "on the way to Krishna". There is, in other words, an attempt of delimiting the borders of the orthodox.

We do have five occurences of 'brahma-nirvana', along with frequent, almost proto-Sankara references to Brahman, such as 13.31: "When one perceives that the state of separate beings stands as one, just from that one then advances to the brahman expansion."

Do we see such schemes before the 16th century? If not, the question is, what has changed to allow for such a paradigm.

>>> Thus for centuries there has been strong tension, and theological battles, between on the one hand the unifying Hindu view, including what Halbfass called the "Neo-Hindu" thought of Vivekananda, Radhakrishnan etc, with their roots in Sankara et all, and on the other hand the various Vaishnava traditions including the Sri Vaishnava followers of Ramanuja, the Dvaita-vadi followers of Madhva, and the Gaudiya Vaishnava followers of Caitanya.

>>> Some postcolonial theorists argue that the idea of a single system of belief known as "Hinduism" is a creation of nineteenth-century British imperialists. Andrew J. Nicholson introduces another perspective: although a unified Hindu identity is not as ancient as some Hindus claim, it has its roots in innovations within South Asian philosophy from the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries. During this time, thinkers treated the philosophies of Vedanta, Samkhya, and Yoga, along with the worshippers of Visnu, Siva, and Sakti, as belonging to a single system of belief and practice. Instead of seeing such groups as separate and contradictory, they re-envisioned them as separate rivers leading to the ocean of Brahman, the ultimate reality.
>>>
>>> Drawing on the writings of philosophers from late medieval and early modern traditions, including Vijnanabhiksu, Madhava, and Madhusudana Sarasvati, Nicholson shows how influential thinkers portrayed Vedanta philosophy as the ultimate unifier of diverse belief systems. This project paved the way for the work of later Hindu reformers, such as Vivekananda, Radhakrishnan, and Gandhi, whose teachings promoted the notion that all world religions belong to a single spiritual unity. In his study, Nicholson also critiques the way in which Eurocentric concepts?like monism and dualism, idealism and realism, theism and atheism, and orthodoxy and heterodoxy?have come to dominate modern discourses on Indian philosophy.
