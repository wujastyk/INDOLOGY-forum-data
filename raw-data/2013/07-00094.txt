It is more regrettable because in 1984 I had raised the issue of a Brahmana based interpretation of the Vedic ritual against one based on the mantras cited in the Srautasuutras. The Brhat and Rathantara were the illustrations where a Brahmana based interpretation could be misleading. Please see Mythological and ritual symbolism SPB Calcutta 1984:137-138. I caution you that Klaus Mylius wrongly remarked that I had taken the idea of a sutra based interpretation from Renou. You will yourself see the difference from Renou. I have no hesitation in saying that both Mylius (JIP 1989) and Karel Werner (JRAS 1987) were disappointed that they could not determine what I my intention was. I admit my short comings, but your question will be answered.

>> Thanks to the Br?hma?a obsession with making correlations/identifications/correspondences, you can get some idea of what the B?hat represents in the Veda by examining the entities with which it is correlated. The B?hat and Rathantara are treated as a pair in some of these passages, so that you also get an idea of the entities to which each is opposed. For example (PB 7.6.17, trans. Caland): B is the mind, R  voice; B is the melody, R the verse; B is expiration, R is inspiration; B is yonder world, R is this world. 
>> Caland's translation of the Pa?cavi??a-Br?hma?a has an index of s?man names, so you can easily find all the passages that mention B?hat. The Jaimin?ya-Br?hma?a also has a lot to say about the B?hat; an accessible example is in Caland's Das Jaimin?ya-Br?hma?a in Auswahl ? 25 (p32).
