At last I found my copy of the latest commentary:

?r?mad?nandat?rthabhagavatp?daviracita? citrak?vya? 
?r?mah?bh?ratat?tparyyam. ?r?naraharit?rthaviracitay? 
?r?k???aprak??ikay? ?c?ryagovindaviracitay? ?r?k???acandrikay? sahitam. 
[Sasa?hitap??ha? sapadap??ha? ca.] ?odhayit?-samp?dayit? 
Banna?jepadoh?hva ?c?ryagovinda?. [Mah?bh?rata-t?tparyam. By 
Ananda-Thirtha-bhagavat-pada; with ?r?-K???a-Prak??ik?, a commentary by 
Sri-Narahari-Thirtha and ?r?-K???a-Candrikay? by Bannanje 
Govindacharya.] Udupi / Bangalore: ???v?sya-prati??h?na, 2006. Price Rs. 
80. With an introduction and six appendices. (Distributors: Bannanje 
Associates, ???v?syam, Ambalapadi, Udupi - 576103.

The book is entirely in Sanskrit, edited and commented by the editor of 
the m?lap??ha of Madhva's collected works (with whom an interview 
appeared, in Sanskrit, in the M?nchener Indologische Zeitschrift I 
(2008/09) - see http://www.manyaverlag.de/miz-I.html and a sample 
http://www.manyaverlag.de/mizproben/MIZ-I-Interview.pdf).

Govindacharya also pubhished a short study in Kannada on the textual 
criticism by Madhva in the Mah?bh?rata-t?tparya: Vidy?v?caspati Banna?je 
G?vind?c?rya. Mah?bh?rata t?tparya nir?aya. Era?u upany?saga?u. Udupi: 
R???rakavi G?vinda Pai Sa???dhana K??dra, 1993.

Hope this helps,
