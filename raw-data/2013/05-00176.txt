Dear friends and colleagues,

I would like to draw your attention to the most recent number (vol. 50, no.
2) of the Indian Economic and Social History Review, a special issue
devoted to Kalha?a's R?jatara?gi?? and its successors.   It may be of
interest to some members of the list,

Yours, with best wishes,

Whitney
