>> The history of SARIT looks back to a meeting convened by Prof. Richard Lariviere at the University of Texas in 1988 that brought together many specialists interested in creating a "TLG for Indic," i.e., a corpus of machine-readable texts in Indian languages. The minutes of that meeting still make interesting reading today, and lay out some of the rationales underlying the present project. [...] Things have moved forward since 1988, especially in corpus linguistics, computer networking, and encoding standards. SARIT takes advantage of all these new developments, especially Unicode, XML and the Text Encoding Initiative.

All these projects have great strengths, and afford important new ways of accessing and studying Indian literatures.  SARIT will ??make its own unique contribution.
