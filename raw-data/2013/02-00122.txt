Dear colleagues,



It is my pleasure to announce the publication of the following edited volume:



Little Buddhas: Children and Childhoods in Buddhist Texts and Traditions Edited by Vanessa R. Sasson



ISBN13: 9780199945610ISBN10: 0199945616

Paperback, 552 pages



Description:

Consideration of children in the academic field of Religious Studies is taking root, but Buddhist Studies has yet to take notice. Little Buddhas brings together a wide range of scholarship and expertise to address the question of what role children have played in Buddhist literature, in particular historical contexts, and what role they continue to play in specific Buddhist contexts today. The volume is divided into two parts, one addressing the representation of children in Buddhist texts, the other children and childhoods in Buddhist cultures around the world. The ground-breaking contributions in this volume challenge the perception of irreconcilable differences between Buddhist idealism and family ties. Little Buddhas will be an indispensable resource for students and scholars of Buddhism and Childhood Studies, and a catalyst for further research on the topic.
