Actually, there is quite a bit of evidence for caste ? and untouchability ? in Sangam literature.  It should be kept in mind that references to j?ti (and especially untouchability) in Indian classical k?vya and the like are not common.   Still, there are mentions of ?people of low birth,? pulaiya?s (= Dalits or other low castes) and other epithets implying low caste and status.  The groups receiving these appellations are leatherworkers, drummers (of two types), and washermen, among others.  According to the Tamil Lexicon, the word pulai means "baseness, uncleanness, defilement [incurred from contact with a ritually polluting substance or person], evil, animal food, outcaste, and stench.?  The root pul is in the DED. Among its meaning in various languages are Kannada pole meaning menstrual flow, impurity from childbirth, defilement, Ko?agu pole, pollution caused by menstruation, birth, or death, Tulu pol?, pollution, defilement, and, far afield, Brahui p?ling, stain, stain on one?s character. Most of the Southern languages have some equivalent for Tamil pulaiya?, man of low caste. 

An example is Pu?am 287.1, ?O Pulaiya? who beats the tu?i drum, O low one (i?ici?a) who [holds] sticks that strike [the drum].?
???? ??????? ?????!
??????? ???????? ??????!

Another example is Pu?am 360:

When people have been carried on the bier                                                                                               15
to the burning ground, that fearful place of desolation,
that salty wasteland overgrown with spurge, site of what
is other than life, and they lie there on grass, receiving toddy
and a few grains of rice at the command of outcaste Pulaiya?,
and then they have entered the mouth of fire,                                                                                           20
for many of these who ate and grew fat no fame has flourished!

(Note that ?outcaste? is added here for clarity).

??????? ????? ???????, ????

Palaniyappan, who believes there was no caste in Sangam times, has argued that the word pulai comes from poli, ?shine? and has positive connotations, but this does not accord with the DED or the uses of the word in other Dravidian languages.

The entry s.v. in the Madras Tamil Lexicon reads (with my transliteration and bracketed translations):

The Portuguese started using the term "casta" when they came to the southern part of Tamilnadu (in the 16-th century) and tried to learn Tamil and describe Tamil in Portuguese for the sake of further missionary activities. "Casta" was the term they used to describe the various groups of people they noticed in the local society. I happened to have the opportunity to work through the Portuguese manuscript (from 1549 A.D.), by Fr. Henrique Henriques, which describes Tamil in Portuguese. As a "Latin grammarian," Henriques had problems categorizing people's local names when doing the declensions. So ? when he lists a set of local names for the first declension, he says, "Names for occupations. Such nouns for occupations are also nouns of castes."  For further details, please see our book "The Earliest Missionary Grammar, Harvard University Press, 2013."

For example, if anyone seriously wants to study the history of "castes" or any such thing, one should also look at all their entries beginning with the root/stem of the word. Just for fun, try all the words starting with the stem "ku?i," and you'll see that words such as "ku?imaka?," "ku?imakka?," and so on don't have contiguous semantics.
