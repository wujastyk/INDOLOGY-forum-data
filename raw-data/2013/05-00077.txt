Dear Patrick,

when in TextEdit:

1. choose cmd + T
2. go to typography via the gearwheel (down left)
3. open "ligatures"
4. now you may choose between different options.

Best wishes,
Sven

I think -- and here my memory fails me -- I did it by first going to "Show Character Viewer" and the pressing the "Star" key at the top left. But now when I do this, it simply gives me the option of character sizes. Hope someone out there knows how to get to the uncommon ligatures feature, available both on Pages and TextEdit.
