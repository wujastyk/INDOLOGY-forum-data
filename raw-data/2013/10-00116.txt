When I started to study Sanskrit in Milan at the end of the 90's, it was 
also taught in transliteration, since the course for Sanskrit was also 
mainly thought for students of Classics or Indo-European  Linguistics 
(Glottologia), and Devanagari was introduced olny in the second year, 
and only for those interested in Sanskrit as a main subject. I do not 
know about the current situation, but speaking with other Italian 
colleagues of my generation, the overall impression I got is that if the 
Sanskrit course is taught within a Faculty or Department for Oriental 
Studies or something similar, then you start learning Devanagari 
immediately, but if the Chair for Sanskrit is within a Department for 
Ancient Studies or Linguistics, then you learn Sanskrit in 
transliteration.
