Subject: [INDOLOGY] dvandvas
Message-ID: <52926AE5.7070704@gmx.de>

Dear list,

a very basic question about Sanskrit syntax: Are dvandvas, in 
traditional Sanskrit grammar, considered to be inherently binary, which 
means that dvandvas consisting of n>2 words should be bracketed by (n-1) 
brackets when constructing a dependency tree?

Ex.:
kaTutiktakashAyaushadha = "a herb that is kaTu, tikta and kashaya"

Should a dependency tree constructed from this expression look like ...
a. ((((kaTu + tikta)[dvandva] + kashAya)[dvandva]) + aushadha)[...] = 
"nested" dvandva
or like
b. ((kaTu + tikta + kashAya)[dvandva] + aushadha)[...]

Any comment is welcome!

Best regards, Oliver Hellwig
