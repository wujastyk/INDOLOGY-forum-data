Dear Victor and Adheesh,

Thank you so much for your quick response!

I noticed on Worldcat that there is a book with the same title by Bergaigne that is 109 pages. Would you know anything about that longer version?

It's available on Persee <http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/crai_0065-0536_1888_num_32_3_69484> , but I attached a copy in case others have a problem accessing the site.

All the Best,
Victor

Does anybody have a scan of the following?



Bergaigne, Abel, (1889) Recherches sur l'histoire de la liturgie ve?dique. La forme me?trique des hymnes du Rig-Ve?da.



I have checked archive.org<http://archive.org> and google books with no luck. I have also tried to get it through ILL, but am told that no one will lend it.



Thanks,
