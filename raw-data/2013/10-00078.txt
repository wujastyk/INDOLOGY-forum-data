Dear Arlo:

Indeed, I transcribed the text wrong -- your reading is correct. Dharmaja appears to be a kind of "ordeal" or oath to determine the guilt or innocence of a litigant. This is because the verdict is born out of dharma -- the judge writes "dharma" on one leaf and "adharma" on another, and the man has to pick one of them. If he picks "dharma" he is innocent!! Best,

Patrick

But now it seems to me his reasoning, or that of his source, must have been that this group of 5 mantras, in its ?gveda version (10.57), reads as p?da 5c j?va? vr?ta? sacemahi. The connection with j?vad?na seems forced.

Does anyhone happen to know parallels for it, does anybody have a suggestion on what the significance of the suffix -ka might be here, and is there any convincing way to estimate the date of this little text (presuming that the B?haspatism?ti is a composite text)? Could anyone supply a pdf of K.V. Rangaswami Aiyangar's volume Gaekwad Oriental Series, 85 (B?haspatism?ti Reconstructed, 1941)?

I should much appreciate references to or discussions of j?vad?na in the primary of and secondary literature on Dharma??stra.
