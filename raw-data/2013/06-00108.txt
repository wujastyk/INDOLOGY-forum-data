Using Harvard Kyoto transliteration:? kSIra can mean milk, milky sap, water or a milk dish. The Hindi word KhIr for rice pudding comes from this word.

I believe khir is Skt kshira (I haven't figured out how to do diacriticals on Indology yet).

Other examples of Bengali simplifying Sanskrit consonant clusters, specifically?ksh to kh:

Parikshit -- Parikhit

Kshetra -- Khetra

Bengali also sometimes simplifies Skt consonant clusters by adding a vowel: ?bhakta -- bhakata

Best,
Howard
