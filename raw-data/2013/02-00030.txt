Dear colleagues,
It is my painful task to convey the message that Professor A.K. Warder has passed away. We all know his extensive contribution to Indological scholarship such as his monumental 8-volume study of Indian K?vya Literature (Motilal Banarsidass, 1972-2011), his well known Indian Buddhism (1st pub. 1970; 3rd revised edition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2000), as well as his other books on Buddhism, Indian philosophy and Indian literature, not to mention his first two books Pali Metre: A Contribution to the History of Indian Literature (Pali Text Society, 1967) and   Introduction to Pali (Pali Text Society, 1963; 3rd revised edition, 2005).  

A funeral service for him and for his wife Nargez will take place at 11 a.m. on Friday 15 February 2013, at Turner & Porter Funeral Home, 2357 Bloor Street, West, Toronto (viewing from 10.00 a.m.); with interment afterwards at St. John's Dixie Cemetery, 737 Dundas Street East, Mississauga, Ontario.
