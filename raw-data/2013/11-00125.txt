Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bhikkhu Jinananda (Phd SOAS 1953): supervised by	Dorothy A. L. Stede
Message-ID: <C2479335-781E-402D-860E-36B152B43695@mcmaster.ca>

Dear list members,

I write to thank list members for their responses on and off list regarding the supervisor of Bhikkhu Jinananda at SOAS in 1953. After several e-mails to the Registry at SOAS, it turns out that Jinananda was supervised by Dr. D. Stede. I take this to be Dorothy A. L. Stede, daughter of William Stede, former president of the Pali Text Society. Dorothy seems to have married and taken the name Maskell. She seems to have died in 1956.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Shayne Clarke
