Dear Indologists,

I have been trying to find out the meaning of 'ch?y?puru?a' in the context of T?ntric texts. Monier Williams simply says 'Puru?a in the form of a shadow' and Apte does not mention it. How do I understand the expressions like ch?y?puru?opade?avidbhi? (Tantr?loka-viveka-3.5ab) or ch?y?puru?opade?apari??lanena (??varapratyabhij??-viv?ti-vimar?in?, Vol.1, p. 159) or ch?y?puru?apar?k??y?mityarth?t (Svacchandatantra-udyota 7.267)? Who are considered to be the learned people in the teachings of ch?y?puru?a (ch?y?puru?a-vid) ? I should be grateful if someone can guide me to the right sources or throw some light on 'ch?y?puru?a'. You can also write to me off-list. Thanks very much in advance.

Best wishes.

Mrinal Kaul
