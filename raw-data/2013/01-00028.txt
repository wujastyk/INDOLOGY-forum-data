Dear List,

A mistake (among the joint signers) has unfortunately crept into my
previous message. I should have written the following:

Dear List,

Please find attached to this message the announcement for the second
workshop-cum-conference "Archaeology of Bhakti" organised from July
31st to August 13th 2013 in the EFEO centre at Pondicherry by Val?rie
Gillet (EFEO, Pondicherry), Charlotte Schmid (EFEO, Paris) and myself.
A dedicated webpage is under construction on the EFEO website, but
registration is already open.
Please circulate the information.

Best wishes.

Emmanuel Francis (CNRS, CEIAS, Paris)
Val?rie Gillet (EFEO, Pondicherry)
Charlotte Schmid (EFEO, Paris)
