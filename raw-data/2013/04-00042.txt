Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help us to obtain ayurvedic plant material
Message-ID: <003d01ce3688$6bf42e60$43dc8b20$@gmail.com>

Dear list members,

 

We are looking for help to obtain ayurvedic plant material.

 

We are preparing a photographic atlas of Ayurvedic plants, the main author
of which will be Jan Meulenbeld. We already have a good collection of whole
plants and plant parts (roots, leaves, stems, seeds, et cetera), but  we
could use more material.  So we are asking you for your assistance in
finding more.

 

We are looking for people who would want to visit a local  trade shop in
India for ayurvedic plants, and buy small but representative quantities of
as many whole plants and plant parts as you can from a list that we will
provide. The list contains a few hundred plant names in Hindi. You could
actually just hand over the list to the shop owner, ask him what he has in
stock, and buy small quantities of everything he has avaliable. Then you
would send the whole package to our man  in India who will ship everything
to us. 

 

It is important to keep in mind that we do not ask you to botanically
identify the plants or for any other expert judgement:  we do not mind at
all to receive plants that are misidentified or sold as an adulturant,
because that would be useful information too.

 

Of course we will reimburse all expenses incurred. And you will receive a
free copy of the Ayurvedic plant atlas, which will appear in 2014! For more
information about our plant atlases and handbooks, see www.plantatlas.eu
<http://www.plantatlas.eu> . 

 

If you want to help us or want more info from us before you make a decision,
please send an email to Roelf Barkhuis, info at barkhuis.nl
<mailto:info at barkhuis.nl> . 

 

Hoping to hear from you soon,

 

Jan Meulenbeld, Ren? Cappers, Roelf Barkhuis
