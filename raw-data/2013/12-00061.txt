Dear Andrew,

I just wanted to point out, in case you haven?t considered it, R?ja?ekhara?s (early tenth C.) discussion of anv?k?ik? in his K?vyam?m??s? chapter 2, in which he states that the p?rvapak?a consists of ?Jain and Buddhist schools, as well as the Lok?yatas (arhadbhadantadar?ane lok?yata? ca)? while the uttarapak?a consists of ?S??khya and Ny?ya-Vai?e?ika (s??khya? ny?yavai?e?ikau).? 

Seems to me to be a clear binary (and hierarchical) distinction between the two groups, though admittedly it?s in the realm of logical debate (tarka) rather than belief/religion. But perhaps there is something to it?

All best wishes,
Adheesh

With Sanatana and Jiva Goswamis, we see a worldview of progress towards Krishna in which advaitins fit, though not high on the ladder, but not Buddhist, Jains etc. This seems similar to what Vijnanabhiksu and Madhusudana were doing, with the order reversed. Brihad-Bhagavatamrita does read like a project of "Unifying Hinduism" if we have in view the milieu in which it was written -- Jains were not gone, Muslims were the rulers, sometimes even temple patrons, but they are not "on the way to Krishna". There is, in other words, an attempt of delimiting the borders of the orthodox.

We do have five occurences of 'brahma-nirvana', along with frequent, almost proto-Sankara references to Brahman, such as 13.31: "When one perceives that the state of separate beings stands as one, just from that one then advances to the brahman expansion."

Do we see such schemes before the 16th century? If not, the question is, what has changed to allow for such a paradigm.

Indeed the greatest Vaishanva Vedantists, including Ramanuja, Madhva, and Baladeva, explicitly sought to refute the notion that all paths lead as rivers into the ocean of Brahman, unless by that one meant Krishna as param brahman (Gita 10.12)

>>>> Some postcolonial theorists argue that the idea of a single system of belief known as "Hinduism" is a creation of nineteenth-century British imperialists. Andrew J. Nicholson introduces another perspective: although a unified Hindu identity is not as ancient as some Hindus claim, it has its roots in innovations within South Asian philosophy from the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries. During this time, thinkers treated the philosophies of Vedanta, Samkhya, and Yoga, along with the worshippers of Visnu, Siva, and Sakti, as belonging to a single system of belief and practice. Instead of seeing such groups as separate and contradictory, they re-envisioned them as separate rivers leading to the ocean of Brahman, the ultimate reality.
>>>> 
>>>> Drawing on the writings of philosophers from late medieval and early modern traditions, including Vijnanabhiksu, Madhava, and Madhusudana Sarasvati, Nicholson shows how influential thinkers portrayed Vedanta philosophy as the ultimate unifier of diverse belief systems. This project paved the way for the work of later Hindu reformers, such as Vivekananda, Radhakrishnan, and Gandhi, whose teachings promoted the notion that all world religions belong to a single spiritual unity. In his study, Nicholson also critiques the way in which Eurocentric concepts?like monism and dualism, idealism and realism, theism and atheism, and orthodoxy and heterodoxy?have come to dominate modern discourses on Indian philosophy.
