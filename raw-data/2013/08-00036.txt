Subject: [INDOLOGY] "vIraka"
Message-ID: <CAFZJJzH44KhKLENLD-oVdKDTo4zq5X+awxe18esOxg7zNxRb_w@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks to all of the Indological sleuths who responded to my query,
both on- and off-list. The collective knowledge of the scholars here
is astounding.

I should have mentioned that Kurma Purana 2.7.7 includes "vIrANAM
vIrabhadro 'haM." It therefore seems a little less likely to me that
"gaNeSAnAM ca vIrakaH" only three verses later at 2.7.10 would be a
repeated reference to Virabhadra. However, the identification of
Viraka with the half-bull, half-man form of Nandin, suggested by Drs.
Roebuck and T?rzs?k, makes a lot of sense.

Based on your responses, it also seems there is a dissertation waiting
to be written on the mythology and iconography of Nandin/Viraka. If
someone can point me to an article on Nandin that discusses this
humanoid form, I'd be grateful.

My annotated translation of the Isvara Gita (Kurma Purana 2.1-2.11),
including this verse about vIraka, will be available from SUNY Press
in 2014.

All the best,
Andrew
