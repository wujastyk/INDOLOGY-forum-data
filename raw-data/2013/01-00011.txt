Dear All, 

Exactly one year from now, we will continue with our tradition of holding Vedic workshops (1989-).

This time in the ideal location of Kerala, whose great Vedic traditions were brought to our attention by the work of the late Frits Staal, especially through his help in organizing the 1975 Agnicayana (J.F. Staal, Agni 1983).

We will meet in Kozhikode (Cochin), and we will organize several excursions to nearby locations of traditional Veda teaching and rituals.
Please note that Kozhikode has easy, direct airline connections to international destinations.

For details please see below, and:  < http://www.ivw2014.org>

Hope seeing you then!
