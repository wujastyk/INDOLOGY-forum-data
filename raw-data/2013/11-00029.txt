Message-ID: <CEA913CA.E2B4%rdavidson@fairfield.edu>

Dear List members,

I wonder if anyone would have an available pdf of Fleet?s Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and their Successors, CII vol. 3 (1888 with several reprints)? I would prefer one of the later reprints, as I understand there are further observations included, but not the Bhandarkar, Chhabra and Gai revised version of 1981, which is entirely different.

Thanking you in advance for your kindness,

Ronald Davidson
