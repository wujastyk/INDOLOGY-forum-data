Dear Dr. Voegeli,

maybe this is of a little help for your search:

Nindowari (also called Nindo Damb) [Nindo 24?38'15.8388''N 69?
2'27.4603''E]

Jhukar 26?11'15.8654''N 68?19'17.8064''E

Lohumjo-daro (Lohumjo-daro, near Piaro Goth [railway station 26?
56'54.7472''N 67?48'54.5742''E], not far from the bank of the Indus,
sixty miles to the south of Mohenjo-daro)

Kayatha (Kaytha Village  23?14'11" N76?1'6"E)

The coordinates are found as this in http://wikimapia.org they use the
goggle maps satellite pictures.

Best wishes, Britta Schneider
