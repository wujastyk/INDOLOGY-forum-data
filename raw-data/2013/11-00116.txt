I had sent this to Oliver a few days ago, but I just realized I did not
send it to the entire list.

Dear Oliver,

The topic is discussed quite thoroughly by K?ty?yana and Pata?jali in the
Mah?bh??ya ad P. 2.1.1 (and of course the various sub(sub) commentaries
thereon).  The discussion is technical of course, and the pros and cons of
each mode of analysis are hashed out at length.  In the translation of the
?hnika by Joshi and Roodbergen (Pata?jali's Vy?kara?a-Mah?bh??ya
Samarth?hnika 1968) the discussion begins on p. 168 with Pata?jali's
prelude to V?rtt. 25. The answer to your question, though, is stated
plainly in the translators' introduction (p. xvii): "The conclusion that
they arrived at is that dvandvas or a bahuvr?hi can be formed of more than
two constituent words. Elsewhere a compound is generally formed of two
words only."

This analysis is also reflected in commentators' glosses. See Scholastic
Sanskrit by Tubb and Boose p. 126 for examples.

See also the K??ik?v?tti ad P. 2.2.29 c?rthe dvandva? where the gloss of
dhava-khadira-pal???? is given as dhava? ca khadira? ca pal??a? ca. Note
that the word enekam is continued from 2.2.24 which treats bahuvr?hi
compounds and is used to indicate that such compounds can be formed from
multiple words not just two as is usually the case by sup sup? etc.

All the Best,
Victor
