Meer Hassan Ali on Kannoge, "midway between Cawnpore and Futtyghur":

As Tim says, it's Kannauj.

Rennell's "Bar" is probably "Barh" which is indeed about the right distance
below (=downstream) from Patna.  See the map: http://tinyurl.com/o2xpr64

The archaeologists focus on
Kumrahar<https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview#!q=Kumrahar+Excavation+Site%2C+Patna%2C+Bihar%2C+India&data=!1m4!1m3!1d2071!2d85.1853867!3d25.5985258!2m1!1e3!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x39ed58b3c1662d0b%3A0x7a1cc0f926af8f9a!3m8!1m3!1d33179!2d85.7587468!3d25.4340885!3m2!1i1680!2i884!4f13.1!4m2!3d25.599726!4d85.185194&fid=7>,
which is a suburb of Patna, and a long way west of Barh.  Other sites right
within Patna are discussed and identified in the archaeological literature
and the Gazetteers.

The Imperial Gazetteer<https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview#!q=Kumrahar+Excavation+Site%2C+Patna%2C+Bihar%2C+India&data=!1m4!1m3!1d2071!2d85.1853867!3d25.5985258!2m1!1e3!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x39ed58b3c1662d0b%3A0x7a1cc0f926af8f9a!3m8!1m3!1d33179!2d85.7587468!3d25.4340885!3m2!1i1680!2i884!4f13.1!4m2!3d25.599726!4d85.185194&fid=7>(Oxford,
Clarendon Press, 1908-1931) places Pataliputra between Bankipur
and Patna, on the tongue of land between the rivers. See also
