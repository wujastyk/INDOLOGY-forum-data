Dear Colleagues

Speaking of Coulson's 'Teach Yourself' - years ago I compiled the grammatical tables at the back and added a few others to create a 'Little Red Book of Sanskrit Paradigms'. Students seem to find it useful. The linked PDF below is not as handy as the printed version, but please feel free to distribute it to anyone who would find it useful:
