Thanks, Madhav.

In fact, I got the list by looking under ???? ??? ???? in ?????????????? ????'s ?????? ???????????.

??? here is probably a shortened form of ???? 'turban' as in ??????? and ???????? and probably ?????? (a game in which playing pieces are hidden in turbans). The listed business communities could have had distinctive turbans or headdresses.

In my last post, I overlooked to give the meaning of ????. It is 'weaver of cotton or silk.' Its distinction from ?????? is difficult to tell. If ?????? is related to ??? or ??? and that word is taken as standing for a the cocoon of a silk worm, originally ?????? could have had the meaning of 'weaver of silk'. 

??? probably stands for ????s not selling certain things or merchants observing certain restrictions in selling.
