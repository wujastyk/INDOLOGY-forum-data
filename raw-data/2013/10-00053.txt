Dear Mrinal,

I understand 'ch?y?puru?a' to mean just what it sounds like: the shadow person.  Numerous tantric and tantric-derived texts discuss prognostications based on watching subtle changes in one's shadow on a clear and sunny day.  The IFP's paper transcripts include a ch?y?puru?alak?a?a (#T0620), which is available from Muktabodha's portal and might be helpful.  Consider also this clear passage from the Yogam?rgaprak??ik? of Yugalad?sa (typed by P?ter-D?niel Sz?nt?):

	[atha ch?y?puru?asya vidh?nam] 

?uddh?tape svadehasya pratibimba? vilokayet | 
bh?mau d???v? tath? khe ca prat?kop?san?? caret || 9 ||

?ira? chinna? tath? kampas tad? m?tyur bhaved dhruvam | 
yad? na d??yate b?hur bhr?t?h?nis tu j?yate || 11 ||
samast?ni ca hy a?g?ni svaprat?kena pa?yati | 
tat sarva? ca vij?n?y?t tasya h?nir na sa??aya? || 12 ||
ya? karoti sad?bhy?sa? gupt?c?re?a m?nu?a? | 
??atva? n?tra sa?deha? ?a?m?sena ca labhyate || 13 ||
viv?he gamane caiva k?le ca mara?e tath? | 
ava?yam eva kartavya? yogibhis tadup?sanam || 14 ||

This appears to be similar to the techniques found in early Tantric texts such as Svacchanda Tantra 7.268, etc. So I would understand ch?y?puru?opade?apari??lanena to be one who is skilled in interpreting the communications of the shadow person.

Hope this helps,

Michael

How do I understand the expressions like ch?y?puru?opade?avidbhi? (Tantr?loka-viveka-3.5ab) or ch?y?puru?opade?apari??lanena (??varapratyabhij??-viv?ti-vimar?in?, Vol.1, p. 159) or ch?y?puru?apar?k??y?mityarth?t (Svacchandatantra-udyota 7.267)? Who are considered to be the learned people in the teachings of ch?y?puru?a (ch?y?puru?a-vid) ? I should be grateful if someone can guide me to the right sources or throw some light on 'ch?y?puru?a'. You can also write to me off-list. Thanks very much in advance.
