Dear Friend,

My 1840 ?aka that is 1917 edn too has a damaged title page. I recovered the
reading as

*siddh?ntas?mavedat?rthopan?makena*

*?r?s?t?n?thas?m?dhy?yibha???c?rye?a*

*samp?dtam*

This is guesswork as we do with damaged/illegible readings in old
manuscripts. The first word *siddh?nta *must have been the initial of the
institutionally awarded title. But I did not see anyone else using it. Hope
this helped.

Happy New Year Eve for all

Best

DB
