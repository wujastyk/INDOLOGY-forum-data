Dear Arlo,

As you will see from the attachment I am sending you, some mss do have suvar.na and dviipa in their text of verse 29. That reading must not have been viewed as objectively strong by the editor. However, it may be an incorrect decision or the reading may be useful for other purposes.

Best.

Could anyone with easy access to the critical edition perhaps tell me whether there are any significant variants for these two verses? It is no doubt naive to even hope for such philological luck, but I would be very pleased indeed if it would be possible to tease out of the transmission of these verses some word like s(u)var?adv?pa or s(u)var?abh?mi, to stand beside yavadv?pa. For various epigraphical sources from Indonesia speak mysteriously of a saptasuvar?abh?mi (and synonyms), whereas these R?m?ya?a verses, as they stand, say of yavadv?pa that it is saptar?jyopa?obhita.
