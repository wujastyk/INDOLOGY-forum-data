Instead of devavandhy?, could t?vantikai not correspond to Skt dev?ntik?, fem. of dev?nta(ka), a name of a r?k?asa and of a daitya (MW)?

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Brahmin Priestesses

Dear Indologists,

The Cilappatik?ram, the Tamil epic, has a character named T?vanti/T?vantikai.  She was a brahmin and was a friend of the heroine, Ka??aki. She married C?tta?, a god in human form. Eight years after marriage, he revealed to her his real nature and left her asking her to come to his temple. Accordingly, she worshipped at the temple of C?tta?. At the end of the epic, when  the temple to Ka??aki is inaugurated, T?vantikai, under possession by C?tta?, T?vantikai entered a trance and danced and C?tta? spoke through her. Later, the C?ra king Ce?ku??uva? established a grant for worship and daily celebration at the Ka??aki temple and appointed her to offer flowers, incense, and fragrances at the temple. After worshipping Ka??aki, the king and others including a brahmin named M??ala? entered a separate sacrificial hall where T?vantikai again spoke as an oracle.

It is clear that T?vanti was being appointed as a priestess in the temple. Earlier in the epic, a priestess of the Ko??avai (c?li?i) is mentioned. She belonged to the non-brahmin hunter community. She also entered a trance, danced ecstatically, and spoke as an oracle. What I?a?k?, the author, seems to be doing is documenting a particular phase of transitioning of non-brahminical religious rituals to brahminical rituals in the Tamil country when brahmin females served as priestesses before being replaced by brahmin male priests.

This proposition is further strengthened by the name T?vanti/T?vantikai. I?a?k? names some characters with generic/class names as proper names. For example, the father of the hero, K?vala?, is called M?c?ttuva?, which name simply means 'the great one with caravans'. Similarly the father of Ka??aki is called M?n?yka?, which name means 'the great one with ships'. Both refer to different types of merchants. We have to add T?vanti/T?vantikai also to this category of names. The name T?vanti/T?vantikai can be derived from Skt. *devavandhy? with the loss of 'va' due to haplology. As Tamil Lexicon show, Sanskrit vandhy? can be Tamilized as vanti or vantiyai. Also we know Skt. -y? can be Tamilized as -kai as in Skt. kany? > Ta. ka??ikai and Skt. ahaly? > Ta. akalikai.  So, Skt. vandhy? > Ta. vantikai.

Skt. vandhy? means 'barren or childless woman'. (A later Tamil text, the Tiruvi?aiy??al Pur??am of Para?c?ti, presents a character named Vanti, a childless woman, from Madurai.) Having childless woman as priestesses seemed to be an ancient Tamil custom. In Pu?an????u 372, we come across such a priestess whom George Hart refers to in his translation as 'barren sacrificial priestess'.

Thus the name T?vanti < devavandhy? seems to suggest a class of women who served as priestesses.  And brahmin T?vanti in Cilappatik?ram seems to indicate the presence of brahmin priestesses in an earlier phase of transition from non-brahmin religious ritualists to brahmin ritualists.

I would like to know if there are instances of such brahmin priestesses from other parts of India in early centuries CE.

Thanks in advance

Regards,
Palaniappan
