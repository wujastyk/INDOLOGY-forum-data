Dear colleagues,

I am pleased to announce the publication of a work left unpublished by Marc
Aurel Stein, in which he critically reconsiders his edition and translation
of Kalha?a's R?jatara?gi?? more than fourty years after their first
publication. This volume contains also Stein's photographic documentation
of historical sites and realia referred to by the outstanding poet and
which Stein intended to publish under the title of "Illustrated
R?jatara?gi??", a project that he - despite many attempts - could not bring
to fruition during the last years of his life.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
