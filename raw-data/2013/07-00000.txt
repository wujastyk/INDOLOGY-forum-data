To Readers and Lovers of Sanskrit,

It is a great pleasure for me to publish this issue of Vi-duu,  
Vidud-duutah, the E-Messenger, with sincere thanks to Professors  
Saroja Bhate and Ashok Aklujkar for making it a special one. I  
appreciate their timely submissions.

This issue is special because responses to views on Sanskrit as a  
lingua franca are cordially invited. If these can be sent to me  
(jayandra.soni at sanskritassociation.org ; Cc:  
soni at staff.uni-marburg.de) by the end of August, it is possible that  
both the response(s) and reply (or replies) could be published in the  
next issue(s) of Vi-duu.

With best wishes from a now cool and humid Kashi,
Jayendra

PS: You might have to download the file rather than read it in a  
Preview function, because the fonts are embedded in the PDF file.
