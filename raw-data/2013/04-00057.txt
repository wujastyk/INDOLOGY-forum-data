Dear All,

we take pleasure in announcing another issue of the Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/
(please set to UTF 8 for viewing):


 Vol. 20 (2013) Issue 2

Vedic as?'rta-, s?'rta-, as?ry?-, as?r?-

by

Marcos Albino


ABSTRACT
In this paper I try to show that Vedic as?'rta is an extended exocentric compound based on sv?r/s?'r ?sun?, that it is not a negative formation with the ?possessive? suffix ?ta, and that s?'rta is a decompositional formation.

I also propose that Ved. as?ry?, too, is an extended exocentric compound. Further, I propose that Ved. as?r? is an ?absence? formation of the type arajj?u ?without rope.?
