In reply one can cite the following verse of the ancient Sivamahimnastava:

asiddhArthA naiva kvachidapi sadevAsuranare

nivartante nityaM jagati jayino yasya vishikhAH .

sa pashyannIsha tvAmitarasurasaadhAraNamabhUt.h

smaraH smartavyAtmA na hi vashishhu pathyaH paribhavaH ..

##

The cupid's(love-god `manmatha's) (flower) arrows never return

unaccomplished whether the victims are gods or demons or men . However O,

master! he has now become just a *remembered soul* (without body),since he

looked upon you as any other ordinary god, shot his arrow and got burnt to

ashes,in no time . Insulting masters (who have controlled their senses),

does one no good .


Ganesan
