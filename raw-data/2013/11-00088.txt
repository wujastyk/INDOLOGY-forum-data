For ?a?kara's views on this issue, see
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe34/sbe34107.htm


R?m?nuja also essentially had the same opinion in his commentary. See
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe48/sbe48137.htm


On the other hand, what is interesting is that for ?r?vai??avas like R?m?nuja, the ??dra saint Namm??v?r was/is the foremost saint.


If you search Indology archives on 'molten', you will find a thread on the issue. Here is a post by Madhav Deshpande. http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2000-January/020112.html


A discussion on the issue of ??dra's eligibility to study the Vedas is also found in another thread. Follow the thread from http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/1998-March/011448.html

Kane, HISTORY OF THE DHARMA ??STRA, VOL. II PART I, p. 82, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona 1941



http://www.srimatham.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/history_of_dharma_sastras.pdf




has this:





<<...the practice current in the times of the Ved?nta-s?tras that the ??dra is not entitled to study the Veda. 


Gaut. XII.4 went so far as to prescribe:?


?if the ??dra intentionally listens for committing to memory the Veda, then his ears should be filled with (molten) lead and lac; if he utters the Veda, then his tongue may be cut off; if he has mastered the Veda his body should be hacked'.>>



Hoping it's of some help,
