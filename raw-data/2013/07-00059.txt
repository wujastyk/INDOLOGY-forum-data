In continuation.
If water-colour too is meant pa?a is an old term meaning a
piece of cloth. ?Traditional painters on
pa?as are known as pa?ua. Painters earning by exhibiting
painted canvas are mentioned in the Mudr?r?k?asa.?

Does anyone know the first recorded of painting canvas or cloth in India? When did it become popular?
