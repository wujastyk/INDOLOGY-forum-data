By devavar?a, they are probably referring to the Divine Year. The standard
description in the S?rya Siddh?nta and the Pur??as  is that an year for
human beings is one ahor?tra (day+night) for the gods.  Three hundred
ahoratras of gods make one *devavatsara, **divyavatsara *or *devavar?a*.

On the other hand, the Jupiter Year, according to the data given in the
S?rya Siddh?nta, is 361days, 0h 38mins.

Regards,
Suresh.
