It might be of interest to know that Lanman's personal copy (or at least
one of them) is available on Google Books
here<http://books.google.com/books?id=qh8UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false>.
There are a few vocabulary notes at the beginning, but at the end there is
a page with the "Expenses of Sanskrit Reader." I assume these are all in
his own hand. There are other annotations throughout the vocabulary.

All the Best,

Victor
