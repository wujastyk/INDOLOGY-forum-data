The PDF file attached to this message
contains the scanned image of one chapter
("A stratagem")
extracted from the (very much) ABRIDGED translation
of the biography of
Mahavidwan Sri Meenakshisundaram Pillai (1815-1876)
who was the teacher of U.V. Swaminatha Aiyar,
one of the fathers of Tamil philology.

This chapter tells a story
in which a stratagem is used
for borrowing a MS from an unfriendly priest
(in order to copy it)
and also the method used for copying the MS.
See page 29:

<QUOTE>

Sri Pillai gave each friend and pupil of his a set of ten palm-leaves
to be copied, and transcribed the rest himself. On the seventh day
the leaves were assembled and after comparison of the copy with the 
original, the latter was returned to Sundaram Pillai
who called for it. Sundaram Pillai had the book and the sovereign
given to the priest by the friend who had acted as his attendant.

</QUOTE>

I have not checked the original Tamil text.
It might contain more details.
