Dear Madhav,

As a note rather than an answer to your question: you may already be  
aware of the most recent work on that phrase (and a discussion of  
Brough's views), Bryan Levman's article ?Sak?ya niruttiy? Revisited.?  
Bulletin des ?tudes Indiennes 26-27 (2008-2009): 33-59.

Warm regards,
Christoph
