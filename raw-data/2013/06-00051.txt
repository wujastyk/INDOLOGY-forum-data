I forward the following message from Jean-Claude Muller, adding the negative (of the photography ) in order to obtain the (virtual)  seal-"positive" imprint.

> Greetings from Luxembourg. Concerning the two lines of script on a seal, apparently from Pakistan, my stomach tells me that this is Karosthi. Upon checking same on some script sites on the internet, this hypothesis tends to confirm itself by visual inspection. The trick however will be to determine the correct picture of the inscription, given that this is a seal. So one will have to hold your picture in a mirror to obtain the "positive? imprint view of the original "negative" and then read from right to left.

I have in my student days at Oxford discovered a 5 caracater inscription in karosthi from the 3rd century BC on a gem, depicting Alexander the Great, presently kept in the Ashmolean museum. It turned out to be some kind of Prakrit name in the genitive, which made perfect sense in connection with the object.
