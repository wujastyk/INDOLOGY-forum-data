In Goettingen we used Stenzler. Here in Oso I use Maurer, who also
starts with Nala as a first text, though in the exercises he mainly uses
the Bhagavadg?t?.

appreciate, it worked well.

Is there an equivalent introductory text that was used in Europe
(Stenzler?) Do European Sanskrit students also work with Nala as a first
text (which I know is found in Bopp, Boehtlink, Monier-Williams,
Stenzler, and Lanman)?
