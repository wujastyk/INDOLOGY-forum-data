Subject: [INDOLOGY] Anandashram Sanskrit Series
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Ce9rmF2jRbbdTJgQYLV5_=t7XxiEswGXEdXKDU8rAemAg@mail.gmail.com>

Remarkably, the AAS has been digitized and is offered here:

   -
   http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2013/04/anandashram-sanskrit-series-anandashram-samskrita-granthavali/

Quite apart from the convenience for reference and reading, it is a
marvellous act of conservation to have scanned these books.  Many of them
are only available on old, acidic paper that has already deteriorated badly.
Many thanks to the Sanskrit eBooks bloggers!
