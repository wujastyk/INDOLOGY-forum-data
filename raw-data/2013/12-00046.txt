Dear Victor,

Many thanks. This, I presume, will have been Monier Williams' source.

Best wishes,

Arlo

Dear Arlo,
In Oppert's edition of the Vaijayant? ??? occurs on p. 161 l. 57 (https://archive.org/details/Vaijayanti). In his glossary he lists the definition as "m, white washed upstair (sic) house." Later editions of this ko?a should probably be consulted as I've found a number of discrepancies between Oppert's text and citations in commentaries and the commentators seem to have a superior reading.


All the Best,Victor

Don't know about a Ko?a reference, but the word clearly betrays a Dravidian connection. See [DEDR 4796] and [CDIAL 9996]. 


Burrow discusses this word in "Dravidian Studies VII", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 12,No. 2 (1948), pp. 365-396 (See entries 259 and 275).


275. me?a- m. a whitewashed, storied house, L. [Pkt. me?aya-; Guj. me??, me?o an upper storey, etc.].    ~ Te. m??a a house of two or more stories, Ta. m??ai raised floor, platform, terraced house. Cf. m??i.

Dear colleagues,

I am trying to find the source for this "L." entry in Monier-Williams. Normally, one finds a Ko?a reference by checking in PW, or if that fails in pw. Neither PW nor pw seems to have been Monier-WIlliams' source, and the Nachtr?ge don't contain this lemma either. So I am at a loss. Can anyone tell me in what source Monier-Williams may have found this word? Or, more interestingly, can anyone tell me where it is attested, whether "lexicographically" or elsewhere?



Thank you. Best wishes,
