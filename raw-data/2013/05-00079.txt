I think -- and here my memory fails me -- I did it by first going to "Show Character Viewer" and the pressing the "Star" key at the top left. But now when I do this, it simply gives me the option of character sizes. Hope someone out there knows how to get to the uncommon ligatures feature, available both on Pages and TextEdit.
