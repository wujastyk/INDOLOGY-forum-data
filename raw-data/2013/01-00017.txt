Subject: translations with shabdalamkara
Message-ID: <161227098457.23782.16353397810894394404.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List,
A very happy new year to all.
Has anyone come across translations which try to convey the shabdalamkara
found in a particular Sanskrit verse or poem in English (or other
languages).  Apart from the brilliant translation of the Gita Govinda by
Lee Siegel, and a few stray verses here and there, I can't think of any
others that I have read at least.
Many thanks
Venetia
