Thanks, Matthew. There does not seem to be a Word-specific keyboard for Nagari. What is there is the general keyboard option provided by the Mac OS, but this doesn't work in Word for Mac. Alack and alas ?

Dear Hans,

I do not work very much with Mac myself. But, as I recall, it is fairly easy to find
and set the language and keyboard options in the recent versions of Mac OS X.
I haven't used it enough, however, to know the details of the keyboard layout.

Perhaps someone who uses mostly Mac can help you with this.

good luck,
Matthew
