In the interest of bibliographic clarity, it may be pointed out that this issue of EJVS comprises what seems to be a virtually unmodified second edition of an article that has been published a few years ago.

Rotaru, Julieta
2009 The ??ntyudakavidhi in the Atharvavedic Tradition. In: Shripad G. Bhat, Shilpa Sumant and Ambarish Vasant Khare (eds.), ?r?nidhi?. Prof. Shrikant Shankar Bahulkar's Gratitude Volume, Pune: Sa?vidy? Institute of Cultural Studies, 162?204.

In any case like this, it seems to me a minimal requirement of scholarly transparency that editors and authors make sure that it is stated clearly that another publication with exactly the same title exists elsewhere, and state explicitly how the two pieces with the same title relate to each other. 

On an indirectly related note, I have just seen this fully online journal: <http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/issue/view/5/showToc>. It seems very well done, and might constitute a model to be striven after for Indological electronic journals. Has anyone among us already attempted anything in this direction?
