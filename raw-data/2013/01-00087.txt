Alas, it has eluded us.  Part of the /Rudray?malatantra /or not, we 
could not find it in Colebrooke's collection of Sanskrit manuscripts.  RR

Dear Dr. Rocher,

It is a privilege to hear from you; I am a great admirer of your work, 
including the Making of Western Indology. If memory serves, you 
suggest  that the sources of the Jatimala have remained a vexed issue 
for Indologists. Am I wrong? Regrettably, I don't have The Making of 
Western Indology in front of me; the  interlibrary library loan staff 
snatched it away.

Many thanks
Laura Harrington
