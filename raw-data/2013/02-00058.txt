Thanks, everyone, for the pointers. The quotation from John Stuart
Mill is interesting. Were there any other similar quotations about
India from the early Indologists such as Anquetil Duperon (1723?1805,
first translator of the Upanishads), August Schlegel (1767?1845,
produced a Latin translation of the Gita) and Charles Wilkins
(1749?1836, first English translator of the Gita) et al.?

Incidentally, in a recent interview with my friend, Sudheer Kolachina,
Noam Chomsky quoted Stuart Mill on India and "humanitarian
intervention" to show how individuals of the highest intelligence and
integrity also succumbed to toeing the official line (referring to
John Stuart Mill's "A Few Words on Non-Intervention, 1859"). The
interview is available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2isewvsPiA
