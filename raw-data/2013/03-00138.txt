Thanks to Harunaga Isaacson's quick find on DLI. He made a pdf of the pages for me. I missed it there.


If any of you have library access to this volume, I would like to ask you to make a scan of these two manuscript desccriptions for me: 

R. 5782(a) pad?rthasa?graha? and R. 5782(b) pad?rthasa?grahavy?khy? in A Triennial Catalogue of Government Oriental Manuscript Library - Sanskrit, volume 8, part 2 (1939 ?).
