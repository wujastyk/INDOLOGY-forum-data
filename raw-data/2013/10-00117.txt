Dear Christian,

The connection seems tenuous, but it is worth noting that R?m?nanda lived around the same time as the composition of the R?mat?pin?(-Upani?ad).  See Christian Bouy, "Mat?riaux pour servir aux ?tudes upani?adiques (II): La R?mat?pinyupani?ad," Journal asiatique 278.3/4 (1990): 269-326.  Bouy's 1994 monograph, Les n?tha-yogin et les upani?ads, makes no mention of the R?m?ndand?s sharing the N?tha Yog?s' interest in promulgating upani?ads for their movement, which may count as a sort of negative evidence.

You might consult James Mallinson, who has done ethnographic field work among R?m?nand?s and has written about them (e.g., 2005. "R?m?nand? Ty?g?s and Ha?ha Yoga," Journal of Vaishnava Studies, 14.1: 107-121 -- I don't have this at hand).

Dear list,

I have come across several references to R?m?nand?'s studying Yoga Upani?ad-s as key texts (Ramdas Lamb, for instance in his article on the R?m?nand?'s for Gerald Larson's festschrift).  So far I have been unable to confirm which Upani?ad-s they consider significant.

I would be very grateful to be pointed to more information, particularly  which faction(s) of the order and which of these texts specifically do they utilize. Any help would be most welcome.

Many Thanks,
