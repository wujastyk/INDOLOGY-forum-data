> Please be aware of the m?lap??ha-pracalitap??ha controversy in the writings of Madhva: it seems that already rather early after Madhva, two redactions of his writings became current, one being picked up by Jayat?rtha, who lived two generations after Madhva (this is the so-called pracalitap??ha, which in places is corrupted), and another through Madhva's direct disciples (the m?lap??ha, which is correct). These two traditions are linked with caste distinctions within the M?dhva community: the m?lap??ha with the original Taulava M?dhvas (Madhva himself was a Taulava) and the pracalitap??ha with the De?astha M?dhvas (Jayat?rtha was a De?astha).

> For demographic reasons (the De?asthas are a majority), and due to Jayat?rtha's popularity as a commentator (his language is quite plain and clear), the pracalitap??ha has been reprinted numerous times, with uneven print quality. The best edition of Madhva's collected writings, by Banna?je Govind?c?rya, is based on the m?lap??ha (mainly on a manuscript by H??ike?at?rtha, a direct disciple of Madhva), which was printed some time in the 1970s, if I recall correctly. Govind?c?rya is at present working on a new edition of the Mah?bh?ratat?tparyanir?aya together with a new commentary (by himself) in Sanskrit.
