Subject: [INDOLOGY] International Journal of Hindu Studies
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CcAPJb7PAv1Vw4JvhajyhSq4Uj77Q_55uOqyQ_npSXwgQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am an advisory editor for the
IJHS<http://www.springer.com/social+sciences/religious+studies/journal/11407>,
and as such I would like to encourage members of the INDOLOGY forum to
think about submitting articles to the IJHS for publication, and to think
about whether they might like to guest-edit a thematic issue of the journal.

Some selected articles from the journal are available as free
samples<http://www.springer.com/social+sciences/religious+studies/journal/11407?hideChart=1#realtime>
.

If you want to follow up on these ideas, please contact the editor of the
IJHS, Prof. Sushil
Mittal<http://www.jmu.edu/philrel/people/faculty/mittal-sushil.shtml>
.

Best,
Dr Dominik Wujastyk
Advisory Editor,
Int. J. Hindu Studies (ed. Sushil Mittal).
