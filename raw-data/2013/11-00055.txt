Subject: [INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 10, Issue 16
In-Reply-To: <CAK2tbYwkRvUdz5S3+HyA_mhG9PGqiQGNwR57=W86276OvD4EDA@mail.gmail.com>

Several of our users have noticed that Unicode characters are not legible
in their emails from INDOLOGY.  This is caused by the "digest" feature that
gathers together a number of INDOLOGY posts into a batch and sends that to
you in once a week or so.  If you switch the setting of your INDOLOGY
account to not digest messages, then you will see all the Devanagari etc.

Best,
Dominik
