Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brahmin in Akam 337? (Re:  dacoits, bandits, thugs and other unsavory characters)

In connection with the priesthood of potters and brahmins, the Tamil story, Nirvika?pa Cam?ti, by Putumaippitta? is interesting. The story discusses how both potters and the Mukk??i Brahmins of Tiruchendur have forelocks and these brahmins are referred to as potters by a ?aiva Brahmin priest in the story. See  section 2 of the following link.

By the way, do brahmins in any part of India outside Tamil Nadu and Kerala have forelocks?


Thanks

In the translation of Akan????u 337, I will not use 'Brahmin' to translate 'p?rpp??'. The word 'p?rpp??' is reflexively and anachronistically interpreted as 'brahmin' by medieval and modern commentators who were not cognizant of socio-religious changes that have happened over the centuries. Of course, they had no benefit of historical/comparative linguistics and had not much knowledge of historical facts provided by inscriptions. 


Coming to the specific word 'p?rpp??', there is nothing in the poem linking him with usual brahminic attributes such as Vedas or sacred thread or as a performer of sacrifices or having the staff or water pitcher. The only description we have of him is that he is a person with a stomach which had not eaten. This offers no basis to conclude he was a brahmin. There is another poem, Pu?an????u  305, which also mentions a 'p?rpp??' with similar emaciated stomach who serves as an emissary. There are no brahminic attributes mentioned in connection with him either. Again the medieval commentators make him out to be a brahmin unwarrantedly. 


There is a poem, Ku?untokai 156, where a brahmin is indicated by the term 'p?rppa?a maka?' who is described as one who eats after fasting. However here his brahminness is clearly identified by attributes such as the staff and water pitcher.  However, this person is not described as emaciated. More importantly, his texts are described as 'unwritten'. Clearly I doubt if such a person who learns texts that are 'unwritten' will be used an emissary for carrying written messages on palm a leaf. (We do find an example of a brahmin carrying a written message in the post-Classical Tamil work, the Cilappatik?ram.)


On the other hand Akan????u 123 refers to persons even more directly comparable to the person with the emaciated stomach. 


u???maiyi? uya?kiya maru?ki?
???p pa?ivattu ????r p?la			(Akan????u 123.1-2)


The only problem is that here the reference is most probably to Jain ascetics, based on the fact they are described as not bathing. As for literacy, there is no question of Jains not being literate, given the many early Tamil Brahmi inscriptions being associated with Jains. There are two 9th century Tamil inscriptions from which we get the name of a group of persons called p?pp?r c????r.  Papp?r c????r were responsible for the upkeep of a pa??iccantam, a grant to a Jain temple mentioned in SII, vol. 14, no.42.   


Considering that the form p?rpp?r often occurs as p?pp?r, clearly even as late as 9th century 'p?rpp??', its singular form, must not have been restricted to refer to brahmins.


We also have an instance of the bards being described as having 'stomach that has not eaten' in Pu?an?n??u 180.11. But since Akan????u 337 does not contain anything else that that can be associated with bards, we can disregard the possibility of a bard being the 'p?rpp??'.


Apart from these attempts at trying to interpret the emaciated nature of the emissary, if one were to consider the term 'p?rpp??' linguistically, we see that the usual interpretation that it referred to brahmins as seers based on 'p?r-' 'to see' (as implied by DEDR 4091a and b as given below) is unwarranted. 



4091 (a) Ta. p?r (-pp-, -tt-) to see, look at, examine, inspect, know, look for, desire, search, look after; p?rval looking; p?rvai id., eye, appearance, etc. Ma. p?rkka to regard, behold, wait for; p?rppuconsidering, expectation. Ka. p?r to look for, wait for, look after, consider, regard, desire; p?r(u) looking to or after; p?raysu to desire; h?rayisu, h?raysu to look for, get a longing after, desire; h?raykedesire. Tu. p?ra guard, custody, keeping. Te. p?ruva sight, glance.
(b) Ta. p?r, p?rpp??, p?rppa?a? brahman; fem. p?rppa?i, p?rppi?i, p?rpp?tti, p?rppa?atti, p?rppi; p?rppu the brahman caste. Ma. p?rppavar the seers, brahmans; p?pp?n brahman; fem. p?pp?tti; p?ppini a caste of lower brahmans. Ko. pa?rvn brahman, Badaga of Harva subcaste; fem. pa?rvty. To. o?rfn brahman, Badaga of Harva subcaste (< Badaga ha?ruva). Ka. p?rva, p?rba, p?ruva, h?ruva, h?rva brahman; fem. p?rviti; p?rvike, p?rbike brahmanism. Kor. (O.) p?rne, (T.) h?rne brahman. Te. p??u??u, p??uv???u id.; fem. p??uta, p??u?akka; (some contamination with Skt. br?hma?a- and its derivatives in the following) b??pu??u brahman; fem. b??pata; b??pana the brahman caste. Nk. (Ch.) p?r brahman; fem. p?riya. 



Clearly not all brahmins were seers. So 'p?rpp??' was not likely to be used as a general term for 'brahmin'.


A more appropriate derivation is to consider it as derived from the same root as that of p?r??tu in DEDR 4092.


4092 Ta. p?r???u (p?r???i-) to applaud, commend, eulogize. Ma. p?r???uka to extol.


 Here although DEDR does not show it, p?r???u is really a compound of p?r and ?ttu, where ???u means 'to bathe' in much the same way as Ta. n?r???u 'to bathe in water'.


In my opinion, p?r in DEDR 4605 p?r???u is related to DEDR 4091b and DEDR 3951 paracu.


3951 Ta. paracu (paraci-) to praise, extol; paravu (paravi-) id., worship, reverence, adore, sing; paraval praising, worshipping. Ma. parikka a vow. Ko. parc- (parc-) to pray; parkym (obl. parkyt-) vow to a god, prayer. To. part- (party-) to pray; arkym (obl. arkyt-) vow. Ka. parasu to utter a benediction, bless; parake, harake, harike benediction, vow. Ko?. parake vow. Tu. paras? benediction;parak? vow made in trouble, beseeching; harasuni to bless, wish well. DED(S) 3257.



Now consider DEDR 4605 p???u. 


4605 Ta. p???u (p???i-) to praise, applaud, worship, protect, cherish, nourish, entertain; n. protection, praise; p???i praise, applause; p???imai honour, reverence. Ma. p???uka to preserve, protect, adore; p???i nourisher, protector. 




Although DEDR does not list it, there is a word Ta. p???i which Tamil Lexicon glosses as 'Brahman temple-priest of Malabar' with the semantic basis of 'to praise, etc.'.
