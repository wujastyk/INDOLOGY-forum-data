There's also a section on the theology of debts in Olivelle's ??rama 
system, and, for Buddhism, there is a conceptually helpful discussion in 
Andy Rotman's "Thus Have I seen - Visualizing Faith in Early Indian 
Buddhism" (Oxford University Press 2009), in connection with pras?da 
(gift/reciprocity/debt - debt as obligation).

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner

>> I've been asked whether (tout court) Buddhism or Hinduism have any clear attitudes toward debt. I understand the question not to refer to spiritual debt, but to monetary debt, and the origins of the questions to probably be whether we find things comparable to the idea of the Jubilee, or the Biblical necessity to release Hebrew slaves after 7 years of service (the origin of the Sabbatical, by the way!), and the like (at least as far as I know, there is no such provision in pre-modern India for manumission).
