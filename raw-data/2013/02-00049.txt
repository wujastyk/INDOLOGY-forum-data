Dear Ruth,

The instructions you just received from the new indology address include a
password (near the end) and details of how to log on to the website (your
email address + the password).  Once you've logged in, you'll see that you
can switch on and off all sorts of settings for yourself.  I think you can
change your email address too.  Or, you can go as far as unsubscribing,
should you wish to do that, and then rejoin.

If you're having trouble logging in, try this.   Go to
listinfo.indology.info, and scroll down to the pink "indology subscribers"
heading near the end.  The very last entry lets you put in your email
address and then change various settings including your email address.

I hope that helps.

Best,
Dominik
for the INDOLOGY committee
