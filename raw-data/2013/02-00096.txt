Dear Indologists,

     If any one has access to an electronic copy of John Brough's article
on "sak?ya niruttiy?", please send it to me as an attachment.  I am
interested in the discussion of the Pali word sakkata used by Buddhaghosa
and others to refer to Sanskrit.  Looks like this word would come from
Sanskrit satk?ta, rather than from sa?sk?ta.  The latter appears in Pali as
sa?khata.  What I found interesting is that satk?t?m v?cam appears as a
variant of sa?sk?t?m v?cam in the manuscripts of R?m?ya?a [Sundarak???a
28.17-18], where Hanuman is wondering that should he speak to S?t? in
sa?sk?t??/satk?t?? v?cam like a Brahmin, she would take him for R?va?a and
would be frightened.  The critical edition of R?m?ya?a selects the reading
sa?sk?t?m, and hence this passage is taken as one of the early reference to
the usage of the word sa?sk?ta in relation to a language.  However, the
reading satk?t?m is there in several manuscripts, and would seem to match
the Pali/Prakrit usage of sakkata/sakkaya to refer to Sanskrit.  K. R.
Norman refers to Brough's article, but I have not had access to it.  Any
other occurrences of satk?ta in reference to Sanskrit?
