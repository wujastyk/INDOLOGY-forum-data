Dear Klaus,

I cannot be 100% sure of course, but I think that source might be incorrect. 
According to several other sources, including the original files from the Senate of Italy linked below (Pull? was also a senator of the Kingdom of Italy), Pull? was first "Full professor of Sanskrit and Comparative history of the classical languages" in Padua from June 3rd 1886 to 1889; then "Full professor of Sanskrit" in Pisa only for a few months, starting June 20th 1889; and eventually "Full professor of Indo-European Philology" in Bologna from October 23rd 1899 to 1925.
In fact, he established the "Gabinetto di Glottologia Sperimentale" (later renamed "Istituto di Glottologia", then "Dipartimento di Studi Linguistici e Orientali" and currently "Dipartimento di Storia, Culture e Civilt?") in Bologna already in 1902.

Presently, beside his Indological writings and  a few family archives, I only have the reference to an obituary published in the Baltimore Sun (or The Sun, Baltimore) on the 10th of December 1968 (but no copy of it). Any living testimony would be also appreciated.
