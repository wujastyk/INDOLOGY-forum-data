Dear list-members,

while working the historical sound recordings from India I want to express my thanks for the most valuable help I already got via the Indology list!

Currently I am occupied with the S?maveda-recordings of the Kauthuma school made by Felix Exner in 1905 in Kolkata and Chennai. Bernhard Geiger who worked on the recordings before 1912 had 2 editions of the G?nas at hand: The one of the Bibliotheca Indica and another one in volume 2 of a periodical named ?Ush?? (also once called ?The Dawn?) which was edited by Satyavrata S?mas?ram? in Calcutta (no. 1.4 of it was printed probably in the year 1890). I cannot get hold of this journal Ush? here in Vienna nor can I find it in another library within reach. Has anyone a copy of Ush? vol. 2 at hand? I would be grateful for a few pages scanned and mailed to me.

Thank you and best regards,

Ulla Remmer
