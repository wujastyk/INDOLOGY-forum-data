Dear Adriano,

However one wishes to explain yad here, this basic sentence structure -- [predicate noun/adj] [+/- ha/hi] [+/- vai] [demonstative pronoun as subject] yad [noun] is ubiquitous in Br?hma?a prose.  Just try a mechanical search of Vedic prose and you get many hits.  The meaning is pretty clear.  For what it is worth, Hans's explanation seems best to me.  Clearly all these yads cannot be glossed with yasm?t!

from KS:
utsannayaj?o v? e?a yad agni?
devaratho v? e?a yad yaj?as
sam?tayaj?o v? e?a yad dar?ap?r?am?sau   << note that e?a agrees with yaj?a? perhaps by attraction

TS:
mah?n hy e?a yad agnis  2.5.9.1
vipr? hy ete yac chu?ruv??sa?  2.5.9.2
pur???yatano v? e?a yad agnis  5.1.2.4
vajr? v? e?a yad a?vas 5.1.2.6
etc. etc.

JUB 1.22:
indra e?a yad udg?t?

?BM:
devap?tra? v? e?a yad agnis  (1.4.2.13)
devap?tra? v? e?a yad va?a?k?ra? (1.7.2.13)
praj?patir v? e?a yad a??u? (4.6.1.1)
b?haspatisavo v? e?a yadv?japeyam (5.2.1.19)  << same lack of agreement
praj?patir v? e?a yad ajar?abha[?]  (5.2.1.24)
varu?asavo v? e?a yad r?jas?ya?  (5.3.4.12)   << lack of agreement
etc. etc.

This is only a portion found from one search ("e?a yad"; plus one found by chance); using all the other forms of e?a-, and other sandhi for yad will produce a list of hundreds.

e.g., from KS:
s???ir v? etad had agnihotram

TS 2.4.11.1:
g?yatr? v? e?? yad u??ih?
TS 6.2.10.4:
vajra iva v? e?? yad abhrir

It would seem that setting off the subject by the intervening yad has the effect of relaxing the sense that the demonstrative pronoun must agree with it, allowing occasional attraction to the predicate.

Best wishes,
Tim

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Pata?jali's syntax

Dear colleague,

Still on the order matter, in the commentary you quote, the commentator understands e?a? as bound to apa?abda?, forming the subject part of the sentence (e?o'pa?abda?), and mleccha? as the predicate ?if I understood it right? ("this deviant word is [indeed] barbaric, known as barbaric"). But if that is so, how to account, syntactically, for yad being in between e?a? and apa?abda? in the original text? Would it be possible with e?a? as an adjective pronoun?

Best wishes

Dear colleague, If I understand you properly, you consider that the expected form should be ya?, construed with apa?abda?, hence the syntactic problem.  On the other hand, yad can be adverbial, equivalent to yasm?t.  This is the syntax given in the S?ktiratn?kara (ed. Vaman Shastri Bhagavat, p. 44.5-6): ???????? ?????????????? ? ??? ???????????????? ???????? ???????????????????? ?????????

Dear colleagues,

I have been having doubts on how to translate this MBh?? sentence (Kielhorn, p.2, line 8):

te'sur??. te sur? helayo helaya iti kurvanta? par?babh?vu?. tasm?d br?hma?ena na mlecchitavai n?pabh??itavai. mleccho ha v? e?a yad apa?abda?.

The problem is on the last sentence, what to make of that yad apa?abda?. I start with ' for this one/he is indeed a mleccha...".

Any suggestions?
