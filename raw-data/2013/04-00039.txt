CALL FOR PAPERS

Issue Theme ? Tradition and Innovation

How are innovative and original ideas justified in the Hindu traditions?
There is a wide-ranging body of quality historical literature on the manner
in which Hindu thinkers have reflected on the apparent tensions between
scriptural sources of knowledge (e.g., the Veda, Upani?ads, S?tra texts,
etc.), and how they have gone about generating new interpretations of
them.  Some have argued there was a general wariness of new-ness, and this
was compounded by the fact that even original thinkers attempt to
demonstrate that their views were rooted in ancient traditions rather than
being their own creative output.  Jayanta Bha??a (fl 850-910 ad), for
instance, famously said in his Ny?yama?jar?: ?How can we discover any new
fact or truth?  One should consider novelty only in rephrasing the older
truths of the ancients in modern terminology.?  Nevertheless Hindu
theologians and Indian philosophers more broadly produced a wide variety of
innovations, even in the context of commentaries on their predecessors.
This issue of the International Journal of Hindu Studies will explore some
of the means by which Hindu thinkers presented new and original ideas.  It
facilitates arguments as to how constructive theology and philosophy might
be done in the future.  This issue also asks whether and to what extent
historical examples of innovation set a precedent for contemporary
constructive philosophical and theological discourse.
