Dear colleagues,

I would appreciate it if someone could provide links to electronic versions of illustrated manuscripts of the Bhagavadg?t? that can be read by students who are studying the text and references to articles/books discussing the art of manuscript illustrations of the BhG.

Thanks in advance.
