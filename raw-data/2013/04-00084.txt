The 1785 edition is also there, on Google Books, e.g.: URL: 
<http://books.google.com/books?id=XtNCAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover> 
(source: Bavarian State Library, Munich)
Also URL: 
<http://www.mdz-nbn-resolving.de/urn/resolver.pl?urn=urn:nbn:de:bvb:12-bsb10219693-7> 
(Bavarian State Library) (same copy).
