The commentator has either used a less commonly known version of the following or combined two originally different verse lines to form a single verse. 
The more commonly known version is:
???????? ????????? ????? ??????? ????? ?
??????????-?????-?????-????????? ??
The first line matches with "Through the force of an upasarga, [A verb] takes on a different meaning from its linguistic root."

I have read a line with the meaning "Just as although the water of the Ganges is sweet, [It is] likewise [transformed] by the water of the ocean." somewhere, but cannot recall exactly where. Pl check, if you have not already done so, texts like the following:
Tilaka's Nipatavyayopasargav,rtti published in 1951 by Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanams Press
The anonymous Laghuupasargav.rtti edited by V. Krishnamacharya and published in 1962 by Adyar Libary.
Upasargaartha-candrikaa by Charudeva Shastri.
