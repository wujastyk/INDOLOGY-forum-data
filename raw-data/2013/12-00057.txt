Does anyone know how to download pdfs from the Digital Library of India 
on MacOs Mavericks ?

If I click on DLI-downloader-5.1-jar-with-dependencies, the GUI comes 
up. But pasting in a barcode has no effect.

Java -version in Terminal gives:

java version "1.7.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)
