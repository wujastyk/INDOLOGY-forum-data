Dear Elizabeth,

I have been moving about a lot between India, UK and Canada and have not
been able to reply. I'm just going to have my knee operated and will be in
hospital for a while but once I'm out I will try to send you some material
on Siddha representations.

I hope it can wait that long.

All best wishes,

Julia.
