Dear Dr. Fosse,

Begging your forgiveness for a tinge of self promotion, you may be 
interested to look at my recently published paper which aims at deciphering 
the strucutre of the Bhagavad gita through comparative theology:


 Theodor, I. "The Philosophical Theological Structure of the Bhagavadgita: 
Deciphering the Structure of the Bhagavadgita Through Comparative Theology", 
Nid?n ? International Journal for the Study of Hinduism, Vol. 17, December 
2005, University of KwaZulu-Natal, pp. 1-17.



 I hope it helps.



 Best regards,



                                  Ithamar Theodor
