Check out Karl Potter's Bibliography of Indian Philosophies, which is organized chronologically, and mentions the school of each author.
 
Also, look at the Library of Congress catalog < catalog.loc.gov >  under the subject headings:
 
Sanskrit literature--1500-1800
Sanskrit literatature--19th century
Sanskrit literature--20th century (with subdivisions)
 
The Sanskrit Knowledge Systems Project is studying the intellectual history of India just before colonialism.  It terminates with 1757.  Have a look at its homepage < http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pollock/sks/ >.  You may want to contact some of the scholars involved.
 
Michael Comans might have some suggestions, as well, since his first book was on a modern polemic work in Sanskrit.

Greetings,

Can anyone please help me find Sanskrit texts written in the 18th, 19th,
20th centuries. I am particularly interested in advaita works, or poetic
works, but any would be most welcome. I am translating an advaita work
written in the 18th century and would like to compare it with other works
written at that time or later.

Thankyou,
