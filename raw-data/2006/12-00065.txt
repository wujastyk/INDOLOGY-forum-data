Subject: van Buitenen's Critical Edition of Bhaskara's              Brahmasutrabhasya

Bhaskara's Bhagavadanu"sayaanusara.na / Giitaabhaa.sya commentary is 
preserved in only two, only partially overlapping, manuscripts.  One is in 
Varanasi, I think, and the other, for sure, is in the Wellcome Library in 
London.  Shelf mark: MS Indic alpha 1241.  Sarada script, ff. 35--61. 
Described, with bibliographical references to van Buitenen and 2 articles 
by Raghavan, in that library's Handlist of Skt and Pkt Manuscripts, vol.1 
(1985), page 30.
