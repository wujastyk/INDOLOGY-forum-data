Subject: Punjabi or Hindustani slurs on British?
Message-ID: <161227077326.23782.12173898710597057974.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A film-maker is doing a film on the Komagatu Maru incident (the turning back of a ship of Indian immigrant farm workers from Vancouver, BC in 1914).  She needs to know what slurs, slang, or derogatory words the Indians involved would have applied to the  British or to the employees of the Immigration offices.  I already suggested Ferenghi and Gora (log), but does anyone know any others?
 
Thanks,
