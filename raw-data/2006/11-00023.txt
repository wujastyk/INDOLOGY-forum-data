"From the Vaayuprokta to the Vaayu and Brahmaa.n.da Puraa.nas: Preliminary
remarks towards a critical edition of the vaayuprokta
Brahmaa.n.dapuraa.na", in Koskikallio, P. ed. Epics, khilas and pur??as:
Continuities and ruptures. Proceedings of the Third Dubrovnik
International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Puraa.nas, September
2002, Zagreb : Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 2005, pp. 535-560.
Thereafter, at a second stage, new texts were produced, claiming firstly to
be "supplements" (uttara) to the original B.dP, or, secondly and much more
often, "parts" of a virtual B.d "mahaa-puraa.na" (with various bhaagas or
even sa.mhitaas as in the case of the Skanda). And there are indeed
numerous texts offering such a claim. See thereon my study (forthcoming):
 "Transmission et recr?ation puraa.nique : le cas du Brahmaa.n.dapuraa.na",
in Gerschheimer, G. & Colas, G. eds Transmission des textes en Inde, Paris.
Therefore, the mediaeval and later quotations "from the B.dP" can refer to
many different texts. In the case of yours, which can thus be found in
Madhva, there is the supplementary problem that, according to the
researches of Mesquita, Madhva created himself false quotations for his own
philosophical/theological purposes.
See:
Mesquita, Roque 1997, Madhva und seine unbekannten literarischen Quellen.
Einige Beobachtungen (Publications of the De Nobili Research Library 24),
Wien: Institute of Indology (new ed. : Madhva's Unknown Literary Sources:
Some observations, Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, 2000).
Hoping that in can help,
yours,
Christophe
