Dear Ferenc,

Since I read an earlier version of you Purusha paper, I must express some
astonishment at the rejection. I found it quite interesting and stimulating,
and I see no reason why it should not be read at an Indological conference.
Given the latest work in comparative mythology (pending publication) by
Michael Witzel (who makes comprehensive comparisons of mythological
material), I dare say your paper belongs in the forefront of such studies.
It is certainly a valid contribution to the field, and since it is Vedic, it
should also be of Indological interest. 

As for your Nyaya project, I must leave that to others. 

Best regards,

Lars Martin
