I have requested it from remote storage and will report on the content.  However, there are a lot of books on magic which advertise in their titles that they are from some relatively "exotic" source but which turn out to be just the same standard, mostly by not entirely 'Hindu,' stuff.  E.g. Misri ka jadu, Tibbati jadugari, Chini indrajala, or the like. (These are made up titles, but I have seen plenty like them.)

Some years ago a brief work was published in
Jaipur in Hindi, entitled _Islaamii Tantra_.
I don't have immediate access to my copy,
so I can't describe it in detail just now,
but it may be of some interest in this
context, at least as a curiosity.
While I tend to think that the Alla.h-U in
itself does not offer sufficient material
for an MA paper, it might be possible
to construct an adequate context around it.
