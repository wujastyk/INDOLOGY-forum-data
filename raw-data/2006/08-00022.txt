Subject: a new Sandesa
Message-ID: <161227078238.23782.718545427948695790.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I came across a new sandesa title today, the Iksu Sandesa or Sugarcane Herald.  Unfortunately it is in Hindi not Sanskrit and is in prose, not verse.  Actually, it is the organ of the Indian Central Sugarcane Committee, so the world of humane letters will not be enriched by it, alas.  Perhaps the ICSC could appoint a poet laureate to write such a lyric.
