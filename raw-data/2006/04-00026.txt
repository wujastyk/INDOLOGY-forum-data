It looks like,

Under a favourable mansion of Hasta, under favourable planet(s), with 
the sun favourable [i.e. from the astrological point of view], in the 
morning, accompanied by brahmanas, the wise one should look 
round/observe....

Hasta is the group of stars known as the constellation Corvus in 
western astronomy.  In the 27 nakshatra system, it  is the segment of 
the lunar zodiac 23 Virgo 20 to 6 Libra 40 (Sidereal).  I imagine 
that for the purposes of whatever the 'wise one' wanted to do, the 
Moon needed to be in Hasta (something that would happen for about a 
day every month) but also in an astrologically favourable 
condition--waxing or well-aspected, perhaps.
