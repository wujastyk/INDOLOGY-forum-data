Announcement

The Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association (CBETA) is proud to
announce the immediate availability of a new set of XML files, which
confirm to the Text Encoding Initiatives (TEI) guidelines and
schema. The files are available for download at 
http://www.cbeta.org/xml/download.htm .

The new release of a set of XML files by CBETA is a very significant
step for the whole project.  For this release, the files have been
thoroughly checked and updated to confirm to the latest version of the
TEI Guidelines (P5).  The internal encoding has been converted to
Unicode; characters that have no equivalent in Unicode are represented
using the TEI "gaiji" module.  For the first time ever, this is a
release where every single character is identified in a way that is in
accordance with international, open standards and thus allows easy
interchange and handling by all conformant XML tools.  The set of
files comes with documentation for the extensions made by the CBETA
project (using the standard TEI ODD extension mechanism) and with
equivalent schema definitions using the DTD language, the W3C Schema
language and Relax NG as defined by the ISO. These files are available
in the link labelled "schema".

All together, the collection of digital files now holds the equivalent
of about 100 printed volumes.  With this release, they become
available to every interested researcher in a new format, which opens
up completely new avenues for investigation.  We hope this will not
only provide a genuine service to the Chinese Studies and Buddhist
Studies research communities, but will also be used as a an example
for the encoding of new texts and as a test bed for tools developped
to do new interesting things with these texts.  

The download of the texts is available as two bundles (one for the
texts from the Taisho Tripitaka, Volumes 1-55 and 85, the other from
the Zokuzokyo "Supplement", covering Volumes 1-5, 7-10 and 54-88) as
well as individual volumes from these collections.

Any questions might be directed to service (at) cbeta.org or to
cwittern (at) gmail.com.

With warm regards,


Christian Wittern
