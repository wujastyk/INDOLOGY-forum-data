My sincere apologies for cross listing!

We have an unusual (large) funding opportunity for the Huntington  
Archive from a private Endowment. As part of our communication with  
the foundation a few appreciatory notes from senior members of the  
two lists about the value of the Archive would be very useful right  
now. Nothing elaborate, a couple of lines at the most. You might  
mention a feature of it that you like if you care to but it is not  
necessary.

Thank you all

John
