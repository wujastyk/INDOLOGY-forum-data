I apologise for I thought the diacritics would transfer.




A couple of questions for the experts:

1. I should appreciate it, if some one could help with the rendering of this
passage:

"sobhane hastanakshatre grahasaumye "subhe ravau/
puurvaahne braahma.nair yukta.h pariiksheta vicaksha.na.h//

2. Any information on a sm.rtinibandha: Jaganmohana composed by
"Sriilakshma.naacaarya Bha.t.ta

Many thanks,
Ken
