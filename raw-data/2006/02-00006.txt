Subject: Sharada birchbark mss : anyone offered any?
Message-ID: <161227077410.23782.12054835419153710362.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

If anyone has been offered for sale or valuation, or seen in a bookseller's catalog, any modern or medieval birchbark manuscripts from Kashmir, could they please contact me off the list?
 
I should state in advance I am not asking because of any suspicion of theft or national patrimony and export issues, but in helping someone get a basis for appraisal.   I am also not referring to ancient Gandhari birchbark mss or similar items, but solely to much more recent Kashmir mss.
 
Thanks,
 
Allen
