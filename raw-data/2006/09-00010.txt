The Department of Classics at Brown University has been authorized to 
announce a search for the Das Professor of Sanskrit. The Das Professor 
will teach Sanskrit language as well as courses in translation, and we 
anticipate that he or she will establish connections with other 
colleagues and units at Brown focused on South Asia and on the ancient 
world. Prerequisites for consideration include distinction in 
scholarship and teaching in any aspect of Sanskrit language and 
literature and the cultures of South Asia associated therewith. 
Candidates should submit a letter of application and a curriculum 
vitae, including the names and contact information of at least five 
references.

Applications should be sent, preferably by November 1, 2006, to: Chair 
of the Sanskrit Search Committee, Department of Classics, Brown 
University, Providence, RI 02912, USA. Review of applications will 
begin immediately and continue until the position is filled or closed. 
Finalists will be invited to campus for interviews early in 2007. 
Inquiries may be directed to John_Bodel at brown.edu.  Brown University is 
committed to diversity in its faculty and encourages applications from 
qualified women and under-represented minority candidates.
