Dear Professor Zysk,

I will send you the light version in a separate mail.

Also, if other people had difficulty downloading the newsletter,  
please send a personal note to me.  I will send the newsletter  
directly to them.

Nonetheless, the newsletter _should_ download fine by now.

All the Best,
