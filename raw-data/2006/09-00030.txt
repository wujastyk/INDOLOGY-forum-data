Dear List,

A colleague who is a poet would like to identify the script, the 
language, and the content of the palm leaf manuscript pages which can be 
seen in these photos:

He possesses the cover and the first five pages, of which these two are 
the last.  He has been led to believe that the text may be Buddhist.  Is 
anyone able to read these pages?

He would be most grateful for any help. Thanks in advance.

George Thompson
