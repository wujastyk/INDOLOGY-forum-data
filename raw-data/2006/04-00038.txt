Dear Dr. Anand,

You probably mean VenkaTa, the name of a hill in the
South of Andhra Pradesh where the famous temples of
Tirupati and Tirumala stand. Hence the name
VenkaTa-Izvara - the Lord of VenkaTa.

I am not aware of the ethymology of the word. Perhaps
a Dravidian scholar can help.

Regards,

Anna Slaczka.
