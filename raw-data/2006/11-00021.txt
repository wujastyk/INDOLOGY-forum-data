Dear Christopher,
Thank you for speedily answering my enquiry. But could you elaborate a 
little on your above comments, as this is not an area with which I am very 
familiar.

That great repository of human knowledge: Wikipedia.  I am trying there to

depiction of the Buddha is flattering to him.

Best wishes,
