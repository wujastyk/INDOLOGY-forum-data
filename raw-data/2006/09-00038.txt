Dear George,

Another snippet of information from my informants on the PaliStudy list:

>The text is the standard kammavaacaa formula recited by the sangha when 
>imposing 6-day >maanatta on a bhikkhu who has committed a sanghaadisesa 
>offence. Kammavaacaa collections >seem to form a very high proportion of 
>the bai laan that end up in the tourist markets.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
