Dear Colleagues,

We have just published nine wonderful pictures and a presentation of the exhibition "Pleasure Gardens and Garden Tombs: Courtly Arts under the Mughals" held at the Museum fr Indische Kunst, Berlin - Dahlem (Germany). The exhibition is culled from significant German private collections and three of the Collections of the State Museums of Berlin. 

Enjoy!

Enrica Garzilli
