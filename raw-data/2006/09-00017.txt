That may depend on outdated releases. Recent versions of Endnote (v.  
9 for Windows and Endnote X for Mac OS) are said to be capable to  
manage unicode input. I have just installed the 30 day trial version  
on my Mac and played with it. Actually, it seems to work. It is  
possible to input Latin scripts with all relevant diacritics as well  
as Asian alphabets (I have tried Japanese).

Export in unicode encoding (UTF-8) also works.

Hope it helps
