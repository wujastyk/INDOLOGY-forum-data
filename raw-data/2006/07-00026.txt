The term mAdhava AcArya in all likelihood refers to mAdhavAcArya's commentary on the parAzarasmRti, commonly referred to as parAzaramAdhavIya.  This work, I believe, was published in the Bombay Sanskrit Series.

Since I sent this message during the Skt conference, I am afraid that 
it may have been overlooked--any advice most appreciated!

  At the website 
http://www.valmikiramayan.net/aranya/sarga50/aranyaitrans50.htm ad 
what is labled there 3-50-7/8 (Critical ed. 3.48.6-7) one finds the 
following:

If it is asked that a king's wife is a special entity to be 
protected, and then other's wives are less fortunate or what? Not so, 
it is said that the wife of a king is a motherly entity. Other's 
wives may become sisters or sister-in-laws etc., but a mother is a 
mother. The difference in dealing with a king's wife and with wife of 
a commoner is that of a difference between a sinner and a criminal. 
Either way unrighteous it is. The very basic concept of wooing 
others' wives itself, is both a crime and a sin.  'R^itaa upeyaat...' 
iti shaastraat - gamyaa sva bhaaryaa | anyaa bhaaryaa agamyaa iti- 
maadhava aacaarya - dk.

Can anyone point me to the source of the expression attributed here 
to Maadhava?  (In the apparatus to the Critcal Ed. several cys are 
quoted, but nothing of this nature appears.) Thanks so much!  JAS
