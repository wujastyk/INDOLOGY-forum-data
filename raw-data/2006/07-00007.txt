  Aims and brief outline:  
                                                  
                          This program aims at exposing the Sanskrit scholars and teachers to the field of NLP.There has been a curiosity among many Sanskrit scholars regarding the application of Sanskrit shastras to the field of computers in general and      NLP in particular. It is well known that our shastras have a detailed study of Languages, its analysis etc. Though the Sanskrit scholars are good at the analysis of Sanskrit Languages, when it comes to application of it to other languages  and  its  use  for  computers, they need exposure. A number of resource centers in languages have been started by Ministry of Information Technology.       They are facing shortage of trained manpower.         We are sure that, with a good background in Sanskrit  Vyakarna,  the Sanskrit scholars can be potentially better than  others, provided they are exposed to the proper tools and problems in NLP. The teachers attending this program in turn can expose students at their institutes
 to the field of NLP creating grater awareness among them for this field. We summarize below the topics that will be covered during this 3 week program. Based on the feedback obtained from this program, we are planning to approach MHRD for regular training program in NLP for Sanskrit scholars.
