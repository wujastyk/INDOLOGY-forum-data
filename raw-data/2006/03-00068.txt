Dear Colleagues,

I wonder whether most of you know that Edinburgh University Library 
possesses an unusual and interesting scroll manuscript of the 
Mahabharata with a considerable number of fine miniatures.  Three of 
those miniatures have featured on covers of books that you may have come 
across:  (in chronologic order of publication), my own The Sacred Thread 
(2nd edn), Richard King's Indian Philosophy and Will Johnson's 
translation of the Sauptikaparvan.  However, the library has now mounted 
some more, along with some background information on the manuscript 
(partly drawn from my own notes on the manuscript), on its web site as 
its "Book of the Month" for March.  It can be accessed at 
<http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/resources/collections/specdivision/botm.shtml> 
and I do recommend a look.

Yours

John Brockington
