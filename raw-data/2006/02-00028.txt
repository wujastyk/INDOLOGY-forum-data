Dear colleagues,

On behalf of Prof. G.N. Dash (Bhubanesvar), I am trying to get ahold of

Gilbert Pollet, ?Studies in the Bhakta Mala of Nabha Dass? (Ph.D.  
diss., School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London,  
1963)

Does anybody happen to have a copy of this? Does it contain an  
edition of the Bhaktamaalaa?

Does anybody know whether Pollet has also published this work  
commercially? It does not appear in any of the Dutch online catalogs.

Thanks you very much.

Arlo Griffiths
