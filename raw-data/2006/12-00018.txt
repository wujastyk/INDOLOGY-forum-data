Dear Jan,  Here is a list of some of my publications which show the  
Buddha referring to passages in the Upanishads, mainly to the BAU.

I am just completing a set of ten lectures as Numata Visiting  
Professor at SOAS in which I draw this material together and add some  
more, but I am afraid it will be a while before these lectures are  
published.

It is of course perfectly possible that the texts we now have of the  
Upanishads were compiled over a long period; I don't see how that  
hypothesis could ever be conclusively disproved.  However, unless we  
subscribe to the view that the Buddha was omniscient and could  
therefore respond to texts which would be composed in the future, I  
do not understand how his references to important passages in the BAU  
etc. can fail to be interpreted as showing that they already existed  
when he preached.

Yours,

Richard
