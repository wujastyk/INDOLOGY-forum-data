Subject: A Garuda Purana question

Dear Indologists,
 
The Garuda Maha Puranam 227.9-10 I am looking at has the following  text:
 
bhaktiraSTavidhA  hyeSA yasmin mleccho ?pi varttate||
sa viprendromuniH zrImAn sa yatiH paramAM  gatim||
tasmai deyaM tato grAhyaM sa ca pUjyo yathA hariH|| 
 
This  could be in 219.6-10 in other versions. Can anybody tell me how "tasmai 
deyAM  tato grAhyaM" is explained by different commentators? Does this phrase 
occur  anywhere else prior to Garuda Purana? What is the date of this 
particular  line?
 
Thanks  in advance.
 
Regards
S.  Palaniappan
