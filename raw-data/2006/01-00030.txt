In Darjeeling one hears bho.tesaalaa, "brother-in-law of a Tibetan."
This suggests that saalaa, when used alone as a malediction,
has the implication that the person to whom it is addressed
has a sister who has married in violation of caste regulations.
Compare, in American slang, the use of "mother" alone.
