Sorry if this announcement comes to you in multiple postings. Your help in
spreading the information will be appreciated.

A Summer Course in Beginning Sanskrit
 
Introductory Sanskrit (SANS 102) will be taught by Professor Ashok Aklujkar
in the second term of the 2006 summer session at the University of British
Columbia. This will be the last time Professor Aklujkar will teach this
course at UBC, because he will retire from the Department of Asian Studies,
(Vancouver, B.C., Canada V6T 1Z2) at the end of 2006 in keeping with the
mandatory retirement policy currently in force at UBC.
 
The dates set for the course are Monday 17 July - Saturday 26 August 2006,
with a two-hour final examination taking place on the last day. During the
specified six weeks, the class will meet, in Buchanan B224, for 3-3.5 hours
each on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday mornings (9-12 a.m, with
possible extension toward 8:00 a.m. or 01:00 p.m. on some days), making a
total of 78 hours of instruction and testing. Students will have Wednesdays
and weekends free for consolidation of what they learn on the other days.
 
The current UBC fees for such a 6-credit course are C$802.20 for Canadian
students and C$3,324.00 (approximately equal to US$ 2,825.40) for
international students.
 
The course credits presuppose a term or semester system. They may correspond
to a higher number at universities following the quarter system.
 
There are no prerequisites for the course other than suitability for
admission at the University of British Columbia. Inquiries regarding this
suitability should be directed to Enrolment Services at UBC: Web:

Interested students coming from distant places should inquire at their
universities or with the local India specialists if any financial assistance
is available. For non-Canadian students, exchange agreements between Canada
and their country of residence may prove to be useful.
