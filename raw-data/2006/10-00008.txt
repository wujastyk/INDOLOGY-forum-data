I have noted the following publication:

Keshavram Kashiram Shastree (ed.): The BhAgavata 
mahApurANa (oldest Devanagari version. - Part 1-2. - 
Ahmedabad : Shrimad Vallabh Vishvadharma Samstha, 2002

But I've not seen it yet. My source was a review in: 
Journal of the Oriental Institute [Baroda]. 52 (2002), p. 
335-336.

If it exists, it does not seem to have found its way into 
the libraries. In recent years, some commentaries of the 
Bhagavatam have been published; e.g. Vallabhacarya's Sri 
Subodhini and that of Anandatirtha (ed. by K. T. 
Pandurangi).

Hope it helps
