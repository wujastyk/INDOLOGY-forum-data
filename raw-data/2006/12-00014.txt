PLEASE FORWARD

The John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress presents Kluge Fellow, Anne David, in a talk titled "Reading Landscapes:  Philological Issues in Tamil Sangam Poetry" on Thursday, December 14, 2006 at 12:00 p.m., in LJ-119, Thomas Jefferson Building.  This event is free and open to the public; no reservations are required.

Classical Tamil ("Sangam") poetry is a secular literature of over 2000 elegant lyric poems, sophisticated and complex in style, clearly the end product of a highly developed tradition.  In her talk, Anne David will offer background information and some basic tools for reading these poems, then examine a few verses with an eye towards elucidating some problems and questions that arise in reading ancient Tamil texts.
