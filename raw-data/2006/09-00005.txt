There is a brief article on the sresthin by Sheo Bahadur Singh, "Sresthin in Epigraphy", Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India [Bharatiya Purabhilekha Patrika] (Being vol. X of Studies in Indian Epigraphy) Vol. ten: 1993, 104-107. The author also refers, albeit very briefly, to some Buddhist sources.

Does anyone know of any research that has been done on the figure of
the seTThi or zreSThin, usually translated as 'Treasurer',  in
Buddhist texts?  I am particularly interested in the development in
the Dhammapada commentary, where he in fact seems to function as a
wealthy banker or money-lender (though without the usual negative
connotations of the latter), but with almost magical powers over
money, as a result of kamma/karma in previous lives.
