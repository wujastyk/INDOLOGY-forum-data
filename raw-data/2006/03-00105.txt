Dear Colleagues,
	Inquiries regarding our previous advertisement and discussion 
with the Brown University administration lead us to revise our 
advertisement for a Sanskrit fellowship as follows.  The fellowship 
now offers more money per month instead of tuition for one course and 
is open to post-docs.  In either case it begins in September rather 
than in the summer.  Please bring it to the attention of qualified 
candidates.

Sanskrit fellowship
The Sanskrit Library Project at Brown University invites graduate 
students or post-docs with expertise in Sanskrit, and comfort working 
with data files to apply for a fellowship for the fall to join an 
NSF-funded project to develop an internet-based digital Sanskrit 
library.  The project integrates Sanskrit digital archives, digital 
lexica, and linguistic software in a richly inter-linked environment 
to facilitate philological and linguistic research.  The fellowship 
provides a stipend of $1,977/mo for four and a half months beginning 
September 1, plus health and dental insurance.  Particularly 
desirable skills include experience with Sanskrit lexicography and 
grammar, digital data files, and computational methods.  Interested 
persons are requested to send a letter of application, c.v., relevant 
papers, and two recommendations to Peter Scharf, Department of 
Classics, Brown University, PO Box 1856, Providence, RI 02912, USA by 
April 1.  Application materials may be emailed to scharf at brown.edu.
