Dear Professor Sandhal and others who have potential students for SASLI.

With respect to the costs ($2700 program fee plus living expenses,  
very modest by most US university standards), we do offer both  
partial and full program fee remission for deserving students,  
especially in undersubscribed languages.

Cheers,
tony
