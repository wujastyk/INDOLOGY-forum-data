Dear Prem,

First of all if you are coming to Delhi during June or August please get in 
touch. I am out in July. Call me at 26831744 or 41328003. It will be great 
to see you again.

Never heard of your village, unless Kerhowli is a mistake for Mehrauli, 
which was a village near Delhi with many khanqahs, etc; and is now a 
fashionable suburb of south Delhi ! But we could go there and enquire about 
the shAkhA.

But I suggest you consult the topographical sheets of the Survey of India 
for villages near Delhi.

Best wishes,
Romila
