It is depressing to learn of the problems mentioned
in Dominik's last posting. Does anyone know
of Sanskrit publishers and distributers (besides the Harvard Oriental 
Series....!) who are assuredly 100% nirmala when it comes to far
right ideologies?

Unfortunately, Sanskrit itself is a theatre in the current ideological
war. I fear that many of us who love the language and aspects
of the culture it embodies may find ourselves imbricated in
various insidious ways in battles we never bargained for.
