            New software package for Sanskrit text generation
Saturday March 25 2006 00:00 IST   TIRUCHY: In a major breakthrough in Sanskrit and Vedic electronic text generation, two senior executives of BHEL, Tiruchy, A V Jagannadha Rao and S Ravikrishnamoorthy, both of whom are also the developers of the versatile software NTRANS, have produced an advanced package.

According to a press release, the new software is capable of automatically performing the ?sandhi? (conjunction) - both  ?akshara sandhi? and ?svara \n            sandhi? - in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit or Vedic \n            grammar.

The package also facilitates text generation for \n            recitation in the basic form of ?pada paatha? (basic \n            word-by-word) or in any of the advanced forms of ?krama? \n            (two-word), ?jata? (forward and reverse two-word) and \n            ?ghana? (complex three-word) conjunction.

Books in \n            Sanskrit or Grantha scripts that have been published so far \n            contain only the basic word-by-word text. The new software has been \n            developed in accordance with the Krishna Yajurveda Taittiriya \n            Samhita.

The authors of the package conducted a \n            lecture-cum-demonstration of the software at the Sringeri Sankara \n            Mutt, Srirangam.

The software has been developed in \n            accordance with the Krishna Yajurveda Taittiriya \n            Samhita
