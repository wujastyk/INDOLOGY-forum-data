At the risk of stating the all too obvious: the "Epic and Puranic 
Bibliography (upto 1985)" may be helpful. The index in vol. 2 lists a 
large number of titles on the BhG. One would wish for the online update 
that is still in the making, as far as I know.

Catherine A.Robinson:
Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gita and images of the Hindu tradition : 
the Song of the Lord. New York : Routledge 2005.

[Apologies if that should turn out to be just another run-of-the-mill 
product of the postcolonial discourse machine, rounding up the usual 
suspects, among them - inevitably - F. Max Mueller.]

And yes, how about SaverioMarchignoli's "Canonizing an Indian Text? ..."
(unless Alex Passi's question wasn't rhetorical)? This is less about the  
BhG than about "German Indology", with a dose of prefab concepts 
taken over from the postcolonial fringe, and { SEQ CHAPTER \h \r 1}with first-hand insights into 
"the deep, perhaps not fully conscious" workings of F. Schlegel's mind, 
"German self-understanding", "the dangerous part of German cultural 
identity" and other time-honoured pseudo-psychological platitudes. But 
once all this is left behind, it becomes evident that the author has a 
genuine knowledge of the German sources he discusses - which 
distinguishes him from many other players in this field.
