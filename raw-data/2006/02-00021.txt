Dear Prof. Hanneder:

I would suggest that as a first step you consult the resource guide  
on fonts at the South Asia Language Resource Center, a collaborative  
effort of the US Department of Education's Title VI National Resource  
Centers for South Asia.  The SALRC is located at the University of  
Chicago.

See:  http://salrc.uchicago.edu/

The font section is listed under "resources"":  http:// 
salrc.uchicago.edu/resources/fonts/

Cheers,
tony
