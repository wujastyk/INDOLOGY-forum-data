Subject: Valmiki, the hunter
Message-ID: <161227078814.23782.17884406169034827888.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 
In 'Authority and meaning in Indian religions : Hinduism and the case of  
Valmiki', based on Taittiriya Praatisaakhya 5.34, 5.35, 5.36, 9.4, and  18.6,  
Julia Leslie discusses the possibility that Valmiki, a  grammarian, might have 
belonged to a community whose mother-tongue was not  Sanskrit. 
 
Can a grammarian not propound a rule based on his observation of language  
use by others? Is there any justification to assume Valmiki's rule is based on  
his own usage? I would appreciate any comments on this from the Sanskrit  
grammarians on this list.
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
