Abstract:

The Department of Classics at Brown University has been authorized to 
announce a search for the Das Professor of Sanskrit. The Das Professor 
will teach Sanskrit language as well as courses in translation, and we 
anticipate that he or she will establish connections with other colleagues 
and units at Brown focused on South Asia and on the ancient world. 
Prerequisites for consideration include distinction in scholarship and 
teaching in any aspect of Sanskrit language and literature and the 
cultures of South Asia associated therewith. Candidates should submit a 
letter of application and a curriculum vitae, including the names and 
contact information of at least five references.

Applications should be sent, preferably by November 1, 2006, to: Chair of 
the Sanskrit Search Committee, Department of Classics, Brown University, 
Providence, RI 02912, USA. Review of applications will begin immediately 
and continue until the position is filled or closed. Finalists will be 
invited to campus for interviews early in 2007. Inquiries may be directed 
to John_Bodel at brown.edu. Brown University is committed to diversity in its 
faculty and encourages applications from qualified women and 
under-represented minority candidates.
