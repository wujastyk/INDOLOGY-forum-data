Hi Arlo,

It?s an interesting problem and Tibetan, Burmese, Thai and Cambodian all present analogous issues as well. There are no doubt other cases, perhaps Lao, Cham, etc. I would be interested to learn of serious comparative work on the question. Perhaps a topic for a workshop ?

best,
Matthew

There is no great difference between a graphemic and a phonological representation of Sanskrit. This probably holds for several other South Asian languages too. And there seems to a be a great stability in the relationship between sign and sound, as least in the languages that I know. The Oriya ?, the Bengali ?, the Tamil ? are palaeographically related and all represent the same consonant phoneme ? although the accompanying vowel differs. There are some other regional differences, but my entirely subjective impression is that stability of the sign-sound nexus is more impressive than differentiation in the history of script-use in India.

(In fact, in some Batak dialects other than the culturally dominant Toba dialect, which has been followed by Unicode, the same word spelt with the same ak?ara is pronounced as the Sanskrit word pustaka.)
