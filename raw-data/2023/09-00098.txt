Dear list members,
Andre Padoux in his book "The Hindu Tantric World an overview" english
edition mentions an article "Tantric traditions 2011 Dominic Goodall and
Harunaga Isaacson, 2011" but his bibliography  has "Dominic Goodall and
Harunaga Isaacson. ?Tantric Hinduism.? In The Continuum Companion to Hindu
Studies, edited by Jessica Frazier. Leiden: Brill, 2011".

Are these the same article?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
