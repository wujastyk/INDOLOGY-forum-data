Respected Scholars,
In the initial Benediction ( Mangalacharan) in Madhusudan Saraswati's AdwaityaSiddhi, ends with the line-
" Mokham Prapt Ib Vishnuvikalp'jit"
While going through the commentary on AdwaityaSiddhi, I came to know that the word"Vishnu" in the benediction signifies "Jiva" and not Lord Vishnu .
If anyone may kindly enlighten me on this point, as to why the word"Vishnu" has been taken as "Jiva",in this context.RegardsAlakendu Das&nbsp;
