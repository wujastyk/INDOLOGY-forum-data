About the book:

Through an analysis ofarchaeological and literary data, this book explores two interrelated themes:the socio-economic and cultic processes that resulted in the decline of IndianBuddhism in its last strongholds ? Bihar and Bengal ? towards the end of theearly medieval period, and the patterns of revival of Buddhism in theneighbouring province of Uttar Pradesh, c. 2005-2011 CE. These themes have beenexplored by undertaking an analysis of the developments?in the social histories of other competing religions: Hinduism, Jainism and ?j?vika-dharma. By placing emphasis on the religious praxis and behaviour of the non-elite segment of population, this book offers some significant ?from below? perspectives on the social histories of Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and ?j?vika-dharma in eastern and northern India.
