[*apologies for cross-posting*]


Dear colleagues and friends,



In this first day of Paryushan, Tine Vekemans, Chris Miller and myself are
thrilled to announce our new collaborative speaker series *?Dialogues in
European Jain Studies?*.



?Dialogues in European Jain Studies? features new and original research in
Jain Studies taking place across Europe, with presentations from two
emerging scholars undertaking related research, followed by a discussion
emceed by an expert, and a Q&A session with the audience.



As a collaboration between the Arihanta Institute, Ghent University, and
the University of Birmingham, we will discuss a variety of topics and
methodologies ranging from philosophical, anthropological, historical,
philological, or applied approaches to Jain Studies.



See detailed programme attached and below, do not hesitate to circulate!



Starting in October, this event will take place online the first Monday of
the month, from 4-5.30 pm UK/5-6.30 pm CET.

To join our discussions, register now at:

Looking forwards to seeing you there!



Kind regards,



Marie-H?l?ne
