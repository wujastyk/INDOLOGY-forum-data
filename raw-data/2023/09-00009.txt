Dear all,

Does someone know the source of Mallin?tha's definition of viyogin? ad
Kum?rasambhava 4.1: vi?ame sasaj? guru? same sabhar? lo 'tha gurur viyogin?
? In the appendix to Velankar's  Jayad?man, only the Mand?ramarandacamp? is
listed as having a metre named viyogin?. Others define the metre as
Vait?l?ya (e.g., Vallabhadeva) and Velankar has a note on this as well. I
checked a couple of other works but have not been able to find
Mallin?tha's/Apte's definition. Thanks!

All the Best,
Victor
