Dear all,

Just an update ? Apple did not change behaviour here (noting nevertheless that Indic 1 shaping is deprecated). Microsoft made some changes in Office, resulting inadvertently in the fonts using old shaping to not work. This is now being investigated and I believe it will be fixed in the future. I will post another update once that happens.

Thank you for reaching out,
Jan
