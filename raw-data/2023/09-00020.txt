Dear list members,

Does anyone have a PDF of this article: Mayeda, S. (1980). "?a?kara and
Sure?vara: their exegetical method to interpret the great sentence '*tat
tvam asi'*," The Adyar Library Bulletin, vol. 44?45,1980-81, pp. 147-160.
I'd greatly appreciate a copy.

Thanks in advance!
Manjushree.
