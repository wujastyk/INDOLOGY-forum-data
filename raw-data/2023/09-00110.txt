*Description*
This book details the developmental history of narratives that affirm,
condemn, modify, or ignore the controversial execution of ?amb?ka, a minor
R?m?ya?a character of low social standing. Changing socio-political
sentiments throughout Indian history have forced numerous revisions to the
?amb?ka story, placing it in an underappreciated position of influence.

*Contents*
Foreword (by Paula Richman): S?ambu?ka?s Story across Time and India?s
Regions
1. Introduction: S?ambu?ka?s Death Toll
2. S?ambu?ka?s Earliest Death
3. First Responders
4. The Uttarara?macarita and S?ambu?ka?s Purpose in Death
5. The Accident or the Execution
6. S?ambu?ka Lives on Ramtek Hill
7. The Anti-Caste Revolutionary
8. S?ambu?ka in the Twenty-First Century
9. Conclusion: S?ambu?ka and the Ra?ma?yan?a Tradition

With best wishes,
Aaron
