Dear Indologists,

 

This is a recent article in the Wire. 

 

https://thewire.in/religion/bjp-defend-orthodox-position-sanatana-dharma-meanings-dont-matter

 

Do the Indologists have any comments on the interpretation of the term ?San?tana Dharma? as discussed in the article? 

 

Thank you.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
