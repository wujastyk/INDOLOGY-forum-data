Dear all,

Do any of you happen to have a pdf of Albrecht Weber's 1871 edition of the
Taittir?ya Sa?hit? Books I-IV (Indische Studien vol. 11)? As far as I can
see, archive.org only has the second (1872) volume. I know the Titus
version of the text is Weber's, but I'd ideally like to check the original.

Many thanks,
      Antonia
