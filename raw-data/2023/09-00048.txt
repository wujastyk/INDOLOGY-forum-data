Message-ID: <CAGr5HvTfEiRiVWmG6jOQfRHLrVvDjY6Dsa9YoaeoO-aKREiNRA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,


I like to announce a recently published book of mine:



*Harald Wiese: Sanskrit as an Indo-European Language, Heidelberg:
Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing, 2023. *

978-3-948791-7-66 (Softcover), ISBN 978-3-948791-7-59 (PDF), DOI:
https://doi.org/10.11588/hasp.1238



Content:

Students of Sanskrit can choose among several good textbooks. This book is
not an alternative textbook for learning Sanskrit. Instead, it is to
accompany these textbooks and written in the hope to make Sanskrit learning
easier by explaining words and grammatical forms from an Indo-European
point of view.



The book has been published by Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing (HASP).
It is available by free download from the publisher's website and can also
be bought as a softcover through the usual channels.
