Dear Tim,

I did see your message, I was hoping my enquiry would yield me an actual font file, not only list of font names without version. I am not doubting your claims and I don?t think it has anything to do with PostScript.

It would be also helpful to know whether the same problem now occurs in Word/Outlook app on Android and/or iPhone.

Thanks,
Jan

Dear Jan,

In my first message (in the chain below) I listed fonts that DO function properly in Microsoft Word, Outlook, etc.  They are all ttf, ttc, or otf fonts.
I am using Office for Mac 16.77, running OS Big Sur 11.7.1, and others on the message board I linked to are having the same problem running OS 12 (Monterey).  I have not noticed similar problems with other Indic fonts, but I have not yet had occasion to test them.
The fonts that I have found NOT to work only in Microsoft programs on Mac are:

AA_Nagari_Shree_L3
Arial Unicode MS
Devanagari MT (partial fail)
Kalimati
Sanskrit 2003
Sanskrit 2020
Shree Devanagari

This thread on the list began by noting that Siddhanta and Adishila fonts also malfunction in Word on Mac.
None of these, I think, are PostScript fonts, which have been deprecated.  Arial Unicode MS is no longer (as of very recently) being maintained, but it certainly should still be functional.

Best,
Tim

I can have a look and/or escalate, can anyone send me or point to a pair of fonts that does and doesn?t work, such as the Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru, and possibly the version of Word where it no longer works?

Thanks,
Jan

Dear colleagues,

I, too, and no doubt many others are having this or similar problems with various Unicode-compliant ttf/ttc and otf Devan?gar? fonts when used in Microsoft Office software.  This is a headache because I have numerous documents using Arial Unicode for the Devan?gar?, and now when I open them in Word, or paste text from them into Outlook, all the conjunct glyphs are decomposed with virama.  (Those fonts still work fine in other softwore, e.g., TextEdit, LibreOffice, etc.)

I have in fact posted to Microsoft discussion board about this, but I have received no useful guidance:
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/microsoft-office-for-mac-has-stopped-displaying/ebd3fba8-edac-42e0-954b-cfcdc58679f8

I have compiled a list of fonts that DO still work for me in Word (and display properly in Outlook):

Baloo
Devanagari Sangam MN
Gotu
ITF Devanagari
Kohinoor Devanagari
Lava Devanagari
Mukta
Noto Sans Devanagari
October Devanagari
Sama Devanagari
Shobhika Devanagari
Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit (or Hindi)

The list of fonts that no longer work for me include such common ones as Arial Unicode MS and Sanskrit 2003/2020, along with several others.

Best,
Tim

Namaste,

I use siddhanta font heavily in my work. I found that after a recent MS-Word update, the Siddhanta font rendering is broken. More specifically, the ?????????????? are being displayed in their ?????? forms. The Adishila base font seems fine. But Adishila Dev Guru font also has the same issue.

Please see the screenshot below, each of the three bullet points are rendered in Siddhanta, Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru fonts respectively.

[cid:image001.png at 01D9E9D5.9FB0A4C0]

Could anyone help me if there is a configuration that I may be missing? Or do you see the same issue ?

I use MS Word (Office-365), on a MAC.

Thanks and Regards,
Viswanath.
