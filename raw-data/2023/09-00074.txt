Very sad news, indeed,
I had a very pleasant (last) exchange with him last summer, concerning an archive photography here found, on which picture Bruno Dagens is seen behind Etienne Lamotte, in the garden of the latter's property when Lamotte was celebrating his emeritus with a few colleagues, on the 8th of October 1974 ? Bruno Dagens was in charge of the Sanskrit course in Louvain for a few years after Lamotte's retirement.

He came back to Louvain(-la-Neuve then) as member of the jury of my habilitation degree in 2007.
Among his last works, there is a nice portrait of the late Jacques Dumar?ay, his friend, issued in the BEFEO 107, 2021, pp. 11-45, and the Trait? de l'habitat: Le Mayamata: Morceau choisis, introduits, comment?s et traduits du sanskrit, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, s?rie indienne, 2022.
Best wishes to him,
Christophe
