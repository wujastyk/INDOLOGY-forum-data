Input Conventions

Here is how to input each phoneme:

? a ?   ? ? aa  ? i     ? ? ii  ? u     ? ? uu
? ? r? .r       ? ? r?? .rr     ? ? l? .l       ? ? l?? .ll
? e     ? ai    ? o     ? au
?? ? ? .m       ?? ? .h
? k     ? kh    ? g     ? gh    ? ? f ?n
? c     ? ch    ? j     ? jh    ? ? ~n
? ? .t  ? ?h .th        ? ? .d  ? ?h .dh        ? ? .n
? t     ? th    ? d     ? dh    ? n
? p     ? ph    ? b     ? bh    ? m
? y     ? r     ? l     ? v
? ? z   ? ? .s  ? s     ? h
? ? ? _l

To represent a hiatus, either follow the convention of adding a diaeresis to the second vowel?as in pra?ga?or insert a space character between the two vowels?as in pra uga.

Cross-references

At the top of dictionary entries, immediately after the headword, there is often a list of terms that might be the same as the one you looked for, or that might be related to it, grammatically speaking. For instance, within the entry gandharva, you will find links to the entries gandharbba, gandharva?, gandharvva, gandharvva? and ga?dharva?.

These clusters of terms are generated mechanically through a set of rules, and can thus be inaccurate. Some cases are inherently ambiguous. For instance, a term that ends with -? might either be a stem or the nominative masculine singular of a term that ends with -in. I am experimenting with machine learning to address these issues, but much work remains to be done. The end goal is to make this aggregation process transparent.

As a general rule, when searching for nouns and adjectives, you should input the stem instead of a declined form, and then follow cross-references, if any. If the term you are looking for does not appear as a stem in any of the available dictionaries, you will still probably find it among suggested approximate matches.

Browsing through Terms

It is sometimes useful to browse through terms. You can jump to a given location in the dictionaries lexicon by typing the hash symbol # in the search field, followed by a few characters. While doing so, you will be presented with a list of terms that start with the prefix you typed so far. This autocomplete feature is currently only available for romanized input.

Confirming the query will bring you to the first term that starts with the prefix you typed, or, if there is none, to the closest term that follows it, lexicographically speaking. Try for instance the query #uddh?r<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23uddh%C4%81r>. Submitting the query #<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23> just brings you to the very beginning<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit/meta/pages/1> of the lexicon.

Advanced Search

It is possible to find terms that match a pattern by using wildcard characters. The question mark character ? matches a single phoneme; the star character * matches a sequence of zero or more phonemes. Note that matching is performed at the phoneme level, not at the character level. Thus a?i matches abhi, but ab?i does not match it, since bh represents a single phoneme.

It is also possible to find terms through approximate matching?sometimes called ?fuzzy matching.? The metric used for comparing strings is the Levenshtein distance<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>. This matching mode is enabled by appending a tilde ~ at the end of the search string. The query mandra~<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=mandra~>, for instance, returns terms like mandra, ma?dra, madra, mantra, etc.

Approximate matching can be performed with wildcard patterns, not just string literals. This is particularly useful for finding occurrences of a given term within compounds. The query *uddyota~<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=*uddyota~>, for instance, matches terms that end with something close to uddyota, and returns, among else, uddyota, ??ntyuddyota, ?c?roddyota, udyota, etc.
