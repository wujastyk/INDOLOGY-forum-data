Subject: [INDOLOGY] Research assistant opportunity
Message-ID: <D2FD2D74-3137-4B78-86FF-841C22B95405@ephe.psl.eu>

Dear list members,

on behalf of the project?s investigators, I am sharing here the .pdf of a call for applications for a position of research assistant (??Assegno per lo svolgimento di attivita? di ricerca??) in the framework of the PRIN2022 project ? The Wheel of Time: An Inquiry into New Sources of Late Indian Buddhism (X-XIII cents.) ?. I am told that, while the project is based at the University of Naples ? L?Orientale ? and the University of Florence, there is no obligation for the hired scholar to be based in Italy.

Kind regards,

Andrea
