On the issue of the "proper name"...

Trivalii can be a sa.mj~naa in as much as it names one particular  
group of three folds, namely that at the waist, and not just any group  
of three folds, for instance on the forehead or behind the knee.

This is presumably Vaamana's point when he applies Paa.nini's rule  
diksa.mkhye sa.mj~naayaam (2.1.50).
