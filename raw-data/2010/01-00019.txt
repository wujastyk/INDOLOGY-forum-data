"As for the acceptance of the Nagari script as the standard script for Sanskrit the names of Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, the great nineteenth century reformer who fought for women's rights since the 1840s and published his editions in Devnagari, and that of Bhudev Mukhopadhyay who worked for the propagation of Hindi  -- both were Bengali and stationed at Calcutta --  may be mentioned."

The firm Isvaracandra Vidyasagara's Sons published a lot of classics in both Nagari and Bangla script.  My institution has a lot of them.  I don't have time right now to see whether the ones we have go back to the father's time.  A search of WorldCat with the same question in mind would also be fruitful (though it is possible early cataloging did not specify the script).
