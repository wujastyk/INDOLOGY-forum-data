Arlo: I assume you want a built-in font (or standard unicode font) to be able to share documents in word processor form, etc. without the need for the recipient to have an Indological font?

I don't think this is possible for a tilde over an m or the chandrabindu, but r with a subscript dot must be possible (if only for the fact it appears properly in email on a Mac and can be copy-pasted properly in a document).  I use Gandhari and Gentium and I have never found a keystroke that creates it (keyboard viewer doesn't show it nor does the Word insert symbol function).

Under Systems Preferences: select Language and Text, then Input Sources, then Keyboard and Character Viewer (make sure it is on); then go down the list and select US extended (you will also see that you can use devanagari and gujarati etc). This enables the diacritics with only one extra stroke.

For example, a long vowel stroke is Option A plus the letter (this will give you the stroke over any letter); a dot under a letter, for example, is Option X plus the letter (this will give you the dot under any letter); for the diacritic over the s (sh) for example, hit Option E plus letter; others include Option n and Option W for dots over a letter etc.
