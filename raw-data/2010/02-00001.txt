Not quite: the _Academy_ had its first meeting a week ago. The  
Sanskrit Wikipedia is much older (I know, because I've written in it  
and corrected a bit of the sometimes embarrassingly poor Sanskrit  
too). I find the idea of a Sanskrit Wikipedia very sympathetic, but  
till now the quality both of language and of content leaves a thing or  
two to be desired. The fact that much of the information provided on  
the Wikipedia pages about the Sanskrit Wikipedia is not in Sanskrit,  
but in Hindi (why?...), is food for thought. (So let's help and do  
something about it! we who call ourselves Sanskritists!)

Nothing against that, but -- we also have our very own  
faq.indology.info Wiki, started by Dominik some time back. He seems to  
be the only person who has written a real article in it till now (I  
must hang my head in shame and confess I didn't get much further yet  
than extending the frame for http://faq.indology.info/index.php/Languages_and_Writings 
  - but I am working on something to upload. Really).
