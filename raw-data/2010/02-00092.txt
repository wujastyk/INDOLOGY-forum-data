The earliest version of the name we come across in Tamil is v?ra?av?ci in Kalittokai 24.13 of the Classical Tamil literature. There are places called v?ra?av?ci in today's Tamil Nadu too.

>>> I am tempted to add, in the section on mispronunciations, an entry on "vaaraaNasii" (as the name of the city), with a note to the effect that, for the same reasons as given for "mahaabhaarata" and "raamaayaNa," the third syllable in this name is the least appropriate place to apply a stress accent.  But I have been struck over the years by the frequency with which many people I respect as experts on Banaras habitually lengthen and stress the vowel in the third syllable---so much so that I wonder whether they might be following some local tradition unknown to me, despite the official spelling of the name.  Are they?  Is there any good reason to make the third "a" vowel in "Varanasi" long?
