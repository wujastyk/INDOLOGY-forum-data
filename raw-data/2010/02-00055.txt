Gary,

Are you sure the persons concerned were not referring to the rivers Vara.naa
and Asi (sometimes in a dvandva) that give rise to the name Vaaraa.nasii?

First you speak of "stress accent," then you employ "lengthen and stress,"
and finally you speak only of "long." This puzzles me. Pl clarify which
specific phonetic feature you have in mind.

To turn to other irritating things, "Hindi" and "Hindu," misspelling of
"Gandhi" as "Ghandhi" or "Ghandi".
