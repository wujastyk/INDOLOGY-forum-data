Not sure whether colleagues are conversant with this Sanskrit Wikipedia link
(sa.wikipedia.org), and what the consensus opinion is;  from a very brief
look it appears only short articles for some entries, some partly in Hindi.
It might be a good venue for centralizing links for Sanskrit digital
documents, audio recordings, videos, university websites, etc.

It was started last week by a team of Samskrita Bharati volunteers in
Bangalore
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Academy/India/2010/Bangalore1

additionally, we might think of starting some pages on scholarpedia.org?
