Dear Colleagues,
Baraha worked with my Windows 7. iLEAP did not work. But it accepted a new non-unicode inscript processor similar to iLEAP. But otherwise my experience with Windows 7 has not been happy. It does not accept the old DOS based conventional programming languages. 
I do not know if I have read it correctly but It seems that Windows aims at keeping its users? more and more dependent on it by withdrawing the opportunities of independent programming. My vendor advised me to instal the new?Windows based?Visual Basic Studio (Visual Studio 2008)to do programming as one formerly did with TC or QB. The Acrobat writer began to function only after that. It has some user friendly packages. That may be useful for commercial users. And, apparently, things are better.?But, perhaps, freedom is curtailed.? For me it?may take time to get used to the new set up.?To make things as good as with the previous version, it seems advisable to keep a Windows?XP ready.? However since I am no expert more knowledgeable colleagues may kindly comment.
Best for all
DB?

I am a big fan of Baraha.? When I first made the shift to Windows 7, Baraha produced the infamous boxes, etc.? However, I think I caused the problem by changing the settings in the "Region and Language" area of the control panel (something that I think was required in XP, but apparently not in Windows 7).? I set everything back to default, and Baraha started to work. Incidentally, I use Baraha Direct, and type directly into Word 2007.

I realize Windows and Word are for those of us trapped in this world of nescience, but they do have great utility, and I find that with them (and Baraha) I am able to easily produce serviceable devanagari.
