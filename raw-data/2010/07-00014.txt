Subject: Access to Updated Vedic Concordance
Message-ID: <161227089885.23782.2833799963722461004.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List, 



My latest computer crash has cost me access to a a few valuable resources, which I had thought would be easily available online, so I didn't make backups of them. 



One of these is the updated version of Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance [which I own in its book version].? This updated version was done by Marco Franceschini in 2005.? In my google searches?for this I get only pages that say that this document?is no longer freely accessible. 



Is this correct? 



Thanks for any help. 



George Thompson
