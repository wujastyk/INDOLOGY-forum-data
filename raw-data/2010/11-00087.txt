> 
> The Research Associate will research and write under the supervision of the Principal Investigator a Ph.D. thesis relating to the project goals, preferably a critical edition with translation and commentary of a previously unpublished text on Sanskrit computational astronomy. He or she is also expected to assist (at a workload of 12 hours per week) in the design, maintenance, and data entry for the database and digital text processing resources created by the project investigators for the study of Sanskrit astronomical texts.

> 
> * sufficient knowledge of and interest in some combination of relevant fields of study, within history of the mathematical sciences and/or Indology, to design and complete under the supervisor's guidance a doctoral thesis relating to the project's objectives.
> 
> * initiative and adaptability to cope with tasks in the Research Associate
> workload ranging from routine data entry to learning (with assistance from the project investigators) the use of new software tools and techniques for software design and implementation.
>
