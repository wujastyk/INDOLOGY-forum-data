This is irresistible, but speaking of "h"-s there is that little matter of 
the transformation of the Sanskrit "s" to the Persian "h"--not an "error" at 
all, or is it?

And, these lines, I always take pains to teach students to pronounce "phala" 
with an aspirated "p" sound, and not to confuse it with the "f" sound that 
is represented by "ph" in English (as in "nephew").  This year, however, I 
have a student (a native Bengali speaker) who pronounces it as as "fala".  I 
hesitate to "correct" him (I spend enough time trying to "get" his 
pronunciation of initial "a"-s which, of course, he pronounces [as do tens 
of millions of his countrymen] as "o-s").  When we discussed this, he 
cheerfully informed me that we really never can be sure exactly how native 
Sanskrit speakers pronounced their words.

By the way, I've brought to the attention of my introductory Sanskrit class 
some of the central elements of this topic (no names of course).  It led to 
a lively class discussion--in fact, much to my regret (and my students' 
glee), we barely had time for our translation work.

regards,

Herman
