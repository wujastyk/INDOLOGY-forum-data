Dear Colleagues,

I am working on a piece about translation in India pre-1800 and wonder if anybody has written on inscriptions which appear in more than one language. I am thinking of things like the way that Ashokan inscriptions have the same messages localised to the speech of different locations. Are there any examples from more recently of rulers issuing edicts in several scripts and languages?

thanks

Peter
