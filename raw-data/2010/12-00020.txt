Perhaps I am a bad reader, but to me it is as if the author of Unicorns in Ancient India truly believes there existed once in the wild an artiodactyl animal with one horn only in South Asia. Since there is not the slightest hint whatsoever in the whole article as to the taxonomy of this enigmatic creature, it is unclear whether the author presents his personal opinion or that of the Vedic Indians (who might perhaps have believed indeed in such a ruminant).
 
The only single-horned artiodactyl ungulates I am aware of roamed northern America during the Mio-Pliocene, such as Synthetoceras and family and the dromomerycids.
