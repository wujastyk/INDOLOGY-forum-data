I just acquired a new computer with Windows 7. I downloaded Gandhari Unicode fonts and tried, but failed, to download the Keyman keyboard layout. Can someone kindly tell me how to acquire the necessary keyboard accessory for the Gandhari Unicode fonts with Windows 7.
 
Many thanks in advance.
 
Best,
Ken
