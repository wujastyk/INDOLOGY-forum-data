I would be interested in having comments
on the Tamil form: ??????? [v?ra??ci].

See the Tamil Lexicon (p. 3610)

??????? v?ra??ci, n. < V?ra?as?. Benares, situate between the rivers 
Vara?? and As?; ????. ??????????? ???????????? (???. 13, 3).

See also another entry (p.3609), which gives a different spelling.

?????? v?ra?aci, n. < v?ra?as?. See ???????. (????. ??.)

The authority quoted by the Tamil Lexicon for the spelling v?ra??ci is 
the Ma?im?kalai
and comes from the chapter that tells the story of ?????????.
