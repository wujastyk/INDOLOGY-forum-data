Dear Ashok,
I am not sure what you mean by "early sources", but I believe there is plenty of unambiguous evidence that Raa.dhaa was primarily the name of a region, or perhaps the conglomerate of two regions often specified at Dak.si.na- and Uttara-Raa.dhaa, and one that is associable with what we now know as Bengal. See the several references under this toponym in Puspa Niyogi, Brahmanic Settlements in Different Subdivisions of Ancient Bengal. Calcutta, Indian Studies: Past & Present, 1967.

The expression used there is raa.dhaa-purii, not raa.dhaa-de;sa (which would not fit the metre anyway). This gives rise to a new question: Did Sircar in fact have unambiguous evidence in early sources to suppose that Raa.dha/Raa.dhaa was a country name, as distinct from a city name? I keep my mind open on the issue. Perhaps Richard Salomon, who knows Sircar's writings better than I do, can explain why Sircar (and possibly others) thought of Raa.dha/Raa.dhaa as a country name associable with Bengal and for how long this view is current among scholars.

On pp. 125-128, he makes a good case for a wider meaning of Gau.da, 'eastern countries/regions (of India),' mainly on the basis of post-10th century sources. The lifetime of the Prabodhacandrodaya author, as you note, is the 11th century. It is, therefore, not implausible that in his perception Raa.dhaa extended up to the eastern region of Kaaverii's flow (if Raa.dhaa was primarily not the name of that region).
