Dear Colleagues,

The Aryabhatiya (499 AD) actually defines koti as the 7th power of ten in chapter II (Ganita) 2, which enumerates the successive powers of ten, from one (= ten to the power of zero) : eka.m da'sa ca 'sata.m ca sahasramayutaniyute tathaa prayutam / ko.tyarbuda.m ca v.rnda.m sthaanaat sthaana.m da'sagu.na.m syaat //

>Dear Colleagues,

>I have a question that Randy Kloetzli has asked me to communicate to INDOLOGY: "Is there some scholarship regarding the number known as the  koti? Its value is 10 to the 7th power or 1 followed by 7 zeroes. Monier-Williams says only that it is the largest of the old order of numbers."

>If a conversation emerges here, I will communicate it to Randy. Or you could write him offline at catrandu at comcast.net.
