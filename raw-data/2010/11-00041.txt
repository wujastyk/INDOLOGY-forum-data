Sorry for the repeated message, but my original post didn't display the 
actual text.

Does anyone know how I can get hold of a copy of the film:
Atha Vajapeyah Somayagah: The Vajapeya Sacrifice
produced by J.A.B. van Buitenen, 1955.

My inter-library loan people sent me this message:
"We have exhausted all possible ILL sources.
There are no libraries that own this item that are ILL suppliers.
Additionally, I have conducted online research
and have been unable to locate the film as cited."

I would really appreciate it if someone could loan me a copy
or let me know whether such a film exists or not.

Cheers
