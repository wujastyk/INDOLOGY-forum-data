Dear All,

I am in search of a parallel in Sanskrit for the following verse from  
the Vajirabuddhi??k?

upoggh?to pada? c' eva padattho padaviggaho
codan? pratyavajj?na? by?khy? tantassa chabbiddh?

The six terms as given in this verse do not tally with the standard  
terms (sambandha, pada, padattha, padaviggaha, codan?, parih?ra)  
given in the P?li literature from ca. the tenth century onwards as  
the categories relevant for writers of commentaries. Words like  
upoggh?ta, pratyavajj?na, vy?khy? used in this verse make it  
probable that Vajirabuddhi based himself on some Sanskrit source.

Below are the terms for which alternatives are used in P?li literature:

upoggh?ta = sambandha = nid?na? = nidassana?
codan? = anuyoga = c?lan?
parih?ra = paccupa??h?na? = pratyavajj?na?


Any suggestions are welcome.
