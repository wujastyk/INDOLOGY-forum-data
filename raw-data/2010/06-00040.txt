Mark Singleton in his _Yoga Body: The Origin of Modern Postu
Dear Ken,

Mark Singleton in his _Yoga Body: The Origin of Modern Posture Practice_ (OUP, 2010) discusses S?ryanamask?r and the history of its modern assimilation at some length, and provides further references.

Best regards

On behalf of a student, I would like to ask if there are any textual
references to the so-called Suuryanamaskaara exercise, which forms part
of many modern forms of yoga. 

Feel free to contact me off-line.

Best,

Ken
