In Europe, the names used abroad tend to be older, rather than new  
and altered!  Obviously Cologne and Monaco are is closer to the  
original than K?ln and Munchen, etc.  More interestingly, the English  
use the original Celtic name Ratisbon for German Regensburg, which  
comes from the later Roman name Castra Regina.  And 's-Hertogenbosch  
may be a translation of Bois-le-Duc and not the other way round (for  
the duke in question was presumably French-speaking).  I'd be  
surprised if there aren't such cases in India too.
