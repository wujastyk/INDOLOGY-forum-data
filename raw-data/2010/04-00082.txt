Dear Colleagues,
marking every page with a sacred symbol was certainly not the case in the Hindi manuscripts I have seen over the years (say ca. 1550 onwards) to mark every page. 
Moreover, whilst most religious works had on their first page some sacred formula such an an homage to Ganesha, secular works, such as slips of paper containing lists of ingredients for a remedy didn't normally carry any such special formula. 
The illustrations at the back of my catalogue of the
 Hindi manuscripts at the Wellcome Institute showed this. 

regards
Peter Friedlander
