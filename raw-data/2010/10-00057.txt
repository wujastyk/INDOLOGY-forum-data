I apologize if this question is a terribly ignorant one, but I was wondering 
if there is any scholarly literature or any discussion of the significance 
of the Indic "18" (dominant in the Mahabharata--books, days of war, etc., 
etc., and then reiterated in the Puranas in the so-called "major" and 
"minor" books denotation).  This has long seemed to me to be some sort of 
convenient fiction used to tie up loose ends (not unlike the twelve 
disciples of Jesus recalling the twelve tribes of Israel).  However, as I 
sat in an introductory Buddhism lecture today, and was reminded about the 
famed 18 schools of the Mahasanghika(s), I started to think, there might be 
a bit more (or, perhaps no more at all).  Thanks.
