Dear Matthew Kapstein,

thanks for your comment (and thanks for forwarding Jonathan Silk's 
comment)

Adding one more brain-storming style question, I would be interested 
in hearing from you or from others about the logic hidden behind the 
division of the /N&#257;tya&#347;&#257;stra/ into 36 chapters or into 
37 chapters.

Is it known who preferred having 36 chapters and who preferred having 
37?

Did the preferrence have anything to do with the religion of the 
"editor/transmitter"?

Sorry if all these questions appear idle but I believe that in some 
contexts the only way to (discreetly) "make a statement" was to chose 
a different number :-)
