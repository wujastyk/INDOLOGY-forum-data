The S?k?m?gama is a hitherto unpublished and important ?aiv?gama dealing with many Saiva rituals as they are performed in temples. It is held to be one of the twenty-eight fundamental scriptures of the ?aivasiddh?nta.
The present volume furnishes a critical edition of the first thirteen chapters, out of a total of about a hundred. The edition is based on the collation of eight paper manuscripts and is prefaced by an introduction (both in English and in Sanskrit) that gives a detailed summary of the edited text. The reader will find here treatment of many rites, such as the pu?y?havacana (a rite rarely described at length in other scriptures), the preparation of the pa?cagavya, rites for the worship of Siva in temples, the fire worship, and finally a very detailed description of the grand temple festival.

Keywords: ?aiva, ?aivasiddh?nta, ?gama, ritual

About the editors:

S. Sambandha?iv?c?rya has been working in the French Institute of Pondicherry since 1969 in the project of critically editing the ?aiv?gama-s. Coming from a family of temple priests, well versed in the domain of temple rituals and with a long experience in reading various ancient scripts he has rendered great help in the first critical editions of ?gama-s such as the Mata?gap?rame?vara, S?rdhatri?atik?lottara, Rauravottara, Ajita and D?pt?gama.
T. Ganesan has been working as a Senior Researcher in the French Institute of Pondicherry since 1985. His current research project A Comprehensive History of ?aivasiddh?nta in Tamilnadu involves the work of surveying the contents of the entire gamut of ?aivasiddh?nta literature (Sanskrit and Tamil). The first critical edition of the ancient ?aiva text, Varu?apaddhati along with the unpublished commentary of Nigamaj??na II is one of his main research publications concerning the ?aiva ritual system.
