? propos "North": Devanagari was not used in Kashmir until it was 
established under Hindu (Dogra) rule (second half of the nineteenth 
century). Previously, Sanskrit was written exclusively in (Proto-)Sarada 
characters. The Pandits, being unaccustomed to it, adopted Nagari only 
hesitantly and not without reservation.
See the reports of Buehler and Stein;
also Witzel, Kashmiri Manuscripts and Pronunciation; Witzel, The Brahmins if 
Kashmir.
