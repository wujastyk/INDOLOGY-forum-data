I have the whole edition, in the book form, of the Arths.aasrta-vyaakhyaa - JayamaNgalaa, ed. by G.Harihara Sastri, and published in 1958 from the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute, Madras. 

 

The commentary was first published in instalments in the Journal of the Oriental reseach Institute, and later it was issued in the book form. The first part of the commentary was originally punlished likewise in the same volume of the Journal.

> 1) This was published in Sarasvatibhavana Granthamala, Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi with three other commentaries. I have two parts of volume one, and two parts of volume two. However, the second part of volume one ends at the 12th chapter of the first book of the AS. The first part of the second volume begins with the first chapter of the second book. Theoretically, therefore, there should be a third part of the first volume. I have not been able to locate it anywhere. Do you all know whether that part containing chapter 13-21 of the first book was ever published?
