Dear colleagues,
It is noteworthy that? trival? can?t be formed as a sam?h?ra Compound.? If we try to form it by P?n.ini? 2.1.51 taddhit?rthottarapadasam?h?re ca the derivation will be tisr.n.?m val?nam sam?h?rah.
1.The sam?sa is ?ordained by 2.1.51,
2.it is characterized as ?dvigu by 2.1.52 sankhy?purvo dviguh.After that
3.it takes singular by 2.4.1 dvigur ekavacanam and ??neuter gender by 2.4.17 sa napumsakam.
As a result ?trivali a neuter ?gender Compound word ending in short /i/ is formed. 
Now we cannot replace the short vowel of trivali by long one by any of the three gan?as?tras relating to 
4.1.45? bahv?dibhya? ca? as the sutra ?4.1.14 anupasarjan?t ??recurs? there.???? vali is an upasarjana as a compound form.We can?t convert it into a feminine form as only a dvigu? ending in /a/ can be in feminine by prescribing ??n??p? by 4.1.21 dvigoh.? As such we will have to convert vali into val? and then trival? may be formed by? the v?rttika ??kap?rthivadinam siddhaya? uttarapadalopasyopasamkhy?nam[s?kapriyah p?rthivah ??kap?rthivah]and the derivation will be triparimit? val? ?trival?.

After Jay?ditya?s explanation of P.2.1.51 taddhit?rthottarapadasam?h?re ca when, of a compound?formed after 2.1.50 the final meaning is that of a taddhita suffix or when a third word (uttarapada) follows the compound or when an ensemble is meant one gets a tatpuru?a compound. This uttarapada compound is different from the uttarapadalopin compound commonly illustrated with si?h?sana ?lion (marked) ?seat ?ie a throne?. Naturally trilokan?tha (Kum?rasambhava 5.77) has been explained by Mallin?tha as an uttarapada compound. This is implied also in the explanation of trilokasaundarya ?(5.41).
trival? ?is neither an uttarapadalopin nor an uttarapada compound. An ensemble is meant. Naturally 2.1.50 and 51 are sufficient for forming the compound without invoking the concept of uttarapadalopin.? The ga?as?tra 50 appended to 4.1.45 takes care of the long ? of words like trival?.

Dear List Members,

Can anyone help finding a reference in Paninian literature for the
lengthening of the final vowel of trivali to trivalI in compounds?

MW says "f. in comp. the 3 folds over a woman's navel (regarded as a beauty)
VarB?S. lxx , 5 ?itus. GarP."

I have looked in P. 6.3.114-139, which appears to be the relevant section,
but may have missed something.

With thanks,
Oliver
