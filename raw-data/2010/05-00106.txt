Dear Patrick,

I don't think this botanical explanation by Pr. Michaels is appropriate. Georg Thibaut, who was the first to edit the Baudh.'Sulb., expressed the view that the very peculiar value of 34 tila for an a'ngula is related to the existence of an approximate value to the square root of 2 (Baudh 'Sulb. I.61) which uses the 34th part of an a'ngula (JASB, vol.44, 1875, p.227). In a recent article (Centaurus, vol.47, 2005, p.60), I also showed that the value of 14 a.nu for an a'ngula is related to the unattested approximate value of 7 + 1/14 to the diagonal of a square of side 5 and to the attested common and gross procedure for transforming a circle into a square (Baudh.'Sulb.I.60 for instance).

Best regards,

Jean Michel Delire


>Patrick,
>according to Baudh SulvS I.16 together with I.7 and I.3 one aratni would come to 45.7 cm given that the measurement for one angula is 3/4 inch. (c. 1905 cm). This calculation is based on botanical consideration, i.e. 1 angula = 34 tila (sesam indicum) or 14 aNu (panicum miliaceum). According to my perhaps outdated view (see my Beweisverfahren in der vedischen Sakralgeometrie, 1978, pp. 156-7) the differences depend on whether the seeds are taken with or without husk and measured by breadth or length.

>Friends: here is a question. I am trying to get the measurement of the Sanskrit aratni. Both M-W and Bohtlingk gives the old measurement "ell" -- which is said to be 45 inches (1.14 meters). This surely cannot be if the measurement is from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Apte gives the measurement as 24 angulas (i.e., about 47 cms.). The latter is also the measurement given by Basham in his Wonder.
