One of the most prominent collectors/preservers at that time was the then nascent VVRI Institute, Lahore, later shifted to Hosiarpur. They survived the partition holocaust but, later,?many mss had to be given back to the original proprietors for whom the VVRI had preserved those. 
Will this help?

Has anyone come across the bookseller and manuscript dealer Bhajan Lal, who
was active in Amritsar and Bharatpur in the 1920s-1940s?? He sold many
manuscripts through Banarsi Das, Lecturer in Hindi at Lahore Oriental
College (and colleague of Woolner), both to Lahore and to the Wellcome
Library in London.? Many MSS in these collections have his distinctive
dealers label stuck to their covers.

I would be interested to hear whether anyone else has come across this
Bhajan Lal.

Best, and thanks,
