Dear colleagues,
I would very much like to know if there is a discussion in the traditional Sanskrit grammatical literature about the nature of the combinations bahumata and saadhumata and, if so, if they were interpreted or perceived as compounds or phrases. As far as I know compounds of this type with mata are rare.
