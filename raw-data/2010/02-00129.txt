Dear Herman,
Cher Herman,

thanks a lot for sharing your deeply felt experience with your students
(and especially with the student from Bengal)

Since the discussion has become
very "non-academic,"
please allow me to use my full linguistic capacity
(in French)
for adding some further comments
{{otherwise, we, native French citizen, would become second zone World 
citizens :-((   }}

merci de partager votre/ton exp?rience avec vos/tes ?tudiants.
[[By using the slash ["/"]sign, I am trying to overcome
one of the translation gaps between English and French :-) ]]

C'est tr?s touchant!

"La roue tourne", sans jamais s'arr?ter!

Qui peut savoir comment les propos que nous avons ?chang?s ces derniers 
jours
seront interpr?t?s plus tard,
par les archivistes du monde?

Peut-?tre que le souvenir d'enfance (? Khartoum)
que Dominik Wujastyk a partag? r?cemment
avec nous sera utilis? plus tard par un historien (a historical linguist)
pour prouver
que certains ?gyptiens ont entendu parler de "La Tamise"
avant d'entendre parler de "The Thames".

[[(I am referring to the comparison
/thaymees/ (like "rabies")]]

Comme l'a dit Blaise Pascal,
le monde est quelque chose
"dont le centre est partout et la circonf?rence nulle part".

There is nothing wrong with that !!

Cheers

-- Jean-Luc (Paris, France)
