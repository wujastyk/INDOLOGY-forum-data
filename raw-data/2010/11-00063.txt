Raining blood (along with earthquakes, the weeping of images and many other portents) is included in an account of Adbhuta??nti in the P?rva-K?ra??gama (p. 714 of edition of 1921 [Kaliyuga 5023]):

One such work I recently had the fortune to read that has abundant discussions of seasonal rainfall and prognostication was the K??ikarmavivecana. It seemed quite closely related to the little studied genre of ?Tantric meteorology? such as can be found in the Bhairav?yamegham?l?, that it might even be best identified as a separate genre: Tantric agriculture (?). I remember seeing an MS of this in the Wellcome Institute in London but cannot now find my photocopies of it.
