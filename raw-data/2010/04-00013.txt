There is an excellent recent essay on this by Prof. Christopher Minkowski.
""Turtles All the Way Down? Tradition and Experiment in Cosmological
Reasoning."  I'm afraid I can't tell you right now where it is published.
There's a nice discussion of the generl
Turtles<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down>problem
in Wikipedia.
