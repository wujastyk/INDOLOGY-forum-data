Thankfully, the real geeks at Apple have made it easy for those of us using Macs.

It's pretty simple on the Mac (at least if your running a recent OS, 10.5x or 10.6). Download all the JPEG files with the wget command as Birgit suggested.   

In Finder navigate to the directory where the image files are stored, then simply do a Select All (? A) and Copy (? A). 

Now open your Preview application and go to File > New from Clipboard (? N) and voil?! All the image files have been added to an untitled document, which you now can save as a PDF file.

Best,
Christian

You can then create a PDF file with these images (even run OCR on them before), with, for instance Adobe Acrobat Pro (on Windows); I gather on a recent Mac OS, there should already be tools available in the operating system for the job.
