There is, at least, one copy in the library of the FU Berlin, the catalogue entry runs:

Tomson, Arthur : 
Ratnam?njusa : adhyaya 1 - 2 / Arthur Tomson, 1976. - 71 Bl. 
Berlin, Freie Univ., Diss., 1976 
Bestand: UB, Signatur: 34/76/60632(7), Standort: MAG-D,  

Since it is not found elsewhere: I guess, it's not really a "dissertation" as indicated by the bibliographical description but rather the M.A. thesis. 

Hope it helps
