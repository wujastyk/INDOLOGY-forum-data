Dr. Dominic Goodall's excellent posting, "script and Sanskrit," reminded me
that I had forgotten to finalize and mail a text I had drafted on 11
January. DG  has made my first point in a much better way -- with precise
evidence and mention of a rewarding connection with the conflation
phenomenon noticed in mss.

My text ran thus:

I have benefited considerably from the discussion that has so far taken
place. I wish to add five points to it.

1. While concluding that the association of Sanskrit with Devanagari has
grown over the latter half of the 19th century and most of the 20th century
and that historically Skt did not have exclusive association with any
particular script, we should not overlook the fact that there was a wide
enough basis in manuscripts for Skt to make its association with Nagari
