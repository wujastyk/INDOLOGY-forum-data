Edited Volume in the Comparative Studies of Indian and Chinese Philosophy and
Religion

We are pleased to announce the launching of a volume in the Comparative Studies
of Indian and Chinese Philosophy and Religion. Please consider submitting an
essay for this volume. Here are some examples of possible titles:

*Brahman and Dao
*Wuwei and the Bhagavad Gita?s notion of nonaction
*Senses, mind and the grasping of reality
*Consciousness and attention
*The inner and external worlds
*Layers of virtue and dharma
*Yoga and Daoist practices
*Chinese and Indian mythology
*Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine

 Naturally scholars grounded in Indian thought may have only a basic
acquaintance with Chinese thought, whereas scholars grounded in Chinese thought
may have only a basic acquaintance with Indian thought. However, this is a
pioneering volume aimed at building bridges between these two great cultures
and complex systems of thought, and as such, we would hope to balance the
volume with about half of the chapters written by scholars whose main area of
scholarship is grounded in Chinese thought, and the other half written by
scholars whose main area of scholarship is grounded in Indian thought.

We would also hope to balance the volume between Hinduism and Buddhism, as well
as Confucianism and Daoism, but let us first receive proposals and then
estimate the direction this volume is going. The chapters should be relatively
short, and not exceed 5000 words.

 Please send us proposals of about 150 words.

 Sincerely yours,
