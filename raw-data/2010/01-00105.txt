Dear Dominik,

In one Graha??nti type Newari manuscript I have a copy of (filmed as NGMPP reel no. E1689/4), there do seem to be some children depicted.  You can view a figure <here> that is very likely to be a child, while some others are more ambiguous.  The lower folio shows a short and chubby figure wearing the protective anklets that Newars still put on their children to ward off harmful grahas and the like.   Several of the figures in this text appear to be women, perhaps pregnant women who along with their unborn are especially vulnerable.
