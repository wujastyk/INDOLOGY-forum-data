Dear Indologists,

My forthcoming book (expected to appear late next month - with apologies for self-promotion) examines Indian Buddhist literary sources, inscriptions, and archaeological materials which illustrate links between long-distance trade and institutional expansion: 

Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange within and beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia. Dynamics in the History of Religions, vol. 2.  Brill, Leiden; Boston.

In addition to narratives referred to by other contributors to the discussion, vinaya literature (particularly the P?cittiyavagga of the P?li vinaya and the M?lasarv?stiv?da-vinaya) is a rich source for references to merchants involved in trading activities.

I think there is some material in the Katha literature -- Pancatantra, Kathasaritsagara, Hitopadesa etc. She also wants to know whether there is any secondary literature dealing with this aspect of the Katha literature. Any help would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.
