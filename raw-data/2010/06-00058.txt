Subject: [INDOLOGY] Looking for an article by Richard Salomon

Dear Colleagues,

     I am looking for Richard Salomon's 1998 article "Kharosthi manuscript fragments in the Pellior collection, Bibliotheque Nationale de France" which was published in vol 16 (pp. 123-60) of Bullitin d'etudes indiennes.  I don't see any electronic access to this journal, and the Univ of Michigan library conveniently starts its collection of this journal from the year 1999.  If anyone can provide me a digital or a print copy of this article, please write to me at:  mmdesh at umich.edu.  Thanks.
