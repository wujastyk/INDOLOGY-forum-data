Dear Indologists,

I am looking for possible distinctive descriptions of utopias /  
dystopias in Indian literature. I hope to find something that might  
parallel ideas in Plato's Republic or Thomas More's Utopia.

I am looking for descriptions of self-contained paradigmatic  
societies- either ideal or wretched.

Any ideas would be most welcome.

I hope that wherever you are it is cooler than New Delhi!
