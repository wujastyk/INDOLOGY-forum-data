Just to reiterate this point, a few centuries into the Christian era  
we also find the terms saayujya and saayojya used by those for whom  
the liberated state is not conceived of as any sort of union, and  
terms such as kaivalya used by those for whom the liberated state is  
not one of isolation, and terms such as apavarga and du.hkhaanta used  
by those who conceive of the liberated state as characterised by an  
attainment of bliss and/or power, rather than simply as a release.
