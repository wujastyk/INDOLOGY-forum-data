Allen is quite right to say that Ifrah's magnificent book should be at all
our elbows.  It's an astonishing achievement, full of valuable reference
materials for South Asianists of all stamps.  I attach a quick scan of the
page from the "Dictionary" mentioned below, that has the entry on ko?i.
This is from my 1998 edition from Harvill Press, London, titled "The
Universal History of Numbers from Prehistory to the Invention of the
Computer" (ISBN
186046324X<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Universal-History-Numbers-Georges-Ifrah/dp/186046324X>
).
