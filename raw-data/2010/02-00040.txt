There's a very good collection of tales of the
major bodhisattvas culled from the Mahayana
sutras by the 19th c. Tibetan scholar Mi pham.
There is a recent English translation:
A GARLAND OF JEWELS: The Eight Great Bodhisattvas
by Jamgon Mipham Rinpoche, trans. by Yeshe Gyamtso.
I have not yet seen it myself, but I imagine
that it is competent, if not a work of scholarship.
