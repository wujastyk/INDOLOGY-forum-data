If you have Windows 7, you can still use www.Virtualbox.org to run a genuine
WinXP session in a window on the Windows 7 desktop.   You'll need the
original WinXP installation disks, and 10GB or so of disk space.  Then you
can - in your WinXP window - run all your familiar stuff.

John Smith's Windows keyboard handler for Indic Unicode has been mentioned a
couple of times.  It's here:

   - http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/index.html

It works with Windows 7.  In his README.txt file, he says,

(On Vista or Windows 7 systems, if clicking on setup.exe fails to
> install the layout, you may need to disable Microsoft's User Account
> Control mechanism (UAC). Go into the Control Panel and type "UAC" into
> the search box. Follow the link that appears to "Turn User Account
> Control (UAC) on or off", and then uncheck the box for "Use User
> Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer", and click "OK".
> You will have to reboot for the change to come into effect.)


It's possible that these instructions may help with other keyboard-handlers
too, I don't know.
