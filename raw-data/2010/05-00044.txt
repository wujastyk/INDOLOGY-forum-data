Subject: ADMIN: Change in the "reply" function of INDOLOGY
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTinVXraNueSRasKPLfkAhznS-DSl4Iv_8yc8dlK1@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <161227089549.23782.8871546908354220000.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

An alternative might be to have all list emails come automatically tagged with "INDOLOGY" at the start of the subject line.  At least then there is an immediate visual cue that it is not a personal message (something similar has worked well, but not flawlessly, on certain others lists I use).
