Sorry for cross posting.

Dear All,

As far as I know Mahadav Desai, Gandhi's secretary, translated the
autobiography of Mahatma from gujarati.

Anyway, in some Italian book I read that the English translation was made by
Pyarelal Nayyar (Gandhi's doctor), Mirabehn, Srinivasa Sastri & the Italian
Consul Gino Scarpa.

Is that true? I mean, what is true? Do they refer to the longer and shorter
version of the autobiography?

Thank you for your answer.

Happy New Year,



Dr. Enrica Garzilli
