Jonathan,

  Try Bulkloader. Available from

It works for files with sequentially numbered filenames, and runs as fast as your connection will allow without the overhead of a full web browser.

Thanks to all; I already (on an earlier Mac OS) have long used a delightful
little piece of software called Combine PDFs, which for instance allows you
to remove and reorder and reorient pages in a multi-page document. The
problem is not putting things together but the necessity to download a long
article page by page... quicker to go to library and xerox the original, and
run that through a scanner (for a long paper, if you have access to a good
library, yes, I know).

thanks!  Jonathan
