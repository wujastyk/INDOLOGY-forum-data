A question arises as to whether 'B??a' could not be the original and that the Tamil text simply devoiced 'b' to 'p'. If 'b' were the original, the Tamil form would usually end up being 'v' as indeed Cilappatik?ram 6.54 referring to the puranic 'B??a' as 'V??a?' shows. The Cengam herostones of 6th century refer to the B??a king as 'Perump???araicar'. From 7th century, the form ''V??ak? Araicaru' is seen more and more but 'we also see 'Perump??atiyaraicar' in the 8th century. Thus if the word-initial sound is 'b', it seems to be rendered by Tamil 'v', while medial 'b' is rendered as Tamil 'p' since medially original Tamil 'p' would also sound as  'b'. In such a scenario, the name 'p??a?' in Akam. 113 with an initial 'p' instead of 'v' should most probably indicate that the original form was 'p??a?'. 

If that is correct, then we have the sound variation p-* > b- > v- in the names attested over time.

A related discussion is found in Iravatham Mahadevan's "Early Tamil Epigraphy," p. 629. However, Dr. E. Subbarayalu feels that 'p??ar???ra' mentioned in "Lokavibh?ga' may be different from Perump??app??i.

I would appreciate comments from the Indologists.

Thanks in advance.
