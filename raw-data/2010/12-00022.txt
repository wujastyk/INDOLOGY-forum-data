Long ago I read in a book by the paleontologist Bj?rn Kurt?n that there was also one in Europe (in fact two-horned, but the horns were grown together). The Western legend of the unicorn animal (Hans Henrich has right, there are no such animals in Indian traditions) is a confusion of the Ekasrnga legend (in the Physiologus) and the classical accounts (by Ctesias and Megasthenes) of the one-horned Indian ass or horse, probably referring to rhinoceros -- seasoned with the narwhal teeth. There is wide literature on the subject, apparently unknown to the author of the article.
Best,
Klaus

Since there is not the slightest hint whatsoever in the whole article as to the taxonomy of this enigmatic creature, it is unclear whether the author presents his personal opinion or that of the Vedic Indians (who might perhaps have believed indeed in such a ruminant).
