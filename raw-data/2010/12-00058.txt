Thank you. I had gotten so far, and am used to working that way. The problem is that those key combinations don't work for every imaginable combination. E.g., option + n + m will not place ? above an m. And of course it doesn't help yet for the more exotic diacritics.

Under Systems Preferences: select Language and Text, then Input Sources, then Keyboard and Character Viewer (make sure it is on); then go down the list and select US extended (you will also see that you can use devanagari and gujarati etc). This enables the diacritics with only one extra stroke.

For example, a long vowel stroke is Option A plus the letter (this will give you the stroke over any letter); a dot under a letter, for example, is Option X plus the letter (this will give you the dot under any letter); for the diacritic over the s (sh) for example, hit Option E plus letter; others include Option n and Option W for dots over a letter etc.
