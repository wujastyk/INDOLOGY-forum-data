Dear list!

 

George Thompson has recently published a critique of my translation of the
Bhagavad Gita which contains a possibly misleading piece of information.
Thompson brackets my translation in the New Age category, thereby
potentially creating the impression that I myself am a supporter of New Age
religiosity. I am nothing of the sort. I am in no way involved with New Age.

            My translation was published by a small American publisher
specialising in Yoga texts. The series also contains the Hatha Yoga
Pradipika, translated by Brian Dana Akers, as well as the Shiva Samhita and
the Gheranda Samhita, both translated by James Mallinson. More to follow.
The books mostly have the same format: a short, popular introduction, the
Sanskrit text with interlinear translation, an index. There are no
bibliographies, no comments, no critical apparatus and no footnotes. The
editions are partly intended for the mass market, partly for students of
Sanskrit and others who would like to read the text with an interlinear
translation, or simply have quick access to the Sanskrit source. Thus, they
have been stripped down to the bare essentials. I personally find it
difficult to associate these editions with New Age, but everybody can be the
judge of that.

 

Best regards,

 

Lars Martin Fosse
