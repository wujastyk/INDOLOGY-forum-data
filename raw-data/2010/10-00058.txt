Dominik,

My colleague Christopher Murphy in the African and Middle Eastern Division has supplied me with a scan, which I am sending you separately, of one of the labels on the Persian and Arabic manuscripts we bought from Probsthain, and they are Bhajan Lal's, not Probsthain's or anyone's else.  The labels are all the same.  The handwriting appears to me different from that on the mss Horace Poleman bought in 1941 and the card index thereof, and anyway there are no printed labels on those. If you want to discuss them further with Chris, his email is cmur at loc.gov, but please carbon me.
