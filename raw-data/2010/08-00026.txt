Dear Peter,

The most authoritative work on the subject is Mabuchi Kazuo???????? / ????
(1962)'s Nihon Ingakushi no kenkyuu ????????. The three-volumed masterpiece
contains numerous references to the questions you raised together with a
bewildering mass of materials that worths a lifetime's study.

Materials in English on this subject are largely preliminary both in scope
and depth, starting with Van Gulik, followed by Chauduri as others had
mentioned.

Best regards,
Bill Mak
