As far as I know Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit was not recognized as a separate language by literary critics or grammarians. There is a convention of treating all irregular forms as apa?abda. The word ?r?a ?(employment) by the sage? is used to mean the employment of irregular words by high authorities/great poets that has been accepted by critics. ?There is no term for regular ?irregularities? as in Buddhist Sanskrit. 
Since ?Da??in regional distinction in literary style has been extensively treated by literary critics from the 7th -8th century onwards. The most prominent styles were Gau?? and Vaidarbh?

Is anyone aware of traditional Sanskrit terms for Sanskrit dialects that would be equivalent to the following?

Vedic
Classical
Epic
Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit

Of course Panini distinguished between chandas and bhaa.saa and also specified usages in particular Vedic traditions (yajus, mantra, etc.).? The term 'chandas' might be taken to be equivalent to 'Vedic'.? However, I am not aware of any traditional terms for the other three.? Are you?

I ask because I proposed that tags based on these four terms be adopted as standard xml language variant subtags.? Some respondents want Indigenous terms, and are especially sensitive to the term 'classical'.? Any suggestions?

Peter
