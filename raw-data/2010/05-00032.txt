I do not know if the following will be of any help.
I hope the name of the author has been correctly reported. But I know of one Kumudranjan Das who wrote about Maharaja Krishnachandra of Nadia belonging to the middle of the eighteenth century. ?His books should be available at the Bangiya Sahitya Parishat?in?Calcutta. He was associated with the Parishat in the sixties.
If the reported Kumudnath Mallik?belonged to the Mallik family of North Calcutta whose old house still stands on the road linking the R.G. Kar Road and the Bidhan Sarani, the book might exist in the library of the family there which produced some?scholars. I?had a book written and presented by a member of the family but cannot trace it immediately. It was not about Krishnachandra
Best?

I hope this isn't an inappropriate question, but does anyone have a copy of Kumudnath Mallik's 1923 [Bengali] book Maharaja Krishnacandra?? Or know of a place besides the National Library in Kolkata where it can be found?

Many thanks,
J.
