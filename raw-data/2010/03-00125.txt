list members,

in this article:

@INCOLLECTION{Tripathi1977,
  author = {Chandrabhal Tripathi},
  title = {{Ratnama?j??? and `Chandoviciti'}},
  booktitle = {Beitr?ge zur Indienforschung},
  publisher = {Museum f?r indische Kunst},
  year = {1977},
  pages = {549-560},
  address = {Berlin},
}

i encountered a few references to an edition of the ratnama?j???, a sanskrit
work on metrics, then under preparation by arthur tomson in berlin, who had
written his MA dissertation on it.  does anyone know what happened to it?

thanks in advance.
