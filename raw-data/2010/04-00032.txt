Subject: Turtles (and elephants) all the way down?

The notion that elephants support the Earth probably comes from 
assertions about nAgas fulfilling that role, as in HarivaMza
62.24 (CE):

...nAgAnAm upariStAd bhUH...


A nAga is a snake, but it can also  be an elephant, although in 
cosmological contexts such as this one a snake seems more likely. The 
serpent ZeSa is said in the PurANas to lie below the pAtAlas and to 
uphold them and the Earth. The nAgas are also sometimes protectors of 
the four directions, and this would further explain the assignation of 
elephants to the directions.

See Niklas Muller's 1822 cosmological rendering: elephants above a 
turtle above a snake. Viewable from Gretil (top of second illustration):
