Did Sanskrit ever have a 'dedicated' script in the North??Grantha belongs to the South. A few other dedicated scripts eg., Nadinagari,?were developed in the Decaan. But none became popular in the nineteenth century. Oriya has ever been?as good for Oriya as for Sanskrit. So is Devnagari for Hindi and Sanskrit, Count Bengali, Telugu and Malayalam and Kannad too among others. And Gujarati, Newari, the?Brahmi and post-Brahmi script?and others I miss.??Similar to Latin, French, English,post-Kemal Turkish and post-war German? A situation ripe for Lewis Carroll.
