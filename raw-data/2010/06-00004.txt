Professor Norman Gerald Barrier
***********************************************************************
From: Frank F. Conlon

It is with a very sad heart that I report the death of Professor Norman Gerald 
Barrier on June 6, 2010 in Columbia, Missouri, after an eight-
month battle with brain cancer.  I just received this news from Jerry's 
collegue Paul Wallace.  Paul is travelling at the moment, and it may be some 
days before we can post a formal obituary.  In the interim, I would like to 
share just a few thoughts on the loss of this good and great friend, who has 
contributed so much to our field.

Jerry Barrier was a giant in the field of South Asian studies, especially in 
history and especially the history of the Sikhs and the Punjab.  His many 
publications helped to define that field, and his command of its bibliography 
led to broadening our awareness of its many issues. Jerry further advanced 
South Asian studies in North America through his active promotion of books and 
bibliography when he launched South Asia Books--
the premier specialist source of books from the subcontinent for many years. 
Jerry's presence at academic conference book exhibits was a source of 
stimulating information--he loved books, he knew books, and his goal was to 
place the right books in the hands of those who would use them.

Jerry was born into a deeply religious family and was, at one time, considered 
to be on the path to a ministry.  In time he decided that he did not wish to 
follow that road and turned instead to the study of history. At Duke he worked 
under that pioneer of four programs (Michigan, Chicago, Duke, Syracuse) in 
Indian history, the late Robert Crane.  Crane suggested students look at the 
legislative councils of varous Indian provinces constituted in 1892.  In point 
of fact, most of the students moved out, as Crane probably anticipated, from 
the ground of provincial politics into a far wider range of interests.  Jerry 
moved through provincial politics and land control legislation in the Punjab 
into a much broader interest in the Sikh community, its politics, culture and 
traditions.  His PhD dissertation (1966) was "Punjab politics and the 
disturbances of 1907".

Barrier was first appointed to the history faculty of Northern Illinois 
University in DeKalb, but then joined the faculty of the University of Missouri 
at Columbia, where he remained until his retirement.  He was known as an 
enthusiastic, sometimes unconventional, teacher at both undergraduate and 
graduate levels.

Along his scholarly path he developed a commanding knowledge of specialized 
bibliography and archival resources.  With all the enthusiasm that had informed 
his more youthful engagement with religious ministry, he threw his efforts into 
scholarship and bibliography.  The rest, as they say, is history.  And what a 
history, I am not sure how many books Jerry wrote or edited, nor how many 
articles and essays he published.  A later formal obituary may address that 
quantitative question.  However, from the
qualitative viewpoint, Jerry Barrier's imagination and energies were 
unparalleled.  That he could pursue his own research trajectory while also 
founding and building South Asia Books, provides a hint of his capacity for 
activity.  Here, in point of fact, I can share that Jerry had an unusually high 
metabolism.  I recall once when he visited me in Minneapolis in the winter of 
1968.  He was to sleep on a couch in my apartment where, since it was -20 
degrees farenheit outside, it was about 52 degrees inside, he declined the two 
blankets and quilt I had borrowed for his use, and slept peacefully under a 
single sheet.  In short, he was in his very being, a sort of human dynamo, able 
to strive toward complete perfection in all that he attempted.

The entry of N. Gerald Barrier in most catalogues of major libraries will bring 
forth come evidence of Jerry's prolific career.  His chosen pattern of 
publication largely focussed upon essays and articles along with 
ground-breaking foundational publications on bibliography.  He also did yeoman 
service as an active editor of collections of essays from a wide variety of 
conferences, seminars and panels on many aspects of South Asian history, and 
most especially on Sikh Studies.  I have assembled a brief list of books Jerry 
wrote and/or edited at the end of this post, but I do not warrent it to be 
complete, and I do not yet have access to a complete list of his innumerable 
essays and articles.  Jerry also plowed new furrows by exploring previously 
much ignored sources such as the various tracts collections in the India Office 
Library and he identified and brought to light the various publications in 
British India which had been banned by the colonial authorities.  The 
significant aspect of his work was that while he developed his own research 
agenda, virtually every thing he did, he could--and did--share with others.

Jerry was recognized by the University of Missouri for his outstanding 
contributions as Middlebush Chair in the Social Sciences; he was awarded 
numerous grants and fellowships and was recipient of an Indian award for his 
promotion of the Indian book trade and knowledge of Indian culture. In December 
2008, Jerry was invited to give the keynote address to a conference "Sikhism in 
a Global Context" at Riverside, CA, where he was
presented with a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' in commemoration and appreciation 
of his significant scholarly contributions in the area of Sikh Studies.

On another front, Jerry's work with books was furthered by his activiteis in 
conjunction with the Association for Asian Studies's Committee on South Asia 
Libraries and Documentation and his long-term chairmanship of the American 
Institute of Indian Studies's Publication Committee.  He was among the moving 
forces of the Punjab Studies Committee which generated conferences and 
publications in North America.

It may sound like a cliche, but I doubt that we will soon see another friend 
and scholar like Jerry Barrier--he was truly one of a kind.  Once, during one 
of our periodic conference meals together, I told him that if it must have been 
pre-ordained that he would follow his chosen path. I told him that he struck me 
as holding within himself the stature, energy and honor of the Sikhs he loved 
and studied, but with certain bania tendencies.  Sardar or bania, or both--for 
me, and many others, Jerry was, ultimately, a very good friend.  We have now 
lost that good friend, and will have only to keep his memory in our hearts.
