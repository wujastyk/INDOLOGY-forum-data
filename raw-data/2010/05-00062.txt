I am a big fan of Baraha.  When I first made the shift to Windows 7, Baraha 
produced the infamous boxes, etc.  However, I think I caused the problem by 
changing the settings in the "Region and Language" area of the control panel 
(something that I think was required in XP, but apparently not in Windows 
7).  I set everything back to default, and Baraha started to work. 
Incidentally, I use Baraha Direct, and type directly into Word 2007.

I realize Windows and Word are for those of us trapped in this world of 
nescience, but they do have great utility, and I find that with them (and 
Baraha) I am able to easily produce serviceable devanagari.
