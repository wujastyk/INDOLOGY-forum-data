There are clear verbal usages like anug?h?ta? asmi in Sanskrit literature (i.e. K?lid?sa's dramas) indicating the connection of the verb anu+grah with the term anugraha.  Check such verbal usages.  Best,

Dear esteemed colleagues,

In an inquiry apropos to the holiday season, I wonder if any of you have
ever seen a nirukta or nirvacana of anugraha, explaining its derivation,
since there is no obvious connection (that I can see) between anu + grah and
the meanings of anugraha.

thank you,
Chris
