> In later Buddhist art, (ca, 11th century and on) in India, Nepal and Tibet the elephant commonly figures as either throne supports under the seat of a Buddhist figure (often a Buddha) or as part of the side throne-back supports, in which they often support other, often mythic, animals.  From the existence of these I would suggest that elephants were an early (as early as we have sculpture of them) marker of the division between the mundane and the attained worlds.
