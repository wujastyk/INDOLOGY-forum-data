Subject: Enquiry with regard to colour symbolism in Hindu Traditions
Message-ID: <161227090664.23782.11131117047237056636.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,

An undergraduate student recently asked me about colour symbolism in  
Hindu Traditions.

I realised very quickly that I knew very little about this.

Can anyone suggest readings (primary and secondary) on this topic?

With Thanks and Best Wishes,
