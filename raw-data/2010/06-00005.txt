Concepts of Time and Their Visual and Material Aspects - Focus Asia



In the framework of Morphomata?s research on ?Morphomes of Time?, this
workshop proposes to investigate the visual and material implications
of various Asian concepts of time. The time concepts that will be
introduced vary in some of their details and in the way time is
perceived and experienced. What is of particular interest is their
translation and manifestation in the visual media and in material works
(of art). The visualization of time may be regarded as a rather vast
field. However, it has rarely been intended to portray ?time? itself
(examples for this will be discussed). Often, time manifests itself
indirectly in artworks ? thus, a specific analytical approach becomes
necessary. This workshop seeks to explore the range of visual and
material expressions of time. This will help to reveal the impact of
time concepts on cultural figurations, which, in turn, may have
retroactively affected theoretical concepts and cultural practices.
