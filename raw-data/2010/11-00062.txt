Dear list members!

is anyone of you by any chance aware / in possession of an e-text of Siddhas?ra? (I'm thinking of preparing one, it would be a pity, however, to double someone's work --- there are so many other important texts awaiting digitalization)

Thank you in advance
and with the best regards
Andrey Klebanov
