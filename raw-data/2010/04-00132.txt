Transliteration API adds 6 more
languages<http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/2010/04/transliteration-api-adds-6-more.html>
April
25, 2010We're excited to announce the addition of 6 new languages (Greek,
Russian, Serbian, Sanskrit, Amharic, Tigrinya) to the Transliteration
API<http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#Transliteration>.
Using Google Transliteration you can convert Roman characters to their
phonetic equivalent in your language. Note that this is not the same as
translation ? it's the sound of the words that are converted from one
alphabet to the other.Transliteration
API<http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#Transliteration>allows
this functionality to be available to all websites, which will make
it easier for you to add transliteration capabilities to textfields on your
webpages. Using this customizable API, you can enable users of your website
to type 19 languages<http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#TransliterationSupportedLanguages>.
For more information, please take a look at the
documentation<http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#Transliteration>
and
samples at our code
playground<http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/#transliterate_hindi>.
If you're looking for a finer level of control on your web pages, also check
out the low-level
interface<http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#LowLevelTransliteration>to
transliteration, and the font
rendering support
APIs<http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#FontRendering>
.

Google Transliteration is integrated into several Google
properties<http://www.google.com/transliterate/about.html?v=1#products>and
we have
bookmarklets <http://code.google.com/p/t13n/> in addition to API to extend
this capability to other websites. Please try these out and let us
know<http://groups.google.com/group/google-india-labs>what you think
and how you're using it.
