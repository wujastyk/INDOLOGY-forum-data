Dear? Indologists,
The Sanskrit words,both Vali and Trivali are synonymous.It ends?in short /i/.According to the Amarakos?a ,valih? pr?n?yan?gaje striy?m.Vali? means ?the? three lines? in? shrunk? stomach.Here a gan?as?tra(No.49)on 4.1.45 ?itah?? pr?n?yan.g?t? applies.n??s.? suffix is prescribed ?after? a Pr?tipadika meaning? an organ of a living being and ending in short /i/.Consequently vali + n?is? = val?.The same view has been expressed in the Ny?sa and Padama?jar?? too.
Thanks,

Dear List Members,

Can anyone help finding a reference in Paninian literature for the
lengthening of the final vowel of trivali to trivalI in compounds?

MW says "f. in comp. the 3 folds over a woman's navel (regarded as a beauty)
VarB?S. lxx , 5 ?itus. GarP."

I have looked in P. 6.3.114-139, which appears to be the relevant section,
but may have missed something.

With thanks,
Oliver
