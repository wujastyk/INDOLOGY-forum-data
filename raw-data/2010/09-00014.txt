Dear colleagues,

a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit has been released at
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php.

New features/texts:
- 6th Book of the Mahabharata complete
- Bigram search: The program automatically locates bigrams that contain a
given word and occur with a user-defined frequency. This feature is useful,
for example, to detect typical phrases or to study the semantic fields of
verbs (have a look at the Google research page at
http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html
for further inspiration). To access bigrams, ...
	- Search for a word in the dictionary or the query page, e.g. manu.
	- On the detail page of the word, click the link "n-grams" (6th line from
the top). The bigrams are displayed.
	- A detailed explanation can be found at
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=help_ngrams.
- The site contains a list that includes references to the secondary
literature found in the word meanings; refer to
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=help_xt_references.

Comments and ideas for improvement are highly welcome!

Best regards,

Oliver Hellwig
