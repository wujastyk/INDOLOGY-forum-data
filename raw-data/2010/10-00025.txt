Has anyone come across the bookseller and manuscript dealer Bhajan Lal, who
was active in Amritsar and Bharatpur in the 1920s-1940s?  He sold many
manuscripts through Banarsi Das, Lecturer in Hindi at Lahore Oriental
College (and colleague of Woolner), both to Lahore and to the Wellcome
Library in London.  Many MSS in these collections have his distinctive
dealers label stuck to their covers.

I would be interested to hear whether anyone else has come across this
Bhajan Lal.

Best, and thanks,
