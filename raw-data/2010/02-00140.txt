All of the speakers I'm familiar with who produce "f", produce it as a labiodental fricative (as in English). Many Nepali speakers don't produce "f" at all (but rather "ph"), but those who do again seem to produce it as a labiodental.

If it is the case that "ph" for some speakers is becoming a bilabial fricative, this would indeed be distinct from "hypercorrection".

(I'm not a linguist, so excuse any clumsiness:)

But, are these labiodental fricatives, like the English f, or bilabial (as, for instance, in Japanese)? I would suspect the bilabial version (which is what I have heard, I believe, in Northern India and Nepal), which is similar in articulation to a voiceless aspirated labial. In that case, rather than "hypercorrection," might this perhaps be due to a more general, systemic phonetic change (possibly stimulated by contact with Perso-Arabic speakers)? Or is this not a useful distinction?
