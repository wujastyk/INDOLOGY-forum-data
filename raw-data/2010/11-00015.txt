There is also something on the subject as applied to things such as what clothes are appropriate for rites for different purposes in Teun Goudriaan's Maya Divine and Human (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1978), which in turn is largely concerned with the texts assembled in Indrajalavidyasangraha < http://lccn.loc.gov/97903901 > (I think there are later printings of this collection than the 1915 LOC has microfiched.)
