Subject: Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?"
In-Reply-To: <8C03634A-E71A-42EE-BEC4-AFB97BE02C55@earthlink.net>
Message-ID: <161227088936.23782.6034555708936206290.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The whole discussion (here and in Tamil) reminded me of the little  
yellow  flower,  called 'noli me tangere' "don't touch me!" in Latin.

For some details see: <http://www.aboutflowers.org/ 
giantbalsamim_xal.htm>  (also in N. India)

(Leaves of certain trees also do that: they fold on touch).

Cheers,
MW
