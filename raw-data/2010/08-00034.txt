Dear Indologists,

     I recite the Ga?e?aa Atharva??r?a everyday since my childhood, but I had not previously thought about some of the lines in it:  gak?ra? p?rvar?pam / ak?ro madhyamar?pam / anusv?ra? c?ntyar?pam / bindur uttarar?pam / n?da? sandh?nam / sa?hit? sandhi? /.  While the anusv?ra is considered to be antya, the bindu is considered to be uttara.  Is there any (t?ntric?) explanation to split the anusv?ra and the bindu.  I always thought that bindu is simply a graphic representation for the anusv?ra, as is seen in some grammars of Skt:  upari???d bindur anusv?ra?.  How would one distinguish antya from uttara in these lines?  Any suggestions?
