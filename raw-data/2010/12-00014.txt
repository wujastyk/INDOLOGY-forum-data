In this issue you can read the paper Victims or Agents? An Issue of 
Identity Amongst Indian Migrant Women in Australia, by Loshini Naidoo 
(University of Western Sydney, Australia), and two paper interviews. The 
paper by Prof. Naidoo attempts to provide an understanding of the 
challenges that migrant woman, particularly women from the Indian 
sub-continent, face in cultural identity construction.

The interview paper is titled "An Islamic Feminist: Asya Andrabi and the 
Dukhtaraan-e-Millat in Kashmir by Francesca Marino (journalist, Director 
of Stringer Asia). It is based on an interview with Asya Andrabi, the 
founder and elusive leader of the militant female Islam group 
Dukhtaraan-e-Millat in Indian Kashmir.

The paper "Afghanistan, Issues at stake and Viable Solutions: An 
Interview with H.R.H. Princess India of Afghanistan" was written by 
myself. It is based on an interview with H.R.H. Princess India of 
Afghanistan, the honorary Cultural Ambassador of Afghanistan to Europe, 
approved in 2006 by President Hamid Karzai, and one of the founder 
members of Mahmud Tarzi Cultural Foundation (MTCF). It was made in 
January 2010.

The paper mostly deals with human rights issues and viable solutions for 
Afghanistan. It anticipates some of the alleged misconduct of US 
soldiers revealed over seven months later by Wikileaks.

Enjoy!
