Dear all,

a message of Robert Goldmann off list, has made me realize that I posted 
an error : Hayashi actually lists 10 to the power 52 and 10 to the power 
60 for mahaugha (note the transliteration mistake as well); but
it seems that different powers of ten can be given under this name 
according to the Ramayana recension considered.

sorry,

Agathe
