Broadly speaking, two sets of rituals are relevant to a discussion of  
initiations in Hindu and Buddhist traditions: initiatory rituals as part  of the 
life-cycle which are observed in many social groups and are  compulsory 
depending on gender or age, and those, more optional in  character, that allow 
admittance to a certain religious group or  practice. The contributors to this 
volume are from different academic  disciplines and treat examples of both kinds 
of rituals in various  religious settings. Of special interest in this 
collection of essays are  interrelationships among initiations and their 
relations to other kinds  of rituals. The papers are devoted to the study of 
minute details and  point to the dynamics of initiations. The transfer of ritual 
elements  accompanied by readjustments to new contexts as the modification of  
procedures or the reassignment of meanings is one of the recurring  traits. 
Other aspects addressed by the authors include the relation of  script (ritual 
handbooks) to performance or various forces of change  (e.g. the economics of 
ritual, gender-related variations, modernization  and democratization).
