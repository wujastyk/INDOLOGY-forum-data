In v.35 of Bhartr?hari?s N?ti?ataka (M.R. Kale?s Motilal edition) there are no elephants mentioned, but the ?stacking? of world-bearers (serpent, tortoise and ocean) is made rather explicit:

vahati bhuvana?re??? ?e?a? pha??phalakasthit??
kama?hapatin? madhyepr???ha? sad? sa ca dh?ryate |
tam api kurute kro??dh?na? payodhir an?dar?d

Continuing with references to the earth being supporting by a single
tortoise:  In the bhuvanakoza section (verse 31) of the
SiddhAntasundara (ca. 1500 CE), JJAnarAja presents the following
argument for the earth having support:

   dhRtavaktrasarIsRpo 'pi gRdhraH
   praharaM tiSThati khe 'lpavIrya evam /
   gagane na kathaM sa kUrmarUpaH
   pratikalpaM dhRtabhUr acintyazaktiH //

"A vulture, which has only little strength, rests in the sky holding a
snake in its beak for a prahara.  Why can [the deity] in the form of a
tortoise, who possesses an inconceivable potency, not hold the Earth
in the sky for a kalpa?"

More references to the earth resting on a tortoise is found in verses
63 and 78 of the same section.

Best,
Toke
