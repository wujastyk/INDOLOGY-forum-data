Dear Indologists,

I wonder if someone could clarify for me the nuances between the  
meaning of moksa and nirvana? Do both imply release from samsara?  It  
seems as if a belief in soul/no soul has to determine the meaning and  
I know the meanings change over the centuries.... but some quick  
insights would be very welcome.

Apologies for such a broad question.

Thanks so much for your thoughts!

Mary
