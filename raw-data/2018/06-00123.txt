Subject: [INDOLOGY] Unreadable Colophon
Message-ID: <724078c1070b4f8c872d9ca9d2d0ddc0@xmail201.UGent.be>

Dear Indology members,

I am trying to decipher a colophon of a Jain manuscript of Hari?ena?s Dhammaparikkh?, but I have trouble in reading some parts of it.
Could anyone help me with the lines that I have marked? (picture below)
The colophon starts with giving the date (sa?vat 1595 var?e pau?adha m?se ?ukla pak?e ? tithau vu(?) ma?galav?re), but after that I cannot figure out what it says.
I suspect it is about a place and about a ruler of that time.

This obtained this manuscript from Kobatirth, where they told me it is a manuscript from Bhanka. Does anyone know how the manuscripts from Bhanka ended up in Kobatirth, and what the original bhandar was?

Many thanks!
