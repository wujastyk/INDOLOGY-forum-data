Here are my Krishna verses this morning:

??????????????? ??????? ?? ???????? ?

????????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ??

Mandara tree for the people offering obeisance to you, O Mukunda, by
offering my obeisance to you, I attain a wonderful abode of infinite joy.


?????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ?

???????? ?? ????????? ???????? ????? ???? ??

Though uninvited, O Govinda, you are a great thief who every moment opens
the door to my mind and enters without fear.


?????????? ????? ????? ???????? ??? ?? ?

???????????? ????????? ????????? ????? ???? ??

No one allows you not stops you. Unseen while arriving, how did you enter
my heart?


?????? ????? ????????????? ?? ????? ???? ?

????????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ??

O M?dhava, the thief is hidden in my heart. Where shall I find him? Even
though expelled from the heart, he refuses to leave.


???? ????? ??????? ?? ?? ??????? ????????? ?

???????? ???? ???? ??, ????????? ????? ???? ??

Or, just stay where you are, and don't go anywhere else. You have robbed me
of everything, now don't rob anyone else.


?????? ???????? ???? ???????? ????? ??? ?

???????????????? ???: ?????? ? ?? ?????? ??

Whatever you robbed of me, I just give it to you. Yet you want more. There
is nothing left with me.


????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ????? ?

????? ?? ????????? ????????????????? ??

This great thief, Kr???a, is hidden in my mind, and the same Kr???a stands
guarding at the gate of my mind.


????? ????? ???????????? ????? ?????? ?????? ?

??? ???????? ???????????????? ????? ???? ??

Whatever was given by you, you took away, and nothing belongs to me.
Knowing this, I feel free and take refuge at your feet.


???? ???? ??????? ?? ?????????? ????????: ?

???????????? ??????? ????? ??? ????? ?????? ??

O M?dhava, you are such a great thief, that even the robbed praise you.
Those who are not [yet] robbed beg you: ?Rob me, rob me.?


???????????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ???? ?

??? ????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??? ????????? ??

What a strange thief you are that you steal your own belongings. If all
that exists is yours, what is the point of stealing?
