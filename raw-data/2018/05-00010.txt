Continuing with Krishna verses. [Just can't seem to stop]

????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ??????????: ?
????????????????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ??
O Govinda, let the evil logicians debate whether you exist or do not exist.
What is the purpose with logic for those who know the nectar of your
sweetness?

??????? ??? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ?
???????? ??? ???????? ?????????????? ???: ??
[O Logician,] if your inference is that God does exist, they your fault is
that you have proven what is already established. If your inference is that
God does not exist, how can you disprove what is already established?

??? ?????????: ????? ?????????? ???????: ?
????? ??? ???????: ??? ???? ?????? ??????? ??
If the sound of the flute [of Kr???a] reaches your ears, what is the point
of exertion in logic? If Govinda is in your heart, what would you gain with
logic?

??????? ??? ??????????????????????? ?
?????? ??????? ?? ????? ???????????? ???? ??
How can logic steal away the Stealer of Yoghurt [= Kr???a] from the banks
of Yamun?? How can logic free him from the good bonds of [his mother]
Ya?od??

??????? ????? ??? ? ?????? ? ?????????? ?
?? ??????? ???? ?????? ???????: ??
The killer of [the demoness] P?tan? is not scared of the logician. The
Pacifier of [the demon] Madhu is capable of pacifying your logic.

?? ?? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ??? ?????? ?
???????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ??
O you Logician, you are so dumb. Why are you running away from Govinda?
While you are trying to prove his non-existence, he will offer you success.

?? ?? ??????? ?? ????????? ???? ??????? ?
???? ???????????????????? ?? ?????????? ??
O Logician, don?t be scared. Just once visit Gokula. The Great Thief over
there will steal away your logic.

???????? ??? ????? ???? ?? ?????????? ?????? ?
??????? ?????? ??? ???????? ????????????????? ??
The one you are trying to prove to be non-existent, you can observe him in
Gokula. How can your logic be stronger than your direct vision.

??? ????????????????? ???? ? ????????? ?
????????? ????: ???????? ????? ??????? ??????? ??
Due to your strong pride in logic, if you are not inclined to go [to
Gokula], the kind-hearted M?dhava himself will grant you a vision with love.

????????? ????????????????? ?? ???????? ?
?????????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????? ??
Like a person with eyes who acts like a blind, like a person with ears who
acts like a deaf, and a person, though touching, does not feel the touch, O
Logician, you are out of luck.

???? ???? ???? ???????? ?????? ??????????? ?
????????? ???????????????? ????? ??????? ????: ??
Go wherever you wish trying to prove whatever you want. M?dhava will go on
his own to free you from the snake of logic.

?????????????????? ???????? ??????? ???: ?
??????? ??????????? ???? ?????? ???: ??
The mind of the learned people deeply infused with the poison of logic
regains life by singing the songs of Govinda.

?????????????????? ???????? ???? ?? ??? ?
????????: ???????????? ?????? ????????????: ??
O friend, do not place your trust in unfounded logic. The Cosmic Lord,
having assumed the form of a child, is well-established in Gokula.

? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ???? ?????????: ?
???????????? ?? ?????? ??????????????? ???? ??
Even if you were a good logician, your logic does not save you. What then
to speak of a bad logician? How can bad logic save him?

?????? ??????? ???????? ????? ?????????? ?
??? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ??
Set aside your logic, O Logician. Let your logic entertain your mind. [But]
board the boat of Kr???a, and save yourself from the delusion of your mind.

???? ?????? ???? ?? ???: ????? ??? ?
????????? ?? ?????????? ???? ??????? ??
In reference to Lord Kr???a who is beyond [logic], your mind should not be
lead by logic. Let Kr???a remove the darkness of delusion that has settled
in your eye.
