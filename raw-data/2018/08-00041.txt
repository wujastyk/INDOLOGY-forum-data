Dear Artur,


The term "hyperglossia," as introduced by Pollock in his

The Language of the Gods in the World of Men,

refers to this phenomenon, though I am not sure how widespread this usage is. Pollock seems to have treated it as a neologism.


If I understand just what you are talking about, James Strachey's translations of Freud -- e.g. his rendering of "das Ich" as "the ego" -- may serve as a modern example. You may therefore find other terms for what you are looking for by digging into the critical literature on Strachey's translations.


good luck,

Matthew
