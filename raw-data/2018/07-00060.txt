Continuing my Krishna verses:

???????? ?? ???????????????? ???? ???? ?
?????? ?????????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ???????
Of those thousands of wives, there are children from house to house, and, O
Krishna, they lovingly call you ?Daddy!?.

?????????? ??????????: ????????????????: ?
???????? ???????????? ?????????????????: ???????
Some children are crying, others busy running around, and some, climbing
upon your head like monkeys, are overjoyed.

????????????? ?? ?????? ????????????? ??? ?
????????? ?????? ???? ??????? ??????? ????????? ???????
Someone pulls your hair, another one holds on to your hands, another clings
to your feet, while someone closes your eyes.

???????? ?? ??????? ????? ??????? ???? ?
????? ???? ??????????: ??????? ?????? ??? ???????
There is a massive chaos in your home of all these children of yours. Yet,
with a calm mind, you lovingly care for them all.
