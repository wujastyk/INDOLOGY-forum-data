Subject: [INDOLOGY] Confession of ignorance and request for your kind advice

Dear Colleagues

I have been working for a while on a short text variously ascribed to
differently named authors, a text called Pra?nottararatnam?lik? / ?m?l?.
Several of the manuscripts I was able to obtain have interlinear
commentaries (well, I understand them to be commentaries), but I cannot
read them. I can live with that, but I'd at least like to know what
language they are in.
One of them is in Harvard, and the catalogue information for this
manuscript contains the following:

Interlinear commentary throughout the manuscript might be in old Hindi or
Prakrit but Poleman has identified it as Gujarathi. The beginning and the
end of the commentary is as follows, on [[facs=f1r, locus=f. 1r]]
s?ri?gautama?ya namah? namaskari? kevali? tan?atu sva?mi? ti?rtham?kara
pras?nottararatnama?la?prakaran?a bolisu . da?navamanus?ya
devata?vam?dani?ka pu?jya tatha? deva ma?hi s?ri? maha?vi?ra and on
[[facs=f4v, locus=f. 4v]] 28 ni?paja?vi? s?veta?m?bara a?ca?rye i?m? vimala
i?saim? na?mi i?m? u?jhali? pras?nottararatnama?la? kam?t?hirahi hum?ti?
purus?a pratina tralakari?m? api tu alam?kari? i?m? 29 .


Another MS contains, for instance, near the beginning the following (I
don't know how to split the words so I just transcribe as scripta continua
as well as I can read it):
tehani?nam?ni? pra?nottaratnam?l? n?ma prakara?a kahispu?

Any advice would be appreciated, and with excuses in advance for my utter
ignorance.

Jonathan
