Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brackets in modern sanskrit translations

Birgit's point is one I have mulled over for several years now. To
"translate" is to bring something from one language (place, context) into
another. And, yes, that may require quite a lot of interpreting,
"paraphrasing," etc. It is a unique art.

But, underlying this is that, at least in my case (and I suspect this is
true for many of us on this list), I was never trained in the art of
translation. Language and linguistics, even history...yes, but not
translation per se. When I "translate," I try to capture the original in my
"translation," but is that "translating,"? Or, just an attempt to represent
my historical-linguistic inquiries?

An interesting (and fun) read that looks at some of these issues is
O'Flaherty's (Doniger's) essay, "On Translating Sanskrit Myths" in Radice
and Reynolds, The Translator's art: essays in honour of Betty Radice.
Harmondsworth: Penguin. 1987.
