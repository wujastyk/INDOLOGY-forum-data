Subject: [INDOLOGY] logical fallacies
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrB675_V2VdZEnmVbYcYfYSAWvp-pgYsKgnKMupY4-kHWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Does anyone have a list of Sanskrit terms for logical fallacies and their
equivalent in English and/or Latin?

Something like this, for example:
vyakti prati yukti argumentum ad hominem

thank you.

All the best,
