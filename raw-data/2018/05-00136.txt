Concluding (?) verses of my Krishna poem:

???????? ?? ????????? ????? ???????? ???? ?
???????????: ????? ????????? ??? ???? ???????
O Kr???a, we have been happily placed on the stage of your world. You, O
Kr???a, are blissful, and we are your particles on the earth.

???? ????? ??????????? ??? ? ?????????????? ?
??????? ?????? ????????? ???? ?? ?????? ???????
O Lord, it is all your planning as to where you have placed me, how you
have placed me, and the task in which you have engaged me.

???????? ? ?????? ? ???? ?? ?????? ?
???? ???????????????? ?????? ???? ????????????
I do not understand the purpose, nor your plan. All I know is that
propelled into this world I am an instrument of yours.

??? ?????? ?? ????? ????????? ?? ???? ?
???? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ????: ???????
O Kr???a, though the hands are mine, you are the doer, and though my feet
move, you are their mover.

??? ????? ??????? ???????????? ?? ?
? ?? ?????? ??????? ???? ??????????: ???????
Let my mind wander from object to object. I have no worry, O Lord, since
you are the driver of the chariot of my mind.

????????????????? ????????? ????????? ?
????? ??????? ???? ???? ????????? ???? ???????
The wheels of the world turn just by a tiny portion of your compassion. So
if the chariot of my life moves ahead, what is so surprising?

???????????????????? ?????????? ?????? ?
???? ?? ??????? ?? ??????? ????????? ???????
Just by a glance of yours, O Lord, the lotus of my mind blooms. Let it
never close up.

????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ?
?????? ???????, ??????? ???? ?? ??? ???????
The gate of my mind is open and for a long time I am waiting for you. Come
quickly. O Friend, do not delay.

????? ?? ????????? ??????? ?? ??????? ?
????? ????? ????????? ????? ?????? ?????? ???????
O Lord, many of my lives have gone by and so also of yours. O Kr???a, life
after life, I was your friend.

??? ???? ?? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ?
??? ?????? ???????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???????
O M?dhava, your friend is waiting for your in the yard. O Lord, as you did
before, do your play today.

???????? ?? ???????? ???????? ??? ?? ?
????????????????? ????? ????? ??? ???????
O Kr???a, this is your stage, and I am M?dhava, your friend. Let our happy
and blissful game go on for ever.

??? ?????????????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? [?????????]

Thus ends the M?dhava?s Nectar for the Ears, in three hundred verses,
composed by Madhav Deshpande.
