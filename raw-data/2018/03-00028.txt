Dear David,
the worst came after : the personal library and all the archives of LVP were given, through Etienne Lamotte, to the University of Louvain, and everything was lost in the second burning of the University library in 1940!
Best wishes,
Christophe

Glad that you clarified the sense of the French word "sortit" as meaning that an English translation "was produced," not published. Pruden had translated this phrase as saying that their collaboration "led to the appearance of an English version . . . ," which normally means that it had been published, and I followed him in this understanding. Thanks to your explanation, I now know why I could never find where it was published: it was not published.

LVP rather says only that an English translation was produced; if it had been published, I think he would have spoken differently, and the item would have been recorded in Lalou?s almost complete bibliography of LVP) ? for me (but I may be wrong) it must have been a kind of ?working paper? made by LVP together with Ridding and Thomas during the time he was in Cambridge (viz. during the whole first world war), that he later used for preparing his 1925 publication, like the preliminary (French) translation he says he made in 1913-1914 of the 5th chapter : the latter is said (in the same ?) to have been partly printed by J. Istas - I do not see to what LVP refers according to his 1913-1925 bibliography (in the following work - https://archive.org/stream/pts_bouddhismetude_3720-0699#page/n135/mode/2up <https://archive.org/stream/pts_bouddhismetude_3720-0699#page/n135/mode/2up> - printed by Istas in 1913, I only find a portion of AK ch. 3; the whole ch. 3 having been published in Bouddhisme. ?tudes et mat?riaux. Cosmologie?, printed in 1913-14 for the Royal Academy of Belgium but published only later, in London, in 1919, because of the war) - however, an explanation can be found in the intr. to the first vol. of the AK (1923, https://archive.org/stream/labhidharmakosat01vasuuoft#page/n7/mode/2up <https://archive.org/stream/labhidharmakosat01vasuuoft#page/n7/mode/2up> ) where LVP refers to the ?chapter 5 of which the translation was burned in Louvain? (the university library was destroyed together with printing offices attached to it, like J.B. Istas? one, in 1914): so we can imagine that his 1913-14 translation of the 5th chapter was in course of publication by Istas, and that proofs were printed for a part before being lost (LVP keeping his typescript).

>> Louis de La Vall?e Poussin, on the first page of his Avant-propos to Tome IV of his French translation of the Abhidharmako?a, refers to an English translation of chapter 6 that he made in collaboration with Miss Ridding and E. J. Thomas. Because of this collaboration, he says, the English equivalents were very carefully researched. I have never been able to find where this English translation of this chapter was published. Neither Leo Pruden nor Lodro Sangpo give a bibliographic reference to it in their English translations of Poussin's entire French translation. Can someone point me to it? Thanks.
