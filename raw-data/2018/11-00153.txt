Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help to convert dates
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzfqjzHwq_yjTi6Qj_U3Lh4mek3QGnA3MaMcv7KzcZDTqg@mail.gmail.com>

I have been going over our family history where numerous dates are given in
Shaka era like "Shake 1839, Kartik Krishna 13."  Is there some online tool
to easily convert these dates to A.D.?  Any help will be greatly
appreciated.  With best wishes,
