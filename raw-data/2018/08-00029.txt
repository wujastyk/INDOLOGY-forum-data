Abhyankar's dictionary of Sanskrit grammar on the word
*pratinirdi?yam?na *quotes
the following line from Kaiya?a's Mah?bh??ya-Prad?pa, without giving a
reference as to where this line occurs.  Is there a searchable text of
Prad?pa available online?  Otherwise, if anyone has come across this quote
from Kaiya?a, please let me know where it occurs.  Best,
