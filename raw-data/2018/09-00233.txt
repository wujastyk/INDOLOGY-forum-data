Dear James,

I am almost sure that this term is not used in the early Veda (up to
Brahmanas and early Upanisads). However the concept of "burning substance"
which, to some extent, coulc be seen as on of the roots of the later yogic
experience can be found. It is the influence of Soma which - as it seems
from the Rgvedic material - gave the strong experience of heat to its
drinker. And Soma itself was conceived as "burning substance", or rather
"burning fluid". If you need more references, you are most welcomed to
write to me directly.

Regards,

Joanna
