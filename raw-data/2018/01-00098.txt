Could a colleague who can access the St. Peterburgische Zeitung of 1833 
let me know in which month or months Nos. 219?223 were published?  I am 
facing three versions of the same basic document, in German, French, and 
English, all dated 1833, but with evidence of successive redaction.  
Divergences on one crucial point make it important to ascertain the 
order in which they were redacted.

I would be most grateful,
Rosane Rocher
