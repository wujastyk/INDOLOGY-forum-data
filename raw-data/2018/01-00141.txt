Dear Arlo,

many thanks for this.

I gave it a quick look and it does not appear to have any information
directly relevant to the supposed s?m?/uposathag?ra which the Mah? Bodhi
Society should have had established within the premises of the
M?lagandhakutivih?ra, from what I understand. The vih?ra was and is under
the administration of Sri Lankan monks of the Siam Nik?ya (I do not know
which sub-chapter as of now). 

Upinder Singh?s The Idea of Ancient India: Essays on Religion, Politics, and
Archaeology might also have relevant information, and I am waiting for a
copy to reach our library.

Other publications concerned with Anag?rika Dharmap?la inheritance (broadly
understood) do not seem to include such details, but I haven?t checked the
recent The Lion?s Roar, Anagarika Dharmapala and the Making of Modern
Buddhism by Sarath Amunugama (Vijitha Yapa Publications, Sri Lanka, 2016).

Based on eye-witness accounts, there appears to have been an unfinished
uposathag?ra/s?m? in the early seventies and an actual uposathag?ra/s?m? in
existence in the nineties, but the details of the construction are not known
to me.

I hope the archive of the Maha Bodhi Society might have some relevant
document, but have not been able to receive a response from them so far.

Many thanks again and best wishes,

Dhammadinn?

Dear Dhammadinna,

 

Could this be relevant?

 

Singh, Upinder. 2010. ?Exile and Return: The Reinvention of Buddhism and
Buddhist Sites in Modern India.? South Asian Studies 26 (2):193?217.
https://doi.org/10.1080/02666030.2010.514744.

 

I am trying to attach the pdf (2.8 MB), hope it comes through.

 

Best wishes,

 

Arlo Griffiths

Dear Friends and Colleagues, 

does anyone have access to archival information or secondary sources on the
history of the establishment, inauguration and historical use of the
uposathagara/sima of the Sarnath centre of the Maha Bodhi Society?

Images (including contemporary) would also be most welcome.

With thanks in advance and all best wishes,

Dhammadinna
