Dear Sravana,

I do not think that there is any Indian (Sanskrit) text with this title available to us.

'K?mr? b?j?k?a' is a title reconstructed by Carl Ernst from the Persian translation of this text. See his paper:

'Being Careful with the Goddess: Yoginis in Persian and Arabic Texts'
in Pallabi Chakravorty and Scott Kugle (eds.), Performing Ecstasy: The Poetics and Politics of Religion in India, New Delhi: Manohar, 2009, pp. 189?203.

Kazuyo Sakaki disputed this reconstruction and she offered different reading of the Persian title: K?mar?papa?c??ik?. See her paper:
'Yogico-tantric Traditions in the ?awd al-?ay?t', Journal of the Japanese Association for South Asian Studies, 17 (2005): 135?156 (p. 138).

Best,
Lubomir
