Happy to have completed 500 Krishna verses, and continuing:
??????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ??? ??????????? ?????? ? ?? ??????? ?? ????? ???????O Krishna, I see your footprints in all directions.  I know that you are near, and yet I do not see your face.
??????? ??????????? ?? ????? ??????? ?????? ???????: ?????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??? ???????In the soft words of children, O Krishna, there is your voice.  In the dance of the youth with young ladies is your own dance, O Krishna.
???????? ?????????? ?????? ???????: ???????????????? ????? ?? ?????? ???????In the bowers in the woods, the tweeting of birds is the sound of your flute.  In the running of the deer in the forest is your own play.
???????? ? ???????? ??? ?? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ?????? ??????? ???????In the feathers of peacocks, O Krishna, is your head-ornament.  O Lord, there is a reflection of yours in the eyes of the she-deer.
?????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ???????? ????? ???? ???? ???????The blue color of the sky is a sign of your body, and how could there be darkness in the clouds without you?
