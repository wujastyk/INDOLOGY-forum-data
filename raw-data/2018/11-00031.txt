Dear Palaniappan and all,

just to be sure, the Russian ?transliteration? is really hilarious. Unlike the Hindi one, it is not phonetic but simply renders individual letters and that in a very funny way too. ??? for ?y? at the end made me wonder first if it was Mongolian or smth.

best,
Andrey

Maybe the makers of the sign simply assumed that other languages did the same thing?

How British.

The terrible rendering in Tamil became widely ridiculed on the Web. Some wondered if it was a photoshopped joke. But?BBC Tamil?has confirmed that it is true and shows a picture with attempted erasure of the Tamil version after the problem was brought to the attention of the authorities. The designer of the plaque was Larsen & Toubro. Can other language experts comment on the other versions on the plaque?
