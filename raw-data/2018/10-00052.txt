Dear Walter,
Indeed a remarkable piece of evidence!
But it does not clinch the issue as the scene must have been not just
pre-?rauta but faaar pre-Rgvedic (as the continuity of ?rauta ritual, and
late and early Rgvedic ritual, in some crucial respects even pre-Rgvedic
Indo-Iranian ritual, is well-known: cp. Hillebrandt 1897: 11 ).
And if the last line suggests a contemporary exclamation I would expect,
instead of su-astaye: pra-astaye > pr?staye (cp. L. and G. Prosit !)
