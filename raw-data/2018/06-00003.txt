Dear Friends,

June 1 was the beginning of my retirement from the University of Michigan.
I have been informed by my department that from now on my status as
"Professor Emeritus" has been officially approved by the University of
Michigan. I just returned to San Francisco from a week in London, and
during the 11 hour flight I composed 35 new Krishna verses. Will put them
up once I get to translating them.

Madhav Deshpande
