Message-ID: <CAPW7aQHzzJ3_9u9Zi=kKMhY709WKPv+N-4GuRfJJz702WYEQQw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

If anyone knows  the links to online books of stotras, such as
Brihat-stotra-ratnakar, stotra-ratnavali, Brihat-stotra-ratnakar etc. etc.
(or has pdf's of these books or similar books) I'd greatly appreciate
receiving the links or the pdfs.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
