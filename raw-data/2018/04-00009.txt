Dear Matthew,

Thanks. It?s certainly possible that the author of my source misunderstood the opinion he paraphrases and took ?cart-shaped? to refer to the entire earth, whereas only a portion of the earth was intended.

In Hindu cosmography, Jambudv?pa refers to a circular continent surrounded by annular oceans and continents. Since the author rejects that the earth is cart-shaped, it?s possibly a refutation of a Buddhist idea.

The triangular or trapezoidal shape in the Buddhist sources you refer to agrees with the drawing in the ?ilpa-prak??a manuscript. I?m not sure where Bose got ?quadrangular, with a long triangular projection on one side? from.

This begs the question, of course, of whether carts in ancient India were generally trapezoidal-shaped?

Best wishes,
Toke

I?m trying to understand (1) what precisely is understood by ?cart-shaped? (?aka??k?ra or ?aka??k?ti) and (2) how the earth can have the shape of a cart.

One such shape is ?aka??k?ti (verse 1.39), which is translated as ?a tapering bullock-cart (?aka??k?ti ku?cita).? The book contains facsimiles of the palm leaf pages of a manuscript, which includes drawings to illustrate the building-site shapes (plate I). The drawing of the cart-shaped building site doesn?t look like what Bose describes (see above), but rather looks like an isosceles trapezoid.
