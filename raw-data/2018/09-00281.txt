 Good to know!

*Full Time Assistant Professor of Pre-Modern Indian Ocean Studies*

The Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University invites
applications for a tenure-track position of Assistant Professor in
Pre-Modern Indian Ocean Studies *to commence on September 1, 2019.*


We seek a scholar of pre-modern Indian Ocean history, culture, politics,
and economy, with a primary interest in the exchange of ideas, texts,
cultural objects, commodities and trade patterns, and the intermigration of
communities. We are particularly interested in an interdisciplinary scholar
whose teaching and research focuses on conceiving new ways of thinking
about circulation, mobility, and the migration of peoples and ideas within
a transregional context.

The Indian Ocean, in the pre-modern, constituted a critical central link
between ?local? and broader regional and transregional constellations of
culture and society, economy and politics that encompassed the Gulf region,
Persia, East Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. These linkages
manifested themselves in the circulations of religion, trade, ideas,
language, literature, labor, and the workings of empire and territory. The
potential candidate should be able to cover two or more of these
geographical areas, with a strong scholarly interest in the theories of
trans-cultural exchanges, migration and the creation of economies,
polities, geographies and boundaries, within the broader Indian Ocean area.


The teaching load for this position is four courses per year. In addition,
the position involves serving as an adviser for 20-25 students.

Founded in 1972, NYU Gallatin is a liberal arts college of 1,500
undergraduate students and 200 graduate students that are part of New York
University. Its innovative B.A. and M.A. programs in individualized study
encourage students to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary program of
study that combines courses taken in the various schools of NYU with
independent studies, internships, and Gallatin?s own interdisciplinary
seminars, writing courses and arts workshops. The School emphasizes
excellent teaching, top level faculty research, intensive student advising
and mentoring, and a unique combination of program flexibility and academic
rigor. To learn more about the Gallatin School, please visit our website at

*Qualifications:* Ph.D. in hand by time of appointment; demonstrated
excellence in teaching at the college or university level; and a strong
record of research and writing. All application materials must be submitted
electronically. *To apply, please visit:https://apply.interfolio.com/51764
<https://apply.interfolio.com/51764>*

description of three dream courses (250 words), and three letters of
reference.


*Review of applications will begin on October 22, 2018 and will continue
until the position is filled. For questions, please contact Gallatin Human
