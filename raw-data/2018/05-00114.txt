Continuing with my Krishna verses:

??? ?? ??????: ????? ?????? ??????? ?? ?

??????????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ?? ???????

O Kr???a, if your sweet names fall on my ears, then having received that
nectar for the ears, what else needs to be heard?


???? ??? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ?? ?

??????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???????

If Kr???a resides in my eyesight, then let anything else be in front of me.
Having received the nectar of sight, what else needs to be seen?


???? ???? ????????? ?? ???? ??????? ?

??????????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????? ?? ???????

O M?dhava, If I receive the touch of your hand filled with nectar, then
having received the nectar of touch, what else needs to be touched?


??????? ????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ?? ?

?????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?? ???????

The delight of your name exceeds all other delights.  Having received the
delight of Kr???a, what else needs to be tasted?


????? ?? ????? ???? ????????? ?? ??????: ?

??????????? ?????????? ?????? ???????? ?? ???????

O Kr???a, your sweet words resound in my ears.  Having heard the nectar of
the Bhagavad-Gita, what remains to be asked?


????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ?

??????????? ????????? ????? ????? ???????? ???????

If your figure is in my heart and around me your blue color, then with you
near me, what else do I need to meditate upon.


?????? ?? ???? ?????????? ???????????? ?

?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ???????

If you always reside in my heart, then, tell me O Kr???a, what else am I
supposed to think of?


????????: ???? ?? ?????????? ??? ?

???????? ?? ??: ??????????? ???????? ???????

If the Kr???a swan always roams in my lake, then where else shall my mind,
transfixed on it, go?


??? ??????? ????????? ????????????? ????????: ?

????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ???????

?May I have this, and may I have that, and may I have it all,? thus I used
to desire.  But having achieved your friendship, I do not desire anything
else.


??????: ????? ?????????????????? ??????? ?

????: ????? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ???????

O Kr???a, there is nothing else beyond you.  My only desire is that you
should not be beyond me.


????? ????? ?? ?????? ?? ???????? ????????? ?

?? ??? ??? ????????? ???? ???? ????? ???????

Le my mind, resting in you, not run anywhere else.  O M?dhava, Don?t you
ever abandon me and run somewhere else.
