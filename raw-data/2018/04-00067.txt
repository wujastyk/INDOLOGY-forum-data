As Christophe Vielle pointed out to me in a personal mail, also the Malayalam word deriving from Sanskrit camatk?ra has this meaning.

In fact, it is still to be written? I have taken interest in camatk?ra (and other crucial concepts) in the course of my ongoing research on aesthetic speculation as the basis of Utpala-Abhinava?s philosophical-religious thought (not viceversa). Two articles on this more general topic are forthcoming. Yes, ?philological' investigation, provided that we take ?philology? in its highest meaning of historical-hermeneutic-linguistic discipline dealing with ?texts? (in this regard, you might see my JAOS article of few years ago).

The suddenness and lack of its previous awareness (at a 'conscious' level ) leads to a surprise in the experiencing individual. Part of the ecstatic tingling or tingling ecstasy is characterised by this flash  and surprise aspect.

In fact, this would have been my second question: why practically in all modern Indic languages the words related to camatk?ra mean ?wonder, surprise, astonishment?, while it is not so with the Trika authors who introduced this word into philosophical-aesthetic terminology. Contrary to the communis opinio, I am convinced that the meaning of camatk?ra in all Utpaladeva-Abhinavagupta-K?emar?ja?s works has nothing (or at least very little) to do with ?wonder?.
