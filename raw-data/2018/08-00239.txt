Jhakgirish at yahoo.com? but a few years later it was replaced by myCurrent email Id i.e. jhakgirish at gmail.com??and it was duly informed to the Indology Committee.I reauest you kindly to look into the matter and rectify the error,if any.If it need not undergo any rectification,please inform.Kindest regards,Awaiting your reply,SincerelyGirish K.JhaRetd Univ.
