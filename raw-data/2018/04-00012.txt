I have a longer (42 pp.) article entitled "On ancient Indian ox-carts,
biers, beds and thrones: ? propos of Sanskrit ?aka??- / ?aka?a- and its
etymology" forthcoming shortly in: Indology's pulse: Arts in context (Doris
M. Srinivasan Festschrift), edited by Corinna Wessels-Mevissen and Gerd J.
R. Mevissen, New Delhi: Aryan Books International. There I discuss in
detail the contexts in which the word ?aka?a- occurs in Vedic and epic (and
selectively other Sanskrit)  literature. The following extract concerns the
?ulvas?tras:

Context XV: Carts and the shapes of brickbuilt

fire altars (citi). The K?ty?yana-?ulvas?tra

mentions a citi shaped like the triangular-shaped

?mouth? of a cart (1,18 ?aka?amukhasya caivam).

This is synonymous with the prau?ga-citis used in

rites of sorcery which are described in ?pastamba-?ulvas?tra

(12,4 prau?ga? cinv?ta bhr?t?vyav?n iti

vij??yate ...), cf. the commentaries of Kapardisv?min

(ed. Srinivasachar & Narasimhachar 1931: 202):

prau?ga? ?aka?ap?rvabh?ga?, and Sundarar?ja (ibid.:

205): prau?ga? ?aka?asya mukha? triko?a? tadvac

c?yata iti prau?gacit. In addition, the ?pastamba-?ulvas?tra

also describes a rhombus-shaped twofaced

prau?ga-citi for annihilating existing enemies

and those yet to be born (12,7 ubhayata?prau?ga?

cinv?ta ya? k?mayeta praj?t?n bhr?t?vy?n nudeya

pratijani?yam???n iti vij??yate): it looks like two

carts/fore-parts of carts (joined together), with

their fronts facing different directions (12,8 yath?

vimukhe ?aka?e), cf. the commentaries of Karavinda

(ibid.: 208): vimukhe n?n?mukhe ?aka?e yath? p???he

sa?hite ti??hete t?d?g?k?r?m ubhayatra prau?ga?

tath? cinv?tety artha?, and Sundarar?ja (ibid.: 209):

vimukhe viparyastamukhe pr?kpa?c?nmukhe yath?

?aka?abh?ge t?d?g e?o ?gnir bhavati.
