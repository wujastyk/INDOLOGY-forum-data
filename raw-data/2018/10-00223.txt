Subject: [INDOLOGY] Dating of the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad
In-Reply-To: <92ADE613-CF55-4903-B90A-ED7A7CE6EA86@smu.edu>

Since I am not at present in a position to consult recent literature on the date of the B?had?ra?yaka Upani?ad, I may superfluously draw attention to the discussion of the date of the Y?j?avalkya-K???a of that Upani?ad in my Greater Magadha (Brill 2007; Motilal Banarsidass 2013). I there present arguments to think that the grammarian "K?ty?yana knew this text [the YK] as an independent, recently composed work, as did Pata?jali some time after him". The creation of the B?had?ra?yaka Upani?ad as a whole, by bringing its three portions together, might have taken place a number of generations after Pata?jali. Pata?jali can be dated to the second half of the second century BCE.

You can find some of my writings on the Upani?ads on academia.edu<http://academia.edu/> (https://smu.academia.edu/StevenLindquist), though I haven?t dealt specifically with the dating of the B?had.

My best,

Steven

there is a mention of Steven Lindquist's "lines of descent and dissent" published in "religions of south asia" 5. it is available in equinox website for a price.  Brian Black's "Rethinking the Upanishadic Vamshas" is also published in the same thing. I would be glad to read both. I hope you will help me.

Dear sir, very much thanks.
I am afraid that I may not be able to soon (in a week, that is my time for it now) anywhere in India. Pl. Help me get the scanned images of these chapters if possible.

Dear Colleagues,

I would suggest consulting Signe Cohen?s edited volume (Routledge 2018) titled *The Upanisads: A Complete Guide*.  Chapters 2-4, all by Cohen, and Chapter 23, by Dermot Killingley, are particularly pertinent to this matter.
