My Sanskrit verse today:

???????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???
???????: ??????????????????? ????????????? ?????? ?
?????????????????????????? ????????? ??????
????? ??????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ??

Playing on the banks of K?lind?, the drops of sweat on his forehead
produced by his exertion shine like pearls. The world itself shines by the
scattering light of his infinite virtues. May this love of Gokula
constantly shine in my mind.
