Greetings, I am not sure if my last reply was posted or not. Just in case
it wasn't, here are a few points in reply to previous questions. Best,
Matthew Clark.

Greetings all, thanks for the responses. Addressing some of the points
raised:

1. There are references in the RV (see my book) to "soma of the valleys,
soma of the hills, soma of the rivers", etc., i.e. many somas. This is
echoed not only in the Avesta but also in the materia medica of India. Soma
was not one plant, it was many plants.

2. I think that the strongest argument against fly agaric is recent
psychedelic history. Who eats or drinks fly-agaric in the West (or
anywhere, apart from Siberia, corners of Afghanistan, and by the Objiway of
North America)? Very few people do so (there are a few enthusiasts, of
course: see my book). Many years ago I tried eating fly agaric: it was
quite destabilizing. In over 40 years of global observation I have never
come across a fly-agaric "movement". In contrast, as I mentioned, consider
the enthusiasm for the classic tryptamines. This is not a "knock-out"
argument, just a consideration of the weight of probabilities.

3. In soma rites, the concoction is usually consumed three times in a day.

4. The sound of vigorous pounding is amplified in the sound holes under the
planks.

5. The soma rasa of the Vedas later becomes an internal amrita in yoga
texts and elsewhere.

6. Although psychedelic plants are consumed occasionally in some tribal
cultures of South Asia, I am not aware of any living psychedelic "cult" as
such (any information on this point would be greatly appreciated). In my
book I mention the living ayahuasca analogue cult run by Qalandar in Iran.

More soon, no doubt. Matthew Clark.
