Dr.Rosati.,
&nbsp; The Chandelas ruled during the 11th century in the Central part of India.The iconic temple architecures of Khajuraho are credited to them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;



There are interesting literatures on Chandelas in English( the book that immeadiately comes to my mind is " An Advanced History of India" by Dr.R.C.Majumdar.Finally,the Palas probably ruled in Bengal,and perhaps not Kamrup.

Dear Metthew,
thanks! My books are packed because I'm moving to a new flat and the department's library is closed in August, so it's quite difficult to read new material.
I don't know if I'll never try to plan a project on Chandelas. But I find strong analogies with the Pala of Kamarupa (that now is my main geographical area of research):


Both are supposed to be hinduized or mixed-blood (samkarajati) dynasties.


Both reigned between the X and the XIII century CE.
Both were linked to the cult of the yogini.&nbsp;


Both produced erotic sculpures.&nbsp;



So, I need to know much more about Chandelas, their origins and their religious life - maybe through the iconographical study of their temples.&nbsp;
Best,Paolo

Dear Paolo,



Please see the introduction to my translation of the Prabodhacandrodaya, available here:

It certainly does not include everything about the Candellas, but it does have some additional references for you. I am sorry that I do not have pdf-s, however -- I was using old-fashioned xerox copies that are now in
 a storage box and not easy for me to access. If your project on the Candellas will continue for some months, I will be happy to see if I can locate what I have and then send it to you in the autumn, I do not believe that I will be returning to Candella studies
 myself. A lot of the useful work on the Candellas, by the way, is in Hindi.



best of luck,
Matthew
