Dear Patrick,

This may be a loose rendering of verse 6.20:

yatroparamate citta? niruddha? yogasevay?
yatra caiv?tman?tm?na? pa?yann ?tmani tu?yati

I do not know what other verse it could be. It would pretty much have to
have the phrase, ?tman?tm?nam, and this verse is the only one of the six
having this phrase that also has the word yoga.

Best regards,

David Reigle
