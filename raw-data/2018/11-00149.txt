Dear Artur,
I assume you know Johannes Bronkhorst's article in AS/EA LXIII/I (2009), pp. 7-27, "Hendrik Kern and the body of the Buddha"
I think it is very unlikely that the Buddha's body, or that of any other king (Da?aratha in R?m 2.60.12-14, 2.70.4) was laid down in a tub filled with hot oil, frying him like french fries. We are dealing with a process of embalming.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] The Buddha's body in a vat of oil

pali tela-doni, sanskrit taila-droni.

Was the body placed in cold - or hot oil?

Any mention of the oil's temperature in the accessible sources?
