Subject: [INDOLOGY] A regressive face of Indology at the World Sanskrit Conference
In-Reply-To: <CAJGj9eY+VyixaWh7tfNVaVHeb8DETwZWCD=hc3AkF+Fk_JCqQQ@mail.gmail.com>

 I am sorry, but I didn't quite get the message. The cause for making the
complaint was the unacademic, disrespectful and casteist behaviour against
female participants in the latest WSC.The video shows if anything that
Indian women can be trained in memorizing Vedic couplets and in reciting
them in a synchronized manner. It resembles a school performance which has
nothing to do with serious Sanskrit research and still less with the
offensive demeanour of the disputants and the blind eye WSC officials have
turned to it as described in previous posts.
In this context I am really wondering what the purpose of sending this
puzzling link might be?

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
