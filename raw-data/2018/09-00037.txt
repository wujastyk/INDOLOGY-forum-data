There are views ranging from

non-recognition of Radha as part of Bhagavata sampradaaya as there is no
direct mention of the name in Srimadbhaagavata puraaNa

through acceptance of Radha as a concept but from outside  Srimadbhaagavata
puraaNa

and through acceptance of Radha as a concept but from
within  Srimadbhaagavata puraaNa interpreting a certain event in Rasalila
as describing Radha only though name is not mentioned

to the view that Sri Krishna can not be without Radha and Radha is superior
to Sri Krishna.

To my knowledge, in Gaudiya Vaishnava, Radha is taken as the aa*raadhy*ataa
/aasvaadyataa in Sri Krishna and hence the idea of Sri Krishna without
Radha is a misnomer.

-----------------------------------------

Prof. Deshpande , though Maadhva by family tradition, seems to be not
following any 'Vaadabheda' to use the frequently used term from many Bhakti
poets.

-----------

My intention was as Dr B V K Sastry said, not to ask the poet to follow a
specific tradition.

----

Prof. Girish Jha too, as can be seen from his mails too saattvika to force
any one to do anything.

It appears to be his abhinives'a for the primacy of Radha that made him
express the way he did.
