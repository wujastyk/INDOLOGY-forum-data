Hello, Madhav,

Since the Table is introduced with an explanation discussing that many texts have multiple names, so that all the texts in the same box are to be considered alternate names of the same basic texts (variants between mss. and editions, etc. included), it would seem the Milindapa?ha??k? included as one of the titles, would be the same as the Milinda-??k? ed. by Jaini. Tracking down the various editions, mss., etc. could be done by checking the catalogues cited. 

The online book An Analysis of the P?li Canon (http://budsas.net/sach/en137.pdf <http://budsas.net/sach/en137.pdf> ) seems to be a composite of two works. The first part by Webb is an ?analysis? of the P?li canon; the second part, with the table of texts and the catalogues in which they are identified, was initially a different work by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita titled A Reference Table of Pali Literature, which the online edition has added to the Webb book, treating them as a joint work; which is why the pagination for the later part with the Table commences new pagination.

Rahula?s article should indicate which edition of the ??k? he consulted, and that then could be examined to see whether that coincides with the Jaini edition (which at first was a separate volume, but PTS eventually included it in their reprint of Pali edition of Milindapa?ha), or is an alternate version of the same (or different) text.

best,
Dan

I don?t believe that Jaini, who edited the Milinda-??k?, identified the author of that commentary, but, since it cites Buddhaghosa, it must be by someone post-Buddhaghosa.

He had a prodigious memory. Once he shut three of the gates of Anur?dhapura <http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/anuradhapura.html>, allowing only one door for the use of those leaving the city. As each person went out he asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530). He was a contemporary of C??an?ga <http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/culanaga.html> (DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), with whom he held discussions. His description (given at the Lohap?s?da) (DA.ii.442) of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic. He once went with a company of monks on a pilgrimage to N?gad?pa <http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/nagadipa.html>. On the way he stayed in a monastery. One of his followers, who lacked self-control, made friends with another of like temperament in the vih?ra, and C???bhaya, seeing them laugh aloud, pointed out how truly the Buddha had said in the Dh?tusa?yutta that like joins with like. VibhA.457?f.

Is this commentary the same as the Milinda??k? published by the PTS, or a different commentary?  The Milinda-A??hakath? of U N?rada alias Mingun Zetavun Sayadaw that was written around 1948 and transcribed and published by me [Studia Philologica Buddhica, Monograph Series XIII, Tokyo, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, 1999] refers to the opinion of a Tipi?aka-C?l??bhayatthera on p.57.  I would appreciate any information on this monk and his commentary on Milindapa?ha. Is it available anywhere? Best,
