Dear Professor Tieken,

Thank you for the information. I haven?t seen Eva Wilden?s article. I would appreciate it if someone can send me a PDF copy of the article. 

Thanks,
rajam

On pages 185-6 the author presents a "[t]entative chronological model in 4 layers for the development of the Tolk?ppiya? Porul?atik?ram Akatti?ai-iyal".

As far as ?layers? are concerned, my point was that after the Tolk?ppiyam was written down, it might have come into the keeping of a group of (Jain?) scholars, monks, or others who wished to keep it current and added to it or emended it. It is possible, though obviously it?s just speculation, that the section on the pu??i was added when the ?dot? (pu??i) started to be incorporated into the writing system. It is equally possible that the work itself postdates the appearance of the pu??i and that it is not layered at all but is actually the product of one person (or conceivably a group of people) who lived at a certain period.

Is there a change in the use of language or any other aspect of the text/content that could be identified as not fitting with some of the other parts of the work? I think this is unlikely, as the emenders (if they existed) would have been careful to add/change things so they appeared to fit with the older text.

What matters to me is the content of the Tolkappiyam, which is quite sophisticated in my opinion.]

>>> It was my impression that, like many older Indian works (cf. the Vy?sa Mah?bh?rata, the Rig Veda, probably the N??ya??stra), the Tolk?ppiyam is a collection of things that may have been composed at different dates. Some parts may be quite early, some later, but I would be pretty surprised if anything in the work is as late as the 9th century. My opinion is that parts of the work may go back to (or mirror/be influenced by) things as early as the 1st century BCE (and conceivably even earlier) while other parts may be as late as the 3rd or even 4th century CE. Burnell's work relating the Tolk?ppiyam to the Sanskrit Aindra (On the Aindra School of Sanskrit Grammarians: Their Place in the Sanskrit, available on Google) is important. One might note that P??ini describes things that are earlier than the Sanskrit used when he composed his work ? I am not a vaiy?kara?ika, but I am sure people on this list can speak to this. The writers of grammars, whether in Sanskrit or Tamil, do not appear out of thin air. George

Which would match the datings proposed by Prof. Tieken in his recently reprinted study on this issue.

In his first edition Mahadevan had said on p. 231, ?It is thus clear that this grammatical work must have been composed after the pu??i was invented and had become an integral part of Tamil writing. Judging from the available evidence of the earliest occurrence of the pu??i from about the end of the 1st century A.D., Tolk?ppiyam was composed most probably not earlier than the Late Tamil-Br?hm? Period (ca. 2nd-4th centuries A.D.)? Unfortunately, Mahadevan had not consulted a crucial article by Rajam Ramamurti of 1982 entitled, "The Relevance of the Term Mey, O??u, and Pu??i To the System of Tamil Morpho-phonemics" in International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, 11 , no. 1, pp. 167-183.
