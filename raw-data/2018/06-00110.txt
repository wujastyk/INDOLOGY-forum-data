Hello McComas,
A glossary of grammatical Sanskrit terms is appended to the textbook in Robert Goldman?s Devav???prave?ik? starting on p. 403. They are in Sanskrit with a straight English translation at times and other times they are just explained. If your colleague is not very familiar with Sanskrit grammatical terms, it may not be easy always to find the term as in the example of the present tense: vartam?ne la? directs you to la? on the preceding page. Many of the translations/explanations terms are easily found by going through the four ad half pages of the glossary. 

Wishing good luck to your colleague's enterprise.
