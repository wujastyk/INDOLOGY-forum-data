Dear Dominik,

Does what applies to Skt dro?am (ntr) also apply to P?li do?? (fem.)? I have to add that I find it hard to believe that the body was indeed immersed in a bathtub full of oil.

"teli-dona" in Sanskrit would be "taila-dro?am".  This expression occurs twice in the Carakasa?hit?.  In both cases it should be understood not in the sense of "a barrel of oil," but rather "ten litres of oil."  A dro?a is a unit of measure (see Roots of Ayurveda "?ar?gadhara on weights measures and definitions."  A dro?a is not exactly ten litres, but roughly so.

When the Carakasa?hit? gives its longevity instructions at Ca.ci.4.7, the patient is to be put in a barrel and the word is dro?a: snehabh?vit?y?m ?rdrapal??adro?y?? sapidh?n?y?? digv?s?? ?ay?ta "he should lie naked in a pal??a-wood barrel that has been steeped with oil, covered with a lid."  (Roots, "Rejuvenation through Soma" in the Su?ruta chapter).

My conclusion is that although there are oiled barrels in classical Ayurveda, a teli-dona isn't a barrel of oil, but rather an amount of oil.

Best,
Dominik

Dr.Karp,
I apologise for being a little late in citing a probable reference vis-a-vis your query.I could access my library
only yesterday evening,where I came across the book"The Vedantic Buddhism of Buddha"by J.G.Gennings(Oxford University Press ,1948).Pg 427 of the book g
brings out the fact,that after Buddha's Mahaparinirvana,HIS body was first wrapped in unsoiled garment and cotton,and then laid on an oil-trough to form the pyre.This has reference in the Khudda Nikaya of the Sutta pitaka.The word Teli-Dona implies oil-trough.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Buddha's body in a vat of oil

pali tela-doni, sanskrit taila-droni.

Was the body placed in cold - or hot oil?

Any mention of the oil's temperature in the accessible sources?
