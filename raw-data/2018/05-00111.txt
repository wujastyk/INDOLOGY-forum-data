Subject: [INDOLOGY] Spaces between words in Sanskrit manuscripts?

The use of word dividers is very widespread in manuscripts from Northern India and Nepal in general?for instance, it is developed to a high degree of exactness in Jaina manuscripts. As to the use of blank spaces between words, my impression is that blank spaces were used to separate syntactic units in prose or verses already early on, but not for single words systematically.

Best wishesm

Camillo

For one specific case of markers used to indicate word boundaries, see Hahn's 2007 edition of the Kapphi??bhyudaya pp. 4ff. I have also found them in other MSS, mostly from Nepal.

All the Best,
Victor
