"Engineering students across the country will be introduced to a new kind of ?science fiction? in the next academic year, thanks to the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE)....
what is seen as an attempt to instil pride and awareness about India's fabled past so that they are not swept off their feet by the advancements in science and technology in the West.
The objective might be laudable, but the claims made in ?Bharatiya Vidya Saar?, edited by Dr Shashibala, have drawn flak."

 
I have heard that Dominik has written one or two articles that address some the more outrageous of these claims.
Are those available anywhere? Are there papers by others as well?
Best,
Dean
