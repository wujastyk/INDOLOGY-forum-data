Subject: [INDOLOGY] caesarean sections
Message-ID: <CAAyw6C=be6CrZSCvJWfq-2Ch=vVezM=ZOegr=OrbtBG=ZYs3mg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I ask on behalf of a friend of mine who works in the history of medicine
and has little knowledge of South Asian medical history: can anyone share
references to pre-modern (ideally pre-second millennium CE) descriptions of
caesarean sections in South Asian literature?

I'd be very grateful for any pointers...

Many thanks in advance!

Robert
