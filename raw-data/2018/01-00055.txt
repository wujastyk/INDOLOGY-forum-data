?Dear Raph,


I am forwarding your message to the INDOLOGY forum.  Your query is going
out to the list membership (700 scholars) and perhaps *somebody* will know
enough Tirahi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirahi_language> to help, or
can give you a pointer to someone else who knows the language and can help
you promote the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis amongst Tirahi speakers :-)


Dear INDOLOGY members, please reply directly to Dr Paraschos.

Subject: Tirahi speakers needed


Hello Mr Wujastyk,

I hope you're well today. I found your email address after stumbling upon
Indology's website. I'm conducting research for a project I'm working on,
aiming to raise awareness about UNESCO's list of languages in danger.

One of them is Tirahi and what I'm looking for is very simple: a speaker
eager to record the phrase "A different language is a different vision of
life" - in Tirahi. I feel this is a good way for people to discover the
essence of each language through its sound.

I would really appreciate your help, so please let me know if you or anyone
you know would be able to help. By all means I'll be very happy to answer
any questions you may have, and to share more information about the project.

Thank you in advance. Looking forward to hearing from you,
Raph
