Dear All,

A, perhaps, simplistic explanation for the unexpected textual appearance of
Draupadi?s polyandrous marriage - quite unknown to the earlier strata of
the epic.



To my mind ? a bit of cultural politics, at work. Surrounding inclusions of
new economically important tribal territories in the realm of the 'Aryas'.



The need to show to its fresh members that they do belong ? despite some of
their outlandish customs. The need to demonstrate that we, the 'Aryas',
also share them - the example of one of them, of polyandrous union, is
certainly to be found in our great epic. And, considering the status of its
participants, it is given a properly high prestige.


Regards, etc.,
