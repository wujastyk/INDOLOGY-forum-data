Oggetto: Masato Fujii's article


Dear colleagues,



does anybody have a copy of: Fujii, Masato. ?The Bahi?pavam?na Ritual of the Jaimin?yas?. Machikaneyama

Ronso (Philosophy), Vol. 20, pp. 3?25, 1986.

I'm struggling to find it and will be very thankful if you could help and share.



With thanks
