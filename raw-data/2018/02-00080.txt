Take a look at  Android app. This app provides all 18t Chapters. This
doesn't provides searching option but it is easy to copy paste the text
from the app and pasting in a text file and then you can search. Since 18th
Chapter is not available on GRETIL it is not that hassle to copy paste only
one chapter
