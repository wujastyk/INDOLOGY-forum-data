Subject: [INDOLOGY] How to translate an indological book from French to English

Dear members of the Indology list,

Two years ago, I announced that my book Les math?matiques de l'autel 
v?dique, Le Baudh?yana ?ulbas?tra et son commentaire ?ulbad?pik?, was 
published by Droz, Geneva.
Since then, some reviews have been written and one of them (see the last 
sentence of the attached file) insists on the urgence to translate the 
book into English. But English is not my mother language, and it would 
be much time-consuming for me to do so.
Could anybody propose a solution to this problem ? Of course, I would be 
very happy to supervise the translation, in order to see if the meaning 
is well respected.

Best regards and thank you for your help,

Dr J.M.Delire,
Lecturer on Science and Civilization of India - Sanskrit texts at the 
University of Brussels
