?ideodiversity as a planetary value?



Although I participated in the WSC mega-Sanskrit-conference in Vancouver, I
missed the stormy event to which Dr. Farkhondeh and others refer. I
therefore thank Dr. Audrey Truschke, Dr. Iris Farkhondeh and Dr. Ananya
Vajpeyi for sharing and expressing their trying experiences and their
well-considered positions. Since a lack of understanding and communication
in combination with deep emotions is evidently a part of the problem, it
could be useful to try to express their main points *also* in classical
Sanskrit which was, from its post-P??inian beginnings onwards, a language
of communication and emancipation shaped to a large extent *also* by
Buddhist thinkers and scholars, a language which was for the first time in
human history easily, quickly, widely and reliably accessible for learning,
debate and discussion, in just 6 months, by anyone willing to study one of
the available grammars  ?

see, inter alia, section 2 in my

"Linguistic Paradox and Diglossia:

the emergence of Sanskrit and Sanskritic language in Ancient India"

To be taken into account in the discussion is that what some of us can
study as just ?the past? gone by (*at**?**ta*) to which we have the full
right to freely apply *pratyak**?a* (attestable text passages) and
*anum?na*-based
exegesis, may be for others knowledge that arrives to us from the elders (
*?-**gama*) for which we have the full right to support it enthusiastically
through *pratyak**?**a* and *anu**m?na* ? which is what usually happens in
our academic traditions as well, the paradigm being primordial and the
perceptual and inferential being supportive as long as it goes: Alexandre
Koyr?, Thomas Kuhn, Randall Collins and other historians of science.



The impasse to which the opposition between those emphasizing *?**gama* and
those emphasizing* pratyak**?a* and *anum?na* (in ancient India: Buddhists
but also early S??khya thinkers: www.academia.edu/6171052) will sooner or
later lead will remain insurmountable, unless both parties become aware of,
and are willing to appreciate, the very plurality of *?gama*. (This does
not imply a full-fledged relativity of all *?gama*: the Human Rights ?
*m?nav?dhik?r??
*www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Language.aspx?LangID=skt* ?* are an obvious
candidate as widely acceptable bottom-line.) As much as it is undesirable
to emphasize one-sidedly *anum?na *(*kiyad v? ?akyam unnetum  svatarkam
anudh?vat?*, at the conclusion of the ancient commentary on the
V?kyapad?ya), it is also undesirable to emphasize one-sidedly one?s own
traditional instructions (*aitihya*) without attempting an empathic study
of other traditions as well. This study of various traditions has itself a
humanistic, formative value and sharpens our intellect (*praj?? viveka?
labhate...*).



Since I have concluded here and elsewhere that it is important in Indology
to express our conclusions not only in the intellectual *lingua franca* of
modern times, (no more French or German, but now) English (and in the
future, according to some, perhaps Chinese), but also in the language which
is for many of us a major object of study and which has *de facto*
functioned as intellectual *lingua franca* in ancient India and Asia up to
modern times, I summarize my position here as follows in Sanskrit, in a
couple of self-composed verses (*?loka* and *indravajr?*) with, in the
second verse, a few obvious intertextual references to well-known
philosophical texts in Sanskrit:



???????? ???????????  ??? ????????? ????????? ?

   ???????????? ??????  ??? ???????? ?????? ? ? ?

??????? ?????? ???? ???????  ?????????????????????? ?

  ????????????????? ???????????  ??? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ? ? ?

yatrayatra hy at?tatvam  eke vindanti cintan?t /

   tatratatr??gama? so?yam? eke pa?yanti sarvad? // 1 //

praj?? viveka? labhate gur????   bhinn?gamaprek?a?a??lanena /

   svaitihyam?tr?t kiyad unnayeta   ki? j??natulya? hi pavitram atra // 2 //



The second verse is part of my ?Poetic Lines on the Universality of
Sanskrit? (contribution to the Kavisamav?ya at the WSC in Vancouver), and
as popular metres and melodies have played a significant role, ca. 2000
years ago, in the development of classical, post-Vedic metres, I have felt
free and justified to put these and other metres (*?loka*, *indravajr?* and
the less well-known *mand?kin?*) to modern melodies inspired by *prasiddh?ni
sa?g?t?ni *(guess which ones?):
