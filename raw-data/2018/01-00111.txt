Subject: [INDOLOGY] "Caste passing"
In-Reply-To: <CALNcvFtc7=vyvNuc1ribMDL17sZWNBJuJhKe2cLjESp3f2T1Xg@mail.gmail.com>

If successful disguise is counted as successful impersonation or passing,

Pandavas disguise themselves as Brahmins in Ekachakrapura and participate
in svayamvara in that form only.

Are you / Is she looking for such cases?
