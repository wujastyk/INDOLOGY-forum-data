I'm sorry to be lazy, but is it possible to summarize the scholarship on
?/kh alternation as stating that it is

   - due in some cases to orthographic practice,
   - in other cases to spoken dialectical variation, and
   - in yet other cases to the orthographic recording of a spoken form?

In other words, when we see ?/kh in manuscripts, it's not automatically
possible to tell whether we are seeing a valid recording of phonetic /?/ or
/kh/, or just a scribe writing kh when he sees ? in his exemplar or hears
/?/ in the dictation he's following?  So a critical editor should not
automatically transcribe vikhaya or dokha as vi?aya and do?a?
