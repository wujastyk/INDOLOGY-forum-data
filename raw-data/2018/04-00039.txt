l was also going to suggest 6.5 might be an option but I decided David's suggestion was closer.
I think it is likely that the person paraphrased from memory and thus conflated more than one verse.
Like Hinduism itself, it is often impossible to locate the "one source".? :-)
Best,

Thank you, David, for taking the time to respond. I have followed an interesting trail to get to the "source" of this quote. By that, I mean the website from which the person who wrote the article I found it in used as a source.?So far, neither of these authors has responded, so I put this quote into google and it is used in a surprising number of instances.?One comment on Reddit suggests that it might come from 6.5It is interesting that I am not the first person to wonder where, exactly, this quote is found in the BhG, or possibly more correctly, which verse inspires this loose translation, if we can even call it that. Perhaps, paraphrasing is more accurate? I personally find the ways knowledge from texts is reconstituted and retransmitted around yogaland to be fascinating.?
All the best,

Dear Patrick,

This may be a loose rendering of verse 6.20:

yatroparamate citta? niruddha? yogasevay?
yatra caiv?tman?tm?na? pa?yann ?tmani tu?yati?

I do not know what other verse it could be. It would pretty much have to have the phrase, ?tman?tm?nam, and this verse is the only one of the six having this phrase that also has the word yoga.

Best regards,

Hello,?
I'm curious about this quote as I am writing about the use of phrases related to ,,journeys to self,,. In a google search for examples, I came across this
"Yoga is the journey of the self , through the self, to the self ~ The Bhagavad Gita"
Might anyone know which chapter and verse this translation is? I do not recognise it.
Thanks, Patrick??
