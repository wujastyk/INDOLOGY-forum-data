Continuing my Krishna verses:

Am I awake or asleep? Is this a dream or reality? I don?t know anything. O
Lord, stay near me.

??????? ?? ??????????? ?? ???? ?? ???? ?
??????? ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ???????: ???????
O Lord, what difference does it make to me if it is a dream or reality, if
the Lord is always awake in my heart?
