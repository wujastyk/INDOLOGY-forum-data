Dar Prof. Slaje,

Many thanks for sharing this insightful quotes from the BVP mailing list.

Leonardo da Vinci, who - doubtlessly by force of his own karma - was unlucky enough to have been reborn in Italy

As an Italian, I must join this anonymous Indian colleague in pitying the horrible fate that befell Leonardo da Vinci and hope that what he accomplished during his sad life in Renaissance Italy and France allowed him to be reborn as a male on the soil of ????.

Best wishes,

Camillo Formigatti

Dear List,

> Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat [...] has grown enormously during the last ten years. BVP is everybody?s need.

Should the Swadeshi spirit of the BVP also permeate the planned churning of Western Indologists in Udupi, the circle of the needful will keep within clearly definable limits.

Two quotes from BVP should suffice to make plain the ideological direction things are taking at present.

A question on the linguistic age of Sanskrit as treated in Antonia Ruppel's "Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit" (2017) is answered there in this way:
"I would request you not to fully believe on this because, these westerners have manipulated many of our scriptures date to either after Christ or if not then some vague date. In Chennai or in Kerala, if there is any old Sanskritam institution then pls contact them. Cambridge Oxford Harvard Columbia and many have done enough harm to our Literature."

Harm done to Sanskrit and Indian literature by the sinister world of anglophone scholars set aside, here is another of the many gems of that sort: Leonardo da Vinci, who - doubtlessly by force of his own karma - was unlucky enough to have been reborn in Italy, was considered to become a namesake for a school in India run by an Indian person. One of Swadeshi Indic persons reacted to the above idea of making this hapless Western polymath a name patron in India in the following manner:
"Italy may have 1 person, but ours is a vast country. Hence we just can't have 1. We have many.  Give your friend name of many Bhartiya counterpart names. Let them know that we are in multiples in every field."

Future subjects of Indological research on the changing intellectual environment of contemporary India appear in front of our eyes like grease drops floating on the soup. Time to apply for funds. The sources are inexhaustible.

Regards,
WS
