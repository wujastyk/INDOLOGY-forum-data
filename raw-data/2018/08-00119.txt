This is not re skulls in the Tantropakhyana, Tantrakhyayika and Artola's work [cf. H. Tull's post of 30-6-2017], but this ---

Two Fantasy Fictions from the Bengal Renaissance, New Delhi: OUP, 2018: 

a book on the margins/intersections of folktale/folklore studies, kiddylit studies and colonial Indological cultural studies proper.  

Maybe there is a  Bengal/South Asia-involved folklorist who would be willing to review it for the Folklore Fellows, who say they will not send it out for review themselves, but will print a review if they receive one? (This seems to be an odd way of doing things, but that is what they said.)
