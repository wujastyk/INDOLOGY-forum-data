 Dear all,

Following the positive reactions to last year?s (and still ongoing) course,
I will again be offering an online Sanskrit course based on my textbook,
The Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit.

- The course will start October 1.
- It will require about three hours of work per week and will take you
through the book in about two years.
- Participants will receive weekly emails (sent through google groups) that
set a certain amount of work and list the various resources that will take
them through that material: in addition to the relevant pages of the book,
each chapter comes with its own video and online flashcards as well as
freely downloadable supplementary handouts.
- There is no fixed course time; anyone can do the work and access the
materials at whatever time(s) during the week that best suits them.
- Exercises from the textbook will be assigned each week, and the Key to
them provided.
- Each week concludes with a self-graded test; and every six or so
chapters, there will be a more comprehensive exam.

There are no fees, no credits and no certificates; the course?s sole
purpose is to help people learn Sanskrit. The only costs participants incur
are the money for the textbook and the time they spend on their work each
week.

If you are interested (or know someone who might be), please join the
google group for the course:

cis-study-group-2018+subscribe at googlegroups.com

(You can unsubscribe at any time.)

There also is a Facebook group used for asking questions about each week?s
material and anything else relating to the course:

https://www.facebook.com/groups/CambridgeIntroToSanskrit/

Any questions, please email me at cambridge.sanskrit at gmail.com. Feel free
to forward this email widely. As attachments sometimes don?t make it
through on mailing lists, I have simply added the text of the syllabus for
the first term at the bottom of this email.

All the best,
    Antonia

PS: The ongoing course currently is on Chapter 12 of the textbook; get in
touch with me if you'd like to join that.



*The Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit: An Online Course*



*Syllabus*



*General*

This document gives you an overview of what material from the *Cambridge
Introduction to Sanskrit *(CIS) will be covered each week.



Starting on September 28, there will be a *new email and Facebook group
update every Friday*. This email will include details on (1) how to
approach the coming week?s material and (2), from the end of the first week
on, a test on the material you have just studied. Each test will come with
a key to the answers and a grade scale, allowing you to check your own
work, see what progress you have made and which material you may want to
look over again.



*Textbook*

A.M. Ruppel, *The Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit *(Cambridge University
Press). ISBN: 978-1107459069 (international edition, paperback);
978-1108439152 (South Asian edition, paperback). (Both have identical
content.)



*Other Resources*

For each Chapter, there is an accompanying YouTube video, the direct link
to which will be included in each week?s email. For all new verb and noun
forms, as well as for all Sanskrit characters and *sandhi* forms (relevant
later!), there are flash cards on the CIS Brainscape account. There also
are a variety of downloadable handouts. All of these can be accessed via
the CIS website, *www.cambridge-sanskrit.org
<http://www.cambridge-sanskrit.org/>*.



*Study Suggestions*

Don?t try to do too much at once. When you read a new content section, do
that for 30-45 minutes. But when you memorise new material, repeated
sessions of no more than 10-15 minutes are best. (Google *?Spaced
Repetition?* and read the Wikipedia entry on this topic for some ideas on
how to memorise new material.)



*A Practical Point*

Sanskrit isn?t easy. This course tries to make it easier by suggesting a
pace that should allow you to digest new material before going on to the
next chunk, and by providing a variety of resources that will hopefully
offer something to everyone. Still, the material *is* challenging, so if
you ever find yourself struggling, remind yourself the problem is *not* that
you are not good enough. You?re finding it challenging because it is
challenging. And if you have any specific questions, do post them in the
Facebook group.
