Dear Nagarajji,

     Here is the passage form Radhakrishnan's introduction to his TR of the
Bhagavadg?t? [p.67]:

[image: Inline image 1]

It is now clear to me that ?a?kara himself does not use the term
madhyam?dhik?ri in reference to Arjuna.  However, the  Bh??ya on the
verse "*vy?mi?re?eva
v?kyena buddhim mohayas?va me*" [BG 3.2] uses the term mandabuddhi to refer
to him: *yadyapi vivikt?bhidh?y? bhagav?n tath?pi mama mandabuddher
vy?mi?ram iva bhagavadv?kyam pratibh?ti.  *On the contrary, Madhv?c?rya
calls Arjuna *uttam?dhik?r? *at the beginning of his
Bhagavadg?t?-T?tparya-Nir?aya.
