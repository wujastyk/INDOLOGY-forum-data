Dear Toke.

I've never seen this referring to "the earth." But  in Buddhist sources frequently to the triangular or trapezoidal shape attributed to Jambudv?pa, the southern continent.

best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Cart-shaped, ?aka??k?ra

Hi all,

In a passage of interest to me, the author attributes to ?some? the idea that the earth resembles or is shaped like a cart (bhuvam ? ?aka??k?r?m). I?m trying to understand (1) what precisely is understood by ?cart-shaped? (?aka??k?ra or ?aka??k?ti) and (2) how the earth can have the shape of a cart.

In Phanindra Nath Bose?s _Principles of Indian Silpasastra_ from 1926, ?aka??k?ti is explained (p. 75) as, ?cart-shaped or quadrangular, with a long triangular projection on one side.?

In the ?ilpa-prak??a (Alice Boner and Sad??iva Rath ?arm??s edition, translation, and study, second revised edition, 2005), a list of shapes of building sites is given. One such shape is ?aka??k?ti (verse 1.39), which is translated as ?a tapering bullock-cart (?aka??k?ti ku?cita).? The book contains facsimiles of the palm leaf pages of a manuscript, which includes drawings to illustrate the building-site shapes (plate I). The drawing of the cart-shaped building site doesn?t look like what Bose describes (see above), but rather looks like an isosceles trapezoid.

I also found that ?cart-shaped? is included in a list of possible shapes of the sacred ??lagr?ma stones. This particular shape is undesirable.

Would any of you have any clues or thoughts on which geometrical figure (or figures) ?cart-shaped? refers to? Or further references in this regard?

Best wishes,
Toke
