Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tanjore Descriptive Catalogue vol XX?
Message-ID: <20180821115822.uu9k9ya40sk4c0k4@webmail1.abo.fi>


Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have a soft copy of vol XX of the Descriptive Catalogue of  
the Tanjore Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library, Tanjore? The  
ones on Archive.org go up to XIX, but according to NCC, there should  
be a 20th vol, "since issued". I would be most grateful for any help.

Sincerely,
M?ns Broo
