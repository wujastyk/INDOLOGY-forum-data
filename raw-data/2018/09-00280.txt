Sanskrit or allied studies in the last five years beginning March 2015.

The HRF is for research work to be conducted in South Asia for a  
period of at least two weeks in any field related to Sanskrit and  
allied studies.

The DEADLINE for the written project proposal is 31 DECEMBER 2018.

The honorary research fellowship, valued at 1000 Euros, will be
