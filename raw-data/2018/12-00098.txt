Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sandilya- and Narada-bhakti-sutra studies?
Message-ID: <20181220112733.1zlhvp8r8k4sk4ow@webmail2.abo.fi>


Dear Colleagues,

Is anyone aware of any studies of the Sandilya- and/ or  
Naradabhaktisutra? There are many popular editions available  
especially of the latter, but I haven't found any scholarly studies of  
them.

Sincerely,
M?ns Broo
