Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question: Language of Book
Message-ID: <89E07E3E-469E-4321-B2E4-8A858A07A538@hum.ku.dk>

Hi all,

A friend is cataloguing a book and asked me about what language it?s written in. It?s a vernacular, but I don?t know which. I?ve attached two pictures. Would any of you be able to tell me what language the book is in?

With all best wishes,
Toke
