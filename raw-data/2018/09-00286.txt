In an article by Ankur Barua [
http://introductiontoappliedbuddhism.blogspot.com/2009/10/bodhisatta-concept-in-theravada.html],
I came across this reference: "Therav?din author who wished to become a
Buddha by following the Bodhisatta-y?na is the `Sri Lankan

monk Mah?-Tipitaka C?l?bhaya. In his subcommentary on the ?Questions of
King Milinda? during the twelfth-century, he wrote that he wished to become
a Buddha at the end of his work."  Is this commentary the same as the
Milinda??k? published by the PTS, or a different commentary?  The
Milinda-A??hakath? of U N?rada alias Mingun Zetavun Sayadaw that was
written around 1948 and transcribed and published by me [Studia Philologica
Buddhica, Monograph Series XIII, Tokyo, The International Institute for
Buddhist Studies, 1999] refers to the opinion of a
Tipi?aka-C?l??bhayatthera on p.57.  I would appreciate any information on
this monk and his commentary on Milindapa?ha. Is it available anywhere?
Best,
