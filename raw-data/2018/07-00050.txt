Subject: NEW BOOK> A Yog?c?ra Buddhist Theory of Metaphor, by Roy Tzohar

Dear All,

My apologies for cross-posting. I would like to announce the publication of
my new book, A Yog?c?ra Buddhist Theory of Metaphor by Oxford University
Press. The book is available in hardcover and electronic formats. it can be
ordered from Amazon but it is cheaper on OUP website.

The description on the back matter reads as follows:

Buddhist philosophy is fundamentally ambivalent toward language. Language
is paradoxically seen as both obstructive and necessary for liberation. In
this book, Roy Tzohar delves into the ingenious response to this tension
from the Yog?c?ra school of Indian Buddhism: that all language-use is
metaphorical. Exploring the profound implications of this claim, Tzohar
makes the case for viewing the Yog?c?ra account as a full-fledged theory of
meaning, one that is not merely linguistic, but also applicable both in the
world as well as in texts.

Despite the overwhelming visibility of figurative language in Buddhist
philosophical texts, this is the first sustained and systematic attempt to
present an indigenous Buddhist theory of metaphor. By grounding the
Yog?c?ra pan-metaphorical claim in a broader intellectual context, of both
Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools, the book uncovers an intense
philosophical conversation about metaphor and language that reaches across
sectarian lines. Tzohar's analysis radically reframes the Yog?c?ra
controversy with the Madhyamaka school of philosophy, sheds light on the
Yog?c?ra application of particular metaphors, and explicates the school's
unique understanding of experience.
