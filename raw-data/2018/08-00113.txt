Subject: [INDOLOGY] Resources for commentarial interpretations of particles
In-Reply-To: <BN6PR1101MB2211C5623F60E1F8089E851EA1390@BN6PR1101MB2211.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

Alas Bochenski's discussion (art. 53 sec. F) consists of 9 lines, 3 
lines of which are a schema for the three conditions of the Trairuupya, 
are translations of eva, respectively, as "wholly", "only" and "never".

On `eva', see the following:

Kajiyama, Y. 1973 Three kinds of affirmation and two kinds of negation in
Buddhist philosophy. Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?dasiens: v. 17,
pp. 161 ? 175.

Gillon, Brendan and Richard Hayes 1982 The role of the particle eva in (log-
ical) quantification in Sanskrit. Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde 
S?dasiens:
v. 26, pp. 195 ? 203.

Ganeri, Jonardon Dharmak??rti?s semantics for the particle eva. In: 
Studies in the Bud-
dhist Epistemological Tradition Proceedings of the Third International
Dharmak??rti Conference, Hiroshima, 11-16 November, 1997 (Verlag
der ?sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, edited Shoryu
Katsura, 1999), pp. 101?116.

Gillon, Brendan Another look at the Sanskrit particle eva. In: Studies 
in the Bud-
dhist Epistemological Tradition Proceedings of the Third International
Dharmak??rti Conference, Hiroshima, 11-16 November, 1997 (Verlag
der ?sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, edited Shoryu
Katsura, 1999), pp. 117?130.

An appendix to the last article provides a taxonomy of the various 
usages found in the Svaarthaanumaana section up to verse 38 of 
Dharmak??rti's Pramaa.navaarttika. I have found that taxonomy to be 
borne out in various readings I have done since then. (There are usages 
which were to me, at least, unclassifiable.)
