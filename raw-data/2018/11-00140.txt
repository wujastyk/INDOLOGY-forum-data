Subject: [INDOLOGY] Questions about Octavio Paz's Indian sources
Message-ID: <696D5C4E-F457-4151-AFB7-A037949F4214@yahoo.fr>

Dear Colleagues, 

I am working on a PhD thesis in Spanish studies about the influence of Indian cultures on Octavio Paz?s poetry, in Lille University. Although I have some knowledge of Sanskrit, it is still very limited. 

In the Monkey Grammarian, the following excerpt looks like the translation of a liturgical hymn: 

 ?Brotan los arroyos de mantequilla (la verga de oro est? en el centro), corren como r?os, se reparten y huyen como gacelas ante el cazador, saltan como mujeres que van a una cita de amor, las cucharadas de mantequilla acarician al le?o abrasado y el Fuego las acepta complacido.? (Original text, published in 1974)

?Jaillissent les ruisseaux de beurre (la verge d?or est au centre), ils roulent comme les fleuves, se divisent et fuient telles devant le chasseur les gazelles, sautent comme des femmes courant au rendez-vous d?amour, les cuiller?es de beurre caressent les b?ches embras?es et le Feu s?y compla?t et les accepte.? (French translation published in 1972, before the original Spanish text).  

I thought it was written after a Vedic hymn but I was unable to find anything similar in the R?gveda. I would be very grateful if somebody can identify the original text. 

Besides, in the epigraph of the same book, Paz quotes Dowson, A classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology:

?Hanum?n was a grammarian; and the R?m?yana says: ?The chief of monkeys is perfect; no one equals him in the s?stras, in learning, and in ascertaining the sense of scriptures (or moving at will). It is is well known that Hanum?n was the ninth author of grammar?.?

Would anybody know where I could find more information about that tradition of grammarians?
Are there anymore informations than what is given by Muir and Colebrooke?


I thank you in advance for your help
Kind regards, 

Caroline Parvaty Dubois
