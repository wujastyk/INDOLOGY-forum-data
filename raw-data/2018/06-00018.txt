Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brackets in modern sanskrit translations
In-Reply-To: <CAKdt-CeJE-65WDa7svbDaG9XrL=hYuYYPgDKaA7fe+-hfuTheg@mail.gmail.com>

The use of brackets in translations of philosophical texts in particular 
has been much discussed lately, and my impression is that in this area 
brackets have fallen out of favor (or are in the process of falling ...).

McCrea and Patil articulate and also demonstrate a "no 
brackets"-approach to translation in their rendering of J??na?r?mitra's 
Apohaprakara?a ("Buddhist Philosophy of Language in India", Columbia 
Univ. Press 2010).

But to answer Harry Spier's specific question, the convention I am 
familiar with in German translations is that square brackets are used 
for supplying words without lexical representation in the Sanskrit, 
while round brackets are used to enclose Sanskrit terms when such terms 
are adduced within the English translation.

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
