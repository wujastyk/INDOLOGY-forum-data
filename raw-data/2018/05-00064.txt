What kind of a great thief you are, O M?dhava?  You were not satisfied with
[stealing] yoghurt [from the milkmaids of Gokula].  You also stole the
great ignorance of Arjuna on the battlefield.

O Kr???a, I am a friend of yours.  Becoming a helper to me, please take
away the ignorance spread around me on the battlefield of my mind.

your assistance?  Do become a helper to me in this battle of mine and stand
on the chariot of my mind.

Seeing you near me as the driver of the chariot of my  mind, determined for
