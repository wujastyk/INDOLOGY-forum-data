Greetings (and apologies for cross-posting),
On a recent trip to Kathmandu, I photographed a stupa that has carved onto one of its sides the four major events in the life of the Buddha; on the other three sides are other events, presumably from the Jataka tales. I'm looking for some assistance in identifying these other images in order to use in class. If anybody would like to take a look, I can send all of these images off-list nicely packaged in a Powerpoint. Thanks for any help in advance!
Best,Michael?
