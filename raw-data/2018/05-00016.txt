Here are further verses on Krishna and Tarkika:

The Logician says:

??? ???????? ????? ???????? ??????? ?

???? ?????????????????? ?????????? ??

If I give up my logic, which has been the guide of my intelligence, then
who will prevent it from going astray and from a disaster?


Reply:

??? ???????? ???????: ?????????? ?????? ?

??? ???? ??? ????????? ?????? ?? ??

Govinda himself is the driver on the chariot of Arjuna.  Tell me how his
chariot can go astray.


???? ?? ?????? ????????????? ???? ?????? ?

???? ??????? ??????? ???????: ??

O Logician, instantly make him the driver of the chariot of your mind.  That
Ocean of Compassion will prevent it from going astray.


??? ????????????? ??????? ???????: ?

????? ??? ?????? ??????? ????? ??????????? ??

If Kr???a were to become the guide of your ship, he will most certainly
take you across the formidable ocean of life.


? ?? ??????? ??????????????? ??????? ??? ???? ?

??????????????? ??????????? ????: ??

O Logician, your logic is incapable of knowing the highest abode.  A dwarf,
even if he raises his arms, is incapable of getting the fruit of a coconut
tree.


????????? ??? ??????? ??? ????????? ????? ?

? ??? ???????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ??

If your logic is insufficient to know the abode that is beyond logic, that
does not take away the success of logic in other areas.


??????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ?

????: ???????? ??????? ? ??????????: ??

Therefore, O Logician, don?t be depressed about the ability of your logic.  Let
your logic be your toy, but not the driver of the chariot of your mind.


????????????????????? ??????: ??? ??? ?

????: ????????????? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ??

The chariots of mind do not reach that highest abode of Vi??u, but M?dhava
can become the driver of your chariot of your mind and take it there.


??????? ????? ???????? ???????????? ?

???????? ???????????? ???????? ??? ???? ??

Enough of this debate, you poor soul, the best among logicians.  After
hearing about the friendship of M?dhava, you act as you please.


???? ??????? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ??: ?

??????????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ??

Go your on way, O Logician.  May you be fine.  Proclaim that you killed God.
But we know the relative strength of God and Logician.
