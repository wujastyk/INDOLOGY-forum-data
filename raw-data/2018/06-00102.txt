Hello Lubom?re,

Even though your initial inquiry is about S??khya ontological questions, we can draw from some of the epistemological material of the YD, which shows that puru?a has no connection with vyakta, such as instruments/faculties engaged in the operation of acquiring knowledge. See YD on SK 36 (Wezler/Motegi edition), p. 223, l.1ff. 

tay? c?dhyavas?yar?p?pannay? cetan??aktir anug?hyate. na kara??ntarasya puru?e?a sambandho ?sti?

The intellect acquired the form of non-doubting awareness (adhyavas?ya) having accepted the conscious power/power of consciousness. There is no connection/bond of an internal instrument with the unintentional consciousness (puru?a)? 

 Of course, there is more to be said.

A little note: I would like to suggest that sometime we need to play a little with the way how we choose translating: vipary?sa, vipar?ta, etc., which may be understood as ?contrast? and not necessarily ?opposite.?    

Edeltraud Harzer. 

PS Jayama?gal? is suspected sometime that there might be other influences.

Sure, it might reflect some older teaching that survived outside the S??khya mainstream. But the question whether each puru?a is all-pervasive all the time or only when liberated seems to me rather crucial. All commentaries apparently take it for granted that puru?as are all-pervasive all the time, only Jayama?gal? for some reason distinguishes between liberated and non-liberated puru?a. This puzzles me.

I cannot answer the question of my students how could puru?a (who is absolutely passive etc.) change itself so dramatically? And where does this concept occur in classical S??khya? Could you please help me with these answers? I am not a specialist in S??khya, we have this seminar just for fun, so I probably missed something in S??khya teaching on puru?a. I promised to my students that I will ask this learned forum to get the right answers.
