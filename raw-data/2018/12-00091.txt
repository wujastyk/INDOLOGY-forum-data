I am sad to learn of Ole's passing. Though I did not know him well, on the several occasions we met, it was a pleasure to be with him. I especially recall fondly spending an afternoon discussing Dignaaga and apoha with Ole at a cafe on the shore of Lac Leman, following a delightful conference on the topic of Apoha organized by the Tom Tillemans and Mark Siderits. I learned much from our conversation, as well as from various of his articles.

It is my sad duty to inform the list that Ole Holton Pind passed away on 13 December this year after a long illness. Funeral for those who can make it will take place at Lyngby Kirke on Friday the 21st of December at 13.00.
Ole was the editor of the Critical Pali Dictionary for many years and contributor of books and papers on Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist literature.
He was an accomplished violinist and a genuinely fine person in all respects.
