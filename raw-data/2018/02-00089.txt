Subject: [INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY mailman migration
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeKr+HzVXDs0RwQeSezEgEfR1vVzSxo3abWWqrrqva9-Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have been informed by the company that hosts our INDOLOGY mail server
that the server software is being migrated later this week to a new cloud
platform.

This should be transparent to all users; you need do nothing, and service
will continue unchanged.  However, there may be an INDOLOGY forum outage
for an hour or two this week, while I am reconfiguring some technical
details of the mailman host.

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk

INDOLOGY committee member.
