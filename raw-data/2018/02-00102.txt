Dear colleagues,

I'm writing in the hope that someone might be able to share with me a pdf
of either or both of the following articles by H. W. Bodewitz, both from
1996:

"Redeath and its relation to rebirth and release", *Studien zur Indologie
und Iranistik* 20: 27-46.

"The pa?c?gnividy? and the pit?y?na/devay?na", in A.K. Goswami & D. Chutia
(eds) *Studies on Indology*, Delhi: 51-57.


Many thanks in advance!

Robert
