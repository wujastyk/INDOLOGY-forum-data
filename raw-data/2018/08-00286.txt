Continuing my Krishna verses:

??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???? ?
?? ??????? ???? ???????? ???? ??? ???????
Once I was asleep at night and the world around me was silent. Then these
words of Krishna reached my ears.

?????? ?????????? -
Krishna said to me.
[Partly inspired by James Dillet Freeman?s 1947 poem ?I am there,? taken to
the moon by astronaut James B. Irwin on Apollo 15]

?? ?????????????? ????? ???: ??? ?
??????? ?? ??????? ???????? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????
Don?t be afraid. Its Me, your best friend. O friend, I want to tell you
something. Listen.

??????? ????? ?? ???????? ?? ???????? ?
?????????? ?? ?????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?? ???????
If you want my help, I am near you. Don?t go elsewhere to search for me.
Tell me what is bothering you.

????????? ?? ?????? ???? ???? ??? ?? ??????? ?
???????? ?????? ????? ??????????? ???? ???????
O friend, my devotee, your are dear to me. Remember me as your helper. O
friend, how shall I not come quickly for you?
