Subject: [INDOLOGY] A regressive face of Indology at the World Sanskrit Conference

All:
	While this may be new to the Indology forum and the WSC, similar issues have plagued the Religion in South Asia (RISA) section of the American Academy of Religion since the mid 1990s. Scholars and non-scholars, insiders and outsiders, adhikarin and anadhikarin behaved poorly and poisoned what was a relatively good, congenial, and fruitful samvada. Alas.

	By way of the Doniger affair, some may find this short piece that I wrote in 2014 to be provocative and germane.

I hope that Indology, also a relatively good, congenial, and fruitful samvada is not spoiled, as was RISA and its E-list counterpart, RISA-L.

respectfully,

Deepak

As Professor Vajpeyi describes, the reception of the public forum at the 17th World Sanskrit Conference in Vancouver was an appalling display of unprofessionalism, misogyny, and class privilege, a "regressive face of Indology." My friends - We need to ask ourselves some tough questions about what sorts of prejudices and behaviours we are tolerating and harboring in our corner of the scholarly world. We tend to be quite good at exercising a critical gaze when it comes to mimamsa, kavya, and so forth. I hope we can do the same with ourselves.
