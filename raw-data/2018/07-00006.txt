You may want to take a look at K.T. Achaya: A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food. Oxford 1998 which has various glossaries, in Indian languages, including one of the Latin names and also Achaya's Companion ? do not have the volume on hand at the moment. The Companion has a lot about grains, etc.

A cookbook approx from the 17th century called P?kaprakara?a, translated into German by grad student under the guidance of Professor W. Rau.
