Dear all,

I am happy to report that *Text and Tradition in Early Modern North India*
<https://india.oup.com/product/text-and-tradition-in-early-modern-north-india-9780199478866?>,
a collection of 21 essays by scholars of Sanskrit, Persian, Bengali, Urdu,
Hindi, and Gujarati, and covering the disciplines of philology, history,
religion, and literary studies is finally available from Oxford University
Press (India) <https://india.oup.com/>. In it we have attempted to draw
together current research on numerous sectarian, intellectual, and literary
traditions in multiple languages and regions, in order to draw connections
between them and give a sense of the period as a whole in the northern part
of the Subcontinent.

I have included below the table of contents for those interested in reading
more.

All best,

Tyler Williams
