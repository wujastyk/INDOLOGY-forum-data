 Look at the Index Translationum, which goes back to 1932, but was later taken over by UNESCO. There is a Wikipedia article about it.? The onine version is available at?http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/, but from a few searches it seems to only cover titles published from around 1970 on, implying the earlier issues have not been fully digitized.? At least some earlier volumes are available on Google Books; one might search other digitization programs such as Hathi Trust for them.? There was a compilation from the earlier years entitled Index Translationum Indicarum?https://lccn.loc.gov/sa65004476.?
Good luck,

Hello,
Do not you know perchance where to find a list of European fiction works already translated into Sanskrit? I'd be very grateful for any tip.
Regards,
Julian Brescanu
