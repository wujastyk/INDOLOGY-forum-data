Dear Prof. Hegewald,

Since the EAAA website doesn't answer the question, could you perhaps let us know what, if any, is the relationship between this association and the one which organizes the SAA conferences (and its sister, the EURASEAA, which until recently still organized conferences on Southeast Asian Archaeology)?

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
EFEO
