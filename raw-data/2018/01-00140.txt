Dear Dhammadinna,


Could this be relevant?


Singh, Upinder. 2010. ?Exile and Return: The Reinvention of Buddhism and Buddhist Sites in Modern India.? South Asian Studies 26 (2):193?217. https://doi.org/10.1080/02666030.2010.514744.


I am trying to attach the pdf (2.8 MB), hope it comes through.


Best wishes,


Arlo Griffiths

Dear Friends and Colleagues,
does anyone have access to archival information or secondary sources on the history of the establishment, inauguration and historical use of the uposathagara/sima of the Sarnath centre of the Maha Bodhi Society?
Images (including contemporary) would also be most welcome.
With thanks in advance and all best wishes,
Dhammadinna
