Dear friends,
?
?Several of you have written to me on- and off- list in response to my
inadvertent post.  I am grateful for your words.  But please keep posts
off-list, if possible.  Jonathan is right, that it's important to keep our
INDOLOGY conversations as a-political as possible, otherwise it will
descend into flaming, and we'll all want to leave (as happened before).

Thanks!
Dominik
