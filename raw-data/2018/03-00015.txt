Subject: [INDOLOGY] Cataloguing South Asian materials for non-librarians?
Message-ID: <CANA44t2rUpnBJBKTAXS5_VPdNAegwZqVRuosCK-qve97mXXKZg@mail.gmail.com>

I've been asked to give a 15 to 20 minute talk about cataloguing
Indian and Tibetan materials (including manuscripts) to a group of
scholars who have no prior knowledge of cataloguing, and to prepare a
packet of handouts.

Can anybody recommend any particularly good articles that would be
suitable? And what do you think I should be sure to tell them (and to
leave out)?

Thanks,

Edward
