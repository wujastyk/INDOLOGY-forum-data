Subject: [INDOLOGY] The universe as an image in a mirror
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFjpK9wvy6f4Jmr2e0NBQJa7UWaSS7r83+u23EQLdZx1g@mail.gmail.com>

The first verse of the Dak?in?m?rtistotram is:

vi?va? darpa?a-d??yam?na-nagar?-tulya? nij?ntar-gata?

pa?yann-?tmani m?yay? bahir ivodbhuta? yath? nidray?

ya? s?k??t kurute prabodha-samaye sv?tmanam ev?dvaya?

tasmai ?ri-guru-m?rtaye nama ida? ?ri-dak?in?m?rtaye


One of the reasons Amarhath Rai in his article "The Daksinamurti Hymn and
the Manasollasa published in Vol. 6 of The Journal of Oriental Research,
Madras, 1932 gives for rejecting Sankaracarya as the author is  the
metaphor in the first verse of the world as an image in a mirror.

Does  this metaphor of the world as an image in a mirror only appear in
Kashmir Shaivite writings or does it occur in  the writings of other
religous or philosophical schools.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
