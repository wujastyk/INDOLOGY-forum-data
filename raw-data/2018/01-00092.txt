Dear list members,

Does anyone have:a pdf of the article
"The pronunciation of Sanskrit"  in K. B. Pathak Commemorative volume
edited by S.K. Belvalkar, 333-349 Pune: Bandarkar Oriental Research
Institute. 1934

Note:  There are two articles by S.K. Chaterji with this title. this one
from 1934 I'm looking for and a second completely different article (with
same title) hatterji, Suniti Kumar. 1960. ?The Pronunciation of
Sanskrit?. *Indian
Linguistics* 21, 61?82. which has just been sent to me.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
