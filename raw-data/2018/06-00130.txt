Dear Heiner,

It may be that you got only text images rather than searchable text of the
?vet?mbara Jain canonical texts for one or two reasons. On my computer, I
had to click "enable editing" to make the .docx Word file searchable. The
PDF file of the same text was searchable upon opening. The other
possibility is downloading the wrong file. As Royce said, the Jain eLibrary
site is a bit complex, because they have so many texts. The searchable
files are the serial numbers 003701-003789 (only odd numbers).

No doubt the C?r?is are more important than the Sanskrit commentaries,
because they are older. But aside from the fact that we only have C?r?is on
some of the canonical texts, the very fact that they are in Prakrit like
the canonical texts presents the same accessibility problems. Already a
thousand years ago Jain writers such as Abhayadeva-s?ri felt the need to
write Sanskrit commentaries on the Prakrit canonical texts to make them
more accessible.

You are right that the available C?r?is are not included in
?nandas?gara/S?gar?nanda's editions. However, Muni D?paratnas?gara's
2000 *?gama
Sutt??i (sa??ka?)* in 30 volumes includes Jinad?sa Mahattara's C?r?i
on the Ni??tha-cheda-s?tram
(vols. 15-17), Jinad?sa Mahattara's C?r?i on the Da???rutaskandha-cheda-s?tram
(in vol. 23), and Siddhasenaga?i's C?r?i on the J?takalpa-cheda-s?tram
(also in vol. 23). Jinad?sa Mahattara's C?r?i on the Anuyogadv?ra-s?tram
was included in the critical edition of the Anuyogadv?ras?tram prepared by
Muni Jamb?vijaya and published in 2 parts as volume 18 of the
Jaina-?gama-Series,
1999 and 2000. Jinad?sa Mahattara's C?r?i on the Nand?-s?tram was included
in Muni Punyavijaya's 1966 edition of the Nand?sutta? published as volume 9
of the Prakrit Text Society Series. ?nandas?gara/S?gar?nanda's edition of
Jinad?sa Mahattara's C?r?i on the ?va?yaka-s?tram was not published by
the ?gamodaya
Samiti, and I do not know of a newer edition than his 1928-1929 one in two
volumes.
