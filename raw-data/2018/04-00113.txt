>From Manusmrti (Laws of Manu) Chapter III

20. Now listen to the brief description of the following eight
marriage-rites used by the four castes (varna) which partly secure benefits
and partly produce evil both in this life and after death.



21. They are the rite of Brahmana (Brahma), that of the gods (Daiva), that
of the Rishis (Arsha), that of Prajapati (Prajapatya), that of the Asuras
(Asura), that of the Gandharvas (Gandharva), that of the Rakshasas
(Rakshasa), and that of the Pisakas (Paisaka).



22. Which is lawful for each caste (varna) and which are the virtues or
faults of each (rite), all this I will declare to you, as well as their
good and evil results with respect to the offspring.



23.One may know that the first six according to the order (followed above)
are lawful for a Brahmana, the four last for a Kshatriya, and the same
four, excepting the Rakshasa rite, for a Vaisya and a Sudra.



24. The sages state that the first four are approved (in the case) of a
Brahmana, one, the Rakshasa rite in the case of a Kshatriya, and the Asura
(marriage in that) of a Vaisya and of a Sudra.



25. But in these institutes of the sacred law, three of the five (last) are
declared to be lawful and two unlawful; *the Paisaka and the Asura rites
must never be used.*



26. For Kshatriyas those before mentioned two rites, the Gandharva and the
Rakshasa, whether separate or mixed, are permitted by the sacred tradition.
