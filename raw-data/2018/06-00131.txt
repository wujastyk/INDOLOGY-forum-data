Dear all,

I?m interested in the compound word bh?gola (and related terms, such as bhuvo golam, dhar?gola, mah?gola, etc.). The word gola means ?ball? or ?globe,? and the compound word bh?gola means ?the earth?s sphere.?

The compound word bh?gola is used in the sense of ?earth-sphere,? ?the earth?s sphere? in astronomical texts since at least the ?ryabha??ya (composed in 499 CE).

I?m looking for uses of this compound word in texts and contexts other than the astronomical tradition of India. So far I?m aware of these instances:

(1) The compound word bh?gola occurs in the some pur??as. The Bh?gavatapur??a uses it five times; the Narasi?hapur??a uses it twice; and the Brahm???apur??a uses the equivalent term mah?gola once.

(2) Four philosophical texts use the compound word:
  (a) Mok?opaya (10th century) has dhar?gola and bh?gola (Roland Steiner kindly helped me with the references from this work)
  (b) Tattvacint?ma?i (12th century)
  (c) Ny?yasudh? (14th century)
  (d) Sa?khyas?travivara?a (a late commentary)

(3) The Gop?lat?panyupani?ad (13th century or later) uses the compound word bh?golacakra.

(4) The G?tagovinda (12th century) uses the compound word once.

(5) The Hariva??a uses it in one verse (a star-verse).

(6) Some Bengal Vai??ava works use the compound word; for example, the Gop?lacamp? of J?va Gosv?min (16th century) uses bh?migola once; R?pa Gosv?min (16th century) uses the compound word as well.

Does any of you know of other instances of the compound word bh?gola outside of the astronomical tradition? I?d greatly appreciate learning of instances I?ve missed.

Many thanks in advance.

With all best wishes,
Toke
