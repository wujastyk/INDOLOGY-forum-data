Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on Sarasvati as a masculine title
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdDUvQ=E82Je3tQ6dROCTjqr_SDQLkDfTPjqtHOqVVmGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

     This morning I came across this book, where the author's name is given
as ?????????????????????, where the word "sarasvati" occurs with a short
"i".  This "sarasvat?", as well as "Bh?rat?" is added in the title of many
Sannyasins.  Sometimes I see the titles with a long "?", and here is an
instance of a short "i".  I am wondering as to what is the common practice
and the grammar of that practice, especially since normally feminine
expressions are being used in male titles.  Any suggestions?
