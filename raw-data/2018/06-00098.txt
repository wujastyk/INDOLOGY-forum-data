Dear Johannes,

thanks for this, of course I know all the papers from this conference, including this yours. It deals with the fundamental problem whether we should understand the teaching of classical S??khya more as a cosmogony or individual anthropogony. Preferably both, but then serious inconsistencies would arise.

I understand that in the light of this crucial question my problem with the all-pervasive puru?a is a minor one, but not being a S??khya specialist, I might overlook something important, so that is why I put my question to this forum.

All the best,
Lubomir

Sure, it might reflect some older teaching that survived outside the S??khya mainstream. But the question whether each puru?a is all-pervasive all the time or only when liberated seems to me rather crucial. All commentaries apparently take it for granted that puru?as are all-pervasive all the time, only Jayama?gal? for some reason distinguishes between liberated and non-liberated puru?a. This puzzles me.

I cannot answer the question of my students how could puru?a (who is absolutely passive etc.) change itself so dramatically? And where does this concept occur in classical S??khya? Could you please help me with these answers? I am not a specialist in S??khya, we have this seminar just for fun, so I probably missed something in S??khya teaching on puru?a. I promised to my students that I will ask this learned forum to get the right answers.
