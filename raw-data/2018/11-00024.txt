It is curious that the Spanish, French and Chinese offer translations of the title, while the Russian, both arabic-persian script attempts (with slight differences), and the devanagari offer transcriptions of the English title ? privileging the English, which is also graphically lifted above the rest, as if the other languages were incapable of expressing the idea ?statue of unity.? How British.

The terrible rendering in Tamil became widely ridiculed on the Web. Some wondered if it was a photoshopped joke. But BBC Tamil <https://www.bbc.com/tamil/india-46054914> has confirmed that it is true and shows a picture with attempted erasure of the Tamil version after the problem was brought to the attention of the authorities. The designer of the plaque was Larsen & Toubro. Can other language experts comment on the other versions on the plaque?
