Dear Madhav,
I second Matthew?s sentiments. I have long admired Dr. Jaini?s work and was grateful for his attendance at and wise commentary following a guest lecture I gave at Berkeley in a ?few months ago. Thank you for sharing this!
All the best,Jeffery Long

Thanks for this, Madhav.
I was fortunate to be a student at Berkeley when Jaini arrived in 72 and have always continued to learn from his extraordinary scholarship. A revered guru!

Best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Professor Jaini's 95th birthday?I was so fortunate to attend Professor Padmanabh Jaini's 95th birthday celebration yesterday at the University of California in Berkeley. In 1972, Jaini left Michigan for Berkeley, and I became his replacement in Michigan. He is a giant in the fields of Buddhist and Jain Studies, and it was wonderful to see the love of his students and colleagues for him.
