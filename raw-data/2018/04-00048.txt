Hi all,

I?m looking for an ?gama text entitled Siddh?nta?ekhara (not the jyotis text of that name composed by ?r?pati). In Wayne Edward Surdam?s doctoral dissertation (UC Berkely, 1984), ?South Indian ?aiva Rites Of Initiation: The D?k??vidhi of Aghora?iv?c?rya?s Kriy?kramodyotik???

Available here:

https://archive.org/stream/SouthIndianSaivaRitesOfInitiationDikshaVidhiOfAghoraShivacharyasKriyakramadyotik/South%20Indian%20Saiva%20Rites%20of%20Initiation%20Diksha%20Vidhi%20of%20Aghora%20Shivacharyas%20Kriyakramadyotika%20Wayne%20Edward%20Surdam%20%28Thesis%29#page/n5/mode/2up

?I found the following entry in the bibliography of primary sources:

Siddh?nta?ekhara, by Vi?van?tha,
Manomanigrantham?l? no.20, Bangalore, 1971.

This might be the text I?m seeking. However, I can?t flocate the book nor can I find any further information Manomanigrantham?l? book series.

Does anyone know about this series? Maybe about this particular publication?

Of course, any information on the Siddh?nta?ekhara (the ?gama text) would be greatly appreciated.

All best wishes,
Toke
