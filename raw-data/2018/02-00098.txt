To All,&nbsp;I am grateful to Prof. Van Bijlert for helping me with the publisher's name for the book IshaBashyaUpanishad'. I accessed the publisher I.e.Vivek Hamsa Prakasana,Bangalore for the book.However ,at present it is &nbsp;out of stock.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In such an eventuality &nbsp;, &nbsp; &nbsp;Can anybody kindly help me with a PDF copy of IshaBashyaUpanishad' by Swami TyagishaAnanda,If at all available?.
&nbsp; &nbsp;Alakendu Das&nbsp;
