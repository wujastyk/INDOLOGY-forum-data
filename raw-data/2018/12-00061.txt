Subject: [INDOLOGY] Krishna and the Cat
Message-ID: <CAB3-dze_zWJgHaY7G+p1vDtSkb+854z5Z-2bdC=GhfwEJnFLmA@mail.gmail.com>

Archana Venkatesan posted a beautiful photo of a cat on the procession
palanquin of Nanguneri Perumal. I composed a few verses describing the
friendship of the cat and Krishna.

This dark cat sits next to Krishna. They are both dark, and so their mutual
affection is natural.
???????? ????????? ?????: ???????? ??: ?

With Krishna's association, the cat turned into Krishna, and with the
association of the cat, Krishna became the cat.
???????????????? ?????? ???: ?????? ?

There is no difference whatsoever between Krishna and the cat. These are
just two forms of Krishna in front of me.
