The question of the name ?Tolk?ppiyam? being related to ?k?vya' arises only if the name of the author, Tolk?ppiya?, is derived from his work. But that does not seem to be the case according to the p?yiram of the Tolk?ppiyam. According to the p?yiram of the Tolk?ppiyam, his name was Tolk?ppiya?. Since the p?yiram is supposed to be produced at the beginning of a text?s existence, it is unlikely, the author would be named after the grammar at that stage. Then the question has to be changed to whether he could have been named after some exemplary k?vya he had authored before producing his grammar. That seems unlikely also since the author is only praised for his knowledge of Aintiram, a possible grammatical text and not a k?vya. It is high time we give up relating the name ?Tolk?ppiyam' to k?vya.

On the other hand, the name k?ppiya? has been discussed in this list earlier as derived from a gotra name. See http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2009-April/127593.html. See attachment for SII 8, no. 196.
