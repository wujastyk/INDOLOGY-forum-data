Thanks to everybody who responded to my query on and off list. It has 
been most helpful and much appreciated.

For those of you who might be interested, Rolf Heinrich Koch pointed me 
to a footnote by Phyllis Granoff wherein she translates pa?han?rtha as 
"private study" and v?can?rtha as "public preaching" in the context of a 
colophon to a Jaina manuscript.

Best,
Jacob
