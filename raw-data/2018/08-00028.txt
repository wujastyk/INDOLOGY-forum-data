Perhaps you're thinking of this?

   - Goodall, Dominic, H. Isaacson, Ka?lida?sa, and Vallabhadeva. *The
   Raghupan?cika? of Vallabhadeva: being the earliest commentary on the
   Raghuvam?s?a of Ka?lida?sa*. Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2003.
   http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827241152

The volumes of the Clay Sanskrit Library are still very much within
copyright, so shouldn't be shared by PDF.  They are still easily and
cheaply acquired, e.g., from Amazon
<https://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=clay+sanskrit+library>
.

Best,
Dominik
