 Harunaga Isaacson has kindly informed me that Vimala Karnatak's critical
edition of the Yogasiddh?ntacandrika commentary by N?r?ya?at?rtha,
published in 2000, is available online. He provided these two links to it:

https://ia800808.us.archive.org/3/items/YogaSiddhantaChandrikaVimlaKarnatak/Yoga%20Siddhanta%20Chandrika%20-%20Vimla%20Karnatak.pdf

https://ia800107.us.archive.org/19/items/YogaSiddhantaChandrikaNaryanaTirthaVimalaKarnatakChowkambha/Yoga%20Siddhanta%20Chandrika%20Naryana%20Tirtha%20%20Vimala%20Karnatak%20Chowkambha.pdf

Sri Shankara provided a link to Sukhlalji's 1922 edition of Ya?ovijaya's
Yogas?tra commentary. He pointed out that this v?tti covers only 27 of the
195 s?tras. He reports that Sukhlalji Sanghvi, who edited the book, says in
his preface that the v?ttik?ra's intention was to show on which points
Jaina Siddh?nta agreed or disagreed with the Vy?sabh??ya.

Since the Yogas?tra is a text of widespread interest, I post these links
here. Thank you to Harunaga Isaacson and Sri Shankara.
