Dear Artur,



I see several problems with your argument.

>> quite unknown to the earlier strata of the epic.

How are you identifying the ?earlier strata? of the epic? If you argue, the
earlier strata are the ones that do not report polyandrous marriage, the
argument is circular.



>>To my mind ? a bit of cultural politics, at work. Surrounding inclusions
of new economically important tribal territories in the realm of the
'Aryas'.

Do you have evidence for thinking polyandry is non-Aryan? German
Indologists claimed the P???avas were non-Aryan (see *The Nay Science*,
123); Fitzgerald rehashes this theory (ibid., 151). But for the argument to
work, the P???avas must be originally non-Aryan, whereas, for the
attempted cultural assimilation to hold, they must be Aryans in the MBh,
but the reason for positing a discrepancy between the text and ?historical?
reality is their polyandry, which is non-Aryan, but this was the very point
in contention.... I am sure you appreciate the circularity.



>>The need to show to its fresh members that they do belong ? despite some
of their outlandish customs.

If the point was to suggest ?that they do belong,? surely it is better to
retain them in the text rather than ?whitefacing? them. Indeed, if the
point was to show that, though non-Aryan, on consideration polyandry is
acceptable, there was no need to make the P???avas ?Aryas.? I think the
problem arises from your vacillation between the MBh?s use of the term and
a racial sense (which you wrongly identify with the ?historical? meaning),
and the circumstance that you use the former as evidence for the latter.



>>The need to demonstrate that we, the 'Aryas', also share them - the
example of one of them, of polyandrous union, is certainly to be found in
our great epic. And, considering the status of its participants, it is
given a properly high prestige.

But *what* epic? In what text was this change made? Presumably, it was made
in the exemplar or exemplars destined for dissemination in ?tribal
territories,? since the claim was for their appeasement. How, then, do you
explain its occurrence in the manuscripts found today? Do you suppose that
the exemplars in the Aryan territories ceased to be copied and control of
the tradition passed to ?tribal territories??



>>is certainly to be found in our great epic.

Non-Aryan tribes could hardly know of the MBh as ?our great epic,? since
this was their first encounter with it. (If it was not, the argument
doesn?t work, since they then know a version exists without polyandry.) The
argument thus requires them both to know and not know of the MBh. Perhaps
you mean the MBh?s fame preceded it such that the tribes could appreciate
the favor done them? But they could only appreciate the favor done them if
they knew that polyandry was not normally accepted among ?Aryans.? The
argument is self-defeating.



Moreover, scholars have worked the argument both ways?certain sexual or
social practices were commonplace among the ?Aryans?; it is not the
practice that was inserted into the text but its posterior justification.
The only criterion appears to be what the scholar wishes to attribute (or
not see attributed) to his ?Aryans??constructed, of course, entirely from
his fantasy self-image. Winternitz?s comment is apt: ?Mr. Dahlmann says
that the custom is ?un-Aryan? (p. 90). But who can tell whether the
P???avas were Aryans or non-Aryans? Besides, what right have we to describe
everything we do not like as ?un-Aryan??? (?Notes on the Mah?bh?rata,?
756). I recommend revisiting his article and also *The Nay Science*,
chapters 1?2.



Three final points: (1) You appear to be working on a model of donor-donee
cultures, which has its origins in Friedrich Schlegel?s work, and was
clearly not just racial but *racist *in intent. Vast amounts of time and
ingenuity have been expended on figuring out what proportion of Indian
culture can be attributed to ?Aryan? influence (Oldenberg, Frauwallner,
etc.). Perhaps we should move beyond it. (2) Cultural interactions are more
complex than our models assume. Even in the most recent ?Aryan? aggression
(for which we also happen to have reliable historical data), the situation
was more complex, as this article explains:
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/poland-holocaust-death-camps/552455/.
(3) Ever since Christian Lassen, it has been customary for Indologists to
identify racial explanations with the ?real,? ?historical? meaning of the
text. In truth, these pseudohistorical explanations clarify nothing. They
only attest to our penchant for privileging racial explanations over other
kinds of explanation (literary, aesthetic, philosophical, psychoanalytic,
etc.). Here also, we should ask why we think we have understood a text when
we have converted it from one set of symbols (its own) into another (our
own). We should ask why race is the fiction that in our time we grant
immediate reality such that when we have identified MBh characters with
tribes or communities, we think we know what *really *happened or the
*real *underlying event that was blown up into ?mythic? proportions. (From
this also arises the notion that Indians lack a historical sense; what we
really mean is that they don?t possess history in our specific sense of a
racial narrative.) This also applies to Indian scholars such as Irawati
Karve, for whom the ?myth? of the burning of the Kh???ava Forest is
?really? about Aryan invasion and land-clearing. Incidentally, Irawati
Karve received her PhD under the infamous Eugen Fischer of the
*Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut
f?r Anthropologie, menschliche Erblehre und Eugenik *so these connections
of how racial discourse entered South Asian studies can be quite easily
traced.
