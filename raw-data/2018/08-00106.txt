Subject: [INDOLOGY] Resources for commentarial interpretations of particles
In-Reply-To: <B9BFD17A-272B-4973-BE5C-C975FB24D4BE@austin.utexas.edu>
Message-ID: <32062fc4-8804-db1c-c793-1e04139239ea@mcgill.ca>

The article by Emeneau, entitled "Sanskrit syntactic particles --- 
khalu, khila and nuunam", appeared, if I recall correctly, in JOAS in 1969.

I don't recall where Joel's article appeared.
