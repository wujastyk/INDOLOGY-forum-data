Subject: [INDOLOGY] expert on Ramatankas alias temple tokens?

I have four temple tokens which I bought some years ago which the last time I checked were unpublished.? Is there anyone on the list or known to anyone on the list who is an expert or keeps up on the subject, so that I could send them images so that if they were already published they could tell me and save me the effort of going through the literature published since the last time I looked?? If they are unpublished I would publish them in one of the journals of Indian numismatics.
Thanks,
Allen
