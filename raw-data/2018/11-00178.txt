Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Buddha's body in a vat of oil

However.... there is for example an expression in a Gandhari
Mahaparinirvana fragment (SC 2179/44a recto): aya?sa droni telena, which
pretty much seems to imply (fill) an iron barrel with oil.
This and some other passages are discussed in my Body Language booklet.
