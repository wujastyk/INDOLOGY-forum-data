Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have a soft copy of the Pancaratra text Vasisthasamhita? I  
believe that I have seen a mention of it having been published in  
three volumes from somewhere (Varendra Research Institute?), but  
somehow I cannot find the reference now. I would be most thankful for  
any help.

Sincerely yours,
M?ns
