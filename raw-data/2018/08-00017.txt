Bhart?hari?s V?kyapad?ya 1.124 makes that claim:

?abdasya pari??mo ?yam ity ?mn?yavido vidu?/ chandobhya eva prathamam etad vi?vam pravartate//

Dear list,

I am currently writing a piece discussing the question of 'How old is Sanskrit?' for a general audience.

To shed some light on the origins of the popular claim that Sanskrit is the 'oldest language', I am trying to find the exact passage(s) in which it is mentioned that the universe was sung into existence through Sanskrit. Could anyone help me with specific textual references?

Many thanks,
    Antonia
