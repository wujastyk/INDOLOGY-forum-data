There is no word for 'bushy' in the verse.

But  in gopucchAgraM , agram is the qualified, the topic, the focus.

For some one feeling the touch of the cow's tail from its root/beginning,
the end is a sudden change, hence a surprise.

Similarly in a kAvya, after the description of udAtta bhAvas, description
of adbhuta gives a sudden change, a surprise.

Giving details of the surprising part of the cow's tail as 'bushy' is just
for adding details, for explanation/elaboration.
