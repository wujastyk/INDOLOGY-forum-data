This "sarasvat?", as well as "Bh?rat?" is added in the title of many Sannyasins.  Sometimes I see the titles with a long "?", and here is an instance of a short "i".  I am wondering as to what is the common practice and the grammar of that practice, especially since normally feminine expressions are being used in male titles.  Any suggestions?
