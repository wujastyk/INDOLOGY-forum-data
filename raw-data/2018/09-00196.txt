Apologies for the continuing messages. A little further digging reveals another book in which he took part, for which he edited the second edition - History of Greece, Macedonia and Syria (London: 1852):

In a list of publications by the same publisher at the front of the book, Pococke is mentioned as a co-author of a book titled A History of Greek Literature.
