Dear Prof Krishnaprasad,

This evolution of your font is super to observe.

Madhav voted against the matra-gaps; I voted for them.  It's a hard choice,
but if you are really going for the look-and-feel of the NS fonts, then it
has to be admitted that they had such matra-gaps and that it's a key
feature of the NS fonts.  When viewing a page of writing from a normal
reading distance of 18" or so, these gaps are not really noticeable, but
subliminally - for me - they aid rapid, accurate reading.  I assume they go
back to scribal practice, where gaps between aksaras are normal.  I don't
know when the continuous matra line came into fashion.  Alessandro has made
an implicit argument for such a matra-gap, which is a feature of the
original font that he created for his 2015 Jayanta book
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hj9zv2>:

Regarding the multiple forms of da etc., modern font technology can help.
OpenType includes some "alternates" or "contextual alternates" features
that allow the user (or auto-select) to select from multiple versions of a
glyph.  But I'm sure you know this.  And it's only certain advanced
text-setting programs like TeX that allow one to access such features
easily (e.g., through fontspec <https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec?lang=en>,
manual part IV).

Such questions make me wish to consult Naik's classic work *Typography of
Devanagari <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6241715>* (3 vols, 1971 rev. ed.),
but I've never had access to a copy of this rare publication.

Best,
Dominik

Best,
Dominik
