Dear Friends,

Here are some more of my Krishna verses:

???????? ???????? ??????????????? ??: ?

?????? ??????????? ????? ?????? ??? ???????

On the large stage of this world, there is no other actor than Kr???a.
Assuming
many forms, he always acts out a play.


??????? ????? ????????? ???? ??????? ?? ??????? ?

?????? ??? ?????????? ????? ??????? ???: ???????

Sometimes Kr???a becomes R?dh?, and sometimes R?dh? becomes Kr???a.  Even
though he is really one, he becomes two and shows his plays.


?????? ?????? ? ????? ????? ???????????? ?

?????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ???????

Having become Vy?sa, he himself composed the Mah?bh?rata, and having become
Arjuna he questioned Kr???a.


???????? ????????? ????? ?????: ????????????? ??? ?

????????????  ??????????? ????????????????? ???????

Having asked the questions himself, Kr???a himself answered them.  He
performed this play on Kuruk?etra to cleanse the heart of the world.


???????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ?

??????????? ????? ??????? ???????? ???????

Having watched your beautiful dance subduing the K?liya snake in the water
of Yamun?, Yamuna herself broke out in waves.


??????? ?????????? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ?

????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????: ???????

Dancing on the stage of Gokula, you were not pleased by being alone.
Therefore,
you produced playful forms on all sides.


??????????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ?

????????? ????? ? ????????????????? ???????

O Kr???a, you yourself are the milkman, and the milkmaid is none other than
you.  [Your parents] Nanda and Ya?od? are also you, and so is the entire
Gokula.


??????????????? ?????? ????????? ?

??? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????

The birth of the unborn highest Lord is only a [playful] illusion.  Just as
it is yours, so the distinctness of your specks [is also illusory].


??????? ??? ????? ??????? ????????? ?

??? ????? ??? ?????????????????? ???:???????  ???????

Though they are not truly different from you, your friends appear to be
different.  O Kr???a, how do we recognize you standing in front, when you
are not different [from us].


?????????????? ??????: ?????????: ?

?????????????? ?????????? ???????????????????: ???????

As if not knowing the non-difference, the milkmaids, tormented by your
separation, run around looking for you.  The are the lights on the path of
love.


?????: ????? ?????? ???????? ???????????? ?

??????????? ???? ????? ???? ??????? ???? ????1??

Enjoying your own play and forgetting that it is a play, O Kr???a, you are
tormented by separation from R?dh?.


????????????????? ???????????? ?? ?

????? ?????????? ??? ????: ???????? ???: ????2??

This very attractive play of yours is for the purpose of enlightening the
world, so that common people will be infused with love for you.


?????? ?????????? ?? ????????????????????? ?

??????? ????? ?????: ?????? ?????? ?????: ???????

Your dance on the stage of Gokula is a demonstration of love as devotion.  On
the battlefield [of Kuruk?etra] you exhorted Arjuna to do the needed duty.


????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ?

????????? ?????????? ?? ??????????????? ???????

The Yogins watching your dance on the bank of Yamun? want to become
milkmaids on account of your display of love.


?????????? ?? ????????? ?????????: ???????????: ?

?????????? ????? ???? ?????????? ??? ???????

Even after watching your Cosmic Form, the confused Arjuna took refuge at
your feet with love.


??????? ???? ????? ???? ??????????????? ?

?????? ????????? ?????? ????????????????: ???????

On the stage of the world, you destroy the demons who are opposed to
righteousness, and, promoting the wheel of righteousness, you protect the
righteous.


??????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ???? ?

????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ???????

We hear you teaching the essence of righteousness on the battlefield [of
Kuruk?etra], and using the [dialogue with] Arjuna as an occasion, you point
us in the right direction.


?????????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ?

??????? ????????????????, ??????? ????????? ???????

Your dance on the stage of K?liya?s head created fear for those enemies
whose hearts were filled with poison, and produced delight for the
good-minded people.


???????? ?? ????????? ??????? ???????? ?

?????? ?????????? ???????????? ???? ???????

O Kr???a, on your stage we are also made to dance by you holding the
strings.  We are the dancing toys.


?????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ?

??????? ??????? ????? ???????????? ???? ??????? ???????

In this game of play, you are always delighting.  However, O Lord, let
there be no confusion for us who are wandering on this stage.


????????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ?

?????????: ???? ??? ?? ???: ??????????????? ?? ???????

On the stage of this world, this drama of yours is continuously playing.  Are
we spectators, or actors, or are we your play dolls?


???????????????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?

???? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???? ?? ??????? ???????

Somehow or other, you yourself have involved us in your play, and you know
our strengths and weaknesses.


???????? ?????????? ?? ?? ????? ??????? ?

???????? ??? ???? ??????????????????: ???????

O Lord, whether we are wandering on your stage, or being made to wander
around, we don?t quite know, and, indeed, our minds are confused.


?????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ?

??????? ?????? ????? ???????? ???????? ???????

O Kr???a, you alone know the story of your play as you intend it.  For
those of us running around on your stage, our strings are in your hands.
