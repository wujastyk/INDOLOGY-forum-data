Dear colleagues (apologies for cross-posting),

I am very glad to announce the publication of the following volume in
honour of Professor Jens E. Braarvig on the occasion of his seventieth
birthday:


"Reading Slowly - A Festschrift for Jens E. Braarvig," edited by Lutz
Edzard, Jens W. Borgland and Ute H?sken (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag;
2018; ISBN 978-3-447-10964-2).


Although it contains contributions from a variety of fields, this book
contains much of interest to the members of the Indology list. The
publisher's website?where the volume may also be purchased (
https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/Reading_Slowly/title_4134.ahtml)?describes
the book as follows:


"*Reading Slowly* contains contributions from a variety of fields as
diverse as Buddhist Studies, Linguistics, Middle Eastern Studies, Indology,
East Asia Studies, Sinology, Classical Studies and Nordic Studies, all
focused in some way on the importance of philological scholarship for
understanding history, culture, religion, language and law. Although their
objects of study, source language(s), media, focus and research questions
are different, the essays in this volume are firmly bound together by the
philological method ?in the broadest sense of the term ?and the scholarship
of Jens E. Braarvig, whose vast scope of interest and knowledge is
reflected in the breadth of this Festschrift. With contributions dealing
directly with sources in languages such as Sanskrit, P?li, Tibetan,
Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Hurrian, Korean, Latin, Greek and Old Norse,
preserved on materials such as birch bark and paper manuscripts, clay
tablets, wood slabs, printed editions, and modern day street signs, this
volume is not only a homage to the breadth of Jens Braarvig's scholarship,
but also a demonstration of the importance of language proficiency and
philology for the humanities."

Sincerely,

Jens
