Almost certainly later than the material I was just referring to, there are of course many South Indian Temple ?gamas that contain material about Gaur?p?j? which would doubtless be relevant to the history of the worship of M?n?k??, but most such passages will not have been translated. An exception is the Raurav?gama, whose chapter 31 is about the installation and worship of Gaur?.  This has been translated into French:

Bruno Dagens and Marie-Luce Barazer-Billoret, trans. 2000. Le Raurav?gama: un trait? de rituel et de doctrine ?iva?tes.  2 Vols.  Publications du d?partement d?indologie No. 89.1 and 89.2. Pondicherry: Institut fran?ais de Pondich?ry, 2000.

The speciality of this song is that the song is full of allusions, and only the opening line is about the composer?s request. The song is in slow tempo, words are clearly enunciated. Sanskritists won?t have difficulty understanding the song.
