Dear Friends and Colleagues,
does anyone have access to archival information or secondary sources on the
history of the establishment, inauguration and historical use of the
uposathagara/sima of the Sarnath centre of the Maha Bodhi Society?
Images (including contemporary) would also be most welcome.
With thanks in advance and all best wishes,
Dhammadinna
