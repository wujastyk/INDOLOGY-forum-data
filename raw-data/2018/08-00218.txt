O Krishna, I see your footprints in all directions. I know that you are
near, and yet I do not see your face.

??????? ??????????? ?? ????? ??????? ?
????? ???????: ?????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??? ???????
In the soft words of children, O Krishna, there is your voice. In the dance
of the youth with young ladies is your own dance, O Krishna.

???????? ?????????? ?????? ???????: ?
??????????????? ????? ?? ?????? ???????
In the bowers in the woods, the tweeting of birds is the sound of your
flute. In the running of the deer in the forest is your own play.

In the feathers of peacocks, O Krishna, is your head-ornament. O Lord,
there is a reflection of yours in the eyes of the she-deer.

????? ??????? ????? ???????? ????? ???? ???? ???????
The blue color of the sky is a sign of your body, and how could there be
darkness in the clouds without you?
