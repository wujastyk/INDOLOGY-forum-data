Sorry for taken up this trend again, but I wish to acknowledge some interesting responses received *after* my last reply:

Jesse Kutson suggests (after Pollock) that camatk?ti in Dhv? might be an interpolation. Yes, in principle anything might be an interpolation. Only, apart from the mechanical inclusion into the text of a scribal gloss, a conscious interpolation should have a motivation. In the case at issue, ki? prayojanam?

Ashok Aklujkar corrects my Indhu- to Indu (of course, Ashok you are right...)

Madhav Deshpande points out that in Marathi, words related to Sanskrit camatk?ra have ?wonder? as their central meaning (along with other interesting shades). In fact, this would have been my second question: why practically in all modern Indic languages the words related to camatk?ra mean ?wonder, surprise, astonishment?, while it is not so with the Trika authors who introduced this word into philosophical-aesthetic terminology. Contrary to the communis opinio, I am convinced that the meaning of camatk?ra in all Utpaladeva-Abhinavagupta-K?emar?ja?s works has nothing (or at least very little) to do with ?wonder?.

Warm regards
Raffaele

I rather cling to the position of Kane, who after a lenghty discussion arrives at a later date (925-950). And even later, if we identify Prat?k?ra-Indhur?ja with the Indhur?ja who taught the Dhvany?loka to Abhinava.<
