And, Dominik, as already remarked by Christoph Emmrich, it?s guthi in Nev?r? and not gu?h? (as in Nep?l?). So you ?correction? in the Wikipedia article which refers to the Newar system is wrong, even though both terms stem from Skt. go??h?.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] go??h?


You may wish to look into the surviving, vestigial manifestation, in the form of the gu?h? of Newar society in Kathmandu. There is a Wikipedia article on the subject https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthi

(though it's misspelled there with a dental instead of retroflex consonant). But I imagine that the literature on Newar sociology and anthropology with have more - perhaps some of the others on the list can help with bibliography in that area.
