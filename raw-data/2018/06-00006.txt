Subject: [INDOLOGY] Etymology of Mukunda
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFSR=AEzmjz+HyeGPVvGBqaReF0OEzeORjFgKO4V+=13Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Can someone give the etymology of mukunda?

Is the information in Monier-Williams under "muku" a folk-etymology?
muku = mukti (a word formed to explain mukun-da as "giver of liberation")

Thanks,
Harry Spier
