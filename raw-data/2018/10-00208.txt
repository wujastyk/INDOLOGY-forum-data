Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question about manuscript ownership

Hi Clemency,

The photographs are the intellectual property of the researcher and can use
them as they see fit - unless the terms of sale of the manuscript to the
museum contained restraint of use clauses - which may or may not be legally
enforceable in an Indian court.

Kind regards,
Antonio
