The following article mentions the six verses of the ?gveda that have no Padap??ha (on p. 44):
Kashikar, C. G. (1951): "The problem of the ga?antas in the ?gveda-Padap??ha." Proceedings of the All-India Oriental Conference 13 (1946), 39-46.
Commenting on this, I wrote in 1981 (p. 87): "This is most easily explained by the assumption that these verses were not considered part of the ?gveda by ??kalya. It further shows that the final redactors did not hesitate to deviate from the composer of the Padap??ha in deciding what did, and what did not, belong to the ?gveda. (It is interesting to note that at least one hymn of the ?gveda (10.95) is known to have had fewer verses than at present at as late a date as that of the ?atapatha Br?hma?a. See Oldenberg, 1912: 303.)"
"The orthoepic diaskeuasis of the ?gveda and the date of P??ini." Indo-Iranian Journal 23 (1981), pp. 83-95.

RV 7.59.12 ?????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????????????????????? ?????????? does not have a Padap??ha.  This is not a repeated mantra in the RV Sa?hit?.  What might be the reason why this mantra does not have a Padap??ha?  Is it likely that there were a few post-Padap??ha additions to the RV Sa?hit??  Someone asked this question on another discussion group.
