Thank you, Dominik, for point us to a really thoughtful piece, coming at a timely moment for me personaly, as I embark upon a couple of translation projects. I especially appreciate this sentence, which I also firmly believe:

" To present an incoherent English text is a tacit assertion that the Sanskrit is incoherent.?



With gratitude,
Adheesh
