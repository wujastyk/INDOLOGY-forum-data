In Telugu, there are still many people with the family name of tup?ki
or tup?kula
(genitive of plural tup?ki). It is possible that someone in their family
was in-charge of pistols (at least they claim their ancestors were
in-charge of pistols). Furthermore, ce?ji kri??appa n?yakkar (??????
?????????? ????????) is referred in some Telugu texts are tup?kula r?ya?u.

makha is sacrifice, and makhi is referred to the sacrifier, and it is
definitely a title given to brahmins conducting sacrifices.

Regards,
Suresh.
