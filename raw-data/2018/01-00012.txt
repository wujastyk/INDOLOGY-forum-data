Dear All:

Want to bring to your attention a new book edited by me and Don Davis in the series ?The Oxford History of Hinduism?: ?Hindu Law: A New History of Dharma??stra.? We had a wonderful and long list of contributors.

Here is the OUP website, which also gives the table of contents that also lists the contributors of various chapters:

Here is the Amazon link. The Kindle version is available right now, but the hard copy version will be available on Feb 14.

With best wishes for the New Year,

Patrick Olivelle
