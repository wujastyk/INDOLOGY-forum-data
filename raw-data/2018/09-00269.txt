Dear Colleagues,

I am forwarding, for your reference, the announcement of a new scholarly publication series focusing epic and romance literature from antiquity to modernity and from all languages and cultures. I will be serving as a member of the editorial board of the series.. 
Do pass this along to your colleagues and advanced students and keep the series in mind for possible publications of your own.

Warmest good wishes to you all.

The flyer is attached below. Can you please share this news with both established and emerging scholars in your field and invite them to submit proposals? I hope you will also consider publishing your own work within the series.
