Subject: [INDOLOGY] Continuing M?dhava verses

Dear friends, here are more M?dhava verses this morning:


?????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ?

???? ?? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ??

Delight of the World, Son of Ya?od?, a Cowherd Child performing his plays, O M?dhava, your sweetness turns this whole world into Gokula.



???????????????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ?

?????? ???????? ???????????????????? ????? ??

O Shining Dark Blue Cloud with new water wandering in the sky of Gokula, assuming the form of M?dhava you produce immense delight, O reliever of suffering.



???? ?? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ?

????? ?? ???? ????? ???????? ????? ?????? ??

Your shade, destroying the scorching, pleases the world.  O Blue Cloud, wander slowly.  O Delight of the World, spread in all directions.



???? ?????????? ????? ????????????????? ?

?????? ????? ????????? ?????? ???? ??????? ??

O M?dhava, you crush the pride of Cupid with your own delicate beauty.  Again, assuming the form of Cupid you tease stealing hearts.



??? ?????? ? ????????????? ???? ?????? ????????? ?

???????????? ????????????????? ??????: ??

Not satisfied with stealing yoghurt, you steal everyone?s hearts.  You, the Great Thief, also stole the clothes of the milkmaids.



???????????????? ??????????? ???? ???????????? ?

????????? ?? ????? ??????? ??????? ??? ????????: ??

O Dweller on the bank of Yamun?, the water of Yamun? became darkened by your touch.  O Dark One, your darkness spreads everywhere.  What can we do?



??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ???? ????????? ?????? ?

???????????? ?????? ????????? ?? ????? ??????? ??

?Run, run, O M?dhava.  The angry R?dh? left the bower.  She waited for you for a long time.  Why did you cheat on her??



????? ????? ??????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ????????? ?

???? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ????? ??

?Wait, wait, O Dear-Eyed R?dh?, don?t run and don?t leave me.  O Compassionate One, My Refuge, please pardon my transgression.  I have come to your feet.?



???? ???? ????????? ?? ???? ????? ??? ???? ????? ?

????? ???? ????????? ??????: ??????????? ??

?Where you are, there I am.  I am you.  How can I go somewhere else?  O R?dh?, know me, M?dhava, to be always near you.?



??????? ??????? ???? ????????????? ????? ????????? ?

???????? ????? ??????? ???? ?????????? ??

O R?dh?, occasionally, for a short time I become distanced by some trees.  Please pardon that loss of view of mine.  I have not gone anywhere else.?
