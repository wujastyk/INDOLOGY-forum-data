Subject: [INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Message-ID: <4C293BD2-11EF-4AC9-8AC6-E517772297BE@gmail.com>

Greetings,

Does anyone know of recent philological and pharmacological studies on the identification of soma in the ?gveda with Amanita muscaria? I?m aware of older studies by Wasson, Ingalls, Doniger, etc. Any help appreciated.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
