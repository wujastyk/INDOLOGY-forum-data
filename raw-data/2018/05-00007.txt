Did we note that the two most important epics of the Indian nation,
Ramayana and Mahabharata have the offences of abducting a woman to force
her for marriage/sex and to disrobe a woman in full court respectively are
the key events leading to /contributing to the wars and in both cases the
offenders are punished with death ? In both cases the offenders are
confronted by the victims in an aggressive and bold language.
