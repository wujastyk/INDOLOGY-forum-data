Dear Professor DeshpandePranamaami.Yadaa tvam maam-pleased me and your views indicate your emotion influenced by both Advaita and Dvaita Philosophies.The same emotion resides in my mind too,this is why I experience divine pleasure and I then can't stop my tendency to express it.This is the moment in which supernormal state of mind inspires and? instigates you toGift us such a wonderful delight.Vande svabhaavam? Krisnasya? ?rupan chaapi manoharam.Gopikaanaam praanarupam sakhaayan chaapi maadhavam//Chintayaami kave bhuyah kripaasindhuh sa maadhavah./Kaarayed abhiraaman tu kadaa melanam aavayoh//Iti vishayaabhiliptamanasah akalpaniiya niichasya Girish Jhasharmanah//
