Friends,

Thanks to Frank Koehler for sending me a scan of the article. Thanks also to Vincent Eltschinger, Georges Pinault and Christophe Vielle for pointing out that the article is now available in L?Inde fondamentale, ed. by Charles Malamoud, Paris, Hermann, 1978, pp. 83-116 ? indeed easier to obtain than the original.

With best wishes,
Paolo

Friends,

Would anybody be willing to share a copy of Renou?s (with Silburn) seminal study ?Sur la notion de brahman?, Journal Asiatique 237 (1949)? The old collection has seemingly been digitised only until 1940, nor do local libraries have a hard copy of the volume.

Thank you,

Paolo Magnone
