>  I am not talking about historically locating literary texts.

Using historical research including epigraphy for the study of literary
works did not stop at historically locating literary texts. It lead to an
entire branch of literary criticism called historical criticism.

Particularly in the case of literatures of Indian languages, where the
prefatory/introductory parts provide a very big amount of historical data
such as the patron king, his dynasty etc., the data was correlated with the
epigraphic information where the king and his dynasty find mention and that
in turn lead to the study of the literary work in its historical context.
Marxist literary criticism has also been broadly historical criticism only.
