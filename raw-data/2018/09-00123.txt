Dear Jacob,

This is a common feature in colophons and is often found with genitives to indicate for whom the manuscript was copied. Scholars of Jainism would know better than I any particular connoted performance contexts, but in general this can mean for both study and recitation (at least in the case of non-Jain manuscripts).

Best,
TWW

I assume that the expressions indicate that the text/drawing in question was copied for purposes of study, and would be interested to know if they are conventionally used in colophons to indicate as much.
