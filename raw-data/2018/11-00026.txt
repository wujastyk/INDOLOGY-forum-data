The terrible rendering in Tamil became widely ridiculed on the Web. Some wondered if it was a photoshopped joke. But BBC Tamil has confirmed that it is true and shows a picture with attempted erasure of the Tamil version after the problem was brought to the attention of the authorities. The designer of the plaque was Larsen & Toubro. Can other language experts comment on the other versions on the plaque?
