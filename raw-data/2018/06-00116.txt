Thanks to Andrew for this clarification.

"Present stem" is one of those oddities of terminology that have been carried over from Latin 
and Greek; in this case perhaps from Latin, where the "present stem" contrasts with the 
"perfect stem". In our little book for people approaching Sanskrit from the point of view of 
linguistics, Sanskrit (Languages of the World: Materials series, 18, Muenchen: Lincom 
Europa 1995), the late Siew-Yue Killingley and I called it the "active stem", because all the 
forms using it (whether parasmaipada or Atmanepada) are unambiguously active, so it 
contrasts with the passive stem, which makes Atmanepada forms which are unambiguously 
passive. In the "aorist" (which we call immediate past), "perfect" (remote past) and "future" 
(predictive) Atmanepada forms can be active or passive.

There are real vaiyakaraas on the list, but for what it is worth, "thematic" and "athematic" in 
the usage of most European grammars simply mean "ending in -a" and "not ending in -a," 
which is captured in traditional Sanskrit grammar by "at" (see 7.2.80 and 81), or "adanta-" if 
you like to be more explicit, and "present stem" is a slightly more narrow version of the verbal 
stem to which sarvadhatuka affixes are added (more narrow because there are sarvadhatuka 
suffixes that wouldn't be considered part of the present system, like kha?s). I have to say, 
though, that I would also appreciate some information about whether this identification holds. 
Max M?ller translated ardhadhatuka and sarvadhatuka as "general or unmodified" tenses 
and "special or modified" tenses respectively.

    Hello McComas, 
    A glossary of grammatical Sanskrit terms is appended to the textbook in Robert 
    Goldman's Devavaiprave?sika starting on p. 403. They are in Sanskrit with a straight 
    English translation at times and other times they are just explained. If your colleague is 
    not very familiar with Sanskrit grammatical terms, it may not be easy always to find the 
    term as in the example of the present tense: vartamane la directs you to la on the 
    preceding page. Many of the translations/explanations terms are easily found by going 
    through the four ad half pages of the glossary. 

    Wishing good luck to your colleague's enterprise.

    Dear Friends

    A Cambodian colleague is translating Gonda's grammar of Sanskrit 
    into Khmer. She would like to use Sanskrit grammatical terms 
    where possible.

    She is asking for help with the following terms:

    present stem

    thematic and athematic verb classes

    If some kind person could respond to me, I'll forward the 
    information to her.

    With thanks in advance

    Yours

    McComas
