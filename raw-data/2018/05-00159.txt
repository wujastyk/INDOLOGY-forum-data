Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help identifying the deity of a gayatri mantra
In-Reply-To: <mailman.36.1527696002.8916.indology_list.indology.info@list.indology.info>
Message-ID: <06B196A9-1444-49C1-86C6-EDB9ECF2443D@columbia.edu>

While we?re at it, does anyone know of sources exploring the theoretical basis for or historical development of these ?gayatris?? 

For example, in what sense is the mantra below a ?gayatri? beyond containing the verbs dh?mahi and pracoday?t? Is there any relation postulated between the 'gayatris' of Kubera etc. and Gayatri as a goddess? 

 With thanks,
J.
