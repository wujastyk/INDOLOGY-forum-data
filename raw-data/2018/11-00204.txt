Dear List Members,


Please note that although this has been posted already, applications will in fact be reviewed starting January 4, 2019, not December 1, 2018 as is stated in the original call for applications. Apologies for any misunderstanding.


The South Asia Studies Department at the University of Pennsylvania invites applications for a full-time appointment as Lecturer in Sanskrit. The appointment will begin in August 2019 and includes teaching six courses per academic year. This appointment will be for one academic year with the possibility of annual renewal for up to an additional two years, contingent upon a satisfactory performance review and approval of the Dean.

The appointee will be expected to contribute to the long-term quality, stability and development of the Sanskrit program at Penn. Candidates must have research and teaching experience in Sanskrit. A PhD or near-PhD is strongly preferred. Preference will be given to candidates with proven creativity and pedagogical success in the design and delivery of courses, particularly at the elementary and intermediate levels of instruction.

Applications will be reviewed starting January 4, 2019 and will continue until the position is filled. Applications should be submitted on-line at http://facultysearches.provost.upenn.edu/postings/1506 and include a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, a statement of language pedagogy philosophy and experience, a statement of research interests, and the names and contact information of three individuals who will provide a letter of recommendation. Recommenders will be contacted by the University with instructions on how to submit a letter of recommendation to the website. Please direct all inquiries to Dr. Gregory Goulding, Chair of the Sanskrit Lecturer Search.
