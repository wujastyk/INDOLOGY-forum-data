Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit verse
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzcv-d9E-PQKJa2R8MN+TT2W4PVCD4wH2jYQn7V-rynKtA@mail.gmail.com>

Reading the beautiful Sanskrit poems of Shankar Rajaraman, I am inspired to
write a verse of my own:

????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ??? ????????? ?
?????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ??
"O Dullard, having attained M?dhava [Krishna, Lord], don't keep on running
[m? dh?va] after that. Having found the wish-fulfilling tree, what is the
purpose in going after the caster-oil shrub?
