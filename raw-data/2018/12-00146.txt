Subject: [INDOLOGY] How ancient DNA may rewrite prehistory in India
In-Reply-To: <88C42108-7975-443B-8AEE-CA5A414081BE@illinois.edu>

While this article is not directly related to rakhigarhi and issues around
OIT, etc, and sanskrit is only mentioned in passing amongst a broader
historical linguistic discussion, it contains a very interesting overview
regarding historical constructions in relation to unbiological  ideas of
race and language, and the vagueness of post facto translation.
