Subject: [INDOLOGY] AYUSH professorships
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cdgtd1yswe=KL=FPYqGi1G9uCqcuey-DkEOMCXO8fV=rA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

Does anyone in this forum work at a university where the Indian
Government's AYUSH ministry has provided a visiting professor in Yoga and
Ayurveda?  My university is beginning to negotiate an MoU about this with
AYUSH, and I am interested in how other universities approached the issues
of assessing professorial-level qualification in Yoga.  I would also be
interested in how other universities have managed the different possible
disciplinary approaches to Ayurveda, for example as a topic for
ethnopharmacological study through clinical trials, or as a topic for
historical, linguistic and philological study.  Similarly, a professor of
Yoga could be attached to a department of sport and physical education,
medicine, or indology.

If you have such an AYUSH program ongoing at your university, and have
thought about such issues, I would be grateful to hear from you, off-list
if you prefer.

Best,
Dominik
