About the book

*

This book is a complete annotated translation of a 9^th -century Tamil 
bhakti poetic work known as the /Perum?? Tirumo?i/, by Kulac?kara ??v?r, 
as well as of its medieval ?r?vai??ava commentary in Sanskrit-Tamil 
Ma?iprav??am by Periyav?cc?? Pi??ai (13^th c.). The /Perum?? Tirumo?i 
/is now part of the Tamil ?r?vai??ava canon called the /N?l?yira tivviya 
pirapantam /(/N?l?yira Divyaprabandham/, or ?The Four Thousand Divine 
Compositions?), and is composed of ten decades dedicated to different 
forms of Vi??u. This book also includes an introduction, which seeks to 
find out who Kulac?kara ??v?r really was, given his mysterious ? and 
often disputed ? identity.
