Subject: [INDOLOGY] DLI Mirror Site Live - https://dli.sanskritdictionary.com

Dear Colleagues,

Martin was kind enough to give me an advanced peek at his new mirror of the
Digital Library of India, as a beta tester.  The quietness and brevity of
his announcement belie the magnitude of this achievement.  It's a simply
wonderful resource to have available, and it is a larger set of DLI
materials than exists at Archive.org.  Having the DLI in two forms, with
different interfaces, is a tremendous gift to scholarship in our field.

Best,
Dominik
