Subject: [INDOLOGY] Resources for commentarial interpretations of particles

As for traditional resources, there are sections like Nip?t?rthanir?aya in
the works of Kau??abha??a and N?ge?abha??a, and the Naiy?yikas have
produced many works on the meaning of the negative particle like na?v?da
and on the meaning of *eva *like "evak?ravic?ra."  Discussions of Paryud?sa
and prasajyaprati?edha are also useful.
