Would anyone be able to identify the following ?loka from the Tantrav?rttika of Kum?rila? It could be from the 
?lokav?rttika as well, but the edition has a good index and this verse is not in it. The text simply identifies it as from the ?bha??av?rttika?. 

????? ?????????? ?? ????? ????????? ?
??????????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? 


Thanks.

Patrick
