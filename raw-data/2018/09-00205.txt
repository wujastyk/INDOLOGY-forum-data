 Hi Krishna Prasad,

The "America" entries in NCC are a reference to Poleman's *Census of Indic
Manuscripts in the United States and Canada. *Your Jagaddhara manuscript is
right there on p. 96 as entry 2085:

The "H" here stands for Harvard. You may also want to contact Peter Scharf,
who was involved in digitizing some of the manuscripts at Harvard, Penn,
Brown and other places.

Best,
Dave
