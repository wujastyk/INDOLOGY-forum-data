Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devanagari for Marathi
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQGa74zkVybsUFOcx5q9kH3hboiozcTxpufnRKxhmWjpCw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Can someone tell me if in Marathi ? (? with dot underneath)  is used for
the letter transliterated as za .  I've been told that in Marathi ? without
dot underneath is used but the ISO transliteration guide has ? (? with dot
underneath) for z .

Thanks,
Harry Spier
