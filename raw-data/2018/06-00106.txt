Dear McComas,

If I recall correctly, thematic and athematic were first employed by European Sanskritists on the basis of a perceived analogy with Greek. There is no corresponding traditional distinction.

best,
Matthew

Dear Friends


A Cambodian colleague is translating Gonda's grammar of Sanskrit into Khmer. She would like to use Sanskrit grammatical terms where possible.


She is asking for help with the following terms:


present stem


thematic and athematic verb classes


If some kind person could respond to me, I'll forward the information to her.


With thanks in advance


Yours


McComas
