On the general relationship of ??stra to actual artistic productions, there is the two-volume book edited by Anna Dallapiccola, "Shastric Traditions in Indian Arts" -- by Steiner Verlag. A lot of good essays, including two by Shelly Pollock.

I want her at least to know of the ideas such as expressed by Vincent Lef?vre, in his book Commanditaires & artistes en Indu du Sud. Des Pallava aux N?yak (VI-XVIII si?cle). Paris 2006, pp. 95-107 regarding the practical use (or rather, the absence of that) of such texts for the artisans and craftsmen: Briefly, the texts were mainly concerned with rituals; whatever practical information on construction etc. which is there, is there as a by-product of the ritual interest. If artisans refer to these texts they do so to enhance their status.
