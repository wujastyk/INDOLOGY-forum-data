Dear list,

Would anyone happen to have a PDF they are willing to share of

Pra?astap?d?c?rya.:  Pad?rthadharmasa?graha of Pra?astap?da : with the Ny?yakandal? of ?r?dhara / translated into English by Ga?gan?tha Jh?..  Varanasi : Chaukhambha Orientalia, 1982

or know where one is accessible? I have tried numerous times, unsuccessfully, to purchase a hardcopy from various Indian booksellers, and the library is now recalling this volume from me.

I have the Sanskrit texts, but would like my own copy of G. Jha's translation.

Many thanks in advance.

Dan Lusthaus
