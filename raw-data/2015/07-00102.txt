I am sad to report the death of Swami Veda Bharati
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Veda_Bharati>, formerly known as
Usharbudha Arya, after a long illness.  Swami Veda was a serious scholar of
indology, especially yoga??stra, and an outstandingly fluent Sanskritist.
He was also an inspiring and dynamic leader of the ashram in Rishikesh that
was devolved upon him when his own guru, Swami Rama
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Rama>, passed away in 1996. He was
particularly devoted to spreading the practice of meditation.

I met him in London, many years ago, when in a single afternoon's work on
the Sanskrit manuscripts at the Wellcome Library, he left me many pages of
invaluable notes and suggestions about the manuscripts he had examined.  I
exchanged emails with him only a few weeks ago, when he kindly shared a
number of publications with me over the internet.  He will be much missed.
