Dear Indologist,

I am looking for this book:

Pallabi Chakravorty & S. A. Kugle. (2009). *Performing Ecstasy: The Poetics
And Politics Of Religion In India*. Manohar: [I am also unsure about the
place of publication].

anyone can sand me the index of it? I would check if is there anything of
interest for my PhD research.

Best,
Paolo
