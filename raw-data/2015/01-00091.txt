I have a suggestion, which I proposed some years ago in Pur??a Itih?sa Vimar?a, Essays in Honour of Professor S. G. Kantawala, Delhi/Varanasi, 1998, pp. 313-335 (?Ideal and performance in Sanskrit?): the accepted text of the ?gveda included hypermetric (bhurik) and hypometric (nic?t) p?das, which the ?gvedapr?ti??khya acknowledges.  The same pr?ti??khya also provides that, for perfecting a p?da, one may break up the results of sandhi, including the insertion of i and v to give iy, uv instead of y, v.  The apparent inconsistencies are reconciled if one accepts that the ideal p?das arrived at are intended not for recitation but for theoretical purposes: to allow stating by rules the syllalbles of p?dfas that are elibible for metrical lengthening and the structures of cadences. which ?aunaka also does in his pr?ti??khya.

I came across cases of nine syllable g?yatr?s/anu??ubhs that have not been classified by the Pr?ti??khyas. Whitney too noted some of them. These are defective metres and are meant when it is asserted that one syllable too many or less does not matter.

Again, that one is still asked to recite v?re?iya? in RV 3.62.10a also points to the old tradition of reading disyllabic for metrical consistency. Obviously the RP means such cases as can be made regular by disyllabic reading. The tradition became weak and slack through the ages.

How to bridge that statement and the treatment in the Pr?ti??khyas that you refer to is an important question.  One possibility is that the analytical tradition of the Pr?ti??khyas became consciously aware of the metrical deviations and tried to account for them, while the tradition represented by the AB did not much care for this issue.  This is perhaps analogous to the earliest oral traditions of the Veda did produce variant branch Samhit?s with different readings, but with the later development of the rigorous methods of recitation like the various permutational Vik?tip??has, further splitting of the Sa?hit?s was arrested.  With metrical deviations, there is a similar possibility.  That is just my guess.  Best,

Isn't indeed the Taittir?ya convention of writing, e.g., suvar an explicit acknowledgement that it is dissyllabic, despite the convention elsewhere (where, nevertheless, a dissyllabic pronunciation might tacitly be acknowledged -- albeit this is a special case, a fixed form in TS.

There is an interesting passage in the Aitareya Br?hmana that says: na v? eken?k?are?a chand??si viyanti na dv?bhy?m.  Even by a deviation of up to  two syllables, the tradition did not consider the meter to be violated.  The text titled Vedavic?ra (19th century) that I am editing and translating cites this passages and extends it further: ekena dv?bhy?m ity upalak?a?am, tasm?d ak?arany?n?dhikabh?vena chand??si n?nyath? bhavanti.  Thus, it seems to be that "metrically restored RV" is a purely modern creation.  If the Br?hma?a texts were not bothered by deviations of meters up to two syllables, can we be so certain that the authors of the Vedic hymns were so bothered.  There is a possibility that "metrically restoring texts" could be something like a modern hyper-correction.  Modern reciters of the Vedas that I am familiar with do not seem to worry about reciting a metrically correct text.  While they seem to show interest in reciting the various P??has and their permutations, I am not at all certain that they are scanning the recited text for metrical deviations.

I have heard the disyllabic recitation from at least two Vedic reciters and was myself advised to do so with the few verses that I had to learn to utter as a child. But I have not examined each and every case of recitation.  I hope Professor Deshpande has the same experience
