On this topic, I particularly recommend this rich collection of studies:

Eschmann, Anncharlott, Hermann Kulke, and Gaya Charan Tripathi, eds. 1978. The Cult of Jagannath and the Regional Tradition of Orissa, South Asian Studies, no. VIII, S. Asia Institute, Heidelberg University. Delhi: Manohar.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes

Dear Indologist-friends,

Maybe someone can advice me about secondary literature on the use and incorporation of tribal/local myths into Puranic (and/or Tantric) mythology as "Hindu-Brahmanic" 's tool for the absorption of local/tribal traditions with a specific political purpose.

Best,
Paolo
