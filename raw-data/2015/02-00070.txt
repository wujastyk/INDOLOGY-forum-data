Different interpretations of the Bhagavadgita verses by different
commentators often are a result of different ways of splitting the words.
A good example is: n?sato vidyate bh?vo n?bh?vo vidyate sata?.  This is
interpreted by ?a?kara to mean that there is no bh?va for asat, and there
is no abh?va for sat.  Other commentators have read the line differently by
punctuating it in a different way: n?sato vidyate 'bh?vo n?bh?vo vidyate
sata? : There is no abh?va for either sat or asat.  The phrase
traigu?yavi?ay? veda? nistraigu?yo bhav?rjuna has similar different
readings.  One reading says that the Vedas have the three gu?as as their
domain (vi?aya), but, O Arjuna, free yourself from these three gu?as.  If I
remember correctly, Madhva says traigu?ya-vi?a-y? ved?? : traigu?yam eva
vi?am, tad y?payanti apagamayanti.
