Subject: [INDOLOGY] Crowdfunding Sanskrit Accent generator
Message-ID: <CADSGPzXORs2q3LtpPTvPiJcgojeKZr9z8VB35bUk4p8da12ZkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
Sorry for cross posting to more than one group.

Just wanted to spread the word that we are trying to crowdfund a project
for Sanskrit Accents.

The details of project and crowdfunding at -
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sanskrit-accents#/story

It is an attempt to replicate the phiTsUtras by computational means to
derive accented words from unaccented words.

If it gets through, probably it would be the first Sanskrit NLP project to
be crowdfunded.

If the project seems good enough, please spread the word to potential
supporters.

Regards
