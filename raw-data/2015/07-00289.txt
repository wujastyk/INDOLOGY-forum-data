Subject: [INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable rhyming?

This might be of some interest to some, too:

Bha??a Jayanta (a *northener* from Kashmir) makes a remark which has a
bearing on the habitats of camels at his time: *southerners* *who were not
acquainted with the sight of camels* were perplexed when they unexpectedly
chanced upon them walking in single file, as caravans do:

*pa?yaty anugata? r?pam avij??te ?pi v?cake | d?k?i??tya iv?kasm?t pa?yann
u??rapara?par?m* (NM (1) 283, 2 f.).


Abhinavagupta (from the same region) makes two similar remarks on *the
perplexity of southerners observing caravans or the long neck of camels for
the first time*: *an?locitopapattikam anavalokit?rthakriy?kam api
d?k?i??tyasya iva karabhacakram*. ?PVV Vol. 2, 347, 10 f. (ad 1.7.4)

*d?k?i??tyo** hi na karabhasya gr?v?m?tra? smarati; karabho hi
d?k?i??tyasya vismayasvabh?va? sukha? *[...]* janayet*. ?PVV Vol. 3, 58, 2
f.; 14 f. (ad 2.2.5).
