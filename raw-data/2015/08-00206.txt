     The source of Kudd?la for his statements in his Intro to Pata?jali's
Mahabh??ya must be statements found in Vaidyan?tha P?yagu??e's commentary
Ch?ya on N?ge?a's Uddyota.  All these quotes are found in the introductory
verses of Ch?ya (Vol 1, Vy?kara?a-Mah?bh??ya, ed. Shivadatta Kaddala,
Nirnayasagara, 1917, p2), where Vaidyan?tha refers to Par??araPur??a, and
Vi??udharmottara.
     I found an edition of Par??ara-Upapur??a on the website of MAHARISHI
UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT VEDIC LITERATURE COLLECTION.  I have attached the
pdf here.  All the passages cited by Kudd?la and Vaidyan?tha's Ch?y? are
found in this edition.  I am giving detailed references below:
