Dear Colleagues,
could someone with access to the Dakshina Bharati Series edition of the 
Kundam?l? (by Ramakrishna Kavi) help me out? I'm trying to trace a 
reference (by Dhruva in his edition of the Mudr?r?k?asa), according to 
which the editor's preface mentions a drama called Pratij??c??akya and 
says it is referred to in southern ala?k?ra works. I have no page 
number, unfortunately. I would be grateful if someone could try to look 
this up for me and photograph/scan the relevant page.
Any additional information about the Pratij??c??akya would also be 
welcome; all I have is what Warder says in vol. 5 of his K?vya 
Literature, plus a brief paper by R. Ramamurti in the Journal of 
Oriental Research (1930).
Thanks ever so much,
Daniel
