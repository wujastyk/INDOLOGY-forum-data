Dear list members,

A searchable version of the M?lin?vijayottaratantra (vol. 37 of the Kashmir
Series of Texts and Studies) has been added to the Muktabodha digital
library.  This was previously in the library only as a photographic
facsimile.  Note also.  The corrections listed in the appendix of this work
have been directly added to the text.

Manager, Muktabodha digital library
