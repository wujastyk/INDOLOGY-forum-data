Dear colleagues


Begging your indulgence:


Every year, I read Meghaduta with my third-year students at the Australian National University. Part of their assessment is a creative project in which they are required to make the poem 'their own' and express it in the medium of their choice. Please take a couple of minutes to watch this wonderful performance by Lily Warrum. She has choreographed and performed this herself. I'm sure you will agree it is quite an achievement.


Yours,  McComas
