Subject: [INDOLOGY] The legal right to publish OA

In the UK, research funded by the Research Councils /have/ to be open access for all papers (not yet books). Universities are having to start budgeting for 'gold access' - open access at time of publication. As for academics' right to publish open, at present most publishers allow a 'pre-publication' version to be posted, but 'green access', open after a set period, is their preferred option. To some extent, the government insistence on open access and publishers' economic model are heading for collision; hence the universities having to think of paying for gold access. The problem is that limited funds makes it impossible for universities to pay for non-research council funded papers that academics want to put on open access but for which publishers have stringent restrictions on open access.

I'm not so sure about this, but it may be that I'm simply out of the (relevant) loop. At least, I am not aware of being told anything about this (and I'm a professor at a Dutch university). On the other hand, and Dominik is certainly among the best informed, see: http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1160-Netherlands-Boycotting-Elsevier-To-Sustain-Bloat.html

In Holland and Germany, it seems, academics have the legal right to reproduce their own writings in an Open Access form after a "reasonable time" (Holland) or "12 months" (Germany).  That is, if the writings are funded - even partly - by public money.
