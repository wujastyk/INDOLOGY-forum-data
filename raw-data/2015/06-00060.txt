*Call for Proposals: The Gonda Fund for Indology*

The Gonda Fund supports the scholarly study of Sanskrit, other Indian
languages and literatures, and Indian cultural history. The Gonda Fund
awards:

1.     Fellowships to promising young Indologists at post-doctorate level,
that enable them to spend one to six months at the International Institute
for Asian Studies (IIAS) in Leiden, the Netherlands.

2.     Funding to scientists, scholars and scientific publishers for
publications and research projects.

3.     Gonda-grants to PhD students in the Netherlands for scientific
projects or working visits.

The deadlines for applications are 1 April and 1 October of every year.

The Gonda Fund is a foundation of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and
Sciences.
