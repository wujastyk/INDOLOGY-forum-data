Thank you Dipak,

I wasn't suggesting that the RgVeda gayatri was later than the Taittiriya
Aranyaka gayatris.
What I was trying to ask was
1)if the Taittiriya Aranyaka gayatris were the earliest gayatris after the
RgVeda gayatri
2Since the RgVeda gayatri became such a sacred mantra, the later gayatris
didn't follow its form but followed the form of the Taittiriya Aranyaka
gayatris.
I.e. .....vidmahe
....dhimahI
tan naH pracodayAt

Thanks,
Harry
