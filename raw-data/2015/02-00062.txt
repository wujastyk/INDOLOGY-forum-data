Subject: [INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences

Thanks for these replies.

What will help me the most is some very simple Sanskrit phrases that
show  completely different meanings by how you put breaks in the
transliteration.  I need to show examples of this to non-sanskritist,
non-devanagari knowing typesetters.

The best I could come up with is:

???????????? ?????? ?

which can be:

pu?pam adhyeti smarati ca He turns his mind towards the lotus and remembers
it.

or
pu?pa-madhyeti smarati ca = pu?pa-madhya iti smarati ca = He  remembers  [the
phrase] "the middle of the lotus"

More examples like this would be useful.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
