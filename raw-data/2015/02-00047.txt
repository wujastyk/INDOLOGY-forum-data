Dear Indologists,


If anybody has the transcript of ARE 559 of 1962-63, I would appreciate getting a copy. As far as I know, it is not published by ASI. In the absence of the transcript, if anybody knows of the text being included in any publication, I would appreciate getting a PDF of that.


Thanks in advance


Regards,
S. Palaniappan
