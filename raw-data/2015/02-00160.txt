The University of King?s College and Dalhousie University announce a

associated with the SSHRC Partnership Development Grant, ?Cosmopolitanism
and the Local in Science and Nature: Creating an East/West Partnership,? a
partnership development between institutions in Canada, India and Southeast
Asia aimed at establishing an East/West research network on
?Cosmopolitanism? in science. The project closely examines the ideas,
processes and negotiations that inform the development of science and
scientific cultures within an increasingly globalized landscape. A detailed
description of the project can be found at: www.CosmoLocal.org
<http://wordpress.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2d4375ec5dc6ff29d727d7830&id=9a4eb4baad&e=07a32a0bb9>

*Funding and Duration:*
The position provides a base salary equivalent to $35,220 plus benefits
(EI, CPP, Medical and Dental), and with the possibility of augmenting the
salary through teaching or other awards, depending on the host department.
The fellow would be entitled to benefits offered by University of King?s
College or Dalhousie University. The successful applicant will begin their
12-month appointment between April 1st and July 1st, 2015, subject to
negotiation and candidate?s schedule. Contingent on budget and project
requirements, the fellowship may be extended for a second year with an
annual increase as per institutional standards.

one of the departments of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at

until December 2016.

In addition to carrying out independent or collaborative research under the
