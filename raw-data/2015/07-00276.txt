Dear Palaniappan,


Maybe Indira Peterson is referring to what is most frequently seen.


Metrical treatises codify (and name) many theoretical possibilities
but many of those "possibilities" are extremely rare (and found only as 
examples inside treatises), which is why, when writing about Tamil meter
in a series of article, I have tried to make statistics.
