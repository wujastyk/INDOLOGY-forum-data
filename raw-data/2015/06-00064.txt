Dear Hans,

I agree with everything that you have said in this post [including the
"Best wishes and peace to all"!].

But I would add two more points.

The first is that, given its size, IVC may well have been bilingual or
multilingual.

The second is that Vedic is very unlikely to have been one of these
languages.  The picture of IVC that we get from the archaeological remains
of IVC is incompatible with the picture of Vedic culture that we see in
Vedic texts.  IVC is urban, and even urbane, whereas early Vedic is
nomadic.  IVC is rich in fish-signs, whereas fish are never mentioned in
the Rigveda.  Vedic is horse-centric, whereas horses are absent in IVC.
There is also the problem of a large historical gulf between the two
cultures.

Again, best wishes and peacce to all.

George
