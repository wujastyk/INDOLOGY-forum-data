Dear all,
I also find the collection rather fascinating. The early Goan prints are mentioned in the Preface (and Rajam?s list leaves out Garcia d?Orta ? perhaps the most fascinating among these early prints). But how was South India neglected as at the very beginning books printed at Trankebar in Tamil are presented. There is, however, one chapter in the (South) Indian printing history often forgotten (and I don?t mention this as criticism, just as interesting fact). As early as 1772 Jacob Shameer founded an Armenian printing press in Chennai and published some religious texts and school books.

Best,
Klaus
