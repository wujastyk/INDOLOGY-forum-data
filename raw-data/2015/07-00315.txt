Actually, it?s act and intent. Intent is considered in legal proceedings. It does not exonerate but it mollifies.

Malicious or criminal intent is worse in legal matters.

If Arlo is right, then why treat the offender with all the rage reserved for for malicious, criminal intent?

Best,
Howard

If you copy something physically, without permission, you've breached the copyright-holder's rights.  It's Act, not Intent.
