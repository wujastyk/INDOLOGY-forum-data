I'd like to confirm the positive report shared by Dominik earlier this 
year (below). His post encouraged me to contact Koba Tirth by email, and 
I found everone involved extremely helpful. It took them a few weeks to 
find the manuscripts of the texts I was looking for, but then I had 
given them several alternative titles. All in all I received PDFs 
containing nearly 600 pages of high-quality scans. Unlike Dominik, I 
also received a bill, for Rs. 600, but I was more than happy to pay. The 
only problem turned out to be that the amount was too small (!) to be 
handled by the transfer service I used, so I had to top it up with a 
minor donation; but again, I was happy to do so.
