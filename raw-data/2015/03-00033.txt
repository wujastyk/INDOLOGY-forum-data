Dea
?r Karin,?

In the 1945 Nir?ayas?gara Press edition of the Su?rutasa?hita,
<https://archive.org/details/sushrutasamhita> the page before the upodgh?ta
states that the editor N?r?ya?a R?ma had sight of an old palm-leaf MS of
the SS that was in the collection of Y. T
?rikamji?
?c?rya.

Do
? you know anything about YTA's manuscript collection?  Was it merged into
one of the Bombay collections?  Are members of his family still alive?

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
