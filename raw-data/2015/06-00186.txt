Call for Papers: (Dipartimento di Storia, Culture, Religioni, Universit? degli studi di Roma "La Sapienza")

The concept of religion transformed during Early Modern History, both in the ?inner? de- bate generated by the collapse of Christianity, and in ?outer? contexts, following a reaction to contacts with other cultures. Meant as a thematic section of our journal, the present call for papers aims to investigate ?religion? as a modern concept and a colonial dispositif. The mod- ern concept of religion inspired different processes of ?spiritual conquest? ? in discursive and practical terms ? within the dynamics of the ?mondialization? produced in the age of discov- eries. The theme section will investigate, through a comparative methodology, the historical resemblances among simultaneous colonial processes taking place in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Critical reflection on historical analogies and differences will contribute to a global mapping of the uses of the concept of religion during Early Modern History. We aim to pro- vide, on the one hand, an archaeology of the general modern concept of religion, and, on the other, a genealogy of religious studies, as a result of the international academic efforts towards a description, comparison, classification and explanation of religion. We expectthe authors to investigate the ?invention? of religion as a ?generalized? concept. Critical voices making use of colonial sources, such as missionary works, travel writings, etc., would be particularly wel- come, as well as contributions aimed to emphasize a ?connected history of religions?.
