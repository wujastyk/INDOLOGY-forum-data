Since the 2006 WSC (World Sanskrit Conference) in Edinburgh the IASS  
(International Association of Sanskrit Studies) inaugurated the DK  
Award for the outstanding doctoral thesis on Sanskrit and allied  
studies in collaboration with DK Agencies, Delhi. This is usually  
announced at  a WSC.

Four candidates competed for the Award for theses submitted in the  
period 2012-2014 and successful completion of their doctorates:

1. Jens W. Borgland: ?A Study of the Adhikara?avastu: Legal Settlement  
Procedures of the M?lasarv?stiv?da Vinaya?. University of Oslo,

Languages, 2014.

?Aesthetic Non-dualism? in text and practice: Contemporary Arts in the  
Light of the Rasaga?g?dhara?. Department of Politics, Philosophy and  
Religion, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK, September 2011.

On account of its philological achievements, the Panel of Adjudicators  
decided to give the DK Award 2015 to:

Dr Michael Slouber for his dissertation on: ?G?ru?a Medicine: A  
History of Snakebite and Religious Healing in South Asia?, submitted  
to the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, University of  
California, Berkeley, 2012.

The adjudicators would like to explicitly place on record that the  
thesis by Dr Elaine Fisher was also outstanding and that she should be  
mentioned honourably for her research work in the field of Sanskrit  
and Sanskrit studies. This was done at the IASS General Assembly  
Meeting in Bangkok after announcing the winner.

The next deadline for the Award is the end of January 2018 and  
depending on when exactly the next WSC will take place in Vancouver,  
Canada, the Award will be announced there.
