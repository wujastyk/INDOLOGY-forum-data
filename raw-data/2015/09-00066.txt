Subject: [INDOLOGY] who is the deity on the photograph?
Message-ID: <CAC68JpvCOuafDBUSdXojjzs43TcPj2fLECXLj+tVhKPo0vg-iw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear INDOLOGY members,

Can anybody tell us the name of the deity on the attached photograph, and
the festive occasion for which the offerings have been prepared (also
taking the month of the year into account)?

The photograph was taken in New Delhi, India, March 2007.

The offerings include pottery with sprouted Barley (*Hordeum vulgare*), a
decorated coconut (*Cocos nucifera*) and flowers of several plants.

Sprouting barley has also been documented in Calcutta (november 2014),
where it is offered for sale as germinated grain and as seedlings in
pottery, similar to the one on the photo.

I am asking this question on behalf of the author of the photograph, Ren?
Cappers. He is currently preparing a book on traditional agriculture
practices and food preparation.

With kind regards and thanks in advance for your help,

Roelf Barkhuis
