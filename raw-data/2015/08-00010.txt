Dear List Members, 

The text I have sourced of RN Dandekar et al. (1958-73) ?rautako?a: Encyclopaedia of Vedic Sacrificial Ritual (volume 1) is missing the section entitled ?The duties of the hot?: the recitation of the s?midhen? verses and allied rites? at pp. 337-352. 

I would be very grateful if someone could provide me with a scan of the missing section.

Thank you in advance,
