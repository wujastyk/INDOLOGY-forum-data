Besides, T. Ganapati Sastri?s 1917 edition (Trivandrum), there is a newer edition and translation by N. P. Unni (Trivandrum, 1971), and Barnett?s 1930 translation in BSOAS 5.1 (1930): 697-717.  I have sent you these.

My intermediate Sanskrit students produced a slightly condensed version of the play (using the ch?y? rather than the Prakrit passages), accompanied by a very free English rendering projected on a screen behind them.  A video of the performance is posted on my Academia.edu page.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mattavil?sa Prahasana

Dear All,

A quick google search tells me that there is at least one edition of the Mattavil?sa Prahasana and several (?) translations and theratical adaptations published. Would someone happen to have any PDF/s of the edition, translation and/or theatrical adaptations? I would be happy if you can share them.

Best wishes.

Mrinal Kaul
