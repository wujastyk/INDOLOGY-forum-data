Dear Friends,

I am looking for information regarding a particular Tantric practice. It
involves building up a living internal image of the dev? within the
practitioner's own body through visualising the chakras, their petals and
the corresponding b?ja mantras.

I don't really have much more to go on than this. If someone can point me
towards some textual references that would be great.

All the best,

Patrick McCartney
