Dear list,

Could someone please help me obtain the following chapter in pdf? My 
institution does not have this book and, in any case, I am away from campus.

Bechert, H. 1973. "Notes on the Formation of Buddhist Sects and the 
Origins of the Mah?y?na." In _German Scholars on India, Contributions to 
Indian Studies_, 6-18. Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office.
