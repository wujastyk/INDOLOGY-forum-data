Patrick's questions: ?Are the terms siddha and j?vanmukta synonymous? If someone is considered to be a siddha, does that imply that they are 'liberated in this lifetime'??

The classical authors, starting from ?a?kara and Ma??ana, raise the same issue but conclude differently. 
They, however, ask your questions in this way: ?Is a j?vanmukta already a siddha, a man who has already attained liberation, the goal of his life, for whom avidy? has entirely disappeared (vigalitanikhil?vidya? siddha?)?? ?If someone is considered to be a j?vanmukta, does this imply that he is a siddha (in the sense I interpreted in the first question), or that j?vanmukta/siddha is just a figurative expression and a person praised so is still a s?dhaka but has reached a highly advanced stage in spiritual cultivation and waits only for the final realization??

Some of the passages (not all) from ?a?kara, Ma??ana, and also V?caspati, relevant to this issue can be found discussed in the paper attached (pp.424-426).

There the term is used frequently with regard to monetary matters and bookkeeping, but within a religious context we have both siddha used alone and in the compound siddhat?pasa. In these usages, the reference is to a religious virtuoso who is capable of, or believed capable of, doing extraordinary things. See, for example, Artha??stra: 1.11.16; 1.12.22; 1.21.24; 4.3.13, 25, 44; 4.4.3; 5.1.3; 5.2.39, 41.
