Subject: ARE 559 of 1962-63

Dear Indologists,

If anybody has the transcript of ARE 559 of 1962-63, I would appreciate getting a copy. As far as I know, it is not published by ASI. In the absence of the transcript, if anybody knows of the text being included in any publication, I would appreciate getting a PDF of that.

Thanks in advance

Regards,
S. Palaniappan
