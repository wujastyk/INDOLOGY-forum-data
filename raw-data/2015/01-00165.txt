Subject: [INDOLOGY] gaNapATha commentaries
Message-ID: <CADSGPzUp5wB3PokzW4Kf4mu_ApOzg5GEpxU+qzvagM0JG6QuQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Respected scholars,
Sorry for cross posting.

I am looking for available commentaries on gaNapATha (Paninian or other
grammar systems).

I searched for it and could gather only gaNaratnamahodadhi.

I am sure there must be some other commentaries as well. Any pointers to
that regards would be welcome.
