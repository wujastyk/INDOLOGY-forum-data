Allow me to pose a very practical question. From information online, it would seem that getting a research visa for India is now no longer as difficult as it was reputed to be in the past, as least not if one is seeking to obtain such a visa from France:

The documents to be furnished are not outlandish in quantity or nature:

Does anyone have actual experience with the procedure, and does anyone have any idea on how much involvement in the research project Indian immigration services need to see in the letter from the Indian sponsor ("An original letter written in English, confirming the applicant?s admission or invitation to an Indian Institution")?

Thank you.

Best wishes,
