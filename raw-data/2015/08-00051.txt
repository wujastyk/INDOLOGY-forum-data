Yes,

this feature which you mention ("the initial vowels must agree in 
quantity") is an important feature,
and, interestingly, it must have been TOO OBVIOUS TO STATE,
from the point of view of the Tolk?ppiyam,
because the first Tolk?ppiyam s?tra explaining etukai
is the second element in a pair of s?tras,
which state (elliptically)

TP397i
a?ito?un talaiye?ut toppatu m??ai
(= a?ito?um talai e?uttu oppatu m??ai).

"That in which the head-/e?uttu/ in every /a?i/ is equal is /m??ai/."

TP398i
a?to?it to??i ?etukai y?kum
(=a?tu o?ittu o??i? etukai ?kum).

"If, that being omitted, there is identity, it will be /etukai/."

These s?tras have been earlier preceded by a s?tra which explains the 
larger category of /to?ai/ and which states

TP393i
m??ai yetukai mura?? yiyaipe?a
n??e?i marapi?a to?aivakai ye?pa.
(m??ai etukai mura?? iyaipu e?a
n?l ne?i marapi?a to?ai vakai e?pa.)

"They say that the subdivisions of traditionally four-pathed /to?ai/ 
are: (1) m??ai, (2) etukai, (3) mura? "contrast" and (4) iyaipu


The third element, mura?, and the fourth element, iyaipu, are 
characterized in:

TP400i
mo?iyi?um poru?i?u mura?uta? mura??.
(= mo?iyi?um poru?i?um mura?utal mura??.)

"The contrasting either in word or in meaning is /mura?/."


TP401i
i?uv? yoppi?a? tiyaipe?a mo?ipa.
(= i?uv?y oppi? a?tu iyaipu e?a mo?ipa.)

They call /iyaipu/ that in which final is identical;
