Dear Herman,

As it happens, I just presented a paper in Heidelberg that discussed this and other diplomatic idioms, their long duration and wide spread in South and Southeast Asia.
http://www.haw.uni-heidelberg.de/md/haw/veranstaltungen/programm_nepal-tagung_07.08_ii.pdf
I noted in particular that a surprising number of such idioms appear already in A?oka?s edicts, even though these have often been regarded as quite unlike later South Asian inscriptions.  Here is a sampling of what I call the ?perpetuity clause? in various forms.  There are many variations, but when moon and sun are mentioned (as they almost always are), it is always first and in that order, sometimes with stars inserted.  Here is a tiny selection of later examples in Sanskrit, (post-A?oka) Prakrit, Tamil, and Javanese, though such examples are legion:

Skt.:     ?-candr?rka?[1]/ ?-candr?rka-t?ra-k?l?na[2]/ candra-t?r?rkka-sthiti-k?la-[3]/ etc. etc.
            up to the time of the moon and sun [and stars]

Pkt.:     ?-canda-t?ra-k?l?ka[4]
            up to the time of the moon and stars

CT:      cantr?tittaval[5]
            as long as the moon and sun

OJ:       kadi lavas sa? hya? candr?ditya hana ri? ?-?k??a sumuluh hi? a??abhuvana[6]
            so long as the moon and sun remain in the sky and illuminate the earth-egg

[6] Kembang Arum A/B CP of Panggumulan I and II (? 824-825 = 27 Dec. 902), 3v7?8.

K. V. Ramesh has collected numerous examples from Kannada and Telugu inscriptions in his new Dictionary of Social, Economic, and Administrative Terms in South Indian Inscriptions (Oxford India, 2012), see pp. 8?9.

The ?sons and grandsons clause? that you mention is also almost as widespread, though it is not necessarily conjoined with the ?moon  and sun clause.?

I am revising the paper at them moment, but I would be willing to share it when it is ready, in mid-January.

Best wishes,

Tim

Subject: [INDOLOGY] as long as the moon and the sun shall shine


Dear List members,

In the S??c? version of A?oka's Schism Edict we come across the expression (putapapotike) ca?das?riyike, ?(as long as my sons and great-grandsons shall reign and) the moon and the sun (shall shine)?. A variant is found in the so-called Seventh Pillar Edict: putapapotike ca?damasuliyike hotu ti.

I am certain I have come across the expression before, but at the moment can think only of cantir?titta-varai in a South Indian Tamil inscription. Furthermore, I remember having once seen a photograph of a hero-stone (or was it a sat?-stone) with a sun and a moon carved in the upper part.

I hope someone on the list can help me with some more information. What I would in particular like to know is how wide-spread this expression is, what are the oldest instances, and if it has been described in the secondary literature.

With kind regards, Herman
