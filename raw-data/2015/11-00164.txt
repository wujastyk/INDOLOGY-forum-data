Dear colleagues,

Thank you for the fresh crop of suggestions and remarks.  I feel more uncertain than yesterday about the hypothesis I advanced, but no more convinced by any other theories.

A couple of considerations that guide me here could be mentioned.  

1) Since both epigraphical passages, that of Pre Rup and that of the ??rama-charters, come from exactly the same area, are just 70 years apart and talk about writing, it seems to me that the ideal would be to find an interpretation of m?tsn? that would fit them both.

This makes me disinclined, for example, to favour the idea suggested by Professor Aklujkar that m?tsn? might refer here to clay used for softening palm-leaves.  (A further consideration that makes this seem unlikely is that the ??rama-charters refer to the employment of 6 leaf-preparers, so it is presumably they who would be occupied with curing the leaves rather than the students.)

2) Although I am often accused of being only too ready to introduce conjectural emendations, in this case I think we have to follow the principle of sthitasya gati? cintan?y?, for these inscriptions are not only beautifully and carefully engraved, but the ??rama-charters have actually been beautifully and carefully several times over.  This means that emending ma??? m?tsn?? to ma??m?tsn??, which is I think what Christophe is suggesting, seems out of the question.

Bearing these guiding principles in mind I was in favour yesterday of understanding m?tsn? as ?steatite/chalk pencil? or the like, and therefore perhaps simply as ?writing implement? generically.  I certainly still think that this is possible, but I now think that the ?powder? hypothesis (chalk, talk, or, as N. Ganesan has suggested, turmeric) cannot be abandoned either. There are two difficulties with it: 1) it remains uncertain exactly how the powder would be used in manuscript production (rubbing turmeric to cure the leaves or render them supple ? rubbing light-coloured clay or powder to highlight the leaf around certain letters ? rubbing light-coloured powder instead of soot or blackener into the grooves that form certain letters, to achieve a sort of ?rubrication" in white ? marking out guidelines on the leaf before beginning to incise ?); and 2) it is unclear how the powder would be used in archery.

Reflecting about this second uncertainty, I noticed that Sarva Daman Singh (Ancient Indian Warfare: With Special Reference to the Vedic Period, p. 172) recounts an anecdote about an extraordinary South Indian archer in modern times who was nicknamed Kaliyug? Arjuna:

"He smeared exceedingly sharp arrow-tips with chalk dust and shot them at the bare backs of students with a perfect delicacy of control, so that they left only chalk marks on their tender targets without even grazing them."

This is not about ancient times, but if the trick was practised recently, then it might have been thought up long ago.  Perhaps K?ma is after all imagined similarly to have dusted his arrows with chalk.  Moreover, as Andrew Ollett has pointed out to me, the Pre Rup verse 

"provides some additional support to the chalk hypothesis, since it would have been impossible for the king's glory (and therefore also the letter drawn by k?ma's arrows) to have been anything other than white.?

Please let me know if you have further ideas on this (I am trying to finish an article about what can be gleaned about text-transmission practices in ancient times in the Khmer-speaking area).

>>> Arlo is right that the ??rama-foundation charters mention blank ?leaves? (riktapattra). The same ninth-century charters record (verse 98) that 6 leaf-preparers (?a? pattrak?rak??) are to be employed at each ??rama, as well as two scribes (lekhakau) and two librarians (pustakarak?akau). The word pattra could, of course, be a figurative way of referring to some other writing material, but this seems unlikely.  
>>> 
>>> The ?earth? used in Aditia Gunawan?s passages seems rather likely to be a blackening agent, and so, on the face of it, unlikely to be parallel to the m?tsn?, for the same sentence in the charters refers also to ma??, which is presumably black.  As for the possibility that m?tsn? refers to chalk, that might have been suggested not only by the Chinese allusion to blackened deerskin but also by an awareness of parabaik-use that Christoph has informed us about.  These may have been invented later, but is also, I suppose, not inconceivable that palm-leaves might have been blackened and written upon with chalk or something similar. And yet it seemed to me odd to understand m?tsn? to be chalk. Does m?tsn? ever mean chalk in any other context ?  Surely m?tsn? is almost invariably mud or clay (of differing colours), often used for smearing ? This was what led me to the idea that m?tsn? might have been used for the kind of ?rubrication? effect by smearing with a coloured substance to highlight letters or words or colophon-florets. (By the way, I notice a few instances of such smearing of colophon-florets also on the 9th-century Nepalese manuscript that transmits the Ni?v?satattvasa?hit?, but they might of course have been added by some later user.)
>>>

>>>

>>> 
>>> The glory that was born of his beauty, and that was pleasing to the heart, was a written character (ak?aram) that Kama had engraved indelibly (ak?aram) in the hearts of noble women with the powder of his arrows (?aram?tsn?bhi?).
>>> 
>>> (La gloire n?e de sa beaut?, et plaisante au c?ur, ?tait un caract?re d??criture que l?Amour avait grav? d?une fa?on ind?l?bile dans le c?ur des nobles femmes avec la poudre de ses fl?ches.)
>>> 
>>> This is fine as far as it goes.  The verse recalls the convention of heroes marking their arrows with names (usually their own) before shooting them, and there is an elegant play on ak?ara. But what can the ?powder of his arrows? be ?  Is there some arcanum of dhanu??stra that could explain this ? Or does the poet invite us to imagine simply that some clay or power was used to mark the name of the king upon the arrows that were then fired off by K?madeva ?  
>>> 
>>> But would not the compound ?aram?tsn?bhi? fit rather better here if it were a mukhacandra-type comparison-compound ? In that case m?tsn? could designate a writing instrument such as a stick of chalk or a slate pencil of the kind that Aditia Gunawan supposes might be referred to with the expression tanah (2015:263?264). In that case we might understand:
>>> 
>>> K?ma fixed as indelible (the letter that was) the heart-enflaming fame of his beauty [by rendering it] engraved in the hearts of lovely women by means of the pencils that were his arrows (?aram?tsn?bhi?).
>>> 
>>> This is attractive to me.  But then what of the ink (ma??) in the ??rama-charters. Should one suppose that an expression whose primary meaning was slate pencil or chalk stick came to be generalised to refer to any writing instrument, a bit like the word ?pen?, which no longer suggests the notion of ?feathers? to most people who use it?  In other words, could m?tsn? have come to mean ?stylus? in Cambodian Sanskrit ? In that case, we would have the leaves (riktapattr???), the blackening agent (ma??) and the writing instrument (m?tsn?) all referred to in the sentence of the ??rama-charters: riktapattra? ma??? m?tsn?? dady?d adhyet?s?dhave.

I think we have to come to terms with some use of 'earth' in the contexts of writing on palmleaf. Further evidence for such a practice is furnished in some passages cited in this interesting article on manuscript culture of early Java:

The sources are in Old Javanese and in Old Sundanese language; the context is explicitly that of writing on one or the other type of palmleaf (the local term lontar comes from rontal 'leaf of palm', where tal = t?la); the word for 'earth' is tanah, which still means 'earth' in Malay/Indonesian. Aditia Gunawan briefly discusses but does not solve the problem of what purpose 'earth' would serve in writing on palmleaf.

Niitisaararasamuccaya ms. from Kerinci. Also, there is an indication in a Bagan inscription, dated 1223, that features both the terms parabaik (i.e. other than palm leaf) and a donation of steatite in a container typical for usage on black (paper) parabaik more recently. Lammerts (2010, 232, fn. 7 and 10) points out that the terms and materials mentioned there may, but need not necessarily point to the usage of paper.
