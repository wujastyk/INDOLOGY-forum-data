Dear Prof Kellner,

There is a good discussion of v?rttika (along with other terms like bh??ya,
nibandha, ??k?, ?ippa?a, etc.) in Ch 8 ("Commentary and Creativity")
ofJonardon Ganeri's _The Lost Age of Reason: Philosophy in Early Modern
India 1450-1700_. A number of Buddhist, Ny?ya, etc. authors and texts are
discussed on the very topic in question.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
