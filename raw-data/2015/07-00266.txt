My impression is that you are still trying to Indianize, but partially;
not so much in externalities, but in thought, Weltanschauung. Otherwise
there would be no point in your Krishna West.

And here I want to point out what can be read in one of the comments to
that online article:

"This kind of "Hindu evangelism" is what scholar-practitioner Rajiv
Malhotra refers to as a "U-Turn." These people benefit enormously from
Hinduism and basically proceed to turn their backs on it while they go
mainstream. They should be exposed for the frauds that they are."

I only know this from this online comment by a person I do not know, and
I have no idea just where and how Malhotra has stated that people like
you are 'frauds'. (But I think we recognize the style.) If this is
correct, then it looks like he wants to 'take back' Hare Krishna too.
(So better take care.)

Sorry, I think we have a little misunderstanding here. My remark about
'nit-picking' referred to your reaction to Dominik in the thread, which
I left quoted at the bottom of my post. But I see that Dominik himself
already responded in the same spirit.
