Subject: [INDOLOGY] Developing story on alleged plagiarism by Rajiv	Malhotra

dear all
it seems indologists are not interested any more in the petition seeking
withdrawal Rajiv's books. This petition by Jesse knutson has attracted only
218 supporters as  I write this piece,

compared to 4053 supporters to the petition not to ban Wendy Doniger's
Books lasy year (
https://www.change.org/p/members-of-both-houses-of-the-indian-parliament-and-the-honorable-law-minister-government-of-india-reconsider-and-revise-sections-153-a-and-295-a-of-the-indian-penal-code-to-protect-freedom-of-expression-in-india
)

and much lower number compared to 9462 supporters to the petition for
non-withdrawal of Rajiv's books (
https://www.change.org/p/publishers-of-rajiv-malhotra-s-books-do-not-yield-to-mafia-pressure-tactics-that-seek-to-compromise-intellectual-freedom
)

Hence I call upon  all to concentrate on discussing the subject dealt by
Rajiv rather than 7 sentences without quotation marks, (see prof.
aklujkar's remark "it is first time in") though I agree it is a simple
mistake to leave these 7 sentences without quotation mark. Even rajiv
admitted it. it will be corrected in next editions.

it does not matter whether he is racist or utter fool. if you see anything
without evidence in his books please concentrate on it. why some of members
are so furious about him? why dont stand for free speech?

I also ask our colleagues to send me scanned copies of his books if anybody
has. so we can glance it.

we stand together for free speech is the conclusion.
