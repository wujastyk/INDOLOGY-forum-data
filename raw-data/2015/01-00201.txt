Dear Colleagues--

Many thanks for the many helpful responses to my earlier request regarding Chidambaram Pata?jali images. David Smith was kind enough to provide me with a high-resolution image of the Pata?jali statue from the East Gopuram at the temple, so the problem has been resolved. 

Best Wishes,
Stuart
