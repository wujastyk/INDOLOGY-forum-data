I am sorry it looks like the fonts did not come through right the second time too. So I am attaching the post as a PDF.


Please discard the two earlier posts.

Dear all,  
 
  
 
 
In preparing the editio princeps of the so called Wright Chronicle, a Chronicle in Nepali translated by Daniel Wright in 1877, we (Manik Bajracharya and me) came across two apparently ?aiva phrases which do not make much sense to us:  
 
  
 
 
   This ascetic built another house near the place, invoked Svatantra-m?lam?rti-?rddh?mn?ya and continued to perform the daily worship   of Pa?upatin?tha   
   
   
 
 
   
 The ascetic, too, caused the t???amantra together with Mah?k?lokta-agam?rtha-n?tyal?l?-prasann?rtha to be inscribed on the parasol, and this unprecedented parasol was then offered to Pa?upatin?tha. 
  
   
   
 
 
  
Can anybody help us in understanding it (better)?  
 
 
  
 
 
Best, 
 
Axel Michaels
