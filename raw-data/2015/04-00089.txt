Dear Patrick,

 A couple of great resources on this topic are Wendy Doniger's edited
volume (as O'Flaherty) *Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian
Traditions (*particularly
the chapters by Long, Potter, and Halbfass) and Fort and Mumme's edited
volume *Living Liberation in Hindu Thought*.

Regards,
David
