Sorry, friends, this is a phishing attack.  They ususally don't get through
to the list, but this did, somehow.  Just ignore it, and *don't* log into
paypal through their link.  If you have already done so, go and change your
paypal password *right now* and tell paypal if your account has been
tampered with.
