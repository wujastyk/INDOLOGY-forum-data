Dear Members,

I am looking for a scan of this book in 3 vols.:

Sa?hityaratna?kara of Dharmasu?ri : with Nauka? of Carla Ven?kat?asu?ri and
Mandara of Malla?di Laks?man?a Su?riSanskrit Academy series ; 21, 22,
24; Hyderabad
: Osmania University

As I am looking for a particular passage (6.14) dealing with the
construction of n?gabandhas, the page concerned will suffice (it should be
in vol.2)...
Anyone willing to share?

Best,

Alessandro Battistini
PhD Candidate
Sapienza Universit? di Roma
