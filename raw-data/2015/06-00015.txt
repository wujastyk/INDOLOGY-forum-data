> The ?a?kar?c?ryacarita has been published several times before Antarkar's edition  (Trichur [Kerala Publ. House] 1914, 1926, Kumbakonam [Sri Komalamba Mudranalaye] 1926, Poona [Citrasala Mudranalaye] 1931; the text publ. in 1966 by K.N.M. Divakaran Namputiri has been reissued recently in Calicut Sanskrit Series 50, 2013 [Ved??gad?pti (Collected works of K.N.M. D N.], pp. 153-215). According to K. Kunjunni Raja (CKSL pp. 151 fn. 150; 206, 243, with reference to Ullur KSC), Govindan?tha was "a disciple of R?ma V?riyar belonging to the Karikk???u V?riyam in South Malabar" and is also the author of a yamaka poem Gaur?kaly??a depicting the mariage of P?rvat? and ?iva (unpublished ; in 3 ??v?sas, noted for its simplicity and lucidity). This R?ma V?riyar of Karikkat was a contemporary of  N?r?ya?a Bha??a of Melputt?r, so G "must have flourished in the first half of the seventeenth century A.D."
> G. recognized himself (1.6-7) that his work is based on Vy?s?cal?ya's ?a?karavijaya (publ. Madras GOML series 24, 1954), cf. Antarkar 2004, pp. 40 (+ 95 fn.), 48, etc., Pande 1994, pp. 21-22.

>> W. R. Antarkar, who is/was the world's leading expert on the various ?a?kara-vijayas, in his English Introduction to his Sanskrit edition of Govindan?tha's ?a?kar?c?ryacaritam has a few paragraphs about him. This was published in Bh?rat?ya Vidy?, vol. 52, 1992, pp. 55-141. If needed, I can send you a scan of this.
