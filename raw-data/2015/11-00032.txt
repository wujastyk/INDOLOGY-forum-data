Dear Michael,
You are absolutely right that this could be the easiest way to explain the presence of the Yemen-origin copper plate in the area near Peshawar. The only problem with the 19th-century transfer hypothesis howeer is that the plate which I saw and photograhed was brought to a local antique dealer by a villager who explained he had found it in the fields (somewhere between Peshawar and Swat) and these are the same fields where villagers occasionally find Kushan coins etc. And he brought it to the dealer like many other antique items - for sale. It is rather unlikely (but certainly not impossible) that 19th century British citizen brought the plate from Yemen and deposited (or lost) it somewhere in the fields. 
Best wishes,
Piotr

Dear All,

This is a very interesting discussion, but I think it might be worth considering another possibility. As we all know, in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century Britain ruled both southern Yemen and India/Pakistan. Now, we also know that there are Ancient South Arabian inscriptions in the Bombay Museum and probably other museums in the Subcontinent (Norbert Nebes will be able to provide the details). Most British ships en route to India stopped at Aden to refuel, and it seems likely that these inscriptions were bought in Yemen by British or other travellers on their way to the Subcontinent where some of them, at least, were left. The antiquities market was already flourishing in Yemen during the 19th century and it is highly likely that finds from the north of Yemen (where there would have been very few commercial outlets) found their way to the international market in Aden. Of course, this is pure speculation but it seems to me a more likely explanation than that the plaque was taken to Pakistan in antiquity.

With best wishes,

Michael.

One possibility is that it was indeed brought to the Gandhara region by a trader from Yemen, but that being the case, the plate should have been considered of some material value by both the trader and a potential buyer. 
> As we learn, "it is a votive text probably dedicated by a female person" ... "from the early centuries AD", so it is a religious item, probably of little practical or religious value for anyone in an area where Buddhism dominated. Perhaps the contents of the plate could reveal some more details. A possibility is that, if being a votive plate, perhaps it played some protective role for a traveller / trader from Yemen venturing to India? Alternatively, it could have been transported perhaps with some household goods or dowry of a bride from Yemen moving to India? Or perhaps it was once offered by a Yemeni person to an Indian trader who spend some time in Yemen and on his way back he took all his belongings along with him back to India? These are sheer speculations on my part because I don?t have any idea what function such votive copper plates fulfilled in Yemen, how they were used and circulated etc. If such votive plates were placed in a temple somewhere in Yemen "for ever" and offered to a local deity, then it is quite difficult to expain how the plate found its way to India. However, if such plates were meant to be given to someone as a kind of protective amulet, then it makes it much easier to explain. We would require some additional help from a specialist who would explain the role of such votive plates.

The villager did not reveal where he found the copper plate but from what I understood the place is somewhere between Peshawar and Swat.
>> Being a witness and knowing that the copper plate will sooner or later circulate in the black market and may never be available to researcher, I asked them to provide me with a photograph of it. All the means that the plate couldn?t have been published anywhere before because it seems to be the new found (discovered about a month ago or so) as a result of rampant illegal excavations in the Af-Pak region. I cannot say where the copper plate is now. It is indeed quite surprising to learn that the copper plate originated from Yemen and reached the areas near Peshawar. Knowing that the villager brought the plate to the dealer, it is unlikely that it transpired in Pakistan as a result of modern illegal antique trade.
>> My intention to circulate the photo via Indology List was to make it available to researchers: since we cannot have the material object any more, at least there is the photograph of it.
