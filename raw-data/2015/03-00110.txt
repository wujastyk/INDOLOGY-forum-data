Subject: [INDOLOGY] help with 2 quotes
In-Reply-To: <CAEzwJrCYX0CTXPs0HxXfBUGiAKds+gr-DYO_gwOwnkYwsKUmgA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <55154595.10705@pbhome.se>

The first is a very concise summary of B?had?ra?yaka 2.4 and/or 4.5 
(near-identical passages); the second is Ka?ha 5.13 (similar to 
?vet??vatara 6.13).

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
