Subject: [INDOLOGY] The so-called German Indology
Message-ID: <CAOuG4CbVHF+=7Cgb_793Q1eeWDSmjMRNwcHfnn_c=N+CTEC9zg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I just came along the recent publication by Adluri and Bagchee entitled
?The Nay Science. A History of German Indology,? (Oxford, New York: Oxford
University Press, 2014). This book claims on its first page to demonstrate
that ?the application of the text-historical method [the authors use this
term as a synonym for historical-critical methods in general] is not
scientific [their translation of ?wissenschaftlich?], ? in the majority of
cases, the textual histories German scholars came up with using this method
were a projection of their fantasies.?



In reading these lines, I get quite puzzled. Are historical-critical
methods in general flawed, or only when practiced by Germans?





I would be grateful for suggestions.





With best wishes,



Philipp Maas
