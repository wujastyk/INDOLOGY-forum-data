I published some times ago an edition and translation into French of a
commentary on Bh?skara's L?l?vat? where all these elementary
operations are explained. If you are interested I could help. If you
do not read French language, at least you can read the Sanskrit text...

On these subjects: interest, mixture and so on, I have not finished
yet the edition/translation, but you can find some parts here:

Search on my name: Fran?ois Patte.

Hope this help.
