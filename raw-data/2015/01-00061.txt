Subject: [INDOLOGY] N. Ganesan's Dravidian etymologies for 'makara', etc.
Message-ID: <29208549.1420825778808.JavaMail.root@elwamui-rustique.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

My good wishes to all for a very happy and productive New Year 2015!

Note: My own computer has been sent in for repair and I'm using an old, unstable, borrowed machine. So, the following is a quick response. I hope to send in my comments once I have a robust computer. The one I'm using now may crash anytime while I'm typing in. 

Two attachments from the original mail on this topic didn't download properly. They just come out as a blank file.

WOW and Bravo, that's all I can say for now about the original article by Dr. Ganesan and the critique from Dr. Palaniappan. 

I am deeply eager to hear responses from our esteemed colleagues, especially from Professors Asko Parpola, M. Witzel, Madhav Deshpande, George Hart, ..., and a savvy engineer Suresh G. (student of Bh. Krishnamurti), and many other scholars such as Jean Luc Chevillard on this list.

I'll share my thoughts when I have a robust computer since I need proper diacritics and a non-failing email client all to type.

Thanks and regards,
V.S. Rajam

>In multiple Internet posts N. Ganesan has mentioned an article of his entitled, "A Dravidian Etymology for Makara - Crocodile," published by the International School of Dravidian Linguistics in 2011.  (See Attachment 1 for the article.) In this article, Ganesan offers new etymologies for words meaning crocodile such as Sanskrit makara, Sanskrit nakra/n?kra, Tamil mutalai, and Tamil vi?a?kar/i?a?kar. As far as I can see, the article seems to have serious flaws from the viewpoints of linguistics and philology. While usually an article of such a nature might not receive any serious attention from scholars, the fact that it is said to be published by International School of Dravidian Linguistics suggests that it undergo scrutiny by scholars.

>          
>However, on p.7 of his article, Ganesan states, "The Proto-Dravidian root for makara is *mokaray- a verbal noun from the verb, *mok-/*mo?ku- 'to eat greedily in large mouthfuls, eat voraciously, devour, gobble, swallow' (DEDR 5127+4897)."

Kui muka (muki-) to cast food into the mouth with the hand; mukal mouthful; mukal giva to rinse out the mouth, take a mouthful, gargle. Kuwi (Isr.) buk- (-it-) to gobble, swallow. Cf. 5127 Ma. m?kuka.

>I do not understand how Ganesan could get the Proto-Dravidian 'root' *mo?ku- from these entries.

>Having postulated *mok-/*mo?ku- from DEDR 5127 and 4897, Ganesan states:

>"The Dravidian verb, mok-/mo?k- transforms to moc-/mo?c- in south Dravidian languages."           
>          
>As far as I know, there has been no basis for such a context-free transformation mentioned in any work on comparative Dravidian phonology. (Moreover, as one can see above in DEDR 4592, the words for 'crocodile' in north Dravidian languages, Kurukh and Malto, also have -c- and not -k- in DEDR 4952.)

>"Hence Kannada and Telugu have mosale or mosali (< *mokaray), and Tamil and Malayalam derives its mosale> motalai > mutalai from the same verbal root, mok- with -r- > -l- alternation in the South."           
>          
>Ganesan has not presented any evidence of -oka- transforming to -oca- or -osa- in south Dravidian languages. So, in my opinion, Ganesan has not provided an acceptable Dravidian etymology that supposedly explains Sanskrit 'makara' as well as Tamil mutalai.

>Etymology for nakra/n?kra                     
>          
>Ganesan also has given an etymology for Indo-Aryan words for gharial, the long-snouted crocodile.           
>          
>On p. 4 of his paper, Ganesan says, " The god ?iva in Tamil bhakti texts of the first millennium, is extolled as either nakkar or vi?a?kar indicating ?iva?s nudity and his virile lingam in particular. These epithets for ?iva and his lingam have origin in the names for gharial crocodile (Section 3.0). When vi?a?ku is used, it indicates the naked bhik???ana youth going rounds in the streets and attracting women: ma?aika? t??um talai kai ?nti vi?a?kar?kit tirivatu e???? (Tevaram 7.6.1)."           
>          
>The interpretation of Tamil vi?a?kar as indicating a naked ?iva is simply not valid according to Tamil philology.  Indeed the text quoted by Ganesan is translated by V. M. Subramanya Iyer in the Digital T?v?ram edition (from EFEO, Pondicherry) as "what is the reason for wandering from house to house, assuming a beauteous form and asking alms, " where he translates vi?a?kar as 'beauteous form? (http://tinyurl.com/p7vg2wl). ; That vi?a?kar is not naked is shown by T?v?ram 7.36.3, another verse by Cuntarar, the same person who authored the verse quoted by Ganesan too. In this verse translated by V. M. Subramanya Iyer, Vi?a?kar is explicitly described as wearing a loin-cloth as given below (http://tinyurl.com/nbns4gt).          
>          
>You are pure in your eyes, mouth and body, you wear a sewn loin-cloth, give up dancing along with p?y in the cremation-ground, are you a mad person? Our master! Civa?, who is known by the name of ?ra?iya vi?a?kar in Pai???li surrounded by a verdant garden which has mast wood trees, cool and green delight of the woods, and lotus flowers growing in the moats into which water flows.          
>          
>So there is no connection between nudity and vi?a?kar as claimed by Ganesan.
