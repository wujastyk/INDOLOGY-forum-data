Dear all,
I must confess that I have never really got used to the North American habit of calling everybody by their first name, but I put

I don't mind it at all in India, since that is clearly the normal way. However, I certainly resent to be called Madame Stella - sounds like I am running a brothel.
All the best
Stella
