Since the search is still on for quotations of these verses, perhaps these ?aiva quotations may be of interest.

South Indian ?aiva authors from the twelfth century onwards (e.g. Aghora?iv?c?rya ad M?gendrav?ttid?pik? 8.5) tend to quote just these two p?das without attribution:

n?bhukta? k??yate karma kalpako?i?atair api

These 2 p?das became incorporated into the Pau?karasa?hit?, a ?aiva scripture apparently unknown in the twelfth century that has been commented upon in the sixteenth, as half-verse 2.45cd.

The tenth-century Kashmirian commentator Bha??a R?maka??ha frequently quotes (e.g. Kira?av?tti 5:9.2) the following quarter verse as being ?ruti/?gama, in other words as being from a scripture of the ?aivasiddh?nta:

n?bhukta? karma na?yati

I haven?t been able to trace it in a Siddh?ntatantra.

I have found some of these in other works but not others, and even for the ones I have found, I suspect there are earlier or more common sources. Any help with attributing the following would be much appreciated:

No attribution, but apparently popular -- found (with variants) in N?radapur??a 1.31.69 and 2.29.18 and Mah?subh??itasa?graha 3292 (also quoted in ?yurvedad?pik? and Satya??sanapar?k??); the question is what would be either the earliest source or the most common/typical one in the early 1600s:
