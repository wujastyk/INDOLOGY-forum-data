Subject: [INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable	rhyming?
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eZWm2SGbc-G1HYxrjO_4O2Bfx2JYtRSshMVYrQ761TRNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Now second syllable rhyming:

In Telugu, the second syllable rhyming is one of the chandoniyamas specific
only to Sanskrit borrowed meters such as utpalamAla, champakamAla,
mattEbhavikrIDita, s'ArdUlavikrIDita and so on. As such all the Telugu
verses in Sanskrit-borrowed meters right from those found in the eighth
century inscriptions till date invariably have second syllable rhyming.
This rhyming is given the tatsama name prAsa.

It applies to a   meter kandamu (<skandha)too,  believed to be prAkrit
-borrowed and  derived from  a variety of AryA.

This niyama does not apply to native Telugu meters.
