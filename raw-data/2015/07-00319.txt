T?bingen University hosts guest lecturer from southern India
 
Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies expands its focus on Malayalam language and culture
 
Starting in October, students at the University of T?bingen will have outstanding opportunities to learn Malayalam, a language spoken in southwestern India, thanks to a new guest professorship at the Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies sponsored by the Indian government?s University Grants Commission. Teachers from the Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University in the state of Kerala will be in T?bingen to support the teaching of Malayalam, which is spoken by some 33 million people. This initiative reinforces the University of T?bingen?s long-term focus on the language, which is unique in Europe. 
 
The guest professorship is known as the Gundert Chair after the Malayalam expert Hermann Gundert, a nineteenth-century academic from T?bingen who bequeathed his personal collection to the T?bingen University Library. The guest lecturers will help to work through these historical monographs and manuscripts. As part of the Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies? focus on southern India ? which Ethnology Professor Gabriele Alex and Indology specialist Dr. Heike Oberlin are currently expanding ? the guest lecturers will play an important role in research and teaching. The partner university in Kerala is keen to promote Malayalam literature, and to make it accessible to a wider public via professional translations. A further aim is to develop teaching materials for foreign students of Malayalam.
