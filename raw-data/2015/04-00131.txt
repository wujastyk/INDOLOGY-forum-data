Dear friends,

Our colleague Eli Franco has kindly sent me the following reference in response to my recent query

B.A.Saletore, "Historical notices of the Lokayatas", ABORI 23, 1942,
386-397. 

The problem is that the JSTOR archive of the ABORI skips vol. XXIII (1942) altogether, and I 
therefore unable to access the article in this way. 

If anyone can send me a pdf, I would be most grateful.

thanks in advance,
Matthew
