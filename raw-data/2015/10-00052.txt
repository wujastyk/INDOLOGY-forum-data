Subject: [INDOLOGY] Identification of verse
In-Reply-To: <5616E0EA.4000101@gmail.com>

The verse could be read




*sarvadra??? sarva?r?t? sarvakart? ca rak?aka?/ sarvaj?a? sarvar?p? ca
sarvam ca sarvata? p?t?//*

The concepts of the verse suit the Ved?nta philosophy but it does not seem
have been a scriptural one.  Possibly it was created by the missionary
himself*. *The final part of the fourth quarter is not iambic.  That is
unusual for the last quarter. The monotony of the word *sarva* also was
avoidable.
