>From reading about traditional (Early Modern and Modern) Western training in Latin and Greek, in which composition was an important part, I am led to wonder if it was standard in traditional Sanskritic education for students to be assigned to compose verse, either the basic Zloka for expository works or more elaborate kavya.  Any thoughts or evidence.
