There is one more edition of the grammatical Sarasvat?-ka??h?bhara?a 8th adh. (Gujarati script for the commentary)  :
Bhojadeva-viracita? sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a-vaidikavy?kara?am | a??amo 'dhy?y?? | prathama-dvit?yap?dau (vaidik?prakriy?) | t?t?ya-caturthap?dau (svaraprakriy?) /  New Delhi : R???r?ya Vedavidy? Prati??h?na, 1992

Le 7 janv. 2015 ? 11:27, Christophe Vielle <christophe.vielle at uclouvain.be> a ?crit [note the here corrected ref. to KS] :

> Dear list,
> 
> in a commentary to a Sanskrit play (dated from the 9th to the 11th c.), there is the following quotation from/reference to a s?tra-work by one Bhoja  :
> 
> v?naraj?tibhir ity atra v? ?abdasya+eva+ity artha? | v? ?abda? samuccaya-vikalpa-nir?aye?v iti bhojas?tre?oktam | atra nir?aye | antarhit?bhir eva+ity artha? | 
> 
> (the glossed word is in italics : the meaning is either in the ?abda itself or - according to the  referred s?tra -, and as it would be the case here, in the nir?aya).
> 
> This could be a reference to one work among the several ones attributed to the 11th c. king of Dhara.
> However, Bhoja's only work in s?tra-form is the grammatical Sarasvat?-ka??h?bhara?a (*), in 8 adh., of which I am aware of the following two editions only :
> 
> ? 4 vols ed. in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, no. 117 (1935), 127 (1937), 140 (1938) and 154 (1948), of which the vol. 4 only is e-available through the DLI : http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data14/upload/0012/922&first=1&last=547&barcode=99999990322092

> ? ed. T. R. Chintamani, prefaced by Kunhan Raja, Madras University Sanskrit Series no. 11, 1937, which should be available through the DLI (but it does not function in this case) :

> 
> 
> 
> Would the commentary refer to that work (which I am presently unable to check fully)?
> 
>  Or would it be possible that there exists a (m?m??s? or niy?ya, possibly lost) s?tra-work dealing with ?abda-topic and authored by another (older) Bhoja? 
> 
> Note that Aru?agirin?tha in his com. to Kum?rasambhava 5,65 (cf. also N?r?ya?a Pa??ita ad loc.) refers to a grammatical s?tra by Bhoja in the followin manner :

> tad?dau ceti bhojas?tram

> Note that I do not know which (of the two) Sarasvat?-kan?h?bhara?a was edited by Anundoram Borooah in 1883, reprinted Gauhati, Publ. Board Assam, 1969 and, more recently, within the Works of Anundoram Borooah : with a note on Anundoram Barooah and his works by Malinee Goswami, Guwahati : Publication Board Assam, 2007, pp. 667-1050, and which could therefore constitute the editio princeps of one or the other work.
