I am sorry my email client somehowmessed up the diacritics. Let me try again with some additional informationtoo.
 
At least for the second item, Imay have a possible suggestion. It is possible you may have a dance style beingreferred to by the term agam??rtha which seems to have undergone somechanges going from Tamil into Sanskrit either due to different forms ofhypercorrection or possible transcription errors.  The source word in theTamil tradition is akam????rkkam(transliterated in Tamil Lexicon style) which is a hybrid made up of Tamil akamand Sanskrit m????rga. If one were totransliterate akam????rkkam based onpronunciation, it could be transliterated as aham??rga or agam????rga. (The classical Tamil text, the Akan????????????u (transliterated in Tamil Lexicon style) is variouslytransliterated as the Ahan????????????u  andthe Agan????????????u .) TheBharat????r???ava of Nandike??vara transliterates this as aham????rga. (See pp. 34 and 137) in the attachment. In the same attachment, Mah????k????la is said to beinvoked at the entrance to the stage during the first performance orinstallation of the stage (pp. 472-474). 
 
South Indian Inscriptions vol. 23,inscription no. 306 of 1190-91 CE transliterates the term as agam????rgga in the summary although the inscription has thevariants in Tamil as akam?????kam and [akam?????]kkam.
 
A???iy??rkkunall??r,the commentator of the Cilappatik??ram refers to akam??rkkam in hiscommentary on Cilappatik??ram 3.12.
 
Was the ascetic from the Tamilcountry? What is the date of the text?

Dear all,  
 
  
 
 
In preparing the editio princeps of the so called Wright Chronicle, a Chronicle in Nepali translated by Daniel Wright in 1877, we (Manik Bajracharya and me) came across two apparently ??aiva phrases which do not make much sense to us:  
 
  
 
 
   This ascetic built another house near the place, invoked Svatantra-m??lam??rti-??rddh??mn??ya and continued to perform the daily worship   of Pa??upatin??tha   
   
   
 
 
   
 The ascetic, too, caused the t????????amantra together with Mah??k??lokta-agam??rtha-n???tyal??l??-prasann??rtha to be inscribed on the parasol, and this unprecedented parasol was then offered to Pa??upatin??tha. 
  
   
   
 
 
  
Can anybody help us in understanding it (better)?  
 
 
  
 
 
Best, 
 
Axel Michaels
