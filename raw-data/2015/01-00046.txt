On pp. 7-8of his paper, Ganesan says, "In East India (Nepali, Bihari, Bengali) (3) nakar is the nameof gharial [13], directly derivable from the Tamil verb, nakar- ???tocreep, to crawl slowly???. Compared to muggers (< makara), gharialshave much smaller, weak legs and cannot do ???high walk??? as muggers can (Figures7, 8). When gharials come to the shore for sun bathing orfor laying eggs, they creep on the banks awkwardly pushing their huge bodiesforward. From this Dravidian nakar, Sanskrit gets nakra-/n??kra- andMiddle Indo-Aryan nakka-. In Tamil Tevaram texts, ??iva is called nakkar/nakka???due to his nudity traceable to thephallus shape of the gharial snout and its ancient name."
 
WhileGanesan easily moves from Tamil nakar to Dravidian nakar, DEDRdoes not include an entry that includes Tamil nakar 'to creep, to crawlslowly'. There seem to be no cognates of nakar in anyother Dravidian language including Telugu and Kannada. (nakar is notincluded in Emeneau and Burrow's  "Dravidian Borrowings fromIndo-Aryan" either.) So Tamil nakar'to creep slowly, crawl slowly' being the source of Indo-Aryan nakra/n??kra is not very convincing tome.  Asa result, tracing nakkar/nakka??? (referring to ??iva) "to the phallusshape of the gharial snout and its ancient name" also seems to beimpossible.
 
However,there is another possibility, as Burrow and Emeneau seem to think.
 
DEDR3732 entry is given below.
3732 Ka.negar??, negar??e alligator. Tu. nega????? id.; negar?? asea-animal, the vehicle of Varu???a. Te. (B.) nega???u apolypus or marine animal supposed to entangle swimmers. / Cf. Skt. nakra-crocodile; n??kra- a kind of aquatic animal; Turner, CDIAL, no.7038. 
 
Basedon DEDR 3732 Krishnamurti has given a reconstructed form *nek-V??????? (Dravidian Languages, 2003, p. 13). This word atleast could be transmitted to Indo-Aryan since Kannada is adjacent toIndo-Aryan linguistic areas. 
 
Etymologyof Tamil i???a??
kar
Asbest as I could figure out Ganesan's chain of reasoning, this is how Ganesanseems to arrive at how Tamil words vi???a??
kar/i???a??
kar are interpreted as referring togharial.
 
 ??iva is naked as Bhik????????ana. 
 
 Gharial's snout has the shape of aphallus.
 
 Gharial is called nakka in MiddleIndo-Aryan
 
 So ??iva is called nakkar becausehe is naked.
 
 Tamil vi???a??
ku means 'to beerect (as lingam)' (Ganesan's own interpretation)
 
 ??iva is called vi???a??
kar.
 
 So vi???a??
kar stands for the male organ. 
 
 Gharial's snout has the shape of aphallus. 
 
 So vi???a??
karin Tamil means gharial. 
 
Accordingto Ganesan, vi???a??
kar lost the initial v- and became i???a??
kar. 
 
Theword vi???a??
kar referring to a crocodile occurs for the first time in the Varatar??caAiya??
k??r P??kavatam, a 16th century text. Earlier literary texts or lexicons donot mention that word. But earlier texts going back to 2nd century CE mention i???a??
karin the sense of 'crocodile'.  In several instances in the Kampar??m??ya???am(ca. 9th or 12th century), i???a??
kar is the word used to describe thecrocodile that attacked the elephant in the Gajendra Mok???a episode. (Forexample, see Kampar???????ya???am 5.12.79.3.)
 
(Infact, contrary to Ganesan???s suggestion of vi???a??
karbeing the original form, which lost v-to result in i???a??
kar, I would arguethat the original form was indeed i???a??
karand the form vi???a??
kar probablyresulted from a reanalysis of a manuscript line such as tuyi??????a???avi???a??
karm??tta???a??
ka????????um?? in Kampar??m??ya???am Kitkint?? K????????amK??rk??lappa???alam published in 1862 as shown in Attachment 2, where ???v- is a glide resulting from themorphophonemics of joining tuyi??????a???aending in -a and i???a??
kar beginning in i-.When the words in the quoted line are separated, the word in question is takenas i???ankar as can be seen in http://tinyurl.com/kd756qp .)
 
Even ifone accepts the form vi???a??
kar to beearlier, in the 16th century text, the word 'vi???a??
kar' is used inconnection with crocodile-elephant encounter. Since gharials are not known toattack even human beings  (http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_ggan.htm), it is doubtful if they are biologicallyequipped to attack big elephants.   Even in the Ma???im??kalai (6th century CE), themoat around K????nciwas described as having crocodiles indicated by the term i???a??
kar, whichmeans that i???a??
kar cannot be identified as gharial.  (As gharials do not attack human beings, they would not have beenused in moats, which were designed to ward off attacks by hostile warriors.) So the case of vi???a??
kar/i???a??
karrepresenting gharial is not defensible.
 
Conclusions
In myopinion, Ganesan's etymologies for Sanskrit makara and nakra/n??kraare not supported by comparative Dravidian linguistic evidence or Tamilphilology. Also, his etymological interpretation of Tamil vi???a??
kar/i???a??
karis not supported by Tamil philology. 
 
InJanuary 2012 Ganesan stated that the article had been published in "Prof.V. I. Subramonium commemoration volume, ISDL, Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala,2011". Later, in February 2013 he stated that the article had been publishedin "Prof. V. I. Subramonian Memorial Volume, International School ofDravidian Linguistics, 2011, (Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala)". InternationalJournal of Dravidian Linguistics, Volume 39, Issue 2 published in June 2010 wascalled "PROFESSOR V. I. SUBRAMONIAM MEMORIAL VOLUME" as can be seen inAttachment 3. Ganesan's article was not included in that volume. Nor was itpublished in the IJDL issues of 2011. There was no commemoration volumepublished by ISDL in 2011. 
 
However,there is going to be a separate Professor V. I. Subramoniam CommemorationVolume that will be published in June 2015 during the 43rd annual conference ofDravidian Linguistics Association to be held in Annamalai University in TamilNadu. (For conference details, see http://www.ijdl.org/Html/announcement_43.pdf.) Ganesan???sarticle might be included in Professor V. I. Subramoniam Commemoration Volume.
 
Iwould appreciate any comments from the list members.
 
Thankyou in advance.
