Let me respond to North-South part here, second syllable rhyming part in
the next post.

1. dakshiNAnila for malyAnila is a usage found throughout Sanskrit

2. Bhatrihari mentions dAkShiNAtyas in

?? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? /

????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????????? // ?????_????? //


similar mention of dAkShiNAtya, dakShiNa may be remembered by other
list members.
