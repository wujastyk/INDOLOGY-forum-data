Dear Indologists,


Happy new year to all!


In his blog post, http://nganesan.blogspot.com/2013/02/dravidian-etymology-for-makara.html , N.Ganesan says, "'A Dravidian etymology for Makara - crocodile' was my second article on the crocodile cult in Indus vaelley and the genesis of Makara in Indic art traditions. It is published in Prof. V. I. Subramonian Memorial Volume, International School of Dravidian Linguistics, 2011 (Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala)."  According to A. G. Menon's CV at http://dutchstudies-satsea.nl/auteur/178/AG-Menon.html, International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, volume 39, issue 2 published in 2010 (not 2011) was called V. I. Subramoniam Memorial Volume. I do not have access to the IJDL issues of 2010 or 2011. I would appreciate if anybody with access to IJDL volumes 39 and 40 could give the citation information for this article.


Thanks in advance


Regards,
S. Palaniappan
