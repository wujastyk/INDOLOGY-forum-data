Subject: [INDOLOGY] Amartya Sen and Asoka
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP21F997A16D0229EC161BB4BF870@phx.gbl>

In his book The Argumentative Indian Amartya Sen mentions the Asokan inscriptions several times. On p. 18 he quotes
"the translation presented by Vincent A. Smith in Asoka:The Buddhist Emperor of India ...except for some minor emendations based
on the original Sanskrit text" (note 26, p.360).
I am very puzzled by this. I admit I have only read Jules Bloch's Les inscriptions d'Asoka, which are translated from different Prakrit
inscriptions. I wonder where did Amartya Sen find "the Sanskrit original"? Has anybody else seen it? I very much would like to see 
"the original Sanskrit".
