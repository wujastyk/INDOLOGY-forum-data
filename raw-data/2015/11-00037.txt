Dear All,

Many names?many authors were versatile. 

Annambhatta (16th CE)
vachaspati Mishra 
Raghavendra Yati (16th CE)
Vijayaeendra Tirtha (15th CE)
Abhinavagupta 
Krishnavadhuta Pandita (19th CE)
mallinatha 
Bellankonda Ramaraya kavi 
Shriharsha

Many of them authored works in one or two disciplines but involving many disciplines like Nyaya, Vyakarana, Vedanta, meemamsa etc. For example -

Sudarshana suri
Jayatirtha (14th CE)
Vyasatirtha (15th CE)
Madhusudana Saraswati (15th CE)

The authors participating in the series of dialectics of Nyayamrita-Advaitasiddhi are not only well-versed in many disciplines like Nyaya, Vyakarana, Meemamsa and Vedanta, but employed them in the dialectic works authored by them.

Likewise, the Nyaya and Vyakarana works on Semantics like Vyutpattivada, Vaiyakarana Bhushana Sara, Manjusha etc., require a good acquaintance of many disciplines. 

Stalwarts like Adi Shankara, Udayana, Jayanta Bhatta, Madhva, Jagannatha Pandita were not just limited to their domain. 

with best regards
