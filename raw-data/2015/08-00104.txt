Hello Will, 
I don't know what the Vedic studies folks think of this, but it seems that the source texts for Vedanta are the source texts- Prasthana trayi along with a number of other assorted texts including some regional texts also. Vedas are an original source, but they are not source texts. They are only referred when it was necessary to highlight original concepts, which was not very frequent. Nalayira divya prabandham is also original text. The original texts and source texts may have been used by later theologians without much concern for classifications.
Thank you, 
Lavanya
