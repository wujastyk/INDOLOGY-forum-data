Dear List,

what is the  Par?k??-parvan which is referred to several times in the Ny?yav?rttikat?tparya??k? of V?caspati Mi?ra, ad NS I 1 4-5-8-14, 2 15 (together with one Lak?a?a-parvan), and II introd. (by searching within the GRETIL input s.v.) and which seems to correspond to the ??bdapar?k??parvan referred to in the 6th chapter (Pram??a-p?r?ya?a,  pratyak?a-pariccheda/section) of ??likan?tha's Prakara?apa?cik?. Could this be referring to a book or section of the commentary on the NS by Uddyotakara, or to a work of Bhart?hari ?
Thank you for your help.

Christophe Vielle
