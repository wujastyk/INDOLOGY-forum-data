Subject: [INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences

It is about conventions. I have seen texts where a dIrgha 'A' followed by a
hrasva 'a' has been depicted by a single avagraha and dIrgha 'A' followed
by dIrgha 'A' are depicted by two avagrahas.

But that is not under question.
Earliest appearance of avagraha to split the words is under question.
Attaching another line from the same MS showing a true elision depicted by
avagraha.
See ???????????? at the end of first line.
