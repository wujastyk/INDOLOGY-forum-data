Dear Colleagues,

I would like to ask if perhaps anybody knows something
more about Govindan?tha from Kerala, the author of

?a?kara's hagiography - *?a?kar?c?ryacarita *also called

*Keral?ya-?a?karavijaya *(dated for ca. 17th century, although this dating is

rather doubtful)?
I would be really grateful for any information,

Olga Nowicka
