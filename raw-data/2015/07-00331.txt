Dominik,

	I did not at all mean to attribute rage to you. I apologize if I gave that impression. We have seen some rage here, but not from you.

Best,
Howard

That's what's so disappointing about Malhotra.  It's impossible to have a reasonable exchange with him.  He raises some worthwhile points, and many points that could be rather easily proven to be untenable.  But he provides no space for rational discussion and changing of minds.

If someone won't participate, or doesn't know how to, then they are at a huge disadvantage.  I'm afraid that's where Malhotra is.
