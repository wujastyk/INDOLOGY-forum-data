Subject: [INDOLOGY] Rigveda commentary
Message-ID: <A1EDC619-C0D1-4AFE-82AF-FA36F8DB9D71@austin.utexas.edu>

Dear colleagues,

As some of you know, Stephanie Jamison and I have been working on a more detailed and technical commentary on the Jamison-Brereton RV translation. The obvious place to put something like this is the web, since it can be posted piecemeal and updated to incorporate suggestions from the outside and second or third thoughts of the translators. We've been working with the UCLA Center for Digital Humanities, and the first installments (from Stephanie) are now up. Currently it includes comments on hymns from Ma??ala I up to I.115 and on the Indra hymns in VII and VIII; we expect the complete commentary to require some years. The site is

http://rigvedacommentary.alc.ucla.edu/

Please feel free to share this with anyone who might be interested.

The site is not set up not to receive comments, but we would welcome suggestions sent directly to either or both of us. If we incorporate them in the commentary, we will do so with due attribution.

Best wishes,
Joel Brereton
