I would be interested by a reference (which one is given by Kuddala?) to an edition of the Par??ara-Upapur??a.
The Par??ara-(Upa)pur??a, Par??ara-prokta / Par??arokta / P?r??ar(y)a  (Upapur??a) occurs in several lists of upapur??a (see R. C. Hazra Studies in the Upapur??as vol. 1, 1958, pp. 4-12), but Hazra, who should have deal with it in the 3rd unpublished vol. of his "Studies" (the one on the ?aiva upap.), does not give any reference nor comment on it, except the following footnote in vol. 1 p. 5 : "Thus the Par??ara-upapur??a seems to be distinguished from the Vi??u-p. or the spurious 'Vai??ava' (mentioned by Vall?lasena in his D?nas?gara, p. 7, verse 63), which was spoken out by Par??ara".
Through the EPB on-line (slip below), I see that a critical edition of the text was prepared but I don't think it was achieved.

 	 
Author	Gangadharan, N[ates]	 
Title	A brief note on the Par??arapur??a	 
Language	Engl.	 
Published	In: Pur??a 25,1, January 1983, p. 44-47	 
Description	Concise remarks on contents, extent, ?ivaite character, and upapur??a nature of the Par??arapur??a. Announces "a critical edition and analysis" of the text. The new Catalogus catalogorum seems to account for about fifty manuscripts of this Pur??a. (F)

Now I see through WorldCat that there is at least this edition by Kapiladeva Tripa?t?hi?: Pa?ra?s?aropapura?n?am (sami?ks?a?tmakam? sampa?danam), Va?ra?n?asi? : Sampu?rn?a?nanda Sam?skr?ta Vis?vavidya?laya, 1990. Sarasvati?bhavana-adhyayanama?la?, 40.

>      In his Sanskrit introduction to the first volume of the Nirnayasagara edition of Pata?jali's Vy?kara?a-Mah?bh??ya (1917, p. 16, fn 5), the editor Shivadatta Kuddala says that this verse is from Par??ara-Upapur??a.  The same source is given for the traditional definitions of S?tra and V?rttika. (Kudd?la, Intro, p. 12 and 14).  For the definition of S?tra, Kudd?la also refers to Vi???dharmottara (ibid, p. 12).  On p. 11 of his Introduction, Kudd?la quotes the following verse from Par??ara-Upapur??a:
>      p??in?ya? mah???stra? padas?dhutvalak?a?am /
>      sarvopak?raka? gr?hya? k?tsna? ty?jya? na ki?cana //
