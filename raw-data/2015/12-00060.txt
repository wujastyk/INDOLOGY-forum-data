Dear Nagaraj,

An important source for these kinds of Vedic interpretation is the very old
*Nirukta*. There, Y?ska contrasts the adhidaivatam interpretation with the
adhy?tmam interpretation at 3.12, 10.26, 12.37, 12.38, 13.11, 14.12, 14.13,
14.14, 14.15, 14.16, 14.18, 14.19, 14.21, 14.23, 14.24, 14.25, and 14.27.
He contrasts the adhiyaj?am interpretation with the adhidaivatam
interpretation at 11.4. A term such as adhibh?tam or ?dhibhautikam is not
used by Y?ska.


Vasudeva S. Agrawala wrote about the adhy?tma interpretation of the Vedas
in his early article, ?The Vedas and Adhy?tma Tradition,? in *Indian
Culture*, vol. 5, no. 3, January 1939, pp. 285-292. I have scanned this
article and posted it here:
http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/Vedas-and-Adhy%C4%81tma-Tradition.pdf.
He later applied the adhy?tma interpretation to some Vedic hymns and themes
in four English books, and several journal articles. The four books are:


Sparks from the Vedic Fire [A New Approach to Vedic Symbolism]. Varanasi:
School of Vedic Studies, Banaras Hindu University, 1962.


Vedic Lectures [Proceedings of the Summer School of Vedic Studies],
May-June 1960. Varanasi: School of Vedic Studies, Banaras Hindu University,
1963.


Hymn of Creation (N?sad?ya S?kta, ?igveda X.129). Varanasi: Prithivi
Prakashan, 1963.


The Thousand-Syllabled Speech [Being a Study in Cosmic Symbolism in Its
Vedic Version]: I. Vision in Long Darkness, Introduction and Analysis, Text
and Translation of the Asya-V?m?ya S?kta of ?ishi D?rghatamas (?igveda
1.164.1-52). Varanasi: Ved?ra?yaka Ashram, 1963.


This last book must be considered his magnum opus on this topic. In it he
gives a sustained and detailed interpretation of this difficult Vedic hymn
according to the adhy?tma interpretation. To do this, he draws the meanings
of terms from the Vedic writings, especially the Br?hma?as.
