Sri Nityanand Mishraji highlights many other chitrakaviva and alankAra
aspects of both gopIgItam and bhArgavarAghavIyam.
Following is from his post:

Please see entry number 4 on page 179 in my second prosody appendix
(Appendix II) of the ?r?bh?rgavar?ghav?yam. I have attached the scan of the
page, the PDF can be downloaded here ?

??????? is ? ? ? ? ? x 4, with the caesura (???) after the sixth syllable.
Another name of the metre is ?????????.
