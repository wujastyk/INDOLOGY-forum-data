Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have access to the journal with the article noted below 
(page numbers regrettably unknown), which I cannot track down anywhere 
in Britain.  I would very much appreciate firstly confirmation of the 
accuracy of the reference and secondly, if possible, a PDF of the article.

Worsley, Peter 2009: ?Cosmopolitan vernacular culture and illustrations 
of the R?ma story at Ca??i Loro Jonggrong, Prambanan?, in /Sadur: 
Sejarah Terjemahan di Indonesis dan Malaysia,/ed. by Henri Chambert-Loir 
(Jakarta: Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia).
