One may also see my paper titled ?Brahmanical Temples, Ma?has, Agrah?ras and a Buddhist Establishment in a Marshy and Forested Periphery of Two ?Frontier? States: Early Mediaeval Surma Valley (Sylhet and Cachar), c. 600 CE?1100 CE?. This paper was published in Religions of South Asia, Vol. 6, no.1 , 2012. Religions of South Asia is an international peer-reviewed journal, published by Equinox Publications, London. This paper analyses the complex pattern of interaction between religion, agrarian expansion , detribalisation and the evolution of a local state in the most forested and marshiest part of early medieval Bengal.

 Niranjan,
 
 You might find Thomas Trautmann's Elephants and Kings: An
 Environmental History (Oxford 2015) helpful.
 
 Best,
 Mark

 Dear Tyler,
 
 Thank you so much for pointing out to me these two works on
 environmental history of India. While I need to prepare a
 half page write-up on the subject in a day or two, I'll see
 what ready-made material I could look at (for the time
 being).
 
 Best,
 Niranjan

 Dear Niranjan,
 
 Kalyanakrishnan Sivaramakrishnan and Mahesh Rangarajan have
 edited a
 two volume environmental history of India that, while not
 always
 dealing directly with the question of knowledge systems,
 often touches
 upon them.? It might be a good starting point for
 finding references.
