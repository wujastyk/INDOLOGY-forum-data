Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vartika data request
Message-ID: <CADSGPzWeqtdWSH5H3Bz2N7aVp+c41Te8Qi-ZYGGsHHFJyCh=jg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
Sorry for cross posting.
I need the Vartika number and Vartika in digital format (.txt, .xls, .csv
or any other kind of  database etc)
Something similar to
http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/.

I would be grateful for any pointers.
