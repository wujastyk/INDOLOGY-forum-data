Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tukaram and the name Tuka

I think Marathi tuk?/tukaa is related to Skt (stoka -->) toka, meaning 'little one, child'. The final vowel has been lengthened in Tukaa-raama as in several other Marathi names aatmaaraama (<-- aatma(n) + raama), dattaaraama (<-- datta + raama), raajaaraama (<-- raaja(n) + raama), ;saantaaraama (<-- ;saanta + raama), perhaps also sakhaaraama (<-- sakha <-- sakhi(n) + raama), baataarama (<-- baat(a) + raama), thaapaaraama (<-- thaap(a) + raama) and ma:ngaaraama/ma:nghaaraama. 

Semantically, the formation of Tukaa-raama, meaning 'Little/young/younger Raama", would be similar to that in: Hindi "Cho.taalaala/Cho.telaala", English "Little Johny?, etc. 

I think it is more likely that the name of the sant(a)/saint has made the name Tukaa-raama popular, not the name of the deity Tukaa.ii.

(Or perhaps after the goddess -- is it a name used by both sexes?) And second, whether any Dravidian scholar on the list can confirm or deny the development ?ukra > tukka (in one or more Dravidian languages -- I'm not sure the same sound laws apply everywhere).

>> Tuk?/Tuk?r?m is still a common personal name in Marathi.  While the origin of the name Tuk? is not quite clear, there is a popular goddess in Maharashtra named Tu?j? Bhav?n?, also known as Tuk?i (Tuk? + ?i), where "?i" is the Marathi word for mother, and the first part "Tuk?" in her name is explained traditionally as being made up of "tu" (you) + "k?" (why), and there is a story saying someone asked this goddess "why did you come, O Mother", which gave her the name Tuk?i. Another explanation I have heard is that "tukka" is the Dravidian form of Sanskrit ?ukra, and since Friday (?ukrav?ra) is auspicious for this goddess, she came to be known as Tukk?i. While this may not be a true historical explanation of the name Tuk?i, the name of this goddess may have made the name Tuk? popular in Maharashtra.
