> I am looking for Sanskrit authors who have written about many (>=3)

> Further requirements:
> 1) Authorship of their works should be consolidated in Indological research.
> 2) Texts should not be too short.
> 3) Texts should not be collections of former works or of citations  
> only, but "really" be written by these authors.
> 4) The older, the better!
> 5) Texts should be edited or - even better - already digitized.

> The first (and actually only) author that came to my mind is
