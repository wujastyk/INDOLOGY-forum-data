A Detailed Reply to a Joker?s ?Review? of my Book. 

? 

Shrikant G Talageri. 

? 

? 

Niraj Mohanka has, on 10 th April 2010, sent me, presumably to elicit some reaction from me, the following comments by Arnaud Fournet made during the course of a discussion on an internet discussion site IndiaArchaeology at yahoogroups.com .: 

? 

? This book proves nothing but that Talageri still has a very long way to go before he understands what the issues are about and how to write a book?. I suggest you read again the review I wrote nearly one year ago. I read it again recently and I see little to change? For the time being, nobody addressed the real issues contained in the review and keeps on dreaming on never-exist fairytales ?. 

? 

Fournet refers here to a ?review? he had published on www.scribd.com on 22 nd May 2009 ? that is nearly a year ago, of my third book ?The Rigveda and the Avesta ? The Final Evidence? (Aditya Prakashan, New Delhi , 2008). I had read this ?review? at that time itself; but, after the initial reactive indignation that I naturally felt after reading a pointless and pompous diatribe against my book written in a jeering and sneering tone, I soon realized that there was really nothing to ?reply? to in that ?review?: it was so utterly pointless and irrelevant. [Later, I was informed that another, even more vicious and vindictive, review had been written in a Bangalore journal by an Indian writer who has had his knife in me since quite some time. I did not think that other review even worth procuring and reading]. I decided at that time that I really could not waste my time replying to every Tom, Dick and Harry of a writer who chose to vent his spite and venom on my book or on myself just to satisfy his itching fingers, unless he really had something concrete to say about the data, facts and evidence contained in my book . Sad to say, Fournet?s review had nothing concrete at all to say about my book , and did not really merit any serious reply. 

? 

But it appears Fournet is under the impression that his ?review? has silenced me and others like me who choose to keep on ? dreaming on never-exist [sic] fairytales ?. And perhaps friendly readers would like or expect me to give some reply. So I am writing this ?reply? in order to clarify once and for all as to what would constitute a genuine review of my book which would merit a reply from me ; and the best way of doing this is by giving a counter-review of Fournet?s ?review? of my book, to demonstrate how there are absolutely no ? real issues ? at all ? contained in the review ?, however fondly Fournet, egged on by the Farmer-Witzel pack of jokers, may be under the impression that he has managed to fool everyone into believing that there are . In fact, Fournet?s review really shows him up as being a joker par excellence. 

? 

First, let me clarify what my book is all about. The core heart of this book is the first section which presents absolutely new and absolutely conclusive evidence about the chronology (relative, internal and absolute) and the geography of the Rigveda and the Avesta. This evidence itself is enough to smash the AIT into smithereens and to prove the OIT; or, at the very least, to make it clear that it would require complete and extremely radical amendments to the AIT to produce a new version of an AIT which would try to accommodate all these chronological and geographical factors into a non-Indian homeland theory. The second section of the book only dots all the ?i?s and crosses all the ?t?s (often repeating material from my second book along with an array of new evidence and logical arguments) in order to show how the OIT alone fulfils all the requirements and solves all the problems of the IE Homeland question. Any discussion on the second section can only follow a discussion on the first section of my book. 

? 

The first section of my book proves beyond the shadow of any doubt that 1) the period of composition of the latest parts of the Rigveda (latest not only according to my criteria but according to the internal chronology accepted by consensus among western academicians) goes back into the late third millennium BCE at the latest, 2) that the proto-Iranians and the proto-Mitanni emigrated from India during the period of composition of these latest parts, and 3) that the proto-Iranians and the pre-Mitanni Indo-Aryans, in the periods preceding this late period, i.e. in the periods preceding the late third millennium BCE at the latest, were inhabitants of areas to the east of the Sapta Sindhava region with little or no prior acquaintance with areas to the west. 

? 

This is proved, not on the basis of empty rhetoric of the kind which characterizes Fournet?s pathetic ?review?, but on the basis of pages and pages and pages of detailed and complete (i.e. non-partisan ) data, facts and evidence ? concrete evidence which can be verified or else can be exposed if false. 

? 

Only and only after this evidence in the first section of my book is discussed, and either conclusively proved wrong (with the help of an alternate, and equally detailed and complete, analysis of the chronological and geographical data in the Rigveda and the Avesta), or accepted but within an attempted alternate AIT hypothesis, can any discussion spill over into the second section of the book. 

? 

This reply to Fournet?s ?review? of my book will have three sections: 

? 

I. The Real Issues contained in the first section of my book. 

II. The ?Real Issues? in Fournet?s ?review?. 

III. Postscript: How to write a review. 

? 

First, let us see how Fournet deals with the core ? real issues ? contained in my book. 

? 

? 

I. The Real Issues contained in the first section of my book. 

? 

The first section of my book is loaded with detailed masses of concrete data covering all the possible occurrences of a large number of categories of words in the Rigveda, relevant to the historical analysis of the Rigveda and the Avesta, complete with hymn and verse numbers. This is solid data, arranged systematically in tables, charts and lists, the veracity of which can be verified or disproved with very little effort . The text of the chapters very systematically explains the logical significance of the detailed charts and lists, and the very precise conclusions that can be drawn from this data. This data, and the conclusions which automatically and logically flow out from it, constitute the crux of the first section of the book , but Fournet totally fails or refuses to even glance at this data and evidence: in fact, he finds that there are ? frequent interruptions of the text by copious references to the hymns and verses of the Rig-Veda and by lists of names or nouns. Many of these references should have been preferably dealt with otherwise, so that the reasoning and the text of the author would not be constantly chopped [?] All these textual and typographic features are hindrances for the reader to understand what the writer wants to say and sometimes to find the text itself amidst the references ? (notwithstanding that ?the reasoning and the text of the author? and ?what the writer wants to say? are based solely on these copious references and wordlists rather than on empty rhetoric!). And, again, about chapter 1, ? About half the pages are references which could be synthesized and organized otherwise as annexes ?, and about chapter 2, ? Most of this part is references or tables ?. 

? 

But, in spite of having all these concrete masses of references and data, along with detailed explanations about their meaning and import, virtually thrust on him in the main body of the text rather than in extraneous and avoidable annexes, Fournet resolutely ignores it all, and sums up his conclusions about the chapters on the basis of vague, impressionistic and opinionated comments which totally fail to make even the pretence of an examination of any part of the data or even to take it into consideration: 

? 

Chapter 1 gives a complete analysis of the names and name elements common to the Rigveda and the Avesta, and shows how the major body of these names and name elements (and, incidentally, even various categories of compound word types which form these name elements), which form the common cultural elements in the two books, are found right from the earliest hymns of the Avesta (the Gathas) but are found in the Rigveda only in the Late Books and hymns: precisely, in 386 hymns in the Late Books I, V, VIII-X, but in only 8 hymns in the Early and Middle Books II-IV, VI-VII ( all 8 of which are classified by the western scholars as Late hymns within these earlier books!). Fournet sweeps aside this overpowering data, without examination, with the remark: ? We have no particular opinion about the conclusion and the method used to reach it. We tend to think that this point is not as crucial as the author seems to believe ?; 

? 

Chapter 2 gives a complete typological analysis of all the meters used in the Rigveda, along with an analysis of the chronological evolution of the meters, and shows how the meters used in the Gathas, the earliest part of the Avesta, are meters which in the Rigveda had evolved only by the time of the Late Books of the Rigveda. Fournet, again sweeps aside this concrete data, without examination, with the remark: ? This chapter is abstruse and it is hard to figure what these statistics actually prove ?. 

? 

Chapter 3 examines the geographical data in the Rigveda in complete detail, and shows how the Vedic Aryans in the periods of the Early and Middle Books of the Rigveda, i.e. in the periods before the development of the common Indo-Iranian culture which took place in the period of the Late Books of the Rigveda, were located to the east of the Punjab, with little, if any, knowledge of areas to the west . Again, without examining any of the copious data given, Fournet dismisses the inevitable conclusions arising from this data with the evasive remark: ? Ultimately, the conclusions drawn from the Rig-Veda depend on the relative chronology chosen or determined for the books. Circularity is a permanent risk ?. 

? 

Thus, Fournet sweepingly dismisses the copious data in chapters 1 and 2, without examination , on the ground that it is not ? crucial ? or that it is ? hard to figure out ?. 

? 

Worse, he dismisses the copious data in chapters 1, 2 and 3 on the additional ground that the conclusions drawn are not acceptable since the veracity of these conclusions ? depend on the relative chronology chosen and determined for the books ?, and that different scholars have proposed different chronological orders for books II-VII from the one proposed by me in my books (which is VI, III, VII, IV, II, V). Fournet simply refuses to examine, or even to consider, all that copious data, and simply dismisses my conclusions with a contemptuous Gallic shrug, and the escapist remarks: ? We do not have the expertise to determine which order (or if another one) should be preferred. [?.] These philological technicalities should be addressed and discussed by competent specialists of the field ?, 

? 

Here, he deliberately ignores the fact that Chapter 4 of my book makes it very clear that the veracity of the conclusions drawn by me in the first section of my book does not in any way depend on my own chronological order for books II-VII. The conclusions actually stand confirmed purely on the basis of the consensus among academic scholars (the ? competent specialists of the field ?) that the family books II-VII are older than the non-family books I VIII IX X, and that, of books II-VII, book V is closer to books I VIII IX X than to the other family books, so that we get two distinct groups of books on the basis of a near consensus among academic scholars: an earlier group consisting of books II III IV VI VII and a later group consisting of books V I VIII IX X. Fournet himself confirms the major part of this consensus classification: ? All agree that the books I VIII IX X are the most recent and disagree about the order of the other six ones, admittedly the oldest ?. And the fact is that all the ? copious references to the hymns and verses of the Rig-Veda ? and all the ? lists of names or nouns ? which Fournet regards as ? frequent interruptions of the text ? in my book, and as data to be ignored or dismissed, fall into two distinct and clear cut categories in their patterns of distribution in the Rigveda in line with these very two groups of books. Therefore, even without the help of ? competent specialists of the field ?, even Fournet should have been able to verify whether my conclusions are right or wrong by simply checking the veracity of my data. 

? 

Fournet?s remarks on Chapter 5 are even more surprising. In Chapter 5 , I have clearly shown how all the Mitanni name types are found only and exclusively in the later group of books (V I VIII IX X in 112 hymns) and missing in the earlier group of books (II III IV VI VII, except in 1 hymn classified by western academic scholars as a late hymn in these earlier books). Fournet does not just find my conclusion (that the data shows that the Mitanni IA language is younger than the earlier parts of the Rigveda) unconvincing, but he finds that ? If any conclusion can be drawn out of these data, we would conclude that they prove the Rig-Veda, as a whole, is younger than this Mitanni Indo-Aryan-oid language, contrary to the author?s claim ?! How on earth, given that even he accepts that ? all agree ? that books I VIII IX X are ? the most recent ?, does he find that ? these data ? ? which clearly show that the ? Mitanni Indo-Aryan-oid ? names are found only in this ? most recent ? group of books, and are totally missing in the books which are ? admittedly the oldest ? ? without any examination to disprove the veracity of the data, lead to the conclusion that ? the Rig-Veda, as a whole, is younger than this Mitanni Indo-Aryan-oid language, contrary to the author?s claim ?? Just how does this joker?s brain function? 

? 

So far, discussions on the Indo-European question have been based only on rhetoric and airy assumptions. When references from the Rigveda have formed any part of the evidence presented by either the OIT side or the AIT side, they have consisted mainly of stray references picked up from the text, interpreted by adding all kinds of values absent in the actual words, and made the starting points or first links of chains of similar interpretations one leading to the other and ending in momentous conclusions which bear no direct connection with the original references cited. Many of the astronomical interpretations of Vedic references cited by OIT writers fall in this category. The textual ?evidence? for the AIT as a whole is almost entirely based on such interpretations: the most telling example is the way one stray word, an?s , occurring just once in the whole of the Rigveda and never again after that in any other text, was taken as a-n?s rather than an-?s which it actually was, translated as ?nose-less? and further interpreted as ?snub-nosed?, and consequently treated in countless scholarly works over two centuries of western Vedic scholarship as evidence that the alleged native non-Aryan Indians, whom the alleged Aryan invaders/immigrants encountered when they allegedly entered India, were ?snub-nosed?. 

? 

The data and statistics which fill the first section of my book to the overflowing ? the ? copious references to the hymns and verses of the Rig-Veda ? and all the ? lists of names or nouns ? which Fournet regards as ? frequent interruptions of the text ? in my book ? form the very crux of my book and of the evidence presented by me. They consist of complete lists of concrete words (i.e. words taken in their accepted literal meanings, rather than with symbolic or value-added meanings) of different categories (including personal names, and names of animals, rivers, etc.), and the particular picture consistently depicted by the very regular pattern of distribution itself, of these words (as also of other data like meters), forms the crux of the evidence. 

? 

The summary of this evidence is spelt out so clearly (in the section entitled ?What the Evidence Shows?, pp. 43-49 of my book) that even a half-witted person, if he took care to actually read the section instead of writing an abusive ?review? based only on his predetermined agenda, should have been able to understand it. And the inevitability of the conclusions drawn by me from this evidence is also spelt out so clearly (in the section entitled ?Can this Evidence be refuted?? on pp.135-142 of my book) that any reviewer without sand in his brains ( if , of course, he had bothered to read and understand what I have written) would have thought ten times before being so summary in his dismissal of the evidence without examination. 

? 

There is only one Rigveda (as there is only one Avesta, and one known and limited treasury of Mitanni words), so it is not really possible to challenge this evidence by citing alternative equally complete lists of words showing a different regular pattern and therefore a different picture; but a genuine critic would have examined the actual lists given by me in detail to check the extent to which they are genuine and complete, and to which they do indeed show the pattern of distribution claimed by me and justify the historical and geographical conclusions reached by me, and would have based any criticism on such an examination . However, Fournet completely shuns examining this copious data which conclusively establishes the chronology of the composition of the Rigveda as going back into the late third millennium BCE and beyond for the beginnings of the latest parts, and, almost like a joke, merely reiterates the incredible (in view of all the data in the first section of my book) proposition: ? The standard traditional time bracket from -1500 to -1000 BC for the composition of the Rig-Veda disqualifies the OIT as constructed by the author ?! 

? 

Fournet, like Witzel before him in his criticism of my earlier book, shows the same utter contempt for concrete references, data and statistics, and the same total reliance on mockery and on empty rhetoric. What Fournet proves in this review, as we shall see in detail, is that the only way in which writers like him, including Witzel before him and other likely critics after him, can afford or dare to deal with my book is by completely ignoring the copious references, data, statistics, and other hard evidence actually presented by me, and the conclusions which unavoidably proceed from this material, and by substituting jeering rhetoric for analytical reasoning. The fact is not that ? nobody addressed the real issues contained in the review ?; the fact (to put it crudely but accurately) is that polemicists like Fournet and Witzel just simply do not have the guts in their balls to address the ? real issues ? in my book. 

? 

Any review which steadfastly avoids dealing with the concrete data overflowing on every page of the first section of my book ? avoids examining all the data and either showing that significant portions of that data are false, or showing convincingly that the data leads to conclusions other than those drawn by me ? is a Big Zero , howsoever much the reviewer may pat himself on the back (and have his back patted by like-minded jokers) that he has effectively made mincemeat of my book merely on the basis of a barrage of rhetoric, polemics and derision. Fournet?s ?review? is nothing but a joke played by a sick joker to win the gleeful applause of other like-minded jokers. 

? 

It is up to the reader to read both my book (the reading of which Fournet claims his review renders unnecessary) as well as Fournet?s ?review? and to decide for himself: 

? 

a) what exactly the ? real issues contained in the review ? are, and whether they really require to be addressed at all; and also whether or not Fournet himself has in fact addressed the very real issues in my book in his ?review?, and 

? 

b) whether it is I who do not understand ? how to write a book ? (and have to learn ? how to write a book ? from this joker), or whether it is Fournet who does not understand how to read a book, or how to understand what he is reading even when it is set out in plain English. 

? 

? 

II. The ?Real Issues? in Fournet?s ?review?. 

? 

Fournet steadfastly refuses to examine the masses and masses of concrete, complete and verifiable data in the form of references, data, facts, statistics and evidence given in the first section of my book, presumably on the ground that they do not constitute ? real issues ?. So what exactly are the ? real issues ? he is ?reviewing? in his ?review?? 

? 

The ? real issues ? in Fournet?s ?review? are all purely pedantic and polemical issues, and the review by and large consists of a series of monologues consisting of long, convoluted and extremely confused polemical discussions on different subjects: e.g. the phrases ?AIT? and ?OIT?, the concept of ?Indo-Iranian?, the concept of ?Indo-European?, the phrase ?develop?, and the concept of cultural change and transformation. The rest of the ?review? is devoted to a pedantic criticism of the book as a whole. The monologues, as well as the rest of the ?review?, consist mainly of detailed semantic discussions on the meanings of different words and concepts and Freudian psycho-analyses of my alleged basic misuse or misunderstanding of these words and concepts. 

? 

Before examining the ? real issues ? raised by Fournet, it is necessary to understand two very basic aspects of Fournet?s ?review? which become clear from every word and line written by him: 

? 

First of all, it is clear that Fournet?s ?review? is not written with the intention of seriously examining what I have written in my book: it is written with the sole and only aim of sneering and jeering at anything and everything written in the book, and ridiculing and deriding my hypothesis and my person. This will become clear as we proceed with our examination. 

? 

Secondly, it is also clear that Fournet?s ?review? is based on the principle that ?ignorance is bliss?; or rather, that ?ignorance is power?, since it removes all ethical, moral and logical inhibitions and constraints in criticizing and deriding. 

? 

Thus, Fournet sees no need to acquaint himself with any of the basic background material behind the book, and proudly proclaims his ignorance almost as a qualification: to begin with, he has not only not read my earlier books, but he finds that ? The book does not require any prior reading of the two other books by the same author, which were on the same topic ?. In the same vein: ? We are not a specialist in Vedic or Indo-Iranian studies ?; ? Before reading the book, we had about no expertise on the OIT, apart from the vague idea that the OIT tries to promote India as a possible homeland of the Proto-Indo-European language ?; ? we would have appreciated to see what evidence in the Rig-Veda substantiates the claim of ?a mighty Sarasvat? in full powerful flow?. Be it right or wrong, and we have no opinion, such a claim requires to be duly documented and proved by a philological analysis, and this analysis is lacking ?; ? the tribe names, Druhyus, Anus and P?rus ? we have not checked that point ? [?] The pages (258-273) are dedicated to an outpour of considerations on typically Indian cultural items, among which the Druhyus, Anus and P?rus ?tribal conglomerates?. We are not familiar with these items and we cannot describe what added value this section of the book might bring. ?; ? The book ends with the evocation of the ? Battle of the Ten Kings? (p.370). We must confess to having never read or heard what this epical event is ?. 

? 

Can a person who has not read the two earlier books ? on the same topic ? by me, who knows little about Vedic or Indo-Iranian studies, who knows virtually nothing about the OIT, who knows so little about the Rigveda that he does not know that the Rigveda speaks of a mighty Sarasvat? in full powerful flow, and has never heard about Druhyus, Anus and P?rus, or about the Battle of the Ten Kings, presume to write a review of my third book which claims to be the Final Evidence on the subject of Vedic and Indo-Iranian history (within four days of receipt of the book: he received it on 18/5/2009, while the ?review? was first posted on 22/05/2009) ? a ?review? claiming to be so accurate (? accurate enough for people to assess what the book is, when they have not read it themselves ?) that it can eliminate the need for his reader to expect anything more substantial or illuminating from a direct perusal of the book? 

? 

As we proceed with our examination of his critique, it will be clear from his criticism not only a) that he is proudly ignorant about all the background issues which form the topic of my three books, b) that he has not read what I have written in my two earlier books with which this third book forms a continuum, and c) that, even as far as this third book itself is concerned, he has completely ignored all the masses of ? frequent interruptions of the text ? in the form of references, data and statistics; but also, d) that he has not bothered or seen the need to really read even the ? text ? of this third book, beyond searching for passages for quotation, or scouring the text to count the number of times I have used certain words, or checking out which words are ?missing? in my book, or hunting out words which he can subject to a long discussion in order to allege a semantically wrong use of those words by me ? the most telling testimony to this is the fact that he comes across any reference to the Battle of the Ten Kings for the first and last time only in the last paragraph of my book (p.370) ! e) that even the portions he has quoted often include only parts of sentences, wherein his criticism shows that he has not read the other parts of the very sentences that he is actually quoting, and f) that even when he quotes full sentences, he is not able to understand what he has read and quoted. 

? 

All this makes it all the more of a joke when he tries to copy Witzel?s tactic of listing out things which I ?do not know? and ?have not mentioned? in order to show my alleged ignorance about the subject or my alleged failure to understand the issues involved. 

? 

Now an examination of Fournet?s ? real issues ?, which will help us to understand his agenda and his methods, as also to comprehend the psychological and intellectual level of his ?review?: 




? 

1. The smell and colour of my book : The first ? real issue ? for Fournet, is the smell and colour of my book: ? The first contact with the book has reminded us of a Sanskrit grammar we bought in China some years ago and which is our main source on that language: Fan Yu KeBen. The size, the smell, the pages, both whitish and yellowish, have kindled the same impression ?. The smell and colour of the book (which I at least do not find notably different from the smell and colour of the books published by any normal western publishing house: if anything, Aditya Prakashan books are notably better than most of them) are obviously ? real issues ? more worthy of notice and comment than the copious ? interruptions ? in the form of references, data and statistics. 

? 

? 

2. Review-politics : Even the very fact that the book was sent to him for review by Koenraad Elst is a ? real issue ? worthy of snide comment. Fournet takes care to inform us at the very outset of the ?review? that the book has been reviewed more or less as a favour to Koenraad Elst: ? The copy, received 05/18/2009, was sent by Koenraad Elst, a personal friend of the author, after we accepted his proposal to (try to) review it. For the sake of courtesy, we had proposed that our review could be read by the author before being made public, but this proposal has been rejected by K. Elst. We have never had direct contact with the author .? Fournet ends his ?review? with the remark: ? We are still wondering why K. Elst has proposed that we (try to) make a review of Mr. Shrikant Talageri?s book. We are not sure that our review is what they have expected. ? 

? 

Koenraad Elst, at my own general request in the first flush of publication of the book, proposed sending my book for possible review to various people. That is the standard procedure when a new book is published, when a debate or discussion is sought to be initiated on the contents of the book. The proposed reviewer, naturally, always has the right, for whatever reason or even without assigning any reason, to refuse to review the book; or, if he reviews it, to criticize it in all legitimate terms (and even, I suppose, if that is his nature, in illegitimate terms). What distinguishes Fournet is his unique and peculiar code of ? courtesy ? whereby he reviews the book, but at the same time takes care to suggest in the body of his review a) that the review is more or less being undertaken almost as a favour, b) that the author was indirectly offered the chance to read the review before it was made public (perhaps in the expectation that the author would be so terrified on reading his devastating critique that he would desperately plead for a kinder review, and this plea could also then be jeeringly publicized in the body of the ?review? when finally published?), c) that the author and his friend confidently expected a glowingly favourable review and would probably be embarrassed at it turning out to be a critical one after all, and d) that he himself is ultimately mystified as to why he was ever approached at all to do the review (but not, apparently, about why he did ultimately review it!). In truth, I am equally mystified on this point. On being asked, Koenraad told me that Fournet was a writer with ?unconventional? ideas, and therefore he (Koenraad) felt that he would be more receptive to ?new ideas?. Apparently Koenraad felt that having ?unconventional? ideas was a qualification of an open and honest mind, and also that this assumed qualification was sufficient to automatically eliminate the need to have the ability to read and the brains to understand what one is reading! 

? 

? 

3. Fournet?s mental trauma : The tumultuous emotions that raced through Fournet?s breast as he ploughed his way through the book is also another ? real issue ? eloquently placed before the readers. A sample: ?[?] In the course of reviewing the book, in the middle of the reading of section 2, we realized that the self-imposed goal of remaining neutral made increasingly no sense. We erased neutral and chose empathetic, because this word expresses open-mindedness without hostility or assent. After that, a deeper understanding of the way the author uses some key words and of their real meanings and implicit presuppositions made it clear that the word empathetic may be misinterpreted as a kind of implicit assent. We then opted from the somehow psychoanalytical anamnetic, which expresses our distantiated conviction that we have reached deeper and deeper layers of the mental construction of the author?s OIT: the explicit contents, the implicit framework, the key words and the political vested interests. During that process of anamnesis of the author?s version of the OIT, we have been successively disconcerted, assiduous, amazed and frightened [...]?. 

? 

The above, incidentally, is a representative sample of the style of the entire review, like that of an essay written by a school student for an elocution competition: pedantic and flowery language, with verbose and pompous words, phrases and sentences to be delivered with the right melodramatic pauses, intonations, expressions and gestures. 

? 

? 

4. Pedantry in academic writing : After his outpourings on his feelings while reading my book, Fournet turns to my bibliography, followed by my preface. A little later, he turns to the textual organization of the book and the fonts used by me. Still later, he refers to the maps in my book. At the end of his review, he refers to my index. We will take up these issues here ? bibliography, preface, textual organization, fonts, maps and index ? as they all fall in one broad category of incidental aspects of the book as distinct from the direct subject matter of the book in the form of data, facts, evidence and conclusions. 

? 

Since the facts, data, statistics and evidence given by me are to be ignored as non-issues , these become the ? real issues ? in his review. As in Witzel?s ?review? of my second book, every failure on my part to follow the reviewer?s views on the proper table manners and etiquette of academic writing (i.e. academic equivalences , in my writing, to a failure to use the right knife, fork or spoon while eating different dishes, to keep the cutlery and napkin in the right place, to start and to stop eating a particular course at the correct moment, to open and close my mouth in the right manner while eating, to chew the food the requisite number of times, to follow the correct rules of table conversation, to sit in the right position and at the correct angle, etc.) becomes a major ? real issue ?, and every comment by the ?reviewer? on each of these ?failures? becomes a devastating indictment of my book, of my theory, of the evidence presented by me, and of the OIT itself. It shows not only that I do not know ? how to write a book ?, but automatically also that I do not ? understand what the issues are about ?! 

? 

Since the criticisms are mainly pedantic or polemical, my reply to them will be on the same level: 

? 

My bibliography : Fournet begins by noting that the bibliography is ? very short for such an issue as the PIE homeland ?. This comment is superfluous since I have made the following clear statement in the preface: ? I have not adopted, and will never adopt, the fraudulent system of providing long bibliographies containing the name of every single book ever read by me (not to mention books not read by me but culled from the bibliographies of other books). The only books in my bibliography are those books actually quoted by me, and those referred to in any significant context ?. Fournet quotes only the last part of this statement, and takes comfort in thinking he has discovered the following which gives the lie to my claim: ? It must nevertheless be noted that Oldenberg. 1888. Prolegomena, are discussed and cited in the chapter 4 but do not appear in the bibliography ?. While it is true that Oldenberg?s Prolegomena not being included in the bibliography is an omission, it does not really give the lie to my claim: if Fournet had understood English, he would have realized that what would have given the lie to my claim is not omissions , but inclusions in my bibliography of books neither actually quoted by me nor referred to in any significant context. 

? 

Fournet continues: ? it contains very few works with a real linguistic content. Paradoxically, (historical) linguistics is nearly completely absent in a book that claims to deal with the issue of the PIE homeland ?. Here we see the familiar tactic of continuously demanding what is not in the book instead of examining what is actually there! Fournet shows clearly that he has totally failed to understand what my book is all about: the very title of the book indicates that the central topic of the book is a textual exegesis of the Rigveda and the Avesta, and this is the subject matter of the first section, which constitutes the bulk of my book. There is hardly any place for general linguistic discussions in this section. The second section of my book also has little place for books containing general discussions on linguistics, even Indo-European linguistics (indeed, the writings on every single technical aspect, and item of data, concerning every single branch of study of Indo-European linguistics, could fill out a number of encyclopaediac volumes or even a small library), except where they contained data, discussions or arguments pertaining to the debate on the geographical location of the Indo-European homeland, and relevant to the subjects under discussion . So, in view of my ethical refusal to fraudulently list out in my bibliography long lists of books read and unread just to show my erudition (take any article or paper by Witzel, for example, and see how many of the endless number of books listed in the bibliography really have any place in the concerned article), my bibliography contains just the right number of books dealing with (the relevant aspects of) linguistics. 

? 

After a critical reference to the book by Chang, 1988, quoted by me, Fournet resorts to the following year-wise analysis of the books in my bibliography: ? the years of publication of the 73 references listed in the bibliography are: before 1906 7 books, between 1907 and 1985 14, after 1986 52. We cannot believe that so little worth quoting has been written during the 80 years from 1906 to 1986 on the issue of the PIE homeland. What is more, 23 out of the 52 modern references are from Talageri himself or from Witzel ?. Fournet clearly has no idea at all what my book is about, not having seen the need to read it before reviewing it. Naturally, the majority of the books quoted are after 1986, since it is in the last twenty years that the Indo-European homeland question has hotted up, and all the various pros and cons of the AIT-vs.-OIT debate have been vigorously debated (and the linguistic aspects mainly by Witzel and myself, and also Hock as quoted in my book), including points and arguments made in earlier publications . The early foundations of Indological study go back mainly into the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, so again some books of that period are likely to be quoted. Given the subject matter of this book, very little indeed ? worth quoting has been written during the 80 years from 1906 to 1986 on the issue of the PIE homeland ?. In any case, I was not aware that scholarly etiquette demands that when quoting from different books, a writer is supposed to meticulously allot an impartial quota of an equal number of books for every year or decade!
