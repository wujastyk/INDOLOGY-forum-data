Hi Mark,

In addition to the other suggestions, you might read:

Minkowski, Christopher (2001). The Pundit as Public Intellectual: The Controversy over Virodha or Inconsistency in the Astronomical Sciences, in Axel Michaels (ed.), The Pundita: Traditional Sanskrit Scholarship in India. Heidelberg: South Asia Institute.
Minkowski, Christopher (2004). Competing Cosmologies in Early Modern Indian Astronomy, in Charles Burnett and Jan Hogendijk ( eds.), Studies in the History of the Exact Sciences in Honour of David Pingree. Leiden: Brill.
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen's The Siddh?ntasundara of J??nar?ja: A Critical Edition of Select Chapters with English Translation and Commentary, his PhD from Brown University (2008).

These contain references to David Pingree?s foundational work on Indian mathematics. 

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
