I'm having finger trouble today.  I meant to ask since the Gayatri mantra
from the Rg Veda, became so sacred I would have thought later gayatri
mantras would have followed its form, but they didn't, they followed the
form of  the later gayatri mantras from the  Taittiriya Aranyaka.
.... vidmahe
....dhimahI
....pracodayAt

Does any of the Sanskrit literature discuss this?

Thanks,

Harry Spier
