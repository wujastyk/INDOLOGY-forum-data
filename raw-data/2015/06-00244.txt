Dear Prof. Slaje,
A story of a rat (or mouse) killing a jackal is narrated in the Bilarajataka (Jataka 128), possibly with the intention to communicate the message that a week but good character can overcome a strong but bad one.

Kind regards,

Philipp Maas

This could have found various forms of expression, and the ??a??-sarpa-ny?ya? may very well have taken shape as a witty ad-hoc Sanskritization of internalized popular sayings. They might possibly draw on the behaviour of animals entirely different from hares and snakes. As stated initially, I was immediately reminded of Gandhiji?s ?violence of the mouse against the cat?. On second thoughts however ? inspired by the empirical evidence of the ?Go, Mr. Bunny, kill that snake!? video ? I have my doubts, whether such a ny?ya would be conceivable at all. Is it likely that a mouse behaves violently against a cat, and that observations of that kind had really been made? Could Jan possibly contribute a live video footage to solve this question? :-)

The female (Queen Ko?? from Kashmir) is compared to a mouse, to a (female) jackal, and to a bird respectively, her male opponents however to a cat and a lion. Guess, who wins! I for one failed to find traces of heroic courage in it.

>> Valerie: aren't black-naped hares (Lepus nigricollis), also known as Indian hares, native to India? As you may know, Dravidian languages have a non-IA word for rabbit/hare: *mucal/muyal (Telugu kund?lu is an interesting exception). Are there any other non-IE words for hare in other Indian languages? I think the words kharabhaka/ kharago?  (?????) 'donkey's ears'  are of recent origin, and perhaps have a Persian connection.

>> Elliot: You are right about the language in the video. It is indeed Telugu -- distinctly the Telangana variety. The kids are indeed speaking Americanized English. They must be one of the Telugu-American immigrant families.  
>> 
>> Walter:  I heard mah?nasa-?a?a-ny?ya (rabbit in the kitchen -- easy to catch) and ?a?a-vi???a-ny?ya (a hare's horn -- a term for an impossibility), but not the one you mentioned. I know ?a?i as moon  (in compound form for?a?in is moon), but not as a feminine form of ?a?a. Does any other Indian language show an equivalent of ?a??-sarpa-ny?ya?

I thought that rabbits were not native to India, and that the word ?a?a referred to a hare (the words ?hare? and ??a?a' probably being cognates). Of course, they may well behave in the same way when their young are threatened, but they are different species.

This might possibly materialize in the broader context of the 33rd Deutscher Orientalistentag to be held from the 18th to the 22nd of September 2017 in Jena, Germany (the domain of, among others, Otto von B?htlingk and the Schlegel brothers).

(BBC News India, 30 May 2014), it was claimed that ?Several studies have shown that women without toilets at home are vulnerable to sexual violence when travelling to and from public facilities or open fields. [...]?. One mother told researchers, ?We have had one-on-one fights with thugs in order to save our daughters from getting raped. It then becomes a fight that either you [the thug] kill me to get to my daughter, or you back off.?

The generalization here lies certainly in the fact that a (physically weaker) female (?a??) effectively fights a (physically stronger) male (sarpa). The latter would be the aggressor(s), the victim(s) the (female) bunny and/or her young.
