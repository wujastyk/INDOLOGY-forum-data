If Puranic sources are to be consulted, in stead of Chitrasutra which is
about painting the chapters of Matsyapurana

(252 The Vastu Deva; 253 Ascertaining of Vastu site for construction of
buildings etc. ; 254 The Vastu Vidya; 255 The Vastu Vidya; 256 The Vastu
Vidya; 257 The Vastu Vidya; 258 The measurements of limbs of the images of
the Devas, etc. ; 259 The characteristics of the images of the Devas; 260
The forms of the images of the several Devas and their characteristics; 261
The forms of Gods, etc. ; 262 The pedestals on which the Gods are placed;
263 The dimensions of the Phallus; 264 The consecration of the idols; 265
Adhivasana Vidhise; 266 Installation of an image; 267 The bathing of the
idol; 268 Propitiating the Vastu Deity; 269 The dimensions and related
characteristics of temples; 270 The characteristics of Mandapas;)

directly dealing with Vastu should be more useful.
