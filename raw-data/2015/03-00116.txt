Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mahabharata or Ramayana Ethics
Message-ID: <5516CE72.5000708@yorku.ca>

Dear List Members,

(Apologies for cross posting)

I am editing a volume on Indian Ethics for Bloomsbury Publishing. Our 
own Ram-Prasad Chakravarthi is the editor of the series that this volume 
is in.

Our list of contributors are great, and we have many submissions in on 
the /dar?ana /front. However, due to some unforeseen circumstances, the 
volume is now missing papers on:

  * Ethics and the Mah?bh?rata

and

  * Ethics and the R?m?ya?a.


We're trying to get everything wrapped up this summer. This is a short 
window. While I'm sure there are many qualified people who can write on 
these topics, I'm hoping to connect with authors who:

  * have papers on these topics that they have completed or are working
    on AND
  * have not yet found a good home for their work.

If this description fits you, please contact me off list.

Thanks
Shyam

p.s. I'm also curious and happy to hear from others with research and 
writing on Indian ethics.
