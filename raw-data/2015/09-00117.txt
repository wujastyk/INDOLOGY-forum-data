Regarding Dieter's second question, there are the "Nebencaesuren" of
?ry?-type meters, which are not (to my knowledge) described as yati by the
tradition: in certain positions (the sixth ga?a of the first line, and the
fourth ga?a of any vipul? line, as H. Jacobi discovered), there must be a
"syncopated" rhythm, which is achieved either with the shape v?v or with
v|vvvv, the word-boundary being necessary in the second case to prevent the
four light syllables from being scanned as two bimoraic feet. Correspondingly
there are "bridges" where, in order to ensure that the last and
last-but-one m?tr?s of a ga?a are scanned as a single bimoraic foot, no
word-boundary is permitted between them. You can read more in C. Mayrhofer
in IIJ 31 (1988) 17-25 and my paper on the ?ry? here
