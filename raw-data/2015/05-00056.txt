Dear Rich and Arlo,

Brough, G?ndh?r? Dharmapada, pp. 59?60 has a detailed
discussion of this and does suggest that the line
originated from a dot. In the Kharo??h? manuscript
material that I work with, sometimes a stray j or ?
with dot above occurs, even though the form with line
above is normal.

On a side note, wondering what the antecedents of dot
below for retroflex in Indic transliteration are, I
came across the following Wikipedia page:

   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_%28diacritic%29

with a wealth of examples for diacritic dots above
and below in Latin?based orthographies.

All best,
Stefan
