Subject: [INDOLOGY] Read the Sanskrit texts: Why both Rajiv Malhotra and	his critics are wrong about plagiarism

Please note that in this article, Gurevitch cites the first explicit statement against plagiarism from a 10th century work by Somadeva Suri. That is fairly late in the history of Sanskrit literature. Does this suggest that for thousands of years before, attitudes were different?
