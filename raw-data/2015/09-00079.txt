The large *V?ddhaS?ry?runaKarmavip?ka*, that is quite well known in the
literature, casts S?rya as one of the main interlocutors.  I don't know if
that somehow explains the -arka.  Probably not, but I thought I'd mention
it.

The VSAK was published by Khemar?ja ?r?k???ad?sa in Mumbai in 1909; the
edition and also a fine manuscript of the work are both available in the
Wellcome Library in London.
