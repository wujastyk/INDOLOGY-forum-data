I presume you have looked at "Conflicting hagiographies and history: The place of ?a?karavijaya texts in Advaita tradition,? by Vidyasankar Sundaresan in International Journal of Hindu Studies <http://www.researchgate.net/publication/journal/1022-4556_International_Journal_of_Hindu_Studies> 07/2000; 4(2):109-184.

So I have now scanned the ones I had and posted them, along with three scanned by others, with the Sanskrit Hindu texts at http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-hindu-texts/ <http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-hindu-texts/>. Besides the two well-known ones by Anant?nandagiri and by M?dhava, and also the one by Vy?s?cala, these include seven edited by W. R. Antarkar.

In subsequent years he published several journal articles pertaining to this topic, and editions of seven lesser-known ?a?kara-vijayas (hopefully I did not miss any when I gathered them about fifteen years ago). But his thesis remained unpublished.

This book is even now not listed on WorldCat, which only shows the 1960 thesis (and that is held only at one library). A scan of this book, in two parts (the thesis, and later articles as appendices), is available at: https://sites.google.com/site/hindulibrary/document-list <https://sites.google.com/site/hindulibrary/document-list>

> In view of the disputes around the ?a?kara ma?has that we were just reminded of by Dean?s post, it may be worth noting that this book is scholarly research with no connection to any ma?ha, contrary to appearances. As may be seen by the photos of the adhipatis of the Kanchi Kamakoti ?a?kara ma?ha in its opening pages, this book was published by an affiliate of this ma?ha. I am very grateful to everyone involved in the publication of Antarkar?s thesis for making it available at long last.

> The extant ?a?kara-vijayas are comparatively late, and their stories often conflict with each other. One of the latest (nineteenth century) was published in Germany in 1992: ?a?kara-mand?ra-saurabha: Eine Legende ?ber das Leben des Philosophen ?a?kara, Text, ?bersetzung, Einleitung, by Anton Ungemach. Antarkar showed in separate articles that the extant ?a?kara-vijaya attributed to ?nandagiri (1961 article <http://easterntradition.org/antarkar%202.pdf>) and the one attributed to Vidy?ra?ya (1972article <http://easterntradition.org/antarkar%203.pdf>) are later works, not written by those authors. Antarkar commented at the end of his 1961 article: ?not one of the 16/17 biographies of ?a?kara I have worked upon inspires confidence in its authenticity to the expected degree.? However, Antarkar provided good evidence that two old ?a?kara-vijayas still existed in the recent past: B?hat-?a?kara-vijaya by Citsukha and Pr?c?na-?a?kara-vijaya by ?nandagiri (1960 article <http://easterntradition.org/antarkar%201.pdf>). Despite his efforts, he could not obtain them, and these have still not come to light as far as I know.
