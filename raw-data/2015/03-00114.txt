You *could *pay $118 on Amazon <http://amzn.to/1y4BEDX> for the
Metropolitan Museum of Art?s catalog *The Art of Illumination: The Limbourg
Brothers and the Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry*. Or you
could pay $0 to download it at MetPublications
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/The_Art_of_Illumination_The_Limbourg_Brothers_and_the_Belles_Heures_of_Jean_de_France_Duc_de_Berr?Tag=&title=&author=&pt=&tc=&dept=&fmt=>,
the site offering ?five decades of Met Museum publications on art history
available to read, download, and/or search for free.? If that strikes you
as an obvious choice, prepare to spend some serious time browsing
MetPublications? collection of free art books and catalogs
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/titles-with-full-text-online?searchtype=F>
.

You may remember that we featured the site a few years ago
<http://www.openculture.com/2012/10/download_hundreds_of_art_catalogs_from_the_metropolitan_museum_of_art_.html>,
back when it offered 397 whole books free for the reading, including *American
Impressionism and Realism: The Painting of Modern Life, 1885?1915*
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/American_Impressionism_and_Realism_The_Painting_of_Modern_Life_1885_1915?Tag=&title=&author=&pt=&tc=&dept=>
*;* *Leonardo da Vinci: Anatomical Drawings from the Royal Library*
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Leonardo_da_Vinci_Anatomical_Drawings_from_the_Royal_Library_Windsor_Castle?Tag=&title=leonardo&author=&pt=0&tc=0&dept=0>
*;* and *Wisdom Embodied: Chinese Buddhist and Daoist Sculpture in The
Metropolitan Museum of Art*
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Wisdom_Embodied_Chinese_Buddhist_and_Daoist_Sculpture_in_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art?Tag=Favorite%20Met%20titles&title=&author=&pt=&tc=&dept=>
*. *But the Met has kept adding to their digital trove since then, and, as
a result, you can now find there no fewer than 422 art catalogs and other
books besides. Those sit alongside the 400,000 free art images the museum
put online last year
<http://www.openculture.com/2014/05/the-met-puts-400000-high-res-images-online.html>
.

So have a look at MetPublications? current collection
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/titles-with-full-text-online?searchtype=F>
and you?ll find you now have unlimited access to such lush as well as
artistically, culturally, and historically varied volumes as *African
Ivories
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/African_Ivories?Tag=&title=&author=&pt=&tc=&dept=&fmt=>*
, *Chess: East and West, Past and Present*
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Chess_East_and_West_Past_and_Present_A_Selection_from_the_Gustavus_A_Pfeiffer_Collection?Tag=&title=&author=&pt=&tc=&dept=&fmt=>
*; **Modern Design in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1890?1990*
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Modern_Design_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_1890_1990?Tag=&title=&author=&pt=&tc=&dept=&fmt=>
*;* *Vincent Van Gogh: The Drawings
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Vincent_van_Gogh_The_Drawings>*;
*French Art Deco
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/French_Art_Deco>*; or
even a guide to the museum itself
<http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Guide_to_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_1972?Tag=&title=&author=&pt=&tc=&dept=&fmt=>
(vintage 1972).

Since I haven?t yet turned to art collection ? I suppose you need money for
that ? these books don?t necessarily make me covet the vast sweep of
artworks they depict and contextualize. But they do make me wish for
something even less probable: a time machine so I could go back and see all
these exhibits firsthand.
