Subject: [INDOLOGY] Report of the 2015 Sanskrit Commission
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cc4gQEwZdVRre+u1p7Ntv6vfmh+6Zz48PiSO51bN5uP_g@mail.gmail.com>

Apparently the report is out. This brief reference
<http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-de-saffronise-sanskrit-before-pitching-it-to-world-panel-2112428>
makes it sound interesting and balanced.  Does anyone have a copy yet?
