Dear Paolo,

> So that are we sure that Kamahya is a sanskritised goddess? Or should we
consider the reverse process? Doesn't seem that were the Hindus to emulate
the tribal-men incorporating tribal worship elements?

To my mind, both.

A perfect example of a dialogic situation, whatever the motivation behind
the move to set up a new, structurally enriched place of worship and a
newly conceived object of veneration.

Best,

Artur
