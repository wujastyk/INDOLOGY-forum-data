While many Sanskritists from Pune have been writing in Sanskrit (prose and
poetry), some of the more noteworthy writers are (Late) K. S. Arjunwadkar
(poetry: Ka??ak??jali), (Late) G.B. Palsule (many Sanskrit dramas,
translations from Marathi, and the epic poem V?ravain?yakam on the life of
Savarkar), (late) P.S. Joshi (Bh?m?yanam, epic poem on the life of
Ambedkar), (late) S.D. Joshi (Sanskrit translation of Hamlet).
