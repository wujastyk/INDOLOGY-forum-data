It is strange that the correspondent has not exhibited his awarenes of
B.K.Ghosh, Sukumar Sen, K.C.Chatterji who looked beyond the Khyber Pass.
<Further, the international perspective is also rare, and typically stops
at the Khyber Pass. That is why among the numerous Indian scholars who are
convinced that there was no Aryan invasion, only a handful will also
vocalize its logical implication, viz. that if IE was not imported, it must
have originated in India and then spread westwards. >
The logic of this if any is not comprehensible to me. The invasion theory
is not highlighted in India but the migration theory is.
