I am looking for the correct version on this blessing someone, non-Sanskrist, mentioned. I know it is faulty but it is a blessing given by Kashmiris:

> ??????????? ?????? ???? ????? ??????: ???????: ?
> ????? ???: ??????? ?????? ????? ???


The last word he gave me is something like sthistva (??) and that cannot be right.

Thanks.

Patrick
