*>>It was observed long ago by Oldenberg that the oldest ** textbook of the
Saamaveda is the Rgveda itself: large parts are apparently ** from the
beginning composed for the sake of "Saamavedic" employment.*


--------- This observation is not different from the emic perspective about
RV -SV relation, except that the sequential older-later relation between
the two is different from the simultaneity of RV-SV in the emic
perspective.

>>The last statement goes counter to an observation elsewhere advocated in
Discovering the Vedas: the universality of music vis ? vis language.

Could it be that 'language' in  "The words of the RV often do not fit and
the melodies seem to reflect another language." is different from a
human/natural speech/tongue, but is something like a composing  ?

So "The words of the RV often do not fit and the melodies seem to reflect
another language" may mean that the saaman singing  employed for a certain
mantra of RV does not match the meaning of the RV words. Something like a
misfit music composing.

Even this is different from the emic perspective since in the simultaneity
view, there can not be any misfit.

Presence of Dravidian or any words other than IE in the RV or any other
Veda can be explained in terms of the influence of the language repertoire
of the drashTA during the non-mantradars'ana state.

Can such an explanation be extended to the music/singing style repertoire
of the drashTA too?

Then as you have pointed out , it will be in contradiction with the
notion of universality of music.

It is better to take a consistent stance with regard to the languages and
singing styles both.
