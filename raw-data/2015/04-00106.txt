Subject: [INDOLOGY] How to unsubscribe from Indology?

You are quite right in saying that members of the Indology list can 
easily withdraw from the list, by visiting the Indology information page 
at listinfo.indology.info, where they may also change their subscription 
options.

It often happens, however, that members ask Indology's governing 
committee to carry out these tasks for them.  Sometimes this happens 
because they have not noticed that they are able to do this for 
themselves.  Things would be a bit easier if more members of the list 
were as well-informed as you.

But it may also happen, especially with actions such as unsubscribing 
that might be interpreted as implying dissatisfaction, that members may 
wish to record the reasons for their decision. This they may do either 
by posting a message to the entire Indology list at 
indology at list.indology.info, or by sending an email to the governing 
committee at indology-owner at list.indology.info.  The list is fortunate 
in having members who, more often than not, receive complaints sent to 
the list with considerate attention, despite the demands that these make 
on their time.  Complaints sent to the governing committee are treated 
as confidential, and the committee gives careful thought (despite 
similar demands) to what action, if any, is called for in response, and 
whether any resulting communications should be public (through the list 
at large) or private (which is often sufficient because of the 
prevailingly collegial attitude of our members).

Yours,

Gary Tubb,
Member of the Governing Committee.
