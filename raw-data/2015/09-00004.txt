This makes quite a different situation from that in India. "Composition"
meaning translation *into* Sanskrit *from* a diffrent language is in the
Indian curricula from the secondary stage. I thank Professor Gombrich for
the clarification.

I point to a relevant topic. The position of Sanskrit in the Indian schools
has now been touched upon in the List. This calls attention to the European
Classical languages in the Western schools. Can it be expected that someone
threw light on the position of the Classical languages in the European and
American schools. As I knew indirectly French/English was the general
preference as the second languaghe and Classical as the third. Is it still
the preferred combination?
