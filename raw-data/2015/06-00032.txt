Subject: [INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding indology	at	the IHRC

As we know, Arya is a Vedic term. In the Telegraph article, Bharadwaj states that he wants to research the notion of Aryan migration. Bharadwaj does not state that he takes ?Aryan? as a racial, rather than a cultural, term. So please help me here. Where is the racism?

Thanks,
Howard
