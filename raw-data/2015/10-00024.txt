I believe Motilal Banarsidass still hasa shop there: Chowk, Below Central Bank, Kabir Road, Kabir Road 
Chaukhambha Orientalia K.37/109,GopalMandir Lane,Near Golghar,, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh 221001 
Some general bookstores that have agood selection of Indological books, some of which might be inSanskrit are:
Universal Books D 40/60 Gowdowlia(south) Lakshmanpura, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh 221001 
Harmony Books B. 1/158 Assi Ghat,Varanasi One of my favorites down on Assi Ghatwhere there's always a chance of running into well-known Indologistschatting with the very knowledgeable owner Rakesh Singh.
Indica Books - also on Assi Ghat just up from Harmony.? They also have a shop not far from Universal books up in Gowdowlia: Sonapura Rd, Bhelupur, Varanasi
There might be some shops around Sampurnanand Sanskrit University but I don't know the area well.

Best,

Dear Colleagues,

Can anyone recommend some good (Sanskrit) bookshops in Varanasi?
