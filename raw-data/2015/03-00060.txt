Subject: [INDOLOGY] access to SouthAsiaArchive?
Message-ID: <DUB114-W7FC0B8A295748FACCB27FA5040@phx.gbl>

Dear colleagues,

Does any of you have access to the "SouthAsiaArchive"? If so, I'd appreciate your downloading and sending me this item:

<http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120027/205631/003>

It appears they have the whole Indian Historical Quarterly available, which is very nice; it would be even nicer if it were freely available to all.

Thanks and best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
