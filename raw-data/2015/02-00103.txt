Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scan of R. K. Kamats edition of Gur-caritra needed
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFW=24t0eKxKqDRAXCVPOESM8oWOfBi65oShuwiSUkcLA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

If anyone has a scan of R.K. Kamat's edition of the Guru-caritra first
published in 1937 could they please forward it to me.  I need a version
that includes his preface.  (I've seen some reprints that don't include
this).

Thanks,
Harry Spier
