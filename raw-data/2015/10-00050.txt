Could you cite a few occurrences with at least the whole sentence as a context? If the form is as one sees in v?k?a-vi?e?a, niyama-vi?e?a (or v?k????? vi?e?a?, niyam?n?? vi?e?a? etc., then vi?e?a has not been used in any unusual sense. 

a.a.

I haven't found this precise meaning in any dictionary and am curious to know if the term occurs with this technical meaning in any other ??stras.
