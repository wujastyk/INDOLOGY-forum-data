In response to the growing interest in India in the era of globalisation 
the Department of Culture, Politics and Society, University of Turin, is 
pleased to announce a highly intensive, one-week Summer School on

Through an interdisciplinary approach, the School provides students with 
an extraordinary opportunity to analyse key social, political and 
economic issues of contemporary India. Important recent trajectories of 
social change ? as well as continuity ? will be explored, encouraging 
critical reflection among students.
