Dear colleagues,

I have been asked the question below, to which I cannot remember the 
answer either.  Does anyone else have a better memory (or the 
forethought to make a note of the reference) or is able to point us to 
equivalent information?  Any leads would be most welcome.

"I?m currently putting together a small presentation for a workshop on 
digitisation  . . . and, as is the way of things, trying to track down a 
reference for a piece I once read about the loss of manuscript 
collections in India since the Raghavan survey. I remember once reading 
some astonishing assertion of the percentage of manuscripts listed in 
that survey that were no longer extent but stupidly didn?t note the 
reference. I had thought it was in one of Dominik Wujastyk?s articles 
but have failed to find anything beyond more general comments about the 
19^th century being the point at which India had the richest manuscript 
collections."

Best wishes

John Brockington
