Dear Indologists,

Does anyone have easy access to this book review? No library now accessible
to me has it, and I have not found it online.

Kamaleswar Bhattacharya review of Claus Oetke, *"Ich" und das Ich:
Analytische Untersuchungen zur buddhistisch-brahmanischen *
*?tmankontroverse*. In *Bulletin d'**?tudes Indiennes*, vol. 9, 1991, pp.
279-281.

I would greatly appreciate a scan of it. Thanks!

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
