Walter and all:

I do not know abut this maxim, but this real life video of a mother rabbit doing just what the maxim say could be instructive. It was probably filmed somewhere in south India, I am not sure of the language of the people taping it.

It then becomes a fight that either you [the thug] kill me to get to my daughter, or you back off.?

The generalization here lies certainly in the fact that a (physically weaker) female (?a??) effectively fights a (physically stronger) male (sarpa). The latter would be the aggressor(s), the victim(s) the (female) bunny and/or her young.
