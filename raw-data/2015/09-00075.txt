Dear list,

I am trying to identify a work mentioned by Harik???a in the 
Kr???kau?alya section of his B?hajjyoti??r?ava from 1871 CE. Discussing 
his Snakes & Ladders-like Karmapa??a game, he lists the following 
sources for it:

d???v? karmavip?k?rka? pur??a? g?ru?a? tath? /
??t?tapasm?ti? m?tsya? ?r?madbh?gavat?dikam // 6.20.254

Now, the work I am interested in identifying is the Karmavip?k?rka. 
While there are, of course, numerous works on karmavip?ka, the only work 
given by NCC carrying the exact title Karmavip?k?rka (though also simply 
known as Karmavip?ka) is a work attributed to ?a?karabha??a, son of 
N?laka??ha.

Could anyone with a better overview of karmavip?ka texts than myself 
tell me if this might be the work referred to by Harik???a?

Any suggestions are most welcome, including references to secondary 
literature on karmavip?ka and karmavip?ka texts.

Kind regards,
Jacob
