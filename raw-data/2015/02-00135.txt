Subject: [INDOLOGY] Wise up to Copyright
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdDVwMubQP05UkLhg2VwJuPJG6htHbs2cfLK4GiJuSjbw@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a good, clear, short (!) presentation about copyright and writers
here that has just been put out by the ALCS in the UK:

Note that under the "what if I'm employed" heading, it doesn't mention the
fact that almost all universities waive their rights to the copyright of
their academic staff's writings.
