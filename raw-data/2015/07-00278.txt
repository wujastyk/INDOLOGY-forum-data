For such instances of rhyming in Indo-Aryan literature rather than to Sanskrit verse composition we should to the Pr?krit and Apabhra??a ?song? literature. As I have argued elsewhere Tamil devotional literature borrowed from Pr?krit and Apabhra??a models. See, apart from the relevant chapters in my K?vya in South India. Old Tamil Ca?kam Poetry from 2001, ?Bhoja's ?r??g?raprak??a and the kuravai poems in Kalittokai?, in Kannan M. and Jennifer Clare, Passages: relationships between Tamil and Sanskrit, 145-162, and ?Songs accompanied by so-called bha?it?s in dramatic texts?, in Karin Steiner and Heidrun Br?ckner, Indisches Theater: Text, Theorie, Praxis, 63-75.


As to Jayadeva?s G?tagovinda, may I quote myself?:


?Its composite nature marks the Gitagovinda as a literary experiment. In fact, this is evident in yet another respect, namely the use of Sanskrit. For, both genres combined in the G?tagovinda, namely the l?sya and catu?pad?, were in Pr?krit. The G?tagovinda is a ?translation? into Sanskrit of an original Pr?krit type of composition. Interestingly, as such the G?tagovinda does not stand on its own. A similar development is seen in the ?ry?sapta?at?, a Sanskrit translation of the Pr?krit Sattasa?. It cannot be a coincidence that the author of the ?ry?sapta?at?, a certain Govardhana, was patronized by the same Bengali king Lak?ma?asena who was believed to have been the patron of Jayadeva (see Pischel 1893).?

Second-syllable rhyme is also a sine qua non in Kannada poetry, and Jayak?rti uses it in his definitions/examples (all in Sanskrit) of different verse-forms in the Chandonu??sana (ca. 1000 CE)---not just in the seventh chapter, where J. exemplifies some Kannada meters, but also occasionally in the sixth, which treats of Prakrit and Apabhra??a meters.

According to Yigal Bronner and David Shulman ("A Cloud Turned Goose" in IESHR 43 in 2006), it's also used in later Sanskrit works by Tamil authors (??kalya Malla's Ud?rar?ghava and N?laka??ha D?k?ita's ?ival?l?r?ava).

A late reaction to an earlier thread.

Setting aside the question of dating, which is so often contentious, I am always *amazed* when people tell me that they are not convinced that the Bh?gavatapur??a is a Southern production.  The work is full of Southern touches, many of which have been pointed out by a variety of scholars over the last century.  Yes, ok, there are also Northern touches, but why should that be surprising for a Southern work ?  The South seems always long to have been more conscious of the North than the North has been of the South.  It is full, for example, of rather long-standing Northern sacred toponyms (Tenkasi = ?Benares of the South?; Madurai = Mathur?, etc.; and, of course Southern rivers are regularly equated with the Ga?g? and Yamun?), whereas there are no old instances of a ?Northern? K??c? or ?r?ra?gam or Chidambam, nor of the "K?ver? of the North?.

Or are there ?

Similarly, the high literary style of the Bh?gavata, involving, in some parts, a high concentration of Vedic archaisms seems sometimes to be mentioned as though it were a factor that might suggest high antiquity and a provenance somewhere in the North.  But at what time in any part of the Sanskritic world would Vedic literature not have been prestigious and accessible to Veda-knowers seeking to write in a consciously archaising style?

But what about an element of style that not nearly as many authors would have been similarly motivated to copy ?

Second-syllable rhyming, in which just the consonant of the second syllable of each verse-quarter is rhymed, is abundantly present in post-Sangam Tamil literature and ubiquitous (or, if not, at least pretty nearly so) in the devotional literature of the ??v?rs and N?ya?m?rs, while being extremely rare in Sanskrit verse composition.  An example will make this clear:

BhP_10.31.001/1 jayati te 'dhika? janman? vraja? ?rayata indir? ?a?vad atra hi
BhP_10.31.001/3 dayita d??yat?? dik?u t?vak?s tvayi dh?t?savas tv?? vicinvate
BhP_10.31.002/1 ?aradud??aye s?dhuj?tasatsarasijodara?r?mu?? d???
BhP_10.31.002/3 suratan?tha te '?ulkad?sik? varada nighnato neha ki? vadha?
BhP_10.31.003/1 vi?ajal?pyay?d vy?lar?k?as?d var?am?rut?d vaidyut?nal?t
BhP_10.31.003/3 v??amay?tmaj?d vi?vato bhay?d ??abha te vaya? rak?it? muhu?
BhP_10.31.004/1 na khalu gop?k?nandano bhav?n akhiladehin?m antar?tmad?k
BhP_10.31.004/3 vikhanas?rthito vi?vaguptaye sakha udeyiv?n s?tvat?? kule

I had long thought that this argument, expressed in 1996, would be a clincher, at least for the devotional verses in which second-syllable rhyming occurs, for proving Southernness, since I don?t know of any other Sanskrit works that use this feature.

But Sanskrit literature is vast, hence this appeal:

Does anyone know of any other Sanskrit works that use such 2nd-syllable rhyming?
