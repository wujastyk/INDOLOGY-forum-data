     "From Vermeer's milkmaid to Lewis Hine's power house mechanic, the
individual engrossed in a process has long attracted artistic attention,"
she said.


     "But the beauty of the process does not permit one who describes it to
gain, through copyright, the monopolistic power to exclude all others from
practicing it. The sequence remains unprotectable as a process the design
of which primarily reflects function, not expression."


     Wardlaw also said that "consumers would have little reason to buy
Choudhury's book if Choudhury held a monopoly on the practice of the very
activity he sought to popularize."


     Choudhury's argument that the sequence is entitled to copyright
protection since it is a "compilation" carried little weight with the
panel, which Wardlaw said "misconstrues the scope of copyright protection
for compilations."


     "That the sequence may possess many constituent parts does not
transform it into a proper subject of copyright protection," Wardlaw said.


     Nor is the sequence a copyrightable "choreographic work," she said,
since "successions of bodily movement" do not become copyrightable as such
when they are "part and parcel of a process."


     Without a proper understanding of the idea/expression dichotomy, she
said, one might obtain monopoly rights over physical sequences "from
brushing one's teeth to pushing a lawnmower" by "describing them in a
tangible medium of expression and labeling them choreographic works."


     Evolation attorney Eric Maier with Maier Schoch in Hermosa Beach,
California, said, "Evolation is very pleased that the Ninth Circuit has
made it clear that yoga belongs to everybody, and no individual owns any
particular style or sequence of yoga poses."


     Attorneys for Choudhury did not respond to request for comment on
Thursday morning.
