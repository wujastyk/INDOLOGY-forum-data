Subject: [INDOLOGY] Arya as prefix or suffix
Message-ID: <55F3DDED.5080205@pbhome.se>

One occasionally comes across /?rya/ in Sanskrit texts either suffixed 
to a name (e.g., R?m?nuj?rya) or prefixed to it (e.g., 
?ry?valokite?vara), but I haven't seen this often enough to be certain 
if either variant is peculiar to a particular region, religious 
community, etc. (The two examples given are representative of my limited 
experience.) As a result, I am uncertain how to understand the 
occasional /?rya/ in a compounded list of names. I'd be grateful if the 
vidvans of the list could tell me whether it is more usual as a prefix 
or suffix, or under what circumstances this might vary.
