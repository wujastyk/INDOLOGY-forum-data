Dear Colleagues:
Does anyone have pdf copies of these two chapters, both from the same 
edited volume? I know I have hard copies somewhere, but I can't find 
them (I do see a readable copy online, but I need hard copies of the 
chapters and the volume is proving difficult to inter-library loan [it's 
also selling for near $600 on Amazon, so I won't be buying a copy for my 
library in the near future]).

Kulke, H. 1992. ?The R?jas?ya. A Paradigm of Early State Formation?? In 
A.W. van den Hoek, D.H.A. Kolff, and M.S. Oort, eds., Ritual, State and 
History in South Asia: Essays in Honour of J.C. Heesterman. Leiden: E.J. 
Brill: 188-198.

Scharfe, Hartmut. 1992. ?Sacred Kingship, Warlords, and Nobility.? In 
A.W. van den Hoek, D.H.A. Kolff, and M.S. Oort, eds., Ritual, State and 
History in South Asia: Essays in Honour of J.C. Heesterman. Leiden: E.J.
