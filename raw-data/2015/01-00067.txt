Dear VSR,

since you mentionned my name, in a recent thread,
("http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-January/040570.html")
in which I do not take part,

because "Life is Short!",
and because I try to remember that
"... ?????? ???? ???????????? ????????? ?????" [... vi?aik ku?ai t?rnt?ri? 
??rnta? ?ulaku] "The world will abandon those who abandon their 
unfinished work" [KU?A? 612]

kindly allow me to answer, indirectly
by stating that I remember very well
several earlier periods in the life of the INDOLOGY mailing list,
including the episodes
which conducted to the creation
(in 1998, if I remember correctly)
by Dominik
of a Yahoo mailing list called Y-INDOLOGY
(which someone immediately nicknamed "Why Indology?" ... :-)

https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/INDOLOGY/conversations/topics/366

When the current version of the INDOLOGY mailing list was created,
everyone understood why the page describing the purpose of the list 
stated that:

"INDOLOGY is an internet discussion group whose primary purpose is to 
provide a forum for discussion among PROFESSIONAL scholars of classical 
Indian (South Asian) civilization."

Yours with every good wish!

Happy New Year 2015
