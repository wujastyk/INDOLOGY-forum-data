A number of the khila verses are also included within the ???kh?yana
recension. The recent edition by Amal Dhari Singh Gautam gives pada-p??ha
for them. The question now is whether the pada-p??ha he gives for them is
found in the ???kh?yana pada-p??ha manuscripts, or added by the editor from
other sources. This edition has no critical apparatus. The Sanskrit bh?mik?,
consisting of pp. v-xxii, says (p. xvi) that for the ??val?yana recension there
are 20 sa?hit?-p??ha manuscripts and 18 pada-p??ha manuscripts, and for the
???kh?yana recension there are 8 sa?hit?-p??ha manuscripts and 17 pada-p??ha
manuscripts. It then succinctly describes each of the 25 ???kh?yana manuscripts
(pp. xvi--xxi). The English Introduction, consisting of pp. xxiii-xxxvii,
gives a brief recap in its first four pages, only mentioning (p. xxiv) that
there are in total 38 ??val?yana manuscripts and 25 ???kh?yana manuscripts.
The rest of it is devoted to acknowledgements. I did not see anything about
whether the khila verses are found in the ???kh?yana pada-p??ha
manuscripts. The editor mentions (p. xxviii) that he has published more
than 10 papers on these Vedic ??kh?s since 1969. Possibly he discusses this
in one or more of these papers. There is no bibliographic listing of them.

B. B. Chaubey in his edition of the ??val?yana recension has in English a
Preface, pp. ix-xvii, an extensive Introduction, pp. 1-102, and "Textual
variants in the ??vS with regard to additional mantras recorded from MSS,
Khilas and other texts," pp. 103-146. So he gives variants for the
additional mantras, but not for rest of the ??val?yana text, which includes
verse 10.121.10 that my question was about. I assume that Satavalekar's
well-known statement in his Sanskrit prast?va to his edition of the ?gveda,
that there is only one variant reading in the ?gveda (eka eva p??habheda?),
is enough to make people think that no critical apparatus for the ?gveda is
needed. As for the khilas, Chaubey describes (pp. 32-34) the various
editions, including the 1906 Scheftelowitz edition in more detail than the
others. He does not mention Scheftelowitz's 1907 WZKM article that Walter
referred us to, which was new to me.
