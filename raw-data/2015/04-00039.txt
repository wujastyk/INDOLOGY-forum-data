Subject: [INDOLOGY] archery question
Message-ID: <73C8D05F0B9DFC4D84EA02AFC695DD08B141C50A@Boisvert.marianopolis.com>

Dear colleagues,

I am trying to imagine what archery would have been like in ancient India (roughly 2500-2000 years ago). I am interested in archery techniques as well as archery materials (what would the bows and arrows have been made of?). Can anyone recommend some materials on this subject? I have been looking around, but have not yet found quite what I am looking for. It is for purposes of imagining the art more than anything else.

Many thanks,
