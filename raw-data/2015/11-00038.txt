Dear Oliver,

A few other names come to mind:

Jayantabhatta (who wrote the Nyaya treatise Nyayamanjari as well as the play Agamadambara);
Jnanasrimisra (author of works of kavya as well as pramanasastra);
Possibly Sankara, whose very diverse oeuvre may be difficult to assess owing to
controversies about attribution (though this might make him an interesting
test case for what you are doing).

sorry about the missing diacritical marks

best,
Matthew
