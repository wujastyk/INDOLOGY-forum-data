The work is also briefly presented in
- "T. Ga?apati Sastri: The Discover" by N.P. Unni (in Highways and Byways in Sanskrit Literature, Delhi: New Bharatya Book Corporation, 2012, vol. 1, pp. 120-125, with references to a notice by Winternitz 1934, and an obituary by V. Raghavan in the Journal of Kerala University Manuscripts Library vol. 2 [1949], both items I have not seen; cf. previously by N.P.  Unni, Kau?alya Artha??stra (A study), Delhi: Baharatiya Vidya Prakashan, 1983, pp. 32-36 = "general introduction", ibid. introducing the vol. 1 of the 3 vol. reprint of the TSS ed. of the Artha??stra [with the commentary  of T. Ga?apati ??str?], same publisher 1984 [and 1990]);

(- nothing in the obituary by V.R.R. Dikshitar in A.B.O.R.I. 8/3, 1926-27, pp. 322-325

But nowhere is given a reference to an edition of the work.
However, I suspect that it was issued in some local/Kerala publishing house or journal. As it must have been the case of his poem Cakravartin?gu?ama?im?l? (in praise of Queen Victoria) and other original Sanskrit compositions. The NCC should be checked s.v.
At the least his manual of Indian culture entitled Bh?rat?nuvar?anam, prefaced (in English) by Sylvain L?vi (who was in epistolary contact with him and at the request of whom the work was written) was issued in 1905 (2nd and 3rd ed. Trivandrum : Sudharma Print House, 1925 and 1940; re-issued by V. Subrahmanyan, Hyderabad: Sanskrit Academy, 2010, Sanskrit Academy Series (ed. T. Keshava Narayana) no. 83).

Best wishes,

> In the book History of Sanskrit Literature by Krsnamacariar mentions that the MS of the work is in his home(even I tried contacting his grandchildren but no success), but in the book Kaumudikatha Kallolini the name of the work is quoted which leads to suspect that the work would have printed after 1930s.
