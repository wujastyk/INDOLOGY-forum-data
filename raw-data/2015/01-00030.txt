Dear list members,

I thought this might be useful to other list members.

In response to my query for Buhlers Paleography I was sent a link to the University of Oxford. (Thank you Rohana Seneviratne).

http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do

Using the search term "sanskrit" and then restricting to on-line resources there are 461 downloadable books dealing with Sanskrit..

Regards,
Harry
