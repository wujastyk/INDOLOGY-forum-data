I remember years ago when I was studying Sanskrit Ingalls mentioned that Monier Williams had apparently copied from Boethlingk-Roth without attribution. He said that Boethlingk was able to adduce entries in Monier Williams that had the same mistakes originally made on the SP Lexicon. Plus ?a change?. George Hart

Even if the possibility that something might be done about them is remote, it may be useful to know about them.

It seems that all he did was read and edit the English, without even consulting the Sanskrit. He improved some English words here and there, and deleted all the parentheses that Sharma had used to distinguish his own additions from what is in the Sanskrit. Yet Sharma's superior translation has fallen into oblivion, while Mainkar's was again reprinted in 2004. I have scanned and posted Sharma's book in three parts here: http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-hindu-texts/ <http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-hindu-texts/>

The notes they added are helpful, and they reproduced Aufrecht's romanized text, and also a devanagari text. But I expected their translation to follow the Arya Samaj line of interpretation throughout, so that we could see how it differs from S?ya?a?s interpretation. What unsuspecting readers got instead, other than God for the gods, was in fact S?ya?a?s interpretation, by way of the silent appropriation of Wilson's translation.
