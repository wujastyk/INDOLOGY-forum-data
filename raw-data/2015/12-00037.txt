Dear Dominik and Harry,
Thank you for this. The MB library has the K?kaca????varamata, which is certainly of interest to me, but according to David White's Alchemical body (1999: 152), this text is different to the K?kaca????varakalpatantra. I am hoping to confirm this when I get my hands on a copy of the latter.
Best wishes,
Jason

As Dominik kindly pointed out the text is in the Muktabodha digital library.

www.muktabodha.org and then click on digital library tab.The digital library page will then come up.  There are three collections accessable from this page. It is in the "Searchable E-text Library" collection.To prevent automated web-crawlers copying the texts username/password protection has been placed on the collection.username: muktabodhapassword indology
