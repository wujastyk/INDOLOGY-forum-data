Subject: [INDOLOGY]  Vayu-Purana Critical Edition Status?
Message-ID: <CAPAZekYxNKrDQQRYCLJbNAQkzEfzQ1Ozfpyp_RY6gk0FR1GCOg@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you, McComas, for your very informative and at the same time fun to
read quick report on the World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok 2015. You
mentioned co-convening the first ever independent panel on the pur??as. I
wonder if you or anyone here knows the status of the forthcoming critical
edition of the *V?yu-pur??a* from the Oriental Institute, Vadodara. Since
this is generally regarded as the oldest pur??a we have, its critical
edition is especially important. I anxiously await its publication.

Best regards,
