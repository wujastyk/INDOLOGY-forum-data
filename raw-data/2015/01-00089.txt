Subject: [INDOLOGY] N. Ganesan's Dravidian etymologies for 'makara', etc.

Palaniappan,

I do not know what the interaction between Parpola and Ganesan has been in
the past, but Parpola's 2011 paper already has some of the ideas discussed
in Ganesan's paper. For instance, the following two paragraphs -- which I
find very problematic -- attempt to connect mucali 'crocodile' with *m?k-
'to eat' and m?c- 'to cut'

    This Proto-Dravidian etymon may be derived
from  a  verbal root preserved only in North
Dravidian *m?c- 'to cut (meat), to cut up into
convenient pieces any object too large for use'
(DEDR 5130). This verb, which describes quite
well what a crocodile does after catching a victim
that is too large to be directly swallowed, seems
to be related to the Proto-Dravidian verbal root
*m?k-/mokk-/*mok- 'to eat, to eat greedily in large
mouthfuls, eat voraciously, devour, gobble, swallow'
(DEDR 5127 + 4897). Tamil has derived moci- 'to
eat' from this root.

     This word for 'crocodile' may originally have
been a compound involving two roots, the latter
being Proto-Dravidian *alacu, *alay 'to shake or
agitate in water (e.g., to rinse clothes or vegetables)'
(DEDR 246), which is undoubtedly related to the
root *ala?ku/*alakku, *alay 'to move, shake, wave,
go to and fro for an object, roam, wander' (DEDR
240). This etymological interpretation, however,
necessitates a slight revision of Krishnamurti's
Proto-Dravidian reconstruction (2003: 13, 531),
which is *m?c-V-?- / *moc-V-?-. The compound
nicely complements the first verb by describing the
characteristic behaviour of the marsh and saltwater
crocodile noted above (i.e., victims caught on land
are dragged to the water and swallowed whole, while
large prey is torn to pieces by means of twisting and
shaking motions).


Besides connecting m?c- with m?k-, the attempt to connect with alay- 'to
shake' is extremely problematic, as it totally disregards retroflex /?/ in
several languages such as Kota *moca?*, Kannada *mosa?e, masa?e*, Tulu *mosa?e,
muda?e*.

In my personal communcation with Ganesan (about 3 years ago), I pointed out
how his paper uses several linguistically questionable statements and
unsubstantiated opinions as well-established facts, making it excessively
speculative and wishful thinking.

I think what is required is not a piecemeal analysis of words, but a
comprehensive investigation animal names, plant names and other biota
collected from all the languages of South Asia, for a deeper understanding
of the linguistic prehistory of the subcontinent.

Regards,
Suresh.

Ganesan has mentioned an article of his entitled, "A Dravidian Etymology for Makara - Crocodile," published by the International School of Dravidian Linguistics in 2011.  (See Attachment 1 for the article.) In this article, Ganesan offers new etymologies for words meaning crocodile such as Sanskrit makara, Sanskrit nakra/n?kra, Tamil mutalai, and Tamil vi?a?kar/i?a?kar. As far as I can see, the article seems to have serious flaws from the viewpoints of linguistics and philology. While usually an article of such a nature might not receive any serious attention from scholars, the fact that it is said to be published by International School of Dravidian Linguistics suggests that it undergo scrutiny by scholars.

These epithets for ?iva and his lingam have origin in the names for gharial crocodile (Section 3.0). When vi?a?ku is used, it indicates the naked bhik???ana youth going rounds in the streets and attracting women: ma?aika? t??um talai kai ?nti vi?a?kar?kit tirivatu e???? (Tevaram 7.6.1)."

Subramanya Iyer in the Digital T?v?ram edition (from EFEO, Pondicherry) as "what is the reason for wandering from house to house, assuming a beauteous form and asking alms, " where he translates vi?a?kar as 'beauteous form? (http://tinyurl.com/p7vg2wl). ; That vi?a?kar is not naked is shown by T?v?ram 7.36.3, another verse by Cuntarar, the same person who authored the verse quoted by Ganesan too. In this verse translated by V. M. Subramanya Iyer, Vi?a?kar is explicitly described as wearing a loin-cloth as given below (http://tinyurl.com/nbns4gt).

Civa?, who is known by the name of ?ra?iya vi?a?kar in Pai???li surrounded by a verdant garden which has mast wood trees, cool and green delight of the woods, and lotus flowers growing in the moats into which water flows.
