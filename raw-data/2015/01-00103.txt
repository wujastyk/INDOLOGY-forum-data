Dear Dr. Parpola,

Thank you for your clarification. 

You may remember in 2002, during the Harvard Roundtable on Ethnogenesis of South and Central Asia, when Bh. Krishnamurti presented "The Culture of Proto-Dravidian Speakers as Reconstructed from the  Dravidian Etymological Dictionary (DEDR)," Frank Southworth questioned the Proto-Dravidian nature of many of BhK's reconstructions, which were based on words found only in South Dravidian or South and Central Dravidian. BhK did acknowledge that Frank had a point. In your own paper you were right to point out that the cognates of *nek-V? are attested rather narrowly. In the case of 'nakar', considering it a sole survivor from Proto-Dravidian is too speculative. The danger of assuming 'nakar' to be Proto-Dravidian is made clear by Tamil philology. 


Please see the Tamil Lexicon's entries given below.

?????-??? nakar-, 4 v. intr. 1. To creep, as a reptile; ??????. 2. To crawl or move along in a lying or sitting posture, as an infant; ???????. 3. To steal away, skulk; ????????? ?????.
 
????? nakar, n. < nagara. 1. Town, city; ?????. ???????? ???????? ??????? (?????. 23). 2. [T. nagaru.] House, abode, mansion; ??????. ???????? ??????? ??????? (????. 15). 3. Temple, sacred shrine; ??????. ?????????????? ???? (?????. 6). 4. Palace; ???????. ?????????? ??????? (?????. 27, 200). 5. Dais for performing ceremonies; ?????? ???????? ????. ???? ???????? (????. 2633). 6. A furnished hall or place, decorated for ceremonial functions; ??????? ??? ??????? ???????. ??????? ?????????? (????. 701). 7. Wife; ?????. ????????????????? ??????? ??????? ???? (?????. 8).

The noun nakar is attested from Classical Tamil times. The verb form nakar- is not shown with any old literary attestations. Indeed nakar- in the sense of  '1. To creep, as a reptile; ??????. 2. To crawl or move along in a lying or sitting posture, as an infant; ???????' does not occur in Classical Tamil texts or epics or the eighteen minor works, the Periyapuranam, etc. The only remotely possible occurrence is in T?v?ram 2:19:11.3. Even that is doubtful considering the textual variants given in the Digital T?v?ram. (See http://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/site/digital_tevaram/INDEX.HTM)

So it is very doubtful if 'nakar-' has an ancient pedigree, let alone from Proto-Dravidian.

One is led to wonder if the verb nakar- was coined from the noun nakar analogically based on the pair of noun ?r and verb ?r-, which are ancient. See the following from Tamil Lexicon.

????-??? ?r-, 4 v. [M. ?r.] intr. 1. To move slowly; to creep, as an infant; to crawl, as a snake; ???????. ????????? ??????????? (????. ?????????. 11). 2. To spread, circulate, as blood; to extend over a surface, as spots on the skin; ???????. ?????????? ???? ???????? ??? (?????, 1185). 3. To flow, as juice from the sugar-cane; ??????. ???????????? ???????? (?????, 34). 4. To come to close quarters; ???????. ?????? ???????? ??????? (?????. 27, 27, ?????.). 5. To be unloosed, relaxed; ???????. ????????? ??????? (?????. 100). 6. To itch; ??????????. ???????? ???? ??????????.--tr. 1. To mount; ??????. ????????? ???????? ?????? . . . ???????? . . . ???? (???????. 101). 2. To ride, as a horse; to drive, as a vehicle; ????????????. ?????? ?????????? ???????????? (?????, 37). 

???? ?r, n. < ????-. 1. Going, riding; ?????. ?????????????????????????? (??????. ????. 43). 2. [T. Tu. ?ru, K. M. ?r.] Village, town, city; ????????? ???. (????. ??. 37.) 3. Place; ????. ??? ???????? ???????????? (????. 2087). 4. Resident population; ???????????. ??? ?????? ?????????? (????. ??. 563). 5. Halo round the sun or moon; ??????????????? ?????? ????????. ????????? ???????? ????????? (??????. ?????. 9)

Indeed Akan????u 306. 6 has a tortoise moving slowly up a sugarcane. If you compare the verbs nakar- and ?r-, one can see the semantic equivalence. The verb ?r-, noun ?r, and noun nakar have a long history of literary attestations. (Th verb ?r- (DEDR 749) is also attested in Tamil, Malayalam, and Konda.) The verb nakar- seems be of a much later coinage. 

In other words, not only is nakar- not attested in languages other than Tamil, but even in Tamil, it is very late. So, in my opinion, Ganesan's proposal of *nakar as a Proto-Dravidian word for crocodile is not an acceptable etymology for Sanskrit nakra, etc.

Palaniappan

I told Ganesan that Tamil nakar 'to creep (as a reptile), to crawl (as
an infant), to sneak away' (TL), to which he had drawn my
attention, might be the sole survivor of Proto-Dravidian *nakar
and in that case a better etymology for Sanskrit
nakra etc. and Proto-Dravidian *nekaL than Proto-Dravidian
*neka- (DEDR 3730) that I proposed on p. 19 of my crocodile
paper (2011).

>>
>> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>
>> Etymology for Sanskrit makara
>>
>> Dravidian Etymological Dictionary (Revised edition, abbreviated as  
>> DEDR) entry 4952 gives the following words for crocodile.
>>
>> 4952 Ta. mutalai, muta?ai, mucali crocodile. Ma. mutala. Ko. moca?.  
>> Ka. mosa?e, masa?e. Ko?. mosale. Tu. mosa??, mudal?, muda??,  
>> m?dal?. Te. mosali. Kol. (Kin.) moseli. Pa. m?ca. Kon?a (BB) m?di,

>> crocodile; (lex.) musali- house-lizard; alligator; Pkt. muduga- =  
>> gr?havi?esa-.
>>
>> Based on the above entry, Bh. Krishnamurti has given  * m?c- /  
>> *moc-V? as the Proto-Dravidian form for the word for crocodile.   
>> (Dravidian Languages, 2003, p. 13).
>>
>> However, on p.7 of his article, Ganesan states, "The  
>> Proto-Dravidian root for makara is *mokaray- a verbal noun from the  
>> verb, *mok-/*mo?ku- 'to eat greedily in large mouthfuls, eat  
>> voraciously, devour, gobble, swallow' (DEDR 5127+4897)."
>>
>> DEDR entries 4897 and 5127 are given below.
>>
>> 4897 Ta. mukku (mukki-) to eat in large mouthfuls; mokku (mokki-),  
>> mokki-tti?- to eat greedily in large mouthfuls. Ka. mukku to eat in  
>> a certain manner, put any dry grain, etc., into the mouth with the  
>> hollowed hand and gobble; mukku?, mukku?e mouthful of water for  
>> rinsing the mouth, rinsing the mouth, cleaning the teeth; mukku?isu  
>> to rinse the mouth, spit out, abandon, reject. Tu. mukkuni to  
>> gobble, swallow, devour; mukk?vuni to over-feed (tr.); mukkele  
>> voracious man; mukkuli, mukku?i mouthful of any liquid;  
>> mukkuliyuni, mukku?iyuni to gargle or rinse the mouth. Te. bokku to  
>> eat greedily, stuff the mouth and eat voraciously, gobble. Kui muka  
>> (muki-) to cast food into the mouth with the hand; mukal mouthful;  
>> mukal giva to rinse out the mouth, take a mouthful, gargle. Kuwi  
>> (Isr.) buk- (-it-) to gobble, swallow. Cf. 5127 Ma. m?kuka.
>>
>> 5127 Ma. m?kuka, m?ntuka to drink, sip; m?yikka to give to sip;  
>> m?val a gulp. Kur. m?xn? to eat (anything except cooked rice);  
>> pass. or refl. m?xrn?; m?xta'?n? to cause or allow someone to eat.  
>> Malt. m?qe to eat (as meat or fruit). ? Ta. moci (-pp-, -tt-) to  
>> eat; m?ntu (m?nti-) to eat, drink, experience, enjoy Cf. 4897 Ta.  
>> mukku.
>>
>> I do not understand how Ganesan could get the Proto-Dravidian  
>> 'root' *mo?ku- from these entries.
>>
>> Having postulated *mok-/*mo?ku- from DEDR 5127 and 4897, Ganesan states:
>>
>> "The Dravidian verb, mok-/mo?k- transforms to moc-/mo?c- in south  
>> Dravidian languages."
>>
>> As far as I know, there has been no basis for such a context-free  
>> transformation mentioned in any work on comparative Dravidian  
>> phonology. (Moreover, as one can see above in DEDR 4592, the words  
>> for 'crocodile' in north Dravidian languages, Kurukh and Malto,  
>> also have -c- and not -k- in DEDR 4952.)
>>
>> Then Ganesan goes on to say:
>>
>> "Hence Kannada and Telugu have mosale or mosali (< *mokaray), and  
>> Tamil and Malayalam derives its mosale> motalai > mutalai from the  
>> same verbal root, mok- with -r- > -l- alternation in the South."
>>
>> Ganesan has not presented any evidence of -oka- transforming to  
>> -oca- or -osa- in south Dravidian languages. So, in my opinion,  
>> Ganesan has not provided an acceptable Dravidian etymology that  
>> supposedly explains Sanskrit 'makara' as well as Tamil mutalai.
>>
>> Etymology for nakra/n?kra
>>
>> Ganesan also has given an etymology for Indo-Aryan words for 
>> gharial, the long-snouted crocodile.
>>
>> On p. 4 of his paper, Ganesan says, " The god ?iva in Tamil bhakti  
>> texts of the first millennium, is extolled as either nakkar or  
>> vi?a?kar indicating ?iva?s nudity and his virile lingam in  
>> particular. These epithets for ?iva and his lingam have origin in  
>> the names for gharial crocodile (Section 3.0). When vi?a?ku is  
>> used, it indicates the naked bhik???ana youth going rounds in the  
>> streets and attracting women: ma?aika? t??um talai kai ?nti  
>> vi?a?kar?kit tirivatu e???? (Tevaram 7.6.1)."
>>
>> The interpretation of Tamil vi?a?kar as indicating a naked ?iva is  
>> simply not valid according to Tamil philology.  Indeed the text  
>> quoted by Ganesan is translated by V. M. Subramanya Iyer in the  
>> Digital T?v?ram edition (from EFEO, Pondicherry) as "what is the  
>> reason for wandering from house to house, assuming a beauteous form  
>> and asking alms, " where he translates vi?a?kar as 'beauteous form?  
>> (http://tinyurl.com/p7vg2wl). ; That vi?a?kar is not naked is shown  
>> by T?v?ram 7.36.3, another verse by Cuntarar, the same person who  
>> authored the verse quoted by Ganesan too. In this verse translated  
>> by V. M. Subramanya Iyer, Vi?a?kar is explicitly described as  
>> wearing a loin-cloth as given below (http://tinyurl.com/nbns4gt).
>>
>> You are pure in your eyes, mouth and body, you wear a sewn  
>> loin-cloth, give up dancing along with p?y in the cremation-ground,  
>> are you a mad person? Our master! Civa?, who is known by the name  
>> of ?ra?iya vi?a?kar in Pai???li surrounded by a verdant garden  
>> which has mast wood trees, cool and green delight of the woods, and 
>> lotus flowers growing in the moats into which water flows.
>>
>> So there is no connection between nudity and vi?a?kar as claimed by Ganesan.
>>
>> On pp. 7-8 of his paper, Ganesan says, "In East India (Nepali,  
>> Bihari, Bengali) (3) nakar is the name of gharial [13], directly  
>> derivable from the Tamil verb, nakar- ?to creep, to crawl slowly?.  
>> Compared to muggers (< makara), gharials have much smaller, weak  
>> legs and cannot do ?high walk? as muggers can (Figures 7, 8). When  
>> gharials come to the shore for sun bathing or for laying eggs, they  
>> creep on the banks awkwardly pushing their huge bodies forward.
