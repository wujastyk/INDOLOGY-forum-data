A website with more information about the film, historical perspectives, and media related to Islamic architecture, literature, and music in South India can be found athttp://yaadhum.com/.

The film, available in both English and Tamil versions, can now be purchased for a mere $20 at the website mentioned above. I highly recommend that scholars who are interested in South Indian and/or Islamic cultures or who teach undergraduate courses on these topics consider purchasing this film or encourage their home institution to do so.
