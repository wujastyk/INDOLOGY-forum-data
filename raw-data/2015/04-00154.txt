While going through Ganguly?s translation of Virata Parva, I was suddenly unable to access the various chapters. Now when I try to access sacred-texts.com <http://sacred-texts.com/> I get this message:

Forbidden

You do not have permission to access this document.

Web Server at sacred-texts.com <http://sacred-texts.com/>


Help would be greatly appreciated. 

Howard
