I think Pr Hock is right, it is a platform problem.

The devanaagarii rendering of the OSX rendering engine is incorrect in the handling of halant in several corner cases.
For instance, the conjunct consonant cCr is incorrectly handled. You may check by this test. When you look at the source of the page, you see the UTF8 encoding of tacCrutvA as:
&#x0924;&#x091A;&#x094D;&#x091B;&#x094D;&#x0930;&#x0941;&#x0924;&#x094D;&#x0935;&#x093E;
corresponding to: tc,C,rut,v
noting "," for virama, and clearly the second virama is incorrectly handled.

I sent an anomaly report on this problem at the official Apple site [http://www.apple.com/fr/macosx/feedback/] on January 28th 2007. It was never acknowledged nor fixed,
through the successive versions of OS X. The rendering of this example is wrong also on my iPhone. So it looks that they fixed Peter's bug but not mine on the iPhone OS?
