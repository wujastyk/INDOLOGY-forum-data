Dear Prof. Pandurangi,

Our good colleague, Prof. Whitaker, has appealed to us all to stop this
discussion.  And all of us have wisely done so, except for you.  Why insult
Prof. Knutson by referring to him as "Prof.  Jesse"?  Then you go on to
compare Prof. Doniger to Hitler.

The reason why we should avoid these sorts of highly emotional discussions
is that they almost always degenerate into this kind of over-emotional
rhetoric.

If you want to argue that Vedic Sanskrit is 10,000 years, please feel
free.  But you have no viable evidence for this claim, since we have no
evidence whatsoever for any writing  system that is that old.  Brief
allusions have been made to the stark differences between urban IVC and
nomadic pastoralist Vedic culture.  In IVC lots of fish signs and
unicorns.  Both are completely absent in Vedic. In Vedic lots of references
to horses and chariots.  Both completely absent in IVC. [There's a lot more
to say about how culturally different IVC is from Vedic [BTW]. If you want
to talk about genetics, please do.

To attack German scholars in particular is rather strange to me, since most
European and Russian and American Indologists have the same views, as well
most Asian Indologists and Latin American Indologists.

I knew that this would happen, as did Prof. Whitaker.  So I second his
request, let us stop this fruitless argument.

Best wishes

George Thompson
