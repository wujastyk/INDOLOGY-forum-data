Subject: [INDOLOGY] Metrically restored Rgveda and traditional recitation
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQEts=-usxODO3aq4VhG4mU2q3E8M1EFLNNsdzodD8EMBg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Do any members know if when the Rg Veda is recited by Vaidikas if that
recitation agrees with the metrically restored Rg Veda or if they recite it
like the written text with the metrical anomalies.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
