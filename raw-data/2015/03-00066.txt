Dear colleagues,

This year the Leiden Summer School in Languages and Linguistics will
celebrate her 10th anniversary. The summer school will be held from 13
until 24 July at the Faculty of Humanities of Leiden University. As always
it includes a full Indology programme but students can also mix courses
from different programmes. For more information and a description of the
courses on offer see:

Kindly inform your students and anybody else interested about the summer
school.

Best wishes,

Peter Bisschop
Leiden University
