Yes, you did not say anything like IVC is superior to Vedic or urban is
superior to pastoral/nomadic. As such, my words do not apply to your post.

I have been working on a shepherd community partly retaining its itinerant
life style partly settled, spread in Telangana, southern Andhra Pradesh and
Karnataka. Prof. Gunther Sontheimer worked on the Maarashtra side of the
topic, earlier to me.

This is, as you can understand, apart from my being one of those looking
back at the painful colonial past of my country.
