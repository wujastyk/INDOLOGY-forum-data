Dear Professor Paturi,

This is not true!

SSR seems to happen frequently as "inter-line" in Ancient Tamil literature.

I believe "intra-line" SSR is less frequent

See the characterizations (taken from the Tolk?ppiyam), which I gave 
yesterday in:

"http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-August/041916.html"

See also for instance, this nice example from the Tolk?ppiyam's 
characterization of the "verb" (vi?ai).

TC195i
vi?aiye?ap pa?uvatu v???umai ko???tu
ni?aiyu? k?laik k?lamo?u t???um.

We have etukai between "vi?ai" and "ni?aiyum", which are both at the 
beginning of a line

(I could provide similar examples if you are not convinced ...)

Part of the problem lies in the fact that, people tend to view the rules 
of ancient Tamil literature through the lenses of medieval treatises 
such as the Y?pparu?kalam and Y?pparu?kalak k?rikai
(which provide a very rich terminology for many marginal examples of 
intra-line SSR)


If you can provde massive evidence from ancient Tamil literature in 
order to support your statement, please do

Your with every good wish
