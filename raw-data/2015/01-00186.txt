Subject: [INDOLOGY] Fwd: Morphomata Fellowship Program 2015/2016 - Call for	Applications
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdtuQ-=A+EOysH13QriyoPCSyeJgB5SQm8hXJ0HEOFy6A@mail.gmail.com>

The Cologne Morphomata project is exceptionally interesting and
wide-ranging.  A really good group of interesting people.  I am certain
that the selectors would not turn a hair at applications from indologists,
as long as they fitted the other criteria specified.
