*/Bh???atantrarahasyam. The Bh???atantrarahasya of Kha??adeva with the 
S?raprak??ik? commentary by N. S. Ramanuja Tatacharya/**. *

N. S. Ramanuja Tatacharya; associate editor S. Lakshminarasimham, 
Regards sur l'Asie du Sud / South Asian Perspectives n? 4, Institut 
Fran?ais de Pondich?ry,xxi, 664 p., 2015.

Language: Sanskrit. *1200 Rs (52 **?**).*ISBN : 978-81-8470-204-0.

The /Bh???atantrarahasya/ of Kha??adeva (17th c.) belongs to the Bh???a 
school of M?m??s?. It deals mainly with the meaning of roots and 
suffixes, and their role in conveying the meaning of the sentence. 
Though this is a topic of grammar, it is widely discussed in Ny?ya and 
M?m??s? works as well. The /Bh???atantrarahasya /is divided into two 
parts. The first part begins with the definition of /dharma/, the main 
concept of M?m??s?, and then deals at length with the meaning of 
injunctional suffix (/li?/), refuting the views of logicians and 
establishing /bh?van? /(creative energy) as the main meaning of the 
sentence. In the second part, the author discusses the meaning of 
nominal suffixes (/sup/), quoting relevant rules from P??inian grammar. 
Though Kha??adeva's interpretation of P??inian rules deviates from the 
grammatical tradition in some cases, he tries to prove that there is no 
violation of grammar by the M?m??sakas.

Given the complexity of the /Bh???atantrarahasya/, Prof. Ramanuja 
Tatacharya presents it here with his own commentary, the 
/S?raprak??ik?/. Also included are an index of the P??inian rules, an 
index of the /k//?//rik//?/s (citations) and a bibliography.
