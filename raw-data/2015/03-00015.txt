Dear Colleagues


I am delighted to announce the Third Australian  Spoken Sanskrit Summer School  7--19 February 2016


Please distribute this as widely as possible:

The course:  student-focussed learning featuring basic conversation, verses, songs, role-play and drama. We will provide two streams: one for introductory Spoken Sanskrit, and one for intermediate students who have some previous experience. It will be possible for Australian students to take this course as credit towards a degree or diploma. Morning and evening meditation sessions will be offered.

Instructor:  Pandit Dr Sadananda Das is widely acknowledged as a pre-eminent teacher of Spoken Sanskrit today.  His classes are lively and engaging, varied and enjoyable. Sadananda has delighted and stimulated students all over the world for nearly two decades.

Prerequisites: at least one year of Sanskrit studies at tertiary level or equivalent. It will be assumed that students have a good command of basic Sanskrit grammar and can read Devanagari with some fluency before commencing the course.

Location: The Australian National University's magnificent coastal campus, Kioloa, sits amid 500 hectares of rolling fields and forests, just a few minutes' walk down a sandy track from the local surf beach on the South Coast of New South Wales.

Accommodation:  a residential and fully catered (vegetarian) with three meals a day, plus morning and afternoon tea.  Comfortable dormitory-style rooms are provided.
Registration (A$200):  by 1 May 2015.  Final payment (TBC, A$1500-$2000): by 30 November 2015
