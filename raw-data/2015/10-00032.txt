Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ananya Vajpeyi on Hindutva, caste,	and Brahminical values

The comments the article has attracted are worth reading, too. I could access them with Safari as the browser but not with Google Chrome. 

In the comments, there seemed to be a ratio of about 1 (favourable) : 2 (non-favourable/critical of some major point). Somehow, The Hindu?s ?thumbs up : thumbs down? way of evaluating did not match the rough count I made. 

On the whole, it is only the comments in the second group that seemed to go into the details of Dr. Vajpeyi?s argumentation.

If I have missed something in the experience summarized above, please let me know how I could make it up.
