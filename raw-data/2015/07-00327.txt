I meant to send this to the whole list but it went to Dominik only which was probably why he got deluged with similar messages from others:
--

Although there is Fair Use which covers quite a bit of "for scholarly purposes."
<In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and ?transformative? purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner. In other words, fair use is a defense against a claim of copyright infringement. If your use qualifies as a fair use, then it would not be considered an illegal infringement.>
This was plagiarized from http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/

Arlo, plagiarism doesn't, according to the various public definitions, depend on intention.? There is no distinction - formally speaking - between sloppiness and plagiarism.? This has already been discussed, about a week ago ("manslaugher vs. murder").

This is an error that people make about copyright too.? "For scholarly purposes" means nothing, under the law.?? Breaching copyright means physically ...making...a...copy.? It doesn't matter why.? If you copy something physically, without permission, you've breached the copyright-holder's rights.? It's Act, not Intent.? 

Best,
Dominik
