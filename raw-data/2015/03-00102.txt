Dear Friends,

I just did a search of the Indology archives for the terms
*??ntam?rti* and *??ntim?rti,
*however, the search produced no results. I thought perhaps I might come
across this term in the ??nti Parva, although a quick search came up also
with no results.

I'm wondering if anyone has come across such a term in reference to
'embodiers of quietude' in any text, and if so, could you please inform me
of this particular text.

Thank you.





All the best,
