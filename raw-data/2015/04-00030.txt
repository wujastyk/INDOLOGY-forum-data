Dear Indology List, Suresh, Palaniappan ?

Thank you immensely for discussing this topic and bringing out the details to the unknown.

I just wanted to share some sporadic thoughts, which have been painful for me over the years.

There?s a problem of methodology here. 

(i) The saddest situation is that many Westerners (scholars or not) have been somehow captivated by Naga.Ganesan?s (NG?s) gesture, and have been exploited by him. NG has been promoting himself as someone who helps Westerners with his knowledge of this and that. I?ve heard that he?d send books/computers ? and people would fall at his feet for that gesture!! How sick! I know for sure that a few of my academic colleagues have fallen a prey. These academic colleagues are so lame to do their own research but would ask NG for ready reference and there you go ? a pile of Googlish junk at hand for those lazy Westerners to extrapolate.

(ii) Our teacher Auvai Duraicami Pillai explained to us that ?viTankar? (vi?ankar) was ?one formed without being chiseled.? 

	(iia) In any case, ?i?ankar? (for crocodile in ca?kam texts) and ?vitankar? (for referring to ?iva in bhakti texts) are NOT related.

(iii) The Internet has been harboring a lot of unfortunate mishmashings.

++++++++++++++

I sincerely thank the Indology List for maintaining its integrity.

Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam

I shall first discuss whether Ganesan has not read Ghose?s conclusions or purposefully avoids mentioning them in response to you. In doing that I shall update the information provided by Ghose and also explain why Na?ar?ja in Tanjore temple was probably called Dak?i?a M?ru Vi?a?kar. Next I shall discuss Ganesan?s past behavior of selective withholding of information that contradicted his view and even presenting false information in connection with encoding of Grantha script in Unicode. (Some members of this list were involved in evaluating such information.) Finally, I shall discuss the implications of Ganesan's thesis for Indology in general and comparative Dravidian linguistics and Tamil philology in particular. Those interested in the details can read on.

> 
> In his response to you, Ganesan has cited Ghose using the term Vi?a?kar to refer to the li?ga on pp. 51, 139, and 140 of her book. What Ghose has given on p. 51 is endnote 61 in which she says:
> "...though the Chidambaram candramaul??vara is made of crystal and it seems most likely that it is this, which is referred to as Tillai Vi?a?kar in epigraphs". 
> 
> Ghose points to endnote 61 on p. 30 in the main body of the text.  In the immediate next paragraph on p.30, Ghose says:
> "The term Vi?a?ka is now unquestioningly accepted as of Sanskritic origin and etymologically split into vi+?a?ka 'one made without the use of the chisel' and consequently a svayambh? or self-manifested li?ga and it is this self manifestation which makes it specially sacred. It seems unlikely that this is what the word meant in earlier times in Tamil literature and epigraphy."

> After further discussing other lexical meanings of Vi?a?ka and even its tantric meaning, Rajeshwari Ghose says on p.31:

> 
> Thus when Ghose says on p. 139, "At twelve o'clock the abhi?eka is done to the marakata Vi?a?kar (the emerald linga) in the Ty?gar?ja shrine," she is simply using the term as currently used in the temple. The same is true for p. 140 too. But, as Ghose notes on p. 30, she doubts if this usage prevailed in earlier times.
> 
> This leads one to wonder why Ganesan refers to a footnote mentioned by Ghose in one paragraph but does not mention a conclusion of hers given in the very next paragraph? I do not believe that lack of reading the following paragraph could be the reason.
> 
> It should also be noted that Ghose wrote on p. 35 that "Though no iconographical descriptions of the Vi?a?kar are given by the T?v?ram writers or by the epigraphs, the fact that nowadays processional images are Som?skandas makes it probable that the Vi?a?kas were Som?skandas in the Pallava and C??a times as well.?  This statement by Ghose needs to be updated. R. Nagaswamy, the epigraphist, does give an iconographic description of Vi?a?kar as representing an anthropomorphic icon in the introduction in his later book "B?had??vara Temple: Form and Meaning", Aryan Publications, 2010, p. 2 (see http://ignca.nic.in/kp_10.htm <http://ignca.nic.in/kp_10.htm>) as given below: 
> 
> "An inscription of R?jar?ja Co?a I discovered by me reveals for the first time, the complete iconography of a metal image (copper) called Mah?m?ru-Vi?a?kar consecrated by R?jar?ja, which consists of ?iva with his consort P?rvat?, seated on the mountain M?ru with his two sons, Gane?a and Subrahma?ya, and other deities like S?rya, Candra, V??abha, dwarfs and a tree. Such a group of images on the mountain M?ru, made of metal, is unique in the history of South India and has not been known to exist or has been referred to anywhere in Tamil Nadu. Another image made of copper also consecrated by R?jar?ja was called Dak?i?a M?ru-Vi?a?kar alias ??avall?r, the dancing form of Na?ar?ja. These two images - Mah?m?ru-Vi?a?kar and Dak?i?a-M?ru-Vi?a?kar - are mentioned as the two principal metal images in the temple in many inscriptions."[3] <file:///C:/Users/S.%20Palaniappan/Documents/Response%20to%20Suresh%20on%20Vitangkar-2.docx#_edn3>
> 
> In the above inscription, Mah?m?ru referred to the mythical M?ru mountain supposed to be in the north. Dak???a M?ru referred to the Chidambaram temple. The Chidambaram temple was probably called Dak?i?a M?ru because its roof was covered with gold shingles.[4] <file:///C:/Users/S.%20Palaniappan/Documents/Response%20to%20Suresh%20on%20Vitangkar-2.docx#_edn4> Dak?i?a-M?ru-Vi?a?kar meant ?the beautiful one of Chidambaram? or Na?ar?ja.
> 
> In fact, these are not the only inscriptions that clearly link the use of ?Vi?a?kar? to refer to Som?skanda or Na?ar?ja, both being non-naked forms of ?iva. In an inscription of 1060 CE in the Some?varasv?mi temple in Punganur, in Chittoor District in Andhra Pradesh, two icons were mentioned as being installed.[5] <file:///C:/Users/S.%20Palaniappan/Documents/Response%20to%20Suresh%20on%20Vitangkar-2.docx#_edn5> One was called ?Um?skanda sahita tirum?ni Vijayar?ja Vi?a?kar? and the other was ?Tirucci??ampalamu?aiy?r ?r?kara?a Vi?a?kar?. The first one was the Som?skanda icon and the second one was the Na?ar?ja icon. The name ?r?kara?a Vi?a?kar clearly indicates ?the beautiful one (who is performing) the sacred kara?a?. The second one was also referred to as ???aval?r ?r?kara?avi?a?kar? elsewhere in the inscription. That Natar?ja was called ?Vi?a?kar? is proven by this inscription. Similarly, another inscription of 1070 CE in Mugavadi in the same district mentions a Som?skanda icon as ?Um?skanda sahita tirum?nik K?r??ai Vi?a?kar?.[6] <file:///C:/Users/S.%20Palaniappan/Documents/Response%20to%20Suresh%20on%20Vitangkar-2.docx#_edn6>

> Given all these attested uses of Vi?a?ka meaning 'beauteous', it is interesting that Ganesan has not answered your question as to why he considers DEDR 5472 meaning for Vi?a?ka is incorrect. Instead he has chosen to repeat his fantasies as facts in his response. Interestingly, in a post sent to some Internet lists (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/lC7RRAFRb7c/kuP2K9jmd2MJ <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/lC7RRAFRb7c/kuP2K9jmd2MJ>), Ganesan cites V. M. Subramanya Aiyar in connection with T?v?ram 7.36 but fails to note that Aiyar interprets vi?a?ku as 'beauty' in T?v?ram 7.36.10 (http://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/site/digital_tevaram/U_TEV/VMS7_036.HTM#p10 <http://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/site/digital_tevaram/U_TEV/VMS7_036.HTM#p10>).

> Ganesan?s past use of data in support of his views:
> Ganesan does have a history of selectively withholding information or presenting even fabricated information in order to promote his viewpoint. See  http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11026-infitt-wg02-reports.pdf <http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11026-infitt-wg02-reports.pdf> for a report, which critically evaluated the evidence offered by Ganesan to support his proposal to the Unicode Technical Committee to add some Tamil-specific characters to the Grantha script. (Mani Manivannan, the author of this report, is also a CTamil member. Ganesan's proposal can be accessed at http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2009/09345-grantha.pdf <http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2009/09345-grantha.pdf>. )
> 
> Manivannan's report describes a special meeting arranged at Ecole fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient (EFEO), Pudhucceri on December 22, 2010 to evaluate Ganesan's proposal. A few members of our Indology list, participated in that meeting (see p.2 of the report) too. The report presents evidence of Ganesan selectively withholding information contradicting his case (see p. 8 of the report) as well as offering textual evidence from a non-existent publication from a non-existent organization, i.e., Samskrita Granthalipi Sabha (see pp. 12-13 of the report). (In spite of many requests since 2010, Ganesan has not provided the contact information for the Samskrita Granthalipi Sabha.) This modus operandi of his may suggest if he has not read Ghose?s conclusions or purposefully avoided mentioning them.
> 
> As is his habit in discussions like this, Ganesan has made sure that his CTamil post, in which he repeated his fantasies as facts, was the last in the thread as though he has won the scholarly debate. Also, after his response to you in CTamil list, he has posted in some Tamil lists the contents of his response to your CTamil message. See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/lC7RRAFRb7c/kuP2K9jmd2MJ <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/lC7RRAFRb7c/kuP2K9jmd2MJ>. He has also posted the contents of another post in CTamil with a preface in Tamil that suggests that he has shown you how *moka?ay gives rise to makara in the Indus region and moca?e in Kannada in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/lC7RRAFRb7c/3iCIpf3m3RAJ <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/lC7RRAFRb7c/3iCIpf3m3RAJ>. (Thus, he has changed his reconstruction of the word for crocodile from *mokaray to *moka?ay.) For the most part, the members of these lists are not comparative linguists. Many may not have access to the resources such as the book by Rajeshwari Ghose. So when he deliberately withholds relevant information contradicting his case, many members of these lists may be misled into believing that Ganesan's fantasies are facts indeed. 
> 
> You may remember that the two lists, CTamil and Indo-Eurasian Research, were set up after the old Indology list restricted its membership. Ganesan was a member of both lists initially. When he tried to post his fantasies on the Indo-Eurasian Research list, he was asked not to do so and was later expelled from the list. 
> 
> Implications for Indology
> One of the reasons for a detailed discussion of Ganesan's work is that he has said that he is going to present a paper on this topic at the upcoming World Sanskrit Conference in Thailand, which many Sanskritists may attend. I hope they find the comparative Dravidian and Tamil philological information discussed here useful.
> 
> More importantly, the support Ganesan?s view enjoys among Indologists such as Prof. Nachimuthu raises serious questions about the present state of comparative Dravidian linguistics and Tamil philology in India. After all, Nachimuthu was the Chairperson of Center of Indian Languages (CIL) at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi and is currently the Head of the Department of Tamil at the Central University of Tamil Nadu at Tiruv?r?r. His specialized/applied areas of research are supposed to be classical literature, grammar, and linguistics. Nachimuthu is also on the Tamil Research and Translation faculty of International School of Dravidian Linguistics (ISDL). See http://www.ijdl.org/Html/Members.htm <http://www.ijdl.org/Html/Members.htm>. 
> 
> According to ISDL, ?The Faculty is recruited only by invitation from among scholars of repute.? If such a reputed scholar cannot realize the fallacies in Ganesan?s Makara-Vi?a?kar thesis, the state of scholarship in Tamil philology and comparative Dravidian linguistics in India is a cause for concern indeed.  As for ISDL, they seemed to have agreed to publish Ganesan?s paper with the bad reconstruction, *mokaray. Now that he has changed *mokaray to *moka?ay--still a bad reconstruction--I do not know what ISDL will do.  It looks like ISDL did not ask any comparative Dravidian linguist to review Ganesan?s paper. Ironically, ISDL also has Prof. P. S. Subrahmanyam, the reputed comparative Dravidian linguist, on its Linguistics Faculty!

> [2] <file:///C:/Users/S.%20Palaniappan/Documents/Response%20to%20Suresh%20on%20Vitangkar-2.docx#_ednref2> Actually, the ?aiva canonical works use Vi?a?ka or its honorific form Vi?a?kar to connote something beautiful not merely ?often? but in every instance. Ghose has used ?often? because she has erroneously taken the use of ?Vi?a?ka? in T?v?ram 4.81.9 to refer to the li?ga in Chidambaram (p. 36). Thus, she implies T?v?ram 4.81.9 to be the earliest use of Vi?a?ka in connection with a li?ga while earlier it simply meant something beautiful. As explained by V. M. Subramaniya Ayyar in Digital Tev?ram, Vi?a?ka means ?beautiful? in T?v?ram 4.81.9 too. (See http://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/site/digital_tevaram/U_TEV/DM4_81.HTM#p9 <http://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/site/digital_tevaram/U_TEV/DM4_81.HTM#p9>) Ghose did not make use of the comparative linguistic evidence provided by Dravidian Etymological Dictionary entry #5472.  If she had, she would have concluded the meaning of Vi?a?kar to be ?a beautiful person? much more definitely.
> [3] <file:///C:/Users/S.%20Palaniappan/Documents/Response%20to%20Suresh%20on%20Vitangkar-2.docx#_ednref3> Clearly V??a?kar referring to an anthropomorphic ?iva is earlier than Vi?a?kar referring to a li?ga since we have "Dak?i?a M?ru-Vi?a?kar alias ??avall?r" referring to Na?ar?ja in Tanjavur. Moreover, literary texts such as Tiruppall???u 4 by C?nta??r (ca. 10th century) and Tiruvicaipp? 10 by Tirum??ikaitt?var (10th/11th century) clearly refer to Chidambaram Na?ar?ja as Vi?a?ka? meaning 'a person of beauty'. Campantar in T?v?ram 3.68.5 refers to ?iva dancing in Kail?sa as 'na?am taru vi?a?ka?' (dancing Vi?a?ka?) which scholars have interpreted as 'dancing person of beauty' (see http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/onepage.php?thiru=3&Song_idField=3068 <http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/onepage.php?thiru=3&Song_idField=3068>).
> [4] <file:///C:/Users/S.%20Palaniappan/Documents/Response%20to%20Suresh%20on%20Vitangkar-2.docx#_ednref4> Periyapur??am 250 and 2071 compare the P?rampalam in the Chidambaram temple to M?ru because of its roof gilded with gold by Kulottu?ga C??a II in the 12th century. But the Ci??ampalam, the central shrine of Na?ar?ja seems to have had the gold roof from the time of T?v?ram 5.2.8.
