Dear all,
there is also a Kew general botanical index (I have the URL at home, cannot give it now) which I have found very useful. Quite many colleagues (e.g. R. Syed) have used Roxburgh flora, although it is, of course, wholly anticipated (publ. 1820-24). I do not, but as my brother as a professional botanist says, this is acceptable, when clearly announced and consistently done ? then it is always possible to find the valid games. A further problem is that there are many cases where a simple X = Y does not work. When the plant X is Y in the north, it may also be Z in the south and so on. And this depends on (supposed or real) similar medical properties, not on any botanical affinity.

Best
Klaus

But probably you mean Saussurea costus, (Falc.) Lipsch., no?  (last updated 28 August 2014, and syn. Aucklandia costus Falc.).

It's not a real botanical name, because no authority is given.  It's like a bibliography entry without authors or publication dates.   Also, it's been formally decommissioned <http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/gcc-142953> as a botanical name, in favour of S. costus (Falc.) Lipsch.  It's not that easy to find this stuff out; it's a specialized field.  But I strongly recommend anyone using botanical terminology to use resources like

Botanicus offers a huge free library of scanned and indexed botanical publications from the fifteenth century onwards, that all are searchable and downloadable.  It includes many early works from India and Sri Lanka, and give a wonderful entry-point for finding images of plants by early engravers, and so forth.

There's so much confusion and error in this field, that it's vital in serious work to give some parameters for the identification.  Meulenbeld's appendices to his Madavanidana book give the very best available listing of the X = Y type.  But that is simply a record of what assertions have been made by people in the past.  What we require today is *reasons* for thinking that X=Y, and that might include historical correlations, medicinal use, pre-modern descriptions of form or colour, etymology of the name, cognates of the Sanskrit name still used in NIA languages, local knowledge (past and present), and so forth.  Also, plants mutate, and two thousand years is plenty of time for change, in evolutionary terms.  The time of simple uncommented lists of the form X=Y is past.
