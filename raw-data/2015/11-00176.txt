Yes, we are far from rubrication ? but a parallel to Ashok's dust-board is the preliminary writing of a plaint in a court of law on what they say is "phalaka", or chalk board, where corrections are made and the plaint written down permanently on a patra. See N?rada Sm?ti m?t?k?, 2:18; B?haspati Sm?ti 1.2.30.
