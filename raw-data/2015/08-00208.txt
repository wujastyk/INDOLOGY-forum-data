Thank you - the .pdf informs us at the end that it is based on the edition of Kapiladeva Tripa?t?hi? (1990).

>      The source of Kudd?la for his statements in his Intro to Pata?jali's Mahabh??ya must be statements found in Vaidyan?tha P?yagu??e's commentary Ch?ya on N?ge?a's Uddyota.  All these quotes are found in the introductory verses of Ch?ya (Vol 1, Vy?kara?a-Mah?bh??ya, ed. Shivadatta Kaddala, Nirnayasagara, 1917, p2), where Vaidyan?tha refers to Par??araPur??a, and Vi??udharmottara.

Hazra Studies in the Upapur??as vol. 1, 1958, pp. 4-12), but Hazra, who should have deal with it in the 3rd unpublished vol. of his "Studies" (the one on the ?aiva upap.), does not give any reference nor comment on it, except the following footnote in vol. 1 p. 5 : "Thus the Par??ara-upapur??a seems to be distinguished from the Vi??u-p. or the spurious 'Vai??ava' (mentioned by Vall?lasena in his D?nas?gara, p. 7, verse 63), which was spoken out by Par??ara".

>>      In his Sanskrit introduction to the first volume of the Nirnayasagara edition of Pata?jali's Vy?kara?a-Mah?bh??ya (1917, p. 16, fn 5), the editor Shivadatta Kuddala says that this verse is from Par??ara-Upapur??a.  The same source is given for the traditional definitions of S?tra and V?rttika. (Kudd?la, Intro, p. 12 and 14).  For the definition of S?tra, Kudd?la also refers to Vi???dharmottara (ibid, p. 12).  On p. 11 of his Introduction, Kudd?la quotes the following verse from Par??ara-Upapur??a:
