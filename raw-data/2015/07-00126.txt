"Cut to 2015, and we now have the Rajiv Malhotra issue. His explanation for lifting passages from various publications was that ?Sanskrit language has no quotation marks.?

Interestingly, this article too does not address the main ?explanation." It also does not mention that Malhotra admitted he could have done a better job at citation.
