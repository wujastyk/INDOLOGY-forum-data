Subject: [INDOLOGY] Eight types of marriages ...
Message-ID: <B5A9659D-DEB2-4E98-8099-A9459909A09A@earthlink.net>

Dear List Members,

I?m re-searching/re-studying the Tamil text iRaiyanAr kaLaviyal (i?aiya??r ka?aviyal; ???????? ???????).

In this text, a comparison is made between the ?gandharva? type of marriage among the ?eight types of marriages? (of the Vedic tradition?) to kaLavu (ka?avu; ????) of the Tamil type.

I would appreciate to have access to the earliest reference (and relevant interpretations) of the ?eight types of marriages (ashTavivAha)? as mentioned in the Vedic (?) tradition.


I have several questions, but for now here are my specific questions:

1. In which type of marriage(s) did a woman have the right to choose her partner/husband?
	
2. What was the basic criterion for giving away a bride in marriage to someone OR taking a bride?

3. What is told/informed to a bride and groom during the wedding ceremony about ?marital fidelity?? 

4. What is the precise Vedic (?) term for ?marital fidelity??

Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
