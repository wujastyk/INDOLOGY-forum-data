>On pp. 7-8 of his paper, Ganesan says, "In East India (Nepali, Bihari, Bengali) (3) nakar is the name of gharial [13], directly derivable from the Tamil verb, nakar- ?to creep, to crawl slowly?. Compared to muggers (< makara), gharials have much smaller, weak legs and cannot do ?high walk? as muggers can (Figures 7, 8). When gharials come to the shore for sun bathing or for laying eggs, they creep on the banks awkwardly pushing their huge bodies forward. From this Dravidian nakar, Sanskrit gets nakra-/n?kra- and Middle Indo-Aryan nakka-. In Tamil Tevaram texts, ?iva is called nakkar/nakka? due to his nudity traceable to the phallus shape of the gharial snout and its ancient name."          
>          
>While Ganesan easily moves from Tamil nakar to Dravidian nakar, DEDR does not include an entry that includes Tamil nakar 'to creep, to crawl slowly'. There seem to be no cognates of nakar in any other Dravidian language including Telugu and Kannada. (nakar is not included in Emeneau and Burrow's  "Dravidian Borrowings from Indo-Aryan" either.) So Tamil nakar 'to creep slowly, crawl slowly' being the source of Indo-Aryan nakra/n?kra is not very convincing to me.  As a result, tracing nakkar/nakka? (referring to ?iva) "to the phallus shape of the gharial snout and its ancient name" also seems to be impossible.

> So vi?a?kar in Tamil means gharial.           
>          
>According to Ganesan, vi?a?kar lost the initial v- and became i?a?kar.           
>          
>The word vi?a?kar referring to a crocodile occurs for the first time in the Varatar?ca Aiya?k?r P?kavatam, a 16th century text. Earlier literary texts or lexicons do not mention that word. But earlier texts going back to 2nd century CE mention i?a?kar in the sense of 'crocodile'.  In several instances in the Kampar?m?ya?am (ca. 9th or 12th century), i?a?kar is the word used to describe the crocodile that attacked the elephant in the Gajendra Mok?a episode. (For example, see Kampar???ya?am 5.12.79.3.)          
>          
>(In fact, contrary to Ganesan?s suggestion of vi?a?kar being the original form, which lost v- to result in i?a?kar, I would argue that the original form was indeed i?a?kar and the form vi?a?kar probably resulted from a reanalysis of a manuscript line such as tuyi??a?avi?a?karm?tta?a?ka???um? in Kampar?m?ya?am Kitkint? K???am K?rk?lappa?alam published in 1862 as shown in Attachment 2, where ?v- is a glide resulting from the morphophonemics of joining tuyi??a?a ending in -a and i?a?kar beginning in i-. When the words in the quoted line are separated, the word in question is taken as i?ankar as can be seen in http://tinyurl.com/kd756qp .)     
>          
>Even if one accepts the form vi?a?kar to be earlier, in the 16th century text, the word 'vi?a?kar' is used in connection with crocodile-elephant encounter. Since gharials are not known to attack even human beings, it is doubtful if they are biologically equipped to attack big elephants. Even in the Ma?im?kalai (6th century CE), the moat around K??ci was described as having crocodiles indicated by the term i?a?kar, which means that i?a?kar cannot be identified as gharial.  (As gharials do not attack human beings, they would not have been used in moats, which were designed to ward off attacks by hostile warriors.) So the case of vi?a?kar/i?a?kar representing gharial is not defensible.          
>          
>Conclusions          
>          
>In my opinion, Ganesan's etymologies for Sanskrit makara and nakra/n?kra are not supported by comparative Dravidian linguistic evidence or Tamil philology. Also, his etymological interpretation of Tamil vi?a?kar/i?a?kar is not supported by Tamil philology.           
>          
>In January 2012 Ganesan stated that the article had been published in "Prof. V. I. Subramonium commemoration volume, ISDL, Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala, 2011". Later, in February 2013 he stated that the article had been published in "Prof. V. I. Subramonian Memorial Volume, International School of Dravidian Linguistics, 2011, (Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala)". International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, Volume 39, Issue 2 published in June 2010 was called "PROFESSOR V. I. SUBRAMONIAM MEMORIAL VOLUME" as can be seen in Attachment 3. Ganesan's article was not included in that volume. Nor was it published in the IJDL issues of 2011. There was no commemoration volume published by ISDL in 2011.

>However, there is going to be a separate Professor V. I. Subramoniam Commemoration Volume that will be published in June 2015 during the 43rd annual conference of Dravidian Linguistics Association to be held in Annamalai University in Tamil Nadu. Ganesan?s article may be included in Professor V. I. Subramoniam Commemoration Volume.
