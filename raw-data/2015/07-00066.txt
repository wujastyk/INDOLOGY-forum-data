Subject: [INDOLOGY] Article by Jean Filliozat in Yoga et Vie 26 (1978)?
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cdd=xXmw93m+JyMPLxgw=Sbk1=1R75y891O7WWWEWLYBg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,
?

I would like to read Jean Filliozat's article "Le Yoga et les substances
psychotropes" that was published in
?the journal ?
?*?*
*Y*
*?oga ?*
*?et*
*? ?*
*V*
*?ie*?
num. 26
?, in 1978?
.

?The journal is published by ??l?Association du Centre de Relations
Culturelles Franco-Indien, who have written to me offering an annual
subscription to the current issue of the journal?.  The organization took a
year to send me this response.  Before I start wrangling with them about
the specific issue of their journal, I thought I'd ask INDOLOGY.

Can you help with this?

Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
