Agreed, on some Malhotran points.

Yes: need for "humble introspection". But: no need for that on the side of
the representatives of the Sanskritic cultural sphere?

A "scholarly disapassionate examination of the attitudes and assumptions
of" the representatives of the Sanskritic  cultural sphere "toward objects,
processes, and events held sacred by lots of people".

Open demonstrations of disregard, deep contempt. Gatekeepers, encroachments
into the sphere of ideas punished.

Best,

Artur
