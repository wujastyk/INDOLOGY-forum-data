The call deserves sympathetic attention.
In India, however, local organizations are collecting and arranging for
despatch. In such cases our University, too, usually deducts a portion from
the pay of employees and ex-employees and sends it thru the Central
Government. The Central Government is active in raising fund.
My own state West Bengal too is affected, so is neighboring Bihar badly. A
huge task before us.
Best
D.B.
