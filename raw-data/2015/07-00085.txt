Subject: [INDOLOGY] Release of Sanskrit Heritage Engine software
Message-ID: <D8DEFDE4-2B58-4237-8C9A-D124761B7D0D@inria.fr>

At the occasion of the World Sanskrit Conference in Bangkok, a public distribution of the Sanskrit Heritage Engine software has been released,
together with a user's reference manual for the various tools. 
This version allows using the tools as Web services on your own workstation, provided it runs some version of Unix, such as Linux or Mac OSX.
The user manual tells how to download the software and install it. Please report any difficulty or anomaly.
Best regards,
G?rard Huet
