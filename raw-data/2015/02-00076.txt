Subject: [INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences
In-Reply-To: <CABEB9qKt0RXrSyMxYrWPhHuGH=zJNhaadmqV4wodafPvGBiwEQ@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFDKB44i=9TSp34OgMd5Ujoj4vFP1OjqF6r3cokgcHBuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dipak Bhattacharya raises a point I've wondered about.
1) Why wasn't (until recently) avagraha used to resolve this kind of
ambiguity.
2)  Is avagraha only a written sign or is it some kind of pause in spoken
Sanskrit
3) How far back does avagraha go.  To Panini, pre-Panini, post-Panini ?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
