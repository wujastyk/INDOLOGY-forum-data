Dear List Members,

I am happy to share with you information on my latest book ?Understanding
the Hindu Temple, History, Symbols and Forms?,  which came out  this month. It is a hardcover book with 167 pages and
colour illustrations.  The price is of 35
Euros



The book is the second volume of the publication series, 'Studies in Asian Art
and Culture' (SAAC) which Prof. Julia Hegewald (University of Bonn) has
established with EB-Publishers in Berlin (http://www.ebverlag.de,)



Below are a
few information on  the Volume.  

 

The Hindu temple encompasses
multiple symbolic meanings with various levels of interpretation. This book
aims to explain  this complex web of
symbolism which have inspired and justified the building of the Hindu temple,
from the beginnings through the development to the most complex forms. A
comprehensive treatment of the diverse aspects of the sacred Hindu architecture
is provided, in term of the religious and philosophical principles, the textual
heritage, the mythological references and the various iconographic traditions
embodied in the  Hindu sanctuaries. 

Distinct chapters are dedicated to the following
topics: 

1) The multi-level relationship
between the temple, the cosmos and the body of the primordial being. 

2) The antecedents of the Indian
sacred monuments ? timber and rock-cut 
structures.

3) The basic structures of the
Hindu temple and the main temple typologies. 


4) Temple sculptural elements, both
anthropomorphic and symbolic. 

5) The historical, political,
economic, and social role played by the temple in Indian society from its
medieval origins to modern time. 

This multi-faceted subject-matter
is also treated in the perspective of a historical comparison of differences
and similarities with some fundamental examples from Western traditions and
practices of constructing the sacred.  

 Best Wishes, 

Tiziana Lorenzetti
