Dear all

I am looking for the exact details, like publication year etc of a book
Muktavali (probably Nyayasiddhanta Muktavali of Visvanatha) Commentary or
Edited By Rajendra Chandra Sastrin

I found quoting this book in A History of Indain Logic by Satis Chandra
Vidyabhusana Motilal Banarassidas Page 404 footnotes.


Regards
KP
