Subject: [INDOLOGY] On "Spirituality" and the new gods and goddesses of	Modi's India
Message-ID: <CAHxuC0QkSZWwc=_8YZdG817tf+Xi9q2Zq8kDX3KHfqD45zpKEA@mail.gmail.com>

Here's an incisive and interesting interview with Ashis Nandy, clinical
psychologist, social analyst and cultural critic par excellence, b?te-noire
of puritans and purists across disciplines, on why god-men (and women), and
so-called spiritual leaders are becoming more and more garish and
cartoon-like in India of late: http://bit.ly/1ffB431

All best,
