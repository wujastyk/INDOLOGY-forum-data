Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indology and plagiarism: specify stance in order to fortify "brand name" (and conclude lengthy threads)

Dear Colleagues,

I am responding to this thread as the INDOLOGY committee member on duty
this week.

The INDOLOGY governing committee moderate discussion on the list, not other
scholarly activities. Accordingly, alleged plagiarism in scholarship
concerning South Asia is certainly a welcome topic of civil discussion on
INDOLOGY. But the governing committee does not claim authority to
adjudicate or discipline anything that happens off list.
