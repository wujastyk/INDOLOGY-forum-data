Jo(h)annes Ernestus Hanxleden and Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo  are remembered in Malayalam tradition as, respectively,  ar???s? p?tiri  (?Father Ernest(o)?) and paulin?s? p?tiri  ('Father Paulinos'). I suppose that their Indian name was something accepted and used by themselves in the local context.
