Subject: What does 'arham' mean?
Message-ID: <161227074569.23782.1977078567552377831.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Friends

The first chapter of PUrNabhadra's PaJcatantra opens with the words:

arham | auM namaH zrIsarasvatyai |

The other four chapters open with the single word

arham |

Can any of you good folk tell me what arham means in this context? Is it
commonly used in this way?

Many thanks in advance.

McComas
