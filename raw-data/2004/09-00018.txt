Dear friends

May I ask for your patient assistance again? I have seen somewhere a tale
about a jackal who married a lioness. Can any of you good folk tell me where
I might find an original text? I don't think it is anywhere in the
PaJcatantra or Hitopadeza cycles. Is it a JAtaka?

With thanks in advance

McComas
