In these "interesting times" with the wholesale destruction of
Buddhist art in Afghanistan (including the Bamiyan Buddhas), the
burning of the Sanskrit college in Nepal with its estimated 12,000
uncataloged manuscripts, the looting and destruction in Iraq, and now
attacks on members of the Indology community directly it is clear
that we are in a situation that requires information and for better
or worse, opinions about it. It is therefore my suggestion that any
factual information, accounts by witnesses, and even opinions should
be encouraged.  An over awareness of these alarming events and
movements would be much better than walking into a situation
blissfully unaware.

Susan and I were  bombed once in Calcutta by the Naxalites and we did
not enjoy a single moment of it.

Peace
