At least this is a list-specific spam, not about Vyagra (some may contend
that vyagra spam is also list specific) and it does not affect my Y-Indology
mail. There are lot of places where a DoS attack against bagchee.com can be
set up.

But I woul recommend Clamav with Spam Assassin. And report the intruder to
http://www.spamassassin.org

Best,
Plamen
