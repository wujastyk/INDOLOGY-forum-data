I mean the anatomical substratum of thought situated in the head. While,
according to almost all Indian traditions, the organ of thought, manas, is
situated in the heart, hence can not be an equivalent to the real
physiological brain. Looking into the English-Sanskrit dictionary, I find
mastika, buddhi and mati as the Sanskrit meanings of brain. I find also
sirostha (what is in the head).

Dear members,

Is there an equivalent to brain in Indian darsanas or Ayurvedic teachings?
There is [I]manas[/I] (mind) in the heart, [I]buddhi[/I] (intellect) I don't
know where, but probably in the - and serving as the - universal matrix of
all [I]mahabhutas[/I], [I]cetas[/I] (pure conscious mentality) which
contains and is made up of pure [I]manas-sattva[/I], and all these three are
often referred to as [I]citta[/I] (consciousness).

None of them is even slightly the brain.

Could you give me some guidance in my attempts to find the brain traces in
Indian philosophy?

Thank you,

Plamen
