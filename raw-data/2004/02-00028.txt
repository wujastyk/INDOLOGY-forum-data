Doesn't A.K. Coomaraswamy have a long discussion on the makara in art
(mostly sculpture) somewhere, maybe in "Yaksas"?

The 19th or 20th c. paintings of the makararasis I mentioned never look
like the makaras in the classic sculpture, as outlined by John
Huntington.  Notably the elephant features and wings are never there.  I
don't think I've seen these in the depictions of the Gajamocana, either.
  I think I've seen the classic makaras in contemporary crafts, namely
on sandalwood letter-openers.

I have collected a few of the makararasis from horoscopes out of an
interest in the depiction of mythological animals and could do digital
photos and email them to individuals who are interested.
