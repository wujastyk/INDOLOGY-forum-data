Subject: Request for Ulrich Stiehl's fonts not to be used
Message-ID: <161227075280.23782.11470726882438012635.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Ulrich Stiehl has requested that the fonts he has created, e.g., Sanskrit
2003, Palladio fonts etc., should not be used by any members of the
INDOLOGY list.

I have also removed references to his website from the INDOLOGY website.

Please comply with Ulrich's wishes.

Best,
Dominik
