Dear Domin-k - always so good to hear from you but that news is not good.

I am packing books - you will be familiar with it - round the clock and
fortunately with the help of a friend. Making rough list so that I know
what box #76 (got so far) contains. This Monday all will be picked up and
containered, then set out one week later with a few bags not to weigh more
than X with the final essentials...

best and see you soon somewhere - Frits
