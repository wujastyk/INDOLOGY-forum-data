At least in the West there are many representations, from the Greeks on
down,  of serpents or serpent-like creatures with crests somewhat like
those of a bird (e.g. a chicken or peacock). E.g. the basilisk.  I don't
recall any in India but that doesn't mean there aren't any. I wonder if
there could be some connection with the chicken-named snake.

Where the crest comes from  in these imagined creatures is another most
interesting question.
