Subject: Posting of book announcements (from the INDOLOGY guidelines)
Message-ID: <161227075342.23782.3412410976178720269.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dean Anderson asked whether INDOLOGY accepts publication announcements.

The short answer is: yes.

The long answer is in the INDOLOGY guidelines, accessible at
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html, "LISTSERV: membership &
rules" in the left hand menu:

"6. Encouraged forms of communication: Members may start discussions,
ask or answer questions, post announcements of publications, meetings,
conferences or other forms of events characteristic of academia. Job
announcements are equally welcome. Announcement of book publications as
well as of new journal issues on the part of their authors or editors is
welcome. Book catalogues may be linked to the list web-page upon
request, but should not be posted directly to the list.

7. Discouraged forms of communications: List members are discouraged
from posting messages that are not part of a discourse on indology. In
particular, commercial or advertising messages are strongly deprecated,
and may lead to suspension. (On the other hand, authors are positively
encouraged to post news of their recent academic publications.)"

Best regards,

Birgit Kellner
