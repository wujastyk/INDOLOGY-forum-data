Would somebody please give me the URL for Science article again because I
could not access it from the original post, for some unknown reason.
Thanks

Wow, I just read the article. Possehl actually SAID that???
("I don't think his ideas are interesting or viable, and I'm surprised they
have raised interest").
I am apalled. I disagree with Steve, as everyone will have noticed by now,
but his ideas are clearly extremely interesting and not to be taken lightly.

All the best,
Signe
