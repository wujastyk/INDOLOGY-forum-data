Artur,

Do you or the PGS have access to the current Survey of India maps?  I
believe nowadays they are pretty likely to have diacritics.  The system
goes back to British times. I can't seem to quickly find an account of
what the romanization system is called or what it is.   It was named
after one of the colonial Surveyors General.

The older US Army maps of India, still for sale until fairly recently,
were copies of British era maps.

Is your goal a map with names in Hindi Devanagari, or with a good
transliteration of the local names?

If a romanization, using the SOI romanizations, which are official, has
much to recommend it.  However, looking at the catalog records for some
SOI publications, I suspect that there is a convention of not bothering
to put a macron over final vowels, since it is usual they are long.
Look at our catalog <catalog.loc.gov> and search for the title District
Maps of Assam, India (LCCN 98687088) and observe at the end of the
Incomplete Contents note "Tinsukia."  So maybe you do need the
Devanagari maps.

Have you checked any of them in the index to the Schwartzberg atlas?

The GeoNet Names Server <http://gnswww.nima.mil/geonames/GNS/index.jsp>
 has some of your places, judging from a few quick sample searches.  It
also supposedly allows the use of Unicode and displays special
characters for diacritics after you download the fonts.  One can also
download separately the names file for each country.  NB it has a
warning about the presence of errors in the Pakistan and Afghanistan
files.  I believe a few of your names are in Pakistan.

Hope this helps.

Allen
