Subject: a MBh reference
Message-ID: <161227074731.23782.9027461902974780950.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Sexual Life in Ancient India p. 199 in the note Meyer refers to K,
vol. 1 p. 212 line 1 as saying "The mother is more venerable than the
father because she has carried the child, and had to suffer pain."

Where might I find this reference in the critical edition? Since,
according to my understanding, the Crit Ed is basically a northern
text, the southern readings of what Meyer called the Kambakonam
version should be in the apparatus, but without chapter and verse
number I don't have a good idea where to look...


Any hints would be much appreciated!  JAS
