Dear Bill,
 
I met you briefly at the AAR a couple of years ago (I am a friend of Amir Mohammadi, and Ellen Marshall, and I wrote my DSS on Abhinavagupta's notion of "vimarsha" in the _Tantraaloka_ with David White at Virginia).  I am taking a mini-sabbatical next fall to work on Abhinavagupta (hoping to finish a book on "vimarsha" and/or work on my _Tantraaloka_ translations and get them published (I have translated substantial amounts from chapters 3, 4, 29, and 35).  
 
I am wondering if Muktabodha offers any other kinds of grants that I might be eligible for as a pre-tenured Ph.D.  
 
Thank you for whatever you are able to tell me.
 
All the Best,
 
Kerry
