 Dear Martin Fosse,

I remember a couple of (not recent though) articles by L?ders. One is in his
Philologica Indica, the other was in another Festschrift published by
Mouton. I have forgotten precisely for whom, but I think it might have been
for Kuiper.

Best wishes

Dear members of the list,

I am looking for recent articles/studies on RzyazRGga/EkazRGga (the
unicorn)
in Sanskrit literature. Any references would be most welcome.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
