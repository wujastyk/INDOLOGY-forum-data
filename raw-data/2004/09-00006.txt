Since there are programs which troll the net harvesting addresses,
and since Indology is archived, might I suggest that when email
contact addresses are requested, they either be sent directly to the
person requesting the information, or posted in a way that such
programs cannot (yet) understand, e.g., silk AT humnet.ucla.edu?

respectfully, J Silk

(I do realize that this will not at all solve the problem, but it
seems an easy enough step to take.)
