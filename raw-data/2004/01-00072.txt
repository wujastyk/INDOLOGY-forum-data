         Subject: Versioning Machine 2.0 release

Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is delighted to
announce the 2.0 release of the Versioning Machine
http://www.mith2.umd.edu/products/ver-mach/

The Versioning Machine is software tool designed by a team of programmers,
designers, and literary scholars for displaying and comparing multiple
versions of texts. The display environment seeks not only to provide for
features traditionally found in codex-based critical editions, such as
annotation and introductory material, but to take advantage of opportunities
of electronic publishing, such as providing a frame to compare diplomatic
versions of witnesses side by side, allowing for manipulatable images of the
witness to be viewed alongside the diplomatic edition, and providing users
with an enhanced typology of notes.

VM 2.0 has significant improvements over the previous release. Previously it
was only possible to encode texts according to TEI's parallel segmentation
method. It is now possible to encode each witness as a separate document
instance. However, not all of the VM's features work using this method.

VM 2.0 also has enhanced image display features. Previously it was only
possible to view one image at a time. The Image applet now allows users to
view all the images in a witness set together. In addition, all VM features
now work in Netscape 7.0 for PC. And lastly, we have provided users with a
VM Installer based on lzPack to make the installation process easier.

We welcome your comments and feedback on this product
