ANNOUNCEMENT OF TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT POSITION IN
SOUTH ASIAN LITERARY AND/OR CULTURAL STUDIES
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
FOR WINTER TERM, JANUARY 1 - APRIL 30, 2005

Applications are invited from scholars of all ranks, from advanced graduate students to full professors, for a one term position to teach South Asian Literary and/or Cultural Studies in order to replace a colleague temporarily on leave. Two courses are to be taught, using material written
in or translated into English. The first should be a broad, introductory level course to undergraduates with little or no preparation in Asian Studies; the second should be an upper-level undergraduate course with an engaging thematic focus (that may coordinate with the candidate's research interests.) The ideal candidate does research involving at least one contemporary South Asian language. The Ph.D. is preferred, but a Ph.D. candidate who has made significant progress towards completion of the dissertation would also be considered. Salary will be commensurate with experience. Send cover letter, CV, proposed course descriptions and three letters of reference to:
