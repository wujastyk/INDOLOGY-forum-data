Adobe InDesign is capable of producing high quality multilingual
critical editions, and is unicode compliant. However, it is not yet
compatible with OpenType features in the Indic ranges. One can get
around this problem because it will access any of the conjunct glyphs in
a font - they can be entered manually as dedicated units. Thus it can
satisfy printed requirements, but fails on the level of document exchange.

Of course, InDesign is not Open Source it is very much proprietary. It
will work on Mac and PC systems, but not to my knowledge on Unix without
emulation software.
