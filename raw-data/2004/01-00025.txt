 From this too short excerpt, it seems to me that the book is
first-rate.  It appears to be a book that treats India, its history
and culture, with respect, sympathy and dignity -- there is not a
trace of condescension.  And it covers subjects that are extremely
important for understanding modern India and its development.   G.
