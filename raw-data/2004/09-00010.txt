I did not have to pay anything for Adaware, (maybe I got the wrong outfit
when I typed Adaware into google--my icon clearly says Adaware, not
Noadware, so maybe somebody has intruded on the ware I started with--this
happens a lot),
nor did a friend who got it. There is something fishy here. Using what I
have has done nothing negative to my winXP system. I had Spybot Search &
Destroy before, but Adaware has seemed to be more effective.

I will ask my computer geek friend to read your comment on Noadware--and he
will find out what's going on.  Whatever I learn from him, if I've been
hornswoggled, I will post to the list with an apology.

It begins to look even to little old me that Noadware has captured a lot of
people who want to connect with Adaware.
Please stay tuned..........
Joanna
