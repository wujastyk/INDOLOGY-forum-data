In detailing the characteristics of the seven planets, Sanskrit
astrological texts typically assign an Ayurvedic constitution (prak.rti) to
each, although disagreeing among themselves on the precise scheme. I am
curious to know whether classical works on Ayurveda also link the various
do.sa combinations with the planets. Does anyone know?

Thanks in advance,
