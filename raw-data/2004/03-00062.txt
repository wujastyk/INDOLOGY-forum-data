Dear Mr. Buescher,

     I can't point you to any secondary literature on this phenomenon, but it 
is quite common and well-known within the tradition.  The principle that allows 
terms to construe backwards and forwards at the same time is generally referred 
to as the "si.mha-avalokana-nyaya"-- "the rule of the lion's glance".  Lions 
are said, either when pursuing prey or fleeing a hunter (I've seen it explained 
both ways), to periodically leap into the air and cast a quick glance backwards 
to see what's behind them, and this provides an analogy for the grammatical 
phenomenon.  There are brief entries on it in Apte, Monier-Williams, and 
MacDonell, but none cites any passages.  MW, in his typically frustrating 
manner, says that it's found in commentaries on Mahabharata, 'Saankhaayana 
Braahma.na, and Taittiriya Prati'saakhya, but declines to cite passages.  A 
couple of references are given in Miimaa.msaako.sa.  You might also want to 
look at Abhyankar's _Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar_.  Hope this is helpful to 
you. 

Yours, 
     Larry McCrea
