I may perhaps suggest the following edition and translation of the YS (with 
the commentary of Vyaasa) :
H. Ara.nya (ed.), Yoga philosophy of Pata?jali : containing his yoga 
aphorisms with commentary of Vyaasa in original Sanskrit, and annotations 
thereon with copious hints on the practice of yoga, rendered into English 
by P.N. Mukerji, Calcutta : University of Calcutta, 1963 (19772, 19813).
