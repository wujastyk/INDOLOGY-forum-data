What is the current wisdom regarding unicode devanagari fonts
and methods of input? For one who wants something easy to install
and to use, that produces an attractive result when printed
with a reasonably high quality printer, what is most recommended?

Is there, by the way, a keyboard compatible with the devanagari
that is included in the Titus font set?
