Dear list members,

The dazAvatAra scheme certainly originated much earlier than kSemendra's date, although of course epico-puranic occurrences may not be *datable* in strict terms. Apart from literary texts, however, a Pallava inscription dated in the late VII cent. contains a list identical to the canonic one except for replacing kRSNa with [bala]rAma. A lists of ten occurring in the vulgate text of Mbh XII, 339, 103-4 (rejected from the CE) enumerates haMsa, kUrma, matsya, varAha, narasiMha, vAmana, rAma [bhArgava], rAma dAzarathi, sAtvata and kalki (i.e., leaving out the buddha as 9th and anteponing haMsa). Harivamza I, 31 (CE) enumerates (though not in compact form) ten prAdurbhAvas, somewhat different from the later canonic list: puSkara, varAha, narasiMha, vAmana, dattAtreya, rAma jAmadagnya, rAma dAzarathi, kRSNa, vyAsa and kalki. Another list of ten occurring in the vAyu, brahmANDa and matsya (and ascribed by Kirfel to the "core purANa") diverges even more: vainya [= pRthu], narasiMha, vAmana, dattAtreya, mAndhAtR, the two rAmas, vedavyAsa, kRSNa and kalki. The classical dazavatAra list first occurs in purANas usually regarded as later, such as the padma (uttarakhaNDa), agni, varAha and narasiMha. One may conclude from the above that although the general conception of ten "outstanding" descents (out of myriads: prAdurbhAvasahasrAni samAtItAni anekazaH / bhUyaz caiva bhaviSyanti yeSAM saMkhyA na vidyate) appears to be quite ancient, no common agreement concerning its composition was reached until at least the VII/VIII cent. AD.

I am indeed thankful to John Huntington for his offer to put on display some iconographical evidence.

With best wishes,
