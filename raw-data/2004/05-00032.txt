Dear friends

The prazasti of PUrNabhadra's PaJcatantra gives the date of completion of
the text as

zarabANataraNivarSe ravikaravadi phAlgune tRtIyAyAm .

jIrNoddhAra ivAsau pratiSThito 'dhiSThito vibudhaiH .

For the meaning of this, Hertel cites Bhandarkar: '3rd tithi of the dark
half of PhAlguna of the year 1255', which corresponds to 17 January 1199 CE.

Could one of you good folk help me to analyse this piece of text word by
word?

With thanks in advance

McComas
