I suspect that the sutta according to which men, too,
bind women in eight ways is a later addition by the
Pali recension of the old canon. There is no
corresponding sUtra in the Chinese ekottarAgama (T
125) p. 765c, where another recension of the sUtra on
women binding men is found. Moreover, the second
yogAcArabhUmi passage mentioned by me in an earlier
message (zi 101a4ff. in the Peking [or "Qianlong"]
edition seems only to presuppose that women bind men
in eight ways and not vice versa.

I see no cogent reason why we have to adopt an
interpretation of a canonical term simply because it
is put forward in the commentaries of the Theravaada
tradition. Moreover, I am, in view of the incidents
narrated earlier in the Raamaaya.na, quite convinced
that vanabhanga has an entirely
different meaning (something like "destruction of the
forest") there, but maybe I am too hasty in this
regard (I have not studied the passage in any detail).

I agree that the Sanskritization
vra.na can be based on an old tradition of
interpretation. And suddenly I am not
too sure anymore that Pali vana- reflects the original
wording. Yet another problem to think about ..
