Although I'm using TeX, Devanagari for TeX and EDMAC the same issue
can arise. The following code (pre preprocessing) may indicate the
solution:

%%%%%%%%%% base Sanskrit text (Devanaagarii) %%%%%%%%%%

%%%_ + 02:34 base Sanskrit text (Devanaagarii)

% checked:

%%%_ - AB
\VBD
%%%_ : t
\text{$k.rtaak.rtaapariik.so.aya.m$}
%%%_ > l
\lemma{$k.rtaak.rtaa@$}
%%%_ > n
\FD{\MI\ \VP\ \FV\ {\FDN $k.rtaak.rta@$} \LT}/
%%%_ : t
\text{$m.rtyurvi"srambhaghaataka.h$}
%%%_ > l
\lemma{$@vi"srambha@$}
%%%_ > n
\FD{\MI\ \VP\ \FV\ {\FDN $visrambha@$} \LO\ \LT}/
%%%_ : b
$|$

%%%_ - CD
\VMD
%%%_ : b
$svasthaasvasthairavi"svaasya aakasmikamahaa"sani.h || 34$

N.B. 02:34AB has been broken in two and each half placed within its
own \text{}, in your case \Nag{}. Each lemma only refers to part of
the text in each \text{} construct. The `@' = `abbreviation'.

In your case you may be able to do something such as:

\stanza

\edtext{\Nag{tasm?dyato}}{\lemma{?tmabhed?t}{\Bfootnote{PV(S), PV(M),
PVin; ?tmabhedo PV(Pr); Tosaki stellt fest, dass ?tmabhedo metri causa
nicht m?glich ist.}}} \edtext{\Nag{'sy?tmabhed?dasy?dhigatirityayam
|}}{\lemma{adhigatir}{\Bfootnote{PV(S), PV(M), PVin; avagatir
PV(Pr)}}} &

\Nag{kriy?y?? karmaniyama? siddh? s? tatpras?dhan? ||} \&


Another option may be to combine both notes into one, i.e:

\stanza

\edtext{\Nag{tasm?dyato'sy?tmabhed?dasy?dhigatirityayam
|}}{\lemma{@?tmabhed?dasy?dhigatir@}{\Bfootnote{?tmabhed?t PV(S),
PV(M), PVin; ?tmabhedo PV(Pr); Tosaki stellt fest, dass ?tmabhedo
metri causa nicht m?glich ist.\ | adhigatir PV(S), PV(M), PVin;
avagatir PV(Pr)}}} &

\Nag{kriy?y?? karmaniyama? siddh? s? tatpras?dhan? ||} \&

Not sure what you might use for `abbreviation' in LaTeX, perhaps
superscript \circ ?


Best,

 Richard
