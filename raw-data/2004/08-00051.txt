Dearest Profesors:
Namaste!!! Let me suggest to all of those that are interested in studying the history, literature and theology of vaisnavas schools , so that they can acquire strange literary pieces of such tradition (with sanskrit and English), to request a catalog free, writting to Krsna Intitute . Mail Order Dep. 1617 N.W.. 173 Terrace, Alachua Florida. USA or phone 904-418-0595. At the same time, I am looking for information on the astronomical treaty called Kamanikya: author, appearance date, manuscripts, studies of textual critic, etc. In the same way, I request information on the Yoga-sastra text.
Thanks very much, with my best regards.
Prf. Horacio Francisco Arganis Ju?rez.
