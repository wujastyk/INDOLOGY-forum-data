Subject: CA article on Ayodhya
Message-ID: <161227074330.23782.832396914725241395.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The most recent issue of Current Anthropology contains an article by Shereen
Ratnagar that will be of interest to many Indologists.

I was able to download the article from

<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CA/journal/contents/v45n2.html>

but this may be possible only if your university subscribes to CA
electronically.
