Subject: stock phrase about women?
Message-ID: <161227074013.23782.1324277419301879027.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Has anyone seen (other than in the story of Utpalavarna in the
Mulasarvastivada Vinaya) a phrase, purported to be canonical ("The
Blessed One said:"):

Women bind men in eight ways: by dance, song, music, laughter,
crying, appearance, touch [and here's the troublesome one] questions
(?).

The last item in Tibetan (all we have here) is rma 'byed pa, which
might mean to ask a question, but more commonly, to wound.

Any references much appreciated (and  apologies for cross-listing to
H-Buddhism and Indology)--JAS
