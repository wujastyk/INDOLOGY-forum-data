Dear  Colleagues,

Does anyone have an address (e-mail or postal) for either the Sukrtindra
Oriental Research Institute (located in Thammanam, Kochi -- that is all I
can find) or for Dr Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma (at Aligarh some years ago)?
The point is that we want to get hold of a recent article by him ("The Mango
Motif in Sanskrit Poetry") in the journal of the institute.  I have tried
searching library catalogues (via both COPAC and the Karlsruher Virtuelle
Katalog) for the journal without result.

Yours

John Brockington
