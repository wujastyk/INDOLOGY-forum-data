Hello, Dom
[...]

Could you do me a favour?  Post the following question on the
Indology list for me?  Thanks.

I've been using "Times Indian" fonts on a MacIntosh for years.
However, I can't manage to get them to print with the new Macintosh
Operating Systems.  I can see the screen fonts all right, but can't
get the printer to print anything.  Does anyone have a solution?  If
so, please contact

William.Sax at urz.uni-heidelberg.de

Thanks
bo
