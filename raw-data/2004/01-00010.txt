It may be too early to talk about this, but the Religion Department and the
American Studies Department at Tufts University will be applying for a tenure
track line for an Asian Americanist with a specialization in religion. At this
point there is no specification in the proposal for South Asian vs. East Asian,
and we don't even know if it will be approved, but if it is, we should have
courses on the Asian diaspora in about two years.
Hope this helps.
