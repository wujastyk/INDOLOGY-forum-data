Dear Dr. Lielukhine,

I am aware that the translation by Kangle is the one to go by under
normal circumstance. However, I am trying to devise a content analysis
project for demonstration purposes, and in this context, any old
translation will do as long as it is in electronic format. 

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
