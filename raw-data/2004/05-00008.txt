Dear Colleagues,

I should like to draw the attention of those of you, who possibly intend to participate in the German Oriental Conference (20-24 September 2004) in Halle (Germany), to the dead-line for registration, which has been set for May, 31. 

For more information, please see
www.dot2004.de

For tracing registration guidelines and contacting the accomodation services in the English language, please click on the Union Jack (apologies, Americans!) there on the right-hand side.

Papers and Indological panels registered so far can be checked under
"Programm" / "Sektionen" / "Indologie und Suedasienkunde" / "Einzelreferate" and "Panels".

See, however, also the "Oriental Manuscripts" section under the header of "Faecheruebergreifende Panels".

Conference languages are supposed to be German or English.


Best,

Walter Slaje
