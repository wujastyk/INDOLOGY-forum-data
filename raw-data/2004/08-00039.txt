Dear Peter,

Would it be possible to send me a copy of an article from the Festschrift? I
have look everywhere here in Denmark for a copy of it, but cannot find it.

The articles is by J. Scheftelowitz, "Varahamihira's Brhat-Samhita. v. 58
und das Bhavisyapurana," pp. 51-55.

If there is a Kleine Scriften  to Scheftelowitz, it might be in there as
well. But I don't know of such a work.

Here is my address:

Kenneth Zysk

Many thanks,

Ken Zysk

I'd rather guess this volume is meant:

        Festschrift Moriz Winternitz : 1863 ... 1933 / herausgegeben von
        Otto Stein und Wilhelm Gampert. - Leipzig : Harrassowitz, 1933.  -
        xiv, 357 p.

Hope it helps
Peter Wyzlic
