You may find some useful discussion on this matter in my article "Pandit and Professor: Transformations in the 19th Century Maharashtra" published in the Volume: The Pandit, Traditional Scholarship in India, edited by Axel Michaels, Manohar, Delhi, 2001, pp. 119-164; and in my forthcoming article "Aryan Origins: Arguments from the 19th Century Maharashtra" appearing in the Aryan Debate volume edited by Ed Bryant and Laurie Patton.  Also useful is the article by Mahadev L Apte, "Lokahitavadi and V.K. Chiplunkar: Spokesmen of Change in Nineteenth Century Maharashtra," in Modern Asian Studies, Volume 7, No. 2, 1973, pp. 193-208.  Such demands for change were perhaps more vocal in Maharashtra, and the Pune Sanskritists were perhaps just a subset of the Marathi intellectuals involved in the larger process of change.

A colleague has asked for help in finding secondary sources that deal with
the Pune Sanskritists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century
and how their scholarship, ideology, and overall orientation was viewed as
different from what was found in other places such as Benares or Calcutta.

The Pune Sanskritists have, for example, been referred to as "scientific"
or as "instrumental rationalists."  Where might one read about such
characterizations?

Thanks,
Gary Tubb.
