I would be very interested in this as well, so I hope any responses will be
made on-list. The respective chapters of Arvind Sharma's 'The Hindu Gita',
which I personally enjoyed very much, are probably both too long and too
technical for your purposes.

Although not exactly what you asked for, Patricia Mumme has an excellent
essay (this would probably be about the right length, but it is not
primarily about Sankara and Ramanuja, although they form the background)
called 'Haunted by Sankara's Ghost' in 'Texts in Context' (Timm, 1991),
illustrating the intimate connection between metaphysical models and
interpretative strategies.
