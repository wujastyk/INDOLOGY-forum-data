Ravi,

I did not mean to ignore the tragedy of lost human life.  The fishermen living on the shore near the Adyar Library took me out in their boats one day many years ago. I read that hundreds of them were at sea during the tsunami and are lost.  They were beautiful people and I greatly mourn the loss.  I intend to contribute to the reconstruction effort and I am sure many others here will also want to do so.
