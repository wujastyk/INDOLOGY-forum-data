Dear Dr Slaje,

Thinking about this conference, I need information on accommodations. Will
the conference arrange these for paper presenters, or are we on our own? I
am seeking ordinary accommodations, not fancy.
Also, what is the recommended airport for arrival from overseas (USA), and
how to get to Halle from there?

Please advise and thanks.
Joanna Kirkpatrick

Dear Colleagues,

I should like to draw the attention of those of you, who possibly intend to
participate in the German Oriental Conference (20-24 September 2004) in
Halle (Germany), to the dead-line for registration, which has been set for
May, 31.

For more information, please see
www.dot2004.de

For tracing registration guidelines and contacting the accomodation services
in the English language, please click on the Union Jack (apologies,
Americans!) there on the right-hand side.

Papers and Indological panels registered so far can be checked under
"Programm" / "Sektionen" / "Indologie und Suedasienkunde" / "Einzelreferate"
and "Panels".

See, however, also the "Oriental Manuscripts" section under the header of
"Faecheruebergreifende Panels".

Conference languages are supposed to be German or English.


Best,

Walter Slaje
