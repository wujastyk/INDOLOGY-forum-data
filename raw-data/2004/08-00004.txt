Ken,

Or is it a Festschrift?

Also, does anyone know if Friderike Maria Burger Winternitz Zweig,
1882-1971, whom I came across in pursuing Ken's query, is any kin to
unser Winternitz?  Mrs. Zweig was Stephan Zweig's daughter and an author
in her own right.

Hi Ken,
I would be surprised if it is not the citation I give below.
Best,  David Magier
