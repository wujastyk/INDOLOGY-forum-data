Dear friends and colleagues,



We are excited to announce that the 2023 call for proposals for our AAR
Seminar on Language, Poiesis, and Buddhist Experiments with the Possible is
now open.



You can find our seminar CFP here
<https://papers.aarweb.org/pu/language-poiesis-and-buddhist-experiments-possible-seminar>.
All proposals must be submitted through PAPERS <https://papers.aarweb.org/>.
The deadline is *Wednesday, March 1, 2023, 5:00 PM Eastern Standard
Time. *Detailed
instructions are provided in the full call
<https://papers.aarweb.org/sites/default/files/general/2023_Call_for_Papers.pdf>;
please consult it carefully for information about procedures (and please
note the limits on the number of appearances ? one can only appear on the
program two times in any capacity). For your convenience, we are also
pasting the call below.



Best wishes,

Nancy Lin and Roy Tzohar (co-chairs)



*Seminar description*

Our seminar investigates, over the course of five years, the poiesis of
language?its capacity to create, bring into existence, and shape worlds,
selves, and our shared sense of reality. To better grasp this potential of
language, we approach Buddhist textual engagement foremost in terms of
experiments with the possibilities of language (rather than under given
textual categories, genre distinctions, tropes, etc.) and examine how these
have contributed to making the form and content of Buddhism itself, along
with adjacent traditions. In doing so we emphasize that both content and
modes of expression should be examined as inextricably involved in the
process by which Buddhism took on its distinctive character as well as its
sense of what is possible. We approach literary forms as an environment
that enables Buddhists to find their voice, subject matter, style, and
self-representation.



*For the 2023 AAR Annual Meeting we invite proposals on the theme*:

*Practices for transforming the real: language, imagination, and scholarly
modes of engagement*

This year, we seek to generate a mutually informing dialogue between
Buddhist linguistic practices for making and transforming self and world,
and scholarly modes of engagement with those practices. What relationships
among language, imagination, and the real do Buddhist texts imply and
enable? And what techniques for making or transforming self and world do
these relationships make conceivable and practicable?

Conversely, how do scholars recognize when and how Buddhist texts are
deployed to shape the real, and how might our answers to such questions
change how we engage with Buddhist texts? As we seek to question the
scholarly assumptions we inherit and inhabit, how might Buddhist practices
involving language expand our imaginative and critical resources? How might
we develop alternative modes of interpretation so as to encounter Buddhist
texts in new ways?

*We invite proposals that aim to address these questions through leading a
close reading of a selection from a Buddhist primary text *(we include both
written and oral forms of language) *or a text from an adjacent tradition* that
offers resources for reconsidering methods and approaches to Buddhist
language.

*In your proposal*, *please identify clearly the textual selection you
propose to read (and submit an excerpt) and demonstrate its relevance to
the theme*.

*Format: *

The format for 2023 will be a close-reading workshop taking place over two
consecutive 90-minute sessions, divided by a half-hour break.

? Presenters will not give a paper; instead, they will introduce and lead a
close reading of their text that addresses the seminar questions and theme
outlined above, engaging in discussion with designated respondents and the
audience along the way. Ample time will be devoted to each text selected to
permit sustained discussion.

? Presenters will be required: 1) to precirculate their text excerpt and
any supporting materials to all formal seminar participants (steering
committee, respondents, and other presenters); 2) to post in advance via
the AAR platform both a brief introduction to their text and their textual
excerpt (in one or more languages, as germane to the text in question) and
an English translation (unless the text was composed in English), which can
be accessed by all AAR 2023 attendees; and 3) to display their text (and
translation, if applicable) via the available AV setup or handouts.

? Collaborative work is encouraged and will be given special consideration.

? We plan to designate at least two respondents for every text. *If you are
interested in responding to a workshop text, please submit a proposal
*specifying
that you are interested in a respondent role, and briefly explaining your
interest in our seminar theme and questions.

? Our seminar is committed to fostering diversity in terms of race,
ethnicity, gender, rank, institutions, etc. and these issues will be given
special consideration.


Deadline:
*All proposals should be submitted via **PAPERS*
<https://papers.aarweb.org/user>* anytime until Wednesday, March 1, 2023,
5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time when the CFP closes. *

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ranjana Unicode Proposal
Message-ID: <CAMQ+qF1sN685Lv3LZfCRdzJmfuM1ujsv7pRnKtqWie=jr981Aw@mail.gmail.com>

Forwarding on behalf of Deborah Anderson (dwanders at berkeley.edu)

The following is a link to the preliminary Ra?jan? proposal, which has just
been posted:
https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23028-ranjana.pdf
<https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23028-ranjana.pdf>

The document will be revised shortly, based on the following comments from
a review from Unicode Script Ad Hoc members:

?    At the beginning of the document, add content on the benefits of
unifying Ranjana and Lantsa, showing sources and making the case that they
are more similar than different.
?    Section 4: identify the rows with names (Ranjana / Lantsa).
?    Section 4.3 (pages 12-13): the long u glyph is incorrect.
?     Use Myanmar as the model for naming characters, instead of Tibetan or
Zanabazar Square. Rename FINAL RA and FINAL YA to be MEDIAL RA and MEDIAL YA
?     Add examples from manuscripts.
?     Show most frequent conjuncts, comparing Ranjana vs. Lantsa.

Please feel free to circulate this.  Comments on the proposal should be
sent to the author Anshuman Pandey at pandey at umich.edu, cc'ing me. Note;
Anshuman Pandey is looking for a better font, in case you are aware of one.

With best wishes,
Debbie

*Abstract:*
> Early Indian contributions to science that are not well known to the
> layperson include a deep theory of mind, P??ini?s astonishing Sanskrit
> grammar, binary numbers of Pi?gala, music theory, combinatorics, algebra,
> earliest astronomy, and the physics of Ka??da with its laws of motion. Of
> these, Ka??da is the least known. He may not have presented his ideas as
> mathematical equations, but he attempted something that no physicist to
> date has dared to do: he advanced a system that includes space, time,
> matter, as well as observers. He also postulated four types of atoms, two
> with mass (that turn out to be like proton and electron) and two with
> little mass (like the modern neutrino and photon), and the idea of
> invariance. A thousand or more years after Ka??da, ?ryabha?a postulated
> that earth rotated and advanced the basic idea of relativity of motion.
> This webinar presents an overview of such scientific discoveries in ancient
> India.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Chapter 4 of Yuddha khanda of Rudra Samhita of Siva
 Purana
References: <B73842DC-AB28-412B-82AD-DA42A07E5FB5.ref@aol.com>
Message-ID: <B73842DC-AB28-412B-82AD-DA42A07E5FB5@aol.com>

Dear Indologists,

 

I have a few questions about Chapter 4 of Yuddha Khanda of Rudra Samhita of Siva Purana beginning on p. 820 of the link dealing with the story of Tripurantaka. Although, the translator says in the footnote on p. 820 that the person created by Vishnu (from himself) preached Jina Dharma to misguide the Asuras, is the Arihat really supposed to be Jain or Buddhist preacher? Is there a critical edition of the text? How old is this part of the text? 

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan

Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_MZxOtUsu_qXay=nwTTi4WY2yCRObn5nNZq0NbCKJj3A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I'm looking at the ?ivasa?kalpam in the Vajasaneyi-sa?hit?.  I'm using
Weber's edition of  Vajasaneyi-sa?hit? in the m?dhyandina and the
k?nva-??kh? with the commentary of Mahidhara, Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series
no. 103.

A link to the relevant pages on Wetransfer is: https://we.tl/t-M5nXc5jRxx

1. Most importantly can someone confirm (or not)  that the  verses 34-1
thru 34-6 circled in red are of the  m?dhyandina- ??kh? (not of the
k?nva-??kh?).

2. In the second line of verse 3 there appears to be an avagraha
(highlighted in yellow) .  I'm not clear why its there. Bloomfield's
concordance doesn't have it.  Any explanation for the avagraha would be
appreciated. Or is it not an avagraha?

3. In verse 5 there are a couple of occurances of what I think is the
Vajasaneyi
anun?sika but there is also an occurance of candrabindu (highlighted in
yellow). In Vajasaneyi texts is the candrabindu the sign for the so-called
gumkara.  If so, then what pronounciation does the  Vajasaneyi
anun?sika sign (looks almost like a 6 with a dot) represent. There are two
occurances in verse 5.

4) Why the dash (highlighted in yellow) in verse 6.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Harry Spier

INDIAN RELIGIONS AND THE CONCEPT OF GOD
An Online Workshop
Feb 13, 9:00-10:30am CET and 3:00-4:30pm CET.
Feb 14, 3:00-4:30pm CET
https://www.logicandreligion.com/ <https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logicandreligion.com%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cphilosop%40lists.louisiana.edu%7C9a3ae199a3374eab21e108db09178fa1%7C13b3b0cecd7549a4bfea0a03b01ff1ab%7C1%7C0%7C638113769045995698%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=hm5Xp2uIKhYJsHspMbVwn%2BRbxbJY9h1biosnrlad5F4%3D&reserved=0>vaishnava-concept-of-god
 

The purpose of the online workshop INDIAN RELIGIONS AND THE CONCEPT OF GOD is to explore Indian concepts of God from a global philosophical perspective. Accepting that there are different conceptions of divinity among the Indian religious and philosophical traditions, we might pose the following questions: How can these concepts of God be philosophically characterized?  Are the Indian traditions? concepts of God really monotheistic in the Western sense of the term? Or are they closer to panentheism, henotheism or polytheism? What divine properties do the traditions ascribe to their respective divinity? What is their relationship with Western philosophical accounts of God? Each speaker in the workshop will explore a concept of God in one of the main Indian traditions or texts.

The workshop will be held on Zoom. There will be no fee for participation. Registration however will be required (via www.logicandreligion.com/vaishnava-concept-of-god <https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.logicandreligion.com%2Fvaishnava-concept-of-god&data=05%7C01%7Cphilosop%40lists.louisiana.edu%7C9a3ae199a3374eab21e108db09178fa1%7C13b3b0cecd7549a4bfea0a03b01ff1ab%7C1%7C0%7C638113769045995698%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=JLXYlMEOmHou8AaWxaWfVbsLsRfaoCcgjE70nBKvo%2Fo%3D&reserved=0>).

Dear colleagues,

It is our pleasure to present you with the fourth edition of MAHE Manipal International Summer School - 'Reinterpreting India: Perspectives from Literature, Culture and Morality'.

Foreign undergraduates, graduates, and free-willing individuals are most welcome to join our Indian students and Faculties for two weeks of intensive learning and cultural immersion this July (17th to 31st) 2023.

Upon completion of the course, 3 credits (ECTS) are earned.

Our Department of Philosophy (DoP) has put together a rich offer.

Within our program, students will be introduced to Indian knowledge systems in philosophy and aesthetics. They will debate on major issues within the tradition, such as God and the self. They will be exposed to contemporary discussions within Indology and to traditional educational methods. They will also be initiated to Sanskrit and regional languages (Kannada and Tulu).

Please inform your students about this precious hands-on learning opportunity.

I?d be interested in seeing the article on Buddha in the Hindu pantheon

Dear colleagues,

I know of three editions of this text, Bohlen's (1933), Solf (1886,
Kashmiri recension) and Tadpatrikar (critical ed., 1966). Bohlen's is
edited with a Ga?apa(ti)-vr?tti. Tadpatrikar quotes from two commentaries
he doen't specify (one is certainly Ga?apa's, although with different
readings sometimes, as compared with Bohlen's text.). Does anyone
known/happen to have editions of this text with other commentaries?

B.w.
Adriano

In fact, it is a place where you can get a major part of contemporary indological books.

Thank you to Michael Witzel who pointed me to his edition and translation
of The Katha Aranyaka 2.100 and was kind enough to translate the passage
into english.

And thank you to Corinna Wessels-Mevissen who pointed me  to Stella
Kramrisch's The Presence of Shiva.  I was pleasantly surprised to see most
(all?) of Stella Kramrisch's books available for e-loan on archive.org.

The publishing industry today is where the music industry was about two or
three decades ago.  Libgen is rather like the original Napster
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster>.  Libgen makes many books
downloadable without any regard for copyright rights or the law generally.
Publishing companies from time to time try to shut down Libgen and its
predecessors like Library.Nu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library.nu>.
In the past few months, for example, such a publishers' consortium has
succeeded in shutting down many of the mirrors of Libgen (like
https://b-ok.cc/).  But it's whack-a-mole.  What publishers are not
responding to is the need for a new model of digital book distribution,
analogous to streamed music.  We should be able to pay about $10 per month
and read whatever we want.  Amazon is the one large company I know that has
tried this, with its Kindle Unlimited
<https://www.amazon.ca/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?ref_=nav_em__k_ku_0_2_4_8>
program.  That way, everyone gets paid, and everyone can read without fear
of prosecution.

Where does that leave us?  Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a
serious breach of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!).  On the
other hand, it is often irresistibly convenient.  And for readers without
access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the
library system.  And time matters.
There are so many books on Libgen published by companies like Brill and
Routledge that it's hard to believe they are not quietly aware of it, and
accepting it as an alternative distribution method, although of course they
would officially deny it.  So many of the PDFs are clearly publishers'
originals, not scans, suggesting at the very least that there is
uncontrolled leakage of content directly from the publishers.

We live in interesting times.  Libgen is more than merely "shadowy."  To
download from Libgen is in most cases a crime against copyright law (has
the author been dead for more than 60 years).  Just as it used to be with
Napster and early Spotify.  At the same time, the obscene profits of giant
publishing corporations like Pearson, Bertelsmann, Elsevier and Springer
and Scholastic, coupled with their unwillingness to adapt to the world of
digital distribution, make it almost inevitable that Libgen exists.

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection
impossible, and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models from future
publishers.

Best wishes,
Dominik

Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Publication on Logical Thought in India
In-Reply-To: <mailman.3.1676289601.19136.indology@list.indology.info>
References: <mailman.3.1676289601.19136.indology@list.indology.info>

I would like to begin by congratulating the authors for their hard work on the "Handbook of Logical Thought in India."
No doubt there is something in there worth the read.

Yet, perhaps to add to the discussion, for anyone actually working in India, and perhaps especially in indological fields, one wonders what logic, if any, is there behind such a price tag.

Colleagues may play the good political game of highlighting the criminality of copyrights infringement related to sites like 'lib gen,' yet without these doing research in the Global South would be an almost impossible project at the moment. Public libraries are too often outdated and private ones must carefully decide what to acquire.
I remember doing research work at JNU at a time before 'lib gen.' Most books on Indian philosophy were at least 40 years old. I do hope it changed on the bookshelves. But I know that 'lib gen' changed the game for sure.

There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.
And at the same time seeing a book on 'Indian logic' available at the illogical cost of more than a full month salary for most of my colleagues in Indian institutions.

Even a certain Netflix-like payment a month is not necessarily something our students can afford.
Should we forbid them the most convenient and obvious way to get access to international research?

Let it be my defence of pedagogical piracy in an age of corporate pirates.

I was delighted to see my book on these Websites as soon as it got out...
I hope all the others will land there too.

Cordially,

Wikipedia describes it as a 'shadow library'.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis

In fact, it is a place where you can get a major part of contemporary indological books.

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some day?

best regards,

The publishing industry today is where the music industry was about two or
three decades ago.  Libgen is rather like the original Napster
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster>.  Libgen makes many books
downloadable without any regard for copyright rights or the law generally.
Publishing companies from time to time try to shut down Libgen and its
predecessors like Library.Nu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library.nu>.
In the past few months, for example, such a publishers' consortium has
succeeded in shutting down many of the mirrors of Libgen (like
https://b-ok.cc/).  But it's whack-a-mole.  What publishers are not
responding to is the need for a new model of digital book distribution,
analogous to streamed music.  We should be able to pay about $10 per month
and read whatever we want.  Amazon is the one large company I know that has
tried this, with its Kindle Unlimited
<https://www.amazon.ca/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?ref_=nav_em__k_ku_0_2_4_8>
program.  That way, everyone gets paid, and everyone can read without fear
of prosecution.

Where does that leave us?  Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a
serious breach of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!).  On the
other hand, it is often irresistibly convenient.  And for readers without
access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the
library system.  And time matters.
There are so many books on Libgen published by companies like Brill and
Routledge that it's hard to believe they are not quietly aware of it, and
accepting it as an alternative distribution method, although of course they
would officially deny it.  So many of the PDFs are clearly publishers'
originals, not scans, suggesting at the very least that there is
uncontrolled leakage of content directly from the publishers.

We live in interesting times.  Libgen is more than merely "shadowy."  To
download from Libgen is in most cases a crime against copyright law (has
the author been dead for more than 60 years).  Just as it used to be with
Napster and early Spotify.  At the same time, the obscene profits of giant
publishing corporations like Pearson, Bertelsmann, Elsevier and Springer
and Scholastic, coupled with their unwillingness to adapt to the world of
digital distribution, make it almost inevitable that Libgen exists.

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection
impossible, and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models from future
publishers.

Best wishes,
Dominik

Matthew &c.,

It'll be curious to see the effect of the past two or three years
on prices. (The cost of paper has certainly increased.) Some
sort of comparison should be possible once figures find their
way through to the ALA:

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can
vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may
not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is
prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some
day?

Dear Richard,

The book we?ve been discussing is over 450 euros. I don?t believe that Springer?s extravagant pricing is a function of rising costs of paper.

main non, mes amis:

eBook ?459.03
Hardcover book ?599.49

So there is no paper involved for ?460, and heaven forbid if you want it in
paper.

By the way, the extremely odd pricing suggests either that this is
converted from another currency or that the pricing is calculated by some
machine with zero human input; a price with 3 cents is not proposed by a
human.

Right. Springer?s price gouging is well known to be based on a business model that depends on insanely high prices for institutional subscriptions to scientific journals that are primarily, or in many cases exclusively, distributed electronically. Springer thrives in a post-paper world.

Thank you to Michael Witzel who pointed me to his edition and translation of The Katha Aranyaka 2.100 and was kind enough to translate the passage into english.

And thank you to Corinna Wessels-Mevissen who pointed me  to Stella Kramrisch's The Presence of Shiva.

Dear Mr. Bouthillette,

You write
There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.

But in fact, no party to the discussion wrote anything that would warrant this comment.

It was agreed by all, I think, that Springer?s outrageous pricing is the problem. And there was no suggestion that the authors benefit from this, so it is not quite clear what you?re saying here.

cordially ,
Matthew Kapstein

Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Publication on Logical Thought in India

I would like to begin by congratulating the authors for their hard work on the "Handbook of Logical Thought in India."
No doubt there is something in there worth the read.

Yet, perhaps to add to the discussion, for anyone actually working in India, and perhaps especially in indological fields, one wonders what logic, if any, is there behind such a price tag.

Colleagues may play the good political game of highlighting the criminality of copyrights infringement related to sites like 'lib gen,' yet without these doing research in the Global South would be an almost impossible project at the moment. Public libraries are too often outdated and private ones must carefully decide what to acquire.
I remember doing research work at JNU at a time before 'lib gen.' Most books on Indian philosophy were at least 40 years old. I do hope it changed on the bookshelves. But I know that 'lib gen' changed the game for sure.

There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.
And at the same time seeing a book on 'Indian logic' available at the illogical cost of more than a full month salary for most of my colleagues in Indian institutions.

Even a certain Netflix-like payment a month is not necessarily something our students can afford.
Should we forbid them the most convenient and obvious way to get access to international research?

Let it be my defence of pedagogical piracy in an age of corporate pirates.

I was delighted to see my book on these Websites as soon as it got out...
I hope all the others will land there too.

Cordially,

Wikipedia describes it as a 'shadow library'.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis

In fact, it is a place where you can get a major part of contemporary indological books.

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some day?

best regards,

Kramrisch's The Presence of Shiva.  I was pleasantly surprised to see most
(all?) of Stella Kramrisch's books available for e-loan on archive.org.

I am looking for an electronic copy of the following article:

The publishing industry today is where the music industry was about two or
three decades ago.  Libgen is rather like the original Napster
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster>.  Libgen makes many books
downloadable without any regard for copyright rights or the law generally.
Publishing companies from time to time try to shut down Libgen and its
predecessors like Library.Nu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library.nu>.
In the past few months, for example, such a publishers' consortium has
succeeded in shutting down many of the mirrors of Libgen (like
https://b-ok.cc/).  But it's whack-a-mole.  What publishers are not
responding to is the need for a new model of digital book distribution,
analogous to streamed music.  We should be able to pay about $10 per month
and read whatever we want.  Amazon is the one large company I know that has
tried this, with its Kindle Unlimited
<https://www.amazon.ca/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?ref_=nav_em__k_ku_0_2_4_8>
program.  That way, everyone gets paid, and everyone can read without fear
of prosecution.

Where does that leave us?  Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a
serious breach of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!).  On the
other hand, it is often irresistibly convenient.  And for readers without
access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the
library system.  And time matters.
There are so many books on Libgen published by companies like Brill and
Routledge that it's hard to believe they are not quietly aware of it, and
accepting it as an alternative distribution method, although of course they
would officially deny it.  So many of the PDFs are clearly publishers'
originals, not scans, suggesting at the very least that there is
uncontrolled leakage of content directly from the publishers.

We live in interesting times.  Libgen is more than merely "shadowy."  To
download from Libgen is in most cases a crime against copyright law (has
the author been dead for more than 60 years).  Just as it used to be with
Napster and early Spotify.  At the same time, the obscene profits of giant
publishing corporations like Pearson, Bertelsmann, Elsevier and Springer
and Scholastic, coupled with their unwillingness to adapt to the world of
digital distribution, make it almost inevitable that Libgen exists.

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection
impossible, and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models from future
publishers.

Best wishes,
Dominik

It'll be curious to see the effect of the past two or three years
on prices. (The cost of paper has certainly increased.) Some
sort of comparison should be possible once figures find their
way through to the ALA:

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can
vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may
not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is
prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some
day?

Dear Richard,

The book we?ve been discussing is over 450 euros. I don?t believe that Springer?s extravagant pricing is a function of rising costs of paper.

main non, mes amis:

eBook ?459.03
Hardcover book ?599.49

So there is no paper involved for ?460, and heaven forbid if you want it in
paper.

By the way, the extremely odd pricing suggests either that this is
converted from another currency or that the pricing is calculated by some
machine with zero human input; a price with 3 cents is not proposed by a
human.

Right. Springer?s price gouging is well known to be based on a business model that depends on insanely high prices for institutional subscriptions to scientific journals that are primarily, or in many cases exclusively, distributed electronically. Springer thrives in a post-paper world.

Dear Mr. Kapstein,

You are right, I could have kept it shorter for the sake of clarity.

I see no reason whatsoever to even suggest not using 'lib gen.'

Raising the issue, especially in the context of the current excess from Springer (not from the authors, obviously), is (in my eyes) both faint morality and slightly obscene.

No offense intended.

Kindly,

Dear Mr. Bouthillette,

You write
There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.

But in fact, no party to the discussion wrote anything that would warrant this comment.

It was agreed by all, I think, that Springer?s outrageous pricing is the problem. And there was no suggestion that the authors benefit from this, so it is not quite clear what you?re saying here.

cordially ,
Matthew Kapstein

Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Publication on Logical Thought in India

I would like to begin by congratulating the authors for their hard work on the "Handbook of Logical Thought in India."
No doubt there is something in there worth the read.

Yet, perhaps to add to the discussion, for anyone actually working in India, and perhaps especially in indological fields, one wonders what logic, if any, is there behind such a price tag.

Colleagues may play the good political game of highlighting the criminality of copyrights infringement related to sites like 'lib gen,' yet without these doing research in the Global South would be an almost impossible project at the moment. Public libraries are too often outdated and private ones must carefully decide what to acquire.
I remember doing research work at JNU at a time before 'lib gen.' Most books on Indian philosophy were at least 40 years old. I do hope it changed on the bookshelves. But I know that 'lib gen' changed the game for sure.

There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.
And at the same time seeing a book on 'Indian logic' available at the illogical cost of more than a full month salary for most of my colleagues in Indian institutions.

Even a certain Netflix-like payment a month is not necessarily something our students can afford.
Should we forbid them the most convenient and obvious way to get access to international research?

Let it be my defence of pedagogical piracy in an age of corporate pirates.

I was delighted to see my book on these Websites as soon as it got out...
I hope all the others will land there too.

Cordially,

Wikipedia describes it as a 'shadow library'.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis

In fact, it is a place where you can get a major part of contemporary indological books.

Thank you to Michael Witzel who pointed me to his edition and translation
of The Katha Aranyaka 2.100 and was kind enough to translate the passage
into english.

And thank you to Corinna Wessels-Mevissen who pointed me  to Stella
Kramrisch's The Presence of Shiva.  I was pleasantly surprised to see most
(all?) of Stella Kramrisch's books available for e-loan on archive.org.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

The publishing industry today is where the music industry was about two or
three decades ago.  Libgen is rather like the original Napster
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster>.  Libgen makes many books
downloadable without any regard for copyright rights or the law generally.
Publishing companies from time to time try to shut down Libgen and its
predecessors like Library.Nu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library.nu>.
In the past few months, for example, such a publishers' consortium has
succeeded in shutting down many of the mirrors of Libgen (like
https://b-ok.cc/).  But it's whack-a-mole.  What publishers are not
responding to is the need for a new model of digital book distribution,
analogous to streamed music.  We should be able to pay about $10 per month
and read whatever we want.  Amazon is the one large company I know that has
tried this, with its Kindle Unlimited
<https://www.amazon.ca/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?ref_=nav_em__k_ku_0_2_4_8>
program.  That way, everyone gets paid, and everyone can read without fear
of prosecution.

Where does that leave us?  Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a
serious breach of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!).  On the
other hand, it is often irresistibly convenient.  And for readers without
access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the
library system.  And time matters.
There are so many books on Libgen published by companies like Brill and
Routledge that it's hard to believe they are not quietly aware of it, and
accepting it as an alternative distribution method, although of course they
would officially deny it.  So many of the PDFs are clearly publishers'
originals, not scans, suggesting at the very least that there is
uncontrolled leakage of content directly from the publishers.

We live in interesting times.  Libgen is more than merely "shadowy."  To
download from Libgen is in most cases a crime against copyright law (has
the author been dead for more than 60 years).  Just as it used to be with
Napster and early Spotify.  At the same time, the obscene profits of giant
publishing corporations like Pearson, Bertelsmann, Elsevier and Springer
and Scholastic, coupled with their unwillingness to adapt to the world of
digital distribution, make it almost inevitable that Libgen exists.

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection
impossible, and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models from future
publishers.

Best wishes,
Dominik

It'll be curious to see the effect of the past two or three years
on prices. (The cost of paper has certainly increased.) Some
sort of comparison should be possible once figures find their

Dear Richard,

The book we?ve been discussing is over 450 euros. I don?t believe that Springer?s extravagant pricing is a function of rising costs of paper.

main non, mes amis:

eBook ?459.03
Hardcover book ?599.49

So there is no paper involved for ?460, and heaven forbid if you want it in
paper.

By the way, the extremely odd pricing suggests either that this is
converted from another currency or that the pricing is calculated by some
machine with zero human input; a price with 3 cents is not proposed by a
human.

Right. Springer?s price gouging is well known to be based on a business model that depends on insanely high prices for institutional subscriptions to scientific journals that are primarily, or in many cases exclusively, distributed electronically. Springer thrives in a post-paper world.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] New Publication on Logical Thought in India

main non, mes amis:

eBook ?459.03
Hardcover book ?599.49

So there is no paper involved for ?460, and heaven forbid if you want it in paper.

By the way, the extremely odd pricing suggests either that this is converted from another currency or that the pricing is calculated by some machine with zero human input; a price with 3 cents is not proposed by a human.

Dear Richard,

The book we?ve been discussing is over 450 euros. I don?t believe that Springer?s extravagant pricing is a function of rising costs of paper.

Matthew &c.,

It'll be curious to see the effect of the past two or three years
on prices. (The cost of paper has certainly increased.) Some
sort of comparison should be possible once figures find their
way through to the ALA:

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some day?

best regards,

Thank you to Michael Witzel who pointed me to his edition and translation of The Katha Aranyaka 2.100 and was kind enough to translate the passage into english.

And thank you to Corinna Wessels-Mevissen who pointed me  to Stella Kramrisch's The Presence of Shiva.

Dear Mr. Kapstein,

You are right, I could have kept it shorter for the sake of clarity.

I see no reason whatsoever to even suggest not using 'lib gen.'

Raising the issue, especially in the context of the current excess from Springer (not from the authors, obviously), is (in my eyes) both faint morality and slightly obscene.

No offense intended.

Kindly,

Dear Mr. Bouthillette,

You write
There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.

But in fact, no party to the discussion wrote anything that would warrant this comment.

It was agreed by all, I think, that Springer?s outrageous pricing is the problem. And there was no suggestion that the authors benefit from this, so it is not quite clear what you?re saying here.

cordially ,
Matthew Kapstein

Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Publication on Logical Thought in India

I would like to begin by congratulating the authors for their hard work on the "Handbook of Logical Thought in India."
No doubt there is something in there worth the read.

Yet, perhaps to add to the discussion, for anyone actually working in India, and perhaps especially in indological fields, one wonders what logic, if any, is there behind such a price tag.

Colleagues may play the good political game of highlighting the criminality of copyrights infringement related to sites like 'lib gen,' yet without these doing research in the Global South would be an almost impossible project at the moment. Public libraries are too often outdated and private ones must carefully decide what to acquire.
I remember doing research work at JNU at a time before 'lib gen.' Most books on Indian philosophy were at least 40 years old. I do hope it changed on the bookshelves. But I know that 'lib gen' changed the game for sure.

There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.
And at the same time seeing a book on 'Indian logic' available at the illogical cost of more than a full month salary for most of my colleagues in Indian institutions.

Even a certain Netflix-like payment a month is not necessarily something our students can afford.
Should we forbid them the most convenient and obvious way to get access to international research?

Let it be my defence of pedagogical piracy in an age of corporate pirates.

I was delighted to see my book on these Websites as soon as it got out...
I hope all the others will land there too.

Cordially,

Wikipedia describes it as a 'shadow library'.

In fact, it is a place where you can get a major part of contemporary indological books.

Thank you to Michael Witzel who pointed me to his edition and translation

into english.

And thank you to Corinna Wessels-Mevissen who pointed me  to Stella

(all?) of Stella Kramrisch's books available for e-loan on archive.org.

The publishing industry today is where the music industry was about two or
three decades ago.  Libgen is rather like the original Napster
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster>.  Libgen makes many books
downloadable without any regard for copyright rights or the law generally.
Publishing companies from time to time try to shut down Libgen and its
predecessors like Library.Nu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library.nu>.
In the past few months, for example, such a publishers' consortium has
succeeded in shutting down many of the mirrors of Libgen (like
https://b-ok.cc/).  But it's whack-a-mole.  What publishers are not
responding to is the need for a new model of digital book distribution,
analogous to streamed music.  We should be able to pay about $10 per month
and read whatever we want.  Amazon is the one large company I know that has
tried this, with its Kindle Unlimited
<https://www.amazon.ca/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?ref_=nav_em__k_ku_0_2_4_8>
program.  That way, everyone gets paid, and everyone can read without fear
of prosecution.

Where does that leave us?  Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a
serious breach of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!).  On the
other hand, it is often irresistibly convenient.  And for readers without
access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the
library system.  And time matters.
There are so many books on Libgen published by companies like Brill and
Routledge that it's hard to believe they are not quietly aware of it, and
accepting it as an alternative distribution method, although of course they
would officially deny it.  So many of the PDFs are clearly publishers'
originals, not scans, suggesting at the very least that there is
uncontrolled leakage of content directly from the publishers.

We live in interesting times.  Libgen is more than merely "shadowy."  To
download from Libgen is in most cases a crime against copyright law (has
the author been dead for more than 60 years).  Just as it used to be with
Napster and early Spotify.  At the same time, the obscene profits of giant
publishing corporations like Pearson, Bertelsmann, Elsevier and Springer
and Scholastic, coupled with their unwillingness to adapt to the world of
digital distribution, make it almost inevitable that Libgen exists.

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection
impossible, and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models from future
publishers.

Best wishes,
Dominik

The book we?ve been discussing is over 450 euros. I don?t believe that Springer?s extravagant pricing is a function of rising costs of paper.

main non, mes amis:

eBook ?459.03
Hardcover book ?599.49

So there is no paper involved for ?460, and heaven forbid if you want it in
paper.

By the way, the extremely odd pricing suggests either that this is
converted from another currency or that the pricing is calculated by some
machine with zero human input; a price with 3 cents is not proposed by a
human.

Right. Springer?s price gouging is well known to be based on a business model that depends on insanely high prices for institutional subscriptions to scientific journals that are primarily, or in many cases exclusively, distributed electronically. Springer thrives in a post-paper world.

Matthew &c.,

It'll be curious to see the effect of the past two or three years
on prices. (The cost of paper has certainly increased.) Some
sort of comparison should be possible once figures find their
way through to the ALA:

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some day?

As far as I can see, what was suggested in the post was that since its a
copyright violation,to proceed with caution and also giving some
instructions on how to remain undetected..
quoting " Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a serious breach
of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!)...

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection

impossible, . , ,Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models
from future publishers".
and with understanding why it is done.
Again quoting "
 And for readers without

access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the

library system. And time matters.
And giving justification for using the service.

and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

As far as I can see it was a very helpful post.

Dear colleagues,
until now this discussion focused on our role as victims of this system, 
however, we are not only consumers but also content providers. And as 
such we feed this system and enable it. If fewer colleagues submitted 
articles to high-priced volumes, if fewer colleagues signed book 
contracts with the big,? profiteering international publishers, their 
system would crumble.

And there are alternatives: we have collected several at our FOASAS 
website: https://foasas.org/#journals
It is in our hands to make these publishers and journals more 
prestigious. In consequence, they will be able to (at least partly) 
replace the big profiteering publishers. Then, dubious solutions like 
libgen will gradually become obsolete.

Best wishes,
Vitus Angermeier

Indeed, thank you for the summary.

I plainly support this opinion.
I take it that my speech was too colourful.
Surely not as helpful as the one of Dominik, though it was intended in support of it..

I see no need to have any shame whatsoever in using such helpful platforms. I even wonder why we should hide it.
Suggesting the opposite, especially in this precise case, seems... well.... You may choose your wording better than I did.

Again, no offense intended. I aimed at no colleague but spoke in general terms, if one was to suggest a moral issue with using 'lib gen,' especially in regard to this book.

Perhaps stating our use of such services more openly could also bring to light the problem in today's publishing.

Moreover, I find that the desire to regulate everything (proposing a monthly fee for example) seldom helps those most affected by the original problem (in this case prohibitive pricing).
This was a perspective on Dominik's proposition. Take it or leave it.

Some things, in my view, are better left untouched. (Perhaps it was the case with this conversation, in regard to my own contribution.)

Thank you for the discussion.

Kindly,

As far as I can see, what was suggested in the post was that since its a copyright violation,to proceed with caution and also giving some instructions on how to remain undetected..
quoting " Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a serious breach of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!)...

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection

impossible, . , ,Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models from future publishers".
and with understanding why it is done.
Again quoting "
 And for readers without

access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the

library system. And time matters.
And giving justification for using the service.

and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

As far as I can see it was a very helpful post.

Dear Mr. Kapstein,

You are right, I could have kept it shorter for the sake of clarity.

I see no reason whatsoever to even suggest not using 'lib gen.'

Raising the issue, especially in the context of the current excess from Springer (not from the authors, obviously), is (in my eyes) both faint morality and slightly obscene.

No offense intended.

Dear Mr. Bouthillette,

You write
There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.

But in fact, no party to the discussion wrote anything that would warrant this comment.

It was agreed by all, I think, that Springer?s outrageous pricing is the problem. And there was no suggestion that the authors benefit from this, so it is not quite clear what you?re saying here.

cordially ,
Matthew Kapstein

Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Publication on Logical Thought in India

I would like to begin by congratulating the authors for their hard work on the "Handbook of Logical Thought in India."
No doubt there is something in there worth the read.

Yet, perhaps to add to the discussion, for anyone actually working in India, and perhaps especially in indological fields, one wonders what logic, if any, is there behind such a price tag.

Colleagues may play the good political game of highlighting the criminality of copyrights infringement related to sites like 'lib gen,' yet without these doing research in the Global South would be an almost impossible project at the moment. Public libraries are too often outdated and private ones must carefully decide what to acquire.
I remember doing research work at JNU at a time before 'lib gen.' Most books on Indian philosophy were at least 40 years old. I do hope it changed on the bookshelves. But I know that 'lib gen' changed the game for sure.

There is something slightly obscene in seeing the faint morality of our comfortable professorial colleagues even suggesting that sites like 'lib gen' might infringe (their) authorial rights.
And at the same time seeing a book on 'Indian logic' available at the illogical cost of more than a full month salary for most of my colleagues in Indian institutions.

Even a certain Netflix-like payment a month is not necessarily something our students can afford.
Should we forbid them the most convenient and obvious way to get access to international research?

Let it be my defence of pedagogical piracy in an age of corporate pirates.

I was delighted to see my book on these Websites as soon as it got out...
I hope all the others will land there too.

Cordially,

Wikipedia describes it as a 'shadow library'.

In fact, it is a place where you can get a major part of contemporary indological books.

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some day?

The publishing industry today is where the music industry was about two or
three decades ago.  Libgen is rather like the original Napster
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster>.  Libgen makes many books
downloadable without any regard for copyright rights or the law generally.
Publishing companies from time to time try to shut down Libgen and its
predecessors like Library.Nu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library.nu>.
In the past few months, for example, such a publishers' consortium has
succeeded in shutting down many of the mirrors of Libgen (like
https://b-ok.cc/).  But it's whack-a-mole.  What publishers are not
responding to is the need for a new model of digital book distribution,
analogous to streamed music.  We should be able to pay about $10 per month
and read whatever we want.  Amazon is the one large company I know that has
tried this, with its Kindle Unlimited
<https://www.amazon.ca/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?ref_=nav_em__k_ku_0_2_4_8>
program.  That way, everyone gets paid, and everyone can read without fear
of prosecution.

Where does that leave us?  Downloading books from Libgen is almost always a
serious breach of copyright (so always use an anonymizing VPN!).  On the
other hand, it is often irresistibly convenient.  And for readers without
access to a well-funded library system, it can be the *only* way to read a
book.  If you want to check a single page or quotation, it is hard to
justify the purchase of a whole book, especially at academic book prices.
Sometimes, Libgen can allow one to check a reference far more quickly than
by accessing the same book DRM-protected and legally accessible through the
library system.  And time matters.
There are so many books on Libgen published by companies like Brill and
Routledge that it's hard to believe they are not quietly aware of it, and
accepting it as an alternative distribution method, although of course they
would officially deny it.  So many of the PDFs are clearly publishers'
originals, not scans, suggesting at the very least that there is
uncontrolled leakage of content directly from the publishers.

We live in interesting times.  Libgen is more than merely "shadowy."  To
download from Libgen is in most cases a crime against copyright law (has
the author been dead for more than 60 years).  Just as it used to be with
Napster and early Spotify.  At the same time, the obscene profits of giant
publishing corporations like Pearson, Bertelsmann, Elsevier and Springer
and Scholastic, coupled with their unwillingness to adapt to the world of
digital distribution, make it almost inevitable that Libgen exists.

Downloading from Libgen can be handled in a manner that makes detection
impossible, and in many cases the breach of copyright is so slight, for
example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

Proceed with caution, and hope for better business models from future
publishers.

Best wishes,
Dominik

Matthew &c.,

It'll be curious to see the effect of the past two or three years
on prices. (The cost of paper has certainly increased.) Some
sort of comparison should be possible once figures find their
way through to the ALA:

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can
vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may
not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is
prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some
day?

best regards,
Matthew Kapstein?

Dear Richard,

The book we?ve been discussing is over 450 euros. I don?t believe that Springer?s extravagant pricing is a function of rising costs of paper.

So there is no paper involved for ?460, and heaven forbid if you want it in
paper.

By the way, the extremely odd pricing suggests either that this is
converted from another currency or that the pricing is calculated by some
machine with zero human input; a price with 3 cents is not proposed by a
human.

Right. Springer?s price gouging is well known to be based on a business model that depends on insanely high prices for institutional subscriptions to scientific journals that are primarily, or in many cases exclusively, distributed electronically. Springer thrives in a post-paper world.

Thanks, Jay,

I have the good fortune to use a library that has e-access and I can vouch for the considerable interest of the volume. For readers who may not have such connections, however, it is unfortunate that it is prohibitively expensive. May we hope to see a ?cheap? edition some day?

best regards,
Matthew Kapstein

Thank you to Michael Witzel who pointed me to his edition and translation of The Katha Aranyaka 2.100 and was kind enough to translate the passage into english.

And thank you to Corinna Wessels-Mevissen who pointed me  to Stella Kramrisch's The Presence of Shiva.

Dear list members,
1) Both Monier-Williams and Apte define pin?ka as the bow or staff of Shiva
but then they both also define it as the trident of Shiva. Though M-W notes
the meaning is from the lexicographers and I suspect he is refering to this
note in Bohtlink-Roth. Nach den Lexicographen ist pin?ka m. n. = ??la ( Ak.
3, 4, 1, 14 ), = ?a?karasya ??lam Bhar. zu Ak. ?kdr. = tri??la H. an. 3,
65. Med. k. 119.

1. Can someone clarify the abreviations in the above quote. I'm not a
german speaker.

2. Does anyone know any textual references to pin?ka meaning tri??la of
?iva?

I also found this on-line definition in wisdomlib
https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/pinaka
P?n?ka was formerly the three-forked spike of ?iva. Once it fell down from
the hands of ?iva and on falling down took the shape of a bow. From then
onwards it was used as a bow.

Does anyone know the textual source for this story.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dominik brought up a very important point.  What is considered fair use of
copyrighted material.
He suggested:
for

example if less than 10% of the book is displayed on the computer screen,
that if it came to court it might be judged "fair use."

Have any list members looked at this and know what has been decided in
court about what is considered "fair use"

In brief, relying on a "fair use" defence can be perilous - depending on
the jurisdiction. There are long chapters in the standard legal texts on
Copyright Law outlining the various nuances in the both Common Law and
Civil Law jurisdictions. (Lawfully!) grab the latest edition of a text on
Copyright Law in your jurisdiction and there is bound to be at least one
full chapter on the topic. It's a very fertile area of litigation -
sapienti sat!

According to Mayrhofer?s Etymological dictionary (Bd. II, 1992, p. 132) p?n?ka- n. means ?stick, staff? (Stab, Stock) and ?bow? (of Rudra/?iva) (attested since Atharvaveda and Yajurveda). According to Mayrhofer, the word has not been convincingly explained, but the connection with Greek p?naks m. ?wooden board, writing tablet, painting, etc? and Russian pen? (gen.sg <http://gen.sg/>. pnya) ?stump? of a tree (Frisk II 539 with literature) remains possible. ? In my opinion, the word can be convincingly explained: pi = api ?upon? + n?ka- m. heavenly vault, sky = rainbow seen upon the sky and understood as the bow of Rudra/?iva.

The abbreviations for the lexicographers are Ak. = Amarako?a, Bhar. is a commentary on Amarako?a, H ) Hemacandra, an. is Hemacandra's  Anek?rthasa?gaho, Med. k. = Medin?ko?a (Medin?kara?s N?n?rthasa?graha).

Dear colleagues,

I sit on one of the committees of the Coalition Publica
<https://www.coalition-publi.ca/>, a Canadian organization that promotes
Open Access publication. (The journal I edit, HSSA <http://hssa-journal.org>,
receives support and funding through Coalitiona Publica and is archived and
re-hosted at ?rudit.org <http://erudit.org>.)  In our meeting yesterday, we
talked a lot about the obligatory introduction of Plan S
<https://www.coalition-s.org/>in Canada, and some of the difficulties and
worries that this has created for some formerly commercial journals who are
having to "flip" their funding and editing models in a relatively short
period.  Amongst many interesting points raised was that when the
membership of one of Canada's prominent academic societies was asked to
vote on whether their journal should go OA and whether it should continue
in print, there was a clear majority for OA and digital-only.

There's a great deal of serious academic literature and reflection on all
these issues - as well as the legal literature kindly highlighted by
Antonio Ferreira-Jardim.  To get on top of it would mean giving up Indology
:-)  Perhaps I could point to just one article that seems particularly
interesting, though it's already eight years old.

Larivi?re, V., Haustein, S. and Mongeon, P. (2015) ?The Oligopoly of
Academic Publishers in the Digital Era,? PLOS ONE. Public Library of
Science (PLoS) 10. Available at:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502.

The abstract says,

The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the topic
of much debate within and outside the scientific community, especially in
relation to major publishers? high profit margins. However, the share of
scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as
well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet
been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million
documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows
that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and
humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor &
Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the
advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific
publishers account for more than 50% of all papers published in 2013.
Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration
(70% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have
remained relatively independent (20% from top five publishers). NMS
disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their
scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The
paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big
publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation
impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly
publishing.

The big picture is that from the 1970s to 2013, a small group of commercial
publishers had succeeded in gaining control of most academic publishing.

However, amongst the interesting points made is that the behaviour of
publishing in the Humanities is significantly different from the situation
in the Social Sciences and STEM.  This paragraph from p. 7:

On the other hand, papers in arts and humanities are still largely
dispersed amongst many
smaller publishers, with the top five commercial publishers only accounting
for 20% of human-
ities papers and 10% of arts papers in 2013, despite a small increase since
the second half of the
1990s. The relatively low cost of journals in those disciplines?a
consequence of their lower
publication density?might explain the lower share of the major commercial
publishers. Also,
the transition from print to electronic?a strong argument for journals to
convert to commer-
cial publishers?has happened at a much slower pace in those disciplines as
the use for recent
scientific information is less pressing [28]. Moreover, these disciplines
make a much more im-
portant use of books [9] and generally rely on local journals [29], all of
which are factors that
make it much less interesting for big publishers to buy journals or found
new ones in the arts
and humanities.

(I disagree with the assertion that the transition from print to electronic
is "a strong argument for journals to convert to commercial publishers."
The opposite seems true to me, especially today.  Perhaps this is a change
since 2013, with the growing maturity and popularity of OJS
<https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/> and the work of the DOAJ.)  It looks as
if our own fields have escaped the worst of the recent changes.

What all this means is that although OA is growing, there's still a long
way to go and the publishers' Oligopoly is still very powerful.  This can
change if members of learned societies express their wishes to the leaders
of these societies and their journals, and if founders of new journals take
OA seriously as an important goal for the distribution of learning and
discovery across all academic communities worldwide.  Another vital
component of change is for governments and major funding bodies to insist
that the results of the research they pay for is published OA.  That's Plan
S.

Finally, it's also worth noting the effect of Article Processing Fees.
Often, OA as implemented by the publishers' Oligopoly is coupled with the
requirement for APFs.  Without OA, colleagues in India cannot not afford to
buy and read many books and journals.  But in the old pre-OA model, they
could publish, because article-acceptance was on merit, with no fees.  When
APFs are introduced into the business model, colleagues in the developing
world can read OA publications freely, but they can often not afford to
publish.  It's a choice of being blind, or mute.   The equitable situation
is to have OA without APFs, i.e., for journals to find their funding from
sources other than their authors.

Best wishes,
Dominik

agreement and is different in different countries.

Dear list members,
Isn'tt one solution to the high price of new academic books from certain
publishers that these in copyright books be uploaded to the "Books to
Borrow" library of archive.org (Thats how I got Stella Kramrisch's In the
Presence of Shiva).
https://archive.org/details/inlibrary?tab=about

As it says

Books in this collection may be borrowed by logged in patrons.  You may
read the books online in your browser or, in some cases, download them  . .
.Please note that works in this collection are protected by copyright law

I didn't see how or who could upload books to this "books to borrow"
library.
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear Harry,

You may find the video on this page answers how to contribute or sponsor an in-copyright book for loan: https://help.archive.org/help/borrowing-from-the-lending-library/

My. Understanding is that archive.org <http://archive.org/> must obtain a copy of the book by purchasing it or through donation. It can then offer its digital copy for loan. Restrictions under copyright law prevent them from accepting a scanned copy that you or I might make. They ran into some legal trouble when they relaxed the borrowing rules early in the Covid-19 pandemic. See, for example: https://www.npr.org/2020/06/03/868861704/publishers-sue-internet-archive-for-mass-copyright-infringement

Thank you for this.  The final paras put the whole issue succinctly:

Siddharthan, the computational biologist, said, ?I have seen that students,
even from modest colleges, learn online via open courseware and also
enthusiastically read scientific literature.?

He, therefore, believes that blocking access to scientific literature would
be ?severely detrimental? for such students. According to him, the solution
may lie in encouraging the scientific publishing industry to explore
affordable access options for the general public.

?*A parallel is the panic about Napster, BitTorrent etc in the movie and
music industries 20 years ago. That problem was solved not via bans, but
via affordable legal services like iTunes, Amazon Prime, and Netflix
offering the same content*,? he explained.

?People will be willing to pay, within reason,? he added.

Hi Harry,

I was having trouble with the domain server and web hosting service working
correctly together last week. It should be fixed now. Can you try again and
let me know if the problem persists?

Thanks,

Nikhil

as well as by research students. Papers are pre-circulated so that
participants can read them before the seminar to ensure the best possible
use of discussion time. Papers are therefore *not* read out at the seminar
itself but instead briefly introduced by the chair who will then raise
questions to the paper-giver, before opening the discussion. Papers should
be no longer than 20 A4 pages, including notes and references. To
facilitate discussion for those short of reading time, paper-givers should
provide a one-page abstract of the key argument of the paper, along with
their paper. Please include your email address for further feedback.

Hello friends and colleagues,

I recently defended my PhD dissertation, and although I will properly
publish at least some part of it hopefully soon, and although there is
always room for improvement, I think I should share the materials (PDF +
websites) now, while the iron is relatively hot, in case anyone can make
use of them in the meantime:
https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-826296
(full-text PDF download link at the bottom of the page)

Part 1 contains an edition, translation, and analysis of Ny?yabh??a?a
104?154, which mainly battles Buddhist views relating to the idea of the
ontological whole (*avayavin*) and many related topics like error (*bhr?nti*,
*viparyaya*) and reflexive awareness (*svasa?vedana*). The translation also
contains hyperlinks to Part 2...

Part 2 documents an experimental text-mining system called V?t?yana, online
now as a web app at vatayana.info <https://www.vatayana.info>. Basically,
it uses a suite of NLP methods to automatically find parallels within a
corpus, which so far is the Pram??aNLP corpus (on GitHub
<https://github.com/tylergneill/pramana-nlp>), of mostly Ny?ya and Bauddha
philosophical affiliation. If you're interested in exploring the web app,
please know that it's very much in "alpha" status, meaning it is buggy and
has not yet been tested by many people. (And alas! No how-to tutorial yet.)
I'm interested in gentle feedback, but please know that I am short on time
these days.

Oh, and if it helps, here's a link to a recording of my dissertation defense
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kUHHD_RGV7cWS1A8Pkmne7G7PuRJLH1o/view?usp=sharing>,
in which I explain some more things. Best to follow along with the PDF; I
forgot to share-screen at one point while referencing pp. 136?138.

Hopefully by sharing these things openly, they'll be of more use to some of
you out there.

Kind regards,
Tyler Neill

Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have a substantive list of standard journal abbreviations, that
they are willing to share, like this:

Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies;BSOAS
Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute;ABORI
Indo-Iranian Journal;IIJ

The formatting doesn't matter, of course.

Best,
Dominik

Thank you, everyone!  I should have been clearer that I'm looking for a
machine-readable file.  I.e., plain text.  But I think the PDF sent by
Prof. Michaels is going to be easy to convert.  It was created by Nitro,
which suggests there's a word-processor file somewhere.  But anyhoo, I'll
give it a try now.

Thank you everyone!  No more needed for now.

Best,
Dominik

In case it's of use, I attach the list I've made based on the one sent by
Prof Michaels (thank you!).  This is not comprehensive, it's just for
personal use with JabRef <https://www.jabref.org/> and for journals that
are commonly used enough (by me) that an abbreviation could be useful.

Dear all,

for those of you interested in yoga, this might be the right moment for the announcement that modernyogaresearch.org<http://modernyogaresearch.org>, a website pioneered by, among others, Elizabeth de Michelis and Mark Singleton, is being prepared for a serious relaunch. A new team around Suzanne Newcombe and myself is emerging, mostly consisting of a group of scholars from the Yoga Dar?ana, Yoga S?dhan?<https://ydys2022.org/> international yoga conference in Krak?w in May 2022. Also its domain is changing to simply yogaresearch.org<http://yogaresearch.org>, one reason for which being the fact that the study of pre-modern yoga, research by classical Indologists, is prominently featured on it, side-by-side and interacting with work by mostly social and religious scientists on modern yoga.

As part of this relaunch a user research study is just commencing, to which I would like to invite those of you who are interested. There is a short survey<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZNlCwLRbsfQvLR_kx2c6bh5hQiOI4r49tYy8IZUVh-w/edit>. Completing it will take only a couple of minutes and your answers will be completely anonymous. You?ll be asked some questions and if you can take part in further research. Findings will be used to help develop the new website. Closing date is Wednesday 8 March 2023. For more information contact Sally SJ Brown<mailto:sallybrownsjb at gmail.com>.

Access the survey<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZNlCwLRbsfQvLR_kx2c6bh5hQiOI4r49tYy8IZUVh-w/edit>

If you have any questions about the new website, would like to get involved or have your research featured on it you can contact me. Please feel free to forward this email to whoever else you think might be interested. Thank you for your help.

Best wishes

Peter Pasedach on behalf of the website team

Dear list members,
I'm looking at a manuscript from the Ragunath Temple Sanskrit Manuscript
Library, Jammu, j&K. The text is  aj??nadv?ntad?pik? by soman?tha
The link to the pdf on archive.org is:
https://archive.org/download/AgyanDhvantaDeepikaShriSomnath4966Alm22Shlf4DevanagariTantra/Agyan%20Dhvanta%20Deepika%20-%20Shri%20Somnath_4966_Alm_22_Shlf_4_Devanagari-%20Tantra.pdf

Looking at the first few lines it looks to me like the scribe is using the
devanagari letter  ? for both ? and ?.  Is that common practice in
devanagari manuscripts from kashmir?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear Indology Members,

Is anyone able to share a scan of the *Bh???yogav?si??has?ra*
by Kavindracarya?

Worldcat shows the only holding library is Library of Congress; and I do
not see this in archive.org.

The full citation is below:

Title: Kav?ndr?c?rya-Sarasvat? k? Bh???yogav?si??has?ra (J??nas?ra)
Editor: VG Rahurkar
Publisher: Poona: Bharatavani-prakasanamala, 1969
OCLC No.: 23211246

Thank you,
Samuel

Dear Harry Spier,

I'm not sure when ba became a dedicated ak?ara within the Devan?gar?
script, but what you describe has been the norm for Brahmic script
manuscript transmissions over history.

In Bengali, and even in the standard Bengali-English Samsad dictionary, b and v are given as the same letter.

Dear All,
I transmit this message for a colleague, T.P. Mahadevan (Howard U.) who is not a member.

2 brief attachments about Dr. Olga Novick and Professor Nilakandan and about the renovated Trissur Mathom.
The first is a brief report about the Trissur Brahmasva Ma?hom and its new manuscriptological facility under Dr. Olga Novick of Hamburg University.  The whole new effort is under the over-all direction and planning of Dr. Nilakandan.

The second item is a brochure about the fully renovated Brahmasva Ma?hom as a research center in different fields of Indology, with several Ph.D-level investigations are going on?all under the direction of Professor  Nilakandan, formerly of the K?la?i ?a?kar?ch?rya Sanskrit University

Dear Harry,

the matter is more complex:

1st, your MS,  obviously a copy of a ??rad? MS,  is written in the typical Kashmiri style Devanagari of the mid-late 19th century; it has many North Indian peculiarities, besides the v/b case, such as the abundance of Anusv?ra dots, not typical for Kashmiri ??rad? MSS that write homorganic nasals.

2nd, ??rad? MSS distinguish between v (looks like N?gar? v) and b, where the more squarish, circle-like part is set lower, at the bottom of the line.
Good Vedic Devan?gar? MSS also distinguish between v and b:  v is indicated by writing N?gar? v with underdot.

3rd ?standard" North Indian practice (as described in earlier posts) is another matter.

Best,

Michael

The link to the pdf on archive.org<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__archive.org_&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=tFXzIbyKS2C0TpVqKsMrj46qwsAermBN5wzaDe51So0&m=nBrjyL62xDuQCVJuuz9EqUwjRZAmOoO3cxq514GT0xMUUB2Xz5UdD2EqtSrQ4dfr&s=XxATidz8sYLwi_fC0C5uWkKsxGlNDIZoubvQxQZF5MY&e=> is:

Looking at the first few lines it looks to me like the scribe is using the devanagari letter  ? for both ? and ?.  Is that common practice in devanagari manuscripts from kashmir?
Thanks,

Thank you Michael for your usual clarity.
1. Does the brownish red over a word in a manuscript always mean a
deletion? For example in this manuscript on page 1 there is brownish-red
ink blob covering the word "sarva" but deleting this would make the meter
incorrect. Note: page 2 has what looks like an obvious deletion with a
strikethrough instead of a blob of ink. (removing this text preserves the
meter).

2. Michael wrote: [this manuscript\] has many North Indian peculiarities,
This manuscript and others I've examined from this collection  from
different scribes have verse  numbers at the end of verses but no dandas.
marking either 1/2 verse or the end verse.    This is even the case in a
manuscript that starts with ||?riga?e??yanama? ||  I.e. a phrase in double
dandas. Is this (numbers only but no dandas marking verses) a north Indian
peculiarity? Is it common?

Thanks,
Harry Spier

NEW BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT

A shunned Indologist
Ludwig Poley (1805?1885)
By Rosane Rocher

Wiesbaden 2023
Harrassowitz Verlag
Abhandlungen f?r die Kunde des Morgenlandes, Band 130
Paperback, xii, 110 pp.
14.50 ? 22.00 cm
ISBN: 978-3-447-11989-4
Price: EUR 36,00

SUMMARY: Rosane Rocher describes the not always happy and exemplary, 
but fascinating life of Ludwig Poley (1805?1885), which contrasts with 
biographies usually reserved for illustrious scholars. The book explores the 
challenges that a nineteenth-century German Indologist could face, reveals his 
strategies for overcoming them, and his character flaws that made him both 
rejected by his peers and accepted in literary salons. As an illegitimate child, 
Poley depended on scholarships. He published in Berlin an edition and Latin 
translation of a Sanskrit text, which he did not submit at the University. Yet, 
he later claimed it to have been his doctoral dissertation. As Louis Poley, he 
made a name for himself in Paris as a brilliant young protagonist of the 
Oriental Renaissance, and he published editions and French translations of 
some Upanishads. He was a respected employee at the Prussian Embassy in 
London until he was abruptly dismissed for his involvement in a scandal. Years 
of wandering through Europe without academic employment followed. A 
transnational and multilingual scholar, he contributed to the introduction of 
English and German into the French secondary school curriculum. Only in the 
last two decades of his life did he teach at a university. He was both a private 
lecturer in Indian culture and antiquities and a teacher of French language 
and literature at the University of Vienna and at other academic institutions. 
Poley's last publication on the Ved?ntas?ra, published by the Austrian 
Academy of Sciences, was a final expression of his lifelong commitment to the 
exploration of Ved?nta.

Dear all,
In transcribing (not making an edition) of  a manuscript like this with ?
written for both ? and ? is it best practice to have the transcription also
follow the practice of the original manuscript and also just use the letter ?
. And leave any interpretation about both word breaks and whats a *v* or a
*b* to any users of the transcription.
Thanks,
Harry Spier

In either an edition or a transliteration I would transmit each word in
Roman script with either a ba or va depending on the correct spelling of
the word.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit and Vedic Sanskrit language models available on
 Hugging Face
Message-ID: <CAOB6=r870sTF0W29EgjqvV2eydbBriHNJQ7zKRF58PuWArf=uw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

In the context of the BMBF project "ChronBMM - Dating text corpora
using Bayesian Mixture Models" (https://chronbmm.phil.hhu.de/) Oliver
Hellwig, Sven Sellmer and I have developed a number of contextual
language models based on the XLM-RoBERTa architecture that achieve
very strong performance on a host of downstream tasks.
We make two of these models available on our organization on Hugging
Face: https://huggingface.co/chronbmm

One is a multidomain general Sanskrit model trained on more than 2GB
of web-scraped Sanskrit material from various sources (manually typed
etexts as well as OCR input). The second model is a specific model
fine-tuned on a corpus of Vedic Sanskrit which achieves SOTA on POS
tagging,  dependency parsing, and other related tasks. Both models
accept Devanagari as input. No further preprocessing such as Sandhi
splitting is necessary.
With best regards,

Sebastian

Dear Colleagues,

I have just received the sad news that the Indologist and Tibetologist  
Helmut Eimer passed away on 24 February 2023 at the age of 86. We have  
lost not only the pioneer of the study of the history and textual  
tradition of the Tibetan Kanjur, but also an always helpful and  
amiable teacher and colleague.

Yours sincerely,
Roland Steiner
