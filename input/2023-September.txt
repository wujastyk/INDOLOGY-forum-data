Dear colleagues,

I'm wondering if anyone has any good recommendations for secondary sources on the nature and role of the figure of the s?ta. Van Buitenen, in his introduction to the Bhagavadg?t?, writes (1981, p. 5): "Traditionally the s?ta, on the chariot of the warrior, is witness to the warrior's triumphs and occasional lapses; in danger he protects him. The triumphs of the warrior he celebrates in song, hence s?ta also means 'bard.'" I'd like to read more about the details of this. Is there any good scholarship on it?

Gratefully,
James Reich

Dear Professors and Esteemed Colleagues,

I am currently in my second year of pursuing a PhD at Temple University.

As a part of my doctoral studies, I have undertaken the task of translating Dharmak?rti's Pram??avini?caya. At present, my focus is primarily on the second chapter of this work, with an intention to delve into other chapters in due course, maybe after the Ph.D.

I am searching for a series of papers authored by Tadashi Tani, titled "The Problem of Interpretation on Pram??avini?caya III," spanning from 1986 to 1994. A complete bibliography can be found on this page for your reference. EAST - The ?Pram??avini?caya,? by Dharmak?rti (oeaw.ac.at)<https://east.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/data/7/18/>

If, by any chance, you possess these papers within your library or personal collection, I would be immensely grateful if you could kindly share copies with me. Your assistance in this matter would be of great value to my academic pursuits.

For any further communication, my email liyanage at temple.edu is always open.

Thank you in advance for considering my request, and I appreciate your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

Bertram G. Liyanage

Subject: [INDOLOGY] the sign/sound nexus in Indic scripts
Message-ID: <AS8PR10MB73269B2FBA2BAA327AEB72A0A5E9A@AS8PR10MB7326.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear colleagues,

Scholars of Sanskrit are lucky in being able to work with a writing system that is tailor-made to express the sounds of the language and a pretty well established set of scholarly conventions for Romanization. There is no great difference between a graphemic and a phonological representation of Sanskrit. This probably holds for several other South Asian languages too. And there seems to a be a great stability in the relationship between sign and sound, as least in the languages that I know. The Oriya ?, the Bengali ?, the Tamil ? are palaeographically related and all represent the same consonant phoneme ? although the accompanying vowel differs. There are some other regional differences, but my entirely subjective impression is that stability of the sign-sound nexus is more impressive than differentiation in the history of script-use in India.

I am pondering this matter and am wondering if it has given rise to scholarly analysis and interesting publications that members of the list might be able to refer me to.

The background is formed by cases of significant change in the script/sound nexus that I have encountered in Southeast Asian languages and my concern about what they mean for Romanization strategies (in particular the applicability if ISO 15919). Two examples:

1. https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batak_(blok_Unicode)

In the Batak writing system of North Sumatra, the word pustaha means ?book? and we can all guess the origin of this word. The last syllable is represented by ? (Unicode U+1BC2 BATAK LETTER HA), which is palaeographically related to the three ak?aras shown above and yet maps to a different phoneme. (In fact, in some Batak dialects other than the culturally dominant Toba dialect, which has been followed by Unicode, the same word spelt with the same ak?ara is pronounced as the Sanskrit word pustaka.)

2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_(Unicode_block)

In the modern Cham script of Vietnam and Cambodia, ? (palaeographically related to ?, ? etc.) represents a consonant /n/ with a particular high vowel (maybe something like [?]) and is defined as CHAM LETTER NUE in Unicode, while the ligature ? that palaeographically matches with ??? is pronounced as /na/ and hence called CHAM LETTER NA in Unicode, any notion of a voiced stop /d/ being absent from the minds of native speakers when they think about this ak?ara.

I will be grateful for pointers to help think about such phenomena in a comparative way.

Dear all,

Does someone know the source of Mallin?tha's definition of viyogin? ad
Kum?rasambhava 4.1: vi?ame sasaj? guru? same sabhar? lo 'tha gurur viyogin?
? In the appendix to Velankar's  Jayad?man, only the Mand?ramarandacamp? is
listed as having a metre named viyogin?. Others define the metre as
Vait?l?ya (e.g., Vallabhadeva) and Velankar has a note on this as well. I
checked a couple of other works but have not been able to find
Mallin?tha's/Apte's definition. Thanks!

All the Best,
Victor

Hi Arlo,

It?s an interesting problem and Tibetan, Burmese, Thai and Cambodian all present analogous issues as well. There are no doubt other cases, perhaps Lao, Cham, etc. I would be interested to learn of serious comparative work on the question. Perhaps a topic for a workshop ?

Matthew

There is no great difference between a graphemic and a phonological representation of Sanskrit. This probably holds for several other South Asian languages too. And there seems to a be a great stability in the relationship between sign and sound, as least in the languages that I know. The Oriya ?, the Bengali ?, the Tamil ? are palaeographically related and all represent the same consonant phoneme ? although the accompanying vowel differs. There are some other regional differences, but my entirely subjective impression is that stability of the sign-sound nexus is more impressive than differentiation in the history of script-use in India.

Message-ID: <AS8PR10MB7326FF43ECEACF7EC01F0C49A5E8A@AS8PR10MB7326.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear colleagues,

In addition to the excellent resource Pancanga (https://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/) some of you may have use for the application HIC that we have just succeeded in translating from a standalone Java application to an online application in JavaScript.

See https://hic.efeo.fr/.

One of the nice features is that the system allows downloading diagrams showing the parameters of a given date. E.g., I just tested the date in a Badami Calukya inscription (https://erc-dharma.github.io/tfb-badamicalukya-epigraphy/workflow-output/html/CalE01-Makarappi-Pulakesin2.html) and get the attached diagram. The inscription mentions a solar eclipse which I believe I am able to identify as <https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=06120802>, just one day off from the reading generated by HIC. So we seem to have a pretty good match.

The application also has features that are useful only for people wishing to convert dates involving the 210-day cycle ('wuku') that is typical of Hindu dates on Java and Bali.

I am still working on releasing the source code through github.

The authors of the original program are advanced in age and not fully available to keep improving the application. I am neither a specialist of the relevant ??stra nor a JavaScript programmer but should there be useful feedback, I will try to discuss it with the authors and can try to have improvements implemented by the programmer.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

Dear Victor,

This is not really an answer, but we have viyogin? listed in our table of prosodic patterns for the DHARMA project.

Please look here: <https://erc-dharma.github.io/output-prosody/display-prosody.html>.

The definition and list of references we cite are:

sa-sa-ja-ga/sa-bha-ra-la-ga???

Apte 1890, Appendix A: Sanskrit Prosody, page 11, ? I.B.4.
Velankar 1949.
Zoetmulder 1974.

I have just completed the Zoetmulder reference in the source file but the html still needs to be updated. We still have to complete the Velankar reference.

On p. 470, Zoetmulder 1974 (Kalangwan: A survey of Old Javanese literature) cites a few occurrences from the 9th-c. Kakavin R?m?ya?a and associates the name Prabodhit? with this meter. I haven't attempted to track down his source for this name.

Best,

Arlo

Hemacandra refers to this metre in his Chando'nus?s?na (3.14) as "prabodhit?".

* * *


The Viyogin?/Prabodhit? is, in a sense, a "frozen" form of the  
Vait?l?ya metre, which is defined as follows:

3x2 m?tr?s plus ra la ga; 4x2 m?tr?s plus ra la ga.

The corresponding var?av?ttas are the Viyogin? metre and the  
Aparavaktra metre.

Viyogin?: sa sa ja ga ; sa bha ra la ga

? ? ? / ? ? ?  / ? ?  ? / ?
? ? ? / ?  ? ? / ?  ? ?  / ? ?  (analysed as the var?av?tta "Viyogin?")

=

? ? / ?  / ? ?/  ?  ? ? / ?  ?
? ? / ? / ?  / ? ? / ?  ? ?  / ? ? (analysed as the m?tr?v?tta "Vait?l?ya")


* * *

Aparavaktra: na na ra la ga ; na ja ja ra

? ? ? / ? ? ? / ?  ? ? / ? ?
? ? ? / ? ?  ? / ? ?  ? / ?  ? ?  ( analysed as the var?av?tta "Aparavaktra")

? ? / ?  ? / ?  / ?  ?  /?  ?  ?  / ? ?  (analysed as the m?tr?v?tta

"When such a metre has the same ak?araga?as in both the halves as  
above [that is, as in the metres M?labh?ri??, Viyogin?, and  
Aparavaktra], it should be considered as a var?av?tta; otherwise it  
should be regarded as a m?tr?v?tta." (H. D. Velankar)

Roland

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Exchange, Gifting, and Sacrificing
Message-ID: <CAGr5HvSaj6xoQ=xBNQc3ZuTnhX_vPhFN0LMQKjWvRfvefBF+WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,


with my apology for any cross postings, I like to point to a recently
published book of mine:



*Harald Wiese: Exchange, Gifting, and Sacrificing: Premodern Indian
perspectives. **Heidelberg: Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing, 2023. *

ISBN 978-3-948791-73-5 (PDF), ISBN 978-3-948791-74-2 (Softcover), DOI:
https://doi.org/10.11588/hasp.1232



Content:

In both the Vedic and the classical periods, a special elite class of
people existed that were called Brahmins. In a rough manner, one might say
that their material wellbeing depended on *dak?i??* in the Vedic period and
on d?na in the classical one. Broadening the perspective beyond *dak?i??*
and *d?na*, the book is on all sorts of giving and receiving in the context
of pre-modern India, using Vedic, Sanskrit, Buddhist and, to a much lesser
extent, Roman and Christian sources. The Brahmanical theory of the gift
(i.e., the theory of dutiful gifting, *dharmad?na*) is a major focus of,
and has provided a major motivation for, this study. The book is a dialogue
between emic and etic perspectives. With respect to the latter, I apply
modern economic, sociological, ethnological, and marketing theories to
premodern givings and takings.



The book has been published by Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing (HASP).
It is available by free download from the publisher's website (
https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/catalog/book/1232) and can also be bought
as a softcover through the usual channels.



Information page in English:

https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/catalog/book/1232?lang=en

Direct download link:

https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/reader/download/1232/1232-42-105384-1-10-20230815.pdf



All the best,

Harald Wiese

2000 *T?ntrik?bhidh?nako?a* fr/en/de Input Conventions

Here is how to input each phoneme:
? a ? ? ? aa ? i ? ? ii ? u ? ? uu
? ? r? .r ? ? r?? .rr ? ? l? .l ? ? l?? .ll
? e ? ai ? o ? au
?? ? ? .m ?? ? .h
? k ? kh ? g ? gh ? ? f ?n
? c ? ch ? j ? jh ? ? ~n
? ? .t ? ?h .th ? ? .d ? ?h .dh ? ? .n
? t ? th ? d ? dh ? n
? p ? ph ? b ? bh ? m
? y ? r ? l ? v
? ? z ? ? .s ? s ? h
? ? ? _l

To represent a hiatus, either follow the convention of adding a diaeresis
to the second vowel?as in *pra?ga*?or insert a space character between the
two vowels?as in * pra uga*.
Cross-references

At the top of dictionary entries, immediately after the headword, there is
often a list of terms that might be the same as the one you looked for, or
that might be related to it, grammatically speaking. For instance, within
the entry *gandharva*, you will find links to the entries *gandharbba*,
*gandharva?*, *gandharvva*, *gandharvva?* and *ga?dharva?*.

These clusters of terms are generated mechanically through a set of rules,
and can thus be inaccurate. Some cases are inherently ambiguous. For
instance, a term that ends with *-?* might either be a stem or the
nominative masculine singular of a term that ends with *-in*. I am
experimenting with machine learning to address these issues, but much work
remains to be done. The end goal is to make this aggregation process
transparent.

As a general rule, when searching for nouns and adjectives, you should
input the stem instead of a declined form, and then follow
cross-references, if any. If the term you are looking for does not appear
as a stem in any of the available dictionaries, you will still probably
find it among suggested approximate matches.
Browsing through Terms

It is sometimes useful to browse through terms. You can jump to a given
location in the dictionaries lexicon by typing the hash symbol # in the
search field, followed by a few characters. While doing so, you will be
presented with a list of terms that start with the prefix you typed so far.
This autocomplete feature is currently only available for romanized input.

Confirming the query will bring you to the first term that starts with the
prefix you typed, or, if there is none, to the closest term that follows
it, lexicographically speaking. Try for instance the query #uddh?r
<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23uddh%C4%81r>. Submitting the query #
<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23> just brings you to the very
beginning <https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit/meta/pages/1> of the lexicon.
Advanced Search

It is possible to find terms that match a pattern by using wildcard
characters. The question mark character ? matches a single phoneme; the
star character * matches a sequence of zero or more phonemes. Note that
matching is performed at the phoneme level, not at the character level.
Thus a?i matches abhi, but ab?i does not match it, since bh represents a
single phoneme.

It is also possible to find terms through approximate matching?sometimes
called ?fuzzy matching.? The metric used for comparing strings is the
Levenshtein
distance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>. This
matching mode is enabled by appending a tilde ~ at the end of the search
string. The query mandra~ <https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=mandra~>, for
instance, returns terms like *mandra*, *ma?dra*, *madra*, * mantra*, etc.

Approximate matching can be performed with wildcard patterns, not just
string literals. This is particularly useful for finding occurrences of a
given term within compounds. The query *uddyota~
<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=*uddyota~>, for instance, matches terms
that end with something close to *uddyota*, and returns, among else,
*uddyota*, * ??ntyuddyota*, *?c?roddyota*, *udyota*, etc.
Credits

Most of the above dictionaries were prepared and encoded by Jim Funderburk,
Thomas Malten *et al.* at Cologne University
<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>. The textual version of
Whitney?s *Roots* comes from Peter Scharf <https://sanskritlibrary.org/>,
with some emendations of my own. The enlarged edition of Apte?s dictionary
is derived from the data prepared at the University of Chicago
<https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/apte>.

This is a very valuable resource.

As to the autocomplete, maybe it is o any help the indexing method that was
applied for the SARIT project <https://sarit.indology.info/>, namely to
index all the texts, no matter if they were in devanagari or
transliteration, by converting the indexed terms to the SLP1 format. Thus,
one is able to search both in devanagari and in transliteration (the query
string is converted to SLP1), and get results both in devanagari and in
transliteration.

Best regards,

Dear all,

My website is up again. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Briefly put, the main page sanskritists might find useful is
https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit. From there, you can search about fourty
Sanskrit dictionaries at once, and you can download various data files I
prepared for this purpose.

My primary motivation for writing the search tool was to allow tolerant
retrieval: you can look for approximate matches of a given term, and you
can navigate between dictionary entries that might refer to the same term
but follow different notational conventions (for instance, the entries
bandha, bandha?, and ba?dha? are linked together).

This is a labour of love I am doing in my spare time, but suggestions and
bug reports are welcome nonetheless.

Best,
Micha?l Meyer

Dear Micha?l Meyer

I am pretty sure that I speak for a great many colleagues when I say THANK
YOU and it is an absolutely wonderful resource! The fuzziness of the search
is also great for (among other things) those of us who read things which
sometimes have nonstandard spellings and the like.

So, in short: your labor of love is accepted and used with great
appreciation!!

Input Conventions

Here is how to input each phoneme:

? a ?   ? ? aa  ? i     ? ? ii  ? u     ? ? uu
? ? r? .r       ? ? r?? .rr     ? ? l? .l       ? ? l?? .ll
? e     ? ai    ? o     ? au
?? ? ? .m       ?? ? .h
? k     ? kh    ? g     ? gh    ? ? f ?n
? c     ? ch    ? j     ? jh    ? ? ~n
? ? .t  ? ?h .th        ? ? .d  ? ?h .dh        ? ? .n
? t     ? th    ? d     ? dh    ? n
? p     ? ph    ? b     ? bh    ? m
? y     ? r     ? l     ? v
? ? z   ? ? .s  ? s     ? h
? ? ? _l

To represent a hiatus, either follow the convention of adding a diaeresis to the second vowel?as in pra?ga?or insert a space character between the two vowels?as in pra uga.

Cross-references

At the top of dictionary entries, immediately after the headword, there is often a list of terms that might be the same as the one you looked for, or that might be related to it, grammatically speaking. For instance, within the entry gandharva, you will find links to the entries gandharbba, gandharva?, gandharvva, gandharvva? and ga?dharva?.

These clusters of terms are generated mechanically through a set of rules, and can thus be inaccurate. Some cases are inherently ambiguous. For instance, a term that ends with -? might either be a stem or the nominative masculine singular of a term that ends with -in. I am experimenting with machine learning to address these issues, but much work remains to be done. The end goal is to make this aggregation process transparent.

As a general rule, when searching for nouns and adjectives, you should input the stem instead of a declined form, and then follow cross-references, if any. If the term you are looking for does not appear as a stem in any of the available dictionaries, you will still probably find it among suggested approximate matches.

Browsing through Terms

It is sometimes useful to browse through terms. You can jump to a given location in the dictionaries lexicon by typing the hash symbol # in the search field, followed by a few characters. While doing so, you will be presented with a list of terms that start with the prefix you typed so far. This autocomplete feature is currently only available for romanized input.

Confirming the query will bring you to the first term that starts with the prefix you typed, or, if there is none, to the closest term that follows it, lexicographically speaking. Try for instance the query #uddh?r<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23uddh%C4%81r>. Submitting the query #<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23> just brings you to the very beginning<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit/meta/pages/1> of the lexicon.

Advanced Search

It is possible to find terms that match a pattern by using wildcard characters. The question mark character ? matches a single phoneme; the star character * matches a sequence of zero or more phonemes. Note that matching is performed at the phoneme level, not at the character level. Thus a?i matches abhi, but ab?i does not match it, since bh represents a single phoneme.

It is also possible to find terms through approximate matching?sometimes called ?fuzzy matching.? The metric used for comparing strings is the Levenshtein distance<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>. This matching mode is enabled by appending a tilde ~ at the end of the search string. The query mandra~<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=mandra~>, for instance, returns terms like mandra, ma?dra, madra, mantra, etc.

Approximate matching can be performed with wildcard patterns, not just string literals. This is particularly useful for finding occurrences of a given term within compounds. The query *uddyota~<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=*uddyota~>, for instance, matches terms that end with something close to uddyota, and returns, among else, uddyota, ??ntyuddyota, ?c?roddyota, udyota, etc.

Here is how to input each phoneme:

? a ?   ? ? aa  ? i     ? ? ii  ? u     ? ? uu
? ? r? .r       ? ? r?? .rr     ? ? l? .l       ? ? l?? .ll

? y     ? r     ? l     ? v
? ? z   ? ? .s  ? s     ? h
? ? ? _l

To represent a hiatus, either follow the convention of adding a diaeresis to the second vowel?as in pra?ga?or insert a space character between the two vowels?as in pra uga.

Cross-references

At the top of dictionary entries, immediately after the headword, there is often a list of terms that might be the same as the one you looked for, or that might be related to it, grammatically speaking. For instance, within the entry gandharva, you will find links to the entries gandharbba, gandharva?, gandharvva, gandharvva? and ga?dharva?.

These clusters of terms are generated mechanically through a set of rules, and can thus be inaccurate. Some cases are inherently ambiguous. For instance, a term that ends with -? might either be a stem or the nominative masculine singular of a term that ends with -in. I am experimenting with machine learning to address these issues, but much work remains to be done. The end goal is to make this aggregation process transparent.

As a general rule, when searching for nouns and adjectives, you should input the stem instead of a declined form, and then follow cross-references, if any. If the term you are looking for does not appear as a stem in any of the available dictionaries, you will still probably find it among suggested approximate matches.

Browsing through Terms

It is sometimes useful to browse through terms. You can jump to a given location in the dictionaries lexicon by typing the hash symbol # in the search field, followed by a few characters. While doing so, you will be presented with a list of terms that start with the prefix you typed so far. This autocomplete feature is currently only available for romanized input.

Confirming the query will bring you to the first term that starts with the prefix you typed, or, if there is none, to the closest term that follows it, lexicographically speaking. Try for instance the query #uddh?r<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23uddh%C4%81r>. Submitting the query #<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=%23> just brings you to the very beginning<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit/meta/pages/1> of the lexicon.

Advanced Search

It is possible to find terms that match a pattern by using wildcard characters. The question mark character ? matches a single phoneme; the star character * matches a sequence of zero or more phonemes. Note that matching is performed at the phoneme level, not at the character level. Thus a?i matches abhi, but ab?i does not match it, since bh represents a single phoneme.

It is also possible to find terms through approximate matching?sometimes called ?fuzzy matching.? The metric used for comparing strings is the Levenshtein distance<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>. This matching mode is enabled by appending a tilde ~ at the end of the search string. The query mandra~<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=mandra~>, for instance, returns terms like mandra, ma?dra, madra, mantra, etc.

Approximate matching can be performed with wildcard patterns, not just string literals. This is particularly useful for finding occurrences of a given term within compounds. The query *uddyota~<https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit?q=*uddyota~>, for instance, matches terms that end with something close to uddyota, and returns, among else, uddyota, ??ntyuddyota, ?c?roddyota, udyota, etc.

Dear Indologists,

 

I have noticed some ??uv?rs sing the first verse of the Cuntarar T?v?ram by splitting the word perum??? by splitting it into peru and m???, which does not sound right semantically. Other ?tuv?rs keep the word perum??? whole. When I mentioned it to a musicologist, he offered the following versions of the verse.

 

Tiruppa?ant?l Edition

pitt?pi?ai c???peru m???aru ????

ett?lma?a v?t?ni?aik ki????ma?at tu??ai

vaitt?ype??ait te?p?lve??ai nall?r aru??u?aiyu?

att?u?ak k???yi?i all??e?al ?m?

 

Saiva Siddhanta Edition

pitt?pi?ai c???peru m???yaru ????

ett??ma?a v?t?ni?aik ki????ma?at tu??ai

vaitt?ype??ait te?p?lve??ai nall?raru? ?u?aiyu?

att?vu?ak k???yi?i all??e?a l?m?

 

Prof. E. Angayarkkanni, in her discussion of the first line of the same verse, considers the line to be of 4 c?rs made up of one ?racaicc?r followed by three m?vacaicc?r (cuntarar t?v?rap p??alka?il icai, p. 104), which gives rise to pitt? pi?aic??? perum??? aru????. Although she does not discuss other lines of the verse, we can see the third line of the verse would not fit the pattern of the first line.

 

Is there a ?correct? way of splitting the c?rs? Even if such a way exists what would have been the relationship between that and the actual manner of singing by Cuntarar or his followers?

 

Unfortunately, the Pondicherry T. V. Gopal Iyer edition of the T?v?ram does not give the c?r-based version. Does anyone know if TVG has discussed the prosody of this verse in any of his other publications?

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan

Dear Friends,
The proceedings of a recent (online) Conference on Vedic Philology (2nd and
3rd May 2023) in honour of Prof. G.U. Thite being under preparation, brief
video-clips of the presentations are available on YouTube, as you may have
seen.
My presentation on A. Bergaigne and on J. Gonda (on A. Bergaigne, and his
reception among European scholars, including, notably and perhaps
unexpectedly, J. Gonda) I have slightly edited and enriched with pictures
and selected bibliographic information: this is now available on the vimeo
channel SanskritStudies.

Dear all,

Do any of you happen to have a pdf of Albrecht Weber's 1871 edition of the
Taittir?ya Sa?hit? Books I-IV (Indische Studien vol. 11)? As far as I can
see, archive.org only has the second (1872) volume. I know the Titus
version of the text is Weber's, but I'd ideally like to check the original.

Many thanks,
      Antonia

With many thanks to Guy St. Amant and Herman Tull for the immediate replies
(and pdfs)! Apparently, the volume is available on google books in the US.

All my very best,

Which teaches me to not just search for Taittir?ya Sa?hit?, but also for
Indische Studien... Thank you for the pointer!

Dear Indologists,

Might anyone have access to a soft copy of the Tarkarahasya published in the Tibetan Sanskrit Works Series (Patna 1979)?

Dear Friends,

I'm trying to find the source of this mention of Dommara acrobats. It is
located on p. 234 of this book.
<https://ia904704.us.archive.org/8/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.52850/2015.52850.Studies-In-The-History-Of-The-Third-Dynasty-Of-Vijayanagara_text.pdf>

Here is the mention of acrobats:

"The Dommara acrobatic feats before the regent R?mar?ja are described at
some length in the *R?mar?yanabakhire*."

Here is the footnote: *The Bharati x. p. 753*

I would be most grateful if someone were to help locate this reference.

Thank you.

All the best,

Thanks to those who, off list, sent me a link to the useful transcription of the Tarkarahasya prepared under Birgit Kellner's direction on SARIT. I would still, however, like to locate a pdf of the 1979 Patna edition if one exists.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit as an Indo-European Language
Message-ID: <CAGr5HvTfEiRiVWmG6jOQfRHLrVvDjY6Dsa9YoaeoO-aKREiNRA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,


I like to announce a recently published book of mine:



*Harald Wiese: Sanskrit as an Indo-European Language, Heidelberg:
Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing, 2023. *

978-3-948791-7-66 (Softcover), ISBN 978-3-948791-7-59 (PDF), DOI:
https://doi.org/10.11588/hasp.1238



Content:

Students of Sanskrit can choose among several good textbooks. This book is
not an alternative textbook for learning Sanskrit. Instead, it is to
accompany these textbooks and written in the hope to make Sanskrit learning
easier by explaining words and grammatical forms from an Indo-European
point of view.



The book has been published by Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing (HASP).
It is available by free download from the publisher's website and can also
be bought as a softcover through the usual channels.



Information page in English:

Dear Professor Jain,

In response to your invitation to participate in a webinar with Prof.
Salvatore Babones, I can only politely request that you and your colleagues
at FLAME reconsider your invitation to him to speak.

As you may be aware, Dr. Babones has repeatedly vilified humanities and
social science scholars at large in India, suggesting that those Indian
academics who critique the current government are "anti-national" and
"anti-India." He has also suggested, on numerous occasions, that those of
us that are engaged in the study of South Asia outside of India and who
critique the current regime are similarly "anti-India" in toto. Dr.
Salvatore's rather broad and unconsidered pronouncements in the press, in
social media, and in forums such as the one you propose have demonstrably
encouraged the vilification of Indian academia at large and liberal or
left-leaning Indian academics in particular. His statements have also
generated a palpable and general mistrust of non-Indian scholars among a
segment of the Indian public, without providing any basis for such mistrust.

I am sure you will agree that inviting or not inviting Dr. Babones is not a
matter of academic freedom, freedom of inquiry, or freedom of speech. The
reason for this is that Dr. Babones has publicly demonstrated his
opposition to academic freedom, freedom of inquiry, and freedom of speech
by repeatedly suggesting that any and all critics of the current political
regime are anti-national, treasonous, or neo-colonial agents. As is plain,
such a position can never engage in reasoned and reasonable debate or the
exchange of ideas.

(Colleagues unfamiliar with Dr. Salvatore may refer to his numerous
statements vilifying Indian and foreign academics and the entire "intellectual
class" of India <Dear Professor Jain, In response to your invitation to

(Colleagues unfamiliar with Dr. Salvatore may refer to his numerous

"intellectual class" of India in the Indian media and on Twitter/X.) This
being the case, I am sure you can see why The India Centre's invitatinon to
Dr. Balbones could be, and is indeed being, read as an expression of
FLAME's fealty to the present political dispensation rather than as an
expression of commitment to the exchange of ideas and the sharing of
knowledge. Since the debate around freedom of speech and inquiry has become
so confused, I will repeat: the issue that others and I perceive in the
platforming of Dr. Balbones is that he will use the platform, as he has
many others, to encourage government repression of individual academics and
their institutions, thus creating a material danger to our Indian
colleagues, their careers, and their institutions. I am sure this is not
something that anyone at FLAME would wish to do. In summary, I hope that
you will reconsider inviting Dr. Babones as an honored speaker to FLAME,
not because he is a sychopant to the current regime but because he is
attacking the academic activities and careers of our colleagues, many of
whom are members of this list. Regards, Tyler Williams University of

Respected Scholars,
In the initial Benediction ( Mangalacharan) in Madhusudan Saraswati's AdwaityaSiddhi, ends with the line-
" Mokham Prapt Ib Vishnuvikalp'jit"
While going through the commentary on AdwaityaSiddhi, I came to know that the word"Vishnu" in the benediction signifies "Jiva" and not Lord Vishnu .
If anyone may kindly enlighten me on this point, as to why the word"Vishnu" has been taken as "Jiva",in this context.RegardsAlakendu Das&nbsp;

Subject: Unlock the World of Jain Literature: Introducing JainGPT.org -
Semantic Search
To: Jain eLibrary <contact at jainelibrary.org>


*Announcing JainGPT ? A Semantic search for Jain literature*


*(chatgpt for Jain Literature)*


We are thrilled to unveil our latest achievement: *JainGPT.org*, a website
powered by Semantic search & Machine Learning, dedicated to Jain
literature. Our team member, *Anish Visaria* has been hard at work,
processing an immense collection of over half a million pages of literary
texts. The outcome of these efforts is nothing short of remarkable - a
robust semantic search capability, akin to the incredible ChatGPT by
OpenAI. This feature allows you to delve deep into Jain texts, making it
easier than ever to uncover their true meanings.



Here's how you can experience the magic of JainGPT



1.    *Visit us at JainGPT.org <http://jaingpt.org>*

2.    Simply *type your question* or use the provided examples in the
prompt box.

3.    In no time, you'll receive chat responses that convey the *semantic
meanings* you seek along with source reference.

4.    Click on the *source* page links to access the exact page and book
files on jainelibrary.org



Please note that our system primarily supports *English queries* at the
moment. However, it's now equipped to *extract basic meaning* from Hindi,
Gujarati, and Sanskrit.



But that's not all! We have exciting plans for the future:



   1. *Content Refinement*: We're dedicated to elevating the quality of our
   JaineLibrary OCRed book content. To achieve this, we'll be using
   cutting-edge Language Models like GPT3.5 and Llama 2 to clean and organize
   the material. This refined content will be readily available on JainGPT,
   enhancing accessibility and usability.
   2. *Generative Responses*: We understand the unique challenges posed by
   Jain vocabulary and context limitations. Yet, we're exploring the
   possibility of enabling generative responses using Language Models on
   JainGPT. This, of course, hinges on achieving the required accuracy levels
   and usefulness.



*Few examples* of our search and results it provides?

1.    Why do Jains do paryushan?

?         The purpose of life according to Jain teachings is to realize
oneself, as well as to experience wholeness, peace, compassion, and
reverence for all life. Therefore, the real purpose of Paryushan is to
purify our soul by observing and correcting our own faults, asking for
forgiveness for the mistakes we have committed, and taking vows to minimize
our faults. During Paryushan we should strive to minimize our worldly
affairs so that we can.

?         Paryushan Parva is the most important festival of Jains. During
that eight-day period, many Jains fast and carry out religious activities.
Paryushan Parva falls during the months of August and/or September. The
word Paryushan is derived from two words meaning, 'Resorting to all round
spiritual pursuit', and Parva means celebration. It is a period of
repentance for the acts during the year and of austerities to help shed the
accumulated karmas

2.    Why should you not eat after sunset ?

?         A widely popular Jain practice is to avoid any food after sunset.
People attribute several reasons behind it including the inability to cook
during night as there was no electricity in ancient times. Some reason was
that it was to avoid insects etc. But, Mahapragva says that the true reason
is far more important and scientific: the digestion of food is accelerated
in the presence of sunlight. Our 1cars-sharir gets its energy from the sun.

?         Jains usually try to eat before sunset since many visible and
invisible lives thrive at night and we are in danger of consuming them.
Eating before sunset also allows plenty of time for the digestive system to
function properly.

3.    Explain Anuyog in simple words

?         ANUYOG (Inquiry and Research) Anuyog means exposition,
description, or explanation. In the Jain Shastras there are expositions of
countless subjects. These have been classified into four kinds. Therefore,
there are mainly four kinds of Anuyog.

?         107. Question-What is this, Anuyog? Answer-Anuyog is said to be
of two types-1. Mools Prathamanuyog, and 2. Gandikanuyog.



So basically, we can just type our questions in semantic words and
respective answers with the sources from the books will show up. Hope you
can utilize it to answer your religious, spiritual and Jain cultural
questions.



Our commitment remains steadfast in improving platforms and projects that
promote Jain literature. Your feedback, from the Jain community and beyond,
is invaluable to us as we continue this journey. If you have any questions
or suggestions, please don't hesitate to get in touch on this *feedback

Subject: [INDOLOGY] position of Professor of Cultural and Intellectual
 History of Pre-Modern South Asia,
 University of Vienna -- extension of application period
Message-ID: <e17e2f23158abe474acb94f6eb67f5ec@univie.ac.at>

Dear colleagues,

On July 5, 2023, I had informed you about the advertisement of the above 
position at the University of Vienna.

At the request of one of you, I had also clarified that the currently 
advertised position will continue, in a more broadly conceived form (see 
the text of the advertisement) and under different formal and 
administrative conditions due to the autonomy of the University of 
Vienna (since 2004), the present Chair of Indology from which I will be 
retiring by the end of this month.

The Dean's Office has now extended the application period to September 
30, 2023. I am attaching the revised advertisement in English and 
German.

As mentioned, the position will be one among four professorial positions 
at the Department of South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies in the 
following fields: Cultural and Intellectual History of Pre-Modern South 
Asia, Languages and Cultures of Modern South and Inner Asia (full 
professor, with a focus on Himalayan Studies and Modern South Asia; 
negotiations are underway and we hope that the position will be filled 
in the course of the academic year 2023/2024), Buddhist Studies 
(Christopher Jones; assistant professor -- tenure track position from 
October 1, 2023 onwards); and Tibetan Studies (Jim Rheingans; full 
professor).

For further information on the Department, please refer to our website 
at https://stb.univie.ac.at/. Most of the information is also found on 
https://stb.univie.ac.at/en/.

Most recently, through our new appointees Jim Rheingans and Christopher 
Jones the Department has become a member of the Cluster of Excellence 
"Eurasian Transformations" funded by the FWF and directed by Claudia 
Rapp at the Austrian Academy of Sciences; see 
https://www.oeaw.ac.at/imafo/das-institut/detail/excellencecluster-eurasian-transformations.

Again, I very much encourage all qualified colleagues to apply for the 
position, especially those among you who may have felt disencouraged by 
the maximum "academic profile" formulated by the University in a 
standard way for all professorial advertisements.

As said here before, in my eyes and experience over the last 25 years, 
the Department is a wonderful academic environment with a perfect 
constellation of professorial positions that is opening up the potential 
of numerous synergies in research and teaching. The four positions are 
augmented by a good number of post-doctoral and doctoral positions, 
which will further increase after October 1 this year when the 
implementation of the first half of the comprehensive generational 
change at the Department will be effected step by step. For the current 
list of staff, see https://stb.univie.ac.at/ueber-uns/mitarbeiterinnen/ 
and https://stb.univie.ac.at/en/about-us/staff/.

Please do not hesitate to write to me if you have any questions.

With many thanks for your renewed attention and interest in the 
position,

Karin Preisendanz

update
To: samskrita <samskrita at googlegroups.com>, <
sanskrit-programmers at googlegroups.com>


Namaste,

I use siddhanta font heavily in my work. I found that after a recent
MS-Word update, the Siddhanta font rendering is broken. More specifically,
the ?????????????? are being displayed in their ?????? forms. The Adishila
base font seems fine. But Adishila Dev Guru font also has the same issue.

Please see the screenshot below, each of the three bullet points are
rendered in Siddhanta, Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru fonts respectively.

[image: Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 10.42.28 PM.png]

Could anyone help me if there is a configuration that I may be missing? Or
do you see the same issue ?

I use MS Word (Office-365), on a MAC.

Thanks and Regards,
Viswanath.

Dear list members,

Those of you interested in Classical Tamil poetry may like to know that I have just now posted a new, the 10th, contribution on realia in Old Tamil Ca?kam poetry on my website (go to "Publications" and scroll down to "Realia ..."). It is titled ?The Paka??ai Flower and Fuller?s Earth?. Furthermore I have posted a new version of no. 1, "Muruka? in the Molucca beans" (originally June 2021, new version September 2023).

With kind regards. Herman

Dear colleagues,

I, too, and no doubt many others are having this or similar problems with various Unicode-compliant ttf/ttc and otf Devan?gar? fonts when used in Microsoft Office software.  This is a headache because I have numerous documents using Arial Unicode for the Devan?gar?, and now when I open them in Word, or paste text from them into Outlook, all the conjunct glyphs are decomposed with virama.  (Those fonts still work fine in other softwore, e.g., TextEdit, LibreOffice, etc.)

I have in fact posted to Microsoft discussion board about this, but I have received no useful guidance:
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/microsoft-office-for-mac-has-stopped-displaying/ebd3fba8-edac-42e0-954b-cfcdc58679f8

I have compiled a list of fonts that DO still work for me in Word (and display properly in Outlook):

Baloo
Devanagari Sangam
Gotu
ITF Devanagari
Kohinoor Devanagari
Lava Devanagari
Mukta
Noto Sans Devanagari
October Devanagari
Sama Devanagari
Shobhika Devanagari
Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit (or Hindi)

The list of fonts that no longer work for me include such common ones as Arial Unicode MS and Sanskrit 2003/2020, along with several others.

Best,
Tim

Namaste,

I use siddhanta font heavily in my work. I found that after a recent MS-Word update, the Siddhanta font rendering is broken. More specifically, the ?????????????? are being displayed in their ?????? forms. The Adishila base font seems fine. But Adishila Dev Guru font also has the same issue.

Please see the screenshot below, each of the three bullet points are rendered in Siddhanta, Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru fonts respectively.

[cid:image001.png at 01D9E981.4E069ED0]

Could anyone help me if there is a configuration that I may be missing? Or do you see the same issue ?

I use MS Word (Office-365), on a MAC.

Thanks and Regards,
Viswanath.

I can have a look and/or escalate, can anyone send me or point to a pair of fonts that does and doesn?t work, such as the Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru, and possibly the version of Word where it no longer works?

Dear Jan,

In my first message (in the chain below) I listed fonts that DO function properly in Microsoft Word, Outlook, etc.  They are all ttf, ttc, or otf fonts.
I am using Office for Mac 16.77, running OS Big Sur 11.7.1, and others on the message board I linked to are having the same problem running OS 12 (Monterey).  I have not noticed similar problems with other Indic fonts, but I have not yet had occasion to test them.
The fonts that I have found NOT to work only in Microsoft programs on Mac are:

AA_Nagari_Shree_L3
Arial Unicode MS
Devanagari MT (partial fail)
Kalimati
Sanskrit 2003
Sanskrit 2020
Shree Devanagari

This thread on the list began by noting that Siddhanta and Adishila fonts also malfunction in Word on Mac.
None of these, I think, are PostScript fonts, which have been deprecated.  Arial Unicode MS is no longer (as of very recently) being maintained, but it certainly should still be functional.

Best,
Tim

I can have a look and/or escalate, can anyone send me or point to a pair of fonts that does and doesn?t work, such as the Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru, and possibly the version of Word where it no longer works?

Dear colleagues,

I, too, and no doubt many others are having this or similar problems with various Unicode-compliant ttf/ttc and otf Devan?gar? fonts when used in Microsoft Office software.  This is a headache because I have numerous documents using Arial Unicode for the Devan?gar?, and now when I open them in Word, or paste text from them into Outlook, all the conjunct glyphs are decomposed with virama.  (Those fonts still work fine in other softwore, e.g., TextEdit, LibreOffice, etc.)

I have in fact posted to Microsoft discussion board about this, but I have received no useful guidance:
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/microsoft-office-for-mac-has-stopped-displaying/ebd3fba8-edac-42e0-954b-cfcdc58679f8

I have compiled a list of fonts that DO still work for me in Word (and display properly in Outlook):

Baloo
Devanagari Sangam MN
Gotu
ITF Devanagari
Kohinoor Devanagari
Lava Devanagari
Mukta
Noto Sans Devanagari
October Devanagari
Sama Devanagari
Shobhika Devanagari
Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit (or Hindi)

The list of fonts that no longer work for me include such common ones as Arial Unicode MS and Sanskrit 2003/2020, along with several others.

Namaste,

I use siddhanta font heavily in my work. I found that after a recent MS-Word update, the Siddhanta font rendering is broken. More specifically, the ?????????????? are being displayed in their ?????? forms. The Adishila base font seems fine. But Adishila Dev Guru font also has the same issue.

Please see the screenshot below, each of the three bullet points are rendered in Siddhanta, Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru fonts respectively.

[cid:image001.png at 01D9E9AA.94B9FFB0]

Could anyone help me if there is a configuration that I may be missing? Or do you see the same issue ?

I use MS Word (Office-365), on a MAC.

Thanks and Regards,
Viswanath.

Dear Tim,

I did see your message, I was hoping my enquiry would yield me an actual font file, not only list of font names without version. I am not doubting your claims and I don?t think it has anything to do with PostScript.

It would be also helpful to know whether the same problem now occurs in Word/Outlook app on Android and/or iPhone.

Thanks,
Jan

Namaste,

I use siddhanta font heavily in my work. I found that after a recent MS-Word update, the Siddhanta font rendering is broken. More specifically, the ?????????????? are being displayed in their ?????? forms. The Adishila base font seems fine. But Adishila Dev Guru font also has the same issue.

Please see the screenshot below, each of the three bullet points are rendered in Siddhanta, Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru fonts respectively.

Could anyone help me if there is a configuration that I may be missing? Or do you see the same issue ?

I use MS Word (Office-365), on a MAC.

Thank you,

I have now received a few files from Tim. I am trying to establish whether it?s Apple or Microsoft at fault here.

Historically there are two Indic layout systems that OpenType supports, with the second version, which everyone should be using now, introduced 15 years ago in 2008. Fonts can contain data for both at the same time. The fonts I received confirmed my suspicion that it?s the fonts that only support the first version and not the second that stopped working (i.e. they contain deva script tag but not dev2). That feels like a deliberate decision to drop support for the old Indic shaping and if I had to guess I would start with macOS here.
Let me see if I can find out more.

Thanks,
Jan

Can I request you to kindly update the following as well on the thread ?

- The Word rendering is broken for "Siddhanta" font in addition to
"Adishila Dev Guru".  Word version 16.76.1, Mac Os Ventura 13.5.2

- I don't see this problem with Libre Office on MAC. Libre Office 7.6.1

- I also don't see this problem with Pages App (from Apple, Word
equivalent).

- This rendering is broken after a Word update recently and not on an Apple
update.

It appears to me that Word's renderer has broken this font, either by
design or by a bug, since I don't see this issue on other similar products
on the same Mac.

Thanks
Viswanath

Very sad news, indeed,
I had a very pleasant (last) exchange with him last summer, concerning an archive photography here found, on which picture Bruno Dagens is seen behind Etienne Lamotte, in the garden of the latter's property when Lamotte was celebrating his emeritus with a few colleagues, on the 8th of October 1974 ? Bruno Dagens was in charge of the Sanskrit course in Louvain for a few years after Lamotte's retirement.
[cid:3BDA462C-A44E-427C-BFE1-204DF2506E69]
He came back to Louvain(-la-Neuve then) as member of the jury of my habilitation degree in 2007.
Among his last works, there is a nice portrait of the late Jacques Dumar?ay, his friend, issued in the BEFEO 107, 2021, pp. 11-45, and the Trait? de l'habitat: Le Mayamata: Morceau choisis, introduits, comment?s et traduits du sanskrit, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, s?rie indienne, 2022.

Dear all,

Just an update ? Apple did not change behaviour here (noting nevertheless that Indic 1 shaping is deprecated). Microsoft made some changes in Office, resulting inadvertently in the fonts using old shaping to not work. This is now being investigated and I believe it will be fixed in the future. I will post another update once that happens.

Thank you for reaching out,
Jan

Microsoft made some changes in Office, resulting inadvertently in the fonts using old shaping to not work. This is now being investigated and I believe it will be fixed in the future. I will post another update once that happens.

Thank you for reaching out,
Jan

From Bandaru Vishwanath

From that thread on the forum,

Historically there are two Indic layout systems that OpenType supports, with the second version, which everyone should be using now, introduced 15 years ago in 2008. Fonts can contain data for both at the same time. The fonts I received confirmed my suspicion that it?s the fonts that only support the first version and not the second that stopped working (i.e. they contain deva script tag but not dev2). That feels like a deliberate decision to drop support for the old Indic shaping and if I had to guess I would start with macOS here.

Can I request you to kindly update the following as well on the thread ?

- The Word rendering is broken for "Siddhanta" font in addition to "Adishila Dev Guru".  Word version 16.76.1, Mac Os Ventura 13.5.2

- I don't see this problem with Libre Office on MAC. Libre Office 7.6.1

- I also don't see this problem with Pages App (from Apple, Word equivalent).

- This rendering is broken after a Word update recently and not on an Apple update.

It appears to me that Word's renderer has broken this font, either by design or by a bug, since I don't see this issue on other similar products on the same Mac.

Thanks
Viswanath

*The Credibility of Stories: Judiciousness and Coherence in a Jaina
Narrative from 10th-11th century*


>From the early centuries of the common era, Jaina authors composed their
own versions of stories that appear in sources such as the *R?m?ya?a*,
*Mah?bh?rata*, and *pur??a*s. These authors self-consciously present
themselves as correcting preceding narratives that they do not accept as
credible. But what makes one version more credible than another? And how
should a reader adjudicate between the two? In this talk, Itamar Ramot
argues that the two earliest available retellings of a Jaina narrative
called the *Dharmapar?k??*? in Apabhra??a (988) and Sanskrit (1014)?address
these questions through a complex set of arguments. First, these retellings
establish coherence as a fundamental criterion for considering the
credibility of a story. Second, by repeatedly pointing out the
incoherencies of stories, they train their readers on how to be judicious
with regard to the credibility of stories that they encounter. As such, the
*Dharmapar?k??*s offer a reflection on the motivation of premodern South
Asian authors to retell already-existing narratives and on the reading
practices they expect of their reader.

*Itamar Ramot* is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of South Asian
Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago. He is interested
in the intersection of literature and religion and specifically in the
application of literature to questions of religious authority. In his
research, he explores the mechanism by which medieval Jain thinkers used
narrative literature to establish criteria about which stories should be
considered credible and to train their readers on how to adjudicate the
authority of the stories they encounter.

Prof. Vasantkumar Bhatt sent the following message :

Respected Scholars,
Namaste  !
Today my Sanskrit drama on Lord Buddha's life  -????????-??????????  -is
published by the Central Sanskrit University,  Delhi.
Perhaps it is the first Sanskrit drama, which is thoroughly based on
Tripitakas and Jataka-kathas.
( in 5 acts, with Shanta as main Rasa and Haasya, Adbhut as supporting
Rasas. ), + one can find all five "???????????, ???? ??????, ???? ?????? -
as suggested  by Bharat Muni. )
Regards,
Vasantkumar M Bhatt
Ahmedabad

----------------------------------------

earlier he brought out

Abijnaanashaakuntala naatakasya pancharangaavrittayaH

His older message was

Respected Scholars,
Namaste  !

I am glad to announce the new publication of my book:- ????????????????
??????? ???????????????? ?? The book contains 42 Acts of the drama ! It is
published by the Central Sanskrit University, Delhi, in August, 2020.

(1) One may find here the basic (=Act 1 to 7 ) texts of all five ( the
Kashmiri, Maithili,  Bengali, Dakshinatya and Devnagari ) recensions of the
drama.

(2) For the first time I have ventured to give a reconstructed text of the
full drama, ( with required arguments in Sanskrit , in footnotes ) which is
prepared after thorough investigation of all available variants,
interpolations & abridgement in traditional manuscripts.

(3) One can find a detailed comparative study of the texts of all five
recensions of the drama.

(4) After examining / locating the real cause of creating voluminous
variants & interpolations, I have concluded that all five ( so-called)
recensions are nothing but " Stage Versions of the Drama " ! So the title
of the book is  - ????????????????  ??
(5) At the end of the volume,  there are various (six) appendices of unique
importance.

Hope that the scholarly world will give the critical comments on the same
after the reading.

Dear List members,

Earlier I posted a request for a pdf of an article by Bansidhar Bhatt ("?c?ra-C?l?s and -Niryukti. Studies II, Mah?v?ra-biography") published in Kenji Watanabe and Rudy Smet, Jain Studies in Honour of Josef Deleu. I have received no reactions yet. In the meantime I discovered I need yet another article from the same Festschrift, namely "Notes on the Bh?van?". So I decided I can just as well try to buy a copy the book, which is not in our university library. I have however no experience with buying a book in Japan. I hope there is someone on the list who can advise my where and how to order the book.

With kind regards, Herman

Dear List members,

This afternoon I received pdfs of the two articles from Deleu's Festschrift from Jayandra Soni. On the suggestion of Antonio Ferreira-Jardim I have sent an email to a bookshop in Tokyo (info at books-taizando.com), which might be able to find a copy of the book. If they do, I will ask the library to buy the book; they should have it.

I like to thank those who have mailed me, most of them offlist, with information and suggestions.

Helmut Krasser, despite tragically passing away much too early in 2014, left his mark on more than one generation of scholars of Indian and Buddhist philosophy. An eminent specialist on the so-called ?logico-epistemological tradition,? he devoted his Viennese dissertation and early work to the Buddhist philosopher Dharmottara, before broadening the scope of his research to Dign?ga and Dharmak?rti, the tradition?s historical founders. In particular, he examined their ideas on the relationship between logic and soteriology. He also considered the very nature of their texts. Should they be understood as authored philosophical works? Or rather as edited lecture notes of students? Director from 2007 to 2014 of the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Helmut Krasser left behind a multi-faceted body of work, including editions of ancient Sanskrit manuscripts today found in the Tibetan Autonomous Region that had never before been published. This commemorative volume with more than thirty contributions not only reflects the multiplicity of his interests, it is also evidence of the deep impression he left on all those who met him. It is a document to the faithful friendship and highest respect still held by his friends and colleagues almost ten years after his death.

CALL FOR APPLICATIONS: SoFCB JUNIOR FELLOWS PROGRAM



Rare Book School?s Andrew W. Mellon Society of Fellows in Critical Bibliography (SoFCB) invites applications for its 2024?26 cohort of Junior Fellows. The deadline is Friday, 17 November 2023.



This scholarly society works to advance the study of texts, images, and artifacts as material objects through capacious, interdisciplinary scholarship?and to enrich humanistic inquiry and education by identifying, mentoring, and training promising early-career scholars. Junior Fellows will be encouraged and supported in integrating the methods of critical bibliography into their teaching and research, fostering collegial conversations about historical and emerging media across disciplines and institutions, and sharing their knowledge with broader publics.



The fellowship includes tuition waivers for two Rare Book School courses, as well as funding for Junior Fellows to participate in the Society?s annual meeting and orientation. Additional funds are available for fellows to organize symposia at their home institutions, and fellows will have the option of attending a bibliographical field school to visit libraries, archives, and collections in a major metropolitan area. After completing two years in good standing as Junior Fellows, program participants will have the option to become Senior Fellows in the Society.



The Society is committed to supporting diversity and to advancing the scholarship of outstanding persons of every race, gender, sexual orientation, creed, and socioeconomic background, and to enhancing the diversity of the professions and academic disciplines it represents, including those of the professoriate, museums, libraries, archives, public humanities, and digital humanities. We warmly encourage prospective applicants from a wide range of disciplines, institutions, and areas of expertise.

About the book:

Through an analysis ofarchaeological and literary data, this book explores two interrelated themes:the socio-economic and cultic processes that resulted in the decline of IndianBuddhism in its last strongholds ? Bihar and Bengal ? towards the end of theearly medieval period, and the patterns of revival of Buddhism in theneighbouring province of Uttar Pradesh, c. 2005-2011 CE. These themes have beenexplored by undertaking an analysis of the developments?in the social histories of other competing religions: Hinduism, Jainism and ?j?vika-dharma. By placing emphasis on the religious praxis and behaviour of the non-elite segment of population, this book offers some significant ?from below? perspectives on the social histories of Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and ?j?vika-dharma in eastern and northern India.

Maybe a temporary problem?

My access to academia seems to be operating normally.

*Description*
This book details the developmental history of narratives that affirm,
condemn, modify, or ignore the controversial execution of ?amb?ka, a minor
R?m?ya?a character of low social standing. Changing socio-political
sentiments throughout Indian history have forced numerous revisions to the
?amb?ka story, placing it in an underappreciated position of influence.

*Contents*
Foreword (by Paula Richman): S?ambu?ka?s Story across Time and India?s
Regions
1. Introduction: S?ambu?ka?s Death Toll
2. S?ambu?ka?s Earliest Death
3. First Responders
4. The Uttarara?macarita and S?ambu?ka?s Purpose in Death
5. The Accident or the Execution
6. S?ambu?ka Lives on Ramtek Hill
7. The Anti-Caste Revolutionary
8. S?ambu?ka in the Twenty-First Century
9. Conclusion: S?ambu?ka and the Ra?ma?yan?a Tradition

With best wishes,
Aaron

Dear list members,

on behalf of the project?s investigators, I am sharing here the .pdf of a call for applications for a position of research assistant (??Assegno per lo svolgimento di attivita? di ricerca??) in the framework of the PRIN2022 project ? The Wheel of Time: An Inquiry into New Sources of Late Indian Buddhism (X-XIII cents.) ?. I am told that, while the project is based at the University of Naples ? L?Orientale ? and the University of Florence, there is no obligation for the hired scholar to be based in Italy.

Kind regards,

Andrea

Subject: [INDOLOGY] gurus and media open access book
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrB2eGS01Q9tKc8_dydpoGvboOQHqyO18Ye=QtOeCMg2Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Some of you might be interested in this new book on 'gurus and media' (UCL
Press).
It is open access for a pdf.

https://www.uclpress.co.uk/products/227242

Here is the summary:

*Gurus and Media* is the first book dedicated to media and mediation in
domains of public guruship and devotion. Illuminating the mediatisation of
guruship and the guru-isation of media, it bridges the gap between
scholarship on gurus and the disciplines of media and visual culture
studies. It investigates guru iconographies in and across various time
periods and also the distinctive ways in which diverse gurus engage with
and inhabit different forms of media: statuary, games, print publications,
photographs, portraiture, films, machines, social media, bodies, words,
graffiti, dolls, sound, verse, tombs and more.

The book?s interdisciplinary chapters advance, both conceptually and
ethnographically, our understanding of the function of media in the
dramatic production of guruship, and reflect on the corporate branding of
gurus and on mediated guruship as a series of aesthetic traps for the
captivation of devotees and others. They show how different media can
further enliven the complex plurality of guruship, for instance in
instantiating notions of ?absent-present? guruship and demonstrating the
mutual mediation of gurus, caste and Hindutva.

Throughout, the book foregrounds contested visions of the guru in the
development of devotional publics and pluriform guruship across time and
space. Thinking through the guru?s many media entanglements in a single
place, the book contributes new insights to the study of South Asian
religions and to the study of mediation more broadly.
All the best,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Post Vedic revealed literature
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_yQR3GScYT1PHQ6VEwaTgnZXdcx4F9c1=-c4JYZEXbqg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I've wondered for a long time how is the appearance of anonymous post vedic
revealed literature explained within the traditions.

By that I mean.for example with the tantric literature.  We have tantric
texts that are dialogues between a god and his goddess usually starting
with some statement like: "The God said" or "The goddess asked" etc.  and
my understanding is that  tantric  texts like this have been appearing for
over a thousand years.

 Of course we explain them simply that such and such a text was written by
a person or persons unknown at around such and such a date. But how do the
traditions themselves explain this.  I.e all of a sudden a written text
that was unknown before with the words of a god  written down usually
beginnning with some statement like:*?r?devyuv?ca or ??vara uv?ca* suddenly
appeared in our world. And this happened with all this kind
of revealed literature.. Do any of the texts ever say anything aboutt how
and why the text will be revealed in the world of men  or do the
commentators ever say how the text came to be known in the world of men..

Thanks,
Harry Spier
