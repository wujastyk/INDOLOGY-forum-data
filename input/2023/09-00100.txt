[INDOLOGY] festschrift Josef Deleu
Dear List members,
This afternoon I received pdfs of the two articles from Deleu's Festschrift from Jayandra Soni. On the suggestion of Antonio Ferreira-Jardim I have sent an email to a bookshop in Tokyo (info at books-taizando.com), which might be able to find a copy of the book. If they do, I will ask the library to buy the book; they should have it.
I like to thank those who have mailed me, most of them offlist, with information and suggestions.
Best, Herman
