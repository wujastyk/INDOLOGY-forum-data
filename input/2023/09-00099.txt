[INDOLOGY] how to buy a book in Japan?
Dear List members,
Earlier I posted a request for a pdf of an article by Bansidhar Bhatt ("?c?ra-C?l?s and -Niryukti. Studies II, Mah?v?ra-biography") published in Kenji Watanabe and Rudy Smet, Jain Studies in Honour of Josef Deleu. I have received no reactions yet. In the meantime I discovered I need yet another article from the same Festschrift, namely "Notes on the Bh?van?". So I decided I can just as well try to buy a copy the book, which is not in our university library. I have however no experience with buying a book in Japan. I hope there is someone on the list who can advise my where and how to order the book.
With kind regards, Herman
