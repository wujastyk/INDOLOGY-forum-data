Dear list members,
Those of you interested in Classical Tamil poetry may like to know that I have just now posted a new, the 10th, contribution on realia in Old Tamil Ca?kam poetry on my website (go to "Publications" and scroll down to "Realia ..."). It is titled ?The Paka??ai Flower and Fuller?s Earth?. Furthermore I have posted a new version of no. 1, "Muruka? in the Molucca beans" (originally June 2021, new version September 2023).
With kind regards. Herman
