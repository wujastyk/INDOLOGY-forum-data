Here is the summary:
*Gurus and Media* is the first book dedicated to media and mediation in
domains of public guruship and devotion. Illuminating the mediatisation of
guruship and the guru-isation of media, it bridges the gap between
scholarship on gurus and the disciplines of media and visual culture
studies. It investigates guru iconographies in and across various time
periods and also the distinctive ways in which diverse gurus engage with
and inhabit different forms of media: statuary, games, print publications,
photographs, portraiture, films, machines, social media, bodies, words,
graffiti, dolls, sound, verse, tombs and more.
The book?s interdisciplinary chapters advance, both conceptually and
ethnographically, our understanding of the function of media in the
dramatic production of guruship, and reflect on the corporate branding of
gurus and on mediated guruship as a series of aesthetic traps for the
captivation of devotees and others. They show how different media can
further enliven the complex plurality of guruship, for instance in
instantiating notions of ?absent-present? guruship and demonstrating the
mutual mediation of gurus, caste and Hindutva.
Throughout, the book foregrounds contested visions of the guru in the
development of devotional publics and pluriform guruship across time and
space. Thinking through the guru?s many media entanglements in a single
place, the book contributes new insights to the study of South Asian
religions and to the study of mediation more broadly.
All the best,
