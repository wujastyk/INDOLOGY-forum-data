This symposium is part of our Book Cultures of South Asia<https://www.book-cultures.com/> collaboration that we founded in 2019 at the annual meeting of the Andrew W. Mellon Society of Fellows in Critical Bibliography, Rare Book School, University of Virginia. We have since been building a network of scholars whose research makes valuable contributions to subdisciplines like the history of the book, critical bibliography and the study of material cultures from the vantage point of South Asian history and religions. As we continue to promote the study of material, textual and visual cultures in the field of South Asian Studies, we hope to benefit from your thoughtful engagement, support and encouragement.
Sincerely,
Megan Eaton Robb and Pranav Prakash
