[INDOLOGY] the sign/sound nexus in Indic scripts
Hi Arlo,
It?s an interesting problem and Tibetan, Burmese, Thai and Cambodian all present analogous issues as well. There are no doubt other cases, perhaps Lao, Cham, etc. I would be interested to learn of serious comparative work on the question. Perhaps a topic for a workshop ?
best,
Matthew
