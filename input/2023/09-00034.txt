Dear list members if anyone has  keys (or has personally made these keys)  to the exercises for  Devav???prave?ik? by Sally and Robert Goldman or  to the Sanskrit  Manual for High Schools by R. Antoine and is willing to share these offlist I would appreciate it.  This is for my own use and would not be made public or shared with any possible students..
