I can have a look and/or escalate, can anyone send me or point to a pair of fonts that does and doesn?t work, such as the Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru, and possibly the version of Word where it no longer works?
Thanks,

Dear colleagues,
I, too, and no doubt many others are having this or similar problems with various Unicode-compliant ttf/ttc and otf Devan?gar? fonts when used in Microsoft Office software.  This is a headache because I have numerous documents using Arial Unicode for the Devan?gar?, and now when I open them in Word, or paste text from them into Outlook, all the conjunct glyphs are decomposed with virama.  (Those fonts still work fine in other softwore, e.g., TextEdit, LibreOffice, etc.)
I have in fact posted to Microsoft discussion board about this, but I have received no useful guidance:
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/microsoft-office-for-mac-has-stopped-displaying/ebd3fba8-edac-42e0-954b-cfcdc58679f8
I have compiled a list of fonts that DO still work for me in Word (and display properly in Outlook):
Baloo
Devanagari Sangam
Gotu
ITF Devanagari
Kohinoor Devanagari
Lava Devanagari
Mukta
Noto Sans Devanagari
October Devanagari
Sama Devanagari
Shobhika Devanagari
Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit (or Hindi)
The list of fonts that no longer work for me include such common ones as Arial Unicode MS and Sanskrit 2003/2020, along with several others.
Best,

[Samskrita] Siddhanta font rendering in Word broken after recent update
Namaste,
I use siddhanta font heavily in my work. I found that after a recent MS-Word update, the Siddhanta font rendering is broken. More specifically, the ?????????????? are being displayed in their ?????? forms. The Adishila base font seems fine. But Adishila Dev Guru font also has the same issue.
Please see the screenshot below, each of the three bullet points are rendered in Siddhanta, Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru fonts respectively.

Could anyone help me if there is a configuration that I may be missing? Or do you see the same issue ?
I use MS Word (Office-365), on a MAC.
Thanks and Regards,
Viswanath.
