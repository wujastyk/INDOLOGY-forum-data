Dear Victor,
This is not really an answer, but we have viyogin? listed in our table of prosodic patterns for the DHARMA project.
Please look here: <https://erc-dharma.github.io/output-prosody/display-prosody.html>.
The definition and list of references we cite are:
sa-sa-ja-ga/sa-bha-ra-la-ga???
Apte 1890, Appendix A: Sanskrit Prosody, page 11, ? I.B.4.
Velankar 1949.
Zoetmulder 1974.
I have just completed the Zoetmulder reference in the source file but the html still needs to be updated. We still have to complete the Velankar reference.
On p. 470, Zoetmulder 1974 (Kalangwan: A survey of Old Javanese literature) cites a few occurrences from the 9th-c. Kakavin R?m?ya?a and associates the name Prabodhit? with this meter. I haven't attempted to track down his source for this name.
Best,
Arlo

[INDOLOGY] The viyogin? metre
Dear all,
Does someone know the source of Mallin?tha's definition of viyogin? ad Kum?rasambhava 4.1: vi?ame sasaj? guru? same sabhar? lo 'tha gurur viyogin? ? In the appendix to Velankar's  Jayad?man, only the Mand?ramarandacamp? is listed as having a metre named viyogin?. Others define the metre as Vait?l?ya (e.g., Vallabhadeva) and Velankar has a note on this as well. I checked a couple of other works but have not been able to find Mallin?tha's/Apte's definition. Thanks!
All the Best,
Victor
