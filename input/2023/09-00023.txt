Dear Micha?l Meyer
I am pretty sure that I speak for a great many colleagues when I say THANK
YOU and it is an absolutely wonderful resource! The fuzziness of the search
is also great for (among other things) those of us who read things which
sometimes have nonstandard spellings and the like.
So, in short: your labor of love is accepted and used with great
appreciation!!
