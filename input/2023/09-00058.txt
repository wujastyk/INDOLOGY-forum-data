[Samskrita] Siddhanta font rendering in Word broken after recent
update
sanskrit-programmers at googlegroups.com>
Namaste,
I use siddhanta font heavily in my work. I found that after a recent
MS-Word update, the Siddhanta font rendering is broken. More specifically,
the ?????????????? are being displayed in their ?????? forms. The Adishila
base font seems fine. But Adishila Dev Guru font also has the same issue.
Please see the screenshot below, each of the three bullet points are
rendered in Siddhanta, Adishila and Adishila Dev Guru fonts respectively.

Could anyone help me if there is a configuration that I may be missing? Or
do you see the same issue ?
I use MS Word (Office-365), on a MAC.
Thanks and Regards,
Viswanath.
