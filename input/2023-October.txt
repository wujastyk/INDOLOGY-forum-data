Dear Harry,

Although the focus here is on Buddhism, in and beyond India, some of the talks in this series speak directly to the question you raise.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] PhD Scholarships,
 Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies at LMU Munich (reminder)
Message-ID: <FC34BC0B-1FB7-467E-B7B0-52526F05FC41@lmu.de>

Dear Colleagues, 

Allow me to share with you the reminder of the open call for applications for PhD scholarships offered by the LMU Doctoral Programme in Buddhist Studies, circulated a couple of days back on H-Buddhism by Simone Heidegger. 

The Institute for Indology and Tibetology plays an important role in this cross-faculty interdisciplinary doctoral programme. Since it already possesses quite a few scholars whose expertise cover a broad variety of topics, and in view of the fact that its current rebooting is bringing new colleagues and approaches into the picture, we hope that we can perhaps attract the attention of Indological (and of course Tibetological) students looking for a graduate programme. 

I would therefore be very grateful if you could encourage suitable candidates to apply.

Best wishes, 

Vincent T.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Subscription woes
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdbY11mejaqKFeoAvacQhi7B0gB1duWe1iCSEuBibhsRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

Our INDOLOGY subscription system has been badly spammed over the last week
or two. We are seeing many hundreds of false bot-generated subscription
requests.

After discussion, the committee has decided to change the method of
subscription, at least until we have some spam protection.

For now, at least, new members are asked simply to send their CV to the
INDOLOGY committee:

   - https://indology.info/subscribing-to-the-forum/

That's all.  The committee will handle the rest manually.

The online documentation has been altered accordingly.

If you know of anyone who has subscribed in the last couple of weeks and
heard nothing back from us, please ask them to visit the URL above and
start again. Their genuine request has probably been lost in the maelstrom
of spam.

Best wishes,

Dominik Wujastyk

Dear colleagues,

diplomatic and critical editions of the sixth chapter of 
Jinendrabuddhi's Pram??asamuccaya??k? by Motoi Ono, Yasutaka Muroya and 
Toshikazu Watanabe were just published in the series Sanskrit Texts from 
the Tibetan Autonomous Region (Austrian Academy of Sciences Press/China 
Tibetology Publishing House). This chapter deals with j?ti, sometimes 
rendered as "futile rejoinder", a category in discussions of learned 
debate prior to Dign?ga. Jinendrabuddhi's text offers insights into how 
this category was dealt with from the viewpoint of a logical theory that 
formed part of an overarching epistemological, not dialectical, 
framework and contains valuable materials for a better grounded and more 
precise understanding of the historical development of Indian logic at 
large and Buddhist logic in particular.

The volume was published in open access, supported by the Austrian 
Science Fund FWF. Visit 
https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/produkt/jinendrabuddhi-s-vi-l-malavat-pram-asamuccaya-k/99200813?name=jinendrabuddhi-s-vi-l-malavat-pram-asamuccaya-k&product_form=4955

Respected Scholars,
In the initial Benediction ( Mangalacharan) in Madhusudan Saraswati's AdwaityaSiddhi, ends with the line-
" Mokham Prapt Ib Vishnuvikalp'jit"
While going through the commentary on AdwaityaSiddhi, I came to know that the word"Vishnu" in the benediction signifies "Jiva" and not Lord Vishnu .
If anyone may kindly enlighten me on this point, as to why the word"Vishnu" has been taken as "Jiva",in this context.RegardsAlakendu Das&nbsp;

Dear Collegues,
I am so sorry to pass along the sad news: Werner Knobl, a scholar of Vedic
language, texts, and culture, passed away on September 28, 2023.
He will be greatly missed by many.
Below I am forwarding Werner's orbituary written by Nat?lija Buri?ina who
is not a member of the list.
NY

---------------------------

Dear All,

 On behalf of Dr. Werner Knobl?s students, I have very sad news to
announce? Our Beloved Teacher, Werner, the Master of Vedic lore whose ocean
of knowledge was enormous and absolutely unique in its own way, passed away
last Thursday, on 28th September. There are no words to express how much I
am already missing our Great Teacher, our classes, discussions, and our
Little Vedic Sanskrit Lovers community.

Let me briefly sketch our first encounter and further collaboration.
Alongside with other Vedic Sanskrit learners, I joined the Leiden Summer
School in Languages and Linguistics in 2022, where we spent two beautiful
and saturated weeks studying fragments from the ?gveda and Br?hma?as. Thus,
when the Summer School was nearing to the end some of us expressed a wish
to continue our studies online. After that Werner discussed it with the
Director, Sasha Lubotsky to receive his approval, which was then generously
granted.

And so, until the next Summer School in Leiden we were lucky to meet online
10 times during the autumn-winter of 2022, and the same in the spring of
2023. Our group was formed of former and current Werner?s students, who
joined the classes from different corners of the world. Werner always
welcomed questions either sent to him by email, or asked during the class.
He was happy to give elaborate answers to any difficult questions, and did
not hesitate to discuss and oppose the opinions of other scholars, and even
His teacher, the late Paul Thieme, whom he frequently recalled with great
veneration, however, He always did so with great respect. Moreover, He
continuously encouraged us to have our own analyses and never missed to add
the phrase: ?You are not obliged to trust me,? or else ?If you want to
accept this argument [?]?. I dare to say that most of us were impatiently
looking forward to our weekly online sessions that allowed us not only to
get immersed in the realm of Vedic mythopoetics that dates back for more
than 3000 years, but also to look at the aspects of Historical Linguistics,
intricate Grammar matters, Vedic intonation, philology, translation
problems of some difficult passages, etc.

I was lucky to meet Our Great Teacher, Werner, again in Leiden during the
closing party of the Summer School.

This was my second and last encounter in life with our Beloved Teacher and
his companion Carole with whom we had a wonderful conversation about our
passion for Vedic Sanskrit, about how she met Werner in Japan and many more?


I am immensely grateful to Our Beloved Teacher for all the knowledge He
shared with us, for allowing us to discern all the subtleties of the Vedic
poetry through His lens; for His kindness and all the support that every
aspiring student and scholar needs so much at the initial stages. I still
keep on receiving messages expressing gratitude for His kindness from
scholars and students whom He had supported with both critique and advice?

For all of this, I am ineffably grateful to You, our Beloved Teacher, and
as such You will always remain in my memories. I am somehow certain that
our souls will meet again, somewhere in *svargaloka*?

R.I.P.

I am very sorry to hear about the passing of Werner Knobl. He was less than a year my junior, and we became friends during my one-year stay in Kyoto in 1999. I met him also later, at the World Sanskrit conference in Helsinki in 2003, and during my stay in Kyoto in 2006. Werner remembered having seen me in T?bingen around 1970, when Dieter D?tting of the Max Planck Institute invited me to give a lecture on the Indus script ? I remembered only meeting Werner?s teacher Paul Thieme. Werner told me that he revered Thieme so much that he was unable to publish anything as long as Thieme was alive, for the fear bthat it would not meet Thieme?s standard. I give below details of his life not found in Natiliya?s obituary. His surname Knobl comes from the German word Knobel.

Knobl, Werner Franz (born in Eger, Bohemia [now Cheb in Czech Republic] 12 Sept 1942 - died 28 Sept 2023). Johannes-Gutenberg-Gymnasium, Wiesbaden, 1953-1962. Studied Philosophy, Theology, Indology, Arabistik and Linguistics at Frankfurt (1962-1964), Paris (1964-1965), Mainz (1965-1966) and T?bingen (1966-1980). Wrote an Indological Dissertation in 1980 (Promotor: Paul Thieme) which remained undefended. Went to Japan in Sept 1980. Taught Vedic and Classical Sanskrit as full-time "Foreign Lecturer" at Kanazawa (1981-1991) and Kyoto (1991-2006); as part-time teacher at Fukui (1980-1984), Hiroshima (1989-2001), Otani (2006-2009) and Kyoto (2006-2009). Vedic classes at the Leiden Summer School (from 2008 to 2023). Held an intensive course in "Vedic grammar and syntax" inclusive of reading Vedic hymns and prose (in German) at the University of Halle, Germany, on 14-25 Sept 2009. Ph. D., Leiden University, 30 Sept 2009 (Promotor: Alexander Lubotsky). Married to Chizuko Suzuki, three children (and, in 2010, one grandson). Home address: 9-4 Shibuse-cho, Kitashirakawa, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto-606-8283 Japan.

I just want here to add one thing: Werner was an incredibly gentle
person, both in the way he spoke and the way he acted, but also at the
same time with more than a bit of a sense of humor. I met him first in
Kyoto around 1990, where I attended his Sanskrit course, as well as
German (! We read in Windische's Geschichte der Sanskrit-Philologie).
Among all the many memories (including--proving that this is the
K?liyuga, in which everything is inverted and backwards-- being one of
the examiners for his PhD!!) , I very fondly remember when, some few
years ago, I was in Paris, and had just visited the church at
Montmarte with my son. It was a really hot day and we were looking for
a cool drink. Walking down the street someone from behind me in French
spoke as if begging for a coin, then tugging at my back. When I turned
around, there was Werner with a gigantic smile on his face! It was so
utterly charming to see him again in that way.  I shall sincerely miss
him.

I am very, very sad also to learn of the too early demise of my good 
friend and mentor Werner.
He was a luminous personnality and such an excellent teacher, always 
helpful and so gentle with everyone.
His knowledge of the R?gveda was the most excellent I have seen. He was 
so intimate with that text that we had nicknamed him "The Kyoto R??i"!
But his virtuosity in Sanskrit was such that he could penetrate any 
piece of this vast literature with the same nearly supernatural insight.
I vividly remember sitting with him at his desk in his little office in 
Kyodai crammed with books from floor to ceiling for hours discussing the 
subtleties of the ?atapatha Br?hma?a or the Maitr?ya?? Sa?hit? or some 
unfathomable piece of /k?vya. /His incredible linguistic intuition could 
make the most obscure passages clear as water in a snap. Then we would 
celebrate our little victories over the text with a good beer at the 
Nichi-Futsu Kaikan and continue our discussions on nearly every topic 
with his wonderful sense of humour late into the night, and with many 
more beers, and perhaps a little wine too.
There he gave me one of the best advices I received in all my life: 
"Fran?ois! If you would just stop indulging in your computer programming 
for some time, you would know your Sanskrit better!"
Thus I did, and thus I became slightly better.
Werner was one of the last humanists I know.
I will deeply miss him.
Fare well my friend! I hope to see you again in the afterlife.
My thoughts go also to his wife and kids, and his beloved companion Carole.

With great sadness,

F. Voegeli

I can also attest to his great kindness.  Many years ago when I was just
learning sanskrit I was asked by an ashram to correct one of the vedic
hymns in a book of theirs, and though he didn't know me, prof. Knobl spent
what must have been hours and many emails carefully explaining the
different issues with the vedic accents in the hymn. And his kindness and
gentleness came through in his emails..

Werner remembered having seen me in T?bingen around 1970, when Dieter D?tting of the Max Planck Institute invited me to give a lecture on the Indus script ? I remembered only meeting Werner?s teacher Paul Thieme. Werner told me that he revered Thieme so much that he was unable to publish anything as long as Thieme was alive, for the fear bthat it would not meet Thieme?s standard. I give below details of his life not found in Natiliya?s obituary. His surname Knobl comes from the German word Knobel.

Our Beloved Teacher, Werner, the Master of Vedic lore whose ocean of knowledge was enormous and absolutely unique in its own way, passed away last Thursday, on 28th September. There are no words to express how much I am already missing our Great Teacher, our classes, discussions, and our Little Vedic Sanskrit Lovers community.

Alongside with other Vedic Sanskrit learners, I joined the Leiden Summer School in Languages and Linguistics in 2022, where we spent two beautiful and saturated weeks studying fragments from the ?gveda and Br?hma?as. Thus, when the Summer School was nearing to the end some of us expressed a wish to continue our studies online. After that Werner discussed it with the Director, Sasha Lubotsky to receive his approval, which was then generously granted.

> And so, until the next Summer School in Leiden we were lucky to meet online 10 times during the autumn-winter of 2022, and the same in the spring of 2023. Our group was formed of former and current Werner?s students, who joined the classes from different corners of the world. Werner always welcomed questions either sent to him by email, or asked during the class. He was happy to give elaborate answers to any difficult questions, and did not hesitate to discuss and oppose the opinions of other scholars, and even His teacher, the late Paul Thieme, whom he frequently recalled with great veneration, however, He always did so with great respect. Moreover, He continuously encouraged us to have our own analyses and never missed to add the phrase: ?You are not obliged to trust me,? or else ?If you want to accept this argument [?]?. I dare to say that most of us were impatiently looking forward to our weekly online sessions that allowed us not only to get immersed in the realm of Vedic mythopoetics that dates back for more than 3000 years, but also to look at the aspects of Historical Linguistics, intricate Grammar matters, Vedic intonation, philology, translation problems of some difficult passages, etc.

Dear Friends,

A friend who is not on the list is seeking a good book or two that discusses the similarities between the Avesta and Rig Veda. 

Might any of you have suggestions? Many thanks.

Dear all,

hm, which similarities exactly?

Concerning grammar, there is the old, but still impressive for showing 
the parallelisms
 ??? A. V. Williams Jackson: An Avesta grammar, in comparison with 
Sanskrit. Part I. Phonology, inflection, word-formation. Stuttgart 1892

Concerning metrics, I've ventured to discuss similarities and 
differences in the first chapter of
 ??? Metrik und metrische Techniken im Rgveda: Streckformen in 
Trimeter-Versen. Graz 1998
(https://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/personal/agnes/dipl.htm), which will be 
reprinted in the nearer future (and I could send the 1st chapter if 
someone is interested).

Concerning the ritual, I have an article by Michael Witzel in mind which 
discussed the parallel elements in Avestan and Vedic texts, but 
unfortunately I can't remember the title now.

Perhaps other list members can help.

Best wishes,
Agnes

What ever happened to part II?  I vaguely recall someone saying the
manuscript was in some university basement/archive somewhere?

A colleague, retired professor at the University of Li?ge (ULg), Eric
Pirart, is specialised in this kind of question.
Unhappily, I don't know his mail address, but you probably will find it by
looking at ULg website.

Dear Patricia,

I don't know which similarities your friend is after, but two suggestions:

- Witzel, Michael. 2011. Gandh?ra and the formation of the Vedic and
Zoroastrian canons <http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:9887626>. In
Proceedings of the International Symposium. The Book. Romania. Europa.
Etudes euro- et afro-asiatiques. 490-532. Bucharest: Biblioteca
Bucure?tilor. <<< Agnes, is this the article you had in mind?
- Stausberg, Michael & Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina (eds.). 2023. *The
Wiley Blackwell companion to Zoroastrianism
<https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/The+Wiley+Blackwell+Companion+to+Zoroastrianism-p-9781119867562>*
(Wiley Blackwell Companions to Religion). Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell. <<<
Part I will have a number of articles of interest to your friend.

All best,

Dear members of the list,

When I click on Benares Sanskrit College 1911, in the Sanskrit Catalogues
shared by Dominik Wujastyk (
https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/index.php/s/yfwp8XFRtmnQ8Mr), I find 328
pages completely blank. Is that normal and does anybody have a soft copy of
that Catalogue ? I am actually looking for a Ms of the *Rekh?ga?ita* that,
according to the editor Trivedi (Bombay 1901-2), contains some margin notes
in Arabic.

Thank you for your help,

Dear list members,
I'm trying to make a list of all websites that convert unicode

Dear Harry

On Lexilogos, you can copy and paste text and convert it into
transliteration or nagari. It does Vedic accents, too.

Thank you all so much! My friend is a non-specialist but is eternally grateful for your wide ranging responses.

I am always so awed by the knowledge and kindness of this list. In addition to help I have caught up with old friends and have a lunch date to meet a new one. You all are the best.

Thank you,

Patricia

Dear Friends,

A friend who is not on the list is seeking a good book or two that discusses the similarities between the Avesta and Rig Veda.

Might any of you have suggestions? Many thanks.

Sanskrit Library: https://sanskritlibrary.org/transcodeText.html.

Such a list is a very nice idea. When the list is ready, I think it would
be excellent to have a feature comparison table, in order to extract main
features for improving these software products in the future, or even
develop new ones. I would use WebAssembly and the SLP1 as the pivotal
eucoding, to provide the transcoding, in order to move the computation
burden to the browser, and have a static, simple webpage.

Someone may have mentioned it already, but I use https://www.skrutable.info/ ? which I discovered through the Indology listserv. It has a number of other useful features as well.

When the list is ready, I think it would be excellent to have a feature comparison table, in order to extract main features for improving these software products in the future, or even develop new ones. I would use WebAssembly and the SLP1 as the pivotal eucoding, to provide the transcoding, in order to move the computation burden to the browser, and have a static, simple webpage.

Dear all,

I was trying to get the appropriate devan?gar? for tr?l?lok?n (cf.
https://archive.org/details/sanskritgrammari00whit/page/69/mode/1up
especially the middle versoin without vir?ma), but it seems like most of
these sites cannot handle it. If someone is going through all of them and
checking for accuracy, this might be one instance where some improvement is
required (e.g. aksharamukha will give ????????????? using either IAST or
ISO 15919 for the input). The Sanskrit Library provides the last of the
three versions Whitney gives, i.e., with candrabindu and vir?ma, but that
might be a limitation of available glyphs. I would be interested to know
which typefaces can offer the second of the three versions in Whitney.

Looking on Gretil, it seems several texts give the transliteration ?l l for
l? l. This reflects Whintey's first version but is not exactly correct.

All the Best,
Victor

Dear all,

I want to bring to your notice that many of us are using this
transliteration tool from Samsaadhanii - https://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/,
which converts between many standard notations used in academia.

In aksharamukha, alm?la with ISO 15919 as input will give the correct
output ????? with the candrabindu.

Dear McComas,
Thanks so much for your effort.
As Andrea Acri has pointed out to me (and to you), the Sanskrit teaching
offered at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE-PSL) and the PG
programs in Sanskrit Studies it offers are not yet in the list.
The Year of Establishment of a Sanskrit program here is 1868.
At present we are part of the Master Etudes Asiatiques (2 years), a
programme that is followed by a 3-year PhD programme.
More details in the form which I filled up and have just sent.
Greetings from Paris,
Jan

Subject: [INDOLOGY] In search of an emendation
Message-ID: <4a7308b48c0841e1b77489cf2c01b476@hadw-bw.de>

Dear colleagues,

my colleague Aneesh Raghavan and I are working on an unpublished Sanskrit m?h?tmya of Kanchipuram and we have encountered a textual problem that we have so far not been able to solve. The passage in question is part of the origin story of the Palar river, which is said to have originated from the streams of milk that the cow K?madhenu emitted after the sage Vasi??ha had created a calf for her. It reads as follows:

pr??tikan?t?akitair an?gaih? prasnutastanaman?d?ala? |
?uks?a?mabhis (v.l.: ak??mabhis)? tam a?lokya mahaughaih? pa?yasair nijaih? |
ullan?ghitobhayatat?a?m udapa?dayad a?paga?m |

(The subject is the cow; ?tam? refers to ?vatsam?, i.e. the calf.)

Here, the word ?uk??mabhi?? does not seem to make sense, nor does the variant reading ?ak??mabhi??. However, we cannot think of a meaningful emendation. If any of the members of this list have an idea of how to make sense of this passage, or how the problematic reading could be emended, we would be most grateful!

Best wishes,
Jonas Buchholz

Hi Jonas,

Assuming that the reading is *utk??mabhi?* [not *uk??mabhi?* or *ak??mabhi?*],
it could be a compound of *ud+k??man* meaningesg "lifting up from the
ground", or getting up, as an adjective of *a?gai?* [or of implied "eyes"
connecting with *tam ?lokya*. Just suggesting a possibility. Best,

Madhav

I've looked into this and I can't explain the blank pages, which I also
see.  The files at catalogues.indology.info are a mirror of files on my
disk, and on my disk this catalogue is fine (though truncated at p. 320).
I attach it to this email.

In his Aparok??nubh?ti verse 81, ?a?kar?c?rya says: s?k?matve sarvavast?n??
sth?latva? copanetrata?. Here, some modern interpreters have interpreted
the word upanetra as referring to eye-glasses or some lens that enlarges
the view. I am just wondering about the history of lenses and eye-glasses
around the time of ?a?kara. An allied question will be the date and
authorship of Aparok??nubh?ti. Any information and references are
appreciated.

Hi Madhav,

I wrote my PhD dissertation (hopefully soon to be a book) on the Aparok??nubh?ti and have come to think that it was probably written closer to the late fifteenth to mid-sixteenth century, as part of the growing Advaitic response to the increased output of ha?hayoga texts. While the D?pik? commentary is attributed to Vidy?ra?ya, it also seems to be later and unlikely to have actually been written by him.

This would support the idea of upanetra as referring to some sort of magnifying lens, which seems to have been introduced by the Portuguese in the 15th century (see Birch, Jason. 2011. ?The Meaning of ha?ha in Early Ha?ha Yoga.? p. 540, fn. 98).

Best wishes,
Zo?

Dear List members,

I saw announced a sequel to Star Wars which features a character called Ahsoka. I am curious to know if this is a mangled version of A?oka, via Ashoka (in Dutch papers the aspiration in the name Gandhi is often misplaced: Ghandi).

with kind regards, Herman

Dear Herman Tieken,

I don't know if Ahsoka is related to A?oka but there is a long history of
Sanskrit and related influence in Star Wars. I recell reading that Yoda
takes his name from yoddh?. The Duel of the Fates song from Episode 1 has
its chorus sung in (mangled) Sanskrit. Additionally, Tibetan and Kalmyk
were supposedly the inspiration, in part, of the language of the Ewoks.

With my best wishes,
Charles

Hi Jonas,

I don't know if it can be helpful but the compound *k?utk??ma*? "emaciated
with hunger" is found in several pur??as. Maybe the cow considers the calf
emaciated with hunger and she wants to breastfeed him. I suggest something
like  k?utk??me?a tam ?lokya in which the instrumental case could express
the cause. It isn't totally satisfactory but just an idea.
Warm regards,

Dr. Deshpande,
I was consulting Swami AlokAnanda's translation of "AporakshAnubhuti" . Upanetra has been translated as spectacle or lenses, or any other aid for proper vision.Prefix "Upa" is used to denote a meaning which implies something which is the nearest approximation to the word which follows the prefix. A spectacle or lens is the nearest approximation to eye , but not eye proper&nbsp;Shankaracharya lived in 8th C. E. It need to be searched as to whether vision -aids were available in 8th CE India.RegardsAlakendu Das

Dear Herman,

For once, this is a case of mythology that came to be recently enough for
its creators to tell us about their motivations on Wikipedia:

Ahsoka was created by George Lucas
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas> and Dave Filoni
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Filoni>.[2]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano#cite_note-2> The character was
developed to illustrate how Anakin Skywalker
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker> develops from the brash,
undisciplined Padawan apprentice in *Star Wars: Episode II ? Attack of the
Clones
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_II_%E2%80%93_Attack_of_the_Clones>*
(2002)
to the more reserved Jedi Knight in *Episode III ? Revenge of the Sith
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode_III_%E2%80%93_Revenge_of_the_Sith>*
 (2005).[3] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano#cite_note-TVGuide-3>
Lucas,
who had two daughters, also wanted the character to appeal to girls.[4]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano#cite_note-taylor-4> Early in
development, Ahsoka's name was "Ashla".[5]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano#cite_note-5>[a]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano#cite_note-7> Lucas renamed her
after the ancient Indian emperor Ashoka
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka>; the spelling was then altered by
screenwriter Henry Gilroy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gilroy>.[7]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano#cite_note-8>  (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano)

and Twitter:

'In honor of #CloneWars 10th, the title page for the series bible I wrote
back in 05. When we met with George to discuss the bible he changed
Anakin's Padawan from 'Ashla' to 'Ashoka', after the Indian Emperor of the
Maurya Dynasty. I later tweaked it to Ahsoka to make her unique.' (

Dear colleagues and friends,

We are delighted to announce our symposium ?Printing Religion in South Asia? that will take place on October 18, 2023, at the 51st Annual Conference on South Asia<https://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/schedule/symposium/>, University of Wisconsin?Madison. We cordially invite you all to attend our symposium. Please find our final program and flyers as attachments, and share our announcement with your home institutions and colleagues.

Our symposium features eight early- to mid-career scholars specializing in South Asian religious and material cultures.

Panelists:
Annanya Bohidar | Hindu ??stra, Sexual Science or Pornography? A Study of Printed Sex Books in the Tamil Public Sphere (1900?1940s)
Rushnae Kabir | Witnessing Love in the Mil?d Ritual: Devotion, Orality, and Emotion in the Mil?dn?ma
Alexandra Kaloyanides | The Power of the Book in Nineteenth-Century Burma
Sharmeen Mehri | New Ways of Reading: Printing the Khordeh Avesta in Colonial India
Shobna Nijhawan | At the Margins of the Hindi Periodical: Marketing Religious Publications
Pranav Prakash | Unorthodox Printing: A Brief History of Maithili Chapbooks in Colonial South Asia

Discussants:
John Cort | Panel 1: The Impact of Print
Jamal Jones | Panel 2: The Craft of Print
Daniel Morgan | Panel 3: The Community of Print
Yasmin Saikia | Panel 4: The Power of Print

This symposium is part of our Book Cultures of South Asia<https://www.book-cultures.com/> collaboration that we founded in 2019 at the annual meeting of the Andrew W. Mellon Society of Fellows in Critical Bibliography, Rare Book School, University of Virginia. We have since been building a network of scholars whose research makes valuable contributions to subdisciplines like the history of the book, critical bibliography and the study of material cultures from the vantage point of South Asian history and religions. As we continue to promote the study of material, textual and visual cultures in the field of South Asian Studies, we hope to benefit from your thoughtful engagement, support and encouragement.

Sincerely,
Megan Eaton Robb and Pranav Prakash

As for the Sanskrit in the lyrics of "The Duel of the Fates", it's probably
there, but very well hidden. "Mangled" doesn't begin to describe it... I
looked into this years ago, and here's some of what I've found. Allegedly,
the lyrics are based on a Welsh poem called Cad Goddeu, rendered into
English as The Battle of the Trees. One verse of this, in one English
translation, goes
"Under the tongue root a fight most dread, and another raging behind in the
head"
(I am still baffled as to what this "fight most dread" may be under a
"tongue root".)
Anyway, this was supposedly "translated" into Sanskrit, though the
translator may not have known Sanskrit beyond being able to look up some
words in a dictionary, then broken up and rearranged by the composer into
something that sounded good to him. As far as I know, no official lyrics
were ever published, but some people have transcribed phonetically what
they thought they heard. The result was:
Korah Matah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Rahtamah Yoodhah Korah
Korah Syahdho Rahtahmah Daanyah
Korah Keelah Daanyah
Nyohah Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Syadho Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Daanyah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Daanyah Korah Rahtahmah
Nyohah Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Syadho Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah
Korah Matah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Daanyah Korah Rahtahmah
Nyohah Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Syadho Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Then someone, who definitely knew no more Sanskrit than being able to flip
the pages of a dictionary (but was a speaker of a modern North Indian
language), kept doing so until he found something that sort of vaguely
resembled the words above, and announced to the world that these are the
meanings of the words in the lyrics. For instance: Matah = head (Hindi
?????); Rath = speak (??); Amah = give (??) etc.
Others then passed this on as fact, some even adding that it's okay if it
doesn't make sense, "because there is no formalised grammar in Sanskrit".
At any rate, I think some segments of the above transcript can indeed be
matched to Sanskrit words, e.g.
korah is probably *ghora?* (unless it's *khara?*) and korah rahtamah may be
*ghoratama?*, perhaps a rendition of "most dread"
yoodhah is definitely *yuddha?*
syahdho may be **sya adha?* (perhaps matah also contains *adha?*?)
daanyah and/or nyohah may contain *anya?* (perhaps preceded by an ablative
case ending in daanyah)

There's rather more recognisable Sanskrit in the lyrics of another piece,
Qui Gon's Funeral. The (unofficial) transcript says,
Madhurah swehpna, go rahdomah swehpna, morittioo, madhurah, swehpna. There
is no translation, but the English subtitle of the song is Death''s long
sweet sleep.
I think this can safely be equated to Madhura? svapna?, ghoratama? svapna?,
m?tyu?, madhura? svapna?.
Though perhaps we should look for a word meaning something like "long" in
"go rahdomah" - but I haven't been able to think of one.
All the best,
Dan

Dear Colleagues,

this is perhaps a good occasion to point out that there are many Fair 
Open Access (FOA) alternatives to the big publisher(s) that do not 
charge extremely high fees and prices for their services and products:

https://foasas.org/#journals

The ?Fair? in ?Fair Open Access? is important because FOA allows people 
from diverse backgrounds to access as well as contribute to scholarly 
literature. Since we launched the FOA Initiative three years ago, we 
have found that scholars are increasingly interested in such 
alternatives, and many excellent papers have been published in FOA 
journals since then.

Best regards,
Dominik A. Haas and Vitus Angermeier

By the way, I see that Patrick Olivelle has recently published a new study of Ashoka:

https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/asianstudies/news/prof-olivelle-publishes-major-new-study-of-ashoka
Professor Emeritus Patrick Olivelle<https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/asianstudies/faculty/olivelle> has just published a new biography or portrait of King Ashoka, a pivotal figure in the history of ancient India. The book, Ashoka: Portrait of a Philosopher King<https://harpercollins.co.in/product/ashoka/> (Harper Collins, 2023), is now available in India and will shortly be available through Yale University Press<https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300270006/ashoka/> in the US. It is the first book in a new series called Indian Lives, edited by Ramachandra Guha. A number of translations of the book into other languages are already in progress. Congratulations to Prof. Olivelle on this tremendous achievement!

Le 12 oct. 2023 ? 09:42, D?niel Balogh via INDOLOGY <indology at list.indology.info<mailto:indology at list.indology.info>> a ?crit :

As for the Sanskrit in the lyrics of "The Duel of the Fates", it's probably there, but very well hidden. "Mangled" doesn't begin to describe it... I looked into this years ago, and here's some of what I've found. Allegedly, the lyrics are based on a Welsh poem called Cad Goddeu, rendered into English as The Battle of the Trees. One verse of this, in one English translation, goes
"Under the tongue root a fight most dread, and another raging behind in the head"
(I am still baffled as to what this "fight most dread" may be under a "tongue root".)
Anyway, this was supposedly "translated" into Sanskrit, though the translator may not have known Sanskrit beyond being able to look up some words in a dictionary, then broken up and rearranged by the composer into something that sounded good to him. As far as I know, no official lyrics were ever published, but some people have transcribed phonetically what they thought they heard. The result was:
Korah Matah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Rahtamah Yoodhah Korah
Korah Syahdho Rahtahmah Daanyah
Korah Keelah Daanyah
Nyohah Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Syadho Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Daanyah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Daanyah Korah Rahtahmah
Nyohah Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Syadho Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah
Korah Matah Korah Rahtahmah
Korah Daanyah Korah Rahtahmah
Nyohah Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Syadho Keelah Korah Rahtahmah
Then someone, who definitely knew no more Sanskrit than being able to flip the pages of a dictionary (but was a speaker of a modern North Indian language), kept doing so until he found something that sort of vaguely resembled the words above, and announced to the world that these are the meanings of the words in the lyrics. For instance: Matah = head (Hindi ?????); Rath = speak (??); Amah = give (??) etc.
Others then passed this on as fact, some even adding that it's okay if it doesn't make sense, "because there is no formalised grammar in Sanskrit".
At any rate, I think some segments of the above transcript can indeed be matched to Sanskrit words, e.g.
korah is probably ghora? (unless it's khara?) and korah rahtamah may be ghoratama?, perhaps a rendition of "most dread"
yoodhah is definitely yuddha?
syahdho may be *sya adha? (perhaps matah also contains adha??)
daanyah and/or nyohah may contain anya? (perhaps preceded by an ablative case ending in daanyah)

There's rather more recognisable Sanskrit in the lyrics of another piece, Qui Gon's Funeral. The (unofficial) transcript says,
Madhurah swehpna, go rahdomah swehpna, morittioo, madhurah, swehpna. There is no translation, but the English subtitle of the song is Death''s long sweet sleep.
I think this can safely be equated to Madhura? svapna?, ghoratama? svapna?, m?tyu?, madhura? svapna?.
Though perhaps we should look for a word meaning something like "long" in "go rahdomah" - but I haven't been able to think of one.
All the best,
Dan

Dear Herman Tieken,

I don't know if Ahsoka is related to A?oka but there is a long history of Sanskrit and related influence in Star Wars. I recell reading that Yoda takes his name from yoddh?. The Duel of the Fates song from Episode 1 has its chorus sung in (mangled) Sanskrit. Additionally, Tibetan and Kalmyk were supposedly the inspiration, in part, of the language of the Ewoks.

With my best wishes,
Charles

Dear List members,

I saw announced a sequel to Star Wars which features a character called Ahsoka. I am curious to know if this is a mangled version of A?oka, via Ashoka (in Dutch papers the aspiration in the name Gandhi is often misplaced: Ghandi).

with kind regards, Herman

Patrick is currently in India. A few days ago he had a wonderful, 
thoughtful discussion of his approach to this biography with Ramachandra 
Guha, I don't know if the link is still active.

I have been associated with Indology Forum since 2011.This has certainly given me a lot of opportunity to refine my knowledge base in related subjects. But , of late, I am not getting replies to my queries. May I kindly be confirmed as to whether my name is in the list or not.

Dear colleagues,

I am looking for a Ms of the *Rekh?ga?ita*, a Sanskrit translation of
Euclid's Elements, made by Jagannatha in 1728 Jaipur, from an Arabic Ms.
According to its editor (Trivedi, Bombay, 1901-2, p.7), the most important
Ms he used came from the Library of the Government Sanskrit College,
Banaras (today Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya) , but I can't find it
in the Catalogue. Does someone have an explanation of this curious fact ?
I am also looking for Arabic versions of Euclid's Elements conserved in
India, especially Nasir ad-din at-Tusi's Tahrir. Do you know where I could
find more information ?

Best regards,

Dear list members,

I've been asked why the title of this hymn is s?ryama??al???akam, when it
has twelve verses and a phalam verse. Written after the collophon is
s?ryama??aladv?da?astotram . I do not know where that came from, whether
from the transcriber or from what he was transcribing.

Is it possible that the a??akam in the title doesn't refer to the number of
verses but is a qualifier of s?ryama??ala in the title? I.e.
s?ryama??al???akam means "the eight circles of the sun" ?

The hymn is:

Dear Jean Michel,

The Benares Sanskrit College 1911 catalogue also does not include any p?rvam?m??s? manuscripts. I was first curious to see if the Ny?yaka?ik? manuscript reported in the 1888 (?) catalogue would also appear there, but did not find it. I expect that another volume may have been planned in 1911, but was not published.

You will find here a reference to the earlier catalogue: https://www.oeaw.ac.at/resources/Record/990002234850504498/Details . I have not seen any soft copy of this catalogue on line, and I have a Xerox copy of only the title page and the page for the Ny?yaka?ik? manuscript.

Theodor Aufrecht cites this ms  as Ben 30 on page 534 of Catalogus Catalogorum (1891).

Dear Jean,

Numerous copies of Tusi's *Tahrir usul al-hindisah li-uqlidus*  are housed
in Indian libraries. For instance,  The Khudabakhsh Oriental Library in
Patna holds two manuscripts with call numbers Arabic 2431 and 2432. Other
copies can be found in Asafiyya and Raza Rampur Libraries.


Best,
Nariman

Thank you very much for your answer, Nariman

Actually, there is a long list of Mss of the *Tahrir usul al-handasa li
uqlidis* on https://ismi.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/witness/187347
But it mentions only one Ms in Patna, with a number that doesn't
correspond to Arabic 2431 or 2432, and it doesn't mention the
Asafiyya Library. Can you tell me more information about these ?

Best,

Jean Michel

Thank you for your answer, Eliot,

It is very strange that the 1911 *Catalogue of the Sanskrit Mss in the
Sanskrit College Library* doesn't mention at least a *R**ekh?ga?ita, *since its
editor Trivedi (in 1901-2) used Mss from this Library. I agree with you
concerning other possible volumes of this *Catalogue*, for it seems from
its content that it is only the first part of a more complete Catalogue,
that would go beyond Vedic or post-Vedic subjects.
Does anyone in the list know about other Catalogues of Banaras collections
and where to find them ?

Best,

Jean Michel

Dear all,

I had intended to wait until its purported release of Dec. 1st to announce, but I have just learned that my book has started shipping from the publisher in advance of that date.  I hope this will be of interest to several of you.  As of now, I don?t have a discount code (though there will be such for the AOS and AAR conferences; should I get one more generally, I will be sure to share).

Dear Alakendu,
Its Mr. Spier not Dr. Spier, but more importantly, are you aware of any
references in the literature to "eight" aspects or somethings of the sun.
Thanks,

Mr Spier,
I have an answer to your query, but it may be a probable one .&nbsp;
Yajur Veda has two branches-Kannya and Madhyandin.In the 34th chapter of Madhyandin , names of Solar Gods have been mentioned . I have spotted 7 names ascribed to Sun relating to the different time periods of a day.&nbsp;They are Surya, Sabita, Pushpa, Mitro,Arrko or Aryama, Bhogo and Vishnu .&nbsp;I got some of them, like the Sun from morning to 12 noon is Arrko . Vishnu is the Afternoon Sun. Bhogo is the Sun just after Sunrise.The mild&nbsp; early morning Sun is Pusha.&nbsp;Further elucidation invited.&nbsp;Regards.&nbsp;Alakendu Das.&nbsp;

Dear list members,
I&#39;ve been asked why the title of this hymn is?s?ryama??al???akam, when it has twelve verses and a phalam verse. Written after the collophon is?s?ryama??aladv?da?astotram . I do not know where that came from, whether from the transcriber or from what he was transcribing.?
Is it possible that the a??akam in the title doesn&#39;t refer to the number of verses but is a qualifier of?s?ryama??ala in the title? I.e.?s?ryama??al???akam means &quot;the eight circles of the sun&quot; ?

I don?t think it is so strange.

Both of the Ny?yaka?ik? manuscripts in the Pandit edition of Vidhiviveka and Ny?yaka?ik?, published before 1911, were in the collection of this library, but they do not appear in the 1911 Catalogue. Only one of these appeared in the multi-volume catalogue published in the second half of the 20th century. When I inquired about the other manuscript ca. 1978, the reading room supervisor looked in a copy of the 1889 (?) catalogue, and told me that the manuscript had been sent on loan to Bonn in 1914, and the last request for return in or around 1930 was not answered. I infer from this account that the ship carrying the manuscript may have been sunk in the Mediterranean Sea in the early days of World War One.

While the editor of Rekh?ga?ita you reference reports he returned the manuscript to Arthur Venis in 1901, we cannot be sure that it was received. I do not see a report of any manuscript of this text in volume 9 of the current catalogue, published in 1963. It may be difficult to get information from the library.

Best wishes,

Elliot

Dear Jean Michel,

While ISMI has many merits, it unfortunately lacks substantial data
regarding South Asian collections. During my research on the reception of
??s?'s logical and philosophical works in India, specifically *As?s
al-iqtib?s* and *Tajr?d al-i?tiq?d*, I stumbled upon approximately fifty
copies of *Ta?r?r* scattered across different collections in the
Subcontinent. Given that it was not the primary focus of my research, I did
not systematically record the information each time I encountered a
manuscript. Nevertheless, I believe this may still be valuable to you.

Message-ID: <CAM0n-bXGgDxO7dyLYasmHZCk7Y9hX=0qVAbDuDKdfmEUQD6p+A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,
can anyone recommend (and perhaps share) any useful literature about kites
in India? I mean the ones with a bamboo frame that you fly on a string, not
the ones with feathers that fly themselves and eat rats. I'm mainly
interested in general overviews, about the history of Indian kites and
about kite flying, kite making and kite fighting in modern India, not so
much in any narrowly specialised details, but anything is welcome. I've
skimmed "A Kite Journey through India" by Tal Streeter and "A Different
Freedom" by Nikita Desai, but the former is far more interested in anecdote
than in checking and reporting any facts, while the latter, even while

In addition to generalities, I would be happy to learn if any of you have
come across references (or possible references) to kites in Sanskrit, or in
vernacular literature before the 16th century. For the former, I'm only
aware of the Pa?catantra story about the wooden Garu?a, which is more a
flying machine than a kite. For the latter, I know about a verse by N?mdev,
but no others.

Frembgen, J?rgen Wasim, and Paul Rollier 2014. Wrestlers, pigeon fanciers, and kite flyers: Traditional sports and pastimes in Lahore. New York: Oxford University Press. 192 pp., ill. 
In today's Pakistan the dominant conservative mindset tends to marginalize leisure activities. However, traditional sports and pastimes, games and play, entertainment and amusement are an expression of happiness and joy and an integral part of popular culture. They represent a cultural system and preserve cultural values.
The dimension of playfulness inherent in traditional sports and pastimes is clearly articulated in the culture of the Punjab in general and of Lahore in particular, especially in the Walled City. The popular pastimes selected for this study, namely wrestling, flying pigeons and kite fighting, are almost emblematic of the Walled City, an urban space where wrestlers, pigeon fanciers and kite flyers appear to be the veritable custodians of Lahori culture.
This is the first book that details these traditional sports and pastimes, which, the authors argue, form an integral part of social life in Pakistan and create important bonds between various communities.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Whitney and doubling of "ch"
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o9yb_hnA+UhL9cvi6SiHtvfU2x9CBSUizLGViq6dFebtA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
Whitney  in his grammar section 227 says about the doubling of "*ch*".
"As a general rule *ch* is not to be allowed by the grammarians to stand in
that form after vowels but is to be doubled becoming *cch* (which in the
manuscripts is sometimes written *chch*). . .According to Panini *ch* is to
be doubled within a word after a long or a short vowel."

But if you look in his "Roots, Verb-forms and Derivatives" at the entry
for *i?, ich * nowhere does he double "*ch*" not even after a short vowel
rather he has* i**chati, ichaka,* * ich?* and* ichu * . Does anyone know
why for this root in all his examples he didn't double *ch* after vowels?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear all,

If I remember correctly, there are different manuscriptal etc. 
traditions as for the notation of "ch" or "cch / chch". As there is no 
opposition of ch or cch, one can write one or the other. Whitney perhaps 
chose "ch" for brevity.

As ch / cch / chch makes the syllable heavy (i.e. is treated like a 
consonant group), a notation "cch / chch" is clearer than ch, but of 
course the well-versed know that "ch" counts as a consonant group ;-)

Best wishes,
Agnes

Thank you everybody.  This was sent to me by Michael Witzel and I don't
think he would mind if I share it.

a long and bit complicated story:

 Panini?s doubling of ch-  and cases like icchati ,gacchati. p?cchati all
go back to Indo-European *sk?
as in ch?y?/shadow, Dutch schaduw {pronounced  s-kh) or Latin posco = p?cha-

This RV WRITES only ch in gachati but the meter shows that it is a double
consonant. Which?

[[[(there are 2 cases of -khkh- in RV, trying to remember. Maybe just a
fluke of Maharastrian spelling)See below.]]]

Ka?ha Samhita (and Kashmir spelling in general) seem to have preserved the
old pronunciation; they write : ga?chati etc. (Kerala has -cs- I believe)
(See my Veda InKashmir)

This shows why ch?y? etc.  has double consonant (cch in Panini?s area?) in
Sandhi as per Panini.

So Whitney?s Roots  with ichati reflects the RV spelling.

You can also check in the  first volume of Wackernagel, Altindische
Grammatik (1895) with some data.

Hope this mess is cleared up a bit.

========= on khkh: in our SARVA Dictionary:
http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/sarva/entrance.html

 RV akhkhal?-(k?'ty?), 'the sound of frogs in the rainy season', which
Thieme, Kleine Schriften 138, takes as 'producing syllables (ak?ara)', see
M. Mayrhofer, Etymologisches W?rterbuch des Altindorarischen, 1986: 44. --
However, note K. Hoffmann, Aufs?tze zur Indoiranistik, 1975: 176 who takes
it as an interjection. Note also that the sound combination -khkh- is not
allowed in Indo-Aryan. The old RV word therefore represents an onomatopetic
imitation of frogs that has survived, like many other onomatopoetica (see
bal-bal) without the expected sound changes from Vedic to Modern IA

My 2? worth:

Whatever the motivation may be for the spelling with a single <ch> in the Rig Veda (and let?s keep in mind that the ?real? Rig Veda is oral), the syllable preceding <ch> in forms like gachati ?goes? is heavy, not light, indicating that we are dealing with cluster or geminate ([cch] or the like); compare RV 1.1.4c s? ?d dev??u gachati in an iambic cadence. Has anybody looked at old MSS of the Rig Veda to see whether in indigenous scripts forms like ga(c)chati are written with ? or with ??? (or their equivalents)?

All the best,

Hans Henrich

At least, this manuscript seems to write ???? and ???, for what would
normally be read as ?????? and ?????.

But there is likely to be variation among the manuscripts.

If I remember correctly, there are different manuscriptal etc. traditions as for the notation of "ch" or "cch / chch". As there is no opposition of ch or cch, one can write one or the other. Whitney perhaps chose "ch" for brevity.

As ch / cch / chch makes the syllable heavy (i.e. is treated like a consonant group), a notation "cch / chch" is clearer than ch, but of course the well-versed know that "ch" counts as a consonant group ;-)

Mr. Spier,

I can cite an instance . We take the word"ICCHA" ( wish or desire).
Here, we have doubling of "Ch" after a short or long vowel .

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Whitney and doubling of "ch"


Dear list members,
Whitney  in his grammar section 227 says about the doubling of "ch".
"As a general rule ch is not to be allowed by the grammarians to stand in that form after vowels but is to be doubled becoming cch (which in the manuscripts is sometimes written chch). . .According to Panini ch is to be doubled within a word after a long or a short vowel."

But if you look in his "Roots, Verb-forms and Derivatives" at the entry  for i?, ich  nowhere does he double "ch" not even after a short vowel rather he has ichati, ichaka,  ich? and ichu  . Does anyone know why for this root in all his examples he didn't double ch after vowels?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

1) Can someone point me to some article on when and why the Rg-veda was
first written down . what script etc.  Was it a British initiative or was
the whole or parts written down before the colonial period?  I've seen in a
modern Taittiriya Vedashala the students practicing some of their mantras
using  written material.  Did the medieval and later Vedashalas also use
written materials to teach their students?

2) Is it possible that this  "Rg-veda written spelling gachati etc." is
just a reflection of what was written when the Rg-veda was first written
down?

Thanks,

On the first question, there?s a recent book about it (which has been in my TBR pile for a while now)

[9788323397694.jpg]

I?m following this discussion with great interest. It seems to me the script was meant to convey the sounds in Vedic recitation, so the question of whether someone is chanting ?gacchati? because it is written that way or writing ?gacchati? because it is chanted that way raises a lot of questions. I would be hard pressed to hear the difference between gacchati and Gauhati in the context of a chant, but that may be because I am not a trained vedicist nor a pandit.

Best,

Brian

Mr. Spier,
What we have learnt from Indological studies, Vedas were never written. We call it "Apaurasheya"... i. e. not written.The Vedic Mantras came as revealations to the seers( we call them 'Drashta" i. e. one who sees) while in Meditation.The hymns or mantras were then recited orally and passed on across generations of disciples. who memorised them.Finally, sage Vyasa arranged a compilation and&nbsp; divided them among his 4 disciples namely, Poilo, Boishampayan, Jaimini and Sumanta.Thus we got the 4 Vedas
In the 19th Century, Max Mueller edited theVedas.
Regards&nbsp;
Alakendu&nbsp; Das.&nbsp;

Dear Alakendu Das,

With all due respect, what you present in your email is the traditional
view regarding the Vedas which is historically inaccurate. Indeed the oral
tradition of the Vedas has been strong for millennia and continues up to
these days among some Brahmin communities across India. However, the Vedas
were written down in precolonial times and we have enough evidence of this
before any orientalist such as Max M?ller ever heard about the Vedas,
let alone compiled them into "books". Indeed, Max M?ller never set foot in
India and thus never heard the Vedas first hand. He worked with Indian
manuscripts (while also consulting traditional pandits via correspondence).
This matter has been well documented by previous scholarship and indeed the
excellent work of Cezary Galewicz (and others) is a great place to start
with the complex question raised by Harry Spiers. For those interested in
the relationship between orality and literacy in the Vedas, particularly in
contemporary India can also refer to my OA book: Embodying the
Vedas.Traditional Vedic Schools of Contemporary Maharashtra

Greetings to all from India.

there has been a circular feedback between the oral and the written
versions. This goes on till modern times in the Pathashalas in India. See
this photograph from the Ghaisas Guruji Veda Pathashala in Pune:

I saw the same thing at the home of Shri Phadake, a Veda teacher in Pune.
He told me that his students use printed books only until they have
memorized the texts.

Not an RV ms, but very palpable undeniable evidence that Vedas were written

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Whitney and doubling of "ch"
In-Reply-To: <CAJ3b0o9yb_hnA+UhL9cvi6SiHtvfU2x9CBSUizLGViq6dFebtA@mail.gmail.com>

Whitney's "Roots, Verb-forms..." was a "supplement" to the *first edition*
of the Grammar (also published in 1879). Whitney's Grammar was also
published in a second edition in 1896. As those of us know from using
Lanman's Reader (which cites the original edition), the two are not the
same.

In the grammar's first edition, Whitney uses the "ch" spelling (i.e., not
doubled):

608. A small number of roots add in the present-system a ch, or substitute
a ch for their final consonant, and form a stem ending in cha or ch?, which
is then inflected like any a-stem. This is historically, doubtless, a true
class-sign, analogous with the rest; but the verbs showing it are so few,
and in formation so irregular, that they are not well to be put together
into a class, but may best be treated as special cases falling under the
other classes.

a. Roots adding ch are ? and yu, which make the stems ?ch? and y?cha.

b. Roots substituting ch for their final are i?, u? (or vas *shine*), gam,
yam, which make the stems ich?, uch?, g?cha, y?cha.

This seems to be coordinate with his Atharva-Veda Pratishakya (*JAOS* VII
[1862]: 410), where Whitney writes: "we have followed in the printed text
the authority of the manuscripts, with hardly an exception, write simply
*ch*, instead of *cch."*

In the second edition of the Grammar, however, Whitney changes section 608,
from the single "cha" to the doubled "ccha" (as Harry points out):

608. A small number of roots add in the present-system a ch, or substitute
a ch for their final consonant, and form a stem ending in cha or ch?, which
is then inflected like any a-stem. This is historically, doubtless, a true
class-sign, analogous with the rest; but the verbs showing it are so few,
and in formation so irregular, that they are not well to be put together
into a class, but may best be treated as special cases falling under the
other classes.

a. Roots adding ch are ? and yu, which make the stems ?cch? and y?ccha.

b. Roots substituting ch for their final are i?, u? (or vas *shine*), gam,
yam, which make the stems icch?, ucch?, g?ccha, y?ccha.


Why he made this change is anyone's guess. But, the other grammars of the
time (M?ller; Monier Williams) did use "ccha," so it may simply have been a
nod to the commonly accepted practice of the time (Whitney did tend to be
contrarian!).

Dear Friends,

Might someone be able to share or point me to somewhere in which I can find
a document containing the following verse?

 Skandapur??a 4.1.45.11

I'm looking for the Sanskrit version.
But I've only managed to find English translations.

Some sites only have available chapters 1?25.
While the files on GRETIL are 404 missing.

Thank you.


All the best,

Mr. Hart,Mahabharata's&nbsp; 'Shantiparva ( 210/19)&nbsp; specifically mentions the Apaurasheya "&nbsp;nature of the Vedas.
" Hrrishaya MantraDrashtarO&nbsp; &nbsp;Na tu Bedasya Kartaro"&nbsp;Na Kaschid Veda Karta cha&nbsp;VedaSmarta Chaturbhuja".
SayanaAcharya's commentary on Vedas, too, reflects an identical view
"Josya niswashitam Veda jo VedabhyaAkhilam Jogot. "....
I apologise for my inability to type in Sanskrit.
Any further elucidation/ correction&nbsp; on the above would be highly beneficial.

Dear ALL, re: Harry Spier?s questions

No.1:
Question of ch/cch

It is clear from our discussions so far that RV  ch, as in gachati, p?chati, chandas, etc.  was a double consonant (as per meter), of whatever exact pronunciation.

Why medieval MSS write simple -ch- is another problem. As this spelling occurs both in RV as well as in old ?aunaka AV and Maitr?ya?? Sa?hit? MSS from Gujarat it seems to reflect a regional ?western? tradition.

Checking some other oldest RV MSS (such as the old Chambers MSS at  Berlin that M. M?ller has used;  see discussion in the attached PDF) would provide a better idea, not to speak of southern MSS that Marco Franceschini*)  has investigated recently. The Kerala usage of -cs- provides a hint.

*)On Some Markers Used in a Grantha Manuscript of the ?gveda Padap??ha Belonging to the Cambridge University Library (Or.2366)<https://www.academia.edu/74531008/On_Some_Markers_Used_in_a_Grantha_Manuscript_of_the_%E1%B9%9Agveda_Padap%C4%81%E1%B9%ADha_Belonging_to_the_Cambridge_University_Library_Or_2366_>

The oldest available Veda MSS (see PDF) of c. 1150 CE, of the V?jasaneyi school, have -cch-, and they go back to a still earlier MS (see Q.2) : VS Sa?hit? 1.16 acchidre?a, or VS Pada: 13.49d  ??g r?cchatu.

(In the margin, note  that old Nepalese MSS often write ?cch- where it is not necessary, as in  Newari cche? for che?).




Which brings us to Q 2 :

The age of written Vedas.

It is generally accepted that our written and recited  (??kala) Rgveda has preserved the old pronunciation ?almost- perfectly, with some early post-RV changes such as -?- > -?- (??e vs. ??ya) or s?var > sv?r  and some ?learned? changes (by the so-called ortho-epic disceuasis).

This tradition, fixed by ?akala?s Padap??ha in the late Br?hma?a period, has been maintained until today  in recitation and writing. All of which is well known and undisputed.

However, we do not have RV MSS of the first millennium CE.

The so far oldest Veda MS,  the Kathmandu VS of c.1150 CE has been copied from a still earlier MS (see discussion in the PDF).

Which brings us close to Albiruni?s (?India transl.SACHAU) statement that shortly before his time (1030 CE), the Kashmiri Brahmin Vasukra had ?for the first time? written down ?the Veda? (RV, Ka?ha Samh.?)

Which falls in line with attested early para-Vedic MSS from Nepal (1040 CE etc.)

However, there are hints of a much older history of writing down the Veda.

The K?nva Sa?hit? of the V?jasaneyi school has some curious spellings that cannot go back to the original V?jasaneyi pronunciation as still evidenced for example in the Kathmandu MS.

 See  PDF ?5:
?.the K??va version of the V?jasaneyi Sa?hit? ...has obvious influence of spelling on the recitation:   can be observed in forms such as tanakmi VSK, tanacmi VSM; yunagmi VSK yunajmi VSM.
We must understand these spellings as being similar to Pai??c? spelling conventions (von Hin?ber: tenuis written for a pronounced intervocalic media).Thus, yunajmi was pronounced [yunaymi] (which is attested in some Vedic texts), but written in ?historical? fashion as | yunagmi |. ?  Such confusion was possible by the 1st cent. BCE, when -g- had become [?] but was written with| y/k/g | and could therefore be confused with older [c] > [j], which was written | j/y |.

THOSE  spellings (of c.50 BCE) have entered the oral AND  medieval written K??va tradition.

However writing down the Veda  was quickly rescinded in ancient/medieval tradition  (such as in the Mahabharata) where writing down the Veda is strictly forbidden.

In short, the ?immutable? Veda tradition is not always as fixed as we usually assume.

Iti v?rtam.

This discussion of paurushetva and apaurusheyatva of the Vedas is not
related to , so a digression from the present relevant topic of primacy of
orality while deciding the 'spelling' of certain
phonetic/phomemic sequences.

Prof. Hock, Hans Henrich brought up the pertinent point of primacy of
orality while deciding the 'spelling'  and Sri Harry Spier too rightly is
focusing his attention on that aspect and trying to know the history /
chronology of the shift from orality alone situation to literate
(oral-literate dual ? ) situation..

???? ?????? ????????? ??? *?????????? *?

.

So , that is the reason , the guru in Pune was apologetic in saying that
the sishyas were using the printed version only tentatively.

I am not a grammarian but I must confess that I do not understand the following passage in this interesting article, which appears to have forgotten that the rules of external sandhi (generally) apply to words forming compounds, and that the sandhi between words forming compounds cannot be rightly called "internal sandhi". I quote:

P??inian grammar records compulsory gemination of ch when preceded by (i) a short vowel in both internal and external sandhis (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.73: ch? ca) as in svacch?y? and tena cchinnam, (ii) the particles ? and m? in both internal and external sandhis (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.74: ??m???o? ca) as in  ? cch?y? and m? cchaits?t (iii) a long vowel in internal sandhi (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.75: d?rgh??t) as in vic?cch?yate. Optional gemination of ch is prescribed only when preceded by a long vowel in an internal sandhi (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.76: pad??nt?d v?) as in m?l? chinn? or m?l? cchinn?. There are not many words in Sanskrit which begin with ch and therefore, as the rules of grammar suggest, a non-conjunct ch is fairly rare.

In (i) the example of "internal sandhi" should have been e.g. gacchati or icchati
(ii) with ? and m? it concerns "external sandhi" only, even if the prefix ? is used in composition
(iii) ok in this case, the K??ik?v?tt? gives the list of verbal forms: hr?cchati, mlecchati, apac?cch?yate, vic?cch?yate (the last two ones made with apa- and vi- on cho 4 P. (chyati, acch?t-acch?s?t, caus. ch?yayati) - McD gives here the subst. mleccha-
(iv) should be corrected into "in an external sandhi", ex. s? chinatti or cchinatti, badar?(c)ch?y? (Renou ?8)

So , that is the reason , the guru in Pune was apologetic in saying that the sishyas were using the printed version only tentatively.

Mr. Hart,
Mahabharata's  'Shantiparva ( 210/19)  specifically mentions the Apaurasheya " nature of the Vedas.

" Hrrishaya MantraDrashtarO

 Na Kaschid Veda Karta cha

SayanaAcharya's commentary on Vedas, too, reflects an identical view

"Josya niswashitam Veda jo VedabhyaAkhilam Jogot. "....

I apologise for my inability to type in Sanskrit.

Any further elucidation/ correction  on the above would be highly beneficial.

Mr. Spier,

What we have learnt from Indological studies, Vedas were never written. We call it "Apaurasheya"... i. e. not written.
The Vedic Mantras came as revealations to the seers( we call them 'Drashta" i. e. one who sees) while in Meditation.
The hymns or mantras were then recited orally and passed on across generations of disciples. who memorised them.
Finally, sage Vyasa arranged a compilation and  divided them among his 4 disciples namely, Poilo, Boishampayan, Jaimini and Sumanta.
Thus we got the 4 Vedas

In the 19th Century, Max Mueller edited the
Vedas.

Alakendu  Das.

Whatever the motivation may be for the spelling with a single <ch> in the Rig Veda (and let?s keep in mind that the ?real? Rig Veda is oral),
1) Can someone point me to some article on when and why the Rg-veda was first written down . what script etc.  Was it a British initiative or was the whole or parts written down before the colonial period?  I've seen in a modern Taittiriya Vedashala the students practicing some of their mantras using  written material.  Did the medieval and later Vedashalas also use written materials to teach their students?

2) Is it possible that this  "Rg-veda written spelling gachati etc." is just a reflection of what was written when the Rg-veda was first written down?

Thanks,

Phillip Maas pointed me to W. Sidney Allen's Sandhi (on archive.org
https://archive.org/details/allensandhi2ndedition1972/page/n43/mode/2up )
He discusses the historical basis for doubling of ch, and what he says
agrees with what has been said on this thread.

Attached are the two relevant pages on vowel+ch .

Thanks for bringing this historical perspective into the conversation, Harry.

A satisfactory explanation of the historical developments probably should start with Burrow (Sanskrit language, 2nd end., 1955, pp 90-95): PIE s?, the source of (c)ch, underwent the general development of *? > ?, resulting in the cluster *s? which was assimilated to *??. This development was parallel to that of *?s, where *? underwent the conditioned change to ? before obstruent; the resulting cluster *?s assimilated to *?? which turned into *??. Subsequent to these changes, *?? and *?? underwent regular contact dissimilation to *c? and *??. The latter underwent different environmentally conditioned changes resulting in final ? and medial k? (with exceptions as the result of analogy and other secondary changes. *c? may have stayed as such in some varieties of Vedic (compare the Kerala MSS). The phonetic cluster *?s would be difficult to distinguish from cch, with the palatal quality of the stop overlapping the aspiration (leading to a palatal voiceless fricative release), so that *c? could be reinterpreted as a voiceless palatal aspirate, and with gemination preserving the coda weight of the preceding syllable. (On this issue see also the following: Hock, Hans Henrich. 1974. Historieal change and synchronic structure: the ease of the Sanskrit root nouns. Towards tomorrow's linguistics, ed. by R. W. Shuy and C-J. N. Bailey, 329-42. Washington: Georgetown University Press. [Reprinted in International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics 3: 321-35 (1974).] Hock, Hans Henrich. 1987. Regular contact dissimilation. A festschrift for Henry Hoenigswald, ed. by George Cardona & Norman Zide, 143-153. Tu?bingen: Narr. A very different view in Kuiper, F B. J. 1967. The Sanskrit nom. sing. vi?. Indo-Iranian Journal 10: 103-25, which however suffers from numerous problems, including apparently being unaware of Burrow?s 1955 proposal.) As I show in my 1987 paper, the dissimilation is sporadically shared for *ss, as in vatsyati from vas- vs. apassu/apa?su. (The irregularity of ss-dissimilation is attributable to the fact that there is a preexisting contrastive ts as in vetsyati from vid-)

All the best,

Hans Henrich

I am not a grammarian but I must confess that I do not understand the following passage in this interesting article, which appears to have forgotten that the rules of external sandhi (generally) apply to words forming compounds, and that the sandhi between words forming compounds cannot be rightly called "internal sandhi". I quote:

P??inian grammar records compulsory gemination of ch when preceded by (i) a short vowel in both internal and external sandhis (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.73: ch? ca) as in svacch?y? and tena cchinnam, (ii) the particles ? and m? in both internal and external sandhis (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.74: ??m???o? ca) as in  ? cch?y? and m? cchaits?t (iii) a long vowel in internal sandhi (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.75: d?rgh??t) as in vic?cch?yate. Optional gemination of ch is prescribed only when preceded by a long vowel in an internal sandhi (A???dhy?y?? 6.1.76: pad??nt?d v?) as in m?l? chinn? or m?l? cchinn?. There are not many words in Sanskrit which begin with ch and therefore, as the rules of grammar suggest, a non-conjunct ch is fairly rare.

In (i) the example of "internal sandhi" should have been e.g. gacchati or icchati
(ii) with ? and m? it concerns "external sandhi" only, even if the prefix ? is used in composition
(iii) ok in this case, the K??ik?v?tt? gives the list of verbal forms: hr?cchati, mlecchati, apac?cch?yate, vic?cch?yate (the last two ones made with apa- and vi- on cho 4 P. (chyati, acch?t-acch?s?t, caus. ch?yayati) - McD gives here the subst. mleccha-
(iv) should be corrected into "in an external sandhi", ex. s? chinatti or cchinatti, badar?(c)ch?y? (Renou ?8)

So , that is the reason , the guru in Pune was apologetic in saying that the sishyas were using the printed version only tentatively.

SayanaAcharya's commentary on Vedas, too, reflects an identical view

I apologise for my inability to type in Sanskrit.

Any further elucidation/ correction  on the above would be highly beneficial.

Mr. Spier,

What we have learnt from Indological studies, Vedas were never written. We call it "Apaurasheya"... i. e. not written.
The Vedic Mantras came as revealations to the seers( we call them 'Drashta" i. e. one who sees) while in Meditation.
The hymns or mantras were then recited orally and passed on across generations of disciples. who memorised them.
Finally, sage Vyasa arranged a compilation and  divided them among his 4 disciples namely, Poilo, Boishampayan, Jaimini and Sumanta.
Thus we got the 4 Vedas

In the 19th Century, Max Mueller edited the
Vedas.

Whatever the motivation may be for the spelling with a single <ch> in the Rig Veda (and let?s keep in mind that the ?real? Rig Veda is oral),
1) Can someone point me to some article on when and why the Rg-veda was first written down . what script etc.  Was it a British initiative or was the whole or parts written down before the colonial period?  I've seen in a modern Taittiriya Vedashala the students practicing some of their mantras using  written material.  Did the medieval and later Vedashalas also use written materials to teach their students?

2) Is it possible that this  "Rg-veda written spelling gachati etc." is just a reflection of what was written when the Rg-veda was first written down?

Thanks,

Dear colleagues,

I want to thank Dominik for sharing this piece and add that the analysis can be extended to the rather closely related Oriya script. The Oriya character which is normally considered to represent "cha" is obviously, from a diachronic perspective, actually geminated "ccha". Just compare the standard printed "cha" as shown at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odia_script> with the various illustrations in Chakraborty et al. 2021.

I have not studied sufficient (Vedic and non-Vedic) manuscripts in Oriya script to know if any developments could be detected in the Oriya tradition itself between earlier and more recent manuscripts but I strongly suspect that if the manuscripts of the Paippal?dasa?hit? (PS) that I have studied tend to use that same geminated form for writing verbs like ????, which should be transliterated gachati by contemporary norms, the scribes may well have intended gacchati. And this possibility increases the further one goes back in time in the written tradition.

For this reason, I think now that what I have written about "Initial and intervocalic ch" on pp. LIX?LX of my 2009 book<https://shs.hal.science/halshs-01917946/document> is to be revised. In short, I now think I was not sufficiently attuned to diachronic developments in script when I affirmed that the Oriya mss. of the PS tend to spell ch instead of expected cch.

From the case of the PS I extrapolate that the entire scholarly perception of "Vedic ch" may be skewed by facts such as these:

(a) the synchronic characteristics and palaeographic backgrounds of the scripts on which editions are based (starting from M?ller's RV edition) are hardly represented in scholarship
(b) comparison is rarely made, if at all, with how non-Vedic Sanskrit manuscripts from the same regional writing traditions on which editions of Vedic texts were based.

I think the issue of "Vedic ?" (for intervocalic ?) must be reconsidered in the same light.

To explain, I imagine that, Max M?ller and his successors in editing Vedic texts actually encountered the same spelling features in the mss. they used for editing the RV and other Vedic texts, as those that were found by other scholars working on classical Sanskrit texts from the same manuscript catchment areas, but that Vedic texts were edited with a lesser tendency to normalize manuscript spellings. And the result was that their editorial choices took a life of their own in subsequent Vedic scholarship as it got ever more detached in the course of the 20th century from the manuscript basis of the textual corpus to which this field of scholarship is devoted.

Or does one really not find intervocalic ? and ? for expected ? and ??? in classical Sanskrit manuscripts from the parts of Northwestern and Western India (notably Maharashtra) where 19th-c. Western scholars sourced their Vedic mss.?

I don't remember the details but I seem to recall that when I read J?rgen Hanneder's stimulating discussion of Max M?ller's RV edition (in his book To edit or not to edit: On textual criticism of Sanskrit works, 2017), I found that considerations such as the above were not adequately addressed.

This discussion of paurushetva and apaurusheyatva of the Vedas is not related to , so a digression from the present relevant topic of primacy of orality while deciding the 'spelling' of certain phonetic/phomemic sequences.

Prof. Hock, Hans Henrich brought up the pertinent point of primacy of orality while deciding the 'spelling'  and Sri Harry Spier too rightly is focusing his attention on that aspect and trying to know the history / chronology of the shift from orality alone situation to literate (oral-literate dual ? ) situation..

So , that is the reason , the guru in Pune was apologetic in saying that the sishyas were using the printed version only tentatively.

Mr. Hart,
Mahabharata's  'Shantiparva ( 210/19)  specifically mentions the Apaurasheya " nature of the Vedas.

" Hrrishaya MantraDrashtarO
   Na tu Bedasya Kartaro"
 Na Kaschid Veda Karta cha

SayanaAcharya's commentary on Vedas, too, reflects an identical view

"Josya niswashitam Veda jo VedabhyaAkhilam Jogot. "....

I apologise for my inability to type in Sanskrit.

Any further elucidation/ correction  on the above would be highly beneficial.

Mr. Spier,

What we have learnt from Indological studies, Vedas were never written. We call it "Apaurasheya"... i. e. not written.
The Vedic Mantras came as revealations to the seers( we call them 'Drashta" i. e. one who sees) while in Meditation.
The hymns or mantras were then recited orally and passed on across generations of disciples. who memorised them.
Finally, sage Vyasa arranged a compilation and  divided them among his 4 disciples namely, Poilo, Boishampayan, Jaimini and Sumanta.
Thus we got the 4 Vedas

In the 19th Century, Max Mueller edited the
Vedas.

Regards

Alakendu  Das.

Whatever the motivation may be for the spelling with a single <ch> in the Rig Veda (and let?s keep in mind that the ?real? Rig Veda is oral),
1) Can someone point me to some article on when and why the Rg-veda was first written down . what script etc.  Was it a British initiative or was the whole or parts written down before the colonial period?  I've seen in a modern Taittiriya Vedashala the students practicing some of their mantras using  written material.  Did the medieval and later Vedashalas also use written materials to teach their students?

2) Is it possible that this  "Rg-veda written spelling gachati etc." is just a reflection of what was written when the Rg-veda was first written down?

Thanks,
Harry Spier

I asked if in the Rg-veda as chanted today, it is gachati or gacchati that
is chanted and Madhav answered that in this youtube recording
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvk2JxmD7zI he  heard gacchati.  But then I
realized I'm not clear what the difference in pronounciation between a
geminate and a non-geminate is.  In other words is the difference in
pronounciation between gachati / gacchati ,  patra / pattra ,  karma /
karmma etc. just that the geminated syllable is held longer than if it was
non-geminated or is it more like gach-ati / gach-chati , pa-tra /pat-tra ,
kar-ma /karm-ma
Thanks,

In a geminate, the consonant duration is longer and is distributed over two syllables; the first part forms the coda of the preceding syllable (and, if the vowel of that syllable is short, make the syllable heavy), the second part is the onset of the following syllable. (A geminate, however, is not a double consonant, in the sense that each part is released; rather the articulatory gesture for the consonant is held constant during the geminate.)

I hope this helps; please excuse the somewhat technical language.

In geminates like ???, according to the Pratishakhyas, the contact in the
first consonant is not released, and the same contact as the first
consonant continues to be held longer till it is released slightly later.
In such cases, the first consonant is called ????????. [?????????

In a geminate, the consonant duration is longer and is distributed over two syllables; the first part forms the coda of the preceding syllable (and, if the vowel of that syllable is short, make the syllable heavy), the second part is the onset of the following syllable. (A geminate, however, is not a double consonant, in the sense that each part is released; rather the articulatory gesture for the consonant is held constant during the geminate.)

I hope this helps; please excuse the somewhat technical language.

In a geminate, the consonant duration is longer and is distributed over two syllables; the first part forms the coda of the preceding syllable (and, if the vowel of that syllable is short, make the syllable heavy), the second part is the onset of the following syllable. (A geminate, however, is not a double consonant, in the sense that each part is released; rather the articulatory gesture for the consonant is held constant during the geminate.)

I hope this helps; please excuse the somewhat technical language.

In other words is the difference in pronounciation between gachati / gacchati ,  patra / pattra ,  karma / karmma etc. just that the geminated syllable is held longer than if it was non-geminated or is it more like gach-ati / gach-chati , pa-tra /pat-tra , kar-ma /karm-ma

Yes, American English. There?s variation there, but dentals tend to lose aspiration in words like that. But I?m from the American south, so maybe it?s just how we talk down there.

American English often changes ?t? to ?d?.

Example: better is pronounced ?bedder?.

get along -> ged along, and thousands more.

Thank you to all the learned voices for this delightful discussion of what
I naively thought was a simple question. And thank you to Arlo Griffiths
who gave a concrete example of the dangers of normalizing editions.  He
wrote:
* . . .* I imagine that, Max M?ller and his successors in editing Vedic
texts actually encountered the same spelling features in the mss. they used
for editing the RV and other Vedic texts, as those that were found by other
scholars working on classical Sanskrit texts from the same manuscript
catchment areas, but that Vedic texts were edited with a lesser tendency to
normalize manuscript spellings. And the result was that their editorial
choices took a life of their own in subsequent Vedic scholarship as it got
ever more detached in the course of the 20th century from the manuscript
basis of the textual corpus to which this field of scholarship is devoted.

To my mind this gives further weight to Dominik Wujastyk's recommendation
in a recent discussion about manuscript transcription standards to produce
a diplomatic transcription along with  an edited/normalized transcription.

I think the problem with normalizing texts was brought up on this list over
25 years ago in a discussion abour critical editions.

I am happy to receive confirmation in this way that my message has come through. Thanks Harry.

I may well be mistaken, in whole or in part, in my appreciation of the issue of spelling features that have been considered as somehow specifically Vedic over the past Indological scholarship. (I noted, as typical example, Allen's parenthetic and unquestioning "except in the RV" in the pages that were recently shared.) I feel pretty confident for the case of the Paippal?dasa?hit? but this text has had a predominantly written transmission over the past millennium or more and its transmission has not been controlled by normative texts like pr?ti??khyas. The case of the RV and other Vedic texts with a strong oral tradition plus pr?ti??khya may be different. As long as we don't have a representative sample of digitized manuscripts of the RV (and other texts) from a representative range of regional writing traditions, I suppose we will never know which of the ostensibly "special" spellings would survive in a critical edition that attempts to live up to today's standards and attempts to juggle the evidence of written and oral tradition in such a way as to render both visible to readers (and, why not, listeners).

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

 philosophy and book search
Message-ID: <e07e8c55-7a61-4f6b-80eb-314676b0644d@uni-hamburg.de>

Kind list,

may I ask for your assistance in locating a PDF of an article by H. L. 
Jain: 'The Jain and the Sahajay?na schools of Yoga philosophy' in: 
Maheswar Neog (ed.): Proceedings and Transactions of the All India 
Oriental Conference, No. 22,? Gauhati, Assam ; January 1965? Our library 
has a copy, but due to a holiday it will take them until the end of next 
week to deliver it for takeout.

I am also searching for a copy of the /?r?sambodhapa?c?sik?disangraha/, 
?r? Digambara Jaina B?sa panth? mandira N?gaura, ?r? Di. Jaina Sam?ja, 
1977. A search in the Jain e library was not successful. Maybe I didn't 
spell it as needed.

Any hints in locating these items are highly appreciated! I still have 
so many things to learn.

Thank you and best wishes,

Corinna May Lhoir

Yes, the last work of my dear friend, the gifted art historian Prof. Kavita
Singh, who passed away on July 30, just before the MAP show was to go up.
Her final lecture, delivered on July 15 in New Delhi, described this
illustrated Ramcharitmanas from Banaras and told of how she had put the
show together over several years of research. The exhibition is co-curated
by her former student Parul Singh, but Kavita finished writing the wall
text just weeks before she passed away. A must-see, for all those
interested in North Indian courtly painting, book culture and manuscript
illumination.

Here?s the lecture ?

Message-ID: <CANJQKUOyoE7g7KuSpkjGXu2m+zbMCDDsCP1NehAz0MSjEPDinA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Indologists,

Does anyone have a PDF copy of Dh??: A Review Of Rare Buddhist Texts, vol.
19? It looks like Archive only has the first 18 volumes.

I can request soft copies of individual articles through my library.
However, I am interested in multiple articles from vol. 19, so it would be
nice to have the full issue.

Thank you in advance!

Dear Indologists,

Do any of you have some knowledge of an online subscription service called Perlego that claims access to millions of books in pdf format? They seem to have a fair amount of German Indology not readily available elsewhere, among much else. I would welcome your comments on any experience of this service that you may have had.

I became aware of them after being directed to one of my own books on their site this morning - I do not know if it is there legally - while I was in fact searching for something else.

thanks in advance for your thoughts,
Matthew

Message-ID: <99bc4c2d-02a2-4e0b-965f-38bf52acbf24@gmail.com>

Dear Members of the List,

In 1955 a V?japeya performance was filmed in Poona.

Part of this documentary can be seen on Youtube (with horrible 
watermarks) here: https://youtu.be/0ApJctw4LPs?si=McDghQC-4QjbRDCk.

I have looked for the whole film a little bit everywhere on the Net but 
came up empty handed. It is not available on archive.org. I looked also 
in the BBC archives, as it seems to have been produced in GB, but found 
nothing. It also seems to be unavailable in India, at least from 
Google's point of view.

Does anyone know if a full copy of this documentary is available 
somewhere, if possible for free (and without watermarks) as I shall use 
it for educational purposes?

Any help much welcomed.

Yours sincerely,

F. Voegeli

*Sex in Translation*

International Conference


London, 4-5 July 2024


Writing about sex challenges and exposes the limits of what can and cannot
be said in any given culture. It blurs the boundaries between different
forms of discourse ? literary, legal, social, medical, and philosophical.
And, of course, it crosses boundaries too ? of taste and class as well as
of time and space. So how does sex translate from one language and culture
to another? What does the translation, circulation and reception of sexual
material, from pornographic novels to *ars erotica* and clinical textbooks,
tell us about the ways we have thought, learned, and fantasized about sex?


This international conference will explore the ways in which sex has been
translated from one culture to another, and welcome scholars and
practitioners from a range of disciplines, including comparative literary
studies, translation studies, book history, medical humanities and the
social sciences. Contributions are welcome on literature and culture from
around the world, and from any historical period, and we encourage
proposals that are ambitious in scope, e.g. that explore a corpus rather
than a single work.


Papers should touch on one or more of the following areas:

? National and transnational networks of translators, publishers and/or
readers

? The history of the (sex-)book

? The reception of erotica and sexology in translation

? Translating gender, gendering translation

? Trans and Translation

? Translating bodies

? Translation and affect

? Translation and transgression

? Obscenity and censorship

? Untranslatable sex

? Sexing translation

? Eroticism and exoticism


We welcome proposals (250 words max.) for papers and panels engaging with
these themes. Abstracts with a short biographical note should be emailed to
Will McMorran (QMUL) at w.s.mcmorran at qmul.ac.uk and to Maddalena Italia
(UCL) at m.italia at ucl.ac.uk. The deadline for proposals is 8th December
2023.

Dear James,

I am not sure that I understand the force of "popular" in your heading,
but one place to begin might be David Pingree, Jyoti???stra (1981), in A History of Indian Literature, vol. VI, fasc. 4. It's quite dense, but encompasses a great range of information on astrology, mathematics, and divination, much of it from the period that interests you.

good luck!
Matthew

Prof Hegarty,
Rev. Ebenezer Burgess's translation (1860) of "Surya-Siddhanta" by BrahmaGupta( 7th Cent AD) may be useful source, to begin with, though I am not sure whether it is a "Popular" one.
