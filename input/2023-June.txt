Dear colleagues,

Could anyone help me obtain pdf of the following?

Wijk, Walter Emile van. 1938. Decimal Tables for the Reduction of Hindu Dates from the Data of the S?rya-Siddh?nta. The Hague: M. Nijhoff.

I also require pdf of the same author's "On Hindu Chronology", which seems to have appeared in installments of Acta Orientalia, I (1923), p. 206; II (1924), p. 55; III (1924),p. 236; IV (1926), p. 55; V (1927), p. 1. I am not sure my bibliographic reference is correct.

Thanks a lot!

Dear colleagues,

members of this list might be interested to know or be reminded that all 
volumes of the "Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft" 
from its beginning in 1847 until 2019 (vol. 169) are freely accessible in digital 
format (PDF) at the following web address: 

https://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/structure/2327 

According to a positive decision taken recently by the Harrassowitz Verlag, the 
moving wall delay for the ZDMG was reduced from five to three years only. In 
other words, with the exception for the last three years, all other volumes of 
the journal of the German Oriental Society are made freely available. I hope 
that you will appreciate this news and will make good use of it.

Kind regards,
Dragomir Dimitrov

Thank you very much for the response, Mrinal. Yeah, it seems to be just a
choice of the scribe. The Kashmiri Devanagari manuscripts have the same
symbol for om [image: image.png]
, and not the usual one like ?.
Here for example:

I wish we get a Unicode character for this symbol.

*Migration and Transformation in Religious Education in Contemporary Jain
Society*



Migration has had a sizable impact on Jain religious education but remained
understudied until recently. In this talk, Dr. Shivani Bothra will examine
the following three forms of migration experienced by Jain communities: (1)
the suburbanization of Digambar Jains in Jaipur leading to the revival of
traditional *pathshala*s in the suburbs; (2) the regional migration of
Shvetambar Terapanthis across India resulting in the development of
*gyanshala*s; and (3) the international migration of Jains to America,
which has presented unique challenges, requiring a focus on Jain *pathshala*s
to transmit traditional cultural values while assimilating into a new
environment. This migration-driven transformation in religious education
has also resulted in unintended consequences, particularly the emergence of
women as leaders in a traditionally male-dominated area of religious
education. Shedding light on the common themes across the three forms of
religious education and the uniqueness of each migration, Dr. Bothra will
also highlight the resulting shifts from traditional to contemporary
religious education for Jain children both in India and abroad.



*Dr. Shivani Bothra* is an Assistant Professor in the Religious Studies
Department at California State University, Long Beach. Dr. Bothra obtained
her doctorate from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, where
she focused on the significance of religious education for children as a
means of preserving Jain values and culture for future generations.
Expanding upon her doctoral research, her current work explores the changes
in religious education within the lay community and how technology
contributes to shaping contemporary Jainism and transnational Jain
communities. Dr. Bothra is also engaged in a study that examines how lay
Jains incorporate the principles of *anek?ntav?da* (the doctrine of
non-one-sidedness) and *aparigraha* (non-possessiveness) into their daily
practices in addition to exploring their involvement in nonviolent
movements that transcend religious boundaries.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Revision of ISO 15919 (transliteration of Indic scripts)
Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAJUXjonNDgtBrQCSbQitxAHCgAAAEAAAAOZJzhNDlNhJsZuZ9Ww+n3IBAAAAAA==@matfyz.cz>

Dear all,

last week ISO/TC 46 decided to revise ISO 15919:2001, currently called ?Information and documentation ? Transliteration of Devanagari and related Indic scripts into Latin characters?. This standard currently specifies the transliteration rules for Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Sinhala. Like with any recent revision of a transliteration standard, one of the tasks of the revision is to formalize the rules using Unicode codepoints.

I imagine many users or potential users of the standard are in this group and I would like to invite everyone to share their feedback on this standard and learn how it could be updated to better serve the community. I am aware for example casing and case sensitivity has been brought up in the past in this group. Other possible improvements include covering more Indic scripts and/or standardization of transcribing historical texts, manuscripts, epigraphy etc.

Feel free to respond to me offline or online with your concerns and suggestions or if you would be interested in participating in a working group regarding this revision.

Thank you and best regards,
Jan Ku?era

Message-ID: <AS8PR10MB7326D46CDD90B04A54BC397BA54FA@AS8PR10MB7326.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear colleagues,

For several years now I have observed colleagues publishing their monographs or edited volumes with Routledge, asking myself why any colleague should wish to entrust such a ruthlessly profit-oriented enterprise with their scholarly work, while there are more sympathetic commercial publishers not to mention quite a number of non-commercial publishers willing and able to publish Indological research.

Anyhow, I wish to report a concrete bad experience. Several colleagues participating in the ERC project DHARMA have contributed to a volume published earlier this year in the Routledge Worlds series. Since the ERC requires research produced thanks to its funding to appear in Open Access, it seemed necessary to us to accept paying the publisher's Open Access fees in order to ensure that the contributions by said colleagues would appear in Open Access. My employer has paid ?3.750,00 funding to the publisher late last year as "Fees for making three chapters Open Access in the book The Angkorian
World." See the attachment. From the budget of the ERC project Archaeospace, initiated by my colleague Damian Evans (incidentally, one of the editors of the volume), we paid the same sum once more for three other chapters, though I was not involved in that decision. The book was published on 28 April (https://www.routledge.com/The-Angkorian-World/Hendrickson-Stark-Evans/p/book/9780815355953) and yet not a single chapter has so far been made available in Open Access by the publisher. They would seem to have taken European tax payers' money and run with it.

Yesterday one of the editors wrote to me: "I received word from Routledge that they are working on making the six chapters open access. I am not sure why this is taking so long but it is pretty much par for the course with this publishing house. Avoid them in the future is my advice." I could not agree more with this advice.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

Dear Indology List,
I am hoping that somebody could send me a high-quality pdf of the article "The Bhale symbol of the Jainas" by Gouriswar Bhattacharya, published in Berliner indologische Studien vol. 8 (1995), pp. 201-222.

There exists a scan of the article online at Academia.edu, but the quality of some of the pages is low, making it somewhat hard to read it. Also, I hope to get a better quality scan of the illustrations at the end of the article, if possible. The Academia.edu page is here:

The Australian National University Press (ANU Press) is a leading open-access publisher.  They don't charge to publish book per se, but they do require authors to use one of their approved copy-editors.  I have followed this path twice - both for 500-page volumes. The total cost for each volume was about US$4000.

Hope this helps

Subject: [INDOLOGY] about Routledge and Open Access fees

Dear colleagues,

For several years now I have observed colleagues publishing their monographs or edited volumes with Routledge, asking myself why any colleague should wish to entrust such a ruthlessly profit-oriented enterprise with their scholarly work, while there are more sympathetic commercial publishers not to mention quite a number of non-commercial publishers willing and able to publish Indological research.

Anyhow, I wish to report a concrete bad experience. Several colleagues participating in the ERC project DHARMA have contributed to a volume published earlier this year in the Routledge Worlds series. Since the ERC requires research produced thanks to its funding to appear in Open Access, it seemed necessary to us to accept paying the publisher's Open Access fees in order to ensure that the contributions by said colleagues would appear in Open Access. My employer has paid ?3.750,00 funding to the publisher late last year as "Fees for making three chapters Open Access in the book The Angkorian
World." See the attachment. From the budget of the ERC project Archaeospace, initiated by my colleague Damian Evans (incidentally, one of the editors of the volume), we paid the same sum once more for three other chapters, though I was not involved in that decision. The book was published on 28 April (https://www.routledge.com/The-Angkorian-World/Hendrickson-Stark-Evans/p/book/9780815355953) and yet not a single chapter has so far been made available in Open Access by the publisher. They would seem to have taken European tax payers' money and run with it.

Yesterday one of the editors wrote to me: "I received word from Routledge that they are working on making the six chapters open access. I am not sure why this is taking so long but it is pretty much par for the course with this publishing house. Avoid them in the future is my advice." I could not agree more with this advice.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

The Angkorian World<https://www.routledge.com/The-Angkorian-World/Hendrickson-Stark-Evans/p/book/9780815355953>
The Angkorian World explores the history of Southeast Asia?s largest ancient state from the first to mid-second millennium CE. Chapters by leading scholars combine evidence from archaeology, texts, and the natural sciences to introduce the Angkorian state, describe its structure, and explain its persistence over more than six centuries. Comprehensive and accessible, this book will be an indispensable resource for anyone studying premodern Asia. The volume?s first of six sections provides his

We had a very good experience publishing our Pu?pik? volume with HASP 
<https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/?lang=en>. They are an open access 
publisher focusing on Asian studies. They do not charge OA fees, 
organize peer review on request, and offer printed versions as print on 
demand for a very moderate fee. More details on their services: 
https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/publishing/for_authors.


Further fair open access (FOA) options are collected at the FOASAS 
website, run by Dominik Haas and myself: https://foasas.org/#journals. 
If you know of any other good OA publishers not yet listed here please 
get in contact with us.


Best wishes,
Vitus Angermeier

Indeed interesting. Just curious to know how they "organize peer review on
request"...

I do not know the exact details about their peer review process but I 
know that they offer p.r., if the authors of a submitted volume request 
it, because I recently reviewed a book for them. They also allow for 
open peer review, if both the authors and the reviewers approve of this 
mode. In the case of our collected volume we took care of the double 
blind peer review process for the individual articles ourselves.
If you have further questions please simply get in touch with them. In 
my experience, they are quite ready to help.

Best,
Vitus

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devanagari v and b in Kashmiri manuscripts again
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o8Gc3R-aju1k-Ahc6sAynOd5iCe-eY=8WV4A=pJJGb-MA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
Since the discussion about devanagari v and b in Kashmiri manuscripts a few
months ago, I've been looking at some devanagari manuscripts from the
Ragunath temple in Jammu in more detail.

In the ?nande?varapaddhati? and the bagalamukh?pa?ca?gam the scribe writes
? for  ? almost all the time, but the few cases where he writes *?*
for *?*  seem
deliberate.
The ?nande?varapaddhati? is the strangest case. In the whole manuscript of
206 folios  there are only 4 cases where *?*  was written for *?* There was
one case of the b?jamantra *ba?* but the other three cases  were all for
declensions of the same word  *bahukh?daka* in widely separated folios. (
*bahukh?daka* was also written in the manuscript as  *vahukh?daka* 5
times).
Any explanations about why the scribe took the care to write the word
*bahukh?daka* correctly a few times and only took the care in those places
would be greatly appreciated.  If anyone wants more details (link to
manuscript, folio numbers etc.I can supply those .

In  the bagalamukh?pa?ca?gam where the scribe writes "b" for "b" seems more
understandable. Again he writes "v" for "b" most of the time.  But the
cases where he takes the care to write "b" for "b" are in the names of
deities or words related to deities.
He wrote: bagal?mukh? 21 times (but vagal?mukh? 31 times) and bradhn?,
brahmaputr?, trya?baka, a?buja, p?t??bar?, brahm?stra. As far as I could
see he wrote "v" for "b" for the rest of the manuscript except for the
 b?jamantra
ba? .

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear colleagues,

I have a brief question regarding the interpretation of a passage in the 
Mahabh?rata. In II 69.15, as the P??d?avas are about to go into exile, 
Vidura says to Yudhi??hira:

/pur?ravasam aila? tva? buddhy? jayasi p???ava/ /
?With (your) resolve/intellect, you surpass Pur?ravas Aila, O P??d?ava!?

As I understand it, this means that Yudhi??hira?s /buddhi /is greater 
than Pur?ravas?s. Pur?ravas is of course well known for his affair with 
the /apsaras /Urva??; I wonder, however, what /buddhi /refers to here. 
How would you interpret this passage?

Below I attach MBh II 69.11?16 and Van Buitenen?s translation.

Thank you for your time and best regards

Dear Dominik,

It seems to me that Pur?ravas is mentioned here simply as a person who is
famous for his buddhi. As was just pointed out, he is elsewhere associated
with r?jadharma. The story about his affair with Urva?? does not seem to be
relevant here.

The meaning of buddhi in this passage is unclear, but I suspect that it
means something like stoic wisdom, namely, a wisdom that allows Yudhi??hira
avoid suffering in exile and thereby retain capacity for action when the
exile ends and it is time to retake the kingdom.

This interpretation is in harmony with the earlier mention of sam?dhi,
which here seems to mean something like "composure" and with another
previous statement in Vidura's speech: 02,069.007c n?dharme?a jita? ka? cid
vyathate vai par?jay?t (Van Buitenen: "No one who has been defeated against
the Law should suffer from his defeat.")

There are a number of Mah?bh?rata passages where buddhi is a means of
overcoming suffering. This is discussed in chapters 4 and 5 of my
unpublished thesis "Ascetic Teachings for Householder Kings in the
Mah?bh?rata", which I would be happy to share off-list. For now, here is
one relevant reference that mentions buddhi and the same verb as Vidura
(i.e., vyathate):

12,105.012a purast?d eva te buddhir iya? k?ry? vij?nata?
12,105.012c anitya? sarvam evedam aha? ca mama c?sti yat
12,105.013a yat ki? cin manyase 'st?ti sarva? n?st?ti viddhi tat
12,105.013c eva? na vyathate pr?j?a? k?cchr?m apy ?pada? gata?

Van Buitenen's translation of buddhi as "resolve" is probably inspired by
the vyavas?y?tmik? buddhi? of Bhagavadg?t? 2.41. While buddhi does appear
to be related to resolve in this passage, I understand that it is
Yudhi??hira's understanding of dharma that is the basis of his composure
and resolve.

These two papers on buddhi may also be useful:
"Saving Buddhis" in Epic "Mok?adharma" by James L. Fitzgerald ;
International Journal of Hindu Studies Vol. 19, No. 1/2, Special Issue:
Studies in Honor of Edwin Gerow (APRIL?AUGUST 2015), pp. 97-137

The Buddhi in Early Epic "Adhy?tma" Discourse (the Dialog of Manu and
"B?haspati") by James L. Fitzgerald ; Journal of Indian Philosophy Vol. 45,
No. 4, Special Issue on Locating Philosophy in the Mah?bh?rata (September
2017), pp. 767-816

Best wishes,
Valters

Perhaps significant is that Pururavas is a son of Budha, e.g. in the Visnu Purana.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Pur?ravas?s buddhi in MBh II 69.15

Dear Dominik,

It seems to me that Pur?ravas is mentioned here simply as a person who is famous for his buddhi. As was just pointed out, he is elsewhere associated with r?jadharma. The story about his affair with Urva?? does not seem to be relevant here.

The meaning of buddhi in this passage is unclear, but I suspect that it means something like stoic wisdom, namely, a wisdom that allows Yudhi??hira avoid suffering in exile and thereby retain capacity for action when the exile ends and it is time to retake the kingdom.

This interpretation is in harmony with the earlier mention of sam?dhi, which here seems to mean something like "composure" and with another previous statement in Vidura's speech: 02,069.007c n?dharme?a jita? ka? cid vyathate vai par?jay?t (Van Buitenen: "No one who has been defeated against the Law should suffer from his defeat.")

There are a number of Mah?bh?rata passages where buddhi is a means of overcoming suffering. This is discussed in chapters 4 and 5 of my unpublished thesis "Ascetic Teachings for Householder Kings in the Mah?bh?rata", which I would be happy to share off-list. For now, here is one relevant reference that mentions buddhi and the same verb as Vidura (i.e., vyathate):

12,105.012a purast?d eva te buddhir iya? k?ry? vij?nata?
12,105.012c anitya? sarvam evedam aha? ca mama c?sti yat
12,105.013a yat ki? cin manyase 'st?ti sarva? n?st?ti viddhi tat
12,105.013c eva? na vyathate pr?j?a? k?cchr?m apy ?pada? gata?

Van Buitenen's translation of buddhi as "resolve" is probably inspired by the vyavas?y?tmik? buddhi? of Bhagavadg?t? 2.41. While buddhi does appear to be related to resolve in this passage, I understand that it is Yudhi??hira's understanding of dharma that is the basis of his composure and resolve.

These two papers on buddhi may also be useful:
"Saving Buddhis" in Epic "Mok?adharma" by James L. Fitzgerald ; International Journal of Hindu Studies Vol. 19, No. 1/2, Special Issue: Studies in Honor of Edwin Gerow (APRIL?AUGUST 2015), pp. 97-137

The Buddhi in Early Epic "Adhy?tma" Discourse (the Dialog of Manu and "B?haspati") by James L. Fitzgerald ; Journal of Indian Philosophy Vol. 45, No. 4, Special Issue on Locating Philosophy in the Mah?bh?rata (September 2017), pp. 767-816

Best wishes,
Valters

Le 5 juin 2023 ? 09:41, Dr. Dominik A. Haas, BA MA <dominik at haas.asia<mailto:dominik at haas.asia>> a ?crit :


Dear colleagues,

I have a brief question regarding the interpretation of a passage in the Mahabh?rata. In II 69.15, as the P??d?avas are about to go into exile, Vidura says to Yudhi??hira:

pur?ravasam aila? tva? buddhy? jayasi p???ava /
?With (your) resolve/intellect, you surpass Pur?ravas Aila, O P??d?ava!?

As I understand it, this means that Yudhi??hira?s buddhi is greater than Pur?ravas?s. Pur?ravas is of course well known for his affair with the apsaras Urva??; I wonder, however, what buddhi refers to here. How would you interpret this passage?

Below I attach MBh II 69.11?16 and Van Buitenen?s translation.

Thank you for your time and best regards

Message-ID: <CAEjEOsDYBo1iiSDc5nRTNw2gP4R7oV1LRP7LwipKSzDvjPd50w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I know that a number of you have been using my textbook, *The Cambridge
Introduction to Sanskrit*, with your students. Given the book's popularity,
Cambridge University Press have expressed their interest in a new edition.
This means: in addition to inputting the corrections of typos and mistakes
I have been hoping to make (many of them kindly pointed out to me by you or
your students!), I will also be able to make more substantive changes, as
well as additions.

If any of you have suggestions on how to make the book better, ideas for
what to add, subtract, change, I'd be very grateful if you could send me a
brief note. Please feel free to be direct - criticism is very welcome:-)!
(Some thoughts so far: the n?gar? needs to be larger, Chapter 21 is
unclear, the readings at the end of each chapter should come from a larger
variety of sources, an alternative 'long' reading at the end would be good,
the reference grammar in the back could be extended.)

Many thanks, as always,
    Antonia

I would love ? (r underdot) to be formally defined in ISO 15919 to
represent vocalic ?, mutatis mutandis, as well as the Library of Congress's
r-undercircle.  In other words, the IAST code.

Similarly, ?  as well as m-overdot for anusv?ra.

Dear Colleagues,

I am happy to announce that the University of Toronto Mississauga will host its third annual Summer School on the Languages and Literatures of Jainism between August 14 and 18, 2023. Those interested in participating may do so either in-person or via zoom. If you know of anyone who may be interested in attending, please pass along the announcement that is pasted below.

If there are any questions about the summer school, please do not hesitate to be in touch!

Best wishes,
Tim Lorndale


_________________________


The University of Toronto is pleased to announce that its Third Annual Summer School on the Languages and Literatures of Jainism will be held between August 14th and 18th 2023 on the Mississauga campus. The primary mode of instruction will be in-person, but we will accommodate people who wish to attend online. This year?s summer school will focus on Jain Prakrit from the first millennium of the common era. Participants will read both literary works by poets like Haribhadras?ri, P?litta and ??l??ka, as well as exegetical and doxographic literature, such as the Niryukti (Nijjutti) tradition of the ?vet?mbaras and Dar?anas?ra of the Digambara author Devasena.

Professor Andrew Ollett of the University of Chicago will be leading our reading sessions. Professor Ollett is a specialist of Indian literature and intellectual history, and works across several languages, including Prakrit, Sanskrit, and Kannada. His first monograph, The Language of the Snakes (UC Press, 2017), is a critical study of Prakrit?s place in Indian literary culture. He also recently published a translation of Ko?hala?s Prakrit romance, the L?l?va? (Murty Classical Library, 2021). Dr. Heleen de Jonckheere, Lecturer in South Asian Religions at SOAS, University of London, will also lead reading sessions, guiding our study of the Digambara materials. Dr. de Jonckheere?s research focuses on translation in Jain literature, as well as manuscript culture. She has done extensive work on the Dharmapar?k?? tradition. She is also the co-editor of a forthcoming volume entitled Pure Soul: The Jaina Spiritual Traditions. Professor Aleksandra Restifo, the Bhagavan Mahavir Assistant Professor of Jain Studies at Florida International University, will also lend us her expertise in Prakrit literature, leading sessions on ??l??ka?s Cauppanamah?purisacariya. Professor Restifo is a specialist of Prakrit and Sanskrit literatures, and has published on topics such as, Jain dramatic literature, aesthetic theory, and the history of emotions in Jain literary and ritual materials. She will also present new research at the summer school about the use of upam?- and vyatireka-?le?a in the works of poets like ??l??ka.

There will be two reading sessions each day: one in the morning and another in the afternoon. The focus will be Prakrit narrative literature in the morning, and exegetical texts in the afternoon. While prior study of Prakrit is not required, participants should have an intermediate to advanced knowledge of Sanskrit. Materials relating to Prakrit grammar will be circulated prior to the start of the summer school. It is important that participants review these beforehand so that we may make the most of our week together.

The summer school itself is free to attend, and there will be funding available for room and board for a limited number of applicants from outside the Greater Toronto Area. We also ask that all in-person participants be fully vaccinated.

Those interested in attending this year?s summer school should send their CV and a statement of interest of about 200 words via email. Please make sure to mention whether you wish to attend in-person or at a distance. Applications are due by June 20th.

Please contact Timothy Lorndale ( timothy.lorndale at utoronto.ca<mailto:timothy.lorndale at utoronto.ca> ) to apply to the summer school or for any further information.

 To download a  pdf of the current ISO 15919  standard (a 30 page document)
costs 145 Swiss francs = 160 US dollars. I'm wondering if this is one of
the reasons that most people use IAST for transliterated Sanskrit.  The

Thanks, Harry, but while writing my ???????????????, which goes back to
mid-1980s, I did not consult "ISO 15919 standard" or any such documents. I
was following, what seemed to me at the time, to be the prevalent practice.
If my memory serves me correctly, to use r?,  r??, l?, with small circles
under r and l, I was influenced by Wackernagel's Altindische Grammatik. I
had used the same in designing my diacritics font Manjushree-CSX. While the
ancient fonts used for the ??????????????? going back to mid-1980s and the
pre-Unicode Manjushree-CSX are no longer usable, I am generally continuing
to use these diacritics today. Probably just by acquired habit.

Thank you for the clarification Madhav.  Since your book predates the 15919
standard, I'm wondering what sanskrit  books after creation of the 15919
standard have chosen it over the IAST standard.  The two Clay Sanskrit
library books I have use the  IAST transliteration scheme and as far as I
can see the Sanskrit etexts in GRETIL also use IAST.  Muktabodha uses IAST.

I can no longer resist chiming in; apologies for rambling and for stating
what may be obvious.
The IAST scheme is indeed much more widely used, but I am not at all sure
if future standards should be based on precedent and if counting the number
of existing publications using one standard or another is any help. I think
there are two main reasons why IAST is widely used. One, as Harry Spier has
pointed out, is that the ISO standards are not openly accessible. Without
having any insight into the workings of ISO standards in general, as a
layman I find this frankly ridiculous and if Jan Ku?era can apply any
pressure to change this, this restriction should be lifted. The other
principal reason is that characters with an undercircle are supported only
by a very small number of fonts, and even some that do support such
combinations render them poorly. It is thus much more convenient for
everyone, authors to publishers, to stick to underdots (which my spell
checker immediately changed to underdogs!).
That said, there are good reasons *against* IAST too, primarily ambiguity.
That is to say, R and L with an underdot are suitable for representing
vocalic R and L only so long as you are dealing with classical standard
Sanskrit. As soon as Vedic enters the picture, you might use l+underdot for
the retroflex flap as well as for the vocalic L. The retroflex L is also
present in Dravidian languages and Marathi, and in many regional Sanskrit
manuscripts and inscriptions. There is also the (different?) retroflex flap
used e.g. in Hindi and normally transliterated with r+underdot. According
to Wikipedia, IAST uses ? (l with line below) for the former kind of
retroflex flap and I have no idea if it uses anything for the latter kind.
That could work, but then how do we transliterate the retroflex central
approximant (?) of some Dravidian languages? One could argue that this is
not required, because we are talking about Sanskrit transliteration. But
ideally, a transliteration system for Sanskrit ought to be able to
transliterate (unambiguously) any language written in a Br?hm?-derived
script. With this, I am entering murky waters and I would rather not go
much further; it would be too much to hope for a system that can really do
this, but perhaps supporting the major modern and premodern languages of
South and Southeast Asia is not a dream. It is theoretically also possible
to agree on language-dependent standards, as is already the case for
instance with e and o, which (in IAST and in a permitted optional variant
of ISO15919) represent long vowels in Sanskrit, but short vowels in
Dravidian languages. The DHARMA project has chosen to follow (and expand
upon) the ISO standard primarily for this reason, because it is better
suited for a textual corpus in a variety of languages.
As for anusv?ra as m with overdot or underdot, it seems largely a question
of taste. That said, there is a good rationale for not choosing the
underdot, which it implies some commonality either with vocalic trills or
with retroflex consonants.
On the whole, one question we must ask ourselves is which situation we
would rather live with: the chaos involved in introducing a new standard
that will not immediately, if ever, become the number one global standard -
or the chaos involved in maintaining multiple standards in parallel. Those
who work primarily or only with classical standard Sanskrit may prefer the
latter, as they are not really affected by its drawbacks.
Another relevant question is what can be done to improve and propagate any
standard. IAST is not being actively maintained at all beyond a vague
implicit consensus of scholars using it. It is not even a standard in fact,
just a set of conventions that are clearly defined at the centre, but loose
at the periphery: whenever phonemes outside the ambit of classical standard
Sanskrit come into the picture, authors (and/or publishers) seem to choose
transliterations inconsistently on the basis of conventions found in
earlier publications and of whatever diacritical marks they can produce on
their systems. Given that ISO15919 is actively maintained, and is now to be
reconsidered with the involvement of the scholarly user community, this may
be a good time to settle on something that most of us are willing and able
to follow in the future*.*
I personally would certainly be happy to jump on the ISO bandwagon
*provided* that the revised ISO standard will actually be made known to the
public, and not accessible only to those who pay an exorbitant price for
it, get a pirated copy, or rely on incomplete extracts such as that on
Wikipedia. But even then, I think one of the considerations in revising the
standard should be a preference for character combinations that can
actually be displayed properly in more than just a few fonts.

Dear All,

A quick note: Titus does not use IAST (see the r?, and the aspirates):

agn?m ??e pur?hita? yaj??sya dev?m r?tv?jam /

h?t?ra? ratnad???tamam //

agn?? p??rveb?ir ???ib?ir ???yo n??tanair ut? /

etc.

Here is the source information: "On the basis of the edition by Th. 
Aufrecht, Bonn 1877 (2.Aufl.), entered by H.S. Ananthanarayana, Austin / 
Texas;
TITUS version with corrections by Fco.J. Mart?nez Garc?a, synoptically 
arranged with the metrically restored version by B. van Nooten and G. 
Hollandand the "Padap?tha" version by A. Lubotsky,

Dear all,

 

It is my anecdotal impression that IAST/ALA-LC is more used in the U.S. where the ISO transliteration standards are not very known, while in Europe, the ISO schemes generally happen to be followed, regardless of whether people had actually seen the standard or not. I would think that the standard can be found in or requested from a university library. You can also reach out to your national standardisation body and ask for the ISO standard to be adopted as a national standard. Depending on your NB licensing model, this might or might not make it more accessible to you.

 

Unfortunately, I have don?t have any leverage on the ISO licensing policies and no experts in the committee receive any money from the sales of the standard or ISO in general. Traditionally I believe the standardisation model works on the premise that an industry following a standard will benefit enough from it to not only offset the purchase costs but also invest in developing it. Clearly that model does not work for academia. Unicode has expressed an interest in having a machine-readable data file for the transliteration standards and I am currently exploring how this could be done procedurally and what license would that come with, but I cannot promise anything at this point.

 

> I think one of the considerations in revising the standard should be a preference for character combinations that can actually be displayed properly in more than just a few fonts.

 

You can also look at it the other way round ? having a standard define a set of characters to use gives you some leverage and go to font vendors or OS vendors and say ?we need these characters to be supported, this standard mandates their usage?.

 

While I am sympathetic to take usability factor into consideration and in particular I do support dots below for vocalic r and l, I want to point out that there is a lot of bad fonts out there especially for Indic scripts and I would be cautious about trying to accommodate to bad practices.

 

Best regards,

Jan

Thank you for the clarification Madhav.  Since your book predates the 15919 standard, I'm wondering what sanskrit  books after creation of the 15919 standard have chosen it over the IAST standard.  The two Clay Sanskrit library books I have use the  IAST transliteration scheme and as far as I can see the Sanskrit etexts in GRETIL also use IAST.  Muktabodha uses IAST.

I just looked at the Mahabharata in the TITUS collection and it appears to
use undercircle for vocalic r and l etc. like ISO 15919  but m underdot for
anusvara like IAST.

It's the Indo-Europeanist tradition (undercircle marks vocalic r, l etc. 
while underdot has another function).

Subject: [INDOLOGY] CFP: Argumentation in World Religious Traditions,
 Including Legal Traditions, Sinaia, Sept 3-8,
 2023 - Extended Deadline June 17
Message-ID: <CA+tQJSg7WD3DFMFoL9aD878gSt9+Dv7D5ycWxa+j59GYapEg9g@mail.gmail.com>

Workshop organised by Agnieszka Rostalska, Ghent University
Keynote Speaker: Douglas L. Berger, Leiden University
event page: https://4wocolor.pl/?w=14#w

Formalized approaches to philosophical argumentation, conducted in specific
genres of debate, were developed in most World Religious Traditions, and
are not at all exclusively distinctive of ?Western? philosophical
disputation.

This workshop, part of the 4th World Congress on Logic and Religion,
explores cross-cultural perspectives on argumentation, specifically, those
that governed how different traditions engaged in philosophical debates.

Suggested topics include - but are not limited to - the following:

   - Argumentation - the epistemic standards of rational reflection;
   - Application of argumentative techniques for understanding religious
   phenomena;
   - Formal approaches to philosophico-religious arguments: especially the
   frameworks of inference, suppositional reasoning, parallelism, deductive
   reasoning, logical fallacies, contradictions and debate;
   - Techniques for defending/challenging/persuading (including misleading
   an opponent) in situations of doubt or disagreement, especially:
   certification, persuasion, refutation, and trickery in debate;
   - Comparison ? differences and commonalities in argumentative practices
   across cultures.

The participants will inquire into how the relations between logic and
religion are supported by rational inquiry. They will scrupulously examine
a wide range of arguments postulated by philosophers and logicians.

Papers with comparative and/or cross-cultural components are particularly
welcome.

Submit a one-page abstract by June 17th here: http://4wocolor.pl/

Message-ID: <CAOYD-QAZTC=hGyybYeGE2oShXd1DnKshPERo-xFXSzC4FkoRFw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

in The Conquest of the Four Quarters, on p. 255-6, Jonathan Bader mentions
G?yatr?'s curse upon the brahmins.
In discussing the tradition according to which ?a?kara is the founder of
six devotional denominations, Bader writes:

> Nevertheless he [= ?a?kara] realizes that G?yatr?'s curse upon the
> brahmins [...] has now come to pass. The brahmins of old who had argued
> with the goddess had indeed been born again in the kali-yuga with such
> limited capacities that they were attached to one deity or another.

Has anyone any suggestions as to which narrative Bader might be referring
to? Since he mentions that the brahmins *argued* with G?yatr?, I guess her
curse is a reaction to a display of hubris by the brahmins.

I had to think of the Padmapur??a episode in which *S?vitr?*, furious after
seeing the cowherdess G?yatr? take her place as Brahm?'s wife, curses
deities and brahmins alike. I wonder if a similar episode is told somewhere
else with a few major differences.

I shall be grateful for any references, hints and comments.

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci

I strongly support the requirement to clearly distinguish between 
vocalic r? and retroflex ?.

Low-register manuscripts in Bengali script often follow phonetic 
notation rather than precise orthographic rules. So there appears 
combinations of characters that are otherwise unthinkable in correct 
writing.

For example, you may encounter the word ??? [pr??], which at first 
glance does not make sense. When you realize that the vocalic r? is 
pronounced [ri], then it is obvious that the word priy? is meant. If we 
transcribe it as p??, this information is lost.

Best,
Lubomir

Dear colleagues and friends,


I am thrilled to send out this email to all of you. My new book, The Gathering: A Story of the First Buddhist Women (Equinox 2023), is launched! The publisher's blurb about the book is quoted below:


"The Gathering is a retelling of the story of the women?s request for ordination. Inspired by the Therigatha and building on years of research and experience in the field, Sasson follows Vimala, Patachara, Bhadda Kundalakesa, and many others as they walk through the forest to request full access to the tradition.

The Buddha?s response to this request is famously complicated; he eventually accepts women into the Order, but specific and controversial conditions are attached. Sasson invites us to think about who these first Buddhist women might have been, what they might have hoped to achieve, and what these conditions might have meant to them thereafter. By shaping her research into a story, Sasson invites readers to imagine a world that continues to inspire and complicate Buddhist narrative to this day."


If you purchase the book via the equinox website, enter the code RELIGION and you will receive a 25% discount (see attached flyer). A link to the site is here: https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/gathering-women/ (FYI - the website seems to be having some difficulty and is slow to connect all of a sudden).


With warm wishes to everyone,


Vanessa R. Sasson

*Migration and Transformation in Religious Education in Contemporary Jain
Society*



Migration has had a sizable impact on Jain religious education but remained
understudied until recently. In this talk, Dr. Shivani Bothra will examine
the following three forms of migration experienced by Jain communities: (1)
the suburbanization of Digambar Jains in Jaipur leading to the revival of
traditional *pathshala*s in the suburbs; (2) the regional migration of
Shvetambar Terapanthis across India resulting in the development of
*gyanshala*s; and (3) the international migration of Jains to America,
which has presented unique challenges, requiring a focus on Jain *pathshala*s
to transmit traditional cultural values while assimilating into a new
environment. This migration-driven transformation in religious education
has also resulted in unintended consequences, particularly the emergence of
women as leaders in a traditionally male-dominated area of religious
education. Shedding light on the common themes across the three forms of
religious education and the uniqueness of each migration, Dr. Bothra will
also highlight the resulting shifts from traditional to contemporary
religious education for Jain children both in India and abroad.



*Dr. Shivani Bothra* is an Assistant Professor in the Religious Studies
Department at California State University, Long Beach. Dr. Bothra obtained
her doctorate from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, where
she focused on the significance of religious education for children as a
means of preserving Jain values and culture for future generations.
Expanding upon her doctoral research, her current work explores the changes
in religious education within the lay community and how technology
contributes to shaping contemporary Jainism and transnational Jain
communities. Dr. Bothra is also engaged in a study that examines how lay
Jains incorporate the principles of *anek?ntav?da* (the doctrine of
non-one-sidedness) and *aparigraha* (non-possessiveness) into their daily
practices in addition to exploring their involvement in nonviolent
movements that transcend religious boundaries.

Perhaps the way forward is in D?niel's phrase "permitted optional variant
of ISO15919".  If we had a few more permitted variants in ISO15919, maybe
we could all get on with our real work.

I may be wrong, but my earliest memory of the institutional promotion of
the under-*circle* for ? etc. in romanized Sanskrit was from the Library of
Congress in the context of 8-bit MARC cataloguing.  See here
<https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/sanskrit.pdf> for Sanskrit,
and ALA-LC romanization <https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/roman.html>
generally.

I don't think under-circle is specifically "European" in any measurable
sense.  As far as I know, underdot for anusv?ra and vowels, i.e., IAST, has
been the most widespread convention at least since the nineteenth century.
See, e.g., the World Congress of Orientalists (Berlin 1881, Geneva, 1894)
that MW referred to in his introduction (1899: xxix-xxx). See also.,

Plunckett, G. T. (1895) ?Tenth International Congress of Orientalists Held
at Geneva: Report of the Transliteration Committee,? Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society 879?892. Available at:
https://bahai-library.com/plunkett_transliteration_congress_orientalists.

Monier-Williams referred several times, in 1899, to what we today call IAST
as being "German".

I don't actually know who formalized IAST, but it does an excellent job of
recording what most indologists, publishers and journals actually do, in my
view.  Yes, it could do with cleaning up around the edges and a bit of
extension perhaps (remember CS, CSX, CSX+).  But so can all the other
standards, formal or informal.  As a workaday description of what almost
everyone does in practice, it's valuable.  I wish it were a formal
standard, or had been used by the authors of ISO15919; I think they were
listening to the library community, not research scholars and professors.

As for ISO standards becoming freely available, I doubt that that will
happen any time soon.  This is a scandalous situation, and it applies also
to national standards.  We taxpayers pay committees to work stuff out for
us, and then we have to buy the results at exorbitant prices.  Better
people than me have fought this battle and lost.

Best,
Dominik

Dear all,

I would recommend that all of us, in our discussions about transliteration
and standards, bear a few things in mind.

1. It is 2023. If you are typing on a computer, any transliteration system
you use is going to be interconvertible with any other. (With some
exceptions: see below.) I assume most Indologists still don't know this,
but going from ISO-15919 to IAST and back is a totally trivial process, and
there are many tools available to do so (including Aksharamukha
<https://aksharamukha.appspot.com/>, and the Sanscript
<https://github.com/indic-transliteration> libraries for python,
javascript, etc.). If you are happy with typing in IAST, or HK, or SLP1,
nobody will take that away from you.

2. There is a totally separate question of what transliteration system is
to be employed in publications. Web-based publications in principle allow
for Indic-language text to be displayed in any arbitrary system. On my Sanskrit
course <http://prakrit.info/vrddhi/course/> people can choose between
viewing the text in ISO-15919 and Devanagari. But most publications are
still based on a "paper-like" model, where the final result is fixed, and
therefore a choice needs to be made. The primary reasoning behind this
choice is *inertia*, i.e., whatever system of transliteration the author or
publisher has used in the past. This is not necessarily a bad reason!

3. There is one very simple reason to prefer ISO-15919. If you are working
with languages other than Sanskrit, you simply cannot use IAST without
ambiguity. Is ? a flap or a vowel? Is ? a retroflex lateral or a vowel? For
distinctions that are not made in Sanskrit, one has to add new signs
anyway, such as ?, ?, ?, ?, and so on. And the vowels present particular
difficulties. Either you retain "e" and "o" as long vowels, and mark the
short versions with "e?" and "o?," or you adopt a consist system of
representing vowel length (no macron means short, macron means long, or
something like that) which contravenes IAST. Since IAST is not a standard,
any additions or modifications are *per se* arbitrary, and for that reason
I have seen a number of very different solutions for, e.g., solving the
vowel length issue while retaining some version of the IAST system. For
these reasons, I have been persuaded a long time ago that ISO-15919 is to
be preferred for representing Indic languages in transliteration,
especially if one's research includes languages other than Sanskrit.

4. To ask ISO-15919 to include ? and ? as "permitted variants" would be a
violation of the principle of non-ambiguity, since those graphemes are
already reserved for transcribing "?" and "?" (0A70, Gurmukhi tippi). If
you want to use those signs in their traditional IAST values, use IAST.

5. To reiterate what Jan has already said, it is one thing to define a
standard, and another to implement it. Font support for ISO-15919 is not as
robust for IAST, in part because IAST makes use of a smaller range of
diacritics and combinations. But I have added the relevant diacritic
combinations to the fonts that I use, and a wider uptake of ISO-15919 would
probably lead to wider font support.

Thank you Dominik for the history and clarity. Can someone give me an
actual example of where in a document, or a publication the ISO-15919
standard has been used for Sanskrit?

Dear all,

I agree with Andrew especially on point 3. For the same kind of reasoning, I?d rather like to replace the undercircle by a vertical understroke (e.g., r?) since that is the sign used in IPA for marking syllabicity while the undercircle is used to mark voicelessness. In publications with cross-linguistic scope, undercircles might be disturbing to people not so familiar with Indologist and Indo-Europeanist traditions (and I think I once even saw such a misinterpretation). I have changed my own notation in this respect wherever there is no official philological standard, i.e. in reconstructions of IE and Indo-Iranian etc., but not for Sanskrit and transliteration of Indic scripts, as long as the undercircle remains there.

All the best,
Martin

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Revision of ISO 15919 (transliteration of Indic scripts)

Dear all,

I would recommend that all of us, in our discussions about transliteration and standards, bear a few things in mind.

1. It is 2023. If you are typing on a computer, any transliteration system you use is going to be interconvertible with any other. (With some exceptions: see below.) I assume most Indologists still don't know this, but going from ISO-15919 to IAST and back is a totally trivial process, and there are many tools available to do so (including Aksharamukha<https://aksharamukha.appspot.com/>, and the Sanscript<https://github.com/indic-transliteration> libraries for python, javascript, etc.). If you are happy with typing in IAST, or HK, or SLP1, nobody will take that away from you.

2. There is a totally separate question of what transliteration system is to be employed in publications. Web-based publications in principle allow for Indic-language text to be displayed in any arbitrary system. On my Sanskrit course<http://prakrit.info/vrddhi/course/> people can choose between viewing the text in ISO-15919 and Devanagari. But most publications are still based on a "paper-like" model, where the final result is fixed, and therefore a choice needs to be made. The primary reasoning behind this choice is inertia, i.e., whatever system of transliteration the author or publisher has used in the past. This is not necessarily a bad reason!

3. There is one very simple reason to prefer ISO-15919. If you are working with languages other than Sanskrit, you simply cannot use IAST without ambiguity. Is ? a flap or a vowel? Is ? a retroflex lateral or a vowel? For distinctions that are not made in Sanskrit, one has to add new signs anyway, such as ?, ?, ?, ?, and so on. And the vowels present particular difficulties. Either you retain "e" and "o" as long vowels, and mark the short versions with "e?" and "o?," or you adopt a consist system of representing vowel length (no macron means short, macron means long, or something like that) which contravenes IAST. Since IAST is not a standard, any additions or modifications are per se arbitrary, and for that reason I have seen a number of very different solutions for, e.g., solving the vowel length issue while retaining some version of the IAST system. For these reasons, I have been persuaded a long time ago that ISO-15919 is to be preferred for representing Indic languages in transliteration, especially if one's research includes languages other than Sanskrit.

4. To ask ISO-15919 to include ? and ? as "permitted variants" would be a violation of the principle of non-ambiguity, since those graphemes are already reserved for transcribing "?" and "?" (0A70, Gurmukhi tippi). If you want to use those signs in their traditional IAST values, use IAST.

5. To reiterate what Jan has already said, it is one thing to define a standard, and another to implement it. Font support for ISO-15919 is not as robust for IAST, in part because IAST makes use of a smaller range of diacritics and combinations. But I have added the relevant diacritic combinations to the fonts that I use, and a wider uptake of ISO-15919 would probably lead to wider font support.

I may be wrong, but my earliest memory of the institutional promotion of the under-circle for ? etc. in romanized Sanskrit was from the Library of Congress in the context of 8-bit MARC cataloguing.  See here<https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/sanskrit.pdf> for Sanskrit, and ALA-LC romanization<https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/roman.html> generally.

I don't think under-circle is specifically "European" in any measurable sense.  As far as I know, underdot for anusv?ra and vowels, i.e., IAST, has been the most widespread convention at least since the nineteenth century.  See, e.g., the World Congress of Orientalists (Berlin 1881, Geneva, 1894) that MW referred to in his introduction (1899: xxix-xxx). See also.,

Monier-Williams referred several times, in 1899, to what we today call IAST as being "German".

I don't actually know who formalized IAST, but it does an excellent job of recording what most indologists, publishers and journals actually do, in my view.  Yes, it could do with cleaning up around the edges and a bit of extension perhaps (remember CS, CSX, CSX+).  But so can all the other standards, formal or informal.

We taxpayers pay committees to work stuff out for us, and then we have to buy the results at exorbitant prices.  Better people than me have fought this battle and lost.

I would like to push back on Andrew's point 3.  Oh, and thank you Andrew
for the clear analysis, which is very helpful!

The issue you raise in point 3 is only a problem if strings in different
languages in a multilingual text are concatenated without language
tagging.  If a Polish author (Polish has ?) is writing about peace in
Sanskrit (??nti) then the point 3 problem might arise.  But it doesn't
arise in the real world because of readers' implicit knowledge that these
are different languages.  When encoding, we should make the implicit
explicit and say <polish>?l?c</polish> <sanskrit>??nti</sanskrit>.  We
should also do this in order to get the right hyphenation and other
language features (spell-checking, and whatnot).  The language-tagging also
does the encoding-switching: ? in Polish is one thing, ? in Sanskrit is
another. In a tool like Aksharamukha, for example, the ? in ??nti may
become ? but the one in ?l?c may not.

Best,
Dominik

Note that the ISO standard document contains much more than just tables of
transliterations . There are three pages of rules and recommendations which
need to be known to apply the standard.

For example this rule about interpreting anusvara and this recommendation
about word breaks which also requires interpretation of the original
script. The standard even says about the recommendation " This will require
a good knowledge of the language in question".  But Rule 3a also requires a
good knowledge of the language in question.

Should a transliteration standard require a language expert to apply it?
Or should it be such that a typist with a knowledge of the script be able
to apply it?

Rule 3a also means that if you produced a diplomatic transliteration of a
manuscript (leaving anusvara as anusvara)  you would be deviating from the
ISO standard.

>From the ISO  standard document.
. . .

8.1 Special requirements

. . .

Rule 3.

. . .

a) In modern vernaculars, anusvara before a stop or class nasal shall be
transliterated as the corresponding class nasal; in other languages,
anusvara before a stop or class nasal shall be transliterated as the
corresponding class nasal unless it arises from sandhi (euphonic
combination) of final m with that consonant.


EXAMPLE 1 Sanskrit ??? is transliterated as sa?ga when it represents the
noun formed from sam + root gam, but as sa?ga when it represents the noun
derived from the root sa?j.

8.2 Recommendations

Where word boundaries are not shown in the original text (as happens
commonly in Sanskrit) and a word ends in a consonant, the transliteration
should show word division by a space; but when phonological processes
result in two words sharing a common vowel, no attempt should be made to
separate them. This will require a good knowledge of the language in
question.

What we have done in the past when with the new revisions of transliteration standard is having a strict transliteration and having a simplified/modified transliteration. The former is intended to provide 1:1 reversible mapping (annotated with one-way ?implementations can encounter X in existing text? notes when appropriate), the latter is usually more appropriate for educational context and is allowed to rely on language knowledge (for example spelling out vowels in unmarked semitic languages).

 

The said rule 3a would not be possible in a strict system.

 

The standards are concerned about plain-text transliteration. Language tagging is left to the higher protocol, but if you have that, then you can tag which transliteration system you are using directly rather than inferring it from a language.

 

Indeed TC46 in general is mostly librarians and archivists, that?s why I thought it would be good to reach out to colleagues here and I am glad to see the interest. Let?s hope we can find an acceptable solution for both librarians and scholars.

 

Thanks,

Jan

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Source of verses on transitive/intransitive verbs
Message-ID: <CAANHO14QMoZ6sW-AsJ6hS8oLkOZQ4k+OcMtV=P5hphFr97x=ig@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I am wondering whether anyone might know the source(s) of two verses that
are cited by a Kannada grammarian, Bha???kala?kad?va (writing in 1604 CE),
on the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs. They are (p.
233 of the 1890 ed. <https://archive.org/details/dli.csl.7612>):

yadv?cy?h? savi?ay? dh?tavas t? sakarmak??
y? tu nirvi?ay?m ?hur ih?nt? syur akarmak??

pacy?dik? savi?ay? kriy? s? y? kim icchik?
sthity-?dir any?vi?ay? kim icch?m janay?n nay?

Before these verses, he cites a list that appears to be commonly quoted in
modern grammars, although I don't know of its ultimate source:

lajj?-satt?-sthiti-j?gara?a? vr?ddhi-k?aya-bhaya-j?vita-mara?a?
svapna-kr????-ruci-d?pty-artha? dh?tu-ga?a? tam akarmakam ?hu?

With thanks,

Andrew

Greetings!
    Can anyone tell me if Sadashiva L. Katre ever published an edition of
the Ga?g?lahar??   He announced the edition in a postscript to his article
published in The Vikram (Vol. II, no. 4, Arts, 1958). It was to be
published "in the next Arts issue of the  Vikrama" but I have not been able
to locate it. Any info would be greatly appreciated!
Best,
Tim

Dear list members,
The following 3 e-texts transcribed from manuscripts of the Ragunatha
temple Jammu have been added to the Muktabodha digital library.
The direct link to the Muktabodha digital library is:
https://muktalib7.com/DL_CATALOG_ROOT/digital_library_secure_entry.htm

The etexts are:
nav?r?avaca??ipa?j??gam manuscript 4818 dh
mudr?prak??a?  manuscript 1406
m?t?k?r?a-nigha??u by bh?nud?k?ita? n?r?ya?ad?k?ita-putra? manuscript 4858

With the addition of these new manuscripts there are now 500 (mostly
tantric) manuscripts in the searchable Etext library
and slightly more than 3000 texts in total in the three collections of
Muktabodha.

The transcriptions of these manuscripts have not been normalized.
Word breaks (or lack of word breaks) is asin the devanagari
manuscripts. The letters v and b are left as in the manuscript.

These etexts were created by the Muktabodha Varanasi office from
manuscript images made
available to the public by the generosity of the eGangotri organisation.

The etexts were produced under the supervision of Dr. Anirban Dash.
The transcribers were Mr. Vinay Mishra, Mr. Dharmendra Kumar, and Mr.
Sandeep Yadav.


Thank you,Harry Spier

Dear Colleagues,

Since I presently do not have access to a library, I would be grateful for
a soft copy of the following article:

Oberlies, T. (1997). Neuer Wein in alten Schl?uchen? Zur Geschichte der
buddhistischen Ordensregeln. *Bulletin d??tudes Indiennes* 15: 171-204.



I already searched for the article online but was not successful.



With many thanks in advance,

Dear colleagues,

I am sharing the references for a two-part article perhaps of interest to some among us.

Wiland, Julia, Rick Brown, Lizzie Fuller, Lea Havelock, Jackie Johnson, Dorothy Kenn, Paulina Kralka, Marya Muzart, Jessica Pollard & Jenny Snowdon. 2022. ?A Literature Review of Palm Leaf Manuscript Conservation?Part 1: A Historic Overview, Leaf Preparation, Materials and Media, Palm Leaf Manuscripts at the British Library and the Common Types of Damage.?

???. 2023. ?A Literature Review of Palm Leaf Manuscript Conservation?Part 2: Historic and Current Conservation Treatments, Boxing and Storage, Religious and Ethical Issues, Recommendations for Best Practice.? Journal of the Institute of Conservation 46 (1): 64?91. https://doi.org/10.1080/19455224.2023.2167095.

The pdfs I have just obtained weigh about 4.5 MB each. I am trying to attach them though unsure of if attachments of such weight can be handled.

Best wishes,

Dear colleagues,

Though I am myself among those interviewed, I have only just come across this audiovisual presentation of the EFEO made on the occasion of the celebrations for the institution's 120th birthday in 2021.

<https://120ans.efeo.fr>

If you have an interest in the history of Asian studies (or at least in the way one institutional actor wishes to present itself), some free time on your hand, and understand French, then you might enjoy watching one or more of the short videos accessible through that link.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

Dear list members,
I'm looking at a manuscript of the ?r?-vidy?-nitya-paddhati? of Sahib Kaul
The link to the manuscript on archive.org is:

https://archive.org/download/ShriVidyaNityaPaddhatiOfSahibKaulAlm27Shlf260531673KDevanagariTantra/Shri%20Vidya%20Nitya%20Paddhati%20of%20Sahib%20Kaul_Alm_27_shlf_2_6053_1673_K_Devanagari%20-%20Tantra.pdf

The manuscript is full of mantras with the tantric preamble of ??i?,
chandas, devat?, bija?, ?akti? , k?laka? and viniyoga?.  But what is
unusual is that where these mantra preambles occur there is an annotation
in red ink and as far as I can see it is the same annotation

??i? has annotation ?i, chandas has annotation mu,
devat? has annotation sa, bija? has annotation gu,
?akti? has annotation m? , k?laka? has annotation n?
viniyoga? has annotation sa.

And one mantra has in addition to these, sthane with annotation m?,
var??? with annotation sa, svara? with annotation ka?

Does anyone have any idea what these annotations are.  I'm particularly
interested in finding out, because I've been unsuccessfully trying to get
any information on the tantric preamble of ??i?, chandas, devat?, bija?,
?akti? , k?laka? viniyoga? for over 20 years.  I've only seen the most
basic information (which seems mostly like conjectures) with no references
to texts.  Such as a tantric text that says your supposed to repeat this
preamble before mantras..

In the first 120 folios you can see the annotations in these folios
I'm only giving references to the occurances in the first 120 folios but
they also occur farther on in the manuscripts.

folio 2b pdf page 6

folio 10b pdf page 23

folio 11b and 12a pdf pages 25-26

folio 12b-13a pdf pages 27-28

folio 21b pdf page 45 regular annotations + sthane with annotation m?,

Friends:

I will be going to India on a Business Visa. I would like to visit Sri Lanka for a few days and return to Delhi to catch my flight back home. I have seen that India does not allow visitors to India to go to neighboring countries and return within a certain number of days (180?). Do you all have any experience with this? Thanks.

  Dear list members,
I received this very interesting reply on another list.  I am posting it
here with his permission. To me the most interesting thing is that in
addition to explaining what the annotations are,  it explains what the
preamble of  ??i?,chandas,devat?,bijam,?akti?,k?lakam,and viniyoga? before
tantric mantras is.  It  is a  ny?sa to be performed before reciting the
mantra.

Dear Mr Spier,

I read your post on the BVP. I believe we may briefly corresponded before.
I am a Hindu ritualist and academic at Dr. B. R. Ambedkar University Delhi.

I took a look at the manuscript you posted. Paddhati texts, as you will
know, are typically written by and for ritualists like us. And typically -
even now in our modern handwritten and printed paddhatis - we annotate in
the margins for clarity and these are often handed down through
generations. Thus the ritualist's instinct comes in handy when reading such
texts.

I believe these marks are showing the locations for the ??y?di-ny?sa. The
six placements are for the ??i, the cchanda, the devat?, the b?ja, the
?akti and a namask?ra (shown on the viniyoga). Thus, the "?i" on "??i"
means "?irasi" (on the head), indicating the placement of the fingers/hand
when performing the viniyoga rite. Similarly, the "cchanda" is to be placed
on "mu" (="mukhe", on the mouth). The "devat?" is to be placed on the "h?"
(="h?di", on the heart). This character is tricky, because it looks very
much like a sa/s?. But if you look at p. 93 of the PDF (you have cited this
in your email), there is a "h?day?ya nama?" two lines below the annotation
which can establish that it is possibly a "h?" and not a "sa". The "b?ja"
is to be placed on "gu" (="guhye", in the genitals) and the "?akti" is to
be placed on the "p?" (="p?dayo?", on the two feet). Finally, at the
pronouncing of "viniyoga", the ritualist touches all of his body parts and
thus, the notation is "sa" with a special dot, which is "sarv??ge".

The reason that the notations are necessary is because these placements can
differ by lineage and by ritualist tradition (and innovations are very much
possible). That's why they are not written as part of the main text
themselves. In contrast, on p. 93-94 of the PDF, the kar??gany?sa does
actually specify locations because that ny?sa is more standardized than
the ??y?di-ny?sa, so variations are unlikely.

I may be mistaken, but you will have to check and verify with the rest of
the text and context as well as with their ritualist traditions. But this
is the system we follow.

As for the extra notations on p. 45 of the PDF, I'm slightly puzzled. This
is unfamiliar to me because (a) it seems to be unique to the srividya
tradition and (b) I don't belong to this srividya tradition. But I can try
and fathom a guess. I can see an "o?k?rastattva?" with a "h?" mark, which
makes sense to me because tattva belongs to the h?daya. It's strange that
it says "nabha? sth?ne" after that with a "pu" annotation. This is not
clear to me because it's specifying a location unlike the other phrases.
Chances are that the writer of the text intended one location and the
annotator inscribed a different opinion (that's possible in ritualist
literature). Also, I checked my notes and found nothing starting with "pu",
so that's a question there. There is a "sa" with a dot after "var?a?", so
that is "sarv??ge". Finally there is a "ka?" after "svara" - w hich I am
guessing - may be "kar??gule / kar??gulim?le". I hope that helps in some
way.

Warm regards,
Sahishnu Bhattacharyya

Dear Patrick and friends,

I don't know about Business Visa, but I know that, in Belgium (a country
which is much less well appreciated than USA by Indian bureaucracy), we can
only stay one month in India (in a period of three months given by the
visa). On the other hand, we have to go back to Belgium if we want to
re-enter India (a neighbour country is not enough) and, I think, we can
re-enter only after a period of several months.

Best regards,

Jean Michel Delire

Dear Patrick and friends,

I don't know about Business Visa, but I know that, in Belgium (a country which is much less well appreciated than USA by Indian bureaucracy), we can only stay one month in India (in a period of three months given by the visa). On the other hand, we have to go back to Belgium if we want to re-enter India (a neighbour country is not enough) and, I think, we can re-enter only after a period of several months.

Best regards,

Jean Michel Delire

Friends:

I will be going to India on a Business Visa. I would like to visit Sri Lanka for a few days and return to Delhi to catch my flight back home. I have seen that India does not allow visitors to India to go to neighboring countries and return within a certain number of days (180?). Do you all have any experience with this? Thanks.

Patrick
