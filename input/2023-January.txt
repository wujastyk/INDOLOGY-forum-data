Dear Professor Houben,
There is a reference to this in the text of the *Kum?rasambhava*, as read
and commented on by Aru?agirin?tha and N?r?ya?apa??ita, in the section on
P?rvat?'s tapas. In Sarga 5, P?rvat?'s asceticism to win ?iva is described,
and its transformative, purifying power is said to have affected the
surrounding environment, causing even animals usually at war to become
gentle towards each other:

*virodhisattvojjhitap?rvamatsara?*

*drumair abh???aprasav?rcit?tithi |*

*navo?aj?bhyantarasambh?t?nala?*

*tapovana? tatra babh?va p?vanam ||* 5.17



'There [on Mount Gaur??ikhara], her [very] ascetic grove, in which, inside
a newly built leaf hut, she had built the sacred fire, became purifying:
even beasts there mutually at war were free of their ancient hostility (
*virodhisattvojjhitap?rvamatsara?*), and its trees worshipped guests with
choice buds.'


As the two commentators note, these--i.e. peaceful animals, and trees being
hospitable to guests (just like the ascetic)--are the special, magical
characteristics of the hermitage groves of great ascetics. N?r?ya?a
provides the following citation to a source I am not yet able to identify,
thus:


*'tapovanocit?ni vi?e?a??ny ?ha-- virodhisattvojjhitap?rvamatsaram ity?din?
| 'sp??ati kalabha? sai?h?? da???r?? m???ladhiy? muhur' iti
?ditapovanav?tt?nto' tra dra??avya? |*


[K?lid?sa] describes the qualities appropriate to hermitage groves with the
compound 'even beasts there mutually at war were free of their ancient
hostility'. "A baby elephant keeps touching a lion's fang thinking it to be
a lotus stem"-- such a description of a hermitage grove is apparent in this
case.'


I am not sure which *tapovanav?tt?nta* the quote about the baby elephant
placing his trunk inside the lion's mouth with utmost ease is from. But
evidently in such tales of hermitage groves, which the commentator was
aware of, there is an idea that the dharma of such places is non-violence
and generosity between man and beast, not to be witnessed in the real
world. And that this dharma is a transposition of the ascetic's own quality
onto the surrounding environment.


It would be interesting to read the *Raghuva??a* verses you mention below
in a parenthesis in relation to this.


Thank you

Dear Prof. Houben,
dear Bihani Sarkar,

perhaps another verse from the Raghuva??a is of interest in this context 
in addition to the two verses already mentioned (13.50, 14.79). 
Raghuva??a 11.23 describes the ascetic grove of Vi?v?mitra and his 
pupils which is guarded by the adolescent R?ma and Lak?ma?a: the trees 
there are fancied to have their buds put forth like hands folded in 
reverence (baddhapallavapu???jali) and the deer is not afraid but on the 
contrary raising their eyes (dar?anonmukha, watching the sage, as 
Mallin?tha expounds).

May I use this opportunity to ask about the plans and status of the 
edition of the further volumes of the Raghupa?cik? of Vallabhadeva by 
Dominic Goodall et al.?

Best,
Christian Ferstl

Dear Christian,
Thank you for asking, the second volume of the Raghupa?cik? edition (sargas 7?12) is nearing completion, in fact we were just working on sarga 12 when your email arrived.
Best wishes for the new year,
Csaba

Dear Colleagues,

Happy New Year!

The IASS (International Association of Sanskrit Studies) initiated this Fellowship in 2019 and it will be offered again for 2023. Any member of the IASS is eligible for the HRF, if the scholar has received a PhD in Sanskrit or allied studies in the last five years.


The HRF is for research work to be conducted in South Asia for a period of at least two weeks in any field related to Sanskrit and allied studies. If travel is impossible, an alternative may be proposed, for example, an online conference with experts in India in the chosen field.  The Honorary Research Fellowship is valued at 1000 Euros.


The DEADLINE for the written project proposal has been extended to 28 February 2023.

Please send all proposals and/or queries to Associate Professor McComas Taylor of the IASS:

McComas.Taylor at anu.edu.au<mailto:McComas.Taylor at anu.edu.au>

Subject: [INDOLOGY] key to Coulson's exercises
Message-ID: <AS8PR10MB73261301ED372006BD182764A5F59@AS8PR10MB7326.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear colleagues,

Happy new year to every one!

I am writing on behalf of my friend Agustinus Gianto SJ, a specialist of Semitic linguistics wishing to brush up his Sanskrit through Coulson's textbook. He apparently has a fairly old edition in hand which mentions the possibility of obtaining a key to exercises through the then incumbent of the Boden chair, Prof. Gombrich. (See photo attached.) He also informs me that later editions don't mention the key any longer.

Should anyone be able to deliver said key in scanned form, I shall gratefully forward it to Prof. Gianto.

Thank you. Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

PS For those rare list members who read Indonesian, the following collection of Prof. Gianto's popularizing essays on language (esp. languages in Indonesia), with lots of reference to Sanskrit, is highly recommended:

Dear Bihani (and others),

This line quoted by N?r?ya?a is from the Subhadr?dhana?jaya play. It is
performed very elaborately (and needless to say, very beautifully) by the
Kutiyaatam artistes. I am unable to find a video on youtube, but here is
the full verse.




*?ikhini ?alabh? jv?l?cakrair na vikriyat? patanpibati bahu?a? ??rd?l?n??
stana? mr?ga??vaka? /?pr?ati kalabha? sai?h?? da???r?? mr???ladhiy?
muhurnayati nakula? nidr?tandr?? lihann ahip?taka? //*

Best wishes for the new year,
Naresh Keerthi

Dear Dr. Keerthi,
Thank you very much for identifying the source of the citation! This is
very helpful indeed for my notes on the section, and I have acknowledged
you as the identifier.

Yes it is indeed a very beautiful verse, presenting a truly utopian vision.
I quite enjoyed the first line about the grasshopper un-singed by fire,
because it contrasts with the   'virodhisattva-pairs' in the other lines,
which are animals (deer-tiger, lion-elephant, mongoose-snake).

With best wishes, and greetings for the New Year,
Bihani

Dear Scholars,

Some friends of mine plan to publish a journal on Vai??ava polemics and apologetics, both internal and external, and they want to name the journal P?rva-pak?a, which MW renders as "the first objection to an assertion in any discussion, the prima facie view or argument in any question.?

Since these scholars want to refute, or at least problematize, philosophical and theological objections to their own traditional doctrines, I thought the title inappropriate. My view has been that p?rva-pak?a simply refers to a view or argument that one hopes to refute. It does not refer both to the opposing view, and also to one?s refutation of that view.

Have I understood this correctly?

Many thanks,
Howard

Yes, your understanding is correct, Prof. Howard Resnick.

Shaastraartha or Vaakyaartha or Vaada may represent the argumentative
approach from both sides in a better way.

P?rvapak?a is the opponent?s position ? their objections to one?s own position or their position(s) that precipitates the debate. The refutation and victorious defeat of the opponent?s argument is called uttarapak?a.

If they want a less complex name, how about simple ?viv?da? which can mean disputation in the scholastic sense. The term is also used for litigation in a court of law.

Dear all,
This is just to add that the Buddhists have an expression that points very precisely to what our Vai??ava friends have in mind : codyaparih?ra, i.e., ?refuting/rebuking objections.?
This can be found from the Yog?c?rabh?mi onward ; more in R. Nance?s book Speaking for Buddhas.
With kind regards, and best wishes,
Vincent

If they want a less complex name, how about simple ?viv?da? which can mean disputation in the scholastic sense. The term is also used for litigation in a court of law.

Dear Scholars,

Some friends of mine plan to publish a journal on Vai??ava polemics and apologetics, both internal and external, and they want to name the journal P?rva-pak?a, which MW renders as "the first objection to an assertion in any discussion, the prima facie view or argument in any question.?

Since these scholars want to refute, or at least problematize, philosophical and theological objections to their own traditional doctrines, I thought the title inappropriate. My view has been that p?rva-pak?a simply refers to a view or argument that one hopes to refute. It does not refer both to the opposing view, and also to one?s refutation of that view.

Have I understood this correctly?

Many thanks,
Howard

Dear Arlo,

Perhaps you have already received the requested key off-list. But as this
question may have a wider relevance to anyone who teaches Sanskrit, it may
be worthwhile to reply to it on the list. The key to Sanskrit-English
exercises and English-Sanskrit exercises was included already in the first
edition, 1976. It is the key to the Supplementary English-Sanskrit
exercises that was not included in the first edition. The key to these
Supplementary exercises was included in the second edition, 1992, pp.
494-504. I do not at present have a way to scan these pages, but will find
a way if no one else supplies them. Interestingly, both the Supplementary
English-Sanskrit exercises and their key were omitted in the 2006 edition,
which I suppose is the one still being sold.

Best regards,

David Reigle

Dear David,
Thank you for this information.  Attached are the keys to the
sanskrit-english and english-sanskrit exercises and the keys to the
supplementary exercises.  I had previously sent Arlo the keys but missed
the keys to the supplementary exercises which are also now attached.

I have encountered ?uttarapak?a? in two different senses:

(1) in the sense Dan gives, i.e. as a synonym of 'siddh?nta'
(2) to refer to an intermediate position between the p?rvapak?a and the
siddh?nta: a way to answer the p?rvapak?a that is not actually the way of
the siddh?ntin.  The uttarapak?a, in this sense, is closer to the siddh?nta
than the p?rvapak?a, but still not the 'correct' view, i.e. the view of the
author.

 Do people find 'uttarapak?a' to be more commonly used in sense (1) or (2)?

Yours
Alex

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanderson's reconstruction of the VAUT?
Message-ID: <CANJQKUNWx6O6UKkKdST2UY6gW5bC3MXU-jhNLYsjHnxyeWkUmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Indologists,

On p. 519 of her substantial work on Vajrayogini, Elizabeth English cites
an unpublished reconstruction of the *V?r?hyabhyudayatantra* (VAUT) edited
by Alexis Sanderson as follows:

V?r?hyabhyudayatantra. 2001. Ed. by A. Sanderson. In "The
> *V?r?hyabhyudayatantram*: Tibetan Translation with the Sanskrit Restored
> on the Basis of the *Abhidh?nottaratantram*." ... Oxford (unpublished).


If a soft copy of this is making the rounds, I humbly request a copy.
Otherwise, I am happy to ask Dr. Sanderson himself if someone can confirm
which is his preferred mode of communication (google suggested several
different email addresses).

Thank you and happy new year to all.

*Sincerely,*

*Westin Harris*

Thanks to all colleagues who have answered.

David: thanks a lot. I'll forward to Prof. Gianto and ask what he really wants, though it seems to be precisely the key to the supplementary exercises.

Best wishes,

Arlo

Dear Arlo,

Perhaps you have already received the requested key off-list. But as this question may have a wider relevance to anyone who teaches Sanskrit, it may be worthwhile to reply to it on the list. The key to Sanskrit-English exercises and English-Sanskrit exercises was included already in the first edition, 1976. It is the key to the Supplementary English-Sanskrit exercises that was not included in the first edition. The key to these Supplementary exercises was included in the second edition, 1992, pp. 494-504. I do not at present have a way to scan these pages, but will find a way if no one else supplies them. Interestingly, both the Supplementary English-Sanskrit exercises and their key were omitted in the 2006 edition, which I suppose is the one still being sold.

Best regards,

David Reigle

Dear colleagues,

Happy new year to every one!

I am writing on behalf of my friend Agustinus Gianto SJ, a specialist of Semitic linguistics wishing to brush up his Sanskrit through Coulson's textbook. He apparently has a fairly old edition in hand which mentions the possibility of obtaining a key to exercises through the then incumbent of the Boden chair, Prof. Gombrich. (See photo attached.) He also informs me that later editions don't mention the key any longer.

Should anyone be able to deliver said key in scanned form, I shall gratefully forward it to Prof. Gianto.

Thank you. Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

PS For those rare list members who read Indonesian, the following collection of Prof. Gianto's popularizing essays on language (esp. languages in Indonesia), with lots of reference to Sanskrit, is highly recommended:

Dear colleagues,

Happy new year greetings first of all!

I'm looking for a copy of Sushil Kumar De's Treatment of Love in Sanskrit
Literature  (Cosmo, 1983). Has the book been reedited? Does anyone have a
pdf of it?

Best wishes

Dear Dr. Keerthi,
Thank you very much for identifying the source of the citation! This is very helpful indeed for my notes on the section, and I have acknowledged you as the identifier.

Yes it is indeed a very beautiful verse, presenting a truly utopian vision. I quite enjoyed the first line about the grasshopper un-singed by fire, because it contrasts with the   'virodhisattva-pairs' in the other lines, which are animals (deer-tiger, lion-elephant, mongoose-snake).

With best wishes, and greetings for the New Year,
Bihani

This line quoted by N?r?ya?a is from the Subhadr?dhana?jaya play. It is performed very elaborately (and needless to say, very beautifully) by the Kutiyaatam artistes. I am unable to find a video on youtube, but here is the full verse.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Best wishes for a Peaceful Christmas and New Year...
Dear Prof. Houben,
dear Bihani Sarkar,

perhaps another verse from the Raghuva??a is of interest in this context
in addition to the two verses already mentioned (13.50, 14.79).
Raghuva??a 11.23 describes the ascetic grove of Vi?v?mitra and his
pupils which is guarded by the adolescent R?ma and Lak?ma?a: the trees
there are fancied to have their buds put forth like hands folded in
reverence (baddhapallavapu???jali) and the deer is not afraid but on the
contrary raising their eyes (dar?anonmukha, watching the sage, as
Mallin?tha expounds).

May I use this opportunity to ask about the plans and status of the
edition of the further volumes of the Raghupa?cik? of Vallabhadeva by
Dominic Goodall et al.?

Best,
Christian Ferstl

Dear Christian,
Thank you for asking, the second volume of the Raghupa?cik? edition (sargas 7?12) is nearing completion, in fact we were just working on sarga 12 when your email arrived.
Best wishes for the new year,
Csaba

Dear Prof. Houben,
dear Bihani Sarkar,

perhaps another verse from the Raghuva??a is of interest in this context in addition to the two verses already mentioned (13.50, 14.79). Raghuva??a 11.23 describes the ascetic grove of Vi?v?mitra and his pupils which is guarded by the adolescent R?ma and Lak?ma?a: the trees there are fancied to have their buds put forth like hands folded in reverence (baddhapallavapu???jali) and the deer is not afraid but on the contrary raising their eyes (dar?anonmukha, watching the sage, as Mallin?tha expounds).

May I use this opportunity to ask about the plans and status of the edition of the further volumes of the Raghupa?cik? of Vallabhadeva by Dominic Goodall et al.?

Best,
Christian Ferstl

Dear Professor Houben,
There is a reference to this in the text of the _Kum?rasambhava_, as
read and commented on by Aru?agirin?tha and
N?r?ya?apa??ita, in the section on P?rvat?'s tapas. In Sarga
5, P?rvat?'s asceticism to win ?iva is described, and its
transformative, purifying power is said to have affected the
surrounding environment, causing even animals usually at war to become
gentle towards each other:
_virodhisattvojjhitap?rvamatsara?__ _
_drumair abh???aprasav?rcit?tithi |__ _
_navo?aj?bhyantarasambh?t?nala?__ _
_tapovana? tatra babh?va p?vanam ||_ 5.17
'There [on Mount Gaur??ikhara], her [very] ascetic grove, in which,
inside a newly built leaf hut, she had built the sacred fire, became
purifying: even beasts there mutually at war were free of their
ancient hostility (_virodhisattvojjhitap?rvamatsara?_), and its
trees worshipped guests with choice buds.'
As the two commentators note, these--i.e. peaceful animals, and trees
being hospitable to guests (just like the ascetic)--are the special,
magical characteristics of the hermitage groves of great ascetics.
N?r?ya?a provides the following citation to a source I am not yet
able to identify, thus:
_'tapovanocit?ni vi?e?a??ny ?ha--
virodhisattvojjhitap?rvamatsaram ity?din? | 'sp??ati kalabha?
sai?h?? da???r?? m???ladhiy? muhur' iti
?ditapovanav?tt?nto' tra dra??avya? |_
[K?lid?sa] describes the qualities appropriate to hermitage groves
with the compound 'even beasts there mutually at war were free of
their ancient hostility'. "A baby elephant keeps touching a lion's
fang thinking it to be a lotus stem"-- such a description of a
hermitage grove is apparent in this case.'
I am not sure which _tapovanav?tt?nta_ the quote about the baby
elephant placing his trunk inside the lion's mouth with utmost ease is
from. But evidently in such tales of hermitage groves, which the
commentator was aware of, there is an idea that the dharma of such
places is non-violence and generosity between man and beast, not to be
witnessed in the real world. And that this dharma is a transposition
of the ascetic's own quality onto the surrounding environment.
It would be interesting to read the _Raghuva??a_ verses you mention
below in a parenthesis in relation to this.
Thank you

It seems that only the extensive passages in the R?m?ya?a
Kakawin to which Andrea Acri referred extends the concept explicitly
to human society.
I am grateful for the references to the Mah?bh?rata,
??kuntalop?khy?na (famously elaborated also by K?lid?sa), and
the Telugu commentary on it.
Also the reference to the Caitanya-carit?m?ta in Sanskritic
Bengali bring us beyond the scope of Sanskrit literature in the
strict sense of the word.
The reference to A?vagho?a?s Saundar?nanda I find important
because it concerns the legendary sage Kapila, known as one of the
founders of the S??khya system of philosophy (as I have argued,
S??khya was originally more a movement, partly in protest to
Vedic ritualism, and became a philosophical system afterwards).
The scene described in this reference is almost a S??khya
illustration of the concept (later on?) formulated in YS 2.35.
One part of a similar formula is perhaps found in the
sa?ny?sa-vidhi attributed to a certain Kapila,  ????
???????????? ??????
?????? ?(Baudh?yana-G?hya-?e?a-S?tra 4.16.4).
The other part remains here apparently unexpressed, namely: the
expectation that this declaration will lead to
????????? and to wild animals etc. to provide,
reciprocatively, abhayam to the ascetic (and, near the ascetic, to
each other).
A very similar or rather parallel concept, expressed in different
terms, is found, in my view, in the maitr? and maitr?-bh?van? of
Buddhism, as discussed by Lambert Schmithausen in his _Maitr? and
Magic : Aspects of the Buddhist Attitude Toward the Dangerous in
Nature_, Vienna, 1997.
As we know that nonviolence was and is an important religious duty
in JAINISM it would be interesting to know whether in that context,
too, a concept of a "radiance of peace" was known or developed...

Commentaries and references given for aphorism and referred to for

situation *even* wild animals, no more attack their prey. An
example is Kir???rjun?ya 2.55 (meter viyogin?): Vy?sa is

Dear friends,

Kindly find attached the announcement of launch of a Sanskrit verb form
generator (vidyut-prakriya) from Mr. Arun Prasad, which may be of interest
to some of you.

QUOTE

??? ??????????? --

*vidyut-prakriya* generates Sanskrit words by applying Paninian rules
step-by-step. Our long-term goal is for the program to generate all valid
Paninian words.

*Summary*
vidyut-prakriya is heavily indebted to the SanskritVerb
<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/sm-lW9qj0A8> generator from Dr.
Dhaval Patel, I.A.S and Dr. Shivakumari Katuri, and we are grateful to the
authors for their encouragement in this project.

If you are familiar with SanskritVerb, vidyut-prakriya offers the following
improvements:

- It adds many more forms (????????? etc, ??? etc, -??????? etc.)
- It fixes various small bugs.
- Its prakriyas generally have more detail, especially for it-Agama rules.
- It can run in a web browser without an internet connection.
- It is much faster. On my laptop, vidyut-prakriya can generate all
kartari-tinantas in about 4 seconds. This speed is especially useful for
testing and for natural language processing tools.
- It has partial support for sanAdi forms. These have not been tested very
much, so please use with caution.

*Code: *https://github.com/ambuda-org/vidyut/tree/main/vidyut-prakriya
*Demo*: https://ambuda-org.github.io/vidyullekha/-- click on a dhatu to see
its tinanta padas, and click on a pada to see its prakriya.

*Notes*:
We are sharing our system publicly so that we can collect feedback and
better discover bugs. Please share it widely so that we can collect more
feedback.

- For bug reports, please use https://github.com/ambuda-org/vidyut/issues .
- We are eager to partner with scholars and experts to better test our
system. If you are interested in working with us more closely, please
contact us at https://ambuda.org/contact.
- We have partial support for subantas and krdantas, but these are not
available in the demo yet.
- Testing was done by comparing our program to the output of SanskritVerb.
Most differences have been accounted for and are (we believe) in
vidyut-prakriya's favor, but a few small errors likely remain.

Regards,

Arun Prasad

Does this sound familiar, in a general way?

There is no skeletal evidence of violent death and no fortifications, said
[...]. Instead the society appears to have survived through cooperation and
sharing.
This statement is not, however, about the IVC, but about the Megalithic
culture of Malta.  And there's a newish interpretation of the famous
megalithic temples there. Here's the whole paragraph:

To achieve such complex collaborative effort something powerful must have
held the community together: the temples. Until now, the Temple Culture was
thought to have centered on the worship of a mother goddess, but Malone
thinks it was more of a clubhouse culture, focused on ritual and feasting
but where food?rather than a deity?was revered. In the complexes it is now
clear that the people displayed their livestock and harvests on special
benches and altars, feasted, and also stored food. There is no skeletal
evidence of violent death and no fortifications, said Malone. Instead the
society appears to have survived through cooperation and sharing.
-- Aisling Irwin, "Why a Thriving Civilization in Malta Collapsed 4,000
Years Ago

*Nautilus* July 2019.

Interesting to think about, a food-centric culture where hard labour is
normal and food is generally scarce.

Best,

Dear Professor Oberlin
Apologies for my delayed reply.
Thank you for finding and sharing the video. Extraordinary!
Particularly brilliantly is how the dancer enacts the baby elephant around
58 minutes in: the slight subtle delicate hand gesture-- very fine-- to
show the elephant trying to take the tooth from the lion's mouth time and
again thinking it to be a lotus stalk. The last one with the sleeping
mongoose is also brilliant (59 minutes or so in): the dancer enacts the
mongoose dozing off as the verse says and shaking himself awake, then
dozing off again, soothed by the snake licking him. All the gestures are so
fine and elegant -- and in their emphasis on suggestion as beauty all
remind me of Anandavardhana's ideas.

Thank you
Bihani

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Passing of Marie-Claude Porcher
Message-ID: <CANFkKBZM_FJ9c+tx3ybbRJDqoKqjfO97FrTVSTTebSJRzW0Fwg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indology members, dear friends and colleagues,

I am posting below, on behalf of Professor Sylvain Brocquet, a message
bearing the sad news of Professor Marie-Claude Porcher's passing. She was
one of my teachers when I began learning Sanskrit, and I remember with much
gratitude, admiration and affection her wonderful ability to share her love
for k?vya, her great generosity, and, beyond her reserved manners, her
delightful sense of humour. She will be greatly missed.
With my condolences to her family, friends, colleagues and students,
---
Isabelle Rati?
Professeur, D?partement des ?tudes Orientales, Sorbonne Nouvelle

*From Professor Brocquet, Aix-Marseille University:*

We have the regret to report the death of Marie-Claude Porcher, Professor
emerita of Sanskrit, on December, the 31st, at the age of 85. Her funeral
will take place on January, the 13th, at Nantoux (C?te d?Or, France), in
privacy.

Marie-Claude Porcher, before she retired, was long Professor of Sanskrit
language and literature in the University of Paris III, Sorbonne Nouvelle,
where her teaching was much appreciated by all her students. She
specialised in Sanskrit court poetry and Indian Poetics, and became a
prominent indologist in that field. She studied and translated into French
several works composed by Ve?ka??dhvarin, in particular his
*R?ghavay?dav?ya*, a difficult poem whose verses can be read from left to
right or from right to left, thus conveying two different meanings (
*anulomavilomak?vya*), and his *Vi?vagu??dar?acamp?* (both published in
1972). Her approach of Indian Poetics was very original and creative,
since, being an expert in Indian traditional ala?k?ra??stra, and in
contemporary linguistics and poetics as well, she could combine them to
provide analyses that proved to be relevant from both points or view, and
helped connoisseurs not aware of Indian categories to access a deep
understanding of Sanskrit poetry. Among many other scholarly works,
including articles on ambiguity and suggestion, her monography, *Figures de
style en Sanskrit*, complemented by the analysis of poems by the same
Ve?ka??dhvarin (published in 1978), has been for more than 40 years a
reference book that all indologists have recourse to. She was also a great
translator, who achieved a perfect balance between philological accuracy
and literary elegance, as witnessed by her translation of Da??in?s
*Da?akum?racarita* (published in 1995), probably the best of all the
renderings of that poetic narrative. She was also, with Madeleine Biardeau,
one of the two architects of the celebrated French translation of the
*R?m?ya?a* (published in 1999). By her vast knowledge of Indian literature
and theory, her intellectual openness to the contribution of the human
sciences, her taste for belles lettres and the literary quality of her
translations, she undoubtedly was one of the worthiest heirs to the French
indological tradition.

Dear colleagues,

for some time now I have been looking for a way to access the following 
work written by the missionary *Manoel da Assump?am*:

/*Vocabulario em idioma bengalla*, e portuguez. Dividido em duas partes 
dedicado ao Excellent. e Rever. Senhor. D. Fr. Miguel de Tavora 
Arcebispo de Evora do Concelho de Sua Magestade. Foy deligencia do Padre 
Fr. Manoel da Assump?am Religioso Eremita de Santo Agostinho da 
Congregaca? da India Oriental/. Lisboa: Na Offic. De Francisco da Sylva, 
1743.

Do any of you happen to have *scan*?

I?m aware of the incomplete reprint on archive.org 
(https://archive.org/details/dli.calcutta.10343/). Also, there seems to 
be a copy in the British Library 
(https://www.worldcat.org/de/title/561929336), at the University of 
Wisconsin (https://www.worldcat.org/de/title/16211468) and at the 
University of Regina (https://www.worldcat.org/de/title/25434181) ? far 
away from me.

Thank you for your time,

D. Haas

Does this sound familiar, in a general way?

There is no skeletal evidence of violent death and no fortifications, said [...]. Instead the society appears to have survived through cooperation and sharing.
This statement is not, however, about the IVC, but about the Megalithic culture of Malta.  And there's a newish interpretation of the famous megalithic temples there. Here's the whole paragraph:

To achieve such complex collaborative effort something powerful must have held the community together: the temples. Until now, the Temple Culture was thought to have centered on the worship of a mother goddess, but Malone thinks it was more of a clubhouse culture, focused on ritual and feasting but where food?rather than a deity?was revered. In the complexes it is now clear that the people displayed their livestock and harvests on special benches and altars, feasted, and also stored food. There is no skeletal evidence of violent death and no fortifications, said Malone. Instead the society appears to have survived through cooperation and sharing.

Interesting to think about, a food-centric culture where hard labour is normal and food is generally scarce.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Title of Sanskrit Dramas
Message-ID: <CAETY2G2-o6KQpw4ZXA-TrUuX+gH10Djr-=cfVhziNRZn_Gi65Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I read quite some time ago an article by Stephan Levitt on the titles of
Sanskrit dramas (here
<http://www.asiainstitutetorino.it/indologica/volumes/vol31/08_Levitt.pdf>).
In nuce Abhij??na??kuntalam (or -?akuntal?) has been misunderstood and
should mean something like "The Story of ?akuntal? by means of a Ring". The
v?ddhi derivative by P. 4.3.87 and the compound by P. 2.1.30. He also
accounts for the variants in the title by reference to other rules from the
A???dhy?y?. I was wondering whether this explanation has been widely
accepted or if someone has responded to it. Thanks.

All the Best,
Victor

Dear Indology members, dear friends and colleagues,

I wish to join my voice to those of my colleagues, Isabelle Rati? and Sylvain Brocquet. The very sad news of Professor Marie-Claude Porcher's passing came as a shock to me who had recently sent her my greetings for the New Year. I owe her for having given a significant turn to my life and career, encouraging me to choose Indian theatre and aesthetics as my first field of research. During the long period of her supervision of my D. Lit. thesis, bonds of friendship were created that never faded. And she did the same with some other students, so discreetly radiant was her personality. That is the image we will keep of her.
An internationally recognized specialist of Sanskrit k?vya and Poetics, Marie-Claude Porcher was a philologist in the full sense of the word, a lover of the texts and of the language, thus a very precise as well as subtle translator and exegete. Professor Sylvain Brocquet having faithfully described her wide range of talents and cited her major publications, I will confine myself to pay tribute to her accomplishments in the field of Indian theatre, as witnessed by her contributions to Th??tres indiens, the collective volume published in 1998, and to Th??tre de l?Inde ancienne, an anthology of Sanskrit theatre, published in the collection of La Pl?iade (Gallimard, 2006).

Les ?mes des d?funts brillent dans le ciel d?hiver.

Objet : [INDOLOGY] Passing of Marie-Claude Porcher

Dear Indology members, dear friends and colleagues,

I am posting below, on behalf of Professor Sylvain Brocquet, a message bearing the sad news of Professor Marie-Claude Porcher's passing. She was one of my teachers when I began learning Sanskrit, and I remember with much gratitude, admiration and affection her wonderful ability to share her love for k?vya, her great generosity, and, beyond her reserved manners, her delightful sense of humour. She will be greatly missed.
With my condolences to her family, friends, colleagues and students,
---
Isabelle Rati?
Professeur, D?partement des ?tudes Orientales, Sorbonne Nouvelle

From Professor Brocquet, Aix-Marseille University:

We have the regret to report the death of Marie-Claude Porcher, Professor emerita of Sanskrit, on December, the 31st, at the age of 85. Her funeral will take place on January, the 13th, at Nantoux (C?te d?Or, France), in privacy.

Marie-Claude Porcher, before she retired, was long Professor of Sanskrit language and literature in the University of Paris III, Sorbonne Nouvelle, where her teaching was much appreciated by all her students. She specialised in Sanskrit court poetry and Indian Poetics, and became a prominent indologist in that field. She studied and translated into French several works composed by Ve?ka??dhvarin, in particular his R?ghavay?dav?ya, a difficult poem whose verses can be read from left to right or from right to left, thus conveying two different meanings (anulomavilomak?vya), and his Vi?vagu??dar?acamp? (both published in 1972). Her approach of Indian Poetics was very original and creative, since, being an expert in Indian traditional ala?k?ra??stra, and in contemporary linguistics and poetics as well, she could combine them to provide analyses that proved to be relevant from both points or view, and helped connoisseurs not aware of Indian categories to access a deep understanding of Sanskrit poetry. Among many other scholarly works, including articles on ambiguity and suggestion, her monography, Figures de style en Sanskrit, complemented by the analysis of poems by the same Ve?ka??dhvarin (published in 1978), has been for more than 40 years a reference book that all indologists have recourse to. She was also a great translator, who achieved a perfect balance between philological accuracy and literary elegance, as witnessed by her translation of Da??in?s Da?akum?racarita (published in 1995), probably the best of all the renderings of that poetic narrative. She was also, with Madeleine Biardeau, one of the two architects of the celebrated French translation of the R?m?ya?a (published in 1999). By her vast knowledge of Indian literature and theory, her intellectual openness to the contribution of the human sciences, her taste for belles lettres and the literary quality of her translations, she undoubtedly was one of the worthiest heirs to the French indological tradition.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Publication Announcement
Message-ID: <CAHXN0FvtFVWMcbPT0+g__GEQxkn_AbhsKEtm1FB0txDCuG=7_w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce the publication of the Felicitation Volume for
Eivind Kahrs in the series Studia Indologica Uiversitatis Halensis:

Alastair Gornall (ed.)J??napra?a?s?: In Praise of Knowledge: Essays in
Honour of E. G. Kahrs
This edited volume brings together fifteen essays on classical Sanskrit,
Pali, and Tamil literature from South and Southeast Asia in honour of
Eivind Georg Kahrs, who was Reader in Sanskrit at the University of
Cambridge from 1989 to 2017. E. G. Kahrs?s contributions to the scholarship
on Southern Asia?s traditional language sciences, particularly
*vy?kara?a* ?grammar?
and *nirukta* ?semantic analysis?, brought new attention to these fields
within the cultural and intellectual history of the region and redefined
their study. The essays in this volume reflect E. G. Kahrs?s main research
and teaching interests, especially traditional Southern Asian grammar and
lexicography, Sanskrit and Pali literature, Buddhist philosophy, and the
history of Orientalist and colonial philology. The volume is also prefaced
with a concise overview of E. G. Kahrs?s academic career and a bibliography
of his work to date.

What a sad news. I remember with lot of affection our conversations on Indian poetics at the Library of the Coll?ge de France, and her constant support to my research, though I was not one of her students.
My sincere condoleances to her family, to her colleagues, to all her students,

 #yiv2596587611 P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}Dear Indology members, dear friends and colleagues,
I wish to join my voice to those of my colleagues, Isabelle Rati? and Sylvain Brocquet. The very sad news of Professor Marie-Claude Porcher's passing came as a shock to me who had recently sent her my greetings for the New Year. I owe her for having given a significant turn to my life and career, encouraging me to choose Indian theatre and aesthetics as my first field of research. During the long period of her supervision of my D. Lit. thesis, bonds of friendship were created that never faded. And she did the same with some other students, so discreetly radiant was her personality. That is the image we will keep of her.An internationally recognized specialist of Sanskrit k?vya and Poetics, Marie-Claude Porcher was a philologist in the full sense of the word, a lover of the texts and of the language, thus a very precise as well as subtle translator and exegete. Professor Sylvain Brocquet having faithfully described her wide range of talents and cited her major publications, I will confine myself to pay tribute to her accomplishments in the field of Indian theatre, as witnessed by her contributions to Th??tres indiens, the collective volume published in 1998, and toTh??tre de l?Inde ancienne, an anthology of Sanskrit theatre, published in the collection of La Pl?iade (Gallimard, 2006).
Les ?mes des d?funts brillent dans le ciel d?hiver.

Objet : [INDOLOGY] Passing of Marie-Claude Porcher?Dear Indology members, dear friends and colleagues,
I am posting below, on behalf of Professor Sylvain Brocquet, a message bearing the sad news of Professor Marie-Claude Porcher's passing. She was one of my teachers when I began learning Sanskrit, and I remember with much gratitude, admiration and affection her wonderful ability to share her love for?k?vya, her great generosity, and, beyond her reserved manners, her delightful sense of humour. She will be greatly missed.With my condolences to her family, friends, colleagues and students,---Isabelle Rati?Professeur, D?partement des??tudes Orientales, Sorbonne Nouvelle
>From Professor Brocquet, Aix-Marseille University:
We have the regret to report the death of Marie-Claude Porcher, Professor emerita of Sanskrit, on December, the 31st, at the age of 85. Her funeral will take place on January, the 13th, at Nantoux (C?te d?Or, France), in privacy.

Marie-Claude Porcher, before she retired, was long Professor of Sanskrit language and literature in the University of Paris III, Sorbonne Nouvelle, where her teaching was much appreciated by all her students. She specialised in Sanskrit court poetry and Indian Poetics, and became a prominent indologist in that field. She studied and translated into French several works composed by Ve?ka??dhvarin, in particular hisR?ghavay?dav?ya, a difficult poem whose verses can be read from left to right or from right to left, thus conveying two different meanings (anulomavilomak?vya), and hisVi?vagu??dar?acamp? (both published in 1972). Her approach of Indian Poetics was very original and creative, since, being an expert in Indian traditional ala?k?ra??stra, and in contemporary linguistics and poetics as well, she could combine them to provide analyses that proved to be relevant from both points or view, and helped connoisseurs not aware of Indian categories to access a deep understanding of Sanskrit poetry. Among many other scholarly works, including articles on ambiguity and suggestion, her monography,Figures de style en Sanskrit, complemented by the analysis of poems by the same Ve?ka??dhvarin (published in 1978), has been for more than 40 years a reference book that all indologists have recourse to. She was also a great translator, who achieved a perfect balance between philological accuracy and literary elegance, as witnessed by her translation of Da??in?sDa?akum?racarita (published in 1995), probably the best of all the renderings of that poetic narrative. She was also, with Madeleine Biardeau, one of the two architects of the celebrated French translation of theR?m?ya?a (published in 1999). By her vast knowledge of Indian literature and theory, her intellectual openness to the contribution of the human sciences, her taste for belles lettres and the literary quality of her translations, she undoubtedly was one of the worthiest heirs to the French indological tradition.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] What is "prose"?
Message-ID: <CAOCtTAv1mjgtFxbkTeVxDikfKuH-2j8NGvbFOo-MG8b41cOp_g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I am looking for publications on the concept of "prose" in Sanskrit.
Whereas definitions of "verse" are more or less common, if only by looking
at examples of specific types of stanzas or verses, it seems that the
concept of prose is more vague, generally meaning "whatever is not
organised in p?das". Of course, in poetic treatises the concept *gadya *or*
c?r?a* is used, and genres like the *camp?* presuppose the
dichotomy verse-prose. But I would like to know if this is critically
discussed elsewhere.

Apart from references to primary sources in Indian texts, I am also
interested in definitions of Sanskrit (or Prakrit, or Tamil, etc.) prose in
modern scholarly literature. My understanding is that a concept like
"Sanskrit prose" is taken for granted and we all are supposed to know what
it means, so it is difficult to find definitions or sub-classifications of
it. This seems to happen with Pali, and the moment we try to classify types
of prose we are already discussing literary genres or types of texts (the 9
a?gas), not types of prose per se, with the exception, perhaps, with the
so-called metrical prose of the ve?ha (var?aka) portions.

I am also interested in the origins or verse and prose in general, in world
literature.

Any help will be most appreciated.

With best wishes,
Aleix

Dear Aleix,
You raise a very interesting topic. I checked two publications (Walter J. Ong, Orality and Literacy, and Rosalind Thomas, Literacy and Orality in Ancient Greece). Both authors do not discuss prose (not found in the respective indexes). They deal with the opposition between orality/oral poetry and literacy, almost as if literacy subsumes prose (including inventory lists, shopping lists, etc.)
With kind regards, Herman

Dear Madhavji

Every Unicode font that is well implemented should support all the
combinations of diacritics. For instance, here is what I get with Times New
Roman and Arial, with length, nasal, and accents.

Attached is the word document I used. Let me know if it doesn't show
correctly on your machines.

Thanks,
Suresh.

Dear Madhav,

As Suresh Kolichala says, several Unicode fonts include all the requisite glyphs.  I think you were also asking about a suitable keylaylout for Mac, to produce them.  EasyUnicode can handle that.  The basic repertoire of Indic transliteration characters are specially assigned to Opt+character+[letter] or Opt+Shift+[letter].

But the full set of ?Unicode Combining Diacritical Marks? (0301-0362) are also available with EasyUnicode.

To add one to any letter, first type the letter destined to bear the diacritical mark, and then press opt+1 (a ring will appear temporarily) and then press the key assigned to the desired diacritical mark per the chart below.  For example:
   i. Type the letter "?"
   ii. Press "option+1"
   iii. Press "e" which is assigned for the Unicode "Combining Acute Accent" (0301). Result: ??
[cid:image001.jpg at 01D9291C.22E42360]
Examples:Acute: "option+1" and "e", Greve: "option+1" and "@", Breve: "option+1" and "b", Caron: "option+1" and "v",Ring below: "option+1" and "r"


Alternative diacritical marks can be called by "option+1" and then pressing "shift" key.
Examples: Breve Below: "option+1" and "shift+b", Caron Below: "option+1" and "shift+v":

Thanks, Tim. Will give it a try. Often writing about P??ini, a need arises
to show triple marking - length, nasality and accent. Lately I have had
some difficulty in producing such triple markings.

Madhav,

On the Mac, if you use a unicode-compatible font (e.g. Times New Roman) and select ABD - Extended for the keyboard, you can put together something like this ??? as follows: Option a + a = ?; ? + Shift Option n = ??; ?? plus Shift Option e = ???. The important thing to not is that after the first diacritic (which you insert with the usual Option selection before selecting the base character), any other diacritics have to be added after the base character by using Shift Option.

I don?t know whether you can go beyond adding three diacritics (I haven?t tried or needed to), but for what you are concerned with, the above should work.

I hope this helps.

Thanks, Tim. Will give it a try. Often writing about P??ini, a need arises to show triple marking - length, nasality and accent. Lately I have had some difficulty in producing such triple markings.

Dear Madhav,

As Suresh Kolichala says, several Unicode fonts include all the requisite glyphs.  I think you were also asking about a suitable keylaylout for Mac, to produce them.  EasyUnicode can handle that.  The basic repertoire of Indic transliteration characters are specially assigned to Opt+character+[letter] or Opt+Shift+[letter].

But the full set of ?Unicode Combining Diacritical Marks? (0301-0362) are also available with EasyUnicode.

To add one to any letter, first type the letter destined to bear the diacritical mark, and then press opt+1 (a ring will appear temporarily) and then press the key assigned to the desired diacritical mark per the chart below.  For example:
   i. Type the letter "?"
   ii. Press "option+1"
   iii. Press "e" which is assigned for the Unicode "Combining Acute Accent" (0301). Result: ??
<image001.jpg>
Examples:Acute: "option+1" and "e", Greve: "option+1" and "@", Breve: "option+1" and "b", Caron: "option+1" and "v",Ring below: "option+1" and "r"


Alternative diacritical marks can be called by "option+1" and then pressing "shift" key.
Examples: Breve Below: "option+1" and "shift+b", Caron Below: "option+1" and "shift+v":

Dear Madhavji

Every Unicode font that is well implemented should support all the combinations of diacritics. For instance, here is what I get with Times New Roman and Arial, with length, nasal, and accents.

<image003.png>

Attached is the word document I used. Let me know if it doesn't show correctly on your machines.

Thanks,
Suresh.

Thanks, Hans. Wow, this solution works on my Mac. Now the next question is
this. When Pa?n?ini says that "ai, au" are nasal and uda?tta or svarita,
where do we place the signs for nasality and accent? On both segments of
"ai, au," or only on the final segment? We don't have this dilemma in
Devanagari.

Good question about where to place diacritics over ai and au.

I?m not sure what the up-to-date Indological convention is. I note that Titus puts the accent mark on the a-component (as in dy?ur); I have put it on the i- or u- component. I suspect that the diacritics will show better on a than in the very narrow symbol i. So maybe the Titus convention is the way to go

Thanks, Hans. Wow, this solution works on my Mac. Now the next question is this. When Pa?n?ini says that "ai, au" are nasal and uda?tta or svarita, where do we place the signs for nasality and accent? On both segments of "ai, au," or only on the final segment? We don't have this dilemma in Devanagari.

Madhav,

On the Mac, if you use a unicode-compatible font (e.g. Times New Roman) and select ABD - Extended for the keyboard, you can put together something like this ??? as follows: Option a + a = ?; ? + Shift Option n = ??; ?? plus Shift Option e = ???. The important thing to not is that after the first diacritic (which you insert with the usual Option selection before selecting the base character), any other diacritics have to be added after the base character by using Shift Option.

I don?t know whether you can go beyond adding three diacritics (I haven?t tried or needed to), but for what you are concerned with, the above should work.

I hope this helps.

Thanks, Tim. Will give it a try. Often writing about P??ini, a need arises to show triple marking - length, nasality and accent. Lately I have had some difficulty in producing such triple markings.

Dear Madhav,

As Suresh Kolichala says, several Unicode fonts include all the requisite glyphs.  I think you were also asking about a suitable keylaylout for Mac, to produce them.  EasyUnicode can handle that.  The basic repertoire of Indic transliteration characters are specially assigned to Opt+character+[letter] or Opt+Shift+[letter].

But the full set of ?Unicode Combining Diacritical Marks? (0301-0362) are also available with EasyUnicode.

To add one to any letter, first type the letter destined to bear the diacritical mark, and then press opt+1 (a ring will appear temporarily) and then press the key assigned to the desired diacritical mark per the chart below.  For example:
   i. Type the letter "?"
   ii. Press "option+1"
   iii. Press "e" which is assigned for the Unicode "Combining Acute Accent" (0301). Result: ??
<image001.jpg>
Examples:Acute: "option+1" and "e", Greve: "option+1" and "@", Breve: "option+1" and "b", Caron: "option+1" and "v",Ring below: "option+1" and "r"


Alternative diacritical marks can be called by "option+1" and then pressing "shift" key.
Examples: Breve Below: "option+1" and "shift+b", Caron Below: "option+1" and "shift+v":

Dear Madhavji

Every Unicode font that is well implemented should support all the combinations of diacritics. For instance, here is what I get with Times New Roman and Arial, with length, nasal, and accents.

<image003.png>

Attached is the word document I used. Let me know if it doesn't show correctly on your machines.

Thanks,
Suresh.

Hans,

     At least on my Mac, your solution seems to work for a???, i???, u???,
r???? and l??? but does not seem to work for e and o. On e and o, it allows
me to add either nasality or accent, but not both.

I want to thank everyone who helped me figure out how to type multiple

this, thanks to all of you. With best wishes,

Dear list members,
Custom keyboards can be created for the Mac assigning any unicode character
or combination of characters to any key using the application Ukalele from
SIL https://software.sil.org/ukelele/
The instructions come with the download and its very straightforward to use
(even for this Windows user :-) ).  I've sent a solution to Madhav with the
diacritics he needs.

For Windows users  its even more straightforward. In microsoft word,
documents called templates can be created that re-assign keys to any
unicode character you want. These templates are then attached to any
document you want to use the new keyboard with.

Dear Evgeniya,

I do not have a pdf of the paper, but you can find it in:  Charles Malamoud, L'Inde fondamentale (Hermann, 1978), which is a collection of Renou's main articles. It might be easier to find it.

I would like to share a recent article by Sivan Goren-Arzony, directly
related to my question, and from which I benefited a great deal (please see

Hello Aleix,

I remember many years ago looking up this old article by Hermann Oldenberg "Zur
Geschichte der altindischen Prosa." It is included in Hermann Oldenberg:
Kleine Schriften, pt. 3, edited by Hanns-Peter Schmidt. I don't have a pdf,
but hopefully you may be able to locate it. If my memory serves me
correctly, there is some interesting discussion of the different kinds of
Gadya in V?mana's K?vy?la?k?ras?tras. The traditional distinction between
Vedic R?c and Yajus is also based on metrical versus prose compositions.
Will see if I can locate the textual reference for this discussion. That is
something to consider in the history of Sanskrit prose.

Dear all,

Does anyone happen to have an electronic copy of

  BHATTA, C. PANDURANGA. "Textual Criticism of Abhij??na?akuntala on the
Basis of K??ayavema?s Commentary" *Altorientalische Forschungen*, vol. 20,
no. 1, 1993, pp. 156-161. https://doi.org/10.1524/aofo.1993.20.1.156

I cannot access the article online through my institution as our
subscription only starts with the volumes of 1995.

On a related note, when reading about the details of K??ayavema's life, I
have found references to his "introductory verses" on the ??kuntala (here
<https://archive.org/details/FDkf_vikramorvasiya-nataka-of-kalidasa-with-kumara-giri-rajiya-katayavema-commentary-/page/n34/mode/1up>),
but in the edition I have, ed. by C. Sankara Rama Sastri (here
<https://archive.org/details/AbhijnanaSakuntala/page/n65/mode/2up>), there
is only a single verse. Are there more verses in other editions? I still
need to have a look at MS catalogs where more verses might be recorded, but
if there is another edition containing the mentioned verses, that would be
helpful.

All the Best,
Victor



All the Best,
Victor

Thank you very much for the quick and kind responses.

Should anyone else need the article, it is here:

If someone has a pdf of the edition by the Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Academy,
1982, I would much appreciate it.

Dear Professor Deshpande,

Thank you very much for the reference. Indeed, Oldenberg's essay is very
insightful and I am reading it at the moment. If anyone needs the pdf, I
can send it privately.

With many thanks and best wishes,
Aleix

One verse more in the introduction of  K??ayavema's commentary in the Parab edition:
https://archive.org/details/MalavikagnimitramOfKalidasa-SktCommentary-KpParab/page/n3/mode/2up
The one or two verse given by these two editions are not found in the longer introduction (several verses) given in the Thanjavur catalogue vol. 8, no. 4306, pp. 3335 sv. (see also no. 4305 for a first verse same as in the editions)

Dear all,

I just put the whole volume online, in case someone wants to download it:
https://michaelmeyer.fr/blobs/Renou_Fondamentale.pdf

This is actually the document distributed on archive.org. Books that
(theoretically) can only be borrowed online can in fact be downloaded,
although in a roundabout way.

Best,
Micha?l Meyer

Dear List members,

Below you may find the link to my book on the A?oka inscriptions:

The A?oka Inscriptions: Analysing a Corpus, Delhi" Primus Books, 2023.

https://primusbooks.com/ancient/the-asoka-inscriptions-analysing-a-corpus-by-herman-tieken/

The text on the jacket is of necessity brief. In it the division of labour is mentioned between the Rock Edict Series found along the borders of the realm and the Pillar Edict Series found in the centre. I may add the division of labour between the so-called Schism Edict (the Sa?ghabheda Edict) and the Minor Rock Edicts: the former, which deal with the sedentary period in the yearly calendar of the of the Buddhist monks, is found in North India in what have become extensive Buddhist settlements, the latter, which deal with the wandering period, signpost resting places along the route into India south of the Vindhya Range; that between the Rock Edict Series and the two Minor Rock Edicts in E??agu?i; that between the Minor Rock Edict and the so-called preamble at P??gur?ri?; and that between the Seventh Pillar Edict and both the Rock and Pillar Edicts Series.

I saw that Amazon.in has photos of the table of contents of the book.

With kind regards, Herman

Objet : Re: Marie-claude Porcher


Dear Professor Lyne Bansat-Boudon,

            Your email of January 13, 2023 to hand. The sad news of the demise of profound scholar Marie-Claude Porcher has immensely shocked me. My meetings with Marie-Claude Porcher during my several Paris-visits are still fresh in my mind. Her command over Indian poetics and Sanskrit literature, her translations of R?ghavay?dav?ya of Ve?ka??dhvarin which familiarized, a less-known category of Sanskrit poetry, are well-known to the lovers of Sanskrit language and literature all over the world. However, her translation of Da?akum?racarita, one of the best Sanskrit narratives, is considered to be best of all her translations. Her rare insight reflected into her work on Sanskrit poetics is a landmark among the French writings on the subjects in which her deep understanding of the Sanskrit literary criticism is remarkably present. She translated R?m?ya?a with Madeleine Biardeau, which is really a glorious contribution for familiarizing one of the great Indian classics to French-knowing lovers of world-classics.

            I join in my condolences to her family, friends and fellow-Indologists all over France.

It is my sad duty to convey to you the news of Professor Marie-Claude Porcher's passing.
I know that you appreciated her personality and her work, and that you would have wished to be informed.
I am attaching the sequence of "posts" deposited in the Indology website, which includes my own hommage to her.

Dear colleagues,

With great pleasure I would like to draw your attention to a new  
publication of our Ukrainian colleagues:
"The World of the Orient" (??????? ????), No. 4 (2022) "Commemorating  
the 150th Birthday of Pavlo Ritter" (open access).
https://oriental-world.org.ua/index.php/journal/issue/view/39
The articles in this issue dedicated to Ukrainian Indologist Pavlo  
Ritter (1872-1939) are written in English and Ukrainian, and some of  
them also deal with Indological topics. That this volume could appear  
at all borders on a miracle in view of the continuing inhuman and  
brutal attacks, and one can only admire the courage and determination  
of the Ukrainian Scholars.

With kind regards

Dear Colleague,



I am happy to inform you that the International Standard Terminology
documents of Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani have been published by WHO.



The documents are essential tools that will provide a universally accepted
interface between modern science and the time tested health care practices
of traditional medicine. This is a mile stone in WHO?s work to support
Member States to appropriately integrate traditional medicine in health
system, for research, and effective communication between various medical
systems.



Kindly do the needful to disseminate the same widely, especially where
these systems are mostly regulated and has high community acceptance and
buy-in.



PF the links to the documents below:

Dear colleagues,

on this occasion I would like to mention that a host and location for 
the next IIGRS has yet to be found. Until now this graduate symposium 
has always taken place in Europe, but as the name includes 
"international", other locations would of course qualify as well. For 
further information, please visit the IIGRS website 
https://iigrs.wordpress.com/ or write to iigrsuk at googlemail.com. Please 
feel free to forward this information especially to younger colleagues 
and graduate students.

We really enjoyed holding this symposium in Vienna and very much hope 
that the IIGRS will live on and prosper!

Best wishes,
Vitus Angermeier

Hello all,

I have been swimming around trying to locate the earliest known physical representation of the matsyavatara. I assume this must fall somewhere between Deogarh and the 9/10th century British Museum piece (1872,0701.50)? Thanks to all in advance for any references you can provide.

Best,
Chris

Dear friends and colleagues,

recently I have asked ? and immediately received ? a soft copy of an article by La Vall?e-Poussin. As an ideal follow-up of that request (but this time on behalf of a person who is not on the list), I?m now searching for two article by La Vall?e-Poussin which were published contiguously in the same volume: 

? ?P?r?ya?a cit? dans J??naprasth?na?, in ?tudes d'Orientalisme publi?es par le Mus?e Guimet ? la m?moire de Raymonde Linossier, t?me. II: 323?327, Paris (1932)

I thank you in advance for your help and collaboration.

[with apologies for cross-posting]

Dear Colleagues,

The American Academy of Religion is now accepting proposals for this year's annual meeting, which will be held in San Antonio, Texas, November 18-21. Below please find the CFP for the Hindu Philosophy unit. Proposals should be submitted through the PAPERS<https://papers.aarweb.org/> system; the deadline is 5pm (EST) on Wednesday, March 1. I hope some of you will consider submitting.

Best wishes,
Michael

Michael S. Allen (unit co-chair, with Parimal Patil)
Assistant Professor

University of Virginia



The Hindu Philosophy unit of the American Academy of Religion is pleased to invite proposals for the following sessions to be held at this year?s Annual Meeting:



1. Philosophical Roundtable. This year?s roundtable will focus on the nature of poetic language. ?nandavardhana famously held that in addition to the literal and implicative functions of language, poetry expresses meaning through a third, distinctive function: suggestion (dhvani, vya?jan?). Mukula Bha??a, in his Abhidh?v?ttam?t?k?, holds that there is no need to posit a third semantic function; implication (lak?a??) suffices to explain the communicative power of poetry. Note that the goal of this format is not to have traditional presentations but to create a space for lively and rigorous debate. In lieu of traditional paper proposals, therefore, we instead invite prospective participants to offer a brief critical analysis of the debate. One might, for example, assess the strengths and weaknesses of each position, or defend ?nandavardhana?s position against Mukula?s arguments, or consider alternative explanations of poetic suggestion by later theorists such as Mahima Bha??a, or reflect on the debate in light of contemporary philosophy of language.



2. Traditional Papers Session. For this session we are looking for individual paper proposals (rather than full panel proposals). We are open to a wide range of topics and approaches. Possible topics include but are by no means limited to: Arguments for and against God?s Existence, Subjectivity and Selfhood, Epistemology, Novelty in Navya-Ny?ya (or other schools), ?Hindu Philosophy? as a Category, Philosophy of Materiality, Philosophy of Language, Philosophy and Literature, and Philosophy in Vernacular Texts.



3. Co-sponsored Sessions. We also seek papers for two possible co-sponsored sessions: one on comparative Hindu and Islamic philosophy (for co-sponsorship with Islamic Mysticism or The Study of Islam), the other on theories of knowledge in lesser known schools (for co-sponsorship with Indian and Chinese Religions Compared).

New open access publications in the series "Documenta Nepalica"
Bajracharya, Manik (Ed.), Slavery and Unfree Labour in Nepal: Documents from the 18th to Early 20th Century<https://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/heiup/catalog/book/1003>, Heidelberg: Heidelberg University Publishing, 2022 (Documenta Nepalica ? Book Series, Vol. 3), DOI: 10.17885/heiup.1003<https://doi.org/10.17885/heiup.1003>.

The topic of slavery is largely under-represented in the historiography of Nepal. This source book, aware of this disparity and wishing to encourage future studies on the topic, provides the reader with editions, translations and a study of selected documents and legal texts of Nepal from the period of the eighteenth to the early twentieth century. These sources are concerned with such different aspects of slavery as donations, transactions, bondservitude, forced labour, emancipation, and law.

Dear Colleagues,

With apologies for cross posting, I am looking for textual sources on the
various triads embodied by ?iva's tri??la. I have Sanderson's article on
the *tri??l?bjama??alam*, which has been helpful in relation to the triads
of *icch?, j??na, kriy? ?akti*s and *par?, par?par?, apar?, *but I am
having difficulty tracking down sources for the other common associations.
Below are the triads I am most interested in, yet I am open to any others
(and there are many):

   - *triloka*
   - *trim?rti*
   - *trigu?a*
   - *i??, pi?gala, su?um??*

Dear Indology List,

Below is the call for proposals for the AAR's Seminar on the Mah?bh?rata and Classical Hinduism.  The meeting is scheduled for November 18-21, 2023.
The Seminar?s call for papers for its third year includes "Regional, Vernacular, and Performative Mah?bh?rata Traditions."  This session would be devoted to texts and traditions of Mah?bh?rata performances such as theater, dance, and recitation, and vernacular language textual traditions, with a focus on the religious uses of these traditions.  Modern retellings in pulp, graphic, and film formats are also relevant to this area of inquiry.
In response to the 2023 Presidential Theme, we also include a call for proposals on the Mah?bh?rata?s depictions of serving or marginalized classes ? the d?s?s, the s?tas, the hunters and butchers and fisher-folk, emphasizing their roles as exemplars of wisdom and dharma.  We are also interested in proposals that consider the literal and figurative "handcrafting" of Mah?bh?rata, by authors ancient or modern who contribute in original ways to leave their mark on retellings of epic narratives.
In an effort to encourage diversity in seminar participants, those who presented papers in our 2022 meeting are unlikely to have proposals accepted for the 2023 meeting.  We seek to include the best proposals we receive, and to seek publication opportunities for them.  Proposals are due in PAPERS by March 1.
As we operate as a seminar, proposals that we accept are to be presented as completed papers and are due October 1.  These papers will be circulated on our Listserv so we can read them before the meeting, and each paper will receive about half an hour of discussion at the meeting with the aim to offer suggestions for improving and extending the papers for possible publication.
Best,
Brian
