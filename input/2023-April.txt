Dear colleagues,

Does anyone know or has an access to the entire projected list of volumes in the "Historical Sourcebooks in Classical Indian Thought" series edited by Sheldon Pollock? Of course, the volumes on Dharma, Rasa, and ?abda are already out, but what is the list of knowledge systems that are expected to be covered? I couldn't find anything on the web, including the CUP website.

Thanks Madhav,
I did notice you did use the l under-circle in your Sanskrit Primer for ?.
As far as I could see you used the full ISO-15919 in your book.

In the Muktabodha digital library we make etexts available in IAST,
Harvard-Kyoto and Velthuis.  For the IAST version of  texts there is no
problem because   (l underbar)   *?*  for *?* is part of the IAST standard.
But for Harvard-Kyoto and Velthuis versions of future texts I need to add a
transliteration code for *? *and I haven't been able to find one in any
on-line documentation I've found.  So I'm wondering if such a thing exists
officially or unofficially as part of these standards or if I have to
invent something.

Velthuis uses ? as the transliteration of this letter and you can get 
the glyph using the velthuis-TeX engine by typing La

About the transliteration of ? Francoise Patte wrote: "Velthuis uses ? as
the transliteration of this letter ".

I'm confused by that answer, I was under the impression that Velthuis
transliteration was strictly a 7-bit transliteration system and no letters
with diacriticals either over or under were part of its system of
transliteration.  So that both Velthuis and HK transliteration could be
typed directly from any QWERTY keyboard?

Thanks,

It is! What I meant is that the ? letter is transliterated "La" in the 
Velthuis-transliteration code.

Dear Colleagues,



I am happy to invite you to the Tenth Annual Mahavir Jayanti Lecture at
FIU. The lecture, *?Beyond Religious Toleration: The Jain Haribhadra's
Engagements with Religious Others,?* will be delivered by *Dr. Anil
Mundra* (Rutgers
University-New Brunswick). It is an in-person event that will be
live-streamed as a webinar. Please register here
<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/annual-mahavir-jayanti-lecture-tickets-587912631507>
.



Time: 7pm EDT, Friday, April 7, 2023

Location: SASC 100, MMC, FIU

Webinar: https://www.facebook.com/fiusipa/



*Beyond Religious Toleration: The Jain Haribhadra's Engagements with
Religious Others*

Jainism is sometimes touted as the tolerant religion par excellence.
Meanwhile, many political theorists have urged moving beyond mere
toleration, which can imply condescension or aloofness. In this
presentation, Dr. Mundra will argue that the ?vet?mbara scholar-monk
Haribhadras?ri personifies a Jain tradition of robust engagement with other
religious ideas that avoids many of the hazards of toleration as typically
understood in modern democratic liberalism.



*Guest Speaker*: Dr. Anil Mundra is the Alka Siddhartha Dalal Postdoctoral
Fellow in the study of Jainism at Rutgers University. His work examines how
Jain philosophers and others deal with religious diversity and
disagreement. His doctoral dissertation, "No Identity Without Diversity:
Haribhadras?ri's Anek?ntav?da as a Jain Response to Doctrinal Difference,"
focuses on how the classical Jain theory of non-one-sidedness allows an
influential ?vet?mbara Jain scholar-monk to intervene in philosophical
debates and define a Jain identity within them. He aims to bring such
classical discourses into conversation with contemporary philosophical
concerns, showing how each can enrich and strengthen the other. He received
his PhD from the Divinity School of the University of Chicago in 2022,
where he also completed his MA and BA. Before coming to Rutgers, he taught
at the College of the Holy Cross, Brandeis University, and Loyola Marymount
University.

It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the
individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a
relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and
its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or
demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for
the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and
that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have
experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their
time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of
someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, *Playing and Reality*

Dear list members,

this is the second call for participation in the conference DICSEP 10 (Dubrovnik International Conference on Sanskrit Epics and Pur??as 10).

Although the deadline for submitting titles for presentations, panels and workshops has passed, those who have not announced a title can still submit an abstract until the end of April (iandrij at ffzg.hr <mailto:iandrij at ffzg.hr> and jezic.mislav at gmail.com <mailto:jezic.mislav at gmail.com>). Presentations, panels and workshops will be held live at the conference, but it will be possible to watch presentations online and participate in the discussions via Zoom. For online participation, we will post a separate call with details on this list.

All information about the conference, participation and accommodation in Dubrovnik is available at the conference website <https://dicsep.org/>.

Dear list members,
Creepy things are still happening from Academia.edu on my gmail account.
A whle ago I had noticed too many postings from Academia.edu related to the
topics of email conversations I had been having so I cancelled it, but I
then re-instated it.

These conincidences keep happening.

I just received the latest posting by Mrinal Kaul to the indology list,  a
half hour later Academia.edu sent me "PDF by Mrinal Kaul,  Review: The
??varapratyabhij??k?rik? of Utpaladeva".

Dear Pranav,

Thanks for sharing the information about this Ms. Earlier I came across a
printed version of this commentary here
<https://archive.org/details/lTxD_ashtavakra-gita-with-tika-by-vishveshvar-very-old-mumukshu-bhavan-collection/mode/2up>.
But given the popularity of the *A???vakra G?t?*, this commentary did not
come across as pedagogically robust. It is hard for me to believe that this
text did not attract the attention of erudite Sanskrit commentators
in pre-modern South Asia. I will keep my eyes open. Thanks. Regards.

Mrinal

Check the NCC, where you will learn that while there are several 
commentaries, only Vi?ve?vara's was apparently popular, as it is 
preserved in a large number of manuscripts (and has been published 
several times).

That's quite suspicious.  Perhaps Kaul had a burst of online business and
posted to INDOLOGY and *at the same time* uploaded the review to Academia,
which triggered your notification.  We can't tell from Academia when papers
are uploaded, but the review has 317 views, which suggests it was uploaded
a while ago, not recently.  So that explanation is probably wrong.

How could Academia possibly be getting information about your incoming
emails?  What mechanism can we imagine?  Emails don't deposit cookies, so
cross-site cookies aren't the pathway.  If Academia is harvesting from the
INDOLOGY archive, which is technically possible, then *everyone* would get
the Kaul notification or similar ones, not just you.  It's hard to see how
this might work.  Without a plausible mechanism, I'm staying with
coincidence.

But I have all my Academia notifications turned off, so I never get
anything from them.  If I want to know their stuff, I look at the website.

Best,
Dominik

This might just be a coincidence. But would it be possible if someone 
uses Academia.edu through a Google login, with their gmail account, that 
some kind of triggering mechanism comes to apply?

I once uploaded an article to Academia and, since then, I receive
notifications every day that 'people' are reading this article and other
papers of mine. Usually, I don't know these 'people', which could even be a
certain CuneiformComposite (the name of a font), but some are known to me
and appear in my emails.I also receive notifications that my name has been
quoted in such or such article (some having nothing to do with my work, as
very specialized medical articles by instance), but it is impossible to
know more, without paying. This seems to be a very erratic process,
probably led by a silly robot.

Hi,

If it is the case that Academia app was installed, one can notice that it
collects name and email address (see [1]), which is sure enough to
correlate with information from Indology archives, which are public.

Maybe deleting the Academia account will help.

I find there?s a lot of leakage between one?s mobile phone calls, emails,
social media accounts and services like Academia / Research Gate / Dropbox
/ Interfolio. It?s only a matter of time before our thoughts too become
accessible, predictable and monetizable. In the event that as academics we
can?t go off the grid entirely, perhaps it?s better to resign oneself to
this invasion of the mind snatchers?

Before you delete your account, perhaps first learn how to use this 
application. In the settings, you can control which email notifications 
you want to receive. If none, turn off all notifications (as Dominik wrote).

I do log in to Academia.edu with my google login But Google says this only
gives them access to my name, email address and profile picture.

At the very least, we should not speak our thoughts aloud, or keep our private diaries on our devices. ?

This email originated outside Colorado College. Do not click links or attachments unless you know the content is safe.

I find there?s a lot of leakage between one?s mobile phone calls, emails, social media accounts and services like Academia / Research Gate / Dropbox / Interfolio. It?s only a matter of time before our thoughts too become accessible, predictable and monetizable. In the event that as academics we can?t go off the grid entirely, perhaps it?s better to resign oneself to this invasion of the mind snatchers?

That's quite suspicious.  Perhaps Kaul had a burst of online business and posted to INDOLOGY and at the same time uploaded the review to Academia, which triggered your notification.  We can't tell from Academia when papers are uploaded, but the review has 317 views, which suggests it was uploaded a while ago, not recently.  So that explanation is probably wrong.

How could Academia possibly be getting information about your incoming emails?  What mechanism can we imagine?  Emails don't deposit cookies, so cross-site cookies aren't the pathway.  If Academia is harvesting from the INDOLOGY archive, which is technically possible, then *everyone* would get the Kaul notification or similar ones, not just you.  It's hard to see how this might work.  Without a plausible mechanism, I'm staying with coincidence.

But I have all my Academia notifications turned off, so I never get anything from them.  If I want to know their stuff, I look at the website.

I have set my academia account to never email me and have even asked gmail

Yes, you can indeed sometimes get an email even though you have all 
notifications turned off. In my experience, this happens in two cases.

First, when Academia.edu adds a new kind of notification, it always sets 
it as "on" (otherwise we would not know about it). In that case, we need 
to go into the settings again and turn off this new notification.

Second, Academia.edu occasionally asks selected users for feedback on 
new planned changes (new features, new look, etc.). I usually give this 
feedback because I have been using this site for many years (for free) 
and I consider it fair to contribute to its development.

Can Lubomir or anyone else tell us how to turn off notifications? I could not find any obvious way to do it. Thanks.

Once an app is on your phone, then it's certainly easier for the app to
collect data across other functions on your phone.  But Claudius, the link
you cited helpfully to the permissions that the Academia phone app has only
includes collecting only the user's name and email address, which one would
expect. I don't see anything more general than that, or anything that would
explain what Harry is experiencing.  (Harry, do you have the phone app?)

Best,
Dominik

This can only happen if you explicitly allow an app to get data from
Google.  And you can do a "security check"
<https://myaccount.google.com/security> with your Google account where you
see each external application and what data you have given it permission to
see ("apps with access to your account
<https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Fsecurity>").
The first time you log in to something like Academia with your Google
account you are asked how much you want to share.  Normally, it's just your
name and email account, which is what you want to share anyway.

I tend to agree with you, Ajit.  But what is the basis for your strong
assertion that what Harry sees is just coincidence?  Do you have inside
knowledge about how Academia.edu works?

Message-ID: <CAPAZekbx+yy74S9DBocNi5_wd=Vip5YgRySjf2+LtP9Np=MC=g@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if there is a critical edition of the *S?rya-siddh?nta*. I
could not find one. However, there is something very close to one, although
it is not called a critical edition. It is Kripa Shankar Shukla's edition, *The
S?rya-siddh?nta with the Commentary of Paramesvara*. Lucknow University:
Department of Mathematics and Astronomy, 1957. For the text of the
*S?rya-siddh?nta*, he gives full variant readings from manuscripts of the
text as commented on by Mallik?rjuna S?ri (1178 CE), Yallaya (1472 CE), and
R?mak???a ?r?dhya (1472 CE), besides from the printed edition of
Ra?gan?tha's commentary edited by J?v?nanda Vidy?s?gara. He says that he
also consulted the commentaries by Bh?dhara (1572 CE) and Tamma Yajv? (1599
CE) for deciding between certain readings. Of course, the text is based on
the commentary by Parame?vara (1432 CE), which predates the commonly used
commentary by Ra?gan?tha (1603 CE) by nearly two centuries. When he has
chosen a reading different from Parame?vara's, he cites Parame?vara's
reading as m?. pustake, for m?la-pustake.



I did not find a digital copy of Shukla's edition online, but I have
scanned the photocopy I made of it. Happy to send it to anyone who wants
it. Perhaps someone who knows how can upload it to the web.


Best regards,

Dear everyone,
As a change from talking about Academia.edu does anyone have a pdf or can
point me to a link to  gorak?a?ataka printed by Oxford University Press ,
1928.  The title may be slightly different.  Its only the version printed
by OUP in 1928 I need. I suspect its on the internet or archive.org
somewhere but I haven't been able to find it.

Thanks,

An edition of the *Sumatitantram*, an astronomical work, was published in
1978. It does not appear to be available for sale anywhere, nor could I
find a digital copy on the web. If anyone has a digital copy of it, I would
greatly appreciate receiving it. If no one has one, I will try to
interlibrary loan it, and scan it. The listing on WorldCat is:

https://www.worldcat.org/title/13046103?oclcNum=13046103

The editors are: Nayara?ja Panta

, Dines?ara?ja Panta
<https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Panta%2C%20Dines%CC%81ara%CC%84ja%22>

The publisher is: Tribhuvanavis?vavidya?laya?ntargatam?
Pa?t?hyakramavika?sakendram, Ka?s?t?haman?dape, Nepa?le, 1978.

There is supposed to be a digital copy at Hathi Trust, but it is not

Dear Indologists,

The Atlantic articles shared by Richard Mahoney is behind a pay wall, but I would be grateful if someone could share the text (speaking of sharing digital copies haha). 

More is available here:

https://www.npr.org/2023/03/26/1166101459/internet-archive-lawsuit-books-library-publishers

As the NPR article states, the judge in this case specifies that the ruling **does not** apply to works that are in the public domain. Please, someone correct me if I?m wrong, but it seems as though we mostly share public domain IA works here on Indology (though, certainly ?most? is an arbitrary concept and I admit I?ve done any quantitative analysis). Am I incorrect in this assumption?

In my own research, the only work I?ve ever used on IA that is under copyright and requires that I use the ?check out? function described in the court case is the Pedurma edition of the Tibetan Kangyur/Tengyur. 

But again, I understand that just because I rarely use a certain IA feature does not mean other Indologists don?t use it. So to that point, how often are you all ?checking out? copyrighted works on IA? 

Sincerely,

Dear Harry,

it would be a great surprise to all yoga scholars to find that OUP ever 
published an edition of the Gorak?a?ataka. But I am afraid that no such 
edition exists. Where did you get this reference from?

The only relationship between G? and Oxford that I know of is a few 
manuscripts of G? in the Bodleian Library.

Thank you very much, Lubomir, for uploading this edition, and David, for
pointing to the book, which I will certainly use for my course on History
of Indian mathematics (and astronomy).
Also for this course, I am nowadays struggling with a part of the
Lalitavistara, where the Buddha is showing his ability in numbers. His
enumeration of powers of 10, from the *ko?i *to the *tallak?a?a*, is very
clear. But things become obscure when he continues his enumeration with
other (supposed) powers of 10. The problem is that he says that the next
one, the *dhvaj?gravat?*, is able to count all the sand of the Ga?g?, while
the sixth one, the *sarvanik?epa*, is able to count all the sand of ten
Ga?g?. How is it possible if every unit equals the previous one multiplied
by ten (and what else could it be) ? Apart from noting that this kind of
enumeration and its use for counting the sand reminds very much
Archimede's Sandreckoner, I must add that there are discrepancies between
the two translations I know (de Foucaux 1988 (1884) and Goswami 2001) and
also with the 'sanskrit' text of ??ntibhik?u ??str? 1984. After this
enumeration, comes a scale which rely the last unit, the
*param??uraja?prave??nugata*, to the yojana, by multiplying it by 7 ten
times, and then again by 12, 2, 4, 1000 and 4, so that a yojana equals 710
.12.2.4.1000.4 *param??uraja?prave??nugatas*. And, of course, the Buddha
asks if somebody can tell how many *param??uraja?prave??nugatas* would
contain a bowl of 1 yojana. Here again, the answer seems awkward for it
amounts to 1028 while it should be more than 1041. Does anyone have an
explanation for these mistakes, or know of a paper or a book which
discusses these problems ?

Best regards,

Jean Michel

Message-ID: <CACDreE9TtGinnre=_cOB6aEhrJaCEr3fH_XkJfuh=QXPfU9Q_g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members of the list,
It is with profound sadness that we, his former Sanskrit colleagues at the
University of Edinburgh, have to share the news of the passing of Paul
Dundas on Wednesday 5 April at the age of 70.
Paul started studying Sanskrit and Prakrit as an undergraduate at the
University of Edinburgh with Michael Coulson and had a short period as a
postgraduate at the University of Cambridge with among others, John Brough
and K.R. Norman, before accepting the post in Sanskrit at Edinburgh in
1976, where he continued to teach and research throughout his entire career
until his retirement as reader only a few years ago. He was a member of the
Council of the Pali Text Society, and the recipient of the Prakrit
J??nabh?rat? International award in 2019. Paul was a towering figure in the
field of Jain and Prakrit studies and will be known to most scholars and
students as the author of *The Jains*, of which the first edition appeared
in 1992 and which continues to be the most reliable introduction to Jainism
to the present day. From his many other publications in the field we would
like to single out *History, Scripture and Controversy in a Medieval Jain
Sect*, published in 2007, a book of vast and penetrating learning with a
relevance far beyond that of medieval Jainism alone. But Paul also had a
great passion for all things Sanskrit, reading across the entire spectrum
of Sanskrit literature. Testimony to this is his wonderful translation of
M?gha's *?i?up?lavadha*, published in the Murty Classical Library of India
in 2017, the first complete English translation of this truly difficult
Sanskrit Mah?k?vya. His latest publication appeared in 2022, in the Eivind
Kahrs felicitation volume *J??napra?a?s?*: ?Sectarian Confrontation as
Theatrical Diversion: Observations on Ya?a?candra?s
*Mudritakumudacandraprakara?a* and the Jain Debate at A?ahillapa??ana?.
Paul was still actively engaged in several other projects. His death is a
great loss to the field.
Paul was one of the most learned and well read persons we have known. He
was also most generous and kind, and we will sorely miss his presence and
humour.
Our thoughts are with his partner, Rowan Flett.

Dear Colleague

I cannot pretend to the slightest knowledge of mathematics (Indian or
otherwise), but concerning the *Lalitavistara* and its Sanskrit text, I
might dare refer you to

What utterly sad news!
His passing away is a shock for both my wife, Luitgard, and me, who
have had the privilege of knowing him since the early 1990s when we
first met in Ahmedabad. At that time he was completing his The Jains.
We have continuously been in touch with him. We have been profiting
greatly from his vast knowledge and we'll always remember his
friendliness and his delightful humour.
Fare thee well Paul, our friend.
Jay and Luitgard

I am so sorry to hear this very sad news. Paul was a great scholar, and we have all benefited by his scholarship on Jainism. He was my ?go to guy? whenever I had a question about early Jainism. Paul was also a good friend. He visited Austin many years ago, we had him at home. The last time I met him was in 2017 when I and my wife were in Edinburgh and had dinner with him. Rest in peace, Paul.

Thank you very much, Jonathan,

I didn't find anything in this article about the numerations, but it leads
to Burnouf's Lotus de la bonne loi, where I found that the great French
indologist dared to assign values to the units listed after the *tallak?a?a*.
Unhappily, this doesn't solve the other problems yet. The article also
points to Hokazono Koichi's modern edition of the Lalitavistara, which
could be very useful. I tried to find his volume I (containing chapter XII)
on Internet, but couldn't (at least on Google). Do you know how to find it
online ?

Best regards,

Jean Michel

A brilliant mind and a kindly and witty soul. Paul was very supportive of my work as I began to embark upon my studies of Jainism. I am deeply sorry to learn of his passing and will treasure my memories of our conversations and correspondence.

In shared sorrow,

Dear Jean Michel,

If no one already has a digital copy of Hokazono's edition of the
Lalitavistara, vol. 1, I can scan my photocopy of it later today.

Best regards,

Another sad departure! Paul was a great scholar, a great person and a good
friend. His death is a painful loss to us all.

I am among the many who had encounters with Paul over the years in which we
were not just impressed by the breadth of his interests and expertise, but
also by how thoroughly decent he was as a human being. I will forget
neither our conversations on a variety of Indological topics nor those
on Scottish politics or football, all matters about which he was equally
knowledgeable and passionate. His support of younger scholars was something
we younger scholars not only profited from but could also take as a model
for how we ourselves should act towards the next generation.

Many thanks to Peter and John for this post, and to everyone sharing their
memories of this most collegial of colleagues. May his ?r?va? be ?k?itam.

?Antonia

Dr Rajpopat asked me to share his response to the review of his thesis by
Sri Neelesh Bodas that I shared on this forum in the message below in this
thread.

Sharing the pdf file.

Thank you for letting me know.

Norman, before accepting the post in Sanskrit at Edinburgh in 1976, where he continued to teach and research throughout his entire career until his retirement as reader only a few years ago. He was a member of the Council of the Pali Text Society, and the recipient of the Prakrit J??nabh?rat? International award in 2019. Paul was a towering figure in the field of Jain and Prakrit studies and will be known to most scholars and students as the author of The Jains, of which the first edition appeared in 1992 and which continues to be the most reliable introduction to Jainism to the present day. From his many other publications in the field we would like to single out History, Scripture and Controversy in a Medieval Jain Sect, published in 2007, a book of vast and penetrating learning with a relevance far beyond that of medieval Jainism alone. But Paul also had a great passion for all things Sanskrit, reading across the entire spectrum of Sanskrit literature. Testimony to this is his wonderful translation of M?gha's ?i?up?lavadha, published in the Murty Classical Library of India in 2017, the first complete English translation of this truly difficult Sanskrit Mah?k?vya. His latest publication appeared in 2022, in the Eivind Kahrs felicitation volume J??napra?a?s?: ?Sectarian Confrontation as Theatrical Diversion: Observations on Ya?a?candra?s Mudritakumudacandraprakara?a and the Jain Debate at A?ahillapa??ana?. Paul was still actively engaged in several other projects. His death is a great loss to the field.
>> Paul was one of the most learned and well read persons we have known. He was also most generous and kind, and we will sorely miss his presence and humour.
>> Our thoughts are with his partner, Rowan Flett.

Policies

Deadlines:

Abstract and paper submission deadlines are strict. In no circumstances
will extensions be given.

Changes of title/abstract/authorship:

Authors should include a full title for their paper, as well as a complete
abstract by the abstract submission deadline. Submission titles should not
be modified after the abstract submission deadline, and abstracts should
not be modified by more than 50% after the abstract submission deadline.
Submissions violating these rules may be deleted after the paper submission
deadline without reviewing. The author list at the abstract submission
deadline will be considered final, and no changes in authorship will be
permitted for accepted papers.

Double-Blind Review:

All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with
the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing
policy, including (but not limited to) citing previous works of the authors
or sharing links in a way that can infer any author?s identity or
institution, actions that reveal the identities of the authors to potential
reviewers.

Dual Submission:

It is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially
similar) to versions that have been previously published, accepted for
publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals.
Such submissions violate our dual submission policy, and the organizers
have the right to reject such submissions, or to remove them from the
proceedings.

Reviewing Criteria:

Accepted papers must be based on original research and must contain
significant novel results of significant interest to the machine learning
community. Results can be either theoretical or empirical. Results will be
judged on the degree to which they have been objectively established and/or
their potential for scientific and technological impact. Reproducibility of
results and easy availability of code will be taken into account in the
decision-making process whenever appropriate.

Ethics:

Authors and members of the program committee, including reviewers, are
expected to follow standard ethical guidelines. Plagiarism in any form is
strictly forbidden as is unethical use of privileged information by
reviewers, such as sharing it or using it for any other purpose than the
reviewing process. All suspected unethical behaviors will be investigated
by an ethics board and individuals found violating the rules may face
sanctions. Details of the guideline will be published on the website.

Message-ID: <72634784-6047-417A-BE8F-C85442441D81@cantabgold.net>

Paul Dundas had the generosity to take me through my first two years of Sanskrit. I was always impressed by what a thorough reader he was and by his humor to make enjoyable even the most hair-splitting discussions about grammar. At the end of each semester, he used to take the whole class for a pint. It was a very exciting occasion for us, students, to sit and partake with him. In my memory he will always remain as a towering teaching figure. The time spent reading the Subh??itaratnako?a with him is still, after so many years, a source of motivation for me. I?m greatly indebted to him.

I would also like to add, to what others have said about Paul, that he was
extremely modest and self-effacing. As Peter and others have noted, the
breadth of his knowledge was astonishing and rare, much more so even than
his published work might indicate, but he was always, in the time I knew
him, reassuringly sane and down to earth, as well as generous in his
appraisal of others.

Dear David,

Thank you for sending me the two pdf about the Lalitavistara. I have
checked Hokazono Koichi's edition, which corresponds to Woepcke's
interpretation in Journal Asiatique, March-April 1863, p.262, and differs
from Foucaux's. Actually, Woepcke allegedly asked Foucaux to check in "the
Tibetan version", and Foucaux acknowledged Woepcke's interpretation, but
apparently didn't incorporate it in his translation. Woepcke's 'correction'
of the wrong number given by the LV, which should correspond to 710
.12.2.4.1000.4, is rather convincing : he argues that some interpolations
have been made in order to increase that number (and the prestige of the
Buddha), and shows how to reduce it by deleting three factors 7, some zeros
and interverting two figures. Compared to Hokazono Koichi's edition, one
notes that Woepcke also proposes to change a 22 into a 24. Hokazono
Koichi's edition has 32, but points to 22 as a variant. So, I think we can
accept Woepcke's interpretation.
The other problem, i.e. how to reconcile a multiplication by ten (sand of
one Ganga to ten Ganga) with a scale of five or six successive (supposed)
powers of ten enumerated as units in the LV, and just after that to
reconcile a multiplication by 100 millions (sand of ten Ganga to a hundred
kotis of Ganga) with a scale of only two powers of ten is not yet solved,
because the different editions have the same units and disposition. But it
is probably, as in Woepcke's interpretation above, the result of other
interpolations.

Thank you again, and best regards,

Jean Michel

Hello Friends,

     If I have a list of the first p?das of verses in Unicode Devanagari,
is there a software program that can automatically make an

there is a relatively painless way to do this.

Dear Harry,

Here is another example, taken from the former Bh?sa project (T?bingen & W?rzburg) ? probably not the latest programming, but it has worked for years:
https://www.bhasa.indologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/rahmen.html <https://www.bhasa.indologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/rahmen.html>
[For more information refer to my article from 2012: ?From Palmleaves to a Multimedia Databank ? A Note on the ?Bh?sa-Project??. In: Aspects of Manuscript Culture in South India. Ed. by Saraju Rath. Leiden: Brill 2012 (Brill?s Indological Library, 40), p. 139-155 and Plates VI-IX.]

Click on ?C?rudatta?; there on the blue numbers in square brackets ? this links the text passage to the respective palm leaf manuscript(s): leaf number, recto/verso, line.
Each work is linked to an overall word-index of the plays entered in the database.

More information on programming: Matthias Ahlborn (Matthias.Ahlborn at epost.de).

Thank you to Westin Harris and Hartmut Buescher who offlist both pointed me
to Harunaga Isaacson and

 Francesco Sferra's edition of the Sekanirde?a of Maitreyan?tha. To Peter
Pasedach who also offlist pointed

me to Michael Hahn's edition of the Kapphi??bhyudaya. Matthew Kapstein who
provided a archive.org link

 to Nilratan Sen's facsimile edition of a cary?gitiko?a manuscript (which
had the manuscript page

 photograph and transcription on the same page). And to Heike Oberlin who
pointed to the on-line

 transcription of the Bhasa projects c?rudatta based on multiple
manuscripts (very very impressive!!)

Why I asked the question.  Dominik Wujastyk had suggested as best
practice for transcribing a manuscript.
In transcribing a manuscript it is best practice to transcribe
diplomatically exactly what the MS says.
A second, separate file may be prepared that contains various
normalisations, like ba/va or ?a/sa, rma/rmma, etc.
But Phillip Maas pointed out:
Determining ?exactly what the MS says? may sometimes be a less
straightforward task than it may seem. Frequently, transcribing requires
interpreting

So it seemed to me (at least for on-line transcriptions ) that the best
solution was to simply include a copy of the manuscript and a normalized
(or non-normalized) transcription of it.  My understanding is that
photographs of 2 dimensional objects can't be copyrighted, so the only
thing preventing this would be contractual obligations (such as with NGMCP
manuscripts).  Presumably any qualified person using the manuscript for an
edition would know the script the manuscript was written in (devanagari,
grantha, ??rad? etc.) so he/she could accept or reject any normalizations
etc.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear Harry,



Sorry to come to this discussion late. A recent example of what you are
looking for ? although not from the world of Sanskrit ? is the edition of
BnF Ms. Fr. 640 that the folks at the Making Knowing Project at Columbia
University have produced. (The edition seems to accommodate both of Dominik
Wujastyk?s suggestions and Phillip Maas?s observation that you have
mentioned.)



The online edition (accessible here
<https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios>) provides
high-resolution images of the original manuscript side-by-side with a
transcription. When it comes to the transcription, readers have the option
of choosing either (1) a diplomatic French edition, (2) a normalized French
edition, or (3) a translated English version. The transcriptions replicate
the complex *mise-en-page* of the original manuscript, and ? if you ask me
? it is a fairly elegant way of editing and translating this text and
making it available to new publics.



Take care,

Eric

Dear Rishi, 

Thank you for your reply to my previous query and to Peter?s review. I think it is good for the advancement of our knowledge that we keep the discussion going in an academic manner.

Let me take this opportunity to ask one more simple question. 

How do you explain the fact/significance of A 1.4.2 having being placed exactly after A 1.4.1, with which begins ?the one name section? (ekasa?j??dhik?ra). It seems to me that this very positioning of A 1.4.2 amply indicates its intended function and the domain in which the rule is to operate. If A 1.4.2 is a metarule that can work, if necessary, at any given stage of a derivation, we would naturally expect such a rule to have been placed, together with other such metarules, in the first quarter of the first chapter of the A???dhy?y?. I think this point has already been made by some other scholars on this list. I would like to know what you think. Or do you touch on this matter somewhere in your thesis?

Y?to

Dear colleagues,
 
after a successful 2022 edition, I am happy to inform you that the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia (Austrian Academy of Sciences) and the Department of South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies (University of Vienna) are organising the second Vienna Summer School on the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia. 
 
The Summer School will take place in Vienna, Austria, between 3 July 2023 and 8 July 2023. The title of the 2023 event is "Classical Sanskrit Texts on Epistemology". 
 
Please circulate this call widely. The event particularly suits students (undergraduates and graduates) willing to have first-hand contact with South Asian epistemological theories and who have an intermediate to good knowledge of ??stric Sanskrit. 
 
For those interested, the Summer School can also offer ECTS credits.
 
For any further information, please visit:

Dear Colleagues,
	After carefully reading Rishi Rajpopat?s reply to my review of his dissertation, I have nothing to add nor detract from my review.  The points raised stand as stated.  I hope the scholarly community will read it carefully and benefit from it.  The proposal made by Dr. Rajpopat has recieved far more attention than it deserves already.
	Yours,

H. Nakatani, Ud?navarga de Suba?i, an edition of a fragmentary manuscript in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, is in two volumes, the first being a romanised version of the surviving text with parallels of the verses from comparable texts, and the second a set of photographs of the fragments together with diagrams showing how they would all have fitted together. (An extreme example, of dealing with an extremely damaged text.)

Thank you Valerie,
>From the examples shared on-line and a few offline, it seems that having
photographs of the original manuscript along side a diplomatic
transcription or an edited version is not as uncommon as I had thought.
Thus addressing the problems pointed out by Dominik Wujastyk and Philip
Maas.

regular guest professor at the Chair of Indology, University of  
W?rzburg, teaching modern and classical Kannada, as well as courses on  
the culture and literature of Karnataka.

No fees will be charged. Interested persons are requested to enclose a  
short letter of motivation (max. half page) until April 23th 2023. For

Message-ID: <CALPiqisFHYEA8SK5_TgOg=_Ai8018J6eWunO46FGLcrzdoSJSg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

A student of mine asks whether there exists a user-friendly reader with
literal (interlinear) word-to-word
translations, which engages the texts of the early Upani?ads in the way the
new P?li reader of Bhikkhu Bodhi
(2020) engages the P?li texts.

I was able to suggest only the ISKCON version of the *??opani?ad* and *An
Early Upani?adic Reader* (2007) by
Hans Heinrich Hock (the latter publication is very close to what my student
expects, but it places the glossary (or
vocabulary) at the end of the book, making it harder for a beginner to use,
and the translations are not literal).

Are there other similar readers?

-- 

With kind regards (mett?ya),

Gleb Sharygin, Dr. des.

Hello Gleb,

To add to the already-mentioned resources, depending on your student's
level of proficiency, Patrick Olivelle's 1998 *The Early Upani?ads*,
published with Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, gives the Sanskrit text
with page-facing English translations. It is quite navigable.

Take care,
Eric

Actually it was published by Oxford University Press. Munshiram is a plagiarized version.

Mea culpa! I must have picked it up last time I was in Delhi, and it's been
sitting innocently on my bookshelf ever since.

Well, it is complicated. They ordered 150 or so copies from OUP, and then changed the title pages!! An old fashioned cut and paste job.

Hello Gleb,

To add to the already-mentioned resources, depending on your student's level of proficiency, Patrick Olivelle's 1998 The Early Upani?ads, published with Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, gives the Sanskrit text with page-facing English translations. It is quite navigable.

Dear colleagues,

A student of mine asks whether there exists a user-friendly reader with literal (interlinear) word-to-word
translations, which engages the texts of the early Upani?ads in the way the new P?li reader of Bhikkhu Bodhi
(2020) engages the P?li texts.

I was able to suggest only the ISKCON version of the ??opani?ad and An Early Upani?adic Reader (2007) by
Hans Heinrich Hock (the latter publication is very close to what my student expects, but it places the glossary (or
vocabulary) at the end of the book, making it harder for a beginner to use, and the translations are not literal).

Are there other similar readers?

This may not be directly relevant, but when I published a book from
University of Hawaii they immediately--without asking me--sold the rights
to Motilal, who of course changed the title (so, I think, they can sell it
to libraries who are not paying attention). But they reprinted the rest of
the book as is, and as far as it went, it was legal (though the result was
meant to be sold only in South Asia, but well, we all know how that goes)

I thought copyright belongs to the author, since the copyright exires 75
years after the authors death.

Message-ID: <CALM2Y+oKuqofNv2e1fgEuB_1r_O=J_vaSn8f9Qk3FBTN-JJ5QQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I had a quick question, in Sarvarkar's book, he states "the line
'Shivashiva na Hindurna Yavanah' is too well known to be quoted" I had
received a question on its provenance and was unable to find it. Does
anyone know where this quote might come from?

Thanks,

Luther

I think copyright has been extensively discussed here on the list before .
The highlights and interpretation on Indian copyright act are:

The general rule is that copyright lasts for 60 years. In the case of
original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works the 60-year period
is counted from the year following the death of the author. In the case of
cinematograph films, sound recordings, photographs, posthumous
publications, anonymous and pseudonymous publications, works of government
and works of international organisations, the 60-year period is counted
from the date of publication.

What are the moral rights of an author?

The author of a work has the right to claim authorship of the work and to
restrain or claim damages in respect of any distortion, mutilation,
modification or other acts in relation to the said work which is done
before the expiration of the term of copyright if such distortion,
mutilation, modification or other act would be prejudicial to his honour or
reputation. Moral rights are available to the authors even after the
economic rights are assigned.

Do the author?s moral rights remain after assignment of copyright?

Yes. The moral rights are independent of the author?s copyright and remain
even after assignment of the copyright.

Will failure to display a work infringe the moral rights of an author?

No. Failure to display a work or to display it to the satisfaction of the
author shall not be deemed to be an infringement of the moral rights of the
author.

Who is the owner of a work produced during the course of the author?s
employment?

In the case of a work made in the course of the author?s employment under a
contract of service or apprenticeship, the employer shall, in the absence
of any agreement to the contrary, be the first owner of the copyright ther
in.
Is it not true that strict application of the principle of protection of
copyright hampers economic and cultural development of the society?

Yes. If copyright protection is applied rigidly, it can hamper the progress
of society. However, copyright laws are enacted with necessary exceptions
and limitations to ensure that a balance is maintained between the
interests of the creators and of the community.

Dear Friends,

     Thanks to Amba Kulkarni, I now have the alphabetical index of my 2000
Krishna verses. Hopefully this collection, with English and Marathi
renderings, will be published in a book form in the future. I also wish to
thank all those who offered to help me in making this index. With best
wishes,

This is very sad news indeed. Dipak Bhattacharya and his father Durgamohan
Bhattacharya were pioneers in the discovery and editing of the Paippal?da
Atharvaveda from Orissa. I met him several times at conferences, and he was
very generous in answering my questions regarding the
Atharvavedic tradition during my own editing of the ?aunak?ya
Catur?dhy?yik? and the Vikr?tis of the ?aunak?ya Atharvaveda. He also made
important contributions to P??inian studies. His passing is a major loss to
Vedic studies. ? ??????: ??????: ??????: ?

Happy Akshayyatrtiya.
Some verses on sunya and Mahasunya are quoted by Madhvacharya in
tattvoddyota and anuvyakhyana. I am not able to trace them. I will be
grateful for leads.
Mahasunya concept may be available in Tibetan Buddhist texts?

My sincere condolences to Dipak Bhattacharya's family and friends. We only
had email contact but he was very nice to a young scholar such as myself.
My line of research simply wouldn't exist without his father's and his
efforts. Incredible that he managed to publish the edition of the entire
enormous Paippal?dasa?hit? in his lifetime!

Dear Listmember,
this year I found in the library of the Nationalmuseum Colombo three 
unpublished Sanskrit manuscripts describing the iconographical details 
of Indian gods. They are written in ?lokas for learning by heart. "A 
handbook for temple artists" (Coomarasvamy).
I give an example for the description of the god Brahma:

Caturmukha? caturb?hum p?tavar??a sam?yutam
Jat?maku?asa?yukta? ratnaku??alabh?i??am (?)
Hemayaj?opav?ta?ca abhaya? pustaka? tath?
Svar??aha?sasasam?r??ha? Brahma n?thasya lak?a?a?

The manuscripts are called R?pavaliya and R?pam?l?. Apart of 
Gooneratne's English translation which follows another wording or 
unknown manuscript I could not find out any further manuscripts or an 
edition of the text.
Are there any other manuscripts available which I may consult?
I am aware of a few articles in which some extracts are published 
(Paranavitana, Coomarasvamy etc.). The text probably dates from the 11th 
century (Gooneratne).

Thank you
Heiner

My heartfelt condolences to the family of a great scholar Dipak Bhattacharya.  I had the privilege of meeting him when he came to Leiden.  I was working in the library of the Kern Institute and also studying Sanskrit with Professor Witzel.  I was fortunate to be able to attend the first sessions of the Paippalaada  readings.  Because of some bureaucratic mistake his wife did not get a visum to accompany him.  He was quite lonely at the time and because I was also connected to the Indian diaspora in the Netherlands as a board member of the Netherlands-India Association I tried to make his stay in Leiden more pleasant.  We remained friends and I visited him in Santiniketan.  His fantastic efforts to publish the texts was his homage to his father.  He was really more interested in Panini.

He has passed away but in Leiden we still use his books and all who are working on the PS will continue to pay homage to him.

Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya

Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya, a renowned scholar of Sanskrit and Vedic Studies, passed away yesterday (April 21, 2023), at his daughter?s residence in Mumbai, due to prolonged illness and old age. He was eighty-two. He is survived by two daughters, son-in-laws and a granddaughter.

Prof. Bhattacharya worked at the Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan and devoted his life to teaching and research in the field of Sanskrit and Vedic Studies. He was known for his research in Vedic Studies, particularly, the first critical edition of the Paippal?da Sa?hit? of the Atharvaveda. He continued the work left incomplete by his father, Prof. Durgamohan Bhattacharya, who is credited with discovering the tradition of the Atharvaveda in Odisha. He collected several manuscripts of that Veda written in Oriya script, worked meticulously throughout his life and brought out a good critical edition of the entire Sa?hit?, consisting of twenty K???as. The edition was published in four volumes by the Asiatic Society, Kolkata (1997-2016). This work evinces the mastery of Vedic and classical Sanskrit language, proficiency in textual criticism, colossal industry and insight on the part of that scholar. Despite the difference of opinion, the community of Vedic scholars will always remain indebted to Prof. Bhattacharya for his monumental work. Eminent Vedic philologists such as Prof. Michael Witzel (retired Professor of Sanskrit, Harvard University) and Prof. Georges Pinault (Paris) have expressed their feelings similarly.

I had good personal relations with Prof. Bhattacharya. He participated in a national seminar on Vedic ??kh?s I had organized in 2001 at the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth (TMV) in honour of Prof. C. G. Kashikar. He also participated in the Fifth International Vedic Workshop held in Bucharest in 2011. He worked as an external examiner and attended the Viva Voce examination of Dr. Shilpa Sumant for her Ph. D. from TMV. He always treated me like his younger brother. His sad demise is an unrepairable loss for the field of Vedic Studies and a personal loss for me.  

My deep condolences to his family, students, friends and colleagues.

Message-ID: <a8a39c29-addb-4625-a4fb-1d731ac0f5ca@lrz.uni-muenchen.de>

Dear list friends,

A non-Indological colleague asked me whether there are any references in
ancient Indian literature to the medicinal use of sesame oil.

Related: is there any Indian word in any language for 'sesame' that
resembles 'shumshum', 'simsim' or 'shamashammu'?

Any information concerning these two questions would be most welcome.

Yes, sesame oil was widely used. A good introductory entry is in the 
classic Dymock survey:
https://archive.org/details/b2129737x_0003/page/n41/mode/2up

Specific textual references in Ayurvedic works can be found through the 
index of Meulenbeld's A History of Indian Medical Literature under the 
entry "tila".

I think for all Sanskritists , the etymology of the word tailam from tila =
is not unknown.

So sesame oil seems to be so fundamental as an oil that the word tailam
came to refer to all oils.

In Ayurveda, ????s?????? ??????????? is the tradition.

This expression is from Saarangadhara Samhitaa Prathama kaanda first
section first chapter.

Both Charaka and Vagbhata mention tailam and commentators explain that

???? ?????? ????? ???????? ??????????? ( ??????? ?????? ???? )

??? ?????? ?????????? 13 ?????? explains ????????? and mentions sesame oil.

As for the term, Kirtikar and Basu (Indian Medicinal Plants, 2nd rev. 
ed., 1935, vol. III, pp. 1860-61) give a detailed list of words for 
sesame in many Indian languages, but in no language is the term derived 
from the Semitic form.

The only exception is Bengali, where the authors give the word "Sumsum". 
Surprisingly, Bengali dictionaries do not list this word. On the other 
hand, one of the authors was a Bengali, so perhaps he did know the usage 
of this word in Bengali. My guess is that the term may have been used in 
Musulmani Bengali as a direct borrowing from Arabic. But that is uncertain.

The Bengali-speaking members of our list can hopefully add more information.

Dear Robert,

     The generic Sanskrit word for oil [*taila*] is derived from *tila
*"sesame."
I wonder if that indicates the same as the primary source of edible oil.
Best,

Madhav

This might not be very helpful, but I have a very vague recollection that
one of P.K. Gode's articles collected in Studies in Indian Cultural History
was devoted, at least in part, to the use of sesame (seeds or oil) in
India. Unfortunately I can neither find it at the moment nor remember if
the content was relevant to these two questions.

With best wishes,

Dear Prof. Zydenbos,

I recall that sesame in Hebrew is soomsoom, which resembles the terms you cited, though I do not know the origin - I assume that it must have been a loanword.

Dear Professor Kapstein,

?Shamashammu? (?ama??amu) is the Akkadian word for ?sesame.? That could be the origin of Hebrew ?soomsoom.?

Dear list,

I think Gaia might be thinking of K T Achaya?s Oilseeds and Oilmilling,
which has historical sections. Achaya?s other books will also contain
history of the seed in S Asia.

https://archive.org/details/oilseeds-and-oilmilling-in-india-a-cultural-and-historical-survey/page/n8/mode/1up


Black sesame also has a significant role in Hindu death rites.

Yours,

It is a little more complicated. The word comes from the (reconstructed) 
Hamito-Semitic form *cim- meaning "grass, plant".

In most Semitic languages its reduplicated form (*cim-cim) means sesame. 
So we have Arabic simsim or Hebrew shumshum (??????).

In Coptic, Ahmaric, Chadic and other non-Semitic languages, it remains 
unreduplicated.

Thanks for trying to prod my memory, but I am afraid I was really thinking
of one of P.K. Gode's articles. For instance, some of the articles in vol.
1 of Studies in Indian Cultural History (see the ToC here
https://archive.org/details/studiesinindianculturalhistorygodep.k.part1_544_D/page/n11/mode/2up?view=theater)
deal with certain plants of the Subcontinent (only not with sesame).
It might all well be a major misrecollection of mine, but if the article
does exist, I am sure it is a Gode article.

I have checked carefully the tables of contents of P. K. Gode?s Studies in Indian Cultural History, vols. I and III,?and find no articles on sesame or its oil. Unfortunately, my copy of vol. ? II?has either been badly misshelved or lost in a basement flood.

I would like to challenge my friend Matthew to show that Hebrew shumshum is
related to Tibetan zhum zhum, which at least as I recall means to move
furtively, like a cat.

Dear all,

Here's Gode's Vol. II of Cultural History, covering other aspects of
material cultural history. I would not be surprised if Gode wrote on sesame
elsewhere (through BORI?), as he was such a remarkably prolific scholar.
Please do share if the reference is found.

Dear all,

 

Unicode keeps receiving proposals for encoding scripts from both past and present India and I thought it might be valuable to reach out and encourage feedback from the Indology community.

 

One of the proposed scripts for encoding is for Pabuchi, a script used for writing Sirmauri and Mahasui languages used by astrologers in Himachal Pradesh. Is anybody familiar or have any contacts with this community? I would like to independently verify some of the claims made in the proposal, especially since the knowledge of the script has traditionally been considered sacred and not for sharing.

 

Another proposal we would be looking for feedback on is Ranjana (unified with Lantsa) for writing Sanskrit, Newar and other local languages. The proposal is available at https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23028-ranjana.pdf.

 

Feel free to respond in the group or reach out to me offline if you had any comments or suggestions.

 

Thank you and best regards,

Jan

Dear Jan,

Thank you for this.

Lantsha as used in Tibetan and Mongolia permits various elaborate combinations for mantras, as seen in the upper folio side. For instance, the red graph, of which the candrabindu has been effaced, is read: ha(M)-kSa-ma-la-ba[= va]-ra-ya. Some strategy for dealing with such graphs - whether to treat them as discrete characters (on analogy to Chinese), of to leave them out and require that users paste them in as graphic elements - will at some point need to be made explicit.

But thanks again for the initiative,
and good luck to those participating!

Dear Jan,

I know that there has been an effort to make a Ranjana/Lantsa unicode
script from Anshuman Pandey since at least 2016. Quickly looking over this
new effort in comparison to the 2016 document I see that things are
similar. Just out of curiosity, how long does it usually take to get a new
unicode font approved? I, for one, would be quite glad to see a Ranjana
font and I hope it is finally produced.

With my best wishes,
Charles

Dear list members,

I am looking for a manuscript of Ubhayagrastar?h?daya or Ubhayagr?sar?h?daya of Vijay?ndrat?rtha, an allegorical drama on the lines of the Prabodhacandrodaya and Sa?kalpas?ryodaya. It is listed in the List of Sanskrit manuscripts in Private Libraries of Southern India by Gustav Oppert (vol. 1, no. 2504, p. 228) as being in the collection of V?rasv?m? Aiya?g?r from Sivaganga in Madhurai district (link here: Lists Of Sanskrit Manuscripts In Private Libraries Vol.1 : Oppert, Gustav, Comp. : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.53564/page/n235/mode/2up>).

I would be grateful for any information on where manuscripts from this particular collection may be found?have they been moved to any library, or would anyone have the contact details of whoever has access to the private collection?

Thank you,

Dear Charlie,

Unicode only defines script encodings, not fonts. Once an encoding
enters Unicode, another indeterminate and possibly long time can
pass until fonts, rendering engines and input methods for that
script are created.

To take the Kharo??h? script as an example, Andrew Glass and I had
our encoding for it included in Unicode in 2004 (after an
unusually speedy standardization process of two years), but only a
few years ago did the first fully functional font become available
(as part of Segoe UI Historic), and that only because Andrew
created it. The next version of the Emacs text editor (29) will
have the first convenient Kharo??h? input method, written by me,
so all in all 21 years passed from our first designs to actual
practical support in this case.

That said, it depends on what already exists, of course. In the
case of Ra?jan?, maybe there is a good non-Unicode font that could
be adapted, speeding things up.

All best,
Stefan

Unicode does require a font from authors that can be used during production of code charts, however it does not need to have conjuncts or other dynamic functionality. Encoding is really what you need for interchange, then you can have a font created. I wouldn't wait for system vendors to include a built-in font for all the scripts, that might not happen at all. There is also Google Fonts project trying to cover all encoded scripts with open-source fonts. With newly encoded scripts you rarely need updates to the rendering engine other than giving it new Unicode data, again thanks to Andrew who developed the Universal Shaping Engine.

As for the Unicode process, it really depends on the individual proposal. Sometimes more evidence is needed which might be difficult to source, sometimes we cannot get in touch with the community, sometimes there is a disagreement within the community, sometimes someone says hold on, we will submit a response/feedback and then they never come back, sometimes governments get involved. There are also cases though where the encoding is relatively straightforward and fast, especially when the proposal is well prepared. The demand or urgency from community or scholars can also help move things forward.

Matthew,

Thank you for the photos of a manuscript, I will pass your feedback to the group and author.

Thanks,
Jan

Dear Jan (and Charles and Matthew),

First, regarding the handling of ?stacked? letters:

Both those proposed ideas are a violation of the Unicode standard.  Unicode encodes characters, not glyphs, so it is a non-starter to treat an alphabetic script as a pictographic one (e.g. Chinese).  Second, the rendering of multiple characters as glyphs is what is done at the font-level, *not* the encoding level, and hence the rendering of a stacked group of letters would be something to be encoded in the font and the ?pasting? of graphic representations would defeat the entire purpose of encoding the text.

I would second Charles?s recommendation that you contact Anshu Pandey.  He and I were in contact a few years ago about what to do about missing characters in the Unicode Devan?gar? (U+0900-097F, U+A8E0-A8FF, U+11B00-11B5F) sections, and what it would take to include additional da??as and letter-numerals ? something that remains unresolved.  I would definitely seek out his opinion on these matters.

   One issue to be aware of is that at present, Indic punctuation for many scripts is unified in the Devan?gar? block and individual da??a characters are deprecated, and so, for example, if you look closely at Gujarati (U+0A80-0AFF), Kannada (U+0C80-0CFF), and others you will see that the single and double da??as are mapped to the Devan?gar? block characters (U+0964 & U+0965).  That being said, if you look at Indic scripts in the SMP (Secondary Multilingual Plane) such as Brahmi (U+11000-1107F), that is not the case, so there remains some inconsistency in the treatment of these related scripts.  All the more reason to bring Anshu in on your proposal.

As for fonts, there already exist several Ra?jana fonts (including one in development by Chris Fynn), but most simply map the characters to the Devan?gar? (or another) block, or even to legacy encodings.


What it would take to get a proper Unicode Ra?jana or other Indic script font, however, is always the same answer: money.

For example: based on my work with so-called proto-Bengali manuscripts, I realized the importance of reading pre-14th century Sanskrit in the scripts it was originally written in since ambiguous glyphs in proto-Bengali script(s) are fraudulently rendered as distinct in Devan?gar?, making it nearly impossible to detect mis-readings of a text rendered in that script.  With this in mind, a couple of years ago I put together a proposal for funding to construct such a font to replicate the scripts of such manuscripts.  The first problem that I encountered is that there is no ?proto-Bengali? block in Unicode, only closely related blocks such as Newa (U+11400-1147F) and Tirhuta (U+11480-114DF). Second of all, there are roughly three different ?flavors? of proto-Bengali, some characters of which bear closer resemblance to Newa, while others bear closer resemblance to Tirhuta.

Even leaving such issues aside, choosing a preferred glyph style, and picking a target encoding, even to construct a font with only the bare minimal number of pre-composed glyphs (such as keeping combining vowels as separate like most Devan?gar? fonts), you are still looking at 5,000 to 8,000 glyphs (comparable to Tibetan). You would need to select representative glyphs from your manuscripts, ideally pass all of these on to a professional calligrapher to render them with stylistic consistency, then hand those off to a font construction team that would convert the calligraphic drawings to vector outlines, and then build the combination rules for mapping character sequences to precomposed glyphs, as well as the rules for rendering combining characters such as vowel markers.

To construct just one font in such a manner, we estimated would require between US$25,000 and US$50,000 in cost, and a year to a year-and-a-half to build. To do the same for Ra?jana would be at the top of that spectrum, if not more.

Unfortunately, our proposal was not successful, and my opinion is that the reason for this is that there is a persistent fantasy amongst Indic scholars that these supporting technologies are not part of Indic ?research? (and therefore not deserving of funding), are quick and easy to create, and that such supporting technologies should somehow be provided freely to the content-research part of the community, when the truth is quite the opposite, particularly for scripts for which there is no driving commercial use.

Sorry for going on a bit of a rant, but sometimes these things need to be said with a little force. The short take-away is that if you want these sorts of resources (fonts, encodings, keyboard input methods, etc.), you have to support (philosophically and financially) the construction of them, and not simply expect them to be provided to you out of some sense of noblesse oblige on the part of the tech community.

Paul Hackett

Dear colleagues,

I am happy to report the publication of an edited volume on Da??in?s *Mirror
of Literature* (*K?vy?dar?a?*) and its long-term effects on various
literary traditions in Asia:

Yigal Bronner (ed.). *A Lasting Vision: Dandin's Mirror in the World of
Asian Literature*. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2023. South Asia
Research. ISBN: 9780197642924.

Here is the book abstract:

> *A Lasting Vision* is dedicated to the *Mirror of Literature* (
> *Kavyadarsa*), a Sanskrit treatise on poetics composed by Dandin in south
> India (c. 700 CE), and to the treatise's remarkable career throughout large
> parts of Asia. The *Mirror* was adapted and translated into several
> languages spoken on the southern Indian peninsula (Kannada, Tamil) and on
> the Island of Sri Lanka (Sinhala, Pali), as well as in the Tibetan plateau
> far to the north (Tibetan, Mongolian). In all these receiving cultures it
> became a classical text and a source of constant engagement and innovation,
> often well into the modern era. It also travelled to Burma and Thailand,
> where it held a place of honor in Buddhist monastic education and
> intellectual life, and likely to the islands of Java and Bali, where it
> contributed to the production of literature in Old Javanese. There is even
> reason to believe that it reached China and impacted Chinese literary
> culture, although far more peripherally than in other parts of Asia. It
> also maintained a prominent position in Sanskrit learned discourses

Dear Paul,

there was talk of encoding Ra?jan? when I was at Berkeley around
2011, between the Mangalam Center and Deborah Anderson and her
Script Encoding Initiative, and preliminary suggestions by Everson
(2009) and Manandhar, Karmacharya and Chitrakar (2014). Anshuman
then wrote his discussion paper in 2016:

   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16015-ranjana.pdf

I do not know what the remaining issues are.

just followed our precedent with Kharo??h?.

Maybe only of historical interest now, but I originally intended
the proposal to cover all pre-modern Br?hm?-derived scripts
(possibly including Ra?jan?), much like all European variants of

If you are thinking of things like the va vs. ba issue, then it
still seems to me that separate code blocks are not absolutely
necessary, just as the editor of a Latin text might decide to only
use the letter u (not v) for both vowel and consonant to avoid
subjective decisions, without needing to resort to separate Uncial
(or whatever) codepoints for that.

All best,
Stefan

Thank you for the discussion. I want to point out that the proposal for Ranjana/Lantsa that we are seeking feedback on is authored by Anshuman, so he is definitely involved.

Whether script has its own dandas or the ones in Devanagari block is decided on per-script basis. Contributing to the decision is how different the script dandas are from the existing dandas, the user community, the keyboard layouts commonly available in the region etc. We would nowadays expect proposals to justify the way they suggest dandas should be (or not be) encoded. The font file is not concerned with identity and politics, having danda in the Devanagari block is nothing but different numbers.

Thanks,
Jan

Dear Stefan,

> If you are thinking of things like the va vs. ba issue, 

No, I am talking about far more problematic confusions than va vs. ba (or even ca).  I became aware of this when working on some texts that had been published in Devan?gar?, but which contained numerous nonsensical readings.  When I looked back at the original manuscripts, I discovered that many of the glyphs had been misread.  
    I later discovered additional evidence of this even when reading some Tibetan translations (lacking Sanskrit originals), such that when I back translated nonsensical passages into Sanskrit then accounted for misread glyphs, all of a sudden the passages became intelligible again.  

Below are some examples of what I mean by potentially confused and conflated glyphs.  As you can see, such glyphs would be presented unambiguously in Devan?gar?, but if the original manuscript was misread (even by a copyist), the rendering of the text in Devan?gar? would completely mask the confusion of the glyphs, which would only become clear again when rendered back in the original script.

IMO, no one should be reading anything written pre-14th century using Devan?gar? for this reason.  Such texts *really* need to be rendered in their original scripts, or at least as close to them as possible.

Best,

Paul

Message-ID: <04375D03-2D00-4E28-A542-E944C124B041@ephe.psl.eu>

Dear colleagues,

a few days ago I tried to post a job advertisement on H-Buddhism, but to my dismay, I have been told by a moderator that they can only share it if I already posted it on H-Net Job Guide, which costs 300$ (!). So I humbly invite colleagues who are subscribed to other (free) Buddhological lists to share it via those channels, or send it directly to potentially interested applicants. (A .pdf of the announcement pasted below can be downloaded from https://grei.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Appel-a-candidatures-MANTRA.pdf)


Call for applications: Post-doctoral researcher in Buddhist studies?philology (areas: India, Tibet, China, or Southeast Asia) or history of art (areas: South or Southeast Asia)

Application deadline: Sunday 14 May 2023


General information

Research unit: Groupe de Recherche en ?tudes Indiennes (EA2120) - https://grei.fr/en/home<https://grei.fr/en/home/>

Place of work (administrative affiliation): Campus Condorcet, Paris

Type of contract: fixed-term research contract, post-doctoral contract

Contract duration: 24 months

Expected date of employment: from June or September 2023

Working hours: Full time

Remuneration: 2,791 euros gross (ca. 2,252 euros net)

Desired level of education: PhD

General overview of the position

The post-doctoral fellow will contribute to the realization of a research project entitled MANTRA (Maritime Asian Networks of Buddhist Tantra; ANR-22-CE27-0015<https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-22-CE27-0015>) at the ?cole Pratique des Hautes ?tudes (EPHE, Universit? PSL) / GREI (EA2120), financed by the JCJC programme of the French Agency for Scientific Research (ANR).

General objective

Based on primary sources in Sanskrit/Tibetan/Chinese/Old Javanese, and/or objects and icons (statues, reliefs, paintings) from South and/or Southeast Asia, the recruited fellow will study the mobility of Buddhist monks and ritual agents across Maritime Asia, with a particular focus on sources, objects, and agents of Mah?y?na Buddhist Tantra in the medieval period (ca. 700?1400 CE). Periods of research in Asia (with funding from the project) will be considered if necessary.

Description of the tasks

The postdoctoral fellow will participate in the tasks of the project, in particular research on textual or visual sources in the geographical and cultural areas concerned by the project; analysis of a relevant documentary corpus from archives; creation and feeding of a website (www.hypotheses.org<http://www.hypotheses.org/>); publications and presentations in conferences in collaboration with the rest of the team; organisation of conferences, panels, and symposia.

Expected competences

  *   The candidate must hold a PhD, and demonstrate research competence through at least one publication.
  *   Proficiency in at least one Asian language relevant to the project (viz. Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, Old Javanese, Indonesian, etc.) is required for the ?philology? profile, but also recommended for the ?art history? profile.
  *   Fluency in English is mandatory.

Working environment

The recruited researcher will be integrated into the team of the MANTRA project, and supervised by Andrea Acri, Assistant Professor/Senior Lecturer in Tantric Studies at the EPHE. The position is attached to the EPHE and the GREI research unit (EA2120) in Paris (Campus Condorcet). However, the nature of the work will offer a certain flexibility? to the recruited researcher, who will be able to reside as close as possible to the archives.

Constraints and risks

No particular constraints or risks.

Applications

They will include a CV; a short written presentation (2?4 pages) on a research topic within the scientific framework of the MANTRA project, including a two-year research plan and a description of any activities and stays abroad; a copy of the thesis and/or a publication (scientific article) in digital format. The successful candidate will be informed of the decision regarding his/her application by 20 May 2023 at the latest.

Email contact (information and application): andrea.acri [at] ephe.psl.eu


Best regards,

Andrea
