Oh dear.  They're retro-cataloguing into Aleph, an obsolete, flat-file
library system from the 1980s.  What a waste of time and effort, creating
yet another ghetto of non-linked, unintelligent data.  Manuscripts *are not
printed books*. Every manuscript is a unique antiquity.  Library systems
are not the right tool for the job.

May I say clearly for all to hear.  Information concerning manuscripts, the
literary works they supprt, locations, authors, scribes and owners should
be recorded in a normalized
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization> relational database
system.  Ideally, there should also be XML import and export (report)
facilities, or the whole database may be an XML system.

A model for how to do this properly is the PanditProject
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization>.   There is, in
fact, no reason that the Bayerische SB shouldn't retrospectively catalogue
their Indian manuscripts into PanditProject itself.  That would actually be
of huge immediate value to the international academic community of S. Asia
scholars.  But an institution of the SB's size is probably too rule-bound
and inflexible to consider such a procedure.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk

Berlin) has asked me to send the following message to the list.

Best regards,

* * *

Dear Prof Wujastyk, dear readers,
I would like to comment briefly on your post on the job announcement  
of the Bavarian State Library in Munich.
The Qalamos[1] project has been running for three years with the  
support of the DFG. The goal is to create records of all Oriental  
manuscripts preserved in German institutions. This is done by  
retroconversion of printed catalogs but also by integration of  
existing electronic catalogs such as KOHD-Digital[2].
In recent years, the focus has been on Islamic manuscripts. We now  
hope to create metadata of similar quality for South Asian manuscript  
traditions by 2026.
Qalamos does not run on Aleph, but on a MyCoRe[3] repository. I cannot  
address here the BSB's peculiarity of primarily recording its own  
holdings in the classical library catalog, but all data will finally  
be integrated in Qalamos.
We welcome suggestions, ideas and exchange with the  
South-Asian-Studies-community!
?
Kind regards
Christoph

Please convey my apologies to Dr Rauch for jumping to conclusions from the
job advertisement.  I wish the project every success.  I hope Qalamos and
MyCoRe give a relational approach to data capture and storage.  Once one
gets beyond cataloguing a few hundred Indian manuscripts, it becomes
exponentially harder to keep the data consistent and coherent unless each
data point is stored in one place only, i.e., in a normalised relational
database.

It is good to learn that MyCoRe makes data publicly available.  One
prominent application of MyCoRe mentioned in the Wikipedia page is the "The
International Treasury of Islamic Manuscripts", but I am unable to find a
working website for that project.  If anyone has a working link, please
share

And may I add that *any* cataloguing of Indic manuscripts is highly
appreciated.

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk

Dear All,

Has anyone yet compiled an exhaustive list of lipis used in Sanskrit manuscripts.

I have extracted a list from the NMM database but the data is quite noisy so I am not sure I can trust it. In case anyone is aware of a curated and vetted list I would be most grateful. If it is chronologically and geographically annotated this would be even more wonderful.

With warmest wishes,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] position of Professor of Cultural and Intellectual
 History of Pre-Modern South Asia, University of Vienna
Message-ID: <56c52ab884ecc4793c0d5d3cc19bf2ab@univie.ac.at>

Dear colleagues,

At the kind suggestion of a colleague I want to clarify that the 
currently advertised position will continue, in a more broadly conceived 
form (see the text of the advertisement) and under different formal and 
administrative conditions due to the autonomy of the University of 
Vienna (since 2004), the present Chair of Indology from which I will be 
retiring by the end of September 2023.

The position will be one among four professorial positions at the 
Department in the following fields: Cultural and Intellectual History of 
Pre-Modern South Asia, Languages and Cultures of Modern South and Inner 
Asia (full professor, with a focus on Himalayan Studies and Modern South 
Asia; the position will hopefully be filled in the course of the 
academic year of 2023/2024), Buddhist Studies (tenure track position, 
which will be filled from October 1, 2023 onwards); and Tibetan Studies 
(full professor, filled from August 1, 2023 onwards).

I very much encourage all qualified colleagues to apply for the position 
in what in my eyes and experience is a wonderful academic environment 
with a perfect constellation of professorial positions opening up the 
potential of numerous synergies in research and teaching, which are 
augmented by a good number of post-doctoral and doctoral positions, 
especially after October 1 this year when the implementation of the 
first half of the comprehensive generational change at the Department 
will have been effected.

With many thanks for your attention and best regards,

Karin Preisendanz

Dear Scholars,

I would appreciate references to articles or books, available digitally, that analyze the Gita?s moral philosophy, especially but not exclusively from the standpoint of Western moral philosophy. More specifically, I wish to explore what for me is the dubious claim that the Euthyphro dilemma necessarily problematizes divine command theories of moral realism. 

Sorry if this is a rather abstruse request.

I could locate this article
The Euthyphro, Divine Command Theory and Moral Realism
GERALD K. HARRISON
Philosophy
Vol. 90, No. 351 (January 2015) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40166555>,
pp. 107-123 (17 pages)
Published By: Cambridge University Press

https://www.jstor.org/stable/44015142

AbstractDivine command theories of metaethics are commonly rejected on the
basis of the Euthyphro problem. In this paper, I argue that the Euthyphro
can be raised for all forms of moral realism. I go on to argue that this
does not matter as the Euthyphro is not really a problem after all. I then
briefly outline some of the attractions of a divine command theory of
metaethics. I suggest that given one of the major reasons for rejecting
such an analysis has been found to be unsound divine command theories
deserve to be taken more seriously in contemporary metaethics.

Greetings Nagaraj, thanks for your inquiry.

The usual attempt to deploy the Euthyphro dilemma ? are some acts good because the gods command them, or do the gods command them because they are good ? seems to go like this:

a. If acts are good because gods command them, then the acts are not intrinsically good, and the gods may change their mind. Thus on this account there is no objective moral good, and the attempt to establish objective morality by divine command fails.

b. If the gods enjoin certain acts because they are intrinsically good, then we don?t need divine authority to establish objective moral good.

To establish the Gita?s implicit, deducible view on this issue, I am examing every statement in the Gita which employs an imperative verb ? such as kuru, utti??ha, viddhi etc, or negative commands such as m? gama? etc. I am also examining what MW calls ?a softened form of the imperative,? ie the infinitive with the auxiliary verb arh, as in ?na tva? ?ocitum arhasi.?

My impression is that the G?t? teaches an intrinsic moral good, rather than a morally neutral act or state that is made good merely by divine command. Thus the G?t? claims (14.6) that ?sattva-gu?a? is [intrinsically] prak??akam, enlightening, and an?mayam, free of [gross] contamination. Similarly, goodness itself brings wisdom, sattv?t sa?j?yate j??na? 14.17 etc, happiness (14.6 etc), and future elevation, ?rdhva? gacchanti sattva-sth?? 14.8.

I think it can be shown, philosophically, that the intrinsic goodness of certain acts and states does not render a Deity superfluous. Just one example: even intrinsic good can have a source (Bg 10.8 etc). 

Sorry for the long post,
Howard

Dear Howard

I don't think any of the following discuss the Euthyphro dilemma
specifically, but they all analyze 'the ethics of the G?t?' using either
the framework of the consequentialism / deontology / virtue ethics
trichotomy or the categories of western axiology.

Perrett, Roy W. 1998. *Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study. * The G?ta's
ethics are discussed in all 4 chapters, but especially the first 3.

Perrett, Roy W. 2005. 'Hindu Ethics?' In *The Blackwell Companion to
Religious Ethics.* Edited by William Schweiker. Oxford: Blackwell
Publishing, pp. 323?29.

Sreekumar, Sandeep. 2012. 'An Analysis of Consequentialism and Deontology
in the Normative Ethics of the Bhagavadg?t?.' *Journal of Indian Philosophy*
40: 277?315.

Frazier Jessica. 2021. 'Ethics in Classical Hindu Philosophy: Provinces of
Consequence, Agency, and Value in the Bhagavad G?t? and Other Epic and
??stric Texts.' *Religions* 12(11), 1029;

Not set in terms of the Euthyphro dilemma, but Kant's ethics of duty has some affinity with it.

Dear Howard

I don't think any of the following discuss the Euthyphro dilemma specifically, but they all analyze 'the ethics of the G?t?' using either the framework of the consequentialism / deontology / virtue ethics trichotomy or the categories of western axiology.

Perrett, Roy W. 1998. Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study.  The G?ta's ethics are discussed in all 4 chapters, but especially the first 3.

Perrett, Roy W. 2005. 'Hindu Ethics?' In The Blackwell Companion to Religious Ethics. Edited by William Schweiker. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, pp. 323?29.

Sreekumar, Sandeep. 2012. 'An Analysis of Consequentialism and Deontology in the Normative Ethics of the Bhagavadg?t?.' Journal of Indian Philosophy 40: 277?315.

Frazier Jessica. 2021. 'Ethics in Classical Hindu Philosophy: Provinces of Consequence, Agency, and Value in the Bhagavad G?t? and Other Epic and ??stric Texts.' Religions 12(11), 1029; https://doi.org/10.3390/rel12111029

Dear Scholars,

I would appreciate references to articles or books, available digitally, that analyze the Gita?s moral philosophy, especially but not exclusively from the standpoint of Western moral philosophy. More specifically, I wish to explore what for me is the dubious claim that the Euthyphro dilemma necessarily problematizes divine command theories of moral realism.

Sorry if this is a rather abstruse request.

Best wishes,
Howard

I do not know whether in the Greek philosophical discussion, the question
of adhikaarabheda was brought by either Plato or Euthyphro with regard to
the question of

are some acts good because the gods command them, or do the gods command
them because they are good

But in a typical Vedic / Indic setup of such discussions ,

answers to such questions are resolved through the method of adhikaara
bheda

For a non scholarly adhikaari :  some acts good because the gods command
them,

and for a scholarly adhikaari  : the gods command them because they are
good

scholarly adhikaari does not hesitate to reason out why the acts are good
independent of the command from the god(s) and then reason out that as the
reason for the god(s) commanding it

  a non scholarly adhikaari does not put that effort to reasoning and
follows the easy path of reasoning, namely  those acts are good because the
gods command them.

The verses such as

??????????? ???? ?????? ??????????? ?
?????? ????? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ????

in " Geetaamaahatmya" ,

do not reflect any attitude of command towards the sentences addressed by
Krishna to Arjuna. Such verses do not hesitate to characterize the
sentences addressed by Krishna to Arjuna as the summary distilled from
older texts Upanishads that are not actually viewed as 'His' command.
Upanishads have many examples of reasoning out to lead to certain
conclusions.

Scholars in their discussions , deliberations , bhaashyas, vyaakhyaanas ,
vaakyaarthas, shaastraarthas,  pravachanas etc., spend a great amount of
their discourse in reasoning out the logical validity of the sentences
addressed by Krishna to Arjuna.

Why, Arjuna himself is made to reason out with Krishna regarding the
reasonability or quality of making sense in the  words of Krishna and goes
to the extent of saying ,

????????????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ?? ? ????? ?? ????????? ???
?????????????????? 3-2.

 " ??? ?????????????????? "

  shows that Arjuna is asking for the basis of ?????? for the validity of
the instruction, not reflecting any attitude of following the instruction
just because it is a divine command.

??? ?? ????????????? ???????????????? ????

??????????????? ???????? ??? ??????18.63??

 divine command too shows that the author of Geetaa does not make Krishna's
words any command.

Dear all,

many thanks to everyone who responded to my query. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a better copy of the volume than that available also in the Indology collection of catalogues (https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/index.php/s/yfwp8XFRtmnQ8Mr?path=%2FBiswas%200188%20Calcutta%20Sanskrit%20College <https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/index.php/s/yfwp8XFRtmnQ8Mr?path=/Biswas%200188%20Calcutta%20Sanskrit%20College>), which is totally unreadable here and there. If I will succeed in getting the only one copy of the volume available in Italy (in Florence), I will make a soft copy of it and pass it to the Indology list managers.

Best wishes,

Marco

Dear all,
many thanks to everyone who responded to my query. Unfortunately there
doesn't seem to be a better copy of the volume than that available
also in the Indology collection of catalogues
(https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/index.php/s/yfwp8XFRtmnQ8Mr?path=%2FBiswas%200188%20Calcutta%20Sanskrit%20College
), which is totally unreadable here and there. If I will succeed in
getting the only one copy of the volume available in Italy (in
Florence), I will make a soft copy of it and pass it to the Indology
list managers.

Best wishes,

Marco

Just noticed that there was an inadvertent typing in my post . I wanted to
say

??? ?? ????????????? ???????????????? ????

??????????????? ???????? ??? ??????18.63??

 too shows that the author of Geetaa does not make Krishna's words any
command.

That getting typed as

divine command too shows that the author of Geetaa does not make Krishna's
words any command

was some inadvertent typing mistake.

Dear Howard,

It has nothing to do with the G?t? and I do not recall if it explicitly engages with Euthyphro, but this may nevertheless be pertinent to the philosophical issues that concern you, if you?re not already familiar with it:

Message-ID: <AM0PR01MB42126538AAB986F52B6772FBF530A@AM0PR01MB4212.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Dear Colleagues,
I'm delighted to report that, starting October, all of our regular Sanskrit courses at SOAS will be online and open to non-SOAS students thanks to the Associate Student programme<https://www.soas.ac.uk/study/short-courses-overview/associate-student-programme>.

Sanskrit Language 1<https://www.soas.ac.uk/courseunits/sanskrit-language-1> and Sanskrit Language 2<https://www.soas.ac.uk/courseunits/sanskrit-language-2-0> each run on a term-by-term basis for the entire academic year, with 4 hours of classroom teaching a week (2 x 2 hrs., most likely on Mondays and Wednesdays).
These can be credit-bearing and assessed if so desired.

Having finished Sanskrit Language 1, the student will be able to work with simple original texts and Sanskrit 2 is mainly focused on gaining reading fluency.

If you know any students who might be interested in these more intense Sanskrit courses, please do ask them to contact me.

With warmest wishes for a lovely summer break,
Lidia


Dr Lidia Wojtczak
Lecturer in Sanskrit and Phonology

Respected Scholars,
Presently I am engaged studying "NaishkarmaSiddhi" by Sureshwaracharya.I would be grateful if someone may enlighten me on the actual connotation of the term "Naishkarma". I feel curious to get an answer to this , in the light of the fact that the book contains sutras which specifies the idea that observing/ performing daily/regular duties(NityaKarma), helps us to attain "Moksha" or liberation.Then why is the title of book"NaishkarmaSiddhi"?RegardsAlakendu Das&nbsp;

You're very welcome, Howard.

Two books on Indian moral philosophy that may be pertinent to thinking about Euthyphro's dilemma, even if they do not directly reference it, are
B. K. Matilal, Moral Dilemmas in the Mah?bharata
and the essayist Gurcharan Das's The Difficulty of Being Good

best,
Matthew

information".  Could you share them?

Best wishes, and good wishes also for the new initiative,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Euthyphro and Brahma Sutra 2.1.34
Message-ID: <CAFZJJzE4fPJA=WB6gFKMQfDfR7h3+7C__Q5LMp36H4j1LnwSng@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Howard,

It's not the on Bhagavad G?t?, but in an article from 2016 I discussed BS
2.1.34 (*vai?amyanairgh??ye* *na s?pek?atv?t tath? hi dar?ayati*), and
suggested that questions of God's dependence (*s?pek?atva*) on karma can be
read as an Indian analogue of the Euthyphro dilemma:

https://www.academia.edu/22481929/Hindu_Disproofs_of_God_Refuting_Vedantic_Theism_in_the_Samkhya_Sutra

I followed up on this theme in another article where I compared three
commentaries (by ?a?kara, R?m?nuja, and Baladeva) on the Brahma S?tras that
struggle with this and other questions about god's ethical and creative
independence:

https://www.academia.edu/44135134/Making_Space_for_God_Karma_Freedom_and_Devotion_in_the_Brahmas%C5%ABtra_Commentaries_of_%C5%9Aa%E1%B9%85kara_R%C4%81m%C4%81nuja_and_Baladeva

Dear Dominik and other colleagues who raised this point,
I apologise for not making this clearer.
Unfortunately, all universities in the UK require that students pay tuition. The prices for all of the SOAS courses made available to Associate Students (i.e., non-SOAS students) are set by the University on a cost-per-credit basis. As Lubomir has noted, this is ?850 for 15 credit modules (1 term). I realise that this will be discouraging for many interested and gifted students, which is a huge shame. Sadly, there is nothing I, or anyone else, can do to impact these fees at the moment, we can only hope that the success of this and similar initiatives will compel universities to rethink these fee structures in the future.
With warm wishes,
Lidia

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit characters: a comparison of 12 fonts and their
 coverage of conjuncts
Message-ID: <6D63E544-1DED-4903-90F5-D37199C01C6F@gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

In 2016 (Friday, 17 June 2:28pm) I shared the results of the ligature formation produced by several Devanagari fonts.  I have just completed a revised comparison and thought it would be useful to share the results of this comparison as well.  A PDF of the comparison is available on The Sanskrit Library's Publications page at https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html under the title Sanskrit characters: a comparison of 12 fonts and their coverage of conjuncts.  As previously I compared 1260 ligatures formed by the LaTeX Skt package with seven Unicode fonts.  The ligatures compared were the combined set of all those listed by Ulrich Stiehl in his document, Conjunct Consonants in Sanskrit, Heidelberg, 21 April 2003, pp. 4--34, and those listed in the Skt package documentation Sanskrit for LaTeX2e, pp. 22--35.  The fonts compared this time add Siddhanta, Sanskrit2020, Shobhika-Regular, and Shobhika-Bold.  The full list is as follows:

1. LaTeX Skt package
2. Chandas
3. Uttara
4. Siddhanta
5. Sanskrit2003
6. Sanskrit2020
7. Shobhika-Regular
8. Shobhika-Bold
9. Praja
10. Arial Unicode MS
11. Devanagari MT
12. Mangal

The LaTeX Skt package comes with the TeXLive installation available at https://www.tug.org/texlive/.  The Chandas, Uttara, and Siddhanta fonts were produced by Mihail Bayaryn.  The first two are available at http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/; all three are linked to http://svayambhava.blogspot.com/p/siddhanta-devanagariunicode-open-type.html.  The Sanskrit2003 font was produced by Ulrich Stiehl and is available at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/itranslator2003.htm, and the Sanskrit2020 font is an updated version of it that includes the VedicExtensions Unicode block to accommodate Vedic accents available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/advaita-sharada-font/files/Devanagari/.  These fonts are all available free of cost.  Praja was produced by Peter Freund and is available for $35 at https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=5115&PRODUCTID=51150002.  Arial Unicode MS is available with Microsoft Office, FrontPage and Publisher, with the installation of international support.  Devanagari MT is available with Mac systems with the Asian languages support.  Mangal is available with Windows systems with supplemental language support.

The comparison showed that the Shobhika fonts (Regular and Bold) are able to produce all conjuncts correctly, without the interruption of an inappropriate vir?ma, with the exception of two ?ty and ???h.  Siddhanta excepts just four: ?k??v, ?khn, ddbr, l?l.  Chandas and Uttara are able to form all conjuncts correctly with the exception of seven sequences: ?k??v, ?rvy, ?hthy, d??, ddbr, ddvr, l?l.  The LaTeX Skt package handles all but 29.  Sanskrit 2003 lacked 82, Sanskrit 2020 lacks 81, Praja 187, Arial Unicode MS 202, Devanagari MT 232, and Mangal 236.

I also checked the behavior of the fonts in handling the accents in the Devanagari extended, and Vedic extensions Unicode pages.  Only Praja font handled them all properly, the LaTeX Skt package handles most Vedic accentuation, Sanskrit 2020 handles all but the Maitr?ya?? Sa?hit? midstroke.  Shobhika handles all but this and the Samaveda accents.  Most fonts handled only the common accentual system.  A test of Vedic accents with any font can be performed by visiting the Sanskrit Library's interactive Vedic Unicode character phonetic value table at http://sanskritlibrary.org/accents.html.  Simply set your browser to use the font you would like to test.

The first eight fonts listed, i.e. Shobhika, Siddhanta, Chandas, Uttara, LaTeX Skt, Sanskrit 2003 and 2020, and Praja, are therefore commendable; the last three are inadequate for Sanskrit.  Mihail Bayaryn's fonts use private code points to handle accents.  It would be desirable for him to upgrade his fonts, which otherwise handle conjuncts very comprehensively, to handle the Vedic characters in the two Unicode pages mentioned including in particular the combining candrabindu with semivowels l, y, and v.

Other Indic fonts not tested are described on the University of Chicago's South Asia Language Resource Center page at http://salrc.uchicago.edu/resources/fonts/available/hindi/.

Yours,
Peter

Dear Friends,

Might someone know more about this mention on p. 71
<https://books.google.co.jp/books?lr=&hl=ja&id=JYuJWxLv-U0C&dq=indian+sword+dance&q=pole#v=snippet&q=pole&f=false>

in

Ancient Indian And Indo-Greek Theatre??: M.L. Varadpande

of *mankhas (pole dancers)* who frequented Yak?a shrines?

I'm not having much luck.

Thank you.


All the best,

This is a most helpful reference, thank you!

My own table of comparisons is more aimed at conveying the look-and-feel of
fonts as text, with a few diagnostic conjuncts thrown in.

   -
   https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2021/05/expanded-devanagari-font-comparison-33.html

All this makes me think that we should develop some Lorem Ipsum text, and
some "Quick brown fox
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog>"
text for Devanagari, as a kind of stress test or trip test.

Best,
Dominik

Great work!

 

I would like to second the immense need for pangrams and/or reference text excerpts in all the Indic scripts this community can cover so that industry has a reliable source to verify their fonts or text rendering implementations.

 

I would also point out that Arial Unicode MS is no longer maintained or shipped with Office for about 10 years and should not be considered for any practical purposes. 

 

Best regards,

Jan

Dear Indologists,

 

In 2016 (Friday, 17 June 2:28pm) I shared the results of the ligature formation produced by several Devanagari fonts.  I have just completed a revised comparison and thought it would be useful to share the results of this comparison as well.  A PDF of the comparison is available on The Sanskrit Library's Publications page at https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html under the title Sanskrit characters: a comparison of 12 fonts and their coverage of conjuncts.  As previously I compared 1260 ligatures formed by the LaTeX Skt package with seven Unicode fonts.  The ligatures compared were the combined set of all those listed by Ulrich Stiehl in his document, Conjunct Consonants in Sanskrit, Heidelberg, 21 April 2003, pp. 4--34, and those listed in the Skt package documentation Sanskrit for LaTeX2e, pp. 22--35.  The fonts compared this time add Siddhanta, Sanskrit2020, Shobhika-Regular, and Shobhika-Bold.  The full list is as follows:

 

1. LaTeX Skt package

2. Chandas

3. Uttara

4. Siddhanta

5. Sanskrit2003

6. Sanskrit2020

7. Shobhika-Regular

8. Shobhika-Bold

9. Praja

10. Arial Unicode MS

11. Devanagari MT

12. Mangal

 

The LaTeX Skt package comes with the TeXLive installation available at https://www.tug.org/texlive/.  The Chandas, Uttara, and Siddhanta fonts were produced by Mihail Bayaryn.  The first two are available at http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/; all three are linked to http://svayambhava.blogspot.com/p/siddhanta-devanagariunicode-open-type.html.  The Sanskrit2003 font was produced by Ulrich Stiehl and is available at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/itranslator2003.htm, and the Sanskrit2020 font is an updated version of it that includes the VedicExtensions Unicode block to accommodate Vedic accents available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/advaita-sharada-font/files/Devanagari/.  These fonts are all available free of cost.  Praja was produced by Peter Freund and is available for $35 at https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=5115 <https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=5115&PRODUCTID=51150002> &PRODUCTID=51150002.  Arial Unicode MS is available with Microsoft Office, FrontPage and Publisher, with the installation of international support.  Devanagari MT is available with Mac systems with the Asian languages support.  Mangal is available with Windows systems with supplemental language support.

 

The comparison showed that the Shobhika fonts (Regular and Bold) are able to produce all conjuncts correctly, without the interruption of an inappropriate vir?ma, with the exception of two ?ty and ???h.  Siddhanta excepts just four: ?k??v, ?khn, ddbr, l?l.  Chandas and Uttara are able to form all conjuncts correctly with the exception of seven sequences: ?k??v, ?rvy, ?hthy, d??, ddbr, ddvr, l?l.  The LaTeX Skt package handles all but 29.  Sanskrit 2003 lacked 82, Sanskrit 2020 lacks 81, Praja 187, Arial Unicode MS 202, Devanagari MT 232, and Mangal 236.

 

I also checked the behavior of the fonts in handling the accents in the Devanagari extended, and Vedic extensions Unicode pages.  Only Praja font handled them all properly, the LaTeX Skt package handles most Vedic accentuation, Sanskrit 2020 handles all but the Maitr?ya?? Sa?hit? midstroke.  Shobhika handles all but this and the Samaveda accents.  Most fonts handled only the common accentual system.  A test of Vedic accents with any font can be performed by visiting the Sanskrit Library's interactive Vedic Unicode character phonetic value table at http://sanskritlibrary.org/accents.html.  Simply set your browser to use the font you would like to test.

 

The first eight fonts listed, i.e. Shobhika, Siddhanta, Chandas, Uttara, LaTeX Skt, Sanskrit 2003 and 2020, and Praja, are therefore commendable; the last three are inadequate for Sanskrit.  Mihail Bayaryn's fonts use private code points to handle accents.  It would be desirable for him to upgrade his fonts, which otherwise handle conjuncts very comprehensively, to handle the Vedic characters in the two Unicode pages mentioned including in particular the combining candrabindu with semivowels l, y, and v.

 

Other Indic fonts not tested are described on the University of Chicago's South Asia Language Resource Center page at http://salrc.uchicago.edu/resources/fonts/available/hindi/.

 

Yours,

Peter

Dear all,

I am looking for a soft copy of the complete AsvSS, e.g. one of those
listed by Goto in Pr?sensklassen, 363. Archive.org seems to have only
the second kanda. Does anybody have an idea where to find it?

I feel curious to get an answer to this , in the light of the fact that the book contains sutras which specifies the idea that observing/ performing daily/regular duties(NityaKarma), helps us to attain "Moksha" or liberation.Then why is the title of book"NaishkarmaSiddhi"?RegardsAlakendu Das&nbsp;

Message-ID: <CAASxWBHjXJwY1VReRrip_Ru10wac7vm5ne7ZyVhgb=-7NWZh4A@mail.gmail.com>

Colleagues,

Pleased to share my monograph, *Modern Jainism: A Historical Approach
(2023)* https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-99-2485-1
This book examines the lives and ideologies of some of the most influential
19th and 20th-century Jain ascetic leaders that remain little known in the
Western world. The book's first part provides a detailed philosophical
overview of Jain thought based on the seminal Hindi text *Jain Darshan*.

Taking this opportunity also to share the two recently co-edited volumes:
*1.** Indian and Western Philosophical Concepts in Religion* (2023)
https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781793623157/Indian-and-Western-Philosophical-Concepts-in-Religion
(co-edited with Jeffery Long)
This volume is based on ideas from different Indic philosophies and how
they can enrich the theory and methods in religious studies.

*2.* *(Springer Encyclopedia of) **Hinduism and Tribal Religions* (2022)
https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-94-024-1188-1
(co-edited with Jeffery Long, Rita Sherma, and Madhu Khanna)

Dear Alakendu,

It is naishkarmya not naishkarma

nishkarma --- taddhita ---- > naishkarmya

It need not be called isiddhi if it is simply not doing karmas that is
intended here.

Dear all,

I was enquired offline about the Arial Unicode MS situation and potential replacements.

You can read a bit about the Arial Unicode MS here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/arial-unicode-ms and https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20181030-00/?p=100085. In short, this font?s purpose was to cover the whole Unicode, which is no longer possible because it simply does not fit into the technical limits of the current font file format, so it had to be discontinued.

You can see the list of Devanagari (and other) fonts currently available on Windows here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/windows_11_font_list#devanagari-supplemental-fonts ? note that they are intended to cover various languages, for full Sanskrit range the best bet would be Sanskrit Text, created by very experienced type designers (that we can reach out to if needed) and first shipped in 2015, see its description here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/sanskrit-text. It is a bit unfortunate that this font is missing in both Peter?s document and the now quite outdated University of Chicago website.

Ignoring the few Devanagari signs added to Unicode last year, the newest characters are Devanagari AY (U+A8FE and U+A8FF) from 2018. Searching the fonts shipping with Windows containing this character, you only get 3 fonts back: Nirmala UI 1.46, Nirmala Text 1.00 (which might be only available on preview builds of Windows 11) and indeed Sanskrit Text 1.03, which you can get, as suggested above, by installing ?Devanagari Supplemental Fonts? optional package (Settings > Apps > Optional features > Add an optional feature).

It would be helpful if Peter in his PDF listed the full font names he used to create the tables, including their versions, since not everyone referring to it would know to look into this thread.

Hope this helps,

Great work!

I would like to second the immense need for pangrams and/or reference text excerpts in all the Indic scripts this community can cover so that industry has a reliable source to verify their fonts or text rendering implementations.

I would also point out that Arial Unicode MS is no longer maintained or shipped with Office for about 10 years and should not be considered for any practical purposes.

Best regards,
Jan

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit characters: a comparison of 12 fonts and their coverage of conjuncts

This is a most helpful reference, thank you!

My own table of comparisons is more aimed at conveying the look-and-feel of fonts as text, with a few diagnostic conjuncts thrown in.

  *   https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2021/05/expanded-devanagari-font-comparison-33.html
All this makes me think that we should develop some Lorem Ipsum text, and some "Quick brown fox<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog>" text for Devanagari, as a kind of stress test or trip test.

Best,
Dominik

Dear Indologists,

In 2016 (Friday, 17 June 2:28pm) I shared the results of the ligature formation produced by several Devanagari fonts.  I have just completed a revised comparison and thought it would be useful to share the results of this comparison as well.  A PDF of the comparison is available on The Sanskrit Library's Publications page at https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html under the title Sanskrit characters: a comparison of 12 fonts and their coverage of conjuncts.  As previously I compared 1260 ligatures formed by the LaTeX Skt package with seven Unicode fonts.  The ligatures compared were the combined set of all those listed by Ulrich Stiehl in his document, Conjunct Consonants in Sanskrit, Heidelberg, 21 April 2003, pp. 4--34, and those listed in the Skt package documentation Sanskrit for LaTeX2e, pp. 22--35.  The fonts compared this time add Siddhanta, Sanskrit2020, Shobhika-Regular, and Shobhika-Bold.  The full list is as follows:

1. LaTeX Skt package
2. Chandas
3. Uttara
4. Siddhanta
5. Sanskrit2003
6. Sanskrit2020
7. Shobhika-Regular
8. Shobhika-Bold
9. Praja
10. Arial Unicode MS
11. Devanagari MT
12. Mangal

The LaTeX Skt package comes with the TeXLive installation available at https://www.tug.org/texlive/.  The Chandas, Uttara, and Siddhanta fonts were produced by Mihail Bayaryn.  The first two are available at http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/; all three are linked to http://svayambhava.blogspot.com/p/siddhanta-devanagariunicode-open-type.html.  The Sanskrit2003 font was produced by Ulrich Stiehl and is available at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/itranslator2003.htm, and the Sanskrit2020 font is an updated version of it that includes the VedicExtensions Unicode block to accommodate Vedic accents available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/advaita-sharada-font/files/Devanagari/.  These fonts are all available free of cost.  Praja was produced by Peter Freund and is available for $35 at https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=5115&PRODUCTID=51150002.  Arial Unicode MS is available with Microsoft Office, FrontPage and Publisher, with the installation of international support.  Devanagari MT is available with Mac systems with the Asian languages support.  Mangal is available with Windows systems with supplemental language support.

The comparison showed that the Shobhika fonts (Regular and Bold) are able to produce all conjuncts correctly, without the interruption of an inappropriate vir?ma, with the exception of two ?ty and ???h.  Siddhanta excepts just four: ?k??v, ?khn, ddbr, l?l.  Chandas and Uttara are able to form all conjuncts correctly with the exception of seven sequences: ?k??v, ?rvy, ?hthy, d??, ddbr, ddvr, l?l.  The LaTeX Skt package handles all but 29.  Sanskrit 2003 lacked 82, Sanskrit 2020 lacks 81, Praja 187, Arial Unicode MS 202, Devanagari MT 232, and Mangal 236.

I also checked the behavior of the fonts in handling the accents in the Devanagari extended, and Vedic extensions Unicode pages.  Only Praja font handled them all properly, the LaTeX Skt package handles most Vedic accentuation, Sanskrit 2020 handles all but the Maitr?ya?? Sa?hit? midstroke.  Shobhika handles all but this and the Samaveda accents.  Most fonts handled only the common accentual system.  A test of Vedic accents with any font can be performed by visiting the Sanskrit Library's interactive Vedic Unicode character phonetic value table at http://sanskritlibrary.org/accents.html.  Simply set your browser to use the font you would like to test.

The first eight fonts listed, i.e. Shobhika, Siddhanta, Chandas, Uttara, LaTeX Skt, Sanskrit 2003 and 2020, and Praja, are therefore commendable; the last three are inadequate for Sanskrit.  Mihail Bayaryn's fonts use private code points to handle accents.  It would be desirable for him to upgrade his fonts, which otherwise handle conjuncts very comprehensively, to handle the Vedic characters in the two Unicode pages mentioned including in particular the combining candrabindu with semivowels l, y, and v.

Other Indic fonts not tested are described on the University of Chicago's South Asia Language Resource Center page at http://salrc.uchicago.edu/resources/fonts/available/hindi/.

Yours,
Peter

different from the one translated by Shastri (Guwahati edition), could
confirm that Vashistha calls Naraka "Tathagata".

Dear Indologists,

 

In discussing the name Ananta?iva? for a priest mentioned in an inscription, T. V. Mahalingam considers him to be a P??upata based on the name per se. But along with Ananta?iva?, two other priests are also mentioned as worshipping in the same temple. They are Tatta?iva? and Dharmakka??a?. Is Mahalingam right? 

 

Thank you in advance for any comments.

Palaniappan

Dear Palaniappan,

These sound more like initiatory names of the ?aiva Mantram?rga, particularly if we may assume ka??a? in this place to stand for ga?a (see the entry for ga?a on p. 274 of volume 2 of the T?ntrik?bhidh?nako?a).  P??upata names more commonly end in r??i or begin with either Bh?- or Bh?va-.

Could you tell us in which inscription these names occur ?

With best wishes,
Dominic

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Professorship in Modern Indology at LMU Munich : Call
 for applications
Message-ID: <2EE3720D-314B-473F-8AEA-3B08BA07A8E6@lmu.de>

Dear Colleagues, 

I am pleased to inform you that the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich has just posted a call for applications to a Professorship in Modern Indology on its job portal. Please find below the relevant links to the call in English and German:

https://job-portal.lmu.de/jobposting/f9e06a318366b2c6473a1fa34944619da115864e0?ref=homepage

https://job-portal.lmu.de/jobposting/c8b1523f11203f1f67133d02374a904bbe2283a40?ref=homepage 


This is a W2-professorship with tenure track. The professorship in Modern Indology, held until September by our colleague Robert Zydenbos, is one of the three professorships at the Institute for Indology and Tibetology, alongside that of Classical Indology and that of Tibetan and Buddhist Studies. As you will see in the job description (also enclosed as PDF), the call is very broad, the focus being on the intellectual, cultural, and/or social history of Early Modern and Modern South Asia. The knowledge of Indian languages is required, but no specific language, literature, or area of expertise will be privileged a priori. Finally, note that early-career academics are very welcome to apply. 

I would be grateful if you could kindly bring this call for applications to the attention of suitable candidates. This especially since the deadline to apply is 17 August, which will likely fall during the summer holidays of many colleagues. 

With kind regards, 

Vincent Tournier

(Given the lists contained Arial Unicode MS and Mangal, I don?t think general availability of the fonts was an issue.)

For those interested on the usage restriction of fonts shipping with Windows, you might find https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/font-faq helpful. Notably, you are allowed to produce PDFs or even share original documents with fonts embedded in a way that respects the font embedding rights. Sanskrit Text is set to allow editable embedding (you can check that in the font file properties > Details > Font embeddability), so the receiving party can edit the document using this font. So while Dominik is correct that you should have a licensed copy of Windows to create documents using these fonts, I feel that ?cannot be used? might be slightly misleading wording.

Either way, the same font designers produced Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit, which is open source and available at https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tiro+Devanagari+Sanskrit/. The project also includes fonts for Bangla, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Tamil and Telugu: https://github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo.

The Tiro fonts are super, and I hadn't paid attention to them before.
Thanks!  They are licensed under the Open Font License
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_Open_Font_License>, so anyone can
download, distribute and use them for any purpose.

The Microsoft fonts, including Arial Unicode, have always been covered by a
completely restrictive commercial license.  The font files (TTF, OTF) may
not be downloaded or distributed.  The fonts are licensed as integral parts
of the Windows OS and may be used only in that environment only by people
who have paid for a Windows license.  Most people, including major
publishers, think that Arial Unicode is a free font.  It's not.   Yes, a
PDF with some characters embedded in it can be shared, but not the font
itself.
Best,
Dominik

Dear everyone,
A few years back I had some discussions with John Hudson of Tiro fonts
about their sanskrit font (some issues with vedic accents) and at that time
I asked him about licensing and use of their sanskrit font.  Here is what I
asked and what he answered.
*. . .*
Would you be able to clarify the following points about the Sanskrit Text
font licence.
1) Are you permitted to publish books that use the Sanskrit Text font?
2) Are you permitted to use the Sanskrit Text font with non-Microsoft
publishing software such as: QuarkXpress or Adobe Indesign etc.?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear Harry,
Yes and yes, so long as you have a valid license for the software with
which the Sanskrit Text font is bundled (Windows or Office).

Many thanks for the reference - this is an important journal. However, the last volume 18 (1888) is missing from the Bodleian set.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Old 1990s Surekh CDAC pre-Unicode fonts / transcoding of
 CDAC pre-Unicode text to Unicode
Message-ID: <ME4P282MB13846A14A24F64A21052C1218B02A@ME4P282MB1384.AUSP282.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear Friends,

I am looking for 3 old pre-Unicode fonts that were made by CDAC in the 1990s:

SD-TTSurekh-Normal (there are a few versions of this circulating on the web but none seem to work as expected)
SD1-TTSurekhBold, Italic
SD1-TTSurekhNormal,Italic

In case anyone has these fonts please could you share or point me towards them.

Secondarily if anyone has a transcoding table for the CDAC Devanagari and IAST fonts to Unicode this would be most useful.

With kindest wishes,

Martin

Admittedly NOT on archive.org, however, the Jain elibrary 

https://jainelibrary.org/ 

(free registration required for full access)

has scanned and uploaded around 800 manuscripts (seemingly exclusively Jain texts) (findable in the category on the left of the site) as well as the 16,899 ?books? on the site and 6,000+ ?articles?

There's also a nice collection of Sanskrit mss. from Cambridge U. :
https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/sanskrit/1

The Gallica database of the Bibliotheque nationale de France also includes scans of many Skt. and other Indic mss., but I haven't found an easy way to globally search Skt. alone. Here's the general site:
https://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/en/content/accueil-en?mode=desktop

And, if anyone cares to look up the details and post them, the Endangered Archives programme of the British Library (https://eap.bl.uk/) has scanned quite a lot of Pali and probably some Sanskrit as well (not to mention Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.).

The Buddhist Digital Archives (https://library.bdrc.io/), though specializing in Tibetan, has recently branched out to include Pali, Sanskrit, and SE Asian languages, though I am not yet clear about what part of these additions are redirects to other databases.

Tim, Harry,

Just a note: in the "Buddhist Digital Resource Center Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation?, close to 2,000 manuscripts are mis-labeled as ?Tibetan? whereas they are clearly Pali.

https://archive.org/details/bdrc-fplmanuscripts?tab=collection&and%5B%5D=language%3A%22Tibetan%22

Just something to be aware of when searching by language.

Best,

Paul

Deepest thanks to everyone who has sent me further links for the list of
"Online Libraries of Scanned Manuscripts" at INDOLOGY.info.  I'm using a
cheap-and-cheerful plugin for Wordpress that doesn't allow manual
rearrangement of the list items.  So it's a bit of a grab-bag.

Best,
Dominik

Greetings,

   The  Lalcand Research Library (originally in L?hore) of D.A.V. College,
Chandigarh has a large collection, some of which was previously available
on archive.org.  The manuscripts that I downloaded a few years back came
with a full roman transcription as well as translations. Current web site:
https://www.davchd.ac.in/lcrl

    A MS from the Asiatic Society of Mumbai was also available on
archive.org some years back, but it too has disappeared from there and
(likely) been integrated into their new site at:

https://www.asiaticsociety.org.in/index.php/holdings/manuscripts

This site requires registration and the payment of a fee as an annual
subscription.

   One note about the Penn collection: it is integrated into the worldcat
site, so a search for a book will also bring up notices of the Penn
collection, plus links that bring you directly to the digitized images.

Best wishes,

Tim Cahill

Thanks for this Tim.  Links to the resources you mention are already there
in the listing at http://indology.info/external-resources, afaik.  The way
information is presented is far from clear: I'm trying to get an upgrade to
the Wordpress plugin, in the hope of improving presentation.

About the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, some of their MSS could be found at
archive.org by searching in Devanagari, but I think they have been taken
down.

Best,
Dominik

I appreciate everyone?s input on manuscript collections.

Perhaps I overlooked it?s notice by others, but this rather idiosyncratic collection came to my attention some time ago: http://indianmanuscripts.com/

It bills itself as the largest collection of Indian manuscripts and antique books. There are some valuable items, but the romanization is via the North Indian/Hindi pronunciation one sometimes finds in Archive.org as well. Consequently, items are a bit challenging to spot from time to time.

Best wishes,
Ron

About the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, some of their MSS could be found at archive.org<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/archive.org__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSuTMMfsO$> by searching in Devanagari, but I think they have been taken down.

Greetings,
   The  Lalcand Research Library (originally in L?hore) of D.A.V.

The manuscripts that I downloaded a few years back came with a full roman transcription as well as translations.

    A MS from the Asiatic Society of Mumbai was also available on archive.org<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/archive.org__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSuTMMfsO$> some years back, but it too has disappeared from there and (likely) been integrated into their new site at:

This site requires registration and the payment of a fee as an annual subscription.
   One note about the Penn collection: it is integrated into the worldcat site, so a search for a book will also bring up notices of the Penn collection, plus links that bring you directly to the digitized images.
Best wishes,

It's hard to find out about this site.  But a few years ago, I wrote to the
person who seemed to be behind it in these terms:

Dear Mr Madan Mohan Gupta,

Yesterday, by chance, I discovered your website indianmanuscripts.com.  I
am very impressed by what you have done at this website.  You have provided
many important manuscripts and books for scholarly study.  It is such
ancient works upon which scholarship depends.  These are the life-blood of
intellectual work about India.

I want to thank you and your colleagues for making these wonderful
resources available to the public.

I have made a link to your website from indology.info
<http://indology.info/links/img/>; I hope this is acceptable to you.  If
not, or if you would like the link differently expressed, please just let
me know.

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk

PS,
I put what I knew about this collection in 2018 into PanditProject:

   - https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108617/collection

Also, at least some of the indianmanuscripts.com manuscripts are now
appearing through the NAMAMI database and being identified as located in
the Jawaharlal Nehru Library in Kurukshetra.  E.g., compare these

   - https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript
   and
   - https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113846/manuscript

Jonathan Silk brought up an important point about on-line manuscripts when
he showed how spelling affects whether an online manuscript is found or
not. Of course his example "Bauddha Gamartha Samgraha" showed how a title
prevented finding a manuscript.  But those of us who work in putting
manuscripts on-line do so, not just so they'll be found by members of lists
we make announcements to, but hopefully that they may be found many years
in the future, so to me the question is how do we title on-line manuscripts
and what metadata do we associate with them so they will be found in
searchs (perhaps decades in the future)..

For example picking a manuscript title at random *a??umatk??yap?gama* .
Should the title be the exact title in IAST i.e*. **a??umatk??yap?gama.txt*
Should the title be the exact title but without diacriticals i.e*. *
*amsumatkasyapagama.txt*
Does header data within the text file and written at its beginning such as
exact title or alternate title affect whether it is found in searchs?
Should the file have metadata? I.e. should the text file have an html or
xml wrapper with metadata of its title in HK, Velthuis, devanagari? And in
this case its alternate title a??umad?gama .?
Are there other ways that will help the etext to be found even if the
search itself is mispelled?

Note: I'm asking these questions not in the context of "best manuscript
transcription practices" but just in what will help an etext be found in
google searchs. Does Google even say anything about how to maximize this?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Jonathan Silk brought up an important point about on-line manuscripts when
he showed how spelling affects whether an online manuscript is found or
not. Of course his example "Bauddha Gamartha Samgraha" showed how a title
prevented finding a manuscript.  But those of us who work in putting
manuscripts on-line do so, not just so they'll be found by members of lists
we make announcements to, but hopefully that they may be found many years
in the future, so to me the question is how do we title on-line manuscripts
and what metadata do we associate with them so they will be found in
searchs (perhaps decades in the future)..

For example picking a manuscript title at random *a??umatk??yap?gama* .
Should the file name be the exact title in IAST i.e*. *
*a??umatk??yap?gama.txt*
Should the file name be the exact title but without diacriticals i.e*. *
*amsumatkasyapagama.txt*
Does header data within the text file and written at its beginning such as
exact title or alternate title affect whether it is found in searchs?
Should the file have metadata? I.e. should the text file have an html or
xml wrapper with metadata of its title in HK, Velthuis, devanagari? And in
this case its alternate title a??umad?gama .?
Are there other ways that will help the etext to be found even if the
search itself is mispelled?

Note: I'm asking these questions not in the context of "best manuscript
transcription practices" but just in what will help an etext be found in
google searchs. Does Google even say anything about how to maximize this?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

There is a lot of catalogues and search interfaces produced by different people with different levels of training in different disciplines, over a long time of development of software capabilities. Some will be better, some will be worse. And different libraries will choose different transliteration rules.

MARC models: https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdmulti.html
BIBFRAME notes: https://guides.loc.gov/bibframe-manual/non-latin-scripts

The same way search can be made case insensitive, it can be made accent insensitive, making your two propositions discoverable either way:

[cid:image002.png at 01D9C207.27405F30] [cid:image003.png at 01D9C207.27405F30]

Both Google and Bing seem to be happy to ignore some diacritics but not others (in the example above, they do not have any results for the ASCII version). This evolves and changes with time.

As for being able to find misspelled entries, it again depends on the catalogue and its search engine. Putting aside recent models you can train with data of your choice, there is an old deterministic algorithm called SOUNDEX<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex>, which would match ?budha? with ?bauddha? (however not ?buddhist?). Both SQL and MySQL have SOUNDEX function built in. These databases can also perform accent insensitive search (and you do not need to change the database schema in order to do so).

People who put manuscripts on-line are therefore limited by the capabilities of the interfaces they will be indexed and accessed through, and which often conflict with each other. I would suggest the best practice is to include the text in the original script if possible and specify the script (ISO 15924<https://www.unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html>) and the language (ISO 639<https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data>) separately in the metadata. This records all the necessary information that future search engines can utilize. If providing transliteration/transcription, be consistent with the rules and note which schema you are using. (And obviously use Unicode.)

Subject: [INDOLOGY] CORRECTION: Important point about online manuscripts

Jonathan Silk brought up an important point about on-line manuscripts when he showed how spelling affects whether an online manuscript is found or not. Of course his example "Bauddha Gamartha Samgraha" showed how a title prevented finding a manuscript.  But those of us who work in putting manuscripts on-line do so, not just so they'll be found by members of lists we make announcements to, but hopefully that they may be found many years in the future, so to me the question is how do we title on-line manuscripts and what metadata do we associate with them so they will be found in searchs (perhaps decades in the future)..

For example picking a manuscript title at random a??umatk??yap?gama .
Should the file name be the exact title in IAST i.e. a??umatk??yap?gama.txt
Should the file name be the exact title but without diacriticals i.e. amsumatkasyapagama.txt
Does header data within the text file and written at its beginning such as exact title or alternate title affect whether it is found in searchs?
Should the file have metadata? I.e. should the text file have an html or xml wrapper with metadata of its title in HK, Velthuis, devanagari? And in this case its alternate title a??umad?gama .?
Are there other ways that will help the etext to be found even if the search itself is mispelled?

Note: I'm asking these questions not in the context of "best manuscript transcription practices" but just in what will help an etext be found in google searchs. Does Google even say anything about how to maximize this?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

I appreciate everyone?s input on manuscript collections.

Perhaps I overlooked it?s notice by others, but this rather idiosyncratic collection came to my attention some time ago: http://indianmanuscripts.com/

It bills itself as the largest collection of Indian manuscripts and antique books. There are some valuable items, but the romanization is via the North Indian/Hindi pronunciation one sometimes finds in Archive.org as well. Consequently, items are a bit challenging to spot from time to time.

Best wishes,
Ron

    A MS from the Asiatic Society of Mumbai was also available on archive.org<http://archive.org><https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/archive.org__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSuTMMfsO$> some years back, but it too has disappeared from there and (likely) been integrated into their new site at:
https://www.asiaticsociety.org.in/index.php/holdings/manuscripts<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.asiaticsociety.org.in/index.php/holdings/manuscripts__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSvyP8Ipm$>
This site requires registration and the payment of a fee as an annual subscription.
   One note about the Penn collection: it is integrated into the worldcat site, so a search for a book will also bring up notices of the Penn collection, plus links that bring you directly to the digitized images.
Best wishes,
Tim Cahill

Deepest thanks to everyone who has sent me further links for the list of "Online Libraries of Scanned Manuscripts" at INDOLOGY.info.  I'm using a cheap-and-cheerful plugin for Wordpress that doesn't allow manual rearrangement of the list items.  So it's a bit of a grab-bag.

There's also a nice collection of Sanskrit mss. from Cambridge U. :

The Gallica database of the Bibliotheque nationale de France also includes scans of many Skt. and other Indic mss., but I haven't found an easy way to globally search Skt. alone. Here's the general site:

And, if anyone cares to look up the details and post them, the Endangered Archives programme of the British Library (https://eap.bl.uk/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/eap.bl.uk/__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSl4EoJt9$>) has scanned quite a lot of Pali and probably some Sanskrit as well (not to mention Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.).

The Buddhist Digital Archives (https://library.bdrc.io/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/library.bdrc.io/__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSnNHHHR3$>), though specializing in Tibetan, has recently branched out to include Pali, Sanskrit, and SE Asian languages, though I am not yet clear about what part of these additions are redirects to other databases.

An *ngram index* would also help.

For instance, by using such an index for a corpus with misspelled words,
which are transliterations from Sanskrit and other languages, for searching
for *tattva*, among other results one can see: *tattva?, tattvaj, tattvam*,
*tattvas*, *?tmatattvam*, *?tmatattvam?*, *?tadbh?vatattvam*,
*?r?tattvanidhi*, *?ivatattvaratn?kara*.

The ngram index uses a similarity threshold, which can be used to filter
out the results that are too different.

For the case you mentioned, I think that, by using an ngram index,
searching for *buddha* would surely return *budha, bauddha*, and even
*buddhist*, depending of the similarity threshold.

Matthew Kapstein sent this enquiry about the WZKS almost two years ago, but
it does not seem to have had a reply.
I'm sure many of us would like to access early numbers of this journal.
Does anyone know if there has been any progress in making them available?
With thanks,
Oliver

Dear colleagues,

Thank you for your interest.

I had responded to Matthew immediately after he had sent his inquiry.

Here is a slightly abbreviated version of my reply to him back then.

***

The pre-1991 volumes are not available in scanned form. Even though in 
2013 I spent a lot of (eventually wasted) time on this matter, together 
with the legal department of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (inasmuch 
as its publishing house is functioning as publisher since 1991), the 
Academy finally withdrew from the project of making the earlier volumes 
available on JSTOR because of 1) the demand of an inordinate amount of 
money by the still-extant successor of the Vienna publishing house 
Hollinek that had published the earliest volumes (and, of course, long 
forgotten about this until the inquiry came), and 2) their reluctance to 
get into complicated negotations with Brill which was subsequently 
acting as international "publisher on commission" until the Academy 
publishing house took over in 1991, together with Vienna-based Gerold, 
the second "publisher on commission", which is, however, definitely 
defunct.

To my knowledge, Brill never responded to the inquiry by the Academy. 
The former Department of Indology (succeeded by the Department of South 
Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies) of the University of Vienna was the 
main copyrighted publisher back then, but my (or the University's) 
consent would not have been sufficient from the legal point of view to 
provided scanned versions of the volumes before 1991. Even though no 
online publications existed at the time the contracts were drawn up with 
Hollinek and Brill, the agreed-upon rights for analogue publication (in 
the latter case: the international dissemination of printed copies on 
commission) would automatically apply to any future, different types of 
publication.

In the end, the Academy decided that they would not pursue the matter 
further as the volumes were not published by them in the first place and 
because it did not see much of a benefit for itself if these volumes 
were available on JSTOR at their cost. The task of negotiating with 
Hollinek and Brill would be up to JSTOR whose request had actually 
started our deliberations. This was communicated to JSTOR, but I have 
not heard from them again.

However, almost all back-issues of the Journal are still available in 
perfect condition for sale by the Department; please refer to 
https://stb.univie.ac.at/publikationsreihen/wiener-zeitschrift-fuer-die-kunde-suedasiens-wzks/bestellung/ 
or 
https://stb.univie.ac.at/en/publication-series/vienna-journal-of-south-asian-studies-wzks/order/.

I would be delighted to arrange for these volumes to be sent to you or 
your library.

With best regards,

Karin Preisendanz

Dear Friends,

As a footnote, and perhaps a slim chance of creating a window (??), I
recall very clearly discussions I had quite some time ago with Prof Saito
Akira about the *Japanese Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies* (IBK).
The reasoning in the beginning was that the copyright for all articles in
the journal rested with the authors, and therefore it would not be possible
to place on line those contributions for which permission could not be
obtained. This of course would be impossible, all the more so as
contributors to the earlier volumes were in many cases no longer among us.

I do not know how they resolved the question, but not so many years after
our conversation (I don't recall how long it took) everything appeared
online, and in a wonderful fashion, quite unlike --still a scandal I
think-- what one sees from France with the *Journal Asiatique*, for
instance, which is often  virtually illegible.

Also by the way, the IBK scans are linked to the inbuds.net database, which
while not perfect is searchable in many ways, and is a genuinely great
beginning to not only making bibliography available but linking it to
scans, in some cases-- along with the CiNii database  (
https://cir.nii.ac.jp/), this is a more than good model for making such
material accessible, since unlike jstor etc the inbuds database also has
keywords and the like.

Anyway, with regard to the French situation, perhaps Matthew could motivate
some of his contacts in Paris to bring to bear modern technology on that
currently difficult matter. Reading scans from Gallica sometimes evokes
nightmares of trying to read the old b/w microfilms of the Narthang
Kanjur...

best,
Jonathan

Dear Professor Silk,

Apropos the Journal Asiatique, I've had great success contacting the
Soci?t? directly to provide high quality scans of articles. The contact
email I have used on file (contact at societe-asiatique.fr
<contact at societe-asiatique.fr>) has worked well.

With regard to the pre-1991 WZKS volumes, I believe that it's likely the
case legally that unless copyright was specifically assigned to the authors
then it would be presumed to reside with the publishers up to 60 years
after the death of the author. The question is, would the publishers (or
their legal successors) enforce copyright if scans of the out of print
volumes appeared in the public space?

Regardless, it's wonderful to know that most of the old volumes are still
available from the STB at the UW at such affordable prices! Thank you very
much Prof Preisendanz!!!

Kind regards,
Antonio

I should perhaps have said that I am very fortunate in that Leiden
University is a designated repository for the Humanities (unlike other
universities in the Netherlands, which must be content with electronic
resources), and thus (in principle, at least) we hold paper copies of
things like JA, so when I need to read something, I can go to the library.
So the Soci?t?'s service is not necessary here, but as a broader question:
why post scans online if they are illegible?

It seems that the Lal Bahadur Shastri Sanskrit University (https://www.slbsrsv.ac.in/ ) mss. collection on Archiv was not mentioned (note that there are a few Oriya palm-leaf mss. there):

https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Lal+Bahadur+Shastri+Sanskrit+University%22

Also a mini-collection of (3) Sharada mss. provided by "Puneet Jyotishi Jammu"

https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Received+Through+Puneet+Jyotishi+Jammu%22

By the way, does the Sanskrit (paper - devanagari) mss. collection provided by "I am visionary Tunes", listed by Dominik, correspond to a private or institutional one (and which one in one or the other case)? See

PS,
I put what I knew about this collection in 2018 into PanditProject:

  *   https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108617/collection

Also, at least some of the indianmanuscripts.com<http://indianmanuscripts.com/> manuscripts are now appearing through the NAMAMI database and being identified as located in the Jawaharlal Nehru Library in Kurukshetra.  E.g., compare these

  *   https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript
and

It's hard to find out about this site.  But a few years ago, I wrote to the person who seemed to be behind it in these terms:

Dear Mr Madan Mohan Gupta,

Yesterday, by chance, I discovered your website indianmanuscripts.com<http://indianmanuscripts.com/>.  I am very impressed by what you have done at this website.  You have provided many important manuscripts and books for scholarly study.  It is such ancient works upon which scholarship depends.  These are the life-blood of intellectual work about India.

I want to thank you and your colleagues for making these wonderful resources available to the public.

I have made a link to your website from indology.info<http://indology.info/links/img/>; I hope this is acceptable to you.  If not, or if you would like the link differently expressed, please just let me know.

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk

I appreciate everyone?s input on manuscript collections.

Perhaps I overlooked it?s notice by others, but this rather idiosyncratic collection came to my attention some time ago: http://indianmanuscripts.com/

It bills itself as the largest collection of Indian manuscripts and antique books. There are some valuable items, but the romanization is via the North Indian/Hindi pronunciation one sometimes finds in Archive.org as well. Consequently, items are a bit challenging to spot from time to time.

Best wishes,
Ron

This site requires registration and the payment of a fee as an annual subscription.
   One note about the Penn collection: it is integrated into the worldcat site, so a search for a book will also bring up notices of the Penn collection, plus links that bring you directly to the digitized images.

There's also a nice collection of Sanskrit mss. from Cambridge U. :

The Gallica database of the Bibliotheque nationale de France also includes scans of many Skt. and other Indic mss., but I haven't found an easy way to globally search Skt. alone. Here's the general site:
https://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/en/content/accueil-en?mode=desktop<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/en/content/accueil-en?mode=desktop__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSoB8mRef$>

And, if anyone cares to look up the details and post them, the Endangered Archives programme of the British Library (https://eap.bl.uk/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/eap.bl.uk/__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSl4EoJt9$>) has scanned quite a lot of Pali and probably some Sanskrit as well (not to mention Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.).

The Buddhist Digital Archives (https://library.bdrc.io/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/library.bdrc.io/__;!!KIFmrYtlezdzESbnm_I!G8N2kAYTlbp44IXQeE_dWSczSMHlu4_dQk7xroKmRRFSNT8rZx8uf2raVorV_Sk8cyA49ulYrhFwovqCowh-Ze5CSnNHHHR3$>), though specializing in Tibetan, has recently branched out to include Pali, Sanskrit, and SE Asian languages, though I am not yet clear about what part of these additions are redirects to other databases.

To clarify:
I have no association with the Journal Asiatique and am not therefore able to assist as Jonathan requests.

My own experience as a user of Gallica, from the Biblioth?que nationale de France, has been entirely positive for the materials that have concerned me.

Dear all,

JA recently gave permission to a PhD student of mine to put an article that he published with them in 2020 in Open access onto the French archiving system HAL.
It?s always worth asking ;-)

Best,

Objet : Re: [INDOLOGY] Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?dasiens

Dear Professor Silk,

Apropos the Journal Asiatique, I've had great success contacting the Soci?t? directly to provide high quality scans of articles. The contact email I have used on file (contact at societe-asiatique.fr<mailto:contact at societe-asiatique.fr>) has worked well.

With regard to the pre-1991 WZKS volumes, I believe that it's likely the case legally that unless copyright was specifically assigned to the authors then it would be presumed to reside with the publishers up to 60 years after the death of the author. The question is, would the publishers (or their legal successors) enforce copyright if scans of the out of print volumes appeared in the public space?

Regardless, it's wonderful to know that most of the old volumes are still available from the STB at the UW at such affordable prices! Thank you very much Prof Preisendanz!!!

Kind regards,
Antonio

Dear colleagues,

Thank you for your interest.

I had responded to Matthew immediately after he had sent his inquiry.

Here is a slightly abbreviated version of my reply to him back then.

***

The pre-1991 volumes are not available in scanned form. Even though in
2013 I spent a lot of (eventually wasted) time on this matter, together
with the legal department of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (inasmuch
as its publishing house is functioning as publisher since 1991), the
Academy finally withdrew from the project of making the earlier volumes
available on JSTOR because of 1) the demand of an inordinate amount of
money by the still-extant successor of the Vienna publishing house
Hollinek that had published the earliest volumes (and, of course, long
forgotten about this until the inquiry came), and 2) their reluctance to
get into complicated negotations with Brill which was subsequently
acting as international "publisher on commission" until the Academy
publishing house took over in 1991, together with Vienna-based Gerold,
the second "publisher on commission", which is, however, definitely
defunct.

To my knowledge, Brill never responded to the inquiry by the Academy.
The former Department of Indology (succeeded by the Department of South
Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies) of the University of Vienna was the
main copyrighted publisher back then, but my (or the University's)
consent would not have been sufficient from the legal point of view to
provided scanned versions of the volumes before 1991. Even though no
online publications existed at the time the contracts were drawn up with
Hollinek and Brill, the agreed-upon rights for analogue publication (in
the latter case: the international dissemination of printed copies on
commission) would automatically apply to any future, different types of
publication.

In the end, the Academy decided that they would not pursue the matter
further as the volumes were not published by them in the first place and
because it did not see much of a benefit for itself if these volumes
were available on JSTOR at their cost. The task of negotiating with
Hollinek and Brill would be up to JSTOR whose request had actually
started our deliberations. This was communicated to JSTOR, but I have
not heard from them again.

However, almost all back-issues of the Journal are still available in
perfect condition for sale by the Department; please refer to

I would be delighted to arrange for these volumes to be sent to you or

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Professor Kavita Singh, 1964-2023
Message-ID: <CAHxuC0RE_d-N4DkZ2y9xbh1sLsKhZazZY1zdbzFDRccpLqUd+A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues in Indology,

Yesterday we lost a friend and fellow scholar, art historian Professor
Kavita Singh, to cancer. She was 58, and in the process of moving from the
Jawaharlal Nehru University to Ashoka University when she was diagnosed
last year.

She was renowned for her work on Mughal, Rajput, Pahari and Deccani
painting, as well as on museum studies.

She was an Infosys laureate (2018), an elected member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences (2020), appointed to the Board of Trustees of
the Getty Institutions (2020-24), and had been appointed the Slade
Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge University this year (2022-2023), an
assignment she was unable to take up on account of her illness. (She did
deliver the Slade Lecture in Fine Art online in April 2023).

Kavita had just completed her curation of a forthcoming show about a rare
illuminated Ramcaritmanas from the royal court in 19th c Kashi. The
exhibition, co-curated with Dr. Singh's former student Parul Singh, is
scheduled to go up in September 2023 at the new Museum of Art and
Photography in Bangalore. She delivered an extensive illustrated lecture in
person as a curtain-raiser for this show at the India Habitat Center in New
Delhi on July 15, 2023 (a fortnight before her passing).

I know that many of you knew her personally and were interested in and
inspired by her work. Here is an extensive tribute by her colleague Shukla
Sawant from the School of Arts and Aesthetics, JNU:

https://thewire.in/the-arts/kavita-singhs-inspiring-research-and-memories-of-her-unwavering-kindness-will-live-on

Her untimely death is shattering for her family and friends, but also an
irreparable loss for the field of art history and art historical pedagogy
in India, and for academic life, especially at beleaguered Indian public
institutions, at this time.

Sincerely,

Ananya Vajpeyi.

*From the First Circular: *
Scholarly engagement with the Madhyamaka tradition has greatly intensified
in recent decades, in part due to the discovery of Sanskrit manuscripts of
seminal Indian Madhyamaka works as well as of previously unavailable
Tibetan scholastic treatises that chart the reception of pertinent Indian
Buddhist doctrines. The flurry of publications resulting from philological
and philosophical investigation of the texts significantly improves our
comprehension of the views of the Madhyamaka authors, their
self-understanding, and the reasons behind their responses to their
intellectual environments. Nevertheless, many issues remain unsolved, and
topics as fundamental as the M?dhyamikas? final truth/reality continue to
be debated. The International Conference Madhyamaka in South Asia and
Beyond will bring together scholars to present and discuss their research
on all aspects of the Madhyamaka tradition from philological, historical
and/or philosophical perspectives. We invite papers dealing with topics
such as the school?s ontological views, its logical and epistemological
theories and their sources and integration, its soteriology,
historiography, evolution, and transmission, including interactions with
other Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools and traditions. Papers from the
broader intellectual landscape are also welcome.

Personally, I'm undecided.  In SARIT, we use the second method,
no-dicriticals in filenames.  But we have tons of accurate metadata inside
the file.

Yes.  Depending on the search, of course, but Google looks inside files,
for example.

YES!  I'm a true believer in accurate, comprehensive metadata.  This is the
file's Title Page or Library Index Card.  It should be as accurate and
comprehensive as possible.  If the data-input people are capable, it should
be structured as a TEI Header
<https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html>, since
that's the only meaningful standard format out there. (JSON would also do,
but isn't so human-readable.  JSON and TEI can be auto-converted in both
directions.)

Declaration of special interest:  I was the author of the first draft of
the TEI Header specification, back in the 90s.

Are there other ways that will help the etext to be found even if the

This is the job of the search engine, to implement fuzzy matching.  Or, as
Claudio Teodorescu taught me last week, Levenshtein Distance
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance> matching.

So my final opinion is to put effort into a good TEI header.  Second, make
the file name accurate, whether or not there are diacritical marks.

Best,
Dominik

Thank you, Christophe, as always, for the excellent new information.  I've
added the new entries.  They're not showing up: some glitch that I'll fix.

Just to clarify what I unfortunately may have said in a misleading way: i
find Gallica wonderful for its provision of excellent photos of the
Dunhuang manuscripts, for instance, as well as other things; i was speaking
only of the scans of some old journals, which are of below par quality, not
of Gallica overall.
