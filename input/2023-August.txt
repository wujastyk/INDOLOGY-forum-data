Dear colleagues,

Thank you for your responses and suggestions.

I will make an effort to find out with Hollinek whether they actually 
still have some copies of vols. 1-5 (which I doubt, or if any, doubt 
they will be able to find in their holdings), and with Brill for volumes 
12 to 14.

When I joined the ISTB in 1999, I was able to grab the last volumes of 3 
and 14 for myself. Tf Hollinek and Brill would reply in the negative, 
1-5 and 12-14 would indeed be out of print.

The copyright has always been with the publisher, not with the authors. 
Fortunately, the vast majority of them is still with us, and those who 
are not have not yet passed away for 60 years.

With best regards,

Karin Preisendanz

Subject: [INDOLOGY] a statement about respectable women
Message-ID: <CAOYD-QCYqd8ZaFXYiRnfqv+BJYA0_ddxc3LuWd_ByVTFKj8tuw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I encountered the following statement:
kul??gan? hi carama? ??yinya? prathama? prabodhinya? ca bhavanti
and it was marked with an iti.
(A variant wording has carama??yinya? pratham?vabodhinya? for carama?
??yinya? prathama? prabodhinya?.)
Unfortunately my grepping yielded no result, therefore if someone among you
happens to know the source for this sentence or has a hunch of the type of
source which could include a similar statement, I would be very grateful to
hear from you. (I am thinking that dharma??stra might be the right place to
search for it, but it would be nice to first narrow down the range of texts
to examine.)
Beside that and regardless whether the above really is a verbatim quote or
not, do any of you know more about the prescription/usage, in the ancient
Indian context, that women, if they are respectable, wake up first and go
to bed last?

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci

Dear list members,

In a private reply to my query I was made aware that in certain areas of
India, just a few decades ago, females, regardless of their age, were not
supposed to be seen sleeping by unrelated men.

This urges me to provide a specification with regard to the prescription I
mentioned in my first message.
I believe that the sentence I encountered is rather about being a good,
reliable housewife, namely one who rises before everyone else to make sure,
for instance, that breakfast is ready before others wake up, and who in the
evening attends to the needs of others (e.g. makes sure that the small
children of the household fall asleep, helps the elderly of the household
to their beds, etc.) before finally going to sleep.
This is, I believe, what that sentence hints at.

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci

Dear all,

Would any kind soul out there have access (in whatever form) to the 
following dissertation from the University of Chicago in 1971? 
Unfortunately, no library registered in any of the major German 
cooperating networks seems to have it.

Vesper, Don. 1971. Kurukh syntax with special reference to the verbal 
system. University of Chicago Ph.D.
dissertation.

Many thanks in advance!

Best,
John

In my exploration and transcription of medieval Dharma??stric texts, I have not encountered a saying such as this. But of course there are countless others I have not examined.

Dear Gaia and list members,

Iin the B?hatsa?hit? of Var?hamihira (78.8), (and reused in the Vet?lapa?cavi??ati of ?ivad?sa (3.16)), the opposite is given as an indication of a woman who has lost her passion - viraktace???:

?????????????????? ?????? ?????? 
????? ????? ? ??????? ??????? ? 
???????????? ???? ??????????? 
??????????????????? ??????????? ? ?? ?

a free translation: 

As soon as you touch her, or even look at her, her body shakes in fear, 
She?ll be prideful, and not stop you when you?re leaving. 
She?ll wipe her face after you?re done making out, 
She?ll fall asleep before you, and wake up later. 

hope that might be helpful in your analysis! 

all best wishes,
Adheesh

Dear John,

There is supposed to be a copy at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) Library. See the info below. (Call # 494.826 V63K1973)

I would assume that the University of Chicago Library has a copy, too.

I?m not sure whether you can get an inter-library loan from US libraries. If not, it might be necessary to get somebody to scan it (for a price, I would assume).

All the best,

Hans Henrich

Hi Gaia and list members,

You might be interested in checking out the fourth book of the K?mas?tra, titled ?bh?ry?dhik?rika or Wives.? The first chapter of this book discusses a wife?s lifestyle and her household duties. In particular:
pa?c?t sa?ve?ana? p?rvam utth?nam anavabodhana? ca suptasya [KS 4.1.17].
?she lies down after him, gets up before him, and never wakes him up when he is asleep? (Doniger and Kakar 2002: 95).
The following section talks about her conduct during her husband?s absence. Hope this helps. 

All best,
Shubham

Dear list members,

we are delighted to announce the following call for papers:

The Department for Culture and History of India and Tibet at Universit?t 
Hamburg and the provisional Yoga Studies Research Network (YSRN) 
cordially invite scholars and researchers to actively participate in the 
third international academic conference: "Yoga Dar?ana, Yoga S?dhana: 
'Introspection, Inspiration, Institutionalisation'" to be held in 
Hamburg from 22nd to 25th May 2024.
The Yoga Dar?ana, Yoga S?dhana (YDYS) conference series serves as a 
platform for the critical examination and dynamic discussion of recent 
advancements in the field of yoga studies. Following the success of the 
previous conferences in 2016 and 2022 (at Jagiellonian University in 
Krakow, Poland), this upcoming event promises to build upon those 
achievements.
We encourage submissions from scholars across various disciplines and 
backgrounds who are engaged in research related to yoga studies. Topics 
of interest for presentation at the conference include, but are not 
limited to:

-? Introspection: Exploring the historical, philosophical, 
psychological, and experiential aspects of yoga
-? Inspiration: Investigating the influences of yoga on artistic, 
literary, and cultural expressions from ancient to present day societies.
-? Institutionalisation: Examining the historical and structural 
dimensions of yoga traditions? social formations

Presentations may encompass theoretical analyses, empirical research, 
case studies, and interdisciplinary approaches to yoga studies. We 
particularly welcome innovative perspectives that shed new light on 
traditional and contemporary aspects of yoga research.

Please find all details of the conference and a link to the submission 
form here: https://yogaresearch.org/ydys2024/

Looking forward to welcoming you to Hamburg!

For the organizers:

Corinna May Lhoir

Dear List members,

I would like to know more about the so-called tuning paste, or the mud smeared on the membrane of a drum (Skt m?rjan?) or (in Ca?kam poetry) a lute (y??). What does it actually do, for instance, is it making the leather more supple?

Dear Gaia and list members,

I am not offering any evidence from the literature, rather would like to mention what I could observe and also was told within traditional communities in India that even if the male is a close relative, but not an inhabitant, as soon he enters the house, women disappear. Or if necessary in the case of a surprise visit, etc., they cover their whole head and of course their face with their pallu or dupatta. It was indicated to me indirectly that this behavior is used as a prevention to incest.

Dear all,

My PhD student Romain Mascagni has seen tuning paste applied in his 
fieldwork among the Baloch in Oman (see below).

He is sceptical that it serves to render the membrane more subtle, since 
at least the instruments that "his" Baloch are using have the things at 
the side (I've no idea what they are called) for that purpose.

Conversely, he thinks that it serves to modify the sound.

He hasn't seen a paste being applied to lute instruments.

If of interest, I can also ask others.

Best,
Agnes

Ch?re Agnes,

Si je comprends bien de quoi il est question (voir photo ci-joint), il 
s'agit d'appliquer une mati?re au centre d'une peau d'un tambour afin de 
travailler le timbre de l'instrument. Sans cela les peaux r?sonnent trop 
(il me semble que c'est pour cela qu'ils font ?a, mais il faudrait que 
je regarde dans mes notes pour ?tre s?r). Cela a peut-?tre aussi une 
incidence sur la rigidit? de la peau afin donner un son plus aigu? (mais 
ce qui est de toute fa?on possible en tendant la peau du tambour). Je ne 
savais pas que ?a se faisait pour des luth par contre (si on parle bien

    Dear List members,

    I would like to know more about the so-called tuning paste, or the
    mud smeared on the membrane of a drum (Skt /m?rjan?/) or (in Ca?kam
    poetry) a lute (/y??/). What does it actually do, for instance, is
    it making the leather more supple?

Dear List members,
I have received several reactions, among which one from Herman Tull, who in the seventies of the previous century learned to play the mr?da?ga in India and was also taught how to apply tuning paste the membrane. He was taught (I quote from his mail to me)

"to mix the rava with water to make a ball, and then apply (flattening out) to the drum head (it had to be just wet enough to stick to the drum head, but not so wet as to stick to the hand in striking the drum). Its purpose was  to change its tone, and really to deaden it (the left side of the mridangam), to give it that characteristic "thunk" sound."

"There is a permanent paste applied to the right side of the mrdangam. The paste is made of some sort of glue and iron filings.  This paste has been the subject of many studies, most famously that of the physicist and Nobel laureate C. V. Raman, in his 1934 essay, 'The Indian Musical Drums"".

"Its purpose is  to add timbre to the pitch and, in the case of the right side, to the several pitches that this drum can produce, due to its unique head construction, utilizing several layered skins, which is this drum's unique feature."

My question has come up in the context of a brief paper I am writing (as no. 10 in the series "Realia in Ca?kam Poetry") on the paka??ai flower. In this paper I have to deal with the word pacai, "paste". It refers to several kinds of paste, including fuller's earth and is smeared on various objects, including untreated, hairy hide (or leather) and the membrane of a lute. So I was curious to know what is was doing on the leather membrane of the lute (remove the hairs from the hide, as fuller's earth does?). I assume this use serves the same purpose as the paste smeared on the drum. Now I know.

With kind regards, Herman

Dear Herman (if I may),


About the paste used nowadays to produce varying membrane thickness in 
mrdangam : "Iron filings or manganese dust mixed with cooked rice 
provide the black-paste [sic] on the right head of the Mridangam." (P. 
Sambamoorthy; Laya Vadyas, New Delhi : All India Handicrafts Board, 
1959, p. 3).? I haven't heard it called /m?rjan?/ in this context -- of 
course, this doesn't mean it is not attested/./


What is alluded to in Naa.tyazaastra, ch 33 under /m?rjan//?/ could be 
something like the above, but that is not clear. Another possibility is 
something like this : "[i]n the drum Urumi, the milky juice of a plant 
is applied on the right head and rubbed. This head when stroked, gives 
that characteristic sound. In fact, Urumi is an onamatopoetic name." (P. 
Sambamoorthy, op. cit. p. 3).


Coming back to the mridangam, the effect of the paste at the center of 
Indian drums has been elucidated by C. Venkata Raman (Nobel Prize in 
Physics, 1930). He showed that :


"in the Indian musical drums we have a circular drum-head which is 
loaded and damped in such a manner that all the overtones above the 
ninth are suppressed and these nine are grouped in such a manner as to 
give a succession of five tones in harmonic sequence."


see


Scientific papers of C. V. Raman, volume 2, p. 464

(reprinted from "The Indian musical drums" Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. A1 
179-188 (1935)).


available at archive.org. This is why the sound of the mridangam 
markedly differs from that of a drum with a mere circular (uniform) 
membrane, as anybody can check.


The above volume of over six hundred pages contains C. Venkata Raman's 
contributions to acoustics. He was himself a competent violin player, 
and he analyzed, among other things, the workings of a variety of 
musical instruments. The papers relevant to Indian drums are articles 
42, 43, 45 and 46.


Many sections of these papers may be followed with little scientific 
background. For this reason, some of his arguments, that only require 
musical sense and experimenting with strokes, may be historically 
relevant in part, although that wasn't his focus of interest. He does 
not refrain from using modern physical concepts in his papers.


In ancient Tamil literature, there were also much bigger drums as long 
as a bed (this refers of course to how poet ??????????? nearly escaped 
death, see ????? 50). If these war drums looked like /timpani/, the 
relevant tuning may have been different.


The /timpani/ or kettledrums also admit of tuning -- see the beginning 
of the second movement of Beethoven's D minor symphony op.? 125 (the 
"choral" s.) for a familiar and remarkable example among many. However, 
modern timpani do not sound at all like the mridangam, apparently 
because only the first three frequencies are controlled in the former, 
as opposed to nine in the latter. "The three principal modes, under 
normal playing and tuning conditions, have frequencies nearly in the 
ratio of 4:3:2, thus giving timpani a musical pitch which is easily 
discernible." (CA Anderson and TD Rossing, /J Acoust Soc Am/ 66, S18 
(1979), Abstract). It appears that the loading here is provided by the 
large air mass enclosed in the drum, rather than by a paste.


At any rate, a variety of physical phenomena, some rather subtle, need 
to be taken into account to understand the effect of drum shape and 
tuning. Even if the physics had not been understood in ancient times, 
the musical implications of surface treatment were observed --? 
otherwise these treatments would not have been adopted in the first 
place. And it is apparent they are missed if one disregards the 
correlation between drum construction and the sounds it can produce -- 
they /are/ very difficult to guess indeed.


(Sir) CV Raman is better known for his work in Optics. He discovered 
what we now call the Raman effect. He explained why the blue color of 
the Mediterranean, or of ice in glaciers, are different from the blue 
color of the sky. Recall that it is Lord Rayleigh that had explained why 
the sky is blue even though the sun isn't.


I hope this helps somewhat,

Kind regards,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Revised Devanagari Font Comparison for rendering
 Sanskrit and Vedic
Message-ID: <01A3BE17-43D8-4979-BB8D-9B4DF2956B7A@gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

In 2016 (Friday, 17 June 2:28pm) I shared the results of a comparison of the ligature formation produced by several Devanagari fonts and the results of a revised comparison last month (Wednesday, 12 July 2023).  I just added Microsoft's Sanskrit Text font to the comparison and share the results of this comparison as well.  A PDF of the comparison is available on The Sanskrit Library's Publications page at https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html under the title Sanskrit characters: a comparison of 13 fonts and their coverage of conjuncts.  As previously, I compared 1260 ligatures formed by the LaTeX Skt package with seven Unicode fonts.  The ligatures compared were the combined set of all those listed by Ulrich Stiehl in his document, Conjunct Consonants in Sanskrit, Heidelberg, 21 April 2003, pp. 4--34, and those listed in the Skt package documentation Sanskrit for LaTeX2e, pp. 22--35.  The full list of fonts compared is as follows:

1. LaTeX Skt package
2. Chandas
3. Uttara
4. Siddhanta
5. Sanskrit2003
6. Sanskrit2020
7. Shobhika-Regular
8. Shobhika-Bold
9. Sanskrit Text
10. Praja
11. Arial Unicode MS
12. Devanagari MT
13. Mangal

The LaTeX Skt package comes with the TeXLive installation available at https://www.tug.org/texlive/.  The Chandas, Uttara, and Siddhanta fonts were produced by Mihail Bayaryn.  The first two are available at http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/; all three are linked to http://svayambhava.blogspot.com/p/siddhanta-devanagariunicode-open-type.html.  The Sanskrit2003 font was produced by Ulrich Stiehl and is available at http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Sanskrit/itranslator2003.htm, and the Sanskrit2020 font is an updated version of it that includes the VedicExtensions Unicode block to accommodate Vedic accents available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/advaita-sharada-font/files/Devanagari/.  These fonts are all available free of cost.  Praja was produced by Peter Freund and is available for $35 at https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=5115&PRODUCTID=51150002.  The Sanskrit Text font, developed by Basit Ali, comes with Microsoft Windows; it can be installed by clicking the link, "Download fonts for all languages," in the fonts menu, and adding a language that uses Devanagari script into the language settings.  Arial Unicode MS is available with Microsoft Office, FrontPage and Publisher, with the installation of international support.  Devanagari MT is available with Mac systems with the Asian languages support.  Mangal is available with Windows systems with supplemental language support.

The comparison showed that the Shobhika fonts (Regular and Bold) are able to produce all conjuncts correctly, without the interruption of an inappropriate vir?ma, with the exception of two: ?ty and ???h.  Siddhanta excepts just four: ?k??v, ?khn, ddbr, l?l.  Chandas and Uttara are able to form all conjuncts correctly with the exception of seven sequences: ?k??v, ?rvy, ?hthy, d??, ddbr, ddvr, l?l.  The LaTeX Skt package handles all but 29.  Sanskrit Text lacked 64, Sanskrit 2003 lacked 82, Sanskrit 2020 lacks 81, Praja 195, Arial Unicode MS 208, Mangal 244, and Devanagari MT 263.

I also checked the behavior of the fonts in handling the accents in the Devanagari extended, and Vedic extensions Unicode pages.  Only Sanskrit Text font and Praja font handled them all properly, the LaTeX Skt package handles most Vedic accentuation, Sanskrit 2020 handles all but the Maitr?ya?? Sa?hit? midstroke.  Shobhika handles all but this and the Samaveda accents.  Most fonts handled only the common accentual system.  A test of Vedic accents with any font can be performed by visiting the Sanskrit Library's interactive Vedic Unicode character phonetic value table at http://sanskritlibrary.org/accents.html.  Simply set your browser to use the font you would like to test.

The first ten fonts listed, i.e. Shobhika (regular and bold), Siddhanta, Chandas, Uttara, LaTeX Skt, Sanskrit Text, Sanskrit 2003 and 2020, and Praja, are therefore commendable; the last three are inadequate for Sanskrit.  Mihail Bayaryn's fonts use private code points to handle accents.  It would be desirable for him to upgrade his fonts, which otherwise handle conjuncts very comprehensively, to handle the Vedic characters in the two Unicode pages mentioned including in particular the combining candrabindu with semivowels l, y, and v.

Other Indic fonts not tested are described on the University of Chicago's South Asia Language Resource Center page at http://salrc.uchicago.edu/resources/fonts/available/hindi/.

Yours,
Peter

To Satyanad Kichenassamy?s wonderfully informative reply to this query, I only wish to add that some indologists who have experience in archeology, art history, or manuscriptology may have encountered the technique of chemical analysis known as Raman Spectroscopy and based on C V Raman?s work on optics. Quite the man for all seasons.

The following information was given to me in 2021 about the Tiro Sanskrit
text font. Its essentially an extended Murty Sanskrit font.
The Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit font adds some more conjunct
ligatures to the Murty set?based on our own researches and also Uli
Stiehl?s?and also support for Vedic characters. We received some
generous funding from Google that allows us to open source the Tiro
Indic fonts, so I am working on those release versions and also
extensive documentation about how the fonts work and were made.

Dear Professor Tieken,

I?m not familiar with any tuning paste applied to a lute (y?? ????). 

Here are my personal observations:

1. When I was learning to play the v??? (????; at 10+ years of age), my teacher Madurai Shanmuga Vadivu (the famous M.S. Subbulakshmi?s mother) showed me how to apply some sort of wax to my tender fingers (NOT to the strings) so they could move easily on the taut strings. 

2. When my brother was learning to play the drum (??????????), his teacher showed him how to apply ???? (choru/c??u, which was nothing but a tiny ball of cooked plain white rice from mom?s kitchen) to the drum-head. He had a special black stone (like a pumice stone which pedicurists use now) to rub the paste on the drum-head. 

3. Now, in the YouTube Culture, I see ?mridhangam' players applying some sort of powder to their drum-head. Perhaps the traditional rice-paste is not suitable now for the touring artists? 
	(I?ll try to ask someone about it and let you know if I get a response from him.) 


My guess is that this kind of paste, oil-based or grain-based, is not for ?tuning? but is needed to make the surface that produces the sound smooth, pliable, and taut as the case may be, so it?s easy on the fingers of the player who triggers the sound.

With apologies for my ignorance of musical technical terms, I say the following:

In a string instrument like violin or v???, there are little rings in the base of the instrument which you can move up and down the strings for tuning the instrument; no need for any paste-application. 

In a drum also, the edge is tapped with a black stone to tune the drum.

The paste, oil/grain-based, is applied only to the two entities ? the sound-producing entity and the sound-creating entity.

The 'paste' is like the ?user-interface? (UI) as is used in the new-world technology! ;-)

Regards, 
rajam

Dear Gaia and Indology List,
Concerning the statement that a wife should rise in the morning before her husband, etc., have a look at the book by Julia Leslie, The Perfect Wife: The Orthodox Hindu Woman according to the Str?dharmapaddhati of Tryambakayajvan (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 52.

There Leslie discusses the point under the rule that "a woman should rise before her husband does" (striy? bhart?prabodh?t p?rvam eva prabodhavyam). The author of that text, Tryambaka, attributes this rule to Y?j?avalkya.

Dear list members,

I encountered the following statement:
kul??gan? hi carama? ??yinya? prathama? prabodhinya? ca bhavanti
and it was marked with an iti.
(A variant wording has carama??yinya? pratham?vabodhinya? for carama? ??yinya? prathama? prabodhinya?.)
Unfortunately my grepping yielded no result, therefore if someone among you happens to know the source for this sentence or has a hunch of the type of source which could include a similar statement, I would be very grateful to hear from you. (I am thinking that dharma??stra might be the right place to search for it, but it would be nice to first narrow down the range of texts to examine.)
Beside that and regardless whether the above really is a verbatim quote or not, do any of you know more about the prescription/usage, in the ancient Indian context, that women, if they are respectable, wake up first and go to bed last?

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci

Dear List members

I would like to thank all those who replied to my message about the tuning paste:
Tarani Awasthi, Agnes Korn (and via her, Roman Mascagni), Satyanad Kichenassamy, Matthew Kapstein, V.S. Rajam, David Eric Silverberg (the y?? is indeed a harp), Madhav Deshpande and Herman Tull.
It remains astonishing how wide a field of expertises is available on the Indology List!
With kind regards

Dear Professor Tieken,

I?m not familiar with any tuning paste applied to a lute (y?? ????).

Here are my personal observations:

1. When I was learning to play the v??? (????; at 10+ years of age), my teacher Madurai Shanmuga Vadivu (the famous M.S. Subbulakshmi?s mother) showed me how to apply some sort of wax to my tender fingers (NOT to the strings) so they could move easily on the taut strings.

2. When my brother was learning to play the drum (??????????), his teacher showed him how to apply ???? (choru/c??u, which was nothing but a tiny ball of cooked plain white rice from mom?s kitchen) to the drum-head. He had a special black stone (like a pumice stone which pedicurists use now) to rub the paste on the drum-head.

3. Now, in the YouTube Culture, I see ?mridhangam' players applying some sort of powder to their drum-head. Perhaps the traditional rice-paste is not suitable now for the touring artists?
(I?ll try to ask someone about it and let you know if I get a response from him.)


My guess is that this kind of paste, oil-based or grain-based, is not for ?tuning? but is needed to make the surface that produces the sound smooth, pliable, and taut as the case may be, so it?s easy on the fingers of the player who triggers the sound.

With apologies for my ignorance of musical technical terms, I say the following:

In a string instrument like violin or v???, there are little rings in the base of the instrument which you can move up and down the strings for tuning the instrument; no need for any paste-application.

In a drum also, the edge is tapped with a black stone to tune the drum.

The paste, oil/grain-based, is applied only to the two entities ? the sound-producing entity and the sound-creating entity.

The 'paste' is like the ?user-interface? (UI) as is used in the new-world technology! ;-)

Regards,
rajam

I am not sure whether this is the same ny?ya as the one you cite, but Jacob?s ?A Third Handful of Popular Maxims? on p. 87 gives a simile: ?ibikodyacchannaravat, and cites Ny?yama?jar? p. 397, line 12, and 400 line 11 from bottom; as also ?lokav?rtika p. 529, verse 73.

Hello,
Apologies if it's already been mentioned--the Draupadi-Satyabhama 
samvada in the aranyakaparvan of the Mahabharata (III.222-224) captures 
in some detail the expectations of an ideal wife (first to rise, last to 
sleep, last to eat, doesn't stand about gossiping...).
Best,
Arti

Subject: [INDOLOGY] tuning paste
Message-ID: <CACcR+FC7xbfrWgX4r1oTsPVExOF2tRrdpNZ_O1WYmvD6OqRgAA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Prof Tieken,

Here are some references to the *m?rjana /anul?pana* of the Mr?da?ga and
other kindred drums.

1. A g?h? from the Sattasa? speaks of the coating of rice that makes the
timbre of the drum sweet. It appears that the Sanskrit verse  ?? ? ????
etc. is a later (pale) paraphrase of this one.

*a?l??o domuhao t? mahuro bhoa?a? muhe j?va* / HSS_253ab
*murao vva khalo ji??ammi bhoa?e virasam ?rasa? */ HSS_253cd

2. In Cilappatik?ram book 28, in the description of the C?ky?r's dance, is
a drum that is smeared with mud (*ma? ka?ai mu?avum*). You have probably
seen the passages in Bharata and ??r?gad?va describing the smearing of mud.

3. A line from B??abha??a's K?dambar? that speaks of how the coating makes
the sound of the drum sonorous - especially when it is freshly applied -

kad pb1.133 *atha n?ticir?d ev?nulepan?rdra-m?da?ga-dhvani-dh?re?a
nirvivara-vij?mbhita-pratin?da-gambh?re?a, ?abara?arat??it?n?? ke?ari???
nin?dena, [....] van?ntaravy?pin? dhv?nena sarvata? pracalitam iva tad
ara?yam abhavat* /

4.  In the contemporary Indian drums  *pakh?vaj *and  *m?da?ga*, one can
see two kinds of coating - one is a (more or less permanent) black circle
of clay, starch and iron filings that is fixed in the centre of the
membrane - this is usually done by a professional technician.  It is
pertinent that this tuning paste is also called *c??u* (*c???u*). The other
is a (temporary) circle of  cooked rice or semolina paste applied on top of
the black spot by the drummer before they perform on the *m?da?gam*. In the
case of the Pakh?vaj drum, a dough of wheat flour is applied.

5. It may be worthwhile to look at what the commentaries have to say on the
passage '*m?y?r? madayati m?rjan? man??si*' of the M?lavik?gnimitra.

Message-ID: <1691457494-9837927.14656346.f3781ICfT2885419@rs6162.luxsci.com>

Dear Scholars,

Are there any reliable estimates of land use in ancient India, especially in the main areas of Northern India where Mah?bh?rata events take place? I am especially interested in relative precentages and locations of land reserved as forests, or great forests (mah?-van?ni), and land actively farmed. Nowadays it seems that in the North Indian plains there are precious few great forests.

Many thanks for any resources, especially links to relevant maps.

Best wishes,
Howard

Dear All,

I too would appreciate this information. Some archaeological material is available, but it mostly indicates cities sizes and does not allow percentages of landscape usage to be determined.
You might try:

Julia Shaw, 2015, Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and archeologies of religious and social change, c. third century BC to fifth century AD, Routledge, London.

Cheers,

extraordinary, and will keep all vedic scholars busy for years into the
future.  Thank you, Asko, for working through grave illness, and also for
generously publishing all your work Open Access.

published in

The book is in print: https://brill.com/display/title/24037

Somewhat astonishingly, as far as I can see, Harvard does not own the book;
they should by all means order it for you!

Dear List Members,

If you?d like to hear a ?Carnatic Waltz? music ? here it is! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I4z-bIMM9E <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I4z-bIMM9E> 

The musician is Prince Rama Varma, a member of the Royal Family of the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom. 

I hope you will enjoy listening to it. Prince Rama Varma?s music is awesome, soul-soothing.

Message-ID: <CACHm+EoT=m_yzUjOA+kZ_HUHZK4LGpWP=Y5xVAr0sC84c2U=cg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Scholars and Researchers,



Namaste


            One of my principal tasks as the director of the *National
Mission for Manuscripts* (NMM) is to bring India's literary heritage to the
attention of South Asian scholars both here and abroad and to make these
literary witnesses of India?s intellectual achievements available for close
scrutiny and scholarly investigation. In order to do this, I am reaching
out to you, the scholars and researchers, who are actively engaged in the
study of Indian manuscripts.



            We at NMM are in the process of setting up a special website
that showcases the current scholarly work on Indian manuscripts by both the
international community and the scholars here in India. We would therefore
request that those of you, who work with these primary sources, send to me
a short video (maximum 8 minutes)  in which you identify yourself, state
your affiliation and/or position, and give a brief explanation of your
recent or past work with Indic manuscripts and manuscriptology. The video
need not be elaborate and can easily be made on an I-pad or Smartphone. If,
however, you prefer to present yourself and your work in written form, that
too will be appreciated, as a site will be created featuring the scholarly
work on Indic manuscripts. I would appreciate it if you could send me this
information at your earliest convenience, but not later than a month from
now. I shall be communicating with you from time to time to keep you
abreast of developments at NMM.



I thank you in advance for your help and cooperation.

Kindly send the videos to our official email: *director.namami at nic.in
<director.namami at nic.in>*



Yours sincerely,

Anirban Dash

Thank you, Christophe, for drawing attention to this new publication with an introduction written by myself. This was news to me too.

I indeed wrote an introduction to an edition which I planned to propose to an Indian publisher: the reprint was to include both Caland?s edition of the Jaiminiiya-Sa.mhitaa of 1907 and Raghu Viras?s edition of 1938.  This introduction was written some 40 years ago and, if I remember correctly, was never formally part of any publication agreement. How it came to the hands of the present publishers I do not know, but I do object to its publication (1) after the delay of some 40 years (2) without informing me about it and (3) without reprinting also Caland?s 1907 edition as proposed in the introduction. 

Nevertheless, Raghu Vira?s edition of the Jaiminiiya Aarcikas is an excellent and indispensable publication, and it is good to have it in print.

Best wishes, Asko

Message-ID: <1691792770-5889292.52539563.f37BMQ9cx4187297@rs6162.luxsci.com>

Dear Scholars,

I am trying to understand more precisely, if possible, the location of the ancient Mahabharata kingdom of Kunti. My present understanding is that it formed more or less the southern area of the loose confederation of Yadu principalities, with the main city being Mathur?.

Very roughly, it seems that the Kunti kingdom lay between Mathura to the north, and the Avanti capital to the south (sometimes identified with modern Ujjain).

I cannot even find a name for a Kunti capital, much less a precise location.

All help is warmly appreciated.

Howard

Dear Rajam,

All thanks for this delightful piece, candid (though not artless) and impish. A "Carnatic waltz", indeed a kind of oxymoron, paves the way for a true hr?dayasam?va?da between West and India

Dear List Members,

If you?d like to hear a ?Carnatic Waltz? music ? here it is!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I4z-bIMM9E

The musician is Prince Rama Varma, a member of the Royal Family of the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom.

I hope you will enjoy listening to it. Prince Rama Varma?s music is awesome, soul-soothing.

Regards,
rajam

I suspect I am not the only one who noticed this:

>>The special body will be vested with the right to take over a manuscript
from a private owner based on the uniqueness and the importance of the
content. The sum to be paid would be fixed by an expert committee, the
concept paper says. <<

If you want to be absolutely sure that people will not share their precious
manuscripts, then threaten to steal them from them.

Dear Colleagues,

Manipal's Department of Philosophy is happy to invite you to a joint lecture event delivered by our guests from Ghent University, Pr. Dr. Eva de Clercq and Pr. Dr. Tine Vekemans.

Titles:

  1.  The Jain Mah?bh?ratas

You may note the date: Wednesday, August 16th  at 10am Indian Time

See poster in attachment.

Topic

Speaker

Summary

Talk 1

The Jain Mah?bh?ratas

Prof Dr Eva De Clercq, Associate Professor Department of Languages and Cultures, Ghent University, Belgium

In this lecture, Eva De Clercq presents an overview of the Jain Mah?bh?rata materials from the ?gamas onwards. She explores the various ways in which later Jain poets integrated, transformed, or otherwise engaged with these themes, in different languages and genres illustrating those with some selected excerpts.

Talk 2

O Maharaj! Take these lemons ? A Yati's journey to East-Africa

Prof Dr Tine Vekemans, ?c?rya Mah?praj?a Chair for Jain Studies Department of Languages and Cultures, Ghent University, Belgium

This talk starts from a travelogue relating the experiences of a Jain mendicant travelling around the Western Indian Ocean in 1946. It focusses on the doubts and motivations that structure his decision to accept an invitation to visit Mombasa, and touches upon themes of reform and counter-reform, the impact of modernity on lay-mendicant relations, and the possibility of pan sectarian as well as subaltern solidarity.

Discussion of internet resources, legal issues, and Internet Archive has been of some concern on this list. There is a new New York Times piece, quite detailed, dealing with the latest legal wrinkles and delves into the history of publishers, copyright laws, etc., which some may find informative, if frustrating.

receiving decent coverage. Its looking like support for the
IA may need to be reassessed.


Best, Richard

Discussion of internet resources, legal issues, and Internet Archive has been of some concern on this list. There is a new New York Times piece, quite detailed, dealing with the latest legal wrinkles and delves into the history of publishers, copyright laws, etc., which some may find informative, if frustrating.

The Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t in Munich, Germany offers TWO PHD
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR DISSERTATION PROJECTS RELATED TO BUDDHISM.

DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS: October 25th, 2023
START OF SCHOLARSHIP: Spring, Summer or Autumn 2024
DURATION OF SCHOLARSHIP: 4 years
SCHOLARSHIP AMOUNT: ? 1,200 per month + insurance + support for
rent + ? 230-460 per year (research allowance) + lump sum for
travel + family allowance
SCHOLARSHIP DONOR: German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)
(Graduate School Scholarship Program / GSSP)

The DOCTORAL PROGRAM IN BUDDHIST STUDIES at the
Ludwigs-Maximilian-Universit?t in Munich is based on a cooperation
between Asian Studies (Indology, Japanology, Sinology,
Tibetology), Philosophy of Religion, and the Study of Religion and
promotes and supervises PhD theses related to Buddhism within a
broad range of subjects and disciplines.

THE SELECTION PROCESS comprises two stages: Applications are sent
to the Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies in Munich. The program
will select promising candidates, who then have to submit their
materials to the DAAD. Subsequently the DAAD decides upon the
successful candidates. It is expected that the successful
candidates will be chosen and informed by March 2024.

The PREREQUISITES FOR APPLICATION are non-German citizenship, a
Master of Arts degree or equivalent in a relevant field, excellent
knowledge of at least one Buddhist source language, outstanding
qualifications in the subject, and fluency in English. Applicants
should not have lived in Germany for more than 15 months at the
time of the submission of their materials to the DAAD (probably in
December or January), and the last final examination should have
taken place no more than six years before this date. In addition,
applicants must not have completed a PhD previously.

Ironically, the article is paywalled.  I'd like to read it, but I don't
wish to subscribe to the NYT for a long period.  If we were sitting in a
caf?, you could just pass the newspaper from your table to mine, so that I
could read the article.  And we could have a coffee.

Best,
Dominik

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Identifying (early modern) names of flowers
Message-ID: <52b64629-a4e9-327f-7d7f-2811597a8255@gmail.com>

On behalf of M?ns Broo, who is a member of the list but for some reason 
unable to post, I wonder if anyone can help in identifying the following 
species of flowers mentioned in a Gau??ya Vai??ava ritual text in 
Sanskrit (c. 16th century). The names in brackets are given by a 
commentator as /iti prasiddham/, but a search of Hindi and Bengali 
dictionaries has yielded no results so far:

k??va (ka?ahul?)
purandhr? (pu?gav?)
?ikhin (curiy?)
rotak?
timir? (tri?tara)
vill?taka

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten

Dear Colleagues, 

Further to my e-mail below dated 20 July, this is to inform you that the deadline for applications to the tenure-track Professorship in Modern Indology at LMU has now been extended to 13 September. This additional time will hopefully be appreciated by colleagues who, very understandably, needed a break over the past weeks. 

Prospective applicants are welcome to get in touch with me if they have queries. 

With kind regards,

The professorship in Modern Indology, held until September by our colleague Robert Zydenbos, is one of the three professorships at the Institute for Indology and Tibetology, alongside that of Classical Indology and that of Tibetan and Buddhist Studies. As you will see in the job description (also enclosed as PDF), the call is very broad, the focus being on the intellectual, cultural, and/or social history of Early Modern and Modern South Asia. The knowledge of Indian languages is required, but no specific language, literature, or area of expertise will be privileged a priori. Finally, note that early-career academics are very welcome to apply.

We generally get a lot of bad news especially in trying to navigate state bureaucracies, especially Indian. We all have our horror stories. But here is something new?good news. India now has an E-Visa system online. With trepidation I applied online for a Business Visa for myself and a Tourist Visa for my wife. We did this on Monday morning. They say the visa will come by email in four to five business days? yes, right! But, our visas arrive the very next day, within 24 hours. Imagine that. They really appear to have improved their E-Visa process. So, if you are going to India, getting a visa is a breeze. They even has a sample application form, if you want a dry run before doing the real application. Here is the official site: https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html

Junicode version 2.000
<https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/releases/tag/v2.000>

Repository: psb1558/Junicode-font <https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font>
? Tag: v2.000 <https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/tree/v2.000> ?
Commit: 2cbd638
<https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/commit/2cbd638c91d483c59072600c5f617239e1d769e8>
? Released by: psb1558 <https://github.com/psb1558>

Junicode 2.000 is a major reworking of the widely used font for students
and scholars of medieval Europe (though it also serves scholars in a number
of other disciplines). This version continues to track the development of
the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, with its wealth of specialized
medieval characters, but it also provides many OpenType features that allow
users to access MUFI characters in accessible ways.

Junicode is now an extended font family, with five weights (Light, Regular,
Medium, SemiBold, and Bold) and five widths (Condensed, SemiCondensed,
Regular, SemiExpanded, and Expanded). This makes for a large number of font
files (19 each for roman and italic, omitting a few unsuitable styles), but
the font also comes in a variable version, in which all the capabilities of
the traditional ?static? version?and more!?are packaged in just two files.
The variable version is especially suitable for web use, but variable fonts
can also be used in Adobe InDesign, LibreOffice, LuaTeX, and other
text-processing apps (see the file JunicodeManual.pdf for details).

This release also includes compressed WOFF2 versions of the variable fonts
for use in web pages. These are much quicker to download than static fonts,
and they are supported by all major browsers.
?

This release has 3 assets:

   - Junicode_2.000.zip
   - Source code (zip)
   - Source code (tar.gz)

Just a note for general information, proper protocol with such enquiries
would be for someone to forward this query to Prof Eck and leave it to her
to make contact if she wishes.  We shouldn't be posting people's private
information on this public list.

Sorry? Both Canada and Belgium are on the eVisa eligible list. I'm not
sure what page you are looking at. Screenshot below:

In fact, India introduced eVisa back in 2014. Initially just a tourist 
visa for a limited number of countries and for 30 days only, but 
gradually they expanded the number of countries, type of visa and length 
of validity. In 2019, I got a five-year tourist eVisa. The system was 
very efficient from the start, with visas usually granted within one or 
two days.

The only annoying restriction is that you must enter India at an airport 
or seaport, not at a land crossing.

Dear All,

I have heard that allegedly some colleagues were not able to enter India with their eVisas as their work did not entirely correspond to the views of the Indian government. Allegedly, they were not admitted to the country when they arrived at the airport (in Delhi and Mumbai) and were sent back on the first flight. Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain actual names as this is an uncomfortable situation which I guess, people do not publicly want to be associated with - however, it appears to apply to more and more colleagues these days.

Has anybody had direct experience with this or further information on this practice? It would be more helpful if one?s visa was turned down before one travelled.

With best wishes,

Julia.

Does anyone know if their has been recent work on the Cologne digital
sanskrit dictionaries https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/ in the
last few years.

Why I ask.  I've just accessed the "inflected forms lookup"
https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csl-inflect/web/index.php
and it has aorist forms.  For example: avardhata  I don't recall aorist
forms being there a few years ago (but I might be wrong).

My initial concern is that the date and time posited for PIE does not square with the evidence of horse domestication and the reconstructed PIE word for horse, reflexes of which are found in all branches. The paper does not even discuss this issue.

All the best,

Hans Henrich

Horse was a very important game animal in the steppe region from Neolithic times, and it is depicted already in the Khvalynsk culture, from which the Yamnaya culture is derived. Horse domestication followed later - it was necessary for the use of  chariots first evidenced in southern Trans-Urals in the Sintashta culture (2000-1900 BCE), which is very likely to be Proto-Indo-Iranian in language. Horse is likely to have been domesticated earlier than this in the steppe region, and kept for meat, milk and transport (as a pack-animal) but so far there is no clear evidence for its use for riding before c. 2100 in Mesopotamia. As one of the main hunted animals, very swift (??u : a?va), its name must have been present in the early predecessors of Proto-Indo-European. 

The splendid Majkop culture (c 4000-3000 BCE) of North Caucasus appears to represent a fusion of steppe culture (probably Early PIE in language) and culture of the Caucasus and the south up to Mesopotamia. Caucasus became a crucial source of metal for the steppe area after invaders from the steppe had largely destroyed the farming cultures of  the Balkans and their metal industry c. 4500 BCE. 

Best regards and wishes, Asko

Dear colleagues,

A recent broadcast on Quirks and Quarks (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation weekly broadcast on science interviewing scientists on their work) aired the work of scientists who found evidence of horse back riding from 5000 years ago.
Here is the link to the interview.
https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/research-earliest-horse-riders-1.6782485

The work was published in the journal Science Advances. A link to the article is found at the link about.

Best wishes,
Brendan

While there is still a slight possibility that the Anatolian horse words might not be inherited (until we find attestations of Hittite *ekku-), it is clear that horses must have been known to speakers of PIE but the linguistic evidence is not sufficient to be sure of domestication in the protolanguage itself.
For me as one author of the study, the biggest problem has remained the surprisingly early date for the divergence of Indo-Iranic but it should not be forgotten that the median age (5520 B. P.) highlighted in the article is just one possibility, and the range of probable dates (HPD) is much larger, from 4535-6796. Assuming the beginning of first dialectal differences (and this is what this approach models) around 2600 BC could agree with a final splitup around 2000 so that cultural innovations like the chariot could be (or look like) inherited in all subbranches.
I admit that I also suspect there might be a systematic problem in the methodology applied to ancient languages, possibly leading to exaggerated estimations of vocabulary differences but this needs to be worked out in detail ? now that we have a much better database. And of course, the results should be cross-checked with data from other linguistic levels, not just lexicon where the danger of undetected borrowings is highest.
I hope the new study will help to find possible problems in phylogenetic modelling not simply due to bad data.

All best wishes,
Martin

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Heggarty et al. 2023, "Language trees with sampled ancestors support a hybrid model for the origin of Indo-European languages" - reactions?

Horse was a very important game animal in the steppe region from Neolithic times, and it is depicted already in the Khvalynsk culture, from which the Yamnaya culture is derived. Horse domestication followed later - it was necessary for the use of  chariots first evidenced in southern Trans-Urals in the Sintashta culture (2000-1900 BCE), which is very likely to be Proto-Indo-Iranian in language. Horse is likely to have been domesticated earlier than this in the steppe region, and kept for meat, milk and transport (as a pack-animal) but so far there is no clear evidence for its use for riding before c. 2100 in Mesopotamia. As one of the main hunted animals, very swift (??u : a?va), its name must have been present in the early predecessors of Proto-Indo-European.

The splendid Majkop culture (c 4000-3000 BCE) of North Caucasus appears to represent a fusion of steppe culture (probably Early PIE in language) and culture of the Caucasus and the south up to Mesopotamia. Caucasus became a crucial source of metal for the steppe area after invaders from the steppe had largely destroyed the farming cultures of  the Balkans and their metal industry c. 4500 BCE.

Best regards and wishes, Asko

This is just an anecdote, but when I was an undergraduate, my teacher Prof.
Thomas Burrow told us that the earliest possible historical reconstruction
of PIE still looked like a "loosely connected set of dialects," not a
single language.

I completely agree with the statement of Thomas Burrow that Dominik
reported. A completely unified language without variation is an illusion,
often created by the standardized "official" versions. In Marathi, there is
a proverb that says that language changes after every 12 Kos [Skt. Kro?a =
2 miles?]. As Kiparsky brought out vividly, P??ini's Sanskrit also has a
great deal of variation, and one can indeed think of various local dialects
or varieties of Sanskrit.

Message-ID: <1692914559-4931444.94432287.f37OM2cIL886351@rs6162.luxsci.com>

Dear Scholars,

Some claim that the Trigartas, a warrior community who appear somewhat regularly in the Mah?bh?rata, are first mentioned in P?nin? 5.3.116 d?many?ditrigarta?a???ccha?  ??????????????????????????

Further, in his entry on ?yudha, ?weapon,? Monier-Williams lists the compounds ?yudha-j?vin, ?living by one?s weapons,? and ?yudha-j?v?, m. ?a warrior.? He attributes this latter case to P??ini 4.3.81, which I could not find. To make my confusion complete, some say that this term ?yudha-j?v?, allegedly in P??ini, refers to the Trigartas.
 
Many thanks to anyone who can clarify this for me. 

Best wishes,
Howard

I?m not adding anything new or enlightening to the current discussion, but I just wanted to share my frustration that the notion of ?unification? or the ?father/mother? of this language and that language is all ?farce,? if I may say so. 

In Tamil Nadu, the situation is not pleasant, to put it mildly. To begin with, ?language' is always associated with race and caste. If one likes Sanskrit, that person must be a ?brahmin? who must be an ?enemy? (??????? ??????). I don?t have graceful words to express such animalistic attitudes. It causes a problem for academicians like me. For starters, I need to be careful not to use Grantha letters or Sanskrit words in my writing. There are several ?language vigilantes.? They republish old writings, by brahmins/non-brahmins, removing/masking the authors' caste names, grantha letters, and such.  

Anyway, in my view ? no race or language can be ?pure.? 

Regards,
rajam

As usual, the correct reference (P. 4.3.91) is found in the PW  
(B?htlingk/Roth, Sanskrit-W?rterbuch, Pt. 1, St. Petersburg 1855, p.

Dear list members,
I've been asked to find lesser known commentaries on the Yoga sutras of
Patanjali.
I.e. commentaries made before 1900 and other than the commentaries
of V?chaspati Mi?ra, Bhoja R?ja, Vij??nabhik?u, R?m?nanda Sarasvat?, and
Swami Hariharananda Aranya.

If anyone could point these out to me would be great.
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Greetings Indologists,

Does anyone have a PDF of the Marathi *L???caritra* that might share with
me, preferably the Dvit?y?v?tt? of the *Mah?r?sh?ra R?jya S?hitya-S?sk?ti
Ma??a?a*, *1982*, edition in Devan?gar? (entitled ?r?cakradhara
L???caritra) . Devan?gar? or Roman pdfs and/or etexts of other editions
would also be acceptable.

Back when HathiTrust was allowing full access to documents during COVID-19
lockdown, I was able to access and transcribe several chapters for my
dissertation research. However, I need more information to properly cite
the sections I have excerpted and HathiTrust has long since discontinued
their emergency full access program.

In related news, I was excited to discover that Anne Feldhaus will soon
publish Volume 1 of her English translation! Thank you, Anne, if you are on
this list.


*Sincerely,*

 Universitatis Halensis'
Message-ID: <CAHXN0FtsJQ1q_BedOop1vc7gqTH4NKSH5Ae130fWhEzLdPprjw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

we are pleased to announce the recent  publication of

Walter Slaje, Kaschmir im 16. JahrhundertVom unabh?ngigen Sultanat zur
mogulischen Annexion
(?ukas R?jatara?gi??, A.?D. 1513?1597)
Halle/Saale: Universit?tsverlag Halle-Wittenberg
Studia Indologica Universitatis Halensis, vol. 27.

The present work, handed down under the name of a certain ?uka and
supple?mented by anonymous authors, constitutes the fourth so-called
*R?jatara?gi??* (?River of Kings?) in the series of Kashmirian
historio?graphies begun by Kalha?a and continued by Jonar?ja and ?r?vara.
It is a chronicle of Kashmir?s rule and events in history, spanning the
16th century. It begins after the end of Bha??a Pr?jya?s lost historical
work *R?j?valipat?k?* in 1513, while Fat? ??h was still exercising his
second reign, and ends in 1597 with the con?struction of the Naganagar?
city fort just before Emperor Akbar?s third visit to ?r?nagara. The
16th century in Kashmir was marked by the spread of N?rba??iyya-Sufism and
the decades-long struggle for the throne between two agnates, both of whom
were in the line of the ??hm?r?s: Fat? ??h and Ma?m?d ??h. After a Mughal
inter?regnum by Mirz? ?aydar D??l?t (1541?1551) and sub?sequent successions
to the throne at short intervals, the inde?pendent sultanate of ??hm?r?
rule was first over thrown by the dynasty of the ?aks (1555?1586), whose
rule in turn was ended by Akbar in October 1586 annexing Kashmir to his
Mughal Empire. According to our sources, assaults by an aggressive
soldiery, epidemics, famines and earth?quake disasters were the living
conditions of a largely defence?less population at that time.
Due to the translation by Dutt (1898) and the edition by Kaul (1966), both
of whom had interfered massively and without substantiation with the
textual structure as transmitted, the chrono?logical course and temporal
scope of the work were disturbed to such an extent that they were no longer
properly recognisable.

In this new edition, which is accompanied by an annotated German
translation and indexes, the original structure and thus also the
largely ? though not com?pletely ? intact chrono?logy of the text have
been restored according to the manus?cript tradition as repre?sented
by the older editions Calcutta 1835 and Bombay 1896.


hardbound, 262 pages
ISBN 978-3-86977-263-9

The book can be ordered directly from the publisher

  *   Sacred geographies and potent landscapes
  *   Interreligious interactions and/or contestations at pilgrimage sites
  *   Contemporary developments at pilgrimage sites or in pilgrimage practices
  *   Pilgrimage and commerce

Speakers will be allocated 40 minutes for their presentation and an additional 20 minutes for questions. We also welcome proposals from final-year PhD students, who will be allocated 20 minutes for their presentation and 10 minutes for questions.

Dear listmembers,

DEVAD?TE is a small Sinhalese poem of 44 verses that narrates the pains 
in the 136 Buddhist hells. It has only 8 pp. and was printed 1870 in 
Colombo. I found only the following reference to this book in the 
British Museum Catalogue of Sinhalese Books (by Wikremasinghe) p. 56b: 
8?. 14165. h. 3.(8.).
Does anyone know how I can order a copy from there? On the website of 
the British Museum I just got lost.

Thank you for any assistance
Heiner

Dear Heiner,

almost all of these old Indian books held by the British Museum are now 
in the British Library. Contact the Asian & African Studies Reference 
Team, they are very helpful.
https://www.bl.uk/subjects/south-asia

Once they identify the book in their collection, it is easy to order a 
scan of it.

Best,
Lubomir

Dear colleagues,

I'm wondering if anyone has any good recommendations for secondary sources on the nature and role of the figure of the s?ta. Van Buitenen, in his introduction to the Bhagavadg?t?, writes (1981, p. 5): "Traditionally the s?ta, on the chariot of the warrior, is witness to the warrior's triumphs and occasional lapses; in danger he protects him. The triumphs of the warrior he celebrates in song, hence s?ta also means 'bard.'" I'd like to read more about the details of this. Is there any good scholarship on it?

Gratefully,
James Reich

Junicode explicitly supports Classical Sanskrit in transliteration.  With
this release 2, Junicode is now an extremely impressive and beautiful font
with the widest character set for medieval and early European language work
of any I know.

Junicode version 2.003
<https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/releases/tag/v2.003>

Repository: psb1558/Junicode-font <https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font>
? Tag: v2.003 <https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/tree/v2.003> ?
Commit: aa306bd
<https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/commit/aa306bd8ae38a1c188c9fee348f0e2d59eba993b>
? Released by: psb1558 <https://github.com/psb1558>

Junicode 2 is a major reworking of the widely used font for students and
scholars of medieval Europe (though it also serves scholars in a number of
other disciplines). This version continues to track the development of the
Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, with its wealth of specialized medieval
characters, but it also provides many OpenType features that allow users to
access MUFI characters in accessible ways.

Junicode is now an extended font family, with five weights (Light, Regular,
Medium, SemiBold, and Bold) and five widths (Condensed, SemiCondensed,
Regular, SemiExpanded, and Expanded). This makes for a large number of font
files (19 each for roman and italic, omitting a few unsuitable styles), but
the font also comes in a variable version, in which all the capabilities of
the traditional ?static? version?and more!?are packaged in just two files.
The variable version is especially suitable for web use, but variable fonts
can also be used in Adobe InDesign, LibreOffice, LuaTeX, and other
text-processing apps (see the file JunicodeManual.pdf for details).

This is mostly a bug-fix version. It (1) fixes several non-functioning tag
sequences; (2) fixes an incompatibility with InDesign that caused OpenType
features to misbehave in that program; (3) improved several outlines and
adjusted badly positioned anchors.

Dear list members,
I received this reply offlist from Dr. Dhaval Patel which may be of
interest to some list members:

Dear Harry,

Regarding your question regarding Cologne dictionaries,

Jim Funderburk, Andhrabharati and I keep on doing a lot of work on CDSL.
The work can be seen in
https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon. It includes typo corrections, addition
of new markup, addition of new features. It also includes addition of new
dictionaries e.g. LRV, LAN, ARMH have been added in past few years. See
https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/

Van Buitenen, in his introduction to the Bhagavadg?t?, writes (1981, p. 5): "Traditionally the s?ta, on the chariot of the warrior, is witness to the warrior's triumphs and occasional lapses; in danger he protects him.
