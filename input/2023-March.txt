Dear List,
Does anyone know any references to the term 'brothering' allegedly used by Sheldon Pollock in connection with the two great Sanskrit epics? The term 'brothering' is supposed to be opposite of the more well-known postmodern term 'othering'.
Thanks in advance.
Warm regards

Indeed,
it is there on page 34 of the said introduction:
... the 'Ram?yana' is a tale of "othering," the enemy is non-human, even 
demonic, ...; the 'Mahabh?rata' is a tale of "brothering," the enemy are 
kinsmen, ...

Best,

Hanumaan, another  vaanara etc. get brothered in Ramayana.

*The Third Eye of Indian Art, Aesthetics as Vedanta.*

Since colonial times, the study of Indian art has been taken over by art
historians. While this has helped to some extent, as historians, like
archeologists, have unearthed many lost and forgotten objects. However,
Indian art cannot stop there, as the ultimate resting point is an aesthetic
experience. It is time to get away from colonial constructs and decolonize
our minds. Prof. Harsha V. Dehejia presents an illustrated talk on the
journey from art history to aesthetic experience and takes us to the inner
mind where beauty resides and is experienced. He has a double doctorate,
one in Medicine and the other in Ancient Indian Culture, both from Mumbai
University. He is a practicing Physician and Professor of Hindu Studies at
the College of the Humanities of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. He
has more than 30 books, 3 documentary films, and many curated exhibitions.

Dear all,

Maybe someone can help. My friend is starting to self-study Hindi and I
gave her *Teach yourself hindi* by Rupert Snell with Simon Weightman (this
edition should be published in 2003, I attached a cover picture).
Unfortunately, I have not the audio tracks, which are necessary for
self-study. Anyone can help me in finding them?

Best,
Paolo

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Looking for Hindi teach yourself audio


? Caution: External sender

Dear all,

Maybe someone can help. My friend is starting to self-study Hindi and I gave her Teach yourself hindi by Rupert Snell with Simon Weightman (this edition should be published in 2003, I attached a cover picture). Unfortunately, I have not the audio tracks, which are necessary for self-study. Anyone can help me in finding them?

Best,
Paolo

Dear Colleagues, 

Jens-Uwe Hartmann, who is not on this list, has asked me to pass on the announcement of the death of Prof. Adelheid Mette (12 December 1934 ? 3 March 2023).

Born in Belgard on the Persante in the then province of Pomerania, Adelheid Mette studied Classical Philology in Hamburg where she prepared a PhD on the Aiolian meters in the dramas of Euripides (1959). She then switched to Indology and wrote a habilitation thesis on an ancient Jain work concerned with the almsround of the monks (1972). From 1972 to 1988 she was first Hochschulassistent (Assistant Professor), then Professor (1980) at the University of Munich. In 1988 she accepted the call to the chair of Indology at the University of M?nster, which she held until her retirement in 2000. After her retirement, she remained associated with the Indology Institute in Munich, teaching on a variety of subjects until a few years ago. She died in a nursing home in Ottobrunn near Munich where she had lived for the last two years.
 
With kind regards,

*Sacred Space in Modern and Contemporary ?atru?jaya Pa?as*


Paintings of Jain *t?rtha*s (sacred sites) have served as objects of
devotion, with the earliest extant examples depicting *yantra*s (mystic
diagrams), T?rtha?karas, and cosmic diagrams, dating back to the 15th
century. Among these paintings, *pa?a*s (cloth paintings) of ?atru?jaya
have garnered the most interest due to their large size, striking colors,
and iconographic representations. In this lecture, Dr. Hawon Ku examines
the ?atru?jaya *pa?a*s, particularly those from the late 18th and 19th
centuries. She argues that these Jain *t?rtha pa?a*s indicate changes in
the Jain community?s perception of ?atru?jaya. Specifically, during this
period, ?atru?jaya shifted from its traditional status as one of the five
important pilgrimage sites to becoming one of the most prominent sites for
?vet?mbar Jains. In addition to the traditional temples on ?atru?jaya,
contemporary *pa?a*s show a more extensive sacred space that includes a
depiction of the town of P?l?t??? and its recently constructed temples. In
the lecture, Dr. Ku explores these developments of ?sacred space? through
selected examples of *pa?a*s and discusses how the stylistic changes
reflect the rise of a modern Jain identity.

Dr. Hawon Ku is Associate Professor of Indian Studies at the Department of
Asian Languages and Civilizations, Seoul National University, Korea. She
was Visiting Scholar at SOAS, London (2018), and Assistant Professor at the
Department of Hindi at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (2011-2015),
following her PhD from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. She
currently teaches modern and contemporary South Asian art and culture, and
her recent research has focused on female patronage of paintings and
temples in modern India, including Jain temple architecture of the early
20th century.

Message-ID: <DB8PR09MB3929B0D47E3DDD44413DFA80DFB89@DB8PR09MB3929.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Dear List members,

In a passage in a Jain text I came across a formation consisting of the preposition p(r)a and a cardinal number, in a context in which "over that number (of years)" would make sense (compare prapatha, "weiter Weg", prav?ra, "grosser Held", and pra?apat, "Urenkel" in AiGr II, p. 257). The combination pra+number looks like an ad hoc, learned formation. Or, and this is my question, is it perhaps found in other texts I am not aware of, for instance, in treatises about mathematics or temple building?

With kind regards,
Herman

Dear Professor Tieken,

I?m not knowledged about what you are describing/proposing here. Nevertheless, I?d like to share some of my thoughts. 

I?ve been looking into the technique of rendering numerals in Old Tamil, specifically in the Tolkappiyam and similar texts. 

The phrase that immediately came to my mind was pra-dhaksina (?????????), which I take to mean ?due South.?  

It seems to me that such references are based on ?clock-wise? movement. 

Regards, 
rajam

Dear Rajam,

this is one of the meanings which AiGr assigns to pra- "towards". Then it would be "almost the X number of years", which would fit the context well. Why I have not followed up this lead so far is that I am not sure if this English expression was possible in Sanskrit as well. Therefore I am curious to know if there are actual occurrences of the combination in Sanskrit.

With kind regards, Herman

Dear Professor Tieken,

I?m not knowledged about what you are describing/proposing here. Nevertheless, I?d like to share some of my thoughts.

I?ve been looking into the technique of rendering numerals in Old Tamil, specifically in the Tolkappiyam and similar texts.

The phrase that immediately came to my mind was pra-dhaksina (?????????), which I take to mean ?due South.?

It seems to me that such references are based on ?clock-wise? movement.

Regards,
rajam

Dear List members,

In a passage in a Jain text I came across a formation consisting of the preposition p(r)a and a cardinal number, in a context in which "over that number (of years)" would make sense (compareprapatha, "weiter Weg", prav?ra, "grosser Held", and pra?apat, "Urenkel" in AiGr II, p. 257). The combination pra+number looks like an ad hoc, learned formation. Or, and this is my question, is it perhaps found in other texts I am not aware of, for instance, in treatises about mathematics or temple building?

With kind regards,
Herman

Dear Sebastian,

I think it would be useful to members of this forum to receive - in
addition - a simpler explanation of the remarkable results you and your
colleagues have achieved.  Could you do that, including a practical guide
to how the ordinary jobbing Indologist can use what you have done for
practical purposes in daily work?

With thanks,

In transcribing a manuscript it is best practice to transcribe
diplomatically exactly what the MS says.

A second, separate file may be prepared that contains various
normalisations, like ba/va or ?a/sa, rma/rmma, etc.

To normalise the main transcription file takes away the opportunity to
study these phenomena.  And in any case, the majority of these features can
be manipulated with regular-expression rules, as in Saktumiva
<https://saktumiva.org/wiki/orthography>.  So there's no need to normalise
them.

Best,
Dominik

Dear Dominik, dear list members,

Sure. The models are published on HuggingFace, which is a hub for deep
learning models of various kinds, a lot of them aimed at natural
language processing tasks.
Both models are of the RoBERTa-architecture, which is very similar to
BERT. A description of what BERT is and what it can do can be found
here: https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-101
BERT can be described as a medium size language model in contrast to
large language models such as GPT(3) which have been heavily in the
news over the last couple of months
The models we trained for Sanskrit and Vedic Sanskrit are especially
suited for tasks such as sentence classification, tagging (POS,
morpho-syntax) and dependency parsing.
It needs to be noted however that the models on Hugging Face are not
yet finetuned on any of these tasks, and we didn't yet release
ready-to-use code to do POS tagging etc.
So these models can be used as a basic building block in order to
create a Sanskrit processing pipeline, but they are not yet useful for
downstream applications without finetuning.
I hope this is helpful!
With best wishes,

Sebastian

Dear Dominik and Harry,
Determining ?exactly what the MS says? may sometimes be a less
straightforward task than it may seem. Frequently, transcribing requires
interpreting. To quote Walter Slaje:

?The ambiguity of some characters of the ??rad? script that are almost, or
in many cases actually, homographic makes reference to the lexicon,
grammar, and syntax now and then a necessary condition for the
interpretation of a character. In any case, an interactive process of
script deciphering and textual understanding is required.?
(My rough translation of Slaje, Walter (1993). *??rad?
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/602wzzrp7c5uf52/Slaje_Sarada_1993.pdf?dl=0>.
Deskriptiv-synchrone Schriftkunde zur Bearbeitung kaschmirischer
Sanskrit-Manuskripte auf der Grundlage von Ku?alas
Gha?akharpara-G??had?pik?*. Reinbek: Verl. f?r Orientalistische
Fachpublikationen, (Indische Schriften 1), p. 2: ?Beding durch die
Mehrdeutigkeit einiger nahezu oder oft auch tats?chlich homographer Zeichen
der ??rd?-Schrift ist der R?ckgriff auf Lexikon, Grammatik oder
Satzkonstruktion mitunter eine notwendige Voraussetzung f?r die Deutung der
Schriftzeichen. Es bedarf daher auf jeden Fall eines wechselwirkenden
Verfahrens von Schriftentzifferung und Textverst?ndnis.?)

Slaje provides a list of ?semi-homograph ak?ara-s? in the ??rad? script,
including *ba *and *va, *on p. 43-45.

I fully agree with Dominik that orthographic peculiarities like the
gemination of consonants after *r*, the writing of class nasals and
anusvara, etc., should be exactly reflected in transcriptions. However, any
manuscript transcript should be based on a benevolent interpretation of the
Sanskrit text transmitted in the witness, containing, for example, *ba* or
*va*, when and wherever required by the contexts.
With best wishes,

Philipp

Dear all,

Many of these points must also be considered when providing a 
preliminary transcription for a Tamil text, written in the traditional 
method used in MSS, with a very ambiguous spelling.

This is why, for a number of years, I have decided that I shall always 
make use of a RAW VERBATIM transcription system, when first transcribing 
a MS.

To give just one example, when this last message came,
I was in the process of transcribing the beginning of the first line in 
leaf 26 of an old MS of the ?????????? [c???varaiyam], which is a 
medieval commentary on the second book of ????????????? [tolk?ppiyam]

I attach a fragment of the image (TC_19c_5.png), for the reference.

The XML fragment which I just now wrote is at the bottom of my 
contribution to this message.

The transliterated text, inside <incipit_transliterated>..., with a 
detailed analysis, was prepared by me many years ago.

The (raw) VERBATIM text, inside <incipit_verbatim>..., illustrates a set 
of conventions which I have developped over the years, in order to AVOID 
PREMATURELY RESOLVING the ambiguities inherent in the Tamil script used 
in MS, where for instance

(A) No pu??i is used

(B) -e and -? are not distinguished, and are therefore transcribed by me 
as @ (my notation for the ?????? [kompu]), which is also part of the 
notation for -o (undistinguished from -?)
   COMPARE @ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? [ceyya+-pa??a]
   WITH @ ? # ?? @ ? [poru? -?]

(C) The same glyph, which I transcribe here as "#",
- can note long -?
   (See ? ?? ? # ?? ? @ ? ?? ? [valit-?yi??-e?i?])
- can note "ra" (modern ?) ((no example in this sample))
- is part of the notation for -o (undistinguished from -?)
   (See @ ? ? ? @@ ? ? X @ ? # ?? @ ? [ceya?kai+-poru? -?])

(D) The standalone symbol for -ai is noted as "@@" by me, except when 
writing ?? ?? ?? and ??
  (See ?? ? ? @@ ? [nilattai]  and @ ? ? ? @@ ? [ceya?kai]

Dear List members,

With the support of the Khyentse Foundation, a large collection of Gandhari birch bark manuscripts was donated to the Islamabad Museum, Pakistan, on 26 December 2022. The conservation, photographing, study, and publication of these manuscripts by the Gandhari Manuscript Project (GMP) will be carried out under the terms of an agreement between the (Federal) Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM), Islamabad, Pakistan, and the University of Sydney, Australia, that was signed on 20 December 2022. Both the Australian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, and the Pakistan High Commission in Canberra, Australia, assisted its passage.
     Although the collection is yet to be fully conserved, a rough estimate is that it consists of at least 50 to 60 scrolls or scroll fragments, which constitutes the largest collection of Gandhari manuscripts known to date. These manuscripts are thought to have originated from northern Pakistan and to date to between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE, although some manuscripts in the collection may well fall outside this range.
     The housing of these Gandhari manuscripts in Pakistan at the Islamabad Museum and their conservation there sets a precedent for the reversal of the common scenario whereby such materials are taken out of their region of origin as part of the antiquities trade, resulting in a significant loss of cultural heritage. In addition, this initiative will form the basis for collaboration with Pakistani scholars and for training Pakistani students in order to promote the conservation and study of such materials and the documentation of Pakistan's rich Buddhist heritage.
     A more comprehensive account of the texts in the collection, their date and their significance, and of the collection as a whole, will be possible once all scrolls and scroll fragments have been conserved and an initial survey has been undertaken.
     For further details on the collection and the Gandhari Manuscript Project, see https://gandhari-texts.sydney.edu.au/gandhari-manuscripts/.
     The Khyentse Foundation recently posted notification on their website<https://khyentsefoundation.org/kf-news-march-2023-2000-year-old-gandhari-buddhist-manuscripts-find-permanent-home-in-pakistan/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=KF%20News%20March%202023%20%20Gandhari%20Buddhist%20Manuscripts&utm_content=KF%20News%20March%202023%20%20Gandhari%20Buddhist%20Manuscripts+CID_b1460f51b596bd2acc684301aa05c4cf&utm_source=Email%20Marketing%20Platform&utm_term=READ%20THE%20ARTICLE%20ON%20OUR%20WEBSITE>.

Message-ID: <785F6A1E-8C57-450E-BFF2-E7DDACFED0C2@ohio.edu>

Dear Colleagues,

I am sorry to report that Alf Hiltebeitel passed away in the Republic of Colombia a few days ago. It doesn?t need saying, but he was a giant in the field and made important contributions as a historian of religions, an ethnographer, a philologist, and a scholar of intellectual history. He even continued producing scholarship well after his advanced Parkinson?s made it impossible to speak and very difficult to write.

He was most well known for his work on the Mah?bh?rata epic. And over the course of his life, he practically produced an epic of his own.

His first book, The Ritual of Battle (Cornell 1976), and his two most recent books, Nonviolence in the Mah?bh?rata (Routledge 2016) and World of Wonders (Oxford 2021) add up to about 800 pages combined. The two volumes of The Cult of Draupad?, Vol. 1, Mythologies: From Gingee to Kuruk?etra (Chicago 1988) and Vol. 2, On Hindu Ritual and the Goddess (Chicago 1991), are another 1000 pages or so.

The two ?rethinking? books, Rethinking India?s Oral and Classical Epics: Draupad? among Rajputs, Muslims, and Dalits (Chicago 1999) and Rethinking the Mah?bh?rata: A Reader?s Guide to the Education of the Dharma King (Chicago 2001), are about another 900 pages.

Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mah?bh?rata and When the Goddess Was a Woman: Mah?bh?rata Ethnographies (Brill 2011), are about 1200 pages altogether. Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative (Oxford 2011) is about 700 pages. The two Freud books, Freud?s India and Freud?s Mah?bh?rata (Oxford 2018), are 600 combined pages.

We get an estimated total of 5,200 pages (roughly the same size as Bibek Debroy?s ten-volume English translation of the Mah?bh?rata) if we stop this partial bibliography there. But Alf did not stop there, and was working on a book about Vy?sa as late as last year.

There won?t be another like Alf. He will be sorely missed by his students and his colleagues, but will never be forgotten as long as English readers still want to grapple with the immensity of India?s Great Epic.

With condolences to his friends and family especially,

Brian

Dear Brian,

Many thanks for these words. Alf will remain an enormous presence for so many of us. I have fond memories of the first time I met him, somewhat in awe, at the 2007 DICSEP conference, and then on a number of times afterwards. He was always generous with his time and conversation and always striving to understand the great epic better. He will be missed and warmly remembered. 

All the best,
Adam

Yes, he was a fine scholar who not only filmy established the field of Mahabharata Studies but then, continued to change the paradigms and methodology of that field for decades. We are all grateful to him ...

I am so sorry to read this and my thoughts go to his family and close friends.
I will always remember getting an unsolicited and very encouraging email from him shortly after my MA thesis was published (in 2001, I think); my wife was working on my computer and came running down the stairs saying, ?Alf Hitebeitel has emailed you! Alf Hiltebeitel has emailed you!? Such was his profile in our household that my wife, not an Indologist, was as excited as I was. It is a mark of the sort of scholar he was that he was reaching out to Mah?-minnows like me and encouraging and supporting them. I will miss his low-key presentation style and the range, depth and innovative character of his scholarship, as I am sure we all will.

Dear Colleagues,

May I gently and kindly remind you that I do not run the INDOLOGY forum.
It is run by a committee <https://indology.info/committee-members/>, and we
members each take turns to be on duty for a week.  The address for queries
is

   - indology-owner at list.indology.info

I know I founded the forum and I'm closely identified with it, but please
don't write to me directly on forum matters. I just have to bounce the
message on to the committee, and that is time I lose.

You may see management emails from me or other individual committee
members.  But that's just a spin of the wheel; we are replying on behalf of
the committee merely as the member on duty at that time.

All this is on the INDOLOGY website <https://indology.info/contact/>.

Many thanks!

Thank you, Brian, for sharing this very sad news.  Having just returned from the AOS annual meeting, I feel heartbroken to know that Alf has left the world before I could tell him goodbye and thank him for so many things.  Alf was generous to young scholars because he always wanted to learn more and he learned from everyone, no matter how small and insignificant their oeuvre compared to his, a towering genius in our field.  I think Alf was a bhakta at heart, and I hope upon his passing, he beheld Krishna's cosmic form without fear, all his desires fulfilled, all his questions answered, his being vast and free and blissful.

With respect to Alf, and sympathy for his family,
Tracy Coleman

Dear Colleagues,


I am sorry to report that Alf Hiltebeitel passed away in the Republic of Colombia a few days ago. It doesn?t need saying, but he was a giant in the field and made important contributions as a historian of religions, an ethnographer, a philologist, and a scholar of intellectual history. He even continued producing scholarship well after his advanced Parkinson?s made it impossible to speak and very difficult to write.


He was most well known for his work on the Mah?bh?rata epic. And over the course of his life, he practically produced an epic of his own.


His first book, The Ritual of Battle (Cornell 1976), and his two most recent books, Nonviolence in the Mah?bh?rata (Routledge 2016) and World of Wonders (Oxford 2021) add up to about 800 pages combined. The two volumes of The Cult of Draupad?, Vol. 1, Mythologies: From Gingee to Kuruk?etra (Chicago 1988) and Vol. 2, On Hindu Ritual and the Goddess (Chicago 1991), are another 1000 pages or so.


The two ?rethinking? books, Rethinking India?s Oral and Classical Epics: Draupad? among Rajputs, Muslims, and Dalits (Chicago 1999) and Rethinking the Mah?bh?rata: A Reader?s Guide to the Education of the Dharma King (Chicago 2001), are about another 900 pages.


Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mah?bh?rata and When the Goddess Was a Woman: Mah?bh?rata Ethnographies (Brill 2011), are about 1200 pages altogether. Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative (Oxford 2011) is about 700 pages. The two Freud books, Freud?s India and Freud?s Mah?bh?rata (Oxford 2018), are 600 combined pages.


We get an estimated total of 5,200 pages (roughly the same size as Bibek Debroy?s ten-volume English translation of the Mah?bh?rata) if we stop this partial bibliography there. But Alf did not stop there, and was working on a book about Vy?sa as late as last year.


There won?t be another like Alf. He will be sorely missed by his students and his colleagues, but will never be forgotten as long as English readers still want to grapple with the immensity of India?s Great Epic.

With condolences to his friends and family especially,

Brian

  I think there are two very different scenarios in the transcription of
manuscripts.
1) When a specialist in an indological field is looking at a small number
of manuscripts in a field he's studied for years or decades for some study
or some critical edition.  So he has the expertise and also probably
multiple manuscripts of the same text, so he has the data and the expertise
to make" the  benevolent interpretation of the Sanskrit text transmitted in
the witness"   Phillip Maas describes.

2) The second scenario is where a much larger number of manuscripts,
perhaps a portion of some collection, is being transcribed by multiple
non-specialist typists with various degrees of knowledge of sanskrit.
supervised by a professional sanskritist. But where the volume of texts
being transcribed is too large for every word to be checked by the
supervisor. In that case it seems to me the safest practice is what Dominik
Wujastyk asserts. I.e.  " In transcribing a manuscript it is best practice
to transcribe diplomatically exactly what the MS says".  For the same
the reason Jean-Luc Chevillard gives in order to avoid prematurely
resolving inherent ambiguities.  In this case the users of these
transcribed texts will most likely be specialists with more knowledge than
the typists to resolve any ambiguities in the text.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear Brian,

Thanks for notifying us about this.

What a loss. Not just a dear friend, but a great scholar who brought the Mah?bh?rata to life and light in so many ways. His work has been an inspiration for us all.

Condolences to Elena and his family.

Dear Colleagues,


I am sorry to report that Alf Hiltebeitel passed away in the Republic of Colombia a few days ago. It doesn?t need saying, but he was a giant in the field and made important contributions as a historian of religions, an ethnographer, a philologist, and a scholar of intellectual history. He even continued producing scholarship well after his advanced Parkinson?s made it impossible to speak and very difficult to write.


He was most well known for his work on the Mah?bh?rata epic. And over the course of his life, he practically produced an epic of his own.


His first book, The Ritual of Battle (Cornell 1976), and his two most recent books, Nonviolence in the Mah?bh?rata (Routledge 2016) and World of Wonders (Oxford 2021) add up to about 800 pages combined. The two volumes of The Cult of Draupad?, Vol. 1, Mythologies: From Gingee to Kuruk?etra (Chicago 1988) and Vol. 2, On Hindu Ritual and the Goddess (Chicago 1991), are another 1000 pages or so.


The two ?rethinking? books, Rethinking India?s Oral and Classical Epics: Draupad? among Rajputs, Muslims, and Dalits (Chicago 1999) and Rethinking the Mah?bh?rata: A Reader?s Guide to the Education of the Dharma King (Chicago 2001), are about another 900 pages.


Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mah?bh?rata and When the Goddess Was a Woman: Mah?bh?rata Ethnographies (Brill 2011), are about 1200 pages altogether. Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative (Oxford 2011) is about 700 pages. The two Freud books, Freud?s India and Freud?s Mah?bh?rata (Oxford 2018), are 600 combined pages.


We get an estimated total of 5,200 pages (roughly the same size as Bibek Debroy?s ten-volume English translation of the Mah?bh?rata) if we stop this partial bibliography there. But Alf did not stop there, and was working on a book about Vy?sa as late as last year.


There won?t be another like Alf. He will be sorely missed by his students and his colleagues, but will never be forgotten as long as English readers still want to grapple with the immensity of India?s Great Epic.

With condolences to his friends and family especially,

Brian

Very sad news indeed! The world is now a smaller place. Alf was an
extraordinary figure in the study of the Mah?bharata and Indian epics more
generally, and he was a good friend for almost fifty years. We met in Pune
in 1974 and began a *sa?v?da* that continued for more than forty years. We
disagreed often enough, but we agreed even more often. I have missed him
since his last visit to Brown, after which communication became more
difficult, but I am indeed grateful for all the time we had to talk before
then. May he rest in peace.

Thanks. Brian, for passing on this very sad news for all who knew Alf and his work in  the fields of Epic Studies and  the History of Religions. Alf was, indeed, a colossus in the field, especially in regard to the Mah?bh?rata. He will be deeply missed but, as you have shown, his immense scholarly legacy will be with us forever.

Alf and I were old friends although we  sometimes disagreed on scholarly  issues  concerning the Mbh. We met in Poona (Pune) in the 1970-s and we and our  respective young sons, Simon, and Jesse became close friends. Some of my fondest memories of Alf are of sitting together with him in Mahabaleshwar reading  the Mah?bh?rata and Ram?ya?a in those days. Alas,  te hi no divas? gat?h. He will be missed by all who had the good fortune to know him. Still, na khalu sa uparato yasya vallabho jana? smarati.

Dear Mark, dear list members,

Thanks for updating on this very significant development.

Two small questions: your message, and the press release, say that this
donation "sets a precedent for the reversal of the common scenario whereby
such materials are taken out of their region of origin as part of the
antiquities trade, resulting in a significant loss of cultural heritage."
There are two issues here, buying antiquities on the market (or not), and
returning them to their place of origin (or not). As far as I can
understand, the objects in question must have been bought from antiquities
dealers and subsequently donated to the museum. Right? In that case, it's
laudable that the objects are "returned" to Pakistan (if that is where they
are from), but the "common scenario" of acquiring such objects through the
antiquities trade, and the moral and legal hazards that involves, is not
really reversed, is it? The buyer and the donor are of course left unnamed
in the press release, probably for this reason.

Second: I assume that the meaning of the sentence "The conservation,
photography, study, and publication of the manuscripts in the collection
will be undertaken by the Gandhari Manuscript Project" is that,
notwithstanding the donation of the physical manuscripts to the Islamabad
Museum, nobody outside of your group will have access to them until you
publish them first? If I wanted to see texts in this collection, could I
see them in Islamabad? Or could I ask the Islamabad Museum for
high-resolution photographs?

I of course don't mean to sound accusatory. It's just that the issues in
this case are very complex.

Andrew

Dominik pointed out the usefulness of regular expressions in searching for
variations in spelling etc.as in the website Saktumiva which has examples
of their use.  I'd also like to point out that the full power of regular
expressions can be used to search the Muktabodha searchable e-text library.
https://muktalib7.com/DL_CATALOG_ROOT/digital_library_secure_entry.htm

If you click "Help" it gives you instructions on how to search the library
with regular expressions. It gives a simple example of how to find all
lines in all texts that have both ?iva and ?akt? in the same line, but the
full power of regular expressions can be used including the examples shown
on the website Saktumiva .

Dear All,

To follow up on Harry Spier's query, the typesetting of the older Tamil characters (as well as Tamil Grantha) is sometimes problematic. I use Akshar Unicode for contemporary Tamil, which is very close to the standard printed characters, but insert some characters from Vaigai for the classical characters -- that were actually the standard characters when I grew up. For Grantha, the e-Grantamil font is nice even though less close to the characters in print, but the ligatures are sometimes undone automatically, for reasons that I do not understand. Also, I gather it is encoded in the same segment as Bengali, which is another source of confusion. The final output can be fine, though, see examples in the following paper:

https://www.persee.fr/doc/crai_0065-0536_2018_num_162_4_96658

This being said, if there is a better solution, I would be interested. 

For a diplomatic edition, it would be nice to have fonts that contain as many variants as possible. Similarly, Southern Sanskrit manuscripts should be reproduced in their original script if possible, especially in diplomatic editions. For instance, va and ba in printed Grantha are easier to disinguish than in Nagari (this is also true in those palm-leaf mss that I have used). 

I remember seeing proposals arguing that some characters usually encoded in Unicode as ligatures in Indic language fonts should be treated as stand-alone glyphs, at least in Tamil. The reason is that you sometimes see letters such as "mo" rendered as "kompu-(blank in a dotted circle)-lengthening mark-ma" which is of course nonsense. The placement of diacritics is also misleading at best, as was pointed out on this list a few days ago. This is in addition to the issues raised by Jean-Luc Chevillard (for instance, the ?? cannot be written without the lower diagonal stroke on some fonts).

Of course, whether one decides to overlook the differences in variants of one character always involves judgment. An extreme example would be the different versions of the character ? in the famous calligraphy ???? L?nt?ngj? X? by ??? W?ng X?zh?. For India, the ???????? ???? vinaayakar cu_li has slightly different forms depending on writers, some of which may be worth recording (recall that this symbol is a form of the pra.nava; the same issue could be raised about the pra.nava in other scripts).

Best,

Hello,

At the TST Project, where we're cataloguing Tamil manuscripts, we've 
forked Noto Tamil and started adding old ligatures, like pre-reform ??, 
??, etc. as well as some ligatures that don't seem to have appeared 
before in print, such as the below-base "ma" ligatures. See this page 
for examples:

    https://tst-project.github.io/editor/entities.html

It's still a work in progress!

Best,

Charles

Dear all,

as an additional contribution to the current debate,
here is my RAW transcription of folio 121r
inside Henrique Henriques's 16th century "Flos Sanctorum" alias ??????? 
?????? [a?iy?r varal??u], which was printed 1586 in Punnaykayal 
(following the spelling of Joseph Wicki).

A "benevolent interpretation" (in the words of Harry Spier) of the text 
of the /Flos Sanctorum/  was published in ???????????? [t?ttukku?i] in 
1967 by ?. ????????????? [c. ir?cam??ikkam].

The Vatican Library has made the 1586 original freely available at
https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.ind.24

In addition to my RAW transcription, I include as an attachment the 
image of the page, as downloaded from the Vatican web site.

In my transcription, you can see occurrences of the sequence "# # #"

I would be interested in hearing about other suggestions for FAITHFULLY 
reproducing this printed page, which seems to have been based on the 
writing practices of the time, when "BENEVOLENT" spelling systems were 
not available ...

Best wishes to all

Just a minor point. The quote referred to by Jean-Luc Chevillard which in
full is
"However, any manuscript transcript should be based on a benevolent
interpretation of the Sanskrit text transmitted in the witness"., is from
Philipp Maas not from myself.
Thanks,

Dear Harry,

yes indeed.

Thanks for the correction.

My apologies.

I include immediately below a link towards the message where you quoted 
Philipp Maas and wrote:

Dear Charles,

Nice project. Please let us know when the revised font will be 
available. Regarding the long ra, I assume you are planning to create a 
glyph for the character with a vinculum? (Or is it already there?) 
Similarly, the short ra is often written with a macron to avoid confusion.

One may want to include also the lines that are used to cover a pu.l.li 
(and thus, restore the vocalization).

Best,

 ???? Satyanad K.

 Schneider)
Message-ID: <0532d7a4-b669-5722-ad7f-162961dd8c94@oeaw.ac.at>

Dear colleagues,

this is to inform you of a new publication in the series "Sanskrit Texts 
from the Tibetan Autonomous Region" published jointly by the Austrian 
Academy of Sciences Press in Vienna and the China Tibetology Publishing 
House in Beijing:

Liu Zhen / Johannes Schneider: "Buddhist hymns : A New Collection"

Dear colleagues,

I am writing to ask if you can share the poster available through this link with prospective students:  https://tinyurl.com/minkowskiuoft. We are excited to be offering an in-person intermediate summer Sanskrit reading course this year at the University of Toronto taught by Prof. Christopher Minkowski.

The course will take place at the Mississauga campus from June 26 to August 10, 2023. There is no tuition. Students staying on-campus will receive a subsidy to cover part of the costs for room and board.

Interested candidates should apply by sending an unofficial transcript and 200-word statement about research interests to Aqsa Ijaz (aqsa.ijaz at utoronto.ca<mailto:aqsa.ijaz at utoronto.ca>) by April 15, 2023.

For more information about the course please contact me at ajay.rao at utoronto.ca<mailto:ajay.rao at utoronto.ca>.

Thank you,

Ajay Rao

Dear Satyanad,

as a clarification,
are you talking about the special forms seen in this image,
taken from a 17th cent. Goa MS
in the words which would nowadays be printed as
????????????, ???????, ??????????, ??????

(I obtained those images from Cristina Muru, many years ago)

Best wishes

Dear listmembers,

I am looking for a pictorial representation (along with the source) of 
the god Kartikeya with the following iconographic details:
One face,
four arms;
keeping a cockrel and/or an axe in two/one of his 4 hands
and riding on a peacock.

Can anyone help?

Dear Satyanad Kichenassamy,

Indeed, it would be welcome if you could show us examples of what you mean,
as it is not clear to me if you refer to three different things, namely,

- long ra with a vinculum
- short ra with a macron.
- line covering a pu??i.

It is also not clear to me what is the difference between "vinculum" and
"macron".


Besides examples of what I call "disambiguating macron" with ci??a ra (to
make clear it is not medial ?),

e.g.
[image: image.png] BnF Indien 220, f94r

and (even though in that case does not seem necessary to disambiguate, at
least for someone knowledgeable in Tamil)
[image: image.png] BnF Indien 220, f93r

it was used with other consonants

e.g.
[image: image.png] BnF Indien 216, f1r

[image: image.png] BnF Indien 220, f93r

[image: image.png] BnF Indien 220, f93r


but so far, I do not remember having met it with periya ?a.

Christina Muru also sent me examples where the "disambiguating macron" is
used above "e" and "o" to mark them as long "?" and "?":

With very best wishes

*Sacred Space in Modern and Contemporary ?atru?jaya Pa?as*


Paintings of Jain *t?rtha*s (sacred sites) have served as objects of
devotion, with the earliest extant examples depicting *yantra*s (mystic
diagrams), T?rtha?karas, and cosmic diagrams, dating back to the 15th
century. Among these paintings, *pa?a*s (cloth paintings) of ?atru?jaya
have garnered the most interest due to their large size, striking colors,
and iconographic representations. In this lecture, Dr. Hawon Ku examines
the ?atru?jaya *pa?a*s, particularly those from the late 18th and 19th
centuries. She argues that these Jain *t?rtha pa?a*s indicate changes in
the Jain community?s perception of ?atru?jaya. Specifically, during this
period, ?atru?jaya shifted from its traditional status as one of the five
important pilgrimage sites to becoming one of the most prominent sites for
?vet?mbar Jains. In addition to the traditional temples on ?atru?jaya,
contemporary *pa?a*s show a more extensive sacred space that includes a
depiction of the town of P?l?t??? and its recently constructed temples. In
the lecture, Dr. Ku explores these developments of ?sacred space? through
selected examples of *pa?a*s and discusses how the stylistic changes
reflect the rise of a modern Jain identity.

*Dr. Hawon Ku* is Associate Professor of Indian Studies at the Department
of Asian Languages and Civilizations, Seoul National University, Korea. She
was Visiting Scholar at SOAS, London (2018), and Assistant Professor at the
Department of Hindi at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (2011-2015),
following her PhD from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. She
currently teaches modern and contemporary South Asian art and culture, and
her recent research has focused on female patronage of paintings and
temples in modern India, including Jain temple architecture of the early
20th century.

Dear Jean-Luc, Dear Manu (if I may),

Indeed, I was talking about all of the forms both of you mentioned, namely

- long ra with a vinculum
- short ra with a macron. The macron may even be linked to the ra if one 
writes very fast.
- line covering a pu??i (to correct a mistake)

The first two enable disambiguation. It is not clear to me from a 
historical viewpoint whether they were introduced for the purpose, or 
whether they were natural evolutions (people do tend to link characters 
together when they write fast). The aesthetic dimension may also be 
relevant.

These are forms in use in my family. I am attaching a photograph with 
examples in my own handwriting. My parents used the same and, as I said, 
I have encountered them in manuscripts but didn't make a special note of 
them since these forms were familiar to me.

The vinculum is a line to "link together" several characters; 
mathematicians, especially British, used to write this over expressions 
as a substitute for a parenthesis. Thus, in (self-explanatory) LaTeX 
code, \overline{x+y} means (x+y). (This is consistent with the Latin 
etymology: a /vinculum/ is a link, /in vincula/ means in fetters etc.)? 
The first example seemed to me to be a vinculum rather than a macron 
since it links the two characters.

About the examples with e and o, it may be that the additional marks are 
sloppily written pu??i-s and not bars. I am referring to ?????????????, 
?????????????, ???????? 15-16 that read :

?????? ??????? ?????????? ???????
???? ????? ????????? ?????.

(For people who do not read Tamil, this means that consonants 
intrinsically stand with a dot, and that short e and short o have the 
same intrinsic feature. Tolkaappiyam is the first grammar of classical 
Tamil; it actually includes quite a bit of literary analysis in addition 
to grammar in the narrow sense and, as we see here, treats language as 
written as well as spoken.)

Kind regards to both,

 ??????? Satyanad K.

Attached are two extracts from a   bagal?mukh?pa?c??gam   manuscript  of
Shri Raghunatha Temple Library  (I've put a link to the full manuscript  at
the end of this email).
If you look at the first attached extract  you'll see that on the same
folio 4B the scribe has spelled the same word bindu as both  ????? and ?????
If you look at the second attached extract you'll see the scribe wrote  baga
l?mukh?/? 3 times with ???...  (one of those times mispelled with bal?...
not bagal?...)  and twice with ???... in the space of 5 folios.

Note: the blue highlighted is from me not from the original manuscript.

So what does that mean?
1) The scribe was a professional scribe who didn't know sanskrit but was
just copying existing errors or copying a difficult to read manuscript.?
or
2) It wasn't considered important  by the scholarly/religeous clients that
he conflated v and b because they were used to that and in any case they
knew sanskrit so it wasn't important to them?
or
3) Something else?

Dear Manu, dear Satyanad, dear Charles and dear list members,

if I understand correctly,
the nature of a vinculum is that it "ties together", by means of an 
overline, several items,
like in the example provided by Satyanad,
namely \overline{x+y}

However, sometimes, there is ONLY ONE element which is kept prisoner by 
the vinculum, as in the examples provided as screenshots taken from one 
of my books

+ the definition of a "rising factorial power"
	(on page x of Graham-Knuth-Patashnik[1994]
+ the binomial theorem for factorial powers
	(on page 245 of the same)

I include also a scan of the cover of that book, for easy identification
(ISBN 0-201-55802-5)

That would mean that a "vinculum" over a single letter
is longer that a "macron" over a single letter.

????????

PS : regarding e and o : if the examples do refer to long e and o, then the line should perhaps be interpreted as a correction over an existing dot.

 ?Dear Jean-Luc,

These are good points.

As you say, the vinculum expresses aggregation. If we have an aggregate 
consisting of one item, it is natural that it should sit above a single 
character. Another example is the horizontal line in $\sqrt 2$ (square 
root of two). The radix symbol consists of two parts: a vinculum and a 
symbol that looks like a V, actually a capital U in Latin. This V stands 
for "radix universalis", an earlier way to indicate aggregation in the 
argument of a root; its scope is clarified by the vinculum. The 
historical discussion is interesting but may not be of interest to most 
members of this list.

As you suspected, typesetters make a difference in length between the 
vinculum and the macron. Try compiling? a LaTeX file with $\overline{m}$ 
and $\bar m$ : the lines have clearly different lengths.

The term "vinculum" is rather rare in contemporary mathematical usage, 
because the vinculum was displaced by brackets, especially round 
brackets. The horizontal line occurs in restricted situations: in 
Boolean algebra, or to express complex conjugation, or the closure in 
topology, to name a few of them. In the notation of the interior (in 
topology) you do see a curved line that only means aggregation, with a 
small circle on top of it that indicates "interior". The vinculum is 
also found in elementary teaching in some countries, especially in 
India. "Bar", "horizontal line (over...)" are much more common ways of 
describing it.

In Philology, it may be useful to distinguish "vinculum", "macron" and 
"bar" in general, even though mathematical usage does not always do so. 
Thus, Charles Wells writes on p. 51 his "A Handbook of Mathematical 
Discourse", version 0.9 (Apr. 25, 2002):

bar : A line drawn over a single-symbol identifier is pronounced "bar". 
For example, $\overline x$ is pronounced "x bar". Other names for this 
symbol are "macron" and "vinculum".
He adds: "Acknowledgments: Atish Bagchi"..

Kind regards,

Dear Andrew,

Navigation of the complex issues alluded to in your post has required patient and intricate engagement, collaboration and negotiation over 5 years with a wide range of stakeholders across institutions and Government agencies in Pakistan in compliance with the Government of Pakistan Antiquities Act.

The project has an advisory board consisting of scholars with long experience in the field to provide policy guidance and governance on the wide array of issues with regards to open access, study, and publication. We will actively engage across the spectrum of specialists in Gandhari philology, textual studies, digital implementation, collections management and cultural heritage as the access and publication policies develop. Rest assured, therefore, that all qualified scholars in this field will have the opportunity to participate in the ongoing work on these materials.

Best wishes
Mark
(in consultation with members of the GMP Advisory Board and Management Committee)

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Gandhari Manuscript Project

Dear Mark, dear list members,

Thanks for updating on this very significant development.

Two small questions: your message, and the press release, say that this donation "sets a precedent for the reversal of the common scenario whereby such materials are taken out of their region of origin as part of the antiquities trade, resulting in a significant loss of cultural heritage." There are two issues here, buying antiquities on the market (or not), and returning them to their place of origin (or not). As far as I can understand, the objects in question must have been bought from antiquities dealers and subsequently donated to the museum. Right? In that case, it's laudable that the objects are "returned" to Pakistan (if that is where they are from), but the "common scenario" of acquiring such objects through the antiquities trade, and the moral and legal hazards that involves, is not really reversed, is it? The buyer and the donor are of course left unnamed in the press release, probably for this reason.

Second: I assume that the meaning of the sentence "The conservation, photography, study, and publication of the manuscripts in the collection will be undertaken by the Gandhari Manuscript Project" is that, notwithstanding the donation of the physical manuscripts to the Islamabad Museum, nobody outside of your group will have access to them until you publish them first? If I wanted to see texts in this collection, could I see them in Islamabad? Or could I ask the Islamabad Museum for high-resolution photographs?

I of course don't mean to sound accusatory. It's just that the issues in this case are very complex.

Andrew

Dear List members,

With the support of the Khyentse Foundation, a large collection of Gandhari birch bark manuscripts was donated to the Islamabad Museum, Pakistan, on 26 December 2022. The conservation, photographing, study, and publication of these manuscripts by the Gandhari Manuscript Project (GMP) will be carried out under the terms of an agreement between the (Federal) Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM), Islamabad, Pakistan, and the University of Sydney, Australia, that was signed on 20 December 2022. Both the Australian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, and the Pakistan High Commission in Canberra, Australia, assisted its passage.
     Although the collection is yet to be fully conserved, a rough estimate is that it consists of at least 50 to 60 scrolls or scroll fragments, which constitutes the largest collection of Gandhari manuscripts known to date. These manuscripts are thought to have originated from northern Pakistan and to date to between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE, although some manuscripts in the collection may well fall outside this range.
     The housing of these Gandhari manuscripts in Pakistan at the Islamabad Museum and their conservation there sets a precedent for the reversal of the common scenario whereby such materials are taken out of their region of origin as part of the antiquities trade, resulting in a significant loss of cultural heritage. In addition, this initiative will form the basis for collaboration with Pakistani scholars and for training Pakistani students in order to promote the conservation and study of such materials and the documentation of Pakistan?s rich Buddhist heritage.
     A more comprehensive account of the texts in the collection, their date and their significance, and of the collection as a whole, will be possible once all scrolls and scroll fragments have been conserved and an initial survey has been undertaken.
     For further details on the collection and the Gandhari Manuscript Project, see https://gandhari-texts.sydney.edu.au/gandhari-manuscripts/.
     The Khyentse Foundation recently posted notification on their website<https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/Y8GQC6XQ4LfPA6w12fp3ns-?domain=khyentsefoundation.org>.

Dear Colleagues and Friends,


We are delighted to announce a virtual colloquium on ?Interreligious Interactions in South Asia? that will take place over Zoom from April 3 to April 12, 2023 (15:00?16:30 GMT / 10:00?11:30 EST / 20:30?22:00 IST).



Zoom link: https://zoom.us/j/94189387595?pwd=Q0hvNDZvYjhDUVZOTHkxSWxNVGIyQT09
Meeting ID: 941 8938 7595
Passcode: 181402



We envision our colloquium to be brainstorming sessions for examining how interreligious interactions are analysed and theorised in diverse disciplines today, and in what ways historical sources and ethnographic data from South Asia elaborate such interactions. Our presenters have pre-circulated reading materials that would be helpful in understanding their arguments.

The Toronto Newar Summer School

June 5-16, 2023


Mon-Fri, 10:00 am-12:00 pm, 1:00-3:00 pm, 4:00-6:00 pm EST (depending on the module),

in person and online,


offers the opportunity to learn to speak the idiom encountered in the streets of Kathmandu, to access the vast medieval and early modern Buddhist and Hindu literature preserved in Classical Newar, and/or to delve into the writings of a thriving contemporary literary and academic Himalayan culture. Mentored by three teachers, participants will study modern conversational Newar in the mornings, as well as classical literary Newar and modern literary Newar in the afternoons. Participants may enrol in any one or in all three classes, depending on whether they want to focus on modern (spoken and written) or on literary (classical and modern) Newar.


Students at all levels are welcome, as each module will be offered on both the beginners and the advanced level. Beginners will receive a first exposure to the language, while intermediate or advanced students will have the opportunity to strengthen their skills. Applicants will be able to discuss their linguistic competence and academic needs at the time of application. Groups will be formed, and syllabi will be designed depending on the overall demand. Registration closes on March 31, 2023. The summer school will be offered in a hybrid format, both in person and online.


Participation is free of charge.


Please direct your informal applications and all enquiries to Christoph Emmrich at christoph.emmrich at utoronto.ca.


Our instructors are:


Srilaxmi Shrestha, M.A., an acclaimed private teacher of Newar and Nepali in Leiden, the Netherlands, will be conducting the modern conversational Newar class.


The modern literary Newar class will be taught by Dr. Bal Gopal Shrestha, one of the leading Nepalese anthropologists of Newar Buddhism, author of The Sacred Town of Sankhu (2012) and The Newars of Sikkim (2015).


UofT professor Dr. Christoph Emmrich, who teaches courses in Newar religion and literature, will be offering the classical Newar class.

Dear Andrew,

I am not part of Mark?s new project, but have been working on
several of these manuscripts as they have been emerging since
2002, and can maybe add some clarifications to your questions.

Unfortunately, not a single one of the many G?ndh?r? manuscripts
that have come to light since the 1990s has been the product of
proper archeological excavation, and this ?assemblage? (multiple
collections, possibly multiple findspots) is no exception. To my
knowledge, the dealer-collectors involved are mostly Pakistani,
but there is reason to think that at least some of the manuscripts
originate in Afghanistan (cf. Salomon 2020 [?Where are the
Gandharan S?tras??], 179: ?allegedly an ?old? collection belonging
to an unnamed party in Kabul?). It is to be hoped that now this
particular collection is in a public institution, there will also
be an opportunity to conduct provenance research on it.

I believe, as you seem to do, that photographs of such material
should be made universally accessible in a timely fashion, rather
than restricting access to ?qualified scholars.? Manuscripts like
these are part of the world?s shared heritage, after all, and
there is a wide variety of interest in them beyond the production
of the ultimate scholarly edition, including religious curiosity
and worship, and even uses that may seem frivolous to us ? like
basing art projects on them or putting reproductions on coffee
mugs ? are legitimate. The Library of Congress showed the way when
it recently put its scroll from the same assemblage online for the
global public:

   https://www.loc.gov/item/2018305008

(with the ultimate scholarly edition of it still in progress). It
is to be hoped that the Islamabad Museum will follow suit.

Meanwhile, Andrew Glass and I have been documenting this
manuscript assemblage since the first part of it became known in
2002 in our Catalog of G?ndh?r? Texts under (so far) the following
entries:

   University of Washington Libraries:

We look very much forward to more information becoming available
now that almost all the manuscripts in question are held in public
institutions.

All best wishes,
Stefan

Dear Friends,

I apologise for the gratuitous self-reflection, but I'm wondering about the
following information and if anyone might oblige me with an answer off
list.

I'm currently drafting a monograph application and have been asked by the
publisher if any of my articles on spoken Sanskrit/villages (and to a
lesser extent, my work on yoga) have made their way into any courses. I
have no idea, save beyond some anecdotal recollections of passing comments.
If it is feasible, information on the following points would be
greatly appreciated.


   - the course titles
   - an indication of the numbers in which they are run
   - a selection of the institutions which teach them
   - at what level, for eg:
   vocational/undergraduate/postgraduate/Continuing Professional Development
   - if possible, an idea of student numbers.


Thank you, in advance.

All the best,

Dear Colleagues,

May I gently and kindly remind you that I do not run the INDOLOGY forum.  It is run by a committee<https://indology.info/committee-members/>, and we members each take turns to be on duty for a week.  The address for queries is

  *   indology-owner at list.indology.info<mailto:indology-owner at list.indology.info>

I know I founded the forum and I'm closely identified with it, but please don't write to me directly on forum matters. I just have to bounce the message on to the committee, and that is time I lose.

You may see management emails from me or other individual committee members.  But that's just a spin of the wheel; we are replying on behalf of the committee merely as the member on duty at that time.

All this is on the INDOLOGY website<https://indology.info/contact/>.

Many thanks!

Dear Colleagues,

I assume most of us have seen Bernardo Bertolucci?s film Little Buddha. If you have not seen it, you may want to stop reading this email at this point, as I am about to spoil the plot with my question.

Have there been any historical cases of a t?lku being certified as having been reborn in more than one body at the same time? In the film, the three children who are candidates for the reincarnation of Lama Dorje are all determined to be his reincarnation. Is this based on any actual historical precedent?

I seem to recall this being the case, but I have searched in vain for the reference (if it does, indeed, exist).

Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to offer!

All the best,

Jeff

Dear list members,
I'm looking at the devanagari transcription of a south indian grantha
manuscript.  most consonent l's are the classical sanskrit l i.e. ? but
some words have the letter, ? .
Some examples are:
??????????

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

I'm pretty sure this isn't from typist misprints because ??????????
occcurs many times always spelled with ?

Any explanations would be appreciated.  My understanding is that sometimes
manuscripts were created by one scribe speaking the text and another scribe
writing what he hears.  Is that a possible explanation for the occurance of
this letter ? .  I.e. local pronounciation creeping in.

Thanks,

The recognition of multiple incarnations is not that uncommon, either historically or in the present day. Though normally it is not a question of a single authority certifying two or more people as rebirths of the same lama, but of several competing candidates being certified by competing authorities. This may be resolved by one of the candidates emerging over time as generally recognised, but it may also be resolved by negotiation leading to more than one being recognised.

The classic example there is the recognition of three candidates of the Shabdrung Rinpoche, the head lama and ruler of pre-modern Bhutan, as representing the body, speech and mind of the Shabdrung. The story is told in Michael Aris's Bhutan: The Early History of a Himalayan Kingdom (Aris and Phillips, Warminster, 1979, see pp.258-262 in particular).

The multiple reincarnations of the Mkhyen brtse, Kong sprul and Mchog gling lamas in the 20th century are another well-known example (see E. Gene Smith, Among Tibetan Texts, Wisdom Publications, Boston, 2001, pp.267-272; Orgyan Tobgyal, The Lifeof Chokgyur Lingpa, Rangjung Yeshe Publications, Kathmandu, 1988, pp.47-60). For more recent examples there are the multiple rebirths of bDud ?joms Rin po che or the 16th rGyal ba Karma pa. But there are quite a few others.

Best wishes

Geoffrey

I assume most of us have seen Bernardo Bertolucci?s film Little Buddha. If you have not seen it, you may want to stop reading this email at this point, as I am about to spoil the plot with my question.

Have there been any historical cases of a t?lku being certified as having been reborn in more than one body at the same time? In the film, the three children who are candidates for the reincarnation of Lama Dorje are all determined to be his reincarnation. Is this based on any actual historical precedent?

I seem to recall this being the case, but I have searched in vain for the reference (if it does, indeed, exist).

Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to offer!

All the best,

Jeff

Dear Indologists/Tibetologists,

Just to add to Geoffrey Samuel?s point above, some of the examples cited above (Khyentse, Kongtrul, Dudjom; other examples include the incarnation lineages of Jigme Lingpa and Dza Patrul Rinpoche) are not necessarily viewed as ?competing? from within the tradition ? though there are certainly competitive or even adversarial examples. 

At least in the Nyingmapa context with which I am most familiar, multiple tulkus are sometimes classified within the common fivefold system of ?body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.? So it is common to hear that X Rinpoche is regarded as the ?speech incarnation? while Y Rinpoche is regarded as the ?activity incarnation? of the same predecessor.

Dear Harry (if I may),

Retroflex l (?) is quite common in South Indian Sanskrit manuscripts and prints. For example, in the ?aiva K??c?m?h?tmya (a Sanskrit sthalam?h?tmya on the city of Kanchipuram), I find the following examples just in the first two chapterts: ??tal?a, yugal?a, uddh?l?ita, k?l?ik?, vakul?a, n?l?ikera, dal?a, ni?kal?a, sakal?a, kramel?aka, maul?i?

Sanskrit loanwords in South Indian languages also often reflect the pronunciation with retroflex l, e.g. the goddes K?l? is called ???? K??i (with retroflex l) in Tamil.

My impression is that there are certain words in which l is quite consistently replaced by retroflex l, while other words retain then ?normal? l. However, I have not been able to find any consistent pattern when l becomes retroflex ? any insights would be appreciated!

Another question is how retroflex l should be represented in Roman transliteration. The most straightforward solution would be ? (in analogy with ?, ?, ?, ?), which is also the character used for retroflex l in Tamil transliteration, but in IAST transliteration ? is already reserved for vocalic l (?). As you can see above, I have tentatively been using l? for retroflex l, but I would be happy to know if any other conventions have been used.

Best wishes,
Jonas Buchholz

Betreff: [INDOLOGY] ? in south Indian grantha sanskrit manuscripts

Dear list members,
I'm looking at the devanagari transcription of a south indian grantha manuscript.  most consonent l's are the classical sanskrit l i.e. ? but some words have the letter, ? .
Some examples are:
??????????

?????????????

???????????????????

???????????

????????

?????????????????????????

?????????????

??????????????????????????????????
I'm pretty sure this isn't from typist misprints because ?????????? occcurs many times always spelled with ?
Any explanations would be appreciated.  My understanding is that sometimes manuscripts were created by one scribe speaking the text and another scribe writing what he hears.  Is that a possible explanation for the occurance of this letter ? .  I.e. local pronounciation creeping in.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear Harry Spier,
I found the same in drama manuscripts written in Malay??am script. In  
particular Sanskrit words intervocalic l is replaced by ?. This usage  
persevers not only in all manuscripts, but also in the editions  
printed in Malaya??am script (see e.g. the edition of the ?Trivandrum  
Plays? ascribed to Bhasa of Bh?skaran, 1987).

In C?rudatta ascribed to Bh?sa we find for example ? in I.2a  
deha??n?m, I.13b baha?a-, I.13b -k???-, I.26.38 vi?ambase, III.8b  
kar??o, III.10b -k?ka???u, III.12d ni??a-, in D?tav?kya -ka?a?ka-  
35.1, -pra?aya- 47c and *49c, -la?it?- *47a.

So far, no one has been able to explain to me why the l has been  
changed to ? in these words, and consistently in every manuscript (and  
also in the printed edition). A possible explanation would be, as you  
suggest, that one scribe read the text and the other wrote it; but in  
some cases it is evident from the errors in the manuscripts that the  
text was copied and not written down by hearing. I am curious if  
someone from the list can give us an explanation.

Best wishes,
Anna Esposito

I was in course of stating more or less the same as Anna Aurelia about the Malayalam script manuscripts, observing the regularity of the use of the retroflex for peculiar words, which, I would add, usually preserve this peculiarity in their borrowing/inclusion within Malayalam language. The retroflex is systematically replaced by -l- in the Devanagari manuscripts which are transcripts of Malayalam script mss., with the problem that this retroflex can in fact also sometime be used for -?- (see below ja?a for ja?a etc.).
Contrasting examples are vi?ambita (cf. vi?ambase in Esposito's post) with a "forced" intervocalic -l-  > -?- after a prefixe (lamb- alone being written with l-), versus vilo?ita keeping the initial -l- of the theme after the prefixe. A more complete listing of the forms of the concerned words (from the apparatus in crit. ed. mentioning them) should be made for drawing linguistic conclusions. The references of Philipp Maas are useful in this respect.

Dear Jonas (if I may),

IAST, as you say, is not satisfactory. ISO 15919 is better in this 
regard, as it distinguishes ? and l?. IPA uses l? 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabic_consonant> for ?.

Best regards,

Dear all,

In Kannada, too, Sanskrit words are often written with a retroflex ? (? =
?) where we might have expected l (? = ?). The retroflex ? in Sanskrit
words is called by the name k?a?a (????) in K??ava's ?abdama?idarpa?am
(1260 CE). K??ava (or K??ir?ja, as he is also known) distinguishes this
sound from the retroflex ? found in Kannada words, called ku?a (???), which
is however written with exactly the same letter (?). K??ava further notes
that the k?a?a and ku?a (? = ?) can serve as equivalents for the sake of
pr?sa (second-letter alliteration), whereas the dental l (? = ?) cannot
alternate with either of them.

I don't know precisely (a) why K??ir?ja felt it necessary to distinguish
between the Sanskrit and Kannada retroflex ?; and (b) why the retroflex ?
(k?a?a) occurs optionally in some Sanskrit words, in some positions, and
not in others. Kittel in his *Grammar of the Kannada Language *pp. 14?15
<https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.23505/page/13/mode/2up>, ?30,
says: ?It is often used by Kanna?a people as a substitute for the Sa?sk?ita
? (= ?), the sound of which in the Sa?sk?ita language apparently bears a
dubious character for them, one that is neither their ? (= ?) nor their ?
(= ?); this ? (= ?) is K??ava?s k?a?a.? I interpret this to mean: whereas
Kannada clearly distinguishes a dental and retroflex lateral, Sanskrit does
not, and the Sanskrit lateral is pronounced somewhere between a dental and
retroflex position (kind of like the "dental" stops in most kinds of
American English), with some phonotactically-conditioned variation within
this range. The exact conditions of this variation remain a little obscure,
but K??ava does after all call the consonant k?a?a, which suggests that the
retroflexion is found (among other places) in those same contexts where
dental n is retroflexed to ?. Christophe's observation that retroflex ? is
not used word-initially accords with my impression of Kannada usage.

Hi everyone,

Since we're on the topic of Kannada and the retroflex ?, I was wondering 
if anyone has seen this weird Devanagari sign for "?a". I'm attaching 
two photos of the same passage from a Kannada commentary on the 
Amarako?a, the first one in Devanagari script (British Library IO SAN 
1758), and the second in Tigalari (IFP RE33635). The passage reads:

    gu??? | gu?aga?? |

As seen in RE33635, the last character is "??". But Devanagari scribe 
consistently uses a funny sign, a kind of ? with an extra hook, to 
transcribe this. Has anyone seen this anywhere else?

Best,

Charles

That's one more reason to revise IAST since the letter you mention (/?/) 
is the now standard transliteration for another letter, the Tamil ?? 
namely, the final letter of /Tami?.
/

The French used to have a different system that mixes lower and 
upper-case characters, but this system does not seem to be very popular 
anymore.

IAST, as its name indicates, is adapted to Sanskrit only. Another 
familiar issue is fact that e and o indicate long letters in IAST and 
short ones in Tamil, and in other languages that have these short letters.

>From a practical viewpoint, it would be nice to have versions in GRETIL 
and other repositories that are more inclusive, at least 
Tamil-compatible, since manuscripts containing Tamil and Sanskrit text 
together are plenty. S'aivism is an obvious example. For mathematics, 
especially in the Madhava school that produced extremely interesting 
results from the fourteenth century onwards, Malayalam and Sanskrit may 
be used concurrently, so that the same issue arises.

One should remember that in India, texts in several languages are very 
common, and that the problem was solved by having a different script for 
each language. Transliteration in such cases fails to reproduce an 
essential element of manuscripts. I remember a music composition that 
used four scripts.

We Indologists needs to be as inclusive as possible for obvious reasons.

Dear Satyanad,

indeed, as you point out, the IAST transliteration for Sanskrit and the standard Tamil transliteration are not really compatible, e/? and o/? being another case in point. Some Tamil transliteration schemes solve the problem by transliterating long e and o as e/o (as in IAST) and short e and o as ?/?, but of course that is completely illogical from the perspective of the Tamil language. ISO 15919 has the big advantage of being compatible with all Indic script and languages, but given that IAST has long been accepted as the standard for Sanskrit transliteration, I doubt whether Sanskritists would be willing to adopt a different transliteration scheme.

Best wishes,
Jonas

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Fwd: ? in south Indian grantha sanskrit manuscripts


That's one more reason to revise IAST since the letter you mention (?) is the now standard transliteration for another letter, the Tamil ?? namely, the final letter of Tami?.


The French used to have a different system that mixes lower and upper-case characters, but this system does not seem to be very popular anymore.


IAST, as its name indicates, is adapted to Sanskrit only. Another familiar issue is fact that e and o indicate long letters in IAST and short ones in Tamil, and in other languages that have these short letters.


From a practical viewpoint, it would be nice to have versions in GRETIL and other repositories that are more inclusive, at least Tamil-compatible, since manuscripts containing Tamil and Sanskrit text together are plenty. S'aivism is an obvious example. For mathematics, especially in the Madhava school that produced extremely interesting results from the fourteenth century onwards, Malayalam and Sanskrit may be used concurrently, so that the same issue arises.


One should remember that in India, texts in several languages are very common, and that the problem was solved by having a different script for each language. Transliteration in such cases fails to reproduce an essential element of manuscripts. I remember a music composition that used four scripts.


We Indologists needs to be as inclusive as possible for obvious reasons.

Dear Harry (if I may),

Retroflex l (?) is quite common in South Indian Sanskrit manuscripts and prints. For example, in the ?aiva K??c?m?h?tmya (a Sanskrit sthalam?h?tmya on the city of Kanchipuram), I find the following examples just in the first two chapterts: ??tal?a, yugal?a, uddh?l?ita, k?l?ik?, vakul?a, n?l?ikera, dal?a, ni?kal?a, sakal?a, kramel?aka, maul?i?

Sanskrit loanwords in South Indian languages also often reflect the pronunciation with retroflex l, e.g. the goddes K?l? is called ???? K??i (with retroflex l) in Tamil.

My impression is that there are certain words in which l is quite consistently replaced by retroflex l, while other words retain then ?normal? l. However, I have not been able to find any consistent pattern when l becomes retroflex ? any insights would be appreciated!

Another question is how retroflex l should be represented in Roman transliteration. The most straightforward solution would be ? (in analogy with ?, ?, ?, ?), which is also the character used for retroflex l in Tamil transliteration, but in IAST transliteration ? is already reserved for vocalic l (?). As you can see above, I have tentatively been using l? for retroflex l, but I would be happy to know if any other conventions have been used.

Best wishes,
Jonas Buchholz

Betreff: [INDOLOGY] ? in south Indian grantha sanskrit manuscripts

Dear list members,
I'm looking at the devanagari transcription of a south indian grantha manuscript.  most consonent l's are the classical sanskrit l i.e. ? but some words have the letter, ? .
Some examples are:
??????????

?????????????

???????????????????

???????????

????????

?????????????????????????

?????????????

??????????????????????????????????
I'm pretty sure this isn't from typist misprints because ?????????? occcurs many times always spelled with ?
Any explanations would be appreciated.  My understanding is that sometimes manuscripts were created by one scribe speaking the text and another scribe writing what he hears.  Is that a possible explanation for the occurance of this letter ? .  I.e. local pronounciation creeping in.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Thanks to everyone for the replies so far! The thought that the 
Devanagari scribe might be writing the vocalic ? with an "?" sign is 
pretty interesting, I didn't think of that! I'd be curious to know if 
anyone has seen the consonant ?a (?/?/?) written as a vocalic ?.

On RE33635, I also thought it was a weird Malayalam script at first, but 
the IFP catalogue describes it as Tigalari. In case anyone is 
interested, images of the full manuscript are available grace ? l'IFP, 
from their manuscripts database: 
https://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/online/manuscripts/

On IO SAN 1758, and on the text in general, which might be called the 
Karn??akapriya[vy?khy?na] of Lak?ma?a??str?, Colebrooke's catalogue 
entry transcribes the author's verses at the beginning:

Best,

Charles

More specifically related to Kerala (but still without historical explanation or systematical account) is the article of K. Kunjunni Raja, "Kerala Pronunciation of Sanskrit", Adyar Library Bulletin 25, 1961, pp. 461-476 - see on l/? the pp. 472-3 here attached.
The general question which arises in the case of "purely" regional texts is: should the critical edition of such texts adopt the regional spellings of Sanskrit, as given (all) in the (indigenous script) manuscripts, or shift to the normalized orthography. As reminded by Esposito, the printed editions in local scripts (for instance Malayalam) preserve these peculiar spellings of the local manuscripts.

I also don't see a pattern. For example this sentence from the manuscript I'm looking at:

??????? ??? ???????????? ???? Why ??? . . . but . . .?????. . .

Dear all,

In Kannada, too, Sanskrit words are often written with a retroflex ? (? = ?) where we might have expected l (? = ?). The retroflex ? in Sanskrit words is called by the name k?a?a (????) in K??ava's ?abdama?idarpa?am (1260 CE). K??ava (or K??ir?ja, as he is also known) distinguishes this sound from the retroflex ? found in Kannada words, called ku?a (???), which is however written with exactly the same letter (?). K??ava further notes that the k?a?a and ku?a (? = ?) can serve as equivalents for the sake of pr?sa (second-letter alliteration), whereas the dental l (? = ?) cannot alternate with either of them.

I don't know precisely (a) why K??ir?ja felt it necessary to distinguish between the Sanskrit and Kannada retroflex ?; and (b) why the retroflex ? (k?a?a) occurs optionally in some Sanskrit words, in some positions, and not in others. Kittel in his /Grammar of the Kannada Language /pp. 14?15 <https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farchive.org%2Fdetails%2Fin.gov.ignca.23505%2Fpage%2F13%2Fmode%2F2up&data=05%7C01%7Cchristophe.vielle%40uclouvain.be%7C010a2a6d1d9d4e0580d308db2c6e822f%7C7ab090d4fa2e4ecfbc7c4127b4d582ec%7C0%7C0%7C638152625371200345%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=6zP26X299xcrvTg1G1m8T5R8faN8G0JB6cZjXMApo8M%3D&reserved=0<https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farchive.org%2Fdetails%2Fin.gov.ignca.23505%2Fpage%2F13%2Fmode%2F2up&data=05%7C01%7Cchristophe.vielle%40uclouvain.be%7Ceb3ce3e7c9154aca648e08db2c840981%7C7ab090d4fa2e4ecfbc7c4127b4d582ec%7C0%7C0%7C638152717834631057%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=qxKxuNxgxo9FQQKVTtqoAhJwgGLeiNii1600rvbH55I%3D&reserved=0>>, ?30, says: ?It is often used by Kanna?a people as a substitute for the Sa?sk?ita ? (= ?), the sound of which in the Sa?sk?ita language apparently bears a dubious character for them, one that is neither their ? (= ?) nor their ? (= ?); this ? (= ?) is K??ava?s k?a?a.? I interpret this to mean: whereas Kannada clearly distinguishes a dental and retroflex lateral, Sanskrit does not, and the Sanskrit lateral is pronounced somewhere between a dental and retroflex position (kind of like the "dental" stops in most kinds of American English), with some phonotactically-conditioned variation within this range. The exact conditions of this variation remain a little obscure, but K??ava does after all call the consonant k?a?a, which suggests that the retroflexion is found (among other places) in those same contexts where dental n is retroflexed to ?. Christophe's observation that retroflex ? is not used word-initially accords with my impression of Kannada usage.

  <anna.esposito at uni-wuerzburg.de<mailto:anna.esposito at uni-wuerzburg.de>> a ?crit :

  Dear Harry Spier,
  I found the same in drama manuscripts written in Malay??am
  script. In particular Sanskrit words intervocalic l is replaced
  by ?. This usage persevers not only in all manuscripts, but also
  in the editions printed in Malaya??am script (see e.g. the
  edition of the ?Trivandrum Plays? ascribed to Bhasa of Bh?skaran,
  1987).

  In C?rudatta ascribed to Bh?sa we find for example ? in I.2a
  deha??n?m, I.13b baha?a-, I.13b -k???-, I.26.38 vi?ambase, III.8b
  kar??o, III.10b -k?ka???u, III.12d ni??a-, in D?tav?kya -ka?a?ka-
  35.1, -pra?aya- 47c and *49c, -la?it?- *47a.

  So far, no one has been able to explain to me why the l has been
  changed to ? in these words, and consistently in every manuscript
  (and also in the printed edition). A possible explanation would
  be, as you suggest, that one scribe read the text and the other
  wrote it; but in some cases it is evident from the errors in the
  manuscripts that the text was copied and not written down by
  hearing. I am curious if someone from the list can give us an
  explanation.

  Best wishes,
  Anna Esposito


  Zitat von Harry Spier via INDOLOGY <indology at list.indology.info<mailto:indology at list.indology.info>>:

  Dear list members,
  I'm looking at the devanagari transcription of a south indian
  grantha
  manuscript.  most consonent l's are the classical sanskrit l
  i.e. ? but
  some words have the letter, ? .
  Some examples are:
  ??????????

  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

  I'm pretty sure this isn't from typist misprints because ??????????
  occcurs many times always spelled with ?

  Any explanations would be appreciated.  My understanding is that
  sometimes
  manuscripts were created by one scribe speaking the text and
  another scribe
  writing what he hears.  Is that a possible explanation for the
  occurance of
  this letter ? .  I.e. local pronounciation creeping in.

  Thanks,
  Harry Spier

Dear Jonas,

It is not clear that IAST is that universal among us (Sanskritists). As 
Keith pointed out, many of us do use something like ISO 15919. I use 
IAST or ISO 15919 in my papers when I analyze Sanskrit texts, for the 
reason you gave. But I usually try to include if possible the text in an 
Indian script, preferably Grantha for South Indian texts, and Nagari 
otherwise, to avoid confusions.

What I was suggesting is that since GRETIL usually includes several 
versions of each text, it may be feasible to include one more version in 
a truly inclusive transliteration. As I said, this is necessary when 
considering South Indian mss, and possibly other mss.


Of course, IAST may have to evolve eventually. We do not use the same 
transcriptions as, say, Colebrooke even though he is still worth reading 
today. As ??????? (Pavananti) wrote,

?????? ???????? ??????? ?????????
?????? ??? ????? ????

(??????? ???)

(It is not wrong that the old should be discarded and innovations 
introduced for such is indeed the way of Time.)

Best regards,

Satyanad

Why be benevolent in the *transcription*?  One can, and should be
benevolent in the text of the edition.  That's a different text file.  But
I see no motive for being benevolent in the transcription.  Also, smoothing
out scribal quirks also erases the chance for future study of such scribal
features.  But mainly, I just can't see any point in not transcribing
diplomatically.

If, for the sake of argument, one had a special need for a MS transcription
that had b and v in the expected places, one could write a little grep
script to fix them all up.

Dominik

I expect many of us are beginning to see student essays that are partly or
wholly generated by chatGPT and friends.  Reading these is a strange
experience.  The texts are like a fever-dream of a real essay.  Almost
correct, often plausible, strangely vague, sometimes insanely wrong and
sometimes quite fantastical.   They are textual versions of the AI pictures
"woman laughing alone with salad
<https://www.eatliver.com/women-laughing-alone-with-salad/>," with two rows
of teeth and indeterminate numbers of fingers.

One of my favourite features is imagined bibliographies.  We all enjoyed
the hilarious fake indological bibliography in Lee Siegel's *Love in a Dead
Language*.  Now, chatGPT is producing its own almost-real bibliographical
entities.  E.g., from one of my students this term,

Are you being faced with fake bibliography entries like this?

Glad that I am retired. At Michigan, I did have some occasions when a
student would simply download someone's article, change the name and submit
it as his own work.

I'm surprised one thing has gone unsaid. Copyrights etc. permitting
wherever possible shouldn't a pdf of the original manuscript be published
with the e-text?

Are there on-line e-texts that also have a pdf or a link to the original
manuscript?

Looking through the Tamil Lexicon, I find k??i for the name of the goddess but not k?li. Similarly, pira?ayak?lam but no entry for piralaya. On the other hand, Sanskrit V?l? becomes only v?li, not v??i. It would seem that these usages are consistent and required in Tamil. It would be interesting to see whether such usages are seen in grantha manuscripts, and also to investigate how widespread and consistent they are in various South Indian languages. George

Few letters were removed, but this is the only one where differences are starkly noticed by the public, since this is part of common words like kallu (eyes) etc.

The retroflex ? in Sanskrit words is called by the name k?a?a (????) in K??ava's ?abdama?idarpa?am (1260 CE). K??ava (or K??ir?ja, as he is also known) distinguishes this sound from the retroflex ? found in Kannada words, called ku?a (???), which is however written with exactly the same letter (?). K??ava further notes that the k?a?a and ku?a (? = ?) can serve as equivalents for the sake of pr?sa (second-letter alliteration), whereas the dental l (? = ?) cannot alternate with either of them.

I interpret this to mean: whereas Kannada clearly distinguishes a dental and retroflex lateral, Sanskrit does not, and the Sanskrit lateral is pronounced somewhere between a dental and retroflex position (kind of like the "dental" stops in most kinds of American English), with some phonotactically-conditioned variation within this range. The exact conditions of this variation remain a little obscure, but K??ava does after all call the consonant k?a?a, which suggests that the retroflexion is found (among other places) in those same contexts where dental n is retroflexed to ?. Christophe's observation that retroflex ? is not used word-initially accords with my impression of Kannada usage.

All good questions, questions that are hard to study without a faithful
(not normalized) transcription.  For example, if you transcribe
diplomatically, you can produce a ratio of scribal bagal?s to vagal?s, and
that ratio might help with future manuscripts or if it turns out to be
unique to the scribe, it could be an identifier for other MSS copied by the
same person.

I'm not sure that a point I've been making all along has been sufficiently
noticed.  One has *two* files.  The first is the diplomatic transcription
(karmma, vindu, adhi???na).  The second is whatever one wants it to be, but
it's interpretative or normalized.  It can be benevolent, it can be a
critical edition, etc. etc.   Getting from file Diplomatic to file
Normalized may be partly algorithmic, but will probably be mostly manual.

There's absolutely no point in doing this general announcement, Matthew.
The committee gets behind sometimes, that's all.  Everything gets processed
in due course, and in order of arrival.  There aren't many of us and we're
all busy; we do our best. I'm delighted to say that Antonia Ruppel has
recently joined the committee, which will certainly help things forward.
Could I prevail upon you to join too?

From Wikipedia:

Devan?gar? is a compound of deva <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism)> (???) and n?gar? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81gar%C4%AB_script> (?????). Deva means "heavenly", "divine", or "deity".[20] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#cite_note-monier-21> N?gar? comes from ????? nagaram, a Sanskrit word meaning "town". Hence, devan?gar? can be translated as ?from the abode of divinity"

I think another reason, in addition to all the reasons you gave for what
you suggest. I.e.  "first is the diplomatic transcription"  and only then
to create a "normalized" file, is that deciding whats normal is sometimes a
judgement call . There may be more than one norm. For example:
Monier-Williams dictionary has pattra and chattra but Apte's dictionary has
patra and chatra .

Hello Harry,

     Many cases like *patra/pattra *are instances of optional doubling of
consonants in certain environments. To the extent, this doubling is
optional, a dictionary may need to make a choice of which alternative to
list.  The prevalence of doubling or lack of it is also sometimes related
to the regional or other preferences. For example, more doubling is common
in the tradition of the ?ukla-Yajurveda, so much so that the Nirnaya Sagara
Press needed special fonts to print the pothi of ?ukla-Yajurveda.

Dear Dominik,

Yes, the fact that most students (and the general public) do not understand
what language modeling is or how it works indeed leads to entertaining
productions. I have received papers on Plato's *Phaedrus *that include
quotations "from the text" that are wholly invented by chatGPT. "Plausible"
is perhaps the best word for the text thus produced.

Best,
Tyler

Dear Dominik,

Phillip wrote to me after the group message and sent instructions. I understand that the address change may take a few days.

The problem is not the delay - that is understandable. But as it stands, one has no idea whether one's message has indeed been received or if it's landed in a black hole.

It would perhaps be useful to set up an automatic reply to this effect:
"Thank you for your message. Be assured that it has been received and will receive a reply in due course. We apologize if there is a delay, but there is no need to renew your message."

In any case, thank you for all you have done to keep this thing going over the years.

best regards as ever,
Matthew

The problem is not the delay - that is understandable. But as it stands, one has no idea whether one's message has indeed been received or if it's landed in a black hole.

It would perhaps be useful to set up an automatic reply to this effect:
"Thank you for your message. Be assured that it has been received and will receive a reply in due course. We apologize if there is a delay, but there is no need to renew your message."

In any case, thank you for all you have done to keep this thing going over the years.

best regards as ever,
Matthew

There's absolutely no point in doing this general announcement, Matthew.  The committee gets behind sometimes, that's all.  Everything gets processed in due course, and in order of arrival.  There aren't many of us and we're all busy; we do our best. I'm delighted to say that Antonia Ruppel has recently joined the committee, which will certainly help things forward.  Could I prevail upon you to join too?

Best,
Dominik

Hi Madhav,
There was a fascinating discussion of this in Feb. 1999 (24 years ago!) in
which you played a prominent part. The thread started as "A simple question
for sanskritists
https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/1999-February/015767.html
and continued as "On 'patra/pattra' again"
https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/1999-February/015789.html

Dear Colleagues,

Professor Sylvain Brocquet has asked me to post on his behalf the
announcement below.

With all best wishes,
Isabelle Rati?

*Acad?mie des langues de l?Inde (ALI)*

Une branche l?Acad?mie des langues anciennes, Universit? d?Aix-Marseille ?
CNRS)

Chers auditeurs,

La session 2023 de l?Acad?mie des langues de l?Inde se tiendra ? la Maison
m?diterran?enne des sciences de l?homme, Aix-en-Provence, du lundi 10
juillet au samedi 15. Les quatre premi?res journ?es seront compos?es de
trois s?ances pl?ni?res d?une heure trente, chacune consacr?e ? une langue,
et d?un atelier au choix, dans la langue que chaque auditeur choisira
d?approfondir. Le vendredi 14 juillet sera ch?m?, mais se terminera, pour
ceux qui le souhaitent, par un repas convivial. Le samedi 15, n?auront lieu
que les s?ances pl?ni?res.

Cette ann?e, seront enseign?s le sanskrit classique (Sylvain Brocquet), le
sanskrit v?dique (Carmen Spiers) et, bien que cela ne soit pas encore
d?finitivement organis?, le pali. Il se peut que les cours de pali soient
remplac?s par des cours de sanskrit classique et v?dique, portant dans ce
cas sur des textes diff?rents ? ce qui permettrait par cons?quent d?aborder
deux genres litt?raires diff?rents.

Il est demand? aux auditeurs de savoir lire couramment la N?gar? et de
poss?der les bases grammaticales du sanskrit classique. Les cours
consisteront dans la lecture raisonn?e de textes, ? l?occasion de laquelle
seront faits tous les rappels grammaticaux ou historiques n?cessaires ? la
compr?hension. L?exp?rience a montr? que la participation aux m?mes
lectures collectives de participants ayant des ? niveaux ? tr?s vari?s en
langue ne constitue pas un obstacle, bien au contraire : une ?troite
coop?ration entre les lecteurs, assist?s par l?enseignant, permet ? chacun
de progresser de fa?on sensible ? partir de ce qu?il sait. Quelque temps
avant le d?but de la session, chacun des inscrits recevra un ensemble de
documents : textes de lecture, notes explicatives, ?l?ments de grammaire,
?ventuellement traductions (en fonction des langues et des textes),
bibliographie, documents scann?s ou liens permettant d?y acc?der sur le
r?seau. Il lui est demand? de pr?parer la session en s?effor?ant de lire
tout ou partie des textes ainsi envoy?s.

La participation ? la session de l?Acad?mie est gratuite. Il sera
simplement demand? ? chacun d?adh?rer ? l?Acad?mie des langues anciennes,
sous l??gide de laquelle se tient celle des langues de l?Inde (co?t de
l?adh?sion : 15 ?).

Par ailleurs, il convient de s?inscrire d?s ? pr?sent, par courriel adress?
? Sylvain Brocquet ( sylvain.brocquet at orange.fr ), en indiquant son nom,
son adresse postale et son adresse ?lectronique, son num?ro de t?l?phone,
son statut (?tudiant en?, doctorant, universitaire, auditeur libre?) et la
langue choisie pour l?atelier. La date limite pour les inscriptions est
fix?e au 30 avril.

Dans l?attente de vos r?ponses, souhaitant vous voir nombreux cette ann?e,

Bien cordialement

Sylvain Brocquet

I am almost certain that we had a discussion on this list about this
question, in the course of which it was mentioned that (1) "D?van?gar?" is
a relatively late term, and (2) "N?gar?" is certainly the earlier term, but
the reason for applying that name to the script is not definitely known. It
seems that the INDOLOGY archives can now only be searched back to 2021 (?).
Anyway, I did not succeed in finding the discussion, but the etymology from
Wikipedia is certainly wrong.

Dear Alakendu, Dan and Andrew,

there is an article on the topic by Walter Maurer:

   Walter H. Maurer. 1976. On the Name Devan?gar?. Journal of the
   American Oriental Society 96, 101?104.

According to Maurer, the older and more widely current form of the
name is N?gar?, first attested in the 11th century in al-Biruni
(as, apparently, ?N?gara?). Whether this referred to ?city script?
in general (in contrast to what?) or to a particular city remains
unclear. The oldest attestation of the extended form Devan?gar?
that Maurer could find appears in 1776 in Halhed?s Code of the
Gentoo Laws, possibly to ?sanctify? the script and/or to
distinguish it from lesser varieties of the script family.

All best,
Stefan

Quite.  In the Su?ruta Project
<https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start>'s edition we've
gone with geminated consonants (karmma, kartt?) and some other odd sandhi
choices (eva? gu?am) because they are sanctioned by P??ini.  It's going to
make our edition a bit odd for readers who are used to smoothed-out
Sanskrit.  But it's grammatically correct.  And that's another editorial
assumption: we assume that our author(s) know grammar.  That can also be
tricky, if we think there are maybe some dialectical features appearing.
Luckily, the SS is a good example of classical Sanskrit.  Separating error
from dialect or language drift, the BHS problem, is extra challenging.

Best,
Dominik

This is a continuing source of irritation. Our archive of indological
discussion goes back to 1990, and we must reinstate it as a searchable
resource.  However, with positive support and efforts from our current
Mailman company, and several attempts with different approaches and ideas,
we've been unable to get it working well.  I am myself not certain what the
problem is.  It may be a combination of the archive being unusually large,
and having been encoded using different character encoding standards at
different times.  Whatever the problem, we haven't forgotten about it.  One
day, one of us will put some resources into the problem and get it up and
running again.

Dominik,
Could you tell us a little more about saktumIva (saktumiva.org).  The
website tells us what it does, but I couldn't find a page that gave some
history of it, who its principals were etc.
*Saktumiva* is a platform for producing and publishing critical editions of
Sanskrit texts. Users can produce transcriptions of documents, such as
manuscripts or printed editions, and then automatically collate them to
produce an apparatus of variants.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indology list archives text file
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o-8L_ueHDK6N6=xrfXoHJ8qmK+ncOc+VPv4qUEUxVYgmA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
A while ago I created a text file for my own use of the Indology list
archives that can no longer be searched.  I posted a Wetransfer link to
that file.

Since this issue is coming up again I've again uploaded this text file of
the archives to Wetransfer.  The link to download this is:
https://we.tl/t-SvMXgz1tI7  Note: Wetransfer only keeps this link active
for 10 days so if you want it, download it soon.

Note also that because the file is so big most text editors are extremely
slow when searching  it.  A text editor for windows that was able to search
it reasonably quickly was Textpad from www.textpad.com

Hi,

I think that this archive can be stored in Github for free, and updated
yearly. It is very small.

That's me!

Saktumiva is part of an ongoing effort to produce critical editions 
starting from diplomatically* transcribing manuscripts. Then, at the 
collation stage, common orthographic variants are filtered out 
automatically ? this can be configured depending on what you want to see 
in your apparatus. The idea is to keep as much information intact as 
possible, so that later scholars can reproduce the work and easily 
critically evaluate the decisions that went into it.

Here is a shameless plug for a text that I recently edited in this way, 
the story of King ?ibi in the /Vahnipur??a/:

    https://alt.cardiffuniversitypress.org/articles/10.18573/alt.58

The article is accompanied by a digital edition, here:

    https://tst-project.github.io/siberupakhyana

The digital edition includes diplomatic transcriptions of every witness, 
alignments of every verse in the text, and images of the manuscripts or 
printed books that are transcribed, where possible. The idea is that the 
work should be reproducible, like "Real Science" ? following a series of 
steps, you should be able to either reproduce that text that I've 
critically edited, or else make different decisions that will give you a 
different text. (I imagine I'm not the only person who has struggled 
with interpreting a critical text, only to spend ages tracking down the 
sources and finally discovering that the editor just misread an ak?ara.) 
Making all of the material available will also hopefully make it easier 
for scholars to re-use the work in the future, whether for simple text 
mining, or analyzing text reuse, or for creating new critical texts.

Best,

Charles

*As the foregoing conversation demonstrates, transcription is inherently 
an interpretive act, and scholarly practice with respect to diplomacy 
varies widely. But even mechanical reproduction is inherently 
interpretive ? for example, colour calibration in photography, and this 
famous case of photocopier error:

Dear Colleagues,



I am pleased to announce the publication of



Berthold Delbr?ck, Altindische Syntax. Corrected and newly typset edition,
with an Index locorum to the Rigveda, by Andreas Pohlus.



Berthold Delbr?ck (1842-1922), the founder of comparative syntax of
Indo-European languages, published his Old Indian Syntax in 1888,
describing the stage of language that the grammarian P??ini calls Vedic,
that is, the language of the Vedic Sa?hit?s and Br?hma?as. Delbr?ck
presents this with admirable thoroughness on the basis of the texts
available to him. First, he treats the basic sentence structure and word
order, and then examines the parts of speech in more detail. The whole is
always supported by extensive text excerpts, almost all of which are
translated, and is made accessible by a word, subject, and references
index. The present edition is a completely new edition, taking into account
Delbr?ck's own additions and corrections. The new edition follows the
transcription of the Sanskrit used today, and the occasional corrigenda and
addenda are marked as such.

Dear Members,

In Keith's translation of the TS (Part Two, p. 453, n. 6) I stumbled on 
a reference to:

Hillebrandt /Thiere und G?tter im vedischen Ritual /(Breslau, 1905)

I looked a little bit everywhere on the Net but so far I am not able to 
find it.

If anyone knows where to locate it, or better has a pdf of this title, I 
would greatly appreciate.

Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o8985aJJFO_misvC5ef3qDnYp0rEoTQXVSB0k75P_t3oQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I've been asked to find out how vedic priests  pronounce the AdigAyatrI
mantra (Rg-veda 3.62.10).  I've found it on a website online with accent
marks and compared it to the Rg-veda (see attachment).  But I've been told
that some of the svarita accents are dIrgha-svarita (i.e. a two note
pronounciation medium followed by high).

Can someone tell me which svarita accents in the mantra are dIrgha-svarita.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

I imagine much the same approach as Sebastian Nehrdich is using for his
language models could be applied to the evolution of pronunciation over
time, much like a 21st century Saussure. If anyone has any such initiative
underway I would be very interested in contributing.

Dear Harry,

     Theoretically, every Svarita is a combination of ud?tta+anud?tta [or
ud?ttatara+anud?tta in some schools]. This transition from ud?tta to
anud?tta becomes much more noticeable in the case of long vowels, and this
is what gets designated as a long Svarita. In the case of the G?yatr?
verse, vowels in the syllables ??, ?? and ?? would qualify to be pronounced
as long Svaritas. The long Svaritas are not as prominent in Maharashtrian
Vedic recitation as they are in South India. This is my observation.

Thank you Madhav.
It is the Maharashtran pronounciation I'm interested in.

Dear Madhav and other members,
The only place I've ever seen long svarita marked is in some chanting books
(both devanagari and transliteration) for the Rudram. Has anyone seen the
long svarita (in devanagari and transliteration looks like double quotes
above ) marked in any other texts than the Rudram?
Thanks,
Harry Spier

Subject: Colloquium on ?Interreligious Interactions in South Asia,? April 3?12, 2023


Dear Colleagues and Friends,



We are delighted to announce a virtual colloquium on ?Interreligious Interactions in South Asia? that will take place over Zoom from April 3 to April 12, 2023 (15:00?16:30 GMT / 10:00?11:30 EST / 20:30?22:00 IST).



Zoom link: https://zoom.us/j/94189387595?pwd=Q0hvNDZvYjhDUVZOTHkxSWxNVGIyQT09

Meeting ID: 941 8938 7595

Passcode: 181402



We envision our colloquium to be brainstorming sessions for examining how interreligious interactions are analysed and theorised in diverse disciplines today, and in what ways historical sources and ethnographic data from South Asia elaborate such interactions. Our presenters have pre-circulated reading materials that would be helpful in understanding their arguments. If you would like to consult these reading materials, please email: trinbarua at gmail.com.

Dear list members,
The Wetransfer link I set up to download a file of the Indology archives up
till May 2022 https://we.tl/t-SvMXgz1tI7 expires tomorrow. It was
downloaded 60 times. But Dominik Wujastyk has informed me that he's found a
permanent home for this file at:
https://zenodo.org/record/7779013
