Dear All,

Please see the message below from Dr. Nathan Gilbert at the Classics
Department in Durham University about a workshop on K?lid?sa's *?akuntal?*.
It would be very nice to have scholars of early India and K?lid?sa
aficionados as audience members!
Thank you.

Dear All,



I am pleased to announce a workshop on perhaps the most famous Indian play,
K?lid?sa?s *?akuntal?*. This event is part of the launch of a new research
centre in the Department of Classics and Ancient History at Durham,
CLAWS (Centre
for Language and Writing Systems - Durham University
<https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.durham.ac.uk%2Fresearch%2Finstitutes-and-centres%2Fcentre-for-language-and-writing-systems%2F&data=05%7C01%7Csarkarb1%40live.lancs.ac.uk%7C9fd580b309584990579408db49dfd9d2%7C9c9bcd11977a4e9ca9a0bc734090164a%7C0%7C0%7C638184998009167644%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xGwCK4%2FSzdzKQjZGlRidoKFEoP0EA83r9Sba5%2B6CvT0%3D&reserved=0>),
which supports research on the languages and cultures of Antiquity, broadly
conceived. We hope that this event will be of interest to both scholars of
Sanskrit and Classicists: many of the themes explored in the workshop, e.g.
the reworking of traditional epic material, the changing depictions of
women across time and genre, and the Colonial reception of the play, are of
great interest from a comparative angle. The papers will be followed by a
response from a specialist in Greek drama, who will reflect on the themes
of the conference as well as the possibilities for comparative scholarship
and the value for expanding what we mean when we talk about ?Classics? to
include key examples from the early Indian literary canons.



The workshop will be held over two half-days (June 29th-30th) in the Ritson
Room of the Department of Classics and Ancient History (38 North Bailey,
DH1 3EU), with an option for online participation. The schedule is as
follows:

Sesame oil is absolutely everywhere in Ayurvedic literature.  And as Paturi
pointed out, there's a fourteenth-century metarule presented by
??ra?gadhara that "oil" means "sesame oil" unless otherwise stated.  No,
I'm not aware of any name similar to /sesame/ that isn't a loanword.

Watt is always good:

If one knew where to look, there is probably more up-to-date information
from genetics about the very early history and distribution of the plant.

Best,
Dominik

My experience with the libraries that Oppert listed is that one has to
actually go to the locations and ask local families if any of the
manuscripts are still extant.  Some may have been folded into the TMSSML in
Thanjavur, but you have to go there too, in practice, to see any
manuscripts.  Copies of MSS in the TMSSML are only given with the
permission of the District Collector, usually a busy, non-academic
political appointee.  There can be a bit of bias too about Sanskrit (rather
than Tamil) materials, so diplomacy is advised.  Some family collections
may also have been absorbed by other major cultural centres such as
Kumbakonam, though I don't have any info on that.

See some of the papers in

   - Rath, S., ed. (2012) Aspects of Manuscript Culture in South India
   (Brill?s Indological Library). Leiden: Brill.

PS There are interesting references to sesame use and trade passim in

   From the Stone Age to the 12th Century. 7 ed. New Delhi: Pearson.

And

   - Joseph, Tony. 2021. Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and

cites the literature about sesame being exported from the Harappan
civilization to Mesopotamia.

Dear List members,

I am looking for the text of stanza 2054 of the C?vakacint?ma?i (Ka?aka vel?iy??u, reprint 1967). Of this text I have only the first part (1-1556) and I could not find the second part on the Madurai Project. Maybe I did not look properly. In any case, I cannot believe the second part is not available there. I hope someone on the list will be able to tell me where I might find the second part.

With kind regards, Herman.

Hi friends,

     Please let me know how to type tilde on ?, ?, ?, ?, and ?. I had made
provision for this in my pre-Unicode Manjushree-CSX font, but it no longer
works. I can use the ABC-Extended font to get the tilde on basic vowels,
but that font is now allowing me to type the tilde on long vowels. I am
sure there is a way to do this. Let me know if you have found a way. Best,

Dear Madhav,

Type option + a then option-shift + n ? that should produce ??. The same for the other long vowels.

Slight clarification: option+a then a, then option-shift n; option+a then o, then option-shift n for ??; etc.

Dear Madhav,

I'm afraid, I can't help you with your actual question about producing the
combinations, as I use different keyboard sequences. But in order to
achieve these combinations, your font needs to support combining diacritics
and stacking. These days, most modern Unicode fonts support these features,
but not every font out there. I can recommend Junicode.

Best wishes,
Arash

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Avagraha (or lack of) in Kashmiri manuscripts
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o8B8UMB4D-WF3dUdVRNZOuH7bYJzzTf4vaO3VRA4LA8yw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I'm looking at the manuscript aj??nadhv?ntad?pik? by soman?tha?
As far as I can tell there are no avagrahas in the manuscript.
For example if you look at the end of line 5 on the attached 1st folio

The end of verse 5 is ??????????????????????????????????????? ?
Anirban Dash (and several others pointed out that this should be

???????????????????????????????????????? ?

As far as I can see there are no avagrahas  anywhere in the manuscript.
Is this normal or unusual for Kashmiri manuscripts not to use avagraha.

The manuscript can be downloaded from egangotri on archive.org from
https://archive.org/details/AgyanDhvantaDeepikaShriSomnath4966Alm22Shlf4DevanagariTantra_201708

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Dear Professor Tieken,

Dr. P. Pandiyaraja has been creating a wonderful magnificent concordance for Tamil literary texts, where you can find the whole text for c?vakacint?ma?i. 

Here are links that might be useful for your search:

Dear Rajam and Pandiyaraja Paramasivam,

Thank you very much for the links. The concordance is a very important complement to the existing indexes, the Pondich?ry one and the one by Lehmann and Malten. I am ashamed that I did not know of its existence, but then, as a sanskritist, I move on the fuzzy edges of Tamil studies. Thank you very much again, Herman

Dear Harry,

The use of avagraha to mark elision of an initial short a is not usual in Sanskrit mss. MacDonell,  for example,  says in his Sanskrit Grammar for Students (page 5):

The elision of ? a at the beginning of a word is marked in
European editions with the sign ? called Avaagraha ('separation'); e.g. ????? te 'pi for ?? ??? te pi.

Best wishes,

Elliot

Thank you Elliot,
I've been going through transcriptions of a group of manuscripts from the
Ragunath Temple, Jammu and in the eloquent words of Charles DiSimone who
replied offlist in describing some Nepalese manuscripts, its a mishmash.

Some don't have have avagraha. Some have one or two in a whole manuscript
and some use avagraha.  Where manuscripts use avagraha to elide a afte e or
o they also use avagraha to indicate ?+a .

But in some cases I'm finding avagraha in places strange places. I've
checked these following cases against the actual manuscripts which are in
archive.org.  For example:

dak?i??m?rtisa?hit? ??????????????????????????????????? ?????? ?? 4 ??
folio 21a???? ??????????? ?? ?????? ???? ?????? ?? 43 ?? folio 55b

 kaul?rcanad?pik?
 ????????????????? folio 43b?????? ?? ????????????????? ????? ? ??????
? folio 57a

mudr?prak??a? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? folio 11a?????
?????? ????????? ????????????????????? ?? 2 ?? folio 18a?????????????
?????? ?? 2 ?? folio 21a??????????????????? ????? ?????? ?????? ????
??? ??? ???????????????? ?? 19 ?? folio 30a

Any explanation for the use of avagraha in these cases would be appreciated.

If anyone wants to look at the actual manuscript I can provide the images
for these cases.

21a??????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????? ??
19 ?? folio 30a

Any explanation for the use of avagraha in these cases would be appreciated.

If anyone wants to look at the actual manuscript I can provide the images
for these cases.

It was suggested offlist that the unusual avagrahas may be used as a gap
filler.  At his request I'm attaching a pdf of the folios with the unusual
avagrahas circled.
Thanks,

With sorrow I inform the list-members that Albrecht Wezler, Emeritus Professor
of classical Indology, Universit?t Hamburg, passed away last month.

Prof. Wezler was never active on this list; but many
listmembers will still have met him and experienced his warm
and impressive personality; others will have encountered his
publications, covering with incisive intelligence a vast range of areas
within (mainly) Sanskrit studies.

Dear Harry,

The *avagraha* in the Devan?gari manuscript seems to follow the trait of
Sharada manuscripts in which the *avagraha* functions as a sandhi mark
<https://symbl.cc/en/111C9/>. So, it has a broader use than just being used
in cases of an *abhinihita *sandhi.

SO SORRY to hear this sad news. I had numerous contacts with Albrecht; he visited Austin several times, and once stayed at our house. One can truly say that he may have forgotten more things than I every knew. He read my entire translation of the Artha??stra and made comments and critique almost at every s?tra, and commented on my Manu edition and translation as it was being developed. I am eternally grateful to Albrecht for his generous help. Rest in peace.

Thank you Deepro,
What you say makes sense, that it is a copy of a Sharada manuscript
carrying over the characteristics of the original.
On a broader point, I've seen  courses on manuscriptology advertised many
places over the years, so I'm wondering if there are any books that have
been written on manuscriptology that cover all these practical issues that
come up when you look at actual manuscripts.

You are most welcome.

I cannot think of any single book that covers all such issues. You can
check some of the volumes of Studies in Manuscript Cultures
<https://www.csmc.uni-hamburg.de/publications/smc.html>. Some volumes are
particularly dedicated to Indic manuscripts, such as Volume 10: Bidur
Bhattarai's Dividing Texts: Conventions of Visual Text-Organisation in
Nepalese and North Indian Manuscripts
<https://www.csmc.uni-hamburg.de/publications/smc/smc10.html>. For the
Kashmiri manuscripts, I would recommend Michael Witzel's 1994 article "Kashmiri
Manuscripts and Pronunciation
<https://archive.org/details/kashmiri-manuscripts-and-pronunciation-witzel>
".

I agree with Deepro about the absence of any good, comprehensive book.  But
to add to the readings, I would mention some lesser-known sources:

   - Grierson, George Abraham. 1916. ?On the Sarada Alphabet.? The Journal
   of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 677?708.
   http://www.jstor.org/stable/25189479.

   - Mukhopadhyaya, Bijayanath. 1985. Administration of Manuscript

I am deeply saddened to learn about the passing of Albrecht Wezler. As my teacher in Hamburg, he had a significant impact on my academic journey, imparting invaluable knowledge with his profound expertise and meticulous philological attention to detail. He played a crucial role in opening doors to various career opportunities for me. It is thanks to him that I had the opportunity to come to Nepal and lead the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project (NGMPP), where I could combine my passion for textual studies with field research.

I am particularly grateful to Albrecht Wezler for his remarkable openness to different approaches to Indian culture and history. His generosity in embracing alternative perspectives has left a lasting impression on me. I will always cherish the memories of his mischievous sense of humor and his genuine care and warmth in numerous aspects of our interactions.

My thoughts are with his family, friends, and all those who were fortunate enough to know him.

This is very sad news indeed - Albrecht Wezler was a remarkably gifted
scholar who made important contributions to Sanskrit studies in general and
the history of Indian philosophy in particular. He also had a delightful
sense of humour, and as no doubt many others, I did experience his warm and
impressive personality, in Harunaga's apt words, as well as his great
kindness to young researchers.

I think the best and most comprehensive book not yet mentioned, which 
covers more than its title suggests, is:

Katrin Einicke, Korrektur, Differenzierung und Abk?rzung in indischen 
Inschriften und Handschriften, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2009.

If I remember correctly, the author also discusses the use of sandhivigraha.

Best,
Lubomir

The table of contents downloadable from the Harrassowitz site provides good
orientation on the degree of coverage of Indian scripts and auxiliary
characters used in inscriptions and manuscripts.

Please see also Prof von Hin?ber's review in the IIJ:

Perhaps this is also a nice chance to remind everyone of the existence of
this journal and invite your contributions ;)

Here are my humble suggestions:

*Kaul?rcanad?pik? 43b*

Avagraha erroneously placed after, instead before, *ya?*: *loko ya?* ? ? *loko
?ya?*



*57a*

The two dots written on top of each other (visarga) were misread or
accidentally misspelled (or simply give the wrong impression through
blurred ink) as being an avagraha:

*mok?a?sy?d* ? *mok?a? sy?d*



*Dak?i??m?rtisa?hit? 21a*

As above (*57a*):

*??i?sy?d* ? *??i? sy?d*



So apparently also *55b*.



*Mudr?prak??a?* *11a*

Appears to indicate word separation



*21a/30a*

Word separation and/or exegetical function: separating the conditional
clause (*yadi sy?d*) from the main clause.



Similarly *18a*: separating the scope of *iti* from the definiendum.


Regards,

WS

I remember him as one the brightest minds I have ever met. But he was not only a great scholar, he was also a warm and exquisite person. It is a great loss for all of us.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Elucidation of Poetic Blemishes
Message-ID: <CAETY2G0dSsJjGQv=z_R=u=YED-TLwdzEwa=uGSJQAkCGK_mF8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

On behalf of a colleague who is not a member of the list, would anyone
happen to be able to share a pdf of Jha's *An Elucidation of Poetic
Blemishes in the Vyaktiviveka. *It seems it was once on archive.org (cf.
http://prakrit.info/mahima/) but has been removed. Hopefully someone
managed to download it before it vanished.

All the Best,
Victor

This is sad news, indeed. Though I had never met him and did not ask him to, Prof. Wezler gave my dissertation a close read and provided me learned and supportive comments throughout. I will always be grateful to him.

This is very sad news indeed - Albrecht Wezler was a remarkably gifted scholar who made important contributions to Sanskrit studies in general and the history of Indian philosophy in particular. He also had a delightful sense of humour, and as no doubt many others, I did experience his warm and impressive personality, in Harunaga's apt words, as well as his great kindness to young researchers.

I am deeply saddened to learn about the passing of Albrecht Wezler. As my teacher in Hamburg, he had a significant impact on my academic journey, imparting invaluable knowledge with his profound expertise and meticulous philological attention to detail. He played a crucial role in opening doors to various career opportunities for me. It is thanks to him that I had the opportunity to come to Nepal and lead the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project (NGMPP), where I could combine my passion for textual studies with field research.

I am particularly grateful to Albrecht Wezler for his remarkable openness to different approaches to Indian culture and history. His generosity in embracing alternative perspectives has left a lasting impression on me. I will always cherish the memories of his mischievous sense of humor and his genuine care and warmth in numerous aspects of our interactions.

My thoughts are with his family, friends, and all those who were fortunate enough to know him.

I have fond memories of Albrecht Wezler, among other reasons that he
graciously hosted me in Hamburg long ago, I think around 1988. I also
treasure the complete set (three volumes) of the rare *Kharosthi
Inscriptions *of Bjoyer, Rapson, and Senart which he generously gave me
(and which he in turn had received from L. Alsdorf). I still use them
constantly and remember Albrecht when I do.

Thank you to all the knowledgeable people who answered both on and
off-list. Sven Ekelin, Deepro Chakraborty, Dominik Wujastyk, Lubomire
Ondracka,  Wlater Slaje, Jonathan Silk, Sweta Prajapati, Charles DiSimone,
Elliot Stern, Charles Li.

I wonder if this folio 6a from aj??nadhv?ntad?pik? (attached) also from
Ragunath temple in Jammu like the other manuscripts, confirms that the
devanagari manuscripts are copying Sharada originals. This is the only
avagraha in the entire manuscript(circled with a blue line).  I had thought
this was an insert, but looking at a Sharada font, this appears to be the
position and size of the Sharada avagraha.  So maybe the scribe just absent
mindedly wrote it in the way it was in the Sharada original.

I think that is very likely.  My book *Metarules of Paninian Grammar* was
partly based on Raghunatha MSS and they were definitely copied from ??rad?
originals.  I discussed the reasons in my introduction.  For example,
several character-pairs are confused, that are similar in ??rad? but quite
different in Devan?gar?.

Best,
Dominik

Still available at a reasonable price for indological books:
https://www.amazon.com/Metarules-Paninian-Grammar-Paribhasavrtti-Critical/dp/812083982X

Also the  Sharada unicode font I was looking.  at was a google unicode font
Noto Sans Sharada . So if anyone needs a Sharada font the link is:
https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Sharada

But I noticed from this font that unicode Sharada has one code point for
avagraha (#11c1) and another for Sharada sandhi mark (#11c9) and in this
font the two characters are identical (same size, same shape, same
position).  In manuscripts are Sharada avagraha and sandhi mark identical?
If so it seems strange that unicode has two different code points based on
the usage of this one sign.

How did you find that? They seem different to me, avagraha is spacing and the sandhi mark is non-spacing, smaller and lower, as expected:

 



 

The Google Fonts specimen website shows them different too:

My book Metarules of Paninian Grammar was partly based on Raghunatha MSS and they were definitely copied from ??rad? originals.  I discussed the reasons in my introduction.  For example, several character-pairs are confused, that are similar in ??rad? but quite different in Devan?gar?.

 

Still available at a reasonable price for indological books: https://www.amazon.com/Metarules-Paninian-Grammar-Paribhasavrtti-Critical/dp/812083982X

 

Also the  Sharada unicode font I was looking.  at was a google unicode font Noto Sans Sharada . So if anyone needs a Sharada font the link is:https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Sharada

 

But I noticed from this font that unicode Sharada has one code point for avagraha (#11c1) and another for Sharada sandhi mark (#11c9) and in this font the two characters are identical (same size, same shape, same position).  In manuscripts are Sharada avagraha and sandhi mark identical?  If so it seems strange that unicode has two different code points based on the usage of this one sign.

I wonder if this folio 6a from aj??nadhv?ntad?pik? (attached) also from Ragunath temple in Jammu like the other manuscripts, confirms that the devanagari manuscripts are copying Sharada originals. This is the only avagraha in the entire manuscript(circled with a blue line).  I had thought this was an insert, but looking at a Sharada font, this appears to be the position and size of the Sharada avagraha.  So maybe the scribe just absent mindedly wrote it in the way it was in the Sharada original.

Here are my humble suggestions:

 

Kaul?rcanad?pik? 43b

Avagraha erroneously placed after, instead before, ya?: loko ya? ? ? loko ?ya?

 

57a

The two dots written on top of each other (visarga) were misread or accidentally misspelled (or simply give the wrong impression through blurred ink) as being an avagraha:

mok?a?sy?d ? mok?a? sy?d

 

Dak?i??m?rtisa?hit? 21a

As above (57a):

??i?sy?d ? ??i? sy?d

 

So apparently also 55b.

 

Mudr?prak??a? 11a

Appears to indicate word separation

 

21a/30a

Word separation and/or exegetical function: separating the conditional clause (yadi sy?d) from the main clause.

 

Similarly 18a: separating the scope of iti from the definiendum.

Thank you Elliot,

I've been going through transcriptions of a group of manuscripts from the Ragunath Temple, Jammu and in the eloquent words of Charles DiSimone who replied offlist in describing some Nepalese manuscripts, its a mishmash.

 

Some don't have have avagraha. Some have one or two in a whole manuscript and some use avagraha.  Where manuscripts use avagraha to elide a afte e or o they also use avagraha to indicate ?+a .

 

But in some cases I'm finding avagraha in places strange places. I've checked these following cases against the actual manuscripts which are in archive.org <http://archive.org> .  For example:

dak?i??m?rtisa?hit? 
??????????????????????????????????? ?????? ?? 4 ?? folio 21a
???? ??????????? ?? ?????? ???? ?????? ?? 43 ?? folio 55b
 
 kaul?rcanad?pik?
 ????????????????? folio 43b

mudr?prak??a? 
???????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? folio 11a
????? ?????? ????????? ????????????????????? ?? 2 ?? folio 18a
????????????? ?????? ?? 2 ?? folio 21a
??????????????????? ????? ?????? ?????? ???? ??? ??? ???????????????? ?? 19 ?? folio 30a

Any explanation for the use of avagraha in these cases would be appreciated.

If anyone wants to look at the actual manuscript I can provide the images for these cases.

Dear Harry,

 

The use of avagraha to mark elision of an initial short a is not usual in Sanskrit mss. MacDonell,  for example,  says in his Sanskrit Grammar for Students (page 5):

 

The elision of ? a at the beginning of a word is marked in

European editions with the sign ? called Avaagraha ('separation'); e.g. ????? te 'pi for ?? ??? te pi.

 

Best wishes,

Dear list members,

I'm looking at the manuscript aj??nadhv?ntad?pik? by soman?tha? 

As far as I can tell there are no avagrahas in the manuscript. 

For example if you look at the end of line 5 on the attached 1st folio

The end of verse 5 is ??????????????????????????????????????? ?  
Anirban Dash (and several others pointed out that this should be 
???????????????????????????????????????? ?  

As far as I can see there are no avagrahas  anywhere in the manuscript.

Is this normal or unusual for Kashmiri manuscripts not to use avagraha.

 

The manuscript can be downloaded from egangotri on archive.org <http://archive.org/>  from  https://archive.org/details/AgyanDhvantaDeepikaShriSomnath4966Alm22Shlf4DevanagariTantra_201708

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Early history of computation and Sanskrit literature

Dear Friends,

A colleague is working on exploring any possible direct or indirect links (also through Persian, Greek or Arabic translations of primary Sanskrit works) between the early development of computers and any known Sanskrit literature (specifically in the domains of ny?ya, p??ini, ga?ita??stra).

Did any of the key known figures Jacquard, Boole, Babbage, De Morgan et. al. have any influence from concepts that were existing in Sanskrit works?

If there are any scholars who have specifically explored this that would be interesting too.

I have already reached out to Dr. Geoffrey Hinton the great-great-grandson of Mary Everest Boole, who reported no known links that he is aware of.

With warmest wishes,

Martin

Dear Martin,

i would direct your colleague to the work of Dhruv Raina, and notably to
 Raina, Dhruv. 2022. ?Transcultural Networks and Connectivities: The Circulation of Mathematical Ideas between India and England in the Nineteenth Century.? Contemporary Education Dialogue 19 (1): 84?106.
Marie Jos? Durand Richard who has worked on the network of the English Algebraists, has shown that they were curious of Sanskrit scholarship and were in contact with indologists, notably H. T. Colebrooke?her work is referenced in the above article..both Dhruv and Marie Jo are easy to contact, and I?d be happy to help your colleague get in contact with them.

Hi Harry and other Indologists,

There was another thread about this topic recently but I am struggling to
find the name of that thread. Forgive me for not being able to provide the
link at this time.

I am by no means an expert on this matter, so someone else please correct
me if I am mistaken... but as I understand it, the recent rulings *specifically
and exclusively pertain to copyrighted material* that the IA has scanned
itself and now *offers on a "check out" basis to a single user at a time*.

As I understand it, *the ruling does not pertain to material on the IA that
is NOT under copyright, material for which the copyright has lapsed, or
material that has otherwise entered into public domain via any other avenue*.
As I understand it, these materials will remain as they are, freely
available through IA -- no changes.

Am I interpreting this correctly?

In my usage of the IA, I have only ever used this "check out" function two
times: for the Pedurma edition of the Kagyur/Tengyur and for a Pedurma
edition of the Taranatha Sungbum. The vast majority of the sources I access
on IA are in the public domain or otherwise not under copyright.

Of course, just because I have only used the "check out" function sparingly
does not mean the same is true for others. I am curious about how often
other Indologists on this listserv access copyrighted material on IA using
the "check out" function? Do others foresee any major obstacles to their
current research methods as a result of these court rulings?

Personally, I use the check-out system at the Internet Archive quite a lot, both for the Pedurma edition and other Tibetan texts not available via the BDRC, and for many other items, either because they are not available through the local library system (I live in Sydney, Australia ) or because it is much faster to check a reference online via Internet Archive. It is very much part of my research method and much valued. It would be a major loss if the case against them is upheld.

And I am in a relatively privileged position regarding library access compared to many scholars, e.g. in South Asia.

Sincerely

Geoffrey Samuel

That looks like it, Harry. I thought more people had chimed in but I guess not. 

Geoffrey: I am sorry to hear that your research methods might be significantly impacted by these rulings. As you certainly will remember, these materials used to be freely available directly on TBRC/BDRC, and they only recently switched over to the IA check out system for those works. I wonder if Jann or anyone else at BDRC has any backup plans for the Pedurma material and other copyrighted works. Otherwise, I wonder if IA will be willing to pay the eBook licensing fees. 

Has anybody heard any word from IA and/or BDRC about their next steps, other than the general public statements about their disappointment with the ruling(s)?

 .
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o9WgwmjBuKffbmpVd5NJ_vt6WgdiZkTbDubkFS8AU_Qew@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

The Muktabodha Indological Research Institute and the Institut Francais de
Pondichery have entered into a new collaboration whose objective is to
produce etexts of 75 manuscripts of Shaiva works over the next 3 years.
These will be focused on works expounding the doctrines of the Shaiva
schools of theology, and works of ritual.

The etexts are being produced by the staff of the IFP under the direction
of Dr. Deviprasad Mishra. The funding is provided by Muktabodha, India.
These etexts will be added to the Muktabodha digital library as they are
produced.

As part of this project the following 10 manuscript bundles have now been
added to the Muktabodha digital library and can be accessed from this link.
https://muktalib7.com/DL_CATALOG_ROOT/digital_library_secure_entry.htm

Note also that the original manuscripts can be viewed in the IFP manuscript
database.  The easiest way to locate these manuscripts in the IFP database
is by the manuscript number: 31158, 32407 etc.
The link to the IFP  manuscript database is:
https://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/online/manuscripts/login.php


The new manuscripts from this project, now added to the Muktabodha digital
library are:

 IFP manuscript 31158 ???rv?daparampar?, samudrasn?navidhi, k?laprak??ik?,
sudhivilocana

IFP manuscript 32407 ?ivasahasran?mastotra, uttarapi?h? ?dityapur??a

Dear Professor Olivelle,

At long last I am getting around to finishing a paper on the B?had?ra?yaka.
I can't tell you how many times a week I bless you and thank you for the
enormous work you have done in translating, introducing and annotating the
early Upani?ads. There are many things one couldn't even begin to do with
several major texts if you hadn't laid the foundations with your
painstaking scholarship.

As for MLBD and MRML, they have freely printed, published, cut and pasted
Indological works originally available in non-Indian editions for so long
that I don't think anyone notices, cares or minds any more, not even the
authors or whoever the original holders of copyright. If it didn't incense
our videshi colleagues so much, I guess it could be argued that it is
merely the age-old practice of dispensing with attribution, continued
through modern means!

Warm regards,

Ananya.

Dear Harry,

Thanks for the news. It appears that only Sanskrit manuscripts are 
considered in this project. Is this deliberate ? Of course, since Tamil 
sources deal mostly with philosophy, and often downplay ritual, one may 
understand that people interested in "theology" may not find in them 
what they seek.? My best wishes to this project.

Maybe we need another project on the ??????????????.? When the goal is 
to understand Tamil philosophy, it is not reasonable to separate the 
Sanskrit from the Tamil material, because each sheds light on the other.

I suppose everyone on the list knows that the Tamil and Sanskrit sources 
do not represent the same doctrine, that Tamil scholars are usually 
knowledgeable about Sanskrit, and that they have good reason to disagree 
with the interpretation of those, including native speakers of Tamil, 
that are not conversant with Tamil philosophy [see Journal Asiatique, 
*306* (1) (2018), 85-99, especially the new discussion of the relation 
between the two versions of the ???????????].

Tamil philosophy (I see no other adequate term in English) has had a 
distinguished history in Tamil Nadu for many centuries, to this day and, 
more important, seems to contain original analyses that do not seem to 
be not available in any other language, as a perusal of the (Tamil 
version of the) ??????????? shows.

There are quite a few sources of manuscripts, even in France, so that 
there is no fundamental obstacle to such a project, that actually would 
continue Jean Filliozat's program, continued by Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat 
and others.

Best,

 ???????????? Satyanad Kichenassamy

Dear Indology Colleagues,

Speaking with a colleague, recently, who is not subscribed to this list, a question arose as to the first works translated from an Indian language into a Western one (including Dutch, Portuguese, Latin, French, English, Italian, Spanish, German, etc.).

I am of course aware that Charles Wilkins rendered the Bhagavadg?t? into English at a relatively early date, I believe in 1785.  I found reference to 1789 for William Jones's translation of the Abhij??na??kuntala.  Before these there was a rendering (into Dutch and not first into Latin, though there was a dispute evidently over this fact) of Bhart?hari's poems by Abraham Roger/Abraham Rogerius, posthumously in 1651.

Could anyone provide more and/or better information about the history of the translation of Sanskrit texts and works of other Indian source languages into Western/European languages?

Thank you.

Sincerely,
John

Though slightly akimbo of your question (since it is genre specific), the Upani?ads first made it into Latin through Anquetil-Duperron?s retranslation (1801-02; also into French but unpublished) of a Persian translation. The Aitareya Up. into English was Colebrooke in 1805. Anquetil-Duperron often enough gets credited with ?the first religious text translated into a Western language? but clearly that isn?t the case. I was always taught Wilkins was the very first, but never investigated that myself.

Cheers,

Dear John,

It's a good question that could have different answers depending on your
"parameters" -- particularly the question of direct vs. mediated
translation. Anquetil-Duperron's translation of the Upani?ads, for
instance, as Prof. Lindquist just mentioned, was translated from the
Persian version of Dara Shikoh.

A more extended case of such mediation could take us back to the Middle
Ages, when the *Pa?catantra *was translated into Latin via Pahlavi and
Arabic (there under the title *Kalila wa Dimna*). From Latin, the *Pa?catantra
*quickly found its way into numerous other European languages: according to
Edgerton (1924), it was certainly extant in Greek, Spanish, Italian,
German, English, Slavonic languages, etc., before 1600. Olivelle (2009)
offers a general trajectory of Sanskrit --> Pahlavi --> Arabic --> Syriac
(10th/11th c.) --> Greek (11th c.) --> Latin; there is also another
fascinating trajectory from Sanskrit --> Pahlavi --> Arabic --> Persian -->
Spanish (ca. 1251) and Hebrew (12th c.) --> Latin (between 1263-1278). The
life of the Buddha has a comparable trajectory, eventually becoming the
story of *Barlaam and Josephat* via Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and other
languages.

In the vein of Abraham Rogerius, early Christian missionaries were of
course active from the early 16th c., particularly the Jesuits. It's
well-known that they were translating in the other direction (translating
Christian materials into Indian languages), but I'm just not familiar
enough with the materials to know about the earliest translation in the
other direction. The 1610 (and onwards) Portuguese translations that Prof.
Vielle mentions are certainly noteworthy in this vein. I have encountered
mention (I believe by Will Sweetman) of an *An?dipur?**?**a *that a Brahmin
convert to Christianity, Manuel d?Oliveira, partially translated into
Portuguese via Marathi/Konkani, ca. 1558 (mostly episodes from the
*Mah?bh?rata* and *R?may??a*).

Adding a different kind of ambiguity to your question is when Europeans
would themselves patronize translations into *Persian*, which would then
later find their way into European languages. Rosanne Rocher (1983, pp.
48-72) tells us of Warren Hastings' commission of a Persian translation of
the *Viv?d?r?avasetu*, then translated into English by Halhed as *A Code of
Gentoo Laws* in 1776. This is just one of numerous European-commissioned
translations in this time period that were mediated by Persian (see Carl
Ernst, "Muslim Studies of Hinduism?," 2003).

Hope this helps,
Shankar

Since Wicki 1958 is not available online (?; limited view at https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007325462 ), I join the table of contents where is to be found the (c. 1610-30) Portuguese renderings of the story of Harizcandra, of a version of Vikrama's Adventures (or the thirty-two tales of the thrones), and of various tales (from some versions of the Pa?catantra, but also said from the MBh and even the ViP). Unfortunately, from the second part of the MS in Latin language, Wicki has edited only the doctrinal beginning (not translated/adapted from native texts) and the very end which is the translation of a few moral zlokas. There remains to be edited the ff? 132-171 with extracts from the MBh etc.

Dear John,

As long as the medieval transmission of the Pa?catantra was mentioned, one might as well throw in Barlaam and Josaphat, probably more a retelling than a translation of a life of the Buddha, that was transmiited in virtually every language from Pahlavi and Arabic versions of the story to Georgian and Armenian, and thence to Greek, Hebrew, Amharic, Catalan, Icelandic and many others. The literature on this is now very extensive.

all best,
Matthew

Olivelle (2009) offers a general trajectory of Sanskrit --> Pahlavi --> Arabic --> Syriac (10th/11th c.) --> Greek (11th c.) --> Latin; there is also another fascinating trajectory from Sanskrit --> Pahlavi --> Arabic --> Persian --> Spanish (ca. 1251) and Hebrew (12th c.) --> Latin (between 1263-1278). The life of the Buddha has a comparable trajectory, eventually becoming the story of Barlaam and Josephat via Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and other languages.

About Shankar Nair's reference to a "mention (I believe by Will Sweetman) of an An?dipur??a that a Brahmin convert to Christianity, Manuel d?Oliveira, partially translated into Portuguese via Marathi/Konkani, ca. 1558 (mostly episodes from the Mah?bh?rata and R?may??a)".
More precisely, dating from that early time (1558-60),  there remains two Portuguese summaries (not real translations) of this Ana?dipura?n?a (ascribed to Namdev), both in manuscripts. One is to be found in a Portuguese (Evora) manuscript referred to by W. SWEETMAN  ?The Absent Vedas?, JAOS 139/4, 2019, p. 783 fn. 8; the other summary is in a similar ms. in Rome (ARSI Goa ms.) where there is also to be found a Portuguese adaptation of the 13th chapter of the Marathi Jn?a?nes?vari?, and the Livro de Datatraia or Hiogirazatalicu, viz. an adaptation of Amr?ta?nanda's Yogara?jat?il?aka, again a Marathi work. (on the contents of these two, similar, manuscripts, see Panduronga S. S. PISSURLENCAR, ?A propo?sito dos primeiros livros maratas impressos em Goa?, Boletim do Instituto Vasco da Gama 73, 1956, pp. 59-61: http://memoria-africa.ua.pt/Library/ShowImage.aspx?q=/BIVG/BIVG-N073&p=75 ). See here attached the article of J. WICKI, ?Old Portuguese Translations of Marathi Literature in Goa: c. 1558- 1560?, Indica 12, 1975, pp. 22-26, who unfortunately was not able to edit, as promissed (at the end of this article), these early translations/adaptations.

Dear John,

It's a good question that could have different answers depending on your "parameters" -- particularly the question of direct vs. mediated translation. Anquetil-Duperron's translation of the Upani?ads, for instance, as Prof. Lindquist just mentioned, was translated from the Persian version of Dara Shikoh.

A more extended case of such mediation could take us back to the Middle Ages, when the Pa?catantra was translated into Latin via Pahlavi and Arabic (there under the title Kalila wa Dimna). From Latin, the Pa?catantra quickly found its way into numerous other European languages: according to Edgerton (1924), it was certainly extant in Greek, Spanish, Italian, German, English, Slavonic languages, etc., before 1600. Olivelle (2009) offers a general trajectory of Sanskrit --> Pahlavi --> Arabic --> Syriac (10th/11th c.) --> Greek (11th c.) --> Latin; there is also another fascinating trajectory from Sanskrit --> Pahlavi --> Arabic --> Persian --> Spanish (ca. 1251) and Hebrew (12th c.) --> Latin (between 1263-1278). The life of the Buddha has a comparable trajectory, eventually becoming the story of Barlaam and Josephat via Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and other languages.

In the vein of Abraham Rogerius, early Christian missionaries were of course active from the early 16th c., particularly the Jesuits. It's well-known that they were translating in the other direction (translating Christian materials into Indian languages), but I'm just not familiar enough with the materials to know about the earliest translation in the other direction.

Adding a different kind of ambiguity to your question is when Europeans would themselves patronize translations into Persian, which would then later find their way into European languages. Rosanne Rocher (1983, pp. 48-72) tells us of Warren Hastings' commission of a Persian translation of the Viv?d?r?avasetu, then translated into English by Halhed as A Code of Gentoo Laws in 1776.

Thank you for this additional information, Prof. Vielle. I at last tracked
down my source, which is another Will Sweetman contribution, "Reading
Jesuit Readings of Hinduism," in *Jesuit Historiography Online* (Brill).
The details I provided were slightly off, so better to consult Prof.
Sweetman's own words:

"In 1558, a text called *An?dipur?**?**a* was seized from the house of a
prominent Hindu during the festival of Divali. The following year, a
Brahmin who had converted and taken the name Manuel d?Oliveira stole a
collection of books from another Brahmin living in the hinterland of Goa.
Copies were sent to Europe, together with translations made by d?Oliveira.
The copies extant in Europe include texts in both Marathi and Konkani,
mostly episodes from the Mah?bh?rata and R?may??a, as well as the
translations into Portuguese. These texts, together with the *An?dipur?**?*
*a*, became important sources for the Jesuits in Goa. As well as being put
to use in Goa in sermons against the Brahmins and as sources for the
accounts of Indian religion in Jesuit histories by Alessandro Valignano
(1539?1606) and Sebastiam Gon?alves (1555??1619), they were also used for
vocabularies like those composed by Diogo Ribeiro (1561?1635) and Miguel
d?Almeida (1610?83 or 1687) and as models for Christian works in Marathi
like Thomas Stephens?s (1549?1619) *Discurso sobre a vinda de Jesu
Christo* (1616)?the
so-called *Kristapur?**?**a?*and Etienne de la Croix?s (1579?1643) *Discursos
sobre a vida do Apostolo Sam Pedro* (1629)."

Greetings All,

I am pleased to announce the publication of mymonograph: 

The Festival of Indra: Innovation, Archaism, and Revival ina South Asian Performance. SUNY Series in Hindu Studies. Albany: SUNYPress

The Festival of Indra?details the textual and performative history of animportant South Asian festival and its role in the development of classicalHinduism. Drawing on various genres of Sanskrit textual sources?especially theepic?Mah?bh?rata?the book highlightsthe innovative ways that this annual public festival has supported the stableroyal power responsible for the sponsorship of these texts. More than just atextual project, however, the book devotes significant ethnographic attentionto the only contemporary performance of this festival that adheres to theclassical Sanskrit record: the Indrajatra of Kathmandu, Nepal. Here, Indra'stall pole remains the festival's focal point, though its addition of the royalblessing by Kumari, the "living goddess" of Nepal, and the regularpresence of the fierce god Bhairav show several significant ways that ritualagents have re-constructed this festival over the past two thousand years.

?Thisvaluable and ambitious work covers an important and understudied ritual formthat has a long South Asian history, the Indra Festival. This festival isparticularly interesting historically, since it falls between the Vedicsacrificial models of ritual in the earliest period and the image?puja modelsof later temple Hinduism. Baltutis approaches the topic as an Indologist,historian, and ethnographer, and the resulting book represents a significantcontribution to South Asian religious studies.? ? Richard H. Davis, author of?The Bhagavad Gita: A Biography 

Ordering information can be found here: The Festival ofIndra. 

Best,
Michael

This is of course an excellent idea, Prof. Kichenassamy.

All that is needed is the leadership of someone like yourself, raising the
money to hire people to do the work, and creating a formal relationship
with some organization where the work can fruitfully be carried out.

I think it would be wonderful if you could do this.  Just as it is
wonderful that Harry and Muktabodha have been able to do what they are
doing.

Dear List Members,
In an article by Petra Kieffer-P?lz (The meaning of m?l?a(ka)/m?la(ka) in P?li) I came across a few text passages describing the m?laka decorated by,or the floor of which was covered, with fresh white sand (pa??arapul?ina). I am interested to know if descriptions of this practice are also found in other than Buddhist texts and if there are ritual or religious concerns involved.
With the best wishes, Herman

Coincidentally, I came across "-m?laka" in the Su?rutasa?hit? just a week
or two ago.  The sentence is here
<https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/05-su.ka/provisional-edition_kalpasthana?upama_ver=gv7efxs1nu&upama_scroll=SS.5.4.16>,
and the compound *cu?cum?lakayukta* describes what a snake-bite site looks
like; it has "a little ring of spots" around the fang-indentations.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Meaning of middle level dot after words in manuscript
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o9Y75pzL3bj3QkujgAWfy3btHzLSJUSMuL1f6mECpTZRg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I'm looking at a manuscript of the aj??nadv?ntad?pik? by soman?tha.  In
some of the folios some words are followed by a mid-level dot (see attached
folio 29b with the words followed by the dot circled in blue).  Can someone
tell me what the mid-level dot means?

This also occurs in folios

17b, 19b, 20a,21a,21b,22a,22b,25a,26a,27a,27b, 30a,30b,31a,32a,32b,34a,
34b,35a,36a,36b,37a,37b

The full manuscript can be downloaded from archive.org, the link is:
https://archive.org/download/https://archive.org/download/AgyanDhvantaDeepikaShriSomnath4966Alm22Shlf4DevanagariTantra_201708/Agyan%20Dhvanta%20Deepika%20-%20Shri%20Somnath_4966_Alm_22_Shlf_4_Devanagari-%20Tantra.pdf

 Dear list members,

It was pointed out to me on the BVP list by the author of the
??????????????????
website:

That just means that the writing of a repeating word/phrase was skipped by
the scribe. In most cases it is already known by the reader or already
written once before by the scribe.
So, if it is nyAsa prakaraNa, then ??? ??? etc. mean ?????? ????? ?????
?????? etc. If it was done with the mantra, then it is assumed by the
scribe that the reader/practitioner known the mantra owing to his study of
veda-s. And so on.

Also Charles DiSimone noted:

In older brahmic manuscripts produced throughout Greater Gandh?ra these
dots are commonly used similarly to danda. They are referred to as dot like
punctuation (although they are not always used as punctuation!). Maybe
something similar going on here?


Also the correct link to the manuscript is:

https://archive.org/download/AgyanDhvantaDeepikaShriSomnath4966Alm22Shlf4DevanagariTantra_201708/Agyan%20Dhvanta%20Deepika%20-%20Shri%20Somnath_4966_Alm_22_Shlf_4_Devanagari-%20Tantra.pdf

Message-ID: <9d8f5cc1-5f5a-5150-4719-bec759f99a6d@gmail.com>

Dear listmembers,
the renaming of the brahmanical Skandakum?ra-devale at Kandy into a 
Kataragama-devale must have happened at the beginning of the 19th 
century according to my research. It is not very long ago but I was 
without success to get any information about this issue. After the 
renaming of the Skandakum?ra-shrine into a Kataragama-shrine the 
depictions of the original Kataragama are now vanishing and replaced by 
pictures of Skandakum?ra.
Maybe someone of you can provide some details on the name change?
Thank you in advance

Heiner

Dear Dr Koch

I have not had any contact with him since my graduate student days, but
according to what I could quickly find online, Patrick Harrigan
<https://www.google.nl/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Patrick+Harrigan%22>
is still active (?) in researching specifically this site.
See https://umich.academia.edu/PatrickHarrigan
https://amesa.library.columbia.edu/scholars/723?locale=en
the latter with further links (not that the two website links are not
clickable because of some error but you can copy paste them individually).
Perhaps this is a useful contact.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Idea of Text in Buddhism
Message-ID: <CAGPpahgWDTVDiSMU7_jW-Ejb+Vp-0jvb2ErfhQn9vPtmYv5_kQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends and colleagues, and apologies for cross-posting,

I apologize for this belated message, but since I have learned recently of
people who were unaware of this publication, I thought this is a case of
better late than never. I am thus happy to announce the special edition on
"The Idea of Text in Buddhism" I edited in *Journal of Indian Philosophy*,
which was published last year. It includes a list of fascinating
contributions by a number of members of this list, which together
problematize the category of *text *in the study of Buddhism, with an
introduction by Charles Hallisey and myself. The greater focus is on
Indian/Indic Buddhism. Please see the link to the volume here:
https://link.springer.com/journal/10781/volumes-and-issues/50-4.

Best wishes,

Eviatar Shulman

Dear list members,

On behalf of a scholar who is not a member of this list, I am asking if anyone can provide a pdf of the second half of ?e??nanta's Prabh? on ?a?adhara's Ny?yasiddh?ntad?pa, which Potter reports is in vol. 42 of The Pandit, published in 1920. The supposed volume 42 on archive.org is actually volume 32.

Thank you.

Dear colleagues,

Could anyone help me obtain pdf of the following?

Wijk, Walter Emile van. 1938. Decimal Tables for the Reduction of Hindu Dates from the Data of the S?rya-Siddh?nta. The Hague: M. Nijhoff.

I also require pdf of the same author's "On Hindu Chronology", which seems to have appeared in installments of Acta Orientalia, I (1923), p. 206; II (1924), p. 55; III (1924),p. 236; IV (1926), p. 55; V (1927), p. 1. I am not sure my bibliographic reference is correct.

Thanks a lot!

Dear colleagues,

Could anyone help me obtain pdf of the following?

Wijk, Walter Emile van. 1938. Decimal Tables for the Reduction of Hindu Dates from the Data of the S?rya-Siddh?nta. The Hague: M. Nijhoff.

I also require pdf of the same author's "On Hindu Chronology", which seems to have appeared in installments of Acta Orientalia, I (1923), p. 206; II (1924), p. 55; III (1924),p. 236; IV (1926), p. 55; V (1927), p. 1. I am not sure my bibliographic reference is correct.

Thanks a lot!

Arlo Griffiths

Thanks to Shankar and Christophe for mentions of my work. I've only now
caught up to this discussion - I don't have much to add on these earliest
translations to what is in the works of mine already cited.

However, it might be of interest to note what I believe to be one of the
earliest direct translations from an Indian language text to English,
namely the translation by John Marshall (an EIC factor) and Madh?sudhana (a
Bengali Brahmin) of the Bh?gavata Pur??a into English in 1674-77. The
manuscript, which I believe to be a first draft, provides fascinating
evidence to suggest that Marshall and Madh?sudhana followed the same method
as the Mughal translators of Sanskrit texts into Persian studied by Prof.
Nair and others - that is, oral translation from Sanskrit to an Indian
vernacular and only thence to the final language (English or Persian). I
think this method was very widely used by early modern European "readers"
of Indian texts and accounts for much of the deviation from the "original"
texts which we find in early European renderings of Indian texts.
Marshall's work is, in my view, unduly neglected. After his death
his translation of the BhP (and another work which purported to be, but
certainly was not, the Sama Veda) was sent to Marshall's former teacher at
Cambridge, John Covell. It was shown by him to John Locke, who offered to
arrange publication in Churchill's Collection of Voyages and Travels.
Covell wanted to add his own notes and reflections to the text before
publishing and it never appeared. The texts may also have been shown to
Henry More, another teacher of Marshall and much interested in
reincarnation.

Marshall's may also be the first translation of any Indian religious text
NOT by a missionary. It is refreshing for the almost total lack of
derogatory comment directed at Hinduism, even though it translates episodes
from the Krishna l?l? and more (for instance, the version of Bhag?ratha's
birth which makes him the result of intercourse between two women found in
the K?ttiv?sa R?m?ya?a).

University of Oxford

Just off the top of my head.

Dear List Members,

According to the Jinacaritra and the second suyakkhandha o the ?y?ra, the most important events in the Mah?v?ra's life and ascetic career took place when the moon was in conjunction with the constellation Uttaraph?lgun?. Due to my unfamilarity with asterism, conjunctions, etc., the relationship of these phenomena with the turningpoints in the Mah?v?ra's career escapes me. I hope somebody on the list can direct me to literature that may enlighten a non-astrologer/non-astronomer like me.
With kind regards,
Herman

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Are there two different om (praNava) signs in Sharada?
Message-ID: <CAKzBjjtxGq5rJxgshydpNZpHyqSecdNxX9tO1rAtQXE5sMcEyA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

In a Kashmiri Sharada manuscript, two different om symbols are used (image
attached). I have seen both of them in manuscripts but have not seen them
being used in the same manuscript. Is it the case that they are used in
different contexts, such as, when both are used, the first one is used at
the beginning of the text and the other one elsewhere?

Dear Deepro,

In my experience sometimes both forms of ?o?' are used interchangeably. In the sample you have shared, the first form is more Devan?gariased and the latter, as you know, is vowel ?o? in ??rad? with ??? on top. In some cases the ??? is found upside down on top of the vowel ?o?. But I would not associate any unique significance of this interchangeable usage and I humbly invite the experts to correct me.
