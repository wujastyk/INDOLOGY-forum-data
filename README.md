# Steps for adding new data


1. Download the archive for one month from the [Indology Archives](https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/) page, and store the file it contains in the __/archives/YEAR__ folder. Create the folder for a new year, if needed.

2. Check if the new archive's name follows the convention: __YEAR-Month.txt.gz__ (e.g. __2023-January.txt.gz__). In case if they are not, contact the developer.

3. Repeat the above steps for every archive you want to process.

4. Commit the changes.
