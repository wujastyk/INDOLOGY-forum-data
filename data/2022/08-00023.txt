Examples of spelling change from Italian: una ombra ? un?ombra; quella opera ? quell?opera. Furthermore, the vowel [i] can be added at the beginning of a word, as in per ischerzo (from per scherzo), or in ispalla (from in spalla).

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Sandhi examples in the english language

Thank you all for these great replies. Howard Resnick gives an example of a spelling change for internal sandhi.  Can someone give me an example of a spelling change for word junction (external) sandhi in a non-Indian language (if such a thing exists?).

English sandhi, n -> m before a labial consonant:

Examples: in-justice but im-possible; in-scrutable, but im-mature.

etc.

Good luck,
Howard
