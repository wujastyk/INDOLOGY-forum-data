Dr.Dahejia,With due regards, I mention the following points on the issue of "Sunnya"1) "Sunnyata" of Mahayana Buddhism is a purely philosophical concept developed by Asanga and his brother BasuBandhu, embodying the principal of "ChatushKotiBinirmuktwa"..2) In the world of Mathematics,probably ,an ancient Indian text dating back to 5th CE B.C, named as "Lokabibhaga" displayed use of decimal system ( including aero) .I would be grateful if any further reference on this text can be furnished.3) AryaBhatta's name is&nbsp; associated with the concept of zero" with respect,although there is a view that Maya civilization of Central America introduced the concept of zero.
Would like to be enlightened more on this.RegardsAlakendu Das.

Friends:





Is there any evidence that the sunya of mathematics arose out of the sunyata of Mahayana Buddhism?





Kind regards,
