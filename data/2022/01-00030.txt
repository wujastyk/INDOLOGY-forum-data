With IIT Kharagpur Calendar, the Hindutva Right Takes Another Step Away From Science   ]
==Excerpts====
The unicorn as a symbol of a Vedic rishi is among the four ?decisive evidences? the sages of IIT Kharagpur have presented in a 2022 calendar, whose stated purpose is to rebut the ?Aryan invasion myth?.
The calendar has been produced under the auspices of the newly inaugurated Centre of Excellence for Indian Knowledge Systems at IIT Kharagpur, headed by Prof. Joy Sen.
Even though this calendar has thrust IIT Kharagpur into the news, the so-called ?Indian Knowledge Systems? already have a home in IIT Gandhinagar, and IIT Kanpur may be next in line.
