Dear Christophe,
yes, that is the place where I downloaded it from.
The PDF which I sent to Arlo and to the list, contains (embedded) that 
same address (and "id"), namely
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3kYOAAAAQAAJ
I personally doubt one can hope that
"as long as google exists"
"as long as archive.org exists"
will be as proverbial as
"as long as the sun the moon and the earth exist"
Best wishes to all
