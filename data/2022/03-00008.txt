Subject: [INDOLOGY] Long and short vowels in Indian languages

Literary/Standard, however you want to label it, Tamil does distinguish its vowels by length ? short or long.

However, in today's slurred/dialectal speech or even in Carnatic music the intended vowel length collapses here and there. 

Only a good socio-ethno linguist would be able to provide an accurate analysis.
