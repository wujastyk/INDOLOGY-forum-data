Dear members of the list,
I wonder if any of you may have a scan of the following article (perhaps, a short monograph):
Joshi, S. D. 1966. ?Adjectives and Substantives as a Single Class in the Parts of Speech?. Publications of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit. Poona: University of Poona.
Many thanks in advance!
best,
Andrey
