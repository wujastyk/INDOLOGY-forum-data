  Dear all,
  The well-known author and historian William Dalrymple (also in this
list?) had today on Twitter a good thread on the M?r?n frescoes (
https://twitter.com/DalrympleWill/status/1524612464054202368), in which he
states that the M?r?n monastery "was founded c400 CE near the spot where
some of the very earliest surviving fragments of the text of the Mahabharat
were recently dug up." I am aware of tablet *KI *523 (
https://gandhari.org/catalog?itemID=1672), which?if I recall
correctly?loosely parallels a passage of the *??ntiparvan*, and also
of the *parvan
*list in the so-called Spitzer manuscript from Kizil, but that's it.
  I asked for a reference on Twitter, but I haven't had an answer so far.
Is anyone aware of "earliest surviving fragments of the text of the
*Mah?bh?rata* recently dug up" in the Tarim Basin?
  *namaskaromi*,
