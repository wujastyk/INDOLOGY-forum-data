l'institut d'?tudes indiennes. From 2003 to 2011 I participated in this
connection regularly in meetings meticulously prepared and skillfully
presided over by Prof. Fussman in his own peculiar and unforgettable style.
Although preparing for his agr?gation de lettres classiques and later on
specializing in Indian archeology and history, he also followed courses on
Sanskrit and Vedic grammar. He once described to me the lively atmosphere
of enthusiasm and excitement during the courses given by Louis Renou, which
he could follow for a few years. Some of his old Vedic grammar books he
sold after his retirement in a small book fair together with numerous other
personal books.
