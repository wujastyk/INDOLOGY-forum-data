Thank you Dr. Michaels,
Its my understanding that the NGMCP project started around 1970, so some of
the photographs/microfilm were taken over 50 years ago. That makes me
wonder if by international copyright law, some of the earlier images are
not already legally in the public domain.
I think for books, if the copyright is owned by an individual then the
copyright expires 50 or 75 years after the authors death, but if the
copyright is owned by a government then the copyright expires 50 or 75
years after the date of publication.  (I'm not sure if this is by
international copyright law or just by Indian copyright law) and I'm
wondering if it is the same case for photographs/microfilm. I.e. copyright
expires 50 or 75 years after the photograph was taken.
