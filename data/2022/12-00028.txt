While this obviously includes Goa, I am also interested in Konkani speakers further to the north in Maharashtra but also to the east of Goa and especially to the south into Karnataka (and also Cochin, but that is not my priority right now).

Also, any information on Dravidian speakers in Goa (and related issues) would be greatly appreciated.

I know most older accounts do not care much about the languages people spoke, but also any references to other groups (e.g., "Brahmans from the north" or something like that which may allude to Konkani speakers) from these areas would also be of help. Many thanks!
