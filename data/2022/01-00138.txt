Dear colleagues,

My social media news feed indicates that Karl Potter had passed away. I did find this brief obituary on the University of Washington website:

https://phil.washington.edu/news/2022/01/21/remembering-emeritus-professor-karl-potter

I wish to acknowledge here how much his work has been important for those of us studying Indian Philosophy, and what a marvelous resource he had created in his Encyclopedia.

Yours in sadness,
Aleksandar
