Dear Itamar,
I do not know the Indic sources in this case, but the Tibetan equivalent, rlung nad (lit. "wind disease"), often refers to states of panic, paranoia, hyper-sensitivity, etc. A somewhat popular, but not erroneous, presentation of the issue may be found in Terry Clifford, Tibetan Buddhist Medicine and Psychiatry, pp. 132-136. Those more familiar with medical literature than I am may well have additional suggestions.

[INDOLOGY] Psychological effect of v?ta-do?a
Dear All,
Is anyone familiar with a none physical effect of v?ta-do?a? Dictionaries translate v?ta as gout or rheumatism, but in the context where I found this term, it seems as if it should have a more psychological/mental effect, such as madness or delusion. Any suggestions?
Best,
