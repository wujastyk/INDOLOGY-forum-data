[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit inscription in Egypt?

I'm afraid that the "beautiful Buddha statue" requires a fair bit of
interpolation to see, as the speaker himself makes quite clear. I have no
evidence that this is not a buddha, and if this partial image were found in
an Indian context we might well assume it to have been a buddha, but in
this context it requires really a great deal of imagination to conclude
that it is. More than a small amount caution is warranted, I should say.
