I am surprised not yet to see reference to Otto Stein, 'The Numeral 18', (*The
Poona Orientalist *1, 1936, pp. 1-37; 2, 1937, pp. 164-165. it is reprinted
in the *Kleine Schriften*.
Freidrich Wilhelm said of the papers:
In *The Poona Orientalist* I and II ( 1936 and 37) Stein published two
articles on the numeral 18. They are valuable contributions to Indian
number mysticism which is traceable since Vedic times. Even the reader who
is aware of the specific meaningfulness of Indian numbers will be astounded
how many references Stein was able to collect, and will feel inspired to
look for more material on this and other numerals.
Stein was one of the all too many scholars brutally murdered by the Nazis,
in his case along with his wife in Spring 1942 in Lodz.
