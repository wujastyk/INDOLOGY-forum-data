I am sure many have noted that in Tamil, the word e?, which has equivalents in other Dravidian languages (an in Telugu, for example), is far more productive than Sanskrit iti. It occurs in various forms ? adjective (e??um), adverb (e??u), noun (e?patu), finite verb (e.g. e?ki??rka?), while in Sanskrit iti is only adverbial. It would be interesting to analyze the uses of e? in Sangam literature ? I?m not sure anyone has done this. Of course, the use of this construction could be an areal phenomenon ? it is not necessarily true that its presence in early Sanskrit is due to Dravidian, though I think it is highly likely, given its richness in Dravidian languages.
