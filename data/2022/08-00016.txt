[INDOLOGY] Sandhi examples in the english language
 <1659643275-5984867.70785639.f274K1E0w1028813@rs6162.luxsci.com>
Thank you all for these great replies. Howard Resnick gives an example of a
spelling change for internal sandhi.  Can someone give me an example of a
spelling change for word junction (external) sandhi in a non-Indian
language (if such a thing exists?).
