I would like to take this opportunity to point out a fact that is not well known among Indologists. All of us who routinely use the DLI book scans on archive.org must be extremely grateful to Martin Gluckman, as he created a mirror of the entire DLI before the project ended and all the books disappeared. Without his action, thousands of scans from the DLI would no longer be publicly available.
In addition, as the director of the Sanskrit Research Institute in Auroville, he is behind not only the DLI Mirror but also the Sanskrit Dictionary and a number of other useful projects (https://sri.auroville.org/projects/).
Best
Lubomir
