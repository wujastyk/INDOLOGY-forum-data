Dear all,

does anybody know what currently is the best way to contact the NCC  
project team? In the past, Prof. Siniruddha Dash used to be most  
helpful in providing information about entries in the NCC, but the  
email address I have from him does not work anymore, and, if I  
understand it correctly, he is also not in charge anymore there. Who  
would one contact nowadays?

Best

Peter
