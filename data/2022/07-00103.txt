[INDOLOGY] Patkar 1963
Dear colleagues,
Might anyone have a pdf of Patkar, M.M. 1963. "The Role of Gambling in
Ancient Indian Society and Some Sanskrit Words Pertaining to the
Game." Vishveshvaranand
Indological Journal 1:141-53?
I see that google books has a scan of the volume, but that remains
inaccessible to me.
Many thanks in advance,
Peter Szanto
