I haven't seen pr?dhunika in the witnesses for this particular verse. 
The printed editions and most MSS I have seen of the 
Pra?natantra/Pra?nakaumud?/Jyoti?akaumud? attributed to N?laka??ha tend 
to have pr?ya?ika, though there must be dozens of editions I haven't 
seen, and hundreds if not thousands of MSS. The single MS I've seen of 
the original Pra?natantra (which is the middle part of Samarasi?ha's 
tripartite P?cchodde?a) has something that, to be honest, could be 
either pr?ghu?aka or pr?dyu?aka, though I'd say it looks slightly more 
like a dyu to me. The MS that unquestionably has pr?dyu?ika is of the 
'N?laka??ha' text, but contains a greater proportion of Samarasi?ha's 
work than most such MSS, and generally superior readings.

It would be interesting to know how p?hu?iya and related forms were used 
in western and northwestern vernaculars around the 13th century, 
especially whether they typically had connotations of kinship or close 
relations (contrasting with the status of a guest in general). I'm not 
sure where to look for that sort of information, though.

Best wishes,
Martin
