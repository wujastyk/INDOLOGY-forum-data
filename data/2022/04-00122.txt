[INDOLOGY] A map/graph of historical development of Sanskrit
Dear colleagues,
For my class, I am looking for a visual representation of the historical
development of the Old Indo Aryan language:
from OIA to Vedic (Sanskrit) to Classical Sanskrit and Middle Indo Aryan
languages (Prakrits), with the approximate time for each stage.
It would be especially appreciated if the map reflected the fact that some
Prakrits in some respects directly continue the features
of the Vedic language, which are lost in Classical Sanskrit.
If there exists such a map, I would be most grateful if someone explained
where I can consult it.
Kind regards,
Gleb Sharygin, Dr.des.
