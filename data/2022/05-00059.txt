Dear colleagues,
A colleague working on Yunnan Sanskrit inscription showed me an ink rubbing recently (15th century?) and I noted the impossible character ??? (middle of the three b?ja letters in the attached image). This character is well known in the Japanese esoteric tradition and there are some scanty references to it in works by ?na <https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jeb1947/1968/85/1968_85_16/_pdf/-char/ja> and recently Rambelli and Dolce <https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004306523/B9789004306523_009.xml>. When I asked Prof. Kojima Giry? who specialises in Siddham characters some years ago, I was given the impression that this might have been a Japanese innovation. So it is interesting to find this in the Yunnan corpus as well. I am curious if anyone knows of any discussion about this impossible character in Sanskrit literature, especially in non-Buddhist Indian sources.
I also wonder if anyone knows anything about the ?sthr??? letter (first one from left). Someone in China collected a variety of specimens using this character, suggesting that it may have some significance in the Esoteric Buddhist tradition in Yunnan: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/FIkJktzIBIxXWf7swCL2QA <https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/FIkJktzIBIxXWf7swCL2QA>
