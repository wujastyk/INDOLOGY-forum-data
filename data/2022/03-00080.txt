Dear list members,
I am looking for M. S?ma??khara ?arma's article "Nannayaku p?rvapu
telugu-?il???sanamulu" (??????? ??????? ??????-????????). It is published
in the Telugu journal Bh?rati No. 5, issue 3, pp. 473-484 (1928).
This issue of Bh?rati is uploaded on archive.org but pages 481-482 are
missing (page 479 is put there twice instead).
It would be great if someone could forward me the complete article (or the
two missing pages).
Thank you very much!
Best regards,
Jens
