Dear list members,
Firstly thank you to Dominik Haas who found a reference in a modern womans
travel journal to India.  Other than that I was extremely surprised that I
couldn't find any mantras in any written sources to Dhanvantari.  I
searched GRETIL, the Muktabodha digital library, and the Kyoto Archive of
Sanskrit Texts (Michio Yano and colleagues) . There were lots of references
to dhanvantarI (dhanvantarir uvAca etc.)  but as far as I could see no
mantras to him (of course its possible I missed them).
Any supposition about why these are so rare (non-existent?) in written
sources but all over the internet.  In ayurveda is it other deities that
are used in healing mantras?  Or even better if the ayurvedic experts could
point me to any mantras to dhanvantari (or other deities) used in healing.
Thanks again,
Harry Spier
