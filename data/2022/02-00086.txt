[INDOLOGY] Short and sweet?

Dear Martin, Walter, and everyone,
The arabic is probably
??? = sublime [s?m; the ?ah? in the Sanskritized sahm could just signal it is a long-a]
?? ????? = [al-sa ?h?da; happiness, joy, beatitude, welfare, sunshine; al- becomes as- due to external sandhi]
So s?m = suk?ma and as-sa ?h?da = sv?dhu = pleasantness, charm, beauty (MW) [not just ?sweetness?]. If so, that would make s?k?ma-sv?du a fairly literal translation.
The author probably didn?t differentiate between Arabic and Persian, just as Indians tended to consider Greeks and central Asians viewed as in the Hellenistic orbit as yavana, regardless of actual ethnicity, geography or language. Someone familiar with Arabic/Persian astronomical terms could offer further clarification or suggestions.
