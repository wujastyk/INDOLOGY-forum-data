Dear All,

I do not know about the planned effort but it certainly would be worth the try:

In the mid-Seventies, the late Nepalese scholar Dr. Janak Lal Sharma showed me his printed copy of the N? (Gaekwad, I believe): based on old Nepalese MS(s), he had inserted the text of many lacunae and also variants.

One of the many cases where Nepalese MSS can shed considerable light on our texts?

Check out the MSS catalog  (NGMCP)  of the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project at Hamburg!

Cheers,
Michael Witzel

?Dear List members, in a blog post Sugyan Kumar Mahanty mentions a project by Prof. Kamalesh Dutta Tripathy of editing a version of the N? based on manuscripts from Nepal in Newari script. Can anyone tell me what has come out of this project.
With kind regards, Herman
