Dear Jan,

you might be interested in the example which I include as an attachment.

You can see the pu??i on initial vowel in the commentary to the Na???l 
c?ttiram which reads

?????? ?????? ?????? ????????????
?????? ???? ???????? ??????

[tollai va?ivi?a vell? ve?uttum??
?eytu mekara vokaramey pu??i]

I can provide you with more examples if you wish, including from Palm 
leaf MSS

All the best

????????
