Subject: [INDOLOGY] Alphabetical order in Sanskrit and Pali
Message-ID: <CAOCtTAuijWxQ6zabbnUHrA+f=2_ne99vSTFuzqDyZbEOeE8unw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I am looking for scholarly publications on the criteria for the sequential
order of the ak?aras in Sanskrit and Pali. I am also interested in knowing
if anyone has come across the concepts of k?la (= long, short, etc.) and
?ruti (voiced, unvoiced, etc.) in relation to the categorisation of ak?aras
in Sanskrit ??stras. Especially the concept of k?la?rutibheda, which is
what distinguishes sounds generated in the same place of articulation.

Any help will be most appreciated.

Best wishes,
Aleix
