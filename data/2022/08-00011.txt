[INDOLOGY] Sandhi examples in the english language
Dear list members,
I need to give a brief introductory talk to english speakers, not
linguistic or sanskrit students, but english speakers who chant sanskrit
mantras and shlokas.
I thought I'd briefly talk about and give examples of:
1) How sanskrit is very independent of word order.
2) How sanskrit uses case endings
3) How sandhi is widespread in sanskrit andi is also part of the spelling
in sanskrit .
I'd like to give examples of sandhi in english to to make the concept of
sandhi more clear.  The examples I know of are:
1) final "s"
"books" pronounced as "books" but "bags" pronounced as "bagz".
2) final "d"
"glazed" pronounced as "glaizd" but "placed" pronounced as "plaist"
It would be helpful if someone could give me other examples of sandhi in
english. Not final "s" or final "d"
Also is it true that most (all?) languages have sandhi ?
Is sandhi expressed in the spelling (and not just the pronounciation) of
any non-Indian languages?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
