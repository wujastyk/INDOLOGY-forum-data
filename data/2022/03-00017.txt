Dear Colleagues,

Oskar von Hin?ber: Studien zur Kasussyntax des P?li, besonders des
Vinaya-Pi?aka.
Durchgesehener und korrigierter Nachdruck im Neusatz. Erg?nzt um einen
Sachindex von Petra Kieffer-P?lz.
Halle 2022. pp. 332.  88,00 ? (ISBN 978-3-86977-251-6)
Studia Indologica Universitatis Halensis | Volume 19
[Studies on the Case Syntax of P?li, in particular of the Vinaya-Pi?aka.
Revised and corrected reprint in new typesetting. Supplemented by a subject
index by Petra Kieffer-P?lz].
Note on the scope of the present revision:
The present revision of Oskar von Hin?ber's book on P?li syntax is largely
limited, on the one hand, to references to studies that have appeared in
the half-century that has passed since its first publication in 1968 and,
on the other, to a considerable expansion of the indices. New additions
include a subject index as well as indexes of those places where textual
interpretations deviating from the translation by T. W. Rhys Davids and H.
Oldenberg in the "Vinaya Texts" or by I. B. Horner in "The Book of
Discipline" are suggested.
The core text of this former dissertation was taken over unchanged, but
printing errors, very occasionally also translation errors, were corrected
and the "Addenda et Corrigenda" of the original print were incorporated.
Further details can be found here, where orders can also be placed:
