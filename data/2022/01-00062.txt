[INDOLOGY] Aesthetic Experience
Friends/Rasikas:
In the Indian tradition, as you all know, we can elevate aesthetic experience to a transcendent level and therefore we are able to say
brahmananda sahoadara.
Is Greek/European aesthetics able to do that or does it stop at a  psychological level of catharsis?
Kind regards,
