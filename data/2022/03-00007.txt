[INDOLOGY] Long and short vowels in Indian languages
Found the reference: Sounds and their patterns in Indic languages, 2 vols. Cambridge University Press, 2014. (As it turns out, there are many languages without a length contrast, especially Tibeto-Burman languages.)

Bangla has lost the old length distinctions; I suspect some other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages too. There is a good phonological survey by Pramod Kumar Pandey that may offer more information. Unfortunately the reference is not available to me right now. Google might help
Best wishes

Dear list members,
I was asked if all Indian languages (North and South) have vowels differentiated by length.
Thanks,
