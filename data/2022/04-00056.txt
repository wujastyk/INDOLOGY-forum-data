[INDOLOGY] NGMCP images and copyright law
Just a note? high definition photographs of the Rijksmuseum paintings and other objects ARE available online free of costs. It is only not allowed to earn on the photographs, for instance by producing Rijksmuseum ?souvenirs? on a large scale and selling them. Downloading for research purposes, using in (scholarly) publications and small-scale reproduction for yourself (like printing it on a mug or a T-shirt) is allowed.

Of course, as anywhere else, we like to be mentioned in credit lines and, if possible, receive a copy of a publication where the image appeared. 
With best wishes,
Anna.
