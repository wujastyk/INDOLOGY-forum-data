Just a note? high definition photographs of the Rijksmuseum paintings and other objects ARE available online free of costs. It is only not allowed to earn on the photographs, for instance by producing Rijksmuseum ?souvenirs? on a large scale and selling them. Downloading for research purposes, using in (scholarly) publications and small-scale reproduction for yourself (like printing it on a mug or a T-shirt) is allowed.

https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research/image-requests
Of course, as anywhere else, we like to be mentioned in credit lines and, if possible, receive a copy of a publication where the image appeared. 

With best wishes,
Anna.

However, if you for instance have access--however you have that access--to such a two dimensional image (see above) there is no issue of copyright.

And if so, when.  Or do the agreements signed between the project and the Nepal government supercede this, and the Nepal government has copyright for the images forever.
