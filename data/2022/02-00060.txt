 Library collection of Batak manuscripts
Dear colleagues,

Official launch of the British Library-CSMC Hamburg Batak Manuscripts Digitisation Project
Friday, 18 February, 10:00 am ? 12:00 am (CET)
Zoom Meeting
Meeting ID: 652 2986 2731
Passcode: 23113300
See the attachments.
I myself will be presenting the database called Online Inventory of Ancient Nusantara Epigraphy, which is online since late last year (www.idenk.net<http://www.idenk.net>) and is being gradually filled with data. The data for the island of Sumatra are complete at this time, so that those interested in Indological questions such as identifying any items in Sanskrit or Tamil language, or any items in Grantha script, that have been found on that island can now satisfy their curiosity.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
