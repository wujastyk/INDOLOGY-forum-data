[INDOLOGY] Journals publishing epigraphs currently
There is a "Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India" (vol. 42, 2017) - older issues are available on the website https://epigraphicalsociety.com/
https://epigraphicalsociety.com/esi-journals
and still the "Annual(s) Report(s) on Indian epigraphy" (e.g. vol. for 2018-18 issued in 2019) published by the ASI
in addition to the current series "South-Indian Inscriptions"  (e.g. vol. 43, 2021) or even "Epigraphia Indica" (there is a vol. 43/1, 2011) both also published by the ASI (not much on their website: https://asi.nic.in/publications/ )

Dear scholars,
I would appreciate if any of the members can point me towards journals which currently publish epigraphs of India. Earlier journals like Indian Antiquary and Epigraphica Indica seem discontinued.
With regards,
Dhaval
