Dear Sam,
I have a soft copy of some portions of NHnath's HK, but not the full text.
Were you looking for a particular section, or the whole thing? I also
possess a hard copy; so if my partial soft copy does not contain the
section you were looking for--and if no one else on-list has a full soft
copy--I can scan the section for you from my hard copy. Let me know...
Mangalam.
