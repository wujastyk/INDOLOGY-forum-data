Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tamil initial vowels with vowel signs
Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAKVte7Lsr65AmUltyDKajabCgAAAEAAAAKk00mCOvHtHtzXr+f5X62kBAAAAAA==@matfyz.cz>

Dear all,

 

has anyone come across a Tamil orthography where a vowel sign would be attached to an initial vowel, presumably most likely it would be A or AA, e.g. ???

 

Thank you and best regards,

Jan
