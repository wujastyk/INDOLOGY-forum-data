[INDOLOGY] Searching two publications
Dear all,
I am looking for the following two publications which I could not trace
on archive.org:
Paul Thieme: Ambrosia. In R. Schmitt: Indogermanische Dichtersprache
Dieuke Gaastra: Bijdrage Tot de Kennis Van Het Vedische Ritueel; i.e.
the edition of the JaimSS.
Does anybody happen to have a soft copy of these publications and would
be ready to share it?
Thanks and best wishes, Oliver
