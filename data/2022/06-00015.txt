[INDOLOGY] Naya in Jaina Philosophy
Dear all,
Any hints as to where I might find proper definitions and discussions of
the Jaina concept of 'naya' would be much appreciated! ??
I have quite some secondary literature, but it strikes me as shallow.
Hence, references to primary texts would be especially useful.
Many thanks,
Raja
