Subject: [INDOLOGY] Naya in Jaina Philosophy
Message-ID: <CAPwcoeiw+dJJa4=PAUh7103FGFmpF8RU0J2ek8mr04POhJyZ8w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Any hints as to where I might find proper definitions and discussions of
the Jaina concept of 'naya' would be much appreciated! ??

I have quite some secondary literature, but it strikes me as shallow.
Hence, references to primary texts would be especially useful.

Many thanks,
Raja
