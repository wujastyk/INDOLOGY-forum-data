[INDOLOGY] Current Emails for Emily Hudson and Laurie Patton
Dear Colleagues, 
Could anyone supply me with the current academic emails of these two colleagues? 
I can only find emails that are ex officio for Prof. Patton and I can?t see anything up to date for Prof. Hudson.
They both might be on the list, of course!
Best,
James Hegarty
