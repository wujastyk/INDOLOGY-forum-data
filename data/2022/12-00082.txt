[INDOLOGY] DLI (Digital Library of India)
1) Does anyone happen to know the different old DLI different websites
addresses .  I'd like to check if Archive.org's wayback machine happened to
back the DLI up from these websites. Some of these sites had alphabetical
title lists if I recall correctly.
2)I've just seen this interesting note about an OCR search engine for  the
DLI project of Martin Gluckman
The site http://dli.sanskritdictionary.com has complete mirror of Digital
Library of India. It allows ?deep OCR based searches? within documents
activated by its own OCR engine <http://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/>.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
