Subject: [INDOLOGY] Requesting PDFs
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeOEa13=0rp7L6UTvfQNEjvryjS0royx6=dRXS8He7kaw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

When requesting a PDF, please say where you have already looked.  For
example, archive.org, etc.  That saves other kind members of the forum from
re-searching places you have already tried.

Best,

Dominik Wujastyk
