Dear John,

Thanks for a balanced commentary. I think there is too much of ??? ?????,
rather than a calm presentation and evaluation of alternative proposals.
The first historical question is to reccognize that it is Pata?jali who
extends the scope of 1.4.2 beyond the *ekasa?j??dhik?ra* [i.e. the scope
defined by 1.4.1], and where this extension creates problems, Pata?jali
interprets the word *para *to mean *i??a *"desired," allowing a so called
*p?rvaviprati?edha*. As a result, in Pata?jali's proposal, the choice
between *para? k?rya? *and *p?rva? k?ryam *is determined simply by looking
at what is *i??a *"desirable" in a given derivation. OK. This is what
Pata?jali's extension of 1.4.2 has given us. Now Rishi accepts Pata?jali's
extension of 1.4.2 to the whole of the A???dhy?y?, but not his
understanding that the rule refers to a resolution of rule conflict by
referring to the order of the rules. Then he takes the word *para *to refer
to the order of morphemes in the derivation [left versus right context],
and not the order of rules in the A???dhy?y?. This makes the rule 1.4.2
rather irrelevant for the entire *ekasa?j??dhik?ra*, where the order of
morphemes in the derivation is not an issue. One then has to find new
innovative solutions for the choice of *sa?j?? *in this *ekasa?j??dhik?ra*,
while the very placement of 1.4.2 coming after 1.4.1 becomes rather
meaningless. To account for Rishi's new interpretation, certain
inconvenient rules in the A???dhy?y? are then labeled as possible
interpolations. At least Pata?jali's extension of 1.4.2 to the whole of the
A???dhy?y? does not leave the *ekasa?j??dhik?ra *high and dry. For these
and many other cogent reasons pointed out by various scholars on this list,
I remain unconvinced of these new proposals.
     An alternative investigation may involve keeping the scope of 1.4.2
restricted to the *ekasa?j??dhik?ra*, as P??ini most likely intended, and
see how one can account for the derivations for which Pata?jali proposes to
extend this rule to the rest of the A???dhy?y?. That would be my
suggestion. Best regards,

Madhav
