Dear Jim, JLC, and Chandra,
Thank you for your comments on-list and off-list.? Jim has consulted the Saiva Siddhanta printed edition and confirmed it has the extra -m- after ti- as in pu??u vamma timma ka?pu?? The reason I looked at this issue was the meaning ?cry of birds? for pu??uvam as listed in the Tamil Lexicon for which the usage in commentary for this line is cited as given below 
????????? pu??uvam , n. < id. 1. Cry of birds; ??????????. (????. 2039, ???.) 2. Deceit, guile, craft, falsehood; ???????. ???? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ?????? ???? ????? (????. ????????. 6, 7).
The comments from JLC and Chandrasekaran confirm that the ?m?s in question are indeed insertions for metrical reasons. However, when shorn of the m inserted by prosodic requirement, one sees that the underlying text is pu??uvamatimaka?. Then, we realize that ?pu??uva? is simply the adjectival form of pu??uvar, the name of a bird-catcher community who are also mentioned in C?vakacint?ma?i 2931. 
????????? ?????? ???????? ???????
???????? ???????? ?????? ???????
??????? ?????? ??????? ???????????
???????? ????????? ???????? ????????
Tirukku?a? 274 is critical of birdcatching. But in Civakacint?mani 2039, I see no such value-laden statement as the commentators make out to be. The verse has a simple a matter-of-fact description of a very knowledgeable male of the Pu??uvar community making noises to attract peacocks (in order to catch them).
Thanks again for all the comments.
Regards,
Palaniappa

Please find attached the image of the poem from the 1907 UVS 2nd edition published by the Tamil University, Tanjavur: 1986
It is printed with the seven metrical feet of each line separated by spaces and is reproduced below.
It shows the extra -m- forced by prosody between puLLuva and mati as the foot vamma (???? ).
 ???? ?????? ???? ???? ????? ??? ??????
????? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ?????? ????????
?????? ???? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????????
??????? ????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????????
Actually, the next foot ??? is defective as printed since it is invalid as a candidate for a complete foot since it has only one acai (prosodic syllable) instead of the required two.
So it ought to have been ????? or ??? 
The option ??? would most likely have been preferred, as it matches ??? the third foot of the next line. 
The option  ????? would match  ???? and ?????? in the preceding two lines with the nasal stops uniformly supplying the punctuation to all of them.
But it appears as though the poem has been composed for the first choice, with the first and second pair of lines having their own matching sound effects: 
 ???? and ??????
??? and  ???  
 So with that correction we have this
 ???? ?????? ???? ???? ????? ??? ??????
????? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ?????? ????????
?????? ???? ????? ????? ?????? ???? ????????? or
?????? ???? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????????
??????? ????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????????
