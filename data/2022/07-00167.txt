[INDOLOGY] New version of Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
Dear all,
a new XML version of Bloomfield's VC can be found here, along with a
paper describing how we built it:
https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/papers/2023wsc
The new version is hopefully much easier to parse and and therefore more
accessible for searching as well as for computational approaches.
Best, Oliver
