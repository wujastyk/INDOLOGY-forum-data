Dear list members,
Firstly happy Navaratri.
Secondly I'm wondering what the best way to translate bhagavati and
bhagavan would be.  The target audience is a non-specialist non-sanskritist
audience.  The contexts are typically where someone is addressing a god or
goddess  where the actual name of the god/goddess is also mentioned fairly
close . A typical example would be this gayatr? to annap?r?? .
bhagavatyai ca vidmahe
m?he?varyai ca dh?mahi
tan no annap?r?? pracoday?t
Thanks,
Harry Spier
