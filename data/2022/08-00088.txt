Dear Geoffrey,
A typological approach seems valid to me, although it could require the
same semantic change to happen independently.
It is not an inevitable change, of course, cognates Greek allos, Latin
alius/alter, English else never became semantically specialized in the way
ari- eventually does. I don't think we can chalk it up to having a backup
like anya- as another "other" since English has another "other" too: other
< *antero-. I have always seen the shift of ari- as occurring in a specific
political context where the other clan is not exactly an enemy but a rival
for position within the coalition of the clans (thus ari > ?rya "the
political ceremony you do with the ari"), ?rya of course is never pejorized
like later ari-. Btw, I am happy to send you pdfs of Mayrhofer's EWA.
Best,
Caley
