I think it's also worth asking what the programmers who made this meant
when they said 'Sanskrit'. The classical language, or the modern spoken
version taught and stratified by organisations like e.g. Samskrita Bharati?
I tried a few simple sentences (I went into town, I saw the man, Where is
the cat? etc) and found that
(the default is the masculine participle, by the way, even when you try
things like 'I, S?t?, went into town'), as favoured e.g. by modern spoken
Sanskrit (not only by it, of course)
favoured by modern Sanskrit (and mirrored by e.g. Hindi).
- my, her etc in sentences like 'she sees her sisters' are usually
expressed, e.g. by means of sva- or through the actual genitive pronoun,
unlike the Classical Sanskrit tendency of only expressing this when
omission causes confusion
- with at least some expressions we get the noun in accusative + karoti
expression (e.g. smitam karoti rather than smayati), that, I think, also
becomes more prevalent as time passes
- external sandhi is not applied, again following the prevalent modern
spoken convention
Entering 'I have seen him' (rather than 'I saw him') gives me ??? ??
???????, which I don't quite understand because I'd have expected 'him' to
be the subject and thus nominative. (The same results with other transitive
verbs.)
When you create a translation program, you need to decide what the 'right'
translation of something is. With literary languages, like Sanskrit, whose
features usually include variety of expression, that is difficult. So it
seems natural that the programmers would use the standards of the modern
spoken language, for whose creation those decisions were at some point made.
That google translate now includes Sanskrit is a fascinating social
phenomenon. I'm looking forward to seeing how they are going to develop it,
and hope someone might at some point talk about their methodology in
creating this function. (Let's find out and invite them to a conference? It
would surely make for a fascinating talk!)
All best,
