[INDOLOGY] pdf request
Dear friends,
Might any of you have pdf copies of Fukuda, et al., Studies in Tibetan Logic, parts 1 & 2 (Tokyo: Toyo Bunko)?
I have attempted to find copies available for sale, whether new or used, with no success, and have looked for pdf-s on all the internet archives with which I am familiar, and have similarly struck out there.
I'd be most grateful for soft copies if available.
I apologize to those of you who also receive the AAS Tibet list for cross-posting.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
