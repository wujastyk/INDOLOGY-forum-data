 authors

Dear Martin,
I?m not entirely clear what it is you?re looking for. A bare list that is at once exhaustive and yet limited (most notable). In any case, perhaps this would be useful to look at:
K???????????????, M. 1970 [1937] History of Sanskrit Literature. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.
There are of course many other works along these lines, more or less useful according to one's purpose.
Good luck,
Matthew

[INDOLOGY] Exhaustive list of most notable Sanskrit works and authors
Dear All,
Has anyone compiled an exhaustive list of the most notable Sanskrit works and authors?
I would most appreciate references or copies of any such lists existing.
With kindest wishes,
Martin
