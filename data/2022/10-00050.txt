[INDOLOGY] New Explorations in South Asia Research (NESAR): An
 open-access journal of South Asian Studies
Dear colleagues,
we would like to congratulate you on the launch of *NESAR *and wish you 
all the best for your first publications!
There can be no doubt that *Fair Open Access* journals such as NESAR are 
the future, since they are the only ones that include the entire diverse 
range of authors and readers in the South Asian Studies community.
We are very pleased that NESAR officially supports the *FOASAS 
principles*. On our website you will now also find an entry for ? as 
well as for numerous other FOA journals:

All the best,
Vitus Angermeier and Dominik A. Haas, founders of the FOASAS Initiative
