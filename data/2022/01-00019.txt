[INDOLOGY] Telugu inscriptions
Dear list members,
I am currently working on older Telugu inscriptions.
So far my attempts to find anyone who is working in this field were
unfortunately not successful.
Hence I am now turning to this list to ask the broader Indological
community.
If you know of anyone who is dealing with Telugu inscriptions I would be
very grateful for a hint.
Best wishes for a happy New Year,
Jens Thomas
