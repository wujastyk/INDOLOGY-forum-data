Dear Colleagues,
Does anyone know of or have, and be able to share a romanised text of
the K?mandak?ya-n?tis?ra?
I'm reading it with a non-Sanskritist friend and would like to be able to
show him features of the original language, so a romanised text would be
very useful.
With thanks in advance,
Oliver
