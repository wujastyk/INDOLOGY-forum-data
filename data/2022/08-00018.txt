Dear Harry,
Another example that comes immediately to mind is the indefinite article: "a" before words beginning with a consonant, "an" before words beginning with a vowel. Here the sandhi is not just a matter of pronunciation but of orthography.
Best wishes,
Michael

Re: [INDOLOGY] Sandhi examples in the english language
Thank you all for these great replies. Howard Resnick gives an example of a spelling change for internal sandhi.  Can someone give me an example of a spelling change for word junction (external) sandhi in a non-Indian language (if such a thing exists?).

Good luck,
