I know your question was about  Devanagari MT specifically, Alex. I don't
have a copy of that.  But out of curiosity, I checked Sanskrit 2003 and
Murty Sanskrit and they produced these conjuncts correctly without a
murmur.  Both directly entered as Devanagari and as transliteration using
the RomDev teckit.
Best,
Dominik
