[INDOLOGY] the late fate of the the Rig Vedic Dyaus Pater?
 <491661544.4731338.1653918196656@mail.yahoo.com>
Dear Dean,
Even in the RigVeda dyau? pit? appears only six times; dyau? by itself, of course, occurs frequently, but often in feminine gender. In addition, there is the compound dy?v?p?thiv?.
So, while dyau? pit? (and his relation to p?thiv? m?t?) may be important from the perspective of comparative Indo-European mythology, his role in the Vedic tradition is highly diminished from the beginning. Other deities (Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varu?a, etc.) play a more important role, and in Vedic Prose, Vi??u, as personification of the sacrifice, becomes more important (as well as Rudra), and of course Praj?pati, the ?lord of creatures?.
I hope this at least partly answers your query.
All the best,
Hans Henrich

Dear Indology List,
Can anyone point me to any studies that discuss what happened to the Vedic Dyaus Pater who was important in the Rig Veda but who seems to have been supplanted in later times?
It's particularly interesting for Indo-European studies because Dyaus is related to the Greek Zeus and the Germanic Tyr/Tius and Dyaus Pater to the Roman Ju-piter.
Best,
Dean
