On the origin of zero, there is also an interesting article by Frits Staal (see reference below), which unfortunately is available to me only in snippets. Staal discusses various proposed accounts, including origin from Chinese mathematics (through Southeast Asia), ??nya, and also the P??inian grammatical tradition, referring to lopa and three ?zero? elements in P??ini?s grammar ? luk, lup, and ?lu ? together with the notion that knowledge of P??inian grammar was foundational for all of the Sanskrit-language literature. According to one publication, whose reference is not available to me right now, Staal concluded  "[between 1000 and 600 BCE a linguistic term] 'lopa' [was used] to refer to omissions, disappearances and things that are lost. It is here that the origins of the mathematical concept of zero seem to lie. It is a long period and with smudgy edges but there it is ?"
