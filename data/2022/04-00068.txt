An addendum to my previous message: the time is IST (Indian Standard Time)
S.K.

Dear Colleagues,

    As a part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of Indian 
independence, HRI is organising a series of colloquia on the history of 
Indian mathematics.

I am glad to announce HRI Colloquium talk by Professor Satyanad 
Kichenassamy from Laboratoire de Math?matiques de Reims  (CNRS, 
UMR9008), France as per the following details :

Title            :  What everybody should know about Indian Mathematics
Date             :  15/04/2022
Time             :  16:00-17:30

Abstract: The main points are : (i) contemporary Mathematics is partly 
Indian ; (ii) there were several conceptual frameworks in India, and 
some of them have no modern equivalent ; (iii) rigorous derivations in 
Indian texts were typically encoded through the discursive structure 
(they form an apodictic discourse), as a result of which some authors 
mistook those texts for unsupported lists of rules ; (iv) tools 
developed to understand Indian texts are relevant for understanding 
other cultures as well.
