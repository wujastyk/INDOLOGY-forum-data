[INDOLOGY] Sunya
Friends:
Thank you for the many useful responses.
While it is clear that no definite scientific evidence is forthcoming to suggest that the mathematical concept of sunya arose from the Mahayana concept of sunyata, it is difficult to dismiss that the similarity of the two words is accidental.
Sunya can only rise in an ethos where the concept of sunyata is well understood.
Kind regards,
Harsha
