Karl Harrington Potter (19 August 1927 ? 11 January 2022)
It is my sad duty to report the passing of Karl Harrington Potter, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and South Asian Studies at the University of Washington on January 11, 2022 in Bothell, WA. He was a universally recognized and respected scholar on the philosophical systems of India.  Author of numerous articles, he published Presuppositions of Indian Philosophies (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1963 and later reprints) and, with Austin Creel and Edwin Gerow, Guide to Indian Philosophy (Boston: G. K. Hall, 1998). However his greatest contribution may be his Encylopedia of Indian Philosophies, a project upon which Karl labored for over forty years serving as general editor and contributor. The 25 volumes were published between 1970 and 2019 (Publication details are appended at the conclusion of this obituary.
Born 19 August 1927 in Oakland, CA, he was son of George Reuben Potter, a Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley and Mabel Harrington Potter, a pianist.  Karl was named after his maternal grandfather Karl Pomeroy Harrington, a distinguished professor of Classics at Wesleyan University. After attending the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, Karl completed his B.A. at Berkeley in 1950. After a year of study in India in 1952-53, he completed his PhD under Daniel Ingalls at Harvard in 1955.
