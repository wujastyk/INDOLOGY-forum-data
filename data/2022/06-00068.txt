Dear all,

I came across the following verse in the colophon of an astronomical text
(the *Siddh?ntasindhu* of Nity?nanda written in the early 1630s) that I am
currently reading. In it, Nity?nanda describes the first member of his
family (resident in Indrapuri) as


*tasy?? vasan gau?akulapras?to 'nu??sanen?pi dul??aha??a? |?cch?bhidho
mudgalagotrajanm? babh?va p?rva? sutap? man??? ||*

Can anyone shed light on the word *dul??aha??a*? Is this a known tradition
among the Gau?a Brahmins or is it a place (perhaps, the marketplace of
Dul?na, in modern-day Jhajhar, Haryana?) I should add that
Nity?nanda mentions Indrapur? (Delhi) in the vicinity of Kuruk?etra in the
immediately preceding verse.

Many thanks!

Best,
AJ
