Dear Rishi Rajpopat and the list members,
Thank you for choosing an interesting topic.
I still need to read your thesis, so far I just looked at it briefly. I want the share my doubts about your interpretation of paratva. Everyone agrees that P??ini's paratva, introduced in A.1.4.2, concerns the ekasa?j?? section (A.1.4.1-2.2.38). Some think that it applies throughout the whole A???dhy?y?. Within the ekasa?j?? section, there are examples where only the later rule is chosen over the earlier one by A 1.4.1 and A.1.4.2. In the Mah?bh??ya on A.1.4.1 (from v?rttika 24), K?ty?yana and Pata?jali list examples as purposes for the s?tra. Some examples do not involve left or right positions but refer to the question of which name should be given to the same grammatical segment. For example, (v?rttika 32) whether ?asi? in ?s?dhv asi? chinatti? is kara?a (A.1.4.42: s?dhakataman kara?am) or k?rt? (A.1.4.54: svatantra? kart?). By A 1.4.1 and A.1.4.2, one knows that only A.1.4.54 applies. Do you discuss such examples in your thesis?
In addition, in your thesis, you discuss the antara?ga principle. I think that in many instances where this principle is used, with your explanation of paratva, in contradiction to the antara?ga principle, it is the bahira?ga operation that applies first and remains effective.
Yours
Sharon
