[INDOLOGY] English translation of Manfred Mayrhofer's
 Sanskrit-Grammatik
Dear colleagues:
I was wondering if anyone had a digital copy of the English translation of
Manfred Mayrhofer's *Sanskrit-Grammatik: Mit Sprachvergleichenden
Erl?uterungen* (Berlin: De Gruyter 1965). The book was translated from
German to English by Gordon B. Ford as a part of the *Alabama linguistic &
philological series, no. 20 *in 1972. (The worldcat record for this book is
https://www.worldcat.org/title/sanskrit-grammar/oclc/1151148043.)
With thanks and regards,
AJ
