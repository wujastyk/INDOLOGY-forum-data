Esteemed colleagues,
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
This will certainly stir up some new material for ongoing translation
theory discourses vis-a-vis machine translation and the role of the
translator. For the sake of conversation, I wonder if anyone on-list feels
that this is an explicitly BAD idea, and why?
And full disclosure, I cannot say that I fared much better with the first
verse of the MD when I first encountered it as a fledgling Sanskrit
student. Nothing worse than those dreadful greasy trees, am I right? Hahaha.
