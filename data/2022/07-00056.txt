Dear Philippe,
Again, thank you! I'm very grateful for your help, and reluctant to keep
pestering you... Unfortunately, however, for me at least, the same applies
on the cairn.info website - I can only download chapters for a fee, even
when I log into my University of Zurich account to make the attempt.
Not to worry, I can survive without it!
Many thanks and best wishes,
Robert
