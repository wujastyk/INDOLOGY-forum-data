Dear Colleagues,
attached, please find the call for papers for a two-day online conference on 3rd and 4th November 2022.
We are going to explore stories about and depictions (reliefs, sculptures, paintings, architecture, photo, film etc.) of the creation or the beginning(s) of the world in different cultural settings. We are hoping to bring together very different cultural and religious concepts from ancient up to modern times from South Asia, Asia more generally and beyond. It would be wonderful to integrate narrations and visual expressions from religions, which have not been so much at the focus of research in this area (Islamic cosmogony, Sikh, Jaina, Jewish, Bahai, ?tribal' creation stories etc.). Although you can focus only on literature, it would be great to combine narratives with artistic representations wherever possible and for some to focus on the visual representations.
Please see the attached Cfp and send a 250 word abstract to julia.hegewald at uni-bonn.de <mailto:julia.hegewald at uni-bonn.de> and  mgymnich at uni-bonn.de <mailto:mgymnich at uni-bonn.de> by 20th June the lastet.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly. We would be delighted if you circulated the abstract futher.
We are looking forward to your proposals.
Best wishes,
Julia (Hegewald).
