Dear Friends,
 
I am searching for the email address of Maya Chattopadhyay (the author of Devotional friendship (Sakhya) in the Vaisnavism of the Early Caitanya Tradition). If you know her email address, please send it to me off-list. Or if you are her, please contact me directly.
 
Thank you very much!
 
Jeff
