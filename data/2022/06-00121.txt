Many thanks to Shubham Arora and Lubom?r Ondra?ka who immediately replied to my request! I probably had to say that I am not working on the Ana?gara?ga nor on other k?ma??stric texts (although this is one of the projects crammed into my things-I-want-to-do drawer): at present, I am just cataloguing a manuscript of this treatise.
I couldn?t find Schmidt?s edition in archive.org because of the spellings of the title and author?s name (Kalyaanamaalla Anan?garan?gama~), a blend of Kyoto-Harvard and pseudo-Velthuis encodings. I have written a review to the item just for the sake of adding more common spellings of the title and author?s name (Anangaranga Ana?gara?ga Kalyanamalla Kaly??amalla), for future searchers. 
Thanks once more,
best wishes,
Marco
