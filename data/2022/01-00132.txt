 <CAKdt-Cd5L7Y-5ZamK1xyd_H-nw0Hn0+2eaeH=d0c_tEftnOHMA@mail.gmail.com>
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
on behalf of an MA student I would like to ask whether you can recommend 
literature on ancient Indian libraries and archives, their organisation, 
structure, storage etc. in courts, monasteries and in private.
Thanks in advance,
