Apropos Bob Goldman's observation, I will mention that my paper on Bh??ma,
the MBh's instantiation of Dyaus, discussed the irreonciliable conflict
between Bh??ma and Amb? as some kind of shadow of the earlier juxtaposition
of Dyaus and P?thiv?. Things were better for this God in heaven, before he
was cursed to be incarnate on earth.
James L. Fitzgerald, "Bh??ma beyond Freud: The Fall of the Sky, Bh??ma in
the Mah?bh?rata, 1,? in *Epic Constructions: Gender, Myth, and Society in
the Mah?bh?rata*, edited by Brian Black and Simon Brodbeck (London:
Routledge, 2007): 189-207. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to
return to the envisioned sequel(s) to this piece. Now that the Moksadharma
translation is with the press, I may find a chance to get back to it
eventually.
