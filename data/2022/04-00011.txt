 I have been informed off-list by Sven Ekelin
 The latest fascicle  that I have seen is
<32, 2017, Ca 70 pp? + pp? 5609?5708, apr?m??ya??ab?dh?patti>. But there
could be more fascicles out now.
and again by Ajit Gargeshwari
"I  have been informed that Volumes 31-35 have been published which  will
contain the entry for  entry for abhivicint"

If someone has access to these volumes and could send me the entry for
abhivicint
, it would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
