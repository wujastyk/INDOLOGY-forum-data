[INDOLOGY] Status of Karl Potter's online Bibliography of Indian
 Philosophies
Dear Colleagues,
I was dismayed to discover that the electronic version of Karl Potter's Bibliography of Indian Philosophies is no longer available at <http://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/>. Frank Conlon's obituary for Prof. Potter (posted here on Feb. 11) mentioned that "Explorations are underway to assure continued access to this resource." Does anyone have any further information? The online bibliography was such an invaluable resource for research.
Best wishes,
Michael
