Dear Colleagues,

I would like to point out a less usual use of tumba (or tumbaka; the gender oscillates between masculine and neuter) as a laukikany?ya. It is found in M?lin?viyajav?rttika II.108ab: n?ntar?rdratvam abhyeti ni?cchidra? tumbaka? yath? ?just as the gurd does not become soft inside unless it is pierced with holes?. The context is Abhinavagupta?s criticism of the too ?monolithic? and stiff aspects of P?ta?jala yoga.

 Best,

 Raffaele

The general consensus seems to be that the word refers to bottle gourd, and I see that some sources, including Wikipedia, use the word calabash. Rajam's comment about the use of these gourds as swimming aids (obliquely confirmed by Aleksandar's Mok?op?ya/Yogav?si??ha reference) was particularly illuminating. I was beginning to wonder whether I had misunderstood the image, as the author doesn't actually say crossing the ocean, but simply diving into it (vig?he). The swimming aid makes perfect sense.
