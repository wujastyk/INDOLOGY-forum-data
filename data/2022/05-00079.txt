Dear Colleagues,
I would like to point out a less usual use of tumba (or tumbaka; the gender oscillates between masculine and neuter) as a laukikany?ya. It is found in M?lin?viyajav?rttika II.108ab: n?ntar?rdratvam abhyeti ni?cchidra? tumbaka? yath? ?just as the gurd does not become soft inside unless it is pierced with holes?. The context is Abhinavagupta?s criticism of the too ?monolithic? and stiff aspects of P?ta?jala yoga.
 Best,
 Raffaele
