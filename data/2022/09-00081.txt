Subject: [INDOLOGY] help with a stamp
Message-ID: <2255170F-B7D9-4A51-B53E-30400602F199@uniroma1.it>

Dear Colleagues,
my query is specially addressed to the frequent visitors of Indian mss. libraries. I look forward to identifying the library where this ms. is kept. The only cue is the incomplete stamp from which I can only gather that it is a Government library of Kashmir (apparently not the famous Research Department Library of Srinagar, whose stamp know to me is different). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,
Raffaele
