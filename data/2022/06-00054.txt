Thanks a lot, Harry, for explaining the technical background. This
definitely explains the strange encoding. For the time being, re-OCRing
it seems to be one manageable approach (already pointed out by Tim
Cahill), so I will try the Google cloud SDK which works in the
background of SanskritCR.
Best, Oliver
