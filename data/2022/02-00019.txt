[INDOLOGY] witchcraft info
  Dear Paolo,
  Albeit short and less descriptive than we would wish, the three 3rd-4th
Century G?ndh?r? documents from Niya that mention the persecution and
summary execution of witches, numbers 58, 63, and 248, are the one instance
I can think of (you will find the texts in Boyer, A.M., E. J. Rapson, E.
Senart, and P. S. Noble, 1920?29, *Kharo??h? Inscriptions Discovered by Sir
Aurel Stein in Chinese Turkestan* (Oxford: Clarendon Press), and Thomas
Burrow's English translation in his 1940 *A Translation of the Kharo??hi
Documents from Chinese Turkestan* (James G. Forlong Fund. London: The Royal
Asiatic Society), available online at
https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/niyadocts.html).
  The tricky part here is to what extent one can consider Central Asian
Shanshan/Nuava to be Indic/South Asian. My own take here?but there is a
variety of opinion?is that it was a settler-colonial society in which
Gandh?ran culture informed the discourse of a *mestizo* elite, ? la Latin
America.
  The term *khakhorda* or *khakhorna* used for "witch" is particularly
fascinating with its presumed Iranian etymology (~Avestan *ka-xvar??a*).
Given that the indigenous people of the kingdom were probably Iranian
speakers, it is likely that the "witchcraft" reflected indigenous
practices. I look forward to seeing if other people have more references.
  *namaskaromi*,
