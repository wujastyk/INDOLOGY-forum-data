Publication of *Tantric Teachings of the K?lik? Pur??a* by Karel R. van
Kooij
Leiden: Brill, 2021
Dear All,
Although it appeared last year, you may be interested in the announcement
of this publication by Karel R. van Kooij, one of my former professors at
the Indology department of Utrecht University (I have not yet seen any
announcement here, may have missed it):
https://nias.knaw.nl/books/tantric-teachings-of-the-kalika-pura%E1%B9%87a/
Together with van Kooij's well-known earlier publications, esp.
*Worship of the Goddess According to the K?lik?pur??a*, Part I (Leiden:
Brill, 1972),
this new book contains a monumental introduction to, and presentation of,
the peculiar cultural-religious complex that found expression in this
Pur??a and the analysis and translation of substantial fragments of the
text.
