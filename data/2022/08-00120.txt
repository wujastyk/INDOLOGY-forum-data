The current South Asia librarian at Penn, Dr. James F. Pierce 
(jfpierce at pobox.upenn.edu) is very helpful.
I see that, though Penn seems to be the only US library to hold this 
book by a much regretted friend, there are also copies in the British 
Library, Cambridge, Oxford, El Colegio de Mexico, and of course the 
University of Poona.
Best,
Rosane Rocher
