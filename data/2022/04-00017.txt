[INDOLOGY] Access to Sanskrit manuscripts in the Tibet Museum, Lhasa
Dear all,
Is there any access to reproductions of the Sanskrit manuscripts now
preserved in the Tibet Museum in Lhasa?
A catalogue compiled in 1985 by Wang Sen lists 259 such manuscripts. This
catalogue had been almost impossible to find until Haiyan Hu-von Hin?ber
reproduced it as an appendix to an article published in 2006, which I have
posted here:

.
Many of these manuscripts had been described earlier by R?hula S??k?ty?yana in
three articles, which I have posted here: http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/279/.
In particular, I am seeking scans or other reproductions of a manuscript or
manuscripts of the K?lacakra-tantra.
Thanks and best regards,
