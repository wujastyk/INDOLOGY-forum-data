Dear Harry,

TST is a Franco-German project whose focus is the study of paratexts of
(mostly Tamil) manuscripts.
See https://tst.hypotheses.org/

As a first step for this study we catalogue manuscripts in TEI-XML format
files (using an online user-friendly editor set up by Charles Li:
https://tst-project.github.io/editor/).

Our description files are displayed online on our online catalogue (also
set up by Charles Li), along with digital images of the manuscripts, when
available.
See https://tst-project.github.io/mss/
And e.g. https://tst-project.github.io/mss/Indien_0001.xml (in this case
using a IIIF manifest, the digital images which are on Gallica are
displayed with the description)
You will find mostly Tamil manuscripts on this catalogue, but also Sanskrit
ones (search for instance the shelfmark "Sanscrit").

Note that most of the descriptions aren't yet reviewed, but will hopefully
be at the time the funding of the project ends (in September 2022) and that
further updates and corrections as well as addition of catalogue entries
will be possible after September 2022.

With very best wishes.

Manu
