Dear all,
I realize sending the document to everyone was a mistake because I don't know who is interested and I don't want to be spamming everyone. I noticed I mapped one character to a bindu while it was supposed to be a reph and bindu, and that a few bindus are followed by a vowel mark which is illegal. Anyone who is interested in an updated version of the text, feel free to reach out to me offline.
Best regards,
Jan

Did you have any luck with the OCR Oliver?
Try this. Let me know if you run into any errors.

Dear all,
thanks to all who drew my attention to P. Freund, especially to Sesha Vadapalli who sent me the link to his website. There's a web directory with some texts I was not able to locate elsewhere:

(follow e.g. the kalpa/ link)
Best, Oliver
