So beautifully said both of you. This is so sad. He was such a beautiful
person, with great depth of both learning and character. I took Hindu
Mythology with him in 1996. That was my first non-language course in the
department and he was so generous with his learning, but also so kind and
good-natured to me.
I learned so much in that class and it was always so rewarding and fun to
listen to him and interact with him. He started treating me like a friend
even when I was still a stranger, and he was the same way throughout the
time I knew him: an ??????????. It always felt good to talk with him.
I remember seeing him with his family around town sometimes and you could
tell that that they loved him so much, and that they all really enjoyed
spending time together. My heart really goes out to them. The loss must be
so painful and irreparable.
But as you said, Bob, ? ??? ? ??????it is really impossible to think of
Luis without feeling affection toward him and it?s equally impossible to
forget such a distinctive presence. Just thinking about him a little I can
picture his face and his smile so clearly in my mind, and hear the sound of
his voice, so he definitely lives on. And I am just one little vallabha
among many many others. I think everybody who knew him was his vallabha.

It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the
individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a
relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and
its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or
demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for
the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and
that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have
experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their
time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of
someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, *Playing and Reality*
