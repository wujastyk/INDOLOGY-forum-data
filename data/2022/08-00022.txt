As an example of Sandhi in spoken English, I often used, in my classes, the Bronx pronunciation of ?did you eat yet"?:
Jyeet Chet?

Dear Harry,

Another example that comes immediately to mind is the indefinite article: "a" before words beginning with a consonant, "an" before words beginning with a vowel. Here the sandhi is not just a matter of pronunciation but of orthography.

Best wishes,
Michael

Thank you all for these great replies. Howard Resnick gives an example of a spelling change for internal sandhi.  Can someone give me an example of a spelling change for word junction (external) sandhi in a non-Indian language (if such a thing exists?).

English sandhi, n -> m before a labial consonant:

Examples: in-justice but im-possible; in-scrutable, but im-mature.

etc.

Good luck,
Howard
