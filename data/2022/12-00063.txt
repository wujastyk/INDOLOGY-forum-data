[INDOLOGY] National Manuscript Mission data to be put in public
 domain
 <CAJ3b0o9TW1iOB9mXvn2s6=SOmq4pjaz+86+KdZH_W57Syd=LiA@mail.gmail.com>
Dear Harry and list members,
I regret to inform that there has not been compliance to the order by NMM.
I have filed a non-compliance complaint. It was heard in November end.
Order is yet to be received.
In the meanwhile, there seems to be certain manuscripts which are put in
public domain by NMM.
Steps:
1. Visit https://www.bharatiyakritisampada.nic.in/
2. Click on Digital Manuscripts.
3. Search for the manuscript.
I checked with writing only ?a? and searched with the presumption that
every name of title would have at least one ?a? in its spelling. It gave me
a response stating that there are 27,049 manuscripts matching the query. I
have not checked, but it seems that these many manuscripts are available in
digital format for viewing online. If the presumption is good, this is a
substantial improvement.
With best wishes,
Dhaval
