I joined the DMG many years ago in order to gain access to NGMPP
manuscripts from Berlin.  It turned out, after correspondence with the DMG,
that this was not enough.  Only German citizens may have copies of NGMPP
manuscripts from Berlin (or Hamburg, I guess).  Anyone without a German
passport must go to the office of the National Archives in Kathmandu.
