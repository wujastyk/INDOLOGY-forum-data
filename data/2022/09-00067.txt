Dear Murali and Manjunath,
The Sanskrit Library has just published my new Sanskrit textbook in two volumes:
I: Text and exercises, and
II: Appendices.
A description of the two volumes with tables of contents is given on the Sanskrit Library publications page: 
https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html <https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html>
The title of the set, and of each volume are links that take one to Lulu Press?s on-line bookstore.  Lulu is offering a 15% discount now through 23 September by entering the promotion code
ENTERTAIN15
at checkout.
The Sanskrit Library just started a first-year Sanskrit class that uses the text, integrated with an on-line exercise platform that provides immediate help and evaluation.  It is not too late to join the course. See the description and registration link here:

Yours,
Peter
