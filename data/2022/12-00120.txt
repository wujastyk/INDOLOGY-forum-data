Strictly speaking, as Antonia pointed out already, yuddha and yudh mean
both "battle" and not "war", unless we'd like to take them as a synecdoche,
so I don't think they apply in the case of the scene in Arrival. When I
watched it, my first impression of the scene in which the linguist Louise
Banks says that gavisti means desire for cows was that she was trying to
make precisely the point that Antonia made in her tweet. I don't think the
meaning of the whole scene is that if you know the Sanskrit word for war
you are a better linguist, it is more about how you should think about
language. On the other hand, I might be reading too much into it.
Sincerely yours,
Simon Moon
