   - Please find attached the image of the poem from the 1907 UVS 2nd
   edition published by the Tamil University, Tanjavur: 1986
   - It is printed with the seven metrical feet of each line separated by
   spaces and is reproduced below.
   - It shows the extra -m- forced by prosody between puLLuva and mati as
   the foot vamma (???? ).
  ???? ?????? ???? ???? ????? ??? ??????
????? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ?????? ????????
?????? *????* ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????????
??????? ????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????????
   - Actually, the next foot ??? is defective as printed since it is
   invalid as a candidate for a complete foot since it has only one acai
   (prosodic syllable) instead of the required two.
   - So it ought to have been *????? or **???*
   - The option *??? *would most likely have been preferred, as it matches
   ??? the third foot of the next line.
   - The option  *????? *would match  ???? and ?????? in the preceding two
   lines with the nasal stops uniformly supplying the punctuation to all of
   them.
   - But it appears as though the poem has been composed for the first
   choice, with the first and second pair of lines having their own matching
   sound effects:
      -  ???? and ??????
      - *??? *and  ???
  So with that correction we have this
 ???? ?????? ???? ???? ????? ??? ??????
????? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ?????? ????????
?????? ???? *????? *????? ?????? ???? ????????? or
?????? ???? *???* ????? ?????? ???? ?????????
??????? ????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????????
