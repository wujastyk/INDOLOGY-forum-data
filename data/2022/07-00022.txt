[INDOLOGY] =?utf-8?q?Tantrap=C4=81la?=
I wonder if anyone knowledgeable about (north)western India around the 
13th century might have an idea about how the epithet tantrap?la should 
be understood in that context? I am looking at these two verses from an 
astrological text:
kasya sam?pe candro ravimutha?ilage n?patip?r?ve |
?anin? ca mutha?ile ?smin n?c?n?m ijyamutha?ile ca sat?m ||
?ukre?a ca yuvat?n?? j?ena vyavah?ripa??it?n?? ca |
bhaumena <ca> ?atr???? kr?re??n?? ca tantrap?l?n?m ||
'In whose company is the moon? If it forms a /mutha?ila /[Ar. 
/mutta?il/, applying aspect] with the sun, [the querent travels] at the 
side of the king; if it has a /mutha?ila /with Saturn, [at the side] of 
low people, and if a /mutha?ila /with Jupiter, of good people; with 
Venus, of women; with Mercury, with merchants and scholars; with Mars, 
of his enemies, cruel lords and /tantrap?las/.'
The standard dictionaries failling me, I did a simple web search, which 
turned up some suggestions; but the present context seems to call for 
something more warlike, violent and/or sinister than just 'high 
official' or 'secretary of council'.
Thanks in advance for any thoughts,
Martin Gansten
