Dear All,
Dr Shivamurthy Shivacharaya's reaction and refutation of
the unsubstantiated claim that an old puzzle is solved is of special
importance because it is backed up by all derivations  (prakriy?) generated
by his Ganakashtadhyayi software. The derivation of 'guru??' and
?mantrai??, discussed by Dr Shivamurthy Shivacharya, are not given in the
thesis, but at
https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/solving-grammars-greatest-puzzle in the style
of the In Panini We Trust thesis. Dr Shivamurthy Shivacharya shows how
these forms can be conveniently derived and cites the rules involved in
their derivation following the traditional trimuni framework.
As for the "malware" warning: leaving out the underlying technical aspects,
the only problem with this website and the link is that it still has an
http:// address, if it is upgraded to an https:// address there would be no
problem and no "malware" warning from your Antivirus. Although http://
addresses are indeed vulnerable for hacks etc. they are not necessarily by
themselves malware and in this case I think it would not be entirely
irresponsible to give it a try, with all due caution, and open the site
(and if that goes well, install the Ganakashtadhyayi software).
With best regards,
Jan Houben
