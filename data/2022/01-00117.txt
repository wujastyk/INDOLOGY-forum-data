[INDOLOGY] Two PDF Requests - Horstmann and Kiehnle
Greetings Indologists,
I am looking for two PDFs -- one article and one book. Please see below...
Horstmann, Monika. ?The Emergence of the N?thyog? Order in the Light of
I found a URL for Horstmann's article (
http://asiatica.org/ijts/10-1/emergence-nathyogi-order-light-vernacular-sources
), but the PayPal links on the page seem to be broken and I cannot access
the full article. WorldCat requests through my library have gone unanswered.
Kiehnle, Catharina. *Songs on Yoga: Texts and Teachings of the Mah?r???rian
I already own a hard copy of Kiehnle?s two-volume set back in the USA, but
I am currently conducting research in Nepal and international shipping
costs are too expensive. If anyone has scanned a soft copy I would be
greatly appreciative. NOTE: At present, I only need a PDF of the first
volume (ie. *Songs on Yoga*), not the second volume.
Thank you.
*Sincerely,*
