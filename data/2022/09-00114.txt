More than 40 years ago I attended a Talmudic class which discussed the question how a lower being like man can bless a higher being like God. I remember it very vaguely, and may well be mistaken, but I think that blessing in this context was understood to express gratitude. However, I no longer remember the series of steps that took us from blessing to gratitude.
Best wishes, Eli
