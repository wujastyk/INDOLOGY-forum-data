Does someone have the right email address to request digital images of the
photographs of Sanskrit manuscripts taken in Tibet by R?hula S??k?ty?yana
that are now housed at G?ttingen University? I have not had success in
this, nor was a librarian at the G?ttingen University library able to help
so far. I did also write directly to the K. P. Jayaswal Research Institute
in Patna where the original photographs and negatives are held, but did not
receive a reply. A set of photographs of the manuscripts was reportedly
purchased by Gustav Roth and deposited at G?ttingen University a few
decades ago, and that is where some scholars have reported purchasing
digital copies from since then. They were catalogued by Frank Bandurski in
this 1994 book, *Untersuchungen zur buddhistischen Literatur*, pp. 9-126,
which I have posted here:

Thank you in advance for your help with this.
