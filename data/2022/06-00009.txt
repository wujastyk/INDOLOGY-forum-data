announcement)


Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce another new publication:

*Piotr Balcerowicz, Agnieszka Kuszewska: **Kashmir in India and Pakistan
Policies*
<https://www.routledge.com/Kashmir-in-India-and-Pakistan-Policies/Balcerowicz-Kuszewska/p/book/9781138480124>*.
Routledge, 2022. *


This book examines the complex political structures of Pakistan and India
that determine both the Kashmir conflict and the geostrategic environment
underpinning it.

Providing comprehensive knowledge on both historical and contemporary
dynamics of Indo-Pakistani policies and relations, this book combines a
brief history of the Kashmir conflict with thorough politological analysis.
Analyses range from strategic dynamics in the aftermath of bifurcation of
Indian-administered Kashmir, to ideologically motivated and state-led
narratives, security dilemmas, regional and geopolitical dynamics. The book
ultimately aims to investigates which policies India and Pakistan develop
vis-?-vis the territories of former Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir
(PSJ&K) in a balanced and impartial manner. While placing the subject
against the backdrop of Pakistan?s and India?s domestic and international
policies, this book emphasises why Kashmir is so important to both
countries and how it is manifested in their policies.

*Kashmir in India and Pakistan policies* will appeal to students and
scholars of peace and conflict studies, international relations, political
science, and South Asian studies.
