Dear Robert (if I may),

My bad, you are right! It is actually available in its entirety on this other repository (both in html + pdf / it can be downloaded, but chapter by chapter): https://www.cairn.info/le-probleme-des-centaures--9782402522281.htm . Hopefully it works this time.

All the best,

Philippe

Dear Philippe (if I may),

Thank you very much indeed for this pointer, but I was rather hoping not to have to pay as I don't want to read the whole book, merely to check something, and I don't see a way of accessing this pdf here (for example, through my library) other than by paying. But perhaps I am missing something?

My best wishes,

Robert

Dear colleagues,

I don't suppose anyone has a pdf of G. Dum?zil's 1929 book

Le Probl?me des Centaures. ?tude de mythologie compar?e Indo-Europ?ene

that they're willing to share?

Many of his books are available on archive.org<http://archive.org/>, but not this one it seems. I'd be very grateful if anyone can help.

Many thanks!

Robert
