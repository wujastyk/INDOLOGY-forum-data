Colleagues,
Can somebody please point me to the web address for the EPB online? The link at <http://www.indologie.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=120> is defunct.
Related to this, I am curious why Vy?sa has the epithet Kr???advaip?yana (and why application of grammatical rules doesn't lead to K?r??adv?p?yana).
Thanks, and best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
