[INDOLOGY] Indic rendering
Dear all,
I am doing a review of Indic scripts rendering mechanisms, and I would be interested if anyone had issues that they had run into during their work. Examples I am aware of include Vedic signs not working on anusvara, nuktas not working on vowels and similar.
If any of you had troubles getting any of the Indic scripts behave on computers the way you wanted, feel free to reach out to me with details offline.
Thank you and best regards,
Jan
