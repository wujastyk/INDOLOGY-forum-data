Dear Harry,
Chapter 4 (titled, "Krishna, the *Gita*, and the Indian Nation," pp.
115-153) of Richard H. Davis's *The Bhagavad Gita: A Biography* (Princeton
U Press, 2015), certainly provides insight into the text's spread
throughout India in the modern period. Jnanadeva's work in Marathi,
*Jnaneshwari
*was the first vernacular reworking of the text in the "medieval" period, I
think, so perhaps looking into some of the scholarship on that might be
helpful.
