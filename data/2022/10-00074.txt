Sharing a Telugu video clip  from eastern Andhra Pradesh in which this
yogic 'minstrel' (?) is singing a lyric while seeking alms as part of his
life style. The lyric mentions Advaita mahaa vaakyas.
A friend who shot this a few days ago on his mobile phone was asking me for
the source of this lyric.
I told him that it is a song called Krishna Rukminee Samvaadamu, a
traditional 'folk song' that got documented during the late
nineteenth century when folk song collection and publication activity was
picking up.
There is a huge amount of such lyrics, called tattvams in Telugu in various
forms including lullabies, work songs ,  bairaagi songs etc., which contain
Hatha Yoga mixed Advaitic ideas , that are associated with Yogi mathas that
include Scheduled Caste individuals alongside others as Gurus and Sishyas.
