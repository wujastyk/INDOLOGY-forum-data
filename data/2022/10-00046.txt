[INDOLOGY] buddha quote
Dear Friends,
Might anyone know what the source of this translated quote might be either
directly taken or inspired from?
*In the end, only three things matter: How much you loved, how gently you
lived, and how gracefully you let go of things not meant for you - Gautama
Buddha*
Thank you.
All the best,
