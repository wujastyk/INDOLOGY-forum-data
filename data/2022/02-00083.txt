[INDOLOGY] Short and sweet?
In a Sanskrit text probably originating in 13th-century Gujarat, I just 
came across this line:
yas t?jikabh???y?? s?k?masv?du? ca sahamas?da iti |
This is a reference to the Arabic term /sahm as-sa??da/ (the Lot of 
Fortune, an astrological concept). But I am puzzled by the designation 
s?k?masv?du, which I have never seen before that I can recall, and 
certainly not applied to an abstract concept. Does it ring a bell with 
anyone? Is it an idiomatic expression that I have failed to pick up?
Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
