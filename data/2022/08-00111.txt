Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bleeding stones
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf8dtHQkayYfNmi9f7vLSNk0ytAES++UDTxpry9BnQxvfg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

Maybe someone can help me with this. I am looking for either any
bibliographical reference to or any paper that mentions the bleeding stones
in South or Southeast Asia, or a particular one (except for K?m?khy?).
Many thanks in advance!

Sincerely,
Paolo
