The recension, which is decisively closer to the original (Kashmirian)  
version of the work than all later versions, bears the title Mok?op?ya  
and, also according to the Kashmirian tradition (cp. the commentary  
[Mok?op?ya??k?] of Bh?skaraka??ha [18th century] ad Mok?op?ya I.1.3;  
II.18.2f; III.8.8; VI.224.1), was written by a human author whose name  
has not been handed down (cp. now Walter Slaje: "Vasi??ha the Void.  
Inquiries into the Authorship of the Mok?op?ya", in: Zeitschrift f?r  
Indologie und S?dasienstudien 37/2020, pp. 168-204). The still widely  
used book title ?Yogav?si??ha? - unlike Mok?op?ya - does not appear  
anywhere in the text itself, but only in the colophons of a few  
manuscripts in addition to the title Mok?op?ya (sg./pl.).
The numerous later abridgments and excerpts are not attributed to  
V?lm?ki even by the Indian tradition. In the colophons of the  
manuscripts of what is now called "Laghuyogav?si??ha", sometimes a  
certain Abhinanda or alternatively an anonymous K??m?rapa??ita is  
named as the author/redactor, although the authorship must still be  
considered unclear for various reasons (cp. Susanne Stinner: "S?ras,  
Sa?grahas und 'Laghus': Kurzfassungen des Mok?op?ya", in: The  
Mok?op?ya, Yogav?si??ha and related texts. Ed. J?rgen Hanneder. Aachen  
2005, pp. 91-104, esp. 102-104).
The excerpt known today under the book title "Yogav?si??has?ra"  
(original title V?si??has?ra, ?as is clearly indicated in Mah?dhara?s  
commentary?*) in about 200 stanzas, which was edited by Peter Thomi  
(Wichtrach 1999) and has survived in numerous manuscripts, must have  
been compiled before the year 1597 (= date of the commentary [viv?tti]  
of Mah?dhara on this abridgement). Its author is not known.
