The Telugu equivalent of eNRu , ani and its function in contemporary Telugu
is studied by late Prof. Chekuri Rama Rao , which I know from his Telugu
essay, " Telugu lo ani chese pani " = work ani does in Telugu / function of
ani in Telugu, probably A Telugu version of a portion of his PhD
dissertation submitted to University of Pennsylvania on  " Nominalization
in Telugu Syntax" .
ani is the past nonfinite form (ktvaarthaka form, to use the Sanskrit term,
) of the verb anu = say. (Same is the case with  eNRu    of Tamil)
As such, the 'productivity' is of the verb anu =say , not of the form ani
which is the expression comparable to iti. ( Same goes with Tamil  eNRu   )
ani is a derivative of a verb root whereas iti is avyaya ,  derivation or
root  of which within Sanskrit is not clear.
Use of iti in vyaakhyaana granthas as in the ending of the expression of
the text, commentary of which follows iti
its use in usages such as ityaadayah at the end of lists,
and more such usages of iti in Sanskrit don't seem to have Dravidian
equivalents.
