[INDOLOGY] Correction: Indian linguistic studies in honor of George
 Cardona
Dear Colleagues,
	As announced a couple of weeks ago, The Sanskrit Library has just published two volumes I edited consisting of 37 papers on linguistics and related disciplines in honor of Professor George Cardona.  The first volume contains 18 papers on Indian grammatical traditions (vy?kara?a) and cognitive linguistics (??bdabodha).  The second volume contains 19 papers on archaeology, historical linguistics, Vedic, philosophy and critical editing.  The papers, by prominent scholars world-wide, make essential contributions to these fields.  Many of the papers make ground-breaking or critical contributions.  The Sanskrit Library publications page
https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html <https://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html>
contains links to full descriptions of each volume, lists of the contributors, and tables of contents.
Now through 6 May, Lulu is offering 15% off.
Use code REACHOUT15
Please consider acquiring these volumes for yourself or your institution?s library.
On the occasion of Professor Cardona?s 86th birthday, 3 June at 10:30am U.S. Eastern Time (9:30 Central Time), The Sanskrit Library will host a Zoom event dedicating the volumes to him and inviting a few of the younger contributors who have seldom had the opportunity to share their work with Professor Cardona to discuss their contributions with him.  Details and a Zoom link will be sent closer to the occasion.  In the meantime, please save the date.
Yours,
Peter
