[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit inscription in Egypt?
Dear colleagues,
Some weeks ago I saw a reference on Facebook to the recent discovery of a
Sanskrit inscription in Egypt, said to be dated to the reign of the Roman
emperor Philip "the Arab" (244-249 CE). But I haven't been able to find any
further information about this. Has anyone heard any more about this?
