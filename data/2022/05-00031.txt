Dear All,


A reminder (with apologies for crossposting) about the two Jain Studies
prizes that UC Davis has instituted this year. The deadline is just in a
couple of weeks--May 16, 2022. We've gotten some questions about
circulation about materials submitted and we want to clarify that materials
submitted, including the winning entries, will not be circulated,
published, or shared, beyond the members of the prize committee.
