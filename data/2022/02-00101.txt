Hello Aleix,

For your interest, you should consult the ?ik?? and Pr?ti??khya literature.
A good introduction will be W.S. Allen's book "Phonetics in Ancient India."
For details, you may consult the Introduction to my edition of the
?aunak?ya Catur?dhy?yik? published in the Harvard Oriental Studies. The
bibliography in that book may give you comprehensive references to research
publications on this subject.
