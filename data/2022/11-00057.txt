Message-ID: <CALPiqitoSCmWBde2CffPytNoOoTKRPdB4FGXGaQ7d0bHWH8Q9A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I would be very grateful if you advised me, privately or publicly, on the
important upcoming conferences, panels,
workshops, etc., which will be dedicated to the history and development of
Indian and, especially,
Buddhist meditation and yoga, except those of the World Sanskrit Conference
and IABS.
