[INDOLOGY] Nagari conversion
Dear all,
I came across this digitized version of the Drahyayana Srauta Sutra:
http://www.hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/kalpa/shrauta/drahyayana_shrauta_sutra.pdf
Everything seems fine, but when I try to copy-paste the text, the result
for the first line looks like:
{;?;y,?*tsU]m
(This should be the name of the text.)
Does anybody know how to obtain readable Devanagari from this kind of
custom encoding?
Best, Oliver
