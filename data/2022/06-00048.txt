Dear all,

I came across this digitized version of the Drahyayana Srauta Sutra:

http://www.hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/kalpa/shrauta/drahyayana_shrauta_sutra.pdf

Everything seems fine, but when I try to copy-paste the text, the result
for the first line looks like:

{;?;y,?*tsU]m

(This should be the name of the text.)

Does anybody know how to obtain readable Devanagari from this kind of
custom encoding?

Best, Oliver
