In the ?peripheries? throughout monsoon Asia, magical, shamanic and supernatural milieus have been attested since early history, although all pre-colonial evidence was provided by a self-proclaimed socio-religious ?centre?. The colonial ideology of a ?centre? against the ?margins? is a misleading understanding of Indic religious phenomena. Indeed, medieval kings were often involved in performing extreme and dangerous rituals that had the secular purpose of strengthening their social position against internal and external enemies (Rosati 2017). Nonetheless, magic-shamanic religious practices and supernatural experiences were deliberately placed outside of mainstream Indic religions during the colonial period due to their intrinsic danger. On the other hand, several magic-shamanic practices were reformulated as elements not belonging to the magic-shamanic milieu but to the religious mainstream. From both Buddhism and Hindu traditions there are several examples of  misleading interpretation. Among these practices, we could enumerate the dream experiences and visions of the Bodhisattva, which are avoided to be interpreted as shamanic dreams, or the siddhis which are defined by the textual scholars in every sense, but not in connection with the word magic (e.g. Sanderson 1988), although they are powers that overcome the laws of nature (Rosati [forthcoming]).



This special issue analyses ecstatic possession, shapeshifting or therianthropy, healing abilities, apotropaic and harmful magic, alchemy, flying ability, and many other phenomena related to the magical and shamanic tradition are analyzed. The aim of this special issue is to examine the overlap, intersection and superimposition between vernacular, folk, tribal, tantric, and pan-Indian religions in order to outline the role of magical-shamanic and supernatural phenomena in the monsoon Asian periphery and in mainstream socio-religious milieus.
