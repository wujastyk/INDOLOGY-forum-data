In ny book, The Tawny One, I suggest rhat the collapse of Bronze Age
civilizations, including the Indus, and subsequent, large-scale human
migrations (which have been noted by several historians),, was probably due
to the eruption of the Santorini volcano (north of Crete) in 1615 BCE).
This was the largest volcanic eruption on earth since the last ice age.
Trade routes and food chains would have been severely disrupted.
Best, Matthew Clark.
