Dear Scholars,
The Bh?gavata-pur??a often gives different versions of events found in the Mah?bh?rata. In trying to ascertain when Satyavat?, mother of Vy?sa, retired to the forest or simply passed away, I found two apparently incompatible accounts.
In the Mah?bh?rata CE, beginning at 1.119.5, Vy?sa comes to his mother at P???u?s funeral, and essentially tells her that bad times are coming, and she should renounce the world. She then leaves the Kuru capital with her two daughters-in-law, Ambik? and Amb?lik?.
In the Bh?gavata-pur??a 1.10.9-10, Satyavat? is remarkably still present in royal affairs much later. Indeed she is among the royals lamenting K???a?s departure for Dv?rak? after the Kuruk?etra battle.
Interestinglly, Vettam Mani gives only the Mah?bh?rata version in his Pur??ic Encyclopedia.
Are there additional versions or other insights?
Thanks!
