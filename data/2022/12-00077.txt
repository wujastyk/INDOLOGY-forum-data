Dear Rishi, Dear Madhav and Dear All,
Rishi Rajpopat has presented a very well reflected and researched work on
P?nini's grammar which deserves close attention and analysis by specialists.
As I have pointed out a little while ago (Houben 2003), "Cardona's P??ini:
A Survey of Research (1976), giving a bibliographic overview plus a
systematic and critical discussion of all research done up to 1975" has  a
bibliographic part (p. 3-136) which "is nearly complete within the limits
the author had set for himself, while the systematic part (p. 139-371, the
Survey proper) can serve as an excellent introduction to the field, the
achievements up to 1975, the major issues of scholarly discussion, the
principal views on these issues as defended by various scholars, and the
evidence on which they based themselves."The problem of "Rule order and the
application of rules" is discussed by George Cardona (1976) on pages
189-191. On p. 190 he mentions Faddegon (1936), Scharfe (1961), Shefts
(1961), Vidya Niwas Mishra (1966), and himself (1970a) as scholars who
accept that "1.4.2 applies only in the section headed by 1.4.1".
In view of  (1) this statement in 1976; (2) Cardona 1970a; (3) the absence
of the formulation of any exceptions to the position taken in Cardona 1970a
and 1976; (6) the organic suitability of Cardona 1970a and 1976 to his
passionate and well-reflected and widely attested endeavour to give full
value to the commentarial tradition, we can, I believe, safely infer that
there is little chance that he would deviate from this in the case under
discussion. Even after Cardona 1976, Joshi and Roodbergen in their
A???dhy?y? of P??ini vol. 4, pp. 14, accept that "1.4.2 applies only in the
section headed by 1.4.1" and note that Faddegon only "casually notes" that
AA 1.4.2 is a paribh??? valid upto AA 2.2: to this we should add that the
Faddegon does define, as the main topic of his study, the principles on the
basis of which he accepts the validity of AA 1.4.2 up to AA 2.2 only.
With regard to the main thesis, it is attempted to show that it is
*possible* to take AA 1.4.2 viprati?edhe para? k?ryam as applicable
throughout the A???dhy?y? with an interpretation of the rule that differs
considerably from those proposed by P??in?yas.
What does not emerge in a convincing way is: why in that case the rule is
placed immediately after AA 1.4.1 ? ka??r?d ek? sa?j??, and the detailed
answer to this question given by Barend Faddegon has not been refuted.
Moreover, by making the rule AA 1.4.2 viprati?edhe para? k?ryam apply in a
very different domain than where it was till now thought to be applicable
on account of its position in the s?trap??ha -- and, more specifically, in
conflict with the evident adhik?ra function of AA 1.4.1 -- creates a lacuna
precisely in the formulation of rules in that section.
If we do not want to use this reference to authority to entirely dismiss
our young colleague Rajpopat's well-researched thesis, we can see how far
we can come if we join him, preliminarily and sketchily, in his
argumentation.
Although unsurmountable from a strict traditional approach, a solution to
the problem pointed out above -- since for this rule this has already been
done by all modern scholars in the field -- could be the following:
if and only if a thorough review of all the cases and the argument
presented by Rajpopat are accepted for his new application (where the
post-P?nini tradition has worked with siddha/asidddha etc.), the rule
viprati?edhe para? k?ryam should have been placed earlier in the
s?trap??ha, before AA 1.4.1ff, because even if the search for the strict
application of linearity in the post-Pata?jali tradition shows that this
principle was not there in the grammar as conceived by P??ini in the
s?trap??ha and Annexes as he accepted them, and even if we accept Joshi and
Kiparsky's argument that the explicit statements on siddha and asiddha
imply the default acceptation of a sarvatra siddham principle, this cannot
mean that the statement of the rules was in an entirely arbitrary manner:
here we see that the entire s?trap??ha shows a Triple Dichotomy (see my
"P?nini sans d?tour", conf?rences de l'ann?e 2013-2014,
https://journals.openedition.org/ashp/1748), with a first division into a
parsing part (Adhy?ya 1-5) and a prakriy? part (Adhy?ya 6-8), which
provides a meaningful position to each section and to the rules within each
section (even the Prakriy? works or "reordered grammars" which do not do
away with P?nini's s?trap??ha but supplement it often take regarding any
given topic entire continuous series of s?tras as they were given by
P?nini).
However, if the rule viprati?edhe para? k?ryam is placed earlier in the
s?trap??ha, before AA 1.4.1ff, the application in the more restricted
domain of AA 1.4, would not have been evident -- that is, not sufficiently
anchored in the teaching in P??ini's school -- and, moreover, the meaning
of the terms used in the rule would have been different. It would, then, be
necessary to have the rule twice: both at an earlier place in the
s?trap??ha and where it is now. For the sake of l?ghava the rule was
nevertheless read at only one place, where its absence would have been most
problematic, although it stands for both rules.
Whereas this is open to further discussion, Rajpopat's argument goes
entirely wrong where he writes:
"Houben is not in favour of perceiving the A???dhy?y? as a derivational
machine, thereby also implicitly dismissing both the concept of linearity
and consistent conflict-resolution procedures."
However "Houben 2003" (i.e., "Three Myths in Modern P??inian Studies" which
is a critical review of and supplement to Cardona 1999) does not accept the
A???dhy?y? as a "derivational machine" because it shows it is a
"reconstitutive" machine -- it is more like a 4th century BCE
spelling-and-grammar checker than a grammar in any modern term of the word
-- and by this neither the linearity (to the extent this is inherent in the
A???dhy?y? as s?trap??ha) nor the presence of conflict-resolution
procedures (which are explicitly stated in the A???dhy?y?, even in the main
rule under discussion in Rajpopat's thesis, whether interpreted according
to the P??in?yas or according to Rajpopat) are rejected in the "machine"
part of the grammar, which is so impressive that it makes us overlook the
importance of the unformalizable domains of the sentence and sentence
meaning as the main units of language and the beginning and end point of
the progressive re-creation (prakriy?) of words which are syntactically
connected (another way of saying that they presuppose a sentence or part of
a sentence).
See now also my ?The Art of Grammar in Context: ?Science?, Human Interest,
and the Construction of Cultural and Political Worlds.? In: *Science and
Scientification in South Asia and Europe* (ed. by Axel Michaels and
Christoph Wulf): 13-41. London: Routledge, 2020.
(Houben 2020, p. 18: "On the rules, skilfully formulated by several
generations of grammarians up to P??ini, a formalism was superimposed and
finally brought to perfection by P??ini. Behind it, the skilful and even
artful choices of description all but disappeared except to the discerning
eye of a few critical thinkers, including the earliest great
grammarian-philosopher in the P??inian tradition, Bhart?hari (fifth century
CE), who at a few occasions emphasised the ?arbitrariness? of the
descriptive choices").
That for K?ty?yana and Pata?jali and many P??in?yas P??ini?s grammar as a
closed system of rules and metarules was not a given but a challenge is
borne out not only by Pata?jali?s discussions themselves and works such as
N?ge?a?s Paribh??endu?ekhara, but also by (unduly neglected) P??in?yas such
as N?r?ya?a Bha??a, author of the Prakriy?sarvasva (Houben 2015 ?P??inian
grammar of living Sanskrit: features and principles of the
Prakriy?-Sarvasva of N?r?ya?a-Bha??a of Melputt?r,? *Bulletin d??tudes
Indiennes* (BEI) vol. 32, pp. 149-170.) , for whom the metarules, often in
the same wording as the paribh??as of N?ge?a and numerous predecessors, are
explicitly presented as ny?yas, ?rules of thumb?. P??in?yas such as
Bha??oj? D?k?ita and N?ge?a Bha??a have discovered regularity and
occasionally constructed it where it was not there, just as regularity was
apparently occasionally lost (*na veti vibh?.s?*) even at the time of
Pata?jali.
With best wishes for the festive season,
