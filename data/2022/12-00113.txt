I recall that there was discussion here on INDOLOGY of this term at the
time that the film Arrival came out (in which the term plays an important
role).  I'm sorry that the search function of the INDOLOGY archives is
still not working as well as it should, but perhaps someone with a
collection of past emails can fetch the discussion.
Best,
Dominik
