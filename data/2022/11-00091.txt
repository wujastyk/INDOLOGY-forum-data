Dear Colleagues and Friends,
if you are interested in Ny?ya, the Ny?yas?travivara?a, textual criticism, the processing of text-critical data, computational phylogenetics, how multidimensional scaling (MDS) can be used to analyze relationships between different versions of a text, manuscriptology, paleography and/or South Indian writing systems, the following publication may be for you:
A South Indian Digest of Commentaries on the Ny?yas?tra, Gambh?rava??aja?s Ny?yas?travivara?a, First Adhy?ya
The Ny?yas?travivara?a, written in the first centuries of the 2nd millennium CE, provides the most accessible introduction to the core teachings of old Ny?ya. Excerpting from the two earliest and most important treatises of this tradition?the Ny?yabh??ya and Ny?yav?rttika?Gambh?rava??aja created a comprehensive yet concise digest.
The present work contains not only a critical edition of the first chapter based on all known textual sources but also a complete documentation of the variants, a comprehensive study of the parallel passages, a detailed discussion of the preparation and processing of the text-critical data, and a detailed documentation of the Grantha Tamil, Telugu and Kannada scripts.

Have an excellent week!
Cheers,
