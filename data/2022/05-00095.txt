It is especially interesting that the vowels use a ring form of pulli in contrast with the dot pulli on consonants!
Thanks,
Jan

You can see the pu??i on initial vowel in the commentary to the Na???l c?ttiram which reads
?????? ?????? ?????? ????????????
?????? ???? ???????? ??????
[tollai va?ivi?a vell? ve?uttum??
