This is neither here nor there, but K?emendra makes a playful pun on this
in his *De?opade?a, *which maybe can be translated like this:

A fraudulent physician is a swindler without a heart (*h?daya*), that is,
he doesn?t possess
knowledge of V?gbha?a?s *Heart of Medicine*. He is not collected (*sa?graha*),
that is, he
doesn?t possess knowledge of V?gbha?a?s *Medical Collection* (*sa?graha*).
Being full of
faults (*do?in*), he doesn?t diagnose the humors (*do?a*). He is a vagrant (
*caraka*), but he
doesn?t understand the *Compendium of Caraka*.

*h?dayav?no dh?rta? sa?graharahita? sa va?cako vaidya? |*
*vakti na do??n do?? caraka? caraka? na j?n?ti ||* 8.34



Take care,
Eric
