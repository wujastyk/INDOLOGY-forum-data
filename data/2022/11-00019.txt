Dear colleagues,
I need to consult a number of passages from the 4th chapter of the
*Vy?khy?yukti
*(and those corresponding to them
in the *??k?*). It seems that the best critical edition of those is that of
T. Horiuchi (?? ??),
????????: ?????????????, ?? : ??????. 2009.
I would be grateful if someone could share it with me.
With kind regards,
Gleb Sharygin
