[EXTERNAL SENDER]
Dear list members,
This was posted on another forum.
Decades ago GOI established a body to formulate Sanskrit/Hindi equivalents for scientific terms. I have seen their publication, but I don't remember the bibliog?aphic details.

Can anyone identify this publication, or better yet have a link to an on-line version of it?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
