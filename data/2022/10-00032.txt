Dear Matthew,

The article you are looking for appeared in 2014:

Michael Hahn: ???kyarak?ita?s V?ttam?l?viv?ti on J??na?r?mitra?s  
V?ttam?l?stuti (2)?, Minami Ajia Kotengaku (= South Asian Classical  
Studies) 9 (2014), pp. 1?64.

S. my attached "Supplementary Bibliography", which can also be  
downloaded here:
https://www.academia.edu/44168358/Michael_Hahn_Supplementary_Bibliography_

I do not know if the article is available as a soft copy, but I have  
an offprint on paper that I could scan, in case no soft copy can be  
found.

Best wishes,
Roland
