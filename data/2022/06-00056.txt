[INDOLOGY] Nagari conversion
Dear all,
thanks to all who drew my attention to P. Freund, especially to Sesha
Vadapalli who sent me the link to his website. There's a web directory
with some texts I was not able to locate elsewhere:
https://peterffreund.com/Vedic_Literature/
(follow e.g. the kalpa/ link)
Best, Oliver
