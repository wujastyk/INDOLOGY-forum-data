The Vr?tya bands of youthful warriors (see my ?Roots of Hinduism? 2015, p. 134ff.) are connected with wolves/dogs and they go back to Proto-Ind-European  or at least to Proto-Indo-Iranian times: see p. 135 (with more references to the vr?tyas) in the exciting article of David Anthony and Dorcas Brown (2017), who have found related archaeological evidence at the site of Krasnosamarskoe belonging to the Srubnaya-Andronovo horizon of the Eurasian steppes (1900-1200 BCE): ?The dogs of war: A Bronze Age initiation ritual in the Russian steppes?, Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 48: 134-148.
