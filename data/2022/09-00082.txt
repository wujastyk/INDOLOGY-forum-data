Dear Prof Torella,

My suspicion is that it could be the Jammu and Kashmir Archives Department that also has a small collection of Mss and is located in Lal Mandi in Srinagar. Remote possibilities are also that it may belong to Sri Pratap Singh Museum or Jammu & Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages.

The stamp is not completely visible, and therefore it is hard to point out at the exact repository. I am sorry if this is not very helpful. Best.

Mrinal

The only cue is the incomplete stamp from which I can only gather that it is a Government library of Kashmir (apparently not the famous Research Department Library of Srinagar, whose stamp know to me is different). Any help would be greatly appreciated.
