[INDOLOGY] help with a stamp
Dear Prof Torella,
My suspicion is that it could be the Jammu and Kashmir Archives Department that also has a small collection of Mss and is located in Lal Mandi in Srinagar. Remote possibilities are also that it may belong to Sri Pratap Singh Museum or Jammu & Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages.
The stamp is not completely visible, and therefore it is hard to point out at the exact repository. I am sorry if this is not very helpful. Best.
