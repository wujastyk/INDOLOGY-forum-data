[INDOLOGY] Human Rights Violations in Kashmir (publication
 announcement)
Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce still another new publication:
*Piotr Balcerowicz, Agnieszka Kuszewska: **Human Rights Violations in
Kashmir*
<https://www.routledge.com/Human-Rights-Violations-in-Kashmir/Balcerowicz-Kuszewska/p/book/9781032048499>*.
Routledge, 2022. *
The book is a comprehensive study on human rights in Kashmir in relation to
the dynamics of Indo-Pakistani policies, providing a structured and
interdisciplinary approach to the subject.
Whilst surveying some of the most appalling case studies of human rights
abuses, the book offers a methodical analysis of the structural and
structured human rights violations in the divided Kashmir and placing them
in a much broader context of South Asian politics. The book examines root
causes responsible for a human rights violations-prone environment and
climate of impunity in which the actors perpetrate their crimes unpunished,
unwrapping legal and extralegal nexus behind the crimes.
*Human Rights Violations in Kashmir* will appeal to students and scholars
of peace and conflict studies, international relations, human rights
studies and South Asian studies.
