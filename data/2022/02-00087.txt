Thanks for all suggestions so far, and especially to Walter and Dan for 
their thoughts on the Persian and Arabic possibilities. Perhaps I should 
have given a little more background; let me do so now.

The Sanskrit author is Samarasi?ha 
<https://doi.org/10.1163/25425552-12340005>, and the verse occurs in his 
P?cchodde?a (more commonly known among later authors simply as 
Samarasi?hat?jika or -??stra, with variants). That text is an abridged 
Sanskrit version of several Arabic works on astrology, primarily by Sahl 
ibn Bishr; the Sanskrit title is probably meant as a free translation of 
Kit?b fi l-mas??il wa-l-a?k?m ('Book on questions and judgements'). So 
Samarasi?ha did know Arabic quite well, which seems to preclude the 
otherwise very attractive possibility of a 'creative misunderstanding' 
suggested by Walter.

The technical term sahm in Arabic-language astrology is a calque of the 
Greek ?????? 'lot' (as in casting lots); the phrase sahm as-sa??da 
translates ?????? ??? ????? 'lot of fortune' (often semi-Sanskritized as 
pu?ya-sahama). Astrological lots are mathematically derived points on 
the ecliptic signifying various things, from the fairly abstract (e.g., 
fortune) to the very concrete and specific (e.g., camels ). The chapter 
from which the line in question was taken goes on to discuss 48 such 
'saham?ni', using that term repeatedly.

I didn't give the full verse because it is corrupt (so far I have seen 
only a single MS of the text): the scribe seems to have mixed up two 
verses, so that the sentence is incomplete, which makes it even more of 
a challenge to make sense of the s?k?masv?du? (or, indeed, s?k?ma? 
sv?du? ca). Perhaps the missing bit would have explained it! I just 
wondered whether this were a set phrase that I was unaware of. Perhaps 
Samarasi?ha just meant to express his appreciation of the mellifluous 
quality of the 'T?jika language' is general, and/or the phrase sahm 
as-sa??da in particular?

Best wishes,
Martin
