[INDOLOGY] Digital Editions of Sanskrit texts

Dear List members
A warm thanks to Dr. Ruppel, Prof. Olivelle, Dr Birch and others for their
responses and further questions.
To clarify one question: by digital edition I mean not a digital text of
the sort available on GRETIL for example, but something more, like this:
https://editions.byzantini.st/ChronicleME/#/home
As you will see above, the digital edition of the Chronicle of Matthew of
Edessa by Dr Tara Andrews and her team, is an interactive critical edition,
including graphs, maps, the transcriptions of all the manuscripts used
available for view and much more that you wouldn't, or perhaps are unable
to, include in a regular printed critical edition. Also one could
potentially show a text as multiple historically protean texts rather than
the single archetype we reconstruct in traditional philology.  I found this
exciting and was hoping to develop something like it but with many more
layers of content, something dense and rich.
I hope that explains a bit more what I was after.
Thank you
Bihani
