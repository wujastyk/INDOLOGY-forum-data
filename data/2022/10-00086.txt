Dear list members,
I've been told a text called prapa?cas?rasa?graha contains several dhyana
shlokas to Dhanvantari. But I'm not clear what text is meant by
prapa?cas?rasa?graha.  I see references to this text on the internet.
But on archive.org I only see:
a) prapa?cas?ratantra attributed to ?a?kar?c?rya
b) prapa?cas?ras?rasa?graha by G?rv??endra ?arasvati

Any ideas would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
