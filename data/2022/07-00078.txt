[INDOLOGY] Seven types of ascetics
In his B?hajj?taka, Var?hamihira lists seven types of ascetics 
corresponding to the seven planets: /??ky?j?vikabhik?uv?ddhacarak? 
nirgranthavany??an??/. A few centuries later, the commentator 
Bha??otpala elaborates slightly on these, citing the authorities 
Va?k?lak?c?rya (writing in Prakrit) and Saty?c?rya. These passages are 
discussed in Basham's /History and Doctrines of the ?j?vikas/ (p. 168 
ff., giving the Prakrit author's name as K?lak?c?rya). I am wondering if 
any further research on these ascetic categories has been published 
after Basham's book, which is now more than 70 years old. In particular, 
I am curious about the categories v?ddha (identified by Bha??otpala as 
K?p?likas) and caraka (which he says are cakradharas). All suggestions 
are welcome.
Best wishes,
