Dear list members,
Attached is a wetransfer link to pictures of a Kavadi procession  sponsored
by a Subrahmanya-Ayyappa temple in the village I live in Quebec. Except for
the U-Haul trucks you'd thing you were in southern India.Note these
pictures show people doing austerities related to the Kavadi celebration..
