An example that always made sense to me, because it adds a phonetic instance of a rule I was taught that helped me very much with this concept ?Sanskrit abhors a hiatus?: 
The way we pronounce ?the? differently as in the animal vs the dog. To say the animal using the same pronunciation as we use with the dog provokes an awkward phonetic hiatus. This helped me into it what was going on with sandhi
