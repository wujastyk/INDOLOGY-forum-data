[INDOLOGY] five designations of tithis
Dear colleagues,
In Louis-Charles Damais' study ??tudes d??pigraphie indon?sienne, IV: Discussion de la date des inscriptions? (Bulletin de l??cole fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient 47 (1) [https://doi.org/10.3406/befeo.1955.5406], p. 70 n. 1) one reads about "cinq qualifications des tithi". According to the author, there are five such designations for tithis, i.e.
- Nand? (tithi # 1, 6 and 11 waxing or waning)
- ?hadr? (tithi # 2, 7 and 12 waxing or waning)
- Jay? (tithi # 3, 8 and 13 waxing or waning)
- Rikt? (tithi # 4, 9 et 14 waxing or waning)
- P?r?? (tithi # 5, 10 and 15 waxing or waning)
He cites (11th-c.) Javanese epigraphical occurrences of three of these designations, but does not cite his source for the whole system.
Does it have its origin in Indian jyoti???stra? I'd be grateful for references.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
