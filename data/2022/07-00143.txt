>From the Preface:
"The learned br?hmin who composed the text is clearly recommending a
?civilised? Tantrism conforming to the *dharma*. Tantrism had become part
of correct behaviour. Violence is part of the game ? human sacrifice too ?
but is mythologised, ritualised, moralised."
As a philologist of the school of Jan Gonda, the author explains
"I wanted to give the floor to the text itself, and to figure out what the
Teachings have to say before anybody else, including myself."
He further explains that
"That is why I am including many fragments in text and translation, thereby
supported by manuscripts, which were at my disposal when I started this
research. At the same time, I wanted to expose the K?lik?pur??a, because
the work deserves attention. Even now, after the study of Tantrism took
such an impressive sprint forward, the K?lik? Pur??a remains relatively
unexplored. What this Pur??a has to offer in extensively presenting Tantric
knowledge is remarkable and valuable. The text frequently plays its own
guru and explains itself. The Tantric portion certainly does not belong to
the genre of concise, sometimes deliberately obscure, Tantric treatises
meant for the initiated s?dhaka, but represent an open Pur??ic Tantrism.
Nevertheless, the ?iva?s teaching is based on a Bhairava Tantra, as the
text itself reveals , but polished and abridged in order to make the
contents suitable to a lay audience, in this case, no doubt, a royal patron
of K?mar?pa."
