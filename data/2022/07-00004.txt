Dear Rich,
     I see a March 29 message on FaceBook by Shailen Bhandare:
"The recording of our presentation on interesting "transcultural" findings
from the excavations at Berenike is now on-line. I present an exciting
discovery - the first ever Sanskrit inscription found in Egypt, dated in
the reign of Roman Emperor Philip 'the Arab'! It is a dedicatory
inscription left by a Kshatriya named Vasula, and undoubtedly of a Buddhist
nature as indicated by its colophon. Thanks again to Steve Sidebotham and
Team Berenike!"
Shailen Bhandare will be the best source of information on this topic.
