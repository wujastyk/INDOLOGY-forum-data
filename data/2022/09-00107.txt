Bhagav?n ?r? K???a, the Blessed Lord Krishna
Thank you Tracy for this. * "Blessed" *is exactly what I need. And of
course thank you to everyone else who answered, Rajam, Donald Davis, Dean
Michael Anderson, and Matthew Kapstein.
"Blessed" is a little more concise than this definition of bhagavat in the
Vishnu Purana translated by Sw. Tyag???nanda
"That which is imperceptible, undecaying, inconceivable, unborn,
inexhaustible, indestructible; which has neither form, nor hands, nor
feet, which is almighty, omnipresent, eternal; the cause of all things
and without cause, permeating all, itself unpenetrated, and from which
all things proceed, that is the object which the wise behold, that is
Brahman, that is the Supreme State, that is the thing spoken of by the
Vedas, the infinitely subtle, supreme condition of viSNu.  That Essence
of the Supreme is defined by the term Bhagavat;  the word Bhagavat is
the denotation of that primeval and eternal God; and he who fully
understands the meaning of that expression is possessed of holy wisdom,
the sum and substance of the three vedas. The word Bhagavat is a
convenient form to be used in the adoration of that Supreme Being, to
twhom no term is applicable; and therefore bhagavat expresses that
Supreme Spirit which is individual, almighty, and the cause of causes of
all things. . . .
