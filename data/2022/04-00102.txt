"An online?GIAN course?on the theme *?The Advaita Vedanta Tradition and 
the Possibilities for a Hindu Theology of Liberation?*is organised by 
Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, *Indian Institute of 
Technology Tirupati* (India)| April ?25- 29, 2022
The Advaita Vedanta tradition is traditionally understood as concerned 
with liberation (mok?a) and not with issues of injustice in this world. 
The latter is the concern of liberation theology. Some Advaita 
interpreters minimize the significance of the world by suggesting that 
the knowledge of brahman requires and results in the disappearance of 
the world of diversity. The world is likened to a sense-illusion that we 
conjure and experience because of our ignorance. When the reality of the 
world is denied in this manner, it is not consistent for one to be 
affected by events within it. To respond the world is to grant reality 
to the world; it is to treat as real that which does not, in reality, 
exist. Interpretations like these provide justification for 
world-renunciation rather than world-affirmation, and have been most 
strongly and clearly articulated in the many of the monastic and ascetic 
strands of the tradition. Taken to their extremes, these interpretations 
make it difficult to take the world and its issues seriously.
