Hi list members,
The sixteenth-century intellectual and poet V?dir?ja has a number of Vy?sastotras attributed to him. Most of them celebrate Vy?sa in language and with themes well-worn among Vai??ava poets both in and outside the M?dhva tradition. But his P??a??akha??anastotra, which is directed against V?ra?aivas, invokes the painted image of Vy?sa as visual proof against the cutting of Vy?sa?s arm and its procession (the practice of ?Vy?santo?" in Kannada)???ady?pi p?jyate vy?sapratim? j??nad?yin? | citrakair likhyate bhittau mantra??stre?u var?yate?. I?m familiar with popular miniatures of Vy?sa in Mah?bh?rata / Razmnama manuscripts, but I?m curious about early-modern wall paintings/frescos of Vy?sa in western Karnataka or the Deccan (or south India more broadly). He?s clear in saying that the image of Vy?sa is worshipped, but I?m not aware of any paintings of Vy?sa in M?dhva temples. I believe that the Uttaradi Mutt in Bangalore has an image of Vy?sa painted on their wall, but it?s quite modern. I?ve had a look through various collections of painted frescos at Vijayanagara, but I can?t readily discern the figure of Vy?sa in them (granted my eye is not well-trained for this kind of work). I?d be curious to know more if anyone has information/thoughts.
With thanks in advance,
