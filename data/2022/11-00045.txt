And here is my take on MIAr (a paper I read at the AOS meeting in 2006; likewise unpublished). Oddly enough, I had just today converted it to unicode fonts, and then Andrew?s interesting paper arrived. Some of this was incorporated in the 1997 UIUC dissertation of my former student, Patrick Marlow ?Origin and development of the Indo-Aryan quotatives and complementizers: An areal approach?.
All the best,
Hans Henrich

Since Matthew mentioned MIA, I suppose I can share this presentation on clausal complements in Middle Indic, which also contains some observations on the use of iti in Sanskrit (and e?- and its cognates in Dravidian languages):

Re: [INDOLOGY] iti in Sanskrit
V.S. Rajam?s book is an essential one for students of classical Tamil, covering syntax, meter, morphology, etc. What I meant is that to my knowledge no one has made a substantial study of every use of e? in Sangam literature. Such a study might include uses of iti in early Sanskrit. For example, in modern Tamil we often find ?? e???l, ?If you ask why,? which corresponds exactly to Sanskrit "kuta iti cet.? One wonders how old this usage is in both languages. George Hart

Just to kindle your memory ?
Please look into my book ?A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry, V.S. Rajam, American Philosophical Society, 1992?
Thanks and regards,

Of course, the use of this construction could be an areal phenomenon ? it is not necessarily true that its presence in early Sanskrit is due to Dravidian, though I think it is highly likely, given its richness in Dravidian languages.

I do not know if the question was about iti as an areal phenomenon. If so, see F.B.J. Kuiper, "The Genesis of a Linguistic Area", IIJ 1968, where, if I remember well, he compares Skt iti with Tamil e??u.

Onderwerp: Re: [INDOLOGY] iti in Sanskrit
If I remember correctly, the possibility of the "iti" constructions being an areal phenomena have been discussed  for many decades. The best person to provide information regarding this topic may be Hans Hock. I will see if I can locate any of these older publications.
