Dear Howard,

If you mean the original sources that would have sexual contact between the
queen and the horse,
well the original sources predate the genre of ??stra.

See the ?pastamba ?rautas?tra 20.18.4, Baudh?yana ?rautas?tra
25.29,K?ty?yana ?rautas?tra 20.6.16
V?r?ha ?rautas?tra 3.4.4.15

Older than these, however, is ?atapatha Br?hma?a 13.5.2.2

and the oldest explicit case that I know of is Taittir?ya Sa?hit? 7.4.19
which opens with
*?t sakthy?r g**?**d?m dhehi *

If, however, you mean the earliest sources that recommend the queen
*merely* lying by the head horse while omitting explicit details,
I think that might be the epics.

Best,
Caley
