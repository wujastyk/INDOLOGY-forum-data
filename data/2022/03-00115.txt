[INDOLOGY] 
Dear Bob,
I am so sorry to hear this news. Luis was a kind teacher and friend, who
always took the time to ask, with great interest, how my work was going and
to share resources that he thought would be helpful. Many years ago he even
gave me a copy of his *Tiempo C?clico y Eras del Mundo en la India. *He will
certainly be missed.
With best wishes,
Lauren
