[INDOLOGY] infinitive as the subject of a finite verb in
 Sanskrit
Dear list members,
Prof. Walter Slaje very kindly pointed at a different meaning of sa?+bh?.
With his permission, I am sharing his message:
I think it is a passive-infinitive construction, with *sa?bh?vita* taking
The improved translation would be something like: He could not even be
seen, forget about being made love to.
My question with regard to rantum as the subject of ?st?m is still open.
With best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
