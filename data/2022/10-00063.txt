I am now grateful to have the article I sought, but I would still be pleased to receive any further references you may have to the topic:
the teaching and study of Advaita-Ved?nta (or any other "orthodox" form of Ved?nta) among "scheduled castes" in modern or pre-modern times.

thanks in advance,
Matthew
