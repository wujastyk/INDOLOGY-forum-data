Dear list members,
I was asked to find gayatr? mantras to the god of healing Dhanvantari (but
with a source). I'm able to find lots of mantras (including gayatr?
mantras) on youtube and the internet but they don't give a source.
Ideally would be a gayatri mantra with a scriptural source (some ayurvedic
text?) but acceptable would be some modern book collection of mantras etc.
And even some shloka or non-gayatri mantra in a text asking for healing
from Dhanvantari would also be acceptable.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
