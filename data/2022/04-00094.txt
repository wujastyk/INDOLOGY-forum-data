The  Beautiful Tree : Indigenous Indian Education In the Eighteenth Century
by Dharampal
Dharampal (1922?2006) was a great Gandhian thinker, historian and political
philosopher from India. Convinced about the urgent need for an objective
understanding about India?s past, before the onslaught of colonial rule, he
decided to embark on an exploration of British-Indian archival material,
based on documents emanating from commissioned surveys of the East India
Company, lodged in various depositories spread over the British Isles. His
pioneering historical research, conducted intensively over a decade, led to
the publication of works that have since become classics in the field of
Indian studies. This major work entitled "The Beautiful Tree" provides
evidence from extensive early British administrators? reports of the
widespread prevalence of educational institutions in the Bengal and Madras
Presidencies as well as in the Punjab, teaching a sophisticated curriculum,
with daily school attendance by about 30% of children aged 6?15, where
those belonging to communities who were classed as Shudras or even lower
constituted a good number of students, and in some areas, for instance in
Kerala, where Muslim girls were quite well represented.
