Dear list members,

The latest issue of the peer-reviewed electronic Journal of Gandh?ran Buddhist Texts<https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/JGBT/index> has just been released, representing a fully interactive digital edition of a G?ndh?r? version of the Anavatapta-g?th?, RS14 of the Robert Senior collection of Kharo??h? manuscripts:

?RS14.01 Anavatapta-g?th? Sutra,? edited by Richard Salomon and Stephanie Majcher:
https://gandhari-texts.sydney.edu.au/edition/anavatapta-gatha/

As noted for previous articles, the framing content for this is minimal with the reader being referred to print publications for further details and analysis.

For those who have not visited the JGBT before, some of the features and resources provided by these digital editions are:

  *   ability to switch between diplomatic, reconstruction, and hybrid editions
  *   ability to easily align the edition, English translation and Sanskrit ch?y?
  *   full glossary
  *   interactive image and text with a word selected in the edition being highlighted by segments in the image
  *   ability to reveal the grammatical status, Pali and Sanskrit cognates, etc., of each word by double clicking on each word in the text
  *   palaeographic report
  *   ability to export the editions in standards-based formats (TEI, HTML, etc.)
  *   additional resources such as downloadable colour and infrared images of the manuscript or inscription, images of select reconstructed sections, and related images such as historical images and images of the manuscript in the process of being conserved
  *   reference to a companion print publication, such as a journal article or a volume in the Gandh?ran Buddhist Text (GBT) series (University of Washington Press). Companion publications may have a DOI link to this electronic publication
  *   facility for readers? comments/feedback to be added.

We invite submissions of G?ndh?r? and Sanskrit textual material (manuscripts, inscriptions, etc.) from the Greater Gandh?ran region. Guidelines for submission, with various options for authors to onboard their texts into the journal are available upon application.
