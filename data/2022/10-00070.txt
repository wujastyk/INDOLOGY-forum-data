Dear Harry,

I'm not sure if partial ethnographic information is useful here.
Nonetheless, in the lineage of *kal?arippayar?r??* I study, when a student
is initiated into *kal?aricikitsa* (which understands itself as a
specialised branch of *?yurveda*), that student is given a mantra in which
Dhanvantari features as part of the initiation. However, as it's an
*upade?a* mantra, it's not permitted to share it or write it down for
public consumption. I don't know if this is a widespread practice across
other lineages and traditions, but if so, it might explain why written
sources are so rare.

All best wishes,
