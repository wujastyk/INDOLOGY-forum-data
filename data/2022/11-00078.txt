[INDOLOGY] Seeking text
Dear Indologists,
Madeleine Biardeau bases her edition and translation of V?kyapad?ya I on the 1935 Lahore edition of Pt. Charudeva Shastri.  If anyone has a scan of this edition, I would be most grateful for it. My searches for it so far have been unsuccessful.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
