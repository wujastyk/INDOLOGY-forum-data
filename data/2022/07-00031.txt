Thank you, Patricia, that's one place I hadn't looked. The meaning 
'commander of (a subdvision of) an army', particularly the infantry, was 
also suggested privately by Walter Slaje and is almost certainly 
correct. The meaning 'army' for tantra (and 'soldier' for tantrin) is 
found in most dictionaries, but Walter tells me it is very common in the 
R?jatara?gi??s of Kalha?a, Jonar?ja, ?r?vara and ?uka, the first of 
which is roughly right for the period and geographic area that I'm 
interested in. Thanks to all who replied to my query!
Best wishes,
Martin
