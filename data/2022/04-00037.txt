[INDOLOGY] Missing page of Bharadvajavrttibhasya of Gangadhara
 Kaviratna Kaviraja
Dear Scholars,
Might someone help me get the scan of p. 2 of the Bharadvajavrttibhasya of
Gangadhara Kaviratna Kaviraja on Vaisesikasutra, which covers Sutra 2
partially and Sutra 3 entirely? The otherwise complete text of the same is
available as a PDF here:

Thanks in advance and apologies for cross-posting.
Best regards,
Sudipta Munsi
