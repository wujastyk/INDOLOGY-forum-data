Dear colleagues,

As the new director of the National Mission for Manuscripts of the IGNCA, I
would like to give you an update of the current situation. There are about
3.10 laks of manuscripts that have been digitized over the past 20 years of
which about 52 laks have been registered and labeled in the NNM portal. 16
thousand titles have been uploaded and as soon as the metadata is entered
they will be put in the public domain. Although we live in a
technologically advanced age, much of this work needs to be done by people
who are competent to read the manuscripts and process the data. Part of our
mission is to train such bright, young scholars to carry on these tasks
into the future. We also plan an international division that will work with
Indic collections of manuscripts outside India to make them available for
study and research by all scholars. I want to let you know that we are
working on all these fronts and will keep you the students and scholars
most affected up-to-date as and when new developments occur.

Yours sincerely,


Anirban Dash, PhD

DIRECTOR,  NMM, Delhi
