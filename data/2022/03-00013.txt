Hi,
Is there anywhere an index of the Upani?adic passages quoted by ?a?kar?c?rya in his major works?  Of course, he comments fully on 10 Upani?ads, but in these commentaries he makes reference to passages from other Upani?ads in passing. I?m trying to get an idea of his favorite passages, those upon which he may most rely.
Thanks for any help here.
