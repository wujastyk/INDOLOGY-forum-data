Dear Prof. Olivelle,
Thanks for your email. You are absolutely right. When I was writing my
thesis, I did think very carefully about whether I should use the terms
'left' and 'right' while talking about p?rva and para respectively.
One reason, of course, was, as you mention, that these terms only makes
sense in the written context. The other reason for my apprehension about
the accuracy / appropriateness of these terms was that, if Sanskrit were to
be written, like Persian, from right to left, then para would have meant
'left'.
So, why did I eventually decide to use the term 'right'? The thing is, I
had to make it absolutely clear that, according to me, para? k?ryam means
'the rule which is applicable to the part that is spoken / pronounced later
in time'. For example, the suffix is uttered / pronounced later than the
base. I realized I would find it difficult to use this long and somewhat
awkward phrase ('the rule which is applicable to the part that is spoken /
pronounced later in time') again and again in my thesis. And since I've
introduced so many new ideas in my thesis, I wanted to present things
diagrammatically wherever possible to help the reader understand what I am
trying to say. For all these reasons, I decided to translate para as right
hand side when translating not only (my interpretation of) 1.4.2
viprati?edhe para? k?ryam, but also in other rules such as 1.1.51 ura?
rapara? and 1.1.47 mid acho'nty?t para?.
I have not provided the above clarification in my thesis. In hindsight, I
think I definitely should have. In the future, when I write about my
doctoral research, I will most certainly do so. Thank you very much for
bringing this up.
In my recent interviews though, including the one with BBC radio yesterday,
I did explain that para? k?ryam actually means 'that rule which is
applicable to the part (to be more precise, operand) which is spoken /
pronounced later', and that I use the term right hand side purely because I
find it convenient to do so.
Best,
Rishi
