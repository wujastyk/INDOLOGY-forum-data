In contrast with Pata?jali, many modern scholars have argued that
originally the rule "viprati?edhe para? k?ryam" was intended to apply only
within the ekasa?j??dhik?ra prescribed by the previous rule "? ka??r?d ek?
sa?j??." While Rishi Popat disagrees with Pata?jali, he still seems to take
the rule as applying across the entire A???dhy?y?. Popat has an interesting
suggestion, but I am not yet convinced of his understanding of paratva. I
would like to hear from my Guru, Professor Cardona.
