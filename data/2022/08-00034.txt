But I've only heard the written  nama? ?iv?ya chanted as  nama ?iv?ya and never as namaha ?iv?ya (i.e. with the visarga pronounced).. I had always assumed that what was happening was that the written  nama? ?iv?ya was being chanted as if it was the sandhi transformed nama??iv?ya .

Well ? Tamilians pronounce it as namacciv?ya (?????????).
