What I meant was that k?yilamu, which indeed means 'temple', may have been
used for that specific temple called peddak?yilamu instead of choosing the
generic term because pedda gu?i would simply be "the old temple" but
peddak?yilamu perhaps had another ring to it. I made that assumption
because the inscription is from Agiripalli near Nuzvid which is not so
close to the Tamil or Kanna?a speaking area.
Best wishes,
Jens
