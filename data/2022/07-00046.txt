Dear P?ter,

both words seem to be attested by Indian lexicographers only. As to  
depictions: Alexandra van der Geer, "Animals in Stone. Indian Mammals  
Sculptured Through Time", Leiden 2008, p. 427, mentions that the  
stripped hyena is totally absent from stone sculpture. So, I would be  
very interested too in any descriptions or depictions of this  
conspicuous scavenger.

With best wishes
Martin
