> Can the tradition of fasting have any relation to the genders at large?
> Whenever we think of the tradition of fasting, we are reminded of Mahatma
> Gandhi, the modern master of fasting who gained attention through his 15
> odd major public fasts.
> Join Prof. Vinay Lal of the UCLA in his webinar on ?Gandhi and the gender
> of fasting?, where he discusses how Gandhi?s refusal of being bound by the
> general and rigid ethics, sociology, and philosophy surrounding the
> tradition of fasting led to radicalization and feminization of public
> sphere.
