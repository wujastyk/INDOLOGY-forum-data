Many thanks to all who answered my query so quickly, on and off the 
list! S??i being a variant of sa??? 'exchange market', s??u? 'bargain', 
etc., does indeed seem the most likely solution, and Sindhi and Gujarati 
giving the closest matches agrees with the presumed origin of the text 
in the Saurashtra area.
Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
