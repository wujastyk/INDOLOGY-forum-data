Dear Mark and other Colleagues,

Mark Allon alerted me to the fact that the contributors lists and tables of contents are not shown on the Lulu Press page for the volumes in honor of Professor Cardona as I had written in my announcement.  I?m not sure why these are not displayed but I copy what I submitted to the Press below.

Yours,
Peter
