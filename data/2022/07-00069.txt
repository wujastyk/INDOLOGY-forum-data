[INDOLOGY] A site for Indological books in German?
The many Indological books available on the web seem to mostly be in
English or Indian languages, thanks above all to the Digital Library of
India and its availability via Archive.org. There is also Gallica for books
in French. Is there a site for Indological books in German?
I have had no luck in finding Konrad Meisig's 1988 book, Das S?tra von den
vier St?nden: das Agga??a-Sutta im Licht seiner chinesischen Parallelen,
nor Adelheid Mette's 1973 booklet, *Indische Kulturstiftungsberichte und
ihr Verh?ltnis zur Zeitaltersage*. I would be happy to buy these books if
reasonably possible. I found A. Mette's book at AbeBooks for $32.46. OK,
but then shipping from Germany to U.S.A. for this 35-page booklet is $45.75!
Am I missing some digital site that has Indological books in German?
