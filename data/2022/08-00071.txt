Harvard Oriental Series is pleased to announce some new volumes:

HOS 98, Fran?ois Voegeli, Vadhula Srautasutra ch. V

The Fifth Prap??haka of the V?dh?la ?rautas?tra: Introduction to the Edition, Translation, and Commentary<https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674275560>
Voegeli, Fran?ois
The Fifth Prap??haka of the V?dh?la ?rautas?tra includes a critical edition, followed by a translation and a commentary, of the fifth chapter (prap??haka) of the V?dh?la ?rautas?tra. This chapter is dedicated to the description of the so-called ?independent? animal sacrifice (nir??hapa?ubandha) in Vedic ritual.

HOS 54, The long delayed 2nd part of V. Raghavan, Srangaraprakasa, that we could print after receiving additional materials from the Raghavan family.
???g?raprak??a of Bhoja, Part <https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674833401> 2
Raghavan, Venkatarama
This edition is based on new manuscripts of this important treatise on classical Sanskrit poetics by the famous eleventh-century King Bhoja of Malwa. The text is important because of the theoretical treatment of the erotic sentiment (srngara) in classical Sanskrit texts, and also as a mine of quotations from Sanskrit and Prakrit poetical texts.
Also recently published:

HOS 90:
Lokaprak??a by K?emendra with the commentary of Sahaja Bha??a, Volume 2: Additional Manuscripts and Early Studies<https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674984363>
K?emendra
ed. Witzel, Michael
Long lost, the manuscript of this significant text has been recovered in the Soci?t? Asiatique in Paris and is now published here. Lokaprak??a by Ks?emendra with the Commentary of Sahaja Bha??a fills a large gap in our knowledge of private life and public administration in medieval India.


HOS 96:
Utpaladeva on the Power of Action: A First Edition, Annotated Translation and Study of ??varapratyabhij??viv?ti, Chapter 2.1<https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674270817>
Rati?, Isabelle
Utpaladeva on the Power of Action provides the first critical edition, annotated translation, and study of one of the chapters of the Recognition of the Lord, a landmark in the history of nondual ?aivism by Utpaladeva, that were recently recovered from marginal annotations in manuscripts of other commentaries on Utpaladeva?s treatise.
HOS 97
An Indian Theory of Defeasible Reasoning: The Doctrine of up?dhi in the Up?dhidarpa?a<https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674273412>
Guhe, Eberhard
The pre-Ga?ge?a Navya-Ny?ya treatise Up?dhidarpa?a (UD) deals with the up?dhi, a key concept in the Navya-Ny?ya theory of inference. This volume is the first published edition and translation of the only manuscript of the UD. Notes have been added to elucidate the historical context of the authors, works, and philosophical doctrines in the UD.
Vol. 100 is to be released soon:  The coronation manual of King Birendra of Nepal (1975)

All the best,
Michael Witzel
