Dear Asko,

 

Thank you for your comments. 

 

A twelfth-century inscription in the Tiruvi?aimarut?r temple (Nagaswamy (2012, pp. 373?74)) discusses an order by C??a Kulottu?ga II41 to appoint a P??a? to sing before the deity, appoint other P??ar, and train two classes of temple women to sing. In Nagaswamy?s Mirror of Tamil and Sanskrit 

 

 

?A new service was started in the temple of Thiruvidaimarud?r creating an enactment for singing the Thirup-padiayams [sic] and also arranging for the dancing girls of the temple to sing in the 9th year of Vikramachola, the son of Kulottunga II. The service was called ?B?nap-peru? (B?nap-pani). This was a royal appointment issued by Vikkramachola [sic] and a certain Irumudi Cholan alias Acancala Peraraiayan [sic] was appointed to do the service...The record states that he was to sing in the presence of God of the Thiruvidaimarud?r temple and direct other B?nas for arranging the Dancing girls to sing (Thiruvidai marudur?udaiy?rukku?p?davum, ikkoyil Taliyil?rai p?duvikkavum ikkoyil Devaradiy?rai p?duvikkavum B?napper?ka). The B?nas were great singers from the Sangam age and we find the B?nas, Y?lp?na was a close friend of Jn?na-sambandar and again we find the B?nas were appointed in the Great temple of Thanjavaur [sic]. According to this inscription the service should be added to the temple service and the B?na should be paid one kalam of paddy per day to the Perariayan [sic] for singing. He should be allotted one residence as B?nak-kudiyiruppuas before?

 

Venkatesan says, 

?The territorial division viz., P????u, is in all probability, the same as B????u i.e., the n??u of the B??as. (emphasis mine) The B??as were an ancient line of kings, who also ruled a portion of the Tamil country. This is the earliest so far known inscription, which mentions their territorial division as P????u. The names V??ag?pp?di-n??u and Perumb??app?di, etc., are employed in the Tamil inscriptions of the latter period to indicate the territory of the B??as.

The Sanskrit word meant by Nagaswamy should be (instead of b??a- ?arrow?) v???- ?sound, voice, music?, attested since the Rigveda, but according to Mayrhofer without a good etymology. A look at DEDR 4068 suggests that Tamil p?? ?song, melody? etc have a good Dravidian etymology, which could explain Sanskrit v??a.

 

Best wishes,  Asko Parpola

Dear Indologists,

 

Recently I came across this interview of late Dr. R. Nagaswamy by Prof. Bharat Gupt. At timepoint 10:16, I was surprised to hear Nagaswamy?s understanding of the word for the Tamil bard as ?b??a? instead of ?p??a?? (DEDR 4068) and his claim of Sanskritic derivation for that word.

I would like to know if any other scholar has offered this etymology. 

 

Thank you in advance

Palaniappan
