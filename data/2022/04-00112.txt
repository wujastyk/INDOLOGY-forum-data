?Dear List members,
I am looking for an edition of Kali?kar's commentary on the Tirukku?al? (Thiruvenkatavan University or T.P. Palaniappan Pillai). If not of Kali?kar, then of any other traditional commentator other than Parim?la?akar. I hope someone on the list can help me with a pdf or else with information where the edition can be had on short notice.
With kind regards, Herman
