  *   The calendar has been produced under the auspices of the newly inaugurated Centre of Excellence for Indian Knowledge Systems at IIT Kharagpur, headed by Prof. Joy Sen.

  *   Even though this calendar has thrust IIT Kharagpur into the news, the so-called ?Indian Knowledge Systems? already have a home in IIT Gandhinagar, and IIT Kanpur may be next in line.
