[INDOLOGY] Velankar's Prosodial Practice of Sanskrit Poets
Dear all,
Does anyone happen to have a pdf of Prosodial Practice of Sanskrit Poets by
Velankar? I've attempted to get it from
https://southasiacommons.net/artifacts/2361293/journal-of-the-bombay-branch-of-the-royal-asiatic-society-new-series-1948-1949/3369940/
but have not succeeded.
Thanks in advance.
All the Best,
Victor
