Dear friends,
Might someone have access to a soft copy of:
Muktivadavicarah of Sri Harirama Tarkavagisa / with the commentary Muktilaksmi by Mahamahopadhyaya Kalipada Tarkacarya ; edited by Jagadish Chandra Bhattascharya Tarkatirtha (Calcutta : Sanskrit College, 1959 ) xvi, 98 p. ; 25 cm.
I have of course tried archive.org and other sources of which I am aware, but have not yet located it.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
