I'm not sure if this helps... but according to page 1118 column b of
the Catalogue of Copyright Entries: Pamphlets, leaflets. Volume 17, Issue 2
(1920) the full name of the author is William Louis Richard.

The copy of this pamphlet held at the New York Public Library belongs to
the Pforzheimer Collection.

Kind regards,
Antonio
