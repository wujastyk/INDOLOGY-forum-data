Dear Valerie,

I don?t have anything to say at the moment about the yantra, but I expect the son either meant to write tat tvam asi ?you are that' but wrote instead tat tvam ?sa ?you were that?, or he deliberately wrote tat tvam ?sa. In this familiar saying tat tvam asi (Ch?ndogya Upani?at 6.8.7), tat means sat or brahman.

Would anyone be able to shed more light on this as a particular (basic indication of a) yantra and/or on the particular (mainly n?gar?) characters which do not seem to make sense as a word/words - could they be (an attempt to indicate) specific individual seed mantras? or?  If anyone has any further ideas, and how to convey them sensitively to the family, please reply to the list and/or to Jackie direct (jacqueline.hirst at manchester.ac.uk <mailto:jacqueline.hirst at manchester.ac.uk> - Honorary Research Fellow South Asian Studies).  With many thanks.'
