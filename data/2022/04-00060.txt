[INDOLOGY] Tattoo design
Dear Valerie,
I don?t have anything to say at the moment about the yantra, but I expect the son either meant to write tat tvam asi ?you are that' but wrote instead tat tvam ?sa ?you were that?, or he deliberately wrote tat tvam ?sa. In this familiar saying tat tvam asi (Ch?ndogya Upani?at 6.8.7), tat means sat or brahman.
