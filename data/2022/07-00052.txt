Dear colleagues,
I don't suppose anyone has a pdf of G. Dum?zil's 1929 book
*Le Probl?me des Centaures. ?tude de mythologie compar?e Indo-Europ?ene*
that they're willing to share?
Many of his books are available on archive.org, but not this one it seems.
I'd be very grateful if anyone can help.
Many thanks!
Robert
