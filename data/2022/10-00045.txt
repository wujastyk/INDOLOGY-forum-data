Dear colleagues,

I am happy to announce the publication of my book "The Philosophy of the Brahma-sutra: An Introduction," from Bloomsbury, as part of their Bloomsbury Introductions to World Philosophies series --

https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/philosophy-of-the-brahmasutra-9781350150003/

While it is written primarily for student audience and courses on Indian philosophy, Upanishads, and the like, I am hopefully that the experts too will find some fresh insights.

I don't have a discount code to share, as the book is relatively cheap (about 20 $/? for the softbound, 10 $/? for the e-book), and it should be readily available from regional Amazon and other sites.

Yours,
Aleksandar
