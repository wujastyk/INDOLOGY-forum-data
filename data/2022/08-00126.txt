Subject: [INDOLOGY] Navagraha miniatures
Message-ID: <d74efcb9-c61e-9b65-406c-b22924d60705@gmail.com>

Sonja Brentjes, who is working on the history of astral iconography but 
is not a member of this list, sent me this question, which I am passing 
on with her permission:

> Do you know perhaps miniatures of the Navagrahas and can you recommend 
> me online collections or good publications? We have found a few from 
> the 18th century, but nothing before. 

If anyone should know of such collections or publications, please reply 
to me and/or the list, and I'll pass the information on.

Many thanks in advance,

Martin Gansten
