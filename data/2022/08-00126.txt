[INDOLOGY] Navagraha miniatures
Sonja Brentjes, who is working on the history of astral iconography but 
is not a member of this list, sent me this question, which I am passing 
on with her permission:
If anyone should know of such collections or publications, please reply 
to me and/or the list, and I'll pass the information on.
Many thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
