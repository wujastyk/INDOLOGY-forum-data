Dear All

Posting on behalf of another scholar. Apologies for any cross-posting:

------
I am writing to ask if you would please share this announcement for a paid summer internship with any Sanskrit students (undergrad, graduate, or post-doc enrolled in an academic program) who might be interested:

The intern would work closely with me to gather transliterations and translations into English of the text on pages of Southern Asian manuscripts in the collection, in order to prepare the works for complete presentation online.

I would very much appreciate your assistance in circulating awareness of this opportunity, since it is only advertised on the museum?s website.

With all best wishes and many thanks,
Sonya
