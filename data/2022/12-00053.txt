I wrote a response but apparently sent it only to Dominik. Here it is:
Thank you, Dominik. I am no P??inian, and it is good to know that this is a series work and advances scholarship. I was curious, however, about the use of ?left? and ?right? in the write-up on websites. These terms make sense only within a manuscript culture. Would the translations have to be ?prior? and ?posterior? or some terms to that effect, if we are dealing with orality?

Madhav, Rajpopat discusses this point and explicitly defends his view in paras 1.6 and 1.7.

In contrast with Pata?jali, many modern scholars have argued that originally the rule "viprati?edhe para? k?ryam" was intended to apply only within the ekasa?j??dhik?ra prescribed by the previous rule "? ka??r?d ek? sa?j??." While Rishi Popat disagrees with Pata?jali, he still seems to take the rule as applying across the entire A???dhy?y?. Popat has an interesting suggestion, but I am not yet convinced of his understanding of paratva. I would like to hear from my Guru, Professor Cardona.

Thanks for sharing this. A great example of close reading, if true. I was most intrigued by Prof. Vergiani's statement:
"Mr Rajpopat said he had a ?eureka moment? after his supervisor at Cambridge, Professor of Sanskrit Vincenzo Vergiani, advised him: ?If the solution is complicated, you are probably wrong.?"
All best,
Arash
