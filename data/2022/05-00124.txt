[INDOLOGY] Meaning of "jagatiparvati" as a man made structure
Dear list members,
I was asked this question:
I came across the word ?jagatiparvata? in the Mahabharata. It appears in a
description of gardens around the city of Indraprastha. The context
indicates that it probably refers to some man made structure. I am trying
to figure out what kind of structure it may be referring to. No luck so
far. Would you know any expert on iconography or architecture who might be
familiar with the ancient architectural design and/or terms ?  If so, could
you please make an inquiry for me?
Any ideas?
