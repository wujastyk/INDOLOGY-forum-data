Thank you for taking an interest in this, Madhav. Yes, there are several 
instances of both characters. Here is another one of ??? :
And here is one of ? :
It is, of course, entirely possible that someone at some point misread 
pr?ghu?ika as pr?dyu?ika (though it would have to have been someone 
ignorant of the former word, like myself) and that the mistake was then 
copied. The problem is, as I said before, that 'guest' doesn't really 
fit the context anyway.
Because the Sanskrit text is a very condensed rendering of the Arabic 
original, it is possible that the mystery word should not mean 
'frequent' after all, but rather the next thing discussed, which would 
be someone dear or connected to the querent. But I can't see pr?ghu?ika 
fitting that sense either, at least not from its etymology. Some printed 
editions that quote this verse give the word in question as pr?ya?ika, 
but I'm not sure that helps (although I see that pr?ya- can have the 
sense 'common, ordinary'), and is does look suspiciously like a lectio 
simplicior, or at least like a corruption.
Best wishes,
Martin
