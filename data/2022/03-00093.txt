Subject: [INDOLOGY] Misprint in Vedic Sanskrit text or something else?
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o8p6jfo7gt3W8QE5rS15E=kQLZ5TBNH1-PmCCScgzvNDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I've been looking at the ?r?-s?ktam text in Scheftelowitz's  Apokryphen des
Rgveda.
 In his text of the hymn  in verse 12 there is the phrase: ... cikl?t? vasa
me g?he
but in verse 16 a few verses on, the same phrase is spelled:  cikl?ta vasa
me g?he
(See attached pdf page.)

I've checked the other online  ?g-veda khil?ni but they are all derived
from Scheftelowitz and agree with his spelling of these two verses.
Scheftelowtiz in his study on the ?r?s?kta translates the phrase the same
in both verses.
Verse 12  Cikl?ta ("Schlamm"), wohne in meinem Geh?fte
Verse 16  Cikl?ta wohne in meinem Geh?fte

Is the spelling  cikl?t? in verse 12 a misprint in Scheftelowitz's text or
is  do the  two different spellings represent how it actually is in the ?g-veda
khil?ni

Thanks,
Harry Spier
