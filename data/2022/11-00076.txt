In the Vedic soma rite connected with sorcery called ?yena ?falcon' and described in L??y?yana-?rautas?tra 8,5, the officiating priests wear red turbans and are dressed in red clothes. This and related rites of sorcery belong to the archaic vr?tya tradition of the Atharvaveda and S?maveda. Cf. my book ?The Roots of Hinduism? (2015), chapter 12, and p. 134. 

With best wishes, Asko Parpola
