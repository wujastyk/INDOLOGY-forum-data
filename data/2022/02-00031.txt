The Tamil phrase in question is m? ?? tu?ai, where tu?ai means ?area of knowledge?. A comparable usage is ?tu?ai pala mu??iya pai t?r p??aro?u? (Malaipa?uka??m 40), where ?tu?ai? is an area of knowledge of the bards. In fact, Pu?an????u 152.20 has ?m? ?? tu?aiyum mu?aiyu?ik ka?ippi?, where the bards performed music encompassing 21(three times seven) areas/aspects. Here the commentator?s interpretation is that the bards were knowledgeable in the use of 7 notes in 3 octaves. The phrase could have referred to 21 different areas of knowledge (?) involved in making music. Similarly, in Pu?an????u 166, the number 21 could refer to different areas of knowledge required of brahmins just like the number 6 usually referring to Ved??gas. Auvai Turaic?mi also mentions 21 areas of logic as a possible meaning. Are there other conventional areas of knowledge numbered as 21? Or did the number 21 simply mean a conventional way of saying ?many??

 

Thanks

Dear Tim, I made a mistake, the number is indeed 21, as you suggested. So I now have the information I need. Thank you very much.

Dear Herman,

 

If the number is 21 rather than 22 (as the passage you quote indicates), it may refer to the 7 somayaj?as + 7 haviryaj?as (i??i rites) + 7 p?kayaj?as, a comprehensive rubrication of Vedic ritual laid out in the Karm?ntas?tra appended to the Baudh?yana ?rautas?tra (24.4).  Baudh?yana G?hyas?tra 1.1.1?12 describes the seven p?kayaj?as as:

huta: ?when [the offering] is made in the fire? (yad dh?yate)

prahuta: ?when, after a fire-offering, something is given? (yad dhutv? d?yate)

?huta: ?when, after a fire-offering and a gift, something is received? (yad dhutv? dattv? c?d?yate)

??lagava: ?when they skewer pieces of cow-meat on spits and cook them? (yac ch?le??panik?ya[1] gavy?ni ?rapayanti)

balihara?a: ?when they scatter food for the gods of the household? (yad g?hy?bhyo devat?bhyo ?nna? sa?prakiranti)

pratyavaroha?a: ?when they adopt the low bed from season to season? (yad ?to ?tu? pratyavarohanti) 

a??ak?homa: ?when food is prepared during the ek???aka rite? (yad ek???ak?y?m anna? kriyate)[2]

 

The classification into seven here reflects a desire for symmetry with the two types of ?rauta rites to yield three 7-member lists ? p?kayaj?a, haviryaj?a, somayaj?a ? as stated in BGParibh??as?tra 1.6.22.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] 22 sacrifices

 

Dear List members,

In Pu?an????u 166 a brahmin is described who had "performed to perfection all twenty-one kinds of sacrifices" (trsl. Hart and Heifetz). I am at a loss which 22 sacrifices are referred to here; that is to say, I do not know where to look. I hope someone has a suggestion.

With kind regards, Herman
