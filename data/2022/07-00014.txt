Dear Colleagues,
Indeed, Dr. Silk, your note of caution is wise and well-taken. Despite my
momentary Stendhal syndrome, I certainly could have qualified my statement
more carefully--though only the part identifying the image as the Buddha,
certainly not the "beautiful" part! That said, in my haste I failed to
mention that there is a fair bit more evidence to support the Buddha
identification than what is covered in Dr. Sidebotham's earlier lecture.
Dr. Shailendra covers most of this evidence in the lecture linked above.
For instance, several other representations of the Buddha (a pair of Buddha
heads and another headless statue) were discovered at the same site. Dr.
Shailendra theorizes that they are locally-made votives commissioned by
South Asian merchants.
Nonetheless, "more than a small amount of caution" is always advisable
under such circumstances. Thank you again for that reminder.
For anyone who is interested (or who has trouble accessing the recorded
lecture), I've copy-pasted the abstract of Dr. Shailendra's lecture
(including brief mention of the Buddha representations) below:
