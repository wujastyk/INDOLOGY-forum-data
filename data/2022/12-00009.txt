About the Symposium
The Annual Allchin Symposium on South Asian Archaeology was established to commemorate the work of Raymond and Bridget Allchin, and the outstanding contribution that they made to development of South Asian studies in the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom is currently home to the largest community of scholars working on South Asia outside of South Asia itself. Yet, until recently, there has been no regular forum to meet, exchange ideas and share research. The Annual Allchin Symposium provides an opportunity to bring together UK-based scholars working in South Asian Archaeology, and also those researching South Asian History and the History of Art and Architecture, including established lecturers as well as post-doctoral researchers and PhD students. It creates a much-needed forum for the presentation and discussion of current research as well as methodological and theoretical concerns that affect research in South Asia. Discussions will strengthen existing research, foster new ideas and promote synergies between different areas, periods and subjects of study. This symposium creates the opportunity to bring together scholars and students as a community that can explore the full range of the many and varied needs and questions relevant to the study of ancient South Asia.
Traditionally the event has been relatively informal with the aim of providing a welcoming atmosphere where new, developing, and more senior researchers can present research that is at various stages of completion and interact with scholars that have a range of specialities under the broad banner of South Asian Archaeology, History and the History of Art and Architecture. We limit the number of speakers to ensure that we are able to highlight the broad range of possible topics, and speakers are given 20 minutes to present, and then there is time for questions. There are also opportunities for broader discussion by attendees.
