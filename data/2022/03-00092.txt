[INDOLOGY] YogVashishthaSara
There are quite a number of abridged versions, marked "s?ra" or "sa?graha".
If one adds the many versions in varying selections from the source text,
markedly differing in volume, that exist in unedited manuscripts, their
number becomes almost unmanageable. There is as yet no definitive and
authoritative overview of all of the existing abbreviations, since on
occasion also individual versions in singular manuscripts come to light.
Some of them are commented (like that of Mah?dhara, written in 1597),
others uncommented, most in Sanskrit, some in the vernacular languages
(like the one of Kavindr?c?rya Sarasvat? [17th century], the
Bh???-Yogav?si??has?ra).
An anonymous compilation called (Yoga-)V?si??has?ra in about 200 stanzas
was edited and translated by Peter Thomi. 2 vols. Wichtrach 1999.
