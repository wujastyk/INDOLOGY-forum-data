Oh dear, you're absolutely right, Madhav -- but with regard to the 
Hal?yudhako?a (which I saw in a poor-quality PDF of a printed edition 
and obviously misread) rather than to the manuscripts in question. I 
have two for this particular verse; here is the one with the more 
legible handwriting:
This matches the way the scribe writes ??? in other places as well. 
Thanks for setting me straight, although that means I'm back to square 
one: the text almost certainly does mean to say pr?dyu?ika (or -aka), 
but what does it mean? 'Guest' doesn't really fit anyway; from the 
context as well as the Arabic original, it should relate to something 
everyday or frequently recurring, to contrast with 'special occasions' 
like weddings (and, in the Arabic, circumcisions).
Best wishes,
Martin
