Dear list members,
Hallo, I am new on the Indology list.
The book by Gonda is his Change and continuity in Indian religion, with an article ?The number sixteen.? As I remember well he also discusses other numbers.
Kind regards,
Dory Heilijgers

Re: [INDOLOGY] Auspicious numbers in Hinduism
I am surprised not yet to see reference to Otto Stein, 'The Numeral 18', (The Poona Orientalist 1, 1936, pp. 1-37; 2, 1937, pp. 164-165. it is reprinted in the Kleine Schriften. 
Freidrich Wilhelm said of the papers:? 
In The Poona Orientalist I and II ( 1936 and 37) Stein published two articles on the numeral 18. They are valuable contributions to Indian number mysticism which is traceable since Vedic times. Even the reader who is aware of the specific meaningfulness of Indian numbers will be astounded how many references Stein was able to collect, and will feel inspired to look for more material on this and other numerals.
Stein was one of the all too many scholars brutally murdered by the Nazis, in his case along with his wife in Spring 1942 in Lodz.

I like to think of 108 as mathematically auspicious:
108=(1^1)*(2^2)*(3^3)!

Dear Harry,?
I do not know about the auspiciousness of 108. However, the 8 in 108 does have a special meaning as it does in 18 (books of the Mah?bh?rata). Following upon 7, which makes a finite, closed list (seventh heaven, seven generations? in some inscriptions), 8 opens it again (with it the speaker/writer indicates that he could easily go on adding to the list). Thus, 8 rasas? ("On the Use of Rasa in Studies of Sanskrit Drama, IIJ 43 (2000), pp. 115-138) and in some Gupta inscriptions the kings are praised in 8 stanzas ("Some Literary Embellishments in the Gupta Inscriptions". ArOr 74/4 (2006), pp. 451-460.
I vaguely remember that Jan Gonda has written about numbers, but am unable to provide a reference.
Kind regards, Herman

Harry, 
Thomas McEvilley in his book, The Shape of?Ancient Thought?discusses a theory of how a number of the Indian auspicious numbers (including 108) might have been ?derived from Sumerian ?Processional arithmetic.? This is in Chapter 3, I think. Especially beginning on p. 293.?
