[INDOLOGY] Script ID
Dear friends,
A student of mine sent me some pictures of a palm leaf manuscript they were
gifted asking me if it is real and if so what the script is. It is
certainly real, but I am not an expert in Southern scripts and figure
someone here can give me the answer fairly immediately. It is said to be
the Ram?yana.
With my best wishes,
