[INDOLOGY] R. Nagaswamy on the Tamil word for bard
 <1CE5A528-B5FF-443F-9DB4-45F48EF7D52A@aol.com>
The Sanskrit word meant by Nagaswamy should be (instead of b??a- ?arrow?) v???- ?sound, voice, music?, attested since the Rigveda, but according to Mayrhofer without a good etymology. A look at DEDR 4068 suggests that Tamil p?? ?song, melody? etc have a good Dravidian etymology, which could explain Sanskrit v??a.
