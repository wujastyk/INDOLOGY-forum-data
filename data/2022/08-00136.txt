Dear Dr. Tieken,
The first volume of the "Newari version" of the N??ya??stra was published
in 2015. Here
https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/natyasastra-of-muni-bharata-critical-edition-vol-i-nba075/
one can also give a look to the foreword, introduction and ToC.
I can't find mention of further volumes. The IGNCA website might be the
right place to search.
Best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
