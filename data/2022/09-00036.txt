This lecture will provide a historical overview of the development of Pali cosmological literature. After a brief outline of the canonical and commentarial conceptions of the world or loka, the talk focuses mainly on the emergence in the second millennium of cosmology as an independent genre of monastic writing, particularly in Southeast Asia. The talk will provide the first complete bibliographical description of all known Pali works about the loka and will offer an evaluation of the various subdivisions of this textual genre. In addition, the lecture will explore some of the intellectual contours of the genre?s history by paying particular attention to the changing schemas or models scholar monks used to think about and analyze the cosmos.
All are welcome
