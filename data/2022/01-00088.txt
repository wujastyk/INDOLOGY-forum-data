Dear List Members,

A very happy New Year. I hope this finds you well.

I write to inquire if anyone on this list may know about the production of
digital editions of Sanskrit texts. There has been some exciting work with
this
 Biblical Studies, and I am eager to see if the latest advances in digital
humanities can be used profitably for a research project.

Apart from designing such a digital edition, I am interested in learning
about manuscript transcription tools using artificial intelligence such as
Transkribus, digital collation tools, such as Collate-X, and digital tools
for stemmatic analysis such as Stemmaweb.

If you have been involved, or know someone who is involved, in Indological
research projects creating such editions, and are aware of all these
issues, I would be extremely grateful for your help and advice (especially
about costs involved and personnel). Please do contact me at
bihani.sarkar at orinst.ox.ac.uk

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
