Dear members of the community, I'm posting this for a friend. If anyone can
help with the texts, please let her know at hagar.shalev at mail.huji.ac.il.

Dear members of Indology,
I am trying to get hold of two early modern yogic texts:
Up?san?s?rasa?graha (16th c.) and R?jatarala (late 18th c.), a commentary
on the Yogat?r?val?. I am interested in both mss and e-texts - whatever is
available.
Thank you all!
Sivan.
