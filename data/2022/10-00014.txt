Dear colleagues:
I am curious if any member of the list might help me in tracking down what is proving to be the rather elusive _Carpa?a?ataka_  or _Charpa?a Ma?jaryaparapary?ya_  
This is a collection of verses similar to the famed Carpa?apa?jarik? attributed to ?a?kara (bhaja govindam?) but within the Nath Sampradaya.I have only the following details pulled from a website (https://sites.google.com/site/nathasiddhas/charpat-nath):
- Carpa?a Ma?jaryaparapary?ya, Yogi Narhari Nath, ed. 1953. 
- Carpa?a?atakam, Kashi, Gorakh Tilla, Akhil Bharat Varshiya Yoga Pracharini Mahasabha 
(Sri Charpat Satkam, editing by Bhamboolnath Yogi, 1969, Hardwar, Bhesh Barah Panth Dalicha)
Any leads (or PDFs?) would be sincerely appreciated, as a number of these are embedded in ?ivad?sa's Vet?lapa?cavi??ati. I haven?t been able to have any luck in archive.org or even worldcat. 
Many thanks in advance! 
with all best wishes,
Adheesh
