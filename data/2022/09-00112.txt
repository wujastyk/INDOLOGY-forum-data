In Bhasa's plays, Bhagavan is used as an addressing to Rishis and such
venerated ones. In such contexts, 'respected', , 'venerated' can be a good
choice from English.

In the famous verse used during the tying of mangala suutra, particularly
in south Indian marriages,

???? ??????? ????? is found. ???? is the adjective qualifying ??? here. The
meaning of  ????  here is 'with auspicious features'

In Visishtaadvaita Bhagavaan is defined as sakalakalyaaNaguNaghana =
aggregate of all the auspicious qualities that are possible /existing.

The matub suffix vaan  added to bhaga means , the one with. Thus bhaga here
is being taken as all the auspicious qualities that are possible /existing.

bhaga = auspicious qualities seems to be the running thread in all these
usages.

Hence bhagavaan/ bhagavatee probably can be translated as the
auspicious one in general contexts , as the  most auspicious , all
auspicious, absolutely auspicious etc., when used as qualifying the name of
a 'supreme'/ 'highest' /'ultimate' devataa.
