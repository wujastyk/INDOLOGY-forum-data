Dear Bob and colleagues: 
This is indeed shocking and deeply saddening news. Luis had, for those of us who followed him on as your students at Berkeley, been a generous, inspiring, and unflaggingly encouraging older brother to lean on, learn from, debate with, and look up to, and who handled with seeming ease and grace the various challenges that life would bring. 
I was very much looking forward to seeing him again soon, after many years. But now I may only cling to the memories of our time shared together in your sa?nidhi. 
Thank you for writing such a thoughtful and detailed conspectus of his many endeavours and accomplishments, over and above those that we all know of in the domain of Indology. 
My sincere condolences to his family, and to you and Sally, as well as all of his colleagues in the department. 
with all best wishes,
?
