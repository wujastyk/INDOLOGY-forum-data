Thanks for the link, Aleksandar.
For context, the problem with the census enumeration begins in the rules.
The epistemological and ethical issues of enumeration in the Indian census
go back to its first iteration in 1872. People eventually became able to
provide up to 3 languages and the census enumerator is not allowed to
investigate or challenge these claims. They can inform their supervisor if
they think something is fishy.
People can literally say anything.
The 2021 census was apparently fully digitized, though I'm not sure of its
extent. Now, the enumerator is bypassed as people are able to fill out the
census themselves.
The 1941 census was totally botched, partly due to changes to enumeration,
which included people having the ability to self-select and the inclusion
of a new format. These are the reasons why the 1941 census data for
Sanskrit is not available.
Ultimately, it seems better to not think of the Sanskrit tokens as relating
1:1 with "Sanskrit speakers", but, rather, with "people who identify as
speakers of Sanskrit".
All the best,
