Respected Colleague,

My recent article on the "Historiography of the Kerala School of Astronomy
and Mathematics 1820-2021: Some Highlights" has appeared in the January
2022 special issue of Bhavana  devoted to the History of mathematics in
India:

https://bhavana.org.in/emergence-of-a-new-era-in-the-history-of-indian-mathematics/

I shall be much obliged to receive any comments and response from you.

With best regards

M D Srinivas
