We do so in order that it can be available for others to consult even in its present, unfinished state. It can be accessed at the same location <http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8df9647a-8002-45ff-b37e-7effb669768b> or you can find it via the Bodleian Libraries website, under ORA, by looking for either our surname or its title, "Development and spread of the R?ma narrative (pre-modern)".

New Beginnings: an overall survey of the effects on the traditional portrayal of the VRm?s heroes and villains when varied supplementary elements now mostly collected into the CE B?la and Uttara k???as were added to the core text, classified as Stage 3 (JLB 1985).? The two books are themselves far from unitary; their diverse nature sheds light on the development, not only of Stage 3 itself (including the occasional transformation of the human R?ma into an avat?ra of Vi??u), but also of a few puzzling episodes in the so-called ?core? books.? Six chapters are planned, with the first three now complete:

> 2: The core narrative: evidence from three summaries and from the R?mop?khy?na for its contents and segmentation
> 3: The role of boons
> 4: [planned] Establishment of a R?ghava dynasty
> 5: [large part composed] Agastya?s post-victory narrative, 7,1?34
> 6: [largely incomplete, focusing only on the Ahaly? and Hanum?n episodes] Change of genre and divinisation of the heroes
