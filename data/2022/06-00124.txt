three printed versions. From now on, everyone can easily develop their own
informed opinion on these points as well as on the question of origin and
interdependencies.
Although the last and thus third volume of the text edition of the
*Nirv??aprakara?a* of the *Mok?op?ya* (6.253-374 & *Khila*s) is still in
progress, its numbering has already been finalized, which made the
publication of the present concordance at this very time reasonable. The
final volume that will complete the *Mok?op?ya* edition is expected to be
published in 2023.
