With many thanks again for all references to the use of gourds, I wonder 
if anyone has come across the word pr?dyu?aka or pr?dyu?ika (with or 
without the retroflexion, which looks a little odd), occurring in the 
same text. Apparently it translates the Arabic yan?bu 'return/occur 
again and again', so it would seem to be derived from pradyu/pradiv (as 
in pradivas, -divi 'always, at all times'), but I have never seen this 
adjective form before, nor been able to locate it in any dictionary. The 
text does employ vernacular words occasionally, but there is nothing 
similar to it in Turner either.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
