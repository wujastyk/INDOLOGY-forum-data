Dear List members,

I am looking for the following book:

R. Krishnamurthy, Sangam Age Tamil Coins.

Our library does not seem to have it. I have tried to find if copies (first or secondhand) are still available. The only copy, a new one, I could trace was available with Falcon Coins Gallery in Bangalore. I emailed them, but the mail was returned; the address does not seem to exist. Does anyone know where else I could buy the book.

With kind regards
Herman .
