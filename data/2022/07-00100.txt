Quotes like ???? ?? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????????????????? indicate words like ???????? and  ?????????????????? as words close in meaning to conscience in classical works.
In most contemporary Indian languages, Sanskrit borrowings like ???????? , ????????(???) is used in this sense.
In Tamil, the word manassaaklshin is found used, which can be guessed to have some Sanskrit source.
