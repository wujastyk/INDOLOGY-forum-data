Westin,
   The reason the microfilm could not be found at UVa is because no one there has catalogued them, and they are being treating as a single ?collection.?  If you wanted to go there and go through the set of microfilms (which are roughly labelled), you could probably find it yourself.
Best,
Paul Hackett
