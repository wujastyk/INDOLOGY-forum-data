Westin,

   The reason the microfilm could not be found at UVa is because no one there has catalogued them, and they are being treating as a single ?collection.?  If you wanted to go there and go through the set of microfilms (which are roughly labelled), you could probably find it yourself.

Best,

Paul Hackett

The librarian at Stony Brook said the IASWR collection was donated to the Woo Ju Memorial Library in the early 1990s. In turn, the representative of the Woo Ju library said that they transferred the IASWR collection to UVA in 2006. However, the librarian at UVA came up empty handed.
