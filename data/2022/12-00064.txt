Dear Prof Wujastyk,
Thank you very much for reading my work and for your kind words.
Dear members of Indology list,
Since Prof. Deshpande has brought up paratva, let me say a couple of
things.
Firstly, I understand that some of you might not be well versed with the
technicalities of P??inian derivations which might make it difficult for
you to read the more technical parts of my thesis. But I offer not only
'derivational' but also 'philological' evidence in support of my
interpretation of 1.4.2. As philologists, you might enjoy undertaking the
following exercise: look up all the instances of the use of the term para
in the A???dhy?y?.
Here are some relevant excerpts from my thesis (pg. 35 onwards):
*2.3 Evidence for My Interpretation of Para*
Before going further, let me provide more evidence to support my
interpretation of *para*. The meaning of *para* in 1.4.2 can be confirmed
by looking at the meaning of *para* in the rest of the *A???dhy?y?*. The
term *para* has been used by P??ini on many occasions. Its occurrences can
be classified into two groups:
Group A: 1.1.34, 1.4.109, 3.2.39, 3.3.138, 3.4.20, 4.3.5, 5.2.92, 5.3.29,
6.3.8.
Group B: 1.1.47, 1.1.51, 1.1.54, 1.1.57, 1.1.70, 1.2.40, 1.4.2, 1.4.62,
1.4.81, 2.1.2, 2.2.31, 2.4.26, 3.1.2, 6.1.84, 6.1.94, 6.1.112, 6.1.115,
6.1.120, 6.2.199, 6.4.156, 7.3.22, 7.3.27, 7.4.80, 7.4.88, 7.4.93, 8.1.2,
8.1.56, 8.2.92, 8.3.4, 8.3.6, 8.3.26, 8.3.27, 8.3.35, 8.3.87, 8.3.110,
8.3.118, 8.4.28, 8.4.58.
Let us consider an example from Group A. 1.1.34
*p?rvapar?varadak?i?ottar?par?dhar??i
vyavasth?y?m asa?j??y?m* (*vibh??? jasi sarvan?m?ni*) teaches that the
terms *p?rva*, *para* etc. are called *sarvan?ma* optionally when followed
by *Jas*. In 1.1.34 and in the other rules belonging to Group A, *para* is
used as an ordinary word of the object language Sanskrit. In these rules,
it does not have any special technical connotation with respect to P??ini?s
derivational system. We are not interested in Group A, because 1.4.2
belongs to group B.
Let us consider some examples from Group B. 1.1.47 *mid aco?nty?t
para? *teaches
that an item marked with *anubandha* *M* is placed after, i.e., to the
right-hand side of, the last vowel of the item to which it is added. 1.1.51 *ur
a? rapara?* teaches that *r* is added after, i.e., to the right side of the
vowels *a*, *i*, *u* when they are substitutes of *r?*. 1.1.54 *?de?
parasya* teaches that a substitute taught for the following or right-hand
