Dear colleagues,
I have been trying unsuccessfully to locate on archive.org <http://archive.org/> a pdf of 
Bh?sarvaj?a?s Ny?yas?ra, edited with autocommentary Ny?yabh??a?a and editor's commentary, by Yogindrananda Svami. Varanasi 1968.
I?d be grateful if someone could share it, in particular the section on anum?na.
All best wishes,
