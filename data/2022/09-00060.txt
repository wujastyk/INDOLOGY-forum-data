Hi Tim,
There are many many references to a matsyasUkta including texts about tArA.

1 Go to
https://muktalib7.com/DL_CATALOG_ROOT/DL_CATALOG/DL_CATALOG_USER_INTERFACE/dl_user_interface_frameset.htm
2. enter username: muktabodha     password: indology123
3. At the top left where it says *Search for: *   enter *<matsyasUkt>*
Note: make sure you enter it exactly as I've written with the angle
brackets and leaving off the last letter of the name and with the U in
upper case.
4. Click on the button where it says Search for words in e-texts
5. . Two panels will then open up, an upper panel and a lower panel.  The
upper panel gives all the lines in the digital library where  matsyasUkt
occurs sorted by text.  When you click on any line in the upper panel the
entire text will then open up in the lower panel at the line you clicked on.

hope this helps
Harry Spier
