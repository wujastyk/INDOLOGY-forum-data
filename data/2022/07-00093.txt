Dear list members,
Does anyone have a pdf of S.K. Belvalkar's english translation of the
Bhagavadgita. This was published by Bilvakunja publishing house, Poona,
1943.

There is also an edition of the Bhagavdgita by Belvalkar published in 1959,
Vol 1 of the Hindu Vishvavidyalaya Nepal Rajya Sanskrit Series with an
english tranlsation by him..
Thanks,
Harry Spier
