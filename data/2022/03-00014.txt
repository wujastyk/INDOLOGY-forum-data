Dear Martin, Agathe and Bill,

Thanks a lot for your quick and helpful responses! The B?hatsa?hit? reference is precisely the kind of source I was looking for.

Best wishes,

Arlo

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] five designations of tithis

Dear Arlo,

The cycle of five tithis is given in B?hatsa?hit? 98.1-2 (3rd tithi vijay? instead of jay?). This system is likely based on an older system of 15 tithis attested in the G?rg?yajyoti?a as discussed in my paper.

Mak, Bill. 2018. ?Tithikarmagu?a in G?rg?yajyoti?a ? Tithi Worship According to a Number of Early Sources?. Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies 66 (3): 958?91.

Best regards,

Bill

Dear colleagues,

In Louis-Charles Damais' study ??tudes d??pigraphie indon?sienne, IV: Discussion de la date des inscriptions? (Bulletin de l??cole fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient 47 (1) [https://doi.org/10.3406/befeo.1955.5406], p. 70 n. 1) one reads about "cinq qualifications des tithi". According to the author, there are five such designations for tithis, i.e.

- Nand? (tithi # 1, 6 and 11 waxing or waning)
- ?hadr? (tithi # 2, 7 and 12 waxing or waning)
- Jay? (tithi # 3, 8 and 13 waxing or waning)
- Rikt? (tithi # 4, 9 et 14 waxing or waning)
- P?r?? (tithi # 5, 10 and 15 waxing or waning)

He cites (11th-c.) Javanese epigraphical occurrences of three of these designations, but does not cite his source for the whole system.

Does it have its origin in Indian jyoti???stra? I'd be grateful for references.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
