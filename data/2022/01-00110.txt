Dear List members,
I am looking for information about the letter (ak?ara) ai in Hindi: does it represent the long vowel (/?/) or the short one (/?/)? The word I have in mind is bai?k in yun?i?e? bai?k o.ph i?diy? (United Bank of India). In English a in bank is short, but in Skt, to which my knowledge is restricted, the ak?ara ai is long.
With kind regards, Herman
