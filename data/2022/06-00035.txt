[INDOLOGY] Journals publishing epigraphs currently
 <692C2D1A-E71B-4405-A232-E79B71863894@uclouvain.be>
Dear Dr Patel, dear colleagues
I would dare to remind readers of this list that the *Indo-Iranian Journal*
(IIJ) is happy to continue its tradition of publishing works relevant to
Indian epigraphy. (As far as I recall,  at least in the past the journal's
coverage has been largely limited to Sanskrit and Prakrit epigraphs, but I
do not see why South Indian epigraphs could not also be considered.)
This said, the IIJ looks for articles which would place such epigraphs in a
meaningful context, and thus are more than what at least some of the ASI
publications present, namely raw data as it were, as valuable as such data
of course are!
