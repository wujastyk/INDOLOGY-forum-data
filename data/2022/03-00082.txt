Though it is not clear what prompted Osella's sudden India ban, Osella's
studies of Muslim reform movement in Kerala were at odds with the Hindutva
argument.
Here is what Osella states in his seminal study 'Islamism and Social Reform
in Kerala, South India':
"We perceive strong academic trends of frank distaste for reformism, which
is then inaccurately - and dangerously buttressing Hindutva rhetoric -
branded
as going against the grain of South Asian society.
This often goes along with the inaccurate branding of all reformism as
'foreign inspired' or wah'habi."
