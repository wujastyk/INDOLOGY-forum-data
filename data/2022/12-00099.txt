The same review was made into a video , shared with the following message :
Many people reached out to me personally asking to prepare a video giving
the summary of my view. Therefore I have uploaded a 30 min video now -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i59Gvv1Oj9o
I sincerely urge all the interested members of this group to watch at least
the first 10 minutes of the video where I summarize my view.
Thanks and Pranaam!
