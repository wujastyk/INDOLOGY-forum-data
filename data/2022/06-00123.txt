Dear Colleagues,
I have the pleasure of bringing the below publication announcement to your
notice:
Anett Krause
Mok?op?ya: Stellenkonkordanz Mok?op?ya ? Yogav?si??ha ? Laghuyogav?si??ha.
Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz 2022, pp. 252. 68,00 EUR.
ISBN 978-3-447-11713-5
The present concordance enables for the first time a direct synopsis of the
verse numbers of the *Mok?op?ya* edition with those of the *Yogav?si??ha*
edition as well as with the abridged & truncated edition printed under the
title *Laghu-Yogav?si??ha*.
Of particular importance is the possibility, for the first time, of
identifying the corresponding passages of the Kashmirian *Mok?op?ya* from
both the widely used and frequently cited pan-Indian *Yogav?si??ha* vulgate
and the geographically rather southerly *Laghu-Yogav?si??ha* ? and, of
course, vice versa.
Anett Krause?s concordance of verse numbers allows quick access to the
wording, content, context, and intention of the respective passages in all
