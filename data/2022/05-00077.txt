[INDOLOGY] Gourds

This gourd is called ?bottle gourd,? (commercial English?), ?lauki? (Hindi?), ?opu? (Spanish?) ?curaikk?y/suraikkaay? in Tamil. In Tamilnadu, young boys, learning to swim, use the dried-up gourd of this type as a ?life-guard.? They tie it around their waist while jumping into a well or a river while swimming. In pre-modern S.India, the dried up gourd was used to make the base of a musical string instrument, I believe. This gourd is not bitter, and very good for diabetic patients, I believe.
