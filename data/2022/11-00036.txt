[INDOLOGY] Addendum on quotative marking
Dear All,
Just a short note to bring to everyone?s attention the following article Rothstein-Dowden, Zachary. 2022. On the etymology of ?ha. Journal of the American Oriental Society 142 (1): 51-61.
Rothstein-Dowden raises the possibility that ?ha had quotative function at an earlier stage which, if correct, would push the prehistory of Indo-Aryan/Sanskrit quotative marking even farther back in time.
All the best,
Hans Henrich
