Subject: [INDOLOGY] caesura (yati)
Message-ID: <ad58a4b0eed367fff0983d878d8ec9d0@univie.ac.at>

Dear List Members,

do you know any relevant studies etc. on caesurae (yati) in Sanskrit 
metrics? I'm espacially interested in how strict they have to be 
followed and to what extend they are or may be disobeyed.

Thank you,
