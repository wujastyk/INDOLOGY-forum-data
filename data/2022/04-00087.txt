Dear Friends,

I'm trying to hunt down a copy of this book. It's only 41 pp. Apparently on
p. 38 there is a mention of mallastambha.

I would appreciate some help in sourcing a pdf or even a photo taken from a
flip phone of this particular page. There's no particular urgency. It's
more of a curious list-checking exercise.

The fire works and fire festivals in ancient India.
