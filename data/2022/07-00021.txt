A good pdf of Burnell?s Va?sabr?hma?a can be downloaded from

J. N. Reuter?s The ?rauta-S?tra of Dr?hy?ya?a with the commentary of Dhanvin, Part I, was supposed to appear as part 25:2 of Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicae, but it never did. Because devanagari printing could not be done in Finland, the book was typeset in London, and a very limited number of copies were published by Luzac & Co. in London in 1904. 
Best wishes, Asko
