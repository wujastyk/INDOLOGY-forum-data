It seems to me speaking of an Indic diminishing of a dyaus pitar as maybe
jumping the gun. There are plenty of heavenly figures (tvastr and savitar
are often characterized as deva/divya) but the importance of a dyaus pitar
can't even really be reconstructed to the indo-Iranian level. Important
father figures are the Father Asura from RV 10.124, Kuiper has some
interesting thoughts on this. And of course there is a heavenly mother in
Aditi, I think it's first in Breretons the Rgvedic Adityas he suggests an
adj a-diti "unbound" that applied to heavenly could be reanalyzed as the
femimine partner of Heaven and become a goddess in her own right. If I
misremember these things please forgive, I'm on my phone bouncing my
newborn currently.
It seems to me a particulary important part of Indra's character that he is
not a biological father, and thus perhaps any study of the figure of a
dyaus pitar might have to really re think what the family as an in situ
political unit means in PIE and IIr. It's not really obvious to me that a
steppe clan based family in a segmentation society should in any way have a
similar concept of family and paternity as the fixed field agrarian Greek
or Roman one. Sorry is not more helpful.
Best,
