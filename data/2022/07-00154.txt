[INDOLOGY] Jamison article
Dear list members,
I'm writing in the hope that someone might have a soft copy of Stephanie
Jamison's 1994 article
"Draupad? on the Walls of Troy: 'Iliad' 3 from an Indic perspective",
*Classical
Antiquity *13.1: 5-16
that they're willing to share. It is available here
https://online.ucpress.edu/ca/article-abstract/13/1/5/25510/Draupadi-on-the-Walls-of-Troy-Iliad-3-from-an?redirectedFrom=PDF
but none of the university libraries I'm affiliated with can get me in.
Many thanks,
Robert
