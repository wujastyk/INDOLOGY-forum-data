Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit sandhi and pronounciation
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o-zmwv+gGXZ175KEOR8Wu7XCBSyQJS02Cru9N+W3wrh3A@mail.gmail.com>

First, thank you for the many clear english and other languages sandhi
examples.  I don't know how you all answer so quickly and with perfect
spelling.  Presumably from years of typing up lectures or answering
students emails..

Secondly, I want to explain to my  sanskrit chanting but non-sanskrit
knowing, non-linguistic audience how and why in the different mantras the
word *nama?* is spelled and pronounced differently. Its easy to explain how
*nama?* becomes *namas* in the phrase *namas te .*
But with the other pronounciations there are some complications to explain.

1)
*nama? ?iv?ya* is overwhelmingly written *nama? ?iv?ya* and rarely as *nama?
?iv?ya* or  *nama??iv?ya .* In GRETIL there is  *nama? ?iv?ya *193
times, *nama?
?iv?ya* 8 times, and  *nama??iv?ya* 0 times. But I've only heard the
written  *nama? ?iv?ya* chanted as  *nama ?iv?ya *and never as
*namaha ?iv?ya* (i.e. with the visarga pronounced).. I had always assumed
that what was happening was that the written  *nama? ?iv?ya *was being
chanted as if it was the sandhi transformed *nama??iv?ya* .

How do Indians pronounce *nama? ?iv?ya* when they chant it in a hymn or in
a mantra?

2) Is there a way to explain the process how *nama? n?r?ya??ya *becomes *namo
n?r?ya??ya*  that would be understandable to someone who wasn't a linguist
or a sanskritist. An explanation that would be understandable, but  deeper
than just stating the rule: *a?* becomes *o* before voiced consonants.

 Thanks again,
Harry Spier
