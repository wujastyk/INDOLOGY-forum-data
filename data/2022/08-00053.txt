Here are some scholarly deliberations on visarga versus parasavar?a in
Sanskrit:
W. S. Allen (1953: 51):
"In later, though still ancient, times there appears to have been a
tendency for -*?* to extend its usage to contexts other than in pausa. The
earliest of these extensions was to the position before the initial
fricatives *?, ?**, s,*
where it replaced the homorganic final *?, ?, s* (*indra???ra? **> indra?
??ra?*, &c). This practice was then extended to the position before the velar
and labial voiceless stops: in connexion with this innovation we find
mentioned the names of  ?gnive?ya, V?lm?ki, ??kalya, and the
M?dhyandina school,
whilst the ancient grammarian ??ka??yana is quoted as holding to the more
conservative practice."
Allen also refers to A. H. Fry?s (1941) view that ?the spread of *-?* was
due to the writers of Classical Sanskrit operating with a phonemic
orthography.?
