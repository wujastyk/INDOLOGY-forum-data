[INDOLOGY] Contact info for Theodore Proferes
A friend who is working on the A?vins and the Vedic concept of the 
chariot is trying to reach Prof. Theodore Proferes with a question 
relating to his book "Vedic Ideals of Sovereignty and?the?Poetics of 
Power". However, he has been unable to find any contact information for 
him.
If anybody on the list has a functioning email address for Prof. 
Proferes and believe it would be acceptable to share it, I would be 
grateful to receive it off-list.
Best regards,
Jacob Schmidt-Madsen
