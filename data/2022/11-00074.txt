Dear Colleagues,
	I would like to announce a discount offered for the publication of the introductory Sanskrit textbook I have been gradually developing over the past 30 years:

???????????? A linguistic introduction to Sanskrit, 2 volumes. Vol. I: Text and exercises, and Vol. II: Appendices.

I began writing this textbook as I taught Sanskrit in the Classics Department at Brown University for 19 years, at various technical institutes in India for 10 years, and since 2020 on-line through The Sanskrit Library where I have developed an interactive exercise platform that provides just-in-time help at every stage.

Today, 24 November, Lulu Press is offering a 30% discount available on this textbook as well as on the two volumes of papers on Sanskrit grammar and Indo-European linguistics I edited in honor of George Cardona.

Please follow the links on The Sanskrit Library?s Publications page (SanskritLibrary dot Org) for details and to purchase these volumes.

Yours,

Peter Scharf
