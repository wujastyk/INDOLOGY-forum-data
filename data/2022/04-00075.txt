Dear colleagues,
I am happy to inform you that the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and the Department of South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies of the University of Vienna are organising the first "Vienna Summer School on the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia". The summer School will take place in person, in Vienna, Austria, between 18 July 2022 and 23 July 2022.  
The title of the 2022 event is ?Theory of Knowledge in premodern South Asia: An Introduction with the Reading of Original Sanskrit Texts?. 
Please circulate this call widely. The event suits particularly students (both undergraduates and graduates) who are willing to have a first-hand contact with South Asian epistemological theories, and who have a moderate to good knowledge of scientific Sanskrit. For those interested, the summer School is also able to offer ECTS points.

The Vienna summer school on the History and Cultures of Asia is offering an intensive one-week introduction to the theory of knowledge in South Asian philosophical traditions.
The summer school will introduce participants to the epistemological theory used in Sanskrit texts. It is aimed at anyone who has an interest in reading scientific Sanskrit works that refer to epistemological concepts. Participants will be able to work intensively with established experts based at the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Institute of South Asian, Tibetan, and Buddhist Studies of the University of Vienna, centres renowned internationally for the study of South Asian philosophy of knowledge.
The course will focus on validity (pr?m??ya) and the instruments of knowledge (pram??as), including perception, inferential reasoning, and verbal knowledge. The participants will be introduced to the main theories of different schools, including Ny?ya, Ved?nta, Buddhist, and Jaina thought. Lectures by experts on individual subjects will be combined with focused readings of relevant texts in the original Sanskrit.
