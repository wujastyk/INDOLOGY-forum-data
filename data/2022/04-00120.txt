Request to Share a Reference Tool for Finding Sanskrit Place-Legends
Greetings INDOLOGY Committee:
When I wrote my master?s thesis in Oriental Studies at UPenn, over forty 
years ago, I wanted it to be a reference tool for researchers to use to 
find m?h?tmya, or sthalapur??a, manuscripts (and secondary literature) 
relating, in large part, to place-legends of pilgrimage sites in India.? 
The thesis, titled "M?h?tmyas: ?A Preliminary Descriptive Survey 
(Including a List of M?h?tmyas Compiled from Aufrecht's Catalogus 
Catalogorum)," is now available in digitized, downloadable format on the 
Penn Libraries? ScholarlyCommons website.? (Please see the attached 
screenshot.)
It is the list of just over 700 manuscripts from Aufrecht?s three-volume 
catalogue (and my notes and bibliography relating to them) that I think 
the members of INDOLOGY might find useful for their own research.
I am not a member of your group, so I am writing to ask that if you 
think your members would be interested in this reference tool, you 
please share the bibliographic information for it with them. Please also 
feel welcome to share my email address in case anyone has questions that 
I might (hopefully) be able to answer.
Thank you sincerely,
