I think the Murty Sanskrit font looks good when printed on paper, but a lot
less good on a computer screen.  Probably this is an issue of the fine
details that get lost in screen rasterization.  Or maybe the font isn't
optimized for antialiasing.  I don't know.   Maybe the Tiro variant solves
this.
Best,
Dominik
