Our team has been translating the Apoha Section of the first chapter of Dharmak?rti's Pram??av?rttika. We need all the help we can get! So I typed in a sentence that I was struggling with just yesterday, PVSV (Gnoli edn.) 62,24?26:
??????????? ?? ?? ????? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ????????????????????  ????????????????????????? ???????? ??? /
Here's what I got from Google Translate: "Even when this word is inserted, it is reversed from which it differs, and another inversion is inserted in the difference of those differing, which appears to be of the same form."
My own tentative translation would be (of course, we use square brackets for clarity): "This word, even as it is being assigned [at the time of making the convention], is assigned to a [common] difference ? [a difference] which presents the same form ? of things which [in fact] differ [individually from each other], by rejecting that from which [its meaning] differs; [being so assigned, the word] implies the exclusion of [those] other [entities]."
The context: Dharmak?rti is explaining and defending Dign?ga's puzzling but oft-quoted statement, from PSV 5: ?abdo 'rth?ntaraniv?ttivi??t?n eva bh?v?n ?ha, "A word expresses entities qualified by the negation of other meanings" (Cf. Pind 2015: II.140.)
My translation, a first attempt, may not be crystal clear, and even when greatly improved by the team it will still require an explanatory footnote or two, but Google's is no help at all. Note specifically that it could not construe yasm?d bhidyate ta? vinivartya; a correct passive subject of bhidyate has to be supplied. It also translates vy?v?tti as "inversion" instead of "exclusion." It doesn't understand the technical meaning of niVI? - either "assign" or "apply." And it does not recognize ?k?iptatadanyavy?v?tti? as a bahuvr?hi that goes with ?abda (the analysis of which, however, is not straightforward). Can these sorts of glitches be corrected? Maybe. I don't know, but from my perspective the basic problem just seems to be that Google has not understood what Dharmak?rti is saying.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Google Translate for Sanskrit
This is Google Translator for the first verse of Meghad?ta:
"Someone is neglected by the teacher of separation from his lover:
Shapenastangmitamahima varshabhogyaena bhartu:
The yaksha bathed Janaka's daughter in the holy waters
I lived in the hermitages of Ramagiri among the lush shady trees."
GT could not figure out the long compounds, and "guru" got translated as "teacher." The syntax of the verse is also missed.
