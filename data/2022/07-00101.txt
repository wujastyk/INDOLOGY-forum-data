Thanks for these suggestions, Heiner. I wonder if the cakradhara <-> 
Vai??ava connection relates to Vai??avas being branded with the symbols 
of conch and discus (as I have never seen Vai??avas carrying actual 
wheels/discuses around)? In any case, I suspect it meant something 
different in 6th-century (or earlier) North India.
The epithet caraka made me wonder about the Carakasa?hit? with its 
Buddhist connections (discussed by Dominik Wujastyk and others). Is the 
name a coincidence?
Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
