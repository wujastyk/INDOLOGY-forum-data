Dear colleagues,
I am looking for a good historical treatment of those parts of western 
India where large numbers of Konkani speakers are found. While this 
obviously includes Goa, I am also interested in Konkani speakers further 
to the north in Maharashtra but also to the east of Goa and especially 
to the south into Karnataka (and also Cochin, but that is not my 
priority right now).
This does not have to be a specialized book on these regions alone, but 
what I am especially interested in is an account of when large numbers 
of Konkani speakers entered these southern regions - preferably already 
before the arrival of the Portuguese, when many were forced to flee Goa. 
Also, any information on Dravidian speakers in Goa (and related issues) 
would be greatly appreciated.
Sorry for the very basic question, but I am not a historian and all 
attempts so far find any relevant information have turned up nothing. I 
know most older accounts do not care much about the languages people 
spoke, but also any references to other groups (e.g., "Brahmans from the 
north" or something like that which may allude to Konkani speakers) from 
these areas would also be of help. Many thanks!
Best,
John
