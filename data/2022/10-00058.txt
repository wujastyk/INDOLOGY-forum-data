[INDOLOGY] dvigata "ambiguous"
?Dear list members,
Monier Williams (p. 504c) mentions the expression dvigata, meaning "ambiguous" (with reference to Pata?jali, a text I am not familiar with). I would like to know the exact place and how certain the meaning "ambiguous" is in the passage concerned, and furthermore if this is the only instance of this dvigata..
With kind regards, Herman
