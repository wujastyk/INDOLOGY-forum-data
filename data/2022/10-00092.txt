Perhaps the most complete list of Vi?i???dvaita commentaries on the Upani?ads is in the 20th volume of the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies (Vi?i???dvaita Ved?nta, ed. by Stephen H. Phillpis and Karl H. Potter, Motilal Banarsidass, 2017). It is useful that each entry indicates where the text was published (or whether it exists only in manuscript). Modern authors (from the 20th century) are also included.
