Dear list members,

Professor Shingo Einoo, the compiler of the beneficial database of 
Hinduism, Einoo Card (http://card.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), informed me today 
that someone has hacked into his PC. He asked me to announce:

If you get any emails from his mail address, seino1948 at gmail.com, please 
delete them immediately without opening them.

Best wishes

Kiyotaka Yoshimizu
