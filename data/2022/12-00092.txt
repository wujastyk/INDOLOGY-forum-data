Dear Raffaele,
     I cannot think of a sandhi solution that would give you
*sa?h?rekasya *from
*sa?h?re+ekasya*. The other possibility that occurred to me is to
interpret *kasya
*not as a question pronoun, but with *ka *referring to *brahm?*. Would it
make sense to take the compound *adhyak?a?e?at?m *connected to *kasya* to
mean *adhyak?a?e?at? *of Brahm?.  Could this refer to Vi??u's role as being
the overseer of the work of Brahm? in the functions of *sr???i, sthiti* and
*sa?h?ra*? This is similar to the Bhagavadg?t?: *may? adhyak?e?a prakr?ti?
s?yate sacar?caram*. Just a thought. With best regards,
Madhav
