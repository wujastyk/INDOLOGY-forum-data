I agree with Jens that *gu?i* is more common in inscriptional Telugu than
*k?vil(a)* or *k?yil(a) (*one instance of *k?yilamu* vs more than 10
instances of *gu?i *and its various forms of inflection*)*. Do we assume
the usage of  *k?vila/k?yila *for 'temple' is possibly a result of
influence from Tamil or Karnataka areas?
I agree with Chandra that *k?yilamu* is unlikely to be a personal name
given a clear neuter gender marker -*mu*.
Looks like Kannada has older instances of usage of *k?vil(a/u/e) and*
*k?yil(a/u/e).*
Thanks,
Suresh.
