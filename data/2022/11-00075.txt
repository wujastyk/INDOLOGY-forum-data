[INDOLOGY] Question
Dear Colleagues,
A former student has asked about me about the origins of red dresses for Hindu brides?
I know utterly nothing about this. Does anyone either know something about this or know of an article or two that I might (a) read myself and (b) pass on to the former student in question?
Best from a rainy Wales,
