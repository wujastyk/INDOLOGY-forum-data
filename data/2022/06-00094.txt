[INDOLOGY] Subscription problem ?
I have received a message to the effect that my membership is in the course of being disabled owing to excessive bounces. Before I attempt the fixes proposed I would be grateful if someone involved with list administration would let me know if the message was legitimate or a scam.
Thank you.
