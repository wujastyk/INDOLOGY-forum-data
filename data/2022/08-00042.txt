[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit sandhi and pronounciation
 <89867E67-E2D2-4795-B3A7-666944A4FCED@earthlink.net>
Dear list members,
 I asked for an explanation of the sandhi *nama? n?r?ya??ya *becomes *namo
n?r?ya??ya* .
I.e why *a?* before a soft consonent or *a* becomes *o* .
If it is of interest to anyone, I've found a linguistic explanation of this
in W.S. Allen's  book:
THE THEORETICAL, PHONETIC, AND HISTORICAL BASES OF WORD-JUNCTION IN SANSKRIT
on pages 70-71 .
