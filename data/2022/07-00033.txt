Dear Christian,

I'm afraid I can't answer either question at the moment. The 
history/etymology of the term was the first thing I wondered about too, 
and one may speculate that the underlying idea is line of marching 
soldiers stretching out (tan-), but I don't know for sure. Perhaps 
others do?

Best wishes,
Martin
