Dear colleagues,
The above-mentioned book, published in Hong Kong in 2008 (2nd edition), is
not available to me neither in Munich, nor in Leiden.
I wonder if anyone could provide me with a couple of pages from the book?
Sadly, I don't even have a table of contents of the said book,
but I have access to van Velthem's French translation, and the passages,
which interest me, are located on pp. 40-41 in it.
It is chapter IV ("Les formations"), the beginning of the second scroll
("second rouleau"). In particular, I require the whole paragraphs on
*up?d?na* and on *k?yagrantha*, if possible, with all the footnotes to
them. Any help will be much appreciated!
The full bibliographical details of two books are:
Van Velthem, Marcel. *Le trait? de la descente dans la profonde loi
*(Abhidharm?vat?ra??stra)
*de l?Arhat Skandhila* (Publications de l?Institut Orientaliste de Louvain
16). Louvain-la-Neuve, 1977.
Dhammajoti, KL. *Entrance into the supreme doctrine*: *Skandhila's*
Abhidharm?vat?ra. Hong Kong: Centre of Buddhist Studies, University of Hong
Kong, 2008.
Kind regards,
