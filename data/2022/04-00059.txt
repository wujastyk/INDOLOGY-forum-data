[INDOLOGY] Tattoo design
Dear indology list
Could you please advise Dr Jackie Hirst about the tattoo design shown in the attached picture? 
She says: ?It is a sketch, now in the possession of a father, that was found in the effects of his son, a young man who died tragically recently, and the family are keen to know what it means. He was interested in the Upani?ads and the Bhagavad G?t? amongst other things and frequently sketched lotuses. Would anyone be able to shed more light on this as a particular (basic indication of a) yantra and/or on the particular (mainly n?gar?) characters which do not seem to make sense as a word/words - could they be (an attempt to indicate) specific individual seed mantras? or?  If anyone has any further ideas, and how to convey them sensitively to the family, please reply to the list and/or to Jackie direct (jacqueline.hirst at manchester.ac.uk <mailto:jacqueline.hirst at manchester.ac.uk> - Honorary Research Fellow South Asian Studies).  With many thanks.'
Below is a Dropbox link to the design in question. It?s shared with the permission of the family.
