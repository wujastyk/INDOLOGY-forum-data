Dear Patel-ji,
I suppose you are mainly asking about India-based journals. I believe
the journal ?va?am actively publishes Tamil inscriptions, but I am not
so aware of that field of Indian epigraphy. I wanted to draw your
attention to the journal Pratna Samiksha: a Journal of Archaeology,
published by the Centre for Archaeological Studies & Training,
Kolkata. I believe that ever since they started a 'New Series' about
twenty years ago, every volume has contained a section 'Epigraphy'.
The epigraphs that have been published in this venue are mainly from
what is now Eastern India (Bihar, WB, Assam, Orissa) and what is now
Bangladesh. The language is almost always Sanskrit.
I hope this is useful for you.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths

Dear Dr Patel, dear colleagues
I would dare to remind readers of this list that the Indo-Iranian
Journal (IIJ) is happy to continue its tradition of publishing works
relevant to Indian epigraphy. (As far as I recall,? at least in the
past the journal's coverage has been largely limited to Sanskrit and
Prakrit epigraphs, but I do not see why South Indian epigraphs could
not also be considered.)
This said, the IIJ looks for articles which would place such epigraphs
in a meaningful context, and thus are more than what at least some of
the ASI publications present, namely raw data as it were, as valuable
as such data of course are!
Jonathan Silk
co-editor of the IIJ
