[INDOLOGY] Indian linguistic studies in honor of George Cardona
Dear Colleagues,
	The Sanskrit Library has just published two volumes I edited consisting of 37 papers on linguistics and related disciplines in honor of Professor George Cardona.  The first volume contains 18 papers on Indian grammatical traditions (vy?kara?a) and cognitive linguistics (??bdabodha).  The second volume contains 19 papers on archaeology, historical linguistics, Vedic, philosophy and critical editing.  The papers, by prominent scholars world-wide, make essential contributions to these fields.  Many of the papers make ground-breaking or critical contributions.  The Sanskrit Library publications page
