Namaste
??????? here seems to refer to the use of purely ??????? words which do not
retain the same form in ???????.
Verse 51 is ?????????? since, except the last ???
(??????????????????????????), all the remaining 3 ???s -
(?????????????????) (?????? ?????????? ??) (???????? ???????????) are
composed of ??????? words that retain the same form in ???????.
Verse 52 is ??????????????? because, in contrast to its first half, the
second half (?????????) - ?????????????????????????????????????????? - is
again composed of ??????? words that retain the same form in ???????. The
first half, in that sense, has pure ??????? forms (which, if rendered by
their respective ??????? equivalents, will undergo a morphological
transformation that will alter them substantially from those Sanskrit
forms).
Verse 53 is ?????????????? because, in contrast to its second half, the
first half - ??????????????????????????? ????????? - in a way similar to
the one described above, is composed of ??????? words that retain the same
form in ???????. The second half, in this case, is therefore conposed of
"pure" Sanskrit forms and therefore ???????
Thank you
