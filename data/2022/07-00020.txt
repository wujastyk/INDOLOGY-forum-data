Dear Colleagues,
good morning (or other time of the day!).
On behalf of the ?gama Research Group, I am bringing to your attention a
paper by Bhikkhu An?layo presenting a detailed critical evaluation of
Eviatar Shulman?s Visions of the Buddha, Creative Dimensions of Early
Buddhist Scripture (2021):
Bhikkhu An?layo, ??Visions of the Buddha?: A Critical Reply?, Journal of
Buddhist Studies, 2021, 18: 1?36.

those who will be receiving this message twice.)
