Dear David,
indeed, finding a file on archive.org is sometimes tricky. I have developed several strategies that help me. Keeping in mind the nice Chinese proverb about the fish and the fisherman, I will share one useful strategy.
If I suspect that a book may have been scanned as part of the DLI project, but I cannot find it on archive.org easily, I go to the DLI mirror (https://dli.sanskritdictionary.com/). Here it is possible to search by title or author, but most importantly it is possible to search for a substring. So I pick the most stable substring from the complicated Sanskrit name, which can be written in many ways, and search for that. Besides, the search fields here have an autocomplete feature so you can see what the possibilities are.
After a successful search, you can either get the pdf directly from this site (if it is there, which it is not always), or you can find it on archive.org, preferably by using the number in the "Identifier URI" field (e.g. in the case of your text it is 483197, if you enter that number in the archive.org search you will find the page).
To sum up, for more complicated titles, I strongly recommend starting your search on this DLI Mirror site.
Best
Lubomir
