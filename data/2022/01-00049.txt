Dear Guy, Samuel, and P?ter-D?niel,

Thank you all very much for your help.

I've requested a PDF scan of chapter 7 from the Isaacson & Sferra book via
worldcat. I am also currently conducting research in Kathmandu, so I will
see if the MS/microfilm is still available directly from the Kaiser
Library. Thank you P?ter-D?niel for this lead.

For the sake of thoroughness, I will also follow up with the University of
Calgary Library, as it appears they too have some or all of the IASWR
collection. Thank you Guy St Amant and Samuel Grimes for this suggestion.

Mangalam.
