Dear Indologists,

 

There is a person who is mentioned in a C??a Tamil inscription of the early 11th century. His name is C??aka? C?v?r Para?c?ti. C??aka? means he was probably a Muslim or Arab Muslim. I need to contact a scholar of Sharia law as existed in the 10th/11th century to explore the background of this person. I would appreciate any suggestions of contact information for scholars to contact. 

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
