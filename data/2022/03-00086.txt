Dear all,
the 48th canto of the Haravijaya, one of two called  
?Citrayuddhavar?anam? in it, contains three verses in which different  
variants of a technique called Niravadya are applied:
gabh?radh?r?ravar??abh?rura??dar? d?ru?av?ra?? s? |
abha?gur? v?ravir??hah?vasur??gan?dak?aka??k?amok?ai? || 51 ||  
(p?daniravadya?)
prabh?mayen?ricam?s tad?n?? sal?lam ?sph?litac?paya??i? |
vir??hasa?rambhasur?rib??asa?bh?rasa?ruddhakar?raku?j? || 52 ||  
(pr?gardhaniravadya?)
?r??har??h?marab??aviddhatura?gam?l? ra?ar?gam??h? |
n?t? vihastatvabhibhai? sah?tha suvar?as?nor gahan?ny avik?at || 13 ||  
(caram?rdhaniravadya?)
V. Balasubramaniam lists these in his Citram book (2007, vol. I, p.  
313f.), but unfortunately without explaining the restriction. I have  
not yet found any other instances of this technique being used. Is  
anybody familiar with this technique, or can spot a pattern, and could  
explain what is the ?blameless? element in these stanzas?
Best wishes
