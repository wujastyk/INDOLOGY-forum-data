Harry ~ I love reading all these responses. When explaining sandhi to my
undergrads in my intro to Hinduism course, I tell them that Sanskrit
privileges the spoken over the written. When they ask me what that means, I
say to them, "I'm gonna tell ya," and then I write "I'm gonna tell ya" on
the board.
All best,
Mark
