[INDOLOGY] Might anyone have an idea what this could be?

Dear Friends
I wrote to the dealer and received photos, which is exactly what Antonio
Ferreira-Jardim also did. The dealer sent photos to me last evening, and to
Antonio, and we both were able quickly to identify them.
A quick summary: there are photos of Tibetan texts, not Sanskrit I am
afraid, although the very first page says in large letters rgya gar skad
du; I wonder if someone told the then owner what this meant.
In any event, while the photos are not very easy to read, at least the end
(or the last photo I received) contains the short sdig pa thams cad bshags
pa?i mdo; but there must also be other contents which I did not ruin my
eyes trying to identify.
I have no idea what happened to the originals.
Antonio tracked down a newspaper article from 1922  which gives an
impression of a much greater volume of text, but I'm not sure what would
have happened to these documents.
Antonio concludes "Probably Mr Richard was sold a bundle of confessional
texts that he then conflated to be the Kanjur, Tanjur and indeed the answer
to the origin of the "Aryans" -"
This indeed seems likely.
In any event, there is no long-lost Sanskrit manuscript here, more's the
pity.
With thanks to all those who offered to track down the pamphlet itself;
this might still prove interesting, especially if it were possible thereby
to get good quality scans of the entire book. I suspect that the other
texts are also known, but who knows? Maybe there is value in finding out
what is there, even if the originals cannot now be traced.
