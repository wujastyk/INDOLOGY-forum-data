I eventually managed to track down one mention of this word (with both 
variants given) in the Hal?yudhako?a, where it is treated as a noun: 
/?ve?ika? pr?dyu?aka ?gantur atithi? sm?ta?/. I am still curious to know 
if anyone has actually seen it used, though, and whether (as implied by 
its use in the translation from the Arabic) it originally had the sense 
of /frequent/regular/ guest or visitor.
