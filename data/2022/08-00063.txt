[INDOLOGY] vedic revival
Dear Friends,
I'm compiling a bibliography and would appreciate any suggestions on books,
chapters, sections, films, YouTube clips, and any other related media.
The topic is "Vedic Revival / Vedic Revivalism".
I have compiled references that mostly cover the contemporary
manifestations of this phenomenon, though I am sure there might be things
I've missed.
If there are any recommendations on particular references to earlier,
historical periods, then I would be delighted to know what these might be.
If there certain thematic groupings one might apply, please let me know.
These references could be in any language, not being restricted to English.
Thank you in advance.
All the best,
