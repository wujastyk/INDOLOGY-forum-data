Subject: [INDOLOGY] Kenneth and Joyce Robbins South Asian Collection donated
 to Penn Libraries
Message-ID: <337bdbdaf0f6d801c5e7f3cf1aecd877@fabularasa.dk>

I just received word of these wonderful news:

https://www.library.upenn.edu/blog/university-pennsylvania-libraries-receives-major-gift-kenneth-and-joyce-robbins-collection

While Ken has always been very approachable and helpful in my dealings 
with him, the donation of the collection together with "a planned gift 
of $400,000 to the Libraries for processing and preservation" will 
hopefully make the collection much more widely available to researchers.

Best,
Jacob Schmidt-Madsen
