[INDOLOGY] Kenneth and Joyce Robbins South Asian Collection donated
 to Penn Libraries
I just received word of these wonderful news:
https://www.library.upenn.edu/blog/university-pennsylvania-libraries-receives-major-gift-kenneth-and-joyce-robbins-collection
While Ken has always been very approachable and helpful in my dealings 
with him, the donation of the collection together with "a planned gift 
of $400,000 to the Libraries for processing and preservation" will 
hopefully make the collection much more widely available to researchers.
Best,
Jacob Schmidt-Madsen
