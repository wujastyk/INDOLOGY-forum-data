Dear Ramdas,
Thank you for this. I realise I should have been clearer. I?m aware of the
widespread practice of transmitting mantras secretly in a variety of South
Asian contexts. What I should have have expressed more clearly is that I?m
not sure whether Dhanvantari features more often than other deities in the
transmission of at least partially concealed mantras in ?yurvedic contexts.
Though I?m not sure how one would find out!
All best wishes,
