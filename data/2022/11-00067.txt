[INDOLOGY] CfP of the ECSAS 2023, Torino / Panel on "Health,
 Disease and Epidemics"
Dear colleagues,
I don't think it has been mentioned here that the submission of papers 
for the ECSAS 2023 in Turin is now possible: 
https://ecsas2023turin.eu/call-for-papers/
Deadline is January 15, 2023.
At this opportunity I would also like to mention the panel on "Health, 
disease and epidemics: multidisciplinary perspectives on the 
socio-ecology of medicine in pre-modern South Asia 
<https://ecsas2023turin.eu/panel/05-health-disease-and-epidemics-multidisciplinary-perspectives-on-the-socio-ecology-of-medicine-in-pre-modern-south-asia/>" 
planned by Julia Shaw and me. We are looking forward to many interesting
