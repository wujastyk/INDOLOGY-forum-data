Dear Jan,

if you have a look at this link,


https://archive.org/details/gc-sh10-0106/page/n25/mode/1up

(also included as an attachment)

you can see a short ? printed with a RING above, which is the same as 
the RING used on vowel-less consonants

See stanza 68 i.e. (??)

eripi?anti?un??...................

This is from the 1834 Editio Princeps of the C???ma?inika??u

This  book was part of the collection of the late Fran?ois Gros.
He donated his books to the University of Toronto and they have 
digitized them and put them online.

Interestingly, the trick of using a DOT/Ring above is used only for 
initial vowel signs,
as you can from this page

https://archive.org/details/gc-sh10-0106/page/n13/mode/1up

if you compare the way they print

????????????????? .... (in Stanza 22)

and
??????????????????? ... (in Stanza 24)

As for the LONG ? printed WITHOUT a RING above

you can see one on this page
https://archive.org/details/gc-sh10-0106/page/n24/mode/1up

"??????????", which would be nowadays printed as "??????????"

Best wishes

????????
