[INDOLOGY] Translation of Ratirahasya?
Dear List Members,
Greetings!
I wonder if anyone could kindly provide me with more information about this
particular translation of *Ratirahasya* (*Koka??stra*)?

Neither its translator nor publishing place is indicated in the document,
and it's clear that it's not the translation of either Alex Comfort or S.
C. Upadhyaya. I would really appreciate it if anyone could kindly shed some
light on this.
Thank you so much!
best wishes,
Yang Qu
