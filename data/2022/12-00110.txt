Dear Jan,
There is a chapter in Sanskritic Bengal, in the Caitanya-carit?m?ta (c 1557) in which Caitanya walks through the Jharikhanda forest and causes tigers, elephants etc to ?embrace? and ?dance? ecstatically in spiritual love. This episode is found in the Madhya-l?l?, chapter 17: https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/madhya/17/
There is also a translation, published by Harvard Oriental Series, by the late Professor Dimock of Chicago. https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674002852
Best wishes,
Howard
