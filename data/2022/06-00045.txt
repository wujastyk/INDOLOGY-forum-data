Dear Antonia,

I was unfortunate enough to buy the so-called "frequency dictionary" by K.
Schmidt a few years ago.
Having checked it, I was astounded by the number of mistakes. I actually
wanted to write an (outraged)
 book review, and here is a good place to warn everyone that the amount and
character of mistakes
definitely render the book unsuitable for learning purposes, or, put
simply, any learner should avoid it.
However, those who have already learnt the language and read the core
texts, would find the arrangement
of lexical items from the most frequent ones to the least frequent ones at
least probable (only regarding the
Sutta-pi?aka texts).

I also couldn't find the original publication and I wonder if the
publishers of the book perhaps
got their hands on an unpublished draft/manuscript or simply put the name
of the author on someone's/
their own creation for respectability.

In principle, some of the most frequent P?li words are those which comprise
the most popular formulas, *verbatim *
repeated portions of texts. The full statistical analysis, AFAIK, has not
been done, but some of the materials
published by the P?li Text Society provide valuable information in this
regard.

Another important question is what we understand by "P?li". The four old
Nik?yas, the whole Sutta-pi?aka, the whole Tipi?aka,
the commentaries, the subcommentaries, the learned treatises like the
Visuddhimagga or the modern P?li works?
Different people are interested in different "layers" of the P?li
literature, and for someone who is interested in later
(for instance, medieval) P?li sources a list of the most frequent words of
the four old Nik?yas would be of little use.

Kind regards,
Gleb Sharygin
