Dear Colleagues
Thank you very much for all your helpful replies, which I have forwarded to Jackie Hirst. 
Most suggestions have centred round the idea that the characters were an attempt to write the mah?v?kya tat tvam asi, but there is also the possibility that it is ?tmatattvam, which seems closer to the lettering we have, though perhaps less likely to be known by a non-specialist. If it is the former, it seems a very good message for the young man to have left to his family. 
Again, many thanks.
