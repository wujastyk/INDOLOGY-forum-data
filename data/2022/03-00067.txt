[INDOLOGY] Iconography of South Indian goddess
Dear listmembers,
I am in search of an Indian goddess (painting, sculpture) with the 
following iconographic details:
One face and four arms, two arms with the emblems axe (para?u) and cock 
(kukku?a). Two arms without any emblem.
Anyone came across this goddess?
Thank you
Heiner
