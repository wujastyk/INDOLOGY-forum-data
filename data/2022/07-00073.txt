Dr Gansten.
&nbsp;As far as I am aware of the etymology of the word "Tantra" , it&nbsp; implies a set of guidelines/rules. If this connotation of "Tantra" is prefixed before "Pala" in TantraPala , it means the Chief Authority administering a set of rules/ guidelines,. similar to "NagarPala", which is equivalent to City Governor.Regards.

    I wonder if anyone knowledgeable about (north)western India around
    the 13th century might have an idea about how the epithet tantrap?la
    should be understood in that context? I am looking at these two
    verses from an astrological text:

    

    kasya sam?pe candro ravimutha?ilage n?patip?r?ve |

    ?anin? ca mutha?ile ?smin n?c?n?m ijyamutha?ile ca sat?m ||

    ?ukre?a ca yuvat?n?? j?ena vyavah?ripa??it?n?? ca |

    bhaumena &lt;ca&gt; ?atr???? kr?re??n?? ca tantrap?l?n?m ||

    

    'In whose company is the moon? If it forms a mutha?ila [Ar.
    mutta?il, applying aspect] with the sun, [the querent
    travels] at the side of the king; if it has a mutha?ila with
    Saturn, [at the side] of low people, and if a mutha?ila with
    Jupiter, of good people; with Venus, of women; with Mercury, with
    merchants and scholars; with Mars, of his enemies, cruel lords and tantrap?las.'

    

    The standard dictionaries failling me, I did a simple web search,
    which turned up some suggestions; but the present context seems to
    call for something more warlike, violent and/or sinister than just
    'high official' or 'secretary of council'.

    

    Thanks in advance for any thoughts,

    

    Martin Gansten
