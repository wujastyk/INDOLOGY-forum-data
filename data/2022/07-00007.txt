Dear Rich,
The talk alluded to in the Facebook post Madhav appears to be here
<https://www.carc.ox.ac.uk/GandharaConnections/webcasts?fbclid=IwAR1Annmu8GN0F8gkN1BYeB5FPXkXtQk0wQnJNWp8ljuMFEfYi9RwBJUq_NQ>
in
session 5 of the Gandharan Art in its Buddhist Context: international
workshop: Dr Shailendra Bhandare (Ashmolean Museum), and Martina Stoye
(Museum f?r Asiatische Kunst Berlin, SMB, SPK)Indian Dedications at
Berenike on the Red Sea. There's a video available but I have always found
the Gandh?ra Connections website to be very finicky and have not been able
to get it to play on my computer but only on my phone. Hopefully you have
more luck!
All my best,
Charlie
