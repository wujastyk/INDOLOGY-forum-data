Dear colleagues,

Has any virtuous colleague scanned the 2nd edition (1973) or its reprint (1998) of J. Gonda's Sanskrit in Indonesia?

Gonda, Jan. 1973 (repr. 1998). Sanskrit in Indonesia. 2nd ed. ?ata-Pi?aka Series 99. New Delhi: International Academy of Indian Culture.

I am able to find online only a pdf of the first edition.

Thanks a lot!
