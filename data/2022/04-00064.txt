(I now realize that the discussion was about "hi-definition" photographs
from the Rijksmuseum; I guess these would be made available to individuals
on specific terms that the individual would have to assent to, as Dominik
suggests. Still, it would be nice if more institutions followed the
Rijksmuseum's enlightened example in making everything in the public domain
available to the public under non-restrictive licenses.)
