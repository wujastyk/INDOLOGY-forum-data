Subject: [INDOLOGY] seeking article by Prof. Michael Hhn

Dear friends,

The late Prof. Michael Hahn, in the year before his passing, published
??kyarak?ita?s V?ttam?l?viv?ti on J??na?r?mitra?s V?ttam?l?stuti (1), which appeared in the journal South Asian Classical Studies 8 (2013): 265-328.  In that article, he mentions that the second part is planned for publication in the following number of the same journal.
The journal in question is a publication of Kyushu University in Japan, whose title in Japanese is Minamiajia kotengaku. ???????
So far as I have been able to determine, the journal has no online version - searches using its English and Japanese titles have turned up only library entries, mostly in Japan.
Might any of you know if part 2 of Prof. Hahn's article was in fact published and, if so, if a soft copy might be available? I note, by the way, that the late Prof. Hahn's Academia page, which is still online and includes many of his publications, does not include this.
with thanks in advance for your kind responses,
Matthew
