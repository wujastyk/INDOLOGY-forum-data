Dear List Members,
many thanks to all those who have responded to my query so far! I am 
overwhelmed by the very useful replies by Roland Steiner, Paul Hackett, 
Victor Davella, Hannes A. Fellner, Sven Ekelin, Marco Franceschini, Sven 
Sellmer, D?niel Balogh, Eli Franco, and Herman Tieken (in chronological 
order). This is definitely a lot of very useful material I can (start 
to) work with. Thank you! ?
