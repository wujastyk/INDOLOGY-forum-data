Dear Colleagues
A question about XeLaTeX and the font Devanagari MT.
In order to produce Sanskrit editions in devan?gar? script with several
layers of apparatus, I use XeLaTeX.
My font of choice is Devanagari MT, but running XeLaTeX on an input file
that calls this font does not always produce good ligatures.  It sometimes
uses a vir?ma under the first consonant instead of joining it with the
subsequent one.
I have found, with help from Dominic Goodall, the XeTeXglyph numbers for
almost all of the problematic cases.  For example a correct devan?gar? ddva
is produced by typing \XeTeXglyph286.  But these are the remaining
problematic cases I have:
dba
?na
?ga
?ka
Would anyone happen to know what the XeTeXglyph numbers are for these?  Or
know how I could find out?
Yours
Alex
