Hi again,
A further thought: J?va Gosv?min (16th c), at the opening of his
Harin?m?m?tavy?kara?a, says "n?r?ya??d udbh?to'ya? var?akrama?." I have
long suspected that he intended to imply a contrast between the "ordinary"
sequence of sounds, which he says comes from N?r?ya?a, and the sequence
presented by P??ini, which of course gets attributed to ?iva. Again, I can
dig up PDFs of a few editions of J?va's work if needed.
