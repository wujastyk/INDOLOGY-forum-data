Thanks, Madhav.
I have indeed dealt with the use of iti in Sanskrit on several occasions. The best (but still incomplete) account is in the attached paper (two copies, one a scan of the original publication, the other with neater formatting). (Note especially the structures in examples (62) and (73), to which post-Vedic examples with yad ? iti could be added. These structures (and similar ones in Modern Indo-Aryan, e.g. varieties of Marathi) constitute interesting challenges to formal approaches to syntax.)
What is not discussed in that paper is the convention of the Epics not to use iti at the end of a poetic line, except when the passage is a quote within a quote. More work is needed for post-Classical Sanskrit, especially as regards genre differences. It seems to me that iti is used much more strictly in technical literature (such as the Mah?bh??ya) and less strictly in narrative literature (but even in this genre, we may need to distinguish between Epic and Fable genres, and possibly others). It would also be interesting to determine when and where it?ti first occurs (marking a cited form within a quote).
In addition there is the modern use of itika- used frequently to incorporate a foreign noun into Sanskrit discourse, by making the word inflectable according to Sanskrit grammar. Monier-Williams does not list this usage. Is there any evidence for it before the modern period?
So, a fair number of questions remain, and there is room for a lot of additional work.
All the best,
Hans Henrich

If I remember correctly, the possibility of the "iti" constructions being an areal phenomena have been discussed  for many decades. The best person to provide information regarding this topic may be Hans Hock. I will see if I can locate any of these older publications.
