My name is Durga Sethuraman. I am the daughter of late N. Sethuraman
also known as Kudanthai Sethuraman, the renowned archaeologist and
epigraphist of India.
It is with great pleasure that I share with you the website containing
the discoveries and research papers of my father N. Sethuraman
popularly known as Kudanthai Sethuraman. He was an eminent
archaeologist and epigraphist of India. He made breakthrough
discoveries in the history of the Chola, Pandya and Pallava dynasties
of the southern part of India. His famous methodology ?Applied
Astronomy with Reference to Epigraphy? is internationally acclaimed.
He used a multi-pronged approach to fix the dates of several kings of
various dynasties, using the calendar system of India, cross
referencing inscriptions between temples and available Tamil
literature.
Several reputed universities across the world have his books such as
The Cholas, Early Cholas, The Imperial Pandyas and Medieval Pandyas.
This website is a digital library containing his works serving as a
great resource for the researches in the field of archaeology,
epigraphy and Tamil literature. Please share this website in your
