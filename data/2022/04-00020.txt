Dear Diego,
Thank you for your reply and information. Yes, I did indeed have better
luck with access to the S??k?ty?yana collection of photographs of some of
these manuscripts at G?ttingen University. After getting their email
address in reply to my query here of 3/14, I contacted them and got scans
of the photos almost immediately. Their willingness to make these
photographs available and their service in doing so is exemplary.
The situation with the Tucci photographs in Naples seems a little difficult
at the moment.
Regarding the catalogue by Luo Zhao, I had noticed Ernst Steinkellner's
mention of it in *A Tale of Leaves*, then noted as unseen. I did not know
that xeroxes of it were circulating. If you or anyone else here has it, I
would be glad to get either a scan of it or pay for getting photocopies.
Thanks and best regards,
David Reigle
