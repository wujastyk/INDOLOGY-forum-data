Dear Andrea,
     This comes as a shocking surprise. I feel very sad to hear about Tom's
passing. During my early years at the University of Michigan, Tom was a
student of mine at the Department of Linguistics, but he became a longtime
friend. Along with his academic interests, Tom was an excellent Sarod
player, and often played it at our home in Ann Arbor. I have a few
photographs of him at our Ann Arbor home. Around 1978, we had bought an old
house that needed a good deal of work on it. Tom volunteered to help me out
in fixing various things. After he left Michigan, he kept in touch. I am
sad to lose a very good friend. Rest in peace, my friend! ??? ???
