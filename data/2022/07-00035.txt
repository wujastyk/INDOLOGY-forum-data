FYI, the Malay/Indonesian word for army (and soldier) is tentara, an evident loan from Sanskrit tantra. The Indonesian armed forces formed during the Indonesian war of independence are known as Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI). The word is attested already in early "Classical Malay" works such as the Sejarah Malayu, dating from around the 14th c. (Simple search at https://mcp.anu.edu.au/.) If I am not mistaken, the word is not attested in Old Malay, where the word bala tends to be used for "army".

The Malay Concordance Project, Australian National University offers a searchable corpus of over 5.8 million words of pre-modern Malay text.

Anyhow, the spread of the word tantra to Southeast Asia suggests that the meaning "army" must have been rather common in South Asia.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Tantrap?la
Dear Christian,
I'm afraid I can't answer either question at the moment. The
history/etymology of the term was the first thing I wondered about too,
and one may speculate that the underlying idea is line of marching
soldiers stretching out (tan-), but I don't know for sure. Perhaps
others do?
Best wishes,
Martin
