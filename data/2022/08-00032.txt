[INDOLOGY] Sandhi examples in the english language
Dear list members,
Regarding ?Is sandhi expressed in the spelling (and not just the pronounciation) of any non-Indian languages?? 
I came across an example quite similar to Sanskrit sandhi in Japanese place name in Osaka: Tenn?ji << ten ?heaven/deva' + ? ?king/r?ja' + ji ?temple?. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenn?ji-ku,_Osaka)
Best regards,
Tao
