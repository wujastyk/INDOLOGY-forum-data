[INDOLOGY] Kinsley 1997 Tantric Vision of the Divine Feminine
Dear Indologists,
I am looking for the original version of
D. Kinsley, *Tantric Vision of the Divine Feminine: The Ten Mahavidyas*
Published in 1997 by University of California Press
I have the 2008 reprint by Motilal Banarsidass both paper and electronic
version but I need the original edition for a publication on which I am
working on. More specifically, I need to know pages 6 and 47 of Motilal
Banarsidass edition to which pages correspond in the UCP edition.
Anyone can help me?
Sincerely,
Paolo
