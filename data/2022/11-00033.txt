Dear List Members, 
George Hart said: 
/// I am sure many have noted that in Tamil, the word e?, which has equivalents in other Dravidian languages (an in Telugu, for example), is far more productive than Sanskrit iti. It occurs in various forms ? adjective (e??um), adverb (e??u), noun (e?patu), finite verb (e.g. e?ki??rka?), while in Sanskrit iti is only adverbial. It would be interesting to analyze the uses of e? in Sangam literature ? I?m not sure anyone has done this. /// 
Just to kindle your memory ? 
Please look into my book ?A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry, V.S. Rajam, American Philosophical Society, 1992? 
Thanks and regards,
V.S. Rajam
