Bangla has lost the old length distinctions; I suspect some other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages too. There is a good phonological survey by Pramod Kumar Pandey that may offer more information. Unfortunately the reference is not available to me right now. Google might help

Best wishes

Dear list members,
I was asked if all Indian languages (North and South) have vowels differentiated by length.
Thanks,
