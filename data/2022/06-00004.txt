Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce a new publication:

*Piotr Balcerowicz, Agnieszka Kuszewska: Law and Con?ict Resolution in
Kashmir
<https://www.routledge.com/Law-and-Conict-Resolution-in-Kashmir/Balcerowicz-Kuszewska/p/book/9781032048529>.
Routledge, 2022.*

This book provides analysis of the legal status of territories of the
former Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir, considering potential
opportunities for Kashmir conflict resolution.

Containing a detailed survey of relevant legislation and international
documents, chapters throughout this book investigate the attempts and
failures of Kashmir conflict resolution, holding up factors which could
enable more peaceful relations between India and Pakistan with inclusion of
the inhabitants of the erstwhile Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir. The
book goes further than outlining how India and Pakistan determine the legal
status of their portions of Kashmir by demonstrating the complexity of
legal arrangements and why this protracted conflict is so difficult to
resolve. As the Kashmir conflict is not only about territory and
irredentism, themes such as cultural and national identity, power
procurement, territorial security, communal rivalry, religious
radicalisation, economic factors, and social issues are all taken into
consideration.

*Law and Conflict Resolution in Kashmir* will appeal to students and
scholars of peace and conflict studies, international relations,
international law studies, and South Asian studies.

Further details can be found here:
