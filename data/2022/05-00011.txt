To answer my own question about what are "IIIF services" here is the link I
found.
https://iiif.io
" IIIF is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed
digital objects online at scale. It?s also an international community
developing and implementing the IIIF APIs. IIIF is backed by a consortium
of leading cultural institutions".
