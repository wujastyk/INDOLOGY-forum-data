Dear all,
I suddenly realize that because I was answering a message containing 
French, I automatically switched to French in my answer.
Such is the power of mother tongues.
Here is the page scanned from the 1942 edition of V?rac??iyam which 
contains the occurrence of ???? [p??] for referring to DIGIT ZERO in a 
mixed-type representation of number 1,048,576 (i.e. 2^20)
for the sake of those who would want to see it
Best wishes to all
