[INDOLOGY] Ancient wedding vows
Dear Scholars,
Do we have ancient Sanskrit texts with actual wedding vows? Are there specific vows for k?atriyas and br?hma?as?
I?m looking for wedding vows, rather than spontaneous proposals of marriage like these:
MBh CE CE 1.67.3 Du??anta said to ?akuntal?: bh?ry? me bhava, ?Become my wife.? 
MBh CE 1.139.24 Hi?imb? proposed to Bh?ma, saying, among other flattering things, bhajam?n?? bhajasva m?m ? choose/honor/love me who am loving [you].
Again, apart from such spontaneous proposals, are there actual ancient vows at weddings?
Many thanks for any help with this.
Best wishes,
Howard
