I was able to open the link on my phone without any issues and would
recommend this to others (but am getting the same error message when I try
to open the link on my laptop). The argument contains many links and
tables; otherwise I'd copy and paste it here. (But please email me if you'd
like screenshots.)
Tangentially, has anyone been able to download/access the
Gan?ak?s?t??dhy?y? software recently? I remember using it for my PhD, when
I felt it was extremely helpful.
