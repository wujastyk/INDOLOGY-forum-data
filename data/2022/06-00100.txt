[INDOLOGY] Looking for an MA thesis on Konkani
Dear colleagues,
Although I know that most of you on this list work on the older 
languages of India, perhaps one of you might be able to help me locate a 
copy of the following book. The inter-library loan here in Germany 
unfortunately turned up nothing, and my Google search produced the same 
negative result.
Fernando, Stephen. 1972. _Salcete Konkani: A descriptive study of a 
Christian dialect of Goa. _(MA thesis, Poona: Deccan College).
The thesis does not appear to have been published, but it is apparently 
in (private) circulation. Any help will be greatly appreciated!
Best,
John
