Dear Christian,
I recall that Gerard Fussmann had some interesting reflections on the Gilgit manuscripts in this respect, but I cannot locate the reference just now. Perhaps if this jogs the memory of someone else on the list, it can be located.
I do hope that you post the results of this query to the list as a whole - it is a most important topic.
best regards,
Matthew

[INDOLOGY] Premodern Indian libraries and archives
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
on behalf of an MA student I would like to ask whether you can recommend
literature on ancient Indian libraries and archives, their organisation,
structure, storage etc. in courts, monasteries and in private.
Thanks in advance,
