Dear Christian,

I recall that Gerard Fussmann had some interesting reflections on the Gilgit manuscripts in this respect, but I cannot locate the reference just now. Perhaps if this jogs the memory of someone else on the list, it can be located.

I do hope that you post the results of this query to the list as a whole - it is a most important topic.

best regards,
Matthew

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

on behalf of an MA student I would like to ask whether you can recommend
literature on ancient Indian libraries and archives, their organisation,
structure, storage etc. in courts, monasteries and in private.

Thanks in advance,
Christian Ferstl
