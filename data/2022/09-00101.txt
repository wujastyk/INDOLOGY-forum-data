Hi Dean,
In Buddhist contexts, Bhagavan is typically the Lord, the Blessed One, or something similar.
Bhagavat?, as in Bhagavat? Praj??p?ramit?, is usually Blessed or Glorious.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Translation of bhagav?n / bhagavat?
Yes, bhagavan/bhagavati are used to refer to the deity. So in your quote, you could translate it as "goddess", "divinity", "deity" or something similar.
But bhagavan is also used to refer to an honored person. I've never seen bhagavati used in that way, but I don't see why not. I would imagine devotees of one of the many modern woman gurus could use that term.
Best,
Dean
