?Sanskrit-Speaking? Villages, Faith-Based Development and the Indian Census
Over three sections, the 2001 and 2011 Indian censuses are scrutinised to
locate, down to the sub?district administrative and village levels, where
L1?L3 (first to third language) Sanskrit tokens were returned during census
enumeration. First, there is a theo?political discussion of Sanskrit?s
imaginative power for faith?based development. This includes a discussion
on how ?Sanskrit?speaking? villages signify an ambition toward cultural
renaissance. Next, Sanskrit?s national?level enumeration is discussed.
Finally, closer scrutiny is paid to the top four states (Maharashtra,
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh). On average, more Sanskrit tokens
were returned by men than women; 92% of L2?Sanskrit tokens are linked to
L1?Hindi; most L1?L3?Sanskrit tokens cluster with Hindi, English, and/or
the State Official Language; most Sanskrit tokens are Urban, as opposed to
Rural; and most tokens are found across the Hindi Belt of north India.
