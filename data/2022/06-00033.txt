Subject: [INDOLOGY] perfectionism
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrAeiubeNUj4yYKd=4V_3PSGKtVzYq2bQWy-kFMG4tCAqw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Can anyone provide some primary references to the idea of "perfectionism"
or becoming/being "perfect" as some sort of yogic aspiration?

I think about an example such as atisiddhi  (great perfection), or siddhi,
more generally. I'm wondering if other terms come to someone's mind. For
instance, some sort of antonym, like
avadyagohana (concealing imperfection) [RV. i, 34, 3] is interesting.

Thank you.


All the best,
