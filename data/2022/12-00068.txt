Dear Dhavalji,
Thank you for the update.
1)  If at the end of the day, the NMM keeps ignoring the court order in
spite of your non-compliance complaint, is there an enforcement mechanism
the Indian courts can use to compel compliance?
2) I also followed your instructions and also got 27,049 records, but when
I accessed any one of them. There was info and a link but the link did not
download anything.  So I'm not sure if any manuscripts have been put in the
public domain.
Thanks again for your great efforts.
