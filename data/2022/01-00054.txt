Thank you so much for the discussion and for the data that " the word gu?i
is normally used for 'temple' in the early Telugu inscriptions."
However as for the meaning of ko?yilamu in the inscription I referred to,
Budaraju asserts on page 292
<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.493129/page/291/mode/2up?view=theater>
that it means 'Temple' and is a variant of ko?yila, ko?vela.
