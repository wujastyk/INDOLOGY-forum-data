Re: [INDOLOGY] YogVashishthaSara
There are two articles of comparatively recent origin which deal with this subject in desirable detail:
1) 
Stinner, Susanne: S?ras, Sa?grahas und 'Laghus': Kurzfassungen des 
Mok?op?ya, in: The Mok?op?ya, Yogav?si??ha and related texts: (based on 
revised versions of lectures delivered at the "Mok?op?ya Panel" held at 
the 29th German Oriental Conference in Halle), ed. by J?rgen Hanneder. 
Aachen, 2005, S. 91-104.
2) 
Hanneder, J?rgen: The Mok?op?yasa?graha, in: The Mok?op?ya, Yogav?si??ha
 and related texts: (based on revised versions of lectures delivered at 
the "Mok?op?ya Panel" held at the 29th German Oriental Conference in 
Halle), ed. by J?rgen Hanneder. Aachen, 2005, S. 105-112.

Respected Scholars ,&nbsp;Can anyone enlighten me on the authorship or the compiler of the text " YogVashishthaSara", which happens to be a set of preachings rendered
&nbsp;by Sage Vashishtha to his pupil Lord Rama.It is a compendium of interpretations of&nbsp;Adwaitya Vedanta( Absolute Monism).Regards.Alakendu Das.
