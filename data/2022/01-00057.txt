Hello Dominic,
I hope you and Dagmar are well.
I'm writing to ask that you remove me from the Indology mailing list, which
I originally joined because I mistakenly believed that that was necessary
for me to access a document that had been posted on your website by someone
whose name I don't recall. After a month or so of subscription, I have
found that  the interests of the members of the group are far from my own.
Thanks, David
