Dear list,
the pdf of the VOHD Suppl. Bd. 20 Teil 1, that is Vallabhadeva's Kommentar (??rad?-Version) zum Kum?rasambhava des K?lid?sa, ed. Narayana Murti, M. S., & Janert, Klaus L., 1980, given in open access on the website of the Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G?ttingen, is unfortunately non readable (the Nagari has disappeared in this file):

https://rep.adw-goe.de/bitstream/handle/11858/2382/2467_VOHD_Suppl20.1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=yan
An other scan  which was on Archiv is no longer available :

Is there another link or means for catching the book online?
Best wishes,
Christophe
