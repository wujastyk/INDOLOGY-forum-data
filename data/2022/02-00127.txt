Dear Friends and Colleagues,
Thanks to those who already responded.
In the meantime I have been able to solve the issue, and I am sharing this in case somebody else might encounter the same problem.
The important thing is not the font (Gandhari Unicode), but the rendering machine ? Easy Unicode. Once that is properly installed it works, even on OS 11.5.2 (?Big Sur?).
All the best,
HHH
