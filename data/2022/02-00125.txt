[INDOLOGY] Transliteration font for Mac 11.5.2
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
My computer got infected and had to be rebuilt, with an updated version of the Mac OS. 
Problem: The Gandhari Unicode with its rendering machine disappeared. I was able to install the Gandhari font files, but can?t get the font to appear in the list of fonts that is accessed from the top tool bar and I can?t seem to access the required rendering machine. Further, I understand that the font is no longer supported.
Question: Does anyone have a solution to this problem? Specifically, a font that does the same thing as the old Gandhari Unicode? (I have mainly used the sub- or superscript circle, the subscript ?umlaut? (for the retroflex rhotic of Dravidian), and the nonsyllabicity symbol; but would like to also have access to the full range of diacritics.)
Hoping that some of the Indology members can help me and with all best wishes,
Hans Henrich
