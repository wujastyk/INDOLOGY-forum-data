Dear Colleagues,

With apologies for cross-posting and partial self-promotion, please allow
me to
announce the publication of a book edited by Elisabetta Poddighe and
Tiziana Pontillo:
*Resisting and justifying changes: how to make the new acceptable in the
Ancient, Medieval and Early Modern world*, Pisa: Pisa University Press,
2021 (Nuova biblioteca di studi classici e orientali 5).

The articles are divided into three sections:

Four articles in the first section:
- Maria Piera Candotti, Chiara Neri, Tiziana Pontillo
