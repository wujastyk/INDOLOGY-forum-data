[INDOLOGY] Pali: list of most frequent words?
Dear all,
Is there/does anyone have a list of the 500 or 1000 most frequently used
Pali words? The only list of this kind I could find online was what looked
like the English translation of an annotated glossary by Kurt Schmidt ('A
Frequency Dictionary of Pali'); but the English version seems to have many
mistakes, and I cannot find mention of what I assume is the German original
anywhere.
Many thanks, as always,
      Antonia
