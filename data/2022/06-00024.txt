Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pali: list of most frequent words?
Message-ID: <CAEjEOsAWS1j0tNsUjsri9LwsC-mukCn-De0_7aRPda=_FxPW9g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Is there/does anyone have a list of the 500 or 1000 most frequently used
Pali words? The only list of this kind I could find online was what looked
like the English translation of an annotated glossary by Kurt Schmidt ('A
Frequency Dictionary of Pali'); but the English version seems to have many
mistakes, and I cannot find mention of what I assume is the German original
anywhere.

Many thanks, as always,
      Antonia
