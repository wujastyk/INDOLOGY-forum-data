[INDOLOGY] =?utf-8?b?U8SB4bmtaSA9ICdidXNpbmVzcywgY29tbWVyY2Un?=
Samarasi?ha's 13th-century P?cchodde?a (in Sanskrit) repeatedly makes 
use of the word s??i, which from the context clearly means 'business 
dealings, commerce'. This looks like a vernacular borrowing, but I 
haven't been able to identify the source language. Any suggestions would 
be greatly appreciated!
Best wishes,
