[INDOLOGY] Hindi letter for ai
Dear List members,
I like to thank those colleagues who have ? offlist ? supplied me with information about the Hindi pronunciaton of the letter ai.
The question cropped up in connection with an addendum I was writing to an article on the words c??u and c??u in classical Tamil literature which has appeared in the 2016 Festschrift for Sasha Dubiyanskiy. The addendum can be found on my website under the category "articles 2022".
With kind regards, Herman
