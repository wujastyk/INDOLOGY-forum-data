Dear Dr. Ryan,
There are the following works:
-Sub?lopani?advivara?a of Sudar?ana S?ri (ca. 13th century)
- ??opani?adbh??ya of Ved?nta De?ika (ca. 13th-14th century)
- ???v?syopani?advy?khy? of N?r?ya?amuni (2nd J?yar of the Ahobila ma?ha, ca. 15th century)
- M???ukya, ??? and Taittir?ya commentaries by K?ran?r?ya?a (disciple of Ved?nta De?ika, ca.15th century)
- Commentaries on 16 Upani?ads by Ra?gar?m?nujamuni (16th century)
-Taittir?ya Upani?ad Bh??ya by Govind?c?rya (16th century?)
- a commentary on Ved?nta De?ika's ??opani?adbh??ya by Uttam?r V?rar?ghav?c?riy?r (20th century)
to name some of the works I am aware of.
It is evident from this list that the Upani?ads concentrated on, post-R?m?nuja, seem to have been really no more than 3-4 with the ??opani?ad and the Taittir?ya the most important. The former particularly has an intermittent commentarial tradition after Ved?nta De?ika wrote a commentary on it. Finally, we seem to have virtually no Upani?adic commentaries extant between the 17th-20th centuries until Uttam?r Swami who was one of the last living polymaths of the Va?akalai tradition, as far as I am aware. But I am always happy to be enlightened further on this interesting issue.
with kind regards,

[INDOLOGY] Vi?i???dvaita commentary on the Upani?ads
Hi,
R?m?nuja never wrote a work that was a commentary on a full Upani?ad like those of ?a?kar?c?rya. Does anyone know of
Upani?adic commentaries written in the Vi?i???dvaita tradition in either Tamil or Sanskrit? Or published scholarship relating
to same?
Thanks.
