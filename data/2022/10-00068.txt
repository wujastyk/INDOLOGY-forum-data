Dear colleagues,
At the risk of resurrecting an old thread, I've just noticed that
almost none of the book reviews in the Indologica Taurinensia from
Volumes 1-30 seem to be available on the official website or the
archival sites. Am I missing something or is this a lacunae? I know
that not every issue included book reviews but many did. Looking at
Agostini's Index for Volumes 1-10 (pp380-383) there were a significant
number of reviews in the first 10 issues alone which don't seem to be
available electronically - I think...?
Kind regards,
Antonio
