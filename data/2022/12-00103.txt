" Elephants that stood engrossed in hearing the ear-comforting Saamagaanas
by the parrots. Lions that rested below
the trunks of these elephants enjoying the cooling shower from the mouths
of the elephants. Cats and mice
that were playing with each other while eating the rice bowls placed there
as bhuutabali by the sages performing their daily
havanakaarya. Dushyanta, looking at this sahavaasa = living together of
sahajavairi = naturally enemetic animals as the power
of (Ahimsaa ) of Kanva, Dushyanta ......... "
