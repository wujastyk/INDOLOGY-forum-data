[INDOLOGY] FW: Can this be true?
 <811cc43dac2646db964807c164e6709c@hum.ku.dk>
Thanks for sharing this. A great example of close reading, if true. I was
most intrigued by Prof. Vergiani's statement:
"Mr Rajpopat said he had a ?eureka moment? after his supervisor at
Cambridge, Professor of Sanskrit Vincenzo Vergiani, advised him: ?If the
solution is complicated, you are probably wrong.?"
All best,
Arash
