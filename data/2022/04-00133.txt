Dear Arlo,

     As I understand it, kr???a-dvaip?yana is a compound of two words,
kr???a and dvaip?yana. He is called dvaip?yana, since he was born on a
dv?pa "island" in the Ganges from the union of the sage Par??ara and
Matsyagandh?. The word dvaip?yana has the Vr?ddhi of the first syllable as
one sees in many Taddhita formations. It then gets connected to the word
kr???a as two adjectives forming a compound. That is why we do not see the
Vr?ddhi in the word kr???a.
     Best wishes,

Madhav
