Subject: [INDOLOGY] A Burnell item taken down from Archive.org

Colleagues,

The URL I had noted for this item is no longer good:

Burnell, A.C. 1870. A Few Suggestions as to the Best Way of Making and Utilizing Copies of Indian Inscriptions. Madras: Higginbotham. https://archive.org/details/afewsuggestionsastothebestwayofmakingandutilizingindianmanuscriptsburnella.c.1870_191_g/page/n7/mode/2up.

Is anyone able to find it online? If not, does anyone have a pdf?

Thanks.

Arlo Griffiths
