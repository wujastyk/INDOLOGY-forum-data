Dear colleagues,
I don't suppose anyone has a pdf of G. Dum?zil's 1929 book
Le Probl?me des Centaures. ?tude de mythologie compar?e Indo-Europ?ene
that they're willing to share?
Many of his books are available on archive.org<http://archive.org/>, but not this one it seems. I'd be very grateful if anyone can help.
Many thanks!
Robert
