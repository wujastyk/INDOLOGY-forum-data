Dear Indology members
   - I am looking for the earliest epigraphical attestations of Telugu
   *ko?yila*, *ko?vela *'temple' which DEDR lists.
   - DEDR has left out the form *ko?yilamu *attested in an early 10th
   century inscription (p.186)
   <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.493129/page/185/mode/2up?view=theater>
   .
   - The same DEDR entry has interestingly no cognate Kannada words. Is
   this still true?
