Dear Bob, dear Stefan,

My favourite moment in that regard was when Sheldon tried to find a
girlfriend to replace Amy, and one task in the scavenger hunt any
interested candidates had to embark on included a text to be translated
from Klingon into 'ancient Sanskrit'. (09.08 'The Mystery Date Observation')

That our field is notoriously difficult is known even to the Gilmore Girls:
when Lane tries to find a way to meet her beau without her extremely strict
mother noticing, she sums up her mission as ' So I have to figure out a way
to rehearse in Hartford two or three nights a week ? And maybe at the same
time I?ll attempt to master quantum physics, and throw Sanskrit in there,
too.' (3 .4 ?One?s Got Class and the Other One Dyes? )

Apologies, Herman, for a reply that does not answer your question. I would
certainly also be interested in any scholarly studies on this fascinating
term.

All my best,
    Antonia
