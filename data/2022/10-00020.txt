[INDOLOGY] Hindi bookshop in Mumbai
Hello everyone,
I seem to remember that a while ago there was a post about a Hindi-language bookshop in Mumbai. I can't find the thread in the archives.
Does anyone know about such a bookshop?
Any information would be greatly appreciated.
Best regards, Matthew Clark.
