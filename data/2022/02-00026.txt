Dear colleagues,

proposals on the following topics. Please contact the organizing scholar

   - Yoga and psychedelics (Contact: Stuart Sarbacker,
   stuart.sarbacker at oregonstate.edu)
   - Tibetan yoga (Contact: Naomi Worth, nw3ca at virginia.edu)
   - Yoga Bindu, especially as a point of interface between Buddhism,
   Jainism, Hinduism, etc. (Contact: Christopher Chapple,

   - Hindu-Christian relations and Christian-based yoga (Contact: Allyson
   Huval, allysonhuval at gmail.com)
   - A co-sponsored session between Yoga in Theory and Practice and Sikh
   Studies invites presentations that explore the relationship between Sikhi
   and Yogathrough a variety of approaches that may engage topics such as
   colonization, oral and textual knowledge production, lineage transmission,
   hermeneutics, issues of appropriation and abuse, historical figures and
   communities related to Sikhi and Yoga. (Contact: Nirinjan Khalsa,

We are also open to full-panel proposals on any other topic falling under
the purview of Yoga Studies.
