The Department of Asian Studies at UBC, in collaboration with the Yoga Studies Network (UVic) is pleased to present "Traditions of Yoga 2022: A Webinar Series at UBC"

Where did yoga come from? And what is it doing here? These are questions we investigate in a course at UBC titled ?Traditions of Yoga.? As a public extension of this course, we are pleased to invite you to join us on Wednesday afternoons in March and April, as we welcome noted scholars to discuss how and why they study yoga through historical, cultural, and critical lenses. 

	? March 23, 4 PDT: Daniela Bevilacqua (SOAS, London), ?How Sadhus Understand Hatha Yoga?
	? March 30, 4 PDT: Paul Bramadat (Univ. of Victoria), ?Yoga and the Public Square?
	? April 6, 4 PDT: Rumya Putcha (Univ. of Georgia) & Shreena Gandhi (Michigan State Univ.), ?Yoga and Settler Colonialism? 

All events are free ZOOM webinars and open to the public. The sessions will not be recorded.
