Dear Colleagues,
I am writing to you on behalf of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (IASS) to advise you that membership fees are now due for renewal.
We actively encourage you to take out IASS membership for 2022-2023 now, as you will then be eligible to vote in the forthcoming General Assembly meeting, even if you do not plan to be at the Canberra WSC.
As IASS membership is normally included in the WSC registration, if you join IASS now, your WSC future registration will be reduced accordingly.
If you have recently renewed your membership, please disregard this email.
MEMBERSHIP FEES (due by 31 March 2022):
Regular membership:  ?31/US$35/?2500/AUD$50
