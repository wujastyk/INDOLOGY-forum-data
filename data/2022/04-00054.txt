I've just looked at this document from  Nepal Copyright Registrar's Office
http://nepalcopyright.gov.np/downloadfile/Eng_Brochure66Final_1573191647.pdf
which states on page 5.
 " The Copyright Act, 2002 provides the following terms of protection to
the authors/creators of the work:?  . . .Photographic works and applied
arts are protected for 25 years from the year of preparation of the work".
Based on that, NGMPP manuscripts photographed before 1997 would be in the
public domain.
