Dear Jim,
The "standard" ?r?vai??ava commentary on the Upani?ads is by one Ra?gar?m?nuja (as I recall, 17th century, but could not confirm it in a brief search). There is an older commentary by K?ran?r?ya?a (who may have been a student of Par??ara Bha??ar, so, close to R?m?nuja's time) on the M???ukya (and the M???ukya is taken to be both the prose part and the verses otherwise attributed to Gau?ap?da) and, if memory serves right, on the Taittir?ya; there is a commentary on the ??? by Ved?ntade?ika (and I believe by K?ran?r?ya?a too).
No doubt there is more.
Best wishes,
Aleksandar

[INDOLOGY] Vi?i???dvaita commentary on the Upani?ads
Hi,
R?m?nuja never wrote a work that was a commentary on a full Upani?ad like those of ?a?kar?c?rya. Does anyone know of
Upani?adic commentaries written in the Vi?i???dvaita tradition in either Tamil or Sanskrit? Or published scholarship relating
to same?
Thanks.
