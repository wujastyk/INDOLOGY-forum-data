[INDOLOGY] Auspicious numbers in Hinduism
Harry,
Thomas McEvilley in his book, The Shape of Ancient Thought discusses a theory of how a number of the Indian auspicious numbers (including 108) might have been  derived from Sumerian ?Processional arithmetic.? This is in Chapter 3, I think. Especially beginning on p. 293.
