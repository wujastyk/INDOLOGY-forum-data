Prof. Amba Kulkarni wrote some time back on BVP list as follows:
I have seen the use of the word ????? in ??????????? of ??????.
In the shlookas (She corrected Shlookas to Sutras) from 8.28-8.31, he is
describing how to obtain powers
of 2. (2^n in modern notation). The relevant shlokas, their
translation, with an illustration and its equivalent mathematical
expression is given below.
(For more details you may refer to my unpublished paper:
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703658v2)
dvi? arddhe (8.28)
r?pe ??nyam (8.29)
dvi? ??nye (8.30)
t?vadardhe tadgu?itam (8.31)
If the number is divisible by 2(arddhe), divide by 2 and write 2(dvi).
If not, subtract 1 (r?pe), and write 0 (??nyam).
If the answer were 0(??nya), multiply by
2(dvi), and if the answer were 2(arddhe),
multiply (tadgu?itam) by itself (t?vad).
So for example, consider 8.
8
4 2 (if even, divide by 2 and write 2)
2 2 (if even, divide by 2 and write 2)
1 2 (if even, divide by 2 and write 2)
0 0 (if odd, subtract 1 and write 0).
Now start with the 2nd column, from bottom to top.
0 1*2 = 2 (if 0, multiply by 2)
2 2^2 = 4 (if 2, multiply by itself)
2 4^2 = 16 (if 2, multiply by itself)
2 16^16 = 256 (if 2, multiply by itself).
This algorithm may be expressed in modern notation as
power2(n) = [power2(n/2)] ^ 2 if n is even,
= power2(n-1/2) * 2, if n is odd,
= 1, if n = 0.

"In the Chandah-sutra of Pingala, dating perhaps the third or second
century BC, there are five questions concerning the possible meters for any
value ?n?. [...] The answer is (2)7 = 128, as expected, but instead of
seven doublings, the process (explained by the sutra) required only three
doublings and two squarings ? a handy time saver where ?n? is large.
Pingala?s use of a zero symbol as a marker seems to be the first known
explicit reference to zero.
