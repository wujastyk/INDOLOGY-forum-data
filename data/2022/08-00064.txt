[INDOLOGY] vedic revival
Hello Patrick,
The most recent contribution is the excellent volume by Borayin Larios (which began as his dissertation). I will have up-to-date bibliography:

Michael Witzel has written on this, most recently (though based on a 1986 original version in German):
Witzel, Michael. 'Agnihotra Rituals in Nepal', in Richard K. Payne, and Michael Witzel (eds), Homa Variations: The Study of Ritual Change across the Longue Dur?e
, Oxford Ritual Studies Series (New York: OUP, 2016), 371?406. https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199351572.003.0014.
   and

I wrote a couple of pieces on this topic two decades ago.  The bibliography of those will include other relevant publications to that point, especially by Fred Smith:

https://www.academia.edu/408637/Science_Patriotism_and_Mother_Veda_Ritual_Activism_in_Maharashtra
(I also shot video (alas, still only raw footage) of an agnihotra performed in Warje Malwadi, Pune in 2002 or so.)
