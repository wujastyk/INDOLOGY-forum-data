[INDOLOGY] Karl Potter
Thank you for bringing this sad news to the attention of Indology. The Encyclopedia is indeed an invaluable resource. Alas, I only met him once very briefly.

Dear colleagues,
My social media news feed indicates that Karl Potter had passed away. I did find this brief obituary on the University of Washington website:
https://phil.washington.edu/news/2022/01/21/remembering-emeritus-professor-karl-potter
I wish to acknowledge here how much his work has been important for those of us studying Indian Philosophy, and what a marvelous resource he had created in his Encyclopedia.
Yours in sadness,
Aleksandar
