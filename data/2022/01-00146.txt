Thank you for bringing this sad news to the attention of Indology. The Encyclopedia is indeed an invaluable resource. Alas, I only met him once very briefly.

Dear colleagues,

My social media news feed indicates that Karl Potter had passed away. I did find this brief obituary on the University of Washington website:

https://phil.washington.edu/news/2022/01/21/remembering-emeritus-professor-karl-potter

I wish to acknowledge here how much his work has been important for those of us studying Indian Philosophy, and what a marvelous resource he had created in his Encyclopedia.

Yours in sadness,
Aleksandar

The Department of Philosophy is saddened to announce that Emeritus Professor Karl Potter has passed away. Karl joined the Department of Philosophy and the Far Eastern and Russian Institute in 1970, then associated with South Asian Studies. He served as chair of the department from 1986-90 and officially retired in 1997, though he continued to teach for some years afterward.
