Dear Patel-ji,

I suppose you are mainly asking about India-based journals. I believe the journal ?va?am actively publishes Tamil inscriptions, but I am not so aware of that field of Indian epigraphy. I wanted to draw your attention to the journal Pratna Samiksha: a Journal of Archaeology, published by the Centre for Archaeological Studies & Training, Kolkata. I believe that ever since they started a 'New Series' about twenty years ago, every volume has contained a section 'Epigraphy'. The epigraphs that have been published in this venue are mainly from what is now Eastern India (Bihar, WB, Assam, Orissa) and what is now Bangladesh. The language is almost always Sanskrit.

I hope this is useful for you.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

Dear Dr Patel, dear colleagues

I would dare to remind readers of this list that the Indo-Iranian Journal (IIJ) is happy to continue its tradition of publishing works relevant to Indian epigraphy. (As far as I recall,  at least in the past the journal's coverage has been largely limited to Sanskrit and Prakrit epigraphs, but I do not see why South Indian epigraphs could not also be considered.)

This said, the IIJ looks for articles which would place such epigraphs in a meaningful context, and thus are more than what at least some of the ASI publications present, namely raw data as it were, as valuable as such data of course are!

co-editor of the IIJ

There is a "Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India" (vol. 42, 2017) - older issues are available on the website https://epigraphicalsociety.com/

and still the "Annual(s) Report(s) on Indian epigraphy" (e.g. vol. for 2018-18 issued in 2019) published by the ASI
in addition to the current series "South-Indian Inscriptions"  (e.g. vol. 43, 2021) or even "Epigraphia Indica" (there is a vol. 43/1, 2011) both also published by the ASI (not much on their website: https://asi.nic.in/publications/ )

Dear scholars,

I would appreciate if any of the members can point me towards journals which currently publish epigraphs of India. Earlier journals like Indian Antiquary and Epigraphica Indica seem discontinued.

With regards,
Dhaval
