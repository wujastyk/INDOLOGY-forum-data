Dear list members,
I have a related question. In the introduction to the soon to be finished edition of Vidhiviveka, Ny?yaka?ik?, etc., I include an image each from two mss of Ny?yaka?ik? in the Nepal National Archives collection (filmed by the Nepal German project). In an appendix, I include details of six folios to illustrate the reading of a word in one of these manuscripts. I expect the edition to appear as a printed book (not online). I scanned the microfilms, which I received in 1978 and 1980, about ten years ago for personal use in completing the edition. Do I have any legal obligation to get permission from the Nepal National Archives for use of this selection of images, or is this considered a fair use of copyrighted materials? I am of course gratefully identifying the source.
