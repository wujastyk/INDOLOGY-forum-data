This is Google Translator for the first verse of Meghad?ta:
"Someone is neglected by the teacher of separation from his lover:
Shapenastangmitamahima varshabhogyaena bhartu:
The yaksha bathed Janaka's daughter in the holy waters
I lived in the hermitages of Ramagiri among the lush shady trees."
GT could not figure out the long compounds, and "guru" got translated as
"teacher." The syntax of the verse is also missed.
