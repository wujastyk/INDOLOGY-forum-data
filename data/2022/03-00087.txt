Dear Indologists,
Recently I came across this interview of late Dr. R. Nagaswamy by Prof. Bharat Gupt. At timepoint 10:16, I was surprised to hear Nagaswamy?s understanding of the word for the Tamil bard as ?b??a? instead of ?p??a?? (DEDR 4068) and his claim of Sanskritic derivation for that word. ?

I would like to know if any other scholar has offered this etymology. 
Thank you in advance
