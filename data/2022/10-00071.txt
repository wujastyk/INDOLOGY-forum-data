Lucy, the practice of not writing down certain mantras, passing them from
guru to chela orally, and keeping them secret is common in various Hindu
schools especially in certain ascetic and tantric traditions. Other aspects
of their traditions, including histories and practices, are often not
written as well since they may not be meant for outside consumption.
