[INDOLOGY] List of High quality Journals or Patrikas
Dear all
I want to compile a list of high-quality journals, up to 1980.
I have the complete list of the journals which is of no use to me.
I hereby request all the scholars to name the high-quality journals and
please help.
Yours sincerely
Krishna Prasad
