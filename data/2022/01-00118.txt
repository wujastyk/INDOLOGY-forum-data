Subject: [INDOLOGY] List of High quality Journals or Patrikas
Message-ID: <CAODNnZi8sizQXNpa=1g_Djrk+canEB1FOnZD4v_5VVbTv1fFdw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all
I want to compile a list of high-quality journals, up to 1980.

I have the complete list of the journals which is of no use to me.
I hereby request all the scholars to name the high-quality journals and
please help.

Yours sincerely
Krishna Prasad
