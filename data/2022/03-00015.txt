Dear Peter,
I assume that you did not get any positive results from writing to the
Unesco secretary about this manuscript of the *Vimalaprabh?*. Last month I
came across a different Unesco posting about this manuscript (
https://en.unesco.org/memoryoftheworld/registry/468), with a download
"Nomination Form" giving more information about it. That document says:
"The manuscripts have been microfilmed by the Asiatic Society, Kolkata in
1986 and 2008 (microfilm reel no. 86). Recently, the manuscript has also
been scanned by Society with new A2 Faceup scanner in 2009 and scanned
digitized copy is also available for readers."
I wrote to them about this on Feb. 2, and again on Feb. 8, at the two
different email addresses currently given on their website (
theasiaticsociety at gmail.com, gs.asiatic at gmail.com), but did not get a
reply. I am posting this here on Indology in case anyone will be going to
the Asiatic Society in Kolkata in person and can try to get these scans (or
microfilm). No doubt they will be superior to the microfilm I got from them
in 1982, the resolution of which is rather poor. If all else fails, I will
cut up my microfilm and make scans from it.
Best regards,
David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
