Dear Harry,

I do not know about the auspiciousness of 108. However, the 8 in 108 does have a special meaning as it does in 18 (books of the Mah?bh?rata). Following upon 7, which makes a finite, closed list (seventh heaven, seven generations  in some inscriptions), 8 opens it again (with it the speaker/writer indicates that he could easily go on adding to the list). Thus, 8 rasas  ("On the Use of Rasa in Studies of Sanskrit Drama, IIJ 43 (2000), pp. 115-138) and in some Gupta inscriptions the kings are praised in 8 stanzas ("Some Literary Embellishments in the Gupta Inscriptions". ArOr 74/4 (2006), pp. 451-460.

I vaguely remember that Jan Gonda has written about numbers, but am unable to provide a reference.

Kind regards, Herman

Harry,

Thomas McEvilley in his book, The Shape of Ancient Thought discusses a theory of how a number of the Indian auspicious numbers (including 108) might have been  derived from Sumerian ?Processional arithmetic.? This is in Chapter 3, I think. Especially beginning on p. 293.
