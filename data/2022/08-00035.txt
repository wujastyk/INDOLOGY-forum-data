Welsh definitely has sandhi, and it reflects in the spelling. My Welsh is
rudimentary, but an example would be "Cymru am byth" (the Welsh motto
"Wales forever") and "Croeso i Gymru" (on the road signs as one leaves
England and enters Wales, meaning "Welcome to Wales"). The spelling
Cymru/Gymru (Wales) is dependent on the sandhi.
