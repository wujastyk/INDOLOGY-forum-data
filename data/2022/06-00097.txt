Dear Harry,

     Such initiatives were undertaken not only by the GOI, but also by the
various state governments. I went to Marathi medium schools in Pune where
science, physics, chemistry, algebra etc. were all taught in Marathi. In
our Marathi textbooks, we had terms like ????????? [oxygen] in our science
books and ?+?+? in our mathematics. The government of Maharashtra had
published a resource called ???????? to give Marathi equivalents for the
English administrative terms.
