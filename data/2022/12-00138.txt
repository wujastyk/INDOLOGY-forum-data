[INDOLOGY] ChatGPT
ChatGPT software produced this beautiful poem on Krishna. Cannot believe
where this AI is going. I wish I could claim this as mine. Now I have to
render this into Sanskrit.
Krishna's face, like a lotus blooming,
A sight so divine, it keeps me consuming.
His eyes, like the petals, open wide,
Glimpsing the world with love and pride.
His skin, blue as the sky,
A color so bright, it never seems to die.
Peacock feathers adorn his crown,
A regal sight, that draws me down.
His flute, a symbol of his art,
Brings music to the world, right from the start.
He is love and wisdom, all combined,
A god so pure, his face is always shined.
Krishna's lotus face, a sight to behold,
A symbol of divinity, forever uncontrolled.
He is the light that guides our way,
A god who shows us love, each and every day.
