Dear all,
Apologies for fishing again so soon for a pdf, but would someone happen to
have Hikita's translation of the  S?ttvata Sa?hit?, Chapter 12. I was able
to find other chapters (here
<https://bauddha.dhii.jp/INBUDS/search.php?m=sch&uekey=S%C4%81ttvata+Sa%E1%B9%83hit%C4%81+&ekey1=schall&a=>)
but the volume with needed article does not seem to be digitized (see here
<https://bauddha.dhii.jp/INBUDS/search.php?m=mdd&enm=0-00086&a=>). The
reference I have is:
S?ttvata Sa?hit?: An Annotated Translation, Chapter 12. In: Aichi gakuin
daigaku ningen bunka kenky?jo kiy?. Ningen bunka 9 (1994), 190--149 [sic].
All the Best,
Victor
