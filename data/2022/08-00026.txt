Attached to this email is a photograph of the statue in question. It is
solid bronze but neither my employer nor the collector he purchased the
piece from have been able to give any concrete details on it besides that
they believe it to be either a Hindu god or a Bodhisattva. The only
information I have is based on observations of the statue itself:

? It is seated in what appears to be the lotus position
? It has its hair worn up on a top knot behind an elaborate crown.
? It has a symbol emblazoned on its palms that I cannot identify.
