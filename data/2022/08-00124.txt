Dear Itamar
Matthew is correct in pointing to the psychological dimensions of rlung nad in Tibetan medicine. A few more recent references:
Jacobson, Eric. (2002). Panic attack in a context of comorbid anxiety and depression in a Tibetan refugee. Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry, 26, 259?279.

Schrempf (Ed.), Soundings in Tibetan medicine: Anthropological and historical perspectives (pp. 225?245). Leiden: Brill. (Proceedings of the 10th seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies (PIATS), Oxford September 6?12 2003).

Rlung nad in Tibet is both a scholarly category and a colloquial term.  It covers more or less the area of anxiety and depression in Western psychiatry, but also includes physiological aspects and symptoms. There is certainly continuity with the Ayurvedic literature, as well as influence from the Tantric context.

Dear Itamar,
I do not know the Indic sources in this case, but the Tibetan equivalent, rlung nad (lit. "wind disease"), often refers to states of panic, paranoia, hyper-sensitivity, etc. A somewhat popular, but not erroneous, presentation of the issue may be found in Terry Clifford, Tibetan Buddhist Medicine and Psychiatry, pp. 132-136. Those more familiar with medical literature than I am may well have additional suggestions.

[INDOLOGY] Psychological effect of v?ta-do?a
Dear All,
Is anyone familiar with a none physical effect of v?ta-do?a? Dictionaries translate v?ta as gout or rheumatism, but in the context where I found this term, it seems as if it should have a more psychological/mental effect, such as madness or delusion. Any suggestions?
Best,
