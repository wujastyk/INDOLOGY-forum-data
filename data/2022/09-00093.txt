[INDOLOGY] chapter's request
Dear Indologists,
maybe anyone can help with this book's chapter:
Fr ed erique Apffel-Marglin and Julia A. Jean, ?Weaving the Body and the
Cosmos: Yantric Homologies at a Goddess Temple in Northeastern India?, in
Madhu Khanna (ed.), Shaktika on the Ascent: Reframing Gender in the Context
of Culture of India (Delhi: Oxford University Press)
It was quoted in an article of 2019 but I was unable to find the book on
the OUP website... Maybe it is still in the middle of the publication
process. I know that very often the titles are changed during the
publication process, so I would like to know if anyone has any idea if this
volume was published or not.
Best wishes,
Paolo
