Dear colleagues,
I am looking for scholarly resources?books or articles?gathering fragments of/quotation from the lost S??khya work ?a??itantra (supposed it ever existed). I am aware of the early works by Schrader, Frauwallner, Oberhammer, and the recent collection of fragments on perception by Steinkellner (1999), but I haven?t been able to find more comprehensive resources containing all (or most) of the ? original ? passages that have survived to us. Any help would be appreciated.
Best regards,
