This is what the formula I presented at the end shows. From algorithmic
point of view this is a faster algorithm to find 2^n.
If I remember correctly, Prof. Knuth also has mentioned in his book on
Algorithms about this algorithm. Again, since I do not have the book with
me right now, I can not quote.
