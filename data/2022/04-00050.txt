Dear Harry Spier,
I believe you are thinking of the NGMPP and not the NGMCP, which is the
later caloging initiative started in the 2000s. Some years ago while I was
working at BDRC I had attempted to forge some agreement to make the NGMPP
images available online. For example, in Hamburg there is an intranet with
many of these images available to research staff (I'm not sure if this is
the case still). During a trip there, I had a meeting about this where I
laid out my understanding of copyright law, which I understand just as
Jonathan and Stefan have already explained, and was met with polite but
firm disagreement where I was told that it would be absolutely impossible
to make the images publicly available. I looked into the situation with the
National Archives in Nepal and, as Prof. Michaels has suggested, they do
not wish for these images to be freely available. I was told that this may
hypothetically change at some point, but at least five or so years ago it
was impossible. Good luck!
With my kind regards,
Charles
