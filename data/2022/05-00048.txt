Dear All,
Here are a few further experiments that illustrate other issues :
Input: ??????? ????
Output: Truth always triumphs
Input: Truth always triumphs
Output: ????? ??? ??????
Input: ????? ??? ??????
Output: Truth always triumphs
Input: C'est la r?alit? qui triomphe
Output: Reality wins
Input: C'est la r?alit? qui triomphe.
Output: It is reality that triumphs.
(The only difference between the last two inputs is the final period.)
Input: Reality prevails.
Input: La r?alit? l'emporte.
Input: Reality alone prevails.
Output: Seule la r?alit? pr?vaut.
Input: Seule la r?alit? pr?vaut.
Output: Only reality prevails.
And, for fun, Prop. 12.21 from Brahmagupta's Braahmasphu.tasiddhaanta.
Input: ???????? ??????????????????????????????????? 
??????????????????????????????? ????????? ?
Output: The gross fruit is the three-four-arm arm-counter-arm combination team attack.
The subtle step is from the impact of the four and a half arms of the Yoga of the arms.
A correct translation is as follows (the four lines correspond to the four parts of this Arya verse): 
A crude value [indeed] of the area of a triquadrilateral
   Is the product of the half-sums of opposite sides ;
Of a group consisting of four half-sums of the sides, from which
   The sides have been subtracted [in turn], the root of the product is the refined [value].
NB: There are quite a few technical terms here; taking some of them in their ordinary meaning leads to gibberish. "Pada" here is the square root (because the foot of a tree is its root). Yoga is here the sum. "Dala" is the half (literally, "broken (in half)"). A triquadrilateral is the figure obtained from a trilateral by adding a fourth vertex on its circumcircle. Tricaturbhuja is a neologism introduced by Brahmagupta that we translated by a neologism because there is no corresponding notion in English.
Thus, Google Translate seems adequate at the ????? level, but may miss the ???????.
Reverting to general issues from an Indological or mathematical (or computer science) viewpoint, I would suggest offhand the following for discussion:
(i) is the algorithm public or not? (Probably not, but who knows?)
(ii) is there a public algorithm with comparable performance?
(iii) what is the knowledge base (or training set in the sense of neural networks) of known algorithms? 
(iv) a possibly related issue is that there does not seem to be any equivalent for Indian languages of Chinese databases such as ctext.org for instance, that include many tools in addition to searching. For Sanskrit and Tamil, we are grateful to have what you can find on
https://indology.info/external-resources/
including
https://www.projectmadurai.org/ 
http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html  
https://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/indexf.htm 
etc.
For Sanskrit morphology and, to some extent, parsing, the situation is much better : https://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/
But such tools do not seem to have been integrated into other databases (so that, for instance,  hovering the mouse over a word would suggest its grammatical nature, or suggest meanings -- such things exist in Chinese). This may require the text input into the database to integrate a modicum of grammatical analysis and therefore, what amounts to an implicit commentary. This may nonetheless be appropriate for research journals that could provide enriched versions of papers. Automated translation always requires some form of semantic input anyway, except for the crudest examples.
Best regards,
