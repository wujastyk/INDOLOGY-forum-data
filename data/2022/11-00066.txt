Teaching Antiquity
April 15, 2023
Northwestern University Campus
Evanston IL
Northwestern University?s Global Antiquities group invites abstracts for papers to be delivered at a one-day symposium on the topic of ?Teaching Antiquity.? This symposium will bring together instructors with diverse regional specializations to discuss contemporary developments in the teaching of ancient cultures. We invite scholars to reflect on how we teach and display the ancient cultures that we study, from innovating new classroom pedagogies to teaching the past in light of current political and social developments.
Topics may include, but are not limited to:


  *   reflecting on ?antiquity? outside of the Mediterranean
  *   teaching the ancient past in global perspective
  *   teaching ancient languages
  *   digital approaches to the study of antiquity in teaching
  *   teaching sensitive topics from antiquity
  *   contemporary politics and the teaching of the past

In addition to thematically organized panels, the symposium will include:

  *   a special panel on ?Exhibiting as Teaching,? highlighting developments in the curating of the past, and featuring talks by curators from prominent institutions in the Chicago area
  *   an optional visit led by Block Museum curators to Garrett Theological Seminary, where the Egyptian mummy of a young girl is currently on display. A discussion of issues surrounding its past and present display context will follow
  *   keynote address by Professor Yurie Hong of Gustavus Adolphus College.

Open to all scholars with college or museum affiliation. We hope to attract a wide range of perspectives, from scholars of varied backgrounds and ranks. Graduate student submissions are welcome.
Abstracts should be no more than 300 words and should be emailed to blaze at u.northwestern.edu<mailto:blaze at u.northwestern.edu> with the subject "TEACHING ANTIQUITY SUBMISSION" by December 1, 2022. Please include the following:
