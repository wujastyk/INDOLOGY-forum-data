[INDOLOGY] Navagraha miniatures
 <529da0d33920e2d3d297f4adf668b62d@fabularasa.dk>
Many thanks, from Sonja as well, to all who replied so far. Meanwhile, I 
have been told that paintings of the Navagrahas seem to be less common 
than sculptures, so if anyone knows of such paintings, they would be of 
particular interest.
Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
