Hello,
Yes this is still true for Kannada. Usually we use ?devasth?na? which is
clearly of Sanskrit origin and ?devara gu?i.? For some reason that word
didn?t seem to make it in to Kannada from Tamil. I?m not sure about old
kannada, however, I don?t see anything in the Kittel dictionary. Good luck
with the other questions!
Sincerely,
Tejas Aralere
