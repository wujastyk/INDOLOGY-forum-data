Subject: [INDOLOGY] Hindi bookshop in Mumbai
Message-ID: <CAPhjsAeusP4_jyvBUEapOn3qBtgY9UGXjG4xMUBYujXdc9c+-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I seem to remember that a while ago there was a post about a Hindi-language
bookshop in Mumbai. I can't find the thread in the archives.

Does anyone know about such a bookshop?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards, Matthew Clark.
