I'm sorry to harp on about this, but perhaps I was too hasty when I wrote:
I see now that Turner actually suggests pr?hu?a to be the more 
correct/original form, related to the idea of hospitality, with the -gh- 
being a result of influence from a different root. That does seem to 
increase the probability of pr?ghu?aka/-ika being the original word 
after all, used in the sense of 'someone welcome' rather than just 
'wanderer' or (as MW suggests) 'one who goes forth deviously' (!). If 
so, the word must then have been misread as pr?dyu?ika and eventually 
deteriorated into pr?ya?ika, etc.
This solution seems attractive, but it does presuppose that Turner is 
right about the word having connotations of welcome, hospitality and 
even kinship (vernacular meanings include 'bridegroom' and 'daughter's 
husband'). Romain Garnier, in a paper published in JAOS 133.1, seems to 
think so: '[...] /pr?hu?a- /et /pr?hu?aka-/. Ces deux derni?res formes 
sont assur?ment les meilleures [...]'. The solution also seems to 
suggest that the word was unusual enough not to be understood by the 
copyists, at least in some regions.
Best wishes,
