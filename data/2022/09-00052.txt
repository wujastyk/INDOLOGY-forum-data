*Collections and Communities*

In this talk, Dr. Adrian Plau will reflect on two themes that have
interlinked throughout his career and now are central to his work:
collections and communities. Drawing a line from his PhD project, which
focused on manuscripts accessed in Jain temple libraries across North
India, to his present role in the gallery, library, archive, and museum
(GLAM) sector where he is part of the management and cataloguing of
Wellcome Collection?s manuscript collections, he will situate these themes
in his ongoing Headley Fellowship with the Art Fund, which seeks to develop
a model for manuscript repatriation driven by collections information work
with Wellcome Collection?s Jain manuscripts.

*Dr. Adrian Plau* is Manuscript Collections Information Analyst at Wellcome
Collection, working particularly with making the Collection?s global
manuscripts more accessible and discoverable to wider audiences.
