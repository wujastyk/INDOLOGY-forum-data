Dear Fran?ois,
There is a recent article by Martin Joachim K?mmel: Agricultural terms in Indo-Iranian. It was published as chapter 12 in Language dispersal beyond farming, ed. by Martine Robbeets and Alexander Savelyev, John Benjamins Publishing, 2017.
The attached is a copy of the handout, available from Research Gate.
I hope this helps.
Best wishes,
Hans Henrich

Dear All,
Is there any comprehensive and up-to-date study on the edible cereals in the Veda: vrIhi, yava, godhUma, priaGgu, etc.?
If so, can someone send me copies of this/these study/ies?
Thanks in advance.
