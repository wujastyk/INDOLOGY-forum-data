Dear Fran?ois,

There is a recent article by Martin Joachim K?mmel: Agricultural terms in Indo-Iranian. It was published as chapter 12 in Language dispersal beyond farming, ed. by Martine Robbeets and Alexander Savelyev, John Benjamins Publishing, 2017.

The attached is a copy of the handout, available from Research Gate.

I hope this helps.

Best wishes,

Hans Henrich

Dear All,

Is there any comprehensive and up-to-date study on the edible cereals in the Veda: vrIhi, yava, godhUma, priaGgu, etc.?

If so, can someone send me copies of this/these study/ies?

Thanks in advance.

Fran?ois Voegeli
