V.S. Rajam?s book is an essential one for students of classical Tamil, covering syntax, meter, morphology, etc. What I meant is that to my knowledge no one has made a substantial study of every use of e? in Sangam literature. Such a study might include uses of iti in early Sanskrit. For example, in modern Tamil we often find ?? e???l, ?If you ask why,? which corresponds exactly to Sanskrit "kuta iti cet.? One wonders how old this usage is in both languages. George Hart
