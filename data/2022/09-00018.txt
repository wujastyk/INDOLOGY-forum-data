Subject: [INDOLOGY] IASS Honorary Research Fellowship for 2023
Message-ID: <CAArHMvA0virZoxre96kLcgM59vR58AwDaWgMy_QHxCazdyO7mw@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear Colleagues,
The IASS (International Association of Sanskrit Studies) initiated this
Fellowship in 2019 and it is a pleasure now to be able to announce it again
for next year, 2023.
Any paying member of the IASS is eligible for the HRF, if the scholar has
received a PhD in Sanskrit or allied studies in the last five years.

The HRF is for research work to be conducted in South Asia for a period of
at least two weeks in any field related to Sanskrit and allied studies. *If
travel in 2021 becomes impossible because of Covid-19, an alternative may
be proposed, for example, an online conference with experts in India in the
chosen field.*

The Honorary Research Fellowship, valued at 1000 Euros, will be announced
annually, providing the IASS budget is able to sustain the expense.

The DEADLINE for the written project proposal is 31 DECEMBER 2022. Please
submit proof of IASS membership for this year 2022: scan of email or
receipt from the Treasurer of the IASS.

Please send all proposals and/or queries to Associate Professor McComas
Taylor of the IASS:
McComas.Taylor at anu.edu.au
