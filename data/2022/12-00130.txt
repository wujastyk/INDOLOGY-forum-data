Dear Jan,
The malware issue is real, my computer was infected with a Trojan by installing the Gangakashtadyayi software.
I trust it is a very useful program, but not before this issue is resolved.
Best wishes
Aleksandar

Dear All,
Dr Shivamurthy Shivacharaya's reaction and refutation of the unsubstantiated claim that an old puzzle is solved is of special importance because it is backed up by all derivations  (prakriy?) generated by his Ganakashtadhyayi software. The derivation of 'guru??' and ?mantrai??, discussed by Dr Shivamurthy Shivacharya, are not given in the thesis, but at https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/solving-grammars-greatest-puzzle<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cam.ac.uk%2Fstories%2Fsolving-grammars-greatest-puzzle&data=05%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7C93a32ae3510a42b1576b08dae9ffa088%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C638079581388441448%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=0axjQe%2BbX3wuWWA1TVGMlRJJcLXkM%2BCswEsMzbDC5og%3D&reserved=0> in the style of the In Panini We Trust thesis. Dr Shivamurthy Shivacharya shows how these forms can be conveniently derived and cites the rules involved in their derivation following the traditional trimuni framework.
As for the "malware" warning: leaving out the underlying technical aspects, the only problem with this website and the link is that it still has an http:// address, if it is upgraded to an https:// address there would be no problem and no "malware" warning from your Antivirus. Although http:// addresses are indeed vulnerable for hacks etc. they are not necessarily by themselves malware and in this case I think it would not be entirely irresponsible to give it a try, with all due caution, and open the site (and if that goes well, install the Ganakashtadhyayi software).
With best regards,
Jan Houben

Oh! My sincere apologies for that. (I didn't know about this before ? perhaps because I haven't used Windows computers in years.) I will have to report this to the swami.
