  Dear all,

  Thanks to all those among you who kindly replied to my query, on- and
off-list. Now I have much more to tell my students about *k??iy???a?*! (and
am once again reminded of what a wonderful and supportive resource INDOLOGY
is: as usual, thanks to Dominik for having created and maintaining it!)

  *namaskaromi*,
