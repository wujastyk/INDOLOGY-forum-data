  Dear all,

  I congratulate the authors on this useful publication, but would like to
add a small mini op-ed of sorts.
  Young and small as the field of Gandh?ran studies is, it has been crucial
for indology and buddhology in the last few years on account of its
paradigm-shifting discoveries. Gandh?ra has elicited interest even among a
general public in recent years and shows great promise as a field of
investigation.
  What exactly is then the point of sprouting many alternate versions of
the features that Stefan Baums and Andrew Glass' online repository,
gandhari.org, has been offering, to great benefit of our community, already
for more than a decade? Certain features in this new presentation of the
text such as the *ch?y?*, the English translation, and the gloss of certain
technical terms are extremely useful, but wouldn't the most fruitful course
of action be to incorporate these features to the gandhari.org entry (
https://gandhari.org/corpus/ckm0244), which has been in place since 2016?
  My point is only an invitation to collegiality and to collaboration. It
would be a pity if our collective effort to unveil the rich treasures of
Buddhist Gandh?ra was splintered rather than sharpened by our individual
initiatives.

  *nama?aro karemi*,

  Diego
