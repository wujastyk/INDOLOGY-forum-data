I  well be  wrong (it happens alarmingly often) but my sense is that the
P?li term generally (always?) refers to fortune telling and the like,
although I could see that this might in some ways bleed into "witchcraft"
for some. But in India there are certainly ideas about beings who
manipulate reality in other ways ("sorcerers") and I do not think that this
is to be connnected with tiracch?navijj?.
