Dear all,
Namaste!

Greetings from the Amrita Darshanam, ICSS!

Amrita Darshanam-ICSS Bengaluru campus-Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, in

the basic philosophical doctrines of the ?aivasiddh?nta system through a
detailed reading of the section known as the vidy?p?da of the
Siddh?ntas?r?vali.

Following are the details of the workshop.

Venue: Conference Hall, Ground Floor, A Block, Amrita School of
Engineering, Kasavanahalli, Bengaluru - 560035
