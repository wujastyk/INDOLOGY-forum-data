[INDOLOGY] Uttungodaya
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone happen to have a scan of Uttu?godaya's Dhvanyalokalocanakaumud? that extends beyond the first uddyota? Or does anyone know if the later parts of the texts were ever, in fact, published? The version on archive.org, which was edited by Kuppuswami Sastri, and an alternative, newer version I found edited by C.M. Neelakandhan both seem to contain only the first uddyota. Was the rest of the text ever published? Or are the editions just very hard to find?
Best,
James Reich
