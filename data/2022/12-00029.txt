Dear John,

     I have attached an article of mine that may be of interest to you. You
may also find some interesting material in Stephen Levitt's work on the
Sahy?drikha??a:

https://www.worldcat.org/title/patityagramanirnaya-a-puranic-history-of-some-brahman-communities-includes-introduction-the-text-of-patityagramanirnaya-sahyadrikhanda-skandapurana-translation-and-critical-apparatus/oclc/981898691

Also Urmila Patil's dissertation [2008] from the University of Texas deals
with the accounts of communities in Goa and the Konkan region.

Best wishes,
