Dear John,
     I have attached an article of mine that may be of interest to you. You
may also find some interesting material in Stephen Levitt's work on the
Sahy?drikha??a:

Also Urmila Patil's dissertation [2008] from the University of Texas deals
with the accounts of communities in Goa and the Konkan region.
