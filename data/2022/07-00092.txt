Dear Ram-Prasad,
To piggy-back on Matthew Kapstein's reference to *hr?* and *apatr?pya* in
the abhidharma/abhidhamma, there are two texts bearing the title in *Hiri
Sutta* in the Pali canon: SN 1.18 and 2.3. Their usefulness to your
colleague might be limited as they are both quite short, but they are still
worth mentioning as part of the broader Buddhist discourse on hr?/hiri.
