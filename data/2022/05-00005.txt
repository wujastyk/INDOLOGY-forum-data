I can personally attest to how useful Dominik's archive.org reviews are! 
They've saved me a lot of work in the past.
What's more, with the IIIF service that archive.org provides, together 
with the open source tools we're putting together as part of the Texts 
Surrounding Texts Project, you can easily put together your own 
descriptive catalogue of material on archive.org. Here is a detailed 
catalogue entry I just made, of a digitized manuscript from Shri Lal 
Bahadur Shastri National Sanskrit University:

There is really a lot of material out there now, it's pretty great!
PS Thanks for bringing up this topic, giving me a chance to advertise...
Best,
Charles
