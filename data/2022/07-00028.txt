[INDOLOGY] Muktabodha digital library search function and google
 chrome
Dear list members,
Google chrome has recently changed its default behavior and this has
affected the search function of the Muktabodha  digital library (at least
on my computer).
When you use the search engine of the Muktabodha searchable etext
collection this opens a new tab to post the results but it appears that the
default behavior of google chrome now blocks this. If your google chrome is
set to allow pop-ups then you don't need to make any changes.
Otherwise if this occurs on your computer,  do the following.
In google chrome:
1) click on the three dots in the upper right hand corner.
2) click on settings
3) click on privacy and security
4) scroll down to "site settings" and click on it.
5)scroll down to "pop-ups and redirects" and click on it.
6) scroll down to "allowed to send pop-ups and redirects" and click on "ADD"
7) In "Add a site"  add muktalib7.com
This should fix the problem.
