Respected Scholars ,&nbsp;Can anyone enlighten me on the authorship or the compiler of the text " YogVashishthaSara", which happens to be a set of preachings rendered
&nbsp;by Sage Vashishtha to his pupil Lord Rama.It is a compendium of interpretations of&nbsp;Adwaitya Vedanta( Absolute Monism).Regards.Alakendu Das.
