Dear Colleagues,

We are seeking applicants for the role of Book Review Editor for the Journal
of Hindu Studies <https://academic.oup.com/jhs>, published since 2008 by
Oxford University Press. Interested applicants may send a letter of
interest and C.V. to JHS at ochs.org.uk by 1 March 2022.

The Journal of Hindu Studies is committed to a critical approach to Hindu
Studies, focusing on themes that address overarching issues within the
field, publishing the proceedings of research projects and conferences, and
providing a forum for peer-reviewed articles. The journal aims to create a
forum for constructive interdisciplinary discourse by linking the wider
community of scholars in an exploration of key questions through the lens
of their own research.

With best wishes,

The JHS Editorial Team
