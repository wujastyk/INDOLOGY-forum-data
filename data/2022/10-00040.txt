[INDOLOGY] New Explorations in South Asia Research (NESAR): An
 open-access journal of South Asian Studies
Dear colleagues,
I am writing to let you know of the "soft launch" of a new open-access
journal. It is called NESAR (from ?????, a Kannada word meaning "sun") and
stands for *New Explorations in South Asia Research*. We are still working
hard on the first issue, which will come out early next year, and there are
a few features of the website that will be rolled out soon. But in the
meantime ? and especially in advance of this year's Annual Conference on
South Asia at Madison ? I wanted to let everyone know of its existence and
encourage you and your colleagues to think about NESAR as a possible venue
for your work in the future. Here is the journal website:
https://nesarjournal.org/
And here is a short article describing the new journal, its motivation, and
the principles guiding it:

If you have questions or comments, please feel free to write to me, or
write to the journal at nesar at nesarjournal.org. With all best wishes,
including for a freer and more accessible future,
Andrew Ollett
