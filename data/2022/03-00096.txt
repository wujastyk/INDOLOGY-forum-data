Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] YogVashishthaSara

As far as I know, all the Yogav?si??has (including the S?ra and Laghu) are considered to be 'R?m?ya?as' and as such are ascribed to V?lm?ki (the same way as the Mah?bh?rata is traditionally ascribed to Vy?sa).

There are two articles of comparatively recent origin which deal with this subject in desirable detail:
1) 
Stinner, Susanne: S?ras, Sa?grahas und 'Laghus': Kurzfassungen des 
Mok?op?ya, in: The Mok?op?ya, Yogav?si??ha and related texts: (based on 
revised versions of lectures delivered at the "Mok?op?ya Panel" held at 
the 29th German Oriental Conference in Halle), ed. by J?rgen Hanneder. 
Aachen, 2005, S. 91-104.


2) 
Hanneder, J?rgen: The Mok?op?yasa?graha, in: The Mok?op?ya, Yogav?si??ha
 and related texts: (based on revised versions of lectures delivered at 
the "Mok?op?ya Panel" held at the 29th German Oriental Conference in 
Halle), ed. by J?rgen Hanneder. Aachen, 2005, S. 105-112.



Kind regards,Walter Slaje

Respected Scholars ,&nbsp;Can anyone enlighten me on the authorship or the compiler of the text " YogVashishthaSara", which happens to be a set of preachings rendered
&nbsp;by Sage Vashishtha to his pupil Lord Rama.It is a compendium of interpretations of&nbsp;Adwaitya Vedanta( Absolute Monism).Regards.Alakendu Das.
