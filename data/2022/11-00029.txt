[INDOLOGY] iti in Sanskrit
 <833F1614-E6E1-4793-9BF0-31C72FEB166A@austin.utexas.edu>
If I remember correctly, the possibility of the "iti" constructions being
an areal phenomena have been discussed  for many decades. The best person
to provide information regarding this topic may be Hans Hock. I will see if
I can locate any of these older publications.
