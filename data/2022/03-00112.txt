Dear Asko,

 

Thank you for your comments. 

 

A twelfth-century inscription in the Tiruvi?aimarut?r temple (South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. 5, no. 705) discusses an order by C??a Kulottu?ga II to appoint a P??a? to sing before the deity, appoint other P??ar, and train two classes of temple women to sing. In Nagaswamy?s Mirror of Tamil and Sanskrit (pp. 373-74), he says, ?A new service was started in the temple of Thiruvidaimarud?r creating an enactment for singing the Thirup-padiayams [sic] and also arranging for the dancing girls of the temple to sing in the 9th year of Vikramachola, the son of Kulottunga II. The service was called ?B?nap-peru? (B?nap-pani). This was a royal appointment issued by Vikkramachola [sic] and a certain Irumudi Cholan alias Acancala Peraraiayan [sic] was appointed to do the service...The record states that he was to sing in the presence of God of the Thiruvidaimarud?r temple and direct other B?nas for arranging the Dancing girls to sing (Thiruvidai marudur ? udaiy?rukku - p?davum, ikkoyil Taliyil?rai p?duvikkavum ikkoyil Devaradiy?rai p?duvikkavum B?napper?ka). The B?nas were great singers from the Sangam age and we find the B?nas, Y?lp?na was a close friend of Jn?na-sambandar and again we find the B?nas were appointed in the Great temple of Thanjavaur [sic]. According to this inscription the service should be added to the temple service and the B?na should be paid one kalam of paddy per day to the Perariayan [sic] for singing. He should be allotted one residence as B?nak-kudiyiruppu as before.? 

 

I thought Nagaswamy?s use of B??a was just a case of hypercorrection. Now, I see that he had a deeper Sanskritic etymological bias. Since he taught epigraphy to many young students in the 1970s, Nagaswamy?s influence can be seen in some of his students? works. An example is epigraphist P. Venkatesan?s statement regarding the word ?Pa????u? (oblique form of P????u) occurring in the Pa?aiya?pa??u inscription (Epigraphia Indica, vol. 42, p. 175). Venkatesan says, ?The territorial division viz., P????u, is in all probability, the same as B????u i.e., the n??u of the B??as.? (emphasis mine) The form ?B???du? does not occur anywhere, but the Sanskrit equivalent of P????u occurs as P??ar???ra in the Lokavibh?ga, a Jain Sanskrit text (ca. 6th century CE).

 

Regards,

The Sanskrit word meant by Nagaswamy should be (instead of b??a- ?arrow?) v???- ?sound, voice, music?, attested since the Rigveda, but according to Mayrhofer without a good etymology. A look at DEDR 4068 suggests that Tamil p?? ?song, melody? etc have a good Dravidian etymology, which could explain Sanskrit v??a.

 

Best wishes,  Asko Parpola

Dear Indologists,

 

Recently I came across this interview of late Dr. R. Nagaswamy by Prof. Bharat Gupt. At timepoint 10:16, I was surprised to hear Nagaswamy?s understanding of the word for the Tamil bard as ?b??a? instead of ?p??a?? (DEDR 4068) and his claim of Sanskritic derivation for that word.

I would like to know if any other scholar has offered this etymology. 

 

Thank you in advance

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
