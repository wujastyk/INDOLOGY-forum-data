Dear list members,
Does anyone have a pdf of

* Kum?rasa?bhava with a sanskrit commentary by S. D.
Gaiendragadkar,translation and notes by R.D. Karmarkar. Bombay 1923*

I couldn't find this on archive.org. The notes section only is on
sanskrit.org.  Its the edition by R D Karmarkar I need not the edition by M
R Kale.

Also does anyone know why google books no longer makes available out of
copyright books for download.  Years ago if I searched for out of copyright
sanskrit books on google books, many (but not all) were downloadable. Or
are they downloadable in the U.S.A. but not outside.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
