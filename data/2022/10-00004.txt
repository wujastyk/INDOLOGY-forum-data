Vedic ??kh?s
Past, Present, Future
by
Jan E. M. Houben, Julieta Rotaru & Michael Witzel *(Editors)*
The 41 papers in the present volume by Vedic scholars from Europe (Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Switzerland,
U.K.), from the U.S.A., from India and from Japan, contribute to ?the study
of a civilization based on its texts? ? the brief de?nition of philology
given in Michael Witzel?s Introduction to the *Proceedings of the First
International Vedic Workshop* edited by Michael Witzel (1997). The papers,
although many may cover more than one ?eld or topic, are placed in three
broad categories. The second category is further divided Veda-wise.
 1) GENERAL STUDIES AND TOPICS ON ??KH?S: twelve papers in connectionwith
the theme of the conference, *Vedic ??kh?s: past, present, future*;
 2) Twenty-three SPECIFIC STUDIES ON ??KH?S: five on ?g Veda, ten on Yajur
Veda, three on S?ma Veda, ?ve on Atharva Veda;
 3) LINGUISTIC STUDIES: six studies on linguistic issues in connection with
the Vedas and the Vedic ??kh?s.
