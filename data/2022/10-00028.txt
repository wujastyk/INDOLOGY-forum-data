[INDOLOGY] Bhujimol script
Thanks to all who responded to my query about Bhujimol.
I think I now have most of the resources that are available.

[INDOLOGY] Bhujimol script
Dear friends,
Might any of you be aware of anything particularly good on the evolution of the Bhujimol script, used mostly in the Kathmandu Valley.? There are several examples in the excellent indoskript.org database, but I do not see a way to search there for just the Bhujimol manuscripts in particular. (Perhaps there is, in which case I would be delighted to be enlightened about just that.)
Your kind advice would be most welcome.
best to all,
Matthew
