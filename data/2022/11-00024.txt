Theme: Topics in Indian Philosophy: Perception, Logic, and Embodiment

Saturday, 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM

Hyatt Regency-Capitol 2 (Fourth Level)



Lynna Dhanani, University of California, Davis, Presiding



This session brings together three papers on diverse topics from across a millennium of Indian philosophy. The first paper discusses the relationship between philosophy of language and philosophy of perception in the works of Ma??ana Mi?ra (8th c.), focusing on his distinctive claim that error leads to truth. The second offers an analysis of ?r?har?a?s (12th c.) view of tarka (?suppositional reasoning?) and its relevance to theory choice, arguing that ?r?har?a should not be read as a skeptic. The third paper draws attention to the epics as sites for theological discourse, focusing on early modern (17th and 18th c.) Ved?ntic commentaries on the R?m?ya?a and Mah?bh?rata and their treatment of divine embodiment.

Theme: Kum?rila on the Intrinsic Validity of Cognitions: A Philosophical Roundtable
Sunday, 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM
Hyatt Regency-Granite C (Third Level)

Parimal G. Patil, Harvard University, Presiding

What makes a cognition valid, justified, or true? This roundtable will focus on one of the most important treatments of this question in classical Indian philosophy: Kum?rila?s argument for svata?-pr?m??ya, or the ?intrinsic validity? of cognitions, at ?loka-v?rttika II.33-61. Participants will explore and debate the merits of several different interpretations of Kum?rila?s argument by later M?m??sakas as well as by Ved?ntins. The goal of this format is to create a space for lively and rigorous discussion, rather than traditional paper presentations. A handout with the original Sanskrit and an English translation of selections from Kum?rila?s text will be provided.

A21-416
Co-sponsored session: Hindu Philosophy Unit and Sikh Studies Unit

Theme: Roundtable on Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair's Sikh Philosophy: Exploring Gurmat Concepts in a Decolonizing World (Bloomsbury, 2022)
Monday, 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM
Convention Center-301 (Street Level)

Puninder Singh, University of Michigan, Presiding

Sikh philosophy has typically, when it has been discussed at all, been subsumed within the ambit of area studies or religious studies. More particularly it has usually only been discussed in the context of other religions/philosophies of South Asia, especially the Vedic/Hindu or the Sufi. This roundtable aims to bring together a group of scholars to discuss a new book on Sikh Philosophy that addresses this lacuna by going beyond its usual confines of area studies or solely religious studies paradigms. Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair?s Sikh Philosophy: Exploring gurmat Concepts in a Decolonizing World (Bloomsbury, 2022) aims to bring Sikh philosophy into engagement with a wider sphere, that of global philosophies. Sensitive to both the historical formation of Sikh thought, and to the decolonial context, the book examines some of the key concepts of Sikh philosophy and how they inform its vision of life.
