Dear Philipp,
I've signed and shared your email. I was asked: what should people do who
do not have a google account and thus cannot sign in to google docs? Should
they contact you (or possibly someone else?) directly so that you can add
their names to the list?
Thanks, and all my best,
    Antonia
