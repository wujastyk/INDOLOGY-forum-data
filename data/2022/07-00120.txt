Dear Harsha,
I don?t know if a direct link can be demonstrated , but it is notable that, in their cosmological speculations, Adhidharma texts and Mah?y?na s?tras seem also to have become fascinated with large multiples of 10, such as the famous Trisahasra-mah?sahasra, 1000 cubed. The mathematical discovery of how much could be made out of nothing perhaps played a role here.

Friends:
Is there any evidence that the sunya of mathematics arose out of the sunyata of Mahayana Buddhism?
Kind regards,
Hrtsha
