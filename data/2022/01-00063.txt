[INDOLOGY] biphasic sleep in Ancient India?
Dear Colleagues
I just read an interesting article:
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep
this led me to wonder whether anyone has run across any indications in Skt
(or Tamil) literature of this so-called biphasic sleep.
Best thanks in advance,
