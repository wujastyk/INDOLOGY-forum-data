Dear Harry,
I ordered and paid for ms microfilms of National Archives mss microfilmed by Nepal-German project around 1978. I remember the National Archives stated a condition that restricted publication of the mss. I don?t remember if I signed agreement to these conditions, or if they were stated in the fulfillment of my request. I most likely have the papers in my office. Of the copies of microfilms of three Ny?yaka?ik? mss I requested then, I am using only one in the edition I expect to submit soon for publication. I received the other National Archives microfilm of a fourth Ny?yaka?ik? from Berlin around 1980, but with a note that they were not confident they were legally authorized to provide it. I intend to request permission to use the two mss per the guideline Roland provided.
Copyright law should not apply to the ms images. The images are not an artistic creation subject to copyright, and the authorial rights for the texts in the mss predate the copyright concept and copyright law. Copyrights protect the intellectual property rights of the creators of original artistic, literary, etc., materials. They do not protect the rights of copyists and scribes, or the reproduction of their products.
In short, my take is that the Government of Nepal have always asserted contractual rights.
