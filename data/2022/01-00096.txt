[INDOLOGY] Colour Maps -- Tarim Basin + Hindu Kush
Dear colleagues,
 ?
We are needing a colour map of the Silk Road route for the following:
 ?
Sander, Lore & Dietz, Siglinde (forthcoming) ????n???ya- and ????n??ikas?tra:
S?tra for protecting monks and nuns in the ?wilderness. Oxford: Indica et Buddhica.
 ?
https://indica-et-buddhica.org/publications/sander-lore-dietz-siglinde/atanatiya-and-atanatikasutra
 ?
 ?
The coverage should be roughly equivalent to these two images combined:
 ?
Winter and Summer in the Tarim Basin
https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/51678/winter-and-summer-in-the-tarim-basin/51678f
 ?
https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/51000/51678/tarim_tmo_2011218_lrg.jpg
 ?
The Hindu Kush
https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/69524/the-hindu-kush/69526l
 ?
https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/69000/69524/Tajikistan.A2003332.0610.250m.jpg
 ?
 ?
We would prefer not to use one of Stein's maps:
 ?
Stein, M. A. (1921) ?Serindia: detailed report of explorations in Central Asia
and westernmost China / Aurel Stein; descriptive lists of antiques by
F.H. Andrews ... [et al.], v. 5: Maps. Oxford: Clarendon.
 ?
 ?
The IDP site has been checked for an alternative but "Map Search" does not
seem to be currently available.

 ?
 ?
Does anyone know of a map that might be suitable?
 ?
 ?
Best, Richard
