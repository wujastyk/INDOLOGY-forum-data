Subject: [INDOLOGY] Colour Maps -- Tarim Basin + Hindu Kush

  

Dear colleagues,

 ?

We are needing a colour map of the Silk Road route for the following:

 ?

Sander, Lore & Dietz, Siglinde (forthcoming) ????n???ya- and ????n??ikas?tra:

S?tra for protecting monks and nuns in the ?wilderness. Oxford: Indica et Buddhica.

 ?

https://indica-et-buddhica.org/publications/sander-lore-dietz-siglinde/atanatiya-and-atanatikasutra

 ?

 ?

The coverage should be roughly equivalent to these two images combined:

 ?

Winter and Summer in the Tarim Basin

https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/51678/winter-and-summer-in-the-tarim-basin/51678f

 ?

https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/51000/51678/tarim_tmo_2011218_lrg.jpg

 ?

The Hindu Kush

https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/69524/the-hindu-kush/69526l

 ?

https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/69000/69524/Tajikistan.A2003332.0610.250m.jpg

 ?

 ?

We would prefer not to use one of Stein's maps:

 ?

Stein, M. A. (1921) ?Serindia: detailed report of explorations in Central Asia

and westernmost China / Aurel Stein; descriptive lists of antiques by

F.H. Andrews ... [et al.], v. 5: Maps. Oxford: Clarendon.

 ?

 ?

The IDP site has been checked for an alternative but "Map Search" does not

seem to be currently available.

 ?

http://idp.bl.uk/maps/map_search.a4d

 ?

 ?

Does anyone know of a map that might be suitable?

 ?

 ?

Best, Richard

 ?
