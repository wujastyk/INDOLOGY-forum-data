Subject: [INDOLOGY] Arsagranthavali 1912 Samkhya publication
Message-ID: <CAPAZekab9YGCC+rFqHZw7zmALB0_h2i=kWr=ND3o8RCj-ETuHA@mail.gmail.com>

Nandalal Sinha in his 1915 book, *The Samkhya Philosophy*, on the first
page of the last appendix, "Panchasikha-sutram," refers to a Samkhya
publication prepared by Raja Ram and published in the series,
Arsa-Granthavali (Lahore), Vol. VIII, nos. 4 and 5, 1912. I cannot find
this publication listed in WorldCat, or a scan of it at Archive.org. I was
only able to find this reference listing:

https://www.panditproject.org/entity/50978/print

Does anyone have a copy of this publication, or know where to find it?

Thanks,
