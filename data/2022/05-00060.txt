I was watching a video about berserkers inspired by the new movie The Northman and they mentioned that not only were there Viking bear warriors but there were also wolf warriors as shown in the movie. The video said that these wolf warriors are widely found among many of the early Indo-Europeans including in the Vedas.
Can anyone point me to sources about Vedic wolf warriors?
Best,
Dean
