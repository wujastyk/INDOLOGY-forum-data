Dear Harry,
regarding early Ayurveda (before V?gbha?a) I can add the the following:
  * Only the Su?rutasa?hit? mentions Dhanvantari regularly but this is a
    secondary development. As this article shows, his role was augmented
    only from around the 9th century onward:
    https://www.academia.edu/56668282.
  * According to the sources, mantras do play a minor role in early
    Ayurveda. For example, in the whole Su?rutasa?hit? I could find only
    17 passages directly referring to mantras, only 9 of them quote
    specific mantras.
  * Addressed deities include ?iva/Rudra, Brahm?, Vi??u, the A?vins,
    Agni, Varu?a, V?yu, Soma, etc., but not Dhanvantari.
Thus, mantras addressing Dhanvantari are very likely a later development 
or originate in other (maybe tantric) healing traditions.
For more details, you can take a look at this workshop paper on 
Medication or Magic? Mantras in Early ?yurveda 
<https://www.academia.edu/79051821/> which I presented earlier this year 
at the mantra workshop in Vienna. At the moment, I am preparing a more 
comprehensive article on the same topic, but it is still work in progress.
Best wishes,
Vitus
