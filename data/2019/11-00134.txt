*Theme: A Beautiful Sunset: The Legacy of Gerald James Larson (1938?2019)*
Saturday, 1:00 PM?3:00 PM Convention Center-2 (Upper Level West)

This panel will address the legacy of Gerald James Larson, an
internationally renowned scholar of the philosophies, religions, and
cultures of India, who passed away in April 2019. The panelists will
explore Larson?s contributions, as one of the world?s foremost authorities
on the S??khya and Yoga systems of religious thought, to the development of
S??khya studies and Yoga studies in the academy through his seminal
works *Classical
S??khya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning* (1969), *S??khya: A
Dualist Tradition in Indian Philosophy* (1987), and *Yoga: India?s
Philosophy of Meditation* (2008), culminating in *Classical Yoga Philosophy
and the Legacy of S??khya* (2018). The panelists will also reflect on
Larson?s contributions, as a scholar and mentor, to a range of other
fields, including the study of tantric traditions; systems of Indian
medicine; religion, politics, and law in modern India; Indian traditions of
visual arts; and the cross-cultural philosophy of religion.

*Theme: Consumption for Transcendence: Foodways, Diet, and Drugs in Yoga
Practice *
Saturday, 5:30 PM?7:00 PM Hilton Bayfront-Aqua 305 (Third Level)

Combining philological, ethical, historical, and ethnographic voices, this
90-minute panel addresses yogic practices of consumption particularly as
they relate to foodways, diet, and drugs. Our approach is purposefully
broad in scope, drawing from both pre-modern and modern sources in order to
initiate a conversation concerning categories of yogic practice that fall
under the umbrella of ?consumption? that have received little focused
attention in yoga studies. Our papers individually and collectively
demonstrate how studying yogic practices of consumption propels yoga
scholarship into a discussion of the relationship between yoga and other
fields of textual inquiry (e.g. ayurvedic, tantric, alchemical) as well as
into an investigation of wider cultural logics wherein we encounter yoga
practitioners in health food stores, eating nationalist food products,
and/or attending ayahuasca retreats in the ethnographic present. This panel
thus also suggests new methodologies for studying the category of ?yoga?
from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

*Theme: Yoga Across Boundaries: New Technologies and Changing Practices*
Sunday, 3:30 PM?5:00 PM Hilton Bayfront-Sapphire D (Fourth Level)

This roundtable discussion focuses on the impact of current and emerging
technologies on the evolution of various forms of yoga. Specifically, four
presenters will contribute material on: the co-construction of modern yoga
across cyberspaces, the innovative internet business model of YogaGlo,
online Jain yoga, and finally, Yoga Bhavadhara, a new form of modern
postural yoga, which incorporates digital projectors, simulated
environments, and online streaming audio services. The panel also features
two responders, who will add to the discussion from both a more traditional
academic angle, as well as assessing the popular practitioner-oriented and
business dimension of the presentations.

*Theme: Author-Meets-Critics: Panel Discussion of Debating Yoga and
Mindfulness in Public Schools: Reforming Secular Education or
Reestablishing Religion? (University of North Carolina Press, 2019) by
Candy Gunther Brown*
Monday, 3:30 PM?5:00 PM Convention Center-20A (Upper Level East)

The 2019 publication of *Debating Yoga and Mindfulness in Public Schools:
Reforming Secular Education or Reestablishing Religion?* by Candy Gunther
Brown (University of North Carolina Press), the conference theme Scholarly
Workers in Public Spaces, and our location in San Diego constitute a
remarkable convergence. In the 2013 court case *Sedlock v. Baird*, parents
sued San Diego?s Encinitas Union School District for indoctrinating
children in Hinduism and Buddhism by teaching Ashtanga yoga and
mindfulness. Both parties enlisted religious studies scholars, among them
Brown, as expert witnesses. Brown draws on experience in *Sedlock* and
three additional legal challenges to assess ethical and legal implications,
foregrounding values of respect for cultural and religious diversity,
informed consent, transparency, and voluntarism. This author-meets-critics
panel facilitates conversation among scholars who have been involved and/or
analyzed the stakes when yoga and mindfulness are practiced and debated in
public spaces. It seeks to model civic discourse across difference.
