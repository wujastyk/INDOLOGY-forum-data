[INDOLOGY] Naga Jolokia (Balogh D?niel)
Dear Daniel,
Thank you for your query. The term 'jolokia' (???????) is in the Assamese
language. ??????? by itself means chili pepper. And 'bhut jolokia' (???
???????) refers to a specific chili pepper that has the reputation of being
the world's hottest pepper.
Hope this helps.
Sincerely,
Jahnabi
