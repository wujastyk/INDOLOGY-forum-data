Dear Daniel,

Thank you for your query. The term 'jolokia' (???????) is in the Assamese
language. ??????? by itself means chili pepper. And 'bhut jolokia' (???
???????) refers to a specific chili pepper that has the reputation of being
the world's hottest pepper.

Hope this helps.

Sincerely,
Jahnabi
