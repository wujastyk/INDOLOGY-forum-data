[INDOLOGY] question about a Jaina practice
Thanks, Patrick,
     I now looked at all the images in the link provided by Lubomir.  I am
interested in something like this for personal use.  Three months after my
knee joint replacement surgery, I can now fold my legs for Yoga, but only
with some discomfort.  Perhaps, something like this Yogapa??a will be
useful.  Best,
Madhav
