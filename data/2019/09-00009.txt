ABSTRACT
J?takas or ?stories of past lives of the Buddha? form an important and popular part of Buddhist scriptures, both for the Buddhist tradition itself and modern scholarship. The only surviving canonical collection of j?takas is that of the Therav?dins included in the P?li canon. In the literary genre of the ?s traditional j?takas have been adapted and transformed into new stories composed in the style of classical Indian poetry (k?vya). Thus it is to be expected that a comprehensive canonical collection such as the P?li J?taka, or some very similar collection, exerted a certain influence on the writers of j?takam?l?s. The lecture tries to illustrate the quite different degree of influence traditional j?takas as found in the P?li J?taka had on the works of ?rya??ra and Haribha??a respectively, even though both poets are otherwise closely linked representatives of the genre of the j?takam?l?s.

Best wishes,

Rupert Gethin
