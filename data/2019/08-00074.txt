Dear list members,
On page 23 of Aesthetic Rapture by Masson and Patwardhan , their work on
chapter 6 of N??ya??stra by Bharata is given a definition of sth?yibh?va .
"Now the sth?yibh?va is a state of mind which because it is more deeply
felt, dominates all other emotions.  It belongs to both the character and
to the spectator".
But the authors don't give a textual reference for this statement.  Can
anyone give me a textual reference that supports the part of the
definition: ". . . It belongs to both the character and to the spectator".
Thanks,
Harry Spier
