[INDOLOGY] Webinar on 11/21: Introduction to South Asian Collection at Library of Congress
Dear colleagues,
Apologies for cross-posting and/or if you've already seen this on other
channels... Next week, my colleague Charlotte Giles and I will be hosting a
webinar on the many aspects of the South Asian collection at the Library of
Congress. The webinar will take place on Thursday November 21 (1-2pm), and
registration is through the Eventbrite link below. Please feel free to
share this with colleagues, students, and all others who may be interested.

For those who cannot attend, we also plan to record the webinar and make it
available on the Library's Asian Reading Room website (this may take a
couple of months).
Kind regards,
Jon
Jonathan Loar, Ph.D.
