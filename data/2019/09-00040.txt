[INDOLOGY] Rampur Raza Library
A fellow historian of astrology (not an Indologist, and so not a member 
of this list) has been trying with limited success to acquire copies of 
Arabic astrological MSS from Raza Library. If anyone should be able and 
willing to help, please contact me off-list.
Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
