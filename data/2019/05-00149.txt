*?c?rebhya? kavibhyo vidvadbhya? ca nama? |*

Oxford Bibliographies in Hinduism have informed me that my entry on Durg?
has just been published and is available to read online. My sincere
gratitude to various editors, known and anonymous, who suggested further
readings, that I greatly enjoyed and learned so much from.

Apologies in advance for omissions. My earnest plea echoing the words of
Some?varadeva: *[vaya?...] durge 'tra m?rge tad api prav?tt? nopek?itavy??
kavibhi? skhalanta?* (*Surathotsava* 1.62 cd).

This is work in progress, and hence I would be grateful if you could let me
know of improvements and suggestions of further materials, which I can then
include. The article can be accessed here:
