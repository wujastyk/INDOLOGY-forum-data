Dear Herman,

Thank you for your comments.

<<amil karuma? or karumaka? (*-maka?* is Skt putra) is attested only late,
namely in Kampa?'s R?m?yanam...>>

Right, '*attested* only late'. But it would have been in use - not
necessarily exactly in the form mentioned by Turner in his CDIAL -
centuries earlier, long before the age of the Buddha. Linguistically, the
area of his activity must have been far from uniform. It would include not
only the Indo-Aryan, but also Dravidian and Austric speaking tribes, among
them iron-smelters (called Asurs, Agarias).

Cunda, whose Summing up
As the keepers of the secrets surrounding the miraculous transformation of
iron-ore into - finally - steel, the iron smiths must have had their own
tradition - mythology and rituals.
