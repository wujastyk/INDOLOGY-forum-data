Dear Colleagues:
I would like to offer my sincere gratitude for all of your valuable resources and suggestions with regard to k?vya-based depictions of yoga, and related scholarship. It has given the student much to work with, and we are hopeful that it might prove to be a fruitful area of investigation for an MA thesis. We are compiling a bibliography based on your suggestions, and will post the results to the list. 
Thanks again for all of your thoughtful responses,
with best wishes,
Adheesh
