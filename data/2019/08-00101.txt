[INDOLOGY] Doom and dharma
Dear colleagues, 
I would refer you to the most recent etymological handbooks: 
Mayrhofer's _Etymologisches W?rterbuch des Altindoarischen_, Vol. I
(Heidelberg, 1992) pp. 778-780 derives Vedic _dh?rman-_ 'St?tze, fester
Halt, feststehende Ordnung, Gesetz' and derivatives as nominal
derivatives to Vedic ?dhar- 'halten, festhalten' and ultimately to PIE
*d?er- 'make firm, fix' (cf. Rix et al. _Lexikon der indogermanischen
Verben_ 2e pp.145-146 for further cognates). 
As for Proto-Germanic *d?ma- 'verdict, evaluation' on the other hand, it
is typically derived from PIE *d?oh?-mo-, a derivative of PIE *d?eh?-
'to put, place', cf. Orel, _A Handbook of Germanic Etymology_ (Leiden,
2003) p.73, Kroonen, _Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic_
(Leiden, 2013) p.98, and, e.g., Lehmann, _A Gothic Etymological
Dictionary_ (Leiden, 1986) p.93. 
As such, the similarity between Vedic _dh?rman- _and English _doom_ is a
chance resemblance with no common etymology linking the two together,
not even as a root etymology. 
I hope you find this email is helpful. 
Kind regards,
