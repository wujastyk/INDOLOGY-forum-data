[INDOLOGY] Out-of-body experience in Indian religions
This probably goes down a rabbit hole that Jessie's colleague wouldn't be
interested in, but Jessie's referencing the Visuddhimagga and Matthew's
referencing tales of Maudgalyayana's journeys makes me think that in
Buddhist contexts at least, these experiences were typically assumed to be
had with what was termed a "body made of mind" (manomaya k?ya [two words]
or manomayak?ya [one compounded word], depending on the source). This
raises the question of whether or not these experiences were literally
"out-of-body". The P?li sources I'm familiar with at least typically say
the manomaya k?ya is "r?pin", in other words it has form. But I suppose
that might well take us into the issue of whether or not terms like "k?ya"
and "r?pin" connote PHYSICAL form in these contexts...
But to get back to Jessie's colleague's interests, among the many Buddhist
sources that speak of such journeying to other realms by arhats, the
Sanskrit ones that Matthew cited are indeed the ones that we can most
reliably date as closest to the Common Era's beginnings, the specific
period that this colleague is apparently focusing on.
