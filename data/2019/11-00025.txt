[INDOLOGY] The alphabet found in the Lalitavistara
Dear Martin,
indirectly I think it was. The Kharo??h? script uses a basic,
non-compositional sign for [???] (??? ? this may not be rendered
correctly on all computers), and the sign for the palatal aspirate
affricate ch [??] (?) is in fact derived from the retroflex one.
Even though the (later?) Br?hm? script does not follow Kharo??h?
in this and composes k? from k + ?, a memory of the (earlier?)
special status of k? appears to have suevived in its position. The
same may also be true for j? at the end of the alphabet, which
etymologially corresponds to simple ? [?] (?) in Kharo??h? as used
for G?ndh?r?.
All best,
Stefan
