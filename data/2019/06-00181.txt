=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Brahm=C4=81_in_early_Vedic_materials=3F?=
Dear Jan,
The discussion of 27 vs 28 described by Lanman as "a moot point? was indeed discussed by Whitney. My understanding is that 28 nak?atras were found in much earlier sa?hit?s such as the Taittir?ya (4.4.10) and the Maitray??i (2.13.20). This was my point about the interpolation.
Many have written about the Chinese 28 xiu-s (lunar lodges) and the nak?atras. A good place to start would be Needham?s Science and Civilisation in China. Vol. 3. Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth. Yano has a concise and useful discussion is his book ?Esoteric Buddhist Astrology? (p. 62-64 of English trans. just published this year).
Best regards,
Bill
