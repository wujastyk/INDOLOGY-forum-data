Dear Mr Das,

You may refer to *Dictionary of Nyaya Terms* of Prof V N Jha, published by
Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, Pune which is in English. If you can
refer to Prof Bhimacharya Jhalkikar's *Nyayakosha* published by Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute, Pune which is in Sanskrit will be great and
useful.

Here is the meaning of these words for your immediate reference.

1) Annyay - I am not able to understand exactly what is the word you are
referring to.
I assume it might be Anvaya and there are five meanings for that.
     a) relations between two positive entities - ?????? ???????? ???
?????? ??? ????????? |
     b) the presence of what is produced in the locus of cause -
??????????? ???????? ???????? |
     c) sentence - meaning
     d) relation - ?????????????? ???????? |
     e) invariable concomitance of probans in general with the probandum in
general - ?????????????? ??????????????? ??????????????

2) vyatireka (in vyatireka-vyapti) =  pervasion of difference or
dissimilitude, a comprehensive argument derived from negation or
non-existence of certain qualities (refer to:
https://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/252.html#H_vyatireka/ opposite to anvaya

3) Vyapti =
  a) invariable concomitance - ????????? ????????? ????????????????????? |
  b) a natural relation between sadhya and sadhana - ???????? ???????
??????? ?????????????????
  c) invariable concomitance is one type of a causal relationship between a
proban and a probandum - ??????????? ??????????????????? ?????????
  d) invariable and inseparable connection

4) Ativyapti = over-application - ???????????????? ??? ??????????????????
????????????

5) Avyapti = Narrow-application - ???????????-???????????? ??????????

Thank you.
