[INDOLOGY] Extension of Sanskrit Heritage tools with connection to Amba Kulkarni's parser
Certainly a welcome development, but
really calls for a thorough revision before activating it. The very few
searches I could make yielded inexplicable, in parts unbelievably wrong
results. Anyone may see for themselves if they just test the declension of
"adas", "idam", "ubhaya" (displaying dual forms, but no fem.), "sarv?"
(fem.), "dos / do?an", "ana?uh", "asthi", and many more. In the hands of
Sanskrit beginners who lack grammatical training this database will do more
harm than good. I can only warn against its use until it has seen a very
careful revision by experts.
Kind regards,
