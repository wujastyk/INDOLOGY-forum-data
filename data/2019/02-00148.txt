[INDOLOGY] Seeking unpublished paper by Simon Digby
There's a 1970 conference presentation by Simon:
   - "Anecdotes of Jogis in Sufi Hagiography," Proceedings of the Seminar
   on Aspects of Religion in South Asia, cyclostyle, London 1970.
It's sometimes called "Encounters with Jogis in Indian Sufi Hagiography," I
believe.
If you have a copy, I would be very grateful if you would share it with me.
Many thanks,
Dominik
