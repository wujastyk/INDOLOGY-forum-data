Subject: [INDOLOGY] Seeking unpublished paper by Simon Digby
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CfQetnxNEnVP-u7jFbhDFJ2KrOP+BvryiDAQQ+1P7VNSg@mail.gmail.com>

There's a 1970 conference presentation by Simon:

   - "Anecdotes of Jogis in Sufi Hagiography," Proceedings of the Seminar
   on Aspects of Religion in South Asia, cyclostyle, London 1970.

It's sometimes called "Encounters with Jogis in Indian Sufi Hagiography," I
believe.

If you have a copy, I would be very grateful if you would share it with me.

Many thanks,
Dominik
