[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear colleagues,
I would like to thank Isabelle Rati? and Dominik Wujastyk for their last emails which had, inter alia, the merit of enabling us to grasp some of the facts (it is a bit difficult to think in the void). I think we all agree that gender equality is far from achieved. It seems that we disagree on the best way to achieve it. I fully agree with Isabelle when she writes: ? Adding a female member to the committee would have the pleasant advantage of satisfying everybody's sense of symmetry, and it is probably the best way to quickly end this controversy; I remain in doubt, however, as to whether this would constitute in any way a significant progress in the struggle against gender bias and sexism. Let us keep our eyes on the frontlines. ? 
As far as I?m concerned, I find that the quota policy is problematic. As a woman, I would not want to be interviewed for a job, shortlisted, hired or integrated into a committee for the mere reason that a woman was needed for the sake of symmetry: I would like to be selected as a scholar for my abilities and because people value my work. I think the best way to achieve equal rights is to see each other as colleagues and individuals without falling in the trap of essentializing the other. Fortunately human beings disagree and that?s healthy that they do. I would not want a male colleague to prevent himself from giving his opinion on my work because I?m a woman. Gender bias exists for sure but, if we don?t see ourselves simply as members of the ? weaker sex ?, then we should be glad to be criticized and to be able to answer and defend our position when it is defensible. 
Kind regards,
Iran
