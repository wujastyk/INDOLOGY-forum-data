btw, Tha ga na is not actually a Tibetan name. It figures among the names of the mahsiddhas, where it is a Tibetan transcription of an MIA form of Sthagana, the Liar. What on earth it's doing as a Kashmiri king's name beats me.

Thanks Matthew.  I will keep the name of king Tha ga na in reference in case I come across anything that would help explain what his Kashmiri name was.
Cheers
James

All we can say is that he must have lived after VAgbhaTa and before ca. 1000.
His concluding verses do mention a king, but I cannot correlate the name as given in Tibetan - Tha ga na - with anyone in the lists of Kashmiri kings with which I am familiar.

Do we have any idea of when Candranandana himself may have lived?

Just to follow up on Andrey's comments:
In the concluding verses in the Rin chen bzang po translation Candranandana states that he was born in Kashmir (kha che'i yul du skyes pa yin). The translator does not tell us where he studied or translated the text, but because Rin chen bzang po did work extensively in Kashmir, we may assume he did so there.

Dear Dr Hartzell,

The introductory verses to Candrananda?s commentary on the A????gah?dayasa?hit? call the text Pad?rthacandrik? (not Am?tah?daya A????ga Guhyopade?atantra ?!). See ?[?] pad?rthacandrik?? ??k?? [?] kari?y?mi ? ?

As far as I am aware, the assumed date of the Tibetan translation provides, indeed, the earliest terminus ante quem, but, as to now, one could not find any evidence to determine the terminus post quem ? that is, the TPQ is given merely by the composition of the root text.
I heard from several scholars in India that they thought Candrananda hailed from Kashmir. I am not sure about the rationale behind this belief, but I guess that it is influenced by the Tibetan tradition. As for Sanskrit sources, someone Candrananda (the Pad?rthacandrik? has not been published in its entirety yet, so we still don?t know if it?s the same Candra or not) is often quoted by K??rasv?min (fl. ca. 11th cent.) in his commentary on the Amarako?a, and one can also establish that Candra?s text exhibited significant influence on Indu (fl. ca. 12th cent.). Both authors were most likely from Kashmir, which may supply some very weak evidence for connecting Candra with this region.

best,
Andrey

Dear Jim,

According to the catalogues of the Tibetan canon, the translation was done by Rin-chen-bzang-po (955-1054), and, because he also translated the root text, this seems likely to be correct.

Although Vairocana of Pa-gor seems to have been a real 8th c. individual, it is very difficult to disentangle whatever is factual from the enormous body of legend that grew up around him. Because the Tibetan medical tantra, the Rgyud-bzhi (Four Tantras), is an apocryphon that claims its authority with reference to the period of the 8th c. monarch Khri srong lde'u btsan, it is not surprising that the "historical" tradition that developed around it would have wanted to appropriate other authorities as well.

best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana

Hi

Does anyone have a definitive date for Candranandana, author of the commentary Am?tah?daya A????ga Guhyopade?atantra on V?gbha?a?s A????gah?daya (or A??h??gasa?hit?)?  According to the Tibetan medical history tradition, as reported in "The Origin of the rGyud bzhi: A Tibetan Medical Tantra? by Todd Fenner (https://www.thlib.org/encyclopedias/literary/genres/genres-book.php#!book=/studies-in-genres/b27/dn3/), Vairocana studied with him in Kashmir, and translated this text into Tibetan, and presented it to King Trisong Detsen (Tibetan: ????????????????), who ruled (according to Wikipedia) 755 CE until 797 or 804 CE.

Dr. Fenner?s history would place Candranandana in the late 8th century CE.  Has this account been further confirmed?

Cheers
James
