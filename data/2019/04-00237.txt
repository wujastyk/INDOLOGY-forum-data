Dear colleagues,
I saw a manuscript of a heavily annotated version of Prof. Gomez's
translation of the Larger Sukh?vat?vy?ha around 20(?) years ago. As far as
I know, Prof. Gomez was translating the text on the request of J?do Shinsh?
Otaniha (?????). As being a member of this school, I was asked to go to
Chicago and assist him, which I declined. Much later the director of the
school showed me a copy of Prof. Gomez's annotated translation and asked me
to evaluate it ??? according to my vague memory, the director was not very
happy with too much detailed notes in it.
When the book was published, I was surprised to find that it differed very
much from the version which I saw. Therefore, it is possible a copy of a
heavily annotated version exists somewhere in Japan.
With best regards,
Seishi Karashima (currently Numata visiting professor at UC Berkeley)
