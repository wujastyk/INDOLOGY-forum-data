Dear Prof. Ruppel,

thanks for the attached concordance. It may be helpful in some cases, though it only gives a very limited orientation.


The 'received' method to find your way from the BORI edition to Ganguli's translation is to calculate as exactly as possible the verse number of the Bombay and/or Calcutta edition(s) by means of the verse numbers for "B" and/or "C" in the upper left (even pp.) and lower right (uneven pp.) margins of the BORI edition. You can then look up these numbers in S. S?rensen's "Concordance to the Bombay and Calcutta editions and P.C. Roy's translation", given in his "Index to the Names in the MBh" (pp. IX-XLI). The accuracy of the respective page number in Ganguli's translation depends on the edition you use, but the discrepancy should not be very great.



This method has the advantage that it also works for many * (asterisk)  and Appendix passages of the BORI ed.


A searchable digitized version of S?rensen's index can be downloaded here:

Best wishes,

Reinhold Gr?nendahl

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Mah?bh?rata concordance?

Many thanks to Aleix Ruiz Falqu?s, Paloma Mu?oz and Simon Brodbeck for their very prompt and very helpful responses! Once more the List has proven its kalpataruesque nature.

For anyone interested, please find a printed concordance attached, in addition to the online version that Aleix linked to.

All the best,
   Antonia

Dear all,

Many thanks for the off-list (and inadvertently on-list:-)) expressions of support!

To make use of the list in the way it was intended to: would anyone have or know whether there is a verse concordance of the Critical Edition of the Mah?bh?rata (as found e.g. on GRETIL) and the version underlying the Ganguli translation (as found on most other online sites, such as sacred-texts.com<http://sacred-texts.com>)? The text of the two greatly overlaps, but the split-up into sections varies, and I am trying to find a straightforward way of locating verses from one edition in the other.

Thank you in advance for your help,
      Antonia
