Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sheldon Pollock sharing draft materials from his desk
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdUdnZRsmrvhqbfHcSt+vEp55f4ZnVV4s37gObQHGvGoA@mail.gmail.com>

Sheldon Pollock is making available drafts of some of his editions and
translations in-progress in the hope that they may prove of some use to
others even in their draft state.

The first post is his *editio princeps* (along with all supporting
manuscript evidence) of Gop?la Bha??a?s *Rasatara?gi??*, the only
commentary on Rudra Bha??a?s *???g?ratilaka *(an *ala?k?ra* work datable to
around 1000 CE)*.* What makes this commentary additionally interesting is
that Gop?la Bha??a, a sixteenth-century scholar, should likely be
identified with the Gop?la Bha??a who was a direct discipline of Caitanya
and author of the most important ritual handbook of Bengali Vaishnavism,
the *Haribhaktivil?sa*.

These materials are available here <http://www.sheldonpollock.org/> under
"Works in Progress."
