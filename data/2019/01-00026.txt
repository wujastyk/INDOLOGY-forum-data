Dear All,

Chiming in with others: I will not forget how kindly Stanley received me on my arrival here, some 31 years ago! Stan and my family spent many Thanksgivings together, up in his retreat in rural Vermont...

Incidentally, we both were students of the great late Paul Thieme at T?bingen.
A commemoration volume based on a memorial conference held there last February, 20 years after his death, edited by Renate S?hnen, will appear soon.

Michael

He was a remarkable wise and sometimes delightfully light-hearted man. This is a great loss to all who knew him, from close and from far.
