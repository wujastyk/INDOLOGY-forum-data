I am not entirely sure either, as I am not familiar with the text, but 
from the surrounding verses (as found on GRETIL 
<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/saiva/tantralu.htm>) 
the context seems to be instructions for determining the most suitable 
time for one or more rituals (that is, muh?rta??stra: electional or 
katarchic astrology). Verse 45 has bhagrahau, making it probable that 
the compound should be understood as a dvandva throughout. In that case, 
bha is probably a synonym of nak?atra or asterism ('zodiacal sign' would 
be another possibility, but I don't see the twelve signs mentioned at 
all, and the nak?atras are typically much used in muh?rta), and graha 
means 'planet'. But what planet is meant, or what it is supposed to be 
doing, is not clear to me. As I said, I haven't studied the text, just 
looked at the section immediately surrounding the verse you asked about.
