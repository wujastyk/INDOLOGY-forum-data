Dear Victor,

I analyse many cosmogonic motives in the Rgveda and, in a diachronic
approach, in the later Sanskrit texts (Atharvaveda, ?atapatha, early
Upanisads) in my books: "Fire and Cognition in the Rgveda" and "Fire, Death
and Philosophy. A History of Ancient Indian Thinking".

Best wishes,

Joanna
