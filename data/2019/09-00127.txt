[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
Dear Martin,
As far as I can see, nobody has yet mentioned K?lid?sa?s Meghad?ta, surely a timeless classic not only of Sanskrit, but of world literature.
?Was will man denn Vergn?glicher wissen!
Sakontala, Nala, die mu? man k?ssen;
Und Meghaduta, den Wolkengesandten,
Wer schickt ihn nicht gerne zu Seelenverwandten!?
Best wishes,
Camillo

Dr.Gluckman,
I personally, would like "VivekChuramani" by Shankaracharya ,for inclusion in the compendium.It is marked by it's lucid style, by which the roots of Adwaitya philosophy has been established.

[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
Dear Colleagues,
I have a lecture to prepare and am conducting a short survey:
I would like to know from the Sanskrit scholarly community what those feel are the utmost most excellent works from the entire corpora and a short line about why.
Think of it as "if there were to be a Pullitzer or Booker Prize for the notable Sanskrit works", who and what would be the nominees and why.
It could be a text that was of exceptional technical value for example P??ini's A???dhy?y? or those that have introduced a novel method in a field of science for example the Su?rutasa?hit?. Then of course a notable poetic marvel such as ?akuntal?.
If there exist some already compiled lists of the same I would most appreciate it.
With warmest wishes,
Martin
