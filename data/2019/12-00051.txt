Subject: [INDOLOGY] Problem with indology list

This seems to be a not uncommon problem. I know nothing of such matters,
but is there some way that outgoing messages from the listserv could be
modified to make them more receivable, rather than having all of the
seemingly many individuals who aren?t receiving everything tweak their
personal email accounts?
