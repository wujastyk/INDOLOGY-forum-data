Subject: [INDOLOGY] URL for transliterating roman to devanagari
Message-ID: <1CB423ED-46F2-4DCD-8404-2989BCDA2F19@berkeley.edu>

In case any on the Indology list don?t know of this, here is a website that does an excellent job of translating Sanskrit in roman to devanagari. It?s very useful because typing in devanagari is extremely difficult ? for me, at least.
