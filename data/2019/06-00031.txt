Dear members of the list,
I wonder if any of you could share with me a soft copy of Mah?deva?s Ny?yakaustubha for the part of the text after the Pratyak?akha??a (several versions of the latter are located on archive.org). In particular, I am looking for the ?abdakha??a (presumably, the final chapter of the text).
Many thanks in advance!
best,
Andrey
