Subject: [INDOLOGY] Call for Papers AAIS first Annual conference
In-Reply-To: <D8347818-C9BF-44B1-91CF-A5590FC045F7@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAGCGLoAaMuRM37cPmE4b=BVjoOhDi82KUeR4-UNppezhsSAkOg@mail.gmail.com>

Although I have no intention to attend it: thanks for sending us this
timely information that it is taking place and an open call for papers.
I am also happy to see critical remarks and *brief* discussions on possible
problems in the organization and motivation of this and other indological
events, but hope that this List will remain a place where scholars,
regardless of their political, philosophical, ethical ... orientation, will
continue to feel welcome to announce their conferences and "conferences".
Best regards,
Jan Houben
