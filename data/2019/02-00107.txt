[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Krishnaprasad Ji,
     Great to see your progress.  A comment.  Some horizontal lines, like
that ?, look thicker than the top line and lines in some other characters.
The thickness should be uniform.  Similarly, the knot for ?, ?, ? etc.
should look exactly the same, and it should look the same whether it
appears in full or half forms of these characters.
