Dear list members,
Would anyone have scans of these papers:
V. Ch. Bhattacharyya, 'Application of ?gveda mantras rubricated in the 
Aitareya-Br?hma?a',? Our Heritage, 1 (Calcutta 1953)
V. Ch. Bhattacharyya, 'An aspect of justification of ?k-mantras in the 
AiB.,? Our Heritage', 3 (Calcutta 1955)
"Our Heritage" is apparently hard to find.
Best regards and many thanks in advance,
Dominik Haas
