Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about a Jaina practice
Message-ID: <EA8F815D502BC14097213C5D85BA1C655C2A1C7D@SPMXM07.VUW.leidenuniv.nl>

Dear List members,

Jaina monks, or their followers, are often depicted sitting with a strap going around their bodies and legs. (a few years ago I saw this contraption in a posh interior decorating shop in Leiden as an alternative chair!) Could anyone tell me if this strap, or sitting supported by this strap, had a (Sanskrit, MIA or NIA) name. By the way, it is not a particular Jaina practice. If I remember well, the strap can also be seen on, for instance, the Borobudur.
