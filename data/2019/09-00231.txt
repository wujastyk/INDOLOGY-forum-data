Two further submissions received to add to the list (thank you to all who have responded):
1.Mahabharata for its general and omnipresent influence on all kinds of cultural and literary creativity.
2.Pin?gala?s Chandah?s?a?stra with its technically varied breakdown of Ancient Indian metres & metrics, being as intricate as intriguing.
