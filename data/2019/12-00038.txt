Dear list members,
I have received these two offlist replies that address what Raik Strunz
wrote:
Raik Stunz wrote:
unfortunately I have not come across the word *pran?at*- yet, but it (*
*pran?a?t*-) might be formed depending on pa?da c?s *bhu?bhr?t*- from the
prefixed root-noun *pra-nm?-t*-, similar to nasal-root compounds e.g. in ?
*gat*. Question is indeed, if this nasal derivative is productive.
Offlist reply:
I think Raik Strunz?s analysis is exactly right. Additional evidence that
he is correct is that Pata?jali mentions a form su-na-t- from ?nam (cited
in Altindische Grammatik II, 2 p. 42). Such forms are rare, but they occur.
If pra-?a-t- is a one-off, which is probably is, again Strunz is surely
right that it is based on bh?-bh?-t- in c.

Other Offlist reply:
I think pra?at?? makes sense as a feminine accusative sg form in the sense
of "she who is worshipped for vr?ddhi and siddhi."  I cannot think of a way
to explain this as a genitive plural.
Also Walter Slaje suggested an emendation:
Since however in Mark-Pur??a 85.7cd we read:
*nama? prak?tyai bhadr?yai niyat?? pra?at?? sma t?m*,
I suggest a simple emendation *pra?at??* (plural agreeing with plural
*kurmo*), which would result in:
*kaly??yai pra?at? v?ddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo nama?*
In one word: remove the *anusv?ra*-dot. And done.
 A manuscript of the durgasaptasati from the Lalchand Research library has
a different version of this verse (two different words in the phrase with
pra?at?? ) but it also has pra?at?? not pra?at? (from pra?at??). It has:
Kaly??yai pra?at?m?ddhyai siddhyai k?rmyai namo nama?/
nair?tyai bh?bh?t?? lak?myai ?arv??yai te namo nama?//11//
Does this not suggest  pra?at?m is correct?
