[INDOLOGY] ECSAS 2020 CfP for Designing Water: Morphology, Ecology and Histories of Waterscapes in South Asia
Dear List Members,
In representation of the convenor Jutta Jain-Neubauer I would like to 
draw your attention to the Call for Papers for the ECSAS 2020 panel 
"Designing Water: Morphology, Ecology and Histories of Waterscapes in 
South Asia."
The panel intends to explore innovative narratives of water structures 
in terms of their eco-historical, socio-political and aesthetic siting, 
beyond the conventional art historical parameters, and breaking the 
boundaries of hitherto often tightly fenced disciplines.
More details can be found at the panel website: 
https://ecsas2020.univie.ac.at/panels/1zbrn/
As stated by others before, the Call for Papers at ECSAS closes on 
November 17. Submissions are very welcome.
Best wishes,
Vitus Angermeier
