The University of Oxford is one of the world's leading centres for the study of Sanskrit.  We are recruiting an Associate Professor of Sanskrit from 1 October 2019, or as soon as possible thereafter. The post will enhance provision for the teaching of Sanskrit language, literature, and pre-modern Indian culture in the Faculty of Oriental Studies, and will be attached to Wolfson College.

This post offers a scholar with a growing national and international reputation an exciting opportunity to become established as a leader in this field, in which the University of Oxford enjoys a pre-eminent reputation. You will find a vibrant intellectual environment with a broad expertise in Indian Studies, and will be able to make use of Oxford?s unique resources, such as the Sanskrit manuscript collection in the Bodleian Library and the Indian art collection in the Ashmolean Museum.

The Associate Professor will carry out advanced research and disseminate this by publication and other means, developing the study of Sanskrit in Oxford.  You will lecture and teach classes, including small tutorial groups, and help to co-ordinate the undergraduate and Master's degree courses in this field.  This will include examining for these courses. You will supervise graduate and research students, seek opportunities for research projects, and assist in the administration of the Subject Group and Faculty when invited to do so.

You will have an outstanding record of research and publication in one or more of the study fields of Sanskrit language, Sanskrit literature, or any of the pre-modern and early modern disciplines of ??stra, and a record of successful undergraduate and graduate teaching, including experience of designing and introducing new courses. The ability to lecture in an interesting and engaging manner to a mixed audience, including undergraduates, and a high degree of expertise in Classical Sanskrit is essential. You must have a proven ability and readiness to contribute effectively to academic administration, a proven record of successful collaboration with colleagues in pursuit of common goals in research, teaching, and administration, and a demonstrated capacity for leadership in maintaining and developing teaching programmes. A doctorate in a relevant field of South Asian Studies, complete by the time of appointment, is also essential.

The closing date for applications is 12.00 noon on Friday 22 February 2019.
