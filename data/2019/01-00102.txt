[INDOLOGY] Descriptions of the Sandhya rituals
Dear list members,
Can any list members point me to articles or books on the Sandhya daily
rituals (preferably in pdf form)..  I've been told that this is performed
differently by the different vedic sakhas so any articles or information on
that would also be appreciated.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
