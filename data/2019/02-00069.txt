[INDOLOGY] Various Font's comparison with Vani Vilas
Dear Krishnaprasad Ji,
     Both Vani Vilas and Nirnaya Sagara fonts look good, the conjuncts look
better in the Nirnaya Sagara font, but you can design them in the Vani
Vilas as well.  Great work.  About the conjuncts in Dominik's ?a?tri??at, I
wonder what is the practice in the manuscripts.  I don't remember seeing a
conjunct where ? or ??? hangs below ?.  In this case, perhaps writing
??????????? may be closer to the practice of the manuscripts.  This needs
to be checked, perhaps in the manuscripts of the
?a?tri??at-tattva-sandoha.  With best wishes,
