[INDOLOGY] Reading Early Material Texts: A Paleography and Codicology Workshop, May 20-22, Delhi
Dear colleagues,
I would like to extend an invitation to participate in *"Reading Early
Material Texts: a Paleography and Codicology Workshop
<https://www.uchicago.in/events/reading-early-material-texts-a-paleography-and-codicology-workshop/>,"*
to be held at the *University of Chicago Center* in *New Delhi *on *May
20-22*. In particular, I would like to encourage postgraduate students in
Indian universities and institutions to apply since the University of
Chicago will cover travel to Delhi, accommodation, and meals for the
duration of the workshop for a select number of students. (See details on
applying below.)
This three-day workshop will provide graduate students and early career
scholars an opportunity to receive basic training in the paleography and
codicology of South Asian material texts?including manuscript books,
scrolls, notebooks, and other handwritten documents?and provide more
advanced scholars an opportunity to share approaches, receive feedback on
current research, and reflect critically on traditions and trends of
textual criticism, scholarly editing, book history, and the digital
humanities. The workshop will consist of eight presentations by scholars in
which they will guide participants through the process of working with
manuscripts in a ?hands on? fashion, introducing them to techniques not
only for reading textual artifacts, but also for understanding those
artifacts in their historical, social, and material totality using both
traditional and emerging methods (e.g. text criticism and techniques from
the digital humanities). Documents in Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, Urdu,
Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, and other languages, and in multiple scripts,
will be addressed. Session leaders include Sweta Prajapati (Oriental
Institute, MSU Baroda), Prachi Deshpande (CSSSC, Kolkata), Chander Shekhar
(Delhi University), Thibaut d'Hubert (University of Chicago), Achintya
Biswas (Jadavpur University), and Tyler Williams (University of Chicago).
(Additional session leaders are TBA).
The workshop will feature a *keynote address* by the prominent art
historian, art critic, and scholar of manuscript culture *B.N. Goswamy* on *May
20th at 6:00pm*.
