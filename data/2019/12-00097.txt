Dear Stefania Ji,
I am really sorry to know that you were hospitalized for about a month due
to ill health. I hope you are feeling better now. Please take due care to
your health as it is very important.
It is a great satisfaction to me to know that you found our work of
inclusion of Hindi text quite all right and flawless. We have planned to
undertake rest of this work with the same zeal and I look forward to
receive  the remaining part of the Dictionary so that we can finish the
work as much early as possible.
I hope you will also take care of providing the funds agreed already.
Regards, Susheel

Dear Susheel ji,
my apologies for not replying before to your email of 17th November, but I
have been hospitalized for more than one month and I had to delay all the
dictionary work. As soon as I recovered I forwarded the file you kindly
sent us to the Head of the project, in order to send you the official reply
on behalf of our Department.
I personally would like to express my most sincere appreciation on your
work and the competence of your team. The job you did is very accurate and
I am extremely happy to collaborate with you. I will be always grateful to
Mrinal ji for having recommended us your valuable printing company.
Unfortunately we suffered some delays due to some bureaucratical slowness,
but we will try to do our best to proceed quickly with the payment
mentioned in our previous letter, the revision of the file you sent us and
the next slot of pages.
I will definitely be able to send you the official letter in a few days.
Again, my most sincere apologies and deep appreciation.
Kind regards,
