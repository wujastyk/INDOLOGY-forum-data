Dear Dr. Koch,
You are more likely to find paintings of hells or hell dwellers in the Jain collections of manuscripts. In the catalogues of such collections I have found them referred to with the Gujarati title n?rakino / n?rak?no citra. Please see the catalogues of collections at Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Indological research Institute (Ahmedabad) and Jain ?tm?nanda Sabh? (Bhavnagar). Some collections may be found also in Mumbai.
