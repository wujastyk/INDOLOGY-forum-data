[INDOLOGY] Seeking unpublished paper by Simon Digby
Dear Colleagues,
I can't remember if it's permissible to share a PDF with the whole forum.
That would be nice for this article on Encounters with Jogis, as I suspect
many would like it. But if not, I personally would love to receive a copy
of it too.
Best to All,
Brad Clough
