I delivered in 2018:  "From P??ini to Pata?jali and Beyond - Development of
Religious Motifs in Sanskrit Grammar."

The pdf of this publication is available on the following website:
www.knaw.nl

I have not tried downloading it, but this is what the published version
says.  Let me know if there are any issues with downloading.

With best regards,
