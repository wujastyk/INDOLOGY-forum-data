[INDOLOGY] ISO15919 and case insensitivity
Dear D?niel (and Arlo),
While I'm afraid that I cannot contribute any answers to your questions, I
do want to express support for your effort of finding ways to modify
ISO15919 for epigraphical and codicological material. In addition to the
issue of initial/full vowels and missing consonant glyphs in manuscripts, I
frequently run into problems with transliterating manuscript material
(usually vernacular but sometimes Sanskrit) that 1) uses multiple glyphs
for the what is ostensibly the same consonant (perhaps the result of
unstated phonological rules), or 2) in which vowel matras are used appended
to full vowel glyphs to indicate certain sounds (e.g. dipthongs). This is
in addition to the numerous challenges posed by transliterating texts
copied in the Arabic script, which represents morphological distinctions
orthographically through the use of word breaks, diacritical marks, etc.
All this to say that, should there be a discussion on proposed changes, I
would be happy to contribute (and learn from others).
Best,
Tyler
