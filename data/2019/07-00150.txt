The Brill font has many virtues, but it isn't free for general use.  Only
on your own computer.  If you want to publish something, you have to ask
Brill's permission.  Same with the Murty fonts.
The rendering of macrons etc. could be a font issue, but it could also be a
limitation of the text composition software being used.
Try TeX Gyre Pagella?  Or Libertinus Serif?  Both free and excellent.
Best,
