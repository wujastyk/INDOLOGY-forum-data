Dear Chakravarthi
Look in The Muktabodha digital library .
 It contains the nATyazAstram with the abhinavabharati in 3 volumes from
the Gaekwads Oriental series .
 https://muktabodha.org/digital-library/
It is in the "searchable e-text library" section of the library.
Use username:  muktabodha
password: indology
 Click on nAtyazAstram Vol 1, nAtyazAstram Vol 2, nAtyazAstram Vol 3.
It is available in a searchable e-text in unicode transliteration and as a
pdf in devanagari.
Regards,
Harry Spier
