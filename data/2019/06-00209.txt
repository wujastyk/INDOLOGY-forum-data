Subject: [INDOLOGY] A question on gha?ik?s

 

Dear Scholars,

 

 

I remember  reading a discussion about how examinations were conducted in a typical gha?ik?. Each question was written on a palm leaf and many such palm leaves were put inside a pot. When a student came to be tested, a palm leaf was pulled from the pot and the student was asked the question written on the palm leaf. 

 

Unfortunately, I have lost the reference to this discussion. Does anybody on the list know the source?

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
