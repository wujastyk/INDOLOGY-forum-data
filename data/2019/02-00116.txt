[INDOLOGY] Journal of Indian philosophy
Dear List members,
Since my last message it has become clear that I had erroneously concluded that the library of the university of Leiden had discontinued its subscription to IJP. The problem was that the catalogue linked to a collection with limited years, while it should have linked to the Springer site with the complete journal. I am told that the situation will be corrected.
Once more I like to thank everybody for the quick reactions with the pdf of Emmrich's article.
With the best wishes,
Herman
