[INDOLOGY] question about a Jaina practice
Besides the wonderfully illustrated article shared by Lubomir, there is a lot of material on the yogapa??a in Brahmanical ascetic literature. The conferring of the yogapa??a appears to be some sort of higher ordination in the Brahmanical orders. See my edition of V?sudev??rama?s Yatidharmaprak???, 66.1?24, a section called ?yogapa??avidhi?.
