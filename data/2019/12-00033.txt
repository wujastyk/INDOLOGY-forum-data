This is also Mark.-Pur??a 85.9cd:
*kaly??yai pra?at?? v?ddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo nama?*
A corruption or a slip by the author is the most likely explanation. He
might have wished to say *pra-?amat-??* (genitive plural of the present
participle formed from *pra*+?*nam*). Since *pra?amat??* conflicts with the
metre, he may have used *pra-?at-??*.
Since however in Mark-Pur??a 85.7cd we read:
*nama? prak?tyai bhadr?yai niyat?? pra?at?? sma t?m*,
I suggest a simple emendation *pra?at??* (plural agreeing with plural
*kurmo*), which would result in:
*kaly??yai pra?at? v?ddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo nama?*
In one word: remove the *anusv?ra*-dot. And done.
