Dear List Members

For those who may be interested, please see below details of the SOAS Yoga
Studies Summer School.

*SOAS Yoga Studies Summer School (at the SOAS Centre of Yoga Studies)*
June 17-July 05, 2019

This summer school provides an introduction to yoga studies with classes on
key aspects of yoga history, philosophy, and contemporary practice. The
course is structured into sections: textual history, philosophy,
ethnography and bodily practice, Sanskrit language, and critical thought.
The history section will constitute the primary focus of study and will
draw on the expertise of the SOAS Ha?ha Yoga Project team to survey the
history of hatha yoga through Sanskrit texts. The philosophy classes will
introduce students to key concepts in classical yoga and to contextual
readings of the *P?ta?jalayoga??stra*. In the ethnography class, students
will reflect on ways to analyse experience and movement in postural yoga in
relation to historical texts. The course also provides an introduction to
key terms in the Sanskrit language for yoga studies and to scholarship on
critical issues in contemporary yoga.

The summer school will be taught by the research team of the Ha?ha Yoga
Project (Drs James Mallinson, Mark Singleton, Daniela Bevilacqua, and Jason
Birch) and other specialist scholars from SOAS and beyond. The full
teaching schedule and booking details are on our website:
