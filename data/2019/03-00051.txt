[INDOLOGY] The Mirror in Vedic India: Its ancient use and present relevance in dating texts
Dear Prof. Ask Parpola,
Can we be sure that the authors of Upanishads were so isolated from the
India that used mirrors by the time they were authoring those texts?
While we see Dravidian and south Indian linguistic and other elements in
various Vedic texts and Sanskrit , can we propose this isolation
selectively in the case of these texts?
Another crucial question is how sure can we be of the exhaustive coverage
every piece of material culture, floors or fauna of known to a linguistic
group in their texts? Can absence of a word be taken as evidence for the
absence of the entity indicated by it?
