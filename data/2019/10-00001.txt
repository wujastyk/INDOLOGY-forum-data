[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
I am happy Camillo mentioned Kalidasa. I would like to add  3 books.
Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa
A book which which really tells about Indian Culture.
Champu Ramayana of Bhoja.
 Kadambari of Bana Bhatta.
These are the 3 books which even if the same authors, try to write a
similar work would  fail.
