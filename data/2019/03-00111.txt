Dear list members,

What is the verbal category of pracoday?t in g?yatr? mantras . For example :

 ekadant?ya vidmahe

vakratu???ya dh?mahi

tan no dant? pracoday?t


Is it a causative subjunctive similar to the example in Whitney's grammar
section 1043  dh?ray?t

or is it a benedictive/precative?  Is there such a thing as a causative
precative?


Thanks,

Harry Spier
