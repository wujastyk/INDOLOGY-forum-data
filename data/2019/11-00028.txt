[INDOLOGY] Script tables
Dear list members,
I was wondering whether anyone has experience drawing up "script tables,"
representating the characters used either in a given document (say a
manuscript or inscription) or in a collection of documents. I realize that
a lot depends on whether the table will be printed or published online
(e.g., the use of color images), but I'm interested in recommendations for
producing suitable images. (I'm aware of the very useful charts, adapted
from B?hler?s Indische Palaeographie, that D?niel Balogh posted on this
list some time ago.)
