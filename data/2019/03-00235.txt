Irregularity of avagraha has sometimes confused great scholars like
Whitney.  While editing the ?aunak?y? Catur?dhy?yik? on the basis of a
single available manuscript, Whitney found a rule ??????????? in the
manuscript.  The two previous rules described the prayatna in the
pronunciation of spirants and vowels [??????? ?????? ?, ???????? ?].  These
rules described the effort involved in these two types of sounds as *vivr?ta
*"open".  Then came the rule ??????????? which Whitney translated as "some
consider it as forming a contact."  He then commented that this view is
"too obviously and grossly incorrect, one would think, to be worth
quoting."  Ever since I read Whitney's edition and his comments, I had a
feeling that the original rule must have been ????????????.  The prayatna
of vowels is described as being ???????? in many sources, and the ?aunak?ya
Catur?dhy?yik? was making a presentation of the *vivr?ta *view and the
*aspr???a
*view as alternatives.  This was later justified by my examination of many
other manuscripts that did use the sign of *avagraha*.  So the reading in
my edition reads ?????????????.
