Dear Colleagues
(1) Does anyone know where there is a searchable Sanskrit text of the Mah?vastu Avad?na online? The one formerly at http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/buddh/mhvastuu.htm seems to have disappeared.
(2) Similarly with a searchable translation? The versions I?ve found of the J J Jones one are frustrating to use: see (3).
(3) Does anyone understand the verse and chapter numbering of this text? The text references and translation seem to use a completely different system.
(4) Has anyone got Basak?s text to hand? If so, I would be grateful to see copies of a couple of pages.
Many thanks -
