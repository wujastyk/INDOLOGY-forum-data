I vaguely recall an Indian copyright lawyer telling me years ago that for
works published in India before 1957 copyright expires 50 years after date
of publication.  But for works published after 1957 copyright expires 50 or
75 years after the authors death. (I don't recall if he said 50 or 75
years).  And for government published works its 50 or 75 years after
publication.

Can anyone confirm or correct this?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
