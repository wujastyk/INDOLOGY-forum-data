As far as I know Alfred Ludwig published a translation of the Rgveda into
German plus commentary plus introduction between 1876 and 1883.
If this first complete translation of the Rgveda is now being translated
into English I consider this very good news.
As for RV 1.164.23-24, 12 years ago I concluded my study of these stanzas
as follows:

RV 1.16423-24, two enigmatic statements in the "Riddle Hymn," express two
complementary viewpoints on the relationship between smaller and larger
units of metrical speech employed in ritual chanting. As such, they provide
antecedents for two complementary views which play a major role in
Bhartrhari's V?kyapad?ya, one according to which the units of a lower
organizational level (especially the word and its meaning) are primary, the
other according to which units of a higher organizational level (especially
the sentence and its meaning) are primary.

For those who want to see the full argument I have uploaded the article on
academia.edu:
