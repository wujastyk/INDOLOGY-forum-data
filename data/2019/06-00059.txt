[INDOLOGY] Studies on the Rigveda [Addendum: Table of Contents]
Dear Joanna,
"To be ignored is even worse than to be criticized." Hear, hear!
Already an admirer of your work, I now start liking you even better.
Count me in for your "fierce discussion with fruitful conclusions
which will open new perspectives in our research. No exclusive, but
inclusive."
So long,
Koenraad ELST
