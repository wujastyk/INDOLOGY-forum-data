[INDOLOGY] Hobson-Jobson
Dear Colleagues,
perhaps a bit of background information is useful. The original Hobson-Jobson. A Glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive was compiled by Henry Yule (1820?1889) in collaboration with A. Burnell (1840?1882) and published much after Burnell?s death in 1886. A second edition was revised and published by William Crooke (1848?1923). Fortunately to us, Crooke?s additions are clearly marked as such. This 2nd ed. has been reprinted by Munshiram Manoharlal, my copy is from 1984. The work is a mine of information, but of rather little use for Sanskrit studies. Less well-known is that there is a similar dictionary of Portuguese words of Asian origin by Monsenhor Sebasti?o Rodolfo Dalgado (1855?1922): Gloss?rio Luso-Asi?tico. 1-2. 68+535+580 p. Coimbra 1919-21, reprinted in Hamburg 1982.
Best,
Klaus
