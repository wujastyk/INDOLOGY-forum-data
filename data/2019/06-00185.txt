Dear colleagues,

I am happy to announce that a PDF file of the third volume of the new
edition of the* Mah?vastu*, ed. by Dr. Marciniak, is now available on the
website of IRIAB (http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/en/publication/bppb.html). Some
addenda et corrigenda are incorporated in the file. A list of further
addenda et corrigenda will be occasionally renewed and uploaded. I myself
and Dr. Marciniak are now preparing vols. I and II, which will be published
in the coming years.


A proposed abbreviation of this edition is as follows:

Mv(KM)  =  *The Mah?vastu: A New Edition* by Seishi Karashima and Katarzyna
Marciniak, 3 vols., Tokyo: The International Research Institute for
Advanced Buddhology, Soka University. 2019?.


With best wishes,

Seishi Karashima
