[INDOLOGY] Sciences and Tantra
Dear Professor Paturi,
thank you. Yes, I am looking also for such studies, which are more based on
hard sciences rather than on soft sciences.
I am also looking for some trans-disciplinary studies on Tantric
architectures (and arts) approached through the lens of geometry,
arithmetic, and algebra.
Best wishes,
Paolo
