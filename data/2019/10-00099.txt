generally regarded that these two enclitic verbs continue an inherited
situation shared with Sanskrit since it seems fairly clear that the law
of limitation - which with a few exceptions normally affects all nominal
as well as (finite) verbal accentual placement - clearly appears to be a
secondary innovation on the part of Greek. 
As a good recent descriptive guide to Greek accentuation, I would
recommend Philomen Probert's _A New Short Guide to the Accentuation of
Ancient Greek_ (Bristol, 2003). 
I hope this helps clarify your question. 
Kind regards,
