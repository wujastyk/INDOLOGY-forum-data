Dear friends,
I seem to recall from my student days that V?caspati Mi?ra was often treated as two: V?caspati Mi?ra I and V?caspati Mi?ra II.
However, it now seems that this doubling has disappeared and he is mostly treated as a single figure.
Can you refer me to any work that explicitly discusses and resolves the issue?
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
