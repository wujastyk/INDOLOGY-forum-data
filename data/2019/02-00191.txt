[INDOLOGY] Help needed with short passage in Sanskritized Gujarati
Dear all,
I am looking for help with translating a short passage written in 
Sanskritized Gujarati on a 19th-century Jaina gy?n b?z? chart (see 
original text in attachment):
???? ?? ?????? ??????? ???? ?????? ??? ???????(?) ????? ???????? ???? 
?????? ??? ???? ???? ???? ?? ?? ??? ???? ????? ?????????
My very tentative translation reads something along the lines of: "... 
one should perform the augury (Guj. sukan, Skt. ?akuna) of j??n caupa? 
... one should know the various kinds of omens with regard to trade 
(Guj. vy?p?ra = vep?ra?), (staying) at home or abroad ... and their 
auspicious and inauspicious results."
Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.
Kind regards,
Jacob
