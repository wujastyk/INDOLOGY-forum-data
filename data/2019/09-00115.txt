[INDOLOGY] Query on verse forms
In my naivety I have always assumed that k?tai (from Skt g?th?) in the titles of the Cilappatik?ram is a translation of Tamil p???u, "song", as in Pattupp???u, which latter collection is made up of "long" poems like the Cilappatik?ram chapters and as such differs from, for instance, the Ku?untokai.
