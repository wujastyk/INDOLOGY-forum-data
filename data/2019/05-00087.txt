		Greetings Richard Mahoney,

A new item has been posted in H-Asia.	
	
		
Natasha Heller: "The Uneven Terrain of Gender and Diversity: The View
from the Humanities," Ghent University, June 6
by Ben Van
Dear colleagues,
The Ghent Centre for Buddhist Studies at Ghent University, in
collaboration with the Centre for Research on Culture and Gender and
with support from the Ghent University Doctoral Schools and the
Tianzhu Foundation, is proud to present a lecture by Natasha Heller
(Associate Professor of Chinese Religions, University of Virginia).
This so-called "hot topic" lecture will take place within the context
of our doctoral school on "Women and Nuns in Chinese Buddhism." It
will take place on June 6, 2019; 19:00-21:00 in Auditorium P (Zaal
Jozef Plateau), Campus Boekentoren, Ghent University.
The lecture is open to all and is free of charge. There is no need to
register in advance. For directions, refer to the following link:

Abstract
Despite oft-expressed commitments to diversity, American institutions
of higher learning remain centered on white men.  If we agree that the
academy would better serve its purpose with a more diverse faculty,
how is such an aim achieved?  In this talk I will consider how we talk
about gender, diversity, and inclusion, and what these terms mean for
different stages and dimensions of academic life.  Through case
studies of the disciplines of Religious Studies and Asian Studies, I
will consider how the issues of gender and diversity vary in different
fields of study?and what this might teach us about the challenges of
transforming the academy into a more inclusive space.
Best regards,
Ben Van Overmeire
