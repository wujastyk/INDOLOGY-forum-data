Dear Rembert,

I'm sorry I won't be able to come to this one, having already had four interesting and pleasant 
days in Oxford, seeing friends as well as attending STIMW. I was very glad to see you. 
Thank you for all you've been doing for STIMW, and I hope the Vaishnavism conference 
goes well.

With best wishes,

Dermot
