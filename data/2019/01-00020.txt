Hosted by the only university in the world outside of Nepal where students can study Nepali and Newar, this workshop offers training in two languages that are key for studying Newar Buddhism and Hinduism in the Himalayas and beyond.  It will cover conversational Nepali in the mornings as well as conversational and literary Newar in the afternoons in two modules, which may be taken separately. Students on all levels are welcome. Language competence will be assessed on the first day and groups will be formed accordingly.



The instructor Laxmi Nath Shrestha is a widely acclaimed Nepali and Newar language teacher who over the last 40 years has taught several generations of Nepal Studies scholars. He has been conducting courses at universities in Heidelberg, Kiel, Lisbon, Vienna, and Z?rich.

Participation is free. Travel support is available for a limited number of students based outside the Greater Toronto Area.
