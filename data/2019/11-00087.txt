[INDOLOGY] Looking for two older (short) books on "Sadani"
Dear John and Richard,
the entry points to the State Library Berlin (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin).  
I just looked up their catalogue and it does list Whitley's work, but says  
that it was lost during war and use is impossible.
Sorry,
J?rgen
