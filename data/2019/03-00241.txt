[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
Clarification:
When I wrote "Incidentally, the avagraha? in the copper plate inscription is an instance, in Whitney?s terminology, of a hyphen. The text reads: v??numodeta.?, I meant that the avagraha? may serve as a device linking anumodeta as part of the previous phrase. Whitney expressly limits elision to -e + a- and -o + a-. If this interpretation has any merit, we may question that Buehler meant that v?'numodeta is an instance of elision. Whitney considers ? from a + a, ? + a, etc,. as coalescence rather than elision: "126. Two simple vowels, short or long, coalesce and form the corresponding long vowel?.? (Sanskrit Grammar, page 43).
Strictly speaking, Buehler did not identify v??numodeta as an example of elision. He noted only that the sign first appeared in the inscription, but did not say it marked an elision in the inscription: ?Die moderne Bezeichnung der Elision eines A, der sogenannte avagraha, kommt zuerst auf der Kupferplatte des R???rk?ta-Koenigs Dhruva von 834/5 p. Chr. vor.? (The modern sign for the elision of an initial A, the so-called Avagraha, has been traced first on the Barod? copper-plate of the R???rak??a king Dhruva, dated A.D. 834-35.? (English translation, page 111).
