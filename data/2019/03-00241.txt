Clarification:

When I wrote "Incidentally, the avagraha? in the copper plate inscription is an instance, in Whitney?s terminology, of a hyphen. The text reads: v??numodeta.?, I meant that the avagraha? may serve as a device linking anumodeta as part of the previous phrase. Whitney expressly limits elision to -e + a- and -o + a-. If this interpretation has any merit, we may question that Buehler meant that v?'numodeta is an instance of elision. Whitney considers ? from a + a, ? + a, etc,. as coalescence rather than elision: "126. Two simple vowels, short or long, coalesce and form the corresponding long vowel?.? (Sanskrit Grammar, page 43).

Strictly speaking, Buehler did not identify v??numodeta as an example of elision. He noted only that the sign first appeared in the inscription, but did not say it marked an elision in the inscription: ?Die moderne Bezeichnung der Elision eines A, der sogenannte avagraha, kommt zuerst auf der Kupferplatte des R???rk?ta-Koenigs Dhruva von 834/5 p. Chr. vor.? (The modern sign for the elision of an initial A, the so-called Avagraha, has been traced first on the Barod? copper-plate of the R???rak??a king Dhruva, dated A.D. 834-35.? (English translation, page 111).

A sign called the avagraha (separator) ? namely ? is occasionally used in the manuscripts, sometimes in the manner of a hyphen, sometimes as a mark of hiatus, sometimes to mark the elision of initial ? a after final ? e or ? o (135). In printed texts, especially European, it is ordinarily applied to the use last mentioned, and to that alone:thus ?????????? te?bruvan ?????????? so?brav?t for ?? ????????  te abruvan ?? ???????? so abrav?t.

I wonder if there are any studies about the use of avagraha? in manuscripts other than padap??ha? manuscripts. I have a sense that sometimes avagraha? is introduced into a manuscript copying tradition as a reader?s aid to interpretation.s

>> Dear Harry,

>>      You have raised an interesting question.  The term avagraha is used in older texts like the Pr?ti??khyas and ?ik??s to refer to a pause between members of compounds in the Padap??ha, and some texts like the ?aunak?ya-Catur?dhy?yik? (3.3.35: ?????????????????????????????? ?????????: ???:) assign the duration of a m?tr? to this type of avagraha.  The written sign of avagraha (?) in later times got extended to cases like ?????? and ??????, and yet I have not seen evidence for this extension in any of the phonetic texts, and to my knowledge there is no actual pause in recitation in these cases.  Such a pause would create difficulties with the meters.  How, when and why the term avagraha and the written sign (?) got extended to such uses needs to be investigated.  But it has no phonetic value as far as I know.

I wonder how hybrid this text is, or whether there are manuscript variants for this particular passage.  One thing I noticed is that if we keep the presumed pre-sandhi reading of "sahite asya," the meter does not work, and neither does it work with the regular sandhi "sahite 'sya."  The meter does seem to work with "sahita asya".  The last syllable of "sahita" needs to be metrically light.  So I suppose some sort of metrical compulsion may have resulted in this irregularity.  Just a thought.

>> Harry raised the same point about the metre (sv?gat?), but it wouldn't be difficult to rephrase the p?da so as to conform to both metre and standard sandhi (e.g., tena v?pi sahite 'sya ca labdhis). So I am left with the impression that Y?davas?ri must have considered his choice of sandhi in this case unproblematic, although he usually follows the stardard rule e + a > e ['].
