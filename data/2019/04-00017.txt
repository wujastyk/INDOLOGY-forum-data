[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Audrey,
Could we have some clarity first as to what the committee actually does?
Since the list is not moderated, the workload of the committee is not
transparent to me, except for the need to approve membership requests and
occasionally intervene when discussions go astray. Why would it be
justified to add more female members for the sake of gender parity, rather
than having, say, two members (with gender parity) managing the list?
Best wishes,
Aleksandar
