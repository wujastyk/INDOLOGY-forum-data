With apologies for what may be a fairly basic question, I wonder if 
anyone can direct me to an English-language (or German, or French at a 
pinch) source discussing the formation of adjectives such as ghan?ghana. 
(I assume that there are other such instances, though none comes 
immediately to mind.) B?htlingk/Roth and Monier-Williams give references 
to P??ini (6.1.12) etc., but I could do with something a little more 
accessible.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions,
Martin Gansten
