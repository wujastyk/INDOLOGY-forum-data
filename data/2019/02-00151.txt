See Kane?s History of Dharma??stra, Vol. 1, pp. 127?136 for the H?r?ta Dharmas?tra, with further bibliography and attempts to reconstruct it by S. C. Banerjee. Kane also mentions your 30-ch version, a ms. of which was found in Nasik by Islampurkar.

Dear all,
I've fallen into a bit of a rabbit hole looking into the dharmas?tra/dharma??stra attributed to H?r?ta. Julius Jolly, in 1896, writes about a 17th-century manuscript of this text, complete in 30 chapters:
https://books.google.ca/books?id=RhsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false
But it does not seem to have ever been published. However, I found this 1994 book that seems to make reference to specific passages from the 30th chapter of the H?r?ta Dharmas?tra:
https://books.google.ca/books?id=idERT6Tg4MMC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39#v=onepage&q&f=false
This definitely seems to be referring to the abovementioned 30-chapter text, rather than to shorter works attributed to H?r?ta (such as the H?r?tasa?hit?, Laghuh?r?tasm?ti, V?ddhah?r?tasm?ti, etc.) Does anyone know if any work has been done on the H?r?ta Dharmas?tra in the past hundred years or so? Jolly published a collection of quotations from it in 1890 (Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der K?niglich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 18), but I have been unable to access it.
Thanks,
Charles
