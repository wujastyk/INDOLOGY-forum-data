Dear INDOLOGY List,

If you will be at the AAR meeting on Monday the 25th, please plan to join us at an exploratory session on "The Mah?bh?rata: A Text for Classical Hinduism.? We will seek to establish whether sufficient interest exists to justify the creation of a five-year seminar dedicated to the Mah?bh?rata. Rather than present papers, we will articulate the case for such a seminar, soliciting participation from fellow AAR members. Details below.
