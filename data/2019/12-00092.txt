[INDOLOGY] Bookworm quotation
That is why we had placed the following verse at the entrance of the  
former Indological library in Marburg:
udak?nalacaurebhyo m??akebhyo vi?e?ata?
ka??ena likhita? ??stra? yatnena parip?layet
(B?htlingk, Indische Spr?che, Nr. 1227 = Subh??it?r?ava 96)
Cheers,
Roland Steiner
