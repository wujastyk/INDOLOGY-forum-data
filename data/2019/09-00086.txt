Subject: [INDOLOGY] Accusative of direction
Message-ID: <21a24c1c-c712-7d57-ac9e-fe093781d28b@gmx.de>

Dear all,

this question probably has an obvious answer, but I don't find it:
Let's say we have a sentence like rAmo vanaM pravizati, where the acc.
vanam expresses the goal of a motion verb.

Are there any papers or any clues from the grammatical tradition that
could tell if the accusative vanam was "felt" like a real object in
actual language use (as the sun in "I see the sun"), or rather
considered as some kind of adverbial non-core argument to the verb?

Any hint is highly appreciated.

Best, Oliver
