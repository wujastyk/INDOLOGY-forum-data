THE NEW CLUSTER ROOTS ? SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND CULTURAL CONNECTIVITY
IN PAST SOCIETIES in the frame of the German Excellence Initiative
explores social, environmental, and cultural processes that have
substantially shaped past human development (and which are still active
today). Research is organized in six research units (i.e. subclusters)
covering six foci: (1) Environmental hazards and impacts; (2) Dietary
intake and disease; (3) Knowledge production, technology, and
innovation; (4) Population agglomeration and urbanisation; (5) Social
differentiation and inequalities; and (6) Conflict and conciliation. The
ROOTS 'Reflective Turn' will enable cross-disciplinary dialogue and
enquiries within and between research foci, providing an overarching
theoretical frame. 
The Research Associates and Doctoral positions participate in the ROOTS
Young Academy. The ROOTS Young Academy brings together young experts
from an array of disciplines, which support ROOTS research with
innovative research ideas. The Young Academy provides young researchers
with excellent conditions for a successful career and personal
development. 
Therefore, we invite applications for the following positions to begin
as early as possible: [...] 
Candidates are invited to submit proposals for PhD research projects
addressing one or more of the following themes of ROOTS (as assigned to
one of the six ROOTS subclusters):

13PHD DOCTORAL POSITION: SOCIO-LINGUISTIC METHODS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 
PROFILE: Historical Linguistics, Methods of Quantitative Linguistics,
Sociolinguistics 
The successful candidate shall conduct work on linguistic aspects of
social stratification in NORTH INDIA from a historical perspective, with
special reference to the EASTERN GANGES BASIN. She/He will work in close
cooperation with scholars from both general linguistics as well as from
archaeology, taking not only theoretical sociolinguistic aspects of
historical language stratification into account but also aspects of
material culture. Research will address these aspects in different
social and economic groups from this region, e.g. hunter and gatherer
societies (or social groups which until recently fell within this group
and have since changed to a more sedentary lifestyle), farming
communities, and others. 
Integration into the research agenda of 'ROOTS of social inequality' is
expected as well as co-operation with other subclusters. The position
offers for cooperation with the Doctoral Positions 12PHD, 16PHD, 17PHD,
18PHD as well as with the Research Associate Position 08RA. 
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: Eligible candidates must hold an outstanding
university degree (MA or equivalent) in General Linguistics,
Indo-European Linguistics or in a related linguistic field with a focus
on historical linguistics. The successful candidate will have a keen
interest in historical linguistics, which can also be demonstrated by
his / her publications, and will be familiar with various quantitative
methods in linguistics. Complementary expertise in historical
sociolinguistics and/or in the area of language contact will be an
asset. Knowledge of a modern South Asian language is desirable and/or
the willingness to obtain a basic knowledge of spoken and written Hindi
within the first six months of the grant.
