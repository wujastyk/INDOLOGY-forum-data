Dear list members,
In verse 3 of the ?dy?k?lik?stotram (hundred names of Kali)
k?p?may? k?p?dh?r? k?p?p?r? k?p?gam? |
k???nu? kapil? k???? k????nandavivarddhin? || 3 ||
I've seen k????nandavivarddhin? translated as "the one who increases the
bliss of Krishna", but it seemed strange to me that the god Krishna would
be mentioned in a hymn to Kali (or is it?).  Are there other translations
of  k????nandavivarddhin? that would  make more sense in this context?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
