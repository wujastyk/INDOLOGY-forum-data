Dear Artur, Lubom?r, and Richard,
Many thanks for your inputs. Adheesh Sathaye suggested off-list that 
k??h? could be related to Marathi k??ha or k??h? which means edge, bank, 
etc. Since the paintings derive from the village of Siriyari in Marwar 
just a few kilometers from the border to Mewar, it would make good sense 
if the readings "m?rv?? k??h?," "m?rv?? (k??h?)," and "mulk m?rv?? 
k??h?" all indicated the Marwar border region.
Best regards,
Jacob
