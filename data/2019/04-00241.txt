[INDOLOGY] Joydeep Bagchee's membership to INDOLOGY
I absolutely second the postings of Arlo Griffith, Walter Slaje,  
Birgit Kellner and Andrew Ollett. We should read Joydeep Bagchee's  
message as professionals, namely as philologists, and thus cannot but  
regard his posting as full of inacceptable insinuations.
With best regards,
Roland Steimer
