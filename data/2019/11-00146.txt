I think the best place to start is the book, Sanskrit Syntax, edited by Peter Scharf, which contains a number of articles, but most pertinently, a bibliography of works on Sanskrit syntax by Hans Hock.

Cordially yours,

Hi all?
A colleague has asked me to recommend scholarship (monograph, essay, review article) that provides an overview on the nexus of Sanskrit, modern linguistics, and/or the philosophy of language. Any recommendations from this list?especially works accessible to the non-specialist?would be much appreciated.

Yours,
