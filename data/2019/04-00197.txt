[INDOLOGY] On Adhyash.
 Dear Alakendu Das,
If you had not written that "superimposition" is a translation of adhyash,
I would not have recognized what word you meant by adhyash. It is always
helpful to use the standard transliteration for Sanskrit words, in this
case adhy?sa; or if you do not have access to unicode characters, then
adhyaasa or adhyAsa would work.
Already in George Thibaut's 1890 translation of *The Ved?nta-s?tras with
the Commentary by ?a?kar?c?rya*, Part 1, "superimposition" was used for adhy
?sa (p. 4, etc.). Swami Gambhirananda, too, in his 1965 translation of
*Brahma-s?tra-bh??ya
of ?r? ?a?kar?c?rya* used "superimposition" for adhy?sa (p. 2, etc.). This
seems to be one of those cases where the English translation of a Sanskrit
term, "superimposition" for adhy?sa, is so good that everyone adopted it. I
have not taken note of other translations of adhy?sa.
However, if a simpler translation is wanted, such as for
English-as-a-second-language speakers who may not know the word
"superimposition," one could use "false attribution," the definition of adhy
?sa given in Apte's Sanskrit-English dictionary.
