[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
This is an absolutely great find! I have no idea why I have never looked up Candranandana in Naudou (it?s a bit embarrassing I know).
Anyway, given the overall quality of the available Sanskrit text, it is entirely possible (and very likely, i think) that ?r?macchakunadevena?(see my previous email) is a corruption (possibly, deliberate ?improvement?) of the original??r?matthakkanadevena.
best,
Andrey
