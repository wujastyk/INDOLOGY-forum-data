Dear colleagues,I read different views on the personality of Pt Vachaspati Misra.As far as Pandit project is concerned it creates utter confusion.I would like to clarify it as I belong to the Mithila region to which Pt.Vachaspati Misra belonged.May be manyPersons of this name but two Vachaspati Misras were famous.Vachaspati I (Senior) certainly flourished in the 9th Century as he wrote? the Bhamati comm. on Shankara's(8th cent.)bhasya and Tatparya tika on? the Nyayavarttika.Udayanacharya(10th cent.) Wrote Parishuddhi on his Tatparya tika.He wrote on all theistic branches of Indian Philosophy but not a single book on Dharmashastra.Vachaspati II( Junior) flourished in the 1st half of 15th Century.He was born after the advent of Navya Nyaya and wrote many books on Dharmasastra and also a few books on the Navya Nyaya.For details books may be consulted as under:1.History of Navya Nyaya in Mithila-D.C.Bhattacharya2.Sanskrit Vanmaya ka brihat Itihasa-NyayaBoth available on Archive.org.Girish K.JhaRetd.

Thanks to Elliot Stern, Isabelle Rati?,
 and Dominik Wujastyk for confirming that rumors of a single V?caspatimi?ra were indeed? "fake news." I must admit that I was not quite aware of the Pandit Project and look forward to exploring it more fully.

Dear friends,
I seem to recall from my student days that
V?caspati Mi?ra was often treated as two: V?caspati Mi?ra I and
V?caspati Mi?ra II.
However, it now seems that this doubling has disappeared and he is mostly treated as a single figure.
Can you refer me to any work that explicitly discusses and resolves the issue?
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
