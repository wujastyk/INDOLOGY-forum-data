Dear Dr Truschke
I am sure that there are many members of this list who are concerned. But I
confess that with the (lack of) information you provide, it is impossible
for me either to understand what is actually going on, or what you suggest
be done to correct the situation.
I do not mean this in any way to be dismissive; it is a request for further
information, and a proposed way forward.
