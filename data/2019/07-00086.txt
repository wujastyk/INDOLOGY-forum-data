[INDOLOGY] Nagarjun - Ayurvedic Journal
Dear List,
While Nagarjun vol 2. from 1959 is available at archive.org 
(https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.19824) I was not able to 
find vol. 1 which was probably published in 1958. Does anyone know if 
there exists a digital copy of this volume?
Kind regards,
Vitus Angermeier
