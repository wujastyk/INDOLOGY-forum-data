                Sorry, I mistitled that earlier thread.
Does anyone know the origin of the term and concept that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya", eternal and uncreated by humans?I have heard it might have originated in Karma Mimamsa.Also, any information about how it was conceived, discussed and debated would be appreciated.Thanks,Dean
