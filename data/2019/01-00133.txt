Subject: [INDOLOGY] Passing Away of Prof. Dr. Chlodwig Werba!

I am deeply saddened to learn from of Chlodwig's death.  I am shocked,
because he was only in his early sixties and seemed vigorous and engaged
with life, the last time I saw him.  During my years as one of his
colleagues at the South Asia Institute in Vienna, I had many conversations
with Chlodwig.  He was a deep mine of information on matters connected with
comparative and historical Indo-Aryan philology, the kind of precious
colleague one consults and depends upon for trustworthy specialist
information.  Chlodwig often shared with me his reflections on classical
music, which moved him deeply.  On more general topics - never philology! -
we sometimes disagreed, even vigorously, but we always found reconciliation
after a few minutes and our relations remained strongly cordial.  Chlodwig
was an intense and passionate man, who loved Sanskrit and Indology as much
as he loved classical music and his own instrument, the pianoforte, that
afforded him joy and fulfilment beyond words.   It is hard to know that he
is no longer with us.
