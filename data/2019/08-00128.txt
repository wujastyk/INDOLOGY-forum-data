and type in word order sanskrit on google and you will find more.
One of my countrymen has written a phd thesis on this topic but at the moment his name does not come to my mind.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Skt./Pkt. prose word order
Dear friends and colleagues,
I am still puzzled sometimes by the word order in prose dialogues of
early Sanskrit and Prakrit stage plays and other prose compositions. And
I am sure there are more studies on this than J.S. Speijer's Sanskrit
Syntax. Can you please refer me to some of these?
