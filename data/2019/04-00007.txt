[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Audrey,
I am sure that there are a thousand things that can be improved. I think I
know how you feel. Please see the following clause in one of the jobs I
applied for, in Vienna, realted to Indology:
The University pursues *a non-discriminatory employment policy* and values
So much for non-discrimination.
Best wishes,
Aleix
