[INDOLOGY] Easy unicode for ipad?
Hello,
I have underestimated the submission process length, but in case you cannot
use keyboard or install software, I have made a simple online add-in for
Word/PowerPoint that you can use to enter the diacritics (unless your
organization disabled using Office add-ins).
Windows and Mac: Go to Insert tab > Get Add-Ins and search for Indic
Online in browser: Go to Insert tab > Add-ins > Store and search for Indic
iPad: In landscape mode, go to Insert tab > Add-ins > All > search for Indic
Add the add-in and you should get a taskpane with character buttons, see
http://apps.ujca.cz/IndicInputWebPane/ for a screenshot.
It's not a great typing experience but better than nothing.
Hope this helps,
Jan

[INDOLOGY] Easy unicode for ipad?
Hello
Has anyone found a way to type Sanskrit diacritics in MS-Word on the Ipad?
So far my attempts have been fruitless.
Cheers
