[INDOLOGY] EasyUnicode for a Windows computer?
Dear all,
Many thanks for your advice. This gives me some options to tie me over until I can use a Mac again. I will attempt to program shortcuts using the same keyboard layout as the EasyUnicode keyboard uses. If I can make it work, there will be no need to learn another layout. 
Best wishes,
Anya
