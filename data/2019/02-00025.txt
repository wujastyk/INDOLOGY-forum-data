Dear Rich,

I was also considering this possibility, but the problem is that, as far as I know, in Bengali this word is never used with retroflex '?ha', in standard Bengali it is always k??th? (and in Hindi it is also not retroflexed: ka?th?), coming, as you say, from Sanskrit kanth?.

Even various Middle Bengali forms (keth?, ky??th?, ky??t?, kh??t?, ky?th?, k?nth?, etc.) are never retroflexed. But I do not know phonological rules of Marwari or Rajasthani, perhaps this change is possible.

Best,
Lubomir
