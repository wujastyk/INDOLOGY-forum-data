[INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
Dear Martin, an afterthought: I had a look at the Cre-A Dictionary of Tamil, s.v. ca?iya?, (a ca?i-like person) "a term of abuse used when sth. or s.o. is considered troublesome or unwelcome; an expression conveying impatience." But, again, no proverb.

Thank you for this -- but no, there was no implicit question intended: I
was simply interested in having the existence of this expression
confirmed and learning how widespread it might be.
Best wishes,
Martin G.
