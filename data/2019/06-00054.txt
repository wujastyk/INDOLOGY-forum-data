[INDOLOGY] Studies on the Rigveda [Addendum: Table of Contents]
Dear All,
Thank you for this info and the previous ones concerning the Rgvedic topic.
I think that it is high time to organize a round-table on the Rgveda at
which various scholars could meet. I know very well that my work is simply
ignored by some scholar (for the moment I will not reveal their names,
although some of you probably know them). To be ignored is even worse than
to be criticized.
So at such a round-table meeting I would expect a fierce discussion with
fruitful conclusions which will open new perspectives in our research. No
exclusive, but inclusive. We, Poles, are good in organizing round-tables
debates, the fall of communism in the Eastern Europe began with such a
debate 30 years ago.
Regards,
Joanna
P.S. I am sorry for my mistakes in English. My mother tongue is Polish and,
although I have made a lot of effort to learn English as well as I could,
 my thoughts and feelings are expressed in Polish in the best way.
Unfortunately, it is me who has to learn foreign language to be
internationally recognized, and not many of you (if you are German or
French, you can also present  your research in your languages) . But the
fact that your languages are in use  is the matter of chance or power. It
has nothing to do with quality of my research.
