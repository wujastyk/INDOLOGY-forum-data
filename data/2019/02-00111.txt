[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Sri Shrinivasa Varakhedi Acharya Ji
Thanks a lot for the feedback.
We will reduce the size of anusvAra, yes the overlapping etc of 'u' will be
fixed.
space with conjunct consonants are debated, some suggested to retain, and
some to remove. we will work on both types.
rest we will work on it.
Thanks a lot
