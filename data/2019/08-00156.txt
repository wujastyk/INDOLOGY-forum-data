[INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
Dear Martin, I have not found the saying in Rev. Herman Jensen, A Classified Collection of Tamil Proverbs. A Bilingual Edition, Delhi 2002 (reprint)., which has a section on ca?i (nos. 2234-2241) and a word index which refers to nos. 199, 2240, 2318 and 2322.

Thank you for this -- but no, there was no implicit question intended: I
was simply interested in having the existence of this expression
confirmed and learning how widespread it might be.
Best wishes,
Martin G.
