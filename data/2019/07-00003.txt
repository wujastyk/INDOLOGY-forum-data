[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  About Godwin
I have been reading the thread about AAIS, rules of conduct, and Godwin with increasing concern, as ad-hominem attacks and arguments of ?guilt by association? have been proliferating.
A.F.?s message is for me the breaking point; its use of foul and anti-woman language is totally unacceptable.
I hope that those in charge of moderating can find a way to turn the list back to issues of scholarship?the most important and precious feature of the list, so that Indology messages won?t automatically go into my junk file.
With best wishes,
Hans Henrich Hock

@ Antonia Ruppel
Obviously, you're a total leftist shithead.
To start with, Nazis were Socialists. They have nothing to do with the Right or even less with the Far-Right, whatever that means.
So you "mail" is nothing but allout Marxist crap.
So I would call the NiwBitch on your mail.
With Best Regards.

It should also be pointed out that the discussion has gone beyond Godwin's Law to Niwdog's law (Godwin reversed):  this is when a discussion member claims Godwin's law in a case where the person called a Nazi for all intents and purposes is a Nazi, where someone called a right-wing extremist actually is a right-wing extremist, etc. This is the common name for what Hans pointed out in relation to the Godwin's Law Wikipedia entry.
And so I call Niwdog's Law on Arnaud's original email.

yes, precisely so
IMHO, the issue is that there are authorized insults like "far-right" or "racist" and non-authorized insults like "asshole", "bastard", etc.
The first set usually escapes moderation censureship, while the other set is usually not accepted.
Best regards

Dear Dean,
It's a reference to Godwin's law<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Godwin-2527s-5Flaw&d=DwMDaQ&c=OCIEmEwdEq_aNlsP4fF3gFqSN-E3mlr2t9JcDdfOZag&r=8XW93a7mvanPUF6SW7S4oo90CkU27R7GDHOT-5Cp2LY&m=ltRKZRICvYcjwO-g-sVIBA0hEorhgUbj6jpszqS4diM&s=CEfH-2UE6EtjfEEkjmKLp0_RyYCTwql0JfqXIahAtIE&e=>, "if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds".

Could you please clarify your point for us who are Godwin-deprived?

yes, I agree that jerks who overuse the word "far-right" should rather
create their own list somewhere else.
