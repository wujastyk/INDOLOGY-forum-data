[INDOLOGY] DCS data (CoNLLU-X)
Dear all,
most of the DCS is now available in a CoNLLU-derived format at:
https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/dcs/data/conllu
More information in the readme file. If you have PhD (or whatever)
students interested in NLP, please consider to forward the information.
If you find systematic errors in the data, please send me a short mail.
For those working with the RV and interested if Arnold (1905) had the
right intuitions: I compiled the words he considered to be of early or
late origin in three separate files that can be found here:
https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/dcs/data/rigveda/Arnold
Using the CoNLLU files of the RV, it should be easy to verify if, for
instance, words Arnold considered to be late occur preferably in
Oldenberg's appendices.
Best, Oliver
Oliver Hellwig, IVS Z?rich
