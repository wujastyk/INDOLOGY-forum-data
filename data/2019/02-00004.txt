[INDOLOGY] Extension of Sanskrit Heritage tools with connection to Amba Kulkarni's parser
Dear G?rard,
Congratulations on updating your non-paninian generative device!
Something is indeed still going wrong with
"ana?uh"
However, in the case of "ubhaya", the lexical information that "ubhaya" in
dual is very rare (though acc. to MW not entirely unattested) is a
lexicographic annotation which does not affect the grammatical generation
of its forms.
And, logically, "two" is the lower limit of the number of separate things
that can be "of two kinds"... which ubhau would express as being simply two
in number, not also as "of two kinds"...
Best, Jan
