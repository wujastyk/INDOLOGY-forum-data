[INDOLOGY] Joydeep Bagchee's membership to INDOLOGY
I respectfully disagree as to the assessment of Joydeep Bagchee's 
posting. The posting contained several personal attacks on individual 
scholars, and it did in this respect clearly violate the list's 
guidelines (http://indology.info/email/email-const/). One can certainly 
criticize certain hiring practices at universities (though I fail to see 
how this would be a specifically Indological topic), as Joydeep Bagchee 
did, but this can surely be done in a constructive manner and without 
ad-hominem attacks.
With best regards,
Birgit Kellner
