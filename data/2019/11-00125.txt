[INDOLOGY] New publication
Dear all,
I would like to draw your attention to a publication that has just
appeared and may be relevant for those interested in the chronology of
the Mahabharata:
O. Hellwig: Dating Sanskrit texts using linguistic features and neural
networks. In: Indogermanische Forschungen (2019), 1-45
Chapter 5 discusses chronological evidence for the Bhishmaparvan of the
Mbh, including the BhG and the composition of the battle description in
Book 6.
Sorry for the self-advertisement, and best wishes, Oliver
Oliver Hellwig, IVS Z?rich
