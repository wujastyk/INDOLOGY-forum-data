[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Hobson Jobson Dictionary
Dear Antonia,
That is the Teltscher edition I was mentioning, that is described as a
*selected edition* on the title page.
Besides, it consists of 624 pages only, while I know of editions that
consist of 1000-odd pages: a further reason to believe that it is actually
abridged.
All the best,
GP
