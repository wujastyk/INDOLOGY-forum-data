Subject: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Message-ID: <ECEE5073-A116-404C-AFFA-ADB560FC875B@gmail.com>

Hi 

Does anyone have a definitive date for Candranandana, author of the commentary Am?tah?daya A????ga Guhyopade?atantra on V?gbha?a?s A????gah?daya (or A??h??gasa?hit?)?  According to the Tibetan medical history tradition, as reported in "The Origin of the rGyud bzhi: A Tibetan Medical Tantra? by Todd Fenner (https://www.thlib.org/encyclopedias/literary/genres/genres-book.php#!book=/studies-in-genres/b27/dn3/), Vairocana studied with him in Kashmir, and translated this text into Tibetan, and presented it to King Trisong Detsen (Tibetan: ????????????????), who ruled (according to Wikipedia) 755 CE until 797 or 804 CE.  

Dr. Fenner?s history would place Candranandana in the late 8th century CE.  Has this account been further confirmed?

Cheers
James
