Dear Friends,
does anyone know specifically in the BhG where the comparison of the
P???avas occurs with each relevant cakra? I've just read through a bunch of
websites and blogs and youtube videos by prominent gurus and other less
prominent people. But, none actually mention any specific verses. They just
say either the MBh or the BhG is the source. It seems odd, didn't the cakra
system develop well after either of these texts were composed? That would
make it kind of hard for them to include talk of cakras, etc, no?
Particularly the neo-Romantic, new agey way of describing the virtues and
psycho-dynamic qualities of each cakra and what they symbolize.
I've gone through the BhG from Gretil, also looking for tattvas or any
similar word that might help. I just can't seem to spot where this is
mentioned. Is it? Am I blind?  Or is this is much later interpolation
linking the brothers, Draupadi, Krishna, etc to various metaphysical
locations? If you are curious, here is one example of the description in
Hind <http://trsukul.blogspot.com/2015/03/>i. (Shown below). This is also
an English description by AoL

If this is just another factoid floating around Yogaland, does anyone know
when this idea might have first been generated?
Thanks.
All the best,
