[INDOLOGY] Kusumamala at USA inter library loan help
Dear all
I am forwarding the reply I received from Pennsylvania Library USA,
My library doesn't allow to put forward the interlibrary loan request, in
fact they are not aware of that and I am failed to convince the curator.
That's is the reason on personal mail I requested.
I wonder, could any one take the hassle here to help me out for the scan. I
will bear all the costs incurred. Your help is highly admired.
The Kususmamala Vol 2 available on archive is not 1st edition.

RE: Request for Scan Copy
Dear Krishna Prasad,
We do have this book and do provide scanning services.  Please have the
interlibrary loan department of your university contact us at this email to
inquire about placing a request.  We can only fill requests from
universities, not from individual patrons.
Very best regards,

Dear Curator
I am Krishna Prasad research student at Karnataka Samskrit University
Bangalore. I am searching for Kusumamala Vol 2 1891 edition. I happened to
that the book is in your library collection through world catalog. I would
be glad to know is there any facility to get the book scanned. Could you
please confirm the facility.
Thanks
Yours sincerely
KP
