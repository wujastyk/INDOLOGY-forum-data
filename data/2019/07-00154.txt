I'm writing now mainly to solicit your views and ask whether you'd be prepared to mobilise your respective networks (of academics and others) to put their names to such a letter, once a text is agreed. In the face of a well-funded mining lobby, we clearly need to up our game in putting a case for preservation of Mes Aynak. From the perspective of Kabul, communicating a shared concern of a wide range of well-informed Afghan and international cultural specialists in an 'open letter' to the President might contribute to a more balanced assessment of the options his government faces. 

I look forward to hearing from you with your views. 

Best, 

Jolyon

> [SNIP] Royce. If we can cast our net wider and get more academics to sign up, I believe that it'll lend additional weight to the initiative. I attach the latest iteration of the 'open letter' - I don't envisage major changes so it's probably best to circulate among your network now so that they can get the gist of what we're petitioning for and offering.

> Jonathan, I agree that Academia.edu might be a good platform once we've delivered the letter to the Palace and the relevant Ministries. This implies that the list of signatories will by then be finalised, so maybe we can think of a two-stage process, asking additional people to express their support in some way. Given my limited connectivity, is this something that either of you would be in a position to assist with?
