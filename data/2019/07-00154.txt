I'm writing now mainly to solicit your views and ask whether you'd be prepared to mobilise your respective networks (of academics and others) to put their names to such a letter, once a text is agreed. In the face of a well-funded mining lobby, we clearly need to up our game in putting a case for preservation of Mes Aynak. From the perspective of Kabul, communicating a shared concern of a wide range of well-informed Afghan and international cultural specialists in an 'open letter' to the President might contribute to a more balanced assessment of the options his government faces. 
I look forward to hearing from you with your views. 
Best, 
Jolyon
