Dear Alakendu,
There are several English translations. The best known is perhaps the "Little Clay Cart" of the American Sanskritist Arthur Ryder, first published in 1905.
cordially,
Matthew

Dr.Kapstein,
I rue that I saw this post so late.It's indeed awe-inspiring.! I feel there exists an English version of MrchhaKatikam, namely The Clay Cart.I shall confirm it.

[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit drama in La Belle ?poque
Dear Indologists,
You may find this to be amusing.
Visiting the huge exhibition of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec currently on view at the Grand Palais in Paris, I was surprised to find, amidst his many posters for theater and cabaret, the one I include here, for a production of the
M?cchaka?ik?, - the title is even given in devanagari at lower right. If you read carefully, you'll see that TL himself is credited with the sets for the fifth act, though I do not know if any trace of these survives, or if it was photographed. They must have been wonderful!
