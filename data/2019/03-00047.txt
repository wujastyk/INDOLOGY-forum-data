[INDOLOGY] The Mirror in Vedic India: Its ancient use and present relevance in dating texts
Dear Dominik,
Thank you for pointing out this recurring slip of mind:  I repeatedly (pp. 3, 4, 21 and 23 [thrice]) wrongly write ?k??a- when I mean ?dar?a- ?mirror?.  Dear colleagues, please excuse this mistake and note the correction.
With best wishes, Asko
