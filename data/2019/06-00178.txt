Dear Bill,

You must be right when saying that "the 28-nak?atra system may also 
likely postdate the 27 one". Actually, the Ved??ga-jyoti?a (VJ), which 
has only 27 n., uses the beginning of n.?ravi??h? and the middle of 
n.??le?? as winter and summer solstices respectively, which places the 
astronomical data of the VJ around 1150 BC. The Gargasa?hit? and the 
Pait?mahasiddh?nta, summarized by Var?hamihira, are similar, but the 
jain works Jyoti?akara??a and S?ryapraj?apti replace n.?ravi??? by 
n.?rava?a and add n.Abhijit (Vega) to the zodiac. On the other hand, the 
S?ryapraj?apti puts the winter solstice at the beginning of n.Abhijit, 
which makes a difference of 17,3? with the beginning of n. ?ravi??h? 
(VJ), that is 1246 years after VJ (see G.Thibaut, ? On the 
S?ryapraj?apti ?, JASB (1880), p.117).

Best,

>> Dear colleagues,

>> I wonder if anyone could point me to any recent research on the
>> history of Brahm? as a deity in early Vedic (pre-Buddhist) sources.
>> I am aware of Bailey?s The mythology of Brahm?, where he
>> described his origin as the apotheosization of the brahm? priest in
>> the ?rauta sacrifice. I am also aware of Thieme?s very thorough
>> study on the _Br?hman _in his _Kleine Schriften_ (Teil I), where
>> the the original senses and etymology as in RV are discussed. I am
>> however still somewhat puzzled about the presence of Brahm? as a
>> deity in the early Vedic sa?hit?s.
>> 
>> This puzzle came about when I was going through the list of _
>> nak?atras_ in all the Vedic sources, which give either 27 or 28.
>> The difference between 27 and 28 lies in the _nak?atra_ _Abhijit_,
>> which is always associated with Brahm?. If Brahm? has a late
>> origin, it is likely then an interpolation, and the 28-nak?atra
>> system may also likely postdate the 27 one. But before I proceed on
>> this line of analysis, I would appreciate it if anyone could
>> enlighten me on Brahm? as an deity in the early Vedic sources,
