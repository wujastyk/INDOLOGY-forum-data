Dear Bill,
You must be right when saying that "the 28-nak?atra system may also 
likely postdate the 27 one". Actually, the Ved??ga-jyoti?a (VJ), which 
has only 27 n., uses the beginning of n.?ravi??h? and the middle of 
n.??le?? as winter and summer solstices respectively, which places the 
astronomical data of the VJ around 1150 BC. The Gargasa?hit? and the 
Pait?mahasiddh?nta, summarized by Var?hamihira, are similar, but the 
jain works Jyoti?akara??a and S?ryapraj?apti replace n.?ravi??? by 
n.?rava?a and add n.Abhijit (Vega) to the zodiac. On the other hand, the 
S?ryapraj?apti puts the winter solstice at the beginning of n.Abhijit, 
which makes a difference of 17,3? with the beginning of n. ?ravi??h? 
(VJ), that is 1246 years after VJ (see G.Thibaut, ? On the 
S?ryapraj?apti ?, JASB (1880), p.117).
