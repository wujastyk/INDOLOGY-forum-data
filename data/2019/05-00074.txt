Dear Friends
Help! I am in the final stages of trying to sort out a bibliography of the known Dharmapada and Ud?navarga literature. I innocently thought the surviving Tocharian fragments of the Ud?navarga were all in Tocharian A (e.g. the ones collected in http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/tocharic/thtind10.htm <http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/tocharic/thtind10.htm>). But now I have come across MIcha?l Peyrot?s article on Sanskrit-Tocharian B Ud?navarga fragments. https://www.academia.edu/10462642/Peyrot_2008_More_Sanskrit_Tocharian_B_bilingual_Ud?navarga_fragments?auto=download <https://www.academia.edu/10462642/Peyrot_2008_More_Sanskrit_Tocharian_B_bilingual_Ud%C4%81navarga_fragments?auto=download> 
Were there two distinct Tocharian versions of the Ud?navarga? And are all the surviving fragments bilingual Sanskrit-Tocharian? The deadline looms...
Many thanks -
