Dear Colleagues,
On behalf of a Colleague in residence there, I draw your attention on the opportunity of a 9th months funded sabbatical or senior postdoctoral research stay in humanities or social sciences (including Indology/Indian studies) at the French "Institut d'?tudes avanc?es de Nantes" (Nantes city is 2 hours train from Paris):

(call for applications - 2020-2021 Fellowships - Closing date: 30 April 2019)
Among the Alumni you will find several scholars from India and, as far I can see, two members from our List.
Best wishes
