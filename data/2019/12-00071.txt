Dear Aaron,
In my article "The Mah?bh?rata after the Great Battle", WZKS XLVIII (2004, app. 2005) I deal with Yudhi??hira, who is the only one of the P???avas to arrive in heaven with his body because he is without sin (see p. 36).
I think (but am not certain) you may find a pdf of this article on my website.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] sa?ar?ra
Dear list members,
I am wondering about appearances of the word "sa?ar?ra" and/or "sva?ar?ra" in various contexts.  I have encountered sa?ar?ra/sva?ar?ra in the episodes of Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka from the V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a, but would be curious to know of other places where these or similar concepts show up.  In both of these episodes, the goal of Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka is to enter some sort of heavenly realm or divine form (variously referred to as divam, gatim, svargam, devatvam etc.) with their body.  Also in these episodes, Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka have gone rogue to engage in tapas as a way of achieving this goal.
An example from each of the R?m?ya?a episodes:
guru??pak?ta? r?pa? yad ida? tvayi vartate |
anena saha r?pe?a sa?ar?ro gami?yasi || VR 1.58.4 (Tri?a?ku episode)
??drayony?? pras?to 'smi tapa ugra? sam?sthita? |
devatva? pr?rthaye r?ma sa?ar?ro mah?ya?a? || VR 7.67.2 (?amb?ka episode)
I am especially curious about the use of "sa?ar?ra" in similar ways, but I am open to any use of the term from the literature at large.
With thanks in advance,
Aaron
