[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear Roland,
Unfortunately, Meulenbeld gives far too much credit to the legendary accounts of the Tibetan G.yu-thog-pa tradition, which, so far as I can see, are without historical value in the matter we are considering.
best,
Matthew

Re: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear Andrey,
Very possible, seems to me. In ??rad?, the two ak?aras tha and ?a are
semi-homograph. One could, therefore, speculate whether Thakkana was
first misread to ?akkana/?akuna and then improved to ?akuna. But it's
just speculation, not more.
Nevertheless, it is also worth reading the section on Candranandana in
Meulenbeld's "History of Indian Medicine" (see attachment).
Best wishes,
Roland
