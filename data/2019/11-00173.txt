[INDOLOGY] New book
Of course, dearest Professor Olivelle! Thanks for reminding us of Hallesey?s translation. Not to mention Norman?s oeuvre.
In my work I present also the (compelling, enthralling, and at time troubled) story/history of the birth of the Order of the nuns (bhikkhun?-sa?gha), and a summary of the Buddha?s teachings.
Two useful additions, I hope...
With the highest esteem, Yours Daniela
