Dear colleagues,
With apologies for cross-posting to RISA and Indology, I am very happy to
say that the Asian Division of the Library of Congress has a new vacancy
announcement for a South Asia reference librarian or a Southeast Asia
reference librarian! To be clear, this is one position designed for those
with expertise in either South Asia or Southeast Asia.
The application is on USAJOBS:

The South Asia librarian should have a background in one or more South
Asian countries, preferably Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as command of

Please share this news with your colleagues, faculty, students, and
institutes, and please feel free to write me (jloa at loc.gov) if there are
any questions.
Warm regards from snowy DC,
Jon
