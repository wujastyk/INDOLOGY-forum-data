 This has been all over Facebook today (and probably Twitter, though I don't tweet).? It is deeply regrettable.? In the Scroll.in report that you cite, Matthew, Romila's own comment is characteristically understated and non-inflammatory:
?It is a very unfortunate thing,? Thapar told Anandabazar. ?We are going through a strange time.
Emeritus is not a mere designation. It is an honour related to the university?s goodwill.?
Thank you for sharing.Best,Dominik
