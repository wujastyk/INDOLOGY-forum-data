[INDOLOGY] Yoni-temples and Mahavidyas
Dear Indologists,
I would like to ask you if during your fieldworks in India have you ever
met any temple (excluding Nilacala-Kamakhya) claiming to preserve the *yoni
*of the Goddess Sati.
A second question is if you ever met any site (again excluding
Nilacala-Kamakhya) which preserves a private shrine for each of the ten
Mahavidyas.
Warm regards from an extremely hot Rome,
Paolo
