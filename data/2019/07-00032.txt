Subject: [INDOLOGY] Yoni-temples and Mahavidyas
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf846eHGvQkJ6Y2p0LofuC261a8E=JMB9f=7Ypz16UH2yQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

I would like to ask you if during your fieldworks in India have you ever
met any temple (excluding Nilacala-Kamakhya) claiming to preserve the *yoni
*of the Goddess Sati.

A second question is if you ever met any site (again excluding
Nilacala-Kamakhya) which preserves a private shrine for each of the ten
Mahavidyas.

Warm regards from an extremely hot Rome,
Paolo
