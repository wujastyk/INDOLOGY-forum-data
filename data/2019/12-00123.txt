[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear Patrick,
C. V. Vaidya discusses the saying in History of Mediaeval Hindu India, vol. 2, appendix IV, ?Genesis of the Dictum kal?v?dyantayo? sthiti?? (Poona, 1924, pp. 312-317). He argues that it must have emerged sometime between 1300 and 1600, though he was unable to trace its original source.
