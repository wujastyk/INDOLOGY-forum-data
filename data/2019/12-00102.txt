[INDOLOGY] 'catching the ocean in a cow's hoofprint'
Dear Antonia,
     There is a traditional verse that says that the words used by Vy?sa
were from the Ocean of Grammar composed by Mahendra.  Those jewels of words
cannot be found in P??ini's grammar which is like a Cow's Hoofprint.  This
is to say that the so-called ?r?a usages in the Pur??as are not
ungrammatical, though they may not fit the [limited] grammar of P??ini.
???????????? ???????????? ?????? ??????????????? ? ????????? ??? ???? ?????

    This verse [according to secondary references] is found in Devabodha's
commentary on the Mahabharata.
