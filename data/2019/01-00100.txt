Dear Chakravarthi

Look in The Muktabodha digital library .
 It contains the nATyazAstram with the abhinavabharati in 3 volumes from the Gaekwads Oriental series .


 https://muktabodha.org/digital-library/
It is in the "searchable e-text library" section of the library.
Use username:  muktabodha
password: indology

 Click on nAtyazAstram Vol 1, nAtyazAstram Vol 2, nAtyazAstram Vol 3.
It is available in a searchable e-text in unicode transliteration and as a pdf in devanagari.

Regards,
Harry Spier
