Subject: [INDOLOGY] translating optative and indicative

The optative, bhavet, sy?t, etc. should often be translated in modern English in an indicative sense.  Is there some formal grammatical documentation for this somewhere?

Related, modern speakers of Indian English often use an optative/subjunctive/conditional "would" where a native British speaker would use a more direct indicative "is".

Best,
Dominik
