[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Sri Krishnaprasad,
I have been observing the fonts getting improvised. Its really fantastic to have the old prints on computers again. Thanks for your efforts. I could read the texts with ease and enjoy the enhanced experience of reading for beauty of characters. 
Few suggestions. 
1. AnusvAra seems to be big in size.
2. Little more compatibility is needed in ?u? ?r? marks at the bottom. 
3. Space where samyuktakshara is seen.
4. More care is required in representation of ?pa~Nkeruha? etc. especially with ?e? marker. 
5. Once again check with the size of ???.
Rest is wonderful 
Regards,
SV
