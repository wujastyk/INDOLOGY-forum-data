Dear Sri Krishnaprasad,

I have been observing the fonts getting improvised. Its really fantastic to have the old prints on computers again. Thanks for your efforts. I could read the texts with ease and enjoy the enhanced experience of reading for beauty of characters. 
Few suggestions. 

1. AnusvAra seems to be big in size.
2. Little more compatibility is needed in ?u? ?r? marks at the bottom. 
3. Space where samyuktakshara is seen.
4. More care is required in representation of ?pa~Nkeruha? etc. especially with ?e? marker. 
5. Once again check with the size of ???.

Rest is wonderful 

Regards,
SV

But I'm sure you know this.  And it's only certain advanced text-setting programs like TeX that allow one to access such features easily (e.g., through fontspec <https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec?lang=en>, manual part IV).

I use the professional product which retails for $199.00 but their website says that the Home edition for $79.00 also has this feature (but the home edition cannot be used for commercial purposes).  The program only works on windows.

As I recall  one volume gives examples of devanagari printing from the earliest printed editions up till fairly modern times (when it was published), another volume  describes the authors ideas for a devanagari typewriter and the third volume focuses on some esoteric ideas of the author.  I can't recall the details.
