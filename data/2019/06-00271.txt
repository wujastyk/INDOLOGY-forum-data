[INDOLOGY] just support
Best wishes to you Agathe. Your support is greatly appreciated. If nothing
else, though I think the case can easily be made for excluding Elst at this
stage, hopefully we can amend the language to prevent such undermining and
demeaning attacks from escalating or at least allow the committee easier
recourse to disinviting abusers from the forum.
Cheers!
