[INDOLOGY] two publications
Dear colleagues,
As the year is coming to an end, please allow me to draw your attention to
two books that have been published in the Gonda Indological Studies this
year (GIS 19 and GIS 20):
Henk W. Bodewitz, Vedic Cosmology and Ethics. Selected Studies. Edited by
Dory H. Heilijgers, Jan E.M. Houben and Karel van Kooij.
https://brill.com/view/title/54789
How did ?Vedic man? think about the destiny of man after death and related
ethical issues? That heaven was the abode of the gods was undisputed, but
was it also accessible to man in his pursuit of immortality? Was there a
realm of the deceased or a hell? What terms were used to indicate these
?yonder worlds?? What is their location in the cosmos and which
cosmographic classifications are at the root of these concepts? The
articles by Henk Bodewitz collected in this volume, published over a period
of 45 years, between 1969 and 2013, deal with these issues on the basis of
a systematic philological study of early Vedic texts, from the ?gveda to
various Br?hma?as, ?ra?yakas and Upani?ads.
Hans T. Bakker, Holy Ground: Where Art and Text Meet. Studies in the
Cultural History of India.
https://brill.com/view/title/54804
The 31 selected and revised articles in the volume Holy Ground: Where Art
and Text Meet, written by Hans Bakker between 1986 and 2016, vary from
theoretical subjects to historical essays on the classical culture of
India. They combine two mainstreams: the Sanskrit textual tradition,
including epigraphy, and the material culture as expressed in works of
religious art and iconography. The study of text and art in close
combination in the actual field where they meet provides a great potential
for understanding. The history of holy places is therefore one of the
leitmotivs that binds these studies together.
One article, "The Ramtek Inscriptions II", was co-authored by Harunaga
Isaacson, two articles, on "Moksadharma 187 and 239?241" and "The Quest for
the Pasupata Weapon," by Peter C. Bisschop.
Both volumes are available in the traditional printed form and as an
E-book. Thanks to the generous support of the J. Gonda Foundation, the PDF
of both books is available in Open Access on Brill?s website. The links
will get you there.
With best regards,
