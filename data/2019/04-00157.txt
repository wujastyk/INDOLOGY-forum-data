[INDOLOGY] Colour symbolism in pre-modern Indic sources; concise overview of the senses
Regarding the senses, I would start with this volume:
Axel Michaels, Christoph Wulf (eds), Exploring the Senses: South Asian and European Perspectives on Rituals and Performativity, Routledge 2014.
I am not aware of any specific study on colours in medicine or alchemy, but a good starting point could be the relevant chapter in Teun Goudriaan's M?y? Divine and Human (MLBD 1978).
Best,
Lubomir
