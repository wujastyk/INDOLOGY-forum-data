[INDOLOGY] Sivananda's Yoga Asanas 1st and 2nd Editions
Dear Colleagues,
Does anyone have the first and second editions of the book Yoga Asanas (illustrated)  by Sri Swami Sivananda Saraswati (of Rishikesh), published in 1934 and 1935 respectively? 
I am only interested in these two editions.
Thanks in advance.
Yours, with best wishes,
Jason
