Dear all,

not sure if this is useful for anybody, but you can find the pada-split
text of the RV along with the lexical analysis of each pada (not text
line) here:

https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/dcs/data/rigveda

With a modest amount of programming one could, for instance, perform
queries such as: "Show all stanzas where the second word in pada b is
agni" etc.

Error levels are described in the readme. If you find any other
systematic (or unsystematic) errors in the data, I would be glad to get
a hint.

Best, Oliver
