Many thanks to Kathrin Holz (Uni Lausanne) and Frank Koehler (Uni
Tuebingen) for offering their help and for sending an electronic scan of
the pages I needed (P. Skilling, *Mahasutras*) to the "outer provinces!"
I can only repeat what has been stated many times before here: What a
wonderful platform and resource the Indology list is!
