Here is what I have so far thank you:
1.Sankara?s Brahma-sutra-bhasya for the superb prose style and clarity.
2. Bha??ik?vya: "I love grammar, I love pedagogy, and I love poetry, and so an epic didactic poem about grammar is just the bee's knees for me."
Kindest wishes,

Dear Colleagues,
I have a lecture to prepare and am conducting a short survey:
I would like to know from the Sanskrit scholarly community what those feel are the utmost most excellent works from the entire corpora and a short line about why.
Think of it as "if there were to be a Pullitzer or Booker Prize for the notable Sanskrit works", who and what would be the nominees and why.
It could be a text that was of exceptional technical value for example P??ini's A???dhy?y? or those that have introduced a novel method in a field of science for example the Su?rutasa?hit?. Then of course a notable poetic marvel such as ?akuntal?.
If there exist some already compiled lists of the same I would most appreciate it.
With warmest wishes,
Martin
