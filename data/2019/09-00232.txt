>From my side I would add the Caraka Sa?hit? for its detail and depth touching upon virtually every aspect of life (from birth to death) and giving us a deep insight into general life at the time of its compilation and the Pa?catantra for its brilliance and ubiquity.

Kindest wishes,

Here is what I have so far thank you:

1.Sankara?s Brahma-sutra-bhasya for the superb prose style and clarity.

2. Bha??ik?vya: "I love grammar, I love pedagogy, and I love poetry, and so an epic didactic poem about grammar is just the bee's knees for me."

Kindest wishes,

Martin

Dear Colleagues,

I have a lecture to prepare and am conducting a short survey:

I would like to know from the Sanskrit scholarly community what those feel are the utmost most excellent works from the entire corpora and a short line about why.

Think of it as "if there were to be a Pullitzer or Booker Prize for the notable Sanskrit works", who and what would be the nominees and why.

It could be a text that was of exceptional technical value for example P??ini's A???dhy?y? or those that have introduced a novel method in a field of science for example the Su?rutasa?hit?. Then of course a notable poetic marvel such as ?akuntal?.

If there exist some already compiled lists of the same I would most appreciate it.

With warmest wishes,

Martin
