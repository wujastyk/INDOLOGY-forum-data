I?m not familiar with the stanza, but my reconstruction would be
atiparicay?d avaj?? / sa?tatagaman?d an?daro bhavati |
malaye bhillapurandhr? / candanataruk???ham indhana? kurute ||
This scans as a correct verse in g?ti.

Dear List members, 

someone (not a sanskritist and unaware of diacritics) asked me what the following stanza means:

atiparicayadavajna / samtatagamanadanadro bhavati.
malaye bhillaparandhri / candanatarukastham indhanam kurute.

Some parts, like malaye ...?candanatarukastham indhanam kurute, are clear but I do not know what to make of the second p?da.?
I look forward to suggestions.
Herman
