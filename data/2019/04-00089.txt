[INDOLOGY] question
I?m not familiar with the stanza, but my reconstruction would be
atiparicay?d avaj?? / sa?tatagaman?d an?daro bhavati |
malaye bhillapurandhr? / candanataruk???ham indhana? kurute ||
This scans as a correct verse in g?ti.

[INDOLOGY] question
Dear List members, 
someone (not a sanskritist and unaware of diacritics) asked me what the following stanza means:
atiparicayadavajna / samtatagamanadanadro bhavati.
malaye bhillaparandhri / candanatarukastham indhanam kurute.
Some parts, like malaye ...?candanatarukastham indhanam kurute, are clear but I do not know what to make of the second p?da.?
I look forward to suggestions.
