[INDOLOGY] The Earliest English Translation of the Rigveda [Publication Announcement]
Dear Prof. Slaje,
Please explain what is meant by ?first scholarly translation into English.? Horace Hayman Wilson?s English translation, which was published in 1866, six years after his death, predates Ludwig?s translation by a couple of decades. It is far from perfect, but it was a serious, pioneering effort.
