Dear all,
Greetings from Ashoka University! 
I am primarily a philosopher, but have a background in Indian Studies
(especially Hindi and Sanskrit). 
As I am currently compiling a reading list on Anek?ntav?da, I would love to
receive your suggestions. 
Indeed, every suggestion will be very much appreciated ? either via the list
(if you think it is of interest to many) or via personal email (see below)!
Thank you and best wishes,
Raja
