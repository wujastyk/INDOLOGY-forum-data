[INDOLOGY] Editions Treatises on Architcture
Dear list members,
One of my students is working on sacred architecture in Kerala and would 
like to examine both pan-Indian and regional adaptations of treatises on 
architecture. I would be very grateful to you if you could suggest the 
best editions to  study the following:
1. Architecture of Manasara
2. Mayamata - An Indian Treatise on Housing Architecture
3. Tantra Samuccayam
4. ?ilparatna
The two latter being regional adaptations of Kerala.
Many thanks in advance for your helpful replies!
All the best,
Jessie Pons
