Dear Dhaval Patel,

you could contact Amandine Wattelier-Bricout
https://www.iran-inde.cnrs.fr/membres/membres-doctorants/wattelier-bricout-amandine.html?lang=fr
(I am not sure whether she has sources for the Ayurveda, but you?ll see.)

Best wishes,
Agnes Korn

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Request for Embryology / Anatomy in Ayurveda

Respected Scholars,

While working on edition of a work, I am faced with a long Ayurvedic tract. Can any of you suggest me to

1. Suggested text for a beginner for embryology and anatomy in Ayurveda.
2. Any papers which discusses embryology and anatomy in Ayurveda.

With regards,
