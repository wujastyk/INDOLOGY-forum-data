=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Anek=C4=81ntav=C4=81da_-_suggestions=3F?=
Dear Raja (if I may),
Hopefully, this reply will be of general interest to the entire list. ?Anek?ntav?da is a topic that is of particular interest to me, so I am happy to share this list.
Probably the best book on this topic is:
Bimal Krishna Matilal, The Central Philosophy of Jainism (Anek?ntav?da)?(Ahmedabad: L.D. Institute of Indology, 1981)
I also recommend:
Satkari Mookerjee,?The Jaina Philosophy of Non-Absolutism:?A Critical Study of?Anek?ntav?da?(Delhi:??Motilal Banarsidass, 1978)
Y.J. Padmarajiah,?A Comparative Study of the Jaina Theories of Reality and Knowledge?(Bombay:??Jain Sahitya Vikas Mandal, 1963)
An excellent recent work which delves into the origins of anek?ntav?da is:
Piotr Balcerowicz,?Early Asceticism in Jainism: ?jivikism and Jainism(London: Routledge, 2016)
The following article by John Cort provides a great critique of the frequently asserted claim that anek?ntav?da historically functions as a philosophy of 'intellectual ahi?s?':
John E. Cort, ??Intellectual Ahimsa? Revisited:??Jain Tolerance and Intolerance of?Others? (Philosophy East and West?Volume 50, Number 3 July 2000 324-347).
Chapters 5 and 6 of my Jainism: An Introduction?(London: IB Tauris, 2009) present,?respectively, historical and philosophical analyses of anek?ntav?da and the related doctrines, nayav?da and sy?dvada ?These analyses, in turn, are based on my 2000 doctoral dissertation from the University of Chicago, Plurality and Relativity: Whitehead, Jainism, and the Reconstruction of Religious Pluralism.
Paul Dundas' The Jains?(London: Routledge, 2002?second edition) and Padmanabh S. Jaini's The?Jaina Path of Purification?(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979) have relevant sections on anek?ntav?da and sy?dv?da. ?I also recommend Tara Sethia's 2004 edited volume, Anek?nta and Ahi?s??(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2004).
This is by no means a complete list, but it is a good start. ?I hope you find it useful!
With best wishes,Jeff

Dear all,
 ?
Greetings from Ashoka University! 
I am primarily a philosopher, but have a background in Indian Studies (especially Hindi and Sanskrit). 
As I am currently compiling a reading list on Anek?ntav?da, I would love to receive your suggestions. 
 ?
Indeed, every suggestion will be very much appreciated ? either via the list (if you think it is of interest to many) or via personal email (see below)!
 ?
Thank you and best wishes,
Raja
