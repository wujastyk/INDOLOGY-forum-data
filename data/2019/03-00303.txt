[INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Dear Dan
I hope I am not seen as a shill for publishers, but I would like to point
out that what you say is not quite right. How are contributions to be
found? How is their continued presence to be assured? How are materials to
be distributed? There are many more questions like this that your brief
explanation omits, but that are vital. All of us have experienced multiple
times a 404 message when following a link to an article or contribution of
interest. If we want our publications to last, this is not a viable model.
This statement is not a positive assertion of what is in fact the optimal
model, but it does point out a weakness in your questioning. I think that
there are some viable options out there, but it's not nearly as simple as
you suggest.
