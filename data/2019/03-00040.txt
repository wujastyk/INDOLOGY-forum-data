[INDOLOGY] Vedic Sample texts with all vedic accents
Dear all
I would like to check the Vedic text sample which includes all the possible
Vedic accents which are available in Vedic Unicode Character maps (files
attached both normal and extended).
I would like to know how they look when printed along with Vedic verses.
 Either PDF or text file will be useful to include the same symbols in my
new upcoming fonts. Could anyone please help me regarding this?
Thanks a lot
Best regards
Krishna Prasad
