[INDOLOGY] The alphabet found in the Lalitavistara
Dear Colleagues,
     As I have been reading the Lipi??l?sandar?ana-Parivarta of the
Lalitavistara [p. 89, P. L. Vaidya edition], some interesting features of
the alphabet popped up for me.  The Alphabet omits *r?* and *l?*, but
includes *ai, au*, and *a?*. Among the consonants, it adds *k? *at the end
after *h*.  The version of this passage as given in the
Bauddh?gam?rthasa?graha [ed by P. L. Vaidya] also omits *l*, while it is
included in the version of Lalitavistara edited by Vaidya himself.  I
wonder if there are textual variants about this.  I don't know what this
alphabet represents.  The omission of *r? *and *l? *goes along the
phonologies of Prakrits, but the inclusion of *ai, au*, and *a?* goes in
the direction of Sanskrit.  The addition of *k? *and the possible omission
of *l *point to something else that I cannot figure out.  Any suggestions
and references are welcome.
