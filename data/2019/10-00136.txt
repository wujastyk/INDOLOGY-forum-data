[INDOLOGY] Thakkana again
Dear Peter,
I, too, am not familiar with the manuscript history of this text.  
Since the author originates from Kashmir, the assumption of a ??rad?  
tradition seemed at least natural.
But it's about the possible confusion of the ligatures -ttha- (of an  
assumed *?r?matthakkana-) and -cch- (of ?r?macchakuna), isn't it?  
Would you say that ttha and ccha can also be confused in your 11th c.  
??rad? ms.?
As fas as the Tibetan variants sgrib byed/med are concerned, I merely  
thought that someone might have considered sgrib byed for a  
"suspicious" name (= possibly corrupted in the course of the Tibetan  
tradition) and corrected it to sgrib med (think of the tendency of  
Sde-dge recension to "revise" readings). But I agree: it could also be
"nothing more than a psychological slip", which amounts to the same  
result (the original reading would be sgrib byed).
Be that as it may: sgrib byed corresponds to thakkana, whereas sgrib  
med corresponds neither to thakkana nor to ?akuna, which suggests that  
the Tibetans originally translated something like thakkana with sgrib  
byed.
Best wishes,
Roland
