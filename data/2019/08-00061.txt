[INDOLOGY] EasyUnicode for a Windows computer?
Dear all,
I'm not sure whether this is the answer to the question asked, but if the
goal here is to easily type nagari and transliterated Sanskrit, Keyman
seems the simplest way to go (when it asks you to pick a keyboard, go for
the Heidelberg Input Solution; the only two shortcuts you need to define
are for activating each keyboard/switching between them - in my case, I
picked CTRL+D and CTRL+T, respectively).
Hope this helps,
    Antonia
