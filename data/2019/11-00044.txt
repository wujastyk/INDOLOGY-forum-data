[INDOLOGY] origin and discussion that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya"
 Sorry, I mistitled that earlier thread.
Does anyone know the origin of the term and concept that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya", eternal and uncreated by humans?
I have heard it might have originated in Karma Mimamsa.
Also, any information about how it was conceived, discussed and debated would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Dean
