[INDOLOGY] new .pdf requests
Dear Colleagues,
Would anyone have .pds of English translations, wherever possible, of
the following publications of Bartholomeus Ziegenbalg: his
Malabarisches Heidenthum and the Genealogie der Malabarischen Gotter,
completed the arly 1700s; and his co-authored Halleschen Berichte. (I
have a copy in English of the Geneology but in Washington and not in
Colombia).
I also still need Louis Dumont?s study of the Pramalai Kallar. Would
anyone have in English or French on a .pdf?
And I am still looking for a .pdf of William Ward?s 1827 A View of the History,
Literature, and Religion of the Hindoos (Serampore: Mission press),
for which any edition on pdf would be great...
Thanks much,
Alf
