Thank you very much for all these helpful responses -- I have a few great
new paths to explore and look forward to hearing about any more that this
list may conjure up.
My mistake with regards to the role of *tapas *in the Tri?a?ku story -- it
was, of course, Vi?v?mitra whose *tapas *caused a bit of a stir, not
Tri?a?ku's.  Many thanks to Dr. Goldman for steering the list in the right
direction.
All the best,
Aaron
