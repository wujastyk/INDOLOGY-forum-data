Dear all,
would anyone have a pdf of the
"Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Bombay
Presidency, during the Years 1887-88, 1888-89, 1889-90 and 1890-91"?
I am aware of http://wujastyk.net/mscats/Sanskrit_Catalogues/Biswas%200854%20Poona%20-%20Bhandarkar%20search%201887/Bhandarkar_Report_on_the_Search_for_Sanskrit_Mss_Bombay_1887.pdf
, but unfortunately its last pages, with roman pages numbers, are
missing.
Gauri Shankar, in the introduction to his edition of the
Kapphi??bhyudaya (p. xlvi), mentions an anonymous verse in praise of
its author ?ivasv?min, apparently featured in the description of the
Kav?ndravacanasamuccaya in the book I am searching, on p. xi:
v?ky?ni dvipad?yut?ny atha mah?k?vy?ni sapta kram?t
    tryak?apratyahanirmitastutikath?lak???i caik?da?a |
k?tv? n??akan??ik?prakara?apr?y?n prabandh?n bah?n
    vi?r?maty adhun?pi n?ti?ayit? v??? ?ivasv?mina? ||
Which is of interest not only because of the remarkable number of
seven Mah?k?vyas (and other works) attributed to ?ivasv?min, but also
because of its mention of the "eleven lacs of hymns and narratives
composed day by day in praise of ?iva" (tr. Shankar, or maybe
Bhandarkar?) suggesting him to be a ?aiva, while his only preserved
work plays on a Buddhist theme. This verse makes its appearance in
other places, too, with variant readings. Any complete pdf, or scans
of the few relevant pages, or thoughts on the verse in question are
welcome!
Best regards,
Peter Pasedach
