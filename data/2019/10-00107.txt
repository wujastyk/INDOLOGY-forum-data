Dear Alakendu,
If you are mostly interested in the relationship between Sanskrit and Greek, then may I also recommend an introduction to Indo-European philology? James Clackson's 'Indo-European Linguistics' is excellent and very readable; Ben Fortson's 'Indo-European Language and Culture', as the title suggests, also covers some of the cultural aspects you mention being interested in. Personally, when it comes to understanding language relationships, I also rather like Anthony Fox' 'Linguistic Reconstruction'. These are just a few of the books available on these subjects.
Given you say you may go back 'beginning with as early as Sir William Jones', just a brief note: William Jones, although a very famous participant in this debate, was far from the earliest. The first European missionaries who came to India and were able to learn Sanskrit realised right away that it must be related to Latin and Greek (many sources make that clear, the earliest western grammar of Sanskrit by Father Heinrich Roth SJ from the 1660s among them). William Jones was, however, the first to suggest (at least in writing) that the common source of those languages&nbsp;'perhaps no longer exists' (his words in 1786); in other words, he suggested that, against earlier beliefs, the relationship between these languages was not that the western languages derive from Sanskrit, but that they all came from a common source and are thus sisters or cousins. That of course is the view that has been confirmed by philologists/linguists since then.
I hope the above is relevant to what you are looking into!
All the very best,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia

Dr.Ruppel,&nbsp;Thank you very much for elaborating on the matter.I am keen to get access to a Beginner's book on Greek to get an insight of a belief among scholars, beginning with as early as Sir William Jones,namely an identity between Sanskrit and Greek . Though,I am not a student of Linguistics, but of Indology and Vedanta Philosophy,.... still i intend to understand Indo-European culture ,to a certain degree deeper, may be as an extension of my Indological roots.( Language , being a component of culture)I shall certainly look for the books you referred.Hope,they are&nbsp; available through Amazon.Alakendu Das.

Dear Alakendu,
My classroom favourites for teaching Greek have long been Athenaze (Oxford UP) and Learn to Read Greek (Yale UP). They both come in several volumes and thus are not the cheapest; but their length is due to the number of resources they make available. (Plenty of good, author-written readings in Athenaze, large amounts of annotated original Greek readings in LTRG.&nbsp;
However, if you want to use the book just for yourself (rather than to teach a group of students with varying strengths and interests), the one-volume Introduction to Attic Greek by Mastronarde may be the way to go, especially for someone who already knows Sanskrit and thus is already familiar with most of the grammatical categories and concepts we find in Greek. It also comes with its own supplementary website:&nbsp;http://atticgreek.org.
There are various others - if none of the above sound good, let me know what you are looking for and I'll be happy to talk more about what else is out there.
All the best,&nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia
