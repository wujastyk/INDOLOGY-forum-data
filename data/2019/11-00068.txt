Dear Dean,
Some quick notes in reaction to your query:
It is a widely accepted clich? that "the Vedas are eternal and apauru?eya"
and another clich?, equally widely accepted by both traditional and modern,
Indian and non-Indian, scholars is that this is essentially (!) THE Indian
view on the Vedas. At some point in time, indeed, the "irrational" view of
the nitya and apauru?eya Veda became dominant, and the theory of elevated
but basically "human" authors disappeared from view in "orthodox" circles
(just as the view of an originally basically "human" Jesus Christ advocated
by Arius made in the course of time place for more "irrational" positions
such as Trinitarianism which implies the an?dinidhanam divinity of Jesus in
Christianity?). This means there was an earlier time that the view of a
nitya and apauru?eya Veda was not dominant or evident. Even if we limit
ourselves to the six so-called "orthodox" schools of Indian philosophy we
find that widely divergent views were held about the nature and (extent of)
authoritativeness of the Vedas -- and on the question whether the Vedic
texts had or did not have authors: S??khya is severely critical of the
Vedas and Vedic ritual (Houben 1999); Ny?ya makes efforts to prove that the
Veda is not apauru?eya but pauru?eya: deriving from a Puru?a, namely God
(Chemparathy 1983); the school of Aitih?sika interpretation of the Rgveda
did not survive but interpreted the subject matter of hymns often in terms
of references to human or divine,?historical? personalities (E. Sieg 1902).
Not much of their views is preserved, but it is likely that the authors of
the hymns were also regarded as ?historical? personalities; in Vai?e?ika,
although theism overtook later on, there is no early systematic commitment
even to God but to the ??is and their knowledge (even Pra?astap?da accepts,
apart from pratyak?a, lai?gika and sm?ti, only ?r?a as another category of
reliable knowledge, vidy?, in contradistinction to four forms of avidy?)
