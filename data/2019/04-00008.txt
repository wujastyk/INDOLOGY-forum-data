[INDOLOGY] Unfounded accusations of Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Audrey,
In your latest message to the Indology mailing list you stile yourself as a
victim of sexism experienced in recent times during your work on the
Indology committee. Moreover, you pretend to courageously blow the whistle
against the explicit advice of your colleagues who want to keep you silent
probably in order to save their reputation.
In this situation, it may be of interest to the larger community of
colleagues that as a fellow committee member I did not witness a single
instance in which, contrary to your claim, you ?met with blanket denials,
belittling of ? [your] concerns, declarations that discussing sexism is not
a substantive issue, accusations of being a troublemaker, and flat out
refusals to discuss gender issues.? On the contrary, all committee members,
irrespective of their ethnicity and sex, always take your concerns
seriously and devote as much time to their discussion as possible under the
time constrains we all have to face in our daily work. Of course, we there
is disagreed. But disagreement is not necessarily an indication of sexism.
It may also occur on the (lack of) merit of arguments.
Your move to go public with unfounded accusations in order to strengthen
you position in the committee is something for which I have very little
understanding. It is utterly unfair to your colleagues who spend a lot of
time and energy to keep this list running to the best of their abilities. I
can?t believe that you are not aware of this.
Best,
Philipp
