Dear Colleagues,
Those who follow news on higher education in India may be interested in
Prakash Javadekar restricting PhD topics
<https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-slams-prakash-javadekar-for-restricting-phd-topics/articleshow/68552157.cms>
to subjects in line with "national priorities." The new directive has
prompted at least one Indian academic to resign

already.
Some of you may remembers Javadekar, who inaugurated the World Sanskrit
Conference <https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca> last year in Vancouver.
