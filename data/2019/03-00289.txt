Dear Friends and Colleagues,

The program for Buddhist Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
(HUJI) is pleased to announce a new post-doctoral position at the
university for the academic years of 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. The position
is for a full academic year, beginning in October 2019 and continuing
through September 2020, and is potentially renewable for a second year. The
position has been made possible through the generosity of the Khyentse
Foundation.

The main requirements of the position are to conduct high quality research
in Buddhist Studies and to contribute to the life of the program. The
latter will include ? (a) offering one graduate level two-point credit
course in the field of Buddhist Studies: at HUJI a two-point credit course
is offered throughout one semester, i.e. 14 weekly meetings of 90 minutes
each, in either the fall or spring terms. (b) to offer support for our
graduate students in their research, mainly through advanced reading in
Buddhist languages. (c) to participate in the activities of the program.

Advanced knowledge of at least one classical Buddhist language is a must.
Our main needs today are in Tibetan or Chinese Buddhism, but scholars from
any field of Buddhist Studies are encouraged to apply. The scholarship will
be of 33,000$ distributed evenly over twelve months, which should allow for
relatively comfortable living in Jerusalem over the period of the
scholarship.

In order to apply, please send the following documents to

program (up to 4 pages); (b) an updated CV; (c) one reading sample from the
applicant?s publications; (d) two letters of recommendation should be sent
directly by the recommenders, stating in the title that they are a

Results will be announced by the end of May at the very latest. For any
further details or questions, please feel free to contact Dr. Eviatar

With best regards,

Eviatar Shulman
