your keyboard? From my experience, it really is a good, reliable
application.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Easy unicode for ipad? (James Hartzell)
Dear Richard,
Keyman is very useful, thank you for sharing that. The only limitation
I can see (which Keyman confirmed when I asked them) is that on iOS,
they don't have access to hardware keyboards when it's running as a
system keyboard.
That means that if you want to use your iPad for sustained
composition, in place of a laptop, you are restricted to the on-screen 
keyboard if you use Keyman.
So I think there's still no way to robustly integrate diacritics with
a bluetooth keyboard on iPad. But I'm happy to learn that I'm wrong.
Best,
Malcolm
