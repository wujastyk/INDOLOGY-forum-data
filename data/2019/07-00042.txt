On the Medical Doctrines in the Tandulavey?liya: 2. Teachings of Anatomy

Author: Colette Caillat. Translated from the French by Brianne Donaldson

Year: 2019

ISSN: 1748-1074

International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 15, No. 1 (2019) 1-12

In this translated essay, originally published in French, Colette Caillat
examines the teachings of anatomy in the Tandulavey?liya, one of
the Prak?r?aka-s?tras in the Svet?mbara Jain canon. Caillat explores
similarities and discrepancies between the accounts of physiology described
in the Tandulavey?liya and other classical medical treatises of the time,
such as Caraka- and Su?ruta-sa?hit?s, as well as
the Vi??u-sm?ti, Y?j?avalkya-sm?ti, and Garbha-upani?ad. Alongside these
comparisons, Caillat also highlights singular contributions found in
the Tandulavey?liya, namely the unique anatomical accounts of women and
"third-sex"/"neuter" individuals (pa??aga [Skt. pa??aka]).

Early Kannada Literature: Sheldon Pollock?s Work Language of Gods

Author: Hampa Nagarajaiah (Hampana)

Year: 2019

ISSN: 1748-1074

International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 15, No. 2 (2019) 1-24

The credit of establishing Kannada as one of the foremost literary
languages of far greater significance and dimension goes to Sheldon
Pollock. In his book, Language of the Gods in the World of Men, he has
narrated the history and described the core characteristics of Kannada
literature, and accomplished the task that was long due. About 50 pages in
chapter 9, and some pages in chapter 10, are devoted to the historical
development of Kannada. Befitting references to the antiquity, density,
historicity, sociology, literary production and other accomplishments are
presented. However, Pollock?s statement ?Jainism has little or nothing to
do with Early Kannada literature? is unjustified. A vast corpus of
literature produced by Jain litterateurs is either ignored or diluted. For
instance, the Va???r?dhane, the earliest extant major work of Kannada
literature, singular for its poetic prose, does not figure in the book.
References to ?r?vijaya's two k?vyas, the Raghuva??apur??a and the
Candraprabhapur??a are missing. The Y?pan?ya-sa?gha, a prominent sect,
mentioned in many medieval inscriptions and enjoying royal donations, does
not even figure for its name sake. Jinavallabha, the younger brother of
poet Pampa, was adroit in Telugu, adept in Kannada and proficient in
Sanskrit. He is the earliest poet in Telugu and wrote a famous inscription
in three languages. The paper is a critique of Sheldon Pollock's book
Language of the Gods in the World of Men with special reference to the
treatment of Kannada, which awaits serious analysis and an extensive debate.

Word-Numerals in N?gavarma?s Canarese Prosody

Author: Dipak Jadhav

Year: 2019

ISSN: 1748-1074

International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 15, No. 3 (2019) 1-21

This paper studies eighty word-numerals referred to in the Canarese prosody
of the Jain writer N?gavarma of the late 10th century. Almost all of them
are in Sanskrit. This paper also shows why they represent the corresponding
numbers. Every word-numeral is the bearer of thought, deeply rooted in
ancient Indian society, whether it is from the Vedic culture or the
Paur??ika culture or the epic culture or the Jaina culture.
