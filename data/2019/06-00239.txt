For those who are unaware of the tactics adopted by the far-right, you may
enjoy reading this short article
http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/praxis1313/jeff-stein-strategic-speech-and-alt-right-metapolitics/,
You'll see that Dr. Elst utilizes them all, from trolling and gaslighting,
to victimization, to turning everything into a free speech issue.

Make no mistake, there is nothing unintentional about this and it is a
performance for those lurkers who silently agree. It is meant to bait those
who do not agree into "debate" in order to try to turn their words around
against them, as Elst attempted to do in his response to me.

In his earlier email, Elst presents Pamela Geller
<https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/pamela-geller>
and Robert Spencer
<https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/robert-spencer>
as subjects who have had their free speech trampled. This is a dog whistle.
Geller and Spencer are opportunistic far-right anti-Muslim activists.
Spencer was banned from the UK in 2013 due to his extremism. A security
guard was shot
<https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/us/gunmen-killed-after-firing-on-anti-islam-groups-event.html>
at a stunt in Texas in which they offered a $10K prize to the person who
drew the "best" cartoon of the Prophet Muhammed.

These writers, Elst, and many other far-right writers were cited for their
anti-Islamic views in the manifesto written by the Norwegian terrorist
Anders Brevik. If that name isn't familiar, perhaps you'll remember the
2011 Oslo bombing and subsequent mass shooting of teenagers on an island by
a "lone wolf" who killed 77 people in total. Brevik's manifesto
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik#Manifesto:_2083:_A_European_Declaration_of_Independence>
is
now canon among the violent far-right as it lays out tactics and strategies
for online harassment and real-world terrorism. The Austrailian-born
Christchurch shooter made reference to it as inspiration in his own
manifesto.

To me, the most worrying tactic of the online far-right is its penchant for
making lists of "leftists" in order to target them. Recently an online
publication
<https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/11/11/intellectual-dark-web-quillette-claire-lehmann-221917>
ran an article with a list of journalists they believed to be connected to
the anti-fascist movement
<https://www.cjr.org/analysis/quillette-antifa-journalist-smear-campaign.php>.
The article "was circulated approvingly on white supremacist forum
Stormfront the day after its publication; a day later, a YouTube user
uploaded a video of imagery of mass shooters intercut with images of the
reporters mentioned by Lenihan under the heading ?Sunset the Media.?"

Scary stuff. Turns out words on the internet aren't just words afterall. I
worry that lurkers on this email listserv may build their own list of
targets, i.e., some of us.
