Dear Madhav, 

Normally in Greek the rules of verbal accentuation are different from
Sanskrit, where the prosodic accent is retained, has become recessive,
limited to the final three syllables, and placement conditioned by the
syllabic weight of the two. 

However, there are two verbs that do not obey these rules - ???? 'I am'
(= ?smi < *h?es-) and ???? 'I say' (< *b?eh?-) - which are enclitic in
the indicative and *do* behave similarly to Vedic where they loose their
prosodic accent when followed by a non-verb. One exception to this is
that ???? normally bears an accented as ????? 'there is' when
clause-initial and has existential meaning. I think this is the same as
verbal accentuation in Vedic, if I am recalling how verbal accentuation
in Vedic works correctly.
