[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Krishnaprasad Ji,
     I don't have access to a manuscript of ?a?tri??attattvasandoha, but
here is the title page of the printed book that does not use a cluster of
"tra" hanging below "?", but prints just "?" with a vir?ma sign.

On the other hand, the title page of the edition in the Kashmir Text
Series, uses such a vertical cluster:

However, it looks somewhat odd in its appearance to me.
