[INDOLOGY] Gerard Fussman's paper
Dear Indologists,
I need to read 1988 Fussman's paper, but am unable to obtain the text from
the Net. Quite a number of mentions, but not the text itself.
<Central and provincial administration in ancient India: The problem of the
Mauryan empire. In: The Indian Historical Review, 14(1-2), 1987-88, pp.
43-72.>
Would anyone kindly share a copy? My deep appreciation and thanks.
