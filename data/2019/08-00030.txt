Just to mention, perhaps, that more than one scholar is working on this
text at the moment. A number of years ago there was a PhD (? I think, but
maybe MA?) thesis at the University of Tokyo, which reedited the text, but
the author, as I understand it, left the field. There is also a student at
Oxford working on the sutra.
I'm not at all sure it is worthwhile to consult Tucci's edition, which is
notoriously bad, quite often simply failing to make sense, something which
has been known for ages. Ron doesn't say why he wants the edition, but if
it is for anything other than purely historical reasons, I would not bother.
