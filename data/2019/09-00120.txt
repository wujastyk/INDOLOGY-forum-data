[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
Dear Martin,
I would add A?vagho?a?s Buddhacarita, which is sometimes credited as being the beginning of kavya.
And perhaps more unexpectedly, I would recommend N?g?rjuna?s M?lamadhyamakak?rik?, not only for its unrivaled impact on virtually all subsequent Indian thought, initiating debates and sharpening of positions that have continued until today, but even moreso for the elegance, musicality and beauty of its poetry, rarely commented on and invariably lost in translations. 
best,
Dan
