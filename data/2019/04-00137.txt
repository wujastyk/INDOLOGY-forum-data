Here is the specific passage from Vishnu Bhataji Godse's ???? ??????
(reprint edition in 1974, Venus Prakashan, Pune, pp. 30-31; in my English
translation):  "In the city of Gwalior, the Upanayana of the son of a well
known person occurred in the month of ????ha.  There was a meeting
regarding this in the Vitthal temple and on that occasion many scholars
such as R?m?c?rya had come.  The Upanayana was done following the opinion
of a pandit named T?tu D?k?ita Bha?kamkar, who was a famous Veda reciter
who could recite the R?gveda upto ghanap??ha.  Mr. Bha?kamkar established
that it is justified to perform the Upanayana of a Brahmin in the month of
????ha until Vi??u?ayana based on references from Smr?tis, S?tras and the
Maitr?ya??ya Pari????a, and the Pa?cagau?a brahmins from Mathur? testified
at this meeting that it is a tradition among the Pa?cagau?a brahmins to
perform the Upanayana in the month of ????ha.  Pandit Bha?kamkar performed
the Upanayana in the month of ????ha, and the meeting concluded that this
was done according to the ??stras."  This account describes the visit of
Vishnu Bhataji Godse to north India in 1857.
