[INDOLOGY] Vegetarianism a study
Dear Members 
Currently, I'm pursuing on topic Vegetarianism in different religions. In this regard, I would humbly request you to provide references of some articles /books on vegetarianism in Hindu religious scriptures/religious text. 
It is my firm belief that your wide knowledge in Indology, would provide valuable scholarly references and guidance to take my work forward.
Warm Regards,
Sincerely
