Dear Colleagues,
Further to the announcement of the new book, the colour pages of 2  
articles inadvertently got printed in black and white.
Should you be interested in the book you might like to have these  
pages in colour, the way in which they were originally submitted to  
the publisher.

Please let me know if you would like to have them so that I can gladly  
send them to you.

Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this unavoidable mistake.
J. Soni
