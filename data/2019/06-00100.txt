Dear all
I am looking for a word
?????????? (not ?????)from Kosas I searched Vaijayanti and Visvaprakasa but
could not find there. If you find this word in any Kosas kindly inform.
I found this word in the Commentary of Amarakosa that is Sudha on the verse
?????????? and seen usage in VisvaguNadarsa Champu
Yours sincerely
KP
