I noticed that everyone who said they didn't get the attachment is a gmail account user  (myself included).  Is it just gmail users who have trouble receiving indology attachments.. Did any gmail users get the attachment?

I also often have problems receiving attachments in Indology messages. In this case I didn?t even receive the email with the recording. I too would be interested in hearing it. And like others, I second what David wrote. It is fascinating and instructive to see your English translation alongside the Sanskrit for many reasons, including your word choices in both languages.

At my side I could easily download (95k) and hear the recording (but I often have difficulty to get other attachments at Indology-messages which others seem to get without problems).

Hello Jan,
     Here is my recording of my verse in ?ry?.  This is the general style of reciting ?ry? in Maharashtra.  This meter was made popular in Marathi by a poet named Moropant [May?rakavi] during the Peshwa period.  He composed 108 different R?m?ya?as, and an entire Mah?bh?rata in Marathi using ?ry?.

Dear Madhav,
Happy birthday, and nice to see how not only time but also your poetic flow is unstoppable... and nice to see a change of metre.
The "sing-song" melody normally superimposed and superimposable on any sloka is well known.
Does anyone know how a verse in the Aaryaa meter is traditionally sung or chanted? Any sample accessible online?
Best regards,
Jan Houben
