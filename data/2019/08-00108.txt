[INDOLOGY] Rasas and music
Dear Harry, again I may draw your attention to an article of mine, titled "Early Tamil Poetics between N??ya??stra and R?gam?l?", in: W. Cox and V. Vergiani, Bilingual Discourse and Cross-Cultural Fertilisation: Sanskrit and Tamil in Medieval India, Pondicherry 2013, pp.69-91. In the article I deal, among other things, with the j?tis (Tamil ti?ais) and rasas (p. 80).
The pdf is on my website.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Rasas and music
Dear list members,
Would any members know if there are any writings  relating rasas to music. Ideally what I'm looking for are statements relating individual musical ragas to particular rasas.  Such as:
"Raga X manifests rasa Y".
I'm interested in any writings up to and including modern times.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
