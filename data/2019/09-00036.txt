Tried to access the recent article "The formation of human populations in
South and Central Asia" by Vagheesh Narasimhan et al published in the
journal Science [Sept 6, 2019], but could not get access to it through the
University of Michigan Library.? I am wondering if someone has downloaded
this article and can share with me.? Thanks.
