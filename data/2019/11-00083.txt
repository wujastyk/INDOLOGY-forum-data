Dear Colleagues and Friends,

this is a friendly reminder for you to submit an abstract for the panel on M?m??s? and Dharma??stra at the next ECSAS to be held in Vienna, from 29 July to 1 August 2020. You will find below the title and abstract of the panel. You can also find it and submit your paper proposal on the following page: https://ecsas2020.univie.ac.at/panels/htty6/. The submission instructions are available here: https://ecsas2020.univie.ac.at/paper-submission-guidelines/. The deadline is November 17, 2019.

The panel focuses on how jurisprudence (Dharma??stra) in precolonial South Asia adopted the paradigms elaborated by the exegetical school  (M?m??s?) and applied them to the concrete cases of juridical disputes. The participants in the panel will approach these issues from multiple perspectives.

If you have any question, please feel free to write to me.

Looking forward to reading or seeing some of you next year in Vienna.
