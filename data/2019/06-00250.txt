[INDOLOGY] Clarification of list etiquette
Dear Chris
Certainly not. We should behave on a list like this as (I hope) we would when face to face with our colleagues in a conference room. Anyone indulging in name-calling or withering sarcasm, or trying to label colleagues as ?trespassing youngsters?, has already lost whatever argument they had. In my view we are all equal members on here. The fact that some of us have been knocking around longer than others does not necessarily make us wiser, as the Dhammapada points out.
