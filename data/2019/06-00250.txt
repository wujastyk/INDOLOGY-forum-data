Dear Chris

Certainly not. We should behave on a list like this as (I hope) we would when face to face with our colleagues in a conference room. Anyone indulging in name-calling or withering sarcasm, or trying to label colleagues as ?trespassing youngsters?, has already lost whatever argument they had. In my view we are all equal members on here. The fact that some of us have been knocking around longer than others does not necessarily make us wiser, as the Dhammapada points out.

On the other hand, rights and obligations are contingent and limited to the domains in which they are granted, and so I?ll quietly show myself out if that?s the way things are going to be.  That?s really not meant as a threat. I am an utterly inconsequential and passive participant in Indology.  However, I suspect that others feel the same way, and are not so free as I am to say so, and that perhaps the management of Indology would benefit from knowing that.
