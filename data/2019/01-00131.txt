Dear colleagues,

The Sanskrit Traditions in the Modern World symposium, which was for many
years held at the University of Manchester, will take place in Oxford this
year. I have been asked to forward the following announcement, below.
Apologies for cross-posting.

Best wishes,
Rembert


*Sanskrit Traditions in the Modern World *
*Friday 24th May 2019 *
Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies

The STIMW symposium for 2019 will take place in Oxford on Friday 24th May,
at the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies. We invite proposals for papers from
both established and rising academics on any aspects of South Asia?s rich
Sanskrit religious and intellectual culture.  Sanskrit Traditions in the
Modern World (STIMW) is a forum for the discussion of the Sanskrit
traditions of South Asia, and the texts and cultures that have risen out of
them. Proposals should be submitted by *Friday 1st March 2019*.

The STIMW Website can be found here:
*http://sanskrittraditions.ml/ <http://sanskrittraditions.ml/>*

Older archives and information for past STIMW events at the University of
Manchester can be found here:
*https://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/religions-and-theology/connect/events/stimw/
<https://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/religions-and-theology/connect/events/stimw/>*

*Papers and Format *- Papers are presented by leading scholars in the field
as well as by research students. Papers are pre-circulated so that
participants can read them before the seminar to ensure the best possible
use of discussion time.  Papers are therefore not read out at the seminar
itself but instead briefly introduced by the chair who will then raise
questions to the paper-giver, before opening the discussion.

Papers should be no longer than 20 A4 pages, including notes and
references. To facilitate discussion for those short of reading time,
paper-givers should provide a one-page abstract of the key argument of the
paper, along with their paper. Please include your email address for
further feedback.
*Venue*
