Post-Scriptum:

I see in the 2001 ???????? ?????? ????? ????????? ???????? that, 
according to the scholars who compiled it, ??????? has been used in 
ancient Tamil literature with three different meanings:

-- ??? (in the Cilappatik?ram passage already quoted)
-- ???????? (in the Ma?im?kalai, Canto 25, line 55)
-- ????????  (in the T?v?ram)

This is certainly an interesting configuration

Best wishes
