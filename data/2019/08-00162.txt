[INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
Dear Herman,
thanks for pointing to this interesting passage.
I have just verified that the Cilap. text has
??????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????
(Cilap., Canto X, line 102)
That is why the IFP Index de Mot de la Lit?rature Ancienne has no entry 
for ??? ....
The word used is ???????
(which the commentator identifies with ???)
That is interesting
Best wishes
