[INDOLOGY] Tamil pronunciation
Dear Artur,
The Tamil script does not have letters for the voiced plosives (and no aspirates). For that it uses the corresponding voiceless plosives. After a nasal and between vowels k is pronounced  g: a?ku "there" is pronounces a?gu, ?ku "to become", ?gu or ?hu. Word-initial k is pronounced k, as in k?tal "love". So is double kk, as in the infinitive k?kka "to protect". This phenomenon used to be known by the expression "convertibility of surds and sonants".
The "official" transcription is a?ku, ?ku, k?tal, k?kka. There is an unofficial transcription used in English language publications. For instance, k?tali, " a lovely girl", is transcribed as kathali as well as kadhali.
In our youngest son's class in primary school there was a girl from Surinam called vasutha, that is, via vasut?, from Skt vasudh?.
