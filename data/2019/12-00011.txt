Dear Fran?ois,

you may also consult Renou's Grammaire Sanscrite p. IVX at the very top of
the page, where he discusses these symbols. He mentions the descriptive
names vajr?k?ti and gajakumbh?k?ti for the jihv?m?l?ya and upadhm?n?ya
symbols, respectively, and that the ardhavisarga is a common substitute for
both.

I do not know who else uses these terms but would very much like to learn
about any sources in Sanskrit.

All the Best,

Victor
