Subject: [INDOLOGY] Aikabhavika-nyaya
Message-ID: <CAN5=mo7Y4XcWzUdWW4E80o-25Tm=oLWUth_BDU6L48O80A6S6A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I hope the early summer is treating you well. I write seeking help with a
reference in Madhus?dana Sarasvat?'s *Ved*?ntakalpalatik*?*. In a
doxographical portion of the text, the author describes one group as
follows:

*Apare tu aikabhavikany?yena ?tmaj??namantare?**?pi** ni?iddhak?myayor
ananu??h?n?t nityanaimittik?nu??h?n?t ca na ?g?mikarmotp?da?**.*
*Vidyam?nasya copabhogena k?ay?t sakalakarmocchedalak?a?am apavargam ?hu?.*

(But others [say], via *aikabhavika-ny**?ya*, as a result of the performance
of the compulsory and occasional [*karmas*] and the non-performance of the
prohibited and voluntary [*karmas*], even without knowledge of *?tman*, there
is no production of future *karma*. They speak of ?release? (*apavarga*) as
characterized by the extirpation of *karma* entirely, due to the exhausting
of present [*karmas*] by means of their enjoyment [in this current birth?].)

I am trying to identify the group Madhus?dana has in mind as well as the
principle/rule of "*aikabhavika*" that he references. The language used in
the passage brings the M?m??sakas quickly to mind; however, the
organization of the treatise would strongly suggest that some Naiy?yika
and/or Vai?e?ika group is at play. I seem to hazily recall that Pra?astap?da
in his *Bh??**ya*, perhaps, records a view along these lines? Yet I would
be surprised to see a [Ny?ya-]Vai?e?ika articulation of *mok?**a* that
gives so small a role to knowledge (cf. "*?tmaj??namantare?**?pi*").

To further complicate the identification, I wonder if *aikabhavika* might
in some way be connected with the well-known discussions of *ekabhavika* rooted
in Yoga-Bh??ya 2.13? I am inclined to read *ekabhavika* in that context as
referring to a type of *karma* that bears fruit in a single subsequent
lifetime,
whereas I read Madhus?dana's *aikabhavika* here to refer to *karma* that
bears fruit and becomes exhausted within the very same lifetime, i.e.,
prior to death. I could certainly be mistaken, however, as I have seen "
*aikbhavika*" in the Brahma-S?tra commentarial literature (3,1.2.8) -- by
Madhus?dana's fellow Advaitins -- in the former sense of *karma* that bears
fruit in the immediately subsequent birth.

I am open to all of your learned suggestions! If it helps at all, Madhus?dana
later casts this viewpoint aside with disdain, calling it so unfounded that
to bother to refute it would only bring shame upon the refuter.

With many thanks for your insights,
