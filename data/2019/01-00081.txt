[INDOLOGY] Extension of Sanskrit Heritage tools with connection to Amba Kulkarni's parser
I checked the declension of *adas* and sarva (f.) on the Sanskrit Heritage
site by going to the dictionary and clicking on the gender identifier.  The
paradigms are correct.  What do you find incorrect and where?
Yours,
Peter
