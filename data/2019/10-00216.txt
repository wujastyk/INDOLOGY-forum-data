Thanks very much, Matthew.
This message came just in time when I was on my way to Paris for a conference, and on the day before the conference I was actually able to see the poster, as well as the entire exhibition.
Cheers,

Dear Indologists,
You may find this to be amusing.
Visiting the huge exhibition of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec currently on view at the Grand Palais in Paris, I was surprised to find, amidst his many posters for theater and cabaret, the one I include here, for a production of the
M?cchaka?ik?, - the title is even given in devanagari at lower right. If you read carefully, you'll see that TL himself is credited with the sets for the fifth act, though I do not know if any trace of these survives, or if it was photographed. They must have been wonderful!
