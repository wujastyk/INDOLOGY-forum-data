Anyway, I've said my piece. And learned more about Godwin's Law. For that I thank you.

 I have to say that this must cross some kind of line of accepted behavior on this list.
  
  I support the expression of a wide range of opinions, even if I don't agree with them. But even if I agreed with you, I would take exception at this kind of language and the vitriol.
