[INDOLOGY] Jesuits on astrology/astrologers in India?
With apologies for cross-posting:
On behalf of a colleague (not an Indologist/South Asianist) who is 
researching the historical attitudes and practices of Jesuits with 
regard to astrology, particularly in the 16th to 17th century, I wonder 
if list members are aware of Jesuit sources that reference astrology or 
astrologers in India. Thanks in advance for any leads.
