Subject: [INDOLOGY] Jesuits on astrology/astrologers in India?
Message-ID: <5db084e3-61ed-06d4-d0e7-892cb8e883ee@gmail.com>

With apologies for cross-posting:

On behalf of a colleague (not an Indologist/South Asianist) who is 
researching the historical attitudes and practices of Jesuits with 
regard to astrology, particularly in the 16th to 17th century, I wonder 
if list members are aware of Jesuit sources that reference astrology or 
astrologers in India. Thanks in advance for any leads.
