[INDOLOGY] question on the use of the grammatical category of aspect in classical Tamil studies
Dear Manu
Thank you very much for the information. Aspect has thus entered classical Tamil studies only last year. What I have seen of it, the book does not offer a full-fledged explanation of the category of aspect in Ca?kam Tamil texts. Aspect is just called in here and there. I wonder what use it has for a proper understanding of the texts. On p. 156 a line from Ku?untokai 275 is quoted: ka??a?am varuka? ce?m? t??i, in which ka??a?am would have an "aspectual impact". What is that? (but one again, I am not a linguist pur sang). The woman speaking in this poem says to her companion "you go, we, being persons who have seen, will come back", that is, "you go, (don't be afraid, we are not running away) we will come back after we have seen/have found out if the bell we hear is the bell of a cow coming back from the fields or the one from the chariot of my husband/lover returning from the battle field".
With the best wishes, Herman

Dear List members, At the moment I am going through Lynn Ate, Tirma?kai ??v?r's Five Shorter Works. At several occasions she uses the term "aspect". E.g. on p. 107 in a note discussing the form ???a?ai, "you bore, gave birth to". She calls it a perfective aspect formation, apparently typical of classical Tamil. On p. 82 she analyses ???y as a 2nd person singular perfective aspect "you became", i.e. "you are".
I have a feeling that I have missed something (but then, I am not a linguist pur sang), namely when (or by whom) the term "aspect" has been introduced in classical Tamil studies (I am not talking about modern Tamil studies)? Tense is an obvious problem in classical Tamil poetry. has the concept of aspect been introduced to solve this problem?
With the best wishes, Herman
