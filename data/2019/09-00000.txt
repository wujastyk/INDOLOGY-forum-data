[INDOLOGY] Fairy lore...
Dear colleagues,
I'd be extremely grateful if anyone could provide me with a soft copy of
the following article (the journal edition appears not to be available
online):
Ram Prasad Bhatt, Heinz Werner Wessler & Claus Peter Zoller (2014) "Fairy
lore in the high mountains of South Asia and the hymn of the Garhwali fairy
'Daughter of the Hills'", *Acta Orientalia *75: 79-166.
Many thanks in advance to anyone who can help!
Robert
