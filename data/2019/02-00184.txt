It is not the case. Instead, Lubom?r Ondra?ka is absolutely correct:
"PW references to MBh are to the first complete edition prepared by  
Bengali pandits in Calcutta and published by various publishers in  
1834-39 in four volumes. This edition counts verses continuously  
within each parvan."
Example (chosen at random):
PW s.v. a????ga:
"kaccid a????gasa?yukt? caturvidhabal? cam?? Mbh. 2, 197" (cp.  
Monier-Williams s.v. a????ga: "[MBh. ii, 197]")
= Mah?bh?rata, [ed. Calcutta 1834, Vol. 1], 2 (= Sabh?parvan), verse 197
which corresponds to 2.5.53ab (crit. ed.) or 2.5.63ab (ed. Poona 1929,  
with N?laka??ha's commentary).
Best,
