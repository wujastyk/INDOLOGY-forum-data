[INDOLOGY] Vedic Sample texts with all vedic accents
Dear Krishnaprasad,
1) You can see the usage of the Sama veda accents and marks in the
omkArasAmaH manuscript in the "The Vedic Manuscript Collections of the
Joglekar, Kodlekere and Samba Diksita families of Gokarna" collection of
the Muktabodha digital library.
The direct link to the manuscript is:

2) candrabindu over virama (ABF3) and double candrabindu over virama
(ABF4)  can be seen in Sastri and Rangacharya's edition ot the Taittiriya
samhita.. (I don't have my library with me so I can't send you examples of
this but I suspect this edition is in archive.org .
3) double svarita 1CDA . I haven't seen this in printed editions of the
taittiriya samhita (such as Sastri and Rangacharya's edition mentioned
above) but I've seen this in some chanting books of the Rudram .
4) triple svarita 1CDB . So any information about this accent from list
members would be appreciated.
Regards,
Harry Spier
