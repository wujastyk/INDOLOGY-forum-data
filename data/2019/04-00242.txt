Dear Raja,

A couple of perhaps obvious suggestions (and apologies if they've already
been mentioned):

The volume *Ahi?s?, Anek?nta and Jainism* edited by Tara Sethia (2004?).

And Johannes Bronkhorst has written (at least?) two papers on anek?ntav?da:

"Jainism's First Heretic and the Origin of anek?ntav?da" in *Jainism and
Early Buddhism: Essays in Honour of Padmanabh S. Jaini* edited by Olle
Qvarnstr?m, 2003.

and

"Anek?ntav?da, the central philosophy of ?j?vikism?" *International Journal
of Jaina Studies *2013.


Best wishes,

Robert
