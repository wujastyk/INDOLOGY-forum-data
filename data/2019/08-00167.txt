[INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
Many thanks to all who replied to this question. There are clearly many 
variants of proverbs including Saturn (I particularly enjoyed 
??????????? ????? ????????? ?????????????, found in Jensen). 
Interpretations of what it means to 'have Saturn in one's mouth/on one's 
tongue' seem to differ to some extent, from being dissatisified to 
constantly saying the wrong thing to causing or predicting misfortune.
Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
