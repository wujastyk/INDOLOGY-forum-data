[INDOLOGY] Madhavacharya
A nuanced discussion of the problem of the authorship of the SDS (which includes the evaluation of Thakur's arguments) is available in Jon Yamashita's thesis: A Translation and Study of the P??inidar?ana Chapter of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha (1998), pp. 22?32. It is partly inconclusive:
In conclusion, both internal and external evidence suggests that the author of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha was not M?dhav?c?rya, the elder brother of S?ya?a. Rather, the author must have been at least a generation later than M?dhav?c?rya. Two possible candidates which have been proposed are [1] the son of S?ya?a ? whose name M?ya?a is to be considered a corruption or regional form of "M?dhava", and [2] Cannibha??a, the naiy?yika author of the Tarkabh???prak??ik? ? either independently or as part of a committee. There is no direct proof to support either choice; the available evidence, however, allows each to be given serious consideration as possible candidates for the authorship. At most, we can say with certainty that under either claim, the Sarvadar?anasa?graha would have been composed during the fourteenth century under the patronage of the Vijayanagara court. (p. 31)
