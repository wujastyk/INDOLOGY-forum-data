[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Krishnaprasad,
I've attached a pdf of 4 examples of the cluster ?tr taken from the the
paper transcripts of the IFP .  These are handwritten in  the 50's and 60's
.  They are by different scribes and they all use virama.  I didn't find
any in the IFP transcripts that had the tra underneath, but I stopped
searching after these four.
