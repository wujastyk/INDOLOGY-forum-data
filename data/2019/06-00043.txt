There is an excellent image of two wrestlers going at it on an inscribed
slab in the Peshawar Museum  which is generally described as a "wrestler's
weight." It is illustrated, among other places, in the exhibition catalogue
"Gandhara: das Buddhistiche Erbe Pakistans," no. 220, p. 324. A scan of the
image is attached. For the inscription, see CKI no. 143 (
