[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 73, Issue 17
  The issue of the chinkara interested me, so I went first to Turner's
dictionary. Var?hamihira in his *B?hatsa?hit?* mentions a *chikkara* in
85.20b, 38b, and 44a in the context of omens. The 1946 translation of
Subrahmanya Sastri and Ramakrishna Bhat makes a mess of the situation by
translating the first "musk rat (or civet cat)," the second as "a kind of
deer" (but reading a chimaeric *dhikkara*) and the third as "jackal?." But
Pa?j?b? *cak?ra* and Hind? *chik?r?* (whence the English term) make very
likely that we are dealing here with the same animal. MW does give for
*chikkara* "a kind of animal" and for *chikk?ra* "a kind of antelope," both
entries literally translated  from the big St. Petersburg lexicon of
B?htlingk and Roth. Burrow ("Dravidian Studies VII," BSOAS 12 (1948), p.
379, ?145) suggests a Dravidian origin for the Sanskrit word on the basis
of Kannada *cigari*.
  Nevertheless, although *chikkara*/*chikk?ra* may have at some point
become the scientific Sanskrit term for the species *Gazella Bennettii*, I
feel that for general purposes the ubiquitous Sanskrit *m?ga* may have been
broad enough to encompass all the infra-order *Pecora* (deer, antelopes,
giraffes, and whatnot). Perhaps our seeing *m?ga* as "deer" rather than as
"antelope" is best seen as the inheritance of a restrictive choice on the
part of Victorian translators? (as the mostly wrong "swan" for *ha?sa*, etc.).
Common usage Sanskrit seems to me rather sloppy in some departments of
animal taxonomy, with *pata?ga* being almost any flying insect except for
the hyper-fetishized bees (butterflies, moths, and even locusts) etc.
  In a passage of the *M?lasarv?stiv?davinaya* dealt with by Schopen (*Buddhist
Monks*, 232), instructions are given on the *dharmacakrapravartana* symbol
to be engraved on the monastery's seals ("in the middle draw the wheel, and
on both sides [draw] **m?ga*s: on top the name of the owner of the
monastery should be drawn," *dbus su 'khor lo bris la glo gnyis su ri dgas
'og tu gtsug lag khang gi bdag po'i ming bri bar bya'o*, Derge, 'Dul ba,
Tha 8a6-7). The word given in the Tibetan is *ri dags* ("mountain beast")
which is the standard translation of *m?ga*. I sense that had the ancient
translators seen anything unusual like *chikkara* they would not have used
the generic term.
  I hope this is of any use!
