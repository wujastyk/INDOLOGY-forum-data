[INDOLOGY] question
Dear List members,
someone (not a sanskritist and unaware of diacritics) asked me what the following stanza means:
atiparicayadavajna / samtatagamanadanadro bhavati.
malaye bhillaparandhri / candanatarukastham indhanam kurute.
Some parts, like malaye ... candanatarukastham indhanam kurute, are clear but I do not know what to make of the second p?da.
I look forward to suggestions.
