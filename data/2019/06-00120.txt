Dear David
That?s absolutely marvellous - a beautifully clear and searchable copy.
I?m primarily looking into this for an online bibliography of Dhammapada/Dharmapada/Ud?navarga literature. The publishers only want me to list material that is currently available, but I will be able to add the new edition when it is published. (Most of the Dharmapada material in the Mah?vastu will no doubt be in vol. III.)
Many thanks -
Valerie
