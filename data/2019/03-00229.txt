[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
HOWEVER, if we accept the verse without emendation, should not we read it
in the way the author KNEW that 99 percent of his contemporaneous readers
would read it?
The verse you quoted:
janmalagnapatir uttamav?ryo yadg?he janu?i tatra ca d???e |
tena v? *sahita asya* ca labdhis tad yath??gasukham abdatanau sy?t ||
The translation you proposed (I supply the words on which each part is
based, if I understand your analysis and interpretation correctly):
***
As the meaning is quite technical, I give my translation:
'If the house in which (yadg?he) the ruler of the ascendant of the nativity
(janmalagnapatir) is [placed] with excellent strength (uttamav?ryo) in the
nativity is aspected (tatra ... d???e) or (v?) joined by that [ruler] (tena
... *sahite*), [there is] attainment (labdhis) of [the matter signified by]
that [house] (asya): for example (tad yath?), [if it is placed] in the
ascendant of the year (abdatanau), there will be (sy?t) be pleasures of the
body (a?gasukham).'
***
Now, reading the verse ? if specialists familiar with the text agree there
is no reason to propose any ad hoc emendation ? with similar conceptual
interpretations BUT in the way the author KNEW that 99 percent of his
contemporaneous readers would read it (and paying more attention to the two
*ca*?s, and letting both *tatra* and *tena* refer anaphorically to *yadg**?*
*he*) we get something that perhaps amounts to the same but is based on a
different *anvaya*... :
If in a house *(yadg?he)* in a nativity (janu?i) the ruler of the ascendant
of the nativity (janmalagnapatir) is having excellent strength, *and* *[ca,
extending the noun phrase] *is there *(tatra)* [in that house, positively]
aspected, or if [the ruler...] is (if not placed in that house, at least)
joined (*sahita**[?]*) with it *(tena)* [with the house], then *also [ca,
perhaps referring to a statement in a previous verse, other conditions
favouring labdhis?]* [there is] attainment of [the matter signified by]
that [house] (asya): for example (tad yath?), [if it is placed] in the
ascendant of the year (abdatanau), there will be (sy?t) pleasures of the
body (a?gasukham).
Bottom line: the use of square (and round) brackets is very much required
when analysing Sanskrit especially in scientific or philosophical arguments
Torsten Much, Isabelle Rati? on *Dharmak?rti?s Theory of Exclusion* recently
announced for "those among you who are still happy with square brackets".
