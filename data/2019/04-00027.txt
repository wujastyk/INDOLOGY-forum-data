[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
  Dear all,
  The discussion has been going on for a while, but I felt I had to say
something too. I feel very strongly about these matters, and I think that
if INDOLOGY works at all like a trade guild of sorts, these are points that
we should discuss.
  To Dr. Truschke, I would like to say thank you for bringing this forward.
I would encourage you to reach out with further specifics. I would be happy
to be of help in documenting anything untoward that you have experienced.
  To Dr. Ruiz Falqu?s, that equality and equity are two very different
things. Blindly equal treatment for all persons under our current patterns
of dominance replicates those very same patterns of dominance. Equity is
the push to subvert that by giving preferential treatment to
underrepresented groups. The pay gap is an incontrovertible reality, in
general and in academia in particular. As a man, if a woman with equal
qualifications was preferred to me in a job search, I would be sincerely
happy because it would mean that the times are changing.
