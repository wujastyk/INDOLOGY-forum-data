[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Sri Madhav Deshpande Acharya Ji
Thanks a lot for providing the images of ?????, and personally l took like
????? itself and not the hanging one.
This we can change in rules. If 2 or 3 seconds pause is given at the time
of typeset we will get ????? otherwise we will get the hanging one.
could you please suggest how ????????  is written in old MSS
Thanks a lot
Krishna Prasad
