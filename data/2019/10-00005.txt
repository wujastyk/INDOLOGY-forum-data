forematter, any editorial comments, notes etc. From a very technical point
of view, the work of the editors consisted of selecting preexisting text,
choosing what to print, and printing that. (Again, please, I'm not saying
that is what we really do, but I'm saying from the point of view of law
about creativity this seems to me the way it would be seen).
Anyway, thanks in part to the inspiration of Dominik I have been making
efforts as far as i am able to present all my own work in Open Access form
(but I have tenure and don't have to worry about being judged, I know
this). One example: the edition of the *Pra?nottararatnam?lik?* I recently
published in the IIJ is Open Access (but actually I try to post all my own
stuff online anyway... And I do not plan to publish any scholarly book in
the future that is not Open Access.)
