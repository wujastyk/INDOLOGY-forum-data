Dear colleagues,

(apologies for x-posting)

I would like to draw your attention to a new publication in the series 
"Beitraege zur Kultur- und Geistesgeschichte Asiens" of the Austrian 
Academy of Sciences Press, continuing Viennese efforts to link 
philological and philosophical research:

Pascale Hugon / Jonathan Stoltz: "The Roar of a Tibetan Lion - Phya pa 
Chos kyi seng ge's Theory of Mind in Philosophical and Historical 
Perspective"

This book explores the contributions to the philosophy of mind made by 
the Tibetan Buddhist thinker Phya pa Chos kyi seng ge (1109?1169) in his 
seminal text, the ?Dispeller of the Mind?s Darkness.? This study, which 
includes a critical edition and English translation of those portions of 
the ?Dispeller? devoted to explicating the nature of mental episodes and 
their objects, contributes to a deeper understanding of Tibetan 
intellectual history, while also facilitating a wider appreciation of 
both Phya pa?s theory of mind and its significance within the global 
history of philosophy.

The book can be ordered via the Press' website 
(https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/the-roar-of-a-tibetan-lion) and is also 
available for download in Open Access.

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner (series editor)
