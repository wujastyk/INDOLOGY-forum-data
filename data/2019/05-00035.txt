Dear list members,



The initial response to our crowdfunding campaign to support the ongoing study and conservation of Gandhari manuscripts has been excellent. We have received numerous requests for further information from interested scholars in both public and private communications, in response to which we have updated the crowdfunding page with further details on the state and status of the scrolls and how the funds will be spent (https://crowdfunding.sydney.edu.au/project/10335/updates/1). Further updates will be given on the site as we move from funding into implementation of the project.

Thank you to all those who have supported this initiative so far and please pass on the crowdfunding request to your own networks.

Best wishes

Mark Allon

Dear Mark,



thank you for your post ? this is very interesting, both the material and the crowdfunding experiment!



I have three questions about the two scrolls and the plans you have for them:



   1. How extensive are the preserved texts? Some other fragments

      of the Pratyutpannabuddhasa?mukh?vasthitasam?dhis?tra scroll

      were just published in JIABS



         Harrison, Paul, Timothy Lenz and Richard Salomon. 2018.

         ?Fragments of a G?ndh?r? Manuscript of the

         Pratyutpannabuddhasa?mukh?vasthitasam?dhis?tra (Studies

         in G?ndh?r? Manuscripts 1).? Journal of the International

         Association of Buddhist Studies 41: 117?143.



      but those amount to a total of only eleven partial lines:



         https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/l_HNCnxyErCBlg4ws9s7BN?domain=gandhari.org



      Are the new fragments more substantial? Concerning the

      Sam?dhir?jas?tra, only the left half of the scroll appears

      to be preserved, i.e., half of each line will be missing.

      How many lines are in that fragment?



   2. Which concrete tasks do you plan to use the funding you

      raise for ? research assistants, travel, equipment? The

      crowdfunding description only has a very general reference

      to ?research, consulting and resources.?



   3. Images of these two scrolls in their rolled?up state (like

      the one you show on your page) were circulated fifteen years

      ago by a London?based art dealer looking for a buyer. Are

      the scrolls with you in Sydney now? Did you buy them?



All best,

Stefan
