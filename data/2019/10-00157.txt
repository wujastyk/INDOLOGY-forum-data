[INDOLOGY] Harivamsha publication announcement
Dear colleagues,
I am happy to announce the following publication:
Simon Brodbeck (trans.), Krishna's Lineage: the Harivamsha of Vy?sa's Mah?bh?rata, Translated from the Sanskrit. New York: Oxford University Press, 2019. Pp. xl + 420. Hardback ISBN 9780190279172; paperback ISBN 9780190279189.
It is a complete translation of P. L. Vaidya's critically reconstituted version (Poona, 1969).
There are further details on the publisher's website here:

The translation and its introduction are aimed at the general reader, so I have also published an article which is essentially a companion piece intended for a scholarly audience, discussing in some depth the edition used, the emendations made, the translation strategies adopted, and a few of the trickier passages:
Simon Brodbeck, "Translating Vaidya's Hariva??a", Asian Literature and Translation 6.1 (2019), pp. 1?187.
Abstract and download of that paper are available here:

With all best wishes,
Simon Brodbeck
