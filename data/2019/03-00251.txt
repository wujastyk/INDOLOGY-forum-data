[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
Possibility of avagrahas when ? preceded by ? and ?
?? ???? = ??????
?????? ??= ????????
Possibility of avagrahas when visarga is dropped
hrsva ?? + ? = ? is dropped and optionally to indicate ? avagraha is used
Possibility of avagrahas and double avagrahas in SavarNadirgha Sandhi( in
South Indian style and North Indian styles)
South Indian style(commonly seen in Nirnay Sagar press books Vani Vilas etc)
? represents ? (not ?) and it is never used in compound words
??? ?????= ????????  but never used in compound words, for example,
???+????= ??????? and not ????????
??? ???????= ??????????? and this also never used in compound words.
North Indian style ( especially in Navya Nyaya texts )
? represents ? (not ?) and used both  in compound words and non compound
words
????????
???????????
I hope this is clear when double avagraha is used.
Best
