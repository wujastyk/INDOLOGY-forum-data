[INDOLOGY] Ancient Museum
Friends:
While we have references to chitrashalas or a gallery of paintings, and in medieval India, as in Bundi for example, we have rooms in the fort where every inch is painted and it looks like a picture gallery, is there any reference to Museums, as we know it today, in ancient India?
Kind regards,
