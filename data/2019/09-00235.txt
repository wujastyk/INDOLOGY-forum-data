says,
The electronic text of the Mahabharata is Copyright (C) The Bhandarkar

In other words, help yourself, but only from that Bombay website.
This is why the Puna Mbh has never been offered through SARIT.  The
text at SARIT <http://sarit.indology.info/mahabharata-devanagari.xml?view=div>
is the 1906-1910 edition from Nirnayasagara Press,
Bombay, "A New Edition Mainly Based on the South Indian Texts, with
Footnotes and Readings."
I'm fully aware that the Pune Mbh has long ago escaped into the wild
and is offered everywhere.  I think that's a wonderful thing for
scholarship (though bad for version control).  But it does not reflect
the wishes of BORI.  I'm just sayin'
Best,
