Dear Colleagues,

out of curiosity, would any of you have knowledge about the word jolokia 
in the name of the infamous chili pepper Naga Jolokia (also Bhut Jolokia 
and Bih Jolokia, where Bhut is definitely ??? and Bih may be a tadbhava 
from ???). At any rate, I'd welcome any hints about jolokia: what 
language this word is in, and what its original meaning may be. The 
spelling in the original language is also of interest.

Thank you,

Daniel
