Dear Prof Gansten,

Thanks very much for your email. Indeed the discussion is about determining
the most suitable time for following certain rituals. But I am curious
about "*bha*" that is prefixed to '*graha*'. In the *Tantr?loka* 28 and the
commentary titled Vivek thereupon by Jayaratha there are expressions like '
*bhagrah?dy?tmana?*' (Viveka on 28.35) where he also quotes a verse that
reads '*bhagrahasamayavi?e?a?*.....'. 28.40ab reads '.....
*bhagrah?dy?tmakatv?t* *vi?e?ar?patvameva* |' In 28.42cd Jayaratha begins
with a question '*nanu kasm?d atra ??vayuje m?si bhagrah?diyogi nokta*....|'
to which Abhinavagupta is supposed to have replied
'*bhagrahasamayavi?e?o*.....|'
28.46cd also reads '*dinavel?bhagrahakalpanena*....|' 28.47cd has '
*bhagrahatithi?'* and in 28.49cd Jayaratha quotes from the *B?hatsa?hit?*
4.4 and concludes after a short discussion there saying *s? hi tithir
ucyate y? bhagrahai? sphu??bhavati.* Again, 28.51d has
*tithibhagrahayogata?* and 28.52a has *bhagrahayog?bh?ve tithi?*.

I think Prof Gnoli also translated the expression as 'asterismi'. I think I
have some clarity now, but it would be nice if some expert is able to throw
more light, may be from Jyoti?a texts.

Many thanks and best wishes.

Mrinal
