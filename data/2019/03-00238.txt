Subject: On Adhyash.

Respected Scholars,
Adhyash happens to be a significant concept in Vedanta philosophy.So far,"Superimposition" is the only word which I came across,as a literal translation of Adhyash in English.Is there any other word ,in the philosophical context,which tantamounts to Adhyash?
