Here two of his own papers on the subject:
That is:
- The 24th Chapter of the Tattvasa?graha: Refutation of the M?m??s? doctrine of ved?pauru?eyatva, Studies in M?m??s?: Dr. Mandan Mishra Felicitation Volume, ?d. R. C. Dwivedi, Delhi, 1994, pp. 117-129.
- La querelle de la M?m??s? et du Bouddhisme autour de l??ternit? du V?da, L?Orient des Dieux (publ. of the Universit? Saint-Joseph, Beyrouth) 6-7, 2006-2007, pp. 5-20.
See also by Kiyotaka Yoshimizu in Bronkhorst ed. 2007, pp. 220-224
https://www.academia.edu/32176020/_Kum?rila_s_Reevaluation_of_the_Sacrifice_and_the_Veda_from_a_Ved?nta_Perspective._
and the book of Elstchinger - Krasser and Taber, Can the Veda speak? Dharmak?rti against M?m??s? exegetics and Vedic authority, Vienna: OAW, 2012.
This is only a few references on the topic, related to PM. The apauru?eyatva of the Veda is also something found with Bhart?hari and Man?d?ana Mi?ra (Hugo David is saying that somewhere).
Le 4 nov. 2019 ? 14:07, Dean Michael Anderson via INDOLOGY <indology at list.indology.info<mailto:indology at list.indology.info>> a ?crit :
Does anyone know the origin of the term and concept that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya", eternal and uncreated by humans?
I have heard it might have originated in Karma Mimamsa.
Also, any information about how it was conceived, discussed and debated would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Dean
