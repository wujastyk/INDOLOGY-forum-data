Subject: [INDOLOGY] Continuing my Krishna verses

Nice balance of regular pathy? anu??hubh ?lokas and rare permitted
deviations:
here (648) the na-vipul? in a and c give it a 'magic' touch;
followed by the next verse (649) with bha-vipul? in c:
???? ?????? ??????????: ??????????????? ?? ???? ?
??????? ????? ????? ?????: ????? ???: ???????
The fire of Krishna burns in my heart, but the moon of Krishna also shines
in my heart.
Krishna calms my heart suffering for Krishna with his own hands.
As for karai? in 649c, as it is intended as 'hands', apparently of the
personal Krishna, a strict application of P??ini (AA 1.4.22 dvyekayor
dvivacanaikavacane) would inevitably lead to the form kar?bhy?m, which,
however, would give a hypermetric p?da of 9 syllables, and hence a conflict
with the principle api m??a? ma?a? kury?t chandobha?ga? na k?rayet, which,
although it is not P??ini, is rather strictly followed in classical poetry.
Since taptam corresponds to the fire in p?da a, one could have a p?da d
corresponding more explicitly with the moon in p?da b: Krishna brings peace
through the beams of the moon, the Soma-beams: a??ubhi?, which, as
'??ubhi?, would fit the metre perfectly. An objection could then
nevertheless be that this gives an undesirable mixture of styles:
everywhere expressions that are beautiful because of their simplicity, and
here suddenly a 'learned' expression a??ubhi? as moon- or Soma-beams. At
the end, we can, then, leave the verse as created by the Poet as it is, and
only change the translation: instead of "with his own hands" the
translation of karai? should be "with is own 'hands', i.e. moon-rays": the
plural itself indicates that kara stands not for 'hands' but for the rays,
in this case of the moon in p?da b.
Best, Jan


a??ubhi?
