[INDOLOGY] Identififying Ceylonese toponym Cauraga(s)hing
Dear Jan, knowing next to nothing about Sri Lanka, I may be completely off
the mark here. But given that we're talking about a mountain, I would guess
"shing" is cognate of Sanskrit ???ga, "horn, peak". I don't think an
Englishman of that time would have pronounced "sh" as anything other than
English *sh*, nor do I see any reason to drop the s from the name as you
seem to suggest. If the Sinhalese word caura/cora is also a Sanskrit
cognate, then again, it can probably be ruled out; Knox would surely have
pronounced "c" as the phoneme *k* and would have written "ch" if he had
meant a palatal affricate.
Best wishes,
Daniel
