Of course, technically, Tri?a?ku does not seek to enter the heavenly world(s) through tapas, but rather by having a sacrifice performed on his behalf for this purpose. Thus he first approaches Vasi??ha, then Vasi??ha?s sons and finally, in his cursed form, Vi?v?mitra. Then there are also various accounts of mortals who are able to travel to heaven in their earthly  bodies on a temporary basis, such as Arjuna at Mbh. 3.43 ff.  and Dil?pa at Raghuva??a 1. 75 ff. etc.
