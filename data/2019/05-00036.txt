[INDOLOGY] the influence of shadows?
Dear Friends,
Might anyone be aware of observations about the influence of shadows in
Classical India? There is a passage in a Buddhist text that speaks of the
positive influence of a dh?ra?? text which is so great that, when it is
held aloft, if one were to merely pass through its shadow... So I know that
this is hyperbolic, but it set me wondering if there are other references
to the effect of shadows...
thanks!
