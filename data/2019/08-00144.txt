[INDOLOGY] PDF needed
Dear list members,
Would anyone be able to provide me with a pdf of  Ghosh's translation of
Natyasastra  verses 28-37-141  and 29.1 - 13.  His english translation of
these chapters is only in the second edition.  And archive.org as far as I
can see only has the first edition.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
