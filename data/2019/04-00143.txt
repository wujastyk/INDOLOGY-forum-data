[INDOLOGY] Transmission of sanskrit grammatical concepts/terminology to Europe
Dear Adriano,
Frits Staals 1972 *A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians* is a mine of
information on the reception of Skt. grammar by early European scholars.
Still available in hard copy from Amazon, and downloadable from Monoskop
<https://monoskop.org/Frits_Staal>.
I've been thinking that the next time I teach a course on vyakarana (I just
finished one), I'll use Staal 1972 and the new ?abda book
<https://cup.columbia.edu/book/a-sabda-reader/9780231548311> that has just
come out by Johannes Bronkhorst.  That's a solid foundation for students
right there.
