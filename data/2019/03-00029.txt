Dear Friends, I would like to ask if you have favorite discussions of
vair?gya in Indological lit., whether essays or books. I have a student
from the Philosophy program interested in writing about vair?gya and
emotional disgust/detachment. I have referred him to Kosambi's great piece
on Bhartrhari, but blanking on a locus classicus for vair?gya per se. As
always I will be very grateful for your help Best,J
