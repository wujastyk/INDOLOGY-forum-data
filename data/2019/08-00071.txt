Dear List members,

The 2020 course ?Lived Sanskrit Cultures in Varanasi? is now open for 
applications. We?d be pleased if you could forward this announcement to 
potential applicants.

The three-week intensive course?Lived Sanskrit Cultures in Varanasi?(Feb 
17 to March 6, 2020) is**designed to impart a practice-oriented training 
in methods of cultural and religious studies, focusing on how Sanskrit 
texts are taught, applied, enacted, inscribed in spaces and lived by 
practitioners, women and men, in Varanasi.

*Areas of study:*

*Teaching Sanskrit and the Veda ? Performing Rituals ? Processions in 
Varanasi ? Goddess Temples in Varanasi ? Indian Calendrical Systems ? A 
Crash Course in Spoken Sanskrit***

breakfast, dinner and local transport. For single room accommodation the
