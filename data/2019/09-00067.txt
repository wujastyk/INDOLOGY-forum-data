[INDOLOGY] Out-of-body experience in Indian religions
 There must be many stories of things like this in texts like the Puranas, but these two references come to mind.
) The biography of Shankara mentions him leaving his body and entering the body of a king. Shankara-dig-vijaya is one of the classic texts on this. Perhaps some know of other sources.
2) Yoga Sutra III.38 says:
By loosening the cause of bondage and through sensitivity to themovements (of the mind), consciousness can enter another body.

 Dear list-members,
A colleague is developing a research project on Out-of-body experiences 
in religious contexts at the turn of the common era and would be 
interested in comparing her material (her focus is on the Mediterranean 
world) with that of other regions.
I have mentioned Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga and the Yoga-V?si??ha 
(though I understand this is a later source) but I would be very 
grateful to anyone who could suggest additional or more pertinent 
sources.
Thank you very much in advance for any help you can provide!
All best,
Jessie Pons
