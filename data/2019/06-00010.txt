[INDOLOGY] Studies on the Rigveda [Addendum: Table of Contents]
Dear listfolk,
on of the chapters here is about the Zehnk?nigsschlacht am Ravifluss,
published separately in the EJVS a few years ago. You may or may not
know that a rebuttal was written to it:
https://talageri.blogspot.com/2017/06/, by Shrikant Talageri, and I
invite those interested in the Battle of the Ten Kings and in Vedic
interpretation generally, to take a look at it.
Yes, me too, like most of you, I am skeptical of the high-strung
language he uses, with e.g. a statement judged "not true" immediately
being dubbed a "lie", as if for every deliberate lie there aren't a
hundred bonafide mistakes. Gossiping socialites and TV debaters will
certainly highlight these flaws to score points against him. Scholars
eager to get closer to the truth, by contrast, like the august crowd
on the present forum, will instead focus on the contents of his
critique. Which is quite pertinent.
Incidentally, I have also written two partly overlapping papers on the
same subject:

Kind regards,
