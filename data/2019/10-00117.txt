[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear all,
  If you check the reading found in the Snar-thang recension of the text, it confirms Peter's speculation; it does, in fact, read:
dpal ldan sgrib byed lha yis ni / ...
In general, Snar-thang presents far more accurate readings (assessed in terms of agreement with extant Sanskrit text) than the Sde-dge recension (whose "revised" readings are often corrupt).
Regards,
