Dear all,

  If you check the reading found in the Snar-thang recension of the text, it confirms Peter's speculation; it does, in fact, read:

dpal ldan sgrib byed lha yis ni / ...

In general, Snar-thang presents far more accurate readings (assessed in terms of agreement with extant Sanskrit text) than the Sde-dge recension (whose "revised" readings are often corrupt).

Regards,

Paul Hackett

Are there any Tibetan lists of Indian rulers or personal names in general? Could one think of any plausible explanation for this translation given that the original could have read smth. like ?Thakkana/ ?akuna??
