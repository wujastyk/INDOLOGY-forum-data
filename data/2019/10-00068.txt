Very possible, seems to me. In ??rad?, the two ak?aras tha and ?a are  
semi-homograph. One could, therefore, speculate whether Thakkana was  
first misread to ?akkana/?akuna and then improved to ?akuna. But it's  
just speculation, not more.

Nevertheless, it is also worth reading the section on Candranandana in  
Meulenbeld's "History of Indian Medicine" (see attachment).

Best wishes,
Roland
