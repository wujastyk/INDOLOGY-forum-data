Dear Harry,


A useful source for this is

Marie-Th?r?se de Mallmann, Introduction ? l'iconographie du Tantrisme bouddhique (Paris 1986),

esp. ch. II, "Inventaire des caract?ristiques des divinit?s," which includes thorough lists of attributes.


Of course, this may not be comprehensive for non-Buddhist deities, but the overlap is nonetheless significant.


best,

Matthew

Here's a couple that may be relevant:

Valerie Roebuck, "Weapons as symbols in Indian art" in Symbols in Art and Religion, ed. Karel Werner. London: Curzon Press 1990.

Sarva Daman Singh: Ancient Indian Warfare with special reference to the Vedic Period. Leiden: Brill 1965. (about real weapons, textually and archaeologically)

Hoping that helps,

Dermot

Dear list members,

Would anyhow have or be able to point to articles or lists of names and descriptions of weapons in sanskrit. In particular names and descriptions of weapons described as being held in the hands of gods and goddesses .in the different stotras and descriptions of those deities.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
