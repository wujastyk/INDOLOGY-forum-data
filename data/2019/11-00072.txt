[INDOLOGY] origin and discussion that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya"
While the explicit formulation of the notion of the Veda as Apauru?eya is
found in M?m??s?, Ved?nta and Dharma??stra, it is important to note that a
view that the Vedas are of impersonal and primordial origin is as old as
the Puru?as?kta of the R?gveda, and this view proliferates in the Br?hma?as
and the Upani?ads in various forms, such as the origin of the Vedas from
the primordial sacrifice or being the breath of Praj?pati etc.  The passage
"???? ????????????"(??.??.?-?-??) is often cited in traditional works to
argue for the *nityatva *of the Veda being authorized by the Veda itself.
The statement *anant? vai ved?? *dates to the Br?hma?a period.  So there is
a long prehistory to the formulation of the Apauru?eyatva theory dating
back to the Vedic period.
