[INDOLOGY] Recent article in Science on Rakhigarhi genome
Tried to access the recent article "The formation of human populations in
South and Central Asia" by Vagheesh Narasimhan et al published in the
journal Science [Sept 6, 2019], but could not get access to it through the
University of Michigan Library.  I am wondering if someone has downloaded
this article and can share with me.  Thanks.
