Subject: [INDOLOGY] Recent article in Science on Rakhigarhi genome
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdcdhgxrE+avs7sEF_wHmxmCFE5gdGgUWhAdNt-WE4+Qw@mail.gmail.com>

Tried to access the recent article "The formation of human populations in
South and Central Asia" by Vagheesh Narasimhan et al published in the
journal Science [Sept 6, 2019], but could not get access to it through the
University of Michigan Library.  I am wondering if someone has downloaded
this article and can share with me.  Thanks.
