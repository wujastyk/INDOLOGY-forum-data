[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
Dear Harry,
     You have raised an interesting question.  The term *avagraha *is used
in older texts like the Pr?ti??khyas and ?ik??s to refer to a pause between
members of compounds in the Padap??ha, and some texts like the
?aunak?ya-Catur?dhy?yik? (3.3.35: ?????????????????????????????? ?????????:
???:) assign the duration of a *m?tr? *to this type of *avagraha*.  The
written sign of *avagraha *(?) in later times got extended to cases like
?????? and ??????, and yet I have not seen evidence for this extension in
any of the phonetic texts, and to my knowledge there is no actual pause in
recitation in these cases.  Such a pause would create difficulties with the
meters.  How, when and why the term *avagraha *and the written sign (?) got
extended to such uses needs to be investigated.  But it has no phonetic
value as far as I know.
