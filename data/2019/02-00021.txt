[INDOLOGY] Varendra Research Insitute (Rajshahi, Bangladesh)
Dear members of the list,
I am currently looking at several Skt MSS listed in the NCC with a reference to ?A hand list of 1935 manuscripts in the Varendra Research Society, Rajshahi? (nr. 0888 in Biswas? survey). I wonder if any one of you may have already dealt with MSS from this collection and if you may know anything about its current location and accessibility. I would greatly appreciate any help or advice on this issue.
Many thanks in advance!
best,
Andrey
