 Dear list members,

Verse 3 of a version of the Devi Suktam I have agrees with the verse in the
Markendaya Purana in GRETIL.


kaly??yai pra?at?? v?ddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo nama?

nair?tyai bh?bh?t?? lak?myai ?arv??yai te namo nama?


I've been told  pra?at?? is the genitive plural of the noun pra?at .

But  pra?at is not in Monier-Williams or in Bohtlink-Roth .

Note: nat is in MW    "nat mfn. (? nam) bowing, bowing one's self (ifc.)"

but not in Boehtlink-Roth.

1) Can someone confirm that   pra?at?? in the verse is genitive plural of
pra?at (and not feminine accusative of   pra?at?)

2) Has anyone come across the noun  pra?at anywhere in the literature.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
