[INDOLOGY] New summer languages programs for Sanskrit and Tibetan at McGill University
Dear colleagues,
I?m delighted to share (with apologies for cross-posting) that we will be
offering both introductory Sanskrit and Tibetan at McGill University this
summer.
McGill, one of Canada?s premier universities, is located in the heart of
Montreal, a multilingual, culturally diverse and dynamic city. Intensive
first-year Sanskrit and intensive first-year Colloquial Tibetan are being
offered by the School of Religious Studies through the McGill Summer
Language Institute. The dates for these courses are:
May 6-June 7, 2019: Colloquial Tibetan (RELG 269; 6 credits)
June 10-July 17, 2019: Intensive Introductory Sanskrit (RELG 257D1-D2; 6
credits)
Additional information about registration, tuition, and housing is
available through our website:

I have attached a flyer for these new summer courses and we would be
grateful if you could share this information with your students and
colleagues. Please don?t hesitate to be in touch with any questions.
With thanks and best wishes,
Hamsa
