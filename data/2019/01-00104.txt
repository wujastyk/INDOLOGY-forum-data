[INDOLOGY] Descriptions of the Sandhya rituals
Dear Harry,
an old classic, The Daily Practice of the Hindus: Containing the morning and midday duties, by Srisa Chandra Vasu (rev. ed, published in 1909), has three chapters on sandhy? by "Rig Vedins, S?ma-Vedins, and Yajur-Vedins". I think this book may serve you as a starting point in your inquiry.
