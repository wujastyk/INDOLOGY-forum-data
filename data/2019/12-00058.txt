Dear Colleagues,
     With print copies and digital copies of various parts, I have Bha??oji
D?k?ita's ?abdakaustubha only upto the end of the 4th Adhy?ya.  Was the
remaining ?abdakaustubha ever published?  And if so, does anyone have
access to it?  Perhaps, I should look for manuscripts of ?abdakaustubha for
this remaining portion.
