Dear Matthew,
I wasn?t endorsing the tool or its translation, but just helping solve the mystery of how that appeared in a published translation. The other offerings, ?going forth,? etc. obviously allude to the formulaic ?going forth? to pursue the Path, in other words, ? the attitude that is desirous of freedom from the imprisonment of saMsAra and of arriving at the happiness of nirvANa?? So the remaining mystery is why the least appropriate offering was selected.
best,
Dan
