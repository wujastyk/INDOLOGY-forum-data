[INDOLOGY] East and West India mixed references on Archiv - a pdf request
Dear List,
I would like to go through George Thomas ARTOLA (?1920-2010?)'s out-of-print
The banner of K?madeva and other topics of Sanskrit literature and Indian culture
(= vol. 3 of the Monographs of the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies, University of Toronto), Bombay: Popular Prakashan, 1977 (a ? 100 pp. collection of articles).
The book should be on Archiv here:
https://archive.org/details/reseahistricade00batrgoog/
but the scanned file does not correspond to the description (same for the Open Library reference).
The needed document would be available (unfortunately not in Europe) at
https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288225
https://books.google.com/books?id=0VtdvgEACAAJ (= exemplar from University of California)
https://books.google.com/books?id=M6K7NAEACAAJ
As for Archiv problem, since the wording of the link correspond to the presently attached files (the given Google-id being also the one of the Library of Harvard exemplar of Resena Historica de las Municipalidades en Guatemala, https://books.google.com/books?id=f0EXAAAAYAAJ), it would be probably better to preserve it and replace the title and description by the correct ones, and create a new entry for Artola's book.
Thank you for your help,
Best wishes,
