[INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
In an Indian astrological journal from 1963 (/Astrology and Athrishta 
/[= /ad???a/] 1.2), I read:
Are any list members familiar with such a proverb/expression? I have not 
seen it referred to anywhere else, but then Tamil isn't one of my languages.
Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
