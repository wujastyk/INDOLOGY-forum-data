Dear friends/scholars,


Our panel on in shrines in South Asia has been accepted for ECSAS 2020!

It is entitled: "Art, Ritual, and Text at Shrines in South Asia: A
Cross-Disciplinary and Diachronic Investigation of the Forms and Functions
of Shrines". https://ecsas2020.univie.ac.at/panels/rwnxc/


Long Abstract
In recent studies of shrines, altars, and votive offerings?throughout
numerous religious traditions?there has been a vexing issue related to
terminology. In this panel, we broadly apply the term shrine to designate
places where exchanges between divine and devotee take place; these spaces
are often accreted with materials and substances that are traces of these
dynamic interactions. The material culture found at these places can be
vast from paintings, metal statuary, and photographs to dried fish, grains,
and relics. The materiality of the shrine?what it is made of, as well as
the material objects left at these sites?is only part of the story. Some
shrines have rich histories and deep connections with communities of faith.
In some cases, shrines are places people have visited for centuries to
increase fertility, to ask for forgiveness, to gain favor, to earn
protection, and much more. Textually, altars and shrines are often
carefully described and discussed in both ritual texts and hagiographic
accounts where shrines often serve as backdrops for religious rites and
spaces to express gratitude, among many other functions.

Organic, interactive, and layered, these often pastiche-like constructions
are indices of the ever-evolving and deeply meaningful relationships
between shrines and their communities. This panel invites papers that
investigate these relationships and strata of material found at these
complex sites throughout South Asia within its numerous religious
expressions. Of particular interest are papers that include, but are not
limited to, analyses of aesthetics, art history, ethnographic survey, space
production, material culture, & ritual.
