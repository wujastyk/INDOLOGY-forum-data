Dear all,

Thanks to everyone who replied! In case anyone is interested, here is S. 
C. Banerji's article from the Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, 
Vol. VIII (1958-1959) where he collects quotations of the H?r?ta 
Dharmas?tra (thanks to the magic of North American interlibrary loan):

https://archive.org/details/ReconstructionOfDharmasutrasHaritaSureshChandraBanerji

It seems to be a little different from the same list in Banerji 1962, 
/Dharmas?tras: A Study in their Origin and Development, /pp. 257-289. 
I'm still mystified by the precise chapter and verse numbers cited by 
the publication I mentioned previously, but who knows.

Best,

Charles
