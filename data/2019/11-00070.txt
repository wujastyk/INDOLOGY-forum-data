Just to add to Jan?s excellent synopsis, Jan?s statement about "only P?rva-m?m??s? and Ved?nta? were committed to the apauru?eya view can be supplemented by bringing in Dharma??stra, which was also generally committed to this view. And the broader acceptance of it during the medieval period may have been due to the extraordinary influence of this literary and scientific tradition on the general ?Hindu? views.
