discovered in 1817 by a certain Franklin Lewis Cole (if I read correctly)
and the eye-copy made later, as the sheet is made with several sheets
having the watermark ?B&T SWEETAPPLE 1829?. And there is a label ?R.B. N?
52 1833? which refers to a collection (maybe Regis Bibliotheca, that is the
BnF name, I suppose, during the ?Monarchie de Juillet?).
Here are some pictures:

Could any knowledgeable people among you enlighten me about this
inscription?
Especially concerning the placenames mentioned, Franklin Lewis Cole, and
any reference to a publication.
With a great many thanks in advance for any clue.
With very best wishes.
