[INDOLOGY] Non being
Dear Adriano,
The issue tends to be diffused through discussions of topics such as anupalabdhi and abhAva, so there is quite a lot inter alia in works on Indian epistemology (e.g., Matilal's Perception). See, for instance, Dhirendra Sharma, EPISTEMOLOGICAL NEGATIVE DIALECTICS OF INDIAN LOGIC ? "ABH?VA" VERSUS "ANUPALABDHI":

A recent volume that may be helpful to you is:

good luck,
