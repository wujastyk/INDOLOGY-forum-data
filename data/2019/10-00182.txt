Dear Alf,

Glad to be of help.  There are several editions digitized by Hathi Trust.  I can't wish you to enjoy them.  They are depressingly bigoted.

All the best,

Rosane

Dear Alf,

You are probably thinking of William Ward's A View of the History, Literature and Religion of the Hindoos, Serampore: [Mission Press], several editions from 1817 on, with slight variations in title.  Consistently derogatory comments on Hindu matters.  Much quoted in his times.

Dear Colleagues,

I am writing about  Catholic and Protestant responses to Hindu sacrifice in the colonial period.

Could anyone supply me withe Will Sweetman?s book, Reading Jesuits Reading Hinduism, and his book on Hinduism in the colonial period?

I am also trying to recall a book I think by someone with the surname Ward which I recall as a pertinent diatribe agains Hindu sacrifices. Does anyone know it?

For comparative purpose I am also interested to know of studies of Jain and Buddhist funerary practices in the colonial period.

Please excuse the fishing trip sound of these requests. Anything about colonial period responses to Hindu polytheism generally would be most appreciated.

Best regards,
Alf

Dear colleagues,

There are two works I need. Is it possible that one or more of you could supply me with either of them?

Daniel H. H. Ingalls, ?Words for Beauty in Classical Sanskrit Poetry,? in Studies in Honor of W. Norman Brown, 87-107, New Haven: American Oriental Society.

And,

Eveline Meyer, ?the Greatness of Ankalaparamecuvari, told through the story of how Paramacivan plucked the head of Piramma in the play called the destruction of Turuvacar,? in: Lothar Lutze, Ed. Drama in Contemporary South Asia: Variations and Settings, South Asian Digest of Regional Writing, vol. 10 (1981), Heidelberg (sorry but my. Source does not list the pages)

Many thanks,

Alf Hiltebeitel
