Dear Colleagues,
I would appreciate references to studies of Kalidasa?s Kumarasambhava. I am aware of work by Gary Tubb, David Smith, Ayal Amer, Martina Jackmuth, and contributions (though not pointed studies) by Daniel Ingalls, Yigal Bronner, David Shulman, and Edwin Gerow. Is Prof. Tubb?s dissertation, "The Kuma?rasam?bhava in the light of Indian theories of the Maha?ka?vya" available? Proquest/UMI seems not to have a master from which to order a copy.
Many thanks,
