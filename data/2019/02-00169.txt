[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Prof Dominik Wujastyk
Awesome! This is one of the greatest things I have received. I am
grateful to you. You made my burden reduce.
I am attaching the same conjunct list to this email which is searchable.
But the list is not having Nuktas
Thanks a lot
