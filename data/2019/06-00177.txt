[INDOLOGY] ISO15919 and case insensitivity
Dear Jan, thanks a lot for your comments and for your offer of help. I am
delighted to learn that ISO15919 is periodically reviewed. I'm also glad
that you don't consider the use of uppercase for a particular purpose to be
strictly non-conformant to the standard. I think there is an important line
of reasoning there, and would like to note in addition that - if we adopt
this notation after all - we would not be suggesting the modification of
the standard as a whole, but rather the addition of an option to the
standard, for use in specific situations where certain aspects of the
original orthography are desired to be retained. It seems to me that if
such an option were to be added to the standard, that would not make all
previously conformant texts non-conformant. I see this as largely analogous
to the option of strict/simplified nasalisation, where the strict option
actually involves a normalisation of orthography and precludes
round-tripping as far as spelling is concerned [?????? > hi?d? > ?????],
while the simplified option prioritises orthography versus phonetic
transcription and allows more accurate round-tripping. Would it not be
possible to add another option to the standard to allow for the distinction
of initial vowels and final consonants (whether through the use of
capitalisation, additional marker characters or a combination of both), and
thus enable accurate round-tripping (pending, of course, the creation of
conversion routines supporting this notation) in cases where an original
document uses these in a way different from "standard" orthography?
All the best,
Daniel
