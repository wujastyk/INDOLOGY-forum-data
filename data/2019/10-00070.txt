[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear Mathew,
I am sure you are right, but it may be worthwhile to look at some of  
the many references he has given.
As I see it, it is crucial that also Kalha?a mentions a ruler named  
Thakkana (RT 6.230, 231, 236) as an adversary of Abhimanyu (ruled  
958-972).
Best,
Roland
