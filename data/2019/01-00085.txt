Dear Colleagues,
Does anyone have (an access to) the following paper

* ?Bha??a Upbha?a?*

*E. A. Solomon*

*Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute*

*Vol. 58/59, Diamond Jubilee Volume (1977-1978), pp. 985-992*

https://www.jstor.org/stable/41691765?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents  ?

Unfortunately, I do not have any access to it, and would greatly appreciate
a copy of it.

Best regards,

Piotr Balcerowicz
