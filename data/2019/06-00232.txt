[INDOLOGY] Medinikosha and Nanartharnavasankshepa - request for scan
Dear scholars,
Would anyone of you kindly guide me to a decent quality scans of the
following works please -
1. N?n?rth?r?avasa?k?epa of Ke?avasv?min
2. N?n?rtha?abdako?a of Medinikara.
I have scans probably gathered from archive.org which are not legible.
Visarga, anusv?ra etc are not visible at places.
