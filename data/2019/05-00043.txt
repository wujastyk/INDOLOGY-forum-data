Thanks to Herman Tieken and Madhav Deshpande for their immediate 
responses. The examples given in /Altindische Grammatik /1 ?61a 
(regrettably I don't have vol. 2.2 to hand) are similar to those cited 
by Madhav from Pata?jali. Common to all is that they seem to be derived 
directly from verb roots, unlike those in ?62b (such as nava-nava), 
which lack the lengthened ? (except where this is caused by sandhi, as 
in alp?lpa). Am I right in concluding from this that the reduplicated 
forms with lengthened ? are all verbal nouns, and that no corresponding 
formations are made from other adjectives?
My reason for asking is that I have come across a passage (in an 
astrological text as usual) which contrasts /kr?r?kr?ra /planets 
(causing death) with /samuy?saumya /planets (causing victory) and 
/mi?ra/ planets (giving mediocre results). Interpreting the first two 
words as 'evil and not evil' and 'good and not good', respectively, 
clearly makes no sense, as both would seem to be more or less synonymous 
with /mi?ra/. So I am looking for alternative interpretations, though so 
far without much success.
Thanks again,
Martin
