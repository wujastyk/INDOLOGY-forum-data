[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
Dear Philipp and Krishnapad,
Whitney remarks on page 9 of his Sanskrit Grammar:
16.a. A sign called the avagraha (separator) ? namely ? is occasionally used in the manuscripts, sometimes in the manner of a hyphen, sometimes as a mark of hiatus, sometimes to mark the elision of initial ? a after final ? e or ? o (135). In printed texts, especially European, it is ordinarily applied to the use last mentioned, and to that alone:thus ?????????? te?bruvan ?????????? so?brav?t for ?? ????????  te abruvan ?? ???????? so abrav?t.
So even Whitney acknowledges that the manuscripts do not use avagraha? regularly. Incidentally, the avagraha? in the copper plate inscription is an instance, in Whitney?s terminology, of a hyphen. The text reads: v??numodeta.
My own somewhat limited experience in reading manuscripts is that avagraha? rarely appears. I have seen it in devan?gar? and proto-mathil? or proto-b??gla manuscripts. I wonder if there are any studies about the use of avagraha? in manuscripts other than padap??ha? manuscripts. I have a sense that sometimes avagraha? is introduced into a manuscript copying tradition as a reader?s aid to interpretation.s
