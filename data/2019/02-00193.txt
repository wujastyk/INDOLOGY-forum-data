=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Announcement_from_John_and_Mary_Brockington:_our_R=C4=81m=C4=81ya=E1=B9=87a_material_on_the_Oxford_Research_Archive?=
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the third update of our material on the Oxford Research Archive, first deposited in January 2016; this update is identified as February 2019. We do so in order that it can be available for others to consult even in its present, unfinished state.  It can be accessed at the same location <http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8df9647a-8002-45ff-b37e-7effb669768b> or you can find it via the Bodleian Libraries website, under ORA, by looking for either our surname or its title, "Development and spread of the R?ma narrative (pre-modern)".
There are additions, revisions and corrections to the material throughout.  However, areas which have seen the greatest degree of updating or enlargement are:
o   re-organisation of folders: placing the contents of the former Background material folder in a new Ancillary material folder, transferring to that most of the old Drafts (unpublished) folder and so making ?The development of the R?m?ya?a tradition? an independent item, as well as subdividing the Further Notes and former Miscellaneous drafts documents for greater ease of use.  The Guidance notes have been updated to reflect these changes.
o   additions to the data within 10. visual (India) in the bibliographic inventories,
o   inclusion of further unpublished conference papers in the Lectures and papers (unpublished) document,
o   all categories of the ?Narrative Elements?, particularly vernacular (South India).
Because of the nature of our own contacts this message is being sent primarily to other Indologists but, if any of you are aware of colleagues in other fields (for example Southeast Asian languages or visual culture) who might be interested, do please pass the information on to them ? and similarly, if any of you have access to suitable academic lists on which it could be posted, we would be grateful if you would send it to them.
As usual, we should be grateful for any comments from anyone who has used the material.
With all good wishes
John and Mary
