[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
The copper plate inscription (single) avagraha? shows that even in the 9th century CE it could mark assimilation of at least ? + a. We cannot infer from this example, however, that double avagraha? marking assimilation is an ancient usage. The only uses of double avagraha? I?ve seen are in colonial period and later printed texts and in manuscripts copied from printed texts. These sources are not ?quite old?.
