[INDOLOGY] Hobson Jobson Dictionary
Dear Gaia,
This is the edition that I have which is low in price and, as far as I can
see, not abridged:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hobson-Jobson-Definitive-Glossary-British-Classics/dp/0198718004/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hobson+jobson&qid=1571232616&s=books&sr=1-1
I very much like it.
All the best,
     Antonia
