Subject: [INDOLOGY] Transmission of sanskrit grammatical concepts/terminology to Europe
Message-ID: <CAHfOVECsAETjT9U5=gyX=VsbzuvxKvgRtUOKkCVGxY-oOH+qMA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I'm looking for articles and/or books dealing with the transmission of
sanskrit/paninian concepts/terminology to Europe. Terms such as root, afix
and the like I have been hearing for long were calques from sanskrit
grammar terms (dhaatu, pratyaya...), but never went as far as to dig the
exact sources that brought them in. Now a student of morphology here in S?o
Paulo asks for my help to find them.
I'd appreciate your help.
Thanks
Adriano
