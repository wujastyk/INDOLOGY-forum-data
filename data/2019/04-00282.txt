=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Fwd:_Ud=C4=81navarga_verses_from_the_Tibetan?=
Dear Valerie and Christophe,
there is also (as noted by Bernhard) a Pali parallel for the first
verse only at Ja vi 26:
   yath? pi tante vitate
   ya? yad ev?pav?yati
   appaka? hoti vetabba?
   eva? macc?na j?vita?
and, more interestingly, a G?ndh?r? parallel in the Khotan
Dharmapada
   https://gandhari.org/a_manuscript.php?catid=CKM0077
where verses 149?150 in contrast to the other versions form one
single sentence:
   yadha vi tadri vikadi
   ya yed eva odu opadi
   apaka bhodi votavi
   ohara?aseva sadii
   emam eva ma?u?a?a
   (*ye) y[a?e] sadi pra?ayo
   ya ya i vivasadi radi
   mara?aseva sadii
Brough (p. 222) translates this as follows:
   As on the stretched out warp, the more that the weft is woven,
   the less there remains to weave, as the end of the weaving
   comes nearer,?so also for men, and all other living creatures,
   each night that passes brings them nearer to death.
and further notes:
   Rockhill?s translation of thags as ?spider? instead of ?warp?
   led to a misunderstanding of the verse as a whole, and a wrong
   comparison with Dhp. 347.
All best,
Stefan
