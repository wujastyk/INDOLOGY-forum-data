[INDOLOGY] Bookworm quotation
Dear Taylor,
to add another note:
rats are beeing considered as very intelligent animals, and at least 
this seems to be true for the rats of my home town, Stuttgart,
where it was discovered one year ago, that they have entered the 
University library and have spoiled -by shitting on them -
about 8000 books of social and economic sciences from the sixties to the 
eigthties of the last century.
