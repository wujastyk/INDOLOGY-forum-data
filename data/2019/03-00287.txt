[INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
The examples you cite, Arlo, are all academic journals associated with 
learned and professional societies. For some of their income at least, 
they rely on subscription models (especially library subscriptions, some 
also including annual membership fees by individuals). These models work 
with a "moving wall" of 12-24 months, which many consider necessary to 
maintain a motivation for subscriptions and hence bring in the funds 
required to produce journals.
In the EU, the initiative "Plan S", supported by various governments and 
research funding bodies (including ERC!), pushes for instant open access 
publication without a moving wall. There is a grace period until 2023, 
but the goal is definitely universal instant open access. This certainly 
exerts pressures on learned societies to find alternative funding 
models; I wouldn't be surprised if author processing fees start being 
introduced more widely.
With best regards,
