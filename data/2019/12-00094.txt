Dear colleagues,

Are there Sanskrit texts that quote or refer to the Sarvadar?anasa?graha? The text was known to Wilson in 1828 and a printed edition appeared for the first time in 1858. Are there authors during the preceding centuries who show an awareness of the text (apart from copyists who copied it)? Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Johannes Bronkhorst
