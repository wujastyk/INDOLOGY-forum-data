Maybe replace in the governing committee

Adheesh Sathaye, University of British Columbia (on leave from 2018/11)
by a female colleague so 6:2 = 3 of each gender, and if possible somebody from India (underrepresented in the committee). I take the opportunity for correcting a previous post in a related matter:

The personal stories narrated by these women inform us the current trend of Sanskrit studies in India. Statistics suggests that more than 60% female students are studying and same no of women are enjoying faculty position in some states like Maharashtra, Kerala, and WestBengal.

I suggest, again, the following concrete steps ought to be taken by the INDOLOGY governing committee.
(1) Gender Parity. Numerous people have supported a call for gender parity on the INDOLOGY governing committee (currently a 2:1 male:female ratio). Let's move forward with that, now, and add 2 women.

The current committee consists of five active members, Audrey, Wendy, Philipp, Stefan and myself, as listed on the indology.info website<http://indology.info/email/email-comm/>.
