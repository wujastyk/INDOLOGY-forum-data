Dear list members,

I'm writing in the hope that someone might have a copy of the following
paper (or volume) they'd be willing to share:

Bandana Chatterji "The Story of P?thu as utilised by the early Sanskrit
poets" in *Our Heritage *vol 23, 1 (1975): 11-27.

I'd be very grateful!

Many thanks,

Robert
