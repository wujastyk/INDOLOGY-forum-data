The three gu?as are, at once, psychological, physical, emotional, etc., a tripartitie analogue to the Chinese yin-yang, which permeates the dynamics of everything, from food to medicine to emotional states and everything in between. They are not more material than mental. Their first ?evolute,? buddhi = ?intellect?, awareness, knowledge - which the G?t? also calls Mahat, ?Great One? - is cognitive, not material. The next tattva, aha?k?ra, the ?I-maker?, is psychological, emotional, rationalizing, and poorly understood if considered ?matter.? The next tattva, manas, mind, is not treated as ?material? in other Indian systems, and here indicates an empirically oriented mental function that ?organ-izes? the senses, the cognitive outreach that engenders awareness of the world, of the sensorium. So the buddhi-indriyas open the buddhi-aha?k?ra-manas continuum like a prism, into the five sensory capacities, the buddhi-indriyas, which are still cognitive rather than material. Only with the next set of tattvas, the sense-organs (ear, physical body [r?pa], eye, tongue, nose) have the tattvas concretized materially. From there comes awareness of sense-fields (sound, tactility, visibles, etc.), considered tanm?tras, elementary factors of sense experience, and finally the material components that comprise them, the mah?bh?tas (?k??a [corresponding to sound<-ear<-hearing], wind, fire, water, and earth).

One might compare some of this to the arguments found in Ny?ya, etc. for the layers of cognitive capacities, such that a self, over and above mind, etc., is considered ultimately responsible for ?knowing.?

Stepping back from the ?history? of the model, it should be evident that this is a phenomenological account of how one progresses from potential cognate abilities to encountering the world. Note, for instance, the five mah?bh?tas appear in reverse order from more standard treatments (more commonly earth, water, fire, wind, and when a fifth is included, ?k??a; some Indian systems eventually add consciousness as a sixth).

So just as in Buddhist accounts of prat?tya-samutp?da there is a contrast between the pratiloma vs anuloma order ? the former being the order of discovering, starting with death, #12, and working down to #1, ignorance, while the latter is the standard order for enumerating the 12 nid?nas, from #1 ignorance up to #12, death ? implying that thinking through things in reverse causal sequence is illuminating (according to Pali suttas Buddha discovers the links by asking ?why is there death??, and concluding ?because there is birth, there is death,? he then asks, ?why is there birth??, interrogating each new link until ferreting out the full 12), the same applies to the 25 tattvas. The three gu?as are hardly self-evident without conceptual analysis and multilevel observations, but taking account of what we sense, and we process our sensations is ever present and open for contemplating. Start with earth = solidity, and work our way up to buddhi, the cognitive capacity to understand, to know, which reveals the gu?as and puru?a in an understandable manner.

Understood this way, the 25 tattva model makes eminent sense in the order in which it is presented, and it is the spirit/matter superimposition which becomes counterintuitive. I hinted at this way of construing the model in an entry on S??khya for the Routledge Encyclopedia of International Philosophy (republished in Routledge?s Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy) a draft version of which is online at http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/schools/samkhya.html .

So what is your theory?

best,
Dan

Dear Indological colleagues,

One of the peculiarities of S??khya thought is its unusual theory of "evolution" (though it might better be termed "emanation") which proceeds from the subtle modifications of the m?laprak?ti to those that are increasingly coarse, namely the organs of sense and of action, and finally to their physical objects. This seems a very odd evolutionary path when we first encounter it and I am wondering if there has been any work that seeks to explain just why S??khya adopted what to us may seem a remarkably counter-intuitive framework. I do have my own theory about this, but I would not want to publish it if someone else has already come up with a similar idea. I would therefore be grateful for any suggestions you may have concerning scholarship that seeks to explain just why it is that S??khyaproceeds from top to bottom, as it were, rather than the other way around.

with thanks in advance for your advice about this,
Matthew
