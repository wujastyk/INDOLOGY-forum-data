[INDOLOGY] Out-of-body experience in Indian religions
It might be useful in this context to distinguish between out-of-body 
experiences (OBEs) as such and the (purported) phenomenon of entering 
someone else's body (parak?yaprave?a), which is what some of the 
references given so far discuss. Granted, the latter may presuppose the 
former, but they are not the same.
Parak?yaprave?a is of course a major topic of David White's /Sinister 
Yogis/, which would be accessible to a non-specialist (though I would 
recommend reading it together with James Mallinson's critical review).
