[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Indology Committee,
It seems that the Indology committee needs a grievance policy whereby a committee member might make a complaint to a mediator, who is not a committee member, is given access to the relevant evidence, has training in mediation and can bring the committee members together to find a resolution. Is such a grievance policy in place?
The general issue of gender parity on the committee might be discussed profitably by list members, but I can?t see how list members can mediate (via a group discussion on the forum) particular accusations of sexism by committee members. 
Best wishes,
Jason
