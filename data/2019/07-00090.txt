[INDOLOGY] Download link for my Vancouver WSC paper
Dear Colleagues,
Here is the download link for my paper ["Scope of Early Sanskrit Usage : A
Wider Approach"] for the Vancouver WSC.  Due to health reasons, I was
unable to personally attend the conference, but I did submit my paper and
here it is.
With best regards,
