=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Sanskrit_R=C4=81m=C4=81ya=E1=B9=87a_in_Word_Format?=
Dear Colleagues,
Does anyone have access to the CE of the R?m?ya?a as a single WORD document or PDF, or at least by its k???as in one of these formats?
The versions I am finding online tend to be by sarga, and I would like to search for some specific phrases across large portions of the text.
Best Wishes,
