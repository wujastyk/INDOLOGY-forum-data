Dear all,

I've fallen into a bit of a rabbit hole looking into the 
dharmas?tra/dharma??stra attributed to H?r?ta. Julius Jolly, in 1896, 
writes about a 17th-century manuscript of this text, complete in 30 
chapters:

https://books.google.ca/books?id=RhsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false

But it does not seem to have ever been published. However, I found this 
1994 book that seems to make reference to specific passages from the 
30th chapter of the H?r?ta Dharmas?tra:

https://books.google.ca/books?id=idERT6Tg4MMC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39#v=onepage&q&f=false

This definitely seems to be referring to the abovementioned 30-chapter 
text, rather than to shorter works attributed to H?r?ta (such as the 
H?r?tasa?hit?, Laghuh?r?tasm?ti, V?ddhah?r?tasm?ti, etc.) Does anyone 
know if any work has been done on the H?r?ta Dharmas?tra in the past 
hundred years or so? Jolly published a collection of quotations from it 
in 1890 (/Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der 
K?niglich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften/ 18), but I have been 
unable to access it.

Thanks,

Charles
