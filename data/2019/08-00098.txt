 What is dhaman = law here?https://www.etymonline.com/word/doom  doom (n.)

Middle English doome, from Old English dom "a law, statute, decree;
administration of justice, judgment; justice, equity, righteousness," from
Proto-Germanic *domaz (source also of Old Saxon and Old Frisian dom, Old
Norse domr, Old High German tuom "judgment, decree,"
Gothic doms"discernment, distinction"), perhaps from PIE root *dhe-
<https://www.etymonline.com/word/*dhe-?ref=etymonline_crossreference> "to
set, place, put, do" (*source also of Sanskrit dhaman- "law," *Greek
themis "law,"
Lithuanian dom? "attention").

Originally in a neutral sense but sometimes also "a decision determining
fate or fortune, irrevocable destiny." A book of laws in Old English was
a dombec. Modern adverse sense of "fate, ruin, destruction" begins early
14c. and is general after c. 1600, from doomsday
<https://www.etymonline.com/word/doomsday?ref=etymonline_crossreference> and
the finality of the Christian Judgment. Crack of doom is the last trump,
the signal for the dissolution of all things.

doom (v.)

late 14c., domen, "to judge, pass judgment on," from doom
<https://www.etymonline.com/word/doom?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_13942>
(n.).
The Old English word was deman, which became deem
<https://www.etymonline.com/word/deem?ref=etymonline_crossreference>.
Meaning "condemn (to punishment), pronounce adverse judgment upon" is from
c. 1600. Related: Doomed; dooming.
