[INDOLOGY] news of interest to the Indological community
This has been all over Facebook today (and probably Twitter, though I don't
tweet).  It is deeply regrettable.  In the Scroll.in report that you cite,
Matthew, Romila's own comment is characteristically understated and
non-inflammatory:
?It is a very unfortunate thing,? Thapar told Anandabazar. ?We are going
through a strange time.
Emeritus is not a mere designation. It is an honour related to the
university?s goodwill.?
Thank you for sharing.
Best,
Dominik
