Dear list members,
Does anybody know if Bishnupada Bhattacharya's edition and English
translation of Dhvanyaaloka uddyota *4* (Firma KL Mukhopadhyay) has ever
been published? Online I found library records of his edition of uddyotas 1
to 3 only.
I attach the title pages from the volume of uddyota 2 for easy reference.
All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
