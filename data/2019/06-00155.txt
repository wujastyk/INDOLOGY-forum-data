Subject: [INDOLOGY] ISO15919 and case insensitivity

Dear Daniel,

I also would like to direct another, different question in case there 
are any modifications at the Standard ISO15919 possible:

The Halfnasal ? (for transliteration of ?g, ?? and ?d is available in 
all unicode-fonts, but the Halfnasal for m (for transliteration of mb 
[where m should have the same diacritic on top as ?] is missing.

For the transliteration at least of Sinhala-text we need this letter as 
part of the Unicode-fonts.

To where or whom we can direct this?


Thank you


Heiner
