[INDOLOGY] ISO15919 and case insensitivity
Dear Daniel,
I also would like to direct another, different question in case there 
are any modifications at the Standard ISO15919 possible:
The Halfnasal ? (for transliteration of ?g, ?? and ?d is available in 
all unicode-fonts, but the Halfnasal for m (for transliteration of mb 
[where m should have the same diacritic on top as ?] is missing.
For the transliteration at least of Sinhala-text we need this letter as 
part of the Unicode-fonts.
To where or whom we can direct this?
Thank you
Heiner
