[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 81, Issue 19
Dear Matthew,
There is a chapter in the recent *Handbook of Comparative and Historical
Indo-European Linguistics* vol 1, p447-470 (
https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/20756)
by Thomas Oberlies called "The Evolution of Indic" which might be useful to
you (at the very least the bibliography will be quite up to date since this
volume came out in 2017).
Best,
Caley
