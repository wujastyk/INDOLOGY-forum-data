Dear colleagues

I came across a reference by Frits Staal to:
Chatterji, Kshitish Chandra (ed. and transl.) (1957), Paspasa to Patanjali's Mahabhasya, Calcutta: A. Mukherjee & Co.

Might someone have a scan of this book they could upload to archive.org, or a pdf they could send?

Several of KC Chatterji?s other works are already on archive.org, but I did not find the book Staal referred to 

Cheers
James Hartzell
