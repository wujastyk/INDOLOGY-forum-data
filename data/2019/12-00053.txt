[INDOLOGY] Problem with indology list
The problem as I understand it (and I went through this a couple years back) is not with the list itself, but with the various spam filters that different institutions use and how the rules from those filters are applied (and they vary quite a bit due to different companies being contracted to handle this and the different software used).  I doubt Dominik or others could actually solve this problem on their end.  The easiest solution (and the one I went with that has worked pretty flawlessly since) is to contact the institution's IT folks and  have the domain 'white listed' (i.e., they add an exception that permits any and all mails from that server be accepted by default rather than shunted to a SPAM folder).

Re: [INDOLOGY] Problem with indology list
This seems to be a not uncommon problem. I know nothing of such matters, but is there some way that outgoing messages from the listserv could be modified to make them more receivable, rather than having all of the seemingly many individuals who aren?t receiving everything tweak their personal email accounts?

I've had a few messages go to Spam as well. Usually Dominik Wujastyk's (and a few others), which is odd since his other emails never hit the spam folder.

Problem solved I think.  For some reason as of two days ago some messages  to the list were going to the "spam" folder.  I;ve changed a spam setting so hopefully the problem will go away.

Dear list members,
It looks like some messages sent to the Indology list don't come through to me.  For example: there are two messages from Manu Francis that are archived from early this morning but I didn't receive them.  Does anyone else have this problem?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
