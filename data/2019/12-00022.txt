[INDOLOGY] R. Ananthkrishna Sastri!
Dear List,
Could anybody furnish me some biographical details of R. Ananthakrishna Sastri (better is a scanned copy from any authentic book), who translated Lalitasahsranaama with Bhaaskararaaya's commentary in 1925?
Thanks a lot in advance
Regards
Debabrata Chakrabarti
