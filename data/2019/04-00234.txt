As a colleague of Luis Gomez at Michigan, I occasionally participated in
his translation projects.  What I remember of his practice of multiple
translations is that there was to be a translation for scholars that was
technical, very close to the text and annotated.  This assumed that the
reader also understood Sanskrit and was able to understand technical
aspects of the text, vocabulary, grammar, variants etc.  The other kind of
translation was intended for a wider general readership that had no access
to the original Sanskrit text and did not have specific expertise in
Buddhism.  What could a common reader get out of a Sanskrit text?  Not
everything, but indeed something of understandable content, something that
would be readable to an English reader with no background of Sanskrit or
Buddhism.
