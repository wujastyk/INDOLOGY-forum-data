I.e. dev? and  lolajihv?nuk?ri?? but these are mixed with a correct form
vocative sarvvasatruk?aya?kari .
In other texts I've seen the vocative for  the goddess mah??akti  written
as mah??akti not as  mah??akte. also mixed in with correct forms of
vocatives.
Does this mean that in the tantric literature, non-standard vocatives are
common for goddesses whose names end in long or short i ?
Are these irregularities what are known as the irregularities of  ai?a
sanskrit or is that term only for irregularities of the earliest tantras?
Thanks,
