[INDOLOGY] Information requested
I am wondering if there are any publications that provide a record of Indic
vocabulary in Persian, Aramaic, Bactrian and Greek records that give us a
linguistic snapshot of the period around P??ini.  He is believed to be
contemporary with the pre-Mauryan Nanda dynasty and so belonging to a
period prior to the invasions by Alexander.  Any information would be
greatly appreciated.  With best regards,
