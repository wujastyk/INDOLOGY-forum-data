=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Mah=C4=81bh=C4=81rata_concordance=3F?=
Dear all,
Many thanks for the off-list (and inadvertently on-list:-)) expressions of
support!
To make use of the list in the way it was intended to: would anyone have or
know whether there is a verse concordance of the Critical Edition of the
Mah?bh?rata (as found e.g. on GRETIL) and the version underlying the
Ganguli translation (as found on most other online sites, such as
sacred-texts.com)? The text of the two greatly overlaps, but the split-up
into sections varies, and I am trying to find a straightforward way of
locating verses from one edition in the other.
Thank you in advance for your help,
      Antonia
