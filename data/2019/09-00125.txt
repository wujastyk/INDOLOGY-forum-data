[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
Dear Martin,
The Pramanavarttika?the most influential Buddhist philosophical work, some even say, the most influential South Asian philosophical work.
The Tattvopaplavesimha?the only Sanskrit philosophical work that is entirely independent of any religious tradition.
Best wishes,
Eli
