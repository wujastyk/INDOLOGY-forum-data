Dear all
I was doing a small research wchich is the correct method to write the
vowel ? preceeded by ?? consonant. I  have checked in the old manuscripts
where I could only see ?????? and never ???????. The later is widely used
in modern days and in all the fonts. But I don't understand how can we have
conjunct to a vowel. After consulting n number of MSS, consequently, I
strongly believe the former is correct. However if any scholar would
recomend any other options I would be grateful to know.  Thanks
And here is the difference I have made in Rgveda
