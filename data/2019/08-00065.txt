clicky type--
made, just checked on the back, in June 1990. The keyboard connects
directly
to the laptop through some sort of hardware USB emulator. Still, given
all this,
the Windows version of Keyman runs just fine, no issues at all. Would
the
ordinary Mac version of Keyman install on your iPad? Would that work
