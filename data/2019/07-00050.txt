[INDOLOGY] The committee, not me
 Sorry, I just hit the reply all button. I will be more discriminating next time (I hope).
Just in time. Congratulations. :-)
And thanks.

 Dear everyone, 
When querying matters relating to the management of the INDOLOGY forum please, please write to the committee, 
   - indology-owner <indology-owner at list.indology.info>? (also given on the main INDOLOGY.info website)
not to me or the other committee members individually.? We take turns being on duty, and this is not my week; I finished on Sunday.
Best,Dominik Wujastyk
