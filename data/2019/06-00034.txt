Professor ,Thank you for your elaboration on the issue in question.However,your last line evokes interest in me.It is mentioned in the introduction toSDS,that Madhavacharya,acted as Prime Minister to the Founder monarchs of the Vijaynagar empire namely Harihar or Bukka,and later came to be known as VidyaRanya Muni in his later ages,when he endorsed Sankara's views and became the Prefect(Adhakshya) of the Sringeri Math laid down by Sankara.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Madhavacharya

A nuanced discussion of the problem of the authorship of the SDS (which includes the evaluation of Thakur's arguments) is available in Jon Yamashita's thesis: A Translation and Study of the P??inidar?ana Chapter of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha (1998), pp. 22?32. It is partly inconclusive:

In conclusion, both internal and external evidence suggests that the author of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha was not M?dhav?c?rya, the elder brother of S?ya?a. Rather, the author must have been at least a generation later than M?dhav?c?rya. Two possible candidates which have been proposed are [1] the son of S?ya?a ?&nbsp;whose name M?ya?a is to be considered a corruption or regional form of "M?dhava", and [2] Cannibha??a, the naiy?yika author of the Tarkabh???prak??ik? ?&nbsp;either independently or as part of a committee. There is no direct proof to support either choice; the available evidence, however, allows each to be given serious consideration as possible candidates for the authorship. At most, we can say with certainty that under either claim, the Sarvadar?anasa?graha would have been composed during the fourteenth century under the patronage of the Vijayanagara court. (p. 31)

Best,
Lubomir

&gt; In fact, the late Anantalal Thakur demonstrated that the SDS was NOT written by ?reg;??????????&nbsp;but by his protege, the logician Cannibha??a.
&gt; 
&gt; He provides his evidence, which is entirely convincing, here:
&gt; Anantalal Thakur, ?Cannibha??a and the authorship of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha,? Bulletin of the Adyar Library 25
&gt; (1961): 524?538.
&gt; 
&gt; It is odd that few seem to have taken note of Thakur's impressive detective work and that most still attribute the SDS to ?reg;????.
