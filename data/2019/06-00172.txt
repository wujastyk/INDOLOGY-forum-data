Dear Krishnaprasad,
Having observed precisely the same phenomenon in all manuscripts (written in Oriya script) we collated for our edition of ?r?dhara's Vih?h?dikarmapa?jik?, Dr. Shilpa Sumant and myself decided to edit with the spelling ??????. See for example line 9 on the attached extract from p. 33 of our book published last year. At least in Orissa, where our text was composed, the explanation must be connected with the fact that the word would be pronounced nirruti, in other words (the Oriya equivalent of) ?? is perceived as equivalent to ????. I would guess a similar explanation will apply in the sources you are looking at.
??? ???????

Dear all
I was doing a small research wchich is the correct method to write the vowel ? preceeded by ?? consonant. I  have checked in the old manuscripts where I could only see ?????? and never ???????. The later is widely used in modern days and in all the fonts. But I don't understand how can we have conjunct to a vowel. After consulting n number of MSS, consequently, I strongly believe the former is correct. However if any scholar would recomend any other options I would be grateful to know.  Thanks
And here is the difference I have made in Rgveda
