[INDOLOGY] [Archiving Open Access publications] Re: question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Dear Dominik &c.,
To clarify. The National Library of New Zealand, in the legal deposit
of an open access digital publication, does not assume the existence
of a Creative Commons licence. Such a licence -- rightly in my
opinion-- is considered optional:
National Library of New Zealand - Legal Deposit - Submitting
Publication
http://bit.ly/2FEJ7Wy
https://natlib.govt.nz/publishers-and-authors/legal-deposit/submitting-
your-publication
Form -- Publication for Legal Deposit
http://bit.ly/2JXXDxY
https://natlib.govt.nz/files/legaldeposit/Publication-for-legal-deposit
-form.pdf
I think that the decision to assign any licence --CC or not-- is best
left to the author.
Best, Richard

Dear Jonathan,
As far as I understand, you are right, Jonathan.  Sean Gaffney's book
(as a PDF, I've just downloaded) contains the (C) assertion that you
quote.  That the author retains the copyright is good and proper.  All
authors should hold on to their copyright in all circumstances.   That
stuff about "moral right" etc. doesn't say anything about whether the
book is OA or not.  All OA books have a copyright-holder too.
But to make a book Open Access, the copyright-holder needs to issue a
formal license statement that says, more or less, "As copyright holder,
I give everyone permission to copy this publication."  Sean Gaffney's
book does not include such a statement on the (C) page (in fact the
opposite, stringent restrictions), and this means that on the evidence
of the (C) page, it is not OA.  People downloading it will rightly be
in doubt about whether they are breaching the author's rights.  None of
the PDF or online metadata that I see accompanying the book says that
the author has issued an OA license.
The copyright-holder's license statement doesn't need to give away
*all* rights.  Various degrees of OA license are listed at
creativecommons.org, an organization that has given a lot of thought to
all this stuff.
To sum up: the author is the first copyright-holder and therefore
retains the right to control copying of their work.  The author, qua
copyright-holder, is the only person who may issue a license giving
people freedoms to do other things, like freely copying. Thus an OA
publication should make two things clear.  1. There is a copyright-
holder, 2. That person has issued an appropriate OA license.
Best,
Dominik
