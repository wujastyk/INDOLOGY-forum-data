Would anyone have a pdf of
 Subodhchandra Mukerjee. 1926. N??ya??stra of Bharata. [Chapt. 6:
Ras?dhy?ya, On the Sentiments.] With the  comm. Abhinavabh?rat? of
Abhinavagupta. Ed. with an English translation of Ras?dhy?ya.

Google books has this but its just in snippet view. and I couldn't find it
on archive.org.

Thanks,
