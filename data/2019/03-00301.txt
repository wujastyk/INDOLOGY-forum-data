[INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
The consequences of publishers' decisions to shift costs onto academics 
and their institutions can be seen in their financial results. See e.g., 
the results for the academic publishing division of Informa (owners of 
Taylor and Francis, among others): 
https://informa.com/investors/financial-summary/
For 2017, these show an adjusted operating profit of ?208million on 
revenue of ?530m, or an operating margin (i.e., profit) of an 
astonishing 39.2%. Not every academic publisher is this profitable, but 
then not every academic publisher charges the fees that Routledge and 
others in the Informa group do.
