Dear all,
Despite the title page, the original scan consists of an English translation of verses, starting with vij?apti-m?trat? and a reference to Kuiji?s parsing of the terms vij?aptim?trat? as locative and the ?purified? as dative. Iyengar?s published version of the portion of the Pram??asamuccaya contains Tibetan and reconstructed Sanskrit, no English, and the PS dedicatory verse discusses pram??abh?ta, not vij?aptim?trat?. The content of the English verses in the scan addresses Krishna, so not likely that page comes from a Buddhist text at all, so it seems these are three different pages from entirely different manuscripts.
best wishes,
Dan
