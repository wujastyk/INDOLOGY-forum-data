[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear friends,
As the Tibetan translator, Rin-chen-bzang-po, certainly died in 1055 -- his correct dates are 958-1055 (I may have mistyped this in an earlier message) -- I doubt that Candranandana's work could have been composed later than 1020. And the dates of Rin-chen-bzang-po seem to be quite certain - in any case, if adjustments are called for, it would be a matter of a few years, not decades.
So I am afraid that this rules out the interesting suggestion of Zakuna.
In any case, here is the complete passage in question (vol. 114, pp. 737-8 in the dpe bsdur ma ed.):
bdag gi mes por gyur pa ni// dpal chen dga' ba zhes grags yin// deng sang na yang mkhas pa rnams// grags pa'i dri med sgrogs par byed// de yi bur gyur chags la dga'// de bu zla ba la dga' (b)dag// slob dpon blo gros chen po ni// rgyun shes don ldan ming btags pa// don dam zhes bya sman pa'i mchog// kha che'i yul du skyes pa yin// rgyal po dpal ldan tha ga na// dpa' ba la sogs yon tan ldan// sa steng dgra las rgyal ba yi// sa bdag kun tu rgyal gyur cig//
He who was my ancestor
Was well known as MahAzrI-nandana.
Even today the pandits
Proclaim his taintless fame.
His son was Ratinandana,
Whose son Candranandana I am,
Whose teacher of great intelligence,
Knowing the tradition, was meaningfully named
ParamArtha, supreme among physicians.
I was born in the land of Kashmir.
May the king, ZrImat Tha-ga-na,
Who has qualities such as courage,
Be victorious over all the earth's rulers,
Who have conquered their enemies upon the earth.
Perhaps this will give you some ideas.
best,
Matthew

Re: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Unless his date is definitely too late (r. 1089-1101), one could take the Kashmirian King Har?adeva into consideration, notorious for his obsession with omina (the word "?akuna" occuring three times in these contexts), cp. Kalha?a's RT 7.743; 769; 796; 1644; 1672).
A nickname formed from ?akuna and deva (last member of his name ?r?har?a-deva) may therefore not be impossible, were it not for the post 1000-date ("he must have lived [...] before ca. 1000").

btw, Tha ga na is not actually a Tibetan name. It figures among the names of the mahsiddhas, where it is a Tibetan transcription of an MIA form of Sthagana, the Liar. What on earth it's doing as a Kashmiri king's name beats me.

Thanks Matthew.  I will keep the name of king Tha ga na in reference in case I come across anything that would help explain what his Kashmiri name was.
Cheers

All we can say is that he must have lived after VAgbhaTa and before ca. 1000.
His concluding verses do mention a king, but I cannot correlate the name as given in Tibetan - Tha ga na - with anyone in the lists of Kashmiri kings with which I am familiar.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Do we have any idea of when Candranandana himself may have lived?

Just to follow up on Andrey's comments:
In the concluding verses in the Rin chen bzang po translation Candranandana states that he was born in Kashmir (kha che'i yul du skyes pa yin). The translator does not tell us where he studied or translated the text, but because Rin chen bzang po did work extensively in Kashmir, we may assume he did so there.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear Dr Hartzell,
The introductory verses to Candrananda?s commentary on the A????gah?dayasa?hit? call the text Pad?rthacandrik? (not Am?tah?daya A????ga Guhyopade?atantra ?!). See ?[?] pad?rthacandrik?? ??k?? [?] kari?y?mi ? ?
As far as I am aware, the assumed date of the Tibetan translation provides, indeed, the earliest terminus ante quem, but, as to now, one could not find any evidence to determine the terminus post quem ? that is, the TPQ is given merely by the composition of the root text.
I heard from several scholars in India that they thought Candrananda hailed from Kashmir. I am not sure about the rationale behind this belief, but I guess that it is influenced by the Tibetan tradition. As for Sanskrit sources, someone Candrananda (the Pad?rthacandrik? has not been published in its entirety yet, so we still don?t know if it?s the same Candra or not) is often quoted by K??rasv?min (fl. ca. 11th cent.) in his commentary on the Amarako?a, and one can also establish that Candra?s text exhibited significant influence on Indu (fl. ca. 12th cent.). Both authors were most likely from Kashmir, which may supply some very weak evidence for connecting Candra with this region.

Andrey

Dear Jim,
According to the catalogues of the Tibetan canon, the translation was done by Rin-chen-bzang-po (955-1054), and, because he also translated the root text, this seems likely to be correct.
Although Vairocana of Pa-gor seems to have been a real 8th c. individual, it is very difficult to disentangle whatever is factual from the enormous body of legend that grew up around him. Because the Tibetan medical tantra, the Rgyud-bzhi (Four Tantras), is an apocryphon that claims its authority with reference to the period of the 8th c. monarch Khri srong lde'u btsan, it is not surprising that the "historical" tradition that developed around it would have wanted to appropriate other authorities as well.

[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Hi
Does anyone have a definitive date for Candranandana, author of the commentary Am?tah?daya A????ga Guhyopade?atantra on V?gbha?a?s A????gah?daya (or A??h??gasa?hit?)?  According to the Tibetan medical history tradition, as reported in "The Origin of the rGyud bzhi: A Tibetan Medical Tantra? by Todd Fenner (https://www.thlib.org/encyclopedias/literary/genres/genres-book.php#!book=/studies-in-genres/b27/dn3/), Vairocana studied with him in Kashmir, and translated this text into Tibetan, and presented it to King Trisong Detsen (Tibetan: ????????????????), who ruled (according to Wikipedia) 755 CE until 797 or 804 CE.
Dr. Fenner?s history would place Candranandana in the late 8th century CE.  Has this account been further confirmed?
Cheers
James
