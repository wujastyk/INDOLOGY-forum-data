Subject: [INDOLOGY] first Sanskrit inscription ever published?

Dear Arlo,

according to Salomon (Indian Epigraphy, 1998, p. 200), ?the first publication of an old Indian inscription was by the "Sanskrit-mad" (Sir) Charles Wilkins? in 1781 (or 1785).

Hope this helps,

Marco

The title is misleading, and the decipherment utterly unreliable, but the transcription clearly reflects the Sanskrit-text of the 'Calcutta Stone' (https://iias.asia/the-newsletter/article/kolkata-calcutta-stone-bicentennial-british-interregnum-java-1811-1816 <https://iias.asia/the-newsletter/article/kolkata-calcutta-stone-bicentennial-british-interregnum-java-1811-1816>). It occurred to me recently that this publication might mark the beginning of Sanskrit epigraphy as a modern scholarly enterprise. But perhaps there is competition from publications by British officers who were posted in India proper rather than in 'Farther India'. Please enlighten me.
