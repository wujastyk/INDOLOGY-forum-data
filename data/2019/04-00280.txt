[INDOLOGY] Indo-Aryan speakers and Shaktism
Dear Indologists,
A few years ago, I came across an article intended to debate the close
connection of some "Indo-Aryan" speaking groups (I use commas because I
doubt that we could never speak of "pure" Indo-Aryan speakers when the
migration waves into the Subcontinent began) and Shakta traditions.
Unfortunately, I am not able to remember who wrote about this topic.
Anyway, the article focused on Indo-Aryan tribes settled in (Himalayan?)
mountains, tracing a close connection between these tribes and Shaktism.
Could anyone suggest any reference to this topic?
Sincerely,
Paolo
