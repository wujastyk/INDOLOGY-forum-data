Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indo-Aryan speakers and Shaktism
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf_Kz01dCi1m4d6QFAHKks57rsnnBxRFZoSpC7McRAvqFA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

A few years ago, I came across an article intended to debate the close
connection of some "Indo-Aryan" speaking groups (I use commas because I
doubt that we could never speak of "pure" Indo-Aryan speakers when the
migration waves into the Subcontinent began) and Shakta traditions.

Unfortunately, I am not able to remember who wrote about this topic.
Anyway, the article focused on Indo-Aryan tribes settled in (Himalayan?)
mountains, tracing a close connection between these tribes and Shaktism.

Could anyone suggest any reference to this topic?

Sincerely,
Paolo
