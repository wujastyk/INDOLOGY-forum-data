[INDOLOGY] Unfounded accusations of Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Professor Tieken,
I strongly disagree with you. First, sexual  harassment is a very common
behaviour in academia and we need to stop it and not to cover it.
Second, sexual harassment is a tragedy for who has been subjected to
unwanted attentions, and not for who has acted as an abuser.
Best regards,
Paolo
