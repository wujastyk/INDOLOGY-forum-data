[Both the posts below bounced; I'm guessing that the Simon and Dominik
didn't send their posts from the email addresses with which they're
registered at INDOLOGY.]

But to respond, Simon mistakes intellectual property rights with
copyright.

In my experience, it is often the case that authors and scholars (including
myself!) have false ideas about the nature of copyright.  It really is
worth going to a seminar or buying a book about it.

Copyright is a mechanical thing.  It is about *copying*.  About the right
to make a physical copy of an object that somebody else made earlier.  BORI
"made" the books, in the sense of physically producing the objects.  So it
has the right to control who copies those books.    BORI and Tokunaga (and
John) *made* the e-text.  So they, ... etc. etc.

This is somewhat reductionist, I realize, but it is the core of the issue
and it may help to have it stated baldly.

Best,
Dominik
