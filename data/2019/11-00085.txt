To whom it may concern:

As far as I know, Joydeep Bagchee is not a staff member of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t M?nchen and therfore not entitled to suggest such a connection.

Betreff: [INDOLOGY] Exploratory session for Mah?bh?rata seminar at AAR

Dear INDOLOGY List,

If you will be at the AAR meeting on Monday the 25th, please plan to join us at an exploratory session on "The Mah?bh?rata: A Text for Classical Hinduism.? We will seek to establish whether sufficient interest exists to justify the creation of a five-year seminar dedicated to the Mah?bh?rata. Rather than present papers, we will articulate the case for such a seminar, soliciting participation from fellow AAR members. Details below.


WHEN:

Monday - 9:00 AM-11:30 AM

WHERE:

Hilton Bayfront-Sapphire 402 (Fourth Level)

PRESIDING:

Bruce M. Sullivan, Northern Arizona University,

PANEL:

Vishwa Adluri, City University of New York
Arti Dhand, University of Toronto
Frederick M. Smith, University of Iowa
Michael C. Baltutis, University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh
Joydeep Bagchee, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t of Munich

RESPONDING:
