Thanks to Elliot Stern, Isabelle Rati?, and Dominik Wujastyk for confirming that rumors of a single V?caspatimi?ra were indeed  "fake news." I must admit that I was not quite aware of the Pandit Project and look forward to exploring it more fully.

Dear friends,


I seem to recall from my student days that V?caspati Mi?ra was often treated as two: V?caspati Mi?ra I and V?caspati Mi?ra II.


However, it now seems that this doubling has disappeared and he is mostly treated as a single figure.


Can you refer me to any work that explicitly discusses and resolves the issue?


with thanks in advance,

Matthew
