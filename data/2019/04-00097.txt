[INDOLOGY] question about kings poisoned by wives
Dear Jesse, 
Artha??stra 1.20.16 mentions among others the queen who ? killed the king of K??? by mixing fried grain with poison under the guise of honey. ?
Here is the passage of the A? followed by Kangle?s translation:
1.20.16 	l?j?n madhuneti vi?e?a paryasya dev? k???r?jam vi?adigdhena n?pure?a vairantyam mekhal?ma?in? sauv?ram j?l?tham ?dar?ena, ve?y?? g??ha? ?astra? k?tv? dev? vid?ratha? jagh?na. 
? The queen killed the king of K??? by mixing fried grain with poison under the guise of honey; (the queen killed) Vairantya with an anklet smeared with poison, the king of the Sauv?ras with a (poison-smeared) girdle jewel, J?l?tha with a (poison-smeared) mirror; the queen killed Vid?ratha by keeping a weapon concealed in the braid of her hair. ? (R.P. Kangle, 1972, vol. 2, p. 50).
You might also want to have a look at Kalha?a?s R?jatara?gi?? 7.685 and 8.1276-1278 where Vid?ratha is mentioned (vid?rath?div?tt?ntam (?) kelik?a?e bruvan (?)). Medh?tithi?s commentary on Manu 7.153 mentions anecdotes about kings who were assassinated by queens. I have written a few pages in my PhD dissertation on this topic and I would be happy to share them with you, even though my dissertation is in French.
