*Description*


Meditation practices are a core component of ancient Indian Buddhism and an
essential factor in the development of Buddhist philosophy as a whole.
Ancient Buddhist meditation is naturally intertwined with key philosophical
topics such as the nature of consciousness and qualia, the phenomenology of
subjective experience, the nature of emotions, the self, causality, free
will and the meaning of life. Today, scholars in cognitive psychology and
neurosciences are actively engaged in exploring meditation practices as a
promising field for raising new questions and develop new approaches about
the nature of the mind-body relationship. At the same time, historians of
Western philosophy and philosophers of religion begin to reappraise the
importance of meditative traditions in the West and their impact on the
shaping of philosophical debates of the past. This symposium focuses on
ancient Indian Buddhist meditation practices as an interdisciplinary topic
to bring together historical, philosophical and scientific research on the
historical and conceptual implications of Buddhist meditation and its
potential for comparative and global philosophy.
