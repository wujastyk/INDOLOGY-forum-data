[INDOLOGY] An article by Stanley Insler
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
Around 2000 (? a year or two) I received from Stanley Insler a preprint of an article analyzing the story of Nala and Damayant? in terms of rasa theory. I loaned my copy to two graduate students who had just joined UIUC and who have left since then, and somehow the copy got lost after that.
Does anyone have a copy that they could scan and send to me? I am trying to refer to the paper in a publication that is under preparation, as a way of remembering his scholarship.
Best wishes,
Hans Henrich Hock
