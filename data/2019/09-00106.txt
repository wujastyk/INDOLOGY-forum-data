[INDOLOGY] author search
Dear Friends,
I have recently got a pdf copy via LOC's microfiche catalogue of a book
from 1922 about mallakhamb.
The author is Lakshman?a Na?ra?yan?a Sapre
<https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ASapre%2C+Lakshman%CC%A3a+Na%CC%84ra%CC%84yan%CC%A3a.&qt=hot_author>.
I am wondering if anyone knows anything about this person. I don't seem to
be able to find even the slightest mention in my searches so far.
Thanks.
All the best,
????? ???????
