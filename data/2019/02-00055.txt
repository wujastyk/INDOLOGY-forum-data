[INDOLOGY] Continuing my Krishna verses
Thanks, Jan, for your analysis of the verse.  In my mind, since I am
talking about kr???acandra, the word karai? refers to his hands/rays.  That
is precisely the point of using the plural. I should include this double
meaning in my translation.  Though I am translating my own verses, I often
find it impossible to bring the full richness of the original Sanskrit into
my translation.  Thanks for locating one such instance.  With best wishes,
Madhav
