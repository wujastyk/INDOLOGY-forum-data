[INDOLOGY] Skt./Pkt. prose word order
Dear friends and colleagues,
I am still puzzled sometimes by the word order in prose dialogues of 
early Sanskrit and Prakrit stage plays and other prose compositions. And 
I am sure there are more studies on this than J.S. Speijer's Sanskrit 
Syntax. Can you please refer me to some of these?
