[INDOLOGY] 'catching the ocean in a cow's hoofprint'
Dear all,
In the BBC radio series 'Incarnations', the episode on P??ini is entitled
'Catching the Ocean in a Cow's Hoofprint', which it says is a description
of what P??ini's work achieved.
Can anyone tell me what the source of this expression specifically in
reference to P??ini is? Textual/online searches for go?pada- have not led
me very far - but maybe I've been looking for the wrong word?
(In case anyone doesn't know 'Incarnations' and wants to listen to any of
the episodes: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05rptbv/episodes/downloads)
Many thanks and all the best,
     Antonia
