Dear Andrew,

     Not this verse, but the general doctrine that ??vara's decisions are
dependent upon the karman of a person, and that karman is an?di is found in
the Bh??ya of ?a?kara on the Brahmas?tra (2.1.34): ???????????????? ?,
?????????????.  God cannot be accused of being uneven and cruel, because
his decisions are guided by the karman of a person.  Best wishes,

Madhav
