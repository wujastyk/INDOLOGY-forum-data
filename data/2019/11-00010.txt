Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit drama in La Belle ?poque
Dear colleagues,
Allow me to add to the discussion on the French adaptation of the Mr?cchakat?ika?.
I am appending a paper by Sylvain L?vi, dealing as a dramatic critic with the performance of the drama in Paris. I am also referring to the event in L. Bansat-Boudon & R. Lardinois, Sylvain L?vi (1863-1935). ?tudes indiennes, histoire sociale. Actes du colloque tenu ? Paris les 8-10 octobre 2003. Turnhout, Brepols (Bibl. de l??cole des hautes ?tudes, sciences religieuses, 130), 2007, p. 29.
Best,
Lyne Bansat-Boudon

Dear Matthew and Colleagues
Will it be OK for me to share the designs and information with a Facebook group on the art of illustration? I think they will be fascinated.
Thank you -

Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit drama in La Belle ?poque
Dear Herman,
Thanks a lot for this interesting reference. There is of course a tremendous amount of 19th-century European theatre, opera, poetry, painting with oriental themes - it's a very big topic and has been the object of much research. But it is not so much my area, though I am interested - I posted the Toulouse-Lautrec to the list just as an amusing curiosity and not in connection with any academic project that I am undertaking.
best regards,
Matthew

RE: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit drama in La Belle ?poque
Dear Matthew, Some years ago I attended a paper delivered by Emilio Ghezzi, the partner of our colleague Daniela Rossella (University of Potenza) on the designs of the stage and costumes of 19th-century operas with oriental themes. Emilio is a composer himself. I do have a tape with music composed by him somewhere but do not have the necessary equipment anymore. It was a fascinating paper with many slides of original drawings from the 19th century. I do not know if the paper has already been published, but hope it will.
The most recent email address of Emilio (and Daniela) I have is ghezziem at tin.it<mailto:ghezziem at tin.it>.

Dear Alakendu,
There are several English translations. The best known is perhaps the "Little Clay Cart" of the American Sanskritist Arthur Ryder, first published in 1905.
cordially,
Matthew

Dr.Kapstein,
I rue that I saw this post so late.It<https://f6mobile.rediff.com/cgi-bin/prored.cgi?red=http://late.It&isImage=0&BlockImage=0&rediffng=0&rdf=VW0Jalc5Vz4BMQAxU2EHP1ZkXzAPMQRvU29eJgc1AGleeA%3D%3D&rogue=69661426a5944b68cca2fb4194cac1377a0a9342>'s indeed awe-inspiring.! I feel there exists an English version of MrchhaKatikam, namely The Clay Cart.I shall confirm it.

[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit drama in La Belle ?poque
Dear Indologists,
You may find this to be amusing.
Visiting the huge exhibition of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec currently on view at the Grand Palais in Paris, I was surprised to find, amidst his many posters for theater and cabaret, the one I include here, for a production of the
M?cchaka?ik?, - the title is even given in devanagari at lower right. If you read carefully, you'll see that TL himself is credited with the sets for the fifth act, though I do not know if any trace of these survives, or if it was photographed. They must have been wonderful!
