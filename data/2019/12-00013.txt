America now is home to approximately five million Hindus and Jains. Their
contribution to the economic and intellectual growth of the country is
unquestionable. *Dharma in America *aims to explore the role of Hindu and
Jain Americans in diverse fields such as:

   - education and civic engagements
   - medicine and healthcare
   - music.

Providing a concise history of Hindus and Jains in the Americas over the
last two centuries, *Dharma in America* also gives some insights into the
ongoing issues and challenges these important ethnic and religious groups
face in America today.

Reviews

"Pankaj Jain has done a great service both to the Indian American community
and to the wider public with this valuable and timely book. Engagingly
written, with humor and clarity, the reader comes away with a vivid sense
of the Indian American experience. The chapter on the often overlooked Jain
community is a particular strength of this work, which is sure to become an
indispensable volume in the literature on multicultural studies."* -
Jeffery D. Long, Professor of Religion and Asian Studies, Elizabethtown
College, USA*

"Jain?s book describes the many connections between America and India with
particular attention to the areas of medicine and music. His biggest
contribution is his detailed timeline and account of the ways that Jain
immigrants and their children have organized themselves in North America
and his observation of some shifts in the foci of the second generation as
they express their American Jainism through activism rather than
renunciation. Writing as an American Jain who immigrated from India, Jain
takes the reader through his personal journey of navigating public school
politics as an example of how his own activism took shape." *- Jennifer B.
Saunders, Author of **Imagining Religious Communities: Transnational Hindus
and Their Narrative Performances (OUP, 2019).*
