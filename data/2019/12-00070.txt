Dear list members,
I am wondering about appearances of the word "sa?ar?ra" and/or "sva?ar?ra"
in various contexts.  I have encountered sa?ar?ra/sva?ar?ra in the episodes
of Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka from the *V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a*, but would be curious
to know of other places where these or similar concepts show up.  In both
of these episodes, the goal of Tri?a?ku and ?amb?ka is to enter some sort
of heavenly realm or divine form (variously referred to as divam, gatim,
svargam, devatvam etc.) with their body.  Also in these episodes, Tri?a?ku
and ?amb?ka have gone rogue to engage in *tapas *as a way of achieving this
goal.
An example from each of the *R?m?ya?a* episodes:
guru??pak?ta? r?pa? yad ida? tvayi vartate |
anena saha r?pe?a sa?ar?ro gami?yasi || VR 1.58.4 (Tri?a?ku episode)
??drayony?? pras?to 'smi tapa ugra? sam?sthita? |
devatva? pr?rthaye r?ma sa?ar?ro mah?ya?a? || VR 7.67.2 (?amb?ka episode)
I am especially curious about the use of "sa?ar?ra" in similar ways, but I
am open to any use of the term from the literature at large.
With thanks in advance,
Aaron
