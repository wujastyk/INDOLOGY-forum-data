=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Antw:_Noun_pra=E1=B9=87at?=
Dear Nagaraj,
Aren't your examples of pra?ata- (rather than pra?at-), though?
I'm with Raik in assuming that -nat- is comparable to -k?t-, i.e. a
zero-grade verbal root +-t- used at the end of a verbal governing compound.
The issue with that, of course, is that a preverb pra- wouldn't appear on
its own as a the first member of such a compound.
pra?at- does not seem to be in Wackernagel (at least not according to the
Register volume).
Curious to hear whether anyone has any more on this.
All the best,
    Antonia
