Dear colleagues,
Does anyone have a scanned copy available of the original 1900 print
of TAKAKUSU Junjir?'s "A Pail Chrestomathy with Notes and Glossary
Giving Sanskrit and Chinese Equivalents" published in 1900 by Kinkodo
& Co?
I picked up a reprint in Japan a while ago but it seems like the
reprints from 1908(?) onwards removed the 94 page English preface!
If someone has a nice scan I would be happy to upload it to Archive.org<http://Archive.org> :)
Kind regards,
