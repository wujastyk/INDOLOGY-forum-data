Hi all?
A colleague has asked me to recommend scholarship (monograph, essay, review article) that provides an overview on the nexus of Sanskrit, modern linguistics, and/or the philosophy of language. Any recommendations from this list?especially works accessible to the non-specialist?would be much appreciated.
Yours,
