[INDOLOGY] Verse Identification (Purana?)
Thanks to all who responded to my question, on and off list, with such
alacrity.
It is a plausible hypothesis that Madhva created the verse and it was later
cited as sm?ti by Baladeva in his commentary on BS 2.1.35. In the 20th
century it was erroneously attributed by some scholars (beginning with S.C.
Vasu in 1912?) to the Bhavi?ya Pur??a.
With best wishes,
Andrew
