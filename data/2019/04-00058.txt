    This was a result of earlier court directive as can be seen below.

    Both with respect to Adichanallur site and with respect to Keezhadi site, the Indian government?s actions/inactions have led to strong protests in Tamil Nadu and only judiciary?s intervention seems to help. See the case of the Keezhadi site,

    Here is a report on Keezhadi by the excavators, http://www.heritageuniversityofkerala.com/JournalPDF/Volume6/2.pdf.
