[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit and Linguistics
The late Frits Staal?s Word Order in Sanskrit and Universal Grammar, and his edited volume,A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians, may be useful here.
There is also quite a lot in Cardona, J. and Jain, D., Eds., The Indo Aryan Languages, 2nd Edition, Routledge Taylor and Francis Group, London and New York.
Good luck,

Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit and Linguistics
One might look at the work of Ferdinand de Saussure as a start.  His students compiled his lectures notes into a book (in French), and careful examination of his foundational ideas about semiotics and language suggest (at least to me) that they bear a remarkable resemblance to Bhartrhari's schemas about language. de Saussure was also a professor of Sanskrit.

?Hi all?
A colleague has asked me to recommend scholarship (monograph, essay, review article) that provides an overview on the nexus of Sanskrit, modern linguistics, and/or the philosophy of language. Any recommendations from this list?especially works accessible to the non-specialist?would be much appreciated.
Yours,
