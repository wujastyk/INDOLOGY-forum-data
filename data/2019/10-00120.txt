[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Your summary covers all the main points. Just note that, at the beginning of this thread, I had pointed out that the final verses in Tib. indeed give the name, in transcription not translation, as Thagana, which may now be taken as a confirmation.
Thanks to all for a bit of good collaborative fun.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear all,
thanks so much for this collective effort! Twiddling with Tibetan translations seems like a lot of fun that I?ve been missing out on so far!
Summarizing your suggestions, it appears the easiest, perhaps, to go with Snar-Thang?s (and Peking?s) ?sgrib byed? (thanks Peter and Paul!), and to think of it as a translation of non-Sanskrit Thakkana (thanks Roland and Matthew!) Given that, for example, sgrib cing is an attested rendering of Skt sthagita- (p. 724 in Lokesh Chandra?s Skt-Tib Dictionary), Roland?s suggestion to connect ?sgrib with ?sthag and to assume an intermediate step ? that is, Sthagana, a Sanskritized form of Thakkana ? appears very likely.
In any case, the reading seems to strengthen our initial hypothesis (also pointed out by Matthew) that ?r?macchakuna- is indeed a corruption of ?r?matthakkana-.
I think *?r?matthakkana- is more likely than *?r?matsthagana-, because in ??rad? (and in many other scripts) kka->ku is easier than ga-> ku, and because a corruption of a ?meaningless? non-Sanskrit form is much easier to explain than a corruption of a ?meaningless? Sanskrit one. Anyway, I hope that we will be able to consult Sanskrit MSS soon.
best,
Andrey

Dear all,
  If you check the reading found in the Snar-thang recension of the text, it confirms Peter's speculation; it does, in fact, read:
dpal ldan sgrib byed lha yis ni / ...
In general, Snar-thang presents far more accurate readings (assessed in terms of agreement with extant Sanskrit text) than the Sde-dge recension (whose "revised" readings are often corrupt).

Dear friends,
Since sthagana means concealment/cover, that part corresponds to sgrib, so I suspect that originally the Tibetan had sgrib byed, not sgrib med.

Dear all,
I was looking at the Tibetan translation of Candranandana?s introductory verses:
pra?amya devadeve?a? hari? v??nidhim ak?aram/
pad?rthacandrik?? ??k?? ?ubhr?? sarvahit?vah?m//1//
'phrog byed mi zad tshig gi gter // lha yi lha dba? rab btud de  //
rgyas bshad tshig don zla ba'i zer // kun la phan gsal bdag gis ni //
?r?macchakunadevena prerito h?daye sphu?am/
buddhy? kari?y?mi guro? sa?sm?tya cara??mbujam//2//
dpal ldan sgrib med (D1b4) lha yis ni // s?i? ni rnam par dra?s pas na //
bla ma'i lu? ni ya? dag ?id // gsal bar rtogs nas brtsam par bya //
As you can see, instead of expected *Tha ga na (or, at least, smth. connected to ?akuna), we find Sgrib med (*Nir?vara?a ?!).
I am really puzzled by this find and would be very grateful if anyone could suggest what I could do in order to try understanding this oddity (I am not a Tibetologist, so apologies for this, perhaps, very basic question). Are there any Tibetan lists of Indian rulers or personal names in general? Could one think of any plausible explanation for this translation given that the original could have read smth. like ?Thakkana/ ?akuna??
Thanks very much in advance!
best,
Andrey

As I see it, it is crucial that also Kalha?a mentions a ruler named
Thakkana (RT 6.230, 231, 236) as an adversary of Abhimanyu (ruled
958-972).
That is certainly correct, Roland - he must be the Tha ga na of the concluding verse.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear Mathew,
I am sure you are right, but it may be worthwhile to look at some of
the many references he has given.
As I see it, it is crucial that also Kalha?a mentions a ruler named
Thakkana (RT 6.230, 231, 236) as an adversary of Abhimanyu (ruled
958-972).
Best,
Roland
