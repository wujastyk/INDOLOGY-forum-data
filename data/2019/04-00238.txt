Governing Council,

I second the opinion of Simon Brodbeck. The posting of Jaydeep was just a continuation of the thread on the gender issue. He just brought some issues objectively without any sort of personal objectionable comments/allegations on any one. The Governing council may disclose if anyone has raised any complaint on his posting. Even if such complaint exists, in a democratic set up, it is appropriate to give a notice and to provide with an opportunity to hear from the person whose posting is found objectionable. Without any such proceedings and justifications, taking action or decision may set a wrong precedence. Kindly revisit the decision. 

Warm regards,
Shrinivasa Varakhedi

Bagchee?s post was interesting and very much to the point of our recent discussion, and I think the main way one could find it defamatory would be by confusing correlation with causation. To those who have witnessed this forum over a period of several years, the idea that the committee had ?no choice but to remove Joydeep Bagchee permanently from the list? may seem far-fetched. Not only will progress in matters of gender equality not be made by the committee proceeding in this way, but the committee may be seen to be actively hindering the making of such progress. I may be wrong, but I cannot help but suspect that Bagchee?s previous contributions, which have been famously abominated by some on this list, may have prejudiced the committee against him and caused it to overreact in this instance. One might also wonder whether the committee?s decision is somehow connected to its current male to female ratio (4:1 following the unfortunate resignation of Dr Truschke).
