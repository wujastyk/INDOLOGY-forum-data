Subject: [INDOLOGY] Book announcement: The History of the Artha??stra






 


Dear Colleagues,
&nbsp;
I am pleased to announce the publication of my new book on the compositional history of the&nbsp;Artha??stra&nbsp;and its philosophy of governance:
&nbsp;
Mark McClish.&nbsp;The History of the Artha??stra: Sovereignty and Sacred Law in Ancient India&nbsp;(Cambridge University Press, 2019), 306 pages.
&nbsp;
https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/history-of-the-arthasastra/051E3A722C5339D78EC9B57897827BCD#fndtn-information
&nbsp;
Summary:
The first half of the book presents a model of the&nbsp;Artha??stra?s textual development, arguing that the extant text is a 3rd century CE redaction of a treatise written
 a few centuries earlier. This model is then used in the second half to demonstrate that the political theologies of&nbsp;var?adharma&nbsp;and&nbsp;r?jadharma&nbsp;exerted little influence on the original text, which was decidedly empiricist and pragmatic in character.
 I argue that this disposition characterized the early statecraft tradition generally.
&nbsp;
Table of Contents:
1. Introduction
2.&nbsp;Artha??stra&nbsp;Historiography
3. The Resegmentation of the&nbsp;Artha??stra
4. Citation and Attribution
5. The Deep Structure of the Text
6. The History of the&nbsp;Artha??stra
7. The Politics of the&nbsp;Da??an?ti
8.&nbsp;Var?adharma&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Artha??stra
9.&nbsp;Statecraft, Law, and Religion in Ancient India
&nbsp;
All best,
Mark
&nbsp;
