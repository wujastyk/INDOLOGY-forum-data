&nbsp;
Summary:
The first half of the book presents a model of the&nbsp;Artha??stra?s textual development, arguing that the extant text is a 3rd century CE redaction of a treatise written
 a few centuries earlier. This model is then used in the second half to demonstrate that the political theologies of&nbsp;var?adharma&nbsp;and&nbsp;r?jadharma&nbsp;exerted little influence on the original text, which was decidedly empiricist and pragmatic in character.
 I argue that this disposition characterized the early statecraft tradition generally.
&nbsp;
