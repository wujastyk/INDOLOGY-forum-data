[INDOLOGY] help with signs in devanagari text
Hello Fran?ois,
     These signs represent *jihv?m?l?ya *and *upadhm?n?ya*, which are
sandhi variants of the common *visarga*, before *k, kh* and *p, ph*
respectively.
In some Vedic manuscripts, these two have different signs, but the signs as
you see in this text are generally called *ardhavisarga*, referring to
their half-circle shapes.
