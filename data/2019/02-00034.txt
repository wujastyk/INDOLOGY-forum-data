Dear Artur,
It seems to me that Adheesh's suggestion is correct, but I would be 
happy to hear any alternative suggestions from you. Since the paintings 
are in a private collection, I do not feel comfortable sharing them in 
their entirety without the consent of the owner. Instead I have attached 
two of the colophons with a little bit of painting around them.
Best,
Jacob
