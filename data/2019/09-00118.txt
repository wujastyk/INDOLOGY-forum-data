[INDOLOGY] Query on verse forms
Dear friends,
Thanks to all who responded to my query on gAthA and dohA. I am sorry that I did not make clear that I have very complete material on the Buddhist dohA traditions and so did not need to bother you about that. Also, though the Tamil information is of course quite interesting, it is, I regret to say, outside of my domain.
In all events, the references I have received from you promise a good start.
Thanks as always,
Matthew

Cher Herman,
in order to decrease your amount of "na?vet?", you might want to read
the 1977 book written by ?. ??. ???????? (Na. V?. Ceyar?man)
for which the title is:
??????????? ????????? ?[Cilappatik?ra Y?ppamaiti]
[[Prosody in Silappathikaram]]
Annamalai University publication
This 516 pages book is the published version of a Ph.D. thesis
I have a Xerox copy of this book thanks to a common friend of ours, who
is also a member of this list.
