[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
Dear Dominik,
This raises a fundamental question: I have been under the impression that
while one can claim copyright (what you note in your mail with (C) ) over
work like critical notes, annotations, translation etc, one *cannot* claim
copyright over editions of classical texts. (I'm not debating whether this
is reasonable or not and the effort and expertise it takes to create an
edition, just reporting my understanding of the law). Therefore, according
to my understanding, if I take your edition of a text, and type it up
*without any notes etc* i can publish it.
I suppose --maybe I am just ignorant here--that this has never been
litigated because there is no money in it for anyone. After all, who would
go to court to prevent me from copying a critical edition of the
?kprati??khya?
I realize I haven't framed this as a question, but what is your take?
