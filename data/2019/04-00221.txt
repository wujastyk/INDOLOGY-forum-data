As many of you know, English translations by the late Luis O. Gomez of both the
shorter and longer Sukh?vat?-vy?ha-s?tras, from Sanskrit, and again from
Chinese, were published in 1996 by University of Hawai'i Press in the book
titled, The Land of Bliss. These were what he called his "free"
translations of these texts. Two more volumes were to come out, giving his
technical translations of these texts, heavily annotated. Does anyone know
if these translations were completed? If they still exist? If they will
ever be published?

Thanks.

Best regards,
