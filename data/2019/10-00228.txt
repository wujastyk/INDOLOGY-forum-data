[INDOLOGY] Eye-copy of an inscription in Paris BnF
Dear colleagues,
In the framework of the TST project (https://tst.hypotheses.org/) I have
started to examine rubbings and eye-copies of inscriptions kept at the BnF
in Paris.
Among these is the item ?Indien 720?, for which we have the following
description: https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc1046846
It appears to be a scale eye-copy of a Sanskrit inscription (which would be
in very big letters if it is indeed a scale reproduction, as the sheet is 200
x 95 mm).
