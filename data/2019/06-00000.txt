[INDOLOGY] Vishwakarma Craftsmen
Dear list members,
I am wondering if anyone has access the following article:
Ramaswamy, Vijaya. "Vishwakarma Craftsmen in Early Medieval Peninsular
India", in: *Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient*,
vol. 47, n. 4 (2004), pp. 548-582.
It seems to be available on JSTOR, but at the institution I can visit at
the moment I have no access to most of the contents of JSTOR, hence my
query on this list.
All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
