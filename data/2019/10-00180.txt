[INDOLOGY] Sad news
An awful news. Allison, a vigorous person with a fine sense of humour,
kind heart and open soul is not any longer with us.
Allison, an outstanding scholar, amazingly sensitive to
intratextual connections in complicated early Indo-Aryan/Braj texts and their
  relationship to the historical and cultural context, passed away at  
a painfully young
age.
Her family, close friends and students will know that many people in  
many countries
love her and mourn for her together with them. We can only wish  
limitless strength
to those to whom the loss is unbearable.
