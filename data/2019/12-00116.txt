Thank you to Gerard Huet and Roland Steiner who confirmed off-list that k?????a
is a benedictine middle form.
I've found k?????a given as an example in the laghukaumudi (verse 726  in
Ballantyne's edition but verse 683 in the GRETIL version).  I was surprised
at this given the forms rarity.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
