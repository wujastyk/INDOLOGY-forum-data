Forget about interlibrary loan.  That will not work.  The link provided should show how to order scans as an individual.  It will not be a free service.  You will be charged for the scans.  RR

Dear Rocher Rosane
Thanks for your help,
I gone through the link provided, unfortunately inter library loan is not possible in this case, as my university is not providing such facility.
Thanks

Dear Krishnaprasad,
The interlibrary loan is a free service that only functions between universities.  Go to https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak/reprographic-services for all necessary information.  The call number (British shelfmark) for the item you seek is PK669 .A68 1891.  The item is listed as "in place."  I can't go and verify.  I am stuck at home with a fractured toe.
Best wishes,

Dear all
I am forwarding the reply I received from Pennsylvania Library USA,
My library doesn't allow to put forward the interlibrary loan request, in fact they are not aware of that and I am failed to convince the curator. That's is the reason on personal mail I requested.
I wonder, could any one take the hassle here to help me out for the scan. I will bear all the costs incurred. Your help is highly admired.
The Kususmamala Vol 2 available on archive is not 1st edition.

RE: Request for Scan Copy
Dear Krishna Prasad,
We do have this book and do provide scanning services.  Please have the interlibrary loan department of your university contact us at this email to inquire about placing a request.  We can only fill requests from universities, not from individual patrons.
Very best regards,
