The matter was also brought up following yesterday's memorial service
for Prof. Werba, and I've tried to find out some more for my ongoing
G?yatr? study. I hope it helps somehow.  
The precative is most often made from aorist stems, and is thus very
close to the aorist optative (lacking the s of the precative). The
aorist of causatives is usually the reduplicating aorist, and the aorist
optative would therefore be prac?cud?t (cf. Macdonell's Vedic Grammar
for Students, p. 174, ?149.4). Apparently, however, no active
_precative_ form of a reduplicating aorist is attested, and I think it
would be rather speculative to postulate a Vedic aorist precative
prac?cudy??s or prac?cudy??t.  
Interestingly, the precative is theoretically also made from the present
stem of secondary verbs. Both Whitney (384, ?1049) and M?ller (1886:
113, ?385, note 2) remark that in the precative active of causative
verbs, the suffix ay is to be _replaced_ by the suffix y?s. Whitney,
however, regards this formation "as purely fictitious"  (it would be
really interesting to see if a precative like this is actually attested
somewhere). Anyhow, the fictitious Sanskrit precative of pracodayati
would thus be pracody?t. 
In the RV, pracod?y?t is definitely a subjunctive of a causative verb.
However, since classical Sanskrit doesn't have the subjunctive, many
reciters of the G?yatr?(s) must have had some difficulties in
understanding this form (if they tried to); I hope I'll gain some
insight in this matter in my dissertation.
