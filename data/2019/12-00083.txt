What could also be noted is that when _sa?ar?ra_ is used, it does not
always mean that one simply keeps the mortal body and "physically" goes
to heaven, the _brahmaloka_ or any other place. As result of performing
the Agnicayana (or one of its subforms, the N?ciketacayana), a new body
is obtained after death. Taittir?ya Br?hma?a III 11.7.3 reads: _s??ar?ra
ev? svarg?? lok?m eti_, '_embodied_, he goes to the heavenly world.' But
this obviously has to be a new body (so _sa?ar?ra_ might be opposed to
_sva?ar?ra_?) .  
Personally I'm convinced that there were quite a few overlaps between
"Epic-yogic" and "Vedic-ritualistic" (broadly speaking) ways of
imagining the goal of salvation (argued here:
doi.org/10.1007/s10781-019-09408-y [4]). My point is that there were
different views about the way of embodiment in the afterlife (the
polysemy of the word _?tman_ was helpful in this case), and people
constantly "remixed" and blended ideas from various sources. This might
also be relevant in some way for the Epic stories and for Tri?a?ku and
his sacrifice.
