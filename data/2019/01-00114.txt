[INDOLOGY] Mumbai bookshops
Dear friends,
I?ll be visiting Mumbai next week for the first time in some years. I would be grateful for recommendations of bookstores, both indological, if any still exist in the Maximum City, as well as shops dealing more generally in current Indian publications.
With thanks in advance,
Matthew
