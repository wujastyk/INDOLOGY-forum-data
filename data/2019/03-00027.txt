Dear Colleagues,

Please allow me to call your attention to the new *English language MA 
programme in Indology* at the Department of Indian Studies, *E?tv?s 
Lor?nd University*, Budapest.

The programme is a two-year, full-time course, including four semesters. 
It has two specializations: Sanskrit and Hindi. The students of the 
programme acquire a deep and thorough knowledge of the chosen language 
(Sanskrit or Hindi) and with the help of this, they study a wide range 
of subjects (history, literature, religious studies, philosophy, art 
history, etc.) through the reading and analysis of primary sources. The 
teachers at the department are specialized in Sanskrit philology and 
literature, Indo-Aryan and Comparative Indo-European linguistics, Hindi 
language and literature.

For more *information* on the MA course in general visit the website of 
the university (https://www.elte.hu/en/indology-ma) or write an e-mail 
to ittzes.mate at btk.elte.hu <mailto:ittzes.mate at btk.elte.hu> or 
dezso.csaba at btk.elte.hu <mailto:dezso.csaba at btk.elte.hu>

*Application* is possible through the following webpage:

Application *deadlines* for the 2019/2020 academic year are 15th April 
and 15th June 2019.

With best wishes,
