Dear Scholars,
It is my pleasure to present the digitized version of the following book
before you.
N?n?rthama?jar? of R?ghava

https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/nanarthamanjari_raghava/orig/nanarthamanjari.txt

Credits -
The work was digitized by Dr. P. Srinivas as part of Sansknet project.
Some errors here and there have been corrected in the present work.

N.B. -
Some scholars have asked for an easier way to download the existing
collection of Sanskrit koshas.
https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/archive/master.zip holds the data
in zip format.
Book_Author/orig/Book.txt is the usual place where you will find the text
e.g. nanarthamanjari_raghava/orig/nanarthamanjari.txt
