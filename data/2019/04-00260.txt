Dear Colleagues,

     I found an old 2010 agreement that was signed between the University
of Michigan and someone named Jiri Holba at the Charles University in
Prague regarding publishing a Czech translation of my Sa?skr?ta-Subodhin?:
A Sanskrit Primer.  Neither I nor anyone at the University of Michigan ever
heard again from this individual and I have not seen such a translation.
Has anyone come across a Czech translation of my book?  If you have, can
you please send me details of this publication?  Thanks for any
assistance.  This question has come up since someone at the University of
Michigan found this old agreement and wrote to me asking if anything
further developed.
