[INDOLOGY] The Earliest English Translation of the Rigveda [Publication Announcement]
 Dear Professor Lusthaus,
I agree with what you say. It was exactly for this reason that I had put
the adjective "scholarly" in the only context of "Rigvedic translations":
"[Ludwig ...] produced an *English translation of the Rigveda* between the
years 1886 and 1893, *which *at the same time *proved to be the first
scholarly translation* into English [...]".
Translating "S?ya?a's" interpretation from classical Sanskrit is an
admirable achievement in itself. But it is different from a Rigveda
translation. I do not doubt Wilson will retain his esteem in this very
lineage quite as demanded by you and of course as deserved.
Kind regards,
WS
