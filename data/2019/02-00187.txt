=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]=09Mahabharata_referenes_in_B=C3=B6htlingk_Roth?=
Following up this thread: I was aware of the MBh references in PW, but what
I have been unable to pin down is what is referred to as the scolia. I
assumed it to refer to N?laka??ha, but in the event I was unable to locate
the passage I needed (eventually, I confess, I gave up and just cited PW
itself...)
