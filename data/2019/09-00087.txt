[INDOLOGY] Accusative of direction
Dear Oliver,
     You may find discussions by grammarians on semantic sub-types of
Karman useful in this respect.  Works from Bhartr?hari's V?kyapad?ya to
Kau??abha??a's Vaiy?kara?a-Bh??a?a and N?ge?a's Laghuma?j??? discuss these
sub-types.  The discussions on verb semantics classifying verbs into
kartr?stha-kriyaka versus karmastha-kriyaka and kartr?stha-bh?vaka versus
karmastha-bh?vaka may also provide some clues.  I have discussed the
effects of some semantic sub-types of Karman [affected versus non-affected]
in the syntax of passives of dvikarmaka verbs.  You can see this in a
sentence like aj?? gr?ma? nayati > aj? gr?ma? n?yate; but not aj?? gr?ma?
n?yate.  On the other hand, gr?ma? gacchati can be passivized as gr?ma?
gamyate.  So gr?ma in relation to nayati and gacchati seems to have a
somewhat different perception.  With respect to nayati, it may be more or
less adverbial as you say.  On the other hand, with respect to gacchati, it
has some closer semantic connection.  This looks like a great topic for
deeper introspection.  Perhaps Hans Hock and George Cardona could add to
this discussion.  With best wishes,
Madhav
