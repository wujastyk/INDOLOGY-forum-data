Dear Matthew,
AF gives a whole new meaning to "logorrhea"....
I was actually rather impressed with how brief and to the point Arnaud managed to keep his reply to me! As for what you say about his tone: that I agree with:-).
All the best,

Seems Audrey Truschke may have had a point valid point regarding the sexism on this list.
This is totally inappropriate. I find this list a valuable resource but I will not be part of it if this type of language is deemed anything resembling acceptable.

@ Antonia Ruppel
Obviously, you're a total leftist shithead.
To start with, Nazis were Socialists. They have nothing to do with the Right or even less with the Far-Right, whatever that means.
So you "mail" is nothing but allout Marxist crap.
So I would call the NiwBitch on your mail.
With Best Regards.

It should also be pointed out that the discussion has gone beyond Godwin's Law to Niwdog's law (Godwin reversed):  this is when a discussion member claims Godwin's law in a case where the person called a Nazi for all intents and purposes is a Nazi, where someone called a right-wing extremist actually is a right-wing extremist, etc. This is the common name for what Hans pointed out in relation to the Godwin's Law Wikipedia entry.
And so I call Niwdog's Law on Arnaud's original email.

yes, precisely so
IMHO, the issue is that there are authorized insults like "far-right" or "racist" and non-authorized insults like "asshole", "bastard", etc.
The first set usually escapes moderation censureship, while the other set is usually not accepted.

Dear Dean,
It's a reference to Godwin's law<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law>, "if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds".

Could you please clarify your point for us who are Godwin-deprived?

yes, I agree that jerks who overuse the word "far-right" should rather
create their own list somewhere else.
