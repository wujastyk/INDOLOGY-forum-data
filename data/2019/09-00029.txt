Hi Madhav,

You can get the article from Reich?s website. I repost below what I said earlier on the Indo-Eurasian List, where we routinely track the aDNA evidence.

Best,
Steve

Dear List,

Published yesterday in Science: the most important study yet of the population of South Asia & Central Asia, out of David Reich?s lab at Harvard. What amazing progress in the field in the last four years!

The paper is behind paywalls ? a Science specialty ? but there is a direct link to the pdf at the Reich lab webpage. Magnificent maps and multiple summaries as well (check out  Box 2. Summary of key findings)!

https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/2019_Science_NarasimhanPatterson_CentralSouthAsia.pdf <https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/2019_Science_NarasimhanPatterson_CentralSouthAsia.pdf>

Narendra Modi & the BJP party & all their Hindutva friends I?m sure ? since they follow the science closely ? will be convinced by the evidence here to change their views of ancient history!  :)

If you have some spare time, count the number of authors on the paper. 

The lesson in the count: a reminder that science is a collective & international endeavor, which is exactly why no scientific paper ? ever, under any circumstances ? should be hidden behind paywalls.
