In fact, the late Anantalal Thakur demonstrated that the SDS was NOT written by ??????????? but by his protege, the logician Cannibha??a.

He provides his evidence, which is entirely convincing, here:
Anantalal Thakur, ?Cannibha??a and the authorship of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha,? Bulletin of the Adyar Library 25
(1961): 524?538.

It is odd that few seem to have taken note of Thakur's impressive detective work and that most still attribute the SDS to ?????.


best regards,

Matthew
