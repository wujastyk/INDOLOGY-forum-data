[INDOLOGY] Saundarya Lahari
Hi everyone,
Apologies for the cross-posting on RISA.
I have a student who is interested in studying contemporary debates
regarding the attribution of the Saundarya Lahari to Shankara.  I'm sort of
at a loss on this one: does anyone know of any articles or book chapters to
which I might point him?
Thanks!
