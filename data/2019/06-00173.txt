Dear Bill,
Maybe there is something in J. Gonda's work
Praj?pati's relations with Brahman, B?haspati and Brahm?, Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Company, 1989 (Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, Afd. Letterkunde)

Best wishes

Dear colleagues,
I wonder if anyone could point me to any recent research on the history of Brahm? as a deity in early Vedic (pre-Buddhist) sources. I am aware of Bailey?s The mythology of Brahm?, where he described his origin as the apotheosization of the brahm? priest in the ?rauta sacrifice. I am also aware of Thieme?s very thorough study on the Br?hman in his Kleine Schriften (Teil I), where the the original senses and etymology as in RV are discussed. I am however still somewhat puzzled about the presence of Brahm? as a deity in the early Vedic sa?hit?s.
This puzzle came about when I was going through the list of nak?atras in all the Vedic sources, which give either 27 or 28. The difference between 27 and 28 lies in the nak?atra Abhijit, which is always associated with Brahm?. If Brahm? has a late origin, it is likely then an interpolation, and the 28-nak?atra system may also likely postdate the 27 one. But before I proceed on this line of analysis, I would appreciate it if anyone could enlighten me on Brahm? as an deity in the early Vedic sources, along with the most updated references on studies on the early Vedic deities.
Best regards,
Bill Mak
