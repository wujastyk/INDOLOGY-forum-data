Vernacular Literature, Migrant Experience and Resettlement in South Asian
Cities
This panel invites papers which explore literary approaches to migration,
dislocation and resettlement in the megacities of South Asia. The panel is
particularly interested in fictions and autobiographical narratives in
vernacular languages and coming from the post Emergency period.

Long Abstract
Migration from villages and small towns to megacities is a crucial aspect
of contemporary South Asia. Leaving aside sociological, political or
economic perspectives, this panel aims at analysing migrant experiences
through the lens of fictional and autobiographical narratives. Besides its
rarity, by privileging the literary, we intend to engage with the
subjectivities, detailed profiling of migrant characters and their lives.
We wish to anchor upon fictional and autobiographical narratives or
experiential writings from vernacular languages, primarily but not
exclusively Hindi. As number of studies dealing with migration and
resettlement have centred around the Partition of India, this panel invites
contributors to chart a relatively ignored period: post Emergency phase of
the contemporary. This panel aims at bringing into conversation scholars
interested in themes such as (though not restricted to) expectations and
aspirations of migrants; effects of dislocation on their everyday life;
negotiation of social, religious and economic identity in the new urban
setting; ways of dealing with the notion of ?informality? in literature;
migrant ?production of space? (Lefebvre); representation of life in
megacities; literary strategies adopted by narrators; literary construction
of events, subjectivities and approaches to urban experiences of migration.
Papers creatively mobilising inter-disciplinary perspectives and methods
(i.e. combining anthropological and literary methods) are particularly
invited. While this panel will focus on Indian megacities and Hindi
literature, contributions that engage with other South Asian megapolis and
other languages are also welcome.
