I checked the two Maitr?ya?? Pari?i??as, namely Gon?mika and Caturhotr?ka,
published by Raghu Vira in the Journal of Vedic Studies, and neither of
them has anything with reference to Upanayana.  So it must be some other
Maitr?ya?? Pari?i??a that the ???? ?????? account seems to be referring
to.  Vishal Agarwal says: "The Prince of Wales Museum at Mumbai has a
manuscript containing all these [Maitr?ya??] Parishishtas."  I wonder if
these manuscripts have been digitized and if there is a way to access
them?
