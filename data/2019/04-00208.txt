[INDOLOGY] New Scientist article about the Yamnaya migrations (27 March 2019 )
Perhaps it?s worth pointing out that current research suggests that Ashkenazi Jews also have a mixture of DNA ? paternal DNA from the near east but maternal DNA mostly from Europe. I don?t think anyone has suggested that the Jews have a violent history as anything but victims in Europe. It seems to me that Richards? suggestion is irresponsible and almost certainly inaccurate.
