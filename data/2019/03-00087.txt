Hello Jan,

     Here is my recording of my verse in ?ry?.  This is the general style
of reciting ?ry? in Maharashtra.  This meter was made popular in Marathi by
a poet named Moropant [May?rakavi] during the Peshwa period.  He composed
108 different R?m?ya?as, and an entire Mah?bh?rata in Marathi using ?ry?.
