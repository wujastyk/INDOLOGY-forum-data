[INDOLOGY] First Book Subvention
Dear All:
Apologies for cross-posting. The newly established Ludo and Rosane Rocher Foundation has created a ?first books? program to provide subventions to young scholars seeking to publish their first book. Please see the attached notice. Please feel free to share this with scholars who may not subscribe to Indology or RISA. With best wishes,
Patrick
