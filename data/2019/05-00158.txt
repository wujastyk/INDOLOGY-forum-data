Dear Matthew,

There are indeed at least two v?caspatimi?ra authors. The earlier author wrote ny?yaka?ik? and other philosophical commentaries, as well as one treatise, tattvabindu?. The scholarly consensus is that he was active in the 11th century CE. See pages xviii and following in the introduction to tattvasam?k?? edited by Diwakar Acharya (V?caspatimi?ra?s Tattvasam?k?? The Earliest Commentary on Ma??anami?ra?s Brahmasiddhi, Stuttgart, 2006) for recent dating information on the earlier v?caspatimi?ra? (V?caspatimi?ra? I). Ludo Rocher distinguishes two v?caspatimi?ra authors and a third with similar name in the introduction to his edition Vyavah?racint?ma?i A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure, Gent, 1956. Karin Preisendanz distinguishes the two v?caspatimi?ra authors in the introduction in part 1 of Studien zu Ny?yas?tra III.1 mit dem Ny?yatattv?loka V?caspati Mi?ras II (Stuttgart, 1994). I don?t keep up with all of the secondary literature on v?caspatimi?ra?, even through I am nearing the end of a long running critical edition of vidhiviveka? and ny?yaka?ik?, but I find it difficult to accept that any scholar can identify the two as one, any more than we can identify ma??anami?ra?, the author of vidhiviveka? and other works, with Dr. Mandan Mishra.
