[INDOLOGY] Captain G.T. Marshall
Dear all,
I am looking for the basic information about the life and career of Captain G.T. Marshall, who served as the secretary of the College of Fort William from 1838 to 1852. Through the HathiTrust DL and Google books, I can see that what I need is printed in four pages (pp. 58, 102-103, 122) of a volume by Sisir Kumar Das, Sahibs and munshis. An account of the College of Fort William (Calcutta: Orion Publications, 1978). Unfortuantely, the book is not owned by any Italian library. Is there someone so kind as to send me pictures of those pages? 
Thank you very much in advance for your help.
Best wishes,
Marco
