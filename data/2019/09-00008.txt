Subject: [INDOLOGY] Siva-vatuka and Sia-Aghora
Message-ID: <bd005adf-45ec-73ab-7cc8-add3118a28d9@gmail.com>

Dear listmembers,
there are some monasteries in Sri Lanka with small temples for Hindu 
gods like Shiva and Vishnu. At the entrance of the Shiva- or Skanda 
temple are paintings of Siva-Va?uka (< Bhairava-v?hana) and Siva-Aghora. 
There are some descriptions in secondary literature about this custom in 
South India, but nowhere is mentioned a temple with this paintings or 
statues at the entrance.
Does anyone of you have seen this while visiting a temple in India? Are 
there any photos?

Thank you

Heiner
