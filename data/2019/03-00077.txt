My question concerns the first initial in Roman script. The rest is clear to me. Also, if it seems that it is not P./B. R. Puru??ttama N?ya?u, then I would be happy to receive any other suggestions.
Many Thanks,
Victor

Dear all,
I am hoping that someone might be able to help me with the reading of the first initial found in the image below. I would like this to be the autograph of Pu. R?. Puru?ottama N?ya?u, a renowned ?r?-Vai??ava scholar, but I find it difficult to see a P or a B (as it is sometimes given) in the letter as written. The date, 10/4/(19)28 falls comfortably within his lifespan (1901-1976).
Many Thanks,
Victor
P.S. Please let me know if the image has not come through.
