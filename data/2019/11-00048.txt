To my knowledge, the first text that states in so many words that the Veda is eternal and not composed is Pata?jali?s Mah?bh??ya (which uses the word nitya, but not apauru?eya; it does however deny that the Veda has been made (k?ta)). K?ty?yana appears to agree with Pata?jali. My paper ?When and why did the Veda become eternal?? is scheduled to appear in the proceedings of the most recent Vedic workshop.

Does anyone know the origin of the term and concept that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya", eternal and uncreated by humans?

I have heard it might have originated in Karma Mimamsa.

Also, any information about how it was conceived, discussed and debated would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Dean
