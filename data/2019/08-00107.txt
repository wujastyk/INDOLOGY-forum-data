[INDOLOGY] Chakma Manuscripts
Hello Jan,
Some friends of mine from Tripura University told me that the university
manuscript section possesses certain Mog and Chakma manuscripts.
If you want I can keep you in touch with my friends for further information
about the collection. They teach Sanskrit there.
Regards,
Deepro
