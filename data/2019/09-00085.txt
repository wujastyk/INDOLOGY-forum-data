Subject: [INDOLOGY] Weil, The Illiad, Poem of Might (PDF)
Message-ID: <d7bca9bfb609afbd85e429607b8ec788f4933f96.camel@indica-et-buddhica.org>

Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have a PDF of Simone Weil's "The Illiad, Poem of Might" to
hand? I've misplaced my photostat. The translation I need appeared in:

The Simone Weil reader / George A. Panichas (New York: McKay, 1977)

I have McCarthy, but the excerpts in front of me are from Panichas:

Mary McCarthy, tr., The Iliad, or the Poem of Force, Chicago Review,
18:2 (1965)


Best, Richard
