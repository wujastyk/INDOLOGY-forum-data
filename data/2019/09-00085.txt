[INDOLOGY] Weil, The Illiad, Poem of Might (PDF)
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone have a PDF of Simone Weil's "The Illiad, Poem of Might" to
hand? I've misplaced my photostat. The translation I need appeared in:
The Simone Weil reader / George A. Panichas (New York: McKay, 1977)
I have McCarthy, but the excerpts in front of me are from Panichas:
Mary McCarthy, tr., The Iliad, or the Poem of Force, Chicago Review,
18:2 (1965)
Best, Richard
