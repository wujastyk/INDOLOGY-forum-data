Dear Listmembers,
on archive.org I found all volumes of LeCoq's /Sp?tantike/, but vol. 4 
is missing.
Anyone can share with me a pdf of this volume 4?
LeCoq, /Die Buddhistische Sp?tantike in Mittelasien/, 4. Teil (1924/25?).
There is no more copyright.
You can also send easy with /wetransfer.com/, if there are any problems 
with your email-account regarding the size of attached pdfs.
Best regards
Heiner
