[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
Dear Jonathan and Dominik,
I just had the very same thoughts. I'm not an expert of law either, but 
technically speaking, the BORI Mah?bh?rata is not simply an edition, but 
a new text created by its editors between 1919 and 1966. The editors 
are, in this case, actually authors, who obviously transferred their 
copyright to the still existing BORI. So unless an ancient and complete 
manuscript appears which contains the very same text as the BORI 
Mah?bh?rata (very unlikely, I would say), the BORI holds the copyright 
of its text. According to German law (mentioned by Dominik), however, it 
does not ? 25 years have long gone past since the publication of the 
original edition. The co-owned copyright of Prof. Tokunaga (1994), too, 
would expire this year ? in Germany.
Of course, authors also have the copyright to transcriptions of their 
text ? just imagine someone would transcribe a talk you give and then 
publish it as their own text. I would argue that creating an electronic 
transcription of a (copyrighted) Devan?gar? text isn't much different.
Best regards,
Dominik A. Haas
