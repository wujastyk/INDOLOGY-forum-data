[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear all,
I was looking at the Tibetan translation of Candranandana?s introductory verses:
'phrog byed mi zad tshig gi gter // lha yi lha dba? rab btud de ?//
rgyas bshad tshig don zla ba'i zer // kun la phan gsal bdag gis ni //
dpal ldan sgrib med (D1b4) lha yis ni // s?i? ni rnam par dra?s pas na //
bla ma'i lu? ni ya? dag ?id // gsal bar rtogs nas brtsam par bya //
As you can see, instead of expected *Tha ga na (or, at least, smth. connected to ?akuna), we find Sgrib med (*Nir?vara?a ?!).
I am really puzzled by this find and would be very grateful if anyone could suggest what I could do in order to try understanding this oddity (I am not a Tibetologist, so apologies for this, perhaps, very basic question). Are there any Tibetan lists of Indian rulers or personal names in general? Could one think of any plausible explanation for this translation given that the original could have read smth. like ?Thakkana/ ?akuna??
Thanks very much in advance!
best,
Andrey
