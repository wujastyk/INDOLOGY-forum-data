[INDOLOGY] new book
Dear Colleagues,
At the risk of shameless self promotion I wish to announce the publication of a novel I have written.
In Search of Bliss. A Tale of Early Buddhism, (Vanguard, Cambridge, HK)
It is being released tomorrow and can be obtained from most large booksellers.

It is a fictional work detailing search for details about the Buddha?s cousin, Ananda, eight hundred years after the Buddha?s parinirvana. Some of you may be interested in it.
Cheers,
Greg Bailey
