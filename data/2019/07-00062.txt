Dear colleagues,

Many thanks to Rafal Kleczek, Lidia Wotczak and Christophe Vieille for their swift-as-thought responses, which have provided me with a link <https://ia802809.us.archive.org/29/items/ParashuramaKalpaSutraWithRamesvaraCommentaryS.YDave/Parashurama%20Kalpa%20Sutra%20With%20Ramesvara%20Commentary%20-%20S.%20Y%20Dave.pdf> to the edition I was after and made me realise that I need to work on refining (or perhaps unrefining) my search terms on archive.org.

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim
