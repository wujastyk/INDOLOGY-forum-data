[INDOLOGY] Question
It is perhaps worthy of note that Scheftelowitz in his critical Khila
edition of the RV has recorded a number of variant readings:
*?r?*? for *?r?r*
?*varcasyam* for ?*varcasvam*
*?vidh?c chobham?na?, ?vidh?t pavam?na?* and *?yudh?t pavam?na?*
for *?vidh?c chubham?nam.*
(Die Apokryphen des ?gveda (*Khil?ni*). Hrsg. und bearbeitet von J.
Scheftelowitz. [Indische Forschungen. 1]. Breslau 1906, p. 78.)
The variant reading *?yudh?t* is of particular interest here, as *?yudha*
(?weapon, implement?) seems to have been regarded as semantically closely
related to *?vidh?t*, if we derive the meaning of *?vidha* with Indian
grammarians from *?*-?*vyadh* (cp. ?pte, and Pata?jali below). The
emergence of the explanatory variant *?yudha* is most likely to be
explained from this background.
This, then, would rather result in the meaning of ?eine Art Bohrer? (pw),
?an awl, a drill? (MW) for *?vidha*.
*vyadhi* | *?vidhyanti ten?vidham* | *vyadhi *|| *hani *[...] ||
*yudhi* | *?yudhyante
ten?yudham* ||
(Pata?jali?s Mbh, ed. Kielhorn, 3rd ed., Vol. II. Poona 1965, p. 150, 22ff)
The idea of extracting shining beauty (*?obha*?/*?ubham?na*) by "drilling"
with an instrument (similar to the well-known ?churning?) is perhaps not
too far-fetched in the context of the ?r?s?kta.
