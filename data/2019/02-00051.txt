Now, coming to your

" in the ancient days females were not supposed to learn Sanskrit ",

I do not know what is meant by " ancient days" and /or  " were not supposed
to " and /or "learn"   and /or " Sanskrit" .

If you mean by Sanskrit, the language Sanskrit, and if you go to 'ancient
days' when Sanskrit and Prakrit were mutually intelligible, if  you
consider using Sanskrit and Prakrit as two mutually intelligible versions
of the same language in Sanskrit plays as a reality of a certain period of
time, then there is no need to "learn" Sanskrit for any Prakrit speakers
including women if we take women speaking Prakrit as the situation in
reality.

If it comes to S'aastra knowledge among women , if Vasa's depiction is
considered to reflect social reality, S'akuntala's depiction in quoting
s'aastras in verses such as


   ?????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ???? | ???????????? ??? ????????
   ??????? ?????????? ||??||??? 63

   shows s'aastra knowledge among women.
