[INDOLOGY] Revocation of membership
 Thanks!
I did see my message to the group, so something appears to be working. Of course, I didn't know that until I posted it and got the mirror message.
But I did expect there to be more comments than just the one I forwarded.
Best,
Dean

 Why did I only receive this indirectly? Is there a problem with my membership?
