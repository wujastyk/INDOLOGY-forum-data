[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear colleagues,
It seems to be high time to terminate the debate.
However, I would like to join Professor Falk in asking Dr. Truschke:  
What happened?
I was sure I had missed portrayal of the insulting incidents.
(Of course it's not necessary to name the male person(s).)
I am ashamed to admit that in more than 40 years of my career in indology
I have never experienced sexism nor recognized a sexist case in my academic
environment.
With best regards,
Tatiana Oranskaia
