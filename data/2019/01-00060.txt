*Three Day Buddhist Pram??a Workshop*

*Organized by*

Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India
*CALL FOR PARTICIPATION*
Centre for Religious Studies invites applications for a three-day *Buddhist
Pram??a Workshop* from *February 10-12, 2019* in Manipal.
*About the Workshop*
The workshop will principally include a close textual reading of selections
from various texts of the Buddhist Pram??a Tradition each followed by
various contributions and discussions. We will read the extracts from the
following texts:
   - ? *Ny?yabindu* with the *??k?* of Dharmottara: first chapter (
   *Pratyak?a-pariccheda*) (led by Prof Pradeep Gokhale)
   - *? V?ts?putr?y?tmapar?k??* (= *Tattvasa?graha* verses 336-349, and the
   relative *Tattvasa?grahapa?jik?*) (led by Prof Francesco Sferra)
   - *? Pram???ntarabh?vapar?k??* (= *Tattvasa?graha* verses 1486-1524, and
   the relative *Tattvasa?grahapa?jik?*) (led by Prof Francesco Sferra)
The aim is to examine how the Buddhist Pram??a Tradition systematically
develops its logical-epistemological tools. The workshop expects to delve
into extensive philosophical discussions while at the same time working
closely with the textual sources adopting philological methods. This is
possible by focusing on small portions of texts mentioned above and
attempting to situate the philosophical problems in larger discussions
taking help from the experts. The workshop will begin by asking how
N?g?rjuna?s (c. 150-250 CE) dialectics in his works like the
*M?lamadhyamakak?rik?* and the *Vigrahavy?vartan?* become a source of many
logical arguments or how Dharmak?rti (*fl*. c. 6th or 7th CE) in his works
such as the *Ny?yabindu*, the *Pram??avini?caya* and the
*Pram??av?rtika* elaborates
and clarifies Di?n?ga?s (c. 480-540 CE) Theory of Knowledge. Thereafter,
the problem at focus will be how ??ntarak?ita (c. 725?788 CE) in his
*Tattvasa?graha* and Kamala??la (c. 740-795 CE) in his commentary on the
same text titled the *Tattvasa?grahapa?jik?* deal with the concepts of Self
and Verbal Testimony.
