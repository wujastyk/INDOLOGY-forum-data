[INDOLOGY] Tarika Sangraha and Tantra Siddhanta Ratnavali
Dear all
The two books
Tarkasangraha with Ganga commentary by Sivadatta Misra
Tantra Siddhanta Ratnavali by Chinna svami Sastri
Are available on archive, unfortunately the pages are missing and some
pages are poor quality scan which is impossible to read.
I am trying for years now with no luck. Could anyone please scan the copy
for me. Your help is highly appreciated.
Yours sincerely
KP
