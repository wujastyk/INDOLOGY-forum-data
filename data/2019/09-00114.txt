for what is worth, I am happily using the hinglish keyboard on the ipad for Indian diacritics  plus a few added characters via text replacements in settings:
e.g. the  m? offered by the hinglish keyboard under m can be replaced with ?
and other rext replacements can be defined when necessary

best,
Burkhard

Thanks Jan very much--this looks promising and I will try to test it out soon.

FYI I received this reply from one of the Ukelele development team members about the possibility of setting something up in Ukelele use Sanskrit-relevant diacritics in MS Word on the Ipad with Apple's smart keyboard:
"Sorry, but that's not possible. The iPad has a different keyboard
processing system to the Mac, so Mac keyboard layouts won't work with
iOS devices. As far as I know, you are limited to the keyboard layouts
available in the App Store. Keyman offers the widest variety, I think,
but developing a new keyboard is only possible with Keyman Developer,
which is Windows-only. But you might find what you need already out there."

Hello,

I have underestimated the submission process length, but in case you cannot
use keyboard or install software, I have made a simple online add-in for
Word/PowerPoint that you can use to enter the diacritics (unless your
organization disabled using Office add-ins).

Windows and Mac: Go to Insert tab > Get Add-Ins and search for Indic
Online in browser: Go to Insert tab > Add-ins > Store and search for Indic
iPad: In landscape mode, go to Insert tab > Add-ins > All > search for Indic

Add the add-in and you should get a taskpane with character buttons, see
http://apps.ujca.cz/IndicInputWebPane/ for a screenshot.

It's not a great typing experience but better than nothing.

Hope this helps,
Jan

Hello

Has anyone found a way to type Sanskrit diacritics in MS-Word on the Ipad?

So far my attempts have been fruitless.

Cheers
James
