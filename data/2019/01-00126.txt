Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pdf request: Oudh Catalogue of Sanskrit mss XIX
Message-ID: <795C3DFD-6892-47A7-A4DD-6B3B326F6262@soas.ac.uk>

Dear colleagues,

Would anybody happen to have a pdf of fascicle XIX of Pandit Devipras?da?s Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts from Oudh (published 1887)? The indology site?s collection goes only to XVIII and I can?t find it elsewhere online (i.e. archive.org and dli).

All the best,

Jim
