[INDOLOGY] Pdf request: Oudh Catalogue of Sanskrit mss XIX
Dear colleagues,
Would anybody happen to have a pdf of fascicle XIX of Pandit Devipras?da?s Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts from Oudh (published 1887)? The indology site?s collection goes only to XVIII and I can?t find it elsewhere online (i.e. archive.org and dli).
All the best,
Jim
