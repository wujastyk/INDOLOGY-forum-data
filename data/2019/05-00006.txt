Dear Indology list members,

We have just launched a crowdfunding campaign for the study and digital publishing of two newly available 1st to 2nd century CE G?ndh?r? scrolls. The first contains a portion of the first chapter of a G?ndh?r? version of the Sam?dhir?ja-s?tra, the Discourse on the King of Concentrations. The second contains a portion of a G?ndh?r? version of the ninth chapter of the Pratyutpanna-buddha-sa?mukh?vasthita-sam?dhi-s?tra, the Discourse on the Concentration of Direct Encounter with the Buddhas of the Present Time. Both are, by centuries, our earliest witnesses of these important Mah?y?na texts and shed new light on the rise of the Mah?y?na and its literary traditions.

For further information on these texts, our project and the donation platform, see https://crowdfunding.sydney.edu.au/project/10335

If enough people donated even a modest amount, our crowdfunding initiative will easily reach its goal. The University of Sydney handles all transactions and receipts for your donation. For Australian donors, gifts before the 30th of June are tax deductible for this financial year.

Kindest regards,

Dr. Mark Allon
Prof Paul Harrison
