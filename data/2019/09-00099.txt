Dear Madhav,

Thank you for posting this article. I found it very interesting, having thought about this 
problem myself without having your erudition to think about it so clearly.

Apart from the purely linguistic arguments, your suggestion that Panini thinks in terms of 
desire because that's the way ritual theory works is very interesting. Staal would no doubt 
have agreed -- did he comment on it?

I also derive great pleasure from your Krishna verses, and share selected ones with mytwo 
ISKCON students.

With best wishes,

Dermot

    Dear Oliver, 

    You may find discussions by grammarians on semantic sub-types of Karman useful in 
    this respect. Works from Bhartrhari's Vakyapadiya to Kauabhaa's 
    Vaiyakaraa-Bhuaa and Nage?sa's Laghuma?jua discuss these sub-types. The 
    discussions on verb semantics classifying verbs into kartrstha-kriyaka versus 
    karmastha-kriyaka and kartrstha-bhavaka versus karmastha-bhavaka may also provide 
    some clues. I have discussed the effects of some semantic sub-types of Karman 
    [affected versus non-affected] in the syntax of passives of dvikarmaka verbs. You can 
    see this in a sentence like aja grama nayati > aja grama niyate; but not aja 
    grama niyate. On the other hand, grama gacchati can be passivized as grama 
    gamyate. So grama in relation to nayati and gacchati seems to have a somewhat 
    different perception. With respect to nayati, it may be more or less adverbial as you 
    say. On the other hand, with respect to gacchati, it has some closer semantic 
    connection. This looks like a great topic for deeper introspection. Perhaps Hans Hock 
    and George Cardona could add to this discussion. With best wishes,

    Madhav

    Dear all,
    
    this question probably has an obvious answer, but I don't find it:
    Let's say we have a sentence like rAmo vanaM pravizati, where the acc.
    vanam expresses the goal of a motion verb.
    
    Are there any papers or any clues from the grammatical tradition that
    could tell if the accusative vanam was "felt" like a real object in
    actual language use (as the sun in "I see the sun"), or rather
    considered as some kind of adverbial non-core argument to the verb?
    
    Any hint is highly appreciated.
    
    Best, Oliver
