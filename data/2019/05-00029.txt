It is not much. but on the last page of my article "The Structure of K?lid?sa's Raghuva??a" (Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik 15 (1989), pp.151-158) I also say something about the Kum?rasa?bhava. A pdf of the article can be found on my website. For a study of the Mah?k?vya genre, of which the KS is a fine example, see my article "On Beginnings: Introductions and Prefaces in K?vya", in Bronner, Shulman and Tubb (eds.). Innovations and Turning Points ..., Oxford 2014, pp. 86 ff, pdf on my website.

Dear Colleagues,

I would appreciate references to studies of Kalidasa?s Kumarasambhava. I am aware of work by Gary Tubb, David Smith, Ayal Amer, Martina Jackmuth, and contributions (though not pointed studies) by Daniel Ingalls, Yigal Bronner, David Shulman, and Edwin Gerow. Is Prof. Tubb?s dissertation, "The Kuma?rasam?bhava in the light of Indian theories of the Maha?ka?vya" available? Proquest/UMI seems not to have a master from which to order a copy.

Many thanks,
