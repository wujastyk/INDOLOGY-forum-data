[INDOLOGY] [Archiving Open Access publications] Re: question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Krishnaprasad makes a crucial point, I think, when he says that his own
business is structured as a charity or non-profit organization.
I worked for many years for the Wellcome Trust in London (that owns and
runs the Wellcome Library that has thousands of Indic manuscripts).  I have
seen at first hand how a charitable trust can own and run a pharmaceutical
company (the Wellcome Foundation, later sold to Smith-Kline Beecham), and
own major investments (the Wellome Trust owns large tracts of London) and
how all the considerable profits from that can be funnelled into regulated
charitable goals such as education and research.  In my opinion, most major
corporate bodies that are today viewed as for-profit entities should be
re-structured as charities, including all medical facilities, hospitals,
prisons, schools, universities, religious organizations, orchestras, etc.
etc. This sounds utopian.  It would be nice to live in a utopia.
