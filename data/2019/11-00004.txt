[INDOLOGY] The alphabet found in the Lalitavistara
Dear Madhav,
If you do a search of the Muktabodha digital library searchable etexts
collection   for ak?r?dik?ak?r?nta  you will find many references to
the letters from a to k?a in about 40 different tantric texts.
 In the search etexts field you need to type in Kyoto-Harvard
transliteration between angle brackets i.e. <akArAdikSakArAnta>
Best wishes,
Harry Spier
