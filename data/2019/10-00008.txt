etc. From a very technical point of view, the work of the editors
consisted of selecting preexisting text, choosing what to print, and
printing that. (Again, please, I'm not saying that is what we really
do, but I'm saying from the point of view of law about creativity this
seems to me the way it would be seen).
Anyway, thanks in part to the inspiration of Dominik I have been
making efforts as far as i am able to present all my own work in Open
Access form (but I have tenure and don't have to worry about being
judged, I know this). One example: the edition of the
Pra?nottararatnam?lik? I recently published in the IIJ is Open Access
(but actually I try to post all my own stuff online anyway... And I do
not plan to publish any scholarly book in the future that is not Open
Access.)
