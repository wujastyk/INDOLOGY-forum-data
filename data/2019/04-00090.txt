[INDOLOGY] question
See Sternbach's Mah?subh??itasa?graha, vol. I, no. 575:
atiparicay?d avaj??
sa?tatagaman?d an?daro bhavati |
malaye bhillapurandhr?
candanatarum indhana? kurute ||
(with textual variants and sources)
Excessive familiarity breeds contempt, and too frequent visits (to a person) lead to disrespect.
A Bhilla woman [or: a woman-beggar] living on the Malaya Mountain uses sandal-wood as a mere fuel.
Best,
Lubomir
