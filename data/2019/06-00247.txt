[INDOLOGY] Indology discussions
Dear all,
Without reference to the content of anyone's posts - political, a-politcal, civil, uncivil, left, right or out of the ballpark -- I do wish that the list's rules might include an anti-logorrhea clause. It may seem a self-contradiction to repeat it, but I will: alam ativistareNa.
