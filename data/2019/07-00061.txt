Dear colleagues,

Would anyone happen to have a soft copy of the following?

? Para?ur?makalpas?tra with the commentary (-v?rtti, Saubh?gyodaya) of R?me?vara, ed. A. Mahadeva Sastri, rev. and enl. Sakarlal Yajneswar Sastri Dave. Gaekwad?s Oriental Series 22. Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1950. [NB it?s the revised edition of 1950 I?m after, not the original 1923 ed.]

I?ve tried archive.org and the dli with no luck.

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim
