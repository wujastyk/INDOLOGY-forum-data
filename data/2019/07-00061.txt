[INDOLOGY] Request for edition pdfs
Dear colleagues,
Would anyone happen to have a soft copy of the following?
? Para?ur?makalpas?tra with the commentary (-v?rtti, Saubh?gyodaya) of R?me?vara, ed. A. Mahadeva Sastri, rev. and enl. Sakarlal Yajneswar Sastri Dave. Gaekwad?s Oriental Series 22. Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1950. [NB it?s the revised edition of 1950 I?m after, not the original 1923 ed.]
