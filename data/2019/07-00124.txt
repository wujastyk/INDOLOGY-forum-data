[INDOLOGY] grammar question
Dear Dr. Paturi,
On ek?nnavi??ati = nineteen, see P??ini, A???dhy?y?, 6.3.76 (ek?di? caikasya c?duk).
Dear Dr. Patte,
I don't understand your passage, but rather doubt that it can be explained in the light of how the word ek?nnavi??ati is formed. Since the proper ablative of eka is ekasm?t, I don't think ek?nnavi??ati is to be analyzed in the way you imagine. (Alas I don't understand the commentaries on A??. 6.3.76 well enough to be able to to tell how the word ek?nnavi??ati is traditionally explained.)
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
