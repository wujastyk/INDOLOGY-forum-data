Dear Matthew,
Apart from the direction of evolution/emanation (by and large I agree here
with Viktoria), another, closely related problem is a (supposed)
'confusion' between 'cosmology' and 'psychology' that has puzzled modern
students of S??khya. Here is a quotation from an article of mine touching
on this problem -- especially because of the references to and discussion
with Eli Franco and Johannes Bronkhorst which this quotation implies:
?If it is recognized that the range of rationality remains always limited
and can neither dispell all irrationality from the perceptual foundations
of knowledge, nor that of inherited or adopted conceptual schemes as
fundaments of thinking, the association or ?confusion? of ?cosmology? and
?psychology? to which Franco and Bronkhorst have recently drawn our
attention, but which troubled already the first Indologists who dealt with
S??khya (Max M?ller 1899: 294), may be regarded as primarily a matter of
*perception* ? a perception of man and the cosmos as one or homologous, a
perception which much of early South Asian myth and ritualism seem to
reflect and foster ? rather than a matter of deviant or defective
*reasoning*. Attempts in the ?second flourishing? of S??khya and especially
those of Vij??nabhik?u to reorder this ?confused? perception, cited by
Bronkhorst (1997a, ms. p. 11) as showing that the confusion was indeed
there, could then be attributed to a different world perception or world
conceptualization rather than to an increase of rationality.?
??Verschriftlichung' and the relation between the *pram??a*s in the history
of S??khya.? *?tudes de Lettres* 2001.3: *La rationalit? en Asie /
Rationality in Asia*: 165-194.
p. 180-181
So what is your theory?
