[INDOLOGY] The Mirror in Vedic India: Its ancient use and present relevance in dating texts
Dear Nagaraj,
I do mention in my paper that high tin bronze mirrors were made in India already in the Indus Civilization, and that the technique was known in South India in early first millennium BCE.  But the complete absence of any reference to mirrors in the Sa?hit?, Br?hma?a, ?ra?yaka and ?rautas?tra literature (excepting the Upani?ads later added to the ?B and the ?gvedic ?ra?yakas and the late K?S) very strongly suggests that the mirror was not know in early Vedic times in North India.
With best regards, ?Asok"
