[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
There is maybe some parallel with what Renou Gram. p. 46 ?41c (dealing with the sandhi of final -e/-o + vowels) notes about the "hiatus de a (issu du nomin. a? des th?mes en -a) devant initiale a- suivie de deux consonnes dans un texte bouddh[ique]", referring to Pischel SBBerl. 1904, p. 812, here:

ekac?varaka asth?t instead of ekac?varako 'sth?t
p???a avy?k?tam instead of p???o 'vy?k?tam
I mean (in asya) the presence of the two consonants following the initial a, which lenghtens the syllabe, and makes the initial a pronounced long, resulting in the fact that the final e here conforms with the "general" rule (becoming a(y) when followed by any vowel, except a, or diphtongue).
Conversely, the two consonants following a ? can make it considered as short, as Renou notes ibid. with the (mainly epic) occurrences of -o/-e  'tman for -a ?tman.

I have a question for the vaiy?kara?as among us (who may find it very basic, in which case I apologize in advance):
In the T?jikayogasudh?nidhi of Y?davas?ri (fl. possibly early 17th century, possibly in or near Gujarat) there occurs the following stanza (12.15), the form of which is corroborated by several independent witnesses:
janmalagnapatir uttamav?ryo yadg?he janu?i tatra ca d???e |
tena v? sahita asya ca labdhis tad yath??gasukham abdatanau sy?t ||
(As the meaning is quite technical, I give my translation: 'If the house in which the ruler of the ascendant of the nativity is [placed] with excellent strength in the nativity is aspected or joined by that [ruler, there is] attainment of [the matter signified by] that [house]: for example, [if it is placed] in the ascendant of the year, there will be pleasures of the body.')
