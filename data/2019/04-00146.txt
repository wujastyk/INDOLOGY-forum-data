[INDOLOGY] Transmission of sanskrit grammatical concepts/terminology to Europe
Dear Adriano,
Apart from Frits Staal's *A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians* (Cambridge,
MIT 1972), one could mention among many other publications Staal's *Universals:
Studies in Indian logic and linguistics* (Chicago 1988), and Prof. Rosane
Rocher's *La Th?orie des voix du verbe dans l'?cole p??in?enne* (Bruxelles
1968) and her "The concept of the verbal root in Indian grammar" in
*Foundations
of Language* 5, pp. 73-82.
In a forthcoming volume ed. by Axel Michaels and Christoph Wulf
(proceedings of the Delhi 2015 conference on "Scientification and Scientism
in the Humanities"), I contributed an article "The Art of Grammar"
discussing the 'scientification' in the reception of the Sanskrit
grammatical knowledge system in Europe and in modern linguistics, and
observed, *inter alia*:
"On the rules, skilfully formulated by several generations of grammarians
up to P??ini, a formalism was superimposed and finally brought to
perfection by P??ini. Behind it, the skilful and even artful choices of
description all but disappeared except to the discerning eye of a few
critical thinkers, including the earliest great grammarian-philosopher in
the P??inian tradition, Bhart?hari (fifth century CE), who at a few
occasions emphasised the ?arbitrariness? of the descriptive choices. The
formalism is, moreover, not everywhere equally strict and becomes even
occasionally sketchy where the archaic language of the Vedic texts is
concerned (Thieme 1935). In contrast, in the Greek and Hellenic worlds the
grammar of Dionysius Thrax (second century BC), which was indeed much less
profound in its linguistic analysis ? no concept of the verbal root, for
instance, had ever been applied to the ancient Greek language until this
was done by Franz Bopp and other linguists of the 19th century inspired by
the dh?tu of Sanskrit grammarians ? and which lacked the formal
sophistication of P??ini, did not hide its nature as an art, and was known
under the title of Art of Grammar, the ????? ?????????? (Kemp 1986; Law &
Sluiter 1995)."
