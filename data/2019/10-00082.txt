As far as I know there is no schism. After the older brother died, Rajeev Jain took over. I had dinner with all the brothers two years ago. I think part of the business has mover to Daryaganj. If some thing has happened in the last year or so, I am not aware.

Dear Friends,

A colleague has asked me a question about Motilal Banarsidass. Has there been a schism that has led to two the existence of two different businesses, one called Motilal Banarsidass Publishers in Jawahar Nagar and the other called Motilal Banarsidass Publications in Daryaganj? If so, what is the exact relationship between these two businesses?

It also appears that the old website (www.mlbd.com<http://www.mlbd.com/>) is no longer functioning.

Any light that might be shed on this confusing matter would be very welcome. Feel free to contact me off list if you prefer.

With best wishes,
Andrew
