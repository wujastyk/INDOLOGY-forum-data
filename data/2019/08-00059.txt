The other option for Windows users that does not require any 3rd party tools or other hacks and doesn?t interfere with keyboard shortcuts is to create your own keyboard layout using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339> . I took the layout I usually use and added some combining diacritics, but you can use precomposed characters if preferred. Another advantage of this solution is that you might be able to get the IT to deploy your keyboard to the department.

 

For people who are using their custom shortcuts, would they mind sharing which shortcuts they use for which characters?

 

Best regards,

Jan

If you like to use Unicode-letters for all Windows-apps incl. Explorer, Firefox etc.:

Write a small exe-file with the (free) AutoHotkey-app and copy this exe-file into the Autostart-folder of Windows.

It is really very easy: You just write a list assigning unicode-letters to any keyshortcut you like.

Best

Dear Anya, 

For Word on Windows you can define shortcut keys. Just go to the insert symbols menu and press "shorcut key" and then define what you want for letters with diacriticals.  I used Alt + the character for diacritical under the letter and ctrl+ the character for diacritical above the letter.  Alt+ctrl + the character if there is a diacritical above and below the character, and a few others for the nasals.

Dear all,

 

In addition to James Hartzell's question regarding EasyUnicode for ipad, I would ask if there is a way to use this keyboard layout on a non-Mac computer.

 

Many thanks!

Anya
