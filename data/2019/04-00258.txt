[INDOLOGY] suggestions?
Dear Madhav,
There is a good, clear book by Swami Tapasyananda from Advaita Ashrama called Bhakti Schools of Ved?nta. ?It nicely lays out the various non-Advaitic interpretations of the prasth?natray?. ?It does not get to the level of detail of the padacchedas, but is a good introduction to the varied interpretations to which these texts have been subject.
I hope this is helpful!
All the best,Jeff

Dear Madhav,
I recall that Arvind Sharma once wrote a book entitled "The Hindu Gita"
that explored the various commentarial traditions.
https://www.amazon.com/Hindu-Gita-Classical-Interpretations-Bhagavadgita/dp/0812690133
However, I haven't looked at it for at least 20 years and I do not recall it well enough to say whether it may clarify the question you are raising. Its
primary concern is to introduce the philosophical standpoint of the different commentators.
Another work that juxtaposes aspects of the content of the Sankara and Ramanuja commentaries Is Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad's
https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Self-Human-V-PUBLISHERS/dp/9386606364/ref=dp_ob_title_bk
But I am not at all sure that either of these titles addresses directly the issue of varying padacchedas.
It is possible that Van Buitenen's book on the Ramanuja commentary on the Gita may be worth consulting as well.
best,
Matthew

[INDOLOGY] suggestions??I am looking for some English language book or article that discusses how passages from the Bhagavadg?t? or Upani?ads have been subjected to multiplepadacchedas?and interpretations by different commentators.? I have most of the Sanskrit commentaries, but I need to provide some reading materials for a few readers who are interested in this phenomenon, but don't read Sanskrit commentaries.? Any suggestions?
