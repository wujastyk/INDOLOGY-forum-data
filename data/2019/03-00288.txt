[INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Apologies for being unable to keep out of this, but Birgit and I have
discussed this earlier in another context, so I thought I'd chime in: there
are serious discussions underway in Europe about alternatives to the
presently proposed Project S scheme. However, all of those I have heard
about deal only with European publication outlets (and I'm not sure how
something like the EFEO fits in, I admit), but this still leaves the threat
of a significant divide between EU and non-EU scholars, or better put,
EU-funded and non-EU-funded scholarship.
We should recall here also that some journals published by societies will
publish only if the author is a member of the society (I recall this from
years ago when I had to join the AAR to publish a paper) and this too is a
form of an author-paying model. I think it is important that all of us
think about what we want to do ourselves to assure maximum visibililty for
scholarship, on the one hand, but also to realize that we are less than
marginal players in a game run by the hard sciences, and for the moment, we
can think as much as we like, but it would perhaps be more economical to
wait and see how things shake out before investing too much time and energy
in our own solutions, which are unlikely to be of interest to those who are
actually making the rules. I'm not saying give up, just that things are
extremely fluid right now, and waiting is likely to be a wise policy.
