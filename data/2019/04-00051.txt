[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Birgit and All,
To clarify - I am not advocating an expansion of the committee's job in
regulating INDOLOGY. I am suggesting measures designed to prevent what I
have experienced, internally on the committee, from happening again, to me
or to anybody else. Inappropriate, biased behavior can occur anywhere, even
on a committee with a limited function.
I understand the point about not having all sides of the story. I would
gently point out - Nobody on this list needs to adjudicate the past in
order to advocate some basic checks on potential bias and abuse going
forward. Given that most of us agree that bias is a significant issue
throughout our discipline and the academy, I think we should all be in
favor of basic measures to prevent and address it here.
