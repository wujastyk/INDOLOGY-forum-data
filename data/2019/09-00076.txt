[INDOLOGY] Out-of-body experience in Indian religions
Thank you all for the very swift and helpful replies I have received 
both on- and off-list! I will go through the sources you have mentioned 
with my colleague and see whether they fit into her working definition 
of OBE (which I believe is quite loose for the time being).
With best wishes,
Jessie
