Dear Colleagues,
This is a message on behalf of the venerable Bhik?u Zhihan, president of the Fundaci?n Bodhiy?na (Buenos Aires), to inform those of us who may not have heard the news yet, that Dr. Carmen Dragonetti (b. 1937) passed away on December 1st, 2018, following the passing of her husband Dr. Fernando Tola (b. 1915) the previous year (2017).
Dr Tola and Dragonetti's Fundaci?n Instituto de Estudios Budistas (FIEB), with its extensive collection of Buddhist texts and secondary literature, is now effectively under the management of the Fundaci?n Bodhiy?na. At present, they are still in the process of finding a permanent home for the?library collection in central Buenos Aires, intending to make it available to the general public, students and scholars in the near future.
With kind regards,
Bhikkhun? Dhammadinn?
