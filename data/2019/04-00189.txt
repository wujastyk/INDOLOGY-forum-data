An off-list reply made me realize I wasn't as clear in formulating my 
question as I should have been: I am primarily interested in the epithet 
mah?prabhu used as a title for historical persons (rulers and/or holy 
men), or possibly local/regional deities (such as Jagann?tha). The late 
medieval to early modern period would be particularly relevant.
Best wishes,
Martin
