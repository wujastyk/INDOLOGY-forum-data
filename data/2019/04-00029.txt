[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
There is a great deal to say and think about all this. But I will keep my
remarks brief:
1. Given the current membership of the Indology group (at least measured in
terms of those who reply), not unlike the United States Senate (to name but
one institution), men are here making decisions that deeply affect women.
2. Related to this, how many men and how many women are members of
Indology? (By the way, I can think of at least four excellent
Sanskritists, who are women, who I am fairly certain are not members of
this forum; why have more women not joined?)
3. Audrey's note has generated more discussion than I remember seeing on
this list in a very long time. Perhaps we should look at the matters we
tend to discuss here (which these days is largely confined to "Does anyone
have an electronic copy of...?), and begin thinking about the broader
issues that affect us as scholars (I would put Audrey's charge prominently
in this category).
