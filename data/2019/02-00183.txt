Dear Harry,

PW was published in 1855?75, so it could not use Roy's edition published in 1883?1896.

PW references to MBh are to the first complete edition prepared by Bengali pandits in Calcutta and published by various publishers in 1834-39 in four volumes. This edition counts verses continuously within each parvan. Although Roy's edition is based on it, it is different. Roy has used another Bengali edition (1863, so called Burdwan edition) and several manuscripts.

So to identify a particular verse quoted in PW, one have to look in the original Calcutta edition (1834-39).

Best,
Lubomir
