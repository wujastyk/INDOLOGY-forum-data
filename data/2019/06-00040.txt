[INDOLOGY] Tamil pronunciation
As  a non-dravidist:
 ????????????? is a compound, two elements:  t?vu (s. dv?pa) -
'island' and k???am
- 'aggregation'.
In ???? the first -k (??) does belongs neither to t?vu nor to k???am. In
writing it marks then the 'space' linking two separate words into one
compound. Is it pronounced? Or simply  left out?
