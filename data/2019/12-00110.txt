Subject: [INDOLOGY] 'catching the ocean in a cow's hoofprint'
In-Reply-To: <YTOPR0101MB119488EE770D5B21F36B9EFEEB2E0@YTOPR0101MB1194.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Probably based on the story of Agastya drinking up the ocean, there is a
proverb in Telugu that means 'taking in the ocean for a sip in a palm.'

It is used in a similar context of taking control of vast knowledge.
