Dear Andrew,

I have so far only used the cut and paste method and published only one table produced by relatively primitive methods (http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jbs/summary/v019/19.2.griffiths.html).

With my students in Paris, I am soon going to start experimenting with use of this system: <http://archetype.ink/#about>. If something useful comes out of it, I'll send another post to the list.

Best wishes,

Arlo

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Script tables

Dear list members,

I was wondering whether anyone has experience drawing up "script tables," representing the characters used either in a given document (say a manuscript or inscription) or in a collection of documents. I realize that a lot depends on whether the table will be printed or published online (e.g., the use of color images), but I'm interested in recommendations for producing suitable images. (I'm aware of the very useful charts, adapted from B?hler?s Indische Palaeographie, that D?niel Balogh posted on this list some time ago.)

Andrew
