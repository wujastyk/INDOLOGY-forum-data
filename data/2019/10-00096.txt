Subject: [INDOLOGY] Interpolation in Ramayana, Mahabharata etc.
Message-ID: <CAHuz+CoPiejxCGkf=RYMYcHfeUcJ-0N0wjSMHvM=kw92xEVS-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

Namaste!

Please see if you could respond to Professor Bhattacharya's query below
(who I've marked a copy to).

''Do you know any Sanskritist well versed in the tenets of textual
criticism? My question is: Are the long Additional Passages in the critical
editions of the Harivamza, Mahabharata, RamayaNa, etc. to be treated as
interpolations or not''.




With regards,
Sincerely yours,
