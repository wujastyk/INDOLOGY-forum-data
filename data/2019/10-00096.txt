[INDOLOGY] Interpolation in Ramayana, Mahabharata etc.
Dear list,
Namaste!
Please see if you could respond to Professor Bhattacharya's query below
(who I've marked a copy to).
''Do you know any Sanskritist well versed in the tenets of textual
criticism? My question is: Are the long Additional Passages in the critical
editions of the Harivamza, Mahabharata, RamayaNa, etc. to be treated as
interpolations or not''.
With regards,
Sincerely yours,
