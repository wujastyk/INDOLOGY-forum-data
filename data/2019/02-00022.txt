Dear colleagues,
I am encountering the expression "m?rv?? k??h?" (sometimes rendered as 
"m?rv?? (k??h?)") in the colophons of a group of Rajasthani cloth 
paintings (dated 17-19th century, but probably modern forgeries). I 
suppose that the meaning is something along the lines of "the region of 
Marwar," but the only definitions of k??h? I have been able to find are 
"a measure of length" and "a measure of land of 320 square cubits."
The situation is slightly complicated by a colophon which reads "ma?h 
h?ra? mulk m?rv?? k??h?," indicating Saran Math in the region (mulk) of 
Marwar. Should k??h? be understood as synonymous with mulk, or do they 
express separate definitions of territory?
Any help would be much appreciated.
Best regards,
Jacob
