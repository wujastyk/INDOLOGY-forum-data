?nanda, the paradigmatic Jain layman who is the subject of the first
section of the ?vet?mbara canonical text the Up?sakada???, is characterised
by his extreme wealth or rather by his possession of money in the form of
gold pieces: 120 million of them to be exact. ?nanda?s possession of such a
large amount of money makes his eventual renunciation all the more
impressive. In Jainism there is a symbiosis between wealth and
renunciation. This paper seeks to explore this symbiosis in the light of
theoretical approaches to the sociology of money. The forms of money are
protean; they range from ?nanda?s tangible money in the shape of coins with
a positive intrinsic value to today?s largely invisible money, which
depends on a negative concept, debt, for its value. The paper will attempt
to survey the interface between Jain ethical values and money in its
various forms.
