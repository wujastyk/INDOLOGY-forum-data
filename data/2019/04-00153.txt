[INDOLOGY] Colour symbolism in pre-modern Indic sources; concise overview of the senses
Students are asking me for readings for their essays, and I'm slightly
stumped for good suggestions on these two.  Can anyone point to some good
studies of these topics?
I am particularly interested in colour readings in relation to the health
sciences and alchemy, but anything will do!  I know about Martha Selby's
2005 "Narratives of Conception" article and its remarks on red/white
distinctions in ayurveda.
Regarding the senses, I haven't yet checked the Brill encyclopedia, and I
will.  Probably there's something in Dasgupta, Hist. Indi. Philosophy.
Any suggestions will be much appreciated.
Best,
Dominik
