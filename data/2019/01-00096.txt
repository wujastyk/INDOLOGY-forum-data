Dear Sellmer,
I think you're in the right track. The name of the siddha in Bangla is C
aura?g? . What is now the Esplanade area in central Kolkata was previously
known as Caura?g? (distorted to Chauringhee). The main road that connects
central Kolkata and south Kolkata was originally known as Caura?g? or
Chauringhee Road. It has been renamed Jawaharlal Nehru Road or Sarani.
There is a brief life-sketch of this siddha in the
*Caturas'iti-siddha-prav.ritti*.  In the Bangla translation the name is
spelt Caura?ga.
Yours collegially,
Ramkrishna Bhattacharya,
3, Mohanlal Street, Kolkata 700 004, India.
