[INDOLOGY] Greek accent
Someone asked me if Greek verb accent has the prosodic loss of accent, if
it comes after a non-verb, like the Sanskrit verb accent [cf. P??ini: ????
????:]?  I have only secondary knowledge about Greek, and could not answer
this question.  Hope someone can clarify this issue to me.  Best,
