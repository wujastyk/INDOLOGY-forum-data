[INDOLOGY] [Archiving Open Access publications] Re: question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Dear colleagues, 
The uploading and preparing books and articles for the use of others is a good thing. But it should coincide with ethic behaviour of users. Everyone wants every information on his/her desk and more often than not an author finds his researched results in transformed form or in summaries in articles of others - without mentioning a source. It is one thing to contribute to a common pool of knowledge it?s another to become quary for other people?s blocs. But this you all know. My further point is: one should not cursorily speak about open source and uploading disregarding the tremendous work it affords preparing material. Open source is ok for older publications but contemporary contributions should be put into the free will of the authors without stigmatizing them as protective.
