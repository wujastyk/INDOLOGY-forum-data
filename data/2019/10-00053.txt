[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear Dr Hartzell,
The introductory verses to Candrananda?s commentary on the A????gah?dayasa?hit??call the text?Pad?rthacandrik? (not?Am?tah?daya A????ga Guhyopade?atantra ?!). See ?[?] pad?rthacandrik?? ??k?? [?] kari?y?mi ???
As far as I am aware, the assumed date of the Tibetan translation provides, indeed, the earliest terminus ante quem, but, as to now, one could not find any evidence to determine the terminus post quem?? that is, the TPQ is given merely by the composition of the root text.
I heard from several scholars in India that they thought Candrananda hailed from Kashmir. I am not sure about the rationale behind this belief, but I guess that it is influenced by the Tibetan tradition. As for Sanskrit sources,?someone Candrananda?(the?Pad?rthacandrik??has not been published in its entirety yet, so we still don?t know if it?s the same Candra or not)?is often quoted by K??rasv?min (fl. ca. 11th cent.) in his commentary on the Amarako?a,?and one can also establish that Candra?s text exhibited significant influence on Indu?(fl. ca. 12th cent.). Both authors were most likely from Kashmir, which may supply some very weak evidence for connecting Candra with this region.
best,
Andrey
