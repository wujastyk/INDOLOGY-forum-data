[INDOLOGY] Skt./Pkt. prose word order
Dear Colleague,
You might also take a look at the attached document ?ChronologyGenre", which deals with the issue of word order differences in different genres of Sanskrit. A second attachment is a broader survey on Sanskrit syntax, which also addresses issues of word order.
With all best wishes,
Hans Henrich Hock
