Dear Colleague,

You might also take a look at the attached document ?ChronologyGenre", which deals with the issue of word order differences in different genres of Sanskrit. A second attachment is a broader survey on Sanskrit syntax, which also addresses issues of word order.

With all best wishes,

Hans Henrich Hock

The studies by Aklujkar (1996), Apte (1885), Gillon (1995 and 1996), Thite (1984), and Thommen (1903) seem especially promising. It will take some time to go through them in detail ..
