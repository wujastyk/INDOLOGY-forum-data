[INDOLOGY] Indian Sculpture
Friends:
I am working on Indian Sculpture and am wondering whether there is any writing on the aesthetics of different stones in India.
For example central Indian stone as in Khajuraho is so different from the black stone of Bengal and each has its own aesthetics.
Kind regards,
