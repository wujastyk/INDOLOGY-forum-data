Yes, dh?man is cognate with doom.  But the question was about dharma, which is quite unrelated, despite the partial convergence in meanings.

What is dhaman = law here?
https://www.etymonline.com/word/doom
doom (n.)

Middle English doome, from Old English dom "a law, statute, decree; administration of justice, judgment; justice, equity, righteousness," from Proto-Germanic *domaz (source also of Old Saxon and Old Frisian dom, Old Norse domr, Old High German tuom "judgment, decree," Gothic doms"discernment, distinction"), perhaps from PIE root *dhe-<https://www.etymonline.com/word/*dhe-?ref=etymonline_crossreference> "to set, place, put, do" (source also of Sanskrit dhaman- "law," Greek themis "law," Lithuanian dom? "attention").

Originally in a neutral sense but sometimes also "a decision determining fate or fortune, irrevocable destiny." A book of laws in Old English was a dombec. Modern adverse sense of "fate, ruin, destruction" begins early 14c. and is general after c. 1600, from doomsday<https://www.etymonline.com/word/doomsday?ref=etymonline_crossreference> and the finality of the Christian Judgment. Crack of doom is the last trump, the signal for the dissolution of all things.

doom (v.)

late 14c., domen, "to judge, pass judgment on," from doom<https://www.etymonline.com/word/doom?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_13942> (n.). The Old English word was deman, which became deem<https://www.etymonline.com/word/deem?ref=etymonline_crossreference>. Meaning "condemn (to punishment), pronounce adverse judgment upon" is from c. 1600. Related: Doomed; dooming.

Dear colleagues,

Can anyone comment on the etymological link (if any) between the word "doom" and the word "dharma"?

Thanks in advance ...
