[INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Dear Arlo and others,
I have reviewed an article for Religions and know some colleagues who  
have published in it. While this journal is not to be confused with  
the more well-established Religion, it has come out for almost ten  
years by now and follows standard rules for academic publishing. It  
has a 1 on the Finnish scale of academic publications (0-3) which is  
not great but standard for such a newly established journal. I think  
it ranks similarly in other countries.
Article processing charges (AFC) are getting more and more common, as  
a side-effect of the move towards open access publishing. As  
publishers less and less can live on income from readers, getting the  
money from authors (=their institutions) is a natural alternative.  
This is by no means unproblematic, as it makes it difficult for  
scholars unaffiliated with rich (=Western) institutions to publish,  
etc. Nevertheless, I am editing a (gold standard) open access journal  
myself (Temenos) so I know that even when journals are not geared  
towards profit and editors get no money for their work, it still costs  
to bring out high-quality journals, even when they are online only. In  
our case, we have external funding, but not all journals are so  
fortunate.
Sincerely yours,
M?ns
