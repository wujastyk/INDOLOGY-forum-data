Subject: [INDOLOGY] Supporting each other in public
In-Reply-To: <CALOY_zFV_ow70-2OMES4f=t_baWpe5qNUzHT9VPyQoCsMC-vHg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Koenraad,

I usually try to read your emails all the way through, even though their
length does not invite that. (Which, by the way, also is a well-known
technique: just put something very long and mostly undigested in front of
others, so that they have to spend the time and energy to work their way
through it and perhaps even feel they need to respond to it all.)

With your last email, I just made it to the words 'Patricia's screaming
tirade' to know I didn't have to go on reading.

Dominik, thank you for your email. You are absolutely right that it isn't
enough to voice our support for others privately; but we need to do it in
public on-list. I would thus hereby like to voice my public support to
Patricia and everyone who has spoken up, in detail but never lenghtily,
about AAIS.

While I don't think that further discussion of AAIS is *needed* to show the
true colours of the organisation, one brief observation on AJIS made by a
friend not on this list may still be of interest:

"I note that in the few instances when the terms ?Muslim? and ?Islam?
appear on the website or in the journal that they serve merely as markers
of difference with ?Hindus? and ?Hinduism,? and ?Islamic civilization? is
pointedly juxtaposed with ?Indic civilization"."

Finally, I support any initiatives there may be for amending the guidelines
of the Indology list, especially as concerns explicit prohibition of
gaslighting and dog-whistling. This list is a valuable (and invaluable!)
resource for all of us, and we should not allow it, or our field, to be
used by any person or organisation that aims to sow unacademic dissent
among countries, religions or individuals.

All the best,
      Antonia
