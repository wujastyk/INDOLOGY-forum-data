[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear colleagues,
I have been following the thread, but like Professor Falk and Dr Oranskaia,
I remain entirely puzzled regarding what the complaint specific to the
Indology list was about. I am not of course refering to the wider issue of
sexism and bias in society generally. Given the amount of comment this
topic has received, clarification would be most welcome.
Best regards, Matthew Clark (SOAS)
