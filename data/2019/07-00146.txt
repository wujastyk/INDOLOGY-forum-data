[INDOLOGY] On-line manuscript library
Thanks for bringing attention to the indology website page. Thats also
something I haven't looked at in years.
Is this DAV College collection a first where you have both the manuscript
image and a transcription  with the image(at least for some).?  I see from
the website that they are planning to transcribe all the manuscripts.
