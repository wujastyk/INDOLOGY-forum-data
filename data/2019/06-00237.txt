[INDOLOGY] Supporting each other in public
I just want to take up your point about Copernicus.  It's just as well that
you don't want to compare yourself with him: his *De revolutionibus orbium
coelestium* was published in the year of his death.  Copernicus did not
live to experience the reception of his work in the way you suggest.  He's
a bad example for your arguments for other reasons too, since successors
like Brahe accepted his mathematics without accepting his physical model of
the solar system.  This is valid, incidentally: the mathematics of Ptolemy
works rather well as a predictive model for planetary and celestial
predictions.
