there are also examples combining two nouns, at least in Buddhist
texts. BHSD has

  phal?phala ?all manner of fruits?

(so also in Pali).

A first?century?CE G?ndh?r? commentary that I am working on

   https://gandhari.org/a_manuscript.php?catid=CKM0005

in discussing a variant of the Pali verse

   parovar? yassa samecca dhamm?
   vidh?pit? atthagat? na santi
   sa vedag? vusitabrahmacariyo
   lokantag? p?ragato ti vucati

(AN II 6.19?23) that can be reconstructed as follows

   ?bhavabhava? (yas?a sameca) ?dharma?
   ?vidhuvida? ?astagada na sati?
   ?sa vedago? ?vu??idavo bramacarya?
   ?log??atao? ?paragado? (di vucadi)

explains the first word as follows:

   *bhavabhava* ? ?bhava? bhava ceva vuta bhavati ? yas?a
   phalaphala phala phala ceva vucati

   ?*bhavabhava*: existences and more existences are spoken of,
   like (in the case of) phalaphala: fruits and more fruits are
   spoken of.?

All best,
Stefan
