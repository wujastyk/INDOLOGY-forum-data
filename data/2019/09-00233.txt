[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
May I put in a word for the Saundaryalahar?, traditionally attributed to ?a?kara, though probably later than his time? It?s a lovely poem, and also an important document for the development of ??kta devotion and Tantra. W. Norman Brown?s edition and translation, which includes manuscript illustrations, is a treasure in itself.
