[INDOLOGY] Question
Here?s my take, Madhav; I hope it?s helpful
The crux seems to be ?vidh?t. While most dictionaries, following Monier Williams, give meanings like ?drill?, the addenda to the Petersburg dictionary (at http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/6_sres/2_dict/schnzsw_u.htm) add the meaning udreka, i.e. ?abundance? etc.
With this meaning the line can be interpreted as varcasvam ?yu?yam ?rogyam (subject), ?vidh?t (ablative) ?on account of abundance?, sobham?nam (quasi-predicate participle) ?shining, beautiful?, mah?yate ?prospers, is exalted'
All the best,
Hans/Hans Henrich
