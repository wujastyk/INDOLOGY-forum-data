[INDOLOGY] Hobson Jobson Dictionary
Dear list members,
Is there an edition/reprint of the Hobson Jobson dictionary you would
recommend above all others?
I am interested in acquiring a hard copy of it.
I see that in 2013 a *selected edition* appeared, edited by Kate Teltscher,
but I would like to get hold of an *unabridged* one.
NB: I am aware of the online resource that is hosted on the website of the
University of Chicago as well as of the existence of a freely available
pdf, but I am actually in search of an old-style book.
I shall be grateful for any tips.
With best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
