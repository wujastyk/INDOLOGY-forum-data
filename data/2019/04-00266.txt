Dear Greg,

Apte has also this word (kandhi?: The ocean -f. The neck ) and he adds an interesting definition: "ka? ?iro jala? v? dh?yate 'tra" (see also the previous entries: kandha?: a cloud, and kandhara?: 1. the neck, 2. 'the holder of water', a cloud).

This definition apparently comes either from the V?caspatyam (ka? ?irojala? v? dh?yate 'tra ?dh?re ki; vol. 7, p. 1650, Calcutta ed.) or the ?abdakalpadruma (ka? ?ira? samudrapak?e jala? dhriyate yatra; vol. 2, p. 21, Chaukhambha reprint). 

V?caspatyam and ?abdakalpadruma also quote their source: R?janirgha??a? (= R?janigha??u =  Abhidh?nac???ma?i = Nigha??ur?ja). But this is again a lexicon, so it does not help much. Anyway, it might be useful to look at it (it was published in 1896, ASS 33).

The Oriya Lexicon (vol. 2, p. 1303) has the word 'kandhi' and gives two meanings: 1. shoulder, 2. ocean, the sea. But I do not know whether it also takes this word from some Sanskrit lexicon, or whether it is indeed used in Oriya text(s).

Best,
Lubomir

The latter part of the compound is common everywhere, but has anybody seen ka(?)dhi used in the meaning of ?sea? or with any meaning. MW gives ka?dhi as referring to sea, but provides no references. BR gives it as Meer (dam Wasser) + dhi haltend).
