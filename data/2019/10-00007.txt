[INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
Dear Jonathan,
A curious thing. I've just pulled out two editions: the Greek NT and
the
Vulgate, perhaps an extreme example of this type of thing. I'm
*attaching*
scans. The British NT doesn't claim copyright in the usual place, the 
German edition of the Vulgate does.
Best, Richard

Re: [INDOLOGY] Highlights from the Sanskrit corpora
I'm not able to engage in this in an informed manner (but did that
stop me before? ;), but, according to what I understand of Dominik's
comment, the editors of the Mbh could NOT claim copyright over the Skt
text, *unless* for instance they printed a conjecture in the text. If
they simply (!!) transcribe MSS, and delete some, over what could they
claim copyright? Because when I type out a text, I do not copy their
font, formatting or anything else, and I already mentioned that we
were not talking about the forematter, any editorial comments, notes
