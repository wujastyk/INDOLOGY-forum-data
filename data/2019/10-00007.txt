Dear Jonathan,

A curious thing. I've just pulled out two editions: the Greek NT and
the
Vulgate, perhaps an extreme example of this type of thing. I'm
*attaching*
scans. The British NT doesn't claim copyright in the usual place, the 
German edition of the Vulgate does.


Best, Richard

I'm not able to engage in this in an informed manner (but did that
stop me before? ;), but, according to what I understand of Dominik's
comment, the editors of the Mbh could NOT claim copyright over the Skt
text, *unless* for instance they printed a conjecture in the text. If
they simply (!!) transcribe MSS, and delete some, over what could they
claim copyright? Because when I type out a text, I do not copy their
font, formatting or anything else, and I already mentioned that we
were not talking about the forematter, any editorial comments, notes
