[INDOLOGY] Dr Carmen Dragonetti (1937-2018)
Dear Colleagues,
on seeing my message the to the H-Buddhism list re-posted by Elizabeth De
Michelis, I realised I had accidentally sent an earlier message - meant to
this list - to the list owner address instead of the list itself, and had
been wondering what had happened to it.
Apologies.
Kind regards,
Dhammadinna

Dear Colleagues,
This is a message on behalf of the venerable Bhik?u Zhihan, president of
the Fundaci?n Bodhiy?na (Buenos Aires), to inform those of us who may not
have heard the news yet, that Dr. Carmen Dragonetti (b. 1937) passed away
on December 1st, 2018, following the passing of her husband Dr. Fernando
Tola (b. 1915) the previous year (2017).
Dr Tola and Dragonetti's Fundaci?n Instituto de Estudios Budistas (FIEB),
with its extensive collection of Buddhist texts and secondary literature,
is now effectively under the management of the Fundaci?n Bodhiy?na. At
present, they are still in the process of finding a permanent home for the
library collection in central Buenos Aires, intending to make it available
to the general public, students and scholar in the near future.
With kind regards,
Bhikkhun? Dhammadinn?
