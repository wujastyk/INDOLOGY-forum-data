[INDOLOGY] Joydeep Bagchee's membership to INDOLOGY
Dear Colleagues,
It would be good to think that the upshot of recent discussions was a
move towards greater openness and diversity. Unfortunately, I can't
see this recent decision by the committee as anything but retrograde.
With kind regards, Richard

Dear Philipp,
I object to this move. Bagchee?s post was interesting and very much to
the point of our recent discussion, and I think the main way one could
find
 it defamatory would be by confusing correlation with causation. To
those who have witnessed this forum over a period of several years, the
idea that the committee
 had ?no choice but to remove Joydeep Bagchee permanently from the
list? may seem far-fetched. Not only will
 progress in matters of gender equality not be made by the committee
proceeding in this way, but the committee may be seen to be actively
hindering the making
 of such progress. I may be wrong, but I cannot help but suspect that
Bagchee?s previous contributions, which have been famously abominated
by some on this list, may have prejudiced the committee against him and
caused it to overreact in this instance. One
 might also wonder whether the committee?s decision is somehow
connected to its current male to female ratio (4:1 following the
unfortunate resignation of Dr Truschke).
Yours collegially,
Simon Brodbeck

Dear Members of INDOLOGY,
The post that Joydeep Bagchee sent to this list on 16 April under the
header ?Re: [INDOLOGY] Response to Shrinivasa Varakhedi? severely
violates the rules for
 usage of the INDOLOGY list, which state that ?In particular, personal
attacks of an ad-hominem nature, rude language, and off-topic postings
are violations of the list rules. The definition and understanding of
what constitutes improper use of the forum shall
 be a matter for the Governing Committee. [...] The Governing Committee
may penalize personal attacks or defamatory speech directed against
other list members with a temporary or permanent removal from the
list.? (http://www.indology.info/email/email-const/). 
The above mentioned severe violation of the Guidelines left the
INDOLOGY Governing Committee with no choice but to remove Joydeep
Bagchee permanently from the
 list.
With best regards,
Philipp Maas
