[INDOLOGY] AAIS
Dear Patricia,
It can help to remember that over seven hundred other members of INDOLOGY
read your post and most of them were certainly terribly shocked by your
experiences and understood the politics of what you went through.  That a
couple of vociferous people do not share our understanding of events is
statistically to be expected in a group this size, and it doesn't mean very
much.
Best,
Dominik
