[INDOLOGY] GRETIL quotation network
Dear Madhav,
Thank you very much for the feedback and thank you for pointing out the
missing etext of the  Atharvaveda-Sa?hit?. I do remember that there was a
problem with the encoding in a few cases and the splitter thus failed to
process a couple of etexts but when I spot-checked I couldn't locate the
problem. I think it should be easy to fix and I will look into it the next
days.
Regarding the V?kyapad?ya, this should be the file:
http://buddhist-db.de/sanskrit-html/vakyp1au.html
When I scraped the data from GRETIL, all I could use in order to provide
the filenames was the information included in the headers of the etexts,
which is usually without diacritics and sometimes in a strange formatting,
so using the list I provided has it's own challenges. Unfortunately there
is not yet  a good well-formatted list of the (about 1300) etexts in this
collection, that would be very helpful.
With best wishes,
Sebastian
