=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Vimuttimagga--yogin/yog=C4=81vacara?=
Greetings,
In looking at two variant studies of Upatissa?s Vimuttimagga, I?ve noticed that in one (Ehara/Thera/Thera, 1961) that the term ?yogin? is frequently utilized, whereas in the other (Bapat, 1931) the (equivalent?) term used is ?yog?vacara.? Given that the terminology of the Vimuttimagga is being re-translated into P?li from Chinese, I?m wondering if anyone can provide clarification as to (1) what Chinese term is being translated as such; and (2) what would be a more accurate translation (if there is one) of that term, and why.
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!
Best Wishes,
Stuart
