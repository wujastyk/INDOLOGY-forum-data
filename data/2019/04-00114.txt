[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Paolo, 
I am not saying that we should put a complete end to the quota system, I am just saying that it is problematic and that I doubt that it really solves the problem. As you have pointed out, there is no end to that, should we have quotas for all the excluded groups and all the minorities? As far as I?m concerned, I don?t think that we should segment humanity, I don?t think that it would be needed to have someone from each minority or excluded group to represent it. We don?t need to belong to a group to defend its members. Or else you could only represent blue eyed male Indologists and I could only represent 5 feet female Indologists. Is that what we really want? I think that there are no inherent biological difference between us, be it in our DNA or in our brains. 
The world is for sure far from utopic. But I think to try and make it a bit better, the only way is that human beings, regardless of the group to which they might belong, take an active part to oppose all forms of segregation. I?m glad that our male colleagues also stand against gender bias. 
Kind regards,
Iran
