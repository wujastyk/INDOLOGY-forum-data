Dear Scholars,
I remember? reading a discussion about how examinations were conducted in a typical gha?ik?. Each question was written on a palm leaf and many such palm leaves were put inside a pot. When a student came to be tested, a palm leaf was pulled from the pot and the student was asked the question written on the palm leaf. 
Unfortunately, I have lost the reference to this discussion. Does anybody on the list know the source?
Thank you in advance.
Regards,
Palaniappan
