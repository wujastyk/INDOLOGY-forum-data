[INDOLOGY] Joydeep Bagchee's membership to INDOLOGY
Dear Members of INDOLOGY,
The post that Joydeep Bagchee sent to this list on 16 April under the
header ?Re: [INDOLOGY] Response to Shrinivasa Varakhedi? severely violates
the rules for usage of the INDOLOGY list, which state that ?In particular,
personal attacks of an ad-hominem nature, rude language, and off-topic
postings are violations of the list rules. The definition and understanding
of what constitutes improper use of the forum shall be a matter for the
Governing Committee. [...] The Governing Committee may penalize personal
attacks or defamatory speech directed against other list members with a
temporary or permanent removal from the list.? (
http://www.indology.info/email/email-const/).
The above mentioned severe violation of the Guidelines left the INDOLOGY
Governing Committee with no choice but to remove Joydeep Bagchee
permanently from the list.
With best regards,
Philipp Maas
