Dear All,
forgive me if my previous message has bored or peeved off some of you. It was not my intention to re-open a debate. I do believe that Reich's book deserves to be given a look-in because it is not a personal work of his, but the fruit of an international project, in which hundreds of geneticists and archaeologists (from many countries) have been involved. I am of the opinion that genetics can tell us a lot. Although ?science is an open-ended process? (as the esteemed colleague Dan wrote, whom I thank for his kind reply), certain evidence such as the migration of the pastoral Yamnaya to Europe and Northern India are  ?almost certain? (see Reich, Science in ?The Economic Times? Oct 12, 2019, p. 2) and definitive (Reich 2018, p. 198). Yamnaya?s DNA is there and nothing can change this evidence, although, regarding other topics, there is a lot that remains to be discovered.
But in the end, I don?t want to convince anybody.
Best Wishes,
Tiziana Lorenzetti
