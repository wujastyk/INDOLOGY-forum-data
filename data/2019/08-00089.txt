For microsoft Word the shortcuts I've set up are:
Ctrl+letter for diacritical over the letter
Alt+letter for diacritical under the letter
Ctrl+Alt+letter for diacriticals over and under the letter
Ctrl+~ for ?
For me this is the most intuitive and gives:
 ctrl+a = ?
ctrl+i = ?
ctrl+u = ?
ctrl+r = ?
alt+ctrl+r = ?
ctrl+l = ?
alt+ctrl+l = ?
ctrl+n = ?
ctrl+~ = ?
alt+n = ?
ctrl+m = ?
alt+m = ?
ctrl+s = ?
alt+s = ?
