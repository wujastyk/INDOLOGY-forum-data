Dear Andrew,

I assume that you are familiar with the Indoskript database of our colleagues Harry Falk and Oliver Hellwig, but, if not, by all means take a close look:
http://www.indoskript.org/

As for producing the images themselves, I will also be interested in recommendations from others. I've been using digital imaging (scan or photo) of the highest resolution possible for folio, or folio part, images, followed by cut-and-paste in Photoshop, playing with color and contrast if required to maximize the clarity of the syllable. Digital bricolage, in fact.

all best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Script tables

Dear list members,

I was wondering whether anyone has experience drawing up "script tables," representating the characters used either in a given document (say a manuscript or inscription) or in a collection of documents. I realize that a lot depends on whether the table will be printed or published online (e.g., the use of color images), but I'm interested in recommendations for producing suitable images. (I'm aware of the very useful charts, adapted from B?hler?s Indische Palaeographie, that D?niel Balogh posted on this list some time ago.)

Andrew
