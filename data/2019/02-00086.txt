[INDOLOGY] How about Vedic accent >>> Re: Various Font's comparison with Vani Vilas
Does Vani Vilas provide a way to represent Vedic accent as in ???????????
?????????? ?
Some two decades ago John Smith published (
http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/index.html) his fonts Nakula and
Sahadeva, which are
"two TrueType/OpenType Unicode Devanagari fonts. Both contain all the
conjuncts and other ligatures (including Vedic accents) likely to be needed
by Sanskritists."
In my view this is a minimum requirement for a Devanagari font.
The representation of accents in combination with other signs is, however,
not always ideal in Nakula and Sahadeva, for instance svarita in
combination with long i, superscript r etc.
Is there any Unicode Devanagari font that represents Vedic accent and is
there any software to transscribe text with Vedic accent from Unicode
Devanagari to a Unicode roman script (and vice versa)?
