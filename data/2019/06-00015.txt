[INDOLOGY] Kindly review the fonts and help for crowd funding
Dear all
I have a plan to distribute the fonts without any charges after I get back
the money I've invested. The official release of the fonts will be in the
month of August or September. To reach break-even I am collecting the
money. If you and your contacts ready to contribute let me know. Your help
is highly admired.
I have 2 more designs of Nirnaya Sagar. Will send them when they are ready.
Please report the errors and Will fix it in no time, Thank you.

Yours sincerely
KP
