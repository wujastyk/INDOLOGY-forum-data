IMHO, the issue is that there are authorized insults like "far-right" or "racist" and non-authorized insults like "asshole", "bastard", etc.
The first set usually escapes moderation censureship, while the other set is usually not accepted.

  yes, I agree that jerks who overuse the word "far-right" should rather
