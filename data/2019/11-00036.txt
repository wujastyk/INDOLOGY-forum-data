[INDOLOGY] Script tables
Dear Matthew,
if you want to construct any script or devanagari *font *(eg .ttf) for 
using in word documents:
Very important is to work with vector based images.
In the Nineties I produced some different styled Devanagari fonts with 
the help of the Windows app TypeFoundry.
This app no longer exists. Today the app FontCreator is available, which 
works similar.
You make a scan of the desired letters, import to FontCreator. There it 
will be converted into a vector image.
Now you will be able to make minor changes to the letter. You can also 
assign the letters to any keyboard key.
When you are finished the app will produce a .ttf font for the 
windows/font folder.
Of course you can also use this font for a script table.
