[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear Dr Korn,
I think you're quite right on all points.  On this issue of bandwidth, I
think I should just get over myself.  It's obsolete thinking.  I regret
writing to Prof. Paturi; we've made friends again, and I think all is well.
Best,
Dominik
