Dear Oliver,
Brilliant!
Thanks for making this new research tool available.
Your text plus your own annotated "pada-p??ha" for Vedic and classical
Sanskrit texts is extremely useful.
I did a quick test for a few texts.
As for RV 1.1.1, last word (which we discussed earlier):
in the Rgveda the root dh? (cp. Gk. tith?mi "I establish" and IE *dh?) is
synchronically to be distinguished from d? (cp. Gk. did?mi "I give, confer"
and IE *d?), even if the two converge in meaning in classical Sanskrit as
attested by the meaning annotations of these two roots in various
Dh?tu-p??has.
A better meaning annotation would then be "best establisher of" (this will
apply to other occurrences, as in varivo-dh?tama).
(For the subtle but not insignificant meaning difference compare "Brot
geben" and "Brot schaffen".)
After all, the reconstructed IE form underlying English "fact" and French
"faire" is ... *dh?
(which in its o-grade also underlies English "do" and German "tun", Dutch
"doen", old Germanic "d?n" which has remained "d?n" in my own native
Limburgian (east low Franconian) dialect),
definitely not *d?.
The somewhat surprising semantic closeness of *dh? and "faire" is confirmed
by the entirely appropriate annotation by Geldner, ad loc. RV 1.1.1; still,
in Vedic the verb is, of course, not flatly synonymous with kr, so from
this perspective too "best establisher of" would be a suitable annotation.
And the meaning annotation of ratna should be slimmed down: "classical"
meanings such as "gem" can, no: should, be left out in an annotation of a
Rgvedic hymn.
Best regards,
Jan
