Dear Matthew
Thank you, that does explain it. The most likely corresponding verse in the Sanskrit then seems to be 15.19, which has nai?kramya. The order of the verses in the Sanskrit (ed. Bernhard) and the Tibetan must be different in this chapter. Considering that this comes from a long series of verses repeated with only one or two words changed each time, it is easy to see how this could happen.
