[INDOLOGY] RV manuscript
Dear List Members,
I am currently preparing a short video introduction to Vedic Sanskrit 
for students of linguistics and would like to illustrate the Pathas with 
a picture of an RV manuscript as I think the students would benefit 
greatly from this.
Unfortunately, I can't find a RV manuscript online (labeled for 
noncommercial reuse) in which both the Samhita and Pada Patha are 
combined...
Any help or hints much appreciated!
Thanks,
Tim Felix Aufderheide
