Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help to identify this printed book
Message-ID: <CAODNnZg+ADCZ_hmv+5gKZP7_DC4Z9JqZXD21ckB3F=7Dd77wrg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all
I found this image on the internet. Only this page I got accidentally when
I was searching something else. It seems the whole book is available
online. I am very much interested in Purva mimansa texts. So searching.
Could you please help to find this book.
