Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce the publication of my new book on the compositional history of the Artha??stra and its philosophy of governance:
Mark McClish. The History of the Artha??stra: Sovereignty and Sacred Law in Ancient India (Cambridge University Press, 2019), 306 pages.

Summary:
The first half of the book presents a model of the Artha??stra?s textual development, arguing that the extant text is a 3rd century CE redaction of a treatise written a few centuries earlier. This model is then used in the second half to demonstrate that the political theologies of var?adharma and r?jadharma exerted little influence on the original text, which was decidedly empiricist and pragmatic in character. I argue that this disposition characterized the early statecraft tradition generally.
