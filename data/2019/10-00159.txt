Dear Colleagues,

the second volume of Bh?skaraka??ha's Mok?op?ya-Nirv??a-??k? has appeared,
edited by Bruno Lo Turco (Roma).

"This volume completes the critical edition of the large extant fragment of
the *Nirv??aprakara?a* ? the sixth section of the *Mok?op?ya* ? with the
commentary *Nirv??a??k?* of Bh?skaraka??ha, one of the last great
non-dualist ?aivite masters. The *Mok?op?ya*, a huge
philosophico-soteriological work probably composed by a Kashmiri author in
the tenth century of our era, was the original version of what would become
the *Yogav?si??ha*, which enjoyed enormous popularity in India, in certain
regions second only to the two great epic poems."
