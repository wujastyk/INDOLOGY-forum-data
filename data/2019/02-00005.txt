[INDOLOGY] Request
Dear Colleagues,
it seems that the Journal of Oriental Inst. Baroda is not in Internet snd our library accession only begins in the early 70s. I would like to know, what Vittore Pisani had to say in vol. 14, 1965, 315f. I would be grateful of a scan of those two pages (if my reference is correct).
Best,
Klaus
