[INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
And there are other ways we "pay" without knowing it at all...all "free"
publishers (as far as my experience goes) require that we, as authors,
assign copyright to them. This means we actually lose our right to
distribute them, to reprint, etc. (whether we hold to this or not). In
fact, if not for jstor, I would not have access to any of my old articles,
reviews, etc. in electronic form. (And, here, too there are limits, as I
believe the copyright transfers to jstor).
