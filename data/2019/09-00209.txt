Subject: [INDOLOGY] Problem with Indology list postings.
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQGLCRXOZ4HErh99uu3ckp5iurrbUMcmLj29wGp4w15vAQ@mail.gmail.com>

With every indology list posting I receive,  I am now also receiving
multiple emails (between 5 and 45 emails) from Shervin Farridnejad <<
s.farridnejad at fu-berlin.de>

These are in german but appear to be an automatic out of office message.
