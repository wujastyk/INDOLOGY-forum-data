P.S. Or perhaps k???a is simply an epithet for a dark/black form of ?iva/Bhairava, parallel to k???? just before it in the verse.

Dear Mr. Spier,

Could it perhaps be a reference to K????nanda ?gamav?g??a, the T?ntrika? See, e.g., Encountering K?l?, ed. McDermott and Kripal, p. 54.

Best wishes,
Michael

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Name of k?li in ?dy?k?lik?stotram

Dear list members,

In verse 3 of the ?dy?k?lik?stotram (hundred names of Kali)

k?p?may? k?p?dh?r? k?p?p?r? k?p?gam? |

k???nu? kapil? k???? k????nandavivarddhin? || 3 ||


I've seen k????nandavivarddhin? translated as "the one who increases the bliss of Krishna", but it seemed strange to me that the god Krishna would be mentioned in a hymn to Kali (or is it?).  Are there other translations of  k????nandavivarddhin? that would  make more sense in this context?

Thanks,

Harry Spier
