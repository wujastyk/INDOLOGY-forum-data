Dear Colleagues,
     I wonder if anyone has any information regarding a text called
Maitr?ya?? Pari????a.  I came across a reference to this text in a travel
account by a Marathi Brahmin [???? ??????, by ?????????? ?????] around
1857.  In Gwalior, there was a ??stra discussion about the appropriate
month for Upanayana of a Maitr?ya?? child, and this text was consulted in
that discussion.  The account says that the Maitr?ya?? household in Gwalior
followed the traditions of the Gau?a brahmins.  This interestingly
contrasts with the fight of the Maitr?ya?? community in Maharashtra to be
counted among Dr?vi?a brahmins, something that I have discussed in an
article.
