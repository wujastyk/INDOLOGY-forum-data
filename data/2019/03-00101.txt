[INDOLOGY] Non-standard sandhi
I have a question for the vaiy?kara?as among us (who may find it very 
basic, in which case I apologize in advance):
In the /T?jikayogasudh?nidhi /of Y?davas?ri (fl. possibly early 17th 
century, possibly in or near Gujarat) there occurs the following stanza 
(12.15), the form of which is corroborated by several independent witnesses:
janmalagnapatir uttamav?ryo yadg?he janu?i tatra ca d???e |
tena v? _sahita asya_ ca labdhis tad yath??gasukham abdatanau sy?t ||
(As the meaning is quite technical, I give my translation: 'If the house 
in which the ruler of the ascendant of the nativity is [placed] with 
excellent strength in the nativity is aspected or joined by that [ruler, 
there is] attainment of [the matter signified by] that [house]: for 
example, [if it is placed] in the ascendant of the year, there will be 
pleasures of the body.')
