Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about kings poisoned by wives
Message-ID: <CAAiVBEX0fpVN3oHetx=GeiauDoPJ1zav_UdV-9AqdTGMPZm7EA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends, To emphasize how careful the king should be even among his
intimates, the N?tis?ra presents a series of brief anecdotes about kings
who were assassinated by by their wives and family members for a variety of
reasons (specified concisely by the comm. Jayama?gal?). I was wondering if
any of you know these stories in more detail from other sources. These are
the stories of Bhadrasena (killed by his brother hiding in the queen's
quarters), K?r??a (killed by his son hiding under his mother's bed), a
certain K??ir?jendra (killed by wife with poisoned rice), Vair?pya (killed
with a poisoned girdle-jem), and J?ru?ya (killed by a small dagger hidden
in the queen's braid). Thanks and all best, ??????,J
