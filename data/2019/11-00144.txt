[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit and Linguistics
One might look at the work of Ferdinand de Saussure as a start.  His students compiled his lectures notes into a book (in French), and careful examination of his foundational ideas about semiotics and language suggest (at least to me) that they bear a remarkable resemblance to Bhartrhari's schemas about language. de Saussure was also a professor of Sanskrit.
