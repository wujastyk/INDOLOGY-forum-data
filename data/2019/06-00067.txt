[INDOLOGY] Studies on the Rigveda [Addendum: Table of Contents]
Dear Joanna,
A good way to bring a diverse range of scholars together is to advertise meetings early and widely.  Christophe?s response is the first that I have heard about a 7th International Vedic Workshop this summer.  I does not seem to have been announced on this list, so the circular must have gone to a narrower group (perhaps just those who happened to be able to attend the 6th IVW)?
Best,
Tim

Is the programme of the 7th International Vedic Workshop to be held in Dubrovnik in this coming August (19-24), already available? There was an invitation for proposals of round-tables.
Best wishes,
Christophe

Dear All,
Thank you for this info and the previous ones concerning the Rgvedic topic.
I think that it is high time to organize a round-table on the Rgveda at which various scholars could meet. I know very well that my work is simply ignored by some scholar (for the moment I will not reveal their names, although some of you probably know them). To be ignored is even worse than to be criticized.
So at such a round-table meeting I would expect a fierce discussion with fruitful conclusions which will open new perspectives in our research. No exclusive, but inclusive. We, Poles, are good in organizing round-tables debates, the fall of communism in the Eastern Europe began with such a debate 30 years ago.
Regards,
Joanna
P.S. I am sorry for my mistakes in English. My mother tongue is Polish and, although I have made a lot of effort to learn English as well as I could,  my thoughts and feelings are expressed in Polish in the best way. Unfortunately, it is me who has to learn foreign language to be internationally recognized, and not many of you (if you are German or French, you can also present  your research in your languages) . But the fact that your languages are in use  is the matter of chance or power. It has nothing to do with quality of my research.

Dear George,
by using the link I had previously sent
https://uvhw.de/studia-indologica/product/190225_08-193-9.html
an add-to-cart button ("In den Warenkorb") will show, bottom left. A click  adds the ordered copy to the cart. As a next step, go to "Warenkorb" proper (displayed in white letters in the black bar above):
https://uvhw.de/warenkorb.html
The rest will be self-explanatory, I believe.
The same ordering process holds good for all the volumes in this series:
https://uvhw.de/studia-indologica.html
Optionally, one can always also send a simple order mail to the publishers:
bestellung at uvhw.de<mailto:bestellung at uvhw.de>
peter.junkermann at uvhw.de<mailto:peter.junkermann at uvhw.de>
Hope, it helps!
Best wishes,
Walter
