The word "Dharma" ,in the Indian context, takes it's origin from the Sanskrit root "Dhr" which means "to sustain" It imparts a sense of sustaining a paradigm or a pattern, be it of society or individual.Upholding this Dharma in the social matrix,speaks of Righteousness.This certainly leaves a question as to whether it is at all identical with the word"Doom"?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However,it may be a point in question as to whether the word"doom" can find any identity with the word "Dharma Shastra" which is set of formal rules or statutes or decrees,enshrining Dharma ,in&nbsp; a social context .&nbsp; &nbsp; Alakendu Das.

Dear colleagues,





Can anyone comment on the etymological link (if any) between the word "doom" and the word "dharma"?





Thanks in advance ...
