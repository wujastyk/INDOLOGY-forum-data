Hello all,


If I may, I would like to announce the publication of the following title:


The Pradyumn?bhyudaya of Ravivarman: A New Sanskrit Text of the Trivandrum Edition and English Translation. Translated with an Introduction by Christopher R. Austin. Harrassowitz Verlag, Drama und Theater in S?dasien no.12.

A full monograph study on Pradyumna, the play's hero, will appear later this year.


Kindest regards,

Chris
