Subject: [INDOLOGY] Up to date index of digitized Sanskrit literature and metadata
Message-ID: <CA+wUuzNzMpRHiQMDUY-fSUYE==vE-iEN9_Tf7p+i+R4xvxqNjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

I am looking for an up to date index of sites/projects that have digitized Sanskrit literature and/or metadata of Sanskrit literature.

I am aware of the lists<http://indology.info/etexts/> maintained on the Indology site and its links<http://indology.info/links/> page.

Thank you kindly,

Martin Gluckman
