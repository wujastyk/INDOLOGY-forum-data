[INDOLOGY] Up to date index of digitized Sanskrit literature and metadata
Dear Friends,
I am looking for an up to date index of sites/projects that have digitized Sanskrit literature and/or metadata of Sanskrit literature.
I am aware of the lists<http://indology.info/etexts/> maintained on the Indology site and its links<http://indology.info/links/> page.
Thank you kindly,
Martin Gluckman
