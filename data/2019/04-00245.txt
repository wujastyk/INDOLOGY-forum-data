[INDOLOGY] Problem searching Indology archives
I've just tried to search the Indology archives.  When I click on any of
the search results I get this error message.
Not Found
The requested URL /pipermail/
indology_list.indology.info/2008-July/126472.html was not found on this
server.
Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an
ErrorDocument to handle the request.
