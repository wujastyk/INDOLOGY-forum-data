[INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
Second Post-Scriptum
Based on the notes given by UVS, I now see that the Cilappatik?ram line
(i.e. ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????)
seems to be a variation
on a ????????? line,
namely
???????? ?????????? ????? ??????????
(Pu?am 117, line 1)
Commentators seem to think that
???????? is also a reference to Saturn,
if I understand them correctly ....)
Obviously, I have sent too many posts today.
Therefore I shall leave it at that
:-)
Best wishes to all
