[INDOLOGY] request
Dear list members,
In 2004 our university library seems to have discontinued its subscription (paper and e-journal) to Journal of Indian Philosophy.  I am looking for C. Emmrich, "The Ins and Outs of the Jains in Tamil Literary Histories" JIP 39 (6), pp. 599-646. I hope someone on this list can help me with a pdf or a link to a site where it is available.
With kind regards, Herman
