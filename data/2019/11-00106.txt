[INDOLOGY] Intro to mathematics in Skt
Thanks so much Jean Michel. I'm a sukum?ramati, horrible at math, otherwise
would have surely known your work. I hardly had a clue about the English-
language scholarship. I have huge respect for francophone Indology, where
some of e.g. the k?vya scholarship is without parallel, and agree that it
is very important for Indology to remain multilingual. I appreciate your
drawing my attention to your ?uvre and promise to read it if I make any
progress in my reading on the topic. Merci mille fois, bhavad?ya?,J
