[INDOLOGY] Tamil proverb?
In Parthasarathy's translation of the Cilappatik?ram, on p. 98 it reads "Even if ?ani (Tamil ca?i)/Fumes and comets blaze ..." But then, the Cilappatik?ram does not belong to the so-called older layers of Tamil literature (pace Tieken, 2001/2017 reprint).

If the implicit question is whether there are in the 21st century people
in Tamil Nadu who believe in the influence of planets, the answer is
probably yes, but I do not know how this compares with the same belief
in other parts of India or other parts of the world
If the question is whether one can find traces of such beliefs in
ancient Tamil literature, part of the answer might be that the earliest
reference to a list of planet names is seen in the T?v?ram
See the well-known hymn T?v?ram 2:85
which starts with:
???? ??? ???? ??????, ????? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ???? ????,
???? ??? ??????? ????? ???????? ???????, ??? ???? ?????????????---
??????, ???????, ????????, ?????, ???????, ??????, ???, ??????????????, ????
??? ?????; ????????; ??? ????????, ??????????????? ?????.
You can see ??? in the second line
There does not seem to be references to  ??? in the older layer of Tamil
literature (as described in 3 volumes /Index des mots de la literature
tamoule ancienne/ Institut Fran?ais d'Indologie, Pondich?ry, 1967-1970)
One should also mention (in connection with ???) the well-known temple
described in

I hope this is useful
