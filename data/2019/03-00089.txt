 Dear Madhav,
I would also be very interested to hear the audio recording of the verse(s).... Thank you for sharing it if possible.
With best regards,

 Dear Madhav,
Your recording did not come through. I, too, would be anxious to hear it. 
While writing, I have long been wanting to say how much I have benefited from your verses. It is very rare that we can know for sure what a writing in Sanskrit means, directly from the author. This is especially so for metrical verses. Your accompanying English translations are really helpful. I look forward to my daily Sanskrit lessons from you, in the form of your lovely verses.
Best regards,

Hello Jan,
? ? ?Here is my recording of my verse in ?ry?.? This is the general style of reciting ?ry? in Maharashtra.? This meter was made popular in Marathi by a poet named Moropant [May?rakavi] during the Peshwa period.? He composed 108 different R?m?ya?as, and an entire Mah?bh?rata in Marathi using ?ry?.??
