[INDOLOGY] [Archiving Open Access publications] Re: question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Dear Richard,
First, I'm sure all are grateful for this source, and this avenue is
interesting. But I do wonder about something, since you state that the
publication is Open Access.
The copyright notice nevertheless is the conventional:
"? Copyright 2018 Sean D. Gaffney. All rights reserved.The Author asserts
their moral rights in respect of this work,including their right to be
identified as author"
According to my understanding, "all rights reserved" means that the
publication, despite having been posted for free download, is not in fact
Open Access. But perhaps after all I am quite wrong about this; it
certainly would be neither the first nor the last time!
Best, Jonathan
