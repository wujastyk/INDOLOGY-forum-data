=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Statement_on_sth=C4=81yibh=C4=81va?=
Now the sth?yibh?va is a state of mind which because it is more deeply
felt, dominates all other emotions.  It belongs to both the character and
to the spectator
is not a translation , nor paraphrasing of a part of a Sanskrit text.
It is an explanatory sentence.
It belongs to both the character and to the spectator
is the restatement of the Rasanishpatti explanations in which the question
of yannishThah ?  is discussed.
 Rasa exists in both anukaarya = character, saamaajika/ prekshaka  =
spectator is one of the positions taken in this regard.
But in the case of sthaayeebhaava its existence in both anukaarya and
saamaajika / prekshaka is not disputed.
