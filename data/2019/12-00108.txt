Victor D'Avella in his PhD thesis (Creating the Perfect Language: Sanskrit Grammarians, Poetry, and the Exegetical Tradition) says (p. 355):

I recall a verse that H. V. Nagaraja Rao once recited to me and which I have since
located in the prefatory verses of Devabodha?s J??nad?pik? [note 17: Many thanks to Harunaga Isaacson and Whitney Cox, who independently pointed out this reference to me.] and K???a ?e?a Prak??a:

y?ny ujjah?ra m?hendr?d vy?so vy?kara??r?av?t |
t?ni ki? ?abdaratn?ni santi p??inigo?pade || (J??naprad?pik?, p. 2) [note 18: PrKPra vol. III p. 6.14 with the variant mahe??d for mahendr?d.]

?Are the gems of speech, which Vy?sa has retrieved out of the ocean of grammar
from great Indra, to be found in P??ini?s puddle??
