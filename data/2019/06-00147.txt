[INDOLOGY] Three doctoral positions in Southeast Asian epigraphy and history for DHARMA project
Dear colleagues,
The EFEO is soliciting applications for three doctoral positions in Southeast Asian epigraphy and history: one for Cambodia, one for Camp? and one for Java. In all cases, knowledge of Sanskrit is a great plus.
The French announcement is available here: <https://www.efeo.fr/uploads/docs/pdf_presentation/PhD-Candidates-DHARMA-EFEO_FR.pdf>. I am attaching the English equivalent.
Please forward to colleagues in the relevant fields, and to any potentially interested students.
Thank you.
Arlo Griffiths
