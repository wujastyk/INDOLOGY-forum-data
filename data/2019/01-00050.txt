Longhurst, A.H. 1916?1917. ?The Buddhist Monuments at Guntupalle, Kistna District.? Annual Report of the Archaeological Department, Southern Circle, Madras, 30?36.
???. 1919?1920. ?Report on Places Visited.? Annual Report of the Archaeological Department, Southern Circle, Madras, 24?38.

Thank you!
