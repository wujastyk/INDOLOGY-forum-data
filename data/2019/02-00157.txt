=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Vimuttimagga--yogin/yog=C4=81vacara?=
Dear Stuart,
The term used in Chinese is ??? = zuochan ren = a meditator, lit. ?person sitting in sam?dhi.?
Broken down
? zuo = ?sitting?
? chan = sam?dhi, meditation
? ren = person
The term appears 311 times in the Vimuttimagga.
This is an early 6th c translation, and later zuochan became the term for ?sitting in Chan/Zen.?
As for being unequivocal about the Indic original of that term in this text, that is difficult. 
First, the translator, ????, whose name is variously transcribed as *Sa?ghabhara or *Sa?ghavara or *Sa?ghavarman, and is translated into Chinese as Zhongkai ?? ( ?Armor of the Sa?gha? ), also translated Mah?y?na materials, such as The Praj??p?ramit? as Taught by Ma?ju?r?, (T.233) which is a translation of the ?apta?atik? praj??p?ramit? ( ?Perfection of Wisdom in 700 Lines?); the J??n?lok?la?k?ra-s?tra (T. 358); Mah?y?na Ratnamegha sutra (T. 659), and so on, so one may question whether the original of the ?Vimuttimagga? was in Pali rather than Sanskrit or some related Indic language. Some East Asian scholarship has taken to rendering its Indian title as Vimuktim?rga.
Second, different translators used different equivalents for Indic terms. Zuochan ren *could* represent yogi, yog?vacara, yog?c?ra, yog?c?rya, etc., or something else. In the broadest sense, zuochan ren should be understood as ?a serious practitioner.?
Hope that helps.
