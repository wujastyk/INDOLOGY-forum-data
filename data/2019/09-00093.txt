Dear Oliver,

In case it hasn't been mentioned yet, there is some relevant
information in *Bha??oji
D?k?ita on the *Gajas?tra by S.L.P. Anjaneya Sharma and Fran?ois Grimal,
2013. The introduction may be of particular interest. Another more
elementary text that discusses the subcategories of the *k?raka*s is the
*Prayogamukha*/*V?rarucasa?graha* with the commentaries by Dharmak?rti and
N?r?ya?a. A short summary is also given in Bhoja's ???g?raprak??a 2nd
Prak??a, p. 76 (ed. Raghavan).

All the Best,
Victor
