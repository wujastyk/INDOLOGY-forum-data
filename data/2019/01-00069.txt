[INDOLOGY] New font design from Vani Vilas, feedback request
Dear all
I outsourced Vanivilas fonts for designing.
 I observed 3 weights. Normal Bold and Heavy Bold
here I am sending a pdf of Bold(yet to decide with weights) fonts, which
are mainly used in all the texts published earlier, the regular or normal
fonts were used only for commentaries or footnotes. And the heavy bold for
Title, headings etc.
Please suggest corrections.
Regards
Krishna Prasad
