While Jonathan is correct that this is a list about Indian Studies, I do think that it is very much in the interest of the list to address issues of bias and intimidation that Audrey mentioned. Any field of scholarship is an all hands on deck affair. If we want to reach our full potential, then we cannot afford to have some of us intimidated into not sharing work, opinions, etc. because of things like gender bias.

Dear All
First, I want to clarify that I think these discussions are important--in the context of Indology.
However, this list is not, in my opinion, the place to debate (etc) institutional forms of discrimination, fundamentally important as they no doubt are. There are so many things which so many of us are passionate about, but this list is about Indian Studies, and while that surely includes the conduct of the management of the list itself, the recently discussed Sanskrit conference, and matters of that ilk, it does not include, I would maintain,  German or Austrian higher education as a whole, for example. So my plea to all of us is to focus on the topics relevant to this list here, and find other fora for other conversations.
Thank you for listening,
Joanthan

Dear Jon and Agnes,

The clause you cite automatically appears in any job advertisement in Austria and Germany in the public sector. It is a legal requirement and has nothing to do with the university or department in question. Such clauses were installed at some point because of (among other things) the appallingly low number of female professors (some 14% or so at the time the legislation was introduced).

Thank you for the comment. I apologise, I didn't know that universities to not follow the rules. I thought that this clause was actually taken into account. The statement is discriminatory against men, nonetheless, and as an applicant, I wondered if it was really worth trying. Again, that could be the whole purpose of the clause. I don?t know. I just felt it was unfair to men, not to men as a social class, but to particular individuals who may have nothing to do with structural sexism. If you think that?s not the case, then we disagree and that is fine.

what?s the problem with ?Given equal qualifications, preference will be given to female applicants??

The problem is not in this line, but in the previous one, where it says non-discriminatory employment policy. Will you agree that when preference is given on the basis of gender, this is a discriminatory statement? Perhaps I got it wrong.

Jon, when I say that a thousand things can be changed I mean they should be, and I think the debate is positive, including the debate on discriminatory clauses. I did not mean anything against Audrey, whom I personally know I respect very much, as a friend and as a scholar. Apologies if anyone felt offended. I am looking forward to what Audrey has to say.

Best wishes,
Aleix

?A thousand things that can be improved? is the argument of relativization. Any wishes for change can be met with relativization, but it?s a poor argument.

And dear Aleix, what?s the problem with ?Given equal qualifications, preference will be given to female applicants?? Perhaps one day we will need to change ?female? with ?male?. Who knows?

Best,
Jon

Dear Audrey,

I am sure that there are a thousand things that can be improved. I think I know how you feel. Please see the following clause in one of the jobs I applied for, in Vienna, realted to Indology:

The University pursues a non-discriminatory employment policy and values equal opportunities, as well as diversity (http://diversity.univie.ac.at/). The University lays special emphasis on increasing the number of women in senior and in academic positions. Given equal qualifications, preference will be given to female applicants.



So much for non-discrimination.



Best wishes,

Aleix

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I am writing to call your attention to the entrenched, worsening sexism I have been experiencing on the INDOLOGY governing committee over the past year or so (I have served on the committee for six years). Other committee members have warned me not to publicly discuss the bullying and abuse that I have faced from them in private. I break my silence and go against their explicit instructions here.

I have repeatedly faced sexism within the INDOLOGY governing committee, ranging from patronizing comments to silencing of discussions about bias to overtly different standards applied to male and female members of the committee and list. I have tried many times to raise these issues internally among the committee and privately with specific individuals. I have been met with blanket denials, belittling of my concerns, declarations that discussing sexism is not a substantive issue, accusations of being a troublemaker, and flat out refusals to discuss gender issues. Indology as a discipline has deep-seated issues with male privilege, discrimination against female scholars, and even outright misogyny. The issues within INDOLOGY's male-dominated governing committee are arguably a reflection of this larger set of problems that systematically drives women out of the discipline. If Indology or INDOLOGY are going to survive in any worthwhile form, we must face our ongoing issues of sexism and bias. I have made numerous suggestions to the INDOLOGY governing committee in this regard, including striving for gender parity on the committee by adding more female members, conducting committee business more openly as a check on bullying, and undergoing bias training. I hope the committee follows up on these suggestions. But, to date, I have seen only a desire to circle the wagons and deny bias, rather than any serious attempt to make the committee or the list a more equitable place.

Last week, following another case where I documented and called out a committee member for acting with bias, that committee member wrote that if he were in my position, he would consider resigning from the committee. In other words, if I find members of the INDOLOGY committee discriminate against women, then I should bow out. I find that suggestion highly inappropriate, and I do not acquiesce to it here. But I will no longer serve as a punching bag for men who insist I keep quiet.

I expect to face significant pushback and recriminations for shedding light on the dark underbelly of the INDOLOGY governing committee. But, unlike many of my fellow committee members, I think that this is an issue for the list at large. Many of us, myself included, find scholarly value in this listserv. But knowledge exists within power structures, and I find that I can no longer stomach what I have to overlook in order to quietly run this forum. I think it is time for us to talk about the key issues of bias and sexism facing our discipline that make women unwelcome at every turn, including in running this listserv.

All the best,

Audrey
