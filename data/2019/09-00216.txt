[INDOLOGY] Lib of Congress: Special display on Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary (Oct 2)
Dear colleagues,
With apologies for cross-posting? On the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma
Gandhi (Wednesday October 2), the Library of Congress and Embassy of India
will invite the public to the Library?s Whittall Pavilion for a special
display on Gandhiji?s life and legacy. The display, which is free and open
to all from 11:00am to 4:00pm, draws from the Library?s collections to
highlight Mahatma Gandhi?s contributions to nonviolence in India and the
United States. Those in the DC area on October 2 are most welcome to visit
Reading Room whenever your travels bring you through DC.
For details and collection highlights on display on 10/2, please see the
Library of Congress press release:

The event flyer is also attached as a jpeg.
Ahead of this event, the Library of Congress digitized its handwritten
draft of Mahatma Gandhi?s essay ?A Common Platform," which bears the
signature ?M.K. Gandhi? on page six. This draft is viewable online (
https://www.loc.gov/item/2002531352) and discussed in more detail in a
recent blog post (

).
Kind regards,
