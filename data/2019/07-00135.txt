As for RV 1.164.24, is "measure" (Ludwig, Jamison-Brereton) really a
felicitous translation here?
To my 2007 article I would like to add an *update* 28-7-2019 and revert to
my 2000 translation of the verse:
According to the G?yatr? (-line) one makes the song of praise (ark?);
according to the song of praise a chant (sa?ma), according to the Tri??ubh
(-line) the recitation; according to the two- and four-lined recitation
(again a larger) recitation; according to the SYLLABLE they make the seven
VOICES.
note: With ?According to? I revert to my 2000 translation of this verse,
taking the verb in the first line, pr?ti mim?te ?make in accordance with;
copy? (Grassmann,
1875, p. 1023-1024: pr?ti m?, wonach [I.] ein Lied [A.] bilden) to be valid
in the two
subsequent lines, and even in the last line (simplex pro composito) where
the verb is explicitly
given as mimate (viz. pr?ti), but the construction with instrumental is
continued from the
previous lines. (See further explanation in the article.)
