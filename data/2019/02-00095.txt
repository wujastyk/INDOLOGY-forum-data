Dear list members,
I am working on a very modest terminology and illustrated list of animals that occur in Buddhism. Unfortunately one, the Chinkara a (small gazelle) which repeatedly appears to either side of the Dharmachakra in most sculptures oof the first turning, does not appear to have a verifiable Sanskrit name. In essence, it is the "deer" of the 'deer park' translation of "m?gadava."
The creature depicted does not (or very rarely) has branched antlers (a deer characteristic) but gently curving horns which it does not shed (an antelope gazelle characteristic).
My sincere appreciation for any help or references.
Best to all
John
