The word k??h? (with first syllable nasalized, I think) is used in Bengal
(Bangla Desh; also West Bengal?) to refer to cloths with embroidered
narrative scenes. The work is presumably derived from Skt. kanthaa "rag,
patched garment" (MW; cf. CDIAL #2721, not citing the Bangla; also KEWA
I.151-2, comparing Lat. centoo "Flickwerk").
