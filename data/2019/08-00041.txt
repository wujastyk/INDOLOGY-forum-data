Dear list members,
Sheldon Pollock in his book  "A Rasa Reader" (page 85) comments on and
paraphrases a statement from the  K?vyala?k?ra of Rudra?a .  "Perhaps
Rudrata's most important contribution is the independence he shows in
challenging Bharata's traditional list: since any emotion can be "tasted",
the number of rasas is, he says, in principle limitless".
Can any list member give me the actual sanskrit verse (and verse number)
from Rudrata.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
