[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear All,
I noticed more than few times a misogynistic refusal to discuss, through
the list, of gender troubles within academia and India as well.
Discussions on gender discriminations are necessary if we want to start
contrasting sexism in academia. Otherwise, we can go on ignoring the issue.
Best,
Paolo
