Dear friends,

I would be grateful for recommendations of works addressing the manner in which the term g?th? is understood in connection with MIA verse, and analogously on doh? in connection with apabhraMza  and NIA verse. I am particularly looking for works dealing with formal features including meter, rhyme etc.

with thanks in advance,
Matthew
