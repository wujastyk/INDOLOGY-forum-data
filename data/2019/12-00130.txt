However, this quote is one of the several texts cited to argue that there are no real K?atriyas (and Vai?yas) in the Kali age.  The other famous quotes used in this debate are Pur??ic lines ????????? ????????????? and ??: ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????????, along with the story of Para?ur?ma exterminating the K?atriyas 21 times.

This quote was the basis for rejecting the K?atriyahood of some kings during the medieval times.
