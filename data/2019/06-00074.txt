Dear Mr Mellman,

Here at the U. of Alberta we currently run two courses: Introduction to
Sanskrit I, and Introduction to Sanskrit II.  These are each one-semester
courses (13 weeks, 3 or 4 one-hour meetings per week).  We use the
book Cambridge
Introduction to Sanskrit <http://cambridge-sanskrit.org/> and related
online materials by Antonia Ruppel. Sanskrit I covers about half of
Ruppel's book, 20 chapters.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
