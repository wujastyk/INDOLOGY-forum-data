[INDOLOGY] Date of Candranandana
Dear all,
thanks so much for this collective effort! Twiddling with Tibetan translations seems like a lot of fun that I?ve been missing out on so far!
Summarizing your suggestions, it appears the easiest, perhaps, to go with Snar-Thang?s (and Peking?s) ?sgrib byed??(thanks Peter and Paul!),?and to think of it as a translation of non-Sanskrit Thakkana (thanks Roland and Matthew!) Given that, for example,?sgrib cing is an attested rendering of Skt sthagita- (p. 724 in Lokesh Chandra?s Skt-Tib Dictionary), Roland?s suggestion to connect ?sgrib?with ?sthag?and to assume an intermediate step ? that is, Sthagana, a?Sanskritized form of Thakkana ? appears very likely.
In any case, the reading seems to strengthen our initial hypothesis (also pointed out by Matthew) that ?r?macchakuna- is indeed a corruption of??r?matthakkana-.
I think *?r?matthakkana- is more likely than *?r?matsthagana-, because in ??rad? (and in many other scripts) kka->ku is easier than ga-> ku, and because a corruption of a ?meaningless? non-Sanskrit form is much easier to explain than a corruption of a ?meaningless? Sanskrit one. Anyway, I hope that we will be able to consult Sanskrit MSS soon.
best,
Andrey
