Dear Herman,

It is not well known, but publishers do not have automatic rights to the copyright once a book goes into a second printing. An author has to formally request the rights at that point, but since most of us are unaware of that right, we rarely do.

This means we actually lose our right to distribute them, to reprint, etc. (whether we hold to this or not). In fact, if not for jstor, I would not have access to any of my old articles, reviews, etc. in electronic form. (And, here, too there are limits, as I believe the copyright transfers to jstor).
