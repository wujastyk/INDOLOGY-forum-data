[INDOLOGY] question about a soliciation from publisher MDPI
Dear Herman,
It is not well known, but publishers do not have automatic rights to the copyright once a book goes into a second printing. An author has to formally request the rights at that point, but since most of us are unaware of that right, we rarely do.
