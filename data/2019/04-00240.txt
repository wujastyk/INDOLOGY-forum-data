[INDOLOGY] Joydeep Bagchee's membership to INDOLOGY
Dear colleagues,
I am really perplexed as to why some members of this list found Dr.
Bagchee's post "much to the point" and "objective," while others (including
myself) just as clearly read it as violating the rules of the forum against
ad hominem attacks against scholars. We are supposed to make our livings by
reading texts. What is going on here?
The suggestion that we democratically discuss every instance where the
clearly-enunciated rules of the forum are violated will lead, inevitably,
to further instances of harrassment and defamation on the list, since those
who are inclined to conduct themselves in that way will only need an
opportunity and a halfway convincing justification for their remarks. Some
of us may think that there is not much to lose by allowing list members to
talk about the personal and professional lives of colleagues, who are not
members of the list and who can therefore not address the insinuations,
distortions, and name-calling in their remarks. Some may think that appeals
to "respect," "civility," and "professionalism" are simply ways of
silencing people with whom we have differences. I disagree. It is
unacceptable to tolerate ad hominem attacks on this forum.
