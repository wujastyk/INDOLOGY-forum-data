Dear Indology Listmembers,
I was wondering whether anyone could pass along a pdf copy of Yamaguchi's
1934 edition of Sthiramati's *Madhy?ntavibh?ga??k?*. Also, I would be
curious as to whether anyone has general thoughts about the reliability of
the emendations suggested in Stanley's 1988 dissertation (
https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/12988).
With gratitude,
Amit
