[INDOLOGY] Passing Away of Prof. Dr. Chlodwig Werba!
Dear Dr. Chakrabarti,
I am very sad to be informed about the premature passing away of Prof.
Chlodwig Werba, author of numerous articles in the domain of Vedic
(including on "prakritic wordforms in the Rgvedasamhita)
and Indo-european studies and especially of "Werba's Verba Indoiranica,
Part I".
He used to sanskritize his name as ?ruta-vega and write brief sentences in
Sanskrit -- for instance the dedication in the copy of his Verba
Indoiranica which he sent me in 1997/98 -- long before courses in spoken
and functional Sanskrit became fashionable.
Is there anywhere a list of his publications available online?
Condolences to his family, colleagues, friends and students.
Jan Houben

on p. ix of his Verba Indoiranica Chlodwig Werba quotes (I intentionally
use the present tense here)
a stanza in the Kath?mukha of the Pa?catantra
anantap?ra? kila ?abda??stra?
   svalpa? tath?yur bahava? ca vighn?? /
s?ra? tato gr?hyam ap?sya phalgu
   ha?sair yath? k??ram iv?mbumadhy?t //
For this he gives a liberal and metrical translation into English:
Since verbal science has no final end ;
   since life is short, and obstacles impend,
let central facts be picked and firmly fixed,
   as swans extract the milk with water mixed !
