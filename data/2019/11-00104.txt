[INDOLOGY] Intro to mathematics in Skt
Dear Friends,
It seems that you forgot to mention my name as an expert in Sanskrit 
mathematics, and also as an historian of mathematics.
I wrote my thesis in 2002 about the Sulbasutras and published in 2016 
(Droz, Geneva) an edition-translation-explanation (in French) of the 
Baudhayana's and its commentary by Dvarakanatha. I am always amazed by 
the way the Anglo-Saxon world ignores the French publication, even if 
they cite my good friend Fran?ois Patte, who also translates to French.
I wrote some articles in English (in that direction at least, we make 
some efforts as you can read) and gave a lecture in Oxford some years 
ago, when I had the opportunity to work for the philosophical part of my 
thesis with Jim Benson. Prof Gombrich attended the conference. I am 
nowadays working on mathematics at the court of Jai Singh II, and I 
visit Jaipur very often for that purpose.
Jesse, you can contact me if you need any special information, for I 
have probably the best library on Sanskrit mathematics in Belgium, which 
is of course nothing compared to the Indian Institute in Oxford, but who 
knows ?
