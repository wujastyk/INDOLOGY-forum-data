Dear List,
This is to inform you of a recent publication by one of our senior
colleagues Dr. *Ramkrishna Bhattacharya.*
*The Origin of Geometry in India: A Study in the ?ulbas?tras*
This book is the first complete study of the origin of geometry in India.
In Ancient India, brick-built fire-altars (citi-s) were ordained for the
Soma sacrifice, a Vedic rite, which led to the compilation of rule-books
for making and arranging bricks. These volumes, called ?ulbas?tra-s,
represent the first available texts of both geometry and mensuration, and
were composed from 600 BCE, although the actual practice goes back to c.
1500 BCE. This book begins by detailing the history of geometry in Egypt,
Mesopotamia, and Greece, and shows that geometry everywhere starts with
brick-built structures, rather than the measurement of land. It emphasizes
that geometry in India, unlike in Greece, was side-based rather than
angle-based. The text is profusely illustrated.
*Ramkrishna Bhattacharya* taught English at the University of Calcutta, and
served as an Emeritus Fellow of the University Grants Commission, India. He
is currently a Fellow of the Pavlov Institute, India. His publications
include Studies on the Carvaka/Lokayata (2009; 2011), and his papers on the
history of science in India have appeared in a number of international
journals.
