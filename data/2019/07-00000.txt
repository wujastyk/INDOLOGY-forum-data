Last year, it was Arnaud Fournet who attacked me, with the same fury you
have just been here. I thought this was too much, but the listmaster washed
his hands in innocence: "The list is not moderated." And I can't remember
*you* waxing indignant about this.

More people have asked that I be punished for being attacked. But that this
demand is made by the same person who had done the attacking, in multiple
violation of list rules, that might be new.

Yours regretfully,

KE
