[INDOLOGY] Query
A scholar who does no belong to this group asked me a question, and I draw a blank. ?I amlooking for a Hindu myth about a son's search for his father. Does something come to mind? Telemachus? search for Odysseus has triggered my quest.?
Any ideas will be deeply appreciated. With thanks and best wishes,
Patrick
