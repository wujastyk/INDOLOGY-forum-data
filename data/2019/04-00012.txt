[INDOLOGY] Sexism and Bias on INDOLOGY governing committee
Dear All
First, I want to clarify that I think these discussions are important--in
the context of Indology.
However, this list is not, in my opinion, the place to debate (etc)
institutional forms of discrimination, fundamentally important as they no
doubt are. There are so many things which so many of us are passionate
about, but this list is about Indian Studies, and while that surely
includes the conduct of the management of the list itself, the recently
discussed Sanskrit conference, and matters of that ilk, it does not
include, I would maintain,  German or Austrian higher education as a whole,
for example. So my plea to all of us is to focus on the topics relevant to
this list here, and find other fora for other conversations.
Thank you for listening,
Joanthan
