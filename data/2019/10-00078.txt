The Adisila font, developed Krishnaprasad and occasionally discussed on
this list, does have the ligature in question. Hopefully the attached image
comes through. The large number of "hacks" you've had to introduce to get
Devanagari MT to do the right thing suggests to me that a different font
might serve you better.
