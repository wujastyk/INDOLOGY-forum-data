[INDOLOGY] literature
Dear colleagues,
A colleague of mine has the following question:
Do you know academic publications (articles, book chapters, books) that trace literary motifs in cosmogonic myths diachronically from the Rig Veda to the Puranas?
Is there anyone who could suggest recent titles? Articles, books?
On behalf of my colleague many thanks
Regards
