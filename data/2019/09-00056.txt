Dear colleagues,
I have seen the magic of this list work before, so I am giving it a try.
I am writing to you on behalf of a friend who is looking for a scan of the
critical edition of the Vi??upur??a edited by Pathak. She is aware of the
etext by Peter Scharf, but she needs the page numbers to quote passages in
her thesis and it is not available at her library. If anyone has this
please contact me off-list. Thank you.
Pathak, M.M. ed., 1999. *The critical edition of the Vi??upur??am* (Vol.
2). Baroda: Oriental Institute.
Best,
Borayin
