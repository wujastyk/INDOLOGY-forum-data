[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear Paturiji,
     This quote in some medieval Dharma??stra works is interpreted to mean
that in the Kali Yuga, only the ?dya var?a [= Brahmins] and the aunty var?a
[= ??dras] survive, and that there are no true K?atriyas and Vai?yas.  This
quote was the basis for rejecting the K?atriyahood of some kings during the
medieval times.
