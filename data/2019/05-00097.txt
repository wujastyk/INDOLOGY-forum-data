[INDOLOGY] Concept of virya?
Dear learned colleagues,
I was wondering if anyone might recommend studies of the concept of *v?ra *or
*v?rya* in South Asian history. I am familiar with Jarrod Whitaker's book,
but was especially interested in how this term was later transformed by
renouncer traditions.
And, even better, has anyone looked at this concept's development in S.
Asia in comparison with the cognate terms *vir* and *virtus* in European
antiquity?
Many thanks,
Andrew
