Subject: [INDOLOGY] A manuscript written in unknown scripts
In-Reply-To: <CAMGmO4L-ZBy=wCHM=ykYnOLVjtpCsDYTKSL2ZVP_Eg1Q49OmJg@mail.gmail.com>

Just for information: these are indeed 61 volumes, of which reportedly 5 
sets were printed. This is the result of a project dedicated to the 
survey (and photography) of all palm-leaf mss in the TAR conducted 
between 2006 and 2011 under the direction of Prof. Tsewang Gyurme. 
Photographs of the cover pages of volume 1 and 61, as well as a 
photograph of the entire set, were reproduced in two 2014 issues of the 
journal "Tibet Palm-Leaf Manuscript Studies" (Lhasa). As Jonathan Silk 
rightly points out, neither scholars in the PRC nor foreign scholars 
have so far been able to officially access these volumes, let alone 
procure them.

The production of these volumes is by the way briefly discussed in Ernst 
Steinkellner's forthcoming paper "Sanskrit manuscripts on palm-leaves, 
paper and birch-bark in the TAR: What now?", delivered as a keynote 
lecture at the Beijing International Seminar on Tibetan Studies in 2016, 
to be published in the proceedings of the Sanskrit manuscripts panel at 
the Seminar edited by Jowita Kramer, Xuezhu Li and myself (Beijing: 
China Tibetology Publishing House).

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
