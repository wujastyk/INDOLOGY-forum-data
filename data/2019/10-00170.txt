[INDOLOGY] 'Gender and Sanskrit Studies' in Sanskrit
Dear Colleagues
The program (forthcoming) for the 2021 World Sanskrit Conference will include a new section, 'Gender and Sanskrit Studies'.
We would welcome any suggestions as to how this title might be elegantly translated into in Sanskrit itself.
Thanks in advance
