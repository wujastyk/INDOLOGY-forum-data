=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Mah=C4=81vastu_questions?=
Dear Valerie,
Might I suggest you read the following:
Tournier, Vincent. 2012. ?The Mah?vastu and the Vinayapi?aka of the Mah?s??ghika-Lokottarav?din.? Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University for the Academic Year 2011 15: 87?104.
???. 2017. La formation du Mah?vastu et la mise en place des conceptions relatives ? la carri?re du bodhisattva. Monographies 195. Paris: ?cole fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient.
You will learn among many other things that Mah?vastu-Avad?na is not a correct designation of the text.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths

[INDOLOGY] Mah?vastu questions
Dear Colleagues
(1) Does anyone know where there is a searchable Sanskrit text of the Mah?vastu Avad?na online? The one formerly at http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/buddh/mhvastuu.htm seems to have disappeared.
(2) Similarly with a searchable translation? The versions I?ve found of the J J Jones one are frustrating to use: see (3).
(3) Does anyone understand the verse and chapter numbering of this text? The text references and translation seem to use a completely different system.
(4) Has anyone got Basak?s text to hand? If so, I would be grateful to see copies of a couple of pages.
Many thanks -
