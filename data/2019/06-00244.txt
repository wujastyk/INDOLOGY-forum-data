[INDOLOGY] Supporting each other in public
Dear Koenraad,
You seem like a very angry person. I am saddened by that. We should all be
able to live our lives without fear, anger, or hatred.
I think you misunderstand me. I am no victim. I was merely a target, and a
convenient one at that. It is unfortunate that you feel victimized. It is a
liberating feeling to shirk off the bonds of victimhood and live life with
an open and optimistic heart and mind.
I wish you the best, but I am sending all your emails to my spam folder
henceforth.
Patricia
