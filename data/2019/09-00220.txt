Dear List Members,A friend of mine, not on the list, has asked me to send you this query regarding a portrait of Sylvain Levi (see attachment). His name and e-mail address are also given.Best wishes,Catherine Clementin-Ojha 
While conducting research on the biography of Sylvain L?vi (1863-1935), professor of Sanskrit language and literature at the Coll?ge de France, historian of Buddhism, I discovered this oil portrait of Sylvain L?vi when he was about sixty years old. There is no signature on this painting. I haven't found anything that would allow me to identify it, to date it precisely. I would therefore be grateful to anyone who could help me put a name to the artist who painted this portrait of Sylvain L?vi.Roland Lardinois, National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Center for South Asian Studies, EHESS, Paris (roland.lardinois at gmail.com)
