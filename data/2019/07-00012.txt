[INDOLOGY] indological events at ICAS-11 at Leiden, 15-19 July 2019
Dear All , One of several indology-related ICAS-events features young
scholars not theorizing or preaching but exploring through their own effort
new ways of practicing Indology. I have accepted a request by my old friend
Dr. Paul van der Velde, ICAS-organizer since the first ICAS in
Leiden-Noordwijkerhout in 1998, to chair their panel "Oriental Studies &
New Ways of Practicing Indology" (18 July, morning) as I believe the
initiative is admirable and deserves a fair chance (see below).
The panel Visual Asian Studies: Vedic Ritual in India & Nepal is on 19 July
afternoon (see below).
For more information and several other indology-related events see the
online program (136 pages):

In this panel in honour of two pioneers in filming Vedic ritual, J.A.B. van
Buitenen (1928-1979) and Frits Staal (1930-2012), Vedic ritual is studied,
not, as usual, primarily and almost exclusively on the basis of texts, but
primarily on the basis of video-recordings of performances, which reveal
the structure of Vedic performances in a more easily accessible way.
As for publication, some of our clips will appear on the "Vedic Ritual"
channel set up at VIMEO: https://vimeo.com/channels/vedicritual
