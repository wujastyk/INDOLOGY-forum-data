[INDOLOGY] Macro languages.
Of the Indo-Aryan language category, prevalent&nbsp; in&nbsp; India, it has been known that the combination -Punjabi-Hindi-Bihari-Rajasthani-Pahari form a group of Macrolanguages.I was interested to know about similar instances prevalent in European languages,if at all, there exists any such&nbsp; categorisation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alakendu Das.
