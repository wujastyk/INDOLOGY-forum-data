Dear Dominik,
Maybe you have a look at the Jaina lesy?s, which are given different colours.

Students are asking me for readings for their essays, and I'm slightly stumped for good suggestions on these two.  Can anyone point to some good studies of these topics?
I am particularly interested in colour readings in relation to the health sciences and alchemy, but anything will do!  I know about Martha Selby's 2005 "Narratives of Conception" article and its remarks on red/white distinctions in ayurveda.
Regarding the senses, I haven't yet checked the Brill encyclopedia, and I will.  Probably there's something in Dasgupta, Hist. Indi. Philosophy.
Any suggestions will be much appreciated.
Best,
Dominik
