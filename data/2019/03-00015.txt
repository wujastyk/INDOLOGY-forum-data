I am pleased to announce the publication of&nbsp;Self, Sacrifice, and Cosmos: Vedic Thought, Ritual, and Philosophy, ed. Lauren M. Bausch (Delhi:&nbsp;Primus&nbsp;Books, 2019). 'Contributions range widely across critical topics in early, middle, and late Vedic texts and their commentaries, as well as classical themes in contemporary Sanskrit literature. Essays elucidate the explanations and arguments found in Br?hma?a texts, the historical and ecological development of Vedic ritual, concepts and underlying messages in Vedic texts, anachronisms in commentarial exegesis, and literary devices in narrative. From a variety of philological, philosophical, ritual, gender, and literary approaches, these articles shed new light on our understanding of these seminal texts of Indian religion and philosophy. This book is dedicated to the life and work of Professor G.U. Thite.'
In addition to a biography of Prof. Thite, the volume features eleven articles by eminent scholars:
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timothy Lubin, 'Br?hma?a as Commentary'2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna Jurewicz, 'The Consistency of Vedic Argument'3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ganesh Umakant Thite, 'The Role of Br?hma?a-texts in the Development of Vedic Ritual'4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephanie W. Jamison, 'Vedic Ritual: The Sacralization of the Mundane and the Domestication of the Sacred'5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel P. Brereton, 'The Heavenly Sea'6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauren M.
