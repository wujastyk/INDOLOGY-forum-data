Dear Simon,

And on the Indo-european dh?, check https://academiaprisca.org/indoeuropean.html <https://academiaprisca.org/indoeuropean.html>

Root / lemma: dh?-2

English meaning: to put, place

Material: Old Indian d?dh?ti, av. da??iti `he places', Old pers. Impf. Sg. adad? `he has installed', Old Indian Aor.?-dh?-m `I placed', Med. 3. Sg. ?-dhita (= gr. ?????) ; to-participle Old Indian hit??? (-dhit??? in ved. compounds) `set, settled' (= lat. con-ditus, ab-ditus, cr?ditus, probably also gr. ????? `sedate, calm, settled, placed, set; having position; taken as one's child, adopted'), with full grade av. Old pers. d?ta- (= lit. d??tas `sedate, calm, settled', Old Prussian sen-ditans Akk. Pl. f. `folded', also gr. ????? ????? Hes., eig. `set raised platform, placed stand'); Inf. Old Indian dh??-tum (= lit. d??t? Supin., Old Church Slavic d?t? `to place' : lat. [late] conditus, -?s m. `pickled, preserved; of corpses, embalmed; in gen., seasoned, savory', Supin. -um, -?, compare also Old Indian dh??tu-?), m. `component, set', av. v???tu- n. `grounds, rationale, steady acquiescence'); i?o-present Old Indian dh?yat? `places for oneself' (= lett. d?ju, d?t `place, lay eggs', d?ju d?t `solder together', Old Church Slavic d?j? `lay, place', a?ech. d?ju `make'); Perf. Old Indian dadh??u, dadhim?, av. 3. Sg. da?a (: gr. ???????, lat. -did?, osk. pr?-ffed, ahd. teta etc).

Arm. ed Aor. `he placed' (= Old Indian ?-dh?t; 1. Sg. edi, 2. Sg. edir), present dnem `I place'(*dinem, idg. *dh??no-, compare russ. d??nu `sit, put, lay, place', skr. dj?n?m `do, put, lay');

Maybe nasalized alb. geg. me ndenj`to sit, while, stay', ndej `hang lose, place'

phryg. ????? `has placed' (*e-dh?-es-t? rather = hitt. da-a-i?);

gr. ?????? `put' (Aor. ????? - see under -, ??????, ?????, Fut. ????, participle ?????);

messap. hi-pa-of `has placed' (*?hi-po-dh?s-t, J. B. Hofmann KZ. 63, 267);

lat. abdere `put away, remove, set aside, stow away', con-dere `to put together, make by joining, found, establish, build, settle' (in addition C?nsus [*kom-d-to-] an ancient deity, god of secret plans), perdere `to make away with, destroy, ruin, squander, dissipate, throw away, waste, lose', cr?dere `believe, trust' (see below *kered- `heart'); about the interference of dare with respective forms s. WH. I 362; Perf. condid? etc, osk. pr?-ffed `has placed' (*-fefed).

Note:

Common italic.-lat. d- > f- shift.

With einer k-extension lat. faci?, -ere, fec? (: ?????), factum `to make, form, do, perform; of feelings and circumstances, to cause, bring about', osk. fakiiad, umbr. fac?ia `he/she makes, constructs, fashions, frames, builds, produces, composes', fakurent Fut. II [subjunctive] `they will have made, constructed, fashioned, framed, erected, produced, composed', praen. (passionate inscription) FheFhaked `he/she has made, constructed, fashioned, framed, erected, produced, composed', osk. fefacit Konj. Perf. `let he/she have made, constructed, fashioned, framed, erected, produced, composed', fefacust Fut. II `he/she will have made, constructed, fashioned, framed, erected, produced, composed';

with *f?k- umbr. feitu, fetu [Imperative]`he/she will have made, constructed, fashioned, framed, erected, produced, composed':

facilis `(feasible) easy to do; easy to manage, convenient, favorable', umbr. fac?efele ds.; faci?s `shape, form, figure, outward appearance; esp. face, countenance. Transf., character, nature; seeming, pretence', facinus, ponti-fex, arti-fex bene?ficus under likewise; to meaning of interfici? `to put out of the way, destroy, bring to naught, slay, kill' (`*allow to disappear') compare Old Indian antar?hita?? `vanished'.

The same k-extension besides in gr. ????? also in ???? `receptacle', Old Indian dh?-k?-? `container' and phryg. ??-????? `afflicts, causes death', Med. ??-???????; ven. vha?s?o `he/she makes, constructs, fashions, frames, builds, erects, produces, composes' (*fak?s?to, the f probably from Ital.); hitt. dak-ki-e?-zi (dakkeszi) `makes, places down' (: lat. facess?), dak-?u-ul (daksul) `friendly' (: alat. facul); perhaps toch. A t?k? `I was, became', B tak?w? ds. (different Pedersen Toch. 194);

gall. dede `he/she has placed'; compare lat. con-, ab-, cr?-did?, ahd. teta `I made, did'; air. -tarti `gives, yields' (*to-ro-ad-d?t from *dh??t), Perf. do-rat (*to-ro-ad-dat from *dh?-t), Thurneysen Gr. 35;

ahd. t?m, tuom, as. t?n, ags. d?m `do', Inf. ahd. tuon, as. ags. d?n (*dh??m) `do', preterit ahd. teta `I made, did' (2. Sg. t?ti, Pl. t?tu?m; reshaped after the type of got. s?tum), as. deda (2. Sg. ded?s, 3. Pl. d?dun, dedun), ags. dyde < dudi (see above to Old Indian dadh??u); particle Perf. Pass. ahd. gi?t?n, ags. d?n `done' from *dh?-no- = Old Church Slavic o-d?n? `wrapped, dressed';

in the ending of reduced Pr?ter. (got. salb?-d?dun etc) one tries to seek mostly the root dh?-, whereas in got. kun?a `granted', must contain the idg. -t-, to accept an other formation. compare Hirt, Idg. Gr. IV, 99, Sverdrup NTS. 2, 55 ff., Marstrander, NTS. 4, 424 f., Specht KZ. 62, 69 ff., Kretschmer Sbb. Wien, 225. Bd., 2. Abh., 6 f.

lit. d??ti `lay, place, put', present 2. Pl. old deste (*dhe-dh-te), Sg. dem?, desie-s, dest(i) (compare B?ga Kalba ir s. 158, 213), neologism ded?; lett. d?t (see above);

Old Church Slavic d?ti `lay, place' (also `say'), present de?d? (*dedi??) and d?j? (see above); d?j?, d?jati `lay, place, do'; -va-iterative Old Church Slavic o-d?vati `(to put), dress', russ. d?v?t? `set down, do, place';

in addition probably lit. d?vi?, d?v??ti `wear a dress'; a formant u? also in gr. *??F???? and (assim.) *??F????, compare ????? `sit, put', ion. ????? (hom. ?????? written for ??[F]????) `seat', ??????? ????? ? ?????? Hes., att. also ????? ds., hom. ?????? `sit', att. poet. ?????? ds. (see to gr. group Bechtel Lexil. 161 f., Boisacq 335); compare also thrak. -dava `settling, settlement' from *dh?u?? or *dh?u??; probably reshuffling after the concurrent *d?-: *dou- `bestow, give';

Note:

The suffix -dava `settling, settlement' frequently scattered over the thrak. territory and city names is absent in illyr. toponyms, hence illyr.-alb. and trak. were two different people.

hitt. da?a?i (d?i) `setzt, legt', 1. Sg. te-e?-?i (tehhi), 3. Pl. ti?an?zi (Pedersen Hitt. 91, 112 f., 166), preterit 3. Sg. da-a-i?; perhaps also dak-ki-e?-zi (see above);

toch. A t?-, t?s-, tas-, B tes- `lay, place' (*dh??s- Pedersen Toch. 186 f.);

lyk. ta- `lay, place' (Pedersen. Lyk. and Hitt. 30 f.).

Root nouns (in compositions): e.g. Old Indian vay?-dh??-? `imparting vitality', sa?-dh?? f. `pact, agreement, promise' (: lit. arkl??d? `stable'), sa?-dh-?-m `association' (: lit. sam-das), ratna-dh-?-? `imparting treasure', ni?dh???? m. `container, treasure, tribute', sam-dh-?-? m. `association, covenant, fusion', av. gao-?i- `milk container'; lit. samdas `rent, rental', i?das `vessel', nuoda? `poison', (old) n?od?ia `debt, blame, offense', p?dis `the hen lays an egg';

Old Prussian umnode `bakehouse', lit. pel?d?, lett. pelude `chaff container', Old Church Slavic ob?-do n. `????????', s?-d? `??????, ?????'; compare Berneker 193 ff., Trautmann 47 f.; if so also aisl. oddr, ags. ord, ahd. ort `cusp, peak' as *ud-dho-s `pointed up'?

nominal formation:

Old Indian dh??tar- m. `instigator, founder', dh?t?r- `creator, god' (compare also Old Church Slavic d?tel? `perpetrator'), gr. ?????, lat. con-ditor `a founder; hence, in gen., contriver, composer, author';

compare *dh?-tlo- in air. d?l, acymr. datl, ncymr. dadl, abret. dadl `congregation, meeting', nbret. dael `contest, quarrel' (compare to meaning phryg. ??????);

*dh?-ti- in Old Indian -dhiti-? f. `stead', d?v?-hiti-? `God's statute', gr. ????? f. `statute, order', lat. con-diti-? f. `an agreement, stipulation, condition, compact, proposition, terms, demand'; *dh?-ti-s in av. ni-??iti- f. `laying down, putting away, hiding', got. gad?ds `deed, position, place', aisl. d?? `skillfulness, deed, act', ags. d?d, ahd. t?t `deed, act', lit. d??tis `load, burden', Pl. d??tys `lay of the chicken, the goose', Old Church Slavic blago-d?t? `Grace, blessing, gratitude'; *dh?-t- in thrak. PN ?????, alb. dhat? (*dh?-t?) `site'; *dh?-t- in av. dami-d?-t `the created creature', lat. sacer-d?s `a priest, priestess' (*sacro-dh?t-s).

Old Indian dh?na-m `container', el. ???????? (?) `pact, covenant', ahd. participle git?n, ags. d?n `done', Old Church Slavic o-d?n? `(completed), vested'; Old Indian dh?na?m `sacrifice, offering, price in competition etc', nidh?nam `layover, stay, inhabitation etc', g?dhana-m `cattle possession', av. gao-?ana- n. `milk container'.

(also fem.) `constituting, originating, creator, god'; gr. ????? `that which is laid down or established by custom', Gen. originally ???????? `*allowed by the laws of God and men, righteous' as Goddess's name, then `right, law, custom', ??????? Pl. `the foundation of a building; the innermost, core', ???????? ????? `the foundation-stones', hom. ???????? (?? metr. lengthening) `the foundations, lowest part, bottom, ground';

Alb. themel `the foundation of a building; the innermost, core' : hom. ???????? (?? metr. lengthening) `foundation, ground' [probably a loanword]; them?n `heel, bottom of the foot'.

zero grade: ???? `*massed; frequent, often', ??????? `frequent, often, massed', hom. ??????, femin. ??????? Pl. `the piled up, tightly packed, crowded, close-set, thick' (from *?????), ?????? `thicket, shrubbery, bush, shrub'; in a *dh?-mo- `settlement, branch, dwelling' (compare ?????? ?????, ??????, ?????? Hes. [*dh?mi?o-], also Old Indian dh?man- `dwelling') or `heap, troop, multitude, crowd (the servant)' correlates one perhaps rightly also with lat. famulus `a servant, a male slave, attendant', familia `a household (of slaves), establishment', osk. famel `a servant, a male slave, attendant', famelo `a household (of slaves), establishment', umbr. fame?ias `a household (of slaves), establishment';

Note:

Common lat. d- > f- shift

?-grade gr. ????? `heap, barn, haystack'; phryg. ?????? `an assembly, meeting, congress, a living together', lat. ab-d?men `lower abdomen' as `intimate, hidden, secret part', compare ahd. intuoma `the chief internal organs of the body, significant organs' (would be lat. *ind?men), mnd. inged?me, bayr. ingetum ds., got. d?ms m. `judgement, fame' (d?mjan `adjudicate'; from dem Germ. russ. d?ma `thought, notion, care; council meeting' etc, s. Berneker 237), ags. d?m `opinion, sense, mind, judgement, court', ahd. tuom `judgement, feat, deed, act, custom, state, status', lit. dom??, domes?s `attention, directing of the thought and will on something', also lit. d?m?? `spot upon which attention is directed' etc, d?m??tis = dom??tis `wonder, care, concern, follow, go, take interest'.

Aisl. d?ll `easy to do, easy, without difficulty' (*dh?-li-s); compare urnord. dalidun `they did' (preterit of germ. *d?lian), lit. pa-d?l?s `nest-egg (the hen lays an egg)', pried?l??, pr?ed?lis `inclosure', abg. d?lo n. `work', wherefore (see Berneker 195 f., Trautmann 48) Old Church Slavic d?lja, d?lj?ma m. Gen. `because of', lit. d??l, del?, d??liai, lett. d?l `with Gen. `because of, for the sake of'.

Maybe from Slavic ne `not' + Old Church Slavic: d?lo `work, matter' = Bulgarian ?????? (nedel'a), Serbian nedelja, Czech ned?le, Polish niedziela `Sunday, holiday = no work' : Lithuanian: d?lioti `put down, away' : Albanian djel? `Sunday, holiday'.

An occasional formation compare still gr. ?????? (Pind.), ?????? (lak. etc), ?????? (att.) `statute' after Thurneysen (KZ. 51, 57) to air. dedm, cymr. deddf (*dhe?dh?m?) ds. (different Schwyzer Gr. Gr. I 49212); ???, att. ???: `punishment'. Very doubtful a s-extension would be attributed to aisl. des (*dasj?) `hay stick, hay rick' (Lw. from dem Air.?), air. dais (*dasti-) `heap, hay rick', wherewith E. Lewy (KZ. 52, 310) compares rather osset. dasun `pile up, lump'.

Root / lemma: dh?-3, dh?-

English meaning: to disappear

German meaning: `hinschwinden'?

Material: Lat. fam?s f. `hunger', ad fatim, affatim `ad lassitudinem, zur Gen?ge', fat?g? `hetze ab, erm?de', fat?sc?, -or `gehe auseinander; ermatte';

Note: common lat. d- > f- shift

air. ded- (present ru?deda, Fut. Plur. dedait, preterit con-ro-deda) `vanish, pass away, die away, disappear, dwindle, waste away, melt, decay'; ags. demm `damage' (*dh?-mi-s);

with -s anord. d?si `idle' (germ. *d??s-), mhd. d?sic `still, uncommunicative, stupid', changing through ablaut norw. dial. dase `flabby person', d?n. dase `be decayed'; anord. d?sa(sk) `swelter, decay', dasask `go bad, get worse'; mengl. dasen `stun' (engl. daze), dasewen `be dark'.

In all parts some dubious connections. About air. de?d(a). compare Pedersen KG. II 504 f.(from Perf. *dhe-dou?e from to got. diwans `perishable'? s. dheu- `disappear', where also about air. d?th, arm. di). The germ. family finally reminds partly under *dheu?es- `whisk' discussed from ndd. d?sig and have been directed partly after this not only in the s-extension, but also in the meaning itself; at least, is to be reckoned on an old relationship from anord. d?esask etc. and ir. -deda .
