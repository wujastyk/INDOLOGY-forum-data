[INDOLOGY] microfilm
Dear Friends,
I am trying to track down a copy of this book, which is only, it seems,
available on microfilm in the USA.
*Sapre, Lakshama?a N?r?ya?a. 1922. Mallakh?mba. Pu??: ?a?kara N?r?ya?a
Jo?? *

I've never done anything with microfilm before, so I'm a bit confused by
the process of the interlibrary thing as well. But, before I commit to
spending $1.30 per page (172pp), I'm wondering if anyone might already have
this as a pdf?
Thanks.
All the best,
