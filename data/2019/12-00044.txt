[INDOLOGY] Problem with indology list
Dear list members,
It looks like some messages sent to the Indology list don't come through to
me.  For example: there are two messages from Manu Francis that are
archived from early this morning but I didn't receive them.  Does anyone
else have this problem?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
