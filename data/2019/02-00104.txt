=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_manuscript(s)_of_the_Artha=C5=9B=C4=81stra?=
Dear colleagues,
For purposes of use in classroom, I would be grateful if anyone could share one or more photos of one or more manuscripts of Kau?ilya's Artha??stra ? it would be ideal if I could illustrate both Kangle's D and one of the South Indian manuscripts.
Thank you.
