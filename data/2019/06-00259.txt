[INDOLOGY] About Godwin
The wiki article is quite informative. Remarkably, Godwin apparently does not oppose calling racists what they are.
Thanks for the reference, Patricia.

Dear Dean,
It's a reference to Godwin's law<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law>, "if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds".

Could you please clarify your point for us who are Godwin-deprived?
Best,
Dean

yes, I agree that jerks who overuse the word "far-right" should rather
create their own list somewhere else.
