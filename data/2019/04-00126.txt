Dear Matthew,

Alsdorf?s article is indeed on combinatorics in the metrical literature,
not in mathematics?
as for combinatorics in music there is notably in French

Patte, Fran?ois. 2012. ?Rythmes et Algorithmes.? In *Astronomy and
Mathematics in Ancient India - Astronomie et Math?matiques de l?Inde
Ancienne Actes de La Journ?e d??tudes Organis?e Le 24 Avril 2009 ?
l?Universit? Libre de Bruxelles*, edited by Jean-Michel Delire, 159?174.
Peeters.

and recently
Petrocchi Alessandra. 2018. ?Music Theory, Mathematics, and Patterns of
Innovation in the Sa?g?taratn?kara.? *Asiatische Studien - ?tudes
Asiatiques* 72 (2): 395. https://doi.org/10.1515/asia-2016-0003.

Thank you Agathe,


I wasn't intending to refer to Indian mathematics broadly, but just to the
application outside of mathematics per se. Besides poetic metrics and
"tantric geometry", I imagine that the musicological literature offers some
other examples, but i do not know them off hand.


best,

Matthew

Dear Matthew,

On the topic of combinatorics (including Pascal triangle), Pi?gala and his
commentators  there is a classical article by Ludwig Alsdorf

 Die Pratyayas. Ein Beitrag zur indischen Mathematik". Zeitschrift fur
Indologie und Iranistik, 9 (1933), pp. 97-157; reprinted in: Albrecht
Wezler (ed.), Ludwig Alsdorf: Kleine Schriften, Wiesbaden, 1974, pp.
600-660.

This paper was translated into English by  Sarma, S. R. 1991. ?The
Pratyayas: Indian Contributions to Combinatorics.? Indian Journal of
History of Science 26: 17?61.

although much still needs to be investigated, there are quite a number of
publications on this topic  actually?

Dear Paolo,


Although it is not quite on tantra, there is a highly interesting article
in modern Sanskrit on the relationship between Sanskrit analysis of poetic
metre and Pascal's triangle. I do not have the full reference available in
my present location, but it may be found in the introduction to the late
Michael Hahn's edition of the ChandoratnAkara, which may be available on
his academia page, if that is still accessible.



In Buddhist tantra, quite a lot has been written on the mathematics of the
KAlacakratantra. The late Edward Henning's webpage kalacakra.org has some
useful material on this, as does Henning's book, KAlacakra and the Tibetan
Calendar.


There is also quite a lot on this in German, by Dieter Schuh, but
exclusively concerned with the Tibetan legacy of the Indian sources and not
with the Indian materials themselves.


best,

Matthew

Dear indologists,

Can anyone points me out any study on Tantra in connection to sciences,
mathematics and more specifically geometry?

With the best wishes,
Paolo
