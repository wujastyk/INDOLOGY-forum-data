=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_n=C4=81=E1=B9=ADya=C5=9B=C4=81stra_citation?=
Dear Harry,
At this moment I do not have the opportunity to check, but I think Pollock(?) refers to Vol. I of the Baroda edition, page -- not verse -- 282. Besides verses, the rasa chapter consists of prose passage, which might explain references to page numbers.  Also, check if the author refers to the original edition or the revised one, in which case the page numbers may differ.
Beste wishes, Herman

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] n??ya??stra citation
Dear list members,
On page 49 of the Rasa Reader quotes a sentence from the n??ya??stra .
"Discerning viewers relish the stable emotions manifested by the acting out of various transitory emotions and ractions . . . they feel joy and the like in doing so".  He cites n??ya??stra 1.282 as the source (footnote 9), Further back on the page he cites n??ya??stra  1.342  but there are only 127 verses in chapter one.
Am I missing something or are these verse numbers cited incorrect.  If so can someone give me the correct citing for the sentence from Pollock that I quoted above.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
