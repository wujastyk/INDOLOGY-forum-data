[INDOLOGY] Hobson Jobson Dictionary
Dear Gaia,
I do not know for what purpose you need Hobson Jobson. If it is for Indian words in English, you might also have a look at
G. Subba Rao, Indian Words in English. A Study of Indo-British Cultural and Linguistic Relations. Oxford 1969 (originally published  1954.)

Dear list members,
Is there an edition/reprint of the Hobson Jobson dictionary you would recommend above all others?
I am interested in acquiring a hard copy of it.
I see that in 2013 a *selected edition* appeared, edited by Kate Teltscher, but I would like to get hold of an *unabridged* one.
NB: I am aware of the online resource that is hosted on the website of the University of Chicago as well as of the existence of a freely available pdf, but I am actually in search of an old-style book.
I shall be grateful for any tips.
With best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
