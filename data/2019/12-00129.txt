[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear Dan,
     The reading ???????????? ??????? is most likely a misprint for
??????????????
???????, which looks like a p?da of an Anu??ubh verse.  I have never seen a
complete verse.  However, this quote is one of the several texts cited to
argue that there are no real K?atriyas (and Vai?yas) in the Kali age.  The
other famous quotes used in this debate are Pur??ic lines ?????????
????????????? and ??: ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????????, along with the
story of Para?ur?ma exterminating the K?atriyas 21 times.
