[INDOLOGY] Kusumamala at USA inter library loan help
Dear all
I have now confirmed the worth of the first edition.
After the 6th edition, the Kusumamala has been revised and curtailed which
specifically mentioned on the cover page and also in itse preface.
But the reason being only to meet the course duration of one year.
All the important passages of Sanskrit literature of all possible
expressions were initially collected by VS Apte. Only to meet the classroom
requirements the curtailed edition was introduced with missing important
passages and verses from classical literature.
If anyone could help to procure the first edition, I will be grateful to
you.
Thanks and regards
Krishna Prasad
