Actually the printed edition of the BORI edition does include the equivalent numbers of the Calcutta edition.

Cheers,

Thank you Mahdav,

I just realized that also :-)

Would anyone know a link to a pdf of the Calcutta edition.

Thanks,

If I am not mistaken, B-R refer to the Calcutta edition of the Mah?bh?rata that predates the BORI critical edition. Tokunaga's version is the digitization of the BORI edition.

Dear list members,

I'm trying to trace some Mahabharata references in  B?htlingk and Roth but i"m not clear how to translate their referencing format to whats in the GRETIL edition from Muneo Tokunaga revised by John Smith. The B-R references are a digit (book number?) followed by a 5 digit number. For example, in B-R a Mahabharata reference is 3, 16461 but there is no 03,164.061 in the Tokunaga edition.

Any help in how to translate the B-R references to the Tokunaga verse numbering system would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
