[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Compounds: A Philosophical Study
Dear colleagues,
Thanks to Dr. Arjun Kashyap for the link, which is
http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/70988?mode=full in case
others are interested. I believe there may have been a temporary server
issue preventing the download, but I've now been able to download the PDF.
If anyone else cannot, I'm happy to send it.
Best,
Malcolm
