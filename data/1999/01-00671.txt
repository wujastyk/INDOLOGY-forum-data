30th January, 1948 -- Mahatma Gandhi assassinated
Just thought it would be important to remember this day.
-Partha Banerjee
On the 30th of January 1948, within less than a year of the Indian
independence, Nathuram Godse, a Hindu zealot from the western Indian state
of Maharashtra, shot and killed Mahatma Gandhi at a prayer meeting in
Delhi.  Nathuram Godse was a prominent member of the RSS and a close
associate of its founder Dr. K. B. Hedgewar.  Just before the
assassination, however, Godse "left" the RSS and joined another Hindu
supremacist group Hindu Mahasabha.
Footnote:  What is the truth about Godse's RSS connection? ...  Godse
himself had stated before the Court: "I have worked for several years in
RSS and subsequently joined the Hindu Mahasabha..." (Godse, Gopal: "May it
Please Your Honour: Statement of Nathuram Godse").  The most significant is
the revelation by his brother about the last moments of his life: "On
reaching the platform they recited a verse of devotion to the Motherland:
"Namaste sada vatsale matribhume..." [This is the RSS prayer sung even
today - PB].  The above is quoted from D. R. Goyal: Rashtriya Swayamsewak
Sangh .  Radha Krishna Prakashan.  New Delhi.  1979.
