history. From the blurb: "... Hoffman reconstructs the lost wold of East
European Jewry up until its final days.  She explores the rich culture and
institutions of Polish Jews, and looks at the forms of multicultural
coexistence during several centuries, the shades of prejudice and
tolerance, and the phases of conflict and comity.  By probing the deep
ambivalence that coloured relations between Poles and Jews on the eve of
World War II, Shtetl throws new light on motives which influenced
Christian villagers' decisions to rescue or betray their Jewish neighbours
when the Nazis invaded."
