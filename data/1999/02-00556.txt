It shows how misinformed are you of the status of Chinese software. There
are more internet sites in China than in India and they produce more
software (mostly pirate) than any other country regardless of the script of
their native language.

Learning two scripts is not a very difficult task and as a matter of fact helps
in compartmentalizing two languages.
