Q: Sakasthan Numismatics
Answer to  second question of Samar Abbas  regarding 'Ilsamistan'
'Mughalstan'  etc.  there is Islamabad in Pakistan, and Allahabad in India.
Pakistan also falls in the same category.  I have never seen any reference
to "Islamistan" or "Mughalstan" or "Urdustan" - who came up with these
names?
Thank you.
