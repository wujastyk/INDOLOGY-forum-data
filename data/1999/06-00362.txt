Original Dravidian Homeland
I think it was Henry Heras who first suggeted that the
fish signs in IVC seals represent 'star' as in Tamil.
Does Hungarian meny (a kind of fish) and menny (heaven)
come from a verb something to do with brightness or shining?
Ta. mIn (star and fish) comes from the verb "min" (to shine,
to be bright etc.,). Compare Ta. 'minnal' = lightning.
