YOURI MARTINI
VIA ROMA 51
18010 SANTO STEFANO AL MARE
IMPERIA
ITALIA


            My name is Youri Martini. I am a student
of the last course of modern history at the University
of Genova (Italy).
At the moment I'm getting together all kind of
materials and authentic documents concerning the
catholic churches and their movement of evangelization
in India (XVI and XVII century) in order to write my
degree thesis.
My work is based on the analysis of "Gentilesimo
cofutato", a book written by a benedectin monk, don
Clemente Tosi, in 1669. I think this text was used as
a handbook by catholic missionaries going to India.
The main problem is my own deep ignorance of the
actual location of towns and provinces in the ancient
India Mughal.In addiction to it, the names of towns
and provinces, as we find them reported in
"Gentilesimo
confutato", are spelled in ancient Italian according
to
the way they were pronounced and not as they were
actually written at the time and maybe nowadays as
well. I therefore find myself without any positive
geographical reference.
I enclose a list including all towns and provinces
quoted in the book, in order to give You a more
detailed idea of what I mean.
Moreover  I'd like to have as many pieces of
information as You can find, concerning the
historical, economical and political background about
the towns and provinces I mentioned above,dating back
to Aurangzeb's time.
Looking forward to receiving Your found answer .



Yours  faithfully
Youri Martini
