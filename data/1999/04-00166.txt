Day is night in Dravidian?

Entering the word "naks2atra"  in the "English" field of the search
menu for the Cologne Online Tamil Lexicon at
http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/otl_search.html
returns 200 entries many with the suffix "nAL" or "n2AL".
Another very interesting point to note is the Tamil names
for the asterisms pushed out of currency by Skt. names.
Sample:
maruttuvanAL = asvini
aRivan2AL = the 26th naks2atra  (uttara prostapada)
erinAL, Al, Aral = the third naks2atra  (krittika);
[Al and Aral occur frequently in CT]
nIrnAL = the 20th naks2atra  (Purvashada)
mAyOn2AL, ONam  = the 22nd naks2atra  (shravana or Ta. ONam)
[mAyOn2 = Skt. vishnu]
jnemali = the 10th naks2atra (magha) = dog
vIzkkai = the 15th naks2atra  (Svati)
nAvAy, paHRi = rEvati
[nAvAy = ship; paHRi = round boat]
