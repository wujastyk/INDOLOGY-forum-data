According to the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition, even more recently, about 500
years ago, there was the instruction of Rupa and Sanatana Goswamis by the
divine incarnation Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu related in the Sri
Caitanya-caritamrta by Krishna das Kaviraj Goswami.  The Goswamis were so
inspired by Lord Caitanya's inspiration they went on to compile many books
on the practice of Krishna-bhakti based on their study of the revealed
scriptures.
