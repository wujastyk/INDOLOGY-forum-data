    * trilingual inscription from Sri Lanka

 Dear Colleagues--
         I have just come across an inscription, published in Epigraphia
 Zeylanica, vol 3 (1928-33), called the "Galle Trilingual Slab" which was
 discovered in Galle in 1911.  It records the gift of gold, silver, cloth,
 etc. for worship, and is written in Tamil, Persian, and Chinese.  The
 epigraphist (S. Paranavitana), along with earlier interpreters, regards
 the object of worship is being different in the case of each of the three
 records (a Hindu deity, a Muslim saint, and the Buddha, respectively),
 but this seems to me highly unlikely.
         I wonder if any of you know whether further examinations of this
 inscription have been made since the time of its publication in EZ, or
 whether further scholarship on the religious context of Sri Lanka in
 the period of the inscription (c. 1400 AD) might illuminate its
 significance.
         Thank you for any suggestions or information you may have.
                         Best wishes             --Leslie Orr
