Aurobindo about Advaita
With this respect to Ramanuja, this is completely false.
Ramanuja is mentioned in epigraphy in Karnataka many times.
See  Gopal, B. R. (Balakrishnan Raja), 1930-
     Sri Ramanuja in Karnataka : an epigraphical study
     Delhi : Sundeep Prakashan, 1983.
There may be others in Tamil as well.
