naa.dii (was: Paishaacika Sanskrit?)
Dear Mr. Gantsen,
There are several families of Saiva Vellalas practising
Naa.dii in TiruvaanaikkAval in Tiruchy Town and
Vaidheeswaran Koil in Thanjavur district. This
tradition is their hereditary profession. I am not aware
of naaDii as a family tradition among Smartas.
For the hold of astrology on another section of Tamil society,
please read:
R. S. Perinbanayagam, The karmic theater: self, society
and astrology in Jaffna, U. Massachussetts press, 1982, 212p.
It will be interesting.
Regards,
N. Ganesan
