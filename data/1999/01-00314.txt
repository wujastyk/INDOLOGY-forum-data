Statue of the sacrificial horse
Dear colleagues,
        can anybody give me any information or references on the origin
of the custom to erect a statue of the sacrifitial horse after performing
of the ashvamedha? What are the earliest examples of such custom, what
text mentions it for the first time; were there any earlier forms of this
practice such as making a wooden image of the horse, or something like that?
       Thanks in advance
                                        Ya.V.
