Draft 7-bit Indic transliteration scheme
Dear Dr. Stone,
I enjoyed looking at the transliteration scheme for
all Indian languages.
Grand achievement indeed!

A suggestion:
Along with the eleven scripts considered, a column might
be added for Grantha script of writing Sanskrit.
Some reasons to include the aesthetic Grantha alphabets are:
It is a classic script important historically,
'SaivAgamas were printed using Grantha characters
and Srivaishnava manipravala works were also using
the grantha script. In addition all the Dravidian
language scripts and the South East Asian scripts
have a relationship to Grantha.
For a look at the Grantha alphabets:
1) K. Venugopalan, A primer in Grantha characters, South Asia books
2) Paulinus a S. Bartholomaeo, Dissertation on the Sanskrit language.
 A reprint of the original Latin text of 1790, together with an
introductory article, a complete English translation, and an index

of Linguistics. Volume 12. (Amsterdam: John Benjamins B.V., 1977)
