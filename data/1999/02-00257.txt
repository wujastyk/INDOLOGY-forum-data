Permission to reprint AKR's essay
The obvious place to start is with the publisher, whose general
address and telephone are as follows:
Indiana University Press
601 N. Morton Street,
Bloomington IN 47404-3797
1-800-842-6796
If you have a copy at hand you can find, probably on the reverse of
the title page, who owns the copyright. If it was Ramanujan himself
you could find his literary executor by calling the South Asia
Language and Area Center at U. Chicago, 312-702-8635, which can
probably find it out for you.
Is AKR becoming a standard way to refer to Ramanujan?  On the the
model of AKC for Ananada Coomaraswamy?
Sincerely,
Allen Thrasher
