Subject: Is Sanskrit Dravidian ?
Message-ID: <161227051171.23782.11786673353786772709.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have not followed the thread fully; are the following etyma of the same
inheritance or re-borrowings from some proto-indian substrate?

DEDR 1974: kelngam yoke (Parji); kelman (Gadba)
DEDR 3694: nukam yoke (Tamil.Malaya_l.am); nu.n (Kota); noga (Kannad.a,
Kod.agu.Tulu.Telugu)
On the relationship between Hungarian and Dravidian min: is Rigvedic Vis.n.u
explained in the context of the Dravidian (DEDR 5396) vin. sky, heaven; bin-ye
name of the god of thunder and lightning (Maltese); cf. min shine (DEDR 4876).
