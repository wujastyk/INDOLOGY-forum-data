May I suggest that your friend consult the following book:

W. Owen Cole/Piara Singh Sambhi. The Sikhs. Their Religious Beliefs and
Practices. Routledge. London, 1989.

On page 36, the explanation of the use of the Singh name runs:

"The members of the new brotherhood, which was called the Khalsa (pure ones),
were to have no dealings with those who followed rival leaders or their
successors and were also instructed to wear five symbols - uncut hair, a comb,
a steel wrist guard, a sword, and short breeches. Initiated men took the name
"Singh" (Lion) [...] women were admitted to the Khalsa, taking the name "Kaur"
(princess)."

In other words, the use of the Singh name is not related to any particular
person. It has rather a symbolic value.
