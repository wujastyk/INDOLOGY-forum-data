   According to two Sanskritists, nArAyana originating out of
nArA (=water) is a later theological speculation. Vishnu
sleeping in the Ocean of Milk may have more to
do with Him being the God of Yadukulam. Please note
that Vishnu is the God of Mullai landscape (land of iDaiyar
(yAdhavas) amidst the five ancient Tamil landscapes in CT.
Cologne Sanskrit Lexicon gives nArAyana from nara:
""  nArAyaNa
  Meaning m. (patr. fr. %{na4ra} q.v.) the son of the original Man
(with whom he is generally associated e.g. Mn. i , 10 ; he is
   identified with Brahma1 ib. 11 with Vishn2u or Kr2ishn2a TA1r.
    MBh. &c. ; the Apsaras Urvas3i1 is said to have sprung from his
          thigh Hariv. 4601 ; ..""
  Is this nara -> nArAyana connected to Drav. naLa -> nara?
