Please see the foot noteon page 230-231 by Rev.S.Beal which says

" The distance given by south of Conjivaram seems to be exessive.
But none of the distances given by Hiuen Tsiang are to be depended upon.

I am disposed, therefore, to think that he did not go farther south than
Kanchi. In this case the subsequent account he gives us of Malakuta, Mount
Malaya and Potaraka is derived from hearsay."

No problem with this. The Devi on Malaya is called MalayavAsini
and not potalakavAsini.

No more than a conjucture for which I cannot subscribe unless there
is compelling evidence.
