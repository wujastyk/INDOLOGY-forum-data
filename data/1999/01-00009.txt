Sorry to start the new year with this topic that is off topic. Just a
punktualization:)
The "Mircea Eliade's some nazi connections" is his contribution to the
Italian group of Ur (Ur-Krur), which several intellectuals, in the years
twenties and thirties, directly and indirectly took part to (such as
Julius Evola, painter and philosopher, Emilio Servadio, psychoanalyst!
Sibilla Aleramo, writer and poetess, and many others who wrote
anonymously in the journal and only recently have been surely
identified). Some of the ideas of the group have been popularized and
appropriated by some fascist and nazi streams.
Gandhi visited Rome under Mussolini and in Italy there were a big Indian
students' meeting supported by Mussolini. The political empathy between
Mussolini and the 2 Maharaja of Nepal at his time, between him and the
major intellectuals and politicians in India and Bengal was reciprocal
and well documented. (BTW, in Sept. 1930, VIII year of the Mussolinian
era, the Italian export to India was as big as 1 billion and 300 million
It. Liras). Useless (or not?) to remind the connections between
Mussolini and Hitler.
