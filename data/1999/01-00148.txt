Without taking sides, it's safe to say that the "scientific material"
can be "arranged" to make a point of view look credible.  Ptolemic
universe looked credible for a long period of time!  There are

needs opemindedness, objective interpretation and above all, new
information.  It's good to see that all are working towards it.
