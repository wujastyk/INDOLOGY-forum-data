Thanks for stating so clearly and candidly your understanding of
the nature of the Indology list ..... a language market.
As far as I know there is no competition for the sale of tamil.
Nobody else is trying to sell his language on this list. The field
has been free for you and I think will continue to be so.
I do not think that Bh.Krishnamurti has ever sent any letters
praising telugu.
