The idea of Tantrism having at least some roots in Mahacina (Tibet,
Assam, Burma, China?) has also been explored. There are quite a bit of
Sanskrit references to the importance of Mahacina in the development
 of Tantrism although I don't have any references handy at the moment.
  Have not seen Hubey's writing on African "Siva yet.
  Where is it done?
  During what centuries, do we have "Siva from Tibet?
  Want to read on Tibetan "Siva as well. References please.
  Tirumantiram is one of the earliest Tantras from India.
  Dated to 5th century AD. Tantrayana is often called
  Mantrayana.
  Vajrabodhi in Seventh century AD set sail from Kanchi
  to Java and China to teach Tantrayana. He was
  from Malaya/Potalaka parvata.
  Not even 1% of pre-10th century Tamil literature is
  available in English yet. When they do, lot of things about
  ancient India will become clearer.
