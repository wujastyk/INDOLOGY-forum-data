Swamy is also one of the most pro-U.S. politicians Jan Sangh/BJP has ever
produced. Now he sleeps with anti-BJP forces. During my days with RSS and
Jan Sangh, I knew him personally. He can do anything to get into political
limelight.

Truly, in today's India, Sonia = Lakshmi (still sits on Bofors money?);
Jayalalitha "Imelda" (I thought *she* was today's Lakshmi) = Saraswati
(think about her political wisdom to mastermind the fall); and Mayavati =
Durga (consider her big army of U.P. thugs).

Who benefits from this enormous chaos? What do Swamy's Harvard colleagues say?
