Madhva
I don't know if this is the source you have in mind, but the question of
Brahman's/Isvara's cruelty and partiality is raised in Brahmasutra
2.1.34-35, and the charge refuted precisely on the grounds of the
beginninglessness of karman. In other words, there is no 'original act'. (I
do not have Madhva's bhashya at hand, but at least Ramanuja and Baladeva
both agree on this point.)
