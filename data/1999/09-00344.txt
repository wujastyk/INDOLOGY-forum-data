Dear Readers

I have been looking at one of E. Conze's essays on the
PrajJApAramitaratnaguNasaMcayagAthA (Rgs) and have found a couple of terms
I am unable to track down in M-W.  I assume they are in Edgerton's BHS but
as I do not have a copy on hand I thought I would ask you for help.  The
two terms I need defined are:

aniketacArI (Rgs: I.6 & 10; II.3)

anupAdadhI (Rgs: I.9, 10, 24 etc.)

Any help you could give would be much appreciated.

Many thanks in advance.

-- Regards Richard Mahoney
