There are `2 Sivas'. One Dravidian, one Tibetic. The North Indian
Shiva and Kashmir Shaivism is obviously of Tibetic origin (cf. his
white skin), while the South Indian Siva is obviously of Dravidian
origin. Indeed, Tantrism is evidently of Tibetic rrigin.

  There is only one 'Siva.

  'Siva in Tamil texts is NOT black either.
  He is of golden color  (pon2n2Ar mEn2iyan2E! - Tevaram);
  His hair is red (ceJcaTai appan2 in Tiruppan2antAL temple;
                   aruNajaTezvarasvAmi)

  Only his throat is dark/deep blue.

  N. Ganesan
