By Bolle? or by people on the list who've used Van Buitenen's trsl?  Bolle
read Sanskrit with Van Buitenen at Chicago, but their approaches are quite
different.  Bolle tries for both a poetic rendering and for a translation
that will be particularly useful for Historians of Religions.  Van
Buitenen's is the philologist's attack on the problem of translation, or so
it seems to me.  BTW, Bolle's answer to the question, why one more Gita
translation?, is to ask how there can ever be too many translations of an
important religious text.

We could open a thread on Van Buitenen's MhBh translation--it's been
criticized as inaccurate at places, but it often seems to me that at some
places he's come up with wonderful renderings.
