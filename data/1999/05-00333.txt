2. From a non-Vedic perspective, the number five is specially associated
with Siva, so that there would have been a tendency to get a mAntric
equivalent.
3. Leaving out the praNava opens the field for non-dvijas. Perhaps, the
story about the conservative opposition to Ramanuja's shouting out the
eight-syllable mantra for all to hear was because of the presence of the
praNava.
As for the vIraSaivas, the six-syllable mantra, along with the praNava,
allows an equivalence with their doctrine of shaT-sthala, so that may be why
they say this is superior to the five syllable one. But such variations of
the same mantra is nothing new. The SrIvidyA mantra has a fifteen syllable
version and a sixteen syllable version. The Goddess of the latter is
specifically called shoDaSI, in addition to being called tripurasundarI.
