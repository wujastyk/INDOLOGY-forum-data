sAri, the Indian dress

No doubt about turbans and other kinds of head gear.  The example of the
Yaksi's is good though.  It's pretty simple to extend garments like that
worn by the IVC priest over the head, so one would hardly have to look
for outside influence.
But there does seem to be some correlation between the common practice
and the beginning of the Muslim period.  Or this could have been a
common style in the Northwest which only became manifest historically
after the rise of Muslim art in the region.
