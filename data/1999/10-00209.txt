No, but here's a fourth, and unless I've left my mind at home, this
should now be the correct one - the number "986" is correctly written as
CMLXXXVI, to be resolved as "nine hundred" (CM) plus "fifty" (L) plus
"thirty" (XXX) plus "five" (V) plus "one" (I). There seems to be a
tendency to confuse fifty (L) with five hundred (D) or five (V).

... not that this would be in any way related to Indology ...
