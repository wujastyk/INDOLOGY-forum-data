VijnAnavAda  &  Dvaita
Mr. Hebbar,
Thank you. I was just speculating idly on the effects of not differentiating
between the various meanings of jnaana. As for the Bhagavatapurana, it has
some heavily idealist passages that must have made tough chewing for Madhva:
iik.seta vibhramam ida.m manaso vilaasa.m, d.r.s.ta.m vina.s.tam atilolam
*alaatacakram* (NB the Mahayana/Advaita metaphor!) / vijnaanam ekam urudheva
vibhaati ...
Regards,
Martin Gansten
