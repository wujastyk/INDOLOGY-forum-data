Pronunciation of word final "a" in sanskrit
Connected to this issue of schwa deletion is the South Indian (sweeping
statement) tendency to give an "open" quality to word-final "a".  Hence
rAma often sounds like rAmA, kRSNa like kRSNA, etc. Sanskrit phonemic
schwa is often confused, by South Indians, with low-front "a". For more on
the pronunciation of Sanskrit see the wonderful article by SK Chatterjee
in the PAThak memorial volume (BORI). Chatterjee discusses the "standard"
pronunciation reflecting a healthy medium between the north Indian and
south Indian as represented by that of Maharashtrian paNDita-s in Benares.
