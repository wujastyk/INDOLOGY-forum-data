Subject: The conversion issue
Message-ID: <161227045323.23782.423684651340758588.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In connection with the postings of Anand Nayak and Partha Banerjee,
may I add my $0.02?

>It is important to know WHY so many Hindus converted to other religions
over the centuries. Is it only because of coercion as some want us to
believe or is it that conversion took place because a large section of
the so-called low-caste people and "untouchables" willingly converted
(and also were lured by other religions and religious leaders promising
them false promises)?>>

Since there are( as you pointed out) no statistics to talk about
conversions between Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, it is difficult to verify
the exact mechanism though I believe that the whole business
of conversion for benefits i.e. conversion to Christianity from the
lower castes was predominant in the tribal areas, Southern India
and the Assam area in the last century. Conversion to Christianity by
the Portuguese( in Goa) and conversion to Islam were( atleast to a very
large part) conversions thru the sword. This can be verified
by the fact that in both cases, even members of the higher castes( the
haves as opposed to have-nots) converted in large numbers( read for
example Benazir Bhutto's "Daughter of the East" where she boasts about
their Rajput ancestry or the "Dawn", the leading Paki newspaper is full
of matrimonials refering to Khatri/Rajput specific matrimonials by
Muslims); this despite the fact that Islam does not recognize caste.
Likewise the high proportion of Gauda Saraswat Brahmins who converted to
Christianity in Goa is supported by the general nature of conversion in
the Portuguese ruled countries and the fact that Hindu temples in Goa
e.g. the Mangeshi temple  are still the recepient of grants from
ostensibly Christian families. While Kosambi may be correct about
ancient India, he hardly refers to mediaval(sic) India and his comments
cannot be extrapolated to history of a later period.

In addition, is Brahmoism a separate religion? I was always under the
impression that while Raja Ram Mohum Ray was influenced by Christianity
and the Brahmo Samaj did not accept many Hindu customs
of the time, it is still a sect within Hinduism. I would appreciate
any clarifications about this issue.

Regards,
Krishna
