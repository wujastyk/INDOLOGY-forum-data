GG 4th song verse 10
Winds from sandalwood mountains
Blow now toward Himalayan peaks,
Longing to plunge in the snows
After weeks of writhing
In the hot bellies of ground snakes.
......
GG. 8th song verse 1
She slanders sandalbalm and moonbeams-weariness confuses her.
She feels venom from nests of deadly snakes in sandal mountain winds.
   Lying dejected by your desertion, fearing Love's arrows,
   She clings to you in fantasy, mAdhava
Part II:
Not only Kalidasa in Raghuvamsam says Pandyas wear
Indra's neclace.
CilappatikAram says something like:
"tEvar-kOn2 maNiyaaram ten2n2ar-kOn2 mArpin2avE!"
 The ruby necklace of the King of Devas is
 on the chest Pandya, the King of Southerners.
Also, five centuries later, when Cholas defeat Pandyas
in their meykkIrtti/pracAsti sections of inscriptions,
Cholas proclaim they took away Pandyas' priced possession-
Indra's necklace.
Parts III and IV are given in the next posting.

N. Ganesan
