I have a theoretical question. In discussions of Dravidian etymology of
words, a criterion often used to argue for proto-Dravidian origin is whether
cognates occur in non-contiguous branches of Dravidian , eg., cognates
occurring in north and south Dravidian. What are the corresponding criteria
used in the case of IE to conclude proto-IE origins? A related question is
can the occurrence of a concept or a linguistic item in both Iranian and
Indian be used to argue against it first originating in South Asia and
spreading to Iranian, given the proximity of the two? Thanks in advance.
