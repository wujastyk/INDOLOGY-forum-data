Visitor in 1790 A.D.
Arthur & Usha Helweg, An immigrant success story, East Indians

Ch. 3, East Indians come to America (1790-1965),
The Early years
" A colonial diary from the year 1790 provides the first account
of an East Indian in America; it records the visit of a man from
Madras to Salem, Massachusetts. He had come to America with a colonial
sea captain and with a desire to expand trade between New England,
Britain and South Asia. The number of East Indians that followed was

Fourth of July celebrations, which were sponsored by the East Indian
Marine Society."
