Arthur & Usha Helweg, An immigrant success story, East Indians
in America, Univ. of Pennsylvania press, 1990
Ch. 3, East Indians come to America (1790-1965),
The Early years
" A colonial diary from the year 1790 provides the first account

Madras to Salem, Massachusetts. He had come to America with a colonial
sea captain and with a desire to expand trade between New England,
Britain and South Asia. The number of East Indians that followed was
not great. Only six Asian Indians participated in Salem's 1851
Fourth of July celebrations, which were sponsored by the East Indian
Marine Society."
