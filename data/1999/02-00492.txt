Subject: Ref. check- Possible misprint in critical edition Bhag. Gita
Message-ID: <161227046984.23782.16082419008511777628.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Van Buitenen's reading is the same as the one in the BORI critical edition,
so it must be a misprint.
As far as I know the CE is in print. You should be able to get it from any
bookseller that sells books from India.
