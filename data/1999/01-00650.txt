Clarification re: Militancy and non-secularism
This is just to second the remarks that Laurie Patton has made here. The
offensive ethnic slurs [both real and merely perceived], the name-calling,
and the partisan bickering seem to have pushed scholarly discussion, for
the most part, off the list. I hope that this will pass, and that the
list's proper focus, on scholarship, will return.
