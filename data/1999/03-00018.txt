Dear Jon,

        I just wrote the section of my dissertation today dealing with
RAmAnuja's treatment of this aspect of the Vedas, so it is still fresh in
my mind.  He explains the eternality of the Vedas in the VedArthasamgraha
(pp. 292-94 in Van Buitenen's translation, pp. 166-68 for the Sanskrit).
The idea is also discussed in Shabara's commentary on Jaimini's
KarmamImAmsAsUtras.
