Day is night in Dravidian?
    Does the `naL' in naL iruL yAmattu & naL iruL viTiyal mean
a) 'middle' OR b) 'black' ??
    I am reminded of the discussion on dharmasastras' prohibition
against sea travel (travel across the 'black sea'). There are
sangam poem phrases describing sea as 'black'. In that light,
  naL irum poykai = black, big lake.
