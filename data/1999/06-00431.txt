I wanted to keep out of this, but this word can be connected with
minngi (Karachay-Balkar mountain name as in Minngi TAu) and something
like
Minngir (or Mungur) from one of the Nilo-Saharan languages which denotes
something like a god that lives in the sky or in high places or is the
name
of a mountain where a god (sky god lives). I think I read it in a book
or article relating to NS or Dravidian.
