Dear N.Ganesan ,
I spend a great deal of time in the Boston, Mass . area and I can assure you
that Salem has a wonderful historical society, They have excellent records
and historical documents dating from the period you have mentioned. If I were
seeking more info on this individual the Salem , Mass . Historical Society
would be my first phone or e-mail. Would you like their phone or e-mail
address ?
