Trilingual inscription from Sri Lanka
I could say something about Paranavitana's scholarship.
1. I am aware that he has an honorary doctorate from Leiden, may be because
Vogel was his admirer for some reason. Vogel could not have been his
supervisor as Paranavitana did not work for his Ph.D. Without an
undergraduate degree, good universities do not register candidates for
Ph.D. Honorary doctorate can be conferred even without a basic degree.
2. There is now almost unanimous agreement among serious scholars that some
of his writings during the last phase of his career are not worthy of
serious consideration. I can cite one recent publication which deals with
this aspect. Ananda W .P. Guruge, " Senerat Paranavitana as a Writer of
Historical Fiction in Sanskrit", Vidyodaya. J. Soc. Sc. vol. 7, 1&2, 1996,
pp. 157- 179.
3. Even during the early phase of his career, he was a Sinhala chauvinist.
One can read one of his contributions and rejoinders to it to understand
the depth to which he can go to twist and misinterpret matters.
