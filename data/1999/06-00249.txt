I recently read one book by Suhotra Swami entitled "Dimensions of
Good and Evil" (only published on the internet).  In the book there
is a chapter dealing with the connection between the Vedic culture
and Zarathustra.  The idea presented here is that Zarathustra's
teachings represents a deviation from the Vedic faith.  The name
Ahura Mazda is another form of Asura Maya, which is a title of the
Vedic deity Varuna.  Also Zarathustra is identified with Jarutha
mentioned in the Rig Veda.  Furthermore references to the
Bhavisya Purana is given where Zarathustra is named "Maga
Jarasabdha," where the "Maga" supposedly refers to the Magi, the
priestly class of ancient Iran.
I hope this is of some help.
