pANi as style/school
  Among the traditional schools of BharatanATyam, pANi
is used as style/school. Eg., pantaNainallUr pANi where
Mrinalini Sarabhai got her training.
Does pANi as a style/school of dance occurs in Natyashastra
or elsewhere? Is it one of the DasarUpakas?
Heard that pANi as "hand" does not have IE origins,
despite long attempts to show that way.
Could these "pANi" be related to tamil "paN-" (to do)?
