The conversion issue
"Conversion" it seems may mean different things in different contexts.
In the case of Buddhism - to what extent was it necessary for the people
who wished to embrace Buddhism as lay followers (upasakas/upasikas) to
leave their Hinduism?
In the case of Islam/Christianity - were the conversions of Indian tribals
and untouchables conversions from Hinduism?
