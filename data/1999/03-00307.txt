uraga and AlavAy
 Has a parallel in Karaikkal Ammaiyar sculptures being made
in Southeast Asia, rather than South India. The AlavAy myth
as the snake encircling Madurai, a fine analysis in
D. Shulman, Tamil temple myths, 1980; The bhakti literature
and talapurANams in Tamil, only the surface has been touched.
