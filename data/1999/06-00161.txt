Is "Sanskrit" Dravidian?
<<<
It is good that you pointed this out. What I said here is wrong.
I meant that one third *of foreign words* in Hindi cannot be
attributed to Dravidian or Munda, but rather to this language x.
I did not mean one third of all Hindi words.
These borrowed terms tend to be agricultural terms, by the way.
Dear George,
Is there a word list of the agricultural terms
that Masica talks about?
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
