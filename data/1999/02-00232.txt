Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
Reading the postings by Drs. Ganesan and Palaniappan, the
argument that dakSiNAmUrti and Avalokitezvara are NOT to be
related does NOT appear convincing to me.
Look at the postings by Prof. N. Ganesan under the
thread - "Siva and Avalokitezvara. He says
1) daza bhUmikA sUtra (200 AD), the highest, ultimate
state the Bodhisattva reaches is "mahezvara 'siva".
2) The primal spell of Avalokitezvara is Om maNi padme hUm
all over the world. "Jewel in the Lotus" refers to the most famous
"Siva theme - linga-yoni combination.
