new online magazine on Kannada in English
Since two weeks, the English-language quarterly journal of the Karnataka
Sahitya Akademy, _Aniketana_ (named after the well-known poem by Bharatiya
Jnanapith laureate Kuvempu), is available online. In a circular letter d.
14.1.1999, the editor has this to say about this new effort:
"Aniketana has earned the distinction of being the first regional language
literary journal in the nation to have entered the cyberspace. Our Web site,
which is wholly dedicated to the promotion of Kannada language and
literature, is a humble, but, a committed effort towards diversifying the
contents of the Internet. The effort comes at a crucial juncture in history
when the ill-effects of 'global monoculture' through the Internet are being
widely debated."
