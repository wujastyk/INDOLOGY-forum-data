On 'patra/pattra' again!
Hello folks,
        Any assertions that the word patra/pattra is derived from the root
pat need to be addressed in more specific terms.  This view is found in
the commentary of K.siirasvaamin on the Amarakoza (patati pattram).
Ultimately this etymology goes back to a generic U.naadisuutra :
sarvadhaatubhya.h .s.tran, which allows the addition of the affix -tra
after all roots.  The fact that this is an U.naadisuutra is significant.
It means that Panini himself treated these formations as underived
(avyutpanna), and that the U.naadisuutra-traditions (often ascribed to
Zaaka.taayana) offered these derivations.  With such differences on the
derivations of these words, the variation in doubling needs to be treated
with less emphasis on assured etymology, but on larger patterns of
Sanskrit pronunciation, reflected in optional rules of consonantal
doubling, as well as in preferences for doubling seen in manuscripts
coming from certain regions.
