The conception of Rama
Srini Pichumani wrote:
Continuing with my "luddite ranting", let me point out that nowhere have I suggested
not curing physical or even psychological inabilities in men and women with the help of
modern medicine. I am talking about the whole ethics of sperm banks and the secrecy cult
that modern medicine has made out to be an industry. Contemporary religious beliefs,
Christian, Hindu or Islamic can all benefit by reform and openness for which they have a
precedent in ancient practices. Any social reform needs precedents and customary
evidence, niyoga only provides it authentically, as a widespread ancient practice.
Hindu conservatism has suppressed this fact and held that it was discarded
as it was abused in "kaliyauga".
Adoption is legitimate in itself, and the now much hated Manusmriti provided for many
kinds of adoption, but adoption cannot not be a solution for those who wish to give
birth and raise a child in the family.
The real opposition to niyoga is from the modern  male ego. Ancient niyoga was used
for patriarchal/ family/ vamsha/ perpetuation. Now besides family perpetuation it can
be social sanction for individual choices and motherhood also.
Thank you for the discussion, with regards,
