Thanks very much for the explanation and references.
While accepting the _fact_ of anusvAra usage for -n in MS,
I question Whitney's comment that it is "just as reasonabl[e]".
For the tradition that makes the anusvAra substitution before
a semivowel there would be no difference in pronunciation, but
for those that do not make the substitution (as M-W dictionary)
such anusvAra usage would be incorrect according to Panini
(-n --> &l necessarily by torli, but -m --> &l optionally by
vA padAntasya).  Of course, which is more "correct" depends
whether MS usage or Panini is taken as more authoritative.
(And I'm not getting into that argument!)
Oops! Thanks for the correction.
In the light of Whitney's observation, and Madhav Deshpande's
expansion on the topic (thanks for that!), puNyakRtAn seems
more likely than puNyakRtAm.
