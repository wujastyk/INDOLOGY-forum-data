Concept of Mukti and Shankaracharya

    Re:the purely "academic query" whether Adi Shankara was a "liberated soul"-
 let us consider what a liberated soul is supposed to do till the soul leaves the
mortal coils- retire to acorner and spend the time in meditation- meditating 
on what and for what purpose- he is after all a liberated soul- or vegetate 
and wwither away till the hangers-on bury him and deify him?
seers emphasize only how steadfast one should adhere to the path and
how steafastedly one should avoid certain deeds and action if 
liberation is to be achieved- nowhere one comes across how aliberated soul
should his life perhaps they are no more bound by  any routines.
How about Ramakrishna who lived in last century who is generally considered 
to be aliberated soul or Ramana   of this century -How do they compare with 
Shankara in the sort of life to be led by a liberated soul?
