The Golden Tenjur MS is based on the 'Phying-ba sTag-rtse edition
based on the Zha-lu gSer-khang edition, and was prepared under the
supervision of Pho-lha-nas bSod-nams sTobs-rgyas.  It has been
published in an offset edition aand can be obtained via the Institute
for Minority & Religion, Ning-xia Academy of Social Science in
Yinchuan City.

Tabo Monastery is in Spiti, Himchal Pradesh.  It has the jumbled
remnants (35,000 folios) of what was once a very extensive library
with many early high-quality mss.   There has been an Austro-Italian
project to sort, study and microfilm what is there.  Prof Steinkellner
is involved in the project, I believe.

There are also the mss Kanjurs at Tawang (aka O-rgyan-gling edition)
in Arunchal Pradesh which are being/have been microfilmed.  These
editions fall outside the early Narthang collection from which all the
printed editions in general derive.  I do not have a handlist for the
texts included but you might try to find one since these mss include a
number of items that are normally relegated to the Tenjur in printed
editions.

There were about three reports by him in the Journal of the Bihar &
Orissa Research Society during the late thirties -- I have a photocopy
somewhere but at present I cannot tell what years they appeared in --
again, if you come to London and are interested, I am sure we can
arrange something.

Indeed, yes.  I did not intend a put-down of your work though if we do
ever meet, we can discuss the significance of Chandrakirti.  Were your
native scholars Gelukpas in the main ?
