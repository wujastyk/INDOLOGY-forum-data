published in an offset edition aand can be obtained via the Institute

example?
Tabo Monastery is in Spiti, Himchal Pradesh.  It has the jumbled
remnants (35,000 folios) of what was once a very extensive library
with many early high-quality mss.   There has been an Austro-Italian
project to sort, study and microfilm what is there.  Prof Steinkellner
is involved in the project, I believe.
There are also the mss Kanjurs at Tawang (aka O-rgyan-gling edition)
in Arunchal Pradesh which are being/have been microfilmed.  These
editions fall outside the early Narthang collection from which all the
printed editions in general derive.  I do not have a handlist for the
texts included but you might try to find one since these mss include a
number of items that are normally relegated to the Tenjur in printed
editions.

arrange something.

Indeed, yes.  I did not intend a put-down of your work though if we do
ever meet, we can discuss the significance of Chandrakirti.  Were your
native scholars Gelukpas in the main ?
