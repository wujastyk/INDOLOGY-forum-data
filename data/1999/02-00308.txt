Word splitting & hyphenation conventions in roman              transliteration
 Well, that is his peculiar habit. Like someone said:
 "You can wake up a person if only he is *really* asleep".
  Not only that. Roman script transcends linguistic and religious
  boundary markers in India. It is common to the world and india.
  Those who control 90% of resources use Roman script anyway
  in economic transactions. They educate their kids that way too.
  Only advantage in retaining Indic scripts is in the imposition
  of outdated imperialisms on nonwilling states/peoples and
  and in impeding interstate and international trade/communications.
