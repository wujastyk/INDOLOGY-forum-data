Question?
Here is a question, especially for those who know the ancient Tamil
literature.  Harper's Dictionary of Hinduism (p. 80) makes the following
statement:
"Ancient Tamil tradition speaks of five Dravidian regions, viz., Andhra or
Telugu and the Kanarese countries, the Maharashtra or Maratha provinces,
and Gujarat."
I would appreciate any help in tracing specific references in Tamil works
to the inclusion of Maharashtra and Gujarat among the five Dravidian
regions.
