There's more to being a brahmin than mere Sanskritic learning.
An orthodox brahmin is somebody who lives by the Dharma ShAstrams. The
brahmins who live in the city, work for a living etc do not fall in
this category. Actually by that very way of life, they just prove that they
have not understood the ideal of life set forth in the dharma
shAstrams.ShankarAchArya in his dig vijayams is supposed to have
deliberately avoided cities, as the denizens of such places were supposed to
be too corrupted and beyond all help!
Orthodox brahmins still exist in villages in India and live strictly by the
dharma. These are the brahmins who truly represent the brahmanic ideal set
forth in the scriptures. They are often dirt poor, but in the true brahmanic
way go all the way to live their dharma.
Let alone interacting with non-brahmins, foreigners etc these brahmins
are not too keen to interact with their city bred relatives even.
