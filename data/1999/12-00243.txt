looking for Rita Goldman
Could anyone help me in finding Rita Goldman, who was at the U.S.
Embassy in Kathmandu in the 1950s?  State Dept. sources have not been
able to help me.  A cultural institution in Nepal would like to
contact her in connection with tapes she made of the great Nepali poet
Laxmi Prasad Devkota.
Thanks,
Allen Thrasher
