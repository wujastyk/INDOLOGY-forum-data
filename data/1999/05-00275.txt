 >> The art of Navigation was born in the river Sindh 6000 years ago.
 >> The very word Navigation is derived from the Sanskrit word
 >> NAVGATIH. The word navy is also derived from Sanskrit 'Nou'.

A friend forwarded this circulating in cyberspace; supposedly
this comes with a long list of ancient India's achievements.
What is the currently held opinion in Indology on the words,
Navy and Navigation?

Please compare the following Tamil words:
"nAvu" = 1) to thrust the tongue and move it sideways,
          2) to winnow and clear grains from stones.
