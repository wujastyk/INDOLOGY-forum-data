'Siva Nandi
Also: the bull baiting festival is very special in
Tamil culture. It happens on the Pongal/makara sankrAnti day.
Called as jalli kaTTu or manji viraTTu.
There are two classic novels with the flavour of the native
soil (Madurai district)
Kottamangalam Cuppu's manjiviraTTu
and C. S. Chellappa's vaaTi vaacal.
Kalittokai, an ancient Tamil sangam text, describes
the bull baiting festival (cf. K. Zvelebil's paper).
Sanskrit texts describing Krishna's bull baiting
games were written in the Tamil South much later
(Prof. Erik af Edholm's Nila/Nappinnai paper).
