Lately, I am getting interested in knowing more about Francis Whyte
Ellis. He seems to be much more enlightened than his contemporaries
and he wrote separate essays on Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil. How many
of these survive? I hear that his papers are in the British library,
it will be great to publish them. Usually, the Anthology of Solitary
verses (tan2ippATaRRiraTTu) end with the poems by Ellis. Iravatham
Mahadevan has published the die block in Madras mint Ellis made for
the East India company coin which has Tiruvalluvar on it. Possibly
the first portrayal of Tiruvalluvar available?? I have discovered
two akaval poems, 1) by Ellis who wrote this after a terrible drought,
he dug up several wells in Madras and 2) on his cemetery in Dindugal.

What is the exact citaion for the 1822 Ellis article in Tras.AS?
This old parchment episode is well known in tamil lit. Saiva
saint Cuntarar's wedding and a TolkAppiyam commentary quote of
an ancient poem describing the quarrels between potters and
accountants. May be De Nobili & Ellis heard this from tamil vidhvans?
