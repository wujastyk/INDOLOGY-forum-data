marAThI bELA (jasmine)
  Dear Prof. Deshpande,
  Greetings.
 Vaguely remember when myself and Palaniappan were saying
 that BeLagAm is related to a Tamil cognate, "vEL".,
 S. Krishna said BeLa + gAma (grAma) means jasmine village.
 I think he mentioned "bELA" means jasmine in Marathi.
 I was skeptical then. beLagAma may have nothing
 to do with jasmine (Ta. mallikai).
 jasmine is a bush whereas bilva is a big tree.
  Have a question on vilva/bilva in Sanskrit:
  'vilva' leaves are the most sacred for Lord 'Siva.
  Tamil has two vilva/bilva trees. One is 'kUviLam',
  the other being 'karuviLam'. Both have medicinal
  values. One (or both?) is called "viLAm" tree.
  Elephants particularly like fruits from "viLam/viLaam"
  trees.
  Also, karuviLam and kUviLam are used in Tamil metrics of
  prosody for measuring word lengths. Used as mnemonic
  formulas.
  Ta. viLam/viLaam - Are there any
  relations to Sanskrit vilva/bilva?
  Sincerely
  N. Ganesan
