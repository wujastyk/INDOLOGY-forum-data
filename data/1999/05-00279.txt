Upanishads, MahAyAna, Advaita
Thanks, Prof. Hebbar for three references;
I do not have them handy here, What is in the references?
Is Shevappa Nayaka the first Tanjore Nayak?
Was he the one who usurped power from a weak Vijayanagar Rayar?
The first one was Private Attendant to the V. Raya
whose job was to give tAmbUlam. Probably, he had NO sanskrit.
