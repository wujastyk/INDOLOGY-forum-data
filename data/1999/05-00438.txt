I agree with what you are saying. However, I think that there are
regional differences between the areas of Punjab and much of Pakistan
with the rest of India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. For example, Sikhs,
in general, are much taller and have somewhat different features than
Tamils.  There's a lot of overlap, though, I admit.

None of this supports any 'invasion' theories, but I think that some try
too hard to deny any outside 'racial' influence on the Indian
population.
