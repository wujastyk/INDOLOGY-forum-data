Original  Dravidian  Homeland
Dear  Prof. Vassilkov:
Thank  you  (spasiba ?)  for  your  reply.  Da,  I  am  aware  of  these
other  languages  that  are  spoken  in  my  motherland.  Because  it
has  always  historically  been  an  Aryan-Dravidian  issue,  I  just
confined  myself  to  those  two.
Regards,
B.N.Hebbar
PS: Please  don't  take  any  offense  of  the  Russian  that  I  am
using.  Just  practicing  the  few  words  I  know  in  a  friendly
way. Thanks.
