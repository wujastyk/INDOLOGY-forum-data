muraja drum
Seeking Sanskritists' help on the drum/big drum `muraja'.
Is it from Indo-Iranian heritage?
Or,
Is Skt. muraja from Dravidian muracam? Classical Tamil
texts have royal drum, muracam/muracu/muraicu.
Usually, these muracam-s were kept on a decorated cot
in the palace. Sangam texts portray muracam-s being
carried by elephants and royal commands proclaimed.
Any comments on Skt. muraja and Ta. muracam?
Thanks a million,
Arul
