Nambudiris
Dear Prof. Maheswaran Nair,
Welcome to Indology list.
I read in Indology some time ago that Nambudiris hail
from Mahrashtra. Prof. Madhav Deshpande wrote then;
Both Konganastha Brahmins and Nambudiris have the same
kuladeyvam temple - somewhere in Konkan. (I need to check
the archives for correct quotes).
Did Nambudiris arrive in Kerala from Maharashtra region?
When? 5th century?
Thanks for your answer,
