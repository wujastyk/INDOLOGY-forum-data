        There are no Vastu or hindu archtectural news groups.
But I have seen some articles about the subject coming up in
the alt.jyotish newsgroup.
        If you are interested in the Chinese art of Geomancy,
then you can search for Feng Shui web-sites. There seem to be
quite a number of them.
        You beleive in these things?
