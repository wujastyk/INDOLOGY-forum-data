Thank you Madhav,
Whitney in his grammar is far more restrictive in describing consonent
doubling than the above (y-R group optionally after vowel if not
followed by a vowel).  Whitney's rules are:
227. ch after vowel required.
228. After r any consonent (except spirant before a vowel) allowed
     or required.
     a. some authorities include (h,l, or v) along with r.
229. First consonent of a group - whether interior, or initial after
     a vowel of a preceeding word - allowed or required.
230. Some rules on inserting nasal sounds and vowel fragments.
230 f. What he calls "one or two cases of yet more doubtful value,
       see the prAtizAkhyas."
Is what Whitney describes (his sections 227,228 and 229) the common
occurance of consonent doubling, and those others outside the scope of
his rules but within the scope of yaR group as described above of
less common occurance? i.e. is Atmajjyotir actually uncommon?
