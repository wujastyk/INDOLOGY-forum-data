LANKAVATARA Sutra - its current research and oldest Manuscripts
Hello
Does anybody knows what is the oldest surviving Sanskrit and
Chinese (Taisho 670, 671, 672)  manuscripts of Lankavatara and
where it is located?
I would also like to ask if anybody knows about any current
research or translating of this sutra especially in the Chinese
version.
Sincerely
Petr Mares
