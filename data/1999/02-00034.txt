Subject: LANKAVATARA Sutra - its current research and oldest Manuscripts
Message-ID: <161227045926.23782.8574101609660315880.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Hello

Does anybody knows what is the oldest surviving Sanskrit and
Chinese (Taisho 670, 671, 672)  manuscripts of Lankavatara and
where it is located?

I would also like to ask if anybody knows about any current
research or translating of this sutra especially in the Chinese
version.

Sincerely

Petr Mares
