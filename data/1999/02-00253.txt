Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
  This is quite well known. Many mahayana authors, patronized
  by mercantile classes (cheTTi (Ta.)/shresTi) with wealth
  from sea-borne trade, were not sanskrit experts.
  They were just imitating Samskrit paNDitas, but their
  works fall far short of good Sanskrit.
