Saffron in Kashmir
Crocus sativus (the source of saffron) does not produce seeds but has to be
propagated vegetatively.
I read somewhere (Brian Mathew 1982 was it?) that the saffron of Kashmir is
genetically identical with the saffron grown in Spain. The crocus is native
in the area from Portugal to Turkey, from North Africa to Slovenia, Croatia
etc. (centre of origin Greece / Macedonia?). I would suggest Mathew's book
as a starting point for historical citations.
