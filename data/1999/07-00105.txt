Ah, that is interesting.  What do you call "the Mahayana phase of Sri
Lanka"?  Is this some modern development, perhaps under Japanese
influence...?
And is the "Tooth temple" a Buddhist temple where some relic of Buddha's
tooth is kept?
There is a famous Japanese medieval legend in which Ida-ten (a Sino-Japanese
Buddhist deity who is very probably a continuation of Skanda) is said to
have taken back a relic of Buddha's tooth which had been stolen by two
yak.sa just after the nirvaa.na of the Buddha...
Thank you very much for this valuable information.
Best regards,
