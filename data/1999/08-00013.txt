I wonder if one needs to resort to "koy"...
The word "kuy" itself is employed as the root in words  which cover many
classical pursuits of craftsmanship:
pottery, cutting, perforation (of stones, beads, or to make wind
instruments), making/playing musical instruments, jewelry (perforation,
polishing etc), tailoring and so on.
This word has a strong parallel to the usage of "kal" (as in kalam for any
product of craftsmanship). Also worth considering the word Ta. "kai" for
"hand".
Even though CT references for most of these can be cited, for immediate
purposes I am citing the Cologne On Line Tamil Lexicon for many words:
kuyavan2  01 potter
kuyam  1. sickle, reaping-hook, curved knife; 2. razor; 3. potter caste
kuyil 04 hole, perforation
kuyavu  car, chariot
kuyin2ar  1. those who polish and perforate gems; 2. tailors
kuyin2  02 deed, work
kuyiluvam

kuyiluvar

kuyalan2

kuyiRRu-tal
01 1. to tell, say, utter; to lay down, as rules
02 1. to make, construct, form perform; 2. to enchase, set, as gems
kuyil(lu)-tal
02 1. to make, execute, shape, construct; 2. to weave;
3. to plait, braid, intwine; 4. to bore, perforate,
tunne; 5. to enchase, set as precious stones;
1. to take place; 2. to be thick, close, crowded; 3. to sound, play
