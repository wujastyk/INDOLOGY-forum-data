Looking for a book
Could anyone let me know if any copy of this book exists in the United
States?
Bharadvajavrttibhasya on the Vaiseshika sutras; Gangadhar Kaviratna Kaviraja
(or Gangadhar Rai); Calcutta; 1869 (or 1870); Published by the Baptist
Missionary Press (Serampore)
The India Office Library at London had a copy but the same is presumably
lost.
Thanks in advance,
Vishal
