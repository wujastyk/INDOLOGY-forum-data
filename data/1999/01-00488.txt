I'm afraid it is not their choice.  As the founder of this list I
collaborate closely with the actual list owners in Liverpool, who run the

But anyone may start a rival moderated list elsewhere, naturally.  There
are already lists specifically for vyakarana and other topics, for
example.
All the best,
