As for "maraam", the Tamil name for tree is "maram".
Another point to note here is that "maraam" sounds as though
the cadamba tree is referred to as "the tree".
I also read in a text book on carnatic music (or Tamil
music) that the tube of the musical (wind) instrument
"naagaswaram" or "naathaswaram" unique to Tamil Nadu
is made from "aachchaa" tree wood.


I also found another name for the tree:
"aa" in cilappatikaaram: 2nd centruy AD:
"aavum aaramum Ongkina engkaNum"
[cilap.: chapter 12[vEttuva vari]: stanza 76]
txln:
"cadamba oak trees and sandal trees had grown tall
everywhere"

Ramayanam mentions "maraam" or "aachchaa" tree often.

Thanks
Chandra

This could be Farsi or borrowed into Farsi because the word
"meram" is used in Turkish for a wooded place and I don't
think it is from Turkish originally.

This is also strange. Aghach, or aach means 'tree' or 'wood'
in Turkic languages.
