Word splitting & hyphenation conventions in              romantransliteration
Not necessary. Those were two things in the reply - not
interconnected
1. No good programmers and no leading possitions in IT.
2. Difficoulty of computing industry due to enormous number of
Characters and standards. There is for example more than 70 000
DIFFERENT characters in Chinese tripitaka. There is over 20.000
Different characters in Unicode. So the industry has to concentrate
on dealing with many standards, BIG5, GB, HZ, Unicode etc in the
firsthand. It is the main burden for the fast development.
Another thing is that I pesronally believe that some cultures have
more people able to write poetry and some country has more
manpower that capture easy what is recursive coding.
