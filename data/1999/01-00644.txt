Astronomical names for AsterismsII:Was-Hindu new years day
For 'siva mahAdeva, never being born is maintained in
Tamil tradtion all along.
tEvAram or any other 'Saiva tirumuRai does not treat 'Siva
as a child. Cilambu calls 'Siva as "piRavA yAkkaip periyOn2". -
ie., the Great God who is never born and hence eternal.
In the 100s of piLLaittamiz prabandhams, almost every God
or King is eulogized as a baby. But, except 'Siva.
On the contrary, see the beautiful passages of Rama
or Krishna as a baby in AzvArs. There are 10s of
piLLaittamiz works treating many phases of Vishnu/TirumAl
as a child.
Is there a reason why Tiru ONam is not the natal star of viSNu?
NaccinArkkiniyar apparently thinks so. (cf. Chandra's quote).
