SAmkhya/Yoga question
On Fri, 17 Dec 1999, Vidyasankar Sundaresan wrote:
It is unfortunate that there is so little preserved of post-Kapilan
Samkhyan commentaries that for all we know might have addressed such
issues.  Post Sankaran Vedanta commentators such as Ramanuja, of course,
resolved the issue to their satisfaction by positing a third player --
PuruSa ViSNu, who serves as the required catalyst causing the union of
puruSa and prakRti, so they too recognized the problem in classical
Samkhya.
It is noteworthy that Sankara took Samkhya to task so vigorously on this
issue, and yet appeared comfortable with the equally conspicuous
problematic in his own system, viz, the ultimate locus of MAyA/avidhyA.
After all, a position of 'anirvAcanIya' could be invoked just as
satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily to justify the Samkhyan position of
ultimate causality as it has been used to justify the advaitin's
explanation (in the matter of the relationship between advaita Brahman and
Maya).
