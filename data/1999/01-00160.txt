The following should also be mentioned:

Adriana Berger. Fascism and Religion in Romania (review of Eliade's
Autobiography, vol. 2, 1988; and Ricketts' Mircea Eliade-The Romanian Roots,
1988).
Annals of Scholarship 1989, vol 6, N. 4: 455-465.

Berger quotes British intelligence documents from 1940 that suspect Eliade
of having Nazi connections.

According to her (not in this review, but in a lecture delivered at UC,
Berkeley years ago), at the time of his death Eliade was under investigation
by the CIA for possible fascist connections during the (pre- and) war years.

More importantly, Berger discusses Eliade's occult affiliation in Romania
and its fascist ideology.   She also writes that, in Eliade's background,
the idea of a spiritual East (especially in India, "the land of the pure
Aryans") was prominent.  Presumably, this influenced his decision to travel
to India, where he lived from 1929 to 1931 and stayed at the house of S.N.
Dasgupta.
