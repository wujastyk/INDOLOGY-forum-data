River Krishna
    It is quite possible that veni might be the sanskritised form
of pennai.Nor the historical referrances to pennai rivers are in
question. the point is it does appear to be logical to associate
panaimarams to river banks-no poet can drool over panai-lined rivers.
Besides, the geo-physical characters are so different as to have
panai/pennai as a common factor!
  There are two villages -Pennagaram and pennathur-not far from
the river course of Thenpennai.perhaps, the origins of these
place names can lead somewhere.
Regards,
 Krish.
