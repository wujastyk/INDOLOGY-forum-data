Also: dr. *kOLam/kULam > Kharia ku.da & Mundari kode.
Please give the -V.dV- word list from Munda languages.
Atleast, some Munda words with intervocalic .d are from Dravidian.
With only few Munda tribal dialects showing retroflexion
and all Munda languages recorded fairly recently, does
the Munda .d retroflexion intervocalically come from Dravidian?
