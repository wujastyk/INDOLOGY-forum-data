The oldest known texts in India are a few, extremely rare
pre-Ashoka texts, among them the Sohgaura copper plate and
the Mahasthan inscription, perhaps from Chandragupta Maurya's
period. Sohgaura copper plate has been stolen and is in some
private collection.
Thus if the Sudhanva plate exists, it would be an extremely
important object.
Is the text in Sanskrit? All known inscriptions well until about
first cent. BCE or so are in Prakrit (Pali).
