Dasrath, Ram's father had been cursed by some one therefore or otherwise
he was unable to father a child even though he had 3 wives. He consulted
some priests and performed some yagnya and was given some potion which
he gave to his wives so that they all became pregnant. Therefore the
biological father of Ram is as much mystery as biological father of
Jesus.
