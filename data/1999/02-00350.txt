URL correction - IDSAS
Thanks to the sharp-eyed Christian Novetske for pointing out the error
in the URLs given for the International Directory of South Asia
Scholars (and also for SARAI): the ".edu" part was inadvertently
repeated. The correct urls are:
SARAI:
  http://www.columbia.edu/cu/libraries/indiv/area/sarai
INT'L DIRECTORY OF SOUTH ASIA SCHOLARS (IDSAS):
  http://www.columbia.edu/cu/libraries/indiv/area/sarai/directory.html
I apologize for this error!
