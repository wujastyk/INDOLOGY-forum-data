Subject: Query on Peacock Myths, Stories
Message-ID: <161227051598.23782.16077334851179814102.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,

Apart from simple notations on the use of the peacock as a vehicle for a
deity, does anyone know of myths or traditional stories in which the peacock
figures prominently as a focus of the story?

Thanks.

Dan White
