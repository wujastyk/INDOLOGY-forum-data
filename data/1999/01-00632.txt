List members,
To be blunt, neither American, British, Canadian nor Indian Universities
have a monopoly on nationalism, narrowism, parochialism, bias, and
discrimination per hiring practices. Perhaps, as it has been said, only the
innocent have a right to throw stones and, by definition, the innocent do
not do such things. And to be fair, there are also numerous occasions and
places where such practices have little or no scope. Such is the way of the
world.
