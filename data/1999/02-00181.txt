Dear Mr.Gantsen:

Here  is  at  least  one  source  where  RAmAnuja  rejects  the  view
that  all  is  consciousness,  implying  thereby  that  things  do
exist  independently  of  consciousness.  The  source  is  ShribhAShya
II:2:26-29.  In  II:2:26  RAmAnuja  provides  the  YogAcAra  view  as
the  PUrvapakSha  and  in  II:2:27-29  he  refutes  that  view.

Regards,
B.N.Hebbar
