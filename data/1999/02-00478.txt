Dravidian: Mother of Indo...
Dear Memebers of the List,
I have noted that some of you could not get Discovery of Dravidian as the
common source of Indo-European at http://www.datanumeric.com/dravidian. Iam
getting it ok. However, I shall check into it and see if there is possibly a
problem involved. Sorry for the inconvenience. All the best.
