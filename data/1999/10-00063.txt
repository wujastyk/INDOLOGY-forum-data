"I intend to work about curses, enchantments and miracles in the Hindu

times......"

Dear Dr. Smith,

Carl Ernst, of University of N. Carolina, writes several interesting
pieces dealing with the miraculous from the Muslim context  in,
"Religions of India in Practice", edited by Donald Lopez, 1995, Princeton
University.

.....On a possibly related note, I am putting together a high school
level lesson plan on Satya Pir, the (Bengali) saint  (Hindu, Muslim?
Both?). I would appreciate any references, information, or commentaries
regarding Muslim or Hindu perspectives on  Satya Pir, or Satya Narayana.

Thanks,
Robert
