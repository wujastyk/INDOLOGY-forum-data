=======================

DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS

Nepalese Shaman Oral Texts is a bilingual (Nepali and English) critical
edition of three complete, representative repertoires of shaman texts
collected over the past twenty years in Jajarkot District, Western Nepal.

Throughout that area, shamans continue to fulfill important therapeutic
roles, diagnosing problems, treating afflictions, and restoring order and
balance to the lives of their clients and their communities.  Each of
these efforts incorporates extensive, meticulously memorized oral texts,
materials that not only clarify symptoms and causes but also detail the
proper ways to conduct rituals.  These texts preserve the knowledge
necessary to act as a shaman, and confirm a social world that demands
continued intervention by shamans.

This volume, the first of its kind, includes both publicly chanted
recitals and privately whispered spells of the area's three leading
shamans, annotated with extensive notes. Containing over 250 texts totally
nearly 11,000 lines of material, this work endeavors to provide a
comprehensive documentation of a non-Western healing system through the
material that sustains and preserves that tradition, demonstrating that
shaman texts remain thoroughly meaningful.
