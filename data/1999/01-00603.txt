Hindu new years day
   Though i started the debate on the status of the hindu
newyears day i'm handicapped by lack of free time to participate
further.However i have another query-
in ordinary mortals like me the janma nakshatra determines
the birthdays.But for avatars the tithi marks the jayanthi.
How and why this transformation ?
Krish.
