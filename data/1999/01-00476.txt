I assume you have seen Sivaramamurti's _Nataraja in Art_
Andrew Cohen
>>>

Well, Sivaramamurti gave me a copy when it was printed.
This is just an extension of Ca. TaNTapANi Tecikar's
AaTavallaan, Dharmapuram Adheenam. There is absolutely
no Ananda TaaNDava NaTarAjas, often priced possessions
in European and US museums, anywhere else except Tamil Nadu.
I know of Natesas in India with slightly bent legs,
but they are NOT NaTarAja.

Interesting info is: T. N. Ramachandran ((Buddhist bronzes
from Nagapattinam and teacher of Nagasamy (given
name: PanchanadIsvaran))) and C. Sivaramamurti married
sisters.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
