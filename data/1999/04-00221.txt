Hello everyone,
     A colleague of mine in Chinese history recently asked me whether I
know of any recent discussions of what Jaspers called the "Axial Age" in
South Asia.  I tend to think that this idea has limited value, though I
have not read anything or thought about it for a long time.  Does
anybody have any suggestions?
     Thank you,
