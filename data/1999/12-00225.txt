astronomy
Several nagging questions in connection with the present discussion thread
on Indian astronomy and its antiquity.
Is there any extra-textual evidence for the existence of true observational
astronomy in India?
Any ancient images of star-gazers with their usual instruments?
Reflexes of the elements of astronomers' daily work routine in Indian
belles-lettres? Of their observation techniques? Instruments? Charts?
Archaeological findings that could be interpreted as connected with
observational astronomy?
