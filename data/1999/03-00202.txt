Women in Afghanistan
Arthur Karp takes exception to the passage:
I suppose the word "pogrom" is not in your vocabulary?
Should Poland be singled out for its inhospitability toward Jews (both
before and after the Holocaust; many Jews who no longer identified
themselves as Jewish were made to leave Poland in the 1960s)? I agree
Poland should not be made to bear the full brunt of European antisemitism,
but it can hardly deny being a major player (where, after all, were the
Death Camps?). The factoid at the end of Schindler's List highlights this:
The descendents of the 1200 some-odd Jews saved by Schindler are now over
four times as many as all the Jews remaining in Poland.
So protest being singled out, but don't deny the charges.
