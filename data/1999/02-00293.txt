Paishaacika Sanskrit?
  Mr. Gantsen,
  You may be interested to know a Britisher's experience
  with nADii astrology. It is a magazine piece.
  The author is a descendent of Robert Clive who established
  Br. rule first in Madras and then in Bengal.
  Peter Holt, Reading the leaves, p. 329-331,
  in  Travelers' tales - India, O'Reilly press, 1995
  Peter goes to Vaidheesvaran Koyil, ThanjAvUr district, TN.
  nADii is unique to TamilnAdu.
  Regards
  N. Ganesan
