Narayana's Color
Dear Indologists,
Vishnu sahasranamam tells us that viSNu is 'megha varNam zubhAGgam'
and 'megha zyAmam'. Are there any other places in the epics,
R. and MBh. that say viSNu nArAyana is black or dark in complexion?
Also, any quotes from Kalidasa or Bhasa (esp. BAlacarita) on
Vishnu? Does F. Hardy's viraha bhakti discuss Vishnu's color?
What about Nandita Krishna's Iconography of Vishnu Narayana?
In the MBh., Arjuna is called nara and Krishna is nArAyana often.
Arjuna is black and when Arjuna and Krishna ride the chariot,
does the epic say that TWO Krishnas are in the chariot?
Is Durga called Narayani because she is black? Later religious
developments make Durga the sister of Narayana. Interestingly,
an earlier incarnation of Draupadi is Naaraayanii/Naalaayanii.
Many thanks for quotes from Sanskrit where Narayana is black, niila,
aJjana, dark, etc.,
Respectfully yours,
N. Ganesan
