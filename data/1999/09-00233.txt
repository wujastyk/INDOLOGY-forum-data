Oh really! where exactly did the EPW guys get this from? What the dear souls
fail to understand is that America has invested a lot of money in trying to
understand countries which are inimical to it as opposed to "friendly"
countries. Note that they invested tons of money on Russian studies thru out
the cold war but this seems to have vanished post 1991. Likewise thru the
70s, they didn't care much about Iran
(when the Shah was around) but promptly jumped in after Khomeini came to
power.
Last year, Prof Ashutosh Varshney( Dept of Govt, Harvard U) was refused
tenure because of a lack of interest in Indian Studies. At that time, I
remember reading that there had been a steady lack of interest in Indian
studies since the second world war..not sure of where this 70s figure comes
from..
You've got to be kidding...If they get Clarence Thomas to tell them why you
shouldn't have affirmative action, half a dozen parties that
I know will want the Bharat Ratna to be given to him...
