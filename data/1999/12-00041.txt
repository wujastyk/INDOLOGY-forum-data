Dear Nanda,
Thanks for that web address, I can assure you I will make good use of it. My
best outlet for used and rare books dealing with indiology is half way up in
the Rocky Mountains of Colorodo -- it will be much easier getting them this
way ( and hopefully my Rocky Mountain treasure trove will be included in the
addreses' dealers).
Helen O.

PS
Great to be on board at this lister service. I have been reading for sometime
now and just decied to begin contributing. (Also--Glad the AIT episode of a
few days ago was cleared up as well.)
