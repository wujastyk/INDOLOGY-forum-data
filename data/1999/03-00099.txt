Let us be clear that the sequences

        pu.nyak.rtaan lokaan
and
        pu.nyak.rtaa.m lokaan

can both lead to a shared sandhi form with a nasal ~l.  Therefore,
phonologically, these readings can remain ambiguous.  In G.A. Jacob's
concordance of the Upanishads (p. 551), the reading with anusvaara is
listed as a form of the word pu.nyak.rt, while the form with the nasal ~l
is listed as a form of the word pu.nyak.rta.  While an explanation from
the words pu.nyak.rtaan lokaan may derive some support from pu.nyajito
loka.h found in the Chaandogya-U (8.1.6), the explanation with
pu.nyak.rtaam (gen of pu.nyak.rt) can derive support from the BG (18.71)
lokaan praapnuyaat pu.nyakarma.naam.  I don't want to insist either way,
but would like to refer to a basic phonological ambiguity.
        Best,
