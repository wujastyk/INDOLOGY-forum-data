dakSiNAmUrti stotra, and Tamil and Kashmir zaivisms
Congratulations, Dr. Palaniappan for an excellent
analysis of Madurai and Chidambaram myths.
Hope scholars will begin to take a closer look at the
relations between Kashmiri texts and the Southern
Saivaite ones.
The traditional rivalry between Chidambaram and Madurai
legends can been seen in the creation of two versions of
Bhakta vilAsams in Sanskrit. These bhakta vilAsams are
adaptations/translations from Tamil PeriapurANam.
One is Agastya bhakta vilAsam, (representing Madurai
branch?) and the other is Upamanyu bhakta vilAsam,
representing Chidambaram branch.
It will be interesting and worthwhile to compare
these two Sanskrit texts.
Regards,
N. Ganesan
