Word splitting & hyphenation conventions in roman              transliteration
Because the texts alltogether lead to the following conclusion:
an initial h ( eg. hi) softens a preceeding mute (eg. tat becomes tad) and is being
changed itself to the soft aspirate of that mute (eg. h becomes dh
since dh is the soft aspirate of the mute t).
tat hi becomes taddhi but never tad dhi.
