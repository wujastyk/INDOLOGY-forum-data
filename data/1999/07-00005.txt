Rta, satya, dharma
You find the verse in a slightly different form in the Bombay editions of
the Mahabharata (with Nilakantha's commentary), 3.113.117 (= Poona Ed. 3,
App. 32, line 65-68). The first line reads:
tarko 'pratiSThaH zrutayo vibhinnA
The rest is as quoted above. According to the Critical Edition, the verse
is found in no other ms. but in Dn (3 late Devanagari mss. containing
Nilakantha's commentary).
Best regards,
