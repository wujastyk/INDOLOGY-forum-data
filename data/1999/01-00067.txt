This is again an example of retrofitting data to suit ones own
preconceived notions. Mr.Andoronov, seems to assume that somehow, so
called Dravidian Languages served as substratum and Indo-Aryan language
first appeared around 1500BC - on what basis is this done ?
How did Andronov come to the conclusion that Indo-Aryan Languages arrived
after 1500BC ?
The dating of the Rgveda ?  based on guesswork by Muller ?
Just say substratum and you have proved Aryan migration  !!!.
Realizing that there is no racial evidence,Mr.Andronov wants us to believe
a strong native tradition was overshadowed by a few nomadic migrants,
who then managed to impose their language and religion over a overwhelming
majority by  recruiting from the native population !!.
Just like their European descendants of today, I presume ? -
This is classic European supremacist nonsense that has to be avoided.
When in doubt, make an assumption and then make more assumptions to
prove whatever one wants.
Even Goebbels would have been impressed.
In a previous message this gem of
scholarly writing was quoted from the Indo-Aryans of South Asia:

Agian,This is the kind of aryan supremacist nonsense that
Jim Shaffer has exposed and called into question.
What might this superior military technology be ?
Chariot Panzers, led by Indra Rommels, shooting Kulturekugels ?
Then surely, the neighing of horses must have sounded like the whistle
of diving Stuka bombers and frightened the Dravidians
 -Objective scholarship indeed!!.
It appears that colonial thinking, WWII and postwar military buildup
in Europe has greatly influenced these scholars.
Theories of Chariot Tanks,Culture Bullets etc indicates that many of
these scholars are basically projecting their adolescent
fantasies and childhood experience onto Indian history.
Those who attribute motives to others, should first look at their
own.
