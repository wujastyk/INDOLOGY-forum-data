There he goes again. Predictable, and annoying.

Can the list moderators please consider publishing a policy regarding
such unsolicited off-topic political propoganda on the INDOLOGY list?

INDOLOGY is an amazing list with a very responsible posting history,
and a tradition of keeping a sharp focus on it's objectives. I'd love
to see it stay that way.

And lastly Mr. Banerjee, if you would really like to discuss defense
strategies, politics, economics and poverty with a mature audience,
may I suggest we wait until your sixteenth birthday?  Perhaps your
perspective on such deep topics will have matured and become more
informed by then.
