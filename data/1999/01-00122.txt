'sari' (Attn: H M Hubey)

Thank you. I was wondering if this word is relatively new, say dating
from
the early Mogul period or something. Or else it is a remarkable
coincidence.
Sari means "yellow", and the word "sar" also is a verb meaning "to
wrap".
I guess I should take it off. Sometimes strange things happen, and some
dimwit
on USENET made changes to what I wrote and made it look like it was from
me.
Best Regards,
Mark
