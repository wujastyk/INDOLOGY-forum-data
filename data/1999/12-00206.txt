Following up on Dr. Cronk's very useful clarification of the views of
Shamkara on the Samkhya position regarding the impossibility of
disequilibrium of prakriti,
given its initial condition of equilibrium and its attendant relationship to
purusha,
I am led to believe that perhaps Shamkara conflated several distinct facets
of the
issue under concern. For example, we learn that, according to Shamkara on
Samkhya, "...it is impossible to understand why it [prakriti] should
sometimes depart from a state of equilibrium...and sometimes not do this."
The reason why it is impossible to understand this is because no force
external to prakriti exists to effectuate such a change (by hypothesis), and
prakriti (at initial time) is in
a state of equilibrium. However, what we can or cannot understand falls
under
the rubric of epistemology and not ontology; ie, the limitations of our
understanding impose no corresponding limitations on what is ontologically
the case in the cosmos (at least I would defend such a position). Next, I
would
argue, contrary to Shamkara, that it is not logically! impossible for
prakriti to
move from a state of equilibrium to disequilibrium without an external force
present. The notion that every event has a cause is a metaphysical principle
that
has, I believe, been questioned in sub-atomic particle physics. Einstein, I
believe,
demurred on this point ("God doesn't play dice with the world."), but this
was
a minority opinion.

So, to sum up, Shamkara may be conflating what is possible or impossible to
understand with what is logically possible or impossible. But these are
certainly two entirely different matters (Leibniz' Principle of Sufficient
Reason notwithstanding.)
