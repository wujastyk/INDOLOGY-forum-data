`(This is) is the meritorious gift of the teacher - - - - - Sachiva. 
Whatever merit is in the this let that be for (removing the 
misery) of all sentient beings.?
This inscription has suffered most since the time of Burgess [see 
``Archaeological Survey of Western India", Vol. IV, ``Reports 
on the Buddhist Cave-Temples and their Inscriptions", p. 137, 
no. 7 and pl. LXI, issued in 1883 as supplementary to the volume 
on ``The Cave-Temples of India"]. [...] In line 3 nothing is legible 
now after du, but Burgess?s plate clearly shows du.hkhamochaa -
 which is apparently a misreading for du.hkha-mocha[naaya*]."
All the best,
