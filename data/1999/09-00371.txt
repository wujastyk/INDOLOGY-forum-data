Dear list members,
I'm searching for translation and/or analysis of two Nyaya-Vaishesika
texts: Shrivallabhas "Nyayalilavati" and Sarvadevas "Pramanamanjari" (If
there are any at all). Furthermore I would like to know if anyone is aware
of some recent treatise or book about Indian Logic.
With kind regards, Anna-Pya Sjodin
