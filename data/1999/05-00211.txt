INDOLOGY Digest - 10 May 1999 to 11 May 1999 (#1999-55)
My family is of the vaDadeSattu vaDama smArtha branch from North Arcot and
are traditionally aligned with the Shankara matham in KAnchIpuram. A friend
of my father, though an Iyengar, is of the same sub caste and also shares
our surname. He is able to trace our line to MahArAshtra during the times of
the Peshwa.
