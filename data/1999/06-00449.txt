Chambaa vaMzaavalii
Dear Prof. Carlos Lopez.
As your suggestion, Prof. Witzel is the best specialist
about vaMzaavaliis , as far as I know. I got a chance to
discuss vaMzaavaliis with him last December. And then, I
began to study Chambaa vaMzaavalii.
I'm now looking for more informations about Chamba state and
vaMzaavaliis.
Thank you for your kindly response.
Sincerely yours.
