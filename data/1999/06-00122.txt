 I do not want to have the final say in this, nor in any other matter. I
simply wanted to point out that your statements regarding the EU's stance on
Turkey, which occurred in a context where some list-members try to paint
secular Turkey as an ideal model for India, appeared to be based on a lack
of knowledge about the actual political situation in Turkey nowadays or a
misunderstanding of that situation. Surely, whatever opinions you have, if
they are based on misinformation or misinterpretation, they become
disputable, no matter whether you are Indian, European, or British :-) This
is the last I shall say on this matter on this list (see point (a) below),
no matter what curiously enraged replies I might unwillingly provoke this
time ...

Occasionally, one offers things to others in order to find out WHETHER they
are interested, and not presuming already THAT they are interested
...anyway, discussing the matter privately could serve the purposes of (a)
removing this subject from a mailing-list where it does not belong, (b)
clearing up misunderstandings or removing ignorance.
