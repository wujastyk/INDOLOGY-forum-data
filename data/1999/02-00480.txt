I want to correct some points mentioned in ganesan-parvata.html posted
on the indology website. It appears its name has been changed by the list 
owner as that of Palaniappan.

In the time of ikSvAku kings what is now called nAgArjunakoNDa could have
been known as siripavata. In one of the inscriptions obtained here it is said

In Andhra people do not use the term parvata to indicate a hill or mountain.
It is too heavy a word for common man. They use "koMDa" or "guTTa". The usage
is "Tirupati koMda" or "yAdagiri guTTa". The word parvata is used for
Sriparvata only. When they want to say that they visited Tirumala they say
"koMDaku pOyoccinAM".Not "parvatAniki pOyoccinAM".

There is a town called bhaTTiprOlu near the Krishna Delta. bhaTTi is supposed

have rumours that bhartRhari was a buddhist for some time. There is a
probability
that bhartRhari could be a native of this place in Andhra.
ON PARVATA
In addition to this Fa-hsien's monastery in South India which he calls as
PAravA or PaRavaTa can be due to wrong pronunciation of "pavata".
