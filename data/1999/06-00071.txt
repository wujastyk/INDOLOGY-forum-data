The statements made in this URL about the Bible can as well apply to the
Rigveda as a source of history.
On the terms used for 'flood' in the Rigveda: there are two references, both
used in the context of barricading or releasing the waters...
arn.a (5.032.010): kha_ni tvam arn.ava_n baddhama_na_ aramn.a_h: Indra sets
open the flood-gates (kha_ni)and liberates the obstructed streams
u_rmi_ (10.030.02): a_syadhvam u_rmim adya_ suhasta_h: (priests) cast today
that flood (of Soma) into (the consecrated water).
Are there IE or Avestan cognates to these two lexemes: arn.a and u_rmi_?
