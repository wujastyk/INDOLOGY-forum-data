Seeking information about "Sarasvati vandana"
I have been trying to find the exact words of
the well-known "Sarasvati vandana" which begins:
  yA kundEndu tushAra hAra dhavaLA
  yA shubhra vastrA vrtA
I searched the web and Usenet and found two
different versions, neither of them convincingly
authoritative.
If anyone here knows the exact words, could they
please post it?  A translation would also be
greatly appreciated.
Also, what is the origin of the "Sarasvati vandana",
i.e., who composed it or which text does it come from?
Thanks in advance,
Raja.
