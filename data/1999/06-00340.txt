Well, if you look at the contemporary scene, there is lot more Western
interest in Abhinavagupta and Tantric studies than in Sankara and Vedanta.
Tantra with its traditional concern with power will also fill in quite
admirably for political purposes. It remains to be seen how Indians
re-appropriate Abhinavagupta.
