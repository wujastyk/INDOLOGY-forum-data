Dear people,

I am a new subscriber to this list, or in fact to any list. I live in Bali and I am interested in understanding the roots of the Hindu culture here. I also lived in India for several years though mainly in Bengal. I have heard that the first traders that bought Hinduisim to Indonesia were from Gujarat. Does anybody know anything about the roots of Hinduisim in Java and Bali?
Also I am looking for a transliteration of the One Thousand Names of Visnu (sahasra nama) if anybody knows of where I can find one.

Thanks before,

Janma Carmody.
