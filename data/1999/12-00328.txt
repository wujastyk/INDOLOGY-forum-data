On zankara's date - 2
Ample evidence has already been presented in the discussions as regards the
date of Sankara. Study of Vedas and performance of sacrifices were  the
tradition of the Brahmins.For this Vedanta was not necessary.It was Sankara
who took to sannyasa against the tradition.He faced the repurcussions
too.The Brahmins boyctted his mother's funeral.It was after Sankara that
Vedanta came to be taught in the Sabhamadhams.
