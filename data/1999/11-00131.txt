Subject: Wilson and the Padma Purana?
Message-ID: <161227053479.23782.7177031292754488730.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Did the 19th century scholar H.H. Wilson translate the
Padma Purana?

How many different sanskrit versions exists of this
purana and how many english translations?

I have been told that the issue of versions of the
Padma Purana is complicated by
(1) the factor of the existence of isolated extant
texts which claim to be supplements to the Purana and
by
(2) the factor of verses that commentators over the
centuries have quoted as being from the Purana that do
not appear in any known extant text purporting to be
part of the Purana.

Also I am interested to find out if there is a
"Upapurana" ie. subsidiary Purana, which bears the
name of Padma Purana?

Any information on this would be greatly appreciated,

Thank you very much,

Ole Alstrup
