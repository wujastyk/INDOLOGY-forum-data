A few questions.
Hi,
It seems that everyone on this list are professors or people with very advanced
knowledge in this field. I 'm just an interested individual without your skills or
knowledge.
I have a few questions which have bugged me for years, but I never had a great
resource such as this to ask them:
I read a book by a guy called P.N Oak about the true origins of the Taj Mahal,
being a temple etc. Is there any truth in this?
Is there any truth to the great epics Mahabharat and Ramayan and where can I get
more info about archeological discoveries relating to these?
Where can I get more info about the city of Dwarka discovered under the sea?
I would be grateful if anyone can answer these questions for me?
Thanks
Ketan Kalyansingh
