Ajanta Cave No. 10
Dear Colleagues,
I wonder if anybody familiar with Ajanta could furnish
particulars about the donor of Ajanta Cave 10, who wrote:
"may whatever merit is in this, be for the release from
miseries of all sentient creatures".
How is it in original, what is the name and/or designation
of the "dAtA"?
With mettA
