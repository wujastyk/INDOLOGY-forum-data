e-text of Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
[The] project to produce an electronic version of Bloomfield's Vedic
Concordance [is delivering its first phalaani]:
About 1/3 of the book is now on line at
        www.dslo.unibo.it/iniz.html
The format for the time being is Macintosh NisusWriter (which may be
downloaded for free at the Nisus site). I am quite delighted with my
student's work and hope that he will finish it before next summer.
All the best,
Alex
