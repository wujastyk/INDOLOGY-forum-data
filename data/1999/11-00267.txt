Dear List Members,
I have heard about a scholar who is supposed to be working on a dictionary
of nyaaya or navya-nyaaya terms. (I think it was someone in Vienna.) If
anybody has knowledge of whom it is conducting this work I would be very
glad to receive his or her e-mail address.

Thanks for any help
