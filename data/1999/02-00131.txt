Mount Potalaka in Malaya mountains - forgeries
Dear Mr. Ganesan
I will try to check about the forgery but first I would like to make sure we are
talking about the same title. I do not know any of the Western translations, so I
would just like to know whether the XuanZangs geography you mention and you
are interested in translated by Beal and Waters is the Da4tang2 xi1yu4ji4,
Taisho 2487 written by Bian4 Ji1 <color><param>0100,0100,0100</param><FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger>{HYPERLINK "../aut/aut00842.htm"}in Tang Dynasty in twelve fasciculy (which is
the only reliable source of information about India in relation to Xuan Zang
that I know about). However only its first 10 fasciculi which never mentions
South India. If this is the book you are interested I will try to find out more
about the forgeries or additions.
Sincerely
Petr Mares
