Help with a samskr*t sloka on Shiva
=====
This is in response to the enquiry given below about two shlokas on Shiva:
The first one:
    "svayam panchamukah putrau gajAnana-ShadAnanau |
     digambarah kaTham jIvEt annapUrNau na chEt grihE?"
is perhaps from ChaNakya Shataka.
The other one is most probably from "bhoja-prabhanda":
    "svayam mahEshah, shvashurO nagEshah,
          sakhA dhanEshas, tanayO gaNEshah |
   tathA api bhikShAtanam Eva shambhOh
          balIyasI kEvalam IshvarEchChA ||"
-meaning , what prevails ultimately is God's will!
Sincerely,
-Harihareswara
Stockton, California.

Dear zubhASita specialists,
  can anybody gimme the samsr*t original of the zloka that goes as:
  "[despite] his father-in-law being the kind og the himalayas and the
god of wealth( kubera) being his servant, the lord of the world lives in a
crematorium on alms collected in his bowl".
( This is in praise of ziva)..
If of any help( and if my memory serves me correctly), this zloka connects
to another zloka which goes as:
  svayameva paJcavaktra: putrau gajAnana-shaDAnanau
   digambara: kathaM jivet annapUrNA na chedgr*he..
Regards,
kr*SNa
