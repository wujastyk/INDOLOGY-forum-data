I was facinated with Nanda Chandran's view of "proper" Brahmins. It made
me reflect on the fact that Buddhism and Jainism, regarded as evil
heterodoxies during the early period were largely associated and drew
their strength from urban culture and urban folk. They especially appealed
to the more fluid caste relations in urban as opposed to rural
environments. Chandran is absolutely right in identifying Brahmin strength
to the rural environments where Brahmanism at least from the medieval
period florished, where caste relations were more amenable to be
modeled according to Dharmashastric models.
