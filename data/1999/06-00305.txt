Baa.na?s aakhyaayikaa (prose novel) Har.sacarita (7th century 
A.D.) contains a (remarkable) biography of the author in the 
first three chapters. Cf., e.g., Siegfried Lienhard, A History of 
Classical Poetry, Sanskrit - Pali - Prakrit, Wiesbaden: Otto 
Harrassowitz 1984 (= A History of Indian Literature. III.1.), pp. 
249 ff.
