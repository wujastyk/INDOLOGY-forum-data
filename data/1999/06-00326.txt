This was news to me. Is there any indication of when an Indian-language
renderer might appear?
"Alphabetic Code for Information Interchange".
No, ISCII is a 7-bit standard. The first sentence of the published
standard (IS 13194: 1991) runs, "The ISCII code specifies a 7-bit code
table which can be used in 7 or 8-bit ISO compatible environment." Also
note that ISCII is not restricted to Devanagari: it can represent any
Brahmi-derived Indian script. It is quite an experience to see an aged
MS-DOS computer effortlessly "converting" an on-screen piece of Indian
text into script after script using CDAC's old product ALP (now available
as ALPP -- ALP Personal -- for free download from their website).
