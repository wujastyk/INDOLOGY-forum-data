Indus Valley Script used by tribals in Bihar, May 1999
Hi,
Please check out the following URL:

This is an abstract of a talk by Dr. Anand M. Sharan,professor of Mechanical
engineering at the Memorial University of Newfoundland.
I am naturally thrilled by this report, since it adds grist to my hypothesis
that the inscriptions were lists of bronze-age weapons; Mundas of Santal
Paragan.as and Ranchi belt, are metallurgists par excellence...
Best regards,
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
