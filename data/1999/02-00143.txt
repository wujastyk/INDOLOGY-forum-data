Dear KIM Jae-sung
Thank you for the reply and the advice. Unfortunately I cannot read
Japanese and I cannot find anybody working on the sutra from the
Chinese speaking community.

Do you know about any scholar in your department or University
who currently reaserch the Lankavatara or anything related? I am
also very interested in the Dharani of this sutra and how it found its
way there.

I wonder why this sutra seems to be abondoned and why
MiaoFaLianHua - Lotus and DaBanNiePan - Mahaparinirvana Sutra
in Japan and  ShouLengYen - Surangama and HuaYen -
Avatamsaka Sutra in Taiwan are preferred. What do you think?

Do you know whether prof. Takasaki still works on this sutra and
its origin?

Are there no Indian Scholars interested in this scripture at all?

Sincerely

Petr Mares
