There is a name for this in Indology. It ia called "text torturing".
I want to point out that the adjuctive "dakshiNa" is used for people
and the word "parvata" does not have this adjuctive. There is no logic
or justification at all for dragging the adjuctive used for the people
and linking it with "parvata" except that it suits us.
This is in addition to the text torturing done to the word
"dakshiNAtya" which has a well defined meaning in sanskrit
literature.
