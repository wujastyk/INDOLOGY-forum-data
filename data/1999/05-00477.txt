Pronunciation of word final "a" in sanskrit
I was wondering about the same. Does this have anything to
with the Nagari script? Not only the word final "a"s,
sometimes even internal "a"s are sometimes shortened,
though not to the extent of final "a"s.
In the South, the word final "a" is pronounced as full.
