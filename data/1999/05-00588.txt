TuLu  &  KonkaNI  brahmins
Both  TuLu  and  KonkaNI  brahmins  claim  Northern  Indian  origins.
The  oral  tradition  existing  among  the  TuLu  brahmins  is  that
they  came  from  Ahicchatra  which  some  have  identified  with  a
village  near  modern  Rae-Bareilly  in  UP.  One  of  my  teachers,
the  late  Dr. Padur  Gururaja  Bhatt  agreed  with  this  theory.

Among  the  KonkaNI  brahmins,  the  SArasvats  have  long  claimed
that  they  came  from  KashmIr.  The  GauDa-SArasvats  claim  that
they  are  a  branch  of  the  SArasvats  who  were  brought  from
GauDadesha  (Bengal)  by  Sage  ParashurAma.  Even  today,  they  eat
fish  just  like  the  Bengali  brahmins.
