Respected Dr. Witzel

Thank you for this important information. A few quick Q's

From: Michael Witzel <witzel at FAS.HARVARD.EDU>
"other texts of the Paipp. tradition (Paddhatis of the
Paithinasi GS and the Angirasakalpa also have been filmed for editorial
work)."

VA: Paithinasi GS or Dharmasutra? Are these the same Paddhatis which
Durgamohan Bhattacharya mentioned ("Fundamental themes of the Atharvaveda")?
Will the complete oral recordings of Paippalada Samhita be used for
preparing the critical edition? Any manuscipts of the Agastya Kalpa
(mentioned as the Kalpa of Paippaladins in 'Prapancahridaya')? Paippalada
Brahamana? Any new manuscripts of the Parisishatas?

MW: "followed up her earlier studies on the concept of the Brahmacarin by an
investigation of Paipp. Samh. 20 and Taittiriya Upanisad"
"from the Paippalada Atharvaveda to the complete giving up
of wealth  of the  Katha Upanisad."

VA: Any new light on the supposedly Atharvanic origins of the TU and KU?
(Eg. "Sumantu and Kashyapa are the seers of the Brahmana and the Aranyaka":
Carayaniya Mantrashadhyaya)

Thank you in advance for the replies

Vishal
