Mahabharata in Gandhara
Dear indologists,
I am currently looking for any information about
connections between Mahabharata and Gandharan art.
I would be peculiarly interested in representations
of some scenes of the Mahabharata in Gandhara, despite
the fact that I am not even sure they exist.
If some of you could indicate me an article on this
topic, or even simply show me a photograph of such
a representation, I would be deeply interested.
Best regards,
Magali Vacherot.
