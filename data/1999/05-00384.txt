Dear Vidyasankar,
I greatly sympathize with your point. I would also add that a philosophy is
not dead just because it has no living school supporting it. I think a view
should be called dead only when it is no longer relevant: either it has been
proven false or it is not addressing problems that interest anyone.
Rather we could let some fresh air into their sick-room.
Yours, Ferenc
