Subject: Sanskrit words ending in cerebral N

In our known vocabulary of Sanskrit, there are no words which end in
cerebral N.  However, in the formulation of the sandhi rules as given in
Panini (8.3.32) and the Pratisakhyas (e.g. Zaunakiiya-Caturaadhyaayika
3.2.2), such a case is always included. The commentators are generally
hardpressed to find examples, and the example cited by the commentaries is
something like sugaN+iti > sugaNNiti.  While the word sugaN "a good
counter" derived from the root gaN is not found in literature to the best
of my knowledge, the fact that such a case is included almost unanimously
by the grammarians is of some significance.  I have always wondered if
there were colloquial Sanskrit usages that have not come down to us.
