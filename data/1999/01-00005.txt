Postmodernistic Study of Sanskrit texts?
Reading Rita Gross, Buddhism after Patriarchy, SUNY.
This is a feminist reconstruction of Buddhism. A beautiful
study.
Like this, has there been any attempts to view the
Vedic material created by Indian priestly class from a
Postmodernist perspective?
Any citations?
Thanks,
