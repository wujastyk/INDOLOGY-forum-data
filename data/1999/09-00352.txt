Dear members of the list,

A colleague has asked me to post the following query.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt

*****************************

Dear colleagues,

I am looking for a bibliographic reference. The only data I have got are the
following ones:

Possible title of book: "Substitution of Similars"
Author: Jevons.

I have not been able to come up with more details about this book. The
reference I have got is from the Loeb edition of Plato's Republic. Jevons'
book
may, however, have relevance to Indological studies as well.
