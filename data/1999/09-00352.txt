Query about book
Dear members of the list,
A colleague has asked me to post the following query.
With best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
*****************************
Dear colleagues,
I am looking for a bibliographic reference. The only data I have got are the
following ones:
Possible title of book: "Substitution of Similars"
Author: Jevons.
I have not been able to come up with more details about this book. The
reference I have got is from the Loeb edition of Plato's Republic. Jevons'
book
may, however, have relevance to Indological studies as well.
