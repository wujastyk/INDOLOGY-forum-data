I do not know. Clearly it cannot think *with* anything, as it is completely
isolated. It might itself be able to think, perhaps in a more or less
limited sense; e.g. only in concepts (with meanings only, deprived of any
reference), or, an even more reduced ability: only with logical words (and,
or, not) and pronouns (variables [some, all] and deictic [I]).
    If even this is unacceptable, one could try to interpret SK 64 in a
roundabout way. The buddhi (or antaHkaraNa) will then think in a kind of
meta-language - something like this: "If you, puruSa, could think, you would
be right in thinking: 'the buddhi is not me; it is not mine; I am not the
buddhi'."
    This latter solution seems to me rather complicated; anyway, all of this
is - and I am afraid, must remain for ever - mere speculation. A pity.
