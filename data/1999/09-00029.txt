2 Urdu books offered on exchange
Jim,
I just sent these out on CONSALD and INDOLOGY and apparently didn't
make it as clear as I thought that Islamabad was supplying them to
program participants.  Anyway, it occurred to me that maybe when we
wind up with other extra copies of books from Pakistan I should
automatically set aside a copy for the URLC.  Do they have difficulty
becoming aware of or obtaining Urdu books from Pakistan? Ask Murali
etc.  Please also give my warmest regards to everyone there.

well got up. Both titles are have already been included in the
Library's cooperative acquisitions program for Pakistan.  They are
