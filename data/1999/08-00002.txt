Indian Calendar Astronomical Data
Harry,
Have you considered getting one of the many 'Vedic' (i.e., Hindu) astrology
programs available on the market? I believe several of them are capable of
generating panchangas. If this sounds useful to you, try browsing the Web
for 'Parashara's Light', 'Sri Jyoti', and/or 'Goravani Jyotish' -- so far as
I know, those are the leading brands.
