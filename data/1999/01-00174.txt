A quote from Berger (p. 456):
"During his stay at Dasgupta's house he [Eliade] became romantically
involved with Dasgupta's sixteen-year-old daughter, Maitreyi, causing him to
be thrown out of Dasgupta's house. Heartbroken, Eliade spent a few months in
the Himalayas, where he practiced Yoga in an ashram.  Returning to Romania,
he published in 1933 the novel Maitreyi, based on the diary he had kept in
India."
