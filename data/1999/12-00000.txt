While I do not know how exactly Shourie is derived, the following two bits
might be useful
1. Arun Shourie is a Punjabi Brahmin (to my knowledge)
2. Amongst Punjabis, Shourie as such is often used as a nickname for people
with the name 'Kishore' (Just like Bob for Robert). I know the example of a
'Shourie' Uncle from my childhood. His real name was Kishore Gupta.

Dear listers,

How is the last name Shourie as in Arun Shourie explained from
Punjabi? Is it related to Kuru country?, k & sh are interchangeable
in Vedic and Tamil (s/sh written in ta. as 'c')? Is it connected with
kulUTa, ulUTa, kuli(/u)dhara in Vedas? How is panchAla toponym
and pancha-jana in RV explained? In tamil, ko.lu = plough share,
u_lu = "to plough", u_lavar = farmer, ... (These words of farming
are several orders of magnitude important in CT than nAJcil).

Regards,
N. Ganesan, PhD
