Several of the inscriptions mentioning Ramanuja
date from the early to mid 12th century, i.e.,
either during Ramanuja's lifetime or shortly
thereafter.  There are others which mention
Ramanuja's immediate disciples such as Anantalvan
and Kidambi Accan.

Most of these inscriptions are with reference
to Ramanuja's activity in Melkote and at a temple
(I forget the name) prior to its renovation.
