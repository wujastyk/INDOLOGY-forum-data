> Dear fellow-indologists,
>
> Luxuriating in the mid-year break  between semesters I've taken the time to
> rent a video tape of Deepa Mehta's _Fire_ [the New Yorker Films release in
> the U.S. preceded the Bal Thackery induced demonstrations of recent weeks].
> And for what it's worth, I'd like to publically commend her on this forum
> for a masterful work of fiction.  What impressed me most about this film,
> apart from the grave circumspection with which potentially titillating
> episodes were uniformly treated--no soft porn voyeurism offered here,
> unlike Mira Nair's travesty called _Kamasutra_ last year--is the sympathetic
> humanity with which ALL the principals are characterized--yes, even the
> less-than-loving husbands.  For me at least, everything rang true--even the
> genesis of lesbianism between long-suffering Radha and newly disillusioned
> Sita.  Not, I hasten to add, because of any opinion of my own I have to
> offer on the subject of the plausibility or frequency of such a turn in
> real life--rather, only in terms the actions arising logically out of given
> plot and character elements set forth, again as telling fiction.
>
> So...what I'd like to know, first off, is whether any others of you have
> seen the film and would like to discuss its merits as an indological text.
> Can anyone share any URLs for published reviews in the Indian press?  Here,
> for starters are some I found via States-side search engines:
