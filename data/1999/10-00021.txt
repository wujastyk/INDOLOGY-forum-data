               slander and peer pressure
I have discussed the multiple approach of Krishna to the problem of
Arjuna in my recent article on the Bhagavad-giitaa (second of a
series being published in successive issues) in the magazine,
'Yoga and Health', October 1999, published from UK. It touches,
among other things, the point you have raised. If you are serious,
you may have a look into the first article too which discusses the
nature of and appropriate approach to the text.
I was amused to find you apparently think that the Vedic literature
includes the Bhagavad-giitaa. The Bhagavad-giitaa is part of the
archaic epic Mahaa-bhaarata by Vyaasa (Bhiishma-parvan, i.e. the
6th book, Adhyaayas 25-42). Incidentally, what do you think is the
extent of the Vedic literature?
Best wishes.
