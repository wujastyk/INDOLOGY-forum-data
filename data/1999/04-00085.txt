The elephant naLagiri/nalagiri
The many variations, nAlAgiri (vin.), nALAgiri (Burmese version),
nalaagiri (Kashmiri version of b.rhatkathaa), ... are interesting.
Tamil version of b.rhatkathaa calls an elephant, naLakiri (=naLagiri)
resembling a black, huge mountain. Like the mahabharata epic
characters, naLa and naaLaayaNii, this naLagiri may also represent
'black'.
