Subject: [q] Seeking information on "hiraNyagarbha" ceremony
Message-ID: <161227045736.23782.8026859246214192245.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Could someone please help me with references to "hiraNyagarbha" ceremony,
where the rulers were inserted into a large womb-like gold vessel,
subsequently emerged "reborn," and thus became possessed of _kshatriya_
status.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,                        --Sreenivas
