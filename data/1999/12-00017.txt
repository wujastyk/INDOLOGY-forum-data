AIT
Dear Indology-List members,
please accept my respectful greetings.
        Since no discussions about AIT (Aryan Invasion Theory) are allowed here, I
would like to ask to at least provide as many as possible Internet addresses
where these discussions are held (in any possible form: both scientific and
non-scientific).
        Thank You very much in advance.
With best wishes,
Sergei Schmalz.
