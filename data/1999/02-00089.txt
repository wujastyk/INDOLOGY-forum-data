ayurveda in Europe?
1) When was ayurvedic knowledge introduced in Europe?
2) Was the knowledge transferred by Arabian scholas (al-Biruni, et al)?
3) Does the knowledge in the Ayur-vedic scriptures talk about the
circulation of the blood? (i.e. is it possible that Harvey could have
gotten the idea from ayurveda?)
4) What are the best, from an academic, scholarly, standpoint, books on
ayurveda? And where do I find references about transmission issues?
