sAri, the Indian dress
Dear Thiru. LS,
Thanks for pointing out the "sky garment" in Parpola.
Tamil has "tAr" for both a) flower mAlA and b) weapon, army;
tAr-kANittal = bestowing authority/title (like kaN-kANi).
tAr =garland/weapon may fit the priest-king's dress(tArpya).
Dr. Witzel in his Sep. '99 EJVS paper has pointed out several
k and s/z word-initial variants in foreign loan words:
eg., kambala/zambara, kabara/zabara, kIsta/zISTa, kimIdin/zimIdaa,
kambu/zambu, kirAta/cilAta, etc., Dr. Southworth has suggested
Dr. *kIndu > sindhu river (Erdosy, 1994).
If this k/s/z alterations are admissible, then several words
can be looked into. As a pointer, I talked of two words.
1) dr. kalkoTa > zarkoTa nAgam (karkoTa dynasty, 600 AD)
and 2) kATi > zATI. For zATI, tamil kAzh, kAzhakam must also be
looked into. Anyway, these are just possibilities if the
k => z/s changes are ok in Sanskrit.
Thanks & Warm regards,
N. Ganesan
