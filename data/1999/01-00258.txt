How so???
Interestingly Parpola makes use of the Rg Veda and
other scriptures ...
I know Prof. Parpola's publications well.
The answer is quite complex. At the very least,
The book, "Deciphering the Indus script" if available
widely and affordably in India,
the elitist status quo and dominance will be in for a shake-up.
I have tried to explain some aspects for few years now
in Indology.
