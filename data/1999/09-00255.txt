Tamil Heritage
  This is something new I have not heard of. Is there a quote?
  OTOH:
  Kapilar, a brAhman, enjoys eating meat and drinking liquor while partying
with Kings. He sings about these parties several centuries before
Thiruvalluvar.
Comparable with Yajnavalkya relishing fatty beaf in SB.
  Thiruvalluvar chides brahmins for making animal slaughters in
the performance of Vedic sacrifices. "avi corintu aayiram vETTalin2
on2Ran2 uyir cekuttu uNNAmai nan2Ru".
