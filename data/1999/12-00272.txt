GT>In the RV the word *ziva'* occurs about fifty times, primarily as
GT>an adjective, occasionally as a substantive. As an adjective it is
GT>applied to many gods: not only to Rudra, but also to Agni, Indra,
GT>Mitra, VAyu and PUSan. It appears in the dual modifying
GT>DyAvApRthivI. In the feminine plural it modifies unnamed goddesses
GT>of the rivers. Not just gods but friends in general are said to be
GT>*ziva*, as are helpers, guests, messengers and protectors also.
GT>There is no instance of *ziva'* as a proper name 'Shiva'.

Substrates in OIA, Sep. '99 EJVS paper has pointed out several
k and z word-initial variants in foreign loan words:
eg., kambala/zambara, kabara/zabara, kIsta/zISTa, kimIdin/zimIdaa,
kambu/zambu, kirAta/cilAta, etc.

VmV -> VvV example: tamizh > skt. dramiDa > skt. draviDa (Zvelebil).
Similarly, a formation:
drav. kema(good, red) > *kiva > skt. ziva.

Comments are welcome,
