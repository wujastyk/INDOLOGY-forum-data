Subject: Help: a quote from kAdambarI edition
Message-ID: <161227049279.23782.7969259442320695646.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Respected Indology members,

I read somewhere that the great editor, K. P. Paraba has
written something about Southern Saivaite teachers travel to
the North to teach. In Paraba's Kadambari edition. In the Foreword?

Can you please give what Sri. Paraba writes about Southern
Saivaite teachers? Possibly in:
K. P. Paraba, a) kAdambarIkathAsAra of Abhinanda
OR b) kAdambarI, Delhi: Naga Publishers, 1985.

May be in D. N. Lorenzen's book on Kapalikas and Kalamukhas also.
Interested in Bhairava or Shaivaite ascetics travelling to
North. Any quotes from Sanskrit texts is appreciated.

In anticipation of useful data,
Yours sincerely,
SM
