Nehru and Persian/Arabic

 Yet Hindi films are widely screened in the Arab world. Some are dubbed,
but many ARE NOT. Arabs can easily understand Hindustani after watching a
few Hindi films. The same goes vice versa.
 `Pure Urdu' (good ones) dictionaries contain only Arabic and Persian
words, and the script is the same.
  For students of French and Spanish it proves just as big a pain to learn
Latin as those of Hindustani to learn New Persian.
