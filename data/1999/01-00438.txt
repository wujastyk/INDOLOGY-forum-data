Looking for books
Dear list members,
I am looking for editions of GautamIya-tantra and/or Brihad-gautamiya-tantra. Does anybody know a library or publisher who has this book?
Does anyone know the dates these books were composed?
I am also looking for a scholar of the NimbArka-sampradAya who would be willing to correspond with me.
Thank you very much.
Jan Brzezinski
