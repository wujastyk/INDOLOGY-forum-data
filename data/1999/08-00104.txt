Subject: pANi as style/school
Message-ID: <161227051610.23782.9945098639333915984.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

    The following quote says pANi is "said to be from %{paN}
  the hand RV". But while talking of IE cognates "Orig.
  %{palni}". This is not clear to me.

     Is pANi from paN or palni? Does Sayana say that
  pANi is from paN-? What is the cognate of pANi in
  Old Iranian? Is hasta in Old Iranian? How is the
  retroflex -N- in pANi explained  while comparing with IE cognates?

  Regards,
  V. Iyer
