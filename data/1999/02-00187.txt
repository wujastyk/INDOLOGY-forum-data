Potalaka
    Dear Prof. Schalk,
    I went thru' the Indology archives carefully.
    The Postings equating Mt. Potalaka, the abode of Avalokitezvara,
    to Potiyil/Potikai/Potiyam in Malaya mountains never talk of
    the date of arrival of Buddhism in Tamil country.
    Or, am I missing something?
    Regards,
