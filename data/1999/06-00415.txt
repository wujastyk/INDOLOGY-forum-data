Date of Nagarjuna
Thanks, unfortunately I was (and still am) looking for recent discussions
in Japanese sources. Mabbett's article is great, but he has very few
references to non-Western language scholarship on this issue. I was just
wondering if anyone had dealt with this problem in Japan after Ichimura's
article (1991?).
