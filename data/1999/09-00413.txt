"It was Ptolemy's theory of 'epycycles' which was adopted by the
Roman Catholic Church."

Do you really mean that, Richard? You can't mean that the RC Church
"adopted" Ptolemy's theory of epicycles as official RC doctrine. If it had,
then, even today, the RC Church would insist that its adherents accept the
Ptolemaic theory. It doesn't.

Just for the record, I am not a Roman Catholic.
