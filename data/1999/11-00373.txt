Another (!) Subhashita search (the trouble with ali)
        That can be easily answered, if You look up the word in MW dictionary. It's
not just a common bee, rather a large black bee with a sting (there are
quite a lot of these in India, I saw myself many in Mayapur). Hence, it's an
sevakAdhama, because it tends to sting us. :(
