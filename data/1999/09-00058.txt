Please be more specific.
I donot even know where Dr. Thompson lives and
I did not suggest that you would personally turn up on Dr. Thompson's doorstep.
What you have presented, is in my opinion a veiled threat, an attempt at
intimidation suggesting that "something may happen if....".
This is a racist remark. I do not speak as a representative of the "White
race". My views are personal.
