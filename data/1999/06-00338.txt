Original  Dravidian  Homeland

To avoid misunderstandings: the African origin of Homo sapiens is on a
different time-scale from the supposed immigration of Dravidians. The
dispersal could happen more than a hundred thousand years ago, and even
modern man (H. sapiens sapiens) was in Europe before 30 000 BCE. And,
considering the speed of linguistic change, we cannot meaningfully talk of
any language family before ca. 8 000 BCE. (I joust doubled the period we
have some knowledge of.)
I (being a Hungarian speaker) thought over the suggested connection between
Dravidian and Finno-Ugoric languages. The idea is correct, not too naive,
but very far from proven.
