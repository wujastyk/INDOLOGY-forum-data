Urgent help requested
Can any kind soul please send me the Samskrt original of the
subhAzita which goes as
" varameko guNiputro" and ends "tArAgaNo'pica"
and translates as:
  It is better to have one good son than (many/100) useless ones.
  Just as one sun outshines the whole collection of stars
The scholar who will help me out a critical juncture will have his/her
puNya increase a 1000-fold...
Regards,
Krishna
