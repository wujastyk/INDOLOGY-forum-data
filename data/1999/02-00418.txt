We have a very vivid description of the deity at vEGkaTam in cilappatikAram
(not later than 5th century AD) as given below. In that text, it was already a
pilgrimage site. The description is very detailed in terms of his conch,
discus, etc.

I do not know why Ramanuja had to establish (or re-establish) vaiSNava claim.
The AzvArs had several hymns dedicated to viSNu at vEGkaTam. Of course, some
staunch zaivites had always claimed (UVS's teacher was one of them) that the
deity at vEGkaTam was originally ziva.
But I agree with the point - the present day affiliation may not be the same
as the one two millennia ago.
