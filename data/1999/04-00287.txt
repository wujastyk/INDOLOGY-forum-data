Dear Dr. Ganesan,

There are several early  (7th c.) Miroku (jp. Maitreya) in a rajalila
pose. It was quite a common pose for early Korean and Japanese
Maitreya.  One well known wooden image from Chuguji, a convent
associated with Horyuji, is illustrated in P. Mason, History of Japanese
Art. It is pretty much a copy of a slightly earlier Korean sculpture. If
you start searching I think you will be overwhelmed with small Korean
bronzes.
I am not aware of any Cambodian images . . . but you might risk an email
to my advisor at UCLA, Robert Brown, RLBrown at humnet.ucla.edu. He is a
Khmer specialist. I am thinking you might also get lucky with Cham
images?
What are you working on, sounds interesting?
Mary
