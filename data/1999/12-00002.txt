I am appalled that Dr. R Z continues to post such pathetic messages. I would
infact urge forum members to read his recent posts at the RISA-L forum in
response to a Ms. Nair which shows the fanatical Christian attitude of Dr.
RZ. (confirming doubts raised by others in this very forum)
For that matter, I am amused that Dr. RZ should attach so much importance to
the work of a 'NON PROFESSIONAL' Indologist like Rajesh Kochar.
My own personal assessment is that it was Dr. Zydenbos who UNFAIRLY brought
Nazis into this dispute in the first place. So why blame Dr. Elst? And Dr.
Zydenbos was the one who assumed that Indigenists are all Hindutavaadis. So
it his 'reassurance' which is surprising. Some people just cannot shed
pre-conceived notions.

I don't know whether the 'debate', in Dr. Elst's personal view, includes
Rajesh Kochhar's recent book _The Vedic People: Their History and
Geography_ (Orient Longman, 1999). As far as I know, Elst has not
hacked that one yet. There was an article about it in _The Hindu_ a
short while back:
I found it quite reassuring to see that a leading Indian natural
scientist (director of the National Institute of Science, Technology
and Development Studies, New Delhi) with an interest in ancient
Indian history need not be a card-carrying Hindutvavaadin.
