Why, I would think Indian philosophy has at least as much right of
citizenship in Indology as, say, cultural politics, linguistics and
fantalinguistics.

I am not sure that saMkalpa is a more "purposeful" activity. In SK 27 manas
is said to partake of the nature of both karmendriya and buddhIndriya.
Apparently, it is a (sort of) buddhindrIya because it "grasps" things as
senses do (indriyam sAdharmyAt). But at the same time it is a (sort of)
karmendriya because it does so by actively "conforming" (saMkalpakam)
each distinct passive sensation (aural, visual etc.) into a synthetic whole
which is perception. Manas is the organ of synthetic perception, building on
the discrete sensations of the different senses.

In any case, be it as it may with the respective value of adhyavasAya and
saMkalpa, my point was that either (I vote for the former) is the source of
deliberation, while the puruSa is utterly devoid of will.
