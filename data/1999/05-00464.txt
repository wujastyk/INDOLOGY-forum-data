Date of Vayu Purana and Manimekhalai
Dear Indologists,
I was collecting some information for a proposed website and wanted some
information on the dates of the above texts. I have read several editions of
the Purana and have also encountered 2 English  translations of the other
(which is a Tamil text) but the information contained in the introductions,
as well in the Journal articles on them is confusing/contradictory.
I will duly acknowledge all valuable help in the website.
Best regards,
Vishal
