 Forgot to ask last time,

 Uraiyur, supposed to be uragapura of Gadval plates, is intriguing.
 Just one or two decades before, Mahendravarman has excavated
 the cave temple at Tiruchy - the famous Gangadhara panel
 in the Rockfort. Was any area around Kaveri brought under
 Pandyas between say, 640-680 AD? I thought Pallavas
 were reigning supreme in the Chola realm then and
 Pandyas have not risen at all.
