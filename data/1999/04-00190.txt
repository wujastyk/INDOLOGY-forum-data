uraga and AlavAy
 Forgot to ask last time,
 Uraiyur, supposed to be uragapura of Gadval plates, is intriguing.
 Just one or two decades before, Mahendravarman has excavated
 the cave temple at Tiruchy - the famous Gangadhara panel
 in the Rockfort. Was any area around Kaveri brought under
 Pandyas between say, 640-680 AD? I thought Pallavas
 were reigning supreme in the Chola realm then and
 Pandyas have not risen at all.
