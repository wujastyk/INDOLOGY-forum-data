Whatever  the realities of the discussion are, could we please avoid using
expressions such as "obscurantist", "fraudulently", "intellectual fraud" and
"paranoia"? The polite assumption is always that your opponent is wrong, not
that he wilfully distorts facts - UNLESS you can DEMONSTRATE  that your
opponent is consciously dishonest.  A discussion where such perceptions as the
ones above are stated explicitly immediately turns the discussion into a common
quarrel that is of no interest to the list.
