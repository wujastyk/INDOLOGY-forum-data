The way I read Rajaram, he certainly would deny the so-called "invasion" theory.
My point was not to start this debate all over, but rather to point to the fact
that lack of information in Indian sources does not necessarily mean that the
migration did not take place. Talageri's reading of the Vedas and Puranas is
more problematic than Talageri himself and Rajaram would seem to realize. I am
now trying to work out an epistemological argument related to these matters for
a paper which I am preparing, and I am afraid that you will have to wait for my
paper for a more detailed answer.
That is perfectly correct. The sources are about a 1000 years old. But
Scandinavian religion is extremely archaic, and the historiography of Snorri
would very likely have contained a myth or account of origins if such an account
had been available to him.
East and west are always relative entities. I believe that airyanam vaejo has
been assumed to be in Bactria somewhere, but I am not an expert on these
matters, so I'll let them rest.
It is an argument if you explain why you dismiss the Pauranic accounts. Since
you obviously distrust the invasionists, let me suggest that you read Dilip K.
Chakrabarti on the Puranas in his book Colonial Indology. Ch. is not an
invasionist.
