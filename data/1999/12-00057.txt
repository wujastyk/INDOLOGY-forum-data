early substrate
Substrate languages in Old Indo-Aryan,
EJVS, 5-1 (1999), p.1
"Since the Twenties, the area of the newly discovered Indus
civilization has been regarded, beginning with J. Bloch, as
having been populated by Dravidian speakers, while other early
20th century scholars such as S. Levy and J. Przyludski have
stressed the Austro-Asiatic (Munda) substrate of Northern India,
- both are positions that have been maintained until today
(e.g., Burrow, Emeneau, Parpola vs. Kuiper, Hock, *Southworth*)."
On conflicting view on F. Southworth's position, pl. see:
A. F. Sjoberg, The impact of Dravidian on Indo-Aryan: An overview,
inE. C. Polome, W. Winter, Reconstructing Languages and Cultures,
1992:Mouton de Gruyter, p.515
" Significantly, *Southworth* discounted the possibility of Munda
influences on Dravidian and on Indo-Aryan in the early period,
though Munda languages were important later (cf. Fairservis-
Southworth 1986)."
