TRIKUTA

In the commentry of bElArAja on vAkyapadIya 2.486

we have

"paravatAt trikUTaikadEzavat(varti?) trilinga dEzAditi"

The fact that there is a place by the name trikUTa in the Guntur District
of Andhra Pradesh, the area in which dhAnyakaTaka and zriparvata are located,
can be seen from the inscriptions of kings of AnandagOtra and the
viSNukuNDinas who ruled this area. These people who ruled from 300 A.D.-
400 A.D. had their kingdom confined to Guntur, Krishna and Godavari
Districts of Andhra Pradesh and could not have been kings of any other
trikUTa except that which lies in their realms.

One of the inscriptions of the viSNukuNDina kings says,

"zrI dEvavarmNaH priyaputras trikUTamalayAdhipatir nayasattvasaMpannO
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
bhagavac crIparvatasvAmipAdAnudhyAtO...."

Epigraphia Indica, vol 18, page 338.

AnandagOtra kings also said they were trikUTAdhipatis.

Malaya mandala is identified as Kovvur and Nidudavole taluks
of West Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh.

trikUTa is provisionally identified with the well known
saiva kshetra kOTappa konDa in Guntur District.
