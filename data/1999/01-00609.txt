Militancy and non-secularism
Are increasing militancy and non-secularism appropriate indological
pursuits? If so, it would be interesting to see unemotional scholarship on
why Hindu militancy is rising at a disproportionately higher rate than other
militancy. It would also be interesting to try and relate the ebbs and tides
of secularism in India compared with experiences of other cultures.
