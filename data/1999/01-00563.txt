Deepa Mehta's _Fire_
to the real world of the Hindus. There's still a billion of us alive, you
know....~sumedh
   I would hope that the references to current events submitted to this
indology list is in effect a sincere calling to shed light on these and
other tragedies that indology subscribers could best accomplish rather
than stand on its own as some sort of invective, or provoke sardonic
responses regardless of the very  real  anger and pain that such a
response could very likely be generated from............. Is it possible
that indological investigation can provide clues to providing a context
that these tragedies can be understood within and subsequently avoided-
rather than quantatatively compared against another,  whether these
tragedies are perpetrated against, or by for that matter, Hindus,
Christians, or Moslems?
Respectfully,
Robert
