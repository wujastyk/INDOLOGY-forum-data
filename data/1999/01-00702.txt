Hindu new years day
And ONam for tirumAl (viSNu).
One of the pattuppAttu (such as maturaikkAJci) mentions
something like "the one born on ONam star".
tiruvAtirai star is associated with Sivan but I suppose
not as his birth star since he is called
"piRavA yakkaip periyOn2" or "the greate one who has
the body that was never given birth to"
[cilappatikAram chapter 5-intiravizavur eTuttakAtai?].
