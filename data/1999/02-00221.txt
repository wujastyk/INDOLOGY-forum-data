VijnAnavAda  &  Dvaita
Dear  Mr. Gantsen:
I  thought  I  might  share  this  with  you.
One  of  Madhva's  criticisms  against  the  VijnAnavAda  is:
"if  everything  is  jnAnamayam  (consciousness)  how  can  ignorance
be  possible  at  all?"  asks  Madhva.  (A  pretty  powerful  polemic  I
think)
1.  As  you  know,  most  Indian  systems  do  not  make  a  distinction
between  consciousness  and  knowledge.
2.  Also,  all  Indian  systems  regard  anAdi avidyA  (Primal
Ignorance)  as  the  root  cause  of  the  bondage  of  the  individual
in  samsAra.
Hope  this  is  useful  to  you.
Regards,
B.N.Hebbar
