Address of Prof Bodewitz
Hello again,
as I do not know, whether my yesterday's mail reached the list,
here it is again: Does anybody know how and where I can contact Prof.
Hendrik Bodewitz? I have an urgent question to ask him on behalf of
an Indian friend.
Please answer to my personal email-address:
gabriele.zeller at ub.uni-tuebingen.de
Thanks a lot,
Gabriele
