New Projects in KOLAM
Hello!
We have started our new projects in the on-line journal KOLAM
(http://www.uni-kowln.de/phil-fak/indologie/kolam/frame.html)
One project is on Kuruntokai: analysis and translation of the poems
along with the commentary.
The other aims at setting up a website concerning U. Ve. Caminataiyar.
We would appreciate contributions, comments, etc. etc.
For the editors,
Ulrike Niklas
