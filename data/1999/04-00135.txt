sacrificial posts
In the Kurma Purana there is a description of the destruction of Daksha's
Sacrifice by the ganas of Shiva.  "The leader of the ganas set fire to the
sacrificial enclosure while the furious gana lords tore up the sacrificial
posts and threw them away." What might the "posts" be in this sacrificial
scene? The translation is by Cornelia Dimmitt and J.A.B. van Buitenen
