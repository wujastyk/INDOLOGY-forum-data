book needed
Dear list members,
I am looking for the following editions and would be very grateful if
somebody informs me where I could get a copy of them.
title of the text: RAjapraSniya / RAyapaseNaijja 
One edition is from Calcutta 1880, the other is with Abhayadeva's TIkA and
a translation into Gujarati from Ahmedabad, 1937, ed. by Bechardas Doshi.
Many thanks in advance,
W. Boll?e
