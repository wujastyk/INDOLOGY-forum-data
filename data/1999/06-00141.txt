Subject: CSX+ fonts & cross-platform email exchange
Message-ID: <161227050099.23782.6655743976153736049.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Windows and Mac versions of the CSX+ fonts seem to have
identical encodings, in contrast to what is usual.

Data based on CSX+ fonts, when exchanged across platforms
through email, gets scrambled due to the usual automagical
MIME re-encoding.

Any workarounds for this problem?
