CSX+ fonts & cross-platform email exchange
Windows and Mac versions of the CSX+ fonts seem to have
identical encodings, in contrast to what is usual.
Data based on CSX+ fonts, when exchanged across platforms
through email, gets scrambled due to the usual automagical
MIME re-encoding.
Any workarounds for this problem?
