>?From Dravidian visumbAL to Sanskrit vai'sambAlyA is rather common:
Dr. miiN AL ("fisherman") becomes "mainAla" (Prof. Witzel's same
paper). Settlements of "vEL" people is called in the RV as
"vailasthAna". Sangam texts refer to "vEL"s whose leader, Krishna
of Dvaraka, moving southward.

F. Southworth gives a Dravidian etymology for Sindhu as *kIndu/sIndu.
The Indus valley civilization, before the Aryans moved into South
Asia (No horses before 1700 BC), could have been called more like
"sIndu-visumbAL" culture.
