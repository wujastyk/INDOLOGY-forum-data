parvata-dhvaja??
Dear Indologists,
Aware of different flag standards: garuDa-dhvaja held by ViSNu,
nandhi-dhvaja held by Ziva, makara-dhvaja held by Kaama/Pradyumna,
tAla-dhvaja held by SaMkarSaNa/BalarAma, ta. mayil koDi
(mayUra-dhvaja) with Murukan (Skanda), ...
In a similar manner, does parvatarAjan/himavAn hold
a parvata-dhvaja? May be in the DakSa sacrifice episode??
Thanks for any quotes,
V. Iyer
