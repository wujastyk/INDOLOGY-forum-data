Would like to know the details on
a book by Chowdhury so that I can place an order.
The book title is something like
"The Indian origin of the Chinese Nation".

Vishal responds:
I have read two books authored by him (but not the volume on China). The
sole merit of his work lies in the fact that it is the best anthology of
statements and facts which expose the racial and Judeo-Christian biases of
Caldwell, Weber, Cowell etc. Other than that, I would not spend my money and
time on his works. The 'Out of India' school too does not take cognizance of
his works and I have not found 1 quotation from P. Chaudhary's books in
their works.
Incidently, a recent work moves a step further in questioning the prejudices
of modern Indologists like Erdosy, Dr. Witzel et al (I can email a detailed
reference to you personally if you wish) and the authors claim to have
witnessed excavations in Central Asia, where they were dismayed to discover
the pre-conceived notions and the unscientific handling of data by the
archaeologists and Indologists. Otherwise, this book too resembles Pramesh
Chaudhary's works in its methodology.
