Jan Nattier of Indian University is working on a critical edition of the
Tibetan text of the Ugradatta, and an English translation taking into
account the Tibetan tradition and all Chinese versions.

A complete translation exists by Sakurabe Hajime in Daijo Butten vol. 9
(Tokyo: Chuo Koron). -- of course, in Japanese.

***The distress part:  it wastes time if those asking for information do
not add to their requests what they already know, and do not take the

specialized bibliographies. The kind of information that the members of
this list can best provide is that such as the above: work in progress, and
that published in languages that are considered "exotic" (or as classified
in a bookshop I was just in, "unusual") such as Japanese. But a PhD
dissertation? Such information is available on line from UMI, which pretty
much every scholar does or should know ...
