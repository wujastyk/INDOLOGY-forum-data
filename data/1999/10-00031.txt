The history of your subject goes as far back as the Atharva-veda,
for which you may consult works on the history of Sanskrit/Vedic
literature by Winternitz and others.
I know a collative work on the subject (curses and boons in the
Raamaayana) in Marathi by Prof. Bhiday, also translated into
Kannada. For copies of such books you may contact a bookseller
in Pune. (For example, International Book Service, Pune 411 004,
India.) There is no possibility of the existence of a work in Sanskrit
focussed on the academic aspect of the subject.
