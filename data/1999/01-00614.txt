        List members,
        Please forgive my rather intemperate response to this discussion
which was intended for two friends in Jewish Studies who are conducting a
literature survey about the use of the term "Semitic" in Asian Studies.
Let me explain in more professional language what I mean:
        The words "Indian" "Western" "Semitic" etcetc can be used as
either descriptive, provisional adjectives, or they can be used as
totalitarian adjectives. Even as we try to right the various imbalances of
power in the production of knowledge about India, describing some
perspectives as "Western" or "Indian" or "Semitic", these adjectives can
only describe some, but not all, of those culture's or scholars'
intellectual perspectives.  Once these adjectives become THE
determining factors of a culture's agenda, or a scholar's agenda, then we
risk losing academic freedom.  Our nationality or religion is only part
of what makes us the Indologists that we are, and should never be used
as determinative.  It is imperative that we pay attention to
our language when using nationality or religion to describe a particular
perspective.
        Thanks, and apologies, lp
