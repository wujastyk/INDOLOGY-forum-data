Munda kinship pattern
I should note that in the area of southern Nepal where the Buddha lived
cross cousin marriages are still the rule among many groups, some of
them whom though are fairly recent immigrants from the north. Among most
of the indigenous Himalayan speakers, cross cousin marriages are
routinely practiced.
It is also among these people that we still find the practice of
polyandry very similar to that found in the Mahabharata.
