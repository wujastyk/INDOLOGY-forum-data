Nehru and Persian/Arabic
While I like the discussion, the occasional agenda tone
bothers me.  The following is a good example.
What does Indology group have to do if Tamil is
not given its due recognition by some Indian
politicians?  Does Indology have to be driven
by a bias and an agenda?  Hope not.
