Size of Hindu scriptures
Can anybody tell me how big (in size) the Hindu scriptures are?
By scriptures I mean things like vedas, upanishads etc.  The size
can be comparative (like X% of britannia encyclopedia or some
other book) or absolute (X number of pages or Y megabytes etc).
If you find the above definition of scriptures lacking in rigor,
please by all means supplement the above definition (and provide
an answer!)
Wishing you all the best for 1999.
