Mimamsa, Vedanta etc.
Pl. take a look at fig. 17 in C. Sivaramamurti,
Bhagavatpada Sri Sankaracharya, Delhi, 1972.
The fig. 17 sculpture: Is he a Buddha or Adi Sankara?
Kanchi temples are usually of sandstone they wear away over centuries;
Kailasanatha temple, for example, has been fully plastered over
with cement.
Is the Kanchi temple in Sivaramamurti's book also plastered?
