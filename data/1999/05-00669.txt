Epic MaNimEkalai
Thanks, Dr. Chevillard. To my knowledge, UVS' editions of
Manimekalai do NOT mention the 1891 edition, the first edition
in print, by Tirumayilai Canmukam Pillai. That's probably
the reason why European and American works of Manimekalai
say UVS is the person who edited M. for the first time.
UVS' edition came seven years later.
