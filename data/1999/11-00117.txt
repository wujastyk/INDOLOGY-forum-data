Tamil Studies
Hello Stephen,

I mentioned the loan phonology not from the point of etymologizing. In the
absence of any easily available Sanskrit-Tamil Dictionary,  I was pointing
out a work-around to help you use the Tamil lexicon as a Sanskrit-Tamil
dictionary, albeit in a limited way. For instance, if you wanted a Tamil
equivalent of stotra, you can look at the Tamil entry tOttiram, and you will
find the entry marked as < stotra and the Tamil synonym pukazcci. If the
Sanskrit words you are interested deal with religion, chances are you will
find the Tamil equivalents of many of them this way.
