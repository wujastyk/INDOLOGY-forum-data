Q: intervocalic -k- preserved as intervocalic -g-
Dear N Ganesan,
Basically I resist from having a personal opinion. My theories are
based on the literature that I've read, existing social
conditions in India and my perceptions of the psychology and world
view of brahmins and non-brahmins. If somebody can prove me wrong,
I'm more than willing to accept it.
