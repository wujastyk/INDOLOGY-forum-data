muraja drum
  Thanks, Prof. Gupt. I read that the Natya Sastra in its available
form is around 4-5th centuries A.D. "muraja", *the most
important drum instrument of the ancient times*, and
classical Tamil "muracam/muracu/muraicu" - do people like
Burrow, Kuiper or Mayrhoffer say anything on muraja?
