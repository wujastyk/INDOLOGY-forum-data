varna and jati
Dear friends,
Please don't think that Keralites are not proud of the Dravidian
heritage.The only difference is that they are not fanatic about it.
Com.E.M.S. Nambudiripad has written a  book in Malayalam- Vedangalute Nad -
in which he has drawn attention to the multiple nature of our hertage.He
has considered the ancient Tamil literature on a par with the Vedic
literature.He has contributed a foreword to my
book-Advaitavedanta,Dialectics and Indian Philosophy- in which he disagrees
with my contention that there is dialectics in Advaitavedanta.He was
against setting up a sanskrit University in the state.
ChattambiSwamikal who was one of the founders of Kerala renaissance  has
written a book -Adibhasha-in which he has tried to establish that
Muladravidam was the Adibhasha from which all other languages
originated.The manuscript of the book was recently found out by me and I
have published it.efforts are going on to translate the book into Tamil.
One cannot also ignore the rich wealth of knowledge enshrined in Sanskrit.
Let us have a universal approach in these days of universal means of
communication, rather than narrow boastings in the name
language,creed,colour,country etc.
Thanks
