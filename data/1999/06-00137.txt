Kuwi. kaja = big and Skt. gaja = elephant
V. Keerthi Kumar  in his paper (at
http://www.datanumeric.com/dravidian/index.html)
on the relationship between Dravidian and IE cites the words
from DEDR
gaja = big (1093-Pe) : kaja = big (1093- Kuwi).
Is there any relationship with Skt. gaja for elephant
given the lexical and semantic proximity here?
