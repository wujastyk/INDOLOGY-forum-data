Book about navagraha (nine planets)
Dear Magali,
Saraswathy is a practising astrologer. The book deals chiefly with the
worship of the Navagrahas, from a believer's rather than a scholarly
perspective (not suggesting that the two are irreconcilable), justifying and
elaborating on its practice. A fairly substantial appendix contains the
liturgy (mantra, kavaca, stotra, naamaavali) of each Graha. If this is what
you're interested in, I could send you a photocopy.
Regards,
Martin Gansten
