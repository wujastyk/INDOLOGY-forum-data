Living & Dead Systems

With all due respect, Prof. Hebbar, I think this reflects only the situation
in southern Karnataka, where there are only Jains and Vedantins among
classical thinkers. Your quotation of Prof. Hiriyanna adds to this
impression of mine. Let's not forget Buddhism. Apart from traditional
pockets here and there in various parts of India, we have many neo-Buddhists
who are very interested in philosophical issues, and not just in political
matters. And since the times of Hiriyanna, the Tibetans have come, as far
down south as Mysore now. Perhaps they are still alien, but I see no real
prospect of their returning to their homeland in the foreseeable future. As
social interactions between Indians and Tibetans increase, philosophical
discourse and religious debate will follow, and mahAyAna buddhism will have
to be contended with as a religion and as a philosophy. And Buddhism will
only have returned to its old homeland.

Is it necessary for every classical darSana to be a religious alternative to
the vedAnta(s)? Isn't it enough for a school like nyAya to concentrate on
logic? And you have not even taken into account the Saiva siddhAnta and
related schools. Even among classical nyAya-vaiSeshika authors, many of them
were Saiva/pASupata by "religion" and naiyyAyika by "philosophy." kauNDinya
and vyomaSiva come to mind. And as far as pUrva mImAMsA is concerned, even
kumArila bhaTTa didn't think it was an alternative to vedAnta, as he ended
his tantra-vArttika with a statement that the subject of the Atman is
discussed only in the vedAnta darSana and not in jaiminI's SAstra. And among
the vedAntins, Sankara kept the two separate, while others argued the two
systems formed one larger whole, in one way or the other. In either case,
mImAMsA continued, either separately, or otherwise. As late as appayya
dIkshita, a full eight centuries after Sankara, and two or three after
Madhva, there was a flourishing traditional scholarship in pUrva mImAMsA.
Clearly, if we are to give a reason why mImAMsA has died or has become
irrelevant today, there are other factors involved, and we cannot point
simply to the rise of vedAnta(s).
Not so long ago, Swami Saccidanandendra Sarasvati of Holenarsipur wrote that
Sankaran advaita vedAnta had been hijacked largely by naiyyAyikas and
yogins. Not that he was necessarily right, but many of those one assumes to
be Advaitins are really Yogins.
Earlier this century, Swami Hariharananda Aranya (note the Advaitin sounding
Sannyasi suffix) translated the Yogabhashya into Bengali with annotations.
This has since been translated into English and Hindi. There is hardly any
influence of Advaitic metaphysics in his work, which is clearly aligned with
the multiple purusha tradition aligned with sAMkhya. The Bihar School of
Yoga in Monghyr continues to have some pundits of pAtanjala yoga, without
Advaita influence. We can leave B. K. S. Iyengar safely out of this
discussion, as he is to Yoga what Swamis Sivananda or Chinmayananda are to
Advaita Vedanta.

Fine, but I don't see why this makes the 5-fold syllogism any less
interesting a field of study. There are still traditional pundits who study
the 5-fold syllogism and ponder over the finer points of samavAya and
vyApti, not to mention the numerous comparative philosophers who are
interested in these concepts. Just last year, I heard of two young
vidyArthIs who were examined and given certificates for proficiency in nyAya
studies at Sringeri. I'm sure various other maThas and pAThaSalas also
patronize some nyAya specialists.
Really professor, a thing has to be alive in some form or the other,
although old and decrepit, if we are to modernize it. A dead thing cannot be
modernized in any sense of the term. It only be decently disposed of, before
or after a post-mortem. It is either dead or it is not. nAsato vidyate
bhAvaH, nAbhAvo vidyate sataH, no?
I do not see why modernizing of Jaina metaphysics should be of interest to
anyone but a Jaina. Hopefully, somebody of sufficient authority among Jainas
will do it, or perhaps not. Why should this be a precondition for the
modernizing of other darSanas? What form should modernization take? A
constructive engagement with science, as is being done in Western
philosophy? But the example you give below of the Madhva layman scientist
seems to imply that the metaphysics (or physics perhaps?) of the Dvaita
Vedantins needs to be modernized too.
We Advaitins have an advantage; we can see the latest scientific theory as
yet another facet of mAyA, and either ignore it or co-opt it. :-))) And
speaking from the scientist's perspective, it is a very interesting exercise
to apply Sankara's and Anandagiri's criticisms of vaiSeshika theories to the
scientific atomic theory.
To me, this means that what is living is going to die, especially if it is
not interested in philosophical problems of immediate interest, or if it is
so weighed down by tradition that it has a closed mind. And what one thinks
to be dead will be reborn, if not tomorrow, some other day. After all, in
India, nothing ever dies completely. But the faith of the layman in the guru
among whose followers he happens to have been born hardly ensures the
vitality of a darSana. And it is a moot point if the formulators of nyAya
and vaiSeshika darSanas ever had the kind of following which the
contemporary maThAdhipatis of the vedAnta schools have.
My arguments are not based on an assumption that all is fine and healthy
with the state of the classical darSanas. Rather, I'm saying let's not sign
the death certificate while the patient is still breathing, even if only
barely.

Vidyasankar
