I am curious to know how the ASI "acquired" the site in 1995; it must
have been very expensive since it is almost completely covered by the
modern village.   (which  I have mentioned for other Indus cities earlier,
tehy often are coverd by modern settlements  -- and which some members  did
not believe; what about Harappa itself?)
Journalistic licence about acquiring "the site" ? Remember the BBC etc.
"quotes" of R. Meadow on early Harappan writing?
I am afraid that in Harappan times (during the Indus civilization)
the Sarasvati was called something like
*Vipaazh or *Vi<sham>baaL.
If we *really* want to rename the Harappan (Indus civilization), we should
not call it, anachronistically,  the Indus-Sarasvatii, ....
but the Sende-VibaaL Civilization.
let's wait and see the *published* Excavation Report, not newpaper stories
(see above) !
Via KASHMIR? who wants to climb the Pir Pantsaal pass each time when moving
from Bactria to the Indus, ... when there are the easier and more more
directly situated  Khyber  (and Bolan, etc.)  passes?
Just curious....
