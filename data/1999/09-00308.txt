If Tamil has its roots in Sanskrit, then all Tamil(T) words should have some 
resemblance to the Sanskrit(S) words from which they are supposed to have

Phalam(S)----Aani (T)=Jyesta(S)-(a month?s name)----Murugu(T) 
=Sundaram(S)----Aal(T)=Vata Vrksham(S)---- Arisi(T)=Thandulam----(Arisi has 
atleast  some commonality with Rice)----Nel(T)=Vree(S)----Paasi payaru(T) = 
Mudga(S)-----Moonru(T) =Treeni(S)---Treeni has commonality with English 
Three----Aezhu(T) =Sapta(S)--- has commonality with Septa--- These are all 
very common-day to day words?If they have any commonalities- even remotely-
