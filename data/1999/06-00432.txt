Andreas Prilop provided me with an elegant solution that works
quite well with the Eudora mail client on a Mac.
<Andreas Prilop>
Get Eudora Standard Tables
  info-mac/comm/inet/mail/edr/eudora-standard-tables.hqx
from any Info-Mac mirror.
For outgoing mail, deselect any transcoding ("transliteration").
For incoming mail, select "Repair ISO-Latin-1".
For background information, see also

This is the table that does the trick:
# "Repair ISO-Latin-1"
Repair (i.e. restore) an incoming message that has been converted
automatically but incorrectly from ISO-Latin-1 to MacRoman.
