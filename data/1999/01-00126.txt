SV: SV: Sanskrit translations in Nazi hands
Some people can belong in a political party to save
their skins.  Many Chinese, Russian and East European
scholars in recent times have fallen into this.
Without citing names, one can also see that many
good scientists could be racists.
However, Nazi connection is very different.
One has to analyze the bias very carefully.
I am attracted to read this stuff and appreciate.
God(!) willing I will find time to do..
