Axial Age
Didn't Samuel Eisenstadt edit a series of Volumes? The German series
title goes like: Kulturen der Achsenzeit. I guess English translations
of the same exist (or is it the other way round!). Esp. Vol. 2, 4 and 5
(from 1987, 1992, 1992 respectively, Suhrkamp Verlag) 'd be of interest
to you. These volumes contains contributions from David Shulman (2),
A.K.Ramanujan (translation of his excellant essay: Wjen mirrors are the
windows - an anthology of reflexions), Hermann Kulke et al.
