Hello, Daniel !
My main area of expertise is Buddhism so I cannot speak with any
authority -- somebody else more knowledgeable may reply.   However,
here is my take on your question.   There seems to be a scholarly
consensus that Shiva is a later "incarnation" of Rudra who is
mentioned in the Vedas.  There was possibly some syncreticism at work
as it is also thought that Shiva per se was a local "tribal"
pre/non-Vedic local deity.  There is also a famous Indus Valley seal
depicting a Shiva-like pashupati figure sitting in what is thought is
a yogic meditational pose.  The classic book covering Shiva is, of
course, Stella Kramrisch's The Presence of Shiva.   She also goes into
detail about the relationship between Rudra and Indra.
If you look at Buddhist texts, I think those that belong to the
earliest strata preserved in Pali do not mention Shiva by name but
there is increasing mention of him by the time one comes to Mahyana
texts.   The situation in Buddhist tantras is interesting as Shaivite
sects were probably contemporary rivals.  There is the famous chapter
in the Sarva-tathagata-tattva-samgraha-tantra where Vajrapani (who has
many of the attributes of Indra) overcomes Maheshvara (= Shiva).
Hope this is of some help.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
