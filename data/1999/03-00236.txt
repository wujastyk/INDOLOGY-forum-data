Thanks for the insight. One may also refer to DEDR 3668:
nin.a (-pp-, -nt-/-tt-) to braid (Ta.); nin. twisted string (To.); nin.e,
nen., nine a wick (Tu.)

ve_y (-v-, -nt-) to thatch (Ta.); ve_yn to thatch (Gadba); ve_n! (Parji)

Hence, ve_n.i (Skt.)? bani = a current of water caused by heavy rain (Malt.)?
