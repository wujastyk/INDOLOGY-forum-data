Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
I cannot say definitely whether there are or there are not because
I am not a professional. But I have not come across any in the contemporary
period. This is the period in which viSNukuNDins were ruling the
region under question. There are a number of zAsanAs by viSNUkuNDins.
An inscription is a formal document and it will be unthinkable to
refer to the abode ones favourite deity with out the honorific "zrI".
Therefore they used "zrIparvata" in their zAsanAs. For example
dIptyA diGmaNDalaM vyAptaM yasya bAlArkatEjasaH|
satyAzrayasuta zzrIman sa jayatyuttamAzrayaH ||
svasti bhagavacchrIparvatasvAmi pAdAnudhyAtAvApta prajAparipAlanAdhikArANAM

In the above zrIparvatasvAmi can be buddha, skanda or ziva of nAgArjunakoMDa
or mallikhArjuna of zrizaila.
