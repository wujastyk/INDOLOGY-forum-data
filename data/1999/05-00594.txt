Buddhist revival movement in India
Sri. Hebbar expressed a desire that Buddhism be revived
in India again, some time ago.
This has already been done. In late 19th century by
Tamils in Madras. They were connected with the white
Buddhist H. S. Olcott. In fact, they got the then
Govt. of Madras presidency to classify themselves as
belonging to a separate religion. Books, PhD thesis are available
about this early attempt to revive Buddhism. It is
interesting that B. R. Ambedkar got the clue from them,
corresponded with them, before he made Buddhism grow again
in India.
