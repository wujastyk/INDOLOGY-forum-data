maNipravALa transliteration [was SV: creation of human kind]
A question on transliteration standards:
Dr. Ganesan writes:
This poses a problem when transliterating maNipravALa
texts, such as the commentaries of the Sri Vaishnava
acharyas, which contain Tamil and Sanskrit in varying
equal quantities, depending on the author.
Some problem areas are vocalic r, vocalic l, and the
sibilants.
Is there a suggested transliteration scheme?
