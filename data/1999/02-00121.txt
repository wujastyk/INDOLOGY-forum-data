Mount Potalaka as though it is in an island. This is despite
the fact that the two earliest Chinese translations of the
GaNDavyUha sUtra never mention Mount Potalaka in an island!
(cf. A. C. Soper, Literary evidence for early Buddhist art
in China). Also, from the preceding kalyanamitra location,
Sudhana travels by horse carriage to Mt. Potalaka in
Borobudur basreliefs. This is surprising because no boats
are depicted to Mt. Potalaka in Borobudur! Note that
Borobudur sculptors are skillful in depicting sea vessels
elsewhere.
So, my question is:
Does the Chinese commentators consider the chapter
where Malaya Mountain and Mt. Potalaka occur as a later
day "forgery" because at the time of commentators there
is a well established Chinese tradition to take
Mt. Potalaka in an island? Even though their earlier
tradition puts it in South India.
