Well, as you say most people tend to believe in the Adi-Fred Flintstone
Out of Africa theory.  I guess the question then comes where did the
Dravidian language or the Dravidian physical type develop.
Unless you accept McAlpin's theory there are no Dravidian languages
remotely near the Mediterranean.  Even Elamite would represent something
on the fringe of Dravidian distribution and would violate the principles
of least moves and greatest diversity (if you're looking at Elam as the
place of origin).
If you just look at existing Dravidian languages and Dravidian
substrata, then we would have to estimate the place of origin somewhere
in South Asia.
