WZKS
I do not know what WZKS stands for. Is that a journal or conference
proceedings? I am interested in the traditional interpretations of the
episodes such as those in the lives of of Ramanuja and Umapati zivAacharya
where they eat/attempt to eat the leftovers of non-brahmin teachers.
If the article addresses the relationship between a teacher and his disciple,
I would like information about how to get that. Thanks in advance.
