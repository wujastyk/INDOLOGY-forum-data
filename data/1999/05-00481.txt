Punjab and Aryavarta
When the Vedic Aryans moved further East into modern U.P., Aryavarta
gets defined. Which Sanskrit texts downgrade the present Punjab area
(Pakistan, India) as the land of Mlecchas and Non-Aryans? Is it in Manu?
What about Puranas? Did this occur after Hunas, Shakas etc., invaded
the Punjab and West India?
Thanks for clues,
