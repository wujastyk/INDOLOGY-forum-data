Where is the witchhunt? Jung was a nazi - and an antisemite in his
private life. Whatever one chooses to make of that, it is merely a
fact.


>At 17:10 11.01.99 -0500, Dan Lusthaus wrote with malicious glee:


Are you so sure? Why would the fact that people today reverance an
antisemite, while insisting on either ignoring or devaluing that aspect
of Jung (and I don't think they would think of themselves as either
promoting or condoning antisemitism per se), why would that give me
glee - malicious or any other kind?

Fine. Obviously Jung would have needed that explained to him, since in
his writings of that period he wrote (with passion) about racial purity
and purifying the archetypes as tandem momentous potentials close at
hand.

It's easy to dismiss things while one remains willfully uninformed.
What was incomplete about the reference? I gave the author, title, and
publisher - and even a hint at the price. Here are more details: Under
pressure to make something about these lectures available, Bollingen -
which publishes all the Jung material -  came out with this recently:


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param><bigger>Jung's Seminar on Nietzsche's
Zarathustra (Bollingen Series, 99)  by C. G. Jung, James L. Jarrett

</bigger></fontfamily>The original unabridged version, that was $100
when first released just under a devade ago? It has become two
volumes:


Nietzsche's Zarathustra : Notes of the Seminar Given in 1934-1939

You can practically buy the rest of the Bollingen collection of Jung's
writings for the price of this book alone. Draw your own conclusions as
to motive. As I mentioned, at least to Bollingen's credit, the intro to
this work stares reality in the face.

Hendrik

>Marsman: he completed a translation of Nietzsche's _Zarathustra_
(that

>already must make him suspect, I suppose)


Let's be clear about the problem here. The problem is not Nietzsche,
who was never a nazi nor an antisemite -- he broke relations with his
sister when she married a prominent German antisemite. He warned
Germany about the direction it was heading in in very disapproving
terms. The problem is how Nietzsche's works were appropriated, or
misappropriated, to further aims that were the opposite of his own.
Jung was a major player in that misappropriation (as was Heidegger;
though the game began with Nietzsche's sister decades earlier -- but
this is not a Nietzsche list...).


I don't see any parallel between Marsman and Jung. Jung never joined
the resistance, and, like Heidegger and some others, benefitted from a
revisionist reconstitution of his reputation after the War.

>Nazi, yet his history of Indian philosophy, unfortunately never
completed,

>still stands unparalleled.


Jung was not a dry abhidharmic scholar familiar only to specialists in
his own field. Frauwallner was never a cottage industry for spiritual
salvation and self understanding. One you read for historical
scholarship and provocative theories. The other for insight into one's
own self and the structure of the universe. These are not the same
profession, and, since one does not entrust oneself to them in the same
way, they do not require the same credentials. I, for one, never found
the two Vasubandhu theory compelling in the least.
