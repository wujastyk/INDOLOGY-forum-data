Concept of Mukti and Shankaracharya
Here the reference seems to be to sarvAsthivAdins (vaibhASikAs),
vijnAnavAdins and zUnyavAdins. This is hardly an attack 
by Sankara on Buddha as a person but an attack on the later 
schools of Buddhism. Insteaad of refuting them individually
Sankara takes the easy way out. He heckles them for their lack 
of unanimity about what is the teaching of Buddha.

sarma.
