Repeating your statement: CDAC's products use a context sensitive
rendering engine, which means that the number of glyphs available in the
font can be much higher than the number of encoded characters.

I venture to disagree where you say "like Unicode". The Unicode standard
only deals with character codes, and takes no care of the rendering.

Context sensitive rendering will also be available through UniScribe
(the Windows Unicode Script Processor) in Windows NT 5.0, and through
Apple's ATSUI (Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging) in MacOS 8.5
as soon as applications taking adventage of ATSUI will arrive.

A few questions remain:

What is the meaning of the acronym ACII?

Since ISCII is an 8-bit standard, may I conclude that the 7-bit
Devanagari part of ACII is a -limited- version (subset) of ISCII?


Your information was appreciated,
Thanks,
