Srisailam stalavRkSam
Want to know the sacred tree of Srisailam MallikArjuna temple.
Is it by any chance the "white arjuna" tree?
The Tamil Lexicon gives veNmarutu = 'flowering murdah'
as the "white arjuna" tree.
Is this tree attested in Telugu folk songs, stala puraaNam
(Telugu or Sanskrit) or in inscriptions about Srisailam?
Many thanks,
N. Ganesan
