G. Hart on Potalaka
Venerable Indologists,
Before my critique on "Who inspired Panini?, JAOS, 1997"
was posted to Indology under the title,
"Where was Panini inspired?" (4 long posts), I checked
with Prof. George Hart, Dept. of Asian studies, Univ.
of California, Berkeley. In an e-mail dated 7-July-1998,
I submit a private e-mail to me from Dr. Hart:
"Dear Ganesan,
 I have long argued that Avalokitesvara's Potalaka is
 Potiyil of the sangam texts. Best, George".
George Hart can be reached at ghart at socrates.berkeley.edu
With kind regards,
N. Ganesan
