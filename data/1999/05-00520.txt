Pronunciation of word final "a" in sanskrit
Its somewhat difficult to make sweeping statements like the one below...
my parents are from Karnataka, my name is "chandan", my father's name
"nArAyaN", my uncle's name "ranganAth", etc. We are very much "from the
South".
I think your question has to do with the tendency to shorten  schwa
(saMvRta a) to zero word finally, thats all. See pANini on saMvRta and
vivRta. This schwa deletion is typologically common.
