The person to contact is

Mr P Perumal,
Chief Conservator,
Thanjavur Maharaja Serfoji's Saraswati Mahal Library,
Thanjavur 613 009,
Tamil Nadu,
India.

The Thanjavur Collector, Mr T. Shanmuga Rajeswaran, is also Director of
the TMSSML, but I think Mr Perumal is a better first contact.  Mr Perumal
has studied conservation in Japan and the UK, including visiting periods
at the V & A and the Wellcome Library.  He is well-acquainted with the
international scene, and generally a Good Thing :-)  Perumal's phone no.
is
+91 4362 51036 (res),
+91 4362 34107 (office).

Also at the TMSSML is Smt. Rajalakshmi, a Sanskrit Pandit, who is very
nice and a good source of information on the Sanskrit collections.  Also
Mr Padmanabhan, Records Clerk, is kind and helpful.

When I was there in April, email was just being talked about as Real Soon
Now.  They had a bunch of computers, but no connectivity.  I'm afraid I
have lost the fax number (if you get it, could you let me have it?).

Best,
Dominik
