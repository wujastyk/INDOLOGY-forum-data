Aghehananda Bharathi
Swami Agehananda Bharati was an Austrian by birth. To the best of my
recollection, he was born and grew up in Vienna. He was certainly not
British by birth, and I do not recall that he ever either lived in Britain,
or became a British citizen. For many years, until his death, he taught in
the Anthropology Department at Syracuse University.
