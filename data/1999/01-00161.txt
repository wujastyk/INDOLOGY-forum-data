Swami Agehananda Bharati was an Austrian by birth. To the best of my
recollection, he was born and grew up in Vienna. He was certainly not
British by birth, and I do not recall that he ever either lived in Britain,
or became a British citizen. For many years, until his death, he taught in
the Anthropology Department at Syracuse University.
