Continuing the review of Passions of the Tongue
   I am indeed surprised. Why was Prof. George Hart who is right
  there at Berkeley not included in Ramaswamy's PhD committee?
  Possibly, because Hart will raise important questions.
  Agreeing with Prof. Thorp following the opening statement of
  your review of Ramaswamy's book:
  "Your example is a good one of "Post Colonialism" - the current
faddish and hot position to take in academia if one wants to be
considered as and admired as a radical thinker. Solid historical
work, sadly, is considered old-fashioned and dull".
