Gentoo studies (details on SR)
      Having gone thru' the Indology archives, I do not see
      Paul write much about Sanskrit and precious little
      on our Rigveda itself! Is he a faculty of Sanskrit
      or any other Indian language/s?
      Sincerely,
      Prasad

Well, I hope that the list will now see that Paul Kekai Manansala's
memory is rather poor, and I encourage everyone to excuse him.
As for Paul himself, I encourage him to re-read not only his own book,
but the Rgveda as well.
