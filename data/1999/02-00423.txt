Book about navagraha (nine planets)
 Dear Indologists,
 I have the reference of a book I can't find in Paris:
 SARASWATHY, K.N, and ARDHANAREESWARAN, B., "Navagraha
or Nine Planets", Kadalangudi Centenary Astrological
Book Series, N.1 . Madras: Kadalangudi House, 1978.
 Does any of you know this work? Could someone obtain a
hard copy of it for me, or at least tell me about its
content ?
Thanks in advance,
                            Magali Vacherot.
