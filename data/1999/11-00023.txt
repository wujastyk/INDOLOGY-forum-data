Dear Nanda Chandran,
Original topic of this thread was on the origin of the name 'Agastya'. I proposed that it may be equivalent to the
ancient generic name like Athan in Tamil, Augustus/Augustine in western languages, Adam in early Hebrew etc.
Unfortunately, there was no response on that point yet.
Now the discussion is getting diverted into Aryan invasion and varNasrama dharmA etc. Why should we move on to
HindutvAti arguements? If we divert all our arguements to the same old problem which has defied answers so far, we
may not find any. By avoiding that and looking for kaizan type small advancements, we may succeed one day.
Let us drop our coloured glasses. I do not have to emphasize: if we want to see the history through a coloured glass, it
will look coloured.
With regards,
