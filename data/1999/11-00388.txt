Diacritics font

If you are using MS Word 97 to type your documents then you could try John
Richards' Word 97 templates for writing both devanaagarii and diacritics.
The templates come with the Roman Sanskrit Serif TTF and CSX Devanaagari
font. I have not tested the devanaagari but for transliteration this is by
far the easiest and the most compatible solution.
You do not need any complicated key strokes for encoding, just the <Ctrl>
key.
The templates and the fonts are available for free download from the
