Sanskrit lessons in Delhi
An Indian student resident in the US is planning to leave in 3-4 weeks
to visit his family in Delhi for 1 to 3 months.  He had Sanskrit up to
his BA as one of his four subjects.  He wants to use the stay in Delhi
for intensive study to improve it.  He has his paradigms down well and
thinks a study of Paninian grammar (which he has not had much of)
might be the best way.  Can someone suggest someone in Delhi for
intensive individual tutoring for the summer, or suggest to whom or
where to go to find a tutor?
