Dear N. Bose,
Thank you for your comments.
Unfortunately, I have been strongly reprimanded ( in a private mail) by a
list member because a.I am not an Indologist, and the list is only for
Indologists (in this he was right), and b. I have written about a general
interest subject ( although the subject was certainly not started by me, nor
ended after me). Therefore I cannot reply to you, at least not here,
although I would love to. Maybe privately, if you wish.

Best regards,
Irene
