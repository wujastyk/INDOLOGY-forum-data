The elephant naLagiri/nalagiri
        Some clarification on nara -> nArAyaNa may be useful.  While such
a derivation of the word nArAyaNa from nara- may be theoretically
possible, cf. dak.sa -> daak.saaya.na, the tradition does not derive
naaraaya.na from nara-.  It derives the word naaraaya.na from the word
naaraa (f. 'water', cf. aapo naaraa iti proktaa.h) by adding ayana.
        While the derivation of nALAyaNI from naLa, on the face of it, may
be similar to the derivation of daak.saaya.nii from dak.sa, the derivation
of naa.laa in naa.laagiri from na.la does not seem so straight forward.
        Also the meaning 'black' for nala- is not known in its Sanskrit
usage.  Sorry for using different notations for diacritics.
