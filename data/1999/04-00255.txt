Trilingual inscription from Sri Lanka
S.Madhuresan asks:
special rights?
In addition to anAgarika dharmapAla who has alreadty been named, I
believe, wouldn't S.W.R.D Banadaranayaka also fit the bill? Afterall
the concept of sinhala supremacy into politics, AFAIK, was his doing.
I also remember being told that the american George[sic?] Olcott
also had some such scheme though the majority of the biographical
reference talk about his being a reformer more than a closeted racist.
Regards,
Krishna
