Munda has retroflexion in its infix system which we know did not
come from "Aryan" or modern Dravidian. Of course, it come have come
from another extinct language, but this is doubtful since infixation is
found throughout Austro-Asiatic and even Austric.
Generally speaking, I would agree with SK Chatterji that people
tend to borrow words or languages but retain their own sound systems.
This was the reason the latter gave for retroflexion in "Aryan"
languages (Munda Dravidian people speaking foreign language).
If retroflexion was not native to Munda, then we either have to accept
that modern Munda speakers were originally non-Munda speakers who
borrowed  Munda languages, or that all Munda languages, but one,
borrowed extensive retroflex sounds into their own language. These
sounds would even have been incorporated into native infixes and
vocabulary.
Well,  my point is the North-South division of retroflexion.
If we subscribe to the theory that Dravidian was "pushed" southward
by invading Indo-Aryans, when did they lose (or did northerners gain?)
initial retroflexion?
