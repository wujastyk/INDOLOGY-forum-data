Parasol in India
Sergei,
If you study the pre-anthromorphic representations of the Buddha in Indian
art, you will occasionally find a parasol representing the presence of the
Prince Siddhartha.  One of the best examples of this is found on a panel of
at least one of the toranas at Sanchi, the eastern torana, with its scene of
the visits the young prince makes outside Suddhodhana's palace in a chariot.
In this panel a court servant is holding a parasol over an "invisible"
being, i.e., the prince who will eventually become the Buddha.  This is
found in other art as well.
