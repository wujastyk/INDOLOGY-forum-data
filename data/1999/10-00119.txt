I am pleased to be able to report  that, thanks to the efforts of our
assistant editor, M. Fushimi, the paper referred to by Dr. Kalyanaraman:

>Prof. Witzel's recent article in EJVS on the overlay of languages

is, as of today,  available on our website

http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/issues.html

in various formats:

        in PDF (596kb)
        in DVI (395kb)
        in PS  (1131kb)

i.e.,  readable & printable with proper diacritics.


As for Dr. Kalyanaraman's

That depends on the text you have in mind. As for the Rgveda, the best we
can give is an appriximate age;  I quote from the paper mentioned:

" It may suffice to point out (Witzel 1987, 1989, 1995, 1999) that the
Rgveda (RV) is a bronze age (pre-iron age) text of the Greater Panjab that
follows the dissolution of the Indus civilization (at c. 1900 BCE) -- which
limits its time frame to (maximally) c. 1900 -1200 BCE; the latter date is
that of the earliest
appearance of iron in the subcontinent"

That period probably is a little too long, but there is no way, as of now,
to set  the upper  limit in a more precise way. The first archaeologically
attested horses & chariots in S. Asia would give a date ad quem. (First
horses in S. Asia in the Kachi plain, on the Sindh/Balcuchi border, at 1700
BCE.)

>The only firm dates available by other scientific techniques are: dating of
>the Sarasvati River waters from the deep wells in Jaisalmer (by Atomic
>scientists of BARC using tritium isotope analysis) to be between 4000 and
>14000 years BP

This is too early for a copper/bronze age text, with HORSES  (c. 1700 BCE,
Kachi Plains) and chariots (oldest c. 2000 BCE, Urals), such as the
Rgveda....

Well, the substrate languages in the area, from the time period of the
Rgveda all are non-Vedic and pre- Old Indo-Aryan, i.e. from a period that
is a long time before any Prakrit (middle Indo-Aryan )is attested...
