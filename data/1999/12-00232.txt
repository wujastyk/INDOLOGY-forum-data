[q] iissara & iisvara
Have a question:
In the sanskritization of iiza/iiSa/iissara to iizara, how is the
"v" in iizvara added? Is this common and any parallel examples
could be given? (I could think of ta. vi.la > bilva, but problen here
is -v- in bilva comes after an l. bilva is from vi.lam acc. to
Zvelebil, Intro. to dr. linguistics, 1990).
Are there instances where initial i/I/e gets dropped in IA? Eg.,
Could yakkha/yakSa be from words like iyakkha/isakkha/esakka, ...?
Thanks for any examples, thoughts,
N. Ganesan
