Epigraphic curses
Not only the Nayak period inscriptions, but the imperial
Chola and Pandya ones as well to get a full idea.
Also, the curses by 'Saivaite Nayanmars on Jains and Buddhists,
usually in 9th quatrain of every decad. Vaguely remember these
curses figure in maNimEkalai, the buddhist epic too.
