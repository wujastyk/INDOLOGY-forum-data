*Not even of Arya meter used with Sanskrit?
  Yes, you are correct in this regard.
P. Manansala writes:
*Do you come to this conclusion based on the two quotes thus far
*presented?
  This point was explained few times here: Not only on the

  where Aryan2 means IA speakers and it is exclusively so
  in Sangam texts.
