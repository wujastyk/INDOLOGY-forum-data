As a result, Max's Biblical AIT involving only one Aryan Invasion has now
been discarded. Instead, the hypermodern AIT involves at least 13 Aryan
Invasions. So little Max should read another Bible :

`The Bible of Aryan Invasions' by Prof. Uthaya Naidu at
  http://dalitstan.org/journal/brahman/bibai/bibai.html  (full book)

There little Max & Co. will learn about the Guptan, Asokan and Mauryan
Aryan Invasions and be astonished at how far science has gone since Adolf.

 Good God ! What a crime - maybe he should be imprisoned along with
Mahatma Khan. Before that, the Puranic OIT followers should read the
Bible of AI and then try to refute hypermodern history rather than
"slash punctured tyres".
