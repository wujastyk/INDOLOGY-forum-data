Yet another areal feature in SA languages?
Since this now has nothing to do with Indology, I'll make this the last:
yes, this is correct.
Neither I nor Birgit (nor Michael Witzel, I may add) are native speakers of
Japanese. But according to my wife, who is a native speaker, there
certainly *is* a negative connotation in this expression; my wife says it
may also mean, in addition to "oops... I really should not have drank
this", "unwillingly or without intending to, I drank the sake." Therefore
the English (a) is not correct. Perhaps "undesirability" is the wrong
word... The point to be stressed is that the outcome is not desirable (or
the speaker wishes to convey the impression that he thinks/should think it
undesirable; I drank all the sake, so there's none left for you! (there's
only beer left) = boku wa osake o nonde shimatta; biiru shika nokote inai.
Whether that's really undesirable depends on the friendship with the
guest...
Perhaps this is so in general, but at least with this particular
construction, aspect seems fine.  We need the comments of a Japanese
linguist, I think...  But privately I think.
