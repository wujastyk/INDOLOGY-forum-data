Aiyanar - Any Buddhist connections?
Does the village folk deity with huge clay horses
have any Buddhist connections? Aiyappan is a form of
Aiyanar. Does Sabarimala deity has anything Buddhist
in him?
Dear Dr. Chevillard,
Please check for me M. E. Adiceam, Contribution a l'etude
d'Aiyanar=Sasta, Pondichery, 1967. Does Marguerite Adiceam
talk any thing Buddhist in relationship to Aiyanar?
Many thanks,
N. Ganesan
