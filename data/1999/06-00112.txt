a question as to Atisha's works in Sanskrit
Dear colleagues,
 we are interested in sanskrit original works by Atisha; we are aware
of Bodhi-patha-pradipa restored from the Tibetan but we would like to
know about any his works that survived in Sanskrit; we'd also like to
know whether his Bodhisattva-maNi-AvalI preserved in Sanskrit or not.
Many thanks in advance. Sincerely yours, Ilona and Dmitry
