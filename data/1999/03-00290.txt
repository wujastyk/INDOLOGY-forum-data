Dear Indology List members:

1. I need to check on money transfers before, during and after the 1947
partition of India. Is it true that many in the govt, in high places,
managed to get money out of the area that became Pakistan and into India
by wire transfers using British-owned banks? Any citations that would
corroborate this or describe the movements of capital within the country
during the few months before and after partition?

2. If Britain owed India 1.3 billion pounds at the end of WWII, (Sugata
Bose and Ayesha Jalal, Modern South Asia pg 159) was it ever repaid?With
interest?

Many thanks in advance for your assistance.
