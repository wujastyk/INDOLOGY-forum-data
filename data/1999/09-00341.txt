Website at the Institute for Oriental Studies, Thane
I am reproducing below a recent potentially useful message received from
Dr. Vijay Bedekar, who is not a member of this list:
19 Sep 1999. The Institute for oriental study, Thane has launched a Website
with the address
<http://www.orientalthane.com/>http://www.orientalthane.com  This is
probably the first Website on Oriental/Indology launched from India. We
have made attempts to make the site highly informative and user friendly.
The institute has been working in the field for the last 15 years. We have
conducted about 23 seminars on different facets of Indian culture. At least
the abstracts of last ten seminars would be available on the site very
soon. It would be a mine of information.  The SPEECHES SECTION would
feature writings of various scholars in  the field.  NEWS AND VIEWS
SECTION would keep you informed on various academic research findings by
different universities and  organizations besides matters of general
interest related to Oriental/Indology studies all over the world.  SEMINAR
DIARY will include a calendar of forthcoming meets and workshops being held
worldwide.
