Dear Srinivas,

Where did you read this? In Jagadeesan's book?

Thiru. Raa. Ragahvaiyangar (Sethusamasthana vidhvan
along with his maternal cousin, Mu. Raghavaiyangar;
RR gave many mss./corrections to UVS edition of CT;
Sethupatis established the first research jl.
for Tamil studies in 1900 with RR as its editor),
in his CEtunATum tamizum, 1924, Madurai writes
on p. 7:
"ivaruTaiya (ie., Sethupathi's)  puNNiyanATu tamiziR
periya JAn2ikaTkum iTamAya ten2patu, caivattiR ciRanta
JAn2ayokiyAkiya srI tAyumAn2avar neTunATTaTaGkic
camAtiyaTaintaruLiya mukavaiyum, vicatavAkcikAmaNiyAkiya
vaiShNavAcArriyarAyt  teyvamum azaittup pEcum
tUya JAn2amum  uTaiya maNavALa mAmun2ivar vaLarntu ciRanta
*cikkaR kaTAramum* tan2pAR kONTu viLagkuvatan2AR palarum
aRiyattakkatu".

VishNu, on his own, called upon MaNavALamun2ikaL and conversed,
this is told to us by M. himself:

   nAmAr periyatiru maNTapamAr namperumAL
   tAmAka en2n2ait tan2iyazaittu nImARan
   centamiz vEtattin2 cezumporuLai nALumiGkE
   vanturaiyen2 REvuvatE vAyntu.

Cikkal kaTAram of M. is in Sethu country.

Regards,
N. Ganesan

PS: You wrote about IccambADi ayyangars; Do you know anyone?
Last time I was in India, from my family heirloom of
about 1000 books printed prior to 1930, I brought a few.

One is a translation of kuvalayAnandam, an alamkara text
from Sanskrit. mukavUr mInATcicuntarak kavirAyar rendered
into Tamilc ceyyuL (poems); Pachaiyappa coolege Sanskrit
pandit, tirumalai IccambADi satAvadAnam SrinivasAcharyar
checked it with the Sanskrit original. Printed in 1895
by Ettayapuram Raja. If any IccambADiyAr wants a copy,
I will gladly oblige.
