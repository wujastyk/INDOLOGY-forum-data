Dear Dr. Deshpande & Dr. Cousins,

P. Olivelle, upaniSads, OUP, p. xxxvi
[footnote 21]
"Much of the chronology of the upani.sads and of other ancient
texts depends on the date of the Buddha's death. The generally accepted date
of around 486 BCE has been challenged recently.
Bechert's dating  of 375-355 BCE ('The Date of the Buddha
reconsidered', Indologica Taurinensia, 10, 1981, 29-36) has been
supported by Erdosy using archaeological data ('The archaeology of
Early Buddhism' in N. K. Wagle and F. Watanabe (eds.)
Studies in Buddhism in honor of A. K. Warder (Toronto: University
of Toronto Centre for South Asian studies, 1993), p. 40-56. If the
latter date is accepted, which I favor, then the dates of the early
upaniSads should be pushed forward a century or so
(see Witzel 1989, 241-251)"

I just extended this reasoning to RV date.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
