marAThI bELA (jasmine)
In Marathi language, bELA refers to jasmine flower.
In KannaDa, we express
`idu beLLagidE' for `this is white'; and
`idu biLiya baNNa' for `this color is white'.
 Note the jasmine is white in color, and KannaDa beLLe
and Tamil veLLai means 'white' color.
Then, is the jasmine `bELA' in Marathi related
to the Dravidian root for white (beLLe, veLLai)?
Does KannaDa and/or Telugu use `bELA/bEla' for mallige?
