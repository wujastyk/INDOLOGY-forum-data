BeLagoLa in Sravana beLagoLa
Esteemed Indologists,
I read about the toponymy for bElUru and beLagAm connected
with the tamil titles, vEL/vELir/vELALar/veLLALan in this list.
Sravana beLagoLa, the famous Jain shrine exhibiting the nude ascetic,
in a monolith, contains the word, "beL-". Is this "beLa" cognate with
 tamil veL-? What does "beLagoLa" mean? A "tank dug by beLa"?
Any inscriptional data is much appreciated.
Yours,
SM
