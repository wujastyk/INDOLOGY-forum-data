Racial Origin of Caste (Re: varna and jati)
Hi Samar,
Obviously the opinions of Clyde Winters and Runuko Rashidi won't
be too popular with some on this list. I've corresponded with
both these researchers over the Internet.  The genetics articles are
mainstream though.
I notice that you are posting from an Indian address.  Were you able
to see Rashidi when he came to India?  The Black identity movement seems
to be gaining a lot of popularity among Dalits.  And Winters is widely
published in South Indian journals.
