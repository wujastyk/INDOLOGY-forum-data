    Note that the town, puumpukaar is pronounced as puumpuhaar;
  This is in your post itself; In a similar manner, kaNNaki is
  pronounced as kaNNahi.

Pl. refer to Prof. Bh. Krishnamurti's posting where he says
Skt. kalaha is possibly of Dravidian origin. If so,
ta. kalakam gives birth to skt. kalaha. k->h.

BhK> 'disturb, agitate,stir up, quarrel' (1303)
BhK>[both Skt. kalaha- and kalu.sa- seem to belong here].

BhK>Burrow (1948) gives the meaning 'bundle' as the basis of semantic

Nanda Candran:
<<<
Actually my mother once pointed out Samskrutam alphabets in
Tamizh. I think the "sha" in kashtam (trouble) or nashtam
(loss) is of Samskrutam origin and is not an original Tamizh
alphabet. Similarly if I remember right the "ha" is also not of
Tamizh origin, but borrowed from Samskrutam. (Can Tamil scholars
confirm if the alphabet features in ancient Tamizh words and not
as a noun?). The "ha" is very prominent in Samskrutam -
sam(h)Aram, gra(h)anam etc. Both the "ha" and "sha" feature
heavily in brAhmanic Tamizh which incorporates Samskrutam liberally
with Tamizh.

So Kanna(h)i? And is this the way CilappathikAram has it? If so,
the name of the heroine of CilappathikAram may itself not be of
Tamizh origin!

  Now, you are saying that kaNNaki is not a Tamil?!
