I would like to know if you or members of your devotional community trace any
spiritual lineage to somebody like Ramanuja. If so, who are the links in this
chain? Since you mentioned AzvArs in one of your earlier postings, among the
Agarwals  how widespread is the knowledge about AzvArs?

 The website is undergoing a massive revision to correct the errors that
 crept in and to enlarge it considerably. We will be focussing only on the
 Sanskrit Vedanta of the Sampradaya as I as well as the co-author (who is an
 American convert to Hindu Dharma) are ignorant of Tamil. >>
I would like  know when it is ready.
