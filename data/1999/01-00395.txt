I mkae a difference between tantra and rasayana, about the latter I've no
knowledge about the first, but I'm sure that the mainstream of tantra is
meant as the way to moksha.
PKM>>> Then Shiva-Shakti is the same as Yin-Yang.

If yoy would know anything about Chinese texts you would know that the work
called now the Nei Ching is a forgery. In the Tao-te Ching it appears that
yin is the preactive fase of cosmic energy and yang the subsequent active
fase. So both are very much comparable with the positive and negative pool
of electricity. The same opinion you'll find in the commentaries of the I
Ching and in neoconfucianism FI Chou Tun-i.
