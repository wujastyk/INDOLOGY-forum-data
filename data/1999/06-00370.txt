The Library of Congress has a rich collection of Indian music
recordings acquired by its offices in India and Pakistan, and also by
copyright deposit of recordings produced in the U.S.  In addition it
has a very large collection of old 78 rpm recordings produced by
Columbia and His Master's Voice in the subcontinent, going back to the
1930s or earlier.  These are indexed in the microfilm Rigler and
Deutsch Index kept here and at several other institutions.  Conditions
for use may be found at the Recorded Sound Reference Center's homepage
(http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/record/ ).

The Archives and Research Centre for Ethnomusicology in New Delhi, an
institution supported by the American Institute of Indian Studies, has
a collection of tapes made as copies from the recordings made by
American ethnomusicologists, anthropologists, and musicians; of copies
made from commercial recordings lent them by individuals; of tapes
made directly from performances; and also of commercial recordings.

Sincerely,

Allen Thrasher
