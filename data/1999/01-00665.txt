Dear Mr Sanjeev,

The following message which you posted yesterday to INDOLOGY looks awfully
like an advertisement.  It is certainly not a direct answer to the
question posed.  I am letting it go this time, but if this happens again,
I shall cancel your subscription to INDOLOGY.   This list is for the
exchange of scholarly knowledge, not the promotion of commerce.

If you have a book site which you would like publicized, you are free to
write to me and ask for the site to be added to the INDOLOGY "book shops
and publishers" web page.

Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
