A pancanga program based on the Suuyasiddhaanta
is available at my ftp site:

ccftp.kyoto-su.ac.jp/pub/doc/sanskrit/pancanga

where pancang2.exe is a MSDOS executable program

and pancang2.pas is its source program.

You can download them.

The program is intended for historial purpose, but
we can produce a purely traditional Indian calendar
of nay time without using elements of modern astronomy
except trigonometry.

The ftp server can be accessible from my homepage:

PS I am now planning to revise the program so that you
can run it at my homepage.
