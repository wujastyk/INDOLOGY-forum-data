Indian Calendar Astronomical Data
A pancanga program based on the Suuyasiddhaanta
is available at my ftp site:
ccftp.kyoto-su.ac.jp/pub/doc/sanskrit/pancanga
where pancang2.exe is a MSDOS executable program
and pancang2.pas is its source program.
You can download them.
The program is intended for historial purpose, but
we can produce a purely traditional Indian calendar
of nay time without using elements of modern astronomy
except trigonometry.
The ftp server can be accessible from my homepage:

PS I am now planning to revise the program so that you
can run it at my homepage.
