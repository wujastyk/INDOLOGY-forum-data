Dr. R. N. Dandekar: 90 not out
Cc:
March 20, 1999
Not many Indologists the world over may be aware that Dr. R. N.
(raamacandra naaraayaNa) Dandekar has completed 90 years of his active life
as a scholar, teacher, administrator and organizer, on March 17, 1999. A
biographical note on his life and work is under preparation and will
shortly be posted in the Indology List. As one who has the privilege of
having been his student, I felicitated him on this occasion with a Sanskrit
verse which runs as follows:
bhuuyaMso bhuvane bhavanti guravo ye naama zabdaplavair
jnaanaambhonidhilanghane dhRtimato vidyaarthinaH kurvate /
jnaanaambhodhitalaM vigaahya suciraM ratnaany avaaptuM balaM
ziZye jaagarayanti ye gurutamaas te durlabhaas tvaadRzaaH //
And I add a verse I wrote on him 20 years ago on a similar occasion:
taM numo 'nyaH zaraNyo na zabdazrutividaaM yataH /
api candram aziitaaMzuM bhiiZmaM raamaabhidhaM gurum //
Note: zabdazrutividaaM = (of) scholars of grammar and of Veda.
