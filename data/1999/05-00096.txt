I work with a Windows machine. I opened the posting, but not the happy99.exe
file. When I ran my McAfee virus scan on it, it did not find any virus. (My
anti-virus software is a year old.) Should I consider my PC to be infected
and go through the whole process of disinfecting it? (I have deleted the
happy99.exe file.)
