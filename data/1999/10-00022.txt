Dear Amused KSA,

Please accept my respects.

According to the Bhagavat Purana, the Puranas and the ancient histories,
which include the Mahabharata (in which Bhagavad-gita exists)are
considered the fifth Veda.

BP 3.12.39:

"Then he [Brahma] created the fifth Veda-?the Puranas and the
histories?-from all his mouths, since he could see all the past, present
and future."

Sincerely,

AB
