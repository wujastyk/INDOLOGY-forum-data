Vishal asks:
I have a related question and would be obliged if List members could answer
the same. The Syrian ('St. Thomas) Christians of Kerala claim that their
anscestors were Nambudiri Brahmins who were converted by Thomas, the
disciple of Jesus, in the 1st Cent. C.E. If the Nambudiris were not around
then, then how could this have been possible? Are the claims of the St
Thomas Christians false?
