pANi as style/school
N. Ganesan wrote:
PANi is a musical term in the Natyasastra and all the later musicological works till 
17th cent.  I am competent to speculate on Bharatnatyam terms, but the general tendency 
after the 16th/17th cent is that many classical terms from natya were given limited and 
transformed meanings in the arts. "Bani" , gati, dharmi, etc., are many such examples.
Anga, as used by katthak dancers is yet another such term.
The acnient terms for style in performance are vritti and pravritti
