Thanks, Mrs. Storm. I have the book already.

I appreciate any info rAjalIlAsana sculptures
from Cambodia?

Have not yet checked Art of Japan and Korea books on this
aspect. Like Song dynasty Guanyins from South China,
are Kannons in Japan in rAjalIlAsana famous too?
Do we have Korean Avalokitas in rAjalIlAsana?

Any Khmer, Korean, Japanese rajalilasana sculptures???

N. Ganesan
