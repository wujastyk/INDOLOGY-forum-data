Does Purusha will?

A very sensible proposal. I would however suggest translating guNa (in
sAMkhya contexts only, of course!) differently; say 'aspect' or
'constituent'. The reasons for this approach: the guNas themselves have
qualities (e.g. sattvaM laghu prakAzakam, sattva is light and brilliant, SK
13), and there is no substance that they would qualify: simply the three
guNas together *are* the material substance, prakRti. And this contradicts
European (Aristotelian) notions of substance and quality, and also the
vaizeSika concept of quality (unfortunately also called guNa): dravyAzrayy
aguNavAn ... iti guNa-lakSaNam (The characteristics of quality: inheres in a
substance, has no qualities ...; vaizeSikasUtra 16).
    Though it is generally hazarous to translate one and the same word
differently, I feel that it cannot be helped. Wherever guNa means "sattva,
rajas and tamas", it *must not* be translated as quality - it can be left
untranslated, or a specific term must be selected for the purpose (some more
ideas: 'factor', 'thread'). In other contexts 'quality' still seems to be
the best choice.
    The situation is similar, say, in the case of 'dharma' - it will also
mean 'quality' quite often, but at other times it wil be 'law' etc.
