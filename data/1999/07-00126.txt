Quite a while ago I believe the Gorresio edition of the Ramayana was
reprinted in India: Does anyone know if it is still available?  I remember
that the institiute that published it wouldn't sell me a copy because I
wasn't a member.  I would appreciate also a bibliographical reference,
since my notes were lost in a flood.
