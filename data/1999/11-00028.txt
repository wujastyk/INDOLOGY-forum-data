When did the gods become literate? Was: Are the gods literate?
George Thompson asks:
  This is probably not the best answer, but Gods being literate was
atleast a common phenomenon by the time of kAlidAsa( which century is
another big controversy)..The story of his being made literate by his wife's
favorite Godess has been written and discussed in a no of places..In
addition, the story of JayadEva talks( approx 12th century AD) about a
"literate Krishna"..The story is that Jayadeva is supposed to have been
confused over the completion of a verse and is supposed to have gone for a
bath when Krishna came in disguise and completed
the verse....
Regards,
Krishna
