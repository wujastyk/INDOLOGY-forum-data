Isn't the word pronounced as "kazhlai" rather than "kalai", in Tengalai and
Vadagalai. If so, wouldn't it refer to the Tamizh world "kazhlai" which
means "branch" ie the Northern branch and the Southern branch of
Vishistadvaitam.

And isn't one of the major differences between the two streams, the
acceptance of scriptures only in Samskrutam (by the Northerners) to the
rejection of the works in Tamizh accepted by the Southerners?
