A simple question for Sanskritists

Actually, the double "t" in pattra *is* etymological: the word is formed
from the root pat- "to fly" and the affix -tra which gives the sense
"thing for doing that action with" -- hence zastra- "weapon for cutting",
pAtra- "vessel for drinking" etc. Other comparable words are chattra-
"canopy" from chad- "to cover", sattra- "sacrificial session" from sad-
"to sit", and tottra- "elephant goad" from tud- "to strike".
However, the sequence ttra is in practice indistinguishable from tra (in
speech, I mean), and so the spellings in tra are generally commoner --
perhaps partly because ttra is slightly awkward to write in Nagari. In the
Critical Edition of the Mahabharata, for instance, the tra spellings are
favoured (without total consistency) for pattra, sattra and chattra;
however, tottra is always spelt with ttra.
