This thread is hereby decisively closed.  The discussion of contemporary
politics in India has never been welcome on this list.

INDOLOGY was created specifically for the discussion of Classical India.
There are numerous appropriate forums for discussing the fall of the BJP
government, etc.  There are NOT numerous alternative forums for Classical
Indian studies.

Please respect the integrity of this list, and its specific mission.
