Where does Nehru say that Persian and Arabic are part of the Indian
 cultural heritage?
>>>

 In India, Persian and Arabic are given protection as
 Classical languages.

 But not Tamil!!!. Tamil has 2300 years of continuous
 literary tradition, its love/"interior landscape"
 poems/poetics is unmatched anywhere.

 IVC language is definitely agglutinative and most
 probably a Dravidian language (cf. I. Mahadevan, A. Parpola).

 It is high time Tamil is given protection in India
 just like Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian.

 With high regards,
 N. Ganesan
