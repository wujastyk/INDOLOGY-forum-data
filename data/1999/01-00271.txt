Nehru and Persian/Arabic
<<<
Where does Nehru say that Persian and Arabic are part of the Indian
 cultural heritage?
 In India, Persian and Arabic are given protection as
 Classical languages.
 But not Tamil!!!. Tamil has 2300 years of continuous
 literary tradition, its love/"interior landscape"
 poems/poetics is unmatched anywhere.
 IVC language is definitely agglutinative and most
 probably a Dravidian language (cf. I. Mahadevan, A. Parpola).
 It is high time Tamil is given protection in India
 just like Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian.
 With high regards,
