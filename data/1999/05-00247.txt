INDOLOGY Digest - 10 May 1999 to 11 May 1999 (#1999-55)

but seems spurious.  As far as ayyangAr dialects are concerned, does
anyone know of phonologies/grammars/etc. of SrIvaiSNava dialects of tamil?
The only study I know of is AK Ramanujan's essay on Iyer vs. Iyengar
dialects in "Structure and Change in Indian Society" (Singer and Cohn
eds.)...
