Query: Etymology of sanskrit "aham"/ I
Dear Subscribers,
i am looking for the etymology of the sanskrit (or pali) word
"aham"= I.
further i would have a question to the instrumental Form of "aham":
maya.
Does this instrumental Form from aham "maya" have any
etymology relation to the substantiv "maya = illusion"?
Thanks for your answer,
sincerely,
Pascale Didier
