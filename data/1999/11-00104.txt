Subject: Query: Etymology of sanskrit "aham"/ I
Message-ID: <161227053383.23782.2257345689339850874.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Subscribers,


i am looking for the etymology of the sanskrit (or pali) word
"aham"= I.

further i would have a question to the instrumental Form of "aham":
maya.

Does this instrumental Form from aham "maya" have any
etymology relation to the substantiv "maya = illusion"?

Thanks for your answer,

sincerely,

Pascale Didier
