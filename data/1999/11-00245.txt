Parasol in India
Exactly; I was planning to write about this! Million thanks
for those who shared their valuable insights. Hope others will
enhance what is said.
In a National Geographic book, in the section on India,
there is a nice painting where a ceylonese king, (Parakramabahu).
The king is having a party with lot of girls around;
There is a white umbrella help over the king there.
1)   Do the Pali and Mahayana works describe the royal umbrella?
What about Jain texts? Hemacandra?
2) Is this royal parasol common in Iranian and IE myths?
