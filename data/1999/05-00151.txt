The MBh preserved several widely different "sAMkhya" versions, and clearly
the conceptual framework in the gItA is far from uniform. It seems that the
later chapters (after the twelfth) represent a terminology closer to
classical sAMkhya; and this must have been more familiar for zaGkara. So the
reason why he preferred the list in ch.13 might well be because this was the
standard sAMkhya version.

Sure!

I thought it was more or less the accepted opinion that the BhG is older
than the SK. Are there substantial arguments to question this?

Sorry for the misunderstanding: when I wrote "first of all" I meant
'eminently' and not 'historically earliest".

[On the number of the indriyas:]
> The kArikAs opt for thirteen.
No: in the SK there are clearly eleven indriyas, see SK 24-27, 49. Thirteen
is the number of the components of the antaHkaraNa.

The two birds - as can be seen from the context of the same passage in the
zvetAzvatara IV. 6 & 7 - are not the puruSa and a material ego (or
whatever), but two puruSas: one
liberated, one bound; and it is the liberated 'bird' that looks on without
eating, anaznann abhicAkazIti.

I have a feeling that the equation undecaying = unchanging was the invention
of advaita, and also I think that its import into sAMkhya was a later
development, clearly present only in the yukti-dIpikA. I also think that the
conception of kUTastha is not only missing in, it is also inconsistent with
the SK.

> Ishware Krishna makes the Self devoid of all qualities - even bliss.
The puruSa is aguNa in the SK, but it does not mean 'qualitiless', rather
'without the three guNas', i.e. the constituent qualities of prakRti.

Liberation is the cessation of suffering (also for the Buddha). The path is
to overcome wordly desires. The *liberated* puruSa clearly has no
inclination towards the prakRti any more: dRSTA mayety upekSakaH (SK 66; He
is indifferent *because* he has seen her).

[Also Nanda Chandran: > The purpose or will, is that of PrAkriti]
The milk flows to feed the calf - but it does not want to feed him; while he
*wants* to be fed.
Of course all occurrences of artha in the SK can be interpreted as
'advantage', not 'purpose', as is the standard procedure in order to get the
later notion of absolutely unchanging soul. But the SK gains in consistency
if we abandon this routine.
   Before creation the puruSa was fine - prakRti could not serve his
advantage by her evolution. On the other hand, with a more naive conception
of puruSa we can say: he noticed nature and wanted to see her; then he found
only death and suffering; so now he wants to be alone again. (Indeed in SK
17 kaivalyArthaM pravRttiH is a symptom of the puruSa).
   Generally my position is not that there cannot be a SK interpretation
without a puruSa willing; rather that there can be one with it - and that it
seems to be a more coherent interpretation, but one less in accord with the
commentaries.

Sorry [ :-( ] for the misunderstanding. The judge was an example independent
of the SK, and the remark in brackets was intended as a joke only; I wanted
to show this by the :-) symbol, representing a smiling face [sleeping, I
suppose :-) ].

I do not know. When even the indriyas are said to be sAttvika ekAdazakaH, it
would seem very hard to conceive of a buddhi with a dominance of the guNa
tamas. It is not clear, whether a blade of grass has a buddhi or not (it
seems that it has); perhaps it has a minuscule buddhi only (after all it
grows toward light) or its buddhi might be covered by tamas. The "tAmasaM
buddhi-rUpaM" mentioned in SK 23 (which is, I think, a problematic verse
from the point of view of textual criticism) is clearly adharma, ajJAna,
rAga and anaizvarya; and that seems to be adhyavasAya all right, though
*improper* grasping (or conceptualization or understanding).

I generally agree: I would translate saMkalpaka as 'coordinator', following
gauDapAda (and also nyAya-sUtra IV.2.2, if I understood it correctly), and
also implying that manas coordinates the activity of the karmendriyas; i.e.
it translates the conceptual commands (or intentions) coming "from above"
into vegetative efferent impulses - a nice piece of anachronism, isn't it?
:-)
