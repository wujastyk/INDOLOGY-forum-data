Tripitaka of the Vipassana Research Institute

There is an article by Frank Richard Hamm which presents an evaluation
of different editions of the Pali Tripitaka, the original German
version: "Zu einigen neueren Ausgaben des Pali-Tipitaka," in:
ZDMG. 112. 1962, pp. 353-378; the English version ("On some recent
editions of the Pali Tipitaka") was published in: German scholars on
India...ed. by the Cultural Dept. of the Embassy of the Fed.Rep. of
Germany, New Delhi. Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Ser. Office, 1973,
pp. 123-135. In the past years Oskar von Hinueber published some
articles on the South-East Asian manuscript transmission of the Pali
canon. So far I know, a comprehensive study is still lacking.
I never used the "Vipassana" edition, so I don't know how to use it;
the older Nalanda Devanagari edition by Bhikkhu Jagadish Kashyap et
al. gives full pages references to other editions of the canon.
