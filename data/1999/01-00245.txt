What difference would it make?  That would not prove origin one way
or the other. Tantric tradition itself credits much knowledge as
 coming from Mahacina.  Why would you have a hard time accepting that?
  It makes a LOT of difference. We have in Tamil a tantra
  text of 3000 poems in 5th century AD. Sanskrit does have
  tantras. If one does not have Tantra texts from (mahA)China
  of comparative dates, then I have a very hard time believing
  what you say. That is, tantric tradition came to India
  (Sanskrit or Tamil) from (mahA)China.
