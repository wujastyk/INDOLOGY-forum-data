Tibetan Origin of Tantrism and Siva
Of course!  This whole thread seems to be written from a standpoint of high
imagination -- to say the least. Is not Indology an ACADEMIC list?  Please!
Quite a bit is known about Tantrism, none of which seems however to be
known to some the previous contributors to this thread...  Is there no way
to get Indology back on an Academic track?
