Samkhya Karikas precede the Brahmasutras. From slightly pre-Samkara accounts
of the schools of Philosophy in India (like the Harshacarita of Bana), it is
clear that the 'Aupanishadas' were just one amongst the numerous schools of
Philosophy in India, and I would even venture to state that Bhagvatpada
acted like a 'sectarian' Vedantin who claimed that the Vedanta
interpretation alone conformed to the teachings of the Upanishads.
Vidya said: Regarding later commentators, I suggest that their invoking
Vishnu as a
catalyst to bring about the manifestation of the world is not something
totally new. If one goes back to proto-Samkhya or "epic Samkhya", i.e. to
texts like the mok.sadharma in MBh, there is an underlying unifying
principle behind the dualism of prakRti and purusha. I would also venture to
suggest that what is normally called proto-Samkhya in these texts can
equally well be called proto-Vedanta.
Vishal: To this, I would like to add a quotation from the now lost
.sa.stitantra in numerous Bhashyas of the Karikas: "Purushadhishtitam
pradhanam pravarttate". And, the word 'Adhyatmic' is used as a synomyn for
'Samkhya' in the Mahabharata as well. (Whereas, with the passage of time, it
becomes a synonymn for Vedanta)
