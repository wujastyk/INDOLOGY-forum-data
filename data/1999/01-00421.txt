Classical vs. Modern

He has already very patiently explained his view why tamil cannot be
called classical . This is because it is current and evloving and
therefore changing. You may not agree with his view. That does not give
you liberty to use disrespectful language.
Please will you kindly quote the postings of Prof.Bh.Krishnamurti
which made you feel that he will do any such thing. As far as I know
he has not made any remarks against tamil. As a matter of fact he
in his postings, he has clearly stated that tamil preserves quite a bit
old dravidian usages. Please see the archives of Indology. But
of course if any body claims that tamil is the only dravidian
language that is a lie.
No body has made any remarks about A.K.Ramanujam. Hence all this is
out of place.
This shows your irrational hatred towards him rather than any thing else.
Again please substantiate your remarks.
I do not think it makes any difference to him.
When the list officially recognises classical tamil why was
this demand made on the Indology list? There is no necessity of
the demand. What was the motive in raising the bogey of tamil being
threatned? Who has threatned it? Were your postings censored?
Did anybody prevent you for expressing your view? But if you expect
others to simply accept whatever you post, that of course is
impossible.
You have unwarrantedly used very uncivil language against
a wellknown linguist and it is you who have to consider packing up
and going else where if you do not like this list.
