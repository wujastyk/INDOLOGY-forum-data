River Krishna
The possible related group I can think of is DEDR 4160a. *pee.n-:*pe.n-V-
'to twine, twist' with cognates in all subgroups. wee.nii is perhaps derived
from this verb. I do not have Mayrhoffer readily to check. The course of a
river looks like a long plaited hair (which is what wee.nii means in
wee.niisaMhaara 'untying the wee.nii'). This accounts for Kr.s.nawee.nii.
The River Pennaa near Nellore is Sanskritized as Pinaakinii.
pe.n.n-ee_r/pe.n.n-aa_r can be derived from the same route meaning'a river
of twisted course' (like the 'snake river' below). DEDR gives Ta. pen.n.nai
'palmyra'with the group of words meaning 'woman, female, etc.', and no other
Dravidian lg. shows that meaning. Another possibility is 4436 *pee.n
-**pe.n-V- 'protect, increase, etc.' Telugu pennaa could be an abridgement
of penn-aa_r (with the loss of final _r), although in Telugu the normal word
is ee_ru (<*yaa_t-). The isogloss of aa- (<*yaa-)could touch Nellore, like
tiru- in tirupati.
