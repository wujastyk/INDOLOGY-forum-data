and to C.R. Selvakumar for further examples.
PS:  I forgot to mention that Kalaapa is already attested in Panini
(whenever he actually lived); Kalpaapa is the name of hte founder of a
Black Yajurveda school (that of the MaitrAyaNIya), mentioned by him next to
that of the KaTha and Caraka.
Bird names for Vedic teachers are not altgether rare (see Studien zur
Indologie und Iranistik, vol. 10 (1983/85), pp.  231-237), e.g.    Tittiri:
TaittirIya, Haridru : Haridravika, etc.
More on bird, souls, urns, etc . later.
