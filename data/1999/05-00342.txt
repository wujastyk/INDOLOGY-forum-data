Subcastes of Madhva Brahmins
I lost all touch with the family after July 1993 and do not have their
contact information. Sorry.

Vishal:
No  doubt  the  "Godbole"  family  could  be  MAdhvas,  but  why  are
they  much  respected  in  Dharmasthala  which  is  in  South  Kanara
Distt.  of  KarnATaka?  Can  you  find  out  for  sure  and  let  me
know.  Thanks.
