Chambaa vaMzaavalii
Dear list members.
I'm Keisuke Nagata, graduate student of Kyoto University.
I have an interest in king's chronology of ancient/medieval
India.(ex. RaajataraGgiNii, vaMzaavaliis)
I'm now studying vaMzaavalii, and inscriptions of Chambaa
state,  collected by J.Ph.Vogel. But I'm suffring from
insufficiency of informations about this field.
Would you tell me about some instractive advice, or
specialist about this matter ?
I'll welcome any information about (Chambaa)vaMzaavaliis.
Sincerely yours.
