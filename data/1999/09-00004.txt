Date of the Buddha and RV
H. Bechert, The date of the Buddha reconsidered, Indologia
Taurinensia, 1982, 11, p. 29-36 gives the summary that, based on
several Japanese scholars' work, the Buddha's parinirvana is around
350 B.C. This date of the Buddha (350 BCE) is basically correct since
L. Cousins' review on Buddha's date on Indology web also takes
it to be 400 BCE. Probably to be little more conservative.
Scholars assumed a date of 600 BCE just one or two dacades ago.
Will this bringing forward of the Buddha's times by a minimum
of two centuries have a bearing on the date of the Rig Veda?
Ie., the RV's age can be younger by atleast two centuries?
