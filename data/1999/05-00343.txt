XI World Skt Conf
Dear Colleagues:
I would like to inform you that the Asiatica Organization
(http//www.asiatica.org), where you can find the registration form to
the next Skt conference is *not responsible* for the organization of
the XI World Sanskrit Conference. We just wrote the WWW page -- as a
service to Indological studies, and as a favor to colleagues and to
CESMEO.
For further info on the conference, please contact the organizers.
Thank you,
Enrica
