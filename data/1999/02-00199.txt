   Hayavadana, you may not know. The above statement about sanskrit is
   a common myth propagated by high elites with vested interests.
   If you go to villages and listen, their Tamil contains
   Sanskrit terms approaching towards zero percent.
   Even in Malayalam, as you descend down the caste ladder,
   Sanskrit words drop off exponentially.
   It is also true that certain Tamil caste dialects, eg., Brahmins,
   are Sanskritized to a degree.
