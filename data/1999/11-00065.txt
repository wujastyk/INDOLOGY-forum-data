The film Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray and Andy Macdowell, is
amongst my family's favourites, and is an intriguing treatment of the
recurrence theme.  Does anyone know where PD Ouspensky got the idea for
his recurrence novel, The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin?  Was it Nietzsche?
Or was Ouspensky using ideas picked up during his Indian travels?
