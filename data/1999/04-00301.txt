Sanskrit to French dictionary
I made a new edition of my Sanskrit to French dictionary.
It is available through my Indology page, at
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~huet/SKT
where you will find instructions on how to download it.
Since many people had difficulty with the Postscript format, I made a pdf
version of it which everyone ought to be able to read with Acrobat Reader.
All comments welcome
