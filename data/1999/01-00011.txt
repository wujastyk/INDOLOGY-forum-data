Information on sesame (tila)
I would recommend, that you refer to the book "Indian Food A Historical
Companion" by K.T.Achaya published by Oxford India Paperbacks in 1998
(first published in 1994 by Oxford University Press). ISBN 0 19 564416
6. I obtained my copy in California at Barnes & Noble for $16.00!!
In case you are unable to obtain it, I quote from the book:
1. Page 17.
   At Harappa an unmistakable "lump of charred sesame" was found at a
depth of about two metres (Referenced from M.S.Vats, Excavations at
Harappa, Manager of Publications, Delhi, 1940, vol 1, p 466).
2. Page 31.
   The Rigveda mentions neither rice or wheat but only barley (yava);
the Yajurveda has all three, besides a panicum cereal, an oilseeed
(tila, sesame)...
3. page 33
   A book is mentioned(M.S. Randhawa, A History of Agriculture in India,
Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, vol 1,1980, (a) p.
179 (b) p.195f (c) p 169) which is described as 'a well documented book
has appeared on the foods and drinks that occur in those Sanskrit works,
chronologically listed from the earliest times to about AD 1200'.
Rice is mentioned as later dominating the Aryan food system was cooked
with milk and sesame seeds(krsara), perhaps a forerunner of the later
khichidi made from rice and dhal.

   Rice in the Southern Diet
   Rice was ofcourse mostly eaten boiled, but sometimes fried aromatics
were sprinkled on it. Dressing with tamarind gave puli-kari
(puli-sadam), and further with sesame seeds and sugar yielded
chitrannam. (Referenced from F.R. Allchin, in P.J.Ucko and
G.W.Dimbleby(eds), The Domestication and Exploitation of Plants and
Animals, gerald Duckworth and Co. Pvt. ltd., New Delhi, 1969, page 323.)

  A wild sesame seed, jartila, permitted as food to ascetics, is
recorded in the Taittiriya Samhita.(Referenced from M.S. Randhawa at
item 3 above).

   Sesame oilcake or sesame powder compounded with coarse rice flour and
jaggery gave the tasty fried dish shashkuli, the tilkut of
today.(B.B.Lal, 'The World's earliest Agricultural Field', Science Age,
Bombay, 1983, vol 1, no 3/4, October, p229.)(H.D. Sankalia, 'Some
aspects of Prehistoric Technology in India',Indian National Science
Academy, New Delhi, 1970, (a) pp45 - 51 (b) p 13.).
7. page 37
   Much later the physician Charaka recommends ghee for frying in
autumn, animal body fats in spring, and oil(with special commendation of
sesame oil) in the rainy season.

   The sugarcane is not mentioned in the Rigveda but occurs frequently
in all the Samhitas and its chewing is mentioned in the Atharvaveda.
Guda was the base for numerous sweet preparations. Mixed with it sesame
seeds were shaped to yield palala...

   Sushrutha's classification is fifteen-fold, and includes shali,
shastika and vrihi(all rices) as three of the classes, and yava(barley),
shimbi(horsegram) and tila (sesame) as separate classes.(Reference -
