Though it's true that I admitted ignorance of *some* of the
words, my last post pointed out that 'gha' is the actual
use instead of "ha" - for which there was no reply. For
example cloud is pronounced not as "me(ha)m" but "me(gha)m"
ny non brahmins.
And Ganesan came out with an ambiguous statement that based
on the context and situation, "ga" is pronounced as "ha". So
can you please verify from TolkAppiyam whether the alphabet
"ha" actually finds mention?
Even if it does find mention, then why is megham pronounced
in three different ways - megham, meham, megam?
But the problem is, while even brAhmanic life of today finds
great parallels with Manusmriti, non-brAhmanic Tamil life doesn't
with Thirukkural.
Even in my original posting, I'd made the statement expressing
my hesitation about its correctness. If I'd a copy of the kural
with me, I'd verify the statement. Unfortunately I don't. And
even if I'm wrong, I've no hesitation in admitting it.
Why is it that all threads eventually end up in personal attacks?
If you've any problems with my posts, please be specific and I'll
try to answer you to the best of my ability. If not, I'll be the
first one to admit my inability to do so. Please do not waste the
time and resource of everybody/everything concerned, in personal
attacks.
And concerning S Mathuresan's point that Sanskrit "phalam" is
derived from dravidian, can you please explain how such an
assertion is made? Please tell us the method used to verify
whether a word is derived from an external language?
It can be noticed that most illiterate Tamils pronounce "pazham"
as "palam". Infact very few non brAhmanic Tamils can even pronounce
"zha". Why is this so? Was "palam" the original pronounciation?
Then is "zha" derived from external sources?
