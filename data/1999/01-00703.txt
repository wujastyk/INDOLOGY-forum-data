Special Characters & Unicode

As  far as I know there are no special hexadecimal values assigned to
these codes. I think what you are looking for is a font to print these
characters. Except for a very basic set of characters which follow the
standard qwerty keyboard rest of them have a key sequence assigned by
the designer of the font.
If you are using MS windows there is a program called 'charcter map' that
can be used to see all the characters defined in a font and the key
sequence necessary to print them. Since you are using Pine to compose
your mail, you are probably using Unix and I am not sure of the name of the
program in Unix.
