Concept of Mukti and Shankaracharya
One more point on the foregoing:  I think that Shamkara is wrong to
attribute to the Buddha three mutually exclusive philosophical perspectives.
But he does seem to do so.
Re: Concept of Mukti and Shankaracharya
Here the reference seems to be to sarvAsthivAdins (vaibhASikAs),
vijnAnavAdins and zUnyavAdins. This is hardly an attack
by Sankara on Buddha as a person but an attack on the later
schools of Buddhism. Insteaad of refuting them individually
Sankara takes the easy way out. He heckles them for their lack
of unanimity about what is the teaching of Buddha.

sarma.
