Because it only preserves its "original form" by virtue of the fact that
conventional Romanisation uses "h" after a stop to indicate aspiration
-- i.e. one is taking advantage of a "side-effect". Writing "tadd hi" is
an open invitation to incorrect rendering back into Nagari (etc.).

This is not the only case where the initial of the second word undergoes
change: tat zrutvA > tac chrutvA, etc.
