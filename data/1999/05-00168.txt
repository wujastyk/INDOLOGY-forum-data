Rigveda: dravidian word kun.d.apa_yya
CT usage shows that ku.n.ta is not borrowed into Tamil.
Are than Old Iranian and IE cognates for ku.n.da (=pot)??
In addition to Chandra's quotations:
ku.n.du as "deep", "hole" occurs a lot. Compare the common
phrase, "ku.n.d.u, kuzi".
ku.n.tu = round vessel;
ku.n.tai = earthen pot;
ku.n.taa, ku.n.taan2 = pot;
ku.n.tam = tank, pot, pit
etc.,
Agastya, the kalasha muni, is famous in Java
and Kau.n.dinyavarman is the founder of Funan;
CT commentator says agastya leads the vELir expansion
to the South.
Is kau.n.di.nya from ku.n.da?
