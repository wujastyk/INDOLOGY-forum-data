Dear Prof. Hebbar,

As a kid, I remember Shri T. M. Pai visiting our fammily farm
and stayed with us; He was a minister in Indira's cabinet,
CS was minister of agriculture then, M. S. Swaminathan was the
Secretary of Agriculture. T. M. Pai visited Coimbatore to
start the Syndicate bank. I think Manipal educational institutions
were started by the Pai family.

Is Mr. Pai a TuLu or KoNkaNi?

Kind regards.
