Oh dear! By "old people" you probably mean grandparents. I was rather
thinking of young people in their twenties. Haven't you seen them: no sleep
for two nights, pale and haggard as they try to be nice to children
screaming blue murder and making all sorts of impossible demands? Not like
grandparents, who are always patient and benign, because they know they can
drop the little buggers in their parents' arms as soon as they get to be
completely intolerable. Paolo, you must be *very* young.

And by the way, I have been "coping" for about two years now, I have spent
far more time on debating with people I disagree with than most others on
the list, and I am still coping, thank you. But I admit to not having the
stamina of the very young any more, having almost reached the hoary age of
50.

Best regards,
