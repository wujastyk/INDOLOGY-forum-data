Diacritics font
John Smith wrote:
It is my understanding however that CSX+-encoded fonts are not particularly
useful for mixed-language documents, that is, documents which contain Sanskrit
and European languages other than English (e.g. German, French, Danish) that
require in themselves diacritical characters. The reason for this is that CSX+
has Sanskrit diacritical characters in places where ordinary TrueType-fonts, on
which amongst other things Windows' keyboard-layout is based, have diacritics for
such languages. If you want to type text in more than one language, these are
points that should perhaps be considered.
I myself have used John Smith's Norman fonts, slightly adapted to my own needs,
for several years, but am now just waiting for the possibilities that a full
implementation of Unicode in Windows 2000 will (hopefully) offer, in order not to
have any hassles with German umlauts anymore ...
