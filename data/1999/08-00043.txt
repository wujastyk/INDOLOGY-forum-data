        Dear Sir,
                The Danur Veda is one of the four upavedas.
                "War in Ancient India" by V.R.Ramachandra Dikshitar,
        published by Motilal Benarsidass-1944.
                It covers the subject along with much more later
        information.
        Regards
        Jayabarathi
