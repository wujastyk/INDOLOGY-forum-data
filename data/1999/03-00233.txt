Ref. check verse 7.22 Bhagavad Gita
If anyone could tell me if the BORI critical edition 1947 reading for
Bhagavad Gita verse 7.22 is "tasyA rAdhanam" or "tasyA ArAdhanam" I
would greatly appreciate it.
Belvalkar 1962 and The Mahabharata at Dr. J.D. Smith's web site  both
read "tasyA rAdhanam". Belvalkar does not list "ArAdhanam" as a
variation.
Dr. van Buitenen in "The Bhagavadgita in the Mahabharata", Col. Jacob's
concordance, Apte's Practical Sanskrit Dictionary and the popular
editions I checked including Dr. Radhakrishnan use "ArAdhanam".
Sankaracharya's Bhasya in Warrier's edition from Ramakrishna Math
paraphrases both i.e. "... rAdhanam ArAdhanam Ihate"
Many thanks
