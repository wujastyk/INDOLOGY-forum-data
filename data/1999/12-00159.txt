dakinis

Yes, of course many languages have onomatopoeic words like the ones I
gave for drumming.  However, do these words also have apparent
cognates with the meaning of "shaman"/"witch" etc ?   Certainly,
viewed from the Buddhist tantric tradition, there is a close
connection between .daakiniis and drums, specifically, .damaru made of
cranial hemispheres.  The form of the word .daakinii does not suggest
a Sanskrit derivation so I am trying to establish a reasonable
hypothesis for the actual source of the word -- it doesn't matter to
me whether it is Dravidian or Munda, although the latter would fit in
with other observations one can make about the history and use of the
word.
