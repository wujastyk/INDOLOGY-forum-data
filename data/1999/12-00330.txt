Sewell perhaps had not seen koGkutEca rAcAkkaL in print; Or,
does the Forgotten Empire mention k.racakkal mss.? The KR is
too late and may not be reliable/useful.

Would assign a higher weightage to inscriptions on vikramaditya
from Kerala/Tamilnadu region in late 8th or 9th centuries to
know Sankara's dates.
