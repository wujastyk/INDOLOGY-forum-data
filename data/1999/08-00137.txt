A question on Vedic vANa - 1
ta. pANan (bard) to vedic vANa may parallel the changes observed
in changes of village names in Gujarat, Sind etc.,
ta. paLLi => valli/vali (-oli/-ol in modern Gujarat)
ta. -pATi => -vATi. A. Parpola, Deciphering the Indus script, p. 170
"The place-names of the Harappan area provide one more potential source
of clues to identifying the Harappan language. Settlement names are
particularly relevant, because they may go back to the Early Harappan
period but not further. Among the elements which denote `village'
or `town' in the Harappan area there are several of common occurence that
are of non-Aryan etymology, and all of these have a Dravidian origin
and occur frequently in South Indian place-names. They include nag'ara
(cf. Binag'ara in Sind on Ptolomy's map [...]); palli `village' (whence
valli and modern -oli, -ol in Gujarat), corresponding to South Dr.
paLLi; pATa(ka) or pATi (whence -vATa, -vATi etc., modern -vADaa, vAD,
etc., in Gujarat) as well as paTTana (Gujarati paTTan), all originally
`pastoral village' from the Dravidian root paTu `to lie down, to sleep'. "
 Does vANI (= Sarasvati) denote the female counterpart of `vANa', the bard?
Then, IVC is a vANI civilization? The river names vENA/vENI may also
be formed out of the same process: Dr. peNNA => veNA/veNI.
