None
I have registered a new domain for INDOLOGY, so that the web pages of the
group can be reached more easily and conveniently.
Instead of having to remember
   http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
you can now find the exact same website via
   http://indology.findhere.com
The latter site automatically redirects you to the former one, so there is
no difference in the end result.  But "indology.findhere.com" is much
easier to remember!
This is somewhat experimental, so please report any unexpected experiences
to the list.
Thank you,
Dominik
