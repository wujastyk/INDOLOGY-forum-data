MUSIC ARCHIVES
Hi!
I am undertaking a study of Indian music and need admission to music
archives, public and privat, in order to deal with old recordings. In the
music stores, one hardly get any recording older than ca 1970.
Any suggestions regarding archives. I am aware of only two.
Sincerely
Jon Skarpeid
