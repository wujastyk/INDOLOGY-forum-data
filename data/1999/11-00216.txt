    Sorry that I was misled by a book in Tamil. Were the works by
  Ashvaghosha preserved in India proper? Some scholars doubt
  whether Padyacudamani is that old.

What about A;sva-gho.sa's Buddha-carita and Saundarananda? Or the
Padya-cuu.daa-ma.ni (or Siddhaartha-carita) ascribable to Buddha-gho.sa
(Madras 1921)?
