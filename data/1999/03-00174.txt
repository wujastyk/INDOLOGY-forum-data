To my knowledge, that is correct. I am working on a Ph.D. diss. on the
subject of naa.dii-jyoti.sa (despite the name no connection to pulse
reading, so far as I know), but that won't be out until 3-4 years from now
at the earliest. (And yes: I am in contact with Barry Pittard.) If anyone
knows of any scholarly publication on this subject, in whatever language,
I'd be very interested to hear of it.
