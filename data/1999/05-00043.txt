  One way to handle this is to increase the number of Professorships
in Tamil and other Dravidian language, lit. studies. Hope the Western
and Japanese universities do that. This issue was talked about before
particularly by Drs. Palaniappan and Zydenbos. Gladly, Dr. Martha Selby
is recently given a position at UTexas, Austin. Annac Chelvi,
D/O K. Paramasivan (teacher of Tamil to many Americans) conveys
her best wishes to Dr. Selby.
