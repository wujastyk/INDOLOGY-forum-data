Prof. Rabe might be interested in this article by the well known(?)
Ashok Row Kavi.

IMHO, discussion of Fire or for that matter politics is nor mentioned
in this list's charter.  If current day Indian issues/politics are
ok for this list, then I guess it should be mentioned as such.
General guidelines as to what is and what is not appropriate should
be mentioned.
Selective picking of topics in my opinion is not correct.

Subrahmanya.
