Naidunia Devanagari converter and BDF font available
I have put together a Perl script to convert Naidunia font-encoded Devanagari
text to UCS2 (big-endian, with BOM).  This is the first version, so please let
me know if you find problems with it or make improvements.

or

An 18pt BDF font with most of the glyphs needed for basic Unicode Devanagari
text (half-consonants and most common ligatures) is available at:
  http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/devnag.html
or

Furthermore, according to Mr Leisher:
The script should run with no problems on Windows and Mac as well,
as long as a Perl interpreter has been installed:

The important thing is the mapping table and the three conversion rules,
which can be easily reconstructed in another programming language.
