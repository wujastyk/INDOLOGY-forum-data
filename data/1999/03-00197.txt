River Krishna
The name of the River Krishna in AP in old times appears to have
been  called something cognate with the Tamil "karum peNNai";
'karum' refers to black color and 'peNNai' means palm tree.
We have vaTa(north) and ten2(south) peNNai rivers.
In medieval times, it looks "karum peNNai/peNNaar" was rendered as
KrishnaveNi, and later shortened to Krishna. Does Telugu material
or Kalingattup paraNi support this? Also, 'nalla' means
black in Telugu. Does Krishna (*karum* peNNai/peNNAr) have anything to
do with *Nalla*malai hills which have dark iron ore, mica.??
