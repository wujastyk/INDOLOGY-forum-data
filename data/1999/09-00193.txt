Dear Indologists,

        I have been contacted by some of you about the summary on the I-A
debate that I had promised to post over the summer.  Unfortunately I have
failed to do so partly because I was dreading the eruption of the type of
discussion that has just ensued, and partly because I was working
furiously on getting my book on the topic ready to give to Oxford
University Press by September.  That ms is ready and will be officially in
press within a fortnight.  I enclose the table of contents, below.  I am
also co-editing a volume including prominent points of view from all sides
of this issue with Laurie Patton which will be published by Curzon Press.
Contributors will include A. Parpola, M. Witzel, H. Hock, L. Fosse, J.
Shaffer, M. Deshpande, M. Kenoyer, S. Kak, B.B.Lal, S.S. Misra, S.
Talageri and S.P Gupta. Best, Edwin Bryant
