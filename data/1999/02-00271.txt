Dear Naga Ganesan

I feel I am probably not clear in what I want to say. I  do not talk
about the date when the GV was translated (at least not only) but
about the age of actual PHYSICAL MANUSCRIPTS of these
translations that your references stems from. I am sorry but I do
not know how else to say it.

Sincerely

Petr Mares
