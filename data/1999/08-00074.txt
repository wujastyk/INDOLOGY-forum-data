        Currently I am looking into origin myths about different Brahman
communities.  There are the famous stories in works like the
Sahyaadrikha.n.da about the origins of the Chitpavan, Karhade, and
Sarasvata Brahmins of Maharashtra and Goa.  Are there any origin stories
about the Brahman communities in Tamilnad, Andhra and Karnataka?
        Best,
