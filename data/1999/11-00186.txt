  Many communitites of non-brahmins have 'kOttiram'
  (same as gotra).In fact sEkkizaar is itself a kOttiram.
  The tamil word kOttiram comes from kO, meaning 'head'
  'leader', 'king'. Many kOttiram names end in 'kizaar',
  'Uraar' etc.Examples are cenkunRam kizaar, sEkkizaar,
   cEtUraar, pukazUraar etc.
