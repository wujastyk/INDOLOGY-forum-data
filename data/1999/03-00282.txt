bhAgavata < bhagavat = bhaga + vat = one possessed of 'fortune'. zaNkara in
his commentary on the Bhagavad-gItA (3.37) quotes a verse enlisting six
attributes together called 'bhaga'. The word bhagavat usually refers to
God, and, in a secondary sense, to any revered person. Resulting meaning:
worshipful, revered. bhAgavata(bhagavat + the secondary suff. a) refers to
a devotee of God.
bhakti (devotion) and bhakta (devotee) come from the root 'bhaj' to worship
suff.). bhaga also comes from the same root with the suffix 'a', changing j
to g. (Cp. tyAga < tyaj)
