ZAntideva - Digital Sanskrit Texts
Dear Subscribers
Over the next while, I am going to work on the text of "Engaging in the
Bodhisattva Deeds" or "BodhisattvacharyAvatAra" of ZAntideva.
Do any Subscribers know if this text is available in electronic form?  I
would be most interested in a Sanskrit version but if anyone knows of a
Tibetan version that would also be helpful.
Many thanks in advance.
