This is simply wrong.
The form "taddhi" has nothing to do with sandhi but is an attempt to
reproduce Nagari word-splitting conventions in a script where they are not
appropriate.
The form "tad-dhi" could only be taken as meaning that the two elements
have been joined into a compound, where in fact they are separate words.
The form "tat hi" is a pre-sandhi form, useful perhaps in a context of
elementary language instruction, but with no wider currency.
As I said earlier, cases of this sort have been written "tad dhi" by
professional Sanskritists (to whom the original question was directed)
for maybe a century and a half. This is also the only usage sanctioned by
the incoming ISO standard.
These are not my opinions; they are facts.
