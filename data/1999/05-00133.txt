Does the puruSa will? (was: Re: A text dealing with Ayurveda)
On 4 May 99 Ferenc Ruzsa wrote:
As I said previously, from the fact that X serves Y's purpose it does not follow
that Y actually purposes X. SK 57 is quite clear about this: as milk acts (i. e.
flows), albeit unwittingly, for the growth of the calf, so does nature act for the
liberation of the puruSa.
By comparing this passage to the preceding kArikA quoted by you, which
reads "pratipuruSavimokSArtham svArtha iva parArtha ArambhaH" it
becomes apparent that "pratipuruSavimokSArtham" in SK 56 is the same as
"puruSavimokSanimittam" in SK 57, and must be understood accordingly.
The meaning is *not* that creation is effected by nature because the puruSa
wills or purposes it, but rather it is effected *for the sake* of the puruSa's
liberation, exactly as the milk flows *not* because the calf wills it, but just
*for the sake* of the calf's growth.
What we have here is a sort of built-in teleology which can dispense with the
need of conscious purposes; but in any case, if there is purpose at all, it is
the nature's. SK 60 describes how nature goes out of her way to do what is
beneficial to the puruSa without reaping any reward for herself.
Thus it is nature who can be said to "purpose" *in a sense*, and in the same
sense we can speak of nature's purpose (subjective genitive). On the other
hand, when we speak of the puruSa's purpose (puruSArtha) this must be
understood as a (sort of) objective genitive: not as purpose entertained by the
puruSa, but as purpose having the puruSa as object.
This is a misrepresentation! draSTR is certainly not meant to signify a judge
in the SK. In the "juridical" vein, the puruSa is more aptly styled sAkSin, a
mere witness with no deliberative implication whatsoever.
Even in SK 23 buddhi is adhyavasAya, so to speak, "in principle", i. e. in its
sAttvika form, characterized by jJAna etc. But surely, when buddhi is
overwhelmed by tamas, hence characterized by ajJAna and the rest, it
cannot be equated with adhyavaSaya in point of fact?
I did not mean to endorse Larson's previous equation of buddhi to will, but
only to suggest that it was at all possible because the notion of
adhyavasAya entails a principle of determination and fixation which is
common to both intellectual categorizing and volitional deliberation. It is
precisely on account of this common ground that GauDapAda can
understand this determination in terms of conceptualization: "this is a pot,
this is a cloth" ---and VAcaspatimizra, on the other hand, in terms of
deliberation: "this is to be done by me".
