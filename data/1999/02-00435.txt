Dear Mr. Manivannan
Thank you for the reply.
What does the Naancil Naadu means? Actually the word "Nan2" in
Nan2 tien1zhu1 and Nan2 Yin4du4 above was Chinese word for
"south".
I was just curious why someone would say that name of that area
should mean GuangMing = "Bright"?
Is there anything that is called La.Nka in that area except La.Nka-
DvIpa "Ceylon"? Is this word anyhow else associated with South
India, is it known in ancient Tamil literature? I read that Vajrabodhi
before going to Ceylon, SriVijaya and finaly China made pilgrimige
to la.Nka mountain, what could that be?
Sincerely
Petr Mares
