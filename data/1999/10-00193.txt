Gajin Nagao's reconstruction of the Mahayana Samgraha uses this
approach.  He had gathered together all the parallel passages from
works surviving in Sanskrit and then using his Sanskrit expertise
created his reconstruction.  One may wonder, of course, why bother --
what can be gained from this apart from possible lexicographical
benefits ?

Have you also collated all five existing Tibetan editions -- a sine
non qua for any serious textual work.  Citations in early translations
or mss will also be useful -- especially if they have not be "revised"
too efficiently.

Also, you might like to bear in mind that there IS an extant Sanskrit
copy of the Madhyamakaavataara held by the Chinese (stolen from
Tibet) -- but you have a cat's chance in hell of ever getting access
to it at present -- but perhaps if you are still young ....

Best wishes,
