I have elsewhere argued (Indian Alchemy: Soma in the Veda, Delhi, Munshiram
Manoharlal--in press) that Rigveda is an allegorical document, expounding
metallurgy, general and processing of electrum from a pyrite ore--ma_ks.ika_,
in particular, as the bronze-age evolved. 'Indra' is relatable to 'indha' or
fire-wood. The weapon of Indra is 'vajra', which is a gum-resin. Acacia
Catechu (called khadira in RV. iii.53.19) is a hard wood, the resin of which
is also used in ayurveda; it is also called khayar, terra japonica. The
phrase, khadira-van.ika in Pali  (Lalitavistara) is a clear indication of its
commercial importance.

It will be interesting to trace the early textual references which led to the
interpretation of khadira as an attribute of Indra in lexicons.
