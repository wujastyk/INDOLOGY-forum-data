When did the gods become literate? Was: Are the gods literate
etc.
Quite correct, but instead of the early 20th say early 19th (Hodgson,
Burnouf et al.). The Sanskrit texts of Mahayana were then only known from
Nepal and Mahayana in general from Tibet, Mongolia, China and Japan, while
Pali texts and Theravada remained in Sri Lanka and South East Asia.
