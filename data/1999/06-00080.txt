Q : Research on Marathas in TN
Sorry for the mistake, I was refering to the bhatta's
below
bhaTTojI dIkshita, the great grammarian scholar from the north was a
disciple of appayya dIkshita. bhaTTojI's brother, rangojI bhaTTa, wrote
advaita works such as advaitacintAmaNi and attacked the dvaita school
of AnandatIrtha in his madhva-siddhAnta-bhanjanI. bhaTTojI wrote
advaitakaustubha, a dIpana on nRsimhASrama's tattvaviveka, and the
madhvamata-vidhvamsana against dvaita.
