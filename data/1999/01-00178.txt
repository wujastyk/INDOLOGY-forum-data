 Whatever has happened of Swami Aghehananda Bharathi,an Austrian by birth
and who put down his life story in a book <OCHRE ROBE> and who later
Syracuse Univ.?The last i heared /read about him was in an article
Illustrated Weekly some years back.

Perhaps List subscribers would have more information on him.
