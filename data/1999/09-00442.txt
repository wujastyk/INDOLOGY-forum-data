Continuing the review of Passions of the Tongue
There are a bunch of Tamil verbs involving "Aytam" to satisfy your
requirement:
[H = Aytam which is aspirated ]
veHku = to desire/ to covet
eHku = to soften
aHku = to shrink
kaHRu = to darken
Note that the sequence "Hku" is pronouced as  "hu".
See the first few chapters of tolkAppiyam on Tamil phonology for the rules
on such sequences (H followed by stops).
See the above list of words which are pretty much out of currency.
pal + tuLi = paHRuLi
pal + toDi = paHRoDi etc.
