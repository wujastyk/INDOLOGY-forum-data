Pronunciation of word final "a" in sanskrit
What is pronounced as "rAm" from a Hindi text is written identically
in a Sanskrit text though it is read as "rAma" in Sanskrit.
This general rule is true, say, for the case of "kannaD" while
reading in Hindi  whereas it is "kannaDa" in Sanskrit
as fas as Nagari writing goes.
Does this explain why word-final "a"s are cut out in
Hindi?
