Q: KannaDa vacana
A. K. Ramanujan (Speaking of 'Siva, Penguin classics)
translates MallikArjuna occuring in Mahadevi Akka's poems
as "Lord white as Jasmine".
Is there a Kannada tradition of interpreting mallikArjuna
this way? In other words, is there a text that explicitly
calls as Izvara as Lord white as jasmine?
Are there any KannaDa/Telugu/Sanskrit temple legends
saying Izvara is like jasmine flower while bhramarAbA
is encircling Him like a honey bee?
For example, in Sivanandalahari 50, Sankara compares
'Siva to jasmine.
Thanks. A mallikA bouquet!
Regards
N. Ganesan
