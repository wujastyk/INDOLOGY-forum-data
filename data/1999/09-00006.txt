Data on "Hindutva" sites
   I will support Vishal Agarwal's plea to "mainstream" indologists that
they should not dismiss data or information relevant to indology merely
because it also appears on so-called "hindutva" sites. Will they, for
instance, dismiss work of Barbara S. Miller simply because she
misinterpreted one painting?(cf Fred Smith's post of August 31 on the
subject of "A question for RISA and Indology).
