Is it?  I'm not sure.  That would seem to presuppose that
`apaurushheyatva' is a concept invented by Vedanta (which cannot be so
because we know of earlier references).  Also, the Vedas themselves
partition texts into `jAta+vedAH' on many occasions; the `jAta' or "born"
texts, i.e., the authored ones, are to be treated differently, as a class,
than the "Vedic" ones; the study of language as relating to the latter
cannot, on this account, be the same as that relating to the former.  Of
course, the whole `jAtavedAH' split may be bogus, a clever fraud, etc.,
but that is not in evidence -- only in the case of the Vedas does one have
to take recourse to nirukta and other devices, and no one, as a rule, has
ever had a complete handle on them, as they themselves proclaim.
