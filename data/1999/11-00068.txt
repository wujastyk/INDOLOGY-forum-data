Does anyone know where PD Ouspensky got the idea for
>his recurrence novel, The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin?  Was it Nietzsche?
>Or was Ouspensky using ideas picked up during his Indian travels?


Both but most particularly from his Indian travels. Although
published after his decisive meeting with Gurdjieff ( 1915 ),
the book was conceived before and has a bit of his transmigration
theory, put forward briefly in his Fragments of an Unknown Teaching.
