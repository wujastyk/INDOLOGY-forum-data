<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>Dear Janma,

I am in Switzerland. Nice to hear from Bali! Here are some books which
might interest you:

R.C.Majumdar, Hindu Colonies in the Far East, 2nd. ed. Calcutta:Firma
K.L. Mukhyopadhyay, 1963; H.G.Q.Wales, Towards Angkor; idem. Making of
Greater India, London, 1951.


The Visnusahasranama  is available in many different editions. You
might find the following useful: S.V.Rama Sastri,
Visnu-Sahasranamastotra with Sanmkara's commentary, Madras 1931; R.Rama
Sastry, Visnusahasranama (2 vols )Mysore, 1960-61.


If you would like to switch over  sometimes to Sivasahasranama, there
is a new book by a Jesuit priest from Pune: Subhash Anand, Siva's
Thopusans names, Intercultural Publications, New Delhi, 1998.


Wish you a good reading. 

A. Nayak.






<excerpt>Dear people,

</excerpt><fontfamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>I am 

<excerpt>a new subscriber to this list, or in fact to any list. I live
in Bali and I am interested in understanding the roots of the Hindu
culture here. I also lived in India for several years though mainly in
Bengal. I have heard that the first traders that bought Hinduisim to
Indonesia were from Gujarat. Does anybody know anything about the roots
of Hinduisim in Java and Bali?

Also I am looking for a transliteration of the One Thousand Names of
Visnu (sahasra nama) if anybody knows of where I can find one.
