Dear Colleague:

I am pleased to announce the release of the recently completed digital
index of the Bukkyogo daijiten (by Nakamura Hajime). The file can be
downloaded in ZIP format from the category "Muller's Electronic CJK
Texts" at <http://www.human.toyogakuen-u.ac.jp/~acmuller/index.html>.

Due to mapping errors in the JIS-to-Big5 conversion tables which can
cause some problems for those using the data in a Chinese environment, I
have made two versions of the file: one Japanese-oriented and one
Chinese-oriented.
I am sorry that I am not familiar enough with JIS-KSC mapping errors to
have made a third file for Korean platform usage.

Please be sure to take a look at the README file for accreditation,
caveats, encoding issues, etc.

May the load of your work be lightened! (Or be made heavier, whichever
you like).

Regards,

Charles Muller
Toyo Gakuen University
