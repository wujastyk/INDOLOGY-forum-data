Is Savitri Devi another Blavatsky? ("The secret doctrine"). With reference to C. G. Jung, a Harvard professor's book,
The Aryan Christ, The secret life of Carl Jung by Richard Noll (Random house, 1997) is a useful read for Indologists.
Does anybody know of folks/works working on the European appropriation of theAryan racist ideal in 19th century and the employment of the Aryan ideal and  Sanskrit by Nazi-like politicians later.
