Tucci volumes reprinted
It has come to my attention that Giuseppe Tucci's great work "Tibetan
Painted Scrolls" is about to be reprinted, in three vols. Many of the
original b/w repros of thangkas will now appear in color as the small
Bangkok-based publisher has secured many color slides from the current
owners.
