Even before Sri Aurbindo, Swami Dayanda (1824-1883)  rejected the AIT.
Reference his writings. Early Arya Samaj authors follow the Svami's lead and
the trend continues to this day.

Thank you Allen! This was very useful. Aurobindo is apparently one of the
first to reject the Aryan Invasion Theory, so this goes into my paper!
