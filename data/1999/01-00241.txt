request for reading literature.
When the etymology of
1) bElUru < Cognate with Tamil vEL +  Ta. Ur       and
2) belagaum < Cognate with Ta. veLa + Skt. grAma
was discussed, the following discussion was
posted in Indology. One of the greatest Sangam poets,
Kapilar sings this poem. This gist was written from memory.
 NaccinArkkiniyar is the medieval commentator.
When I find AbhidAna chintAmaNi, I will post the entry on Tamil
there.
