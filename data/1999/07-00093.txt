Gatekeeper gods; Skanda in Buddhism
Ganesha and Karttikeya in the said Elephanta cave are found flanking the
seven mothers, and are on the same wall. It is not a shrine to the mothers
with the two sons as door-keepers. The entire sculpture seems to have been
conceived as one whole. In many other sculptures of the seven mothers, the
two sons are also depicted, the reason being to highlight the benign nature
of the mothers instead of the ferocious. This is a different function than
that of gatekeepers.
