The word is a mnemonic and it gives all the
combinations of guru and laghu syllables. Let laghu be
0 and guru be 1, then we get

0111010001

and in combinations of 3 you are able to count all triplets.
It is supposed to  have been used in the medieval (or perhaps
ancient) times to remember all triple meters.

Would you know a textual reference to this mnemonic? And
could you pass this note on to someone who would? I would
be willing to exchange reliable information with a copy
of my new book.
