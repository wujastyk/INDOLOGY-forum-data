The word could have made its way into Turkic very long ago. The question

one of too many coincidences. The bull is still very important among the
Parsis, and the cow is still important in the Hindi religion. There is
a semantic and phonological match. "wealth" could easily come from "god"
in the form of "blessed with goods". The bull could easily be
transformed
into a symbol of fertility even for crops in primitive agricultural
societies
and obviously would be important for pastoral communities especially if
they were cow-herders.
It could have easily been borrowed back or even back and forth. We still
don't know if many of the cognate words in IE are mostly diffusion back
and forth between languages or come from the earliest *PIE protoform.
