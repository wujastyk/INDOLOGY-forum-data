   What made me wonder if kan2n2al is coming from 'karunal'
is the phrases "kan2n2am kaREl" and "kan2n2am kariya".
Does the "kan2n2am" contain "karu" and an "am" cAriyai??

In the TiruJan2acampantar poem where *karu nal paravai
kamaz kAzi" occurs, a question is: Why would the sea
issue *fragrance*?

Note in the same decad where karunal paravai occurs
talks of "garden/field" in 5 poems (kaTi Ar pozil,
kaLi Ar pozil, kan2i Ar pozil, karu Ar pozil,
kamazntAr pozil) and talks of sea in 4 poems
(kaTal Ar puTai cUz, karai Ar pun2al, curakkum pun2al,
kalam Ar kaTal).

I have put "curakkum pun2al" as referring to the sea.
However: Does "curakkum pun2al" refer actually to the sea? Or,
it can mean just any water seepage, wells, etc.,??
How does VMS translate "curakkum pun2al cUz taru kAzi"?

The verb, "kamaz" -'to issue fragrant smell' occurs
in the very next poem of "karunal paravai **kamaz** taru kAzi"
as "kamazntAr **pozil**" where 'kamaz' is clearly with respect to
a "garden".
