In a book titled PROTO-HISTORIC POTTERY OF INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION,
the author, Sudha Satyawadi states:

"As regards the Indus Script, Mr. Verma of Bihar (Times of India, July 5,
1992) has done pioneering work.  He says that the Indus script is still
alive, and finds frequent mention in the languages of the santhal (tribal of
Bihar) particularly in their festivals and prayers.

Mr. Verma claims to be able to decipher all the intact Mohenjodaro
inscriptions. The words include Sanskrit, Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian,
though many words were unfamiliar to him.  Now the traces of the migration
from the Indus Valley to the other present settlement in South Bihar and
archaeological evidence of food habits of the period have been found in
several places, but have still to be unearthed in the area inhabited by the
santhal."

Do any of you have any further insight regarding the statements above in
terms of archaeological evidence in favor of them or opposing them?  Any
references?

Thank you for your kind attention.
