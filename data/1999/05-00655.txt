That is what I was wondering: Did not Balaji Hebbar write that
Sinhalese make use of word-final "a" and this adds to a
sweet lilting sound to the speech? Exactly like when Tamil
Brahmanas recite the ancient vedas!

All of us can make use of "a" at the end of the
word, Karnataka like Kannadigas do. Why, Karnatak?
