the following:  "From whatever points of view the Buddhist systems are
tested with regard to their plausibility, they cave in on all sides, like
the walls of a well dug in sandy soil.  [Buddhist philosophy] has, in fact,
no foundation whatever to rest upon, and thus it is foolish to adopt it as a
guide in the practical concerns of life.  Moreover, the Buddha,  by
presenting three mutually contradictory systems of philosophy -- teaching
respectively the reality of the external world, the reality of
consciousness-only, and general emptiness -- has himself made it clear
either that he was a man given to making incoherent assertions, or else that
hatred of all beings moved him to propound absurd doctrines that would
thoroughly confuse all who might take him seriously.  Thus . . . , the
Buddha?s doctrine must be entirely disregarded  by  all  those  who  have  a
regard  for  their  own  happiness."

When Shamkara focuses his analytical and critical dialectic on his
philosophical opponents, he can be very tough!
