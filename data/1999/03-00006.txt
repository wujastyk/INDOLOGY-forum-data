Subject: Advaita-Chandran (edress problem)
Message-ID: <161227047120.23782.5214915453131099518.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have gone twice to

<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/dhirc/1994-95seminars.html>

and attempted then to go to

"Twists and Turns in the Transition from Veda to Vedanta",

but each time I have received a notice that the edress for the
latter is "invalid."

Yours truly,

John
