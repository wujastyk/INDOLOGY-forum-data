Advaita-Chandran (edress problem)
I have gone twice to
<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/dhirc/1994-95seminars.html>
and attempted then to go to
"Twists and Turns in the Transition from Veda to Vedanta",
but each time I have received a notice that the edress for the
latter is "invalid."
Yours truly,
John
