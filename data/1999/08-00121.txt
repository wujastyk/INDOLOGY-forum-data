Dear Mr. Madhuresan,
Appropos your earlier posting below. could you list some (5 would be
sufficient) contradictions in Dr. Frawley's

Thank you in advance,

Dear Toke,
Don't take David Frawley seriously. Most of his writings
is garbage and with several contradictions, though he has
good support from the Hindutva folks. This will become clear
as you spend years studying old India.
Best wishes,
SM
