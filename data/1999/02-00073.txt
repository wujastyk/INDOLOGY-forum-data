Use of avagraha
Some western editions of Sanskrit texts occasionally use avagraha (or
double avagraha where appropriate) to indicate the assimilation of a
final a or A into a preceeding a or A.  In examining nine western
editions of the Bhagavad Geeta, it was seen that eight of them did this,
but none were self-consistent (the same word combinations sometimes
having an avagraha inserted and sometimes not).  Is this a modern or
western edition use of avagraha?  Is it more correct not to use avagraha
in this manner?
Any guidelines from professional Sanskritists would be greatly
appreciated.
Thank you,
