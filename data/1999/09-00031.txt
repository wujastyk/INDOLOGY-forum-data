ATI, cant vs rant.
A theoretical observation on ARYAN ORIGIN hypothesis.
WHAT IS SO OBJECTIONABLE IN exploring the possibility of INDO-EUROPEAN PRECLASSICAL
CULTURE AS A MOVEMENT BORN AND FLOWERING OUT OF CRISS-CROSS INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS AND
TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING LINGUISTIC) IN A REGION OVER A PERIOD RATHER THAN A HARPING UPON A
SINGLE LINE MOVEMENT OF A NORTHEN RACE  PUSHING SOUTH THE MINOAN, HARAPPAN (DRAVIDA?)
CULTURES INTO OBLIVION OR SUBMISSION ?
EVIDENTIALLY LITTLE SURVIVES IN THE "ARYAN HOME" WHEREVER IT MAY HAVE BEEN
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND EVERTHING AS HERITAGE OR LIVING CULTURE IS FOUND IN THE "OVERPOWERED"
REGIONS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BASIC PROBLEMS ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE "ARYANS" AS A
RACE AND THEIR HOME.
THE PROBLEM TO RECONSIDER IS THE PARADIGM OF NORTH TO SOUTH LINE OF CONQUEST. IS IT SO
SANCROSANT AND COULD THEIR HAVE BEEN NO REACTIVE SOUTH TO NORTH CURRENTS ALSO. THE
DEPENDENCE OF PRE-CLASSICAL GREECE ON EGYPT (UNDERPLAYED EVEN NOW) IS A GLARING EXAMPLE.
THE TRANSFER OF AURVEDIC CONCEPTS TO SHAPE THE HIPPOKRATIC IDEAS IS ANOTHER.
