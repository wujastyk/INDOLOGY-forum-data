The mother of all debates
I sympathize with your concerns, and I hope you will sympathize similarly
with my concerns about the nasty turn which some of the debate has taken
recently, especially from some of the "indigenists".
What is important to note is that much of the "indigenist" argumentation
addresses antiquated western models concerning the AIT question and that
western and Indian scholars who still find the AI theory better established
do not do so for racist, nationalist, or imperialist motives.  As one of
the recent members of the debate correctly pointed out, western scholars
have nothing to lose or to gain politically by adopting any of the rival
theories, since for better or worse, most ordinary western people,
including the politicians, don't give a hoot.  The concern of these
scholars, therefore, is not whether their findings support or damage
particular political ideologies, but rather a search for the admittedly
quite elusive truth.
To set the record straight as far as I am concerned, and I'm sure many of
my colleagues as well:  19th- and early 20th-century Indology is full of
racist and imperialist assumptions that reflect the spirit of its time and
which is painfully embarrassing to most of us.  Current approaches to the
AIT controversy, in most cases, do not subscribe to these assumptions.  It
is therefore not particularly helpful when AIT opponents attempt to
discredit current AIT proponents by associating them, directly or
indirectly, with these earlier and now thoroughly discredited assumptions.
I concede that it is similarly unhelpful when AIT proponents associate
their opponents with the militant, communalist elements in the Sangh
Parivar.
A number of recent participants in the debate, including Zydenbos and Elst,
have correctly pointed out that, to use my own words, even racists and
communalists may have important contributions to make to scholarship,
however much we may disagree with their political views.  In scholarship it
doesn't matter that Hitler may have been pro-AIT and that communalists may
be anti-AIT.  What should matter is the evidence -- which unfortunately
tends to be much less clear and unambiguous than we would like it to be --
and the strength of the arguments based on that evidence.
I would very much hope that those participating in the discussion on this
list will find it possible in their hearts to focus on this scholarly side
of the debate and to cease from innuendo, slander, and downright nastiness.
If we can do this, I would hope that Fosse will return to the list; if we
can't, I'm afraid many others will follow his example.
