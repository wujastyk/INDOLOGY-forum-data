A text dealing with Ayurveda
[In reply to comments from Paolo Magnone]
Dear Paolo,
the issues concerned are admittedly rather complex, and the current policy
of the list does not favour a lengthy discussion. Still I will try to
suggest an alternative approach to some of the points you mentioned.
Both terms imply impartiality, neutrality and inactivity. (There *is* an
alternative interpretation, but I will not pursue it here.) I think it is
fair to infer that the puruSa is without passion (or even without emotion?
but cf. SK55: duHkhaM prApnoti puruSaH); so probably the locus of (some)
emotions might be somewhere in the antaHkaraNa. It does not follow that the
locus of volition is not the puruSa.
The standard sAMkhya examples of the inactive king (and his minister), or
the cripple (and the blind) show: active as exerting specific influence, but
incapable of independent locomotion.
But about gauDapAda's position you are doubtless right: there the guNas
decide. Still I think that in the earlier commentaries the puruSa is not yet
kUTastha, absolutely unchanging. Or do you have any comments thereon?
Clearly, SK 23.: adhyavasAyo buddhir; but adhyavasAya is a difficult term,
meaning here probably grasping, understanding, judgement (not decision, as
in the gauDapAda passage you quoted ad SK 20). Cf. the analysis in
Oberhammer et al. (Terminologie der fr?hen philosophischen Scholastik in
Indien, Band 1, s. 29): "Es ist das sAMkhya, das (jedenfalls seit
IzvarakRSNa) den *adhyavasAya* im strikt technischen Sinne nur f?r dieses
dem Erkennen eigene Erfassen des Gegenstandes als das, was er ist,
verwendet"
They imply the involvement of the puruSas; i.e., the puruSa initiates the
actions, and it is the cause of the different births and deaths of the
individuals. The latter seems to suggest that karman in a way belongs to the
puruSa, which is logical if he willed the actions, so he was responsible for
them.
Thank you very much for your kind comments,
Ferenc
