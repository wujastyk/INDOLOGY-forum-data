'Siva Nandi
Dear Ganesan,
There is a Somaskanda bronze (probably Nolamba pd) from
Bhoganandisvara temple, Nandi (near Bangalore).  Also Dharmapuri
(TN) Mallikarjuna complex I have seen Somaskanda reliefs.
Please see my book for images, esp of various Natesas.
At the moment I can't think of more northern images, but that could
only be my faulty memory, not indication that they don't exist.
I assume you have seen Sivaramamurti's _Nataraja in Art_
