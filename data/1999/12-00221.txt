This is alledged sometimes, and one can find chess sets in which the rook
is shaped like an elephant, but in caturanga, it was a chariot.

The serious histories of chess I have read that caturanga elephant ->
bishop. The lines indicating the tusks were reinterpreted as a bishop's
miter in Europe, hence the name.
