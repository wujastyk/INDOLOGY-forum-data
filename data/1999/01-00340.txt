Dear Ganesan,

You provide a great service by
reminding people that "Indology"
can't be just "North Indiology".
So I hate to pick on you.  But...

You mean modern languages in India are
less funded than classical languages?
E.g., Sanskrit/Persian/Arabic are better funded
than Tamil or Hindi?  I doubt it.  Do you have
some numbers?

At last -- one specific concrete statement!
But is it true?  Really, does the UGC allocate
no funds for Tamil, Hindi,...?  All their
cash goes into Sanskrit/Arabic/Persian?

Regards,


Raja.
