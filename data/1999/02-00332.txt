Malaya 5th. cent corrected
<<<
it is more likely to have been derived from campai/caNpu/campu
meaning "elephant grass". campai also means "luxuriant growth".
In other words campA could be a Sanskritized version of Tamil campai. In
that case campA/campApati as a place can refer to the ancient
 cOzar  capital.
  I think caNpai is the name of ciirkAzi. The tevaram saint
Jaanacampantar born at ciirkAzi calls the town that way.
