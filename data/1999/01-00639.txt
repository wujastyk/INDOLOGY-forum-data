Temat:  [q] Seeking information on "hiraNyagarbha" ceremony

Could someone please help me with references to "hiraNyagarbha" ceremony,
where the rulers were inserted into a large womb-like gold vessel,
subsequently emerged "reborn," and thus became possessed of _kshatriya_
status.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,                        --Sreenivas

There is something similar in the pancaratra samhita texts for ex. in the
Padma samhita chapter 20th - hiranyagarbhaviddhi (in caryapada) and also in
the Parama samhita chapter 17th - isvara, but here in the context of the
initiation ceremony. Maybe it is worth checking.
