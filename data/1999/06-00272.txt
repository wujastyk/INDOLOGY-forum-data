Dear David,

I have the following available on CD, both in Devanagari and in 8-bit
Transliteration. The license fee is $100 for single user including some very
nice true type fonts. If you get a more extensive set of fonts you also get
first 80 chapters of Caraka both for total of $5 extra. There is $5 charge
for shipping and handling. These were all typed in independently of other
texts you may have seen on the web. They are directly as printed, with no
"editing."

sincerely,

Claude Setzer  cssetzer at mum.edu
