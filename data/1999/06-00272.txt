Dear David,
I have the following available on CD, both in Devanagari and in 8-bit
Transliteration. The license fee is $100 for single user including some very
nice true type fonts. If you get a more extensive set of fonts you also get
first 80 chapters of Caraka both for total of $5 extra. There is $5 charge
for shipping and handling. These were all typed in independently of other
texts you may have seen on the web. They are directly as printed, with no
"editing."
sincerely,
