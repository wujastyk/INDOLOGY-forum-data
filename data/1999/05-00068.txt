Gentoo Studies
Good idea ! So, if one classifies the study of Indology, not as per
subject matter, but as per the racial origins of the investigators, then -
22nd century Oxford dictionary -
" GENTOO Studies - The study of India conducted by Europeans, since Gentoo
is an Anglo-Indian and Portuguese word for pagan Indians, being a
corruption of proper English `Gentile'."
" HINDOO (or Hindu) Studies - The study of India conducted by Arabs, since
Hindu is a corruption of the Arabic `Hindwi'."
So - World Journal of Hindu Studies : Journal published by Arabs on
India (!). Also -
" ARYA Studies - Indology conducted by Aryans (ie. Indo-Aryans, not the
`Mleccha' Europeans) in Sanskrit and on Sanskrit."
" DASYOO Studies - The study of Sudras and Dravidians conducted by Aryas."
" SUDROLOGY & DRAVIDOLOGY - The study by Dravidians and other Sudras on
Sudra culture."
What would one call the study of Aryans conducted by Dravidians ?
