The Sinhalese ruling class, at least, came from North India and spoke
the same language as the North Indian peoples.
It is.
Perhaps he thought of the Colas and Paa.n.diyas as foreigners in a

Perhaps there was no royal invitation from there.
Perhaps he did send others of his presumed hundreds of sons but they
are not recorded because the Buddhist literature from those areas is
lost or because they were not as successful.
Perhaps the legend of Mahinda is a later invention to account for the
success of Buddhism on the island.
