Subject: Announcement -- Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project's website (fwd)


The British Library / University of Washington Early Buddhist Manuscripts
Project was founded in September 1996 in order to promote the study,
editing, and publication of a unique collection of fifty-seven fragments
of Buddhist manuscripts on birch bark scrolls, written in the Kharosthi
script and the Gandhari (Prakrit) language that were acquired by the
British Library in 1994. The manuscripts date from, most likely, the first
century A.D., and as such are the oldest surviving Buddhist texts, which
promise to provide unprecedented insights into the early history of
Buddhism in north India and in central and east Asia.

For more information on this project and its personnel, publications and
presentations please view its recently constructed home page at:
