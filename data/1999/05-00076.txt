>?From what I hear, Indian scholars in India tend to spend most of their time
reading texts, rather than study secondary literature. I believe it is the
other way around in the West. But in defence of Western scholars, I would like
to point out that the university system forces them to publish far more
literature that is really needed. If they were to cut their production in half
while doubling the quality, everybody would be better served. As for
trendyness, I believe this has always been the case one way or the other, in
all fields of scholarship. It is an evil, but I suspect that it is
unavoidable.

The India that Gonda studied had been dead for at least a 1000 years. For many
Western scholars, the study of Sanskrit resembles the study of Greek and
Latin, both of which cultures that are comfortably out of the way and
therefore a place where your soul can rest while your mind works.

Again, I concur. But I am afraid that even within Western academia (as indeed
elsewhere), followers of different trends tend to regard each other as quite
worthless. It seems to be in the nature of things. :-)
