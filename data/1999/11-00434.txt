Hypertext Sanskrit Dictionary released
Namaste.
I released today the current version of my sanskrit-french dictionary.
It is available in ps and pdf formats, as previously, but this time there
is also an experimental HTML version, fully indexed for easy browsing.
Everything is downloadable from my indology web page, at URL
        http://pauillac.inria.fr/~huet/SKT/indo.html
where you can find instructions.
Enjoy!
Comments and corrections appreciated, as usual
