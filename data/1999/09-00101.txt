Help with tirukkayilAya JAn2a ulA
Dear Indologists,
Does anybody know if tirukkayilAya JAn2a ulA of the 11th tirumuRai of the
Tamil zaiva canon is available online somewhere? If not, does anybody have
access to that text? I need to check some thing in the text. You can write to
me offline if you like. Thanks in advance.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
