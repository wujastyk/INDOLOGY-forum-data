==========
I am researching an Indic Manuscript, made of bamboo, and need
assistance in identifying it. The script is related to Devanagari,
possibly Nandinagari. Scholars from all corners have been unable to
identify the language. All that is known about it so far, including
scholar comments, is listed at the web page below, courtesy of Columbia
University. Any and all observations and comments about this mss are
most welcome, and can be sent to this e-mail address, which can also be
accessed through the web page. Please help us! Thank you.
