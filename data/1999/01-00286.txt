Dear indology listers,

IAHR (International Association for the History of Religions) holds its
18th quinquennial world congress in Durban, South Africa, 5-12 August
2000. A symposium on the ancient Upanishads is now being organized. Its
title is

THE UPANISHADS - FOCUS AND PERSPECTIVES

The intention of the symposium is to create a dialogue among scholars
working on the Upanishads from different disciplines, thereby bringing
the knowledge of these texts up to date. Papers may address the
Upanishads from the angles of history, society, philosophy, language,
religion, history of reception, body and gender or any other subject
relevant to the Upanishads or their context.

The symposium is still open. For further information (participants,
deadlines, details of registration), please contact the convenor

Dr Mikael Aktor,
Department of the Study of Religion,
University of Aarhus, Main Building,
DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.
