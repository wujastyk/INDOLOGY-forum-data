Concept of Mukti and Shankaracharya
That's a rendering of part of BRAHMASUTRA BHASHYA, Adhyaya II, Pada 2,
Section 31, the last paragraph of which reads as follows:
"We have now refuted both the Buddhist Realists, who maintain the
(momentary) reality of the external world, and the Buddhist Idealists, who
claim that only consciousness exists.  The third variety of Buddhist
philosophy (Madhyamaka Voidism), i.e., the view that everything is empty
(i.e., that absolutely nothing exists),  is contradicted by all the
recognized means of knowledge [perception, inference, the verbal testimony
of the Scriptures, etc.] and therefore requires no special refutation.  The
reality of the phenomenal world is guaranteed by all the means of knowledge.
Its existence cannot be denied without a convincing proof of its
non-existence (or 'emptiness'), for a conclusion arrived at on the basis of
the standard means of knowledge must be accepted in the absence of a
convincing argument to the contrary."
