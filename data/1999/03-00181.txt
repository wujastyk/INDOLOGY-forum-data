Has anybody studied sanskrit in India? I want to go there this summer for a
month and I am looking for addresses of universities, language schools or
even competent private teachers who offer summer courses (4 weeks or so) in
sanskrit. Since I have already studied sanskrit for a year, I am not a
complete beginner.  I'd be most grateful if anybody could help me. Thank
you very much Heike Boudalfa
