misc about the summer conference
Dear Toru,
How are you?  I'm starting to think of details of the summer visit to
Lausanne. Any advice on where I might stay without selling my son into
slavery to pay for it?
I tried to read the hotel thing from the website, but I cannot open it --
my message is "does not start with %pdf..."  or something like that.
Your kind advice most urgently sought.
PS:  I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you can catching up on
the years we haven't talked!
warmest, jonathan
