The Seventh Impression 1993 edition Pb. ISBN 81-7058-191-5,
Bd. ISBN 81-7058-192-3 has the following information
printed on the page just before the table of contents. I quote.

"First published in the monthly review Arya between
August 1914 and January 1920."

This edition also contains the chapter  "Interpretation of the Veda"
with the editorial note that this is a letter published in 'The Hindu
(Madras) on August 27, 1914. And a chapter "The Origins of Aryan Speech"
with the editorial note: "A draft of a chapter (the only one written) on
'The Origins of Aryan Speech', found among the MSS. of Sri Aurobindo, has
been appended here."

Yours,

Harry Spier
