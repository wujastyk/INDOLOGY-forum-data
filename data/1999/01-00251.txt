Mahacina does not necessarily refer to China.  However, I don't agree
with your theories regarding texts.  We don't even know if Tantra
practices were originally written or oral traditions. We don't have
Saivite texts from IVC, but there is good reason to believe a prototype
of some of the main forms of Siva came from that culture.

And the idea of Tantric influences from Mahacina is not what I say, but
what the Tantric texts themselves say.
