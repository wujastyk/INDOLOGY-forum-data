Dear Dominik,

 All India Roman (AIR) script will serve India best.

 May be I was not clear enough. I am not talking of
 Indic Languages, IA or Dravidian or Munda or Tibeto-Burman.

 The incoming ISO standard of transliteration of All Indian
 languages will be great.

 I wrote the original after browsing through a new book
 explaining why the Chinese script must go and NOT the language:
 Wm. C. Hannas, Asia's orthographic dilemma, Hawaii, 1997.

 Are there any reasons why India cannot make a switchover
 to AIR script?

 Yours
 Chris
