pataJjali and pANini myths
Dear List Members,
The results of my investigation into the myths linking (1) pataJjali and
AdizESa and (2) pANini and zivasUtras (following M. M. Deshpande's important
earlier article in JAOS, 1997) are presented at the Indology web site with
the following address. I thank Dominik for mounting this at the Indology web
site.

In summary, the naTarAja cult at Chidambaram in competition with the
dakSiNAmURti cult at Pandyan Madurai has been the source of the myths linking
pataJjali with zeSa and pANini receiving the basis of his grammar from ziva.
This investigation also revealed that Abhinavagupta of Kashmir was familiar
with some of the traditions prevailing at the naTarAja temple at Chidambaram
and he used them in his works.
The findings underscore the importance of the use of Tamil materials for
arriving at a proper understanding of some ancient Indian cultural elements
and the need for collaboration between Sanskrit and Tamil scholars.
Comments are welcome.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
