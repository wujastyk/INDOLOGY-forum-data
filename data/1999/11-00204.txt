        To this I have a very simple comment: we identify objects not by their
qualities and attributes alone (as You try to do in Your example), but
rather by their APPLICATION. Your example: a golden ring. I call it a ring,
because I use it as a ring and not as a pencil. Qualities (like golden,
round, etc.) are a secondary level, meant to specify more clealy what kind
of ring is it. The primary level is viniyoga - application, function. It's
quite simple to understand, isn't it? As soon as I tell to someone about the
application of an object one immediately understands what is being spoken
about.

Your ever well-wisher,
Sergei Schmalz.
