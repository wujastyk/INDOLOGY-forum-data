Dear list members,

I recently posted the query below to RISA-L, with no response whatsoever; I
hope to have better luck on this list. Apologies to those who have seen the
post already.

Here is a question for any visishtadvaita experts in our ranks: while
reading van Buitenen's translation of Ramanuja's Vedarthasamgraha just now,
I was somewhat surprised by the following note (p. 186, n. 36):

"jnanasvarupamityetavannirdesyam cannot be taken to mean that the atman *is*
pure knowledge, but that the knowledge characteristic for the atman is a
svarupanirupanadharma 'an attribute describing the proper form' ... the
tenet that jnana is an attribute, not the essence, is fundamental to R.'s
doctrine."
