Folks,
 this is to correct an indverdant mistake on my post yesterday
regarding competing histories of ancient India.
 I meant to refer to the scientist/biologist Edward O. Wilson and his
work "Consilience - The Unity of Knowledge", and not Edmund Wilson ,
the literary figure.
Regards to all,
J.B. Sharma
