Book review: Indus Age- the Writing System by Gregory              L.Possehl.
 What is a Himalayan self-realized sage? Or, the usual Orientalism
working here to create something exotic in Shangri-Las compared to NY?
I thought self-realization is 'getting drunk' too. Self-realized sages
in Himalayas as far as my interviews go, are drunk with God,
but more often, they like soma, opium, ganja and the like.
