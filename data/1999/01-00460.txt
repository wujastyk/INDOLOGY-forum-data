The conversion issue
Very well put. Not only do I agree 100%, but I admire and envy the
degree of maturity that Mr. Misra has exhibited in his post.
The anti-Indians (and there are some Indians amongst them) on this
list are puzzling to me. I fail to understand why they would devote so
much of their (and other peoples) time discussing, sermonizing and
handing out harangues on a system and a culture that they obviously
have such little respect for. 
You won't find me discussing/dissing American marriages, for
instance. :-)

predominantly Christian West has raised a hue and cry about thousands and millions of people becoming Buddhists, Baha'is, Hindus, etc. etc. -- and this is how it should be.
here, also from ethnic groups with no history of 'Hinduism' in them, there cannot be any question of 're-conversion' there either.
