sAri, the Indian dress
It is natural that Indians use zATI(tamil kATikam) to cover the head
for protection from the hot tropical sun. May not be from Sudan,
Greece, Rome or Middle East. Also, ta. mukkATu = veil comes from the
verb pair: mukku(to immerse, to cover)/muGku(to be immersed/to
be covered). Mother goddesses (eg., Jain ambikA) in ancient sculpture,
Kishangarh/Kangra pgs., modern paintings of Sankara, Vallalaar
have the veil.
