Jamshid
I found something on the name Zarathustra.  David Frawley in his
book "Gods, Sages and Kings" writes (on page 223):
"The name of Zoroaster, the founder of the ancient Persian religion,
is traceable to Sanskrit Hari-dyut-astra, the beautiful light of the
star."
Any comments on this?
Sincerely,
