*And the idea of Tantric influences from Mahacina is not what I say,
* but what the Tantric texts themselves say.
  Dear Mr. Manansala,
  I would be thankful if you can cite certain quotes
  from tantras about Mahacina and tell me the approximate
  dates of the texts.
  Will buy those books & read them. Until then, I am
  rather skeptical.
  Thanks,
  N. Ganesan
