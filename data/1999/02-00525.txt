I am not interested in identifying the original location of potala(ka). But
the accusations made against Sarma show lack of civility. Corresponding to
PDr. *nal 'good', Old Telugu has naluwu 'beauty, etc.' (see DEDR 3610). A
Telugu Dictionary in 7 volumes called Suuryaraaya-aandhranighaNTuwu in vol.
4 gives nalla-wo as an exclamatory form meaning 'good, then'; -wo is -poo
used as a clitic. The forms meaning 'good' are obsolete in Modern Telugu.
But in early (pre-Classical) Telugu it is perfectly possible for nalla- to
occur as an adj. meaning 'good'. The word nalla meaning 'black' occurs also
in old as well as modern literature/language (derived from *na.l 'dark'DEDR
3621, although they listed it in 3613). nalupu (n.): nalla- adj. :: naluwu
(n.): nalla- adj. Retroflex /.l/ merged with alveolar lateral /l/ as early
as the 8th cent. AD. This homonomy could have been the basis for nalla-
'good' going out of use. But its existence is attested (see supra). I do not
think Sarma deserves Keith's virulent personal attack by name. Why would
Sarma mislead? What will he get out of it? It would be graceful if Keith
Williams tendered him an apology. Regards.
