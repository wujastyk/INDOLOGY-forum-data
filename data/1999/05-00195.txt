Santarasa and Abhinavagupta
Students of Indology,
I am interested in learning more about the
ontological, epistemological, and metaphysical
foundations of santarasa within Abhinavagupta's works
on pratyabhijna and tantrika.
Where might I dig for these roots?
Any comments on chronology would be welcomed as well.
(I am aware of K. C. Pandey's and Ingalls' sense of
order.)
a thousand thank you-s in advance,
Tim Lighthiser
