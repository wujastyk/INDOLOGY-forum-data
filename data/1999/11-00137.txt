When did the gods become literate?
There is an Aaryabhavasa.mkrantinaamamahaayaanasuutra edited
and translated by F. Tola and C. Dragonetti, which is reported to have
been given in Raajag.rha to an assembly of both Bhik.sus and
Bodhisattvas.
However, Jeffrey Hopkins gives it the name Bhaavasa.mkrantisuutra
(without the mahaayaana) and says that it is (at least partly)
"established also for the Hearer [S'raavaka] Schools".
I would be interested to know if this Suutra is found in the Paali
Canon.
Thank you,
Julio.
