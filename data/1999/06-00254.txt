The word Dayaananda has used is trivi.s.tapa. It means both 'heaven' and
'Tibet,' the latter being thought of as the location of heaven in
reconstructions that equate Meru with the Himalayas or certain parts of the
Himalayas. For Dayaananda, it might have meant the same thing whether one
said 'man was created in heaven' or 'man was created in Tibet.' In this
particular case, the difference of the mythological or religious from the
geographical might not have existed for him. -- ashok aklujkar
