Chinese Buddhist scholar prof. Ba1 Zhou4. For many years he is
certainly one of the most knowledgable Chinese expert on Buddhism in
Tang Dynasty. [...]
Abstract of the article called "Guan Yin and Asian Buddhism":
 In addition, during the sixth century the famous
Mount P'u-t'o shan (Potala) in China became a famous spot of
pilgrimage associated with Kuan yin.
 Thanks for providing the Buddhist's abstract.
 But is it established that Mount P'u-t'o shan was popular
 in SIXTH centry??
 My readings show it is later: 9th-10th century AD.
 Can you please check?
