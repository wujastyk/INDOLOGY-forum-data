Is this a genuine message?
Yup, it's genuine. Somebody on the list changed their mail address or the
address is no longer valid. So, provided you read Hungarian, the message
makes a lot of sense! Somebody is bouncing back an errant message.
The Indology list administrators can take the person off the list to prevent
this.
