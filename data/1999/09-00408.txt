Aryabhatt (Elder)
Kailash,
For a serious study of Indian astronomy you should looks at the writings of
David Pingree.  A good place to start would be:
"History of mathematical Astronomy in India," in Dictionary of Scientific
Biography, vols. 15-16:533-633.  Ed. by C.C. Gillispie.  New York: Charles
Scribner's Sons, 1981.  This is a reference work that should be easily
available.
For Aryabhata in particular, I would recommend the book: Aryabhatiya of
Aryabhata, critical edition with translation.  K.S. Shukla and K.V. Sarma.
New Delhi: Indian National Science Academy, 1976.
