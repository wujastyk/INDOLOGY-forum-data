Dakshinatya is generally considered a synonym for Dakshinapatha (ie. the
Deccan). It vaguely includes all peoples south of the Vindhyas. In
general, it would imply a Maharashtrian. This tract was Aryanized
comparatively early on, cf. the Satavahana Prakrit Maharashtri
inscriptions. Dravidians would not, in the technical sense, be included,
although these may have been on some occasions of the use of this word.
