Tibetan Origin of Tantrism and Siva

Maybe according to the theories of some Western scholars, but this is
hardly a universal view. The idea that the Nei Ching was embellished is
not based on empirical evidence.  We know that the text was mentioned
in very early works.  The version we have today was compiled in the
T'ang Dynasty.  But so what.  The Rgveda was preserved orally for
centuries, before being committed to written form, yet we see that is
used by AIT/AIM theories in the most liberal fashion to substantiate
their theories.
In Taoism and the I-Ching, Yin and Yang are still identified with the
creative forces and with the cycles of creation/destruction, life/death
associated with the interaction of female and male (or positive and
negative) energies.
