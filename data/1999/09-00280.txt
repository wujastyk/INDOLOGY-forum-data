Bold unsubstantiated remarks like this come pouring forth so frequently from
Vishal Agarwal these days that I seldom stop to comment.  But, purely by
chance,
 this one caught my eye.
I see no reason to reject the interpretation of Macdonell and Keith in this
matter.  The native tradition has been trying to re-interpret Yajnavalkya's
remark ever since he made it. By all means, please, look at the context
again. ZB 3.2.1.21 becomes *pointless* if we interpret *aMsala'* as a
reference to milk products.  Yajnavalya's iconoclasm is, so to say,
*emasculated* by such an obviously 'politically correct' re-interpretation of
Yajnavalkya's remark. Yajnayalkya was a free-thinker and a meat-eater and a
man with a refreshing sense of humor.
Vishal Agarwal in the past has urged us to search the list's archives for
previous discussions. I recommend the same procedure to him.

Anyone who denies that the eating of meat was common practice in the Vedic
period is, well, impenetrable.
