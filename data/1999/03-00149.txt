In the stanza challapallair varayogaratnaiH, challapalla seems to refer to a
practitioner of varayoga- (?one of the aayurvedayogas); this is not an
onomatopoetic expression like the Dravidin words given by you. In aayurveda
is there a yoga called varayoga? Or does vara mean 'good, leading'? Is it a
common noun or a proper noun? Is the ch aspirated c?  The s'loka seems to
say that varayoga cannot match rasendrayoga even one/100crores.The syntax is
not clear. What does sa in the second stanza refer to?
