I used Lexa when I did my Ph.D., and I give a description of how I used it for
tagging in my thesis. I found that Lexa through its search-and-replace function
gives you a primitive tagger. I was able to tag quite a lot of text
automatically, but it had to be cleaned up manually, and certain things had to
be entered manually.
Basic principle: Lexa allows you to search for parts of words, which allows you
create search and replace lists looking like this:
Say you want to replace "anyoldword" with "anotherandcompletelynewword" and so
on. You can them produce a list file looking like this:
word<TAB><TAB>word
etc.
This principle allows you to tag case endings, e.g.
CLASS_n: INSTRUMENTAL
ena<TAB><TAB>ena_INSTRUMENTAL
e.na<TAB><TAB>e.na_INSTRUMENTAL
etc.
or:
CLASS_n: PTCL
hy<TAB><TAB>hy_PTCL
hi<TAB><TAB>hi_PTCL
where ptcl = particle.
Words that are tagged in the wrong way frequently you may have to collect in a
separate listfile and tag them as complete words.
You will find a more detailed description in the appendices to my thesis: The
 Crux of Chronology in Sanskrit Literature. Statistics and Indology. A Study
of Method. Scandinavian Univesity Press, Oslo 1997.
Good luck!
