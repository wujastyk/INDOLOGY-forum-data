Sanskrit dance and drama
Where do people summon up the gall to make general statements such as :
 >Kuiper ...  did not know Tamil.
see for example 2 of F. B. J. Kuiper's  papers on OLD Tamil in his
collection : Selected Writings on Indian Linguistics and Philology,
Amsterdam-Atlanta 1997.
The introduction lists more, also on theater.
Kuiper (now91) knows and has written on Indo-Eur., Indo-Iranian, Old
Iranian, Vedic, Prakrit, Classical Sanskrit, Dravidian/Tamil and Munda.
This type of person -- very rare these days -- cannot be accused of
superficiality.
The only answer is to such general criticism is: read his book and check on
ALL of  his data yourself!
