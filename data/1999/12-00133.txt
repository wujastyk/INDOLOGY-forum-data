excuses
To all:
I got the address of the indology mailing-list on the Sanskrit document
page, and it is not mentioned there that the list is strictly reserved to
professional. I am thus sorry about my undesirable post. I noticed this fact
in a personal mail to Mr Wujastyk, together with other remark. Again, sorry
for the disturbance!
With regards
Eric Robert
