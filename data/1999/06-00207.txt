Dear Vidyasankar, are you not aware of the fact that we do discuss
matters on this list which are more recent than RV?
Just today I have seen several messages concerning Auribindo and
Dayanand who, as far as I remember existed later than Ottoman empire. In
my view Ottoman empire had no less impact on the indologists than these
later personalities.
Have a peaceful and joyous day.
