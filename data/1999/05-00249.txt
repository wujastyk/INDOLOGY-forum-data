Methodology: general semantics

vr.tra is a term used repeatedly in the R.gveda in the context of Indra's
exploits. The general import of the compound lexeme semant. is: enveloping,
mountain or stone. [Indra breaks it (him) asunder and releases  the waters].

tarukku = to break (Tamil); tar-upu = an artificial diamond (Telugu); tar_umpu
= dam to stop a stream (Tamil)

i'ira = gravel; vir'a, wirha_ = earth, soil (Kuwi); vira, vira'a = earth, soil
(Kui)

viri = spread out (Tamil) are-viri = half-opened (Kannada); ara-viri id.
(Telugu); biri = to burst open, rent asunder, expand (Kannada); vira_ = to
fall down, collapse (house)(Mand.a); berrna_ (birrya_) = to get out of shape
by expanding sidewise as a mud wall (Kurux)

If vr.tra is an a_pri representation, it would be a reasonable hypothesis that
Indra (indha, burning ember) breaks asunder the ores (rocks) in the process of
metallurgical extraction...
