Chabra family history book
A public library has asked my help for a patron looking for a book he
has heard of on the Chabra family (no further information).  The
patron is from the Punjab.  I suggested the other librarian check out
OCLC under the additional spellings Cabara, Chabara, and Cabra (the
latter two very off chances).  I don't find anything under these after
doing a quick OCLC search. Does anyone by chance know of such a book?
