Scripts  KannaDa/Telegu/SinhAla
Dear  Sri  Madhuresan:
Many  thanks  for  the  info.  Why  are  Tamil  and  MaLayAlam  scripts
different  from  these?  or  are  they  not?  Perhaps  they  belong  to
different  sub-group?  Kindly  let  me  know.  Also,  TuLu  once  had
its  own  script  which  resembled  the  MaLayALam  script.  Today,  it
is  just  a  spoken  language  and  we  write  to  each  other  in
KannaDa  only.  Thanks.
Regards,
B.N.Hebbar
