Q: Sakasthan Numismatics
Q1: A historian called Gandassa has claimed on Usenet that the term
`Sakasthan' is to be found on Indo-Scythic coins and inscriptions
scattered over Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat, although he does not provide
any concrete examples. Would any experts familiar with Saka numismatics
know in which inscription and on which coins is the word `Sakasthan' to be
found ? What about the terms `Gangasthan' and `Aryasthan' which Gandassa
uses ? `Aryavarta' is abundantly attested, but what about `Aryasthan' ?
Or are these terms in fact absent in the epigraphic record ?
Q2: As far as I am aware, the only term the Indo-Muslim kings had engraved
on their coins is `Hindustan'. Are the modern terms, `Islamistan',
`Mughalstan' & `Urdustan' in fact absent in the Mughal numismatic record?
