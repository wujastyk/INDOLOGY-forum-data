===== Question=======
Re: Subhashita search
Dear friends,
Since no one seems to have recognized my verse, would
one of you who has access to the
_SubhASita-ratna-bhANDAgAara_ kindly confirm for me
that it is NOT to be found there? This book is
unfortunately not available in any library within 500
km of my home.

I very much appreciate the trouble, dear
anyahitamAtrAkAGkSiNaH.
Yours,
Jan
