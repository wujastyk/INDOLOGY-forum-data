Dr. Fosse et al.,

Several Indian authors claim the following reference for Max M?ller's belief
in Biblical chronology:

"I look upon the account of creation given in Genesis as simply
historical." -- letter to the Duke of Argyll, 1875, included in Max M?ller:
Life and Letters, vol.1, 1902, p.481-482.

Probably some of you have this volume handy so that they can verify it.  If
it proves incorrect, Max M?ller was quite a progressive, for this belief was
then still quite common among Christian clergymen.

Yours sincerely,
Koenraad Elst
