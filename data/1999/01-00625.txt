I know that someone on this list, sometime ago, mentioned a website where
the hexidecimal valus for a + acute, u+ umlaut, etc. could be easily
found-- and of course, one can dig through www.w3.org, but I recall a
nicer, easier to navigate location with the expressed purpose of
presenting this esoterica to those of us toiling in the code pits.

Thanks in advance.  Gosh, remember when the only topic we used to get
snippy and tired of was character coding?  Them's was the days . . . .
