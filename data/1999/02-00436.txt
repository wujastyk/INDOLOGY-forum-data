  Well, it was pointed out that there is NO evidence to assert that
 P'u t'o island (Chinese call it Mt. P'u t'o it seems) was
 famous already in SIXTH century.

  I read that Thomas Cleary got his PhD from Stanford university
 in Chinese literature. Some his academic publications are:
 i) Entry into the inconceivable: an introduction to Hua-yen
 Buddhism, University of Hawaii press, 1983, 1994
 ii) Po-tuan Chang (10/11th C.), understanding reality: a
 Taoist alchemical classic, University of Hawaii press, 1987
 iii)Dogen, Zen essays, University of Hawaii press, 1991 ...
  I quite doubt that Cleary does not know enough Chinese literature.
