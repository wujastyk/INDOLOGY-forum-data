>?From this brief summary of Thieme's article it may appear that Thieme is
forcing the data into the framework of the magical number 21. But I think
that he had good reasons to do so, as a detailed examination of his article
would, I think, show. The number is certainly a magical one in the RV [cf.
ref. to 21 secret names of the cow, etc.]

Hope this helps,

George
