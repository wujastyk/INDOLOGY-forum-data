SaRi, as it is worn in North (with head covered) appears
ro have Greek influence. perhaps there is some relationship
between the SaRi and the dress worn in Ethiopia/Sudan.

Incidentally, at one time, before Digambaras and Svetambaras
were clearly separated, there was a sect named "eka-shaataka",
the Jain monks of this sect used a single garment, presumably
the cloth draped over the the left arm.

Incidentally original Hindi term is "saa.Rii" (itrans) not
saarii.  Somtimes the word "dhoti" is used for both men's
and well as women's garment.
