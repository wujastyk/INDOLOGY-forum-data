Dear Colleagues,
        There exists a lot of information on Hallisaka, a dramatic dance.
D. R. Mankad described it in his Types of Sanskrit Drama (Karachi,1936).
Dr.  Raghavan has discussed it at length in his book Bhoja's
Srngaraprakasa (Madras, 1963). Professor A.K.  Warder in his four volume
book on Indian Kavya Literature (New Delhi,1972-83) has also discussed it.
My own book, Movement and Mimesis (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht,
1991) has a lengthy section on it.  A forthcoming article of mine on
Uparupakas, which includes Hallisaka, is due to appear in the Journal of
Hindu Studies this fall, edited by Professor Bruce Sullivan.
