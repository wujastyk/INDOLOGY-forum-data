Dear Ms Greer,
        in addition to the review by J.W. de Jong, mentioned by J.Smith,
I would point also to another review of Grintser's book by the same author,
being a sequel to the first review:
        J.W.de Jong. The Study of the MahAbhArata. A Brief Survey (Part II).
- Hokke bunka kenkyu, No. 11, March 1984, pp. 11-19.
        Wendy Doniger (O'Flaherty) dealt briefly with Grintser's book on the
MahAbhArata in her review of van Buitenen's translation - Religious Studies
Review, vol. 4., No. 1, January 1978, pp.22, 25-26.
        Hope this may help.
        Best regards,
                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
