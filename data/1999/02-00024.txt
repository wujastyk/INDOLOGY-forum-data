influenced each other in matters of culture and civilisation.This may
include literature, architecture and arts, movies ,law ,
medicine , administration , religion and philosophy, outlooks ,privat
and every day life ,political
ideology , education, transport-railway, economy , high -society ,
elite's cultural models-the Indian elite used to study in Britain etc. I
am also interested in some general facts about multiculturatity and
the influences between the former parts of British Empire. If you know
