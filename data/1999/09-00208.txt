"boddhAro matsaragrastA prabhavaH smaya-dU.sitAH"- "smaya" Vs              "smara"
My Dear Indology friends,
In the Quotaion from Barthruhari:
"boddhAro matsaragrastA prabhavaH smaya-dU.sitAH..."
the word "smaya" seems to be correct; and not "smara".
Reason: "smyah" means, Astonishment, Surprise, Arrogance, Pride,
Haughtiness, Conceit, etc. (Please see Kalidasa's Rahguvamsha 5:13 "tasmai
smayaavEshavivarjitaaya..."; Bharata NaatyashAstra 24:163, "smayatE =
conceals) " ... smayate sA nigUDham cha vAchancha adhOmukhI vadEth", also,
MahavIracharita 2:22),  Please see Shri V S Apte's Sanskrit Dictionary
(for "smayah", and Sir Monier Williams' Eng-Sanskrit Dictionary (for
"Conceit").
See, "smaya" is more appropriate than "smara"(=Cupid, Love, etc)!
And, that is the word in the original too! (Please see Prof Barbara Stoler
Miller's Translation with Text of Bhartrihari Poems, Columbia Univ Press ,
1967, stanza 4, page 4 , ..." Kings are defiled by haughty ways;....").
Sincerely,
-Harihareswara
