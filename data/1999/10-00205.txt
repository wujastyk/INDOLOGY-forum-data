Sanskrit-Tibetan Textual Work
Dear Mr. Kragh,
Comparing a 6th century Tamil work with a Kashmiri text,
reconstruction effort was pursued once.
1. Donald A. Nelson, The Brhatkatha: a reconstruction from
BrhatkathaslOkasmgraha, PeruGkatai and Vasudevahimdi
PhD thesis, 1974, Univ. of Chicago. Nelson published a paper in
J. of Asian Studies, (I do not have the reference right now).
2. R. Vijayalakshmy, A study of the Perunkatai, an authentic
version of the story of Udayana. Int. Inst. of Tamil Studies, Madras, 1981

N. Ganesan
