Hindu new years day
Doesn't the Uttarayana in traditional Hindu astrology begin
with Jan. 14th (Pongal/makara sankrAnti)? If correct, it is
like the difference between mesha sankrAnti and vernal equinox.
Interested in references which explain the relationship
between Hindu astrological terms and modern astronomical
terms. Many thanks.
Best regards,
N. Ganesan
