Position in South Asian Literature:
University of Virginia
Academic Year 1999-2000

Applications are invited from people of all ranks, from advanced
graduate students to full professors, for a one-year position to teach
South Asian literature (in English, in translation, or both). Three
courses are to be taught on South Asian literature. One should be a
broad, introductory level course, and the other two should be
seminars, each with a thematic focus, aimed at advanced
undergraduates. The successful candidate shall also teach two courses
in advanced Hindi or advanced Urdu. Those courses are for students who
have had at least two years of previous instruction and are ready to
focus on literature.  (Note that at UVA a "course" is one semester in
length.) The Ph.D. is preferred, but a Ph.D. candidate who is ABD
would be considered. Salary will be commensurate with experience. Send
CV, proposed course descriptions and three letters of reference to:
