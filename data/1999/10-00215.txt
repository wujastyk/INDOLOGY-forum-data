Aargh.  That is a real old chestnut.  It all depends on what you are used

        I + II = III
or
        CXI + IX = CXX
are certainly simpler than
        1 + 2 = 3
or

There are other operations which make me blench in Roman, which I am very

systems are and were embedded in educational systems which interpreted
them and made them usable.  Their "ease" "efficiency" etc. can only be
judged (if at all) by examining the ... [drum roll] social context of
their use.
