Rann (etymology?)
Is rann derived from lavan.a, salt? Or, lavni = big river (Gondi)?
rINa  mfn. melted , dissolved , vanished S3is3.  
RN  cl. 8. P. A1. %{RNoti} or %{arNoti} , %{-Nute} , %{AnarNa} , %{AnRNe} ,
&c. , to go , move Dha1tup. xxx , 5 (cf. 4. %{R}.) [Cologne Sanskrit lexicon].
...ya_nti s'ubhra_ rin.annapah (RV. 8.7.28)
"...then the brilliant (Maruts) depart, and the rains have gone"; Sa_yan.a
further explains the lexeme: rin.an = as they flow in every direction,
sarvatra pravahanti.
Is the 'rann' of Kutch is related to these semant. of flow in every direction
(as a river joins the sea)? 
Are there synonyms to denote a salty marsh?
