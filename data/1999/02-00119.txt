Word splitting & hyphenation conventions in roman              transliteration
Dominik, I agree with your sentiments in both cases, but:
The idea actually was that of the great ("National Prof.") Suniti Kumar
Chatterji who in 1947 spirit thought Roman Indic would serve the country
best.
His alphabet was similar to the Kyoto-Harvard convention, -- and for
similar reasons: no extra characters needed in print shops.
And many unfortunately disappear by the day : the world-isolate Kusunda in
Nepal is gone, what about the future of the equally isolated Nahali in C.
India, Burushaski in Hunza (new book by H Berger, 1998!), etc.? ... Not to
speak of others.  Urgent research targets.
