The questions of "before" and "Arya" are not musical subjects but issues of dfferent

The musical scales or modes in the literary texts of Cilappathikaaram etc., are
mere names of scales. There is no way of knowing that these names are not regional
nomenclature of the grama-muurcchanaa scales.
The cardinal question is : What are the oldest musicological works in Tamil
detailng a musical system. If they have been translated into Hindi, Sanskrit, Gujarati
or English, I would want to read them  to enlargen my perspective of Indian musicology.
Does Tamil have a series of musicological texts such as the sanskrit series of Naardiya
Shiskha, NAtyasastra, Dattilam, Brhaddeshi, Sangeetranakara, and so on. ?
I repeat that a literary reference of Cila. or Valmiki Ramayana does not explain musical
systems nor does it prove their distinctivenes.
For the detail study of Grama-murcchanaa, please refer to my word to word translation
into English of Natyasastra Chapter 28 the Svara Adhyaaya.
I must confess that I have not heard or studied the PaN. So I cannot comment.
But perhaps I can be informed if the singers of paN, train in a musical grammar
different from that of "Karnataka music". Do they write a notation of these songs as
differnt from the karnatak music tradition.?  Do they say that these are not set to
"melas" but to  scales may be having same or similar names mentioned in the Cilappakm.
or other texts.  What i mean is, does a musical grammar also survive with these songs?
