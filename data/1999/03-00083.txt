Undertone? *Undertone*?!?

I see no fault in discussing political and/or inflammable issues. What I
object to is people using all manners of discussion as pretexts for
political agitation.

If anyone knows the answer to my original question (re. classical Hindu
views on the universality of varna), I'd be glad to hear it.
