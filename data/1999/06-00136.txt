Hindi & Sanskrit personal names
Dear Members of Indology List,
I am looking for information on Hindi as well as Sanskrit personal
names. I am very interested in morphological, semantical and
etymological analysis of such names. I would be very grateful for any
suggestions.
Yours sincerely,
Barbara Satola-Sliwa
