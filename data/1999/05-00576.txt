Ta. maNTai and ziva begging with brahma's skull
In classical Tamil texts there is a persistence occurrence of the word
maNTai
which is used in the sense of a begging bowl. Of course, it always
has meant "head"  or "skull" too which is the currently dominant sense.
It is interesting to note the connection between this and the purana
concerning
ziva begging with the skull from the erstwhile (middle?) head of
brahma.
Is that purana much later than cangkam era?
 ziva is said to have performed the decapitation of brahma, the first
of his 8 heroic acts all of which were
perfromed in Tamilkam,  at kantiyUr [A.Veluppillai: IITS-Cologne's
Kolam  Tamil electronic journal, Vol 2. ].
