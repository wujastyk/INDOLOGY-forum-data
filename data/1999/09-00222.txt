(Fwd) Banning Foreign Scholars in India.
Thank you for forwarding that message to the list. I think Academicians in
India should do something about these restrictions on work by foreign
scholars in India, especially because the restrictions harm the quality of
Indian academics itself. But the question is what can we do about it? Any
ideas?
