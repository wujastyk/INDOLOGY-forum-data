Apart from "vEntu tozil ayarum"(puR. 285.7), vEntu can be analyzed in:
1) maNNuRu muracin2 vEntu tozil viTin2E (aiG. 443.5)
2) Entu kOTTu yAn2ai vEntu tozil viTTen2a (aiG. 498.3)
3) vEntu viTu vizu tozil oziya (aiG. 428.3)
4) vEntu viTu vizu tozil eyti (aiG. 466.1)
5) Entiya koLkaiyar cIRin2 iTaimurintu
   vEntan2um vEntu keTum (kuRaL)
vEntu appears to be a noun and possibly from the verb, vEy.

(These lines describe the white parasol's covering aspect).

maNTu amar aTTa matan2 uTai nOn2 tAL
veL kuTai viLakkum viRal kezu vEntE! (puR. 212.1-2)

These lines describe the restraining aspects of the king
and the parasol. The chief dancer in the kulanAyakam
temple of the rulers was called "talaikkOli",
The "talaikkOl" is a decorative wand made out of the
stem of the vanquished rival's parasol and,
is the highest award given to the winner in the
bharata nAtyam competition by the king. This "talaikkOl"
award is vividly described in CilappatikAram and, 100s
of "talaikkOli"s, top dancers are attested in Pallava
and Chola epigraphy. Nallur Nataraja dancing on a squatting
dwarf sports this talaikkOl in one of his hands.
