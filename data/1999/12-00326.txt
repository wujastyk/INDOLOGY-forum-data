In Max Nihom's book STUDIES IN INDIAN AND INDO-INDONESIAN TANTRISM
(Vienna 1994), he mentioned a hitherto unpublished article of his
entitled "On Attracting Women and Tantric Initiation: TillotamA and
Hevajratantra II.v.38-47 and I.vii.8-9".  Does anyone know if this
article has been published, and if so, where and when?  Alternatively,
if anyone knows Dr. Nihom's email address I would appreciate it if she
or he would provide it to me.
