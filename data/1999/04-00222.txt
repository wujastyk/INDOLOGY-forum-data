Tripitaka of the Vipassana Research Institute
Dear Dr. Alexander v. Rospatt,
I usually do not use Tripitaka edition published by the "Vipassana Research
Institute(VRI)".But I frequently use CD-ROM of VRI. I think it's very useful
for researching. And you can find cross-referenc of PTS editions in this
CD-ROM edition.
