This is fascinating information. However, I am unclear on the reason behind
the interpretation you propose. I presume the rest of the inscription
provides the details.

All interesting questions, no doubt, but the only one that can be explored
based on proper evidence is the issue of the relationship between advaita
and zaivasiddhAnta. This would be the mAnasollAsa attributed to Surezvara.
The other questions would call for too many suppositions to be answered well
one way or the other.
