Dear list members,
I would like to find out information about graduate programs in Indian art
history or related topics in south india.  In particular I am interested to
know if such a program exists at the University of Madras or in the Tamil
Nadu generally.  I am also interested in any such programs in the south of
India generally.  Any information as to whom or where I might contact would
be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Benjamin Fleming
