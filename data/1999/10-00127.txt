ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM

The Himalayan Languages Symposium is an open international
forum where scholars can exchange the results of their
research with others working on related issues in the
same geographical area.  The term 'Himalayan' is used
in its broad sense to include north-western and
north-eastern India, where languages of Indo-Aryan,
Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, and Austro-Asiatic linguistic
stocks are spoken; the languages of Nepal, Bhutan and
the Tibetan Plateau; the languages of northern Burma
and Sichuan; and the languages of Nuristan, Baltistan
and the Burushaski speaking area in the west.  The
term 'Languages' is used instead of 'Linguistics'
to broaden the scope of the Symposium beyond linguistics
proper so as to allow scholars working on language issues
in the related disciplines of anthropology, philology,
and archaeology to present their research wherever this
is directly relevant to our understanding of Himalayan
languages and language communities.

The Permanent Secretariat for this annual Symposium is
maintained at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Previously, the Himalayan Languages Symposium has
been convened in Leiden, Noordwijkerhout [the
Netherlands], Santa Barbara [California], Pune [India],
and Kathmandu.


6th HIMALAYAN LANGUAGES SYMPOSIUM

The 6th Himalayan Languages Symposium will be held on
the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,
situated near Lake Michigan in Milwaukee's Upper
East Side.  Milwaukee is pleasantly warm in June.

More details regarding the venue, accommodations,
and travel will be sent out to those who respond to
this circular.
