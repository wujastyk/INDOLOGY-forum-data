Yesterday, in a discussion of the IVC _proto-Siva_ seal [a la researches
des Hiltebeitel et Shulman, fns.1,2], a bright graduate student [from
India] asked if there were significance in the seeming commonality in sound
between Mahisha and Mahesh.  Admittedly, the thought had never occured me
[or if it's mentioned by either of those gentlemen, I'd forgotten], but I
told her I'd post the query to this list.  Are these terms mere _faux amis_
or might this coincidence be further evidence in support of the theory that
Durga's victim of choice is a sort of scape-goat substitution for her
husband, in a perennial battle twixt god and goddess for pantheonic
supremacy?

Reactions, anyone?
Thanks,
