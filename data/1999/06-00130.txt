An Iranian root brb-
Dear list,
I have become interested in finding attested forms of this root, brb- 'to
lead', proposed by Bailey in BSOAS 23, cited by Mayrhofer [KEWA 2.444].
Bailey cites a Buddhist Sogdian root BrB-, with this meaning, as well as a
Khotanese Saka form bi'ra, 'rope, cable, cord.'
I am interested in determining whether or not this may be related to the
curiously isolated RV forms:
bRba'duktha = hapax at RV 8.32.10, epithet of Indra.
bRbu'H = name of a Vedic patron [cf. his dAnastuti at RV 6.45.31-33].
bR'bUkam = another hapax, at RV 10.27.23; meaning unclear, possibly of
Munda origin [thus Kuiper].
Does anyone have any insights into this problem?
Thanks in advance,
GT
