Pongal/Sankranti
"...
kUtArai vellum sIrk kOvin-thA!....
Atai utuppOm athanpinnE pARchoRu
mUta ney peythu muzangkai vazhivArak
kUti irun-thu kuLirn-thElOr empAvAi"
 If this is the poem that Mani Varadarajan is
 talking of Sakkarai Pongal, it is only
 talking of cooked rice (cORu) mixed with
 milk (pAl). This is not Pongal.
 Or, is it another poem where Pongal is mentioned?
 Obviously, everyone has to do more research.
