Yet another areal feature in SA languages?
may
imperfect
The difference in aspect between the
*  imperfective aspect ( expressed by present stem, e.g.   imperfect:
a-ga-ccha-t;
                type of verbs:  durative)   and
*  perfective aspect      (expressed by  aorist stem, a-gan-(t),
a-gam-a-t etc., not just the
        sigmatic aorist : a-gaM-s-/ agam-iS-)
                type of verbs: terminative, inchoative, momentative, etc.
has been known to insiders for decades (e.g., K.Hoffmann, Der Injunktiv
im Veda, Wiesbaden 1969). Both have diff. meanings, obviously, and
should be translated (Vedic exx.)  as: "he came :: he has come just
now."  Panini knows that.
It seems to be a characteristic of Proto-Indo-European, and has not
resulted a hypothetical influence of  S. Asian areal linguistics. In
fact, the distinction is much more widespread than even in S. Asia
(e.g., in Turkish) and has been known to grammarians. Our popular(!)
understanding is  spoilt by the idea of 'tenses'.
What about Russian  (found in every grammar), or even the English forms
in <italic>-</italic>ing  ( I was sitting :: I sat)??? (and colloquial
N.W.  German).
Also in Old Japanese:  check forms in -nu, -tsu.
Pali  has already lost the IE /IA distinction (along with almost all
occurences of imperfect, perfect).
I think  one of our Amer. linguistic colleagues (who?)  has written
about this soem 5 years ago , as found  in medieval Sanskrit (Narrative
literature: periphrastic constructions); incidentally, this presages
NIA languages like Hindi, etc., where we have similar features but not
a grammaticalization into just TWO categories:  Instead, a number of
'compounded verbs' (technically speaking , "Aktionsarten") .  Like Jpn.
-te shimau, -chatta, etc. suc as in coll. machigae-chatta "he has just
now made a mistake".
