Tibetan Origin of Tantrism and Siva
Sort of like Manu talking with a malicious glee :-)
Manu is venerable because Nietzsche used him
to beat Christianity and William Jones' statue
holds Manu in his hand.
No offence intended to Manu or any other party.

N.Ganesan duking it out with Samar Abbas!
I love it.   :-)  :-)
Sort of like Prabhakaran duking it out
with Ayatollah Khomeini.   :-)
No offence intended to any party, esp.
to N. Ganesan, whose Tamil expertise I
appreciate.
