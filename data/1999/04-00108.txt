I do not have Raghuvamsa with me. What is the shlokam
talking of uragapura of Pandyas? Can some member tell us this
please?

AlavAy, the banyan tree place (Madurai Sundarezvara temple),
being represented as the place of hAlahAla poison reminds of
a Kalamekam poem. The poet is the best satirist who lived in the
14th century. Alam's two meanings - banyan & poison, are subtly used
in a different context here.

 AlaG kuTiyAn2ai, AlAlam uNTAn2ai.
   AlaG kuTiyAn2en2Ru Arcon2n2Ar? - AlaG
 kuTiyAn2E Ayin2, kuvalayattOr ellAm
   maTiyArO maNNAkat tAn2!

Alam, the first word of the poem refers to banyan in banyan village
(AlaGguDi). Alam, the first word in II line, refers to hAlahAla
poison drunk by Shiva.

All the best,
V. Iyer
