I verified and found 38 village names in Punjab with ends with the 'string'
UR. When we exclude PUR ending names (for obvious Indo-Aryan etymology) we
come across 15 names like Kalanaur(twice in Gurdaspur district)
Phillaur(twice in Jalandhar) Balachaur(twice in Hosiarpur) Ghanaur
(twice,Patiala)and Sangrur(4,Sangrurdistrict).AUR as dysyllabic placename
occurs twice in Jalandhar. Whether Kalanaur, Phillaur etc are the
combination of prefix+Aur as suffix has to be verified. Then Sangrur remains
unexplained. Besides in Punjab there are 8 placenames with UR as Prefix.e.g:
URNA,URANG,URMAR,URDHAN.
In Haryana similarly Radaur(2) Ganaur(4),Kalanaur(4) Phillaur(3),
Balachaur(3),Ghanaur(2)Sangrur(2) occur. AUR alone as a placename occurs
twice. There are 14 instances of UR as prefix.e.g: Urnai, Urjani, Urdan etc.
As regard with Dravidian UR occuring in Pakistan and Indian context- there
are many seemingly Dravidian placenames in currency in these areas. If
interested I can post to indology.
UR as a place name component is found in Iraq region
