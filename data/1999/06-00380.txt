origin of mAl
Dear Indologists,
Is there any account of the birth of mAl/mAyOn
in Tamil literature? I am looking for something
similar to murukan's birth from koRRavai, later
fused with Durga/Parvati.
For that matter, is there a Sanskrit account of
the birth of Vishnu, with the names of parents
given?
Mani
