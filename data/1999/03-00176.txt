Dear Sri Kumar,

I just read your thesis on the Dravidian origin of IE
with the examples.  It's impressive.  There are several
typos that need correction.

I am not a linguist, but I don't understand why should
a thesis blame anyone for neglect.  Lack of knowledge
is not neglect, but an expression of ignorance.
Some of the paragraphs may be redone to make the
thesis more focused.

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
