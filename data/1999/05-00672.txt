I am having 7th printing (1981) which is (I hope) almost
identical to 3rd edition (1931) (UVS passed away in 1942).
I don't think I have seen reference in its preface
to tirumayilai caNmukam piLLai's edition, but
it may have escaped me...

HOWEVER, in his autobiography
(chap.121, "maNimEkalaip patippu Arampam"),
UVS writes the following (2-Am patippu, 1982):
 "maNimEkalaiyin2 mUlam mAttiram 1891-Am varuSam tirumayilai
  vittuvAn2 caNmukam piLLaiyAl acciTappeRRatu. poruL
  varaiyaRai ceytu koLLAmalE pala viTaGkaLil ETTiluLLa
  pATaGkaLai avar amaittiruntAr. antap piratiyaik koNTu
  nUR poruLai nan2ku aRital ciramamAkavE irukkum" (p.754-755)
UVS then quotes a long comment (13 lines)
from a letter (dated 29-3-1891) to him
by ti.ta.kan2aka cuntaram piLLai
on that edition's bad quality.

The english translation (S.K.Guruswamy) of the abridged Tamil
Edition (I do not have Zvelebil's full translation at hand)
reads as:
 <<Vidwan Shanmugam Pillai of Mylapore had in 1891,
  printed the bare text of _Manimekalai_, reproducing as they were
  the readings he had found in palm-leaf scripts, without bothering
  about their true form or meaning. Few people could understand
  the poem with the help of this publication. [I told myself
  there was nothing wrong in bringing out an edition
  of my own, seven years after that date --- an edition too
  that carried the fruits of my research in the shape of notes
  of various kinds.]>> (p.376)

I hope this is useful
