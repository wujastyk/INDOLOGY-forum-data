Dear Mr. Hebbar,

I apologize if I offended you. I assumed you were born a
Srivaishnava based on your last name (I know other
Srivaishnavas who also keep the name "Hebbar") and meant
it in good humor.  If this is incorrect, please do not
take offense.  I meant no disrespect by including you among
the "Iyengar clan", as I myself am a Srivaishnava.

I apologize to the rest of Indology for this distraction.

Mani
