Tamil Heritage

You have repeatedly been doing so. You threw a challenge to cite
Tamil *verbs* with specific phonemes and when shown  a handful of them,
you declare "I am not familiar with these words"!
Please then do not *initiate* such discussions if you are not capable
of doing  the basic homework. This is a scholarly forum.

Please substitute Sanskirt for English and proto-Dravidian/Tamil at IVC
for Greek/Latin. Then that would explain how Skt. and Ino-Aryan
heritage got where it is. Let us get that straight :-))

The forum is still waiting for you references to chastity of brahmins
in the most readily accessible book in the tamil land, viz.
"thirukkuRaL".
Can we continue any discussion on thirukkural after that, please?
I have not seen a single philological evidence cited by you to support
your claims in the dozens of posts in the previous month; you
habitually fail to fulfill scholarly obligation on your side by citing
any decent evidence but spawn a new thread of debate that presupposes
the factuality of your (as yet open) assertions in preceding posts.  It
is very difficult indeed to engage in fruitful discussions with you.
