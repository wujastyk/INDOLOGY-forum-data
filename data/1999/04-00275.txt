viSNu, sacred thread, and necklace
Dear List members,
I would appreciate if anybody could provide any pre-Kalidasa Sanskrit
references describing any form of viSNu and his sacred thread or necklace as
being similar to a dark mountain with a white waterfall or river? Thanks in
advance.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
