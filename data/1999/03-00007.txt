Personal attacks on the list
Dear Sir
The case with proxy as you explain is fine but is there a chance
the these five people will use the same proxy in the office and
another (but all one) ISP at home all of them same ISP at home in
Houston and all of them same proxy at work?? The ISP address as
you may see is not a proxy by Dynamic adress from the same
provider.

It certainly van be proven. Except that you can look at the melody
their voices play.
