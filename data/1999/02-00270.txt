Can this discussion be more respectful?

Some of us do not know what the true story is,
but I think a person can't be as bad as is depicted.
Besides he is a member in this list as all are.
No, I don't have personal knowledge of any of
the personalities.  I just wish a better articulation
of the difference in view.
