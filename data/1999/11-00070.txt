Bhamaha-Kavyalamkara
Dear Reader,
my aim is to produce an essay on sanskrit poetics with Bhamaha?s work
Kavyalamkara as a primary source and reference.  Reading the editions of P.V
Nag. Sastry (Tanjore 1927)and Batuk Nath Sarma and Baladeva Upadhyaya (Kashi
S.Series 1928)I miss a decent commentary, preferably in sanskrit or hindi. I
know of only one, namely D.T. Tatacharya?s "Udyanavritti" from 1934. Where
could I get hold of this edition? I will be thankful for any help regarding
commentaries and works on/relating to Bhamaha.
With kind regards,
Katharina Heinrich.
