The dictionary is openable on a Macintosh but maybe only the PDF file and
then you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader to view it. It is freely
downloadable from:

Printing the dictionary may be an answer, I did a trial page and it came
out well.


>I visited your indology page and admired it. The openning page is gorgeous.
>The dictionary seems to be very interesting and useful, handier than
>Renou-Tschoupak. I am sure the new sanskrit scholars will make good use of
>it. However, I must tell you that I did not succeed to open it on my
>Macintosh. It opened on a  PC  but the impression was very faint, so   the
>reading  was laborious. I guess it is a question of the  computer know-how
>of which my level is very low. Thanks for making this work available on the
>web. Greetings. A. Nayak
