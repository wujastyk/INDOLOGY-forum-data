Dr. Thompson's dating of the Rigveda
Dear Shri Vishal,
What is your taking as Rigveda's date, Like you,
I also do not take Rajaram in toto.
Let us take Rigveda to be composed in circa 5000 B.C.
In the Western journals, they say PIE has not broken
up by 3500 B.C. and PIEs were still near Ural mountains.
Then the ground-breaking readings by Jha and Rajaram
of IVC seals as Vedic will put the PIE homeland in India.
Is that correct? Also, scholars say some major contrasts exist with
what is known of Indus-Sarasvati culture and what we
know about Aryan society from Vedic texts.

V. Iyer
