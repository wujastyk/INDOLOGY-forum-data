'sari' (Attn: H M Hubey)
Jan 6, 99
If the word 'sari' is meant to stand for Indian women's clothing
(overwear!), then it comes from Sk 'shaaTii' through Pk 'saaDii', a word
still in use in Marathi. The sound D in Indian languages is represented by
r in English spellings of Indian words. (DhArwAr for DhArwAd.)
