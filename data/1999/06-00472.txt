Dear Toke Lindegaard,

"the science of ritual" (as can be seen from Olivelle's own notes, which you
may find useful otherwise as well) is "brahmavidyA", and "mathematics" is
"rAzi" [in other transcriptions "ra-s'i" or "raas'i"].
rAzi, m. in the standard dictionaries means: 1. heap, mass, pile, quantity,
number 2. a sign of the Zodiac.

The dating of  the chAndogya-upaniSad is, according to (unproven) consensus,
pre-Buddhistic. Clearly the material accumulated over a longer period; you
could relatively safely assume the 5th century B.C.E. as a date for an
almost-final recension. (See Olivelle's Introduction p. XXXVI.)

Yours,
Ferenc
