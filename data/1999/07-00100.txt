Genealogy
Dear members of the list,
a friend of mine, who is a leading member of the Norwegian Genealogical Society
and an historian with interests in personal history/biography, genealogy,
family history, vexilology, sfragistics and heraldry, is looking for
institutions or societies in South Asia and Iran which specialize in such
studies with the objective of establishing an exchange of, or subscriptions to,
journals within these fields.
If any of you have any suggestions, please send them directly to Mr. Vigerust
personally at
Tore Hermundsson Vigerust [toreher at online.no]
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
