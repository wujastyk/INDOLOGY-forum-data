slander and peer pressure
Dear Members,
If you all will remember, in the second chapter of the Bhagavadgita Krishna
is encouraging Arjuna to act.
In verses 34-36, Krishna states that if Arjuna does not fight/act, he will
basically be the victim of slander.
By encouraging Arjuna in this manner, Krishna is, to use a modern
expression, implementing the tool of 'peer pressure.'
I am wondering if you could say more about the role of honor, slander, and
'peer pressure' within the Veda-s.
