I certainly do _not_ want to start a discussion on this topic at all,
but simply want to know whether you have have forgotten
authors like Anselm of Canterbury, Duns Scotus, Thomas
Aquinas, William of Ockham, or Nicholas of Cusa (to name only
some of the most original ones and not to mention some of the
ingenious Italian Renaissance thinkers) etc. etc.? (Hopefully
your definition of philosophy is not so narrow as to exclude these
thinkers.)
With kind regards,
