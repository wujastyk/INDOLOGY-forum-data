wheat: Dr. *kO.lam/kU.lam > *guliG > Bur. guriG, gureG (pl.).
Also, kannada gOdi < *gO.di < *kO.di < IVC *kO.lam  because
in dravidian, the noun endings -am and -i are interchangeable many
times. Likewise central Dr. kUli, kU.di < *kO.lam also.
If this working hypothesis stands, wheat might have been called
something like *kO.lam/kU.lam in IVC which explains the derivation of
Bur. gurig, Skt. godhUma, Kan. gOdi and the importance of
kuu.lam/kuulam in tamil literature.
Appreciations for your comments on this.

Note 1: Substrates in OIA, EJVS, 1999, p. 23
"*gOdi 'low red plant' (Southworth 1988, 1979, 1990) which is
quite different from the Panjab word *gO-dum > Vedic godhuuma
'cowsmoke' ".
For Panjab, Dr. *kOLam > *gO.dum > *gOdum is likely.
Note 2:
kUlavatii river is given in Monier-Williams. Which purana
mentions this river? Is it a legendary or real one?
What is the traditional explanation of the name, godAvari?
Consider kUlam 'grains' and  *kOLam > ta. cOLam and brahui xolam.
Is *kOLaviri > *gODaavari > godAvari admissible?? (cf. kAvEri and
ta. kAviri).
