[ADMIN] Re: J. C. Bose Invented Marconi's Wireless
Dear Dr Maharaj,
Please do not send full newspaper articles to the INDOLOGY list.  I quite
understand that you may find a particular article interesting, and indeed
so may other people on the list.  But this is not a proper use of our
list.  It is also an infringement of the newspaper's copyright, and if
they decided to pursue this in law, it could easily lead to INDOLOGY
having to close permanently.  The way to deal with this is to provide a
short reference to the article so that others can follow it up for
themselves.  If the article is available online, just give the URL, and a
single sentence saying why the article may be interesting to scholars of
classical India.
Another point is that you posted this same information about JC Bose to
the list in November 1997.  It is not fresh information, nor is it based
on new research by yourself.
Finally, the posting was too long.  Please try to keep postings to about a
single screenfull of text.
Thank you.
Dominik Wujastyk
