Does Purusha will?

Sorry for the lapsus: thirteen is obviously the number of the components of
the karaNa.
As for the number of indriyas, to me the SK text seems unambiguous. sAttvika
ekAdazakaH pravartate vaikRtAd ahaMkArAt, the sattvic group of eleven
originates from the vaikRta ahaMkAra (SK 25), and the eleven is the ten
indriyas plus manas, which is also an indriya, being similar (indriyaM ca
sAdharmyAt, SK 26-27). As they originate from (one aspect of) the ahaMkAra,
they cannot in any way include the buddhi or the ahaMkAra.
