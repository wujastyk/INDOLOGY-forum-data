As the work under reference seems to be an Ayurvedic thesaurus,
'anekaartha-varga' should be the section of words with more than
one referent, as in works of similar nature like Amara-kosha.
'Lakshmana' is noted in Charaka, Suutra. IV.94 as a vegetable.
Section 7 appears to be a list headed by (-aadi) that vegetable.
