I do not know how you can say this. In post-Gita Hinduism,
God-human counsels are very prominent.  The Puranas are
full of them. One need only look at the Bhagavata Purana,
or the (Vaishnava, Saiva, or SAkta) Agamas to see this.
One may argue that this too is the influence of Buddhism,
either through the Gita or directly, but God-human counsels
certainly aren't "unknown".
