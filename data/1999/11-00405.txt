This is the opposite of the actual case.  The CS and CSX character sets
were designed specifically to include as many European accented characters
as could be accommodated, in addition to those essential for Sanskrit and
Vedic.  The German and French scholars who sat round the table in Vienna,
where CS/CSX was born, ensured that this was the case.  However, the more
Indic characters you put into your font, the fewer spaces are left for
other things like European chars.  So CS has most European chars, while
CSX+ has the fewest (but the richest choice of Indic characters).
