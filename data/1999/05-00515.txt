varna and jati
This is highly inappropriate but I've  just GOT to tell my missionary joke.
There was a missionary in Africa who one day asked one of his black parishioners
the fatal question: "Tell me, what do you Africans REALLY think of us whites?"
The African answered: "Well, to be quite frank with you, you remind us of peeled
bananas".
Anyone for bananas?
