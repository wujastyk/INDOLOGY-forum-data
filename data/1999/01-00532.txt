In fact, this is exactly what the meaning is. One can compare the
cilappatikAram lines below.

tErmun2 nin2Ra ticai mukan2 kANap
pArati ATiya viyan2 pANTaraGkamum      (cilappatikAram 6.44-45)

According to the commentator aTiyArkkunallAr, "tErmun2" refers to the front
part of the chariot where brahma is standing.
