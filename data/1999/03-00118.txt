On first reading I thought it sounded OK, but then I began to wonder at the
proposed outcome. It seems to me that whenever a subject which creates a
great amount of dialogue comes up, it is mainly two or three who jump in
wholeheartedly. If a restriction is placed on these two or three
protagonists, then I fear that the quality of debate will fall off and there
will not be very much food for thought flowing through.
