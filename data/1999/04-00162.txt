Hi,

There is information of interest to indology members at:
http://www.soton.ac.uk/~tjms/eurasia.html (extracts mirrored at
http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/aryan/glacialage.htm)

The Eurasia map of 5000 years ago is revealing. The only region which could
have supported an extensive civilization (such as the Harappan), is shown to
be in South Asia and not near the Caucus. Preliminary land ecosystem maps of
the world since the Last Glacial Maximum are prepared by Laboratoire de
Geologie du Quaternaire, CEREGE, Europole de l'Arbois, B.P. 80, F-13545,
Aix-en-Provence Cedex 04, France.

Comments are welcome.
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
