>From a study of the Indo-Aryan, Munda and Dravidian lexemes in over 8000
groups,it appears that as many as 4000 DEDR 'etyma' have concordant lexemes in
the other two language families, perhaps derived from common roots or semes.
These semantic groups tend to confirm the remarkable observations of Keerthi
Kumar.

Would this be adequate evidence to claim that Dravidian is the mother tongue?
May be a thousand flowers bloomed at once; many language families are of great
antiquity.
