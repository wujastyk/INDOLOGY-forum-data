naa.dii (was: Paishaacika Sanskrit?)
Dear Dominik (if I may be so bold as to use first names),
Thank you very much indeed for your help. I will contact your friend
directly. Incidentally, would you have any suggestions for 'netra-krimi',
save what has been mentioned already (Guinea worms/Trichinosis)? Ever seen
the term before?
Regards,
Martin Gansten
