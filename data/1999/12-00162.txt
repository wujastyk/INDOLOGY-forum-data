Perhaps a word origin with a direct meaning could be considered here,viz., Tamil verb 'cAttutal.'
This verb is used even today for covering and tying around the temple deity with open ended garments (like
saree/dhoti) and also with flowers. Any flower or even poetical offering is also referred to by the same verb.
But the basic meaning is related to open ended garments only. Any garment which is wound over a person would be
referred to with this verb. The etymolgy for this garment could have been  cAttu>cAtti>cAti>cAdi>zAdi>zAri.
There is another related word 'cAttiyam' - it means 'one can possibly tie up and complete'. In Tamil 'possibility for
ending up' is also referred as 'possibility for tying up'. We can look at the similarity in meaning of the words 'cAttu' and
'cAttiyam'
Another word commonly used on wearing a zAri is 'muTital' - again it means 'tying up'. The whole crux of wearing a
zAri is to 'tie up', if it should not get loosened up.
In short, the core idea is 'tying;. 'cAttu' precisely means that.
