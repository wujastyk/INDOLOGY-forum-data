Subject: correction to "a few more Bhagavad Gita Obscurities"
Message-ID: <161227047015.23782.16001703145339940963.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Gentlemen:

I accidently sent two copies of the transmission "a few more Bhagavad
Gita Obscurities".  The first one was a draft and contains a misprint.

  ...gRcchantymUDA... and ...gRcchantymUDAH... should read
  ...gacchantyamUDA... and ...gaccantyamUDAH...


The second one which I intended to send alone also contains a misprint
in the same lines.

...gacchantymUDA... and ...gacchantymUDAH... should read
...gacchantyamUDA... and ...gacchantyamUDAH...

Please ignore the first one sent and apply the misprint correction to
the second.

Thank you for your patience


Harry Spier
