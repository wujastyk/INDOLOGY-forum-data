desire in buddhism
Dear List Members,
   I have a student doing a research project about desire
(trsna/tanha/raga/etc) in Buddhism. Does anyone know of some good resources
for this topic? He has been investigating accounts of the 4 noble truths,
especially the second noble truth. Anything else?
Thanks,
John Grimes
