Pronunciation of short a

   Briefly: the "n" endings are added only when sanskrit nouns
   are tamilized. Tamil grammar requires it. Tamils do not say
   with a final "n" when they read Sanskrit either in grantha or nagari.
   Ie., they pronounce "Arjunan"  while reading Tamil texts only. But, it is
   "arjuna" when they recite Skt MBh, with a clear final "a". Tamil BrAhmaNa
   traditions of preserving Vedas and later Sanskrit is justly world famous.
