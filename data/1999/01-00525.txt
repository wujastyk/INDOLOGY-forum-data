  Does anyone have any information on the position Mahabharata occupied
in the learning process of ancienct and medeival India ? It is a Smriti
text and there are 15 Gitas in the Mahabharata, including the Bhagawat
Gita (please correct this if I am mistaken about the number 15).
Familiraity with the MBh. could imply familiarity with the BG. The
various incidents relating to Sri Krishna that the Alvars sing of, are
these from the MBh. or the Puranas ? Would it be correct to interpret
that a reference to the entire MBh. is quantified in the Alvars' poems as
Sri Krishna standing in front of/on the chariot with Arjuna ? If I am not
mistaken, Bodhayana, whom Sri Ramanuja quotes, has made references to the
BG and MBh. in his vartikka. Bodhayana is dated to about 400 BC. If there
is a detailed reply to this, please send it to me directly (in keeping
with the policy of 2k as the post limit).

Thanks
Ashish
