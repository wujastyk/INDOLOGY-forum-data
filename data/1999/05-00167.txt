Sait Issa
Saint Issa is said to be Jesus. What is the substance in this? Do I hev to
make my own opinion. I need to live several lifetimes in order to build my
own opinion on everything. I this what reincarnation is all about? How come
then that I don't know anything of my previous lifes? Or does that
exoerience somehow manifest in myself in some waw? How?
