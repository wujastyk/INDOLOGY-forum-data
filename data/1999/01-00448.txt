Classical vs. Modern
Dear Friends,
For a look at Tamil Nadu Government's proposal to Govt.
of India to classify Tamil as a Classical language,
please see The Hindu, India's national newspaper, 17-Jan-99.

It is titled: Tamil as classical language: CM's call.
This project is by Dr. V. C. Kulandaisamy and Dr. G. John Samuel.
Regards,
N. Ganesan
