[Query] J. A. van Buitenen's "Mahabharata".
Hello all,
Pardon my recent onslaught of messages...
Does anyone happen to know what became of the project started by the
late esteemed Dr. van Buitenen to translate the Mahabharata? He was able
to complete three of the planned eight volumes. In the preface to the
first volumes, Dr. van Buitenen estimated that the final volume would be
completed by 1983. However, this date has long since passed. Is this
project still active? Have his disciples picked up where he left
off?
Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
