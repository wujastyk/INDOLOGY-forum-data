History of the usage of the terms --"mImAMsa",              "vedAnta" and "mAyAvAda"
I would appreciate if someone could answer the following questions based on
usages in the *Indo-Aryan* texts.
When, if ever, did mImAMsa and vedAnta come to refer to two mutually
exclusive entities? When is the earliest use of the term mAyAvAda? Was
zankara's philosophy known by any name which was not pre-zankaran?
Thanks in advance.
