Yes you are right.
pAlaTai
otl pAlaTai pAlaTai 01 conchshell or any metallic imitation of it for feeding
infants
Ta. pAL = milk; Ta. aTu (or = to give; Ta. aTai = feeding.
Actually it used to be called "cagkaTai" also in rural areas, the "cagku"
clearly being a reference to the conch shell originally employed for feeding
milk.

While I do not know whether there are any such deliberate connections in the
tradition,
the feeder does look exactly like the base of the siva lingam.
But of course siva's consort pAravthi is frequently cited for her luxuriant
motherly breasts in post-cangkam bhakti literature; her epithets in many
ancient siva temple of tamil nadu also refer to that attribute.
Like "pOkam Artta pUN mulaiyAL"  for the female deity at the very ancient
thirunallARu temple.
