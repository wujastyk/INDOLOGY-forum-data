De/Increase in USA's India interest, 1970's??
Class enrollments in courses on South Asia have indeed increased on 
many campuses, including here at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign.  However, the "clientele" has changed dramatically 
at many of these institutions (perhaps all?).  In the 60s and 70s 
students tended to be European-American and interested in research on 
South Asia.  Now the bulk of the students consists of South 
Asian-Americans (mainly Indians) who want to know more about their 
roots.  If the government is involved in this, then only indirectly, 
by removing certain restrictions on immigration and thus making 
possible a vastly increased influx of South Asians to the US.
