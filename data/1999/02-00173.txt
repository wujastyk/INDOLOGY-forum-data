because there are only 26 letters in the roman alphabet and there are no
ligatures (samyuktakshara's). because printing technology in a linear
script (one letter next to another) is much more simply implemented and
we can use the technology that is already developed for western
languages (like standardised computer and printing equipment), and so
producing printed materials becomes easier. this is an important
advantage if we want to spread literacy among many millions of people.
and once a person has learned one written indian language, s/he can
quickly learn a lot of others (become literate in other languages too)
on the basis of the large number of sanskrit words in all the languages
that can be immediately recognised because there is no script barrier.
did i say that script is the only factor in successfully spreading
literacy? no.
