Need information
Which vol. were you told was out of print?  The online version of
Books in Print seems to be inconsistent about whether both vols. are
in print?  Have you checked out the printed version and contacted the
publishers?  Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com) also seems to say at
least one vol. is in print. Finally, if you search the following list
of online rare and out of print bookfinders, you probably will be able
to find a copy of the missing vol., maybe at less than the in print
price:
