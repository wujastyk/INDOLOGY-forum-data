One more try re source of Buddhist story.
Dear Dr. Spier,
I am not able to give any reference but I have heard this story
before (in a Hindu setting).  I believe the sage was Narada, and that
he advised the snake to hiss but not bite.  Hopefully someone has
the reference.
Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
