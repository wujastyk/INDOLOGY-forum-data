Perhaps we should add, for the benefit of Ashish, that practically the whole
discussion can be found in the Indology archives. There he will find all the
arguments that can possibly be brought to bear on the subject rehashed several
times.  He will also find references to various books on the subjects. I agree
that we now should regard the AIT/AMT as a closed subject. There is little more
to be said, except perhaps to exchange bibliographic notes.

Best regards,
