Tibetan Origin of Tantrism and Siva
<<<
Apologies for the `name-calling'. I didn't think I was too bad,
because I put it in quotes to shorten a longer description. Did not
 anticipate that the phrase `Dravidianist' I used below would cause
 such pain. Apologies to N.Ganesan if he felt offended at being
 called `Dravidianist'.
 NOT AT ALL, Samar. Even in sleep, I would not be offended
 if anyone calls me Dravidianist! I will be in an illustrious
 company of Savants.
 Just for pure love of Tamil and things Dravidian, I do these
 things. Spend lots of money and time too for Tamil.
 Somebody says Tamil is not a classical langauge. Try it
 with Greeks: Tell a Greek that Greek is not a Classical
 langauge, Will they buy this if told?? I doubt very much.
 Best regards,
 N. Ganesan
 PS: Short on time, I will write what I know of Indian
 origins of Saivism soon. I am very skeptical of Tibet
 or African 'siva. I have not read your posts of yesterday,
 will do it soon.
