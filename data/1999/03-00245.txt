    Referring to the ongoing discussion on R.Kishna, while it is no doubt
the term pennai means the palm tree-now commenly known as panaimaram,it is
baffling to associate pennai/panai with riverbanks and rivers as pnai is
aquintessential arid region vegetation.
  Pennai appears to be back formation of pennar-like Kovai,Thanjai etc.
rather than other way round.
  The name pennai for these 3 rivers may therefore need further looking
into.Perhaps it could have derived from veni(Krishnaveni) as veni
also means river both generic as well as specific.

  Krish.
