I am a scientific worker and an Indian living in America. How do you
know I am maintaining the "status quo of caste patriarchy elsewhere?"
whatever the terms "status quo", "caste patriarchy" and "elsewhere" may
denote?
   I am sorry, Mr. Rao. I should have said "some" Indians.
   Wrote in haste, please forgive me for missing "some".

   I can understand your nonpolitical thoughts. Thank you.
