I think this is very far fetched extrapolation to AIT theory.
I would even use the word "absurd".  Religious rivalry in India
is a late phenomenon and many "hindus' who might be involved
have little to do with the vedas.
Indologists should have political pulls also!  Sounds odd also.
Astronomers claim - keep the nights dark, such that we can observe.
It will be really horrible if provincial researchers make
national policies!
I personally believe that india and indians must protect themselves
more regarding their individual self-interest as any nation on earth.
Please don't take me wrong on this.  We need this country and culture
to be sustained by her people..
