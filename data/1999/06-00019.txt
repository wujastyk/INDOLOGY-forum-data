Subject: cakravyuha in MahAbhArta
Message-ID: <161227049824.23782.11268892151502066936.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Hindu epic MahAbhArta mentions of "cakravyuha" to trap enemy. Abhimanu died
in such a trap.  I wonder if there is an article about the design/nature of
cakravyuha.  Any help will be appreciated.
