The conception of Rama

The "putryeshti yajna" held after ashvamedha held by Dasharatha, in my opinion (and we
are all entitled to our interpretations provided they are based on evidence of certain
existing practices) is a euphemism for niyoga. The miraculous description of the
"paayasam"  bearing person emerging from the yajna fire is heighten the eupphemistic
mode. If just a putryeshti were to be held, it could have been done by Vasishtha
or others, but Dasharatha had to  go and seek and  bring  Rishyashranga, the son in law
of a friend, this only conforms to the rules of selecting a relative or a surrogate for
niyoga.
With regards,
