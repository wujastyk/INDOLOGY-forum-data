Dear Prof Karp,
Could we not take as evidence of niyoga a more lucid reference
in the mantra 10/40/2,

(the second line) h
Ko vaam  shayutraa vidhaveva devaram maryana yoshaa krinute sadhastha aa.

(please forgive incomplete spellings due to email constaints).

The "putryeshti yajna" held after ashvamedha held by Dasharatha, in my opinion (and we
are all entitled to our interpretations provided they are based on evidence of certain
existing practices) is a euphemism for niyoga. The miraculous description of the
"paayasam"  bearing person emerging from the yajna fire is heighten the eupphemistic
mode. If just a putryeshti were to be held, it could have been done by Vasishtha
or others, but Dasharatha had to  go and seek and  bring  Rishyashranga, the son in law
of a friend, this only conforms to the rules of selecting a relative or a surrogate for
niyoga.

With regards,
Bharat Gupt
