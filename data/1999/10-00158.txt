Neither book is likely to be available till next year.  I am awaiting the
return of my ms from OUP's editors, and we are still waiting several
papers for the Curzon edited vol which has yet to be submitted to their
editors. The info is as follows:

Bryant, Edwin.  In Quest of the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan
Inavsion Debate   New YOrk: Oxford U. Press, in press.

--- and Patton, Laurie. The Indo-Aryan Controversy: Evidence and Inference
in Indian History.  Richmond: Curzon Press, forthcoming.
