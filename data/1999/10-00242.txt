-wAlA in Sindhi personal names
The place names in Sindhi -vali, Gujarati -wArI/warI (Sankalia),
Marathi -oli, are derived from a Dr. word for 'village' (tam. paLLi,
kan. paLLi/haLLi, tel. palli, kur. pallI DEDR 4018) (cf. Ramasamy
Aiyar, Southworth, Parpola)
There are many Sindhi persons with names ending with -wAlA.
Do the Sindhi -vAlA originally refer to a person from a village,
-vali? Do the medieval historical documents from the Sindh support
this explanation?
And, does this get extended in Punjabi to a person from any place
(even though the name of the place itself does not end with -vali)?
Eg., LongowAlA, JalianwAla.
