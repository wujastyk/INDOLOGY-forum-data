The conception of Rama
Bharat Gupt wrote:
On what basis do you assert that the system of Niyoga was Vedic? In
which Veda is it prescribed? Please provide some reference.
Of course, Ramayan is an epic with mythical characters created by its
author who in tradition of day even had himself participate in its story
as real life character. Who are you to say what he had in mind other
than what you can read in his writing?
Have a peaceful and joyous day.

Random thought of the day:
        Gauls! We have nothing to fear; except perhaps that the sky may fall on
our heads tomorrow. But as we all know, tomorrow never
comes!---Adventures of Asterix.
