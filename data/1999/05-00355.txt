In  support  of  their  doctrine  of  Prapatti,  the  ShrI-VaiShNavas
quote  4  Sanskrit  passages.  I  know  the  scriptural  citations  for
three,  but  have  not  been  able  to  nail  the  fourth  one  down,
i.e.  the  VarAha  carama  shloka.  Here  is  the  Sanskrit  text:

sthite  manasi  susvasthe  sharIre  satiyo  naraH
dhAtu  sAmye  sthite  smartA  vishvarUpan.ca  mAmajam
tamevam  mRyamANAntu  kAShTapAShANa  sannibham
aham  smarAmi  madbhaktam  nayAmi  paramAngatim.

Is  this  from  the  VarAha  PurANa?

Thanks,
