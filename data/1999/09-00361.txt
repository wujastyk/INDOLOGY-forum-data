Perhaps the answer is to replace 'God' with 'god'. In the purAnic conception
gods share the same faculties as human beings  with perhaps sometimes those
faculties being more powerful. Perhaps the word 'Deva' therefore should not
be translated as 'God'. Gods including Vishnu are depicted as being capable
of anger and desire. In this at least the purAnic conception bears
similarity to the Greek rather than the Semitic conception.
