I certainly do not wish to enter a discussion about EU policy on this
list, and hope that noone else does, but I nonetheless believe that it
is necessary to add a severe caveat to this statement. Suggesting that
Turkey's non-admission to the EU is somehow *caused* by Turkey's
secularism is indicative of a lack of knowledge not only of EU politics
but also, and more so, of what has happened to Turkey's secularism over
the past years (or decades).
