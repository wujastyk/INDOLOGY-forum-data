 This work re. the massacre of 8000 Jainas states: "[King] Arikesari
Parankusa Maravarman, is also described as having first persecuted Shaivas
... he [ the Shaiva saint ] had escaped Jaina attempts to kill him. Unlike
the Muslim persecutions, this Shaiva-Jaina conflict was clearly not a
one-way affair."

 In other words, the author does not contest that 8000 Jainas were
killed, but claims that this was in reaction to persecution of Shaivas by
Jainas. Another URL which might be helpful is Hadwa Dom's book :

http://dalitstan.org/journal/brahman/mohr/mohr4.html

though this seems to be a pro-Shaiva work - he claims Sasanka was an
astik Smarta and not a nastik Shaiva. Indeed, it appears from the URL that
the Shaivas were more tolerant than Buddhists or Jainas, who were in
turn more tolerant than Vaishnavites and Vaidiks. Does anyone have any
data to back that assertion up ?
