SV: creation of human kind
 The Alvar's words: "pArttan2 tan2 tEr mun2 nin2RAn2ai" -
It means "the guy who stood in front of Arjuna's chariot".
It simply means Krishna as Arjuna's Charioteer.
To read "the one who stood on top of Arjuna's chariot in the front"
we need different phrases: eg.,
           1) "pArttan2 tan2 tErkkaN mun2 nin2RAn2ai"
           or,
           2) "pArttan2 tan2 tEril mun2 nin2RAn2ai"
           or,
           3) "pArttan2 tan2 tErmEl mun2 nin2RAn2ai"
These cases are totally absent in Alvar's pAsuram (poems).
Are they 'vERRumait tokai'?
  Explicitly, it cannot be assumed this way. Tamil Cases
  like "il" or kaN" or the word "mEl" are absent.
