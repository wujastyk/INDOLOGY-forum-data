This is an old chestnut.  As I can recollect, what actually happned
was this:  The Church had independently by the time of Galileo begun
cautiously to accept the Copernican view.   The pope was consulted at
the time and it was decided that if Galileo included a mention of the
possible alternative/traditional view he would have had the blessing
of the Church.   The pope wrote something for Galileo who in his
arrogance ridiculed the pope -- he labelled the person supposed to be
giving those views "simplicio" -- idiot, in modern parlance.  This so
incensed the pope as a direct insult, permission to publish was
withdrawn and Galileo was ordered to "recant".   The matter was
therefore less of a question doctrinal heresy than a clash of
personalities, typified by two arrrogant people who both thought they
were right.

Best wishes,
