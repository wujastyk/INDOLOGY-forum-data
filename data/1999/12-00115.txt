The question is does caste exploitation have anything to with this?
I would say the answer is resoundingly, yes. The fact that brahmins
do not directly exploit dalits does not mean they have no part in
this exploitation.  In fact, they benefit indirectly from this
exploitation by their position in the modoern caste hierarchy, which
they were instrumental in formulating.
