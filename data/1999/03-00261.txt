Indian onager
In kannada, donkey is 'katte';in tamil, it is 'kazutai'.
The neck in kannada is 'kattu' & in tamil, 'kazuttu'.
Are the words for 'neck' and 'onager' related?
Because 'katte' (donkey) is connected to the cart thru'
its 'kattu' (neck)? Wondering if the k>g or g>k changes observable
in telugu and kannada for words meaning 'neck' too?
