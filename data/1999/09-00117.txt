You don't seem willing to include the possibility that Jha's decipherment
might be wrong.  Is that the case?

I know that Gonzalez is a very common Spanish name (more so than Martinez)
and I'm also aware that they both share the patronymic ending -ez; however,
I'm still quite sure that some distant ancestor of mine was probably called
Gonzalo, or even Gundisaluus, but not Martin.

Sincerely,

Luis Gonzalez-Reimann
