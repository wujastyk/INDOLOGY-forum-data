"Given protection".  How?
Please be specific.

Raja.

PS:  In my opinion, the best
     "protection" that Tamil
     (or any other Indian language)
     could hope for would be if
     young people spoke it.  However,
     as you know, Tamilians in TN
     often prefer English.  However,
     it is not fashionable to
     point this out.  There are
     easier targets to shoot at.
