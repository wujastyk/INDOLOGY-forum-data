Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
I do not think the Buddhist authors concealed any Saivaite
connections because most of the quotations that are being
mentioned in support of the equivalence of Siva and
Avalokitesvara are from them.
But any such equivalence is a later developement.
A place which the most sacred to the Buddhists and
which is the abode of the Mahayanic dieties Tara
and Avalokitesvara must be primarily and originally
a Buddhist center.
