Arjuna's Despair.
Reading so many different views of Ultimate Reality in the recent discussion on Indology reminds me of Arjuna. One view of Arjuna's despair is that it arose from so many different and confliciting philosophies that arose in the post-Vedic period. Placing this despair in the context of the epic war was a convenient literary technique. The Gita then offers a resolution through its Yoga of Works and Devotion.
