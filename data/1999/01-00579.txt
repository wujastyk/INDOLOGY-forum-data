At http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/trdcd07.htm there is a draft
proposal for a 7-bit scheme covering  Devanagari, Tamil and several other
scripts.   It is still under discussion.   Eventually it is hoped there
will be an international standard for transliteration both with diacritics
and in 7-bit form.
