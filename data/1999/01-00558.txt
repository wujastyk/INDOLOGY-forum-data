Tragedy, eh ? Well, we Hindus are getting used to it. In case you
haven't noticed, Hindus are being massacred every day. But they don't
get burnt in cars - most of them don't own cars, you see..

Here are some pictures for you:

Feel free to scroll down the page. Notice that the count of victims is
far more than 3. (Oh, but they aren't Christians)

For comprehensive information about this real tragedy, check out:

Any time you want to know about real tragedies, let me know. 

Welcome to the real world of the Hindus. There's still a billion of us
alive, you know..
