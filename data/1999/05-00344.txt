Looks it might be so.

In his commentary to tirumurkARRuppaDai
stanza  178
"iruvarc cuRRiya pal vERu tol kuDi"
where kuDi = gOtram,
naccin2Arkkin2iyar says
"kuDi  kuNDin2ar, kAcipar enRAR pOlvan2a"
meaning
"gOthrams such as kuNDIn2a and kAcipa"
[page 60 of "pattuppATTu: mUlamum uraiyum"
by UVS Iyer],
where it is obvious that kuNDin2ar = kauNDin2ya and
kAcipa = kasyapa.
 Relevant to note also that kuNDikai is another word for the
kamaNDalam or the small pot  that rishis and brahmins typiclly carried.

Another interesting word for that found in another  pattuppATTu poem
is "karaNDai":
"An2Ru aRintu aDaGku aRiJar ceRintan2ar nOn2mAr
....iTTu vAyk karaNDai"... (maturaik kAJci: 482)

Any relationship between kuNDa and karaNDai?

Regards,
Chandra
