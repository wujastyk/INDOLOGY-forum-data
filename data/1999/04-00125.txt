History of Debate
KAli's DhAsa is KAlidhAsa. I don't think there's any reference to his
real name anywhere, from which one could deduce whether he was a
smArtha or not. And VedAnta can hardly be restricted to smArthas
alone.
But that he was a brAhmana, there's little doubt, when one reads his
works. He is all for the varnAshrama dharma. Wasn't he the one who
said, "Born a brAhmana, initiated a dvija, having learnt the shruti
(VedA) - a shrotraya, and when vibrating with knowledge - a viprata."
