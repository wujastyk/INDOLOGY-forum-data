Millennium
Dear indologist,
Many best wishes to you for the new millennium. I find it a humbling
thought that Sanskrit in a recognizable form was also in active use at the
last three millennial junctions (-1000, 0, +1000).
Please note that the INDOLOGY web site will be offline for a few days
from today until the morning of 4 January.  University College London is
shutting down all but the most essential services.
As far as I know, the INDOLOGY listserv service will continue through this
period.  But please do not fret if there are interruptions or delays.
Have an enjoyable day on the 1st!
All the best,
Dominik
