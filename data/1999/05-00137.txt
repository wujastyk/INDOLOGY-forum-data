Visistadvaita Vedanta etc.
     Didn't F. Hardy write a paper something like:
     "Madhavendra Puri, a link with south indian vaishnavism".
     Is there a temple, a subshrine that is old enough
     to Alvars, Andal, etal.,? Sure, Dr. V. Narayanan
     would know.

I would like to know if you or members of your devotional community
trace any spiritual lineage to somebody like Ramanuja. If so, who are
the links in this chain? Since you mentioned AzvArs in one of your
earlier postings, among the Agarwals  how widespread is the knowledge about
AzvArs?
