Am getting a bit confused - who smears and who's smeared here?

That infamous Aryan enthusiast Adolf Hitler in the role of smearing matter
(Kal Jug type of total-astra) seems to be left kinda masterless and is made

Some reflexions on that?

Lastly, a question that may interest also other members of the List: what
was the traditional Indian equivalent of this kind of ultimate debate
weapon(s)?
