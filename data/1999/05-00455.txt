The Kadambas were a distinct dynasty, who began with Mayurasarman or
Mayuravarman. The traditional lore is that this first king was a brahmin. He
got into a fight with the Pallavas and established his own kingdom on the
western coast. Later kings used only the kshatriya surname varman, but
Mayura is referred to both as sarma and as varma. Whether or not the
Kadambas were related to the Cheras is unknown.
