    muraja is an important drum attested early on. It is not
   restricted to South India alone. The incorporation of tamil
   muracam as sanskrit muraja from ancient times adds strength
   to the theory that once Dravidian was spoken widely in North India.
   Telugu has morayu as equivalent to ta. muracam.

   Another example from the music terms: Take muralI, muralIdhara,
   muralikrishna, etc.,  Compare with Tamil words, muralvu = soft
   sound, muralutal = to make sound, to sing, muraLi/murali =flute,
   pipe. Aapastamba zrautasuutra mentions Tamil lutes (Witzel,
   8-feb-96). Does any professional scholar work on Indian
   musicology/dramaturgy with good training in Tamil and Sanskrit
   texts?
