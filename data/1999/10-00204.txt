Subject: Roman Numerals---Three Different Answers

None of these three is correct.  The Roman numeral system uses the
principles of both subtraction and addition.  The basic symbols are:

I  = 1
V  = 5
X  = 10
L  = 50
C  = 100
D  = 500
M  = 1000

Thus 986 should be:

CMLXXXVI

(1000-100) + 50 + (3 x 10) + 5 + 1
