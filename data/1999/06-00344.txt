Subject: Hindu Nationalism & Advaita

While on the subject, may I also point out one more thing? The Hindutva
brand of nationalism owes very little to advaita philosophy or to
contemporary advaitins. Those who think otherwise should perhaps interview
the Madhva, Ramanandi and Gorakhpanthi monks who are at the forefront of the
Masjid-Mandir controversy and other VHP activities today.
