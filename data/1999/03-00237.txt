I would like to thank all respondents to this discussion  ( I, personally,
not a Dravidian specialist, I learned a lot.)
For those who are interested in these questions  I suggest the very
comprehensive and useful summary and overview of studies in (mosty, South)
Indian place name by
M.N. Nampoothiry, Indian Toponymy. A critical evaluation of the work done
in this field in India with a bibliography
in: Puthusseri Ramachandran and K. Nachimuthu (eds.)
Perspectives in Place Name Studies : Proceedings of the National Seminar on
South Indian Place Names, Held at Trivandrum on 21-23 June 1985. A
Festschrift to Prof. V.I. Subramoniam, On His Sixtieth Birth Day.
Trivandrum : Place Name Society, 1987. p. 1-47.
This book also includes including a good bibliography, also of unpublished
Indian PhD theses.

(Nothing on our specific problem, as far as I see)
