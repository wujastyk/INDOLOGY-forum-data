Request to Indologists
Respected Indologists,
I am a Ph.D. student in the University of Pune, the Department of Sanskrit
and Prakrit Languages. I am working on 'A Critical Survey of Modern Sanskrit
Dictionaries' for my Ph.D. The aim of this thesis is to attempt the
formulation of lexicographical principles o Sanskrit Dictionaries.
I am hereby forwarding one questionnaire to all of you who are involved in
the study of Sanskrit in some way or the other in order to know the readers'
views about Sanskrit - English dictionaries which will help me to draw some
guidelines for Sanskrit dictionaries.
Please forward this to all those who are engaged in the Study of Sanskrit.
Thanking you in advance,
Sincerely,
Uma Deokar
