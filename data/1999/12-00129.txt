ThirujnAnasampandar and JainAs
Could you make your effort worthwhile by using better formatting like
indentations and smaller (rather much smaller) paragraphs please?
..
If you are referring to the so-called Kaladi Adhi Shankaracharya, you must be
mistaken. Are you asserting that he was extant ca.1-2 century CE, instead of
the standard 8-9th century CE period assigned to him which is a few centuries
after Sambandhar?
