Aurobindo about Advaita
Weaterners popularizing Gita, Advaita and Sankara really stuck.
Look at Sankara's popularity with that of Abhinava Gupta.
Abhinava who created new fields in Sanskrit with theories/commentaries
on rasa/natya/dhvany/kashmir saivism etc., remains closeted
in a small circle. But, Sankara fills in well for nationlist/political
agendas.
