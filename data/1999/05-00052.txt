Etymology of Skt. rAma (part 1 of 2)

If I remember right, the word rAma or a close cognate occurs in Avestan
also. Surely, etymological exercises tracing Dravidian roots for Skt words
have to account for similar words in other I-Ir and IE family languages.
Note also that Krishna's elder brother, (bala)rAma is not particularly
mentioned as dark-skinned. Nor is the the other rAma with the ax, son of
jamadgani.
