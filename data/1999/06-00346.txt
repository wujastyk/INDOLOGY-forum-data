Well, if you look at the contemporary scene, there is lot more Western
interest in Abhinavagupta and Tantric studies than in Sankara and
Vedanta. Tantra with its traditional concern with power will also fill
in quite admirably for political purposes. It remains to be seen how
Indians re-appropriate Abhinavagupta. >>>
Well, the hope is Westerners should pave the way for things
Dravidian to be recognized as important in the formation of India.
Eg., in IVC. Then, it is only natural that Indian recognition will
follow suit.
