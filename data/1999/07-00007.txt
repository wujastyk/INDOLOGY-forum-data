In your rather luddite rant above,  you _seem_ to be only considering the possibility that
the male is incapable of producing offspring.   I don't know your awareness of modern
fertility methods,  but suffice it to say that it has helped a lot of couples I know in the
US and in India  suffering from "unexplained infertility" i.e. where both the male and
female check out fine...  and many other women who are temporarily unable to bear children
because of  endometriosis,  ovulation problems,  etc.  In many cases,  the procedures
involved were straightforward medical ones deserving none of the hoax or religious
perversion characterizations stated above.

I know you are comparing ancient niyoga to modern fertility,  but if you wanted to be
oh-so-humanistic,  why not just suggest straight adoption ?
