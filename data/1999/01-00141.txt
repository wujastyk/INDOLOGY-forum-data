Sanskrit translations in Nazi hands

Jung and Campbell? Jung is precisely the psychologist who documented, in a
short series of articles based on his findings with German patients, the
rise of a collective psychological disturbance north of the border, which he
identified as fundamentally unbalanced and unhealthy (this manifested itself
in dreams in which the 'blond Bestie' figured). He compared this development
to the increasing prominence of an archetypical type of which the Nordic god
Wodan was an illustration, and he was not at all pleased with all this.
Jung explains why. (Sorry, since I do not have my Jungs with me, I cannot
give anything like a precise reference. I do recall that the '(anti-)Nazi'
articles were translated into English too in a separate, slim volume with a
vague title like 'Thoughts on Tendencies in Our Time' or something, and one
of them was titled (something like) 'The Return of Wodan'.)
Je pense que non.
