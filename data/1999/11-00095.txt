bones and flesh
Thanks for your message.  I was already aware that "flesh coming from the
mother and bones from the father" is found in Tibetan medical texts.  I
also think that Levi-Strauss mentioned this in reference to other groups in
Central Asia.
However, I am curious to see if it can be found in any shamanic texts or in
any hindu (whatever "hindu" means) text in South Asia.  I should have
specified that at this point, my interest is for such an occurence in Uttar
Pradesh or in the Himalaya, in a non-tibetan community.  For instance, the
fact that it is a view held by Santal groups in Orissa is difficult to
relate to a direct tibetan influence.  It could, however, imply a old (2000
yrs ago?) buddhist influence on Santal religion... (???)
Another related question could be : should this idea be considered
"buddhist", "hindu" or "pre-buddhist" and/or "pre-hindu" ?
Thanks again for your reply!
