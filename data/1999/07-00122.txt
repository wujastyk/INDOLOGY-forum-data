Q: Looking for Sanskrit Texts
The ;siva-sa.mkalpa-suukta for which the inquirer is looking probably
refers to the noble and perceptive mantras found toward the end of the
Maadhyandina recension Yajurveda. Please look for lines such as the
following:
yaj jaagrato duuram udaiti daiva.m tad u suptasya tathaiveti /
duura.mgama.m jyoti.saa.m jyotir eka.m, tan me mana.h ;siva-sa.mkalpam astu //
Vishvabandhu's Vaidika-padaanukrama-ko;sa gives the following references
for ;Siva-sa.mkalpa which I have not had time to verify: Khila 4.11.1-13,
Maadhyandina 34.1-6, Kaa.thaka 33.1.1
