Conversions Hindu-Christian and Christian-Hindu
Dear Indologists,
In the wake of violences committed against Christians in India today (I
have a list of 113 and more incidents available to whoever interested
to read them), probably we could contribute to clarify textually the
Hindu point of view on conversions from one religion to the other. Why
does Hinduism does not seek to preach its dharma to the others? It is
an evidence that the Hindus - except for the Hare-Krishnas- are all
only from the Indian races; the Buddhists on the other hand have have
gone out of India and  inculturateded many races and cultures of the
world. Apparently there is no <italic>?lan missionnaire</italic> in
Hinduism. And on what doctrinal grounds can a Hindu oppose to
conversions to Christianity?  Refreces to indological texts are
welcome. A. Nayak
