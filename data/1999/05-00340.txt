tradition there. From contemprorary (or near contemporary accounts like
those of Pt. Lekhram), we discern that he encountered traditional reciters
of Samaveda at Alwar, of Rigveda at Jaipur, of Yajurveda/Rigveda at
Anupshahr in UP etc. I donot know if any recitors survive in these cities
today.

Vishal
