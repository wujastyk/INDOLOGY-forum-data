 My observation is that Indian programmers far outnumber those
 from Mainland China. Atleast in the USA.

 I am well aware of the piracy in Taiwan and Mainland. That is
 mainly copying into CDs. What about software code writing? Do they
 exceed India? Magazines say Bangalore is the Silicon valley of Asia.
