       As for the most important discovery of recent years, the triple
circular city of Arkaim ("Tripura" in the South Ural), I am sure there must
be some publications in Western languages by the excavator: ZdanoviC.
Unfortunately, I cannot give any exact references.
        Best regards,
                                                Yaroslav Vassilkov
