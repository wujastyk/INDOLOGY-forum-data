Hello

had no similiar problem so far.

</color>I have no XiYuJi handy but basically it just means the chapter has no
relation to  Xuan Zang as a person and his travel and it had to be made
out of other  sources. I do not think any of the current Chinese scholars
believe XZ went as  far as to South India. When I will have chance I
will try to look the references  about the forgery proves.

</color>Just for your interest, when I hear the name of this mountain shorten as
above,  the first what appear in mind in relation to Chinese Buddhism
is the Buddhist  island off the coast near Shanghai in Zhejiang called
Pu Tuo Mountain (Pu3  Tuo2 Shan1)
PU3 means universal - it is read in cantonese POU2 and in Korea it is
read PO.  In Bael's transcription it will be p'u.
TUO2 also read DUO4 means rough terrain. It is part of the word
Fuo2 Tuo2  (Chinese transcription of Buddha) (or part of the word
AMiTuoFuo - Amitabha).  It was used in Chinese Buddhist writing to
transliterate the Sanskrit ta, da, and  dha, <FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger>sounds. <FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>In Bael's
transcription it would be written <FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger>t'o and tuo resp.
<FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>Shan means hill.
I think this island and not the mountain in South India is what will
appear in the  mind of any Chinese Buddhist when he will hear the
name above.
There are many many other small islands with name ending Shan-
mountain  around PuTuo Shan, it would be possible some of them
is called Malaya Shan.
By the way you can see how difficoult it is to guess the original
word from the  todays Chinese pronounciation of Ancient words, for
example Fuo2Ta3 is  mandarin transcription of stupa. TA3 is read
in Cantonese TO4 and in Korean  THA
