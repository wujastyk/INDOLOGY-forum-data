Munda kinship pattern
Noted several references from puranas,etc., where South Indian
marriage systems prevailed in North India in ancient times.
The cross-cousin marriages in Krishna, Buddha, ... life stories.
Do the Munda tribes also follow Dravidian kinship terms, marriage
systems, ..? References please on Munda kinship, something like
T. Trautmann's Dravidian kinship. Need also kinship studies on
Mon-Khmer folks.
