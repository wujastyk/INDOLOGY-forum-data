Q: mAyA
It is worth noting a large set of cognates in the sense of blackness,
confusion/delusion, and barrenness in Dravidian:
DEDR 4706: maya, mayakku, mayarvu, macakkam = bewilderment, confusion;
       Te.maitu = deception, deceit, delusion; an enchanting powder
       Kur. mAyA = arrack (intoxicating liquor) made of rice
DEDR 5101: mA, mai, masi, maji, majji = dark pigment, blackness.
DEDR 5102:  Ta. mai, Ma. mai, Ko.may, To. moy, Tu.  = barrenness
Is the sense of "barrennes"  to do with "black magic" or  "making
things disappear"?
Ta. mai pOttup pArttal = to discover hidden treasure, et.c, by using
magic pigment.
An interesting pattern is that derivation from PDr.*mA or PDr.*mai
in  the Dravidian family seems to frequently involve the consonants -y-
or -s- or -j- after the word initial "ma(i)" or "mA".
DEDR# 5101:
Ta. mai = collyrium for the eye, ink, ink-paste, black pigment,
 black, blackness, darkness, spot as of moon, blemish, dark cloud;
fault, sin, dirt.
Ma. mai = blackness, antimony
To. moy- = to become dark,...
Ka. masi = dirt, ...the black of culinary vessels, soot, ..ink...
Kod. masi = charcoal
Tu. maji = coal, black powder, ink.
Kor. majji = soot
Te. masi
Nk. mas
Go. masi
Kur. mais
Also:
DEDR 4781: mA = blackness:
Ta. mA = black;
Ta. mAmai = blackness;
Ta. mAyavan, mAyan = Vishnu;
Ta.mAyOL = dark-cloured woman, woman of dark brown color;
Ta. mAl = blackness,..Vishnu;
Ta. mAlai = evening;
Ko.mangmangn = (of the eyes) blurred from looking at an object for a
long time, (of a colour) not a pure primary colour
Ka. mAsu = to gorw dim;
Tu. mAnka =darkness;
Te. mAgupaDu, Te.mAguDu,  Te.mAgilu;
Pe. MAcka, mAjga;
Kui. mAsu;
Kur. mAxA;
Malt.mAqu;
Br.maun
It is also interesting to note the CT epithets "mAyavan" or "mAyOn"
for Krishna and associations with him of episodes involving
magic and trickery. His stealing of nappin2n2ai's (lakSmi's) garments
and jewels on the banks of tozun2ai (yamunA?) may be significant here.
