and commentators of the VP.." From this, if we take TIKa to be from
about 10th century AD, how many years (5 centuries?) earlier was VP
written ? What are the currently accepted dates for vAkyapadIya and
TIkA? If the intervening period was long, could it be that
the identification of tiliGga was a mistake made on the basis of
similarity in names? Since I do not have access to some of the
critical references, any information from the list will be appreciated.

   About six-seven centuries separate vAkyapadIya and its TIkA
if we assume a 5th century date for VP.

See p. 40, H. G. Coward, K. Kunjunni Raja,
Ency. of In. Phil., The philosophy of the Grammarians,
"BhartRhari apparently never wrote a commentary for Ch. 3.
At present only HelArAja's TIkA (c. A.D. 1050-1100) is available".
