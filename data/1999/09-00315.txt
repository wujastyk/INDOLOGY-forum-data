Subject: Correction to post Sanskrit words ending in cerebral N
Message-ID: <161227052381.23782.8201069282490505710.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,

Apologies.

In my post "Sanskrit words ending in cerebral N, where I wrote "palatal"
that of course should have been "cerebral" and should have been as follows:

>(Harvard-Kyoto convention used in the following)
>
>Whitney in his Grammar (section 143. first paragraph) says "the [cerebral]
>N
>is allowed [as a permitted final] but is quite rare;"
>
>MacDonell in both his Sanskrit Grammar for Students and his Vedic Grammar
>for Students (section 27. both books) says that cerebral N does not occur
>as
>a permitted final.

>Do any of the list members know if there are actually any Sanskrit words

>MacDonell who published after Whitney would explicitly exclude them?

>As an aside Prof. Deshpande in saMskRtasubodhinI page 109 in describing

>after  a short vowel, and before any vowel.")
