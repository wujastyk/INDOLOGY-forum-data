writes :
The term pAtaJjalam, when it refers to a branch of learning in Sanskrit
literature, generally refers to the pAtaJjalaM yogaSAstram, rather than the
pAtaJjalaM mahAbhASyam. As South Indian Inscriptions Volume 14 is not
available to me at home, it is not clear to me if the interpretation of
pAtaJjalam as the mahAbhASyam is A.S. Ramanatha Ayyar's, or S.
Palaniappan's. What is the justification for the interpretation pAtaJjalam
= pAtaJjalaM mahAbhASyam for this inscription?
