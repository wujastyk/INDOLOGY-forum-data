If the linguist feeds a mathematician things as constants or things
similar to
constants which are really assumptions then you get linguists using bad
methods.
I should note that many linguists today do not use reconstruction or use
it sparingly
including Greenberg, Ruhlen and many of the Nostraticists.
However, if you have problems with some of Hubey's arguments, many of
them use the same
logic as those posed by Ringe (in his attacks on Greenberg). Maybe you
could identify what
specific problems you have with his assertions?
Also, give me a "proof" on any sound change law. I note that observation
is *not* accepted as
a valid proof on this list and probably rightfully so.
