At the risk of nit-picking, maybe I should add that (a) Madhva's notion
of maayaa differs from the Advaitic, to such an extent that he wrote a
text titled _Maayaavaadakha.n.dana_ (i.e., a refutation of Advaitic
illusionism); (b) only one of three categories of jiivas is termed
nityasa.msaarin (the other two being muktiyogya and tamoyogya);
(c) this 'jiivatraividhya' is considered simply the way things are, and a
notion of 'cruelty' is a projection of human sentiments where they are
not appropriate (this kind of explanation is also found in other theistic
traditions).
The question of a first cause could also be explained away in a
similar manner as (c). Perhaps not intellectually satisfying, but it's a
possibility.
