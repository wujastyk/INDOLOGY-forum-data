The Aryans (again); 19th century discourse.
Sn. Subrahmanya writes:
   (The last statement is higly racist.)
   Note that Andronov has explained this a full three decades
   before Indigenous Aryans started fighting with Mueller
   dead for a 100 years.
   Languages spread by elite dominance strategy. Look at
   Spanish spreading as "prestige" language in Latin America.
   Indo-Europeans have been successful in spreading their
   IE language on native populations. Hittites, Greeks, Celts
   did spread their language on the natives. The Aryans did the same
   thing.
   For a start of the substratum influence:
   a) A. F. Sjoberg, The Dravidian contribution to the
   Development of Indian Civilization: A call for a
   Reassessment.
   Comparative Civilizations Review, v.23, p.40-74, 1990
   b) A. F. Sjoberg, The impact of Dravidian on Indo-Aryan:
   An overview,
   in Edgar C. Polome, Reconstruction of Languages and Cultures,
   1992, p. 507-529
   c) J. C. von Munkwitz-Smith, Substratum influence in
   Indo-Aryan grammar, PhD dissertation, 1995, U. Minnesota.
   Studies on bilingualism, pidginization, languistic cahnge,
   IA retroflexion, Indian place names, linguistic masks
   for power and internal colonialism are relevent too.
   Hope in the near future, linguists take up the study
   of how linguistic change to IA was done.
