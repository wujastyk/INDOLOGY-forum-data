Continuing the review of Passions of the Tongue
N Ganesan writes :
But it is a noun - the origin of which might be from anywhere. That's why I
asked Tamizh scholars to give evidence whether 'ha' is part of the original
Tamizh language not used as a noun.
Possibly? That doesn't prove much. And even if 'kalaham' is
indeed derived from the Tamizh 'kalagam', there's no reason
to believe that 'ha' is also derived. And AFAIK, pure Tamizh
doesn't use 'ha'.
How does it matter whether I or you say it? The sheer fact
that kannagi is actually kanna(h)i, seems to imply it.
And how is it that you're now using kannaki instead of kannahi,
which you so obviously preferred before?
For all you know, CilapathikAram might actually be based on an
original JainA text in Samskrutam and hence Illangovadigal
in his adaptation might have used the original name of the
heroine.
If you want to bolster your argument, it would be better
to come up with proof that 'ha' was actually in use
in ancient Tamizh.
