Realism  of  RAmAnuja
Dear Mr. Hebbar,
No, the Indian realist/idealist debate in general doesn't really engage me,
though of course I am aware of it. It is in Ramanuja's position that I am
particularly interested. I look forward to seeing whatever materials you may
have on this. Thank you.
Regards,
Martin Gansten
