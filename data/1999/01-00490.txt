Consciousness in visishtadvaita
Dear Mani,
Thank you; that is very encouraging. I have the greatest respect for van
Buitenen's knowledge of Ramanuja's works -- this is the first time I have
felt compelled to differ from him -- but I did feel that his views on this
matter were somewhat one-sided. I'm glad to hear that I'm not alone in this.
All the best,
Martin Gansten
