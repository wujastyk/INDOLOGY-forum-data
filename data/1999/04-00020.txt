Pots
        If anyone can help, I'm looking for information in general about the use
and significance of pots in Hinduism, in tantra, mythology, and ritual.  In
particular, I need information about pots in Maharashtra as I'm doing a
project on Namdev and Gora the Potter.  I'm searching for, among other
things, discussions of the gaTasthApan ritual of Navaratra or any ritual
moments in Maharashtra involving pots.
        Thanks in advance.
