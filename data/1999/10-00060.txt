Subject: Units used in the Sulbasutras
Message-ID: <161227052769.23782.5379296701058513394.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list-members,

I have here a list of units of length used in the Sulbasutras.  Can
anyone shed some light on the following question: how many of
them are defined in relation to the human body?  I now know that
angula and pada are a thumbs breadth and the length of a foot
respectively.  Also a puruSa is the height of man standing upright
with his arms stretched upwards.  What about the rest?

List follows:

 angula
 kSudrapada
 prAdeza
 pRthA
 uttarayuga
 pada
 ISA
 akSa
 yuga
 jAnu
 zamyA
 bAhu
 prakrama
 aratni
 puruSa
 vyAma
 vyAyAma
 aNUka
 Uvasthi
 vitasti

Any help will be appreciated.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
