email addresses?
In principle, everybody working at the University of Helsinki has the same
simple type of address, which in this case will be
Bertil.Tikkanen at Helsinki.Fi. If this does not work, I can always forward a
message to Bertil (with whom I am sharing an office). But during July it is
very difficult to reach anybody in Finland as this is the major holiday
season (I am myself here for the first time after more than two weeks).
