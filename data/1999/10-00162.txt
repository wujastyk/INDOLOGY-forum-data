Raas Lila
Fellow Indogisists:
The central episode of the Bhagavata Purana and especially of the tenth chapter, is the Raas Lila. This has considerable aesthetic and religious implications. While the influence of the Tamil poets, both secular and sacred (Aham and Alvar), is well known, were there any other influences that have shaped this Purana? For instance did the Sufis or the Tantrics shape the Raas Lila in any way?
I will be grateful for any comments.
