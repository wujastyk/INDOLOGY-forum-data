Persistence of Buddhism in South India (was Advaita-Chandran)
Dear Dr. Rabe,
Four years ago, when Dr. R. Nagswamy was visiting me,
he told that they opened a room in the British museum, London.
He said there are many Buddhist bronzes from Tamilnadu
which remain unpublished. He also told that these bronzes
can be dated upto 17th century.
P. Pal in a book (Sensuous immortals??) has published a
nice Maitreya. A beautiful Imperial Chola period bronze.
Without seeing the stupa in the forehead, it will look
like a standing 'Siva. (will give the reference soon).
Regards,
N. Ganesan
