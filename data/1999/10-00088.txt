Q: intervocalic -k- preserved as intervocalic -g-
Some examples from Lists of Dravidian loans in Sanskrit
where Dr. -k- between two vowels is changed into a -g-, please.
Do Dr. akatti > agastya and ta. akil > agaru/aguru belong to this
phenomenon? Also, amongst Dravidian languages, words
where ta. -k- between vowels is -g- elsewhere, eg., in Telugu or in
Kannada.
Thanks for any help,
N. Ganesan
