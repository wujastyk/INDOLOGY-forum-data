Pandiyan inscriptions. From ancient times, the Pandiyan kings were known as
"ten2n2avar" or "ten2n2ar" (southern ones)  the singular form being
"ten2n2avan". And Pandiyan royal officials had the pre-fix title "ten2n2avan"
conferred on them. For instance, the zaivite saint mANikkavAcakar who was said
to be a minister of the Pandiyan king bore the title "ten2n2avan
piramarAyan2". The land ruled by them was called "ten2 pulam" (southern
land/region) or "ten2 nATu" (southern country). The "potiyil" mountain
(potalaka) is in the Pandiyan country. In fact Pandiyan king was called
"ten2n2am poruppan2" or the one of  southern mountain. potiyil was also called
"ten2 malai" or southern mountain. Compare this with the  usages in Sanskrit.
According to Monier Wiiliams, dakSiNAcala is the malaya mountain which is
another name for potiyil.
