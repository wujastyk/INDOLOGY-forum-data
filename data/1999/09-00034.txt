Respected Mr. Fosse,
I am not at all satisfied with your response. How dare you even accuse me of
such a thing? Have you yourself not made scurrilous remarks against a fellow
listmember's wife in June? I donot even know where Dr. Thompson lives and
what he does. I wonder why the criticism is directed at Dr. Rajaram since he
is merely the reviewer of a book. If anything, the criticism should have
been directed at Dr. Elst whose book was the only debatable point here. On
the merit of the AIT debate, why not do a search on the List archives using
names like 'raoul', 'vidynath', 'ebryant', 'kalyan', 'sns' and see what
merit there is in the AMT/AIT model?
I am certainly not a card holding member of any Sangh Organization. Yet,
while your criticism of them is totally unwarranted (must be due to reading
secondary sources and not field work), you still have to need to take a leap
of faith to imagine that I would threaten a person if my view happens to
tally theirs! (To me, the White race does not have a good reputation). In
fact, I would now request the Listmaster to remove YOU from the list. I am
posting a PART of your response on the list.

I'll get right to the point (and not publish this answer on Indology, since

As stated here, the wording is slightly different from the way it was quoted
by
Vassilkov. However, you are not really off the hook. The phrase that I have
marked by ** can, in my opinion, only be construed as a veiled threat,
particularly in the context of the present debate because the use of threats
and intimidation are part and parcel of Sangh family tactics. You may not be
a
member of any Sangh family organisations, or sympathize with them
politically,
but the views you hold on AIT are certainly not much different from theirs,
and
consequently use of threatening language will immediately bring to the mind
the political tactics used by the Sangh. I am afraid that you will not get
an
apology this time. I have no compunction about offering apologies when I
realize that I have been wrong, but this time I feel that my reaction was
justified. I was on the verge of suggesting that you get thrown off the list
permanently, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and let it go,
particularly since George Thompson in an email to me takes a milder view of
your wording than I do."
