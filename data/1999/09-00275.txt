Indology list.
I, too, find these issues more important than acrimonious debates about
you-know-what. It seems they should fall within the scope of this list.
However, if they do not, maybe a separate forum, perhaps called _Indological
Publishing_ would be in order? It could deal with all facets of the process:
1) Computers: fonts, keyboard layouts, operating systems, transliteration
standards, etc.
2) Sources: locating critical (and other) editions, locating previous
translations, resolving copyright questions, etc.
3) Translations: requesting and receiving help with difficult passages, etc.
4) Other: perhaps also a meeting place for translators, authors, publishers,
editors, etc.
Excluded would be all topics extraneous to preparing and publishing
Indological works.
That's my two cents for now.
