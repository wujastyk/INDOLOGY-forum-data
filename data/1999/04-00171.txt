According to the International Food Policy
Research Institute at:
http://www.cgiar.org/IFPRI/divs/eptd/dp/2dp33.htm  ,
"Poverty in rural India has declined substantially in recent decades. The
 percentage of the rural population living below the poverty line
 fluctuated between 50 and 65 percent prior to the mid-1960s, but then
 declined steadily to about one third of the rural population by the
 early 1990s."

According to today's Financial Times at:

"The annual rate of inflation fell sharply by
 0.44 percentage points to 4.60 per cent in the first week of
 1999-2000 on cheaper non-food articles and food products."
We don't have much (yet).  We don't
have much oil either.  So the choice
at this time is between nuclear waste

In real life, we are often confronted by
more than one problem simultaneously.
Then one has to do something about all
of them.

PS:  I don't think this is relevant to
     the Indology list.
