Paishaacika Sanskrit?
Dear list members,
I recently came across a reference to an astrological text said to be
written in 'Paishaacika' Sanskrit. Monier-Williams lists 'paishaaca' or
'pishaaca-bhaa.saa' as a term used in drama for 'a corrupt dialect or
gibberish; spoken by demons on the stage'. Does anyone have any information
on the origin of this term, and what grammatical and/or stylistic
characteristics it may imply? (Unless it simply means 'devilishly bad
Sanskrit', which in this case would seem a fair judgment...)
Regards,
Martin Gansten
