Before we get Palaniappan's translation ...,
here is the translation
by V.R. Ramachandra Dikshitar (1939, reprint 1978, p.193)
"(I also came to see) the beauty of the red-eyed Lord,
 holding in His beautiful lotus-hands the discus
 which is death to His enemies, and also the milk-white conch:
 (to see Him) wearing a garland of tender flowers on His breast,
 and draped in golden flowers; and dwelling on the topmost crest
 of the tall and lofty hill named VeenkaTam,
 with innumerable waterfalls, standing like a cloud
 in its natural hue, adorned with a rainbow
 and attired with lightning, in the midst of a place
 both sides of which are illumined by the spreading rays
 of the sun and the moon."
