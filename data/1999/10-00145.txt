malaiyIntu = malai+ Intu (mountain date)
ciRRIntu = ciRu + Intu (small date fruit)
Also, IJcu, Iccam all stand for Intu (date fruit) in tamil.
"Intu", spoken out as "Indu", Tamil has a tendency to
drop out initial "c" or "s". (ceTTi > eTTi etc.,)
Dravidians might have named the region with lots of date trees
as cIntu (>skt. sindhu), the river that flows thru' Sindh
is also called Sindu.
Taking Sindhu river, Burushaski could have come up with
"sinda" to mean water??
