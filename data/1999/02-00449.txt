He certainly does, but his are the populistic translation without any
criticism and references to the variants and different interpretations.

You can ask any Chinese linguist or anybody able to read the
originals of what he translates. I can give you dozens of examples
from his various books. He knows Chinese language as well as
literature but the bulky volume of his production makes it not
critical.

If anybody is interested indetails I will be glad to do it in private mail
as it is beyond the Indology scope and I would like to not bother
with it here.
