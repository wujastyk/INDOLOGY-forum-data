Suggestion for users of INDOLOGY digest
It would help me (and maybe others) if individuals did not use subject
lines like
        INDOLOGY Digest - 10 May 1999 to 11 May 1999 (#1999-55)
which doesn't tell me what the posting is about.
When responding to digest items it is probably better to use the same
subject line as the original thread so that individuals following that
thread know to read it.
