Fosse and the date of Rigveda
He Bose,
Good try. To quote the old adage: Sometimes I doubt about myself...
But I certainly doubt about N. Bose's (statements):  To quote out of
context and with slight modifications always is  'useful', and is the
oldest trick in a politician's book.
(1) all numbers ending in -000 are approximations.
(2) second, and in detail:
At 16:17 -0700 9/7/99, Namrata Bose wrote:
That is not a book but a journal, called "Studien zur Indologie und
Iranistik"  (StII, since 1975).
I wonder in which volume/article, maybe 20 years ago, I might have said so.
Anyhow I cannot check here at home.
However, a close reading of the other quotes does not contradict this
sentence  (if indeed quoted correctly which I doubt now, see immediately).
No, you  misquoted and paraphrased: footnote 199 of that paper, in my
computer, says:
"As is well known, the transmission of Vedic texts has been so
extra-ordinarily faithful that words, sounds, and even the tonal accents
went unchanged for more than 2000 years"
Note: "more than".  Nice misquote.  Also, page numbers, each time,  would
have helped.
This date refers, of course, to no. 3:
Correct (though I do not find the quote  in my papers in that book, nor
does my computer).  Sakalya 'redacted' the RV  during the Brahmana (sic!)
period, but as all specialists know, the changes codified by him then are
minimal, when compared with the Rsis' creations (suvar --> svar, etc.)  See
the retro-active changes made in van Nooten-Holland's metrical  RV (HOS
1994).
In short, there is so little real "change" that I still like the *shortcut*
description of the RV as a tape recording of  (at least ) 1000 BCE, and I
will continue to use it.
And where is the contraction in the above 3 dates, as I used them? --  Only
on the surface, in Bose's quotes. Good try. But an innocent one? Not, when
you read the conclusion:
On the lighter side:
Now I really doubt about you.
Try to bend back your tongue in "two" (as British/American speaker, I
mean).  Well, to a native Indian speaker, t-wo and th-ree are retroflexes.
Do you not know what retroflexion is? Or does your particular Bengali
dialect/idiolect have retroflexion in pronouncing "two" but not in "three"
(due to dissilimiation because of following -r-??? -- narmaartham eva)
The archaeologists, on whom we all depend here, have revised the dates
several times over the past few decades, as we all know. As as student I
read : upto 1750 BCE;
Now they tell us:  2600 -1900 BCE...
Again, nice try to blame historians, linguists etc.  etc. for the revisions
of the earchaeologists!
Congratulations!
