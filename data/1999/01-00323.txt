salil, the same question you ask is being discussed on indology. :)) a
good question.
sometimes in good ol' america, we use certain ethnic terms quite wrongly.
starting with indian, which, here, means native american. thus, the term
hindu is often used to mean the actual meaning of indian--as if to be
indian is to be hindu--an idea which makes one cringe so at its glaring
ignorance. i wonder if the descriptive 'hindu writer' was not necessarily
meant to have religious significance, but rather to have a cultural/ethnic
connotation?
ridiculous i know, but possibly true. and maybe inconsequential in light
of the issues detailed in the article.
best,
maureen.
