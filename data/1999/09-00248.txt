Subject: [Fwd:] Tamil Virtual University report
Message-ID: <161227052242.23782.5193644315612862306.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

  I am forwarding this to INDOLOGY list from www.tamil.net.
The tamil.net and the literary tamil list (agathiyar at egroups.com
managed by Dr. Jayabarathi) have interesting discussions on old India.

  Both lists use TSCII bilingual fonts. In the 256 spots,
both the regular english keyboard strokes and all the Tamil
letters are accommodated elegantly in the bilingual fonts.
This makes writing bilingual texts both in english and tamil
simple and easy.

TAMIL VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY: Report to the High-Level Committee

This is to inform Tamil.Net readers that the expanded report on the
Tamil Virtual University submitted to the Chairman of the High-Level
Committee on 3-09-1999 is now publicly accessible at this URL:

<http://xlweb.com/heritage/asian/tvu_report.htm>

http://xlweb.com/heritage/asian/tvu_report.htm

The TVU report is hyperlinked to sites of other virtual universities
and Tamil learning resource areas around the world. Kindly note that
this is an independent report and not an official document of the
Tamil Virtual University. The report, moreover, was undertaken on a
crash basis, so many centres of Tamil studies in non-English speaking
nations (like Japan, Italy or the Czech Republic) are not included
in the report. Nevertheless, the report may serve as a useful
reference tool and source of information until such time when a more
comprehensive official document is released by the
State Government of Tamil Nadu.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.

Sincerely,

Patrick Harrigan
Head of Multimedia
