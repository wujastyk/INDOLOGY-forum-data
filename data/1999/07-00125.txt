Mahabharata in the electronic format :
While going through the old stock of Indian Express (a leading
daily from India), New Delhi Edition, I noticed that there was a
mention of Dr. John Smith's work.  He has put entire Mahabharata
(BORI, Pune edition) in the electronic format.  The relevant
address is :     http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk/
Though it was incorrectly printed in the newspaper, it took me
a few minutes to find out the correct URL.
Researchers will find this of interest.
