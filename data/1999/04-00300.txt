Book review: Indus Age- the Writing System by Gregory L.              Possehl.
  Is it Rajaram's position that once Greg learns Sanskrit,
  he will say that Indus culture is Vedic Aryan? Is
  Jha's Vedic glossary of Indus seals accepted by
  Dr. Kalyanaraman?
  I heard that Possehl's manuscript was ready before
  Parpola's Deciphering the Indus script was published.
  Can someone tell me whether the book under review
  has mentioned Parpola's book, Deciphering the Indus script?
