Has anyone on the list read this book?

Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries about the Event that Changed
History. William Ryan and Walter Pitman. Simon & Schuster, New York, 1998
($25).

The June issue of Scientific American has a review on page 99 that includes
the following:

"The tale of a massive, devastating flood appears not only in the Bible but
also in other ancient writings, often in similar terms, suggesting that it
records a real and singularly memorable event. . . . the event might have
been a huge and prolonged cascade of water from the Mediterranean that broke
through a natural dam in the Bosporus Strait and plunged into what was than a
freshwater lake and is now the Black Sea. . . . dating it about 5600 B.C.
'The Bosporous flume roared and surged at full spate for at least three
hundred days,' . . . . The cascade inundated 60,000 square miles of land,
forcing the people in the region to disperse."

This was news to me. Is this theory widely known and accepted? Have any
members of the list made a study of flood accounts?
