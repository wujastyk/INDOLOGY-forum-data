On-line Yogasuutra bhaashya?
Dear Indologists,
Does anyone know if anyone has input the Sanskrit text of the Vyaasa
commentary on Patanjali's Yogasuutras?  I know that the suutras themselves
are available on-line, but I've never seen the commentary.  Is it out there
somewhere?
Thanks for any pointers.
