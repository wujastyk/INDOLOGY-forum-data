Aryavarta/bharata varsha
Dear Lars,
I think several of the articles by Madhav M. Deshpande collected in his book
_Sanskrit & Prakrit. Sociolinguistic Issues_ might be interesting for you.
(Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi 1993. ISBN 81-208-1136-4.) Especially relevant
might be _RAjazekhara on ethnic and linguistic geography of India_,
originally published in _Dr. D. N. Shastri Felicitaton Volume: Indological
Studies_, Vimal Prakashan, Ghaziabad 1982. [In the legend of Map 3 the
colors are inverted.]
Yours,
Ferenc
