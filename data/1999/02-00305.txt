I think it would only be fair
to provide Prof. Yu's exact
words, in their entirety,
without editing.  "Selection
of words" will create doubt.
Another crucial point: as you know,
Avalokitesvara/Tara/Kuan Yin
(almost more so than Buddha!)
are absolutely central figures
in "Pure Land" and Vajrayana
Buddhism.
Potalaka, as Avalokitesvara's
abode, is approx. as important
to a Buddhist as Mt. Kailasa to
a Saivite, or Vaikuntam to a
Vaishnavite.
Therefore, if Buddhists
considered Potikai/Potiyil
to be Potalaka, there must
be clear and unmistakable
evidence that **Potikai/Potiyil**
was an extremely important
Buddhist center.  Is there
such evidence?
Repeat: the evidence must show that
**Potikai/Potiyil** (not merely the
unidentified "Po-to-lo-chia") was a
very important Buddhist site.  It
is welcome to be an important Saivite
center as well.  But it MUST be a
very important BUDDHIST site.
Best wishes,
Raja.
