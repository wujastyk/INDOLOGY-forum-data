This is erroneous.  Yin and yang have stood for opposites from some of
the earliest literature to include male and female, receptive and
creative. Yin and Yang are the original creative forces from which
the entire universe evolved according to the Nei Ching (Manual
of the Yellow Emperor). A quote from Veith's translation:
"The principle of Yin and Yang is the basis of the entire universe. It
is the principle of creation. It brings about the transformation to
parenthood; it is the root and source of life and death..."
