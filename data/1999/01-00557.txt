I believe this discussion of 'parvata' = 'zriiparvata' has been most
interesting.  Are there any similar inscriptional or literary references
that take us closer to Bhart.rhari's date (appr. 5th century A.D.)?  The
reference to 'parvata' combined with the reference to 'daak.si.naatye.su
granthamaatre ...' makes the zriiparvata the best candidate.  The question
is are there other contemporary references to zriiparvata by the term
parvata.
