An apt time to talk on Children teaching Elders(ref. Fosse and Magnone posts):

Child teaching Older person(s) is present in Tamil culture
from ancient times:

1) SubrahmaNya Murugan teaching his dad, Shiva.
2) St. Jnana Sambandhar, when beaten by his father
to tell who fed him with milk, showing Siva and Parvati
to him.
In 12th century, oTTakkUttar explicitly says Campantar
is Murukan's avatAram. In Saundaryalahari, Sankara praises
Jnana Sambandhar. Is the Sankaran hagiography indebted to
Sambandhar myth (A baby teaching older folks)?
3) KarikAl Cholan legend: He dresses as an old man
and dispenses justice in the court.

Also, look at Dakshinamurti, the young adult teaching Rishis,
with their old age indicated by long beards (like Brahma),

Regards.
