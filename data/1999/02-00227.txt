VijnAnavAda  &  Dvaita
Dear Mr. Hebbar,
As you say, this argument is based on the equation of jnaana in the sense of
'consciousness' or 'cognition' with the sense of 'knowledge', i.e. 'correct
cognition'. I wonder what Madhva made of texts such as the Vishnupurana,
which speaks of bhraanti-jnaana 'erroneous cognition'? And did he agree with
Ramanuja's thesis 'yathaartham sarvavijnaanam'?
