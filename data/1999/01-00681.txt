etymology of tree name "maraam" and the geography of the mara              am t ree
I got the following from A.K. Ramanujan's
"Poems of Love and War from the Eight Anthologies
and the Ten Long Poems of Classical Tamil"
Columbia University Press
Appendix: Plant Names page 317:
English: cadamba oak
Tamil  : katampu
Latin  : Anthocephahlus Cadamba
Note that the regular English name and the Latin or botanical
names both use the original Tamil name for the tree!
