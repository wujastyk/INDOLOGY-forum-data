If the discovery of manjusrImUlakalpa in kerala makes potiyil in
tamilnadu  fit to be identified as Potalaka,
how much more will be the presence of Manjusri himself in
dhAnyakataka make Nagarjunakonda in Andhra more fit
to be called Potalaka. I have come to understand that Gandavyuha
mentions this. I do not think arguments like the above solve
the problem.

1. One has to identify which mountain out of Malaya one wants to designate
   as Potiyil.

2. One has to show that there is  archeological, textual
   evidence that Buddhist (mahAyana and vajrayana) existed there.

3. One has also to determine the earliest date from which the
   mountain is having Buddhist establishments.

4. We has to determine the earliest date from which it is referred
   to as Potalaka.

How do you know  they are foremost teachers. Did you get any additional
material on them.

In Taranatha's book there is only one sentence about Amoghvajra
and none about Vajrabodhi. About Amoghvajra there is suuplementary note
(81) describing his work. And according to Taranatha, Amoghavajra belongs to
11 th century A.D. How does this help you to establish Vajrayana in
8 th century.

Does this not actually strengthen the case for Nagarjunakonda?
