History of debate
Regarding our discussion on the identification of the SAmkhya philosopher
Ishvara Krishna with KAlidhAsa, I came across an interesting bit of
information.
The identification was actually made by one Svapneshwara in his
KaumudiprabhA (any information on the author or his works?). The words are :
"IshvarakrishnanAmnA KAlidhAsena krtah kArikAh."
