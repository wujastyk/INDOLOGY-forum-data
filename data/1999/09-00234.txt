Thanks for the clarification.
I will try to find "silappadhikaram"
in our University library and
understand who said exactly what
to whom, and in what context.
I believe that most Tamilians, if asked
to identify the main characters of
"silappadhikaram", would name
Kannagi, Kovalan, the Pandya King
(Nedunchezhiyan?), maybe the Queen,
and Madhavi, probably in that order.
I actually have no clue who Matalan
is; certainly, he is not a major figure.
I will rectify my ignorance regarding
him.  Anyway, though, drawing conclusions
about "linguistic nationalism" from one
of the least important characters in
"silappadhikaram" seems to be questionable.
More later.
