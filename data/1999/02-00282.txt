The text in question is a naa.diigrantha called Dhruvanaa.dii. It is
definitely in Sanskrit (of sorts), not Prakrit, and of South Indian origin.
I haven't the text with me at the moment, but I am working on another text
very similar in style: Gurunaa.dii. Among the typical grammatical errors,
the following may be mentioned:
        - irregular case endings and compound forms, such as 'karme' for
'karma.ni', or 'pitaa-vipat' for 'pit.r-vipat'
        - irregular (I think) words such as 'bhraatrii' for 'sister'
        - excessive and superfluous use of the endings -vat and (more
rarely) -mat, in words such as 'bhaagya-vihiina-vaan'
        - erroneous gender inflections, such as 'sukhii' for 'sukhinii' or
-vaan for -vatii.
Does anyone recognize these patterns?
