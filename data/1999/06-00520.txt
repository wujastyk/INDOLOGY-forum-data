Dear Indology members,
I am very grateful to all those who responded to my query regarding
Ajanta, particularly to Prof. Steiner for his timely and succinct
message. This is yet another proof, if further proofs were needed,
that the Indology list is a marvellous place for collegial exchange
of information.
Enthusiastically Yours, J. Filipsky
