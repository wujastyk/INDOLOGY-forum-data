I asked my wife about "Hari-dyut-astra" and "Zarathustra."  She
also failed to see the connection and made similar comments
about Frawley's etymology as you did.  Can the word "astra" even
be taken to mean "star" in Sanskrit?  "Astra" meaning "star"
seems Greek to me.  My wife said she had never seen any
connection where the word "astra" meant "star" in Sanskrit.  In
Sanskrit "astra" can be translated as "weapon."
