This suggests that the character of the script of a natural language has
a direct impact on whether or not the respective linguistic community
produces a significant amount of "advanced" computer programmers. To me,
this begs the question, as no computer programming languages I am aware
of are based on either Indic or Chinese characters anyway, so why should
that make a difference? (whether Chinese people have more or less
difficulties learning a programming language that is encoded in Roman
script is an altogether different question)
Reasons for whether or not a particular country's computer industry is
"behind" or "leading" are perhaps more meaningfully sought in the
economic/political landscape of that country, the degree to which
computers are used (and for what purpose), government support for
computer development, employment opportunities, and so on.
