        Would it be fairer to say that as character encoding standards
neither Unicode nor ISCII provide the rendering software needed to create
all the glyphs needed to create legible visual versions o fDevanagari and
other Indian scripts?  It would seem the CDAC implementation of ISCII has
such rendering software; one hopes some implementations of Unicodealso do
so now and that others will in the future.

Is this equivalent to ASCII, the American national standard for
information interchange or its international counterpart, ISO 646?
