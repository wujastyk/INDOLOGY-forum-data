The Fodder of First causes

The notion of samsara as a consequence of an act of jiva's rebellion against
Isvara is quite alien to any school of Indian thought. However, the idea of
icchA Sakti associated with jIva in a limited way is quite old. A totally
unexplored facet of early Advaita in this regard is in Suresvara's vArttika
on the Br. Up. bhAshya. See also the mAnasollAsa commentary (attributed to
Suresvara) on the dakshiNAmUrti hymn.
