True, but I don't think that is objectionable. If you know how to
pronounce Sanskrit (and there is no point in using a written text
for recitation if you do not know one of the many ways of
pronouncing it) you will soon get used to words which are not
syllables, or which end in non-syllables. Further, sandhi in
recitation may not follow the same rules as written sandhi, so you
are free to pronounce written 'tv' as 'tu' if it's more comfortable.

Unless you have a true pada text, you won't separate sequences such
as tadovAca (tadA/uvAca).

I also tried to indicate, gently, that I thought it a pointless
practice.
