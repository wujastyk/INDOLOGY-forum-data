  Hi Narayan,

  Do you have anything to disprove or counter what Drs. Ganesan and
  Palaniappan are showing from Classical Tamil and Sanskrit texts? that
  Potiyil/Potala/Malaya/dakSiNAdri played a crucial role in
  Indian culture atleast according to old Tamil as well as
  Sanskrit texts.

  First read the posts, then give a try dislodging their arguments!

  Regards,
  SM

  Note: I don't think large number of learned postings is a "sin".
  or a "problem" as you paint them to be. S/he cannot
  make others work as hard as them.
