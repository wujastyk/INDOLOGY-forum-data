econmy size
tv was broadcasting about us china trade agreements, there was mention
that china is a 4 trillion $ economy. how much is indian gdp in 1998?
range: 2 trillion or 1 trillion or 500 billion??
is this the reason why indian studies are meager compared to those about
china? many south asia grads work eventually in banks or
web design.
