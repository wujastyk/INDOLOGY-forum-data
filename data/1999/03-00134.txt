Early Ravi/Harappa phase: new discoveries
Hi,
The remarkable discoveries reported on the internet
in Feb. 1999 [Kenoyer and Meadow: http://www.harappa.com/indus2]
affirm the continuous, indigenous development of the culture
to extend to almost TWO MILLENNIA,from ca. 3300 to 1300 BC, 
starting with the Early Ravi/Harappan phase (c. 3300 to 2800 BC).
The eary date of ca. 3300 BC is corroborated by the discoveries
reported at Kunal (Puratattva). The date of 1300 BC is corroborated
by the discovery of a surface find of a seal at Bet Dwaraka,
a civilization site on the tip of the Rann of Kutch [cf. S R Rao,
Marine Archaeological exploration reports].
Scientists' views on the desiccation of the Sarasvati River
(Markanda-Ghaggar-Hakra-Nara-Wahind)reported in Vedic
Sarasvati (Feb. 1999, Geological Society of India)are consistent
with the observations of Kenoyer and Meadow about the
migration of the people from this river basin to the Ganga-
Yamuna Doab and southwards-- migrations apparently caused by the
desiccation of the river.
Is it reasonable to conjecture that the circular 'working' platforms used by
lapidaries/braziers working on lathes, with beads and inscribing on
seals/tablets, including copper tablets? [Kenoyer and Meadow conjecture that
the platforms were perhaps used to prepare indigo dye].
Would it be reasonable to hypothesise (1)the continuity of the 
Harappan culture after ca. 1300, into the historical periods 
and (2)hence, a linguistic area ca. 3000 BCE using early forms of Pali
(Sindhi-Gujarati-Punjabi-Bhojpuri)as substratum language?
