 This is NOT one, isolated, stray occurence.

 There are many more, Paul. I gave you one more this
  morning from Appar calling "Siva as Tamilian and Aryan.

 Whenever Aryan comes in Old Sangam Tamil texts, it refers
 to IA speakers. Check any Sangam text.

 I see you often write that Tamil is considered an Aryan
 language or Sanskrit's derivative. There is simply
 no evidence for this in Old Tamil texts.
