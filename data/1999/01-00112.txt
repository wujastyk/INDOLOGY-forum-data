H M Hubey:
Paanini's list of roots does note a root 'shaT' (I P.) meaning 'to be sick,
to divide, separate, to be dissolved, to be weary or dejected, to go' and a
root 'shaT' (X A.) meaning 'to praise, flatter' (Apte's Dictionary). As in
the case of many words, it is difficult to relate the root-meaning to the
meaning of the derivative in use.
I failed to understand the significance of the caution at the end of your
query.
