Dravidians and Sergent
...I do not think many are interested in the
I want to add one more to the comparison list:
The list of Sanskrit and Akkadian correspondences in:
Malati J Shendge, The Language of Harappans: From
Akkadian to Sanskrit, 1997, Delhi, Abhinav
Publications.
The list also cites Avestan equivalents.
See for example, No. 1 (p.202): Skt. asura, a name of
a god designated as the Ultimate Reality; reference to
As'ur cult in Old Akkadian tablets before Sargon (i.e.
before 2370 BC) where the city of As's;ur is mentioned
as A-s'i_r (ki)...
Of course Shendge's thesis is that the Harappans were
asurs... 
In which case, was the language Avestan-related? Was 
the direction Skt.>Av.? Is it true that the Avestan yasna 
doesn't have Dravidian substrate words?
