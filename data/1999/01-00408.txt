[ADMIN: membership cancellation] (was Re: (no subject))
Your membership of INDOLOGY is being cancelled as a result of the
commercial advertisement which you posted to the list today.  This
advertisement was not made in any relevant context, for example as a minor
part of a general answer to a scholarly query (i.e., such and such a book
has a relevant text; it is available from xxx bookseller), and was simply
a piece of business promotion.
The INDOLOGY list is absolutely not the place for promotion of business
interests, even if related to indological scholarship, and this practice
is considered a serious abuse of the list.
I will, however, continue to keep a link to your bookshop on the INDOLOGY
website, along with links to other similar bookselling services.  I am
happy for the time being to maintain a web area for online indological
bookstores, as I feel this is a reasonable service to list members, and is
something which members may seek out for themselves, rather than having it
sent to them unsolicited.
