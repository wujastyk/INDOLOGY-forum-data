No, not so.  Hinayana was called Southern Buddhism and Mahayana the
Northern as a polite euphemism by early C20th Westerners are mainly
reflects the late post-Muslim geographical regions of Buddhism.
Mahayana and indeed Tantric Buddhism flourished for a while in Sri
Lanka and was only expelled by royal decree at a late date.  Mahayana
was also very active in the present-day area of Indonesia.   There
were many Hinayana adherents in north India, Central Asia and China.
Indeed the label "Hinayana" fairly specifically refers to Kashmiri
Sarvaastivaada in Mahayana polemics.   The fact is many Mahayana
suutras were ritten in southern and eastern India.
