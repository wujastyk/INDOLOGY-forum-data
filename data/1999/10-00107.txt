Do aspirants exist at all in the tamil alphabet ? tamil speakers always mix
up the order of aspirated consonants when speaking hindi.

bhikari -- bikhari

Is there is tendency to separate all guttural and aspirated consonants by
lesser stressed consonants to ease delivery of speech and increase speed.

aspirants in the beginning of most words are also not voiced.
contrast this with the tendency of english speakers to always aspirate the
first consonant of each word. Many tamilians actually cotton on to this
feature of english pretty fast but dont do it as enthusiastically when
speaking hindi (may be because its closer to tamil in terms of euphonical
rules).

khel becomes kel wheras khar(car) is pronounced properly.

I guess different languages can throw up different requirements of euphony
based on diferent philosophies.
