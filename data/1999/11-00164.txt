It is 4 X 101, and 101 is a frequently important number, because it is
100 + 1, and round numbers such as 100, 1000, 10,000, etc. are viewed
as inauspicious, and so gifts of money e.g. to templesa are frequently
made in denominations of 101, 1001, etc.  101 Happens to be a prime
number but I'm unaware of any symbolical or other numerological
significance attributed to primes in the Indian tradition.

Does anyone recognise the number 404 as a "special" number in an
Indian
context? If so, where does it appear and what is special about it?
