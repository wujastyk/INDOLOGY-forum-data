Vaidiks & Vedic Religion
Dear Mr. Agrawal,
 Thank you for your excellent and very thorough reply. My comments and
further queries are at the places below.

This is the kind of info I wanted. Does the term `traditional Vaidiks',
mean that these people were not Arya Samajis ? If so, then this wouls mean
that the ancient Vedic religion did survive. I have always felt that the
`corrupt' Puranas, etc. could not have corrupted all followers of the
Vaidik religion, and that the Vaidik religion survived as a minority sect,
just as Jainism did.
Yes, but did they coin the term `Vaidik' ? Or is it that they sought to
revive a minority (and not a dead) religion ?
Your info on Agarwals is highly informative. I have also heard that the
Agarwals are the only `Aryan Vaisyas' left, the rest being from Gujarat,
descendants of Khazars (whence Gujjars and thus Gujarat) from South
Russia. Incidentally, the Khazars were Jews (does this have something to
do with their mercantile abilities ?).
There are 2 types of Orientalists: those who follow text-books, and those
who have `ground'-knowledge based on personal experiences. The former are
sometimes out of touch with realities; and require the know-jow of people
`on the ground'. Since my question re. the survival of Vedic religion
throughout the period of `corrupt' Hinduism goes against standard
`text-book' scholarship, I asked you. One need not feel any `inferior' if
the knowledge one has is based on ground knowledge; Sir Richard Burton,
whose knowledge of Orientalism was entirely `ground-based', was perhaps
the most renowned Orientalist ever.
Thanks,
Samar
