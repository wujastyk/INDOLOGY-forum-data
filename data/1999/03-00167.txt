Barbara Rossi, _From the Ocean of Painting: India's Popular Paintings, 1589
to the Present_ (NY: Oxford Univ Press, 1998)
wherein catalog entry no. 92 is a pulse (nadi) palm leaf mss. Citations in
corresponding footnotes are to personal communications only [including
yours truly, as an intermediary only]...so apparently nothing else has been
published in English on the subject.
Hope this helps,
