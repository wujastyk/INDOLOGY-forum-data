The seminars will entail reading selected portions of the Sanskrit version

sections in the Early Recension of that text, which is represented by (but
not identical with either of) the two earliest Chinese translations,
Taisho Nos. 361 & 362. The aim will be to follow up and clarify issues
raised in the lectures in a more detailed fashion.
