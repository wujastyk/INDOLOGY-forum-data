Martin,

It is a drastically reduced version of Gupta's reading, but my own is not
that far off. Ramanuja's God:world::self:body, i.e., the world is God's
body, with individual jivas or atmans knowing the world through their
pramanas, suggests something similar. The key category, of course, is acit.
Gupta provides numerous citations, including transcribed passages, so it is
definitely worth a look. Chitamattam is more critical of Ramanuja, but his
critiques sometimes seem off the mark (e.g. accusing Ramanuja of flirting
with pantheism, etc.).

Happy reading,
