Bricks in Vedic Sacrifice
   With reference to the query by Toke Lindegaard Knudsen concerning the
shape and size etc of the bricks used in ancient Vedic sacrifices, I just
came across a relevant article by R. P. Kulkarni entitled "Indian
Engineering" in the web page <orientalthane.com> sponsored by the Oriental
Institute, Thane, India. He might be in a better position to supply
additional information.
