>?From Kalittokai -> Alvaar Paasurams --> Sanskrit
Srivaishnava literature.
Vanamala Parthasarathy has written a long and excellent
article on Bull baiting in Tamil and Sanskrit
in the latest issue of Jl. Inst. Asian studies, Chennai.

Charles Fabri in 1930s has written a paper
on bull baiting in Crete and Indus culture.

It is important to note that in Sangam Tamil,
the word "toRu" means a bull, the head ox (poli kALai) ...
In Romance countries, "taurus" means bull.
"taurachomy" means bull baiting, ...

What is the connection between Tamil "toRu",
Indus bull baiting, and "taurus"???
