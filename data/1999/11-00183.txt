Connection between Yama, yamI and yamunA
I wrote a little unclearly:
<paraindent><param>right,left</param>There is some interesting
information on the origins of Yama in the       Prolegomena to The
Vajrabhairava Tantras by Bulcsu Siklos, published in the Buddhica
Britannica series by the Institute of Buddhist Studies in 1996.
</paraindent>
The Prolegomena is of course the introduction to the text, in the  the
book entitled "The Vajrabhairava Tantras".
There is a further article by Dr. Siklos, "The Evolution of the
Buddhist Yama" in Volume IV of the Buddhist Forum,  published by the
School of Oriental and African Studies, London in 1996 which I think
would better provide the information requested.
