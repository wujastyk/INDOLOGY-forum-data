Here is the translation of the mantra/verse. This is not expound it to anybody else but
only to give an account of my reading of that mantra:

Tva (One out of many), Eshaam (out of these), viciketat (has understood properly),
Etat (this), mantrah (mantras,meaning mantras, in plural), kavishasta (praised by
creators), Rghaavaan (inspired), Satya (and truthful).

Ugro (The brilliant knower), Caturarshri (having four-fold understanding),  Hanti
(Excels, defeats),  Devanido (those who slight or ridicule the gods), Trirashrim (and to
the three-foldness [of means] attains).  Ha (Indeed) , Prathama(the leaders [of this
sort]) , Ajuryan (do not decay).

I do not see here mantra being defined in the sense of "ultimate weapon" in debate or
even for war as a "brahmaastra". It emphasises the esoteric nature of understanding
which is  every student is not able to cultivate and thus the superiority in excellence
of the one who has arrived at it. In all ages the best "defeat" the mediocre.
The whole sukta is dedicated to mitra and varuna asking them for deeper understanding of
rta or truth.

Yes, one may  if so pleases reduce it to its grossest sense, that one who knows the
secret of using mantras can kill non-belivers by incanting them. But I think, Vedas are
not black magic.
