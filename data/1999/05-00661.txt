New list / new rules (RE: Request for Info)
Dear members of the list,
I agree with Juergen Neuss. Things have gotten to the point where the first
thing I do every morning is delete a great many messages posted by a
relatively small number of people - without reading them. I probably miss
some messages of genuine interest, but I don't have time to sort them out
from the polemics.
With best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
