I know it's not the best use of my time responding to this (and it's to
Michael Witzel's credit that he has continually taken the trouble to
educate non-specialists on this list with linguistic information), but I
feel moved to state that if there is one thing of which he can *not* be
accused, it is of lacking an open mind.  One may not share all of his
views, but I happen to know for a fact that he has taken considerable
trouble to pursue *every single* 'revisionist' or alternative viewpoint on
Indian proto-history that has shown any semblance of rationality, or that
has attempted to engage the data with any degree of earnestness.
So, please, by all means disagree with him by offering informed counter
arguments (and preferably ones that match the attention to detail that he
commands).  But don't accuse him of lacking an open mind.  Edwin Bryant
