What's the sanskrit translation for "entrepreneur" ?
Dear Sir
I am currently undertaking a research on the entrepreneur in several
Asian countries, including India.
That is why I would like to have some information about the various
names that have been used in India to designate the "entrepreneur". Is
it possible to go far backwards in time (back to the Middle Ages or even
back to Antiquity).
Thank you very much. Yours very faithfully,
Jerome Ziel
