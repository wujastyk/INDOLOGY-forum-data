Rigveda: dravidian  (?)  word bunda, boiled rice
The r.ca:
... indro bundam sva_tatam (RV 8.77.6)
Sa_yan.a: Indra smote (rain) from the clouds with his far-stretched arrow,
he secured boiled rice (for men).
I did not find a concordant lexeme for 'bundam', in Cologne Skt. lex.
The close semant. are:
pazUkhA [with -ukha_, cauldron (AV)]
f. the pot in which the sacred an?animals is cooked or roasted Ka1tyS3r.
(Skt.)
pid.ita_na_ = to boil over (Gondi); pulagamu = rice boiled with green dal
?<Skt (Telugu); pula_ka = lump of boiled rice (CDIAL 8295)pur..ukkal = cooked
rice (Tamil)(DEDR 4315)
There is colloquial Hindi: bu_ndi, the puffed fried gram dhal flour used in
laddu.
Was rice known in Rigvedic times?
