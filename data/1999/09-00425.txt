Subhash Biswas's book of last year accomplishes this to a large extent
(see Alan's email for bibl. details).

I believe you underestimate the editorial effort that goes into each entry
in NCC.  I've seen the slips, and the work that is done on them, and there
is a great deal of thought, judgement, and knowledge of literature in the
process of turning the raw catalogue-extract slips into NCC entries.  I
really don't think the raw slips would be seriously useable or useful.

However, archival filming of them might prevent them dropping to pieces
before they can be used. (The same applies to the Poona dictionary slips,
even more so.)
