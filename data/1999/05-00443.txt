Nambudiris
Dear Sir,
Thank you for the query.It is believed that the Kadamba king
Mayura(340-370A.D.) brought the Brahmins to Kerala.Since they were all
Aryans coming from the North there is possibility for Nambudiris to hail
from Maharashtra also.Sir William Logan has stated in the Malabar Manual
that the Nambudiris of Panniyur of the northern Kerala had connection with
the Chalukyas and those of Chovvara with the Rashtrakutas.Even today the
temple at Mukambika (Kollur)is  visited by the Keralites in large number.
One Nambudiri family here in Trivandrum namely Kollur Madham originally
came from Kollur centuries ago. Their temple -Kollur Devi temple is still
here.
