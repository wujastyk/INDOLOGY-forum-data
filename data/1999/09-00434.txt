Shame on me. I am definitively discredited. But, anyway, now that my bad
English orthography is made a bit better thanks to you, the idea of a
"on-line" catalogue of catalogues should be examined.
But in fact, what do you mean by "one-line"? the fact that each Mss. listed
is standarly described on "one" line (as in many Indian catalogues)?
