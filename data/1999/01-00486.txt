It is funny to see people of Indian origin on this list who
have to defend themselves and vehemently deny that they are not
this or that, whenever they do not agree with "objective scholars".

It is probably because, all the analysis has been in one direction
for the past few hundred years.
The quote given at the bottom applies to India and Indology as well.

Subrahmanya.

Quote by Said from http://www.emory.edu/ENGLISH/Bahri/Orientalism.html

"One would find this kind of procedure less objectionable as political
propaganda--which is what it is, of course--were it not accompanied by
sermons on the objectivity, the fairness, the impartiality of a real
historian, the implication always being that Muslims and Arabs cannot
be objective but that Orientalists. . .writing about Muslims are, by
definition, by training, by the mere fact of their Westernness. This
is the culmination of Orientalism as a dogma that not only degrades
its subject matter but also blinds its practitioners."
