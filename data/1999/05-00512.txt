See the following book for details on Kerala-Persia/Syria Christian
connections.

See the following book for photos and translation of two sets of copper
plates at the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church in Kottayam. A.C. Burnell
dated them in the 8th and 9th centuries AD well before Vijayanagar period. P.
Shangoonny Menon's date was 3rd century. Kookel Kelu Nair dated it in the 4th
century AD.

The following book by a Dravidian linguist and may be the earliest Dravidian
linguist of Indian origin at University of Pennsylvania gives the text of the
plates and dates them to the end of the ninth century AD. Interestingly one
of them mentions a dignitary named vELkula cuntaran2 (cuntaran2 of the vEL
kula)

Claiming Nambudiri and Nair origin by Syrian Christians may not be
believable. But there can be no doubt about the presence of Christians in
Kerala for more than thousand years.
