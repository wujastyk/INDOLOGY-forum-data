The elephant naLagiri/nalagiri
*>         Also the meaning 'black' for nala- is not known in its
*> Sanskrit usage.
 What is striking is that the nALAgiri of jAtaka stories is
 rendered in Tamil Perungathai (7th century?) as naLagiri.
 If naa.laa = reed is what is meant for naa.laagiri, the 7th c. author
 could have used naa.lagiri. Because 'naaLam' in tamil lit. means
 hollow stalk as that of a lotus, reed, etc.,
 Interestingly, in tamil, naalaagiri becomes naLagiri even though
 naaLagiri is equally admissible.
