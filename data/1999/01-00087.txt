Subject: Macintosh filter for VRI Pali texts
Message-ID: <161227044627.23782.1496364757892754527.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have created a filter (for use with the Macintosh SuperReplace shareware
program) to convert the texts on the Vipassana Research Institute CD-ROM to
the coding of the Normyn font.

Frank Snow has kindly allowed me to make it available on his FreePali website:

http://www.freepali.org/mac/

The VRI Dhammagiri CD-ROM is available free of charge; version 2.0 contains
the Canon, Commentaries, Subcommentaries and a number of other texts.
