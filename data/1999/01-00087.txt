Macintosh filter for VRI Pali texts
I have created a filter (for use with the Macintosh SuperReplace shareware
program) to convert the texts on the Vipassana Research Institute CD-ROM to
the coding of the Normyn font.
Frank Snow has kindly allowed me to make it available on his FreePali website:
http://www.freepali.org/mac/
The VRI Dhammagiri CD-ROM is available free of charge; version 2.0 contains
the Canon, Commentaries, Subcommentaries and a number of other texts.
