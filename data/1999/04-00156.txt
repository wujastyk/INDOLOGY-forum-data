What is needed is not the precise location  of the capital of the Pandyas,
but rather knowledge of Pandyan traditions. For this, there is ample evidence
that Kalidasa was intimately familiar with the traditions regarding the
Pandyas. At least in this he seems to have been better informed than the
modern scholar Venkayya. G. S. Ghurye, in his book, "Indian Acculturation"
says that in Raghuvamsa, Kalidasa says the following:
1.  Agastya was the officiating priest for a Pandya king
2. The Pandya king was so powerful that Ravana thought it prudent to effect a
peace-treaty with him.
3. Pandya kings wore a special necklace.
Item 1 is mentioned in the Sanskrit portion of the vELvikkuTi copper plates
of 770 AD.
Item 2 is mentioned in the Sanskrit portion of the taLavAypuram copper plates
908 AD.
Item 3 is mentioned in cilappatikAram, not later than 5th century AD, and
later copper plates.
Consider the tradition of Ravana's peace treaty with the Pandyas. Not many
Tamil scholars would know that story. It is first attested in Tamilnadu in
the copper plates cited above. When Kalidasa was aware of that story, and
when Madurai was known to Megasthenes and Kautalya, I do not think it is
reasonable to doubt that Kalidasa knew Madurai was the capital of the
Pandyas. (On the other hand, Venkayya's identification of Pandyan capital
with uRaiyUr is like identification of Palani in Tamilnadu with Pilani in
north India based on superficial similarity.)
This uragapura has been discussed by T. N. Subrahmanyan in the Proceedings of
the Seventh All India Oriental Conference and identified as
Tirunageswaram/pAmpUr east of Kumbakonam. (SeeThirty Pallava Copper Plates,
1966, p.44). If anything, it only shows that this identification of uragapura
with uRaiyUr is wrong too.
