I'm *EAGER* to drop out of
this discussion completely.

The only reason I got into
it in the first place was
your assertion that rOman
skript "will make literacy
easier to achieve, and
there are some people
who don't want that."
So far, you have not
shown any such thing(s).

Then there's our friend
Chris who says that
Indic scripts represent
outdated imperialism.

If the "I.Q." (no, not
Idli Quotient) of this
discussion sinks too low,
the idlis will return.
I say this sambarly.
Else, count me out as
of now.

best rigArds,


rAjA.

PS:  Looking at world history for
     the last 2500 years, I notice
     that change of script of a
     language is an extremely
     political event, almost always
     associated with one or more
     of the following:

     a. end of a civilization
     b. end of an empire
     c. foreign takeover
     d. absorption into a different
          civilization
     e. extensive foreign influence
     f. revolutionary change of
          government

     I don't expect any of the
     above to happen in India
     within the next 30 years.
     Therefore, I don't expect indik
     skripts to be abandoned in
     the next 30 years.  By that
     time the country should be
     fully literate.
     eniwE, gud lak.
