Sanskrit texts
Dear Indology Members:
Besides the Sanskrit textbooks already mentioned, Robert Goldman's and
Sally S. Goldman's textbook, Devavaan.ipraves'ika is also quite
effective. It comes with 4 cassettes as well. Ashok Aklujkar's method
also comes with 5 cassettes. Madhav Deshpande's and Walter Maurer's
texts are very useful as well.
