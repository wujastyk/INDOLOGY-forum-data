Deepa Mehta's _Fire_
An excellent commentary on what will happen when the Kashi Viswanath Temple
(dedicated to Lodr Siva) comes up for liberation.
Also, Thakurs (Rajputs, described by you earlier as Thukarians) are present
at the top of the hierarchy of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
The rest of the garbage need not be commented on.
