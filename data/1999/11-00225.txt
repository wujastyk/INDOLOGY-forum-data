Subject: Background of the Sikh name `Singh'?
Message-ID: <161227053698.23782.10063434675650800873.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In most Indian languages and sanskrit singh or simha means lion.
The last name singh and sinha from UP, bihar are probably related.

My guess is that singh or sinha symbolizes a lion and the name is used to
denote a warrior caste. Early sikhs may have adopted names from those of
warrior classes of that period. Many rajputs and thakurs may have adopted
sikhism.

I would like to hear from someone who actually knows the history behind the
name.
