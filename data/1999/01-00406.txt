Dear List members,

The subject of moderation has been discussed already
on this list in February 1995 and the list owner,
Dominik Wujastyk, expressed his feelings about it
in a posting that has now
 http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE?A2=ind9502&L=indology&O=A&P=11261
as its URL (on 1995 February 16th).

I believe his arguments are still valid:
 self-restraint is better and more humane.

Of course, somebody might want to start a new,
moderated, list, like the LINGUIST list,
but he should know that the cost will be high,
in terms of money and time
(some people are doing moderation full time
for LINGUIST, and have to be paid for that)

And it seems that the (1/20th) proportion rule
(tamil mA)
I suggested
is acceptable to some of those concerned ... :-)
as far as I can read ...

Best wishes to all.

-- Jean-Luc CHEVILLARD (Paris)
