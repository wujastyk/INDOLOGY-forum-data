Turning from literature to art, probably the first parasol
on a king is in a 200 B.C Indo-Greek coin. "representaions of
Vishnu is the figure on a coin from Ai-Khanum issued by the
Indo-Greek king Agathocles in 200 B.C. which was excavated
by P. Bernard. The figure wears a skirt-like vertically
ribbed dress falling just below his knees, an uttariya attached
to his shoulders, large earrings, half-boots with curved
sole-ends and a helmet-shaped headdress adorned with two
floating ribbons, surmounted by a large transversal aigrette
which formsa kind of umbrella over the figure. The figure
holds a chakra in the left hand and a pear shaped object
in the right. This has been described as a vase (maNDala)
but it appears to be a conch. A sword hangs from a cross
belt. The legend in the Brahmi script reads as "rajane"
and agnthuklayesha(Agathuklayesha). The umbrella suggests
the vAjapeya ceremony celebrated at an emperor's assumption
of universal sovereignty (fig. 71)." (p. 84, Nanditha Krishna,
The art and iconography of Vishnu-Narayana, Bombay).
The eastern torana at Sanchi, Jaggayapeta Chakravarti panel
at Madras museum, the Amaravati limestone panel at the British
museum with Buddha's leaving the palace, Mahavira representaions
also have the royal parasol. There is a beautiful color painting
of Parvati standing under a parasol in the Pallavan
tAlagiriisavra temple at Panaimalai (D. Barrett, Indian painting).
Geeta Bharathan asked:
 >Was there a single type of parasol that was invented and spread from
 >a  single location, or were there different kinds? Were Indian
 >parasols made the same way as, say, Japanese parasols?
The standard opinion is that the parasol was invented in
China in 4th century AD (see Note 1). Given the fact that parasols are
an integral part of India from the Northwest to Southern
sangam texts from 2nd century BC at the very minimum and
linguistic analysis by Palaniappan pointing very much back in
time and that by 4th century Buddhism has established
itself well in Wei dynasty China, it is likely that Indian parasol
reached China.
Please help me with the name of the article/book(s) where
Jan Gonda discusses Indian kingship? Thanks.

p. 71 " Parasol, Anon., China, 4th century
       ------------------------------------
The first parasols appeared in the 4th century in China under
the Wei dynasty. They were made of oiled paper stuck on to
flexible ribs and were used for protection from the rain as
much as from the sun. They were therefore designed on the
model of the umbrellas which had preceded them by about
four centuries."
