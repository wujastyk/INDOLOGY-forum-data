Subject: the meaning of varNa
Message-ID: <161227049306.23782.11337847536381103080.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Vishal,

Sure, it does not prove - it just makes it possible. And at places I have a
feeling that the most natural way of understanding varNa is that it at least
includes a hint at skin colour. E.g. in RV. II. 12, 4 b:
[i'ndro] dA'saM va'rNaM a'dharaM gu'hA'kaH
[Indra] made the varNa of the dAsas lower and hidden
the hidden varNa seems to suggest a 'not apparent' (not bright, i.e. dark)
colour.

Yours, Ferenc
