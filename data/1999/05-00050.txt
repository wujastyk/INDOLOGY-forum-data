According to the same authority (Mackay, 1948), the IVC people as a rule
used (in M-D and Harappa) kiln-baked bricks only for the whole building.
But sometimes in the foundations of the buildings each row of kiln-baked
bricks was followed by a row of sun-dried bricks (i.e., they alternated) -
or - even more rare case - only sun-dried bricks were used.
All best wishes,
