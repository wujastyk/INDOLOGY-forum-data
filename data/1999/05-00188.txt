There is a further sub-division among vaDamas,. The people from
Kanchipuram-Arcot areas being called vaDadeSattu vaDamas and the vaDamas in
the Tanjavur area are called cozhadeSattu vaDamas. The latter are distinct
from the cozhias. The vaDadeSattu vaDamas refer to their cozhadeSa brethren
as 'tekkEttiyAn' (southerners). This could complicate the geographical
picture, as the cozhadeSattu vaDamas seem to have been in the Tanjavur area
from the 9th century or so, and I would assume that some of them became
SrIvaishNavas too.
