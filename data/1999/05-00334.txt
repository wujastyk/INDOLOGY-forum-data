announcement:change of URL
Dear Indologists,
The Advaita Vedanta Home Page has changed location to the following new URL
-
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp
I notice that many members of this list have put up links from their
institution/department websites, to the old URL at
www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita. Those who connect to this old address
will be automatically forwarded to the new one, but it would still be a good
idea to update your pointers to go directly to the new site.
Regards,
Vidyasankar
ps. In case anyone is wondering about the term avhp, it simply comes from
the name of the site. No connection to vhp :-))
