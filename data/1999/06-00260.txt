Respected Dr. Aklujkar,

You are correct in stating that Trivistapa is used as a synonymn of Swarga
in Indian texts. However, I refer you to

Mahabharata ki Samalocana; Pt. Damodara Satavalekara; Swadhyaya Mandala;
Valsad (Gujarat)

wherein the author explains the word as --"A place which can be reached by 3
paths."

The author has used the data given in the Mahabharata and knowledge of
current routes from India to Tibet to drive home his point that in Ancient
times, there were really 3 routes adopted by Indians to visit places in
Tibet.

It must be noted here that while Swami Dayananda rejected the Puranas as a
source of history, he accepted the Ramayan and the Mahabharata (while
admitting the presence of massive interpolations in them).

So it is possible that Swamiji got his idea from Mahabharata as well.

Best regards,

Vishal

The word Dayaananda has used is trivi.s.tapa. It means both 'heaven' and
'Tibet,' the latter being thought of as the location of heaven in
reconstructions that equate Meru with the Himalayas or certain parts of the
Himalayas. For Dayaananda, it might have meant the same thing whether one
said 'man was created in heaven' or 'man was created in Tibet.' In this
particular case, the difference of the mythological or religious from the
geographical might not have existed for him. -- ashok aklujkar
