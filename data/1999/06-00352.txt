word-final "-am" in the Iranian branch
Well, if you were to take a look at Avestan and Old Persian, you would find
word-final -Em [in Avestan*] or -am [in Old Persian] at the same places
where you would find word final -am in Sanskrit. Thus:
acc. sg. of masc. -a stems
nom. /acc. sg. of neut. -a stems
ditto of consonant stems
ditto of present participles
in personal pronouns and in demonstrative pronouns
1st pers sg. of secondary endings of verbs
etc.
* [note that capital E here stands for inverted e, schwa, which represents
the regular Avestan phonological realization of inherited -a before m and n]
Hope that helps,
GT
