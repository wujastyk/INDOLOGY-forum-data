After the emergence of Pop , all classical or traditioal music in India is a
"subset", the "subhaa" of Chennai or "baithak" of North are endangered species,
please recognise the real fascists of commercial pop and their lullabuys.

"Raaga" is first found in Natyasastr 28, meaning not scale but tonal color.

gramya,not desa,desi or loka.

If Tamil musicological works, giving details of musical systems, defining and measuring
scales , notes, talas, etc,  had survived, I would be very to accept this.

The credit goes to Sama Veda singing and Nardiya Shiksha. Development of seven notes
from Udaatta, Anudaata and Svarita is recorded matter in the Shikhas upto Abhinavagupta.

the ascending and descending scales in history of music.

Natyasastra , Sangeetratnakara, Sangeetparijaat etc;, and even in Aristotle's Poetics.

independent origin, whether "Aryan", Tamil, or anyother and do not accept the
interchange which is the  origin and sustenance of cultures. The problem is not of
culture but of its political exploitation.
