dakSiNAmUrti stotra, and Tamil and Kashmir zaivisms
This is present in Tamil country from early times:
The youthful Murukan teaching the praNavam to his father, Lord
Shiva. (cf. Tiruppukazh)

Coming to the prevalence of dakSiNAmUrti on the west coast of Tamil
country, there is a mention in the CT text ciRupANARRuppaTai about
dakSiNAmUrti as follows:
..............................................kaligkam
Al amar celvaRku amarntan2an2 koTutta
cAvam tAgkiya cAntu pular tiNi tOL
Arvam nal mozi Ayum....                        (ciRu. 96-99)
Here the chieftain Ay of potiyil region is described as giving a
fine cloth to dakSiNAmUrti (Al amar celvan2). The jurisdiction of Ays
extended from Nagarkoil in the south to Tiruvalla  in the north
according to Sreedhara Menon.
A question to Dr. K. Maheswaran Nair and others who know Kerala:
Have seen color slides of big mural paintings in Kerala temples
on Dakshinamurti. Seated in a dense tropical forest. Sometimes,
even lion-tail monkeys unique to Silent valley forest on
Palghat gap are depicted. Wondering about the book
of palm leaves, (the leaves are quite long), held by two
nAga snakes hanging down from a bough, their heads
forming a shape to hold the palm leaf book.  This resembles
a swing. Is the palm leaves held by nAgams descending like
the aerial roots of the banyan fig tree with Dakshinamurti
sitting under the banyan tree unique conception of
D. iconography? In Kerala alone?
