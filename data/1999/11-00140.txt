responding to Nanda Chandran:

I have always suspected that it was there before. It is its
acceptance by Devaanampiya Tissa which is the focus of the stories.

We know very little about how Buddhism spread to other parts of South
Asia. But there were certainly other missionaries -referred to in
various inscriptions and literary sources.

He refers to the Colas and Paa.n.diyas in exactly the same way. So if
you are right about this, it would establish the point I was making.
In fact, his main distinction is between those under his rule and
those not under his rule, which is quite a different matter. But note
that this is perhaps the only (pre-Muslim) time in Indian history
where we chance to have something reasonably close to the boundaries
of modern India, if you include Pakistan and much of Afghanistan,
that is !

On the contrary, travel by sea was much faster and easier at the
right time of the year; so the travel distance from Patna to Ceylon
may well have been much less than that to, say, Ujjain.

As regards vegetarianism, this is a later development in both
Buddhism and Brahmanism. The Buddha himself was not a vegetarian.

Traditionally, Theravaada recognizes all possible goals.
