The latest ACIP release (number IV) contains the Tibetan text (Derge version)
of the Bodhicaryaavataara (file number TD3871) and also a host of commentaries,
check http://www.asianclassics.org/download/TengSkt.html for a list of all
available Tanjur-texts, and
http://www.asianclassics.org/download/texts/tengyur/TD3871M.ACT for the BCA in
particular.
