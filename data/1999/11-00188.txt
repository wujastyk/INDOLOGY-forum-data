For na.tabha.tikaa it seems Monier-Williams depends on
B?htlingk/Roth's Sanskrit dictionary; in vol. 4, s.v. na.ta
you'll find some references.  For the Azokaavadaana reference
there see PaMzupradaanaavadaana, Divyaavadaana No 26 ed.
Cowell/Neill, p.  349: Mathuraayaam ... Na.to Bha.taz ca dvau
bhraatarau shresh.thinau bhavishyata.h | tau Rurumu.n.daparvate
vihaaraM pratish.thaapayishyata.h | tasya Na.tabha.tiketi
sa.mj~naa bhavishyati...
        Na.tabha.tikaa is mentioned again on p. 356 (same Avadaana)
and in the Ku.naalaavadaana, same ed., p. 385. See also Edgerton,
BHSD, s.v. na.tabha.tikaa.

Sujitkumar Mukhopadhyaya reads in his edition of the same in all
cases Urumu.n.da- instead of Rurumu.n.da- (The Azokaavadaana.
Ed. by S. Mukhopadhyaya. New Delhi 1963).

Na.ta and Bha.ta seem to be the founders of a monastery near
Mathura. Prima facie, I think, it will be difficult to connect
these names with the Hathayoga terms.
