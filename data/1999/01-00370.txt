Taoism is about making an immortal body not about getting liberated from

In the USA you can study christan sects, not christianity, you need to go to
Rome, Paris or Istanbul for that. So the reasoning by analogy is false.
It's not even an recognisez pramaa.na on ths list for that matter. You
don't see the point, do you. In all the biographies of Tibetan yogi's wich
have been kept in the Tibetan monastries there's allways question of the
unavailability of teachings and teachers in Tibet.

Anyhting is subject to revision, what kind of an argument is this?

You never saw a Bontexts, did you. If so you would know that the Tibetan
gods were all local nature spirits

SA>> The new Bon was
SA>> nothing but a reversed copy of the existing buddhist practices in
Tibet.

SA> Bon pre-dated Buddhism. It experienced late revivals after Buddhism
came.

And this Old Bon was probably nothing more then a variant of central Asiatci
sjamanism. The so called founder of Bon came from Tajikistan

you can write what you want, but if yoy really want others to take you
seriously, you shouldn't start with 'I can always say'

SA> There are several similarities, the technique of retention, for
instance.

There's quite a difference in the theories about retention actually. Even
the tantra's have different opinions about it. BTW, you speak of tantra's
as scientific works, but the oldest are really nothing more then a yogi's
travelling notebook, with dialogues, recipees, rituals and what else he
didn't want to forget.

SA> The postures prescribed are also very similar.

Well this can be caused by the limitations of the human body.

SA> Then Shiva-Shakti is the same as Yin-Yang.

This is pure nonsens yin and yang are not antropological concepts, but more
like the gu.na's in saamkhya. Originally they were the shady and the sunny
side of a mountain.


SA> This is based not just on a similarity of Sivas. There is
anthropological

I simply don't believe that, since the languages are not related

Austronesians are not Africans

 If the

I studied some African religion in my time, but it's very different from
other religions, certainly from hinduism and it certainly is not a unity.
