So far I know none of his works survived in Sanskrit. By the way,
there are -- at least -- two Sanskrit "restorations" of the
Bodhipathapradipa; see the reviews of Helmut Eimer for a critical
evaluation of them:

        -Eimer, H.: On Atisa's Bodhipathapradipa. In: Bulletin of
         Tibetology. N.S. 1985, No. 1, pp. 15-18
        -Eimer, H.: Again: on Atisa's Bodhipathapradipa. In: Bulletin
         of Tibetology. N.S. 1986, No. 2, pp. 5-15

Probably you know Eimer's critical edition of the (Tibetan) text.

It was written or composed around 1043 in Bsam-yas, i.e. in Tibet. One
may ask the question: was it written in Sanskrit or in Tibetan? Eimer
states in his article: "Die urspruengliche Reihenfolge der Verszeilen
in der Bodhisattvamanyavli." In: Zentralasiatische Studien 15 (1981),
pp. 323-329, that it is younger than the Vimalaratnalekha which is
partly identical or similar (now available in the edition of S.
Dietz). In the named article Eimer lists the known (Tibetan) witnesses
of the Bodhisattvamanyavli.
