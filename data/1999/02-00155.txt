+Just for your interest, when I hear the name of this mountain shorten

+Buddhism is the Buddhist island off the coast near Shanghai in
+Zhejiang called  Pu Tuo Mountain (Pu3 Tuo2 Shan1)
+PU3 means universal - it is read in cantonese POU2 and in Korea
+it is read PO.
+In Bael's transcription it will be p'u. <snip>
  Of course, P'u t'o island, where pilgrims *today* flock to by
  millions off Ningpo is well-known.
  Chun-fang Yu, P'u-t'o shan, 1992,
  "The emergence of P'u-t'o as a national and international pilgrimage
  center for worship of Kuan-yin was a late and slow one, beginning
  in the tenth century, picking up momentum in the 16th, and reaching
  a peak only after the 18th. ... A number of cultic centers for
  Kuan-yin were established on the mainland. While there did not seem
  to be strong local cultic centers for ManjuzrI and Samantabhadra
  against which the Wu-t'ai and Omei had to compete, the case was
  far different for P'u-t'o."
  Please note that in T'ang dynasty period, there were "mainland"
  cult centers for Avalokitezvara.
