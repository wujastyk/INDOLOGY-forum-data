Ganesan>>  Chinese like to shorten Potalaka (Pu-ta-lo-chia) as
Ganesan>> P'u-t'o. (cf. Chun-fang Yu, Prof. of Religion); Likewise,
Ganesan>> In Tibet, Potala is a short form of Potalaka.

+Just for your interest, when I hear the name of this mountain shorten
+as above, the first what appear in mind in relation to Chinese
+Buddhism is the Buddhist island off the coast near Shanghai in
+Zhejiang called  Pu Tuo Mountain (Pu3 Tuo2 Shan1)

+PU3 means universal - it is read in cantonese POU2 and in Korea
+it is read PO.
+In Bael's transcription it will be p'u. <snip>

  Of course, P'u t'o island, where pilgrims *today* flock to by
  millions off Ningpo is well-known.

  Chun-fang Yu, P'u-t'o shan, 1992,
  "The emergence of P'u-t'o as a national and international pilgrimage
  center for worship of Kuan-yin was a late and slow one, beginning
  in the tenth century, picking up momentum in the 16th, and reaching
  a peak only after the 18th. ... A number of cultic centers for
  Kuan-yin were established on the mainland. While there did not seem
  to be strong local cultic centers for ManjuzrI and Samantabhadra
  against which the Wu-t'ai and Omei had to compete, the case was
  far different for P'u-t'o."

  Please note that in T'ang dynasty period, there were "mainland"
  cult centers for Avalokitezvara.
