A source of water five hundred bow-length long, each bow length equal to

"chatur-vimsha-angulo hasto dhanus tat chatur uttaram |
  shata dhanu-antaram chaiva tAvat puShariNi shubhA |
  Etat pancha-guNah prOktas taDAga iti niRNayah ||"
"taDAgO (strI) jalAdhAra-vishEShe yanthra kUTakE" - mEdinI kOsha.

Some interpreters take it as a special lake/pond with lotuses!
"taTAkah", 'taTAgah", "taDAgah" are its variations.
This is what I think as a quick response to the query.
