Thank you for the information.  I looked the at the article and it
would seem that Dr. Kulkarni might be in a good position to shed
light on these matters.  Would you happen to know his e-mail or
address?  I have at hand one article of his but it is 20 years old so
the address given there might not apply anymore.
Thank you very much for your kind help.
Sincerely,
