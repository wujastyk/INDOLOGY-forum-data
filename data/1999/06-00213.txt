Is "Sanskrit" Dravidian ?
I think it is not so easy to dimiss it.
Then could someone answer my question (posted eons ago and got lost in
this stampeded) asking
*when* north indian IE speakers started dropping the final (or even
middle) -a and -am from Skt words...as e.g. in
Skt. kumArasambhavam --> kumArsambhav
Skt. mayUram -> mayUr ...etc.
