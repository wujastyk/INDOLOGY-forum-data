Dear Ganesan,

Shouldn't you post this as an independent original message with
Leslie Price's name in the subject space, if you want people
uniterested in the ongoing discussion of USA's Indian interest to
notice it?

Dear Friends,

I have a personal query. My mother's father had no son, with
all daughters married away, his 7-8000 sq. ft. home was lying
empty at Singanallur, Coimbatore dist. That house figures
prominently
in a Tamil movie called Devar Makan with Sivaji Ganesan and Kamal
Hasan. Will tell later about the house which comes in the Rajnikanth
movie, Ejamaan.


In late 1960s, Leslie Price was living in that house. He
came from Ohio. He lived at Singanallur house for years; My
grandfather gave arrangements for many hunting expeditions of
spotted deer, bison,  and wild boar, .. in the Silent valley,
Anaimalai wildlife reserves. At that time, Iravatham Mahadevan
was the taluk subcollector, I do not have his address.
Is Mr. Leslie Price still with Univ. of Texas history dept.?
If not, how long was he there? Any chance of knowing where he lives
now?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
