B.K. Matilal has written about "Rule of Dialectic and Debate" in his _Logic,
Langauge & Reality_ (sec. 1.2). It seems that the first authors on this
topic were Jainas and Buddhists, and the Nyaaya school used the same terms
in slightly different senses; being more systematic, the description in the
Nyaayasuutra came to carry more weight (ibid.).
But of course. (If nothing could be questioned, then how could any
development take place?) Which period we you thinking of, more precisely,
and what kind of examples?
