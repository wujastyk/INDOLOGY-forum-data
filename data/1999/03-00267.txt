Jules Bloch proposed intial g- in this form for Proto-Dravidian like
*g(a)ard- which he said is preserved in Telugu as a g- form ga:.dida, and as
g(a)ard-abha in Sanskrit. He said it was devoiced later in Ta. Ma. Ka., etc.
(South Dravidian). The Parji, etc.  forms (gadha-type) are borrowed from Mdn
Indo-Aryan. I discussed this problem under intial voicing in my TVB.
