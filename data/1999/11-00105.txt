aham is etymologically related to Latin ego and Greek egoon. The Skt. form goes
back to an earlier form *egHom, where the H represents a laryngeal.

There is no connection between mayaa "by me" and  maayaa "illusion". It is
simply part of the paradigm of the first person pronoun. You will find more
details about these paradigms in e.g. Szemerenyi's Introduction to Historical
Linguistics.
