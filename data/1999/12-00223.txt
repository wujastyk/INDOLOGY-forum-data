The Fodder of First causes

OK.  But philosophy, after all, takes place on the level of conventional
reality, and it is on this level that the exchanges between those schools
that subscribe to philosophical discourse and the rules of nyaya, etc,
take place.  It is precisely when they depart from philosophical concepts
and take recourse to notions such as anirvacaniya, lila, or acintya, etc,
that they provide fodder for their opponents.
Yes, the theists have their own problems, and the same basic arguments
against them keep surfacing in Mimamsa, Jain, Buddhist and other sources.
If the Jiva is distinct from an eternal Isvara in so far as the jiva is
subject to maya while the former is not, then how did jiva find itself
under the influence of Maya? If Isvara placed it there (and Madhva is
indeed peculiar here in his extreme position of jivas being placed in
samsara for eternity), then Isvara is cruel. If some are placed in samsara
and others (nityaparSad) are not, then Isvara is partial.  If jiva's own
desire is the cause, and karma then reacts to this desire and triggers off
samsaric existence, then wherefrom the first inappropriate desire and
karmic act?  So Samkara is by no means alone in taking recourse to notions
of anirvananiya (acintya, etc) as you point out.  Obviously, first causes
are a problem for everyone throughout the history of human thought.
