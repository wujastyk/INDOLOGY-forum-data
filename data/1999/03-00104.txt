         In Tamil the word 'maya-' means 'transcend (or cross from one
         region to another; cross from one state to another).
         'mayakkam' means unconcious. The sense is
         'crossing to another state'. The same word 'mayakkam'
         means '*transistion* from one to another' and hence has the
         meaning of 'confusion', since the 'state seems to have both
         features'. In Tamil literature the words 'thiNai mayakkam'
         etc. are used. The verb 'mayaGku' means 'to get deluded;
         to swoon'. Tamil word 'maya-' and its derivatives
         will fit well the concept of 'trasport into another
         world'.
         The words 'mara' or 'maRa', 'mari', 'maDi'  in Tamil also would fit
         well with the concept of 'dead'. Tamil word 'maay' means 'dead,
         disappear'.
