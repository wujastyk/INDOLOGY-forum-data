kalki
Dr. V. Rao <vidynath at MATH.OHIO-STATE.EDU> wrote a while ago:
May be the answer is very late:
In around 1000 A.D., tamil texts and commentaries render skt. r/l
as .r(R). Examples:
kalki > ka.rki(kaRki); varga > va.rkam(vaRkam); tarka > taRkam in
tamil. Only later, these are tamilized as kalki, varukkam, tarukkam
respectively.
Don't know about the First Millennium BCE situation.
