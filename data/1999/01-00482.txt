Dear Martin:

I checked with a friend who is relatively well read in
SrIbhAshya.  You are correct, and I am mistaken; in
Visishtadvaita, the very svarUpa, the "stuff", of the jIva
is "caitanya" or consciousness.  This "svarUpa-bhUta-jnAna"
is what reveals to itself the "I" of the individual and is
_not_ a guNa.

Of course dharma-bhUta-jnAna by definition is a guNa, inseparable
from the jIva but capable of contraction or expansion.

So, van Buitenen may very well be misreading Ramanuja here.
