That precisely,  is _a_ major preoccupation of fertility clinics worldwide.

How do you argue that it was widespread ?   And why talk of Hindu conservatism,  kaliyuga etc ?
Even in ancient times,  is there mention of niyoga or similar practice in cultures such as that
of the Sangam era Tamils...  in all probability not,  considering the emphasis on kaRpu
(chastity) for married women... which in itself is patriarchical,  but that is beside the point
here.

Here,  the traditional "marumakkathayam" practices of the Nair community of Kerala,  which were
indeed very widespread amongst that community and a few others till very recent times,  and
noticed by various visitors to Kerala since medieval times,  offers a enlightened,
non-patriarchical alternative,  provided it is rid of the usual caste-related considerations.
