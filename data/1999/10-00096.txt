Subject: Sharada Script Translation
Message-ID: <161227052843.23782.7649438135859693105.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have an old book written in Sharada script and was wondering if someone
could help in having this translated into Devanagri.  Can anyone help point
me in the right direction?
Secondly, is anyone aware of Sharada script-fonts for PC or Mac?

Thank You
