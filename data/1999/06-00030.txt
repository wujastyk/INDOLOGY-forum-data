Pronunciation of word final "a" in Sanskrit
As a Hindiwallah (or actually -vali) I can confirm that in most Hindi
verse that I'm aware of the final 'a' (which can be syllable-final as
well as word-final) is pronounced - usually, as Allen Thrasher suggests,
metris causa, but it also occurs in songs where the reason is rhythmic
rather than metric.
