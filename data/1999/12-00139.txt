All of these assumptions can and have been attacked. From the purely
mathematical
standpoint, Mark Hubey, a computer science professor and mathematican,
does a
good job over the Net. Giving examples of prediction is bogus and cannot
be
distinguished from a lucky guess or simple coincidence. The fact is that
you can
not prove any laws regarding sound changes. You can only hypothesize.

Not really.

I thought you said in your last post that Munda "D" could be
reconstructed?

Anyway, there are plenty of examples such as the past verbal infix -R-.
I'd have to order some books through interlibrary loan to see if there
is
a -D- infix.

There is no proof that be can offered in any of these arguments.
However, I can
predict fairly well the sound systems of Indians who are taught English
or practically
any other language. So it is a pretty good theory, right?

No, it is a reasonable explanation given certain preconceptions.

Well, the most conservative elements in language even according to
Western linguistic
theory are grammatical particles and affixes and basic vocabulary.

Thus, we can see even a morphophonemic use of retroflexion in which the
final D of
intensive bases becomes R before the future suffix. There is also the
intensive suffix
-goD. The plural suffix -T0; present negative prefix in Ton -- aRi. The
past suffix -teDa, Tee,
etc., and many other such affixes.

Third person and demonstrative pronouns:

        -De, -aDi, Juang;
        Deh, De?, Mon;
        eTey, Nahali;
        eTa, Ho;
        hinkaR, Mundari;
        Di, Curu;
        Do, Som;


There are also some second person pronouns like Juang amDe, amanDe,
"you" and amDa, amaDa "your."

If you took the top few hundred Swadesh terms, I'm willing to bet well
over half have retroflex
sounds including words like haRa "man, koNDu "small", ukaR "this
person", koRa "boy," etc.

What do you mean by the last sentence? Are you saying that Munda and
"Aryan" languages
do not have initial retroflex consonants?
