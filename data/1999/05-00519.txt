varna and jati
This discussion started with 'Varna', so we got many responses as to
whether it  literally means skin color or it has little to do with it.  I
would appreciate if some of you could give your opinion on how and when the
untouchable category came into existence.  Were there untouchables since
the inception of the Varna scheme?
        Gratefully,
        Kamal
