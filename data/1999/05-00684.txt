no importance? From reading the above it seems that subject matter which
does not interest you fails to fall under the **profound and interesting**
category.

Now, let me get this straight. You are complaining to the list administrator
that the quality and quantity of messages on the Indology list do not come
up to your standards because they are of no value to you and it is time for
him to fix the problem. Is this right?

Ah, I see! You wish to belong to an exclusive little club which has a
restricted range of topics worthy of discussion and which is only open to
those who agree with your ideas.

It is interesting to note that on one subject which has been under
considerable discussion in the past few days, there have been at least 15
different authors. This same applies to at least one other discussion. Now,
if such a good cross section of the Indology list engaging in spirited
discussion amounts to ** ''what this list has degenerated to'' ** then I
just do not know how such "degeneration" can be redressed. Perhaps it boils
down to Mr Juergen Neuss putting his pen to paper, or should I day digit to
keyboard, and giving us an example of the sort of things which should be
under discussion. It is all very well to criticise, but unless he wishes to
set the example of how things should be done, then his post is decidedly one
which should be placed immediately in the trash can.

Kindest regards from an Indology member who deletes messages when necessary
but who relishes reading those which are of interest.
