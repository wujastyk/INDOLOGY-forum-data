bones and flesh

I agree that the bones/flesh division is pan-Indian.  I was actually
commenting on the formative input by the Mundas on Buddhist tantras,
quite apart from this question.   In passing, I also agree with Paul
Manansala's comments -- it's a pity the the Munda contribution to
various aspects of Indian culture is played down -- after all, they
seem to have been in India longer than "newcomers" like the
Indo-Eurpeans and the Dravidians.  Perhaps when a proper Munda
etymological dictionary becomes available we can re-evaluate matters.
Best wishes,
