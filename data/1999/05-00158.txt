Tanagalai and Vadagalai
Look at the teachers:
vaDakalai sect: tUppul vEdAnta desikan of Kanchipuram.
tenkalai sect: maNavALa muni of SethunaaDu (cf. R. Raghava Aiyangar,
cEtunATum centamizum, 1920s work. I can get the quote from
my library). Another major teacher: PiLLai LokAchaaryar
was of Thiruvarangam).
