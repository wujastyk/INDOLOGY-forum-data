>???From a critical point of view, metaphorical reference to
Mahabharata and similar works as the Fifth Veda is an indication of
the respect accorded to them by Indian tradition. Ayurveda,
Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda are some more instances. The very
expression 'Fifth Veda' testifies to the basic character of and
traditional sanction to the Four Vedas.
Hope this would satisfy you.
