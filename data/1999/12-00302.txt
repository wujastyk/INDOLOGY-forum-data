There is no "standard" academic opinion, as far as I am aware. I don't think
any proper critical examination has been made of all the sculptures that
have been claimed to represent Sankara. The intersection set of art
historians and academic vedAnta scholars is probably a null set. In spite of
his impeccable credentials, Sivaramamurti may have only seen what he was
expected (or told?) to see by a higher authority. I, for one, am quite
skeptical about it.

The sculptures range from the times of Narasimhavarman Pallava to
Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara. Whatever literature there does exist about
these sculptures seems driven by hidden agendas. N. Veezhinathan has
included pictures of a number of them in his edition of anantAnandagiri's
hagiography of Sankara. K. R. Venkataraman has pointed out that at least
some of the sculptures (notably in the kAyArohaNeSvara temple, but also in
other locations) represent lakUlISa-pASupata ascetics, and that they have
been mistakenly interpreted as ekadaNDI saMnyAsins of the advaita tradition.
And voila, here you have it - the two authors are in opposite camps, and any
discussion has only seen more heat than light.
