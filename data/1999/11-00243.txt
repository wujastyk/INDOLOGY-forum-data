Use of the number "4 trillion US$" indicates
that the GNP was measured in Purchasing
Power Parity (PPP) terms.  In PPP terms,
India's GNP is about US$ 1.6 trillion.

PPP is a method of adjusting the exchange rates
to account for the fact that living expenses
in different countries are different.

In nominal terms (i.e., without adjusting exchange
rates), the Chinese GNP is approx US$ 1 trillion,
whereas the Indian GNP is about US$ 400 million.

By either measure, the Chinese economy is currently
about 2.5 times bigger than the Indian economy.

Raja.
