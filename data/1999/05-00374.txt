Sugarcane (kan2n2al)
The sea is actually described as *stinking*.
The crowning glory of Indian literature cilappathikAram's poignant
poems in "kAn2al vari" chapter  exquisitely portray the ocean-side
scenario [kAn2al = sea-side garden or forest;
vari = a poem relating to dance].
"pulavuRRu iraGki atu nIGkap
 pozil taN talaiyil pukuntu utirnta
kalavaic cemmal maNam kamazat
 tirai ulAvu kaDal cErppa!..." (cilap:7:39:1-2)
pulavu = smell (of fish); nIGka = to rid (of the smell);
maNam = fragrance; tirai = wave; kaDal = ocean;
"...Oh my lover belonging to the sea-side town with
forests where ocean waves frequent to get rid of their
fish smell and pick up the fragrances of the sweet fruits
and flowers lying on the floor..."

Chandra
