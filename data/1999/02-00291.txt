Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
Dear Mr. Ganesan
I am just curious. Is your point only and exactly to prove that what
is today called in South India Mt. Potikai/Potityil was at certain
point of time called by certain people Mt. Potalaka? (By what
people and at what time? Is the point of this argument to prove that
Avalokiteshvara resided at a given time in what is in these days
called Mt. Potikai?)
I am sorry for another probably irrelevant question.
Sincerely
Petr Mares
