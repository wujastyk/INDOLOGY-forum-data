Blood circulation
Hi
I've been lurking this list for some time and it's obvious to me that some
members abide by a very simple syllogism: if it's any good it's from India if
not it's from somewhere else.
The idea behind it seems to be an uncanny feeling caused by the obvious paradox
with the visible reality. If I would answere 'bullshit' to all these
amateuristic archeology, somebody would probably answere that bullshit is an
Indian invention, because already mentiond in the veda's.
