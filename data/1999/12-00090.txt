Jnanasambandar: Nanda Chandran's question
I kind of agree, but the statement that brahmins exploited less privileged
sections of society is misleading. Brahmins cannot be accused of direct
exploitation genocide, enslavement and stealing wealth.
They were responsible for instituting cruel and unfair traditions. How much
mileage they gained from this is arguable. They must already be in a
position of authority in order to have instituted such traditions.
I have seen a dalit student from a remote village who topped his class and
entrance exams. Respect for learning in Indian society is a brahmanical
trait and makes us quite unique compared to other developing countries.
There is much that India has to be thankful to brahmins for also.
