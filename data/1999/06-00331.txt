Brahmins. From more recent times, we have the Koviloor Math
(www.koviloor-madalayam.org), established and maintained totally by
non-Brahmins till the present day. The founder was from the Nagarattar
community, and his guru was a weaver (caste?). The motivations behind this
institution seem purely religious, with no political agenda.
