Please keep your messages to INDOLOGY short.  The recommended limit is 2k,
yes, about 2000 characters, or roughly a screenful of text.

This means

1/ expressing yourself concisely
2/ NOT including previous messages in toto.
3/ NOT setting your email client to attach "rich" versions of your
   email (html, etc.).  Plain text only, please.

If INDOLOGY is to thrive, it is essential that we all practice a certain
restraint in our postings both in content and volume.

Thank you,
Dominik
