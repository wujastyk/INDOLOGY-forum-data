false etymologies and "False Freunde" for Tamil words ending              in " -thiram" ?
The previous posting was a draft that accidentally got posted.
I thought I was sending it to my home email address
for further work.
Anyway,  I give the gist of my thought now that it got
posted:
man-thiram seems to have some meanings in Tamil
in senses that appear to be absent in Sanskrit.
chUththiram:
given that TolkAppiyam and Tamils handled
taxonomy so well and in unique ways to deal with
very subtle matters, for example,
the akam tradition and the associated taxonomy for
Tamil music (thiNai, thuRai, pAlai etc.)
For example, the word pAlai is used to
denote "mELakartha raagam" and system of music
(Ayap pAlai, vattap pAlai etc.)
Why would he employ a
 non-Tamil word for such a strategic element in his book?
en-thiram:
this is frequently used in the sense of
"sugar cane mill" in a few paththuppaattu books
which otherwise employ "difficult" Tamil words.
The poets could have employed the word "poRi".
paithiram and mAthiram  do they have  "False Freunde"
in Sanskrit?.
Overall, it looks like words ending in "-thiram"
 are very interesting linguistically.
Aplogize for the sketchy nature of this.
