viSNukuNDins
Esteemed list members,
Is the dynasty title, viSNukuNDin related to kuNDu (pot/jar)?
If so, were the vELs? Any agastya links to them?
Were their deity Skanda?
Comapre: Chaulukyas in their inscriptions claim they are of vEL kulam;
Tamil nighaNTus like Pingalandai, cEntan divAkaram (8th cemtury)
say Chalukyas are vELir. Also, the place names bELuuru, beLagAm.
Regards,
N. Ganesan
