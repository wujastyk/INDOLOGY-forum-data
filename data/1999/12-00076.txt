Munda kinship pattern

Many of the so-called Kirati practice cross cousin marriage. I know
personally that this is the case among Magars and Gurungs.
I don't remember the situation among the Tharu. However, the Tharu like
so many other groups in Nepal practice the "asura" form of marriage
which involves a ritual kidnapping of the bride.
No of this occurs, that I know of, among Bahmans and Chetris. However,
even by their own tradition these are rather latecomers to Nepal.
Actually, the Bhotiya are Tibetan speakers. There is, if I remember
right, a group of Himalayan speakers I believe in the Himachal region of
India who may still practice polyandry.
