Kaladi and Sankara
The earliest reference would probably be in the Sankaravijaya of Madhava,
traditionally identified with Vidyaranya. There is another account by one
Anantanandagiri, which identifies Chidambaram as Sankara's birthplace. This
text is a late one, as it refers to and quotes from the Adhikarana Ratnamala
of Bharati Tirtha and Vidyaranya. There are said to be other Puranic
accounts regarding Sankara. Details may be found in G. C. Pande's 1994 book
on Sankara's life.
