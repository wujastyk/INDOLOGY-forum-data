My recent publications
(Please use <aklujkar at unixg.ubc.ca> as my e-mail address as of 1 Sep 99.)
In the tradition of sharing news about each other's research, I submit the
following. Those who are NOT interested in study areas such as Vedaanta,
Saa.mkhya, Sanskrit grammar, grammatical theory, dramaturgy and teaching of
Sanskrit as a language need not read the following details.
In 1998-99, the following of my writings have appeared in print (volume
titles have been given without diacritical marks, so that they would
conform with what you are likely to find in library listings):
