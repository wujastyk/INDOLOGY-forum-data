teleological argument
The NyAya tradition proves the existence of God from the universe -
not strictly from its design, but from the major premise that
anything constructed must have a purpose. Sankara appears to use such
an argument at the beginning of his commentary on the
Brahma-SUtra/VedAnta-sUtra. But then (p.17 in Thibaut's translation)
he expressly rejects the view that the existence of God can be
inferred, insisting that God can only be known from the Veda.
