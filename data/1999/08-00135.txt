Information needed on 1979 work
Dear Indology members,
I came across one reference
Satya Prakash and Usha Jyotishmati (1979), "The Sulba Sutras:
Texts on Vedic Geometry."  Allahabad: Ratna Kumari Svadhyaya
Sansthana.
Does anyone know whether this is a work in English?  I was able
to figure out whether this was an edition of Sulbasutras or an
English work.  Your help would be appreciated.
Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
