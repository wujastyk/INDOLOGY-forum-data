"Indian music" is rather general. You might try asking this question in
rec.music.indian.classical if that is the type of music you want. There
is also rec.music.indian.misc (discusses mostly film music, I believe).

Rabindra Bhavan in Delhi used to (20+ yrs ago) have wonderful archives of
Hindustani classical, and also old Hindi film music.
