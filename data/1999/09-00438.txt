Subject: Is there an alternate to the Bhagavadgita while being sworn              in?
Message-ID: <161227052643.23782.12179792107010571322.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I saw a Hindi movie sometime ago wherein the witness, though a Hindu refused
to depose in the name of God and BhagwatGita saying that he did not believe
in it.

He was directed to keep the right hand on his heart and depose on himself.
