Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
  Are we sure Lanka in Lankavatara sUtra refers to Ceylon?
  I have not read this anywhere.
  Petr Mares thinks it is likely to be a South Indian text.
  What is the latest on the place of origin of Lankavatara?
  Does Lankavatara mention Avalokitezvara?
