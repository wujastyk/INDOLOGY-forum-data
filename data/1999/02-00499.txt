Ref. check- Possible misprint in critical edition Bhag. Gita
I'm using Harvard-Kyoto (HK) convention in the following.
I have obtained a copy of "zrImadbhagavadgItA" / Sanskrit text edited by
S.K. Belvalkar; Hindi translation by V.S. Agrawala. - Varanasi: Hindu
Vishvavidyalaya Sanskrit Publication Board: sole distributor, Banaras
Hindu University Press, 1962.
The text contains a very comprehensive list of variations and critical
apparatus.  The editor S.K. Belvalkar is the editor of the Bhagavad Gita
section of the B.O.R.I. critical edition of the Mahabharata, 1947.
In verse 11.25 line 2 of the above text I would like to check if there
is a misprint.
This line reads:  "dRSTvaiva kAlAnilasaMnibhAni"
But in J.A.B. van Buitenen's edition "The Bhagavadgita in the
Mahabharata" which is based on the B.O.R.I. critical edition (and all
other texts I've checked) the line reads:
 "dRSTvaiva kAlAnalasaMnibhAni"
For this line Belvalkar only lists the variation:
dRSTvaiva  :  dRSTveva
This makes me wonder if "kAlAnilasaMnibhAni" might be a misprint?
If anybody who has access to the B.O.R.I. critical edition could check
if this is a valid reading or not I would greatly appreciate it.
Also if anybody could tell me if the B.O.R.I. critical edition is still
in print And if so how to obtain it.
Thank you very much,
Harry Spier
