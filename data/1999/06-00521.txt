The conception of Rama

Regarding evidence of Niyoga in Vedas please refer Rgv 10th Mandala.
Vedic also means the vedic parampara , all grihya sutras and MAnu,
Yajnyavalka etc elaborate on Niyoga. Manusmriti Ch9.
The presence of the "author" as a character in his own created work is a
methodological device followed in many ancient Indian texts. There is a
whole system in taking such a posture as a dramatic device.
Let us not look at things with a wooden realism.  I hope you shall be kind enough to
look at all the techniques of expression used in older systems and perform a detailed
skepsis ( which in Greek means deep thought and reasoning, of which questioning is only
a part) and live upto your title of "skeptik"
