How much scholarly interest is there amongst Indologists on the nature  and
origin of 'jAti'? Can anyone suggest a book of historical-empirical study
of jAti? Please, not that variety that quotes Manu or some obscure text and
speaks of 'Caste System'.
Similarly I would like to have a suggestion of a book on current state of
sociological research on the phenomenon of jAti.
Thanks in advance.
