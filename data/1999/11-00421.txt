Transliteration, fonts and modern Indian Languages
I have removed portions that I am not responding to:

The pronunciation of the nasalized word and one with anusvara can be different
and hence it is nt appropriate to use just one symbol.  The example cited by
Harry Spier
Hindi example ha&sa (laugh), haMsa (Swan)." [& represents chandrabindu and M
represents anusvara]
illustrate this as well. I have not seen the modern tilde used, so it must be
fairly new!
Of course, most of these are discussions about Hindi/Marathi. We have had
detailed discussion about the Sanskrit story!
I presume the reason to drop the final "a" is to be faithful with the
pronunciation in practice, which omits the final "a" and often many in the
middle too! With multiple consonants, you need some amount of vowel to finish
and so perhaps it is kept. In original devnagari, you keep the vowels anyway,
since they are built in the characters.  (BTW, note my "devnagari"; it
illustrates dropping "a" in the middle from "deva". That is how the word is
pronounced in non-sanskrit context! There are other "mis-spellings" in this word
as well!)
P.S. I personally prefer the Itranslator fontsfor generating as well as
displaying devnagari characters. I believe they should be usable. Check the
site;  http://sanskrit.bhaarat.com/Omkarananda/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html . They
have true-type fonts which look good too!
