"Your beautiful new temple stands as evidence of the faith and vision
of your comunity. That enduring faith binds members of a congregation
together in fellowship and prayer, and will help to lead all of you
through the struggles and joys of life." the president stated.
"Our country was founded on a great tradition of religious liberty,
which helps to unite our nation of diverse faiths and creeds and gives
us a common ground for tolerance, healing and understanding. This
celebration is a reminder of the ways that god's blessings can be used
to fulfil our obligation to help others." he said.
