Dakshina
I would appreciate if anyone knows a modern study of the practice of
offering Dak.si.naa to Brahmins during the reign of Peshwas in
Maharashtra.  I have seen only peripheral references to this practice so
far.  The amounts of money mentioned in these references are very large,
1,800,000 Rupees for some years and 500,000 during the reign of Bajirao
II, just before the British took over Poona.  I would like to find out
more trustworthy descriptions, perhaps some published original documents
of the Peshwas.  Any help is appreciated.
