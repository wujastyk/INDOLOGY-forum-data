Chris Fernandez pointed out:

Again, Paul Manansala writes:
Not so, according to S. Palaniappan. Let us check his
original posting  on Kak again:
"This is absolutely not true. There is ample evidence that Arya was
a name for Sanskrit and its derivates. Consider the following
tEvAram line (6th or 7th century AD) from a hymn by Saint Appar.
Ariyam tamizOTu icai An2anan2 (tEv.5.18.3.1)
Here Ziva is praised as one who became music with Arya, and Tamil".
  As you can see, Saint Appar clearly distinguishes between
  Tamil and Aryan.
