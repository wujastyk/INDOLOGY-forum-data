Dr. E. Bryant's paper
I read the list manager's message dated 5 Jan 99. Is Ed Bryant's paper
now available in the INDOLOGY website?

This is a very good idea, and I am hoping to post a paper by Ed Bryant
on the INDOLOGY web site in the not too distant future which will
fulfil this purpose.
In the meantime, I'm afraid it is a matter of picking through the
archives.  I have not seen anything new on this topic posted to the
list for a long time; just a great deal of emotion.
