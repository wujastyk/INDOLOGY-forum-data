I do not think this is correct. Before agreeing with this suggestion
concerning kan2n2ATu and karunATU, one will have to explain the pair nen2n2al
and nerunal, occurring in CT. Also, is the underlying process different from
cases where, for example, Tamil naturalizes Sanskrit karNa, and varma as
kan2n2an2, and van2man2 respectively?
