Subject: Deepa Mehta's _Fire_
Message-ID: <161227044884.23782.14571186907128492019.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The burning sari scene, apart from reminding of dowry death methods, is a
trial by fire of Radha and all the movie's issues.  And of course Radha
survives her 'trial by fire', thereby proving purity of heart and all that;
otherwise the last scene would -er- 'backfire' on the whole film.
