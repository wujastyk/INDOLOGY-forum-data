If we take 'sUta' to be a prakrit word, then it should correspond to 'sUtra' in Sanskrit. Early Aryan society considered
both bards and charioteers of mixed caste a sUdra, if my understanding is correct. Karna was considered sUtra in the
epic and hence he was not considered a kshatriya. Dhuriyodhana gave him a kingdom; others grudgingly forgot the
sUtra issue atleast in front of him.
