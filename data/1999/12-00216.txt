Yes.  But he has replaced one problem with another.  He has by-passed the
need for explaining samyoga between prakRti and puruSa by positing that
the former can only be apparent, but in so doing he has created a new
problem -- whence the 'samyoga' between Brahman and this apparency,
(Maya/avidhya)?  Sankara's detractors (Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka,
Vallabh, Baladev and even Siva/Sakti monists), in turn, never cease to
point out what they consider to be the achilles heel of Sankara's own
solution to the Samkhyan dilemma.
I am curious to explore to what extent Ramanauja's arguments defending the
necessity of a divine being are borrowed from Nyaya.  I have a sense that
the same basic theistic arguments just keep resurfacing.
