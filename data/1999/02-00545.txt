Dear Dr. Cronk
I would first like to give chance to the bellow named five people to
explain their sharing of the same two nodes, to apologize for their
nasty attacks and especially Mr. Iyer I suppose should be so glad
and tell us why he moved just now behind the new proxy.
If they do not explain the coincidence I will be glad to provide the
explanation or leave it to Dominik Wujastyk to do so.
