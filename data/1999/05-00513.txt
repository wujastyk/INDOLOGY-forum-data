To understand the origins of image worship/localization of divinity, it is
good to consult the following Tamil-related references.

Tamil Temple Myths by David Shulman

On the Themes of Divine Immanence and Localization by Rajam Ramamurti in the
journal of Tamil University, Tanjavur.

My Indology posting "Tantrism and the Concept of Image in Tamil/Dravidian"
dated Sun, 29 Jun 1997.
