Perhaps you could explain why literacy
is easier to achieve using the Roman script
rather than any other script?

You might also help us by explaining the
discrepancies in the following tables of
literacy rates, which I compiled from
http://www.accu.or.jp/litdbase/stats/index.htm
and http://www.cowan.edu.au/library/iorr/country/srilanka.htm


  Countries using         Countries not using
  Roman script            Roman script
 ----------------------------------------------
  Indonesia (84%)         Thailand    (94%)
  Malaysia  (84%)         Sri Lanka   (89%)


  States in India         States in India
  using Roman script      not using Roman script
 ----------------------------------------------
  Nagaland (60 to 74%)    Kerala (89.8%)
  Meghalaya (46 to 60%)   Goa (above 88%)

Is it possible that people are
just fond of the traditional
script of their own languages?
