Dr. Alexander v. Rospatt  writes:
I do not have the printed volumes, but the CD (I have versions 1 and 2)
should be identical.
I do not think textual criticism has been employed to establish this
edition. It is very close to the text of the Fifth Council Edition. So it
is essentially an exemplar of the Burmese textual tradition alone. It is
best to view it as equivalent to a single very good manuscript, I suppose.
It is nowhere near as good as the better PTS editions which used a number
of manuscripts etc. It is often better that the worst PTS editions.
The major problem is that it tends to adopt the easiest or simplest reading
rather than the lectio dificilior.
Whenever I have checked it against those Burmese editions I have, it has
had few or no errors. Occasionally a typographic error in the Burmese
edition has been corrected. I do not know if this is deliberate or
inadvertent !
I can only speak for the CD. Version two has the pagination of the PTS
editions inserted - for most but not all texts of which the PTS has
published editions.
