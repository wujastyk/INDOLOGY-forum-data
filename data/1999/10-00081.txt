Subject: Reference for naa.daa?
Message-ID: <161227052799.23782.1724402365916476649.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Under the word naa.da, MMW, referring to the Vaitanasutra, gives the
feminine form naa.daa as the 'N. of a partic. verse'. I would be grateful
for any help with the following related questions:
        1. Where in the Vait. does this word occur?
        2. Does it occur in other texts, and if so, where?
        3. To what sort of verse(s) does naa.daa refer?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
