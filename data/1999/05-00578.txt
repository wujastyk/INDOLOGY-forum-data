Day is night in Dravidian?
I addition to the words
nAl, nizal (which I had pointed out earlier)  each employed in the
senses of day and night or
light and dark, we also have another word el used similarly
in CT.
This patteren goes to show further that nAL is not alone .
el = day, night
el = night
"ellin2ir pukin2E" (malaipaDukaDAm: 416)
"el uRum mauval" (kuRu: 19: 4)
el = day, light
"ellai emmoDu kazippi" (akam: 200)
"el iDai kaziyun2arkku Emam Aka" (perum:66)
"el aRu pozutin2 mullai malarum
mAlai" (kuRu: 234:2-3)
el = day
"ellum ellin2Ru" (kuRu: 390:1)
