Subject: 2 Urdu books : apologies and explanation
Message-ID: <161227051828.23782.1663914812593883939.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

My apologies for sending a personal message or two about the Urdu
books offered to the list.

I should emphasize that these titles are also supplied in the LC
cooperative acquisitions program but that the extra copies offered
came to Washington by another route, being given by relatives of
people involved in the publication.  Could any librarians concerned
about the titles please communicate to me and not to the list?

Thanks,

Allen
