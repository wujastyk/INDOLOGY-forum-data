Linguistic KB
I'm not sure what your point is -- could you clarify please? How do you
use genetic evidence to reconstruct linguistic history or the migration of
*languages*? I'm not an expert in historical linguistics but I take talk
of an IndoEuropean homeland to mean that the *language*
Proto-Indo-European can be traced back to a particular region based on
linguistic evidence. This does suggest something about the migration of a
few people -- because they had to migrate to spread the language, but the
migration could have been limited to very few people (which need not have
had a great impact on biological-genetic relationships) and more
importantly, these people need not have actually travelled all the way
from the homeland to the entire region in which Indo-European languages
are found. E.g. a few people could have carried PIE to regions immediately
surrounding the homeland. Then a few *other* people could have carried
descendent dialects/languages of PIE to areas further away, and so on.
Thus biological relationships between people do not have to match
linguistic relationships between the languages they speak. And so
biological genetic relationships could not tell us much about the homeland
of a *language*.
