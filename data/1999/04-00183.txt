uraga and AlavAy
 Kalidasa does not mention Uraga is on the Kaveri river.
THE uragapura is on the Kaveri, acc. to Gadval plates.
The Gadval plates' uragapura could be Nagapattanam,
Nagesvaram (T. N. Subrahmanian), or TiruppAmburam (Tevaram).
I think the Kalidasa's uraga and Chalukya reference to uraga
are two different places.
However:
  The Pandyas wore a special necklace from Indra. This is
told in CilappatikAram (5th century) and Rajendra Chola 's
prasasti/meykkIrtti (11th century) - the tamil portion of Chola royal
announcement tells us that the Chola King took away
the necklace of Indra from the Pandyas. If Kalidasa is
talking of the special necklaces of Pandyas, it is something
special.
