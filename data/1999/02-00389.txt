In T.N., such evidence is available even
for relatively less important Buddhist
centers like Kanchipuram or Nagapattinam.
My question: is there such evidence
from Potiyil?
Instead, if all we have is one comment
from a foreign visitor, who never
actually went within a few hundred
miles of Potiyil, and who may or
may not have been referring to
Potiyil, that isn't substantial
evidence, is it?
We know where Potiyil is.  We
don't know where "Po-to-lo-chia"
is (even assuming it is real
and not mythical).  Can someone
provide archeaological/literary/
historical information about
Potiyil?  Was it a very important
Buddhist mountain?
