Is Danti Sakthi ViTanki a Rashtrakuta Princess?

Dantidurga, the Rashtrakuta founder performs the hiranyagarbha.
His descendent, Amoghavarsha boasts about it many years later.

Then, may be, Danti Sakti ViTanki makes Raja Raja Chola I, her
husband, to do hiraNyagarbha at TiruvisalUr!

Kind regards,
Swaminathan Madhuresan
