One could say this.  But, then, from where did the jiva make this initial
act of rebellion?  One would have to assume that it was a pre-samsaric
decision, since you are proposing that it *resulted* in samsara.  If this
pre-samsaric condition was Vaikuntha, then how could imperfection enter
Vaikuntha (ie how could a pure jiva devoid of ahamkara, buddhi, manas, etc
in a pure, transcendent, non-prakritic realm make an impure decision)?

If the jiva was not in Vaikuntha (and the Gita notes that one who attains
that realm *never* returns to samsara suggesting that one cannot fall from
the paramdham), then where was it's pre-samsaric locus?  Similar issues,
of course, have taxed Christian theologians with the fall of Satan and of
man.  EB
