Hello, can anyone please email me a definitive text
of the history of fireworks in India?

The Britannica Encyc. mentions that before gunpowder
was invented in Europe, Indian recipes for fireworks
existed during the 9-10th centuries AD. These used
Salt Petre a chemical which India exported (?).

It seems that the Chinese had fireworks way before
Indians did.

Then portuguese/Arabs introduced gunpowder in India.

Can anyone please help me collect the facts?

Thanks

Peter
