Needed: History of fireworks in India.
Hello, can anyone please email me a definitive text
of the history of fireworks in India?
The Britannica Encyc. mentions that before gunpowder
was invented in Europe, Indian recipes for fireworks
existed during the 9-10th centuries AD. These used
Salt Petre a chemical which India exported (?).
It seems that the Chinese had fireworks way before
Indians did.
Then portuguese/Arabs introduced gunpowder in India.
Can anyone please help me collect the facts?
Thanks
Peter
