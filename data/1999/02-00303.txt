Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
 N. S. Raja asks whether Prof. Yu agrees
 with the Mount Potalaka identification as Mt. Potikai/Potiyil
 in Malaya mountains.
 THE ANSWER IS YES.
 He can also read the identification of
 Mt. Potalaka located in Malaya country done 14 centuries ago.
 Hence, Mt. Potiyil/Potikai in Malaya mountains = Mt. Potalaka.
Prof. Chun-fang Yu informed that the following passages
identifying Mt. Pu-ta-lo-chia (Potalaka) as a Mountain
in the Malaya mountains are authentic and belong to seventh
century AD.
Prof. Yu also added that Chih-Sheng, a Buddhist monk
also locates Mt. Pu-ta-lo-chia (Potalaka) in the Malaya country.
In a similar fashion to Xuan Zang.
When I mentioned this seventh century Monk's name as
Chin-sheng, Prof. Yu corrected it as Chih Sheng (688-740 AD).
Chih Sheng lived during the T'ang era, acc. to Prof. Yu.

XUAN ZANG'S Mt. Potalaka identification as a Mount in Malaya mountains
**********************************************************************
Th. Watters, On Yuan Chwang's travels in India, 1905
2.229 says:
"In the south of the mo-lo-kuta (malakUTa)
country near the sea  was mo-lo-ya (malaya) mountain, lofty cliffs and
ridges and deep valleys and gullies, on which were sandal, camphor
and other trees. To the east of this was the pu-ta-lo-chia (potalaka)
mountain with steep narrow paths over its cliffs and gorges in
irregular confusion; on the top was a lake of clear water, whence
issues a river which on its wayto the sea, flowed twenty times round
the mountain. By the side of the lake was a deva place frequented by
kuan-tzu-tsai-p'usa (avalokitezvara). Devotees, risking life,
brave water and mountain to see the P'usa, but only a few succeed in
reaching the shrine. To the people at the foot of the mountain who
pray for a sight of the P'usa, he appears sometimes as a pAzupata
tIrthika, or mahezvara, and consoles the suppliant with his answer."
S. Beal, Si-yu-ki, Buddhist records of the Western world, 1884
2.233  says:
"To the east of the Malaya mountains is Mount Po-ta-lo-kia
(Potalaka). The passes of this mountain are very dangerous; its
sides are precipitous, and its valleys rugged. On the top of
the mountain is a lake; its waters are clear as mirror. From
a hollow proceeds a great river which encircles the mountain
as it flows down twenty times and then enters the southern sea,
By the side of the lake is a rock-palace of the Devas. Here
Avalokitezvara in coming and going takes his abode. Those
who strongly desire to see this Bodhisattva do not regard
their lives, but, crossing the water (fording the streams), climb
the mountain forgetful of its difficulties and dangers; Of those
who make the attempt there are very few who reach the summit.
But even of those who dwell below the mountain, if they earnestly
pray and beg to behold the god, sometimes he appears as
Tsz'-tsai-t'ien (Izvara deva), sometimes under the form of a yogi
(a Paazupata); he addresses them with benevolent words and then
they obtain their wishes according to their desires."
