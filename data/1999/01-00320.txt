"Hindu writer who lives in New York"
In response to Bijoy Misra  to objected to my saying:
Sorry, but I'm unclear about where you feel the absurdity lies.  With Mr.
Varadarajan's contention that:
Or do you agree with him [and me, incidently and many others] that such
attempts to delegitimize non-Hindus as less than fully Indian is an absurd
project, if done on the grounds that Hinduism [not just literally the Vedic
traditions--but sanAtana Vedanta in the broadest sense] is _indigenous_ to
the subcontinent whereas Islam and Christianity [if not also
post-Enlightenment secular humanism while we're at it] are intrusive
foreign imports...even after centuries of acculturation in India.
If it is the former argument that you consider absurd, then as an attempt
change your mind, I quote from the Indology archives a letter from Dominik
that got published in Hinduism Today [without his permssion] back in
mid-1995.  His letter had been occasioned by their own publication of an
extremely fanciful, revisionist timeline in which among other things, no
hint of any Aryan migration into India remained:
                >Dominik Wujastyk, Bangalore, India...
Again, I wish to reiterate my acknowledgement that the political dimensions
of academic questions are dangerous and I wouldn't mind if this particular
thread came to an end right away.  I, for one, won't be contributing
anything further on it.
With only good will,
