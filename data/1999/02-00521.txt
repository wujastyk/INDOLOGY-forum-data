On prana.s.ta versus pra.na.s.ta
Sorry, my statement about the Paninian rules needs a correction.  P.8.4.36
(naze.h .zaantasya) prohibits the change of -n- to -.na- when the root
ends in -.s-, as in the form -prana.s.ta-.  Thus, Panini allows
pra.nazyati, but not pra.na.s.ta.  I remembered this exception right after
hitting the 'send' command on my previous message.  Sorry for the
confusion.
