Earlier this week there were problems with the Internet. The trouble began
on Sunday when a transatlantic cable was severed and back-up systems also
failed. This left Britain's largest network, the Joint Academic Network
(Janet), unable to communicate with North America for over 24 hours but
full service is now available.
