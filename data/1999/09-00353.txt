IhAmRga-drama and the question of identification and              aesthetic             experience
one of the purposes of rasa (aesthetic) theory is, i believed, intended to
create an identification with the divine. Aesthetic experience is conceived
of as participating in and identifying with the emotions of God.   One's own
emotions are elevated to that of the divine.  Indeed the general division
between the divine and humanity might be considered Western rather than
Indian per se.  Thus, it is possible to identify with the hero/god not
unlike the devotee identifies with the image of god in puja.  I might
suggest looking to Abhinavagupta's philosophy of aesthetics or Rupa
Gosvamin's theory of bhakti-rasa
"Santarasa and Abhinaagupta's Philosophy of Aesthetics" by J. L. Masson and
