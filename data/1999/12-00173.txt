Vegetarianism is more the result of Jainism than
Brahmanism (or even Buddhism).  Vegetarianism is not
a requirement in many Brahmin communities in the North
although it has been getting popular in many communities
in the last few centuries.

Buddhism (Thervad) allows eating of meat, but not killing
of animals. There is a verse in the Kural, that in the
opinion of some, refers to it.
