This choice is theirs alone. From physiognomy and personal experience, I
think Brahmins are Brahmins. The only way to counter the charges of
oppression is to find similar instances of crimes against Brahmins, and to
show that it was not a one-sided affair. Are there any such cases of `mass
murders of Brahmins' ?

 I can understand the frustration, and it is highly unfortunate that the
present generation is blamed for historic wrongs. Once again, since
reservations occurred in the 1990s, this is outside the scope of Indology.
Indology is a science, reservations are politics. Let us stick to
Indology and the purely academic question of history.
