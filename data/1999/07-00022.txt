Explanation to Chandogya Upanisad, again

      Vidyasankar Sundaresan has already answered partly. Let me quote
from Shankara's commentary:
1. The raashividyaa is simply translated as gaNitam. This, in modern times
is often used as the term for Mathematics in general, but before
systematic development of other branches of mathematics, it was reduced to
Arithmetic - as opposed to geometry!
2. As far as brahmavidyaa is concerned, Shankara says:
brahmaNaH R^ig-yajuH-saamaakhyasya vidyaaM brahmavidyaaM
shixaakalpachchhandashcitayaH |
This roughly means that "brahmas" means the mantras of the three vedas, so
brahmavidyaa is their science, explicitly this is the collection of
shixaa, kalpa, chhanda etc.
Narada goes on to explain that he knows only the meaning of the words, but
does not know aatmaa, or what they describe.  Shankara goes on to
illustrate by an example. You see a big army and  all the royal entourage
and assert "here is the king" even though you don't actually see or know
the king. The detailed discussion is quite interesting and should be read
from the original.
