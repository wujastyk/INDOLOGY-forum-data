Advaita-Chandran
n Thursday, 4 March, Shrisha Rao
I have not been following this thread very closely, but cannot let this
portion slip by without comment. One of zaGkara's commentators,
vAcaspatimizraH, who lived some considerable time after  zaGkaraH, also
wrote various other works, including a commentary nyAyakaNikA on
maNDanamizra's vidhivivekaH, and nyAyavArttikatAtparyaTIkA. The 11th
century Indian Buddhist writers jJAnazrImitraH and his student ratnakIrtiH
name vAcaspatimizraH, these two works, and present sometimes extensive
extracts from these works, which they then refute from a Buddhist point of
view. Their works evidence the persistence of a vigorous intellectual
tradition within Indian Buddhism even centuries after zaGkaraH, that
suggests that Buddhism had neither disappeared at or before zaGkara's time,
nor was it then on its last legs in India.
