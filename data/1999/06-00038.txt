Thanks; I would like to join the list. 

For those who feel constrained by the 2k space offered on mailing list to 
debate fully, I have set up a complementary, unmoderated, virtually unlimited
web space at http://sarasvati.listbot.com The list has 43 current members. 

Each posting to this new list on any academic topic related to ancient indian
studies can be upto 100k size with facilities to include attachments thru
email. Since this is also an archive list, cross-postings to other lists can
be minimized with just an URL reference to the listbot. 

Regards, 
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
