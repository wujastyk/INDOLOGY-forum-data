Mahabharata, Signs of the Zodiac, Moon god
Dear Indologists,
I am looking for bibliographical references, images, or even
a piece of advice, about these different subjects :
- The iconography of the Mahabharata.
- The representations of the signs of the zodiac, peculiarly
  in the art of Gandhara.
- The iconography of the Moon-god in the art of Gandhara.
Thanks in advance,
                         Magali Vacherot.
