a check on the GItA 1.28
BORI Critical edition has in 6.23.28 (GItA 1.28):
dRSTvemAn svajanAn kRSNa yuyutsUn samavasthitAn ||
The variant
dRSTvemaM svajanaM kRSNa yuyutsuM samupasthitam ||
is mentioned in the Critical apparatus as appearing in some MSS of NIlakANTha's
commentary on the Mbh and Dhanapati's subcommentary BhASyotkarSadIpikA
(on ZaMkara's GItAbhASya).
The editions you refer to follow evidently the text of the Northern Recension
in NIlakANTha's version.
Unfortunately I can not check now what variant is used by the Bombay
edition. Shall try to do it tomorrow.
        All the best,
                                Ya.V.
