Wheat is "xOlam" in brahui. Tamil has "cO.lam" (maize, great millet,
sorghum vulgare). In addition, "kUlam" = grain, "kUlavaNikan" = grain
merchant, "kU.lam" = broken pieces of straw, of hemp (in tamil). Also,
"kUlam" is the "tax on grains and pulses". The famous author of
Manimekalai epic is a "kUla vaNikan". "kUli" means pay/wages
(originally paid in measures of grain). This "kUli" > coolie in
english. Central Dravidian has "kUli, kU.di" (grain, paddy).

In IVC, wheat was possibly called *kO.lam/kU.lam.  Brahui xOlam and
tamil cO.lam and central dravidian kuu.di can be easily derived from
this *kO.lam. Note that kUlam refers to "the grain, the wages, the tax
on grains" - all with economic significance.

(1) Kannada "na.l.lu" is reed. In tamil na.l-/na.du- means "center".
Tamil nAzi/nA.lam/nA.di = tube, vein. na.la/na.da > (skt) nada.
Another example: cOza > cO.la/cO.da, etc.,
(2) Dr. yaa.davar > Skt. yaadhava. Similar to these 2 examples,
Dr. *kO.lam > Punjab *gO.dum [Note 1] > Skt. gOdhUma. For the question
of how -a- in *kOLam changes to u/U in godhuma, consider beLa in
beLagaum transforming to veNu as veNugraama attested in mediaeval
insciptions. The skt. popular etymology of godhuuma is "cow smoke".
