Learning Classical Tamil (was: buddhist sanskrit)
Dear Mr. Hodge,
Please contact Dr. John Ralston Marr whose address was provided
by Dr. Jan Filipsky, a Tamil scholar himself, to me once. If you find
out his email, pl. let me know that; In Europe, there may be 20
academics who know Tamil well enough. Dr. Marr is an expert in
Classical Tamil and in Carnatic music too, Daud Ali who did his PhD
on Cholas  teaches now at SOAS. S. Blackburn knows Tamil quite well
(more towards on folklore, middle & modern Tamil,) Zvelebil is in
France; Ulrike Niklas  just left Cologne to join an academic position
at Singapore; At Cologne, Dr. Thomas Malten; At Heidelberg, Dr. A.
Dhamodharan and Dr. Thomas Lehmann, At Paris,  Dr. J-L. Chevillard,
At Uppsala, Dr. A. Veluppillai & Dr. P. Schalk come to mind. Of course, at
Madras, the Inst. of Asian studies, another place to try will be Madurai.
Best wishes,
N. Ganesan

Indian music and other disciplines close to his heart.
