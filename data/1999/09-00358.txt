The solution  to mv i.69.15 " read anupAda (m.c. for -dA) vimukti" is
offered by Edgerton who emends the text, but gives no translation.=20
Mv.1.69.15 runs as follows:
na khu bhavadbhir anupAdivimukti
According to Senart, Mahaavastu I, p. 430 who sees anupAdi as adjective
determining nirvRtI (line 16) , it is to be understood as "no, there is no
liberation free from the upAdi possibly =3DupAdAna (so BHSD) i.e. from any
clinging to existence"  (i.e. final liberation with no rest of life to
live); Jones apparently does not accept Edgerton's suggestion to see
anupAdi as mere corruption of anupAdA(ya): "no, my friends, you
cannot...[be] immune from any source of rebirth".
Leumann and Siraisi translate: "Durchaus nicht soll (oder kann) das von
(jeder weltlichen) Grundlage befreite NirvAANa ....erreicht  werden",
anyway closer to Senart' text treated  more respectfully with no immediate
wish to =ABbettering=BB.
As to anupAdadhI (Rgs: I.9) in the first posting, notice that Yuyama's
edition reads an-upAdu-dhIH  against Conze's  anupAdadhI (sic!) "(his)
thought on non production" (Tibetan skye med blo ldan, while  Yuyama's
Tunhuang rec. A has skye med blo-yis)
