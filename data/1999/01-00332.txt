Well, I wan't referring to "orgiastic groups."  I suppose they had these
in the Malay Archipelago and Tahiti as well.  The idea of yin-yang,
yab-yum, siva-sakti as related to ritual sex though is what I find
common.

There are some Western scholars who would also agree with Tantric texts
regarding Mahacina as well as Indian, Tibetan and Chinese ones.  Samar
mentioned the works of one Indian sch>olar.

The texts state that Tantrism or some doctrines in Tantrism come from
Mahacina.  I agree they don't lie.

Probably more open than you.  I don't have as much invested in centuries
of racial science.
