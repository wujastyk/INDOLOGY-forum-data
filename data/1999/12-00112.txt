I once harboured such views, and also used to consider Brahmins as
`the treasurers of ancient Indian learning' until I read an (apparently
factual) book which seems to prove that the converse was the case -

  `Brahmin Gold' by Prof. Shankar Nadar (full book)
  http://dalitstan.org/journal/brahman/b_gold/b_gold.html

 Those who propagate the view of the `poor learned Brahmin' of Manu must
refute all the points raised in Prof. Nadar's book. There are too many to
be discussed in a single post, but perhaps the most forceful ones made
are:

- The Magadhan spy system and forced labor camps of Pandit Kautilya on
  the lines of the later Soviet Union seem to have killed millions.

- The Muslim `invaders' discovered huge quantities of gold hidden in
  Brahmanic temples. This `Brahmin Gold' was the prime source of the
  astronomic wealth of early Indo-Muslim courts; ie. wealth seems to have
  been concentrated in the hands of Brahmins at ca. 1000 AD.

- The famines during Anglo-Brahmin rule killed millions.

This is a good point. But Prof. Nadar seems to show that it was Pandit
Kautilya who was more to be blamed. For recent exploitation, it seems
Pandit Nehru and his descendants are at fault.

But was not Pandit Kautilya the founder of Communism ? Is not Marxism in
India itself mainly supported by upper castes ?

Here Mr. Nanda seem to consider the Brahmins as `Hindus'. I remember some
time back Mr. Nanda was trying to show that Dravidian temples were built
by Brahmins instead of Tamils by citing some Adivasi tribes who lived in
forests, ate meat and practiced cannibalism. Both things are not possible:

1. Either Brahmins are `Hindus' and are also part of the cannibalism,
flesh-eating and wine-drinking practiced by Adivasi `Hindus', but not
guilty of `oppression',

2. Or Brahmins are separate from Dravidians, Adivasis etc. and, whilst not
guilty of cannibalism, would thence be automatically guilty of some
historical crimes of oppression.
