Hello Edwin,

just a question: How far has the process come? Laurie Patton told me that we
would get some kind of contract in connection with this book, but so far, I
have not received anything. BTW, the Norwegian book to which I am contributing
on the same subject is being published these days. So scriptorial work does
bear fruit, eventually!

Best regards,

Lars Martin
