Book Review: An Update on AIT (Part 1)
Dear Mr Agarwal,
Please, PLEASE keep your postings to the size recommended for INDOLOGY
postings (re-read the Rules).  The size should not be more than about 2k.
Your book review is three times this size.  This is exactly the type of
posting for which the mention of a URL would be ideal, and perfectly
sufficient.
I must caution you seriously that you risk being denied access to INDOLOGY
if you persist in posting messages significantly longer than the
recommended maximum length.
Sincerely
Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
