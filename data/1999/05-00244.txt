Dear Shri. Agarwal,

I am intrigued by this; In Tamil, KOyil is the most common
word for the temple. kO + il = kOyil (with the glide, y).
kO could mean either God or King. Usually in Hindu temples
the deity is treated like a King. How far back Aligarh Koil
goes in time? We have any stalapuraNas, inscriptions, etc.,?

Can you please explain more on the Kawaria cult? Is anything
written about them?

BTW, what is the formation for gOpura?
Is it IE? or more like kO + pura(-tal), protecting a temple/palace.
I believe James Harle has a paper on gOpura.

Kind regards,
N. Ganesan
