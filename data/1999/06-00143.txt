Historicity of The Flood
I think there *may* be a bird motif in the Tamil version of a *similar*
incident
described in the cangkam text (<3rd century AD?)
paripADal poem #3 addressed to tirumAl (viSNu):
"
uzi Azik kaN iru nilam uru kezu
kEzalAy maruppin2 uzutOy enavum
mA vicumpu ozuku pun2al vaRaLa an2n2ac
cEvalAyc ciRakarp pularttiyOy en2avum" (paripADal:3:...)
kEzal = wild boar; an2n2ac cEval = male swan;
txln: " ...[you] who, as the fearsome wild boar, plowed the earth
during the apocalyptic flood with the tusk and
who, as the male swan, dried [the earth]
the waters poured by the great skies  with the wings".
