Dear Mr. Iyer:
Details on the Chowdhury book:
       Caudhuri, Paramesa:
       Indian origin of the Chinese nation : a challenging,
         unconventional theory of the origin of the Chinese ....
        Calcutta : Dasgupta & Co., 1990
  I have not read the book, so cannot say any more. I saw the book in the
Anthropology stacks. Hint: Anthropolgy of Scholarly Ideas ?
Good luck.
