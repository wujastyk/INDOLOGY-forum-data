Who either grasps or does not grasp Buddhism is not a land, but those
intent on being Buddhists. And there is no need for the whole country's
population to follow Buddhist precepts in order to Buddhism be preserved
in such country - if this were true Buddhism would never have existed
even in India. Besides many Buddhists have been reported to be strict
vegetarians, for instance, in Tibet.

To sum up, you seem to be overconcerned with futile generalizations
and judgements, which definitely keep you far removed from any benefit
you could derive from Buddhist teachings, no matter how vegetarian you
may be.

Not being as much of a specialist as you would wish, it may be interesting
to remark that the literature of the three of Theravaadins, Sarvaastivaadins
and Mahaayaanists refer to the three of S'ravaakas, Pratyekabuddhas and
Bodhisattvas.

Also, although the first three (as well as many others such as
Sautraantikas) are differentiated in terms of their tenets, the last
three are differentiated in terms of their paths and fruits.

Non-specialistically (and non-futilely) yours,

Julio.
