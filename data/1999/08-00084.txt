The "Grand Cross" generally refers specifically to the solar
eclipse of August 11.  During that event, you have a close opposition
of Mars and Saturn occuring at nearly 90 degree angles to the
eclipse.  Uranus is also in opposition to the Sun and Moon.

Some connect the Grand Cross to Nostradamus' prediction concerning
the year 1999.  Strangely, even before Nostradamus, the Kalajnana,
written around 1000 years ago, predicted grand events for the same
year (Kali 5101).

The Kalajnana, written in Kannada and Telugu, predicts the arrival
of Kalki in the form of Sriveerabhoga Vasantaraya.
