Why use phrases like "calling your bluff"? I do not know Ramadas from
Adam and I have no need or desire to mislead him. The question of
whether the bhAgavata refers to the devI bhAgavata or the vaishhNava
bhAgavata has been a much discussed point among Indian scholars for
many centuries now. H.H.Wilson says that the vaishhNava camp quotes
one of Madhwas statements that he has seen 8 commentaries on the
bhAgavata to prove its antiquity. He adds "Now amongst these is one by
the monkey Hanuman; and although a Hindu disputant may believe in the
reality of such a composition, yet we may receive its citation as a
proof that Madhwa was not very scrupulous in the verification of his
authorities" (preface to vishhNupurANa, page 30). Now Wilson may be
wrong, but if my recollection is right I told Ramadas that some of my
sources were secondary and unverified.  If Wilson is completely
incorrect, I am willing to update my knowledge.
