Silence
Friends,
once upon a time... I came home from school rather annoyed. 'Some boys keep
calling me names!' I beat them up but still they go on. My brother suggested
that the only way to avoid this is complete silence. Do not react at all!
I tried. It was very hard, but I could do it (I was 11 then). And it worked.
You are older now: it will not be difficult. If you do not want to try it
for yourselves, do it for me, please.
Do not answer silly (idiotic - impolite - etc.) messages. A single line is
too much.
Thank you,
Ferenc
