Date of the Buddha and RV
  Madhav Deshpande writes:
Isn't that going a bit far ?  Surely the date of RV is partly
dependent on the dating of subsequent Vedic literature of various
kinds ? Are you prepared to say that the date of the Upani.sads is
unrelated to the dating of the Buddha and Mahaaviira ?
