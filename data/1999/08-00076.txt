Yes, true-- Sorry, I should have clarified the specific phenomena.  The
11th is noted, but this is specific to the 17th-18th of August (elsewhere
in teh rather long posting I received it acknowledges the 11th as a first
step toward this more rare phenomenon.

So, stillinterested if anyone knows about that aspect of this alignment in
