Some of the Ancient Greeks, including Aristarchus of Samos, Philolaus of
Tarentum & Heraclides of Pontus, placed the Earth and other planets in
motion around the Sun, with the earth spinning daily on it's axis.  This
was well before either Aryabhatt or Copernicus. This idea, however, was
rejected by the people in favor of Aristotle's geocentric theory.

Claudius Ptolemy wrote in Almagest around 140 AD that the Earth was
motionless because constant gales would sweep across it if it were in
motion. It was Ptolemy's theory of 'epycycles' which was adopted by the
Roman Catholic Church.

Copernicus aparantly knew of the work of the Greeks.
