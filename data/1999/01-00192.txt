FW: Deepa Mehta's _Fire_
Happily, I stand corrected: it is only the last film in the trilogy that
remains unfinished. See below:*
For a second, more positive review of _Earth_ I'll be forwarding a
statement by Georgana Foster.
*_The Canada-based mehta was headed for Varanasi to script _Water_, a film
about widows and the last in the trilogy.   _I was in mid-sentence, it was
a scene about an eight-year old widow getting her head shaved and I
stopped.  what's the point?  It will never be passed. I can't write in this
climate._  It's this climate of insecurity that has se the alarm bells
ringing." INDIA TODAY INTERNATIONAL, December 21, 1998, p. 41
