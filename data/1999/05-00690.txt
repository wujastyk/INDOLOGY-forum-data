In classical Tamil,
kuNDu = deep  as in
"kuNDu cun2ai pUtta ..." (tirumurukARRuppaTai:199)
-->"...[flowers] that blossomed in deep rock wells..."

" tiN tEr kuzitta kuNTu neTu teruvil" (perumpANARRUppaTai:397)
-->"in the long avenues with deep imprints by the [treads of]
 strong chariots "

There are other phrases such as
"kuNDu kaN akazi" (puRanAn2URu:21:2)
-->"deep moats"

It is also worth noting the  family of words employed in CT
such as "kuDam", "kuDai", "koDu"  etc., in the sense of curved,
crooked, bent or spherical.
kuDam = pot; kuDai = umbrella;
koDu = crooked; kODu = shell, conch.
