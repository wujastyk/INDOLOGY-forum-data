Mr. Hebbar,

Please read my posting again. It is not I that is confused between the
various Krishna idols in Udipi. I did not say that Hastamalaka established
*the* only Krishna idol in Udipi. I'm well aware of different Smarta and
Madhva traditions. All I said was that the tradition of Hastamalaka's
establishing *a* Krishna idol in Udipi is known to one particular text, but
that the story *in that text* has come down in a garbled manner. How would I
know that the story is garbled, unless I knew the distinction between what
Madhva did and what Hastamalaka is said to have done?

Good day,
Vidyasankar
