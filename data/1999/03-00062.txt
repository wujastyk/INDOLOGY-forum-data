Anusvaara for word-final 'n'?
John Smith writes:
        As far as the usage of the MS goes, I have noticed the same thing
that a word-final 'n' is often turned into an Anusvaara, before 'l' and
before other consonants as well.
        However, the only Paninian authority for turning a word-final 'n'
into an Anusvara is in sandhis like devaan+ca > devaa.mzca.  Here, Panini
offers an option of an Anusvaara / Anunaasika vowel.  The only other
context where an 'n' can change to an Anusvaara in Panini is in
word-internal derivational contexts:  kuru+anti > kuru+a.mti > kuru+anti.
To a non-Paninian, such a derivational process may seem strange.  However,
this process prevents this 'n' from changing to '.n', because the rule of
retroflexion of 'n' after r/.s does not recognize this 'n', it recognizes
the Anusvaara, which cannot be changed to a retroflex '.n'.
        Anyway, apart from cases like devaa.mzca, there is no Paninian
sanction for turning a word-final 'n' into an Anusvaara.
