Dear Members:
While surfing on the net I stumbled on a nonexistent URL linking for
Sanskrit writing on Mesopotamian mathematical problems. I don't know how
I got there, all of my attempts to retrace my path failed. Does any body
know about such writings? Any references? Thanks in advance-Narahari
Achar
