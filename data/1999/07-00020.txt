The conception of Rama
Aditya, the Hindu Skeptic wrote:
I see no reason to presume that this is a "status of the widow"  sukta. There is
also no reason to presume that  going to the devar was without a formal ritual
which could have been other than niyoga. That women were considered "property" and
all that is an attitude that only prjects a self-made " superiority " of the modern
notions. Niyoga is not any more superior or freedom-giver than serial monogamy
. That sati came after niyoga / compulsory marraige to devar is also a presumption.
All these practices have coexited, their beginning and end cannot be ascertained
much less any evolutionary development.
I agree that Rama's janma is made miraculous but as a take off from the more mundane
practice of niyoga. IT may have not have been done by adi Valmiki but by later Valmikis.
Have a very good day.
