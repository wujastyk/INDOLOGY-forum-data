Yes. Kannada change of p to h is during the historic period, i.e 10th
century. It cannot be a borrowing from Kannada. Burrow in Dravidian Studies
VII traced
Skt. kalanka- (51), kalaha (54), kalaapa (56) to the group of forms to be
reconstructed as *kal-a (DEDR 1303, 1299). In the last chapter of Sanskrit
Lanaguge, he added Skt. kalu.sa- to this group. Ta. kalaavu, kalaay 'to be
displeased, to get angry, quarrel' have a long derivative vowel which looks
to an underlying laryngeal *kal-aH-wu/-y, in which case h in kalaha- could
be a reflex of a PD laryngeal. Only Old Tamil has long -aa in the derivative
syllable. I have to look for parallel loan words with h preserved in Skt.
pa.taha- (186) is the other in Borrow'a list, but I cannot see anything to
support a laryngeal there.There are several alleged borrowings in Skt. with
aspirated stops corresponding to unaspirated ones in Drav.
Gondi -h <-s is a kind of causative suffix; ND x is a regular development of
PD *k when not followed by high front vowels.
I wrote a full-fledged paper on PD laryngeal; it surfaces as aaydam  (a
h-type of sound)in Early Tamil and as h in some of the other Dravidian lgs.
Prof. Witzel, see if you can get hold of  a copy of PILC Journal of Dravidic
Studies 7:1 (1997; actually out in 1998 March).(PILC=Pondicherry Inst of Lg
and Culture).

I think *kal represents several homophonous roots giving rise to different
groups of words: 'noise' (1302), 'mix, join' (1299), 'learn'(1297), 'stone'
(1298),'to accrue, grow' (1300, 1310), 'disturb, agitate,stir up, quarrel'
(1303)[both Skt. kalaha- and kalu.sa- seem to belong here].
Burrow (1948) gives the meaning 'bundle' as the basis of semantic connection
with 'peacock's tail' and compares it with Ta. Ma. Ka. kalappu'collection of
things, mass' etc.(1299).
