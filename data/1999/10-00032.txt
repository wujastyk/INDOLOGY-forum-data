As far as I know, this project has no plan in its etymological aspact
to go beyond Sanskrit into the early history of its words in relation
to other linguistic stocks in India, as it is not yet established
conclusively. Of course, there were (and still may be) Tamil
scholars on the staff of the project, but they were all Sanskritists.
