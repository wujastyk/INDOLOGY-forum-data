Pythagoras mentioned in Vedas?
Dear Lars Martin Fosse:
This is just a short letter to tell you that I am <truly> sorry if I have
<personally> offended you. I thought that I just scrutinized some
argumenents that potentially I thought were yours. Once again, I am truly
sorry if I in any way disturbed or offended your person.
That doesn't, however, mean that I like your way of doing statistics. I
still don't. :-)
greetings from a sunny, but chilly Toronto.
Bo Klintberg.
