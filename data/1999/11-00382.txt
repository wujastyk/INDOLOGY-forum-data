Both are scholarly, have bibliography,  although the Weber is heavier than the Crawford title.  The Crawford title discusses the umbrella and parasol in India and Greater India.  Weber discusses both sunshades (with a single pole) and canopies (with 2, 4, or more poles) as belonging to both human dignitaries and divinities.  The parasol of honor was clearly in use in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Achemenian Persia.
If one wants to investigate the parasol's use in India prior to currently readable written records one should look at the Harappan Culture seals to see if they show anything like it. Even the use of baldachins/canopies for gods might show that protection from the sun was reserved for some for honor and not allowed to all for convenience and comfort.
