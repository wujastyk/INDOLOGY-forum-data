Re Potala(ka), etc

   I am little confused here. Does *malaya* in maNimEkalai 1-3
   does not belong to Potikai/Potiyil?
   UVS, the great editor says so. Also, A. Danielou and T. V. Gopal Iyer
   do the same.
   If Chevillard DOUBTS UVS' and T. V. Gopal Iyer's identification
   of *malaya* in Manimekalai 1-3 with Potikai, what is his guess?
   Sincerely,

Potiyil/Potikai
