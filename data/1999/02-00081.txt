Use of avagraha
If you've ever seen the old Calcutta edition of the Mahabharata (the first
printed edition), the text is printed continuously almost without breaks.
Presumably, in those early days of Skt printing, the editors wanted to
imitate manuscript practice--or did it have something to do with oral
recitation?
