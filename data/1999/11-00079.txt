Hi, all Tamilologists (if that's what we can call you)

When I recently asked for advice about learning Classical Tamil, some
of you were kind enough to give me useful suggestions, for which I
thank you.

Just one more enquiry.  Does anybody know of a Tamil-Sanskrit or
(better) Sanskrit-Tamil dictionary.  My assumption is that if any such
work exists it would be pre-modern.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
