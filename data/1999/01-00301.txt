Interesting.  I'm not familiar at all with Sir William Jones'
thoughts on linguistics, except for the famous paragraph in which he

I do know that a rather well-known Indo-Europeanist from around the
turn of the century (whose name escapes me right now) did indeed
propose a relationship between Indo-European and Austronesian
(Malayo-Polynesian).  It would be interesting to know if he had been
in any way influenced by Jones in this.  What is your source for
Jones' thoughts on IE and MP?
Led astray by the script, no doubt.
