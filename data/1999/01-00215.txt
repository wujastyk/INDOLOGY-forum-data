SV: SV: Sanskrit translations in Nazi hands

Well this would be the first time then that I have heard that Tamils
had anything similar to a classification approaching the Arya-Dravidian
division.  However, I wonder it the term "arya" here is not referring
to meter rather than language.
Is the sole evidence that Mr. Palaniappan presents that Tamils
classified "Sanskrit and its derivates" (from which I presume he means
Indo-Aryan languages) as "Arya?"
