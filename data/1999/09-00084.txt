Are you trying to suggest that not a single Hindu has been killed in
India since Independence ? I find that a fascinating insight into your
view of India, and a question surrounding your scholarly motives in
studying Indology. Perhaps you might want to read literature
highlighting the issues surrounding the genocide of Kashmiri Pandits
in Kashmir and the genocide of the Hindus in Bangladesh and
Pakistan. The "numbers" you have posted above will pale in comparison.

Whatever your ulterior motives for studying Indology, I appeal to you,
please do not insult the dead like this. Surely Islam also teaches
that in some form or the other.


With warm regards,
