Sanskrit dance and drama
Perhaps good time to ask. Jan Gonda, called as one of
the greatest living scholars of Veda in his last years,
served as guide for this work.
Indu Shekhar, Sanskrit drama: its origin and decline,
E.J.Brill, 1960 (2nd ed., Delhi, 1977)
A must reading for anyone interested in Indian dance and drama.
This work places so much importance to Dravidian contributions
in the development Indic dance and drama. I wish either Sekhar from Kerala
or Gonda knew Tamil; it would have been even more helpful.
How do Sanskritists rate this work?
Sincerely,
V. Iyer
