Your (and not only your) basic problem is that India is more than you think
it is. Much more. Apparently the postings on this list fail to convince you.
But perhaps you will find out for yourself in due course of time.
What I find personally very hurtful about these 'discussions' on this
once-upon-a-time academic list is that I too could have been a computer
programmer or something else that is comfortable in the Western world.
Instead, I studied Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages, spent more
than half of my life learning about Indian culture and have been living in
India for almost 16 years, with my very Indian (yes, rural brahmin, with a
family history that has literally been carved in stone for a thousand years,
for your information) wife and hence half-Indian daughter. -- I will not go
into further personal details. But can you understand that I am annoyed (to
put it mildly) at being accused of being 'anti-Indian' by NRI astronomers
and computer fellows who have left India for a life in the US? I honestly
believe that I do not deserve this. Also, I think I should not respond to
any further such totally immature postings.
