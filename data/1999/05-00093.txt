                                   This worm and other trojan-horse type
programs demonstrate the need to practice safe
                                   computing. One should not execute any
executable-file attachment (EXE, SHS, MS Word
                                   or MS Excel file) that comes from an
email or a newsgroup article from an untrusted
                                   source.
