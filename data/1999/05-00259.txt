INDOLOGY Digest - 10 May 1999 to 11 May 1999 (#1999-55)
With  regard  to  comedian  Nagesh,  I  have  heard  that  he  was  a
KonkaNI-speaking  SArasvat  brahmin  who  are  all  SmArtas.  They  are
not  be  confused  with  the  GauDa-SArasvats  who  are  MOSTLY
MAdhvas.  This  is  the  first  time  I  have  heard  that  he  is  a
KannaDa-speaking  MAdhva.  Interesting!
Thanks  for  the  info.
Regards,
