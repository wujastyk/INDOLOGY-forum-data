. Also, with no
critical edition for ashtadhyayi available , is that section in
the original or in a later layer?

I refer you to Astadhyaayi sutrapaatha edited by Pt. Yuddhstthira Mimamsaka
(Ramalal Kapoor Trust). Hereein, the editor has given the textual variants
and has incoprorated appendices to record the variant readings, additional
aphorisms etc. found in various manuscripts. This could lead to some
insights.
