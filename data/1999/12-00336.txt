The calssical tamil text patiRRuppattu refers to an actual river
called "vAn2i" in the Cheral empire:

"cAntu varu vAn2i nIrin2um
tIm taN cAyalan2 man2Ra tAn2E"  (pat:86:12-14)

meaning "[the Cheral king poRaiyan2] is much more pleasant than the sweet
waters of the vAn2i river which comes down carrying sandal woods".
