Subject: Ashtadhyayi Teacher at Delhi
Message-ID: <161227049265.23782.4982117788614333304.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dr. Allen Thrasher had asked about availbility of a tutor of Ashtadhyayi at
Delhi for his friend. I suggest that the following places be contacted and
they can direct him to numerous scholars of Ashtadhyayi in and around Delhi:

1. Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha
Dayanand Bhawan (Near Delhi Stock Exchange)
Asaf Ali Road, Delhi- 110006

2. Arya Pradesh Pratinidhi Sabha
Arya Samaj Mandir Marg
New Delhi- 110001
Contact Mr. R. N. Sehgal at 343718.

Please note that I am not an Arya Samajist and therefore am not trying to
prosetylize anyone. However, I know that they do have numerous scholars of
this text in and around Delhi.

Secondly, with due regards to you and your friend (who I am sure is already
adept at Sanskrit), I am really skeptical if the Ashtadhyayi can really be
completed in 2 months. Therefore, your friend could buy a lucid commentary
on the same while at Delhi. I recommend the following Hindi commentary (in 3
volumes)

1. Ashtadhyayi Bhasya; Pandit Brahmadatta Jijnasu; Publ.- Ramlal Kapoor
Trust. This text should be available from the shop of the Publisher on Nai
Sarak (close to the Fatehpuri end) or any other Indological Book shop on the
same road.

The author of the above has also written another 2 volume guide to the
'Ashtadhyayi' which aims at enabling the student master the text without
rote in 6 months. The name is 'Bina rate rataye 6 mahinon mein......." This
might also prove useful.

He could also purchase the 'semi-critical' text of Ashtradhyayi by the same
publisher.

Hope I have been of some help.

Best Regards,

Vishal

PS: I am currently reading your "Advaita Vedanta of Brahmasiddhi." Very
insightful work. Two years back, I tried to obtain a copy of your Doctoral
thesis via ILL but got a note from Harvard saying that I will have to buy it
for $35    :-(
