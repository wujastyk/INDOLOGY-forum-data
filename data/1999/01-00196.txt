I don't have the reference at hand, but I seem to recall that Ivan Strenski
has written about Eliade and about Berger's criticisms in a book on 4
figures in Comparative Religion (all my materials are in the office --
sorry), and he went to the trouble to check the British documents, at least
some of which -- *if* I recall correctly -- do not say what Dr Berger said
they say...
