Bhavisya Purana
In reply to Vishal Agarwal's message of 10 Jun 99, 16:21
Thank you for the detailed explanation. The correspondences VikaTAvaTI =
Victoria and KalikAtA = Calcutta were already clear to me, but not so the
meaning of GuruNDa. However, in the VeGkatezvara edition I have not come
across the mention of "Hulbert" as VikaTAvatI's spouse, but of PulomArci,
which is rather more difficult to connect with Albert.
Many other late characters are mentioned in the printed BhSP in corrupted
form, including  BAbur (BAbara), HumAyUn (HomAyus), Akbar (Akabara),
AurangzEb (NavaraGga), etc. As for Jesus the Messiah, the rather singular
story of Iza MasIha / Izaputra is  found in BhSP III, 3, 2, 21 ff.
