Subject: Shells in Ayurveda, addendum re crabs
Message-ID: <161227050133.23782.555541895303571597.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In my posting "Shells, starfishes, and sea urchins in Ayurveda" I
meant to include that my patron is also interested in the economic
uses in Ayurveda or otherwise of the shells of crabs and other
crustacea.

Thanks for any help.  I will be looking at Watt's old publications on
economic products of India and books on Aryurvedic materia medica.
