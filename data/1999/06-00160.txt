I am looking for the following article:

Ashok Aklujkar: "Praamaan.ya in the philosophy of the Grammarians".

This article is referred to in Aklujkar's "The number of pramaan.as
according to Bhartr.hari" (WZKS 33/1989), where it is mentioned as
scheduled to appear in a felicitation volume in New Delhi, 1988. I would
like to know whether it was ever published, and if so, where/when ...

Any information will be greatly appreciated,
