Buddhist revival movement in India
Yes  indeed  there  are  Christians  in  Israel  and  for  that  matter
Muslims  too;  but  their  mother  tongue  is  Arabic  not  Hebrew.  In
fact,  I  too  have  an  Arab-Christian  acquaintance  who  has  a
"Muslim"  name,  reads  his  Bible  in  Arabic  holds  an  Israeli
passport  and  sighs  "Allah"  when  things  are  not  "going  his
way".  BNH
