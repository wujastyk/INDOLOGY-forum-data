Earliest writing system in the world: Harappan
Hi,
I have made the following posting at: http://sarasvati.listbot.com
[Context: BBC interview with Prof. Meadow on May 2, 1999]
Would appreciate comments. Regards, Kalyanaraman
"Please see and hear some audio clips from the BBC interview with Prof. Meadow
on May 2, 1999 (who has recently participated with Prof.Kenoyer in the
