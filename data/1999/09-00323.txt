Subject: Correction to post Sanskrit words ending in cerebral N
In-Reply-To: <19990919215222.57662.qmail@hotmail.com>

Outside grammatical terms, final retroflex N does not seem to occur
freely.  One example that I have noted is _bhAN iti_, which as far as
I recall occurs either in the BAU or the ChU and seems to be
quasi-onomatopoetic in nature.  (Note similar violations of ordinary
phonotactics in expressions like _jhaT iti_, without voicing of _T_
to _D_.)
