Once I gave the TiruviLayATal purANam poem starting as "collAmal
colli" which explains Dakshinamurti teaching thru' silence.
Palaniappan gave some examples from Tevaram on this concept.

But Shiva teaching through silence goes back to Classical
Tamil sangam era. Take the Kalittokai poem 1.

In this poem of Shiva and Parvati dancing together and which cannot
be post-dated than 3rd century CE, Shiva's qualities
are described. Here "Shiva teaches Vedas to Brahmans,
holds Ganga in his hair, destroys the tripura,
teaches through silence, transcends all the teaching
as understood by humans and is a ferocious fighter"
(an approximate translation for the first 3 lines).

Looking at the words "kURAmal kuRittu atan2 mEl cellum kaTum kULi",
Shiva teaching through silence and transcending all that
teaching as understood by humans becomes clear.

     ARu aRi antaNarkku aru maRai pala pakarntu,
     tERu nIr caTai karantu, tiripuram tI maTuttu,
