Explanation needed for the word 'angula'
Dear list-members,
Can anyone tell me whether the word 'angula', which is used for a
measure of length in the Brahmanas and Sutras (and possibly also
many other places), literally means 'finger'?  I am curious as to
whether this unit was intended as being the breadth of a finger.
Any help would be appreciated.
Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
