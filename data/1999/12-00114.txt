Brahmins and Dalits (was : Jnanasambandar:)
Samar please give it a rest. All this Dalitstan stuff is just politically
motivated and is devoid of any historical or factual value. It just aims to
shock readers with its preposterous allegations.
For a good background on Dalits and other backward castes - what they were
and what lead to their present condition - economic and social, read
Kosambi's works on Indian history. And it can hardly be labelled as biased,
as the author himself is a Marxist historian.
