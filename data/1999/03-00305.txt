Are the bhakti's root words in Sanskrit, 'bhaga' & 'bhaj' related
to the Tamil words 'paku' and 'vaku'?? All of them have the same
meaning. Does 'bhaga' have cognates with Old Iranian and/or IE?
The first use of 'bhatti' occurs in a Buddhist text. Har Dayal,
Bodhisattva doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit literature, p. 32,
"In fact, the very word bhakti, as a technical religious term,
occurs for the first time in Indian literature in a Buddhist
treatise and not in a Hindu scripture. The TheragAthA speaks of bhatti:
so bhattimA nAma ca hoti paNDitO ~natvA ca dhammesu visesi
assa (p. 41, lines 1-2). This anthology contains verses that go back
to the earliest period of the history of Buddhism, and its final
redaction took place in the middle of the third century B.C."
