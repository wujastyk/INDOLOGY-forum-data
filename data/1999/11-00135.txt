I am wondering why  Naama  and anka  are not conclusive enough to indicate that writing
that spells "Rama" existed. This is even more conclusive than Kalidasa's Meghadutam in
which the Yaksha tells the Cloud that his wife shall be heard singing a stanza
containing his name , " Mat gotraankitapadam geyamudgaatukaamaa"

I suppose the cardinal question is not whether writing was known in Valmiki's time (if
that is certain!) but whether the technlogy of writing was inluential in communication,
education, preservation of texts and so on?

At what time does the impact of writing show itself in India? A useful field of research
for indologists perhaps!
