Thanks, Dr. Jean-Luc for useful info.

What I have tried to show is that
plausibly, "karunal" meant karumbu, kan2n2al.

Campantar's usage *karunal paravai kamaz kAzi*
may well refer to this archaic word since
1) 'paravai' can refer to "land/field" (cf. paravai mAnilam
in cIvakacintAmaNi)
2) 'kamaz' = 'issuing fragrance' does NOT usually refer to
sea in Tamil literature
3) On the contrary, the one poem before "karunal paravai",
"kaTi kamaz pozil cUz" occurs (Fragrant gardens).
The very next poem to "karunal paravai" is
"kamazntu Ar pozil cUz k."

I agree it will be great if one more usage of karunal
as kan2n2al, karumbu can be found; I will ask
tamizp pulavars in India.

Let us take attested usages:
1) parutti, pan2n2al = cotton
2) karumpu, kan2n2al = sugarcane

Is the "ru->n2" change similar in both?

Kind regards,
N. Ganesan
