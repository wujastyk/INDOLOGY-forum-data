Therefore the rest of your comments seem to be outdated.
It is just possible that he may have hit correct conclusions by wrong
means just like conjecture by Kanad about the atomic structure long
before any scientific proofs were available for examining them.
That was exactly my point for posting to this particular list to
investigate if his assumptions can be supported or contradicted by other
cultures. I would suggest some other scholars to see if further research
is needed in this direction.
Yes, I am aware of people like Velikovsy who have interpolated myths of
different cultures to reach conclusions unsupported by other scientific
disciplines. But does Jaynes' work fall in that category o not. I have
just found that there is an active Julian Jaynes society that is
interested in further discussions on this topic.
Not necessarily. Comparative linguistics is very useful tool in tracing
the early unrecorded history.
Is there anything wrong in proposing that evolution is a continuos
process and most of the current evolution is homo sapiens is in
development of the brain structures? Psychology is still as primitive a
science as biology was before the discovery of DNA  or physics was
before the invention of atomic theory.
