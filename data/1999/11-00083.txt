Subject: Connection between Yama, yamI and yamunA
Message-ID: <161227053348.23782.7238810487818860020.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Can anybody please explain the relationship between Yama, yamI and yamunA?

  I get the impression that in Vedic literature, yama and yamunA were twins
who were the children of vivasvAn. However, in Post Vedic literature, yama
became the God of death and yamI became the twin of the God of death while
yamunA was/became the name of the river.

My questions are
1. Is this interpretation correct? If not, please correct the record
2. What is the connection between yamunA and yamI?How did the river get it's
name?


Looking forward to your answers,
Regards,
Krishna
