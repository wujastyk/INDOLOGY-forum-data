  Great Indologists have always written that Dravidian loans
exist in RV, esp. in maNDalas 1 & 10.

  I do not see Aiyangars or Tamils accepting your opinion that
Aiyangars are not brahmins.

>But are the SivAchAryas authenticated as brahmins? And even if they

  Adhisaiva Sivacharyas are true brahmins because they preserved/added
to the entire corpus of Saiva aagamas. Always, saiva aagama
publications are based on the mss. from those Sivachariyar homes.
For their marriage habits, pl. read the 12th century PeriyapuraaNam
of Sundarar.

  There is enough evidence, both from Skt. and Tamil sources,
that brahmins' numbers increased manyfold by intermarrying with
Dravidians in ancient India and later.
