Kalaapa
In the astrological texts I am studying, the word kalaapa frequently occurs
in contexts which seem to suggest the meaning 'strife, quarrel, fight' etc.
However, I do not find this meaning supported by the standard Sanskrit
dictionaries available to me. Have list members come across such uses of
kalaapa anywhere?
