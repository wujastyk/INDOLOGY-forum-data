The Fodder of First causes
Chris Beetle wrote:
In Christian theology there is a tendency to assign qualities to God.
For example, it is said that God cannot lie, break promises or do other
things that we judge as morally wrong. The proofs of such beliefs are,
of course, subjective just as they are elsewhere.
One could say that in order for free will, or maybe, purusha, to exist
there must be samsara. Without samsara there is no purusha.
