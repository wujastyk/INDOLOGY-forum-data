Correction: Re: Book Review: An Update on AIT (Part 1)
Dear Indologists,
Earlier, by mistake, I posted the uncorrected version of the message. The
post had mentioned  the name, Ramaswami. The correct spelling is Ramaswamy.
Also my name was truncated as "S. Pala". I apologize for the errors.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
