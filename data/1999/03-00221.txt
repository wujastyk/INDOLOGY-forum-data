          Professor Witzel,
          The following may not be substantiated etymological
explanation you are
          seeking, but merely sharing a few thoughts I've heard or
inferred.
          The word 'aaRu' is the most popular
          word for 'river'. It means, primarily, a 'way, course'.
          The root sense (etymological)  comes from 'aRu' = to cut (
hence to
          make a way). The word porunai also could mean 'that which
cuts'.
          The word peNNai is supposed to refer to a 'female palm' which
is
          supposed to be hardy at the outside but soft inside. It is
supposed to be
          a generic name (with such a property). In the case of it being
used
          as a river name, I would *guess* that it may refer to the
strong embankment.
          It may also mean that it (the river) is 'sweet' (in the sense
of being desirable,
          from the sense of peL > peT > peTpu = desire; this was already
pointed out
          by Dr. Palaniappan  in this list).  Another name for river
          is vENi and it is also considered to come from vEL > vET
          Other words for river are OTam ( meaning 'that which runs',
OTu = to run)
          and punal (meaning water 'flowing').
