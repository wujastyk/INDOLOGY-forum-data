* This is true, sort of. If you have the HLK, 8.5 and 8.6 come with an
* updater which updates the various resources needed for HLK. OR you can run

* although even these are not what you would call elegant. Bottom line: with
* 8.5 and 6 you don't need HLK, although its still for sale, if you wish all
* the fonts which come with it.

* The following information is from Apple:
*
* * Apple language kits and Mac OS 8.6
* Apple's language kits require an updater for full functionality with Mac
* OS 8.6. If you have language kits installed on an older system you are
* updating, or if you install a language kit after installing Mac OS 8.6,
* be sure to run the Language Kit Updater, located in the CD Extras folder
* of your Mac OS 8.5 CD. This is the same version of the Language Kit
* updater for Mac OS 8.5. If you are updating from Mac OS 8.5, and have
* already updated your Language Kit, you do not need to run the Language
* Kit Updater again after updating to Mac OS 8.6.
