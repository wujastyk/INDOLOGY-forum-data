Have we not discussed this already? See my post of 5 July 1998 entitled, "Re:
Sanskrit, centamiz, and diglossia"

As for as the brahmin was considered, it was almost mythical. As for the
Jain, it was part of another text. What the episode does show is the
importance of grammar as a field of study for Tamils.

By and large, I agree with Ganesan's view. cIrkAzi's importance was
associated with campantar. Moreover, the number of hymns has no perfect
correlation with a city's importance. Like tillai, Madurai also had only 11.
But Madurai has always been more important than cIrkAzi. As I said in the
essay, Chidambaram had become associated with the royal houses. See also
Zvelebil's work where he discusses the Chola queen cempiyan2mAtEvi's interest
in Chidamparam. No wonder Chidambaram rose to the top of the sacred sites.

Apart from this, one may need to look into the possibility of different cults
associating with different temples, much like different mutts controlling
different temples today. As a cult loses its following, the associated temple
may lose its patronage also.
