The only Buddhist epic?

        Apart from it, there was one more. It was "KuNdala KEsi".
It was also one of the Five Big Kaappiyams. It was lost in later
times.
        But 99 verses from the original work have been found.
        The other Kaappiyam - "VaLaiyaapathi" also got lost.
        72 verses from this also have been found. From
        what has been found, most some scholars are of the
        opinion that it, too, might be Buddhist. But it does look
        more Jainistic.
