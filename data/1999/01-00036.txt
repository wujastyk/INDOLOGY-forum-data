Too Many Postings?
Recently, I have had a bit of trouble posting messages to the list.  As a
result, I may have posted a particular message too many times.  It was a
quotation from Shamkara's BRAHMASUTRA BHASHYA,  Adhyaya II, Pada 2, Section
32 (in which he is sharply critical of the Buddha and Buddhism).
If you received this message more than once, please forgive me!
