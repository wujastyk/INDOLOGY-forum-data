Is "Sanskrit" Dravidian?
Hello Ganesan,
I don't have Masica's article at hand. The full reference is:
Colin Masica: "Aryan and non-Aryan elements in north Indian agriculture",
in *Aryan and non-Aryan in India*, 1970 [Univ. Michigan, ed. Deshpande and
Hook]. 
It is a long detailed article.
Also, if you have not seen it, you'll find this useful:
Franklin Southworth: "Ancient economic plants of South Asia", in *Languages
and Cultures: Studies in Honor of Edgar C. Polom?*, 1988 [Trends in
Linguistics Monograph 36, ed. M.A. Jazayery & W. Winter].
