Pronunciation of word final
Yes. And in fact, a long 'a' is sometimes introduced metri causa, especially
in case of meters like 'Chaupai.' This meter requires 2 'Deergha' wovels at
the end of each 'carana.'
An example of Chaupai's in Awadhi is of course the Ramacaritamanasa. Some
relevant examples:
1. Agey chaley bahuri raghurAyA
2. jinha key sravana samudra samAnA| KathA tumhAri subhaga sari nAnA||

Pronunciation of word final "a" in Sanskrit
Could the Hindiwallas on this list confirm or disconfirm my impression
that in Hindi (including Awadhi etc.) verse sometimes the final "a"
that would be present in the corresponding Sanskrit word but is lost
in ordinary speech is actually pronounced metris causa?  And is this
true of other "a"s lost between Sanskrit and Hindi?  Is this true in
some of the other modern Indo-Aryan languages If so, does that mean
that they have been there all along and are usually deleted but in
some deep sense retained?
