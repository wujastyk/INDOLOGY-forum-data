Subject: Traditional Panchangam calculations
Message-ID: <161227053472.23782.4932805148988556373.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,

Does anyone know if their exists a study (or thesis) about how the
traditional makers of Panchangams do their calculations in practice.  What
I'm really looking for is a field study from someone who actually went
around and compared the algorithms from different practitioners.

Yours,
