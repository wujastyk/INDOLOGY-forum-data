It is true that the utsava-mUrti is known as Parthasarathy.
However, from Tirumangai Alvar's paasuram (which is the
basis for this discussion), it is clear that the deity within
the temple was regarded as "the one who stood in front of
Arjuna's chariot".  I fail to see how this means that the
mUla-bEra is different from the utsava-bEra in identity.
