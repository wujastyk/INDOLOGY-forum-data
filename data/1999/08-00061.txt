IABS Conference/Programme available
Dear list members,
The programme of the XIIth IABS Conference is now available for
download at http://www-orient.unil.ch/
(Please don't ask me a question of `What's-this-PDF-thing?' type. I'm
not something like "For-Dummies" book :-) )
Best wishes,
Toru Tomabechi
