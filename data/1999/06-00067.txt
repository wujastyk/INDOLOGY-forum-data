dakSiNAmUrti stotra, and Tamil and Kashmir zaivisms

In a footnote in p. 136 Isayeva writes, "In a striking simile found in one of
the zaivite texts, ziva keeps coming to the soul as an unknown, dark lover
who only after some time becomes gradually "recognized" and accepted; only
then the real merging together becomes possible, and the soul "melts away"
(vilIyate) into ziva's entity."
There is no reference given.  However, when I read this, it brought to my
mind so many suggestions of Tamil devotional poetry of nAyan2mArs and AzvArs.
Does anybody know if there any non-Tamil precursors for the use of such a
simile?
