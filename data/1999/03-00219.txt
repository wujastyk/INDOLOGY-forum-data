No one will  doubt that but:
This is what I wonder about. Again not the prevalence of plam trees, but
the most common river names are 'white' ,"milky' (= quick, in the
mountains), and 'black (=slow, in the plains), or red (if full of mud as in
monsoon, or iron), etc.  Then, of course, 'crooked" etc., etc.
Of course, you can name a river after peculiar local landmarks or natural
phenomena as well (Wind / Snake/ Beaver river, in Wyoming, Colorado etc.,
Double Mountain Fork in Texas, Red Deer in Alberta, Canada), and I guess
there must be a Fir River or Lake somewhere in Canada...
But such names are not so typical as the others... That is why I would like
to hear from the linguists what the Drav. roots and their meaning  of
peNN-Ar/ai, Porunai etc. would be ....
(colored) - leaved River?
I really wonder: why all these PennAru (A.P., sic, on my map) , PeNN-ar/-ai
rivers in the South if there is no(?) good etymological explanation...?
