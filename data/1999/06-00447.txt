Cape Comarin(Kanyakumari)in Greek Texts
Reply to Sujatha Stephe's querry.
Periplus of Erythraen Sea (A.D 100?) speaks of Comari(Kanyakumari) while
dealing with various harbours of Ancient Tamilnadu. The author of the above
work was an anonymous Greek merchant from Berenike on the Egyptian side of
the Red Sea Coast (R.A.Jairazbhoy,1963:p116).
