Bharati taught at Syracuse univjersity until his death from brain cancer
in 1990.  Our dept. library is dedicated to him and we can provide other
information about his bibliography (which is on line, actually) as needed.
I just saw the other note. Bharati was Austrian, definitely, and not
British. His "real" name was Leopold Fisher and he grew up in Vienna.
