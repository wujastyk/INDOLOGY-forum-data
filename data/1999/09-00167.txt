Kuiper intentionally included all  words he regarded as *possible*

demonstrated.
Apparently the principles of producing proper IE (Drav., Munda etc.)
etymologies are not well known (for a check list see K. Hoffmann, Aufsatze
zur Indoiranistik, vol.3, Wiesbaden 1991),
 as can be seen from the following sentence:
this is *not*  correct :
e.g., IE *pelek'u- (Greek peleku-, Ved. parazu-)   would be good PIE
according to Elst,
but the word structure betrays it as an early IE *loan* from an unknown
language (not Sumerian, it seems, as the word in question means 'spindle'
not 'ax'  (see Mayerhofer's etym. dict. for details).
As soon as linguistic arguments are introduced into the "Aryan"  (=
Indo-Aryan) debate, we see this kind of naivite' or misinformation...
Already in 1955, Kuiper has pointed out a number of religious terms (Fs.
Kirfel, Bonn 1955), (reprinted in  IJDL, v.21, no.2,)  such as:
zambara,  pizaci, kimiidin, nicumpuNa,
puNya, mangala,
the religious connnections of the trees udumbara, azvattha, pippala,
the kumbha myths,
the EmuSa myth (also in a separate paper, 1950)
and the possible Drav. connection of the sage/star Agastya/Agatti
(astronomy only: ulkaa 'meteor')
much of this repeated/summarized  in his 1991 book Aryans in the RV.
So why this misinformation?
That is the point: interaction is on the level of VILLAGE life, not of big
traders and great cities... which does not bode well for an overlap of
speakers of Vedic with the Indus civilization...
Rather, this fits interaction of IA with local language(s ) *after* the
relapse of the Indus civ....
(why not before? --  see in older /other msgs)
