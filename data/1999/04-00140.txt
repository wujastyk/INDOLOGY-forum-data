Given that even the Great Goddess, benign and peaceful,
has not established Herself in 3-4th centuries A.D.
within the Sanskrit orthodoxy and the Rise of the Goddess
in the Hindu tradition manifests fully only after
few centuries, a `devotee of Kali' is an intersting name.
In Tamil literature, hundreds of works by non-brahmins are available
praising varnashrama system. May be a lip service to suit
the All India pattern. Praising varnashrama alone does not
point to brahminship, I guess.
