Well this would be the first time then that I have heard that Tamils
had anything similar to a classification approaching the
 Arya-Dravidian division.  However, I wonder it the term "arya"
 here is not referring to meter rather than language.
>>>

 Tamil meters are akaval, veNpA, viruttam, tAzicai, cintu, kalittuRai
 and so on. The arya in Appar quotes (2 were provided) does
 not refer to any meter/metrics (Tevaram is not a grammar, you see)

 Tamil literature does not know of any Arya meter.

 Aryan in Tamil denotes IA speakers.
