Kuiper seems to have pursued this further in his book "Aryans in the
Rigveda", p. 19. In a section dealing with music and dancing, he lists
AghATi' - sound of cymbals; karkarI' - a kind of lute; ga'rgara - a lute or
drum?; dundubhi' - drum; nALI' - flute, pipe; pi'Gga - a musical instrument;
ba'kura - wind instrument, vANa'-, vA'NI - music, voice; sasarpari' - war
trumpet; and AGgUSa' - song of praise. He also says that the "list of
Bharata's sons who acted in the mythical first dramatic performance
(bhAratIya nATyazAstra 1.26-39) consists for the greater part of names of
indigenous tribes. He also says there are non-Aryan names/words for actors
and singers in the Vedas.

Among the words listed by Kuiper, I am intrigued by the word nALI. In his
book, Kuiper mentions it twice as being non-Aryan. For him, one of the main
reasons to consider it non-Aryan is the inter-vocalic retroflex. But,
Mayrhorfer  relates it to words in Nuristani, Parthian/Middle Persian,
Hittite, and Armenian and reconstructs an IE *ne/od-o-/-i-. Can IE experts
say who is right?  Kuiper or Mayrhorfer? Given the close proximity of these
IE branches, how certain is this etymology compared to a word  such as Skt.
pitR? Thanks in advance.
