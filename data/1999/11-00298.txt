kUlavatI
kUlavatii river is given in Monier-Williams. Which purana
mentions this river? Is it a legendary or real one?
What is the traditional explanation of the name, godAvari?
Consider kUlam 'grains' and  *kOLam > ta. cOLam and brahui xolam.
Is *kOLaviri > *gODaavari > godAvari admissible?? (cf. kAvEri and
ta. kAviri).
