        There is a claim that tiruvaLLuvar is the same as Elacharya, who
is said        to be  the Jain Sri Kund Kunda Acharya, who is believed
to be the Tamil.
        Sri Kunda Kunda is one of the most highly regarded Jain Acharya.
The claim
        that tiruvaLLuvar is a Jain is a completely invalid one.  The
tiruvaLLuvar's
        philosophies are quite different from Jainism, Buddhism , and
Vedic which
        does not mean they have some common themes (say somewhat like
those between
        Islam, Judaism and Christianity). The tiruvaLLuvar's
philosophies
        accurately reflect capture the Tamils'
spirit-philosophy-culture.
