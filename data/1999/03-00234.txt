Information on summer Telugu from Professor Velcheru Narayana Rao

SUMMER TELUGU LANGUAGE COURSES
Intensive Study June 7 - August 15, 1999

Two consecutive five-week sessions make up the intensive ten-week Asian
Languages Program.  The first session is offered June 7-July 11 (session
code CEE) and is followed by The second session, July 12-August 15 session
(code HEE).

Two sessions are the equivalent of two semesters of study.  Students may
take either one or two sessions.  Classes in each session meet four hours a
day, five days a week. Together these sessions provide students with the
equivalent of one complete year of language training. Unless otherwise
noted in the official summer timetable, undergraduate and special students
earn ten credits in the ten-week period; graduate students earn eight.

Telugu is the second largest language of India spoken by about 60 million
people.  Telugu-speaking people, commonly living in the state of Andhra
Pradesh, are characterized by their use of very expressive and musical
language which has continuous classical  literary tradition from the 11th
century and a dynamic modern literature. Telugu is equally well known for
its great oral literature.

LangAsia 303 & 304. Elementary Telugu Intensive teaches script and focuses
on conversational and reading skills. Students do not need any prior
knowledge of the language.

The class room atmosphere is user-friendly, intense but enjoyable. The
progress that students make from virtually no knowledge in the language to
a level where they  comfortably converse in Telugu on ordinary  topics
related to daily life is highly rewarding.

Usually students who want to go to Andhra Pradesh to do their fieldwork
have taken  this course.
