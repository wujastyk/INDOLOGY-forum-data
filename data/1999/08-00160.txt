Subject: Rajatarangini references and "vidyAdhara"
Message-ID: <161227051707.23782.16652019129991278509.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,

I need help with two issues.

1. Monier-Williams gives the following references from Rajatarangini for
"cAkrika":

 "a companion" Rajat. vi , 272 ; "a companion" , v , 267

I would appreciate if anybody can give the actual text and conventional
explanations for these two occurrences.

2. Does the Sanskrit tradition ever associate vidyAdharas with music-making
(similar to gandharvas)?

Thanks in advance.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
