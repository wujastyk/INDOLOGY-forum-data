Rajatarangini references and "vidyAdhara"
Dear Indologists,
I need help with two issues.
1. Monier-Williams gives the following references from Rajatarangini for
"cAkrika":
 "a companion" Rajat. vi , 272 ; "a companion" , v , 267
I would appreciate if anybody can give the actual text and conventional
explanations for these two occurrences.
2. Does the Sanskrit tradition ever associate vidyAdharas with music-making
(similar to gandharvas)?
Thanks in advance.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
