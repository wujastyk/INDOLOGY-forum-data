Mian Abbas und Padre Zyndenbos
Hell Mian Abbas,
I am really impressed by your proofs that most people of North India are
foreigners. In fact, your name also reminds me of the Iranian Abbassids. I
really liked your equation Shaiekh = Arab, because it reminded me  of a
proverb of Bengali Muslims--" Today I am an Ansar. If my crops are good this
year, I will become a Shaiekh. And if they are good next year also, I will
become a Sayyad." I also had a Pakistani (Balochi ) friend who was 1/16 Arab
because a great grandfather was an Arab. And he was so proud that he is
superior to Pakis because they are Indians while he is an Arab!
I am all for empowerment of women. Whenever you launch an agitation for
Muslim women (Nikaahed or Talaqued or those "Whom the right hands of Muslim
men possess"--Koran) to tear their viels, abolish polygamy, give maintenance
to Shah Bano and also save little Ameena from the old Abdullah. I will be
ready with my slogans:
Aaj ki naari phool nahin chingari hai
Hamse jo takreyaga choor choor ho jayega.

I am really happy that you gave me that website address. It shows how
millions of Indian bahans are killed every year. I will now read that report
to find out why every 3rd child that is conceived in the USA is aborted. Or
why the ISLAMIC republic of Pakistan has the lowest Women : Men ratio in the
world. As a return favor, I am listing the addresses of some Islamic
websites here. If these are not ISLAMIC enough, tell me. I will give you the
address of Taliban and Hamas.
