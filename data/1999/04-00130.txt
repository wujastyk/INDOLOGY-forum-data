Dear Nanda,

according to Karl H. Potter's Bibliography (in Encyclopedia of Indian
Philosophies, Vol. I) there is an English translation by S. Suryanarayana
Sastri that appeared in: Madras University Department of Indian Philosophy
Publication 1 (1933), and also: Journal of the Madras University 4 (1932),
Supplement; 5 (1933) pp. 81-114

No, it's not: it is the rule. As a matter of fact we don't really *know*
anything about kAlidAsa himself.

Yours, Ferenc
