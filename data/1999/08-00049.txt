I realize that I am responding to a rather old posting.  Anyway, I got
the above-mentioned book on the library.  There seems to be no
mention of the Pythagorean theorem nor mention of any
"Bhadrabahu."  In fact, in the introduction the translators state that
Sa'id al-Andalusi "is able to cite the name of only one Indian
scholar, 'Kanka al-Hindi.'"  This Kanka al-Hindi does not appear to
have any relation with Kalpasutras or the Pythagorean theorem.
Do you still have a copy of that clipping?  If Arabian scholars really
made comments about the theorems discovery in India I would be
very interested to learn more.

I hope this meets you well.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
