CSX+ fonts & cross-platform email exchange
Also, Windows98 with Word really does not like some of the encodings (with
ASCII codes directly above 128); the printer often goes mad from them
(irregular spacing etc.).
Of course no sane person would use Windows - if he has the choice. It seems
many of us do not have.
Any solution?
