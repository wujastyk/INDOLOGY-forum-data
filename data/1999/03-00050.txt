Gita translations
I've been impressed with Harry Spier's diligence and attention to detail, but
it got me to thinking. I read somewhere long ago that the Gita is one of the
most translated texts in the world (perhaps second only to the Bible).
My question is, is there one translation into English that is generally
recognized as the best translation? If so, what is it? If not, why not?
