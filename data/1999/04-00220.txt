Subject: Buddh. Rockcarvings in Northern Pakistan

Buddhist Rock-Carvings and Inscriptions in Northern Pakistan.

At
http://www.thewalt.de/verlag.htm
those interested in the northern ways of Buddhism will find some
links to articles and work in progress -- most of them in German,
but translations into English are being prepared.
Of course it would be most interesting to do a thorough documentation
of the carvings and graffiti on the Indian side... --- any offer
is highly welcome!
Best,

Volker Thewalt
