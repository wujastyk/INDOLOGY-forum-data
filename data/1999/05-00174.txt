Q: eddress of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University
Friends,
can anybody help me with the e-mail address of a respectable sanskritist at
the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Benares? (The name may be misspelt
as I have never seen it written.)
The general idea is that a colleague and I want to spend a few months in
India studying the still living Sanskrit tradition: how it is spoken, how it
is traditionally taught, how different kinds of texts are recited etc. A
friend suggested the above-named university as a good starting-point;
however I would be also grateful for alternative ideas, provided the
suggested institute has e-mail. (I must get some reply from them very fast
because of the grants deadlines here.)
Thank you in advance,
Ferenc
