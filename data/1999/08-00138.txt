tohna river
  Sri. R. Raghava Aiyangar in a 1908 tamil article
in the research jl., centamiz (founded by Ramnad Sethupathis)
quotes many poems that write tozunai for yamuna. RR says
that Ptolemy uses tOhna. Due to tamil alphabets, it could
mean dohna as well.
Don't know whether RR meant this "Touna" taking it as
ta. "tozunai". Is Touna a town on the banks of Yamuna?
Or the Ptolemy's info insuffiecient to determine?
Does Diamounas have any variants?
Like Doulounas, Diolunas, etc.,?
Thanks,
V. Iyer
