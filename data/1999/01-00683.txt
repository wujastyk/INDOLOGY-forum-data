Pongal/Sankranti
         ANdAL ThiruppAvai's 27 th poem is the one you must be having in
mind:
"...
kUtArai vellum sIrk kOvin-thA!....
Atai utuppOm athanpinnE pARchoRu
mUta ney peythu muzangkai vazhivArak
kUti irun-thu kuLirn-thElOr empAvAi"
        It does not mention that it is sweetened with
jaggery or such item.  It says "milk rice covered with so much
clarified butter (ghee) that the ghee drips to the elbow".
Is there any connection with the word "vellum" and the "vellam"
(misspelt in the original posting: meaning jaggery)? The first word
means "vanquishing (enemies)".
I agree with this. silappathikAram's (2nd century AD) Aychchiyar kuravai
on thirumaal and kunRakkuravai on Murukan are telling examples of bhakti
with quintessential
Tamil sentiments and formalisms. ThirumurukArruppatai is even more
serious form of Bhakti composition.
I feel that if there was any Bhakti in Jainism and Budhdhaism
it must have been basically derived from the preexisting bhakti
sentiments and practices.
