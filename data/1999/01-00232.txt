>?From my reading (though not recent) of Chari's summary of Desika's
Tattvamuktakalapa, I seem to recall a doctrine of two kinds of jnana:
essential consciousness (svarupajnana) and attributive consciousness
(dharmabhutajnana), the first being the actual substance of the atman, and
the second, its attribute. These were likened to a flame and its radiance,
respectively. I also have a faint memory of reading something similar in the
Yatindramatadipika. So my question is: have I misunderstood Chari's (or
Desika's) intentions in making consciousness the substance of the atman, or
is this a post-Ramanuja doctrine of visishtadvaita, or is van Buitenen just
a little rash in completely denying jnana the role of a substance/essence?

Many thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
