Deepa Mehta's _Fire_
Belated thanks to Subrahmanya for this citation:
...
With respect I beg to differ whenever current events appear to shed light
on [or conversely, call for some from] Indological source texts and images.
As a related [firey] example, from this week's news:
     India Network News Digest - Jan 21, 1999
Obviously, this is reminiscent of the numerous SELF-immolations that
transpired [plus a few of the aided-and-abetted variety] during the
anti-Mandal protests of 1990-91.  If anyone is interested I could scan and
post a poignant IndiaToday cover showing a Delhi university student's
Levi's going up in flames before his box of matches hits the pavement.
So here's my serious Indological query to Thiru Ganesan [whom I had the
pleasure of meeting for the first time this week] and others:  "what's with
this fire thing?"  To the extent that there ARE deep indological roots that
reach back through Sita's  Agni Pariksha and beyond, might they be traced
further back or more significantly to Vedic sources, or the
Tamilian/Dravida/IVC side of the genetic ledger?  Ie., are we better able
to understand these horrific contemporary events as reflections, however
distorted, of a Fire god as priest/intermediary twixt god and man, or more
akin to Dravidian fire-walking praxis?  Can anyone cite an early Tamil, or
Sanskritic textual reference to the latter practice. Or is it only noted in
print first, along with hook-swining, etc.,  by Abbe DeBois in the 16th c?
