The New Catalogus Catalogorum
Dominik,
Yes, the New Catalogus Catalogorum project is invaluable to all of us for
whom Sanskrit textual study is vital.  My sense for a long time has been
that morale at Madras and especially in the Dept of Sanskrit has been quite
low (understandably) for several reasons and that, along with the absence of
funds(one of the morale reasons) may be a key point.  If we did try to raise
money (say by subscription), I would want us to be very careful overseeing
that it is spent directly on the project's production.
My best to you and Julia,
Dan
