Q: intervocalic -k- preserved as intervocalic -g-
Dear Dr. N. Ganesan,
Are you sure agasti is derived from Drav. akatti?  Rather tan the reverse or
both from a third language?  As for the seemingly derived name Agastya, Eric
Pirart (Les forces du mal dans la Rgvedasamhita, Journal Asiatique 1998/2,
if I'm not mistaken) explains it as a loan from Iranian, a-gast-, "without
foul smell, without sin, impeccable".
Yours sincerely,
Koenraad Elst
