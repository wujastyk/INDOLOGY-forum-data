Murugan in Washington, D.C.
Are the pujas and archanas going to be conducted according to the Tamil
tradition...or  as usual, in Skt. as in most other temples even though
we have a temple for the archetypal Tamil god? Your mention of perUr
aDikaL gives hope that it might the former.
But minus kaRpu (chastity) ...:-)

Chandra
