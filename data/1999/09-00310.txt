To Everyone:
INDOLOGY postings *must* be restricted to the study of Classical and
Ancient India.
I ABSOLUTELY INSIST THAT DISCUSSIONS OF CURRENT OR RECENT POLITICS DO NOT
APPEAR ON THIS LIST.  SEVERAL MEMBERS SEEM UNABLE TO SHOW THE COMMON
DECENCY OF FOLLOWING INDOLOGY GUIDELINES.  I AM BEGINNING TO CANCEL
SUBSCRIPTIONS WITHOUT WARNING WHEN LIST GUIDELINES ARE NOT ADHERED TO.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
