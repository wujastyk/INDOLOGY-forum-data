In that case, the earliest reference linking Kaladi and Sankara is a Tamil
inscription that belongs to the 20th regnal year of mARavarman2
cuntarapANtiyan2 I (1235-36 A.D.). The inscription (SII 5, no. 431) is in the
nellaiyappar temple in tirunelvEli in Tamilnadu.
The interesting aspect of this inscription is that it does not refer to
Sankara directly. Instead, it refers to a Pandiyan official/chieftain who had
a linga installed at the temple in the following words:
"kAlaTiccaGkaran azakiyaperumALAn2a mazavarAyar pUcittu ikkOyilil
AzrayalimgamAka ezuntaruLuvitta cokkan2Arkku.."
Here a person has been named kAlaTiccaGkaran (Sankara of Kaladi). If we take
this person to be the father of azakiyaperumAL, the mazavarAyar, then the
father should have received the name probably towards the end of the 12th
