It appears that in addition to the 3 groups as above
viz., HemmigeyAr, MandayattAr, Hebbar, there are other
groups who call themselves TirumalaiyAr, BhattarAchAr,
MarudUrAr, Prativadi BhayankarattAr, SomAsiAnDAr,
NallAn ChakravartiyAr, embAr, IcchambADiyAr,
kILanATTAr, ATTan kUTTattAr etc.. Some of these are
endogamous while some others e.g., the NallAn
ChakravartiyAr, are exogamous by definition.
I'm sure one can get a lot more from a source book
such as The Mysore Tribes and Castes.
Thanks and Warm Regards.
