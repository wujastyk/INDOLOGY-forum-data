Original Sanskrit Names
Mr. Bothra:
The  word  "Lakhan"  is  itself  an  indicator  that  it  is  the
"prAkRta"  of  the  original  Sanskrit  "LakshaNa".  The  word
"Lakhanoudh"  itself  may  have  been  made  into  Lucknow  but
"Lakhanoudh"  itself  was  perhaps  adopted  only  during  the  Islamic
times.  We  have  to  go  further  back  than  that.  Probably
"Lakhanoudh"  was  itself  a  contraction  of  "LakShaNapuri,
AyodhyArAjya".
