Dr. Yaroslav, thanks a lot for the guidance.
If smas'a_na was a compound (asma s'ayana or stone bed), and in relation to

"There are clear evidences showing that certain sections of the Aryan
community began to make solid brick structures instead of heaps of earth, or
of stones covered with earth (White Yajurveda, xxxv. 15), and that the urn
(asthikumbha), containing the bones and ashes and covered by a lid, came to be
buried after the dead body had been burnt(As'valaayana G.rhya-Suutra, IV. 5;
Saaya.na on the .Rg-Veda hymn (X, 18)."

of a wheel...(http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/peacock.html)
Could there be any connection with 'tumba' as the navel of a wheel?
