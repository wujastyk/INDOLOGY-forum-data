hayragreva
Dear list members,
I am looking for references to hayragreva (spelling?) the horse headed demon
and the Vishnu avatar of the same name/appearance.  Any suggestions as to
sources I could look into either visual (i.e., temple engravings, etc.) or
textual (translations or source materials)?
Regards,
Benjamin Fleming
