Tibetan Origin of Tantrism and Siva

That goes for Confucianism. We are talking about mainly Tibet and perhpas
Taoism. Taoism does not display the attitudes you mention.
But the first Indian Tantric, Vasistha, learned Tantra in Tibet (cf. the
first post in this thread). Moreover, Japanese scholars go to the USA to
study Christianity. That does not imply that the USA is the home of
Christianity. It is possible that East Indics further developed Tantrism,
and were hence in great demand in Tibet. They were not in such great
demand in India, from the exodus to Tibet, and otherwise they would not
have gone.
Again, this is based on dating etc. and is subject to revision.  Many of
the Tantras survive only in Tibetan and in no other language.
As per legend, the ancient Bon dieties were subjugated into the Buddhist
pantheon. It is only natural to assume that the rites with which they wer
worshipped also entered Tibetan Buddhism in this way. Budhism in Tibet did
not eradicate the pre-Buddhist deities, it subsumed them, and in turn got
modified. Thus, one still can reconstruct the Bon religion.
Bon pre-dated Buddhism. It experienced late revivals after Buddhism came.
That depends on the dating of the Tantras, and the survivability. I can
always say that the older ones are lost, and we will reach a stalemate in
this. Those that survive mention Tibet as the source.
That is why they confused Tibet with Mahacina. Mahacina, or Great China,
is not mythical. It is known that it was situated beyond the Himalayas.
Hsuan Tsang and Fa-hsien must have told some people about China.
The invasion from China after Harsha's death must have instilled some
sence of China.
Would like to see some quotes stating that the 5th Veda fell somewhere
outside Tibet, and that Vasishta travelled to somewhere other than Tibet
to learn Tantra. The vast body of literature has so far not furnished us
with any other sources.
Any Tibetologists are welcome to contribute their learned opinions.
There are several similarities, the technique of retention, for instance.
The postures prescribed are also very similar.
Then Shiva-Shakti is the same as Yin-Yang.
This is based not just on a similarity of Sivas. There is anthropological
and genetic proof of the unity of Dravidian and African peoples. If the
Dravidians came from Africa, then they may have brought their religion
along as well.
