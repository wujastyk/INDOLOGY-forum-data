Day is night in Dravidian?
It is worth noting in this context that Classicl Tamil seems to employ
the word nizal in the  contradictiory senses of shadow *and*
light/lustre/brightness.
"nizal tikaz
nIla nAkam nalkiya kalingkam..." (cirupANARRuppaTai: 95-96)
"....vEl nizal ...."  (malaipaTukatAm: 88)

I also see that in CT, the word "nizal" is used for shadow or image
as well as for light, sheen, lustre.
