ABOUT THE PROGRAM

Taxila Academy is designed for college students interested in
learning about India. The program accommodates up to 30
students from around the world. In 1999, Taxila Academy runs for
about 6 weeks, from the 18th of June to the 26th of July.

Students at Taxila Academy select two courses each, from a total
of six. These two courses correspond to about 6 credits of junior
or senior college level work. Coursework is supplemented with
special lectures, workshops, movie screenings, and excursions
during weekends. Classroom and field experiences complement
one another to enable focussed discussions on a representative set
of topics concerning India. Courses have been designed to appeal
to a range of students who might be interested in India from
socio-economic, political, philosophical, or cultural perspectives.

PROGRAM HISTORY

Taxila Academy was established in 1995 by New Strategies in
Education, an independent initiative based in India, the UK, and
the US. The summer program was first held in 1996, when
students from the United States, Canada and India collected in
Bangalore for an intensive six-week introduction to salient features
of Indian history, culture and society. Former students of Taxila
Academy attended premier colleges and universities around the
world, and have continued to pursue their interests in India after
their experiences on the program. Unlike other study-abroad
programs in India run by American universities, students at Taxila
Academy have the opportunity to study with Indian academics,
intellectuals and social workers. Our faculty has trained in India
and in other parts of the world, and so provides our students
special access to South Asia's rich intellectual resources.
