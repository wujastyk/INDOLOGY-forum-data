On 'patra/pattra' again!

Could you make clear just how far you are going here, Madhav? I have no
problems with your remarks on put(t)ra, but how many other -tra words are
suspect in your view? Surely not astra, zastra, zAstra, pAtra, chat(t)ra,
vaktra, etc., etc.? If not all cases, then which ones? And what is the
basis for discriminating between them (so that pat(t)ra is suspect but --
presumably -- zastra is not)?
