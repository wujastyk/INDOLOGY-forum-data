T and z(_l). From Classical Tamil,
"pularAk kAzakam pulara uTIi"(tirumuru. 184); here, kAzakam = sAri
"vin2aimAN kAzakam vIGkak kaTTi"(kali. 7); here, kAzakam = a hand
glove and this "kAzakam" is similar in meaning as for "kaTikai"
attested in CT.

zATI/sADaka have close relationship to tamil
kATikam(sAri)/kATakam(sAri)/kAzakam(cloth)/kAzakam(glove)/
kaTikai(cloth/bracelet/necklace)/kaTakam(armlet). The root verb
is kaTTu (to wear, to tie, etc.,)
