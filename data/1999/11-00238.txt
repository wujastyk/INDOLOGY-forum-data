Parasol in India
Please help me with this question:
In temples, a (white) parasol is held over the deity in procession
(utsavam/ta. uurvalam) routinely. Kings are regularly described
having a parasol while in court. Does this imagery of a king under
parasol occur in late vedic texts? What about the epics?
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
