They are mentioned in the Tibetan medical texts such as the bDud-rtsi
sNying-po (Ch 12) -- "there are classifiactions of 101 ailments with
reagrds to the 3 hunours, 101 with regard to principle ailments, 101
with regards to the locations, and 101 with regards to general
categories of ailaments".  I have also seen 101 allocated to each one
of the 3 humours and a further 101 for combinations.

Hope this helps.

Best wishes,
