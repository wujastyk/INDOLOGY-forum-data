Subject: Young teachers in Vedanta tradition
Message-ID: <161227054725.23782.15567507894416005680.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Tamil tradition, the fountainhead of 'emotional' bhakti movement
among the masses all over India, is full of young or child acharyas.
St. Sambandhar drinking the sivagnana-bodham milk fed by
Uma herself is famous. "*pOtam* mulai curantu aLitta puNNiyat
tAyAraiyum" - on Mother's breast-feeding from PeriyapurANam.
Even Subrahmanyam has taught his father the meaning of "Om"!
MeykaNDaar, the saint who started the saiva siddhanta philosophy
in tamil wrote his very brief "sivagnAna-*bOdham*" and, MeykaNDaar
is the young teacher of the elderly AruLnandi Sivacharyar.
St. Kumaraguruparar wrote his works starting at the age of 5.

In the Mimamsa/Vedanta tradition, are there any saints who started
preaching young (besides Sankara)? Did Upavarsha, Krtakoti, Bodhayana
Bhaskara or Sabara, ... start their teachings early in their life?

N. Ganesan
