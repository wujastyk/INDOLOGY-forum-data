Young teachers in Vedanta tradition
Tamil tradition, the fountainhead of 'emotional' bhakti movement
among the masses all over India, is full of young or child acharyas.
St. Sambandhar drinking the sivagnana-bodham milk fed by
Uma herself is famous. "*pOtam* mulai curantu aLitta puNNiyat
tAyAraiyum" - on Mother's breast-feeding from PeriyapurANam.
Even Subrahmanyam has taught his father the meaning of "Om"!
MeykaNDaar, the saint who started the saiva siddhanta philosophy
in tamil wrote his very brief "sivagnAna-*bOdham*" and, MeykaNDaar
is the young teacher of the elderly AruLnandi Sivacharyar.
St. Kumaraguruparar wrote his works starting at the age of 5.
In the Mimamsa/Vedanta tradition, are there any saints who started
preaching young (besides Sankara)? Did Upavarsha, Krtakoti, Bodhayana
Bhaskara or Sabara, ... start their teachings early in their life?
