Question on Jnaneshvari
In the english translation of the Jnaneshvari.  (translated from the
Marathi by V.G. Pradhan and edited by H.M. Lambert) in chapter 10
between Jnaneshwars verses 203 and 208 are inserted verses 22 and 23 of
the Bhagavad Gita (from Radhakrishnan's translation)  but they are in
the reverse order that they appear in the Bhagavad Gita proper.  This
makes them agree with Jnaneshwar's verse commentary as written in this
edition.
Could someone possibly tell me. If verses 204 through 208 in this
translation agree with the Marathi original.  And also in the Marathi
original are the sanskrit verses from the Bhagavad Gita usually inserted
and if so is it usual to reverse verses 22 and 23 in chapter 10.
Thank You
