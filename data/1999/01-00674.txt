Hello,

I've read accounts about the ancient Nalanda University
near Patna, Bihar (India) being destroyed during the early
12th cent. by Moslem invaders (khalji?). It's said that
a large section of the residents there were killed.

Does anyone have a detailed account of what happened
there and which centers were actually destroyed?

thanks again.

peter
