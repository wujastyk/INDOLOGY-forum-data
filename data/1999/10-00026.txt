I intend to work about curses, enchantments and miracles in the Hindu and
Muslim context in ancient India, particularly in the medieval times. In
consideration of the extent of the literary sources, which can hardly be
sifted through by myself I'd be grateful for any hint to texts, passages
etc. dealing with the above mentioned subjects, no matter published in
Sanskrit only. Thank you for any efforts.
