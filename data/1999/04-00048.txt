     Turner's CDIAL 6936 for 'naDa' suggests :'possibly through contact with
     Dravidian Kannada naLLu 'reed' , Tamil nel 'hollow' and cites
     Thomas Burrow.
     There are many words in Tamil like noLLai, nALam  etc. which will
     show that the a hollow or tubular structure is the root sense .
     In tamil such a structure is called 'uTTuLai'.
     I don't have DED handy but I'm sure there should be connections there.
     What Madhuresan says is different.
