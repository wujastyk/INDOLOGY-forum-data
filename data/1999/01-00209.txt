Dear Indology members,

Does the Sri Parvatam in the Southwest corner or
Nagarjunakonda in the Northeast corner of the mountain
range in AP have any inscriptions saying that
grammar was taught there? Any texts or Chinese pilgrim
say that?

I do not know anything pointing to grammatical tradition
in Nagarjunakonda or Sri Sailam.

Malaya parvata, one of the kulaparvatas of India, has
a long tradition of preserving and teaching grammar
attested in texts for 2000 years.

Thanks for any AP data,
N. Ganesan
