George Washington is Siva (was Re: Word splitting...)
  So far as I could read in Indology,
  Dr. N. Ganesan's thesis is
  "Mt. Potalaka is Mt. Potiyil/Potikai
   in Malaya mountains which is celebrated
   in Tamil and Sanskrit literatures for
   2000 years".
  He has shown that the JAOS 1997 article,
  "Who inspired Panini?"'s placemenet of
   Potalaka in Northwest India does not
   have evidence.

  SM
PS: I believe Dr. N. Ganesan has a PhD and
chaired some conference proceedungs, authored
archival jl. articles.
Waiting for your George Washington is Siva theory.
