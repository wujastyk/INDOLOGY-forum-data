SV: SV: Sanskrit translations in Nazi hands
<<<
The SIVC extended from Gujarat to Afghanistan and Jammu to Baluchistan
is it not possible that for such a large area there were many kinds
of people and languages ?
 The problem is there are vast differences between the Worlds
 of IVC and Vedic texts.
