I checked the Colgne Digial Sansrit Lexicon  at
http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/mwd_search.html

for the entry "rudra" and got the following:

 Meaning
 mfn. (prob.) crying , howling , roaring , dreadful , terrific , terrible ,
horrible (applied to the As3vins , Agni , Indra ,
Mitra , Varun2a , and the %{spa4zaH}) RV. AV. (accord. to others `" red ,
shining , glittering "' , fr. a %{rud} or %{rudh} connected with %{rudhira}
; others `" strong , having or bestowing strength or power "' , fr. a %{rud}
= %{vRd} , %{vRdh} ; native authorities give also the following meanings ,
`" driving away evil "' ; `" running about and roaring "' , fr. %{ru} +
%{dra} = 2. %{dru} ;
.....[elided...]

in the later mythology the word %{ziva} , which  does not occur as a %{name}
in the Veda , was employed , first as an euphemistic epithet and then as a
real name for  Rudra , who lost his special connection with storms and
developed into a form of the disintegrating and reintegrating  principle ;
while a new class of beings , described as eleven [or thirty-three] in
number , though still called Rudras , took
the place of the original Rudras or Maruts:..."


Does it say that the word "ziva" does not occur in the vedas at all?
if so is that correct?
