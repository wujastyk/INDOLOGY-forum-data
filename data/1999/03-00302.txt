PDr consonantal change
 Bh. Krishnamurthy in his Telugu verbabases, p. 24,
"Caldwell's assumption that there were no initial voiced plosives in
PDr.as reflected in Ta. and Ma. was contradicted by Jules Bloch on the
 basis of the history of a few words like ghOTaka horse and drAviDa
name of a people, which, according to him, were originally native to
Dravidian. This view rceived support from some quarters and
contradiction from others. Burrow argued for Caldwell and analytically
put forth evidence to show that voicing of initial stops appearing in
some of the Dravidian languages, was only secondary and did
not represent PDr."
  Where does T. Burrow write that voicing in some Dravidian
  languages does not represent PDr.? Thanks for the citation.
