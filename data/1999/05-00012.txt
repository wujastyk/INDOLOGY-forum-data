Trilingual inscription from Sri Lanka

The problem with this is that it reifies the difference between Hinduism
and Buddhism on lines more appropriate to European religion.
Actually 'Hindu' temples are all over. I suspect that there is (or was) no
particular problem with either this or Buddhist monasteries. There is a lot
of objection to the use of American fundamentalist money to build churches
and schools etc. and 'purchase conversion'.
Again, the problem was that Sinhalese wanted to see their own language
brought back to use in their own land. This was a very natural and
legitimate objective, but it brought very serious problems for the Tamils.
I think the first thing that is needed in such a case is to recognize that
the problems are real and difficult. If you sweep aside the difficulties,
you will end up looking for scapegoats.
Again, I think this reification of the difference is a gross
oversimplification. I suspect that most Tamil rulers in ancient Ceylon
(i.e. before about 1,000 A.D.) and many since would have supported both
Buddhist and Shaiva, etc.  activities. Most Sinhalese kings certainly
offered worship to the gods.
Anyone who has spent time on the ground in the island will know that there
are all sorts of religious activities in which both Sinhalese and Tamils
participate together.
