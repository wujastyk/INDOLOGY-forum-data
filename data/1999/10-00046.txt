Contact in Tanjore
I am trying to obtain copies of Sanskrit manuscripts from the Tanjore
Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library in Tanjore.
I should therefore appreciate assistance in obtaining an address (incl.
Email & FAX) and appropriate contact person at the library.
Guidance in this matter is very much welcomed.
Many thanks,
