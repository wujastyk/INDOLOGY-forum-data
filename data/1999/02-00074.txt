Realism  of  RAmAnuja
Dear Mr. Hebbar,
Thank you for your replies to my queries.
I know that this is what traditional Srivaishnava teachers claim, and they
may very well be right. But I would like to see some explicit statement of
Ramanuja to that effect. Personally, I have some difficulty in harmonizing
the notion of objects as external and independent of consciousness with the
concept of aprithaksiddhi. There is no doubt that Ramanuja defends the
reality of distinctions (God/soul/world, etc), but that is equally feasible
within the framework of an idealist ontology.
Regards,
Martin Gansten
