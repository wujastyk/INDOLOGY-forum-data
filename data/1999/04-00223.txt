Dear Indology Members:

I am pleased to announce that my book Parvati, Goddess of Love (Mapin, 1999) has been released. It is a visual though  not a coffe table book.

This is a sequel to my Parvatidarpana (Motilal Banarasidass, 1997) which was an exposition of Kashmir Shaivism throuogh the marriage of Shiva and Parvati.

I would welcome any comments.

Harsha V. Dehejia.
