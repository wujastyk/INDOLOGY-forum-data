Book Review: An Update on AIT (Part 1)
  For scholars knowing no Tamil, Sumathi's work will
appear great. Having been brought up in Delhi and going to
English-mediam school, her knowledge of Tamil tradition, ethos
ans passions is rather poor.
  Did Caldwell teach Tamils about the uniqueness of Tamil
and their place in Indian history? Is he the guy who taught
Tamils the Tamil's relationship to (say) Telugu or Malayalam?
She ought to know better: It begins with TolkAppiyar.
