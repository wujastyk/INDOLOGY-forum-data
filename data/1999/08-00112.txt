>?From the photographs that I have seen, the Brahui speakers have very 'Aryan'
features and are indistinguishible from their neighbours. Then, how does one
account for the fact that the Dravidians in that region were absorbed by
invading/migrating Aryans but managed to retain the Dravidian basis of their
language?
