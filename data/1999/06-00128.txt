Oh so Human
Well, Mr Lighthouser, you showed us in your first post that you were RIGHT
about Harry Falk's personality.
Now you've shown us that you are RIGHT about my personality.
When are you going to show us that you are RIGHT about something Indological?
That might prove to be a little harder for you, but far more useful for the
rest of us.
Don't you think that it would be better to keep this sort of thing off the
list?
