Tamil Heritage
Skt. 'phalam', used extensively, has origins in Tamil/Dravidian.
phalam < ta. 'pazam' (fruit, ripe fruit, very aged person) is formed
from the tamil verb, 'pazu'.

Persons with deep understanding of both Tamil and Dravidian are
indeed rare. Sanskritists work from dictionaries like DED, but
when their knowledge of Tamil texts is solid, lot more sanskrit words
can be shown to be tamil/dravidian etymologically.
