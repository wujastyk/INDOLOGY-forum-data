Dear Nanda,

Quality is, of course, a rather vague term; some would distinguish it from
attributes etc.; in a formal sense, however, there can be no doubt that even
the vedAnta Atman has some qualities, e.g. nitya, mukta. In the early and
classical sAMkhya I think that puruSa, clear consciousness, can have
qualities: the qualities that qualify consciousness. So probably they won't
be spatial (though some would say that it is all-pervading, vyApin), and
even in late sAMkhya puruSas are many, separate, private, conscious and
unproductive. Though it is quite controversial, it seems that puruSas even
think thoughts with propositional content: in SK 64 it must be the puruSa
who thinks: "the tattvas are not me; they are not mine; I am not the
tattvas" (evaMtattvAbhyAsAn "nAsmi na me nAham" ity).

1. Work - bodily work - is done by matter and affects matter; soul cannot do
it for many reasons, e.g. because it is non-spatial. 2. Pure means probably
'undefiled', and it is a rather general assumption in some corners that the
spiritual sphere is superior, and defilements are bodily in origin ("carnal"
desires etc.). 3. If the soul is indeed superior it cannot be bound by what
is inferior; and as it is conscience, some negative _mental_ property must
be the cause of bondage.
