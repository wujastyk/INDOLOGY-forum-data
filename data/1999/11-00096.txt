When did the gods become literate?
Rather, it seems that what the Buddha condemned was to speculate
about what *does not exist*, such as a self, and neither Hiinayaanists
nor Mahaayaanists seem to have incurred such fault.
Your very interpretation of what the Buddha condemned seems to
assume the existence of some self-existent Reality, precisely what
the Buddha condemned.
What is called Theravaada falls into what is called Hiinayaana by
those who call themselves Mahaayaanists, both in terms of tenets
and purpose.
