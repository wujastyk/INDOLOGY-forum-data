Subject: The Aryans (again); 19th century discourse.
Message-ID: <161227044582.23782.1252718183933632743.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In fact, *all* scholars are telling that Sanskrit entered
India and definitely NOT the other way around.
It spread by language change accomplished by
elite dominance approach.

Upanishads age is reduced by about 100 years.
Modern scholarship shows Rig Veda is about 1000 BC,
rather than 1400 BC.

For all the above, pl. see archives.

With kind regards,

I wonder if Dr. Fosse, or anyone else well-acquainted with this subject,
would summarize for new list entrants, like myself, as to how this topic
achieved closure. In selectively reading the archives it appears to me
that
more facts are needed for closure since both competing theories have
deficiencies.

Barring any new findings, this topic could be treated as a dormant
subject
but definitely not a closed one. Any thoughts? BTW, I am not a scholar
but
would like to be one.
