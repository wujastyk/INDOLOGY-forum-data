Genetics and Mr. Abbas
Hello Mr. Abbas.
I am glad to see your ISLAMIC name in this forum. After all, not many
MUSLIMS are interested in Indology and you have made a bold foray into this
Jahil area of studies.
I understand your frustration at the fanatical attitude of these opponents
of AIT. How can they understand the suffering that the SC/ST's, OBC's,
Jains, Buddhists and Muslims have collectively undergone because of Hindu
and Brahmin cunning!! I am all with you!!
