According to Monier Wiiliams, dakSiNAcala is the malaya mountain
which is another name for potiyil.
>>>

  malayagiri- It is mentioned in BRhat-saMhitaa (XIV, II).
  The hermitage of Agastya was situated on the MalayakUTa
  which was also known as zrIkhaNDadri or even as CandaAdri
  (cf. Dhoyi's pavanadUtam). .. Acording to some, the mount
  Candaka mentioned in the jAtaka (V, 162) is the Malayagiri.

  malayAcala- The epic tradition locates it in South India.
  JimUtavAhana took shelter on this mountain after renouncing
  his sovereignty (bodhisattvaavadAna kalpalatA). The padmapurANa
  (Ch. 133) mentions kalyANatIrtha in MalayAcala.

  DakSiNAdri mentioned in the KAvyAdarza (III, 150) by DaNDin is the
  same as the Malayaacala according to the commentator.
