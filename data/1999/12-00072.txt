I want to raise another issue in a different cultural-language context. Is it
true that the Avestan word for 'god' is baga? If so, is this related to
Old Slavic bogu 'god' or to para-Munda word: bon:ga?
In Santali, bon:ga means: the sp;irits whom the Santals worship as a demon; to
sacrifice to a bon:ga; bon:ga also means a lunar month; bon:ga saranjam = the
materials of sacrifice and offerings.
How far west can the para-Munda be traced philologically?
