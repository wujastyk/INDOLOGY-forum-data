Dear Sudalaimuthu Palaniappan
Thank you for the email with interesting answers.
I see, but in any case it is not doubted that the origin of AMMK is 
not in South India (T.N., K.), is it?
K.P. Jayaswal reasoning is based on one parivarta of AMMK called 
rAjavyAkarana-parivarta, a part of 1005 verses. KPJ says that 
author of AMMK pays the greatest attention to gauDa and 
magadha.
The AMMK survey from nAga and gupta up to pAla times  is 
basically survey from gauDa and its surroundings written from the 
point of view of gauDa, showing intimate concern with gauDa and 
surrounding provincies. KPj says that for the authorof AMMK 
gauDa meant the whole of Bengal and it includes magadha.
But i suppose that it is possible that it can be due to simple reason
- that the history in AMMK is spoken
as prophecy from the mouth of Buddha and it may not be related 
author's location.
It is very interesting note but I have to admit that I have very little 
resources about the South India here - much less than I would like 
to have - to enable me to find out basically anything about 
tAmraparNi. You have some answer?
There is very interesting site discussing Gilgit manuscripts at:
http://ishi.lib.berkeley.edu/buddhist/bbrc/index.html
They have a large biblio about publications related to Gilgit sutras
http://ishi.lib.berkeley.edu/buddhist/bbrc/biblio_gilgit_mss.html
and they list the sutras on:
http://ishi.lib.berkeley.edu/buddhist/bbrc/list_gilgit_mss.html
professor Yao-ming Tsai who is responsible for this part of the site 
may know the answers.
Sincerely
Petr Mares
