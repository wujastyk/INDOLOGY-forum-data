Q: intervocalic -k- preserved as intervocalic -g-
Obviously genetics does not alow for such rapid, spontaneous changes in skin
colour in a few generations.
But Indians tan very quickly, and also lose their tans quickly in northern
latitudes. I remeber being teased about having a lily white complexion after
staying abroad for just a few months. Lots of men in India tend to get
progressively darker as they age because of prolonged exposure, their
counterparts in the US would be fairer in comparision.
