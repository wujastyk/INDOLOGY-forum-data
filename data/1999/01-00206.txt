SV: SV: Sanskrit translations in Nazi hands
Hi Friends,
There are tons of references in Old Tamil Sangam texts and
those succeeding them where Tamil's distinction from Sanskrit
is emphasized.
To add to Dr. Palaniappan's Appar quote, lete me cite
another from Appar (Saint TirunAvukkaracar, 6-7th century)
 "Ariyan2 kaNTAy; tamizan2 kaNTaay!" - appar tEvAram
Translation: Lord "Siva is Aryan as well as Tamilian.
More later,
N. Ganesan
