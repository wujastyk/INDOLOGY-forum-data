SV: creation of human kind
Mani Varadarajan writes:
Let us see how Parthasarathy temple's Alvar poems
"speak repeatedly of Krishna as the chaioteer".
I do not see what Mani sees!
nine out of ten verses deal with
1. killing kamsa, removing ziva's sufferings, standing in the front
 of arjuna's chariot (pArttan2Ran2 tErmun2 nin2RAn2ait
tiruvallikkENik kaN kaNTEn2E),
    giving up the kingdom (as Rama)
2.being vedas, essence of vedas, fruit eaten by sages, primordial one,
ambrosia
3. killing the demoness and becaming mohini
4. holding up the mountain  to protect the cowherdss and the herd from
rain
5. serving as emissary for pANDvas
6. saving pAncAli, standing in the front of arjuna's chariot
 (intira ciRuvan2 tEr mun2 nin2RAn2ait tiruvallikkENik kaN kaNTEn2E)
7. killing rAvaNa
8. becoming narasimha
9. saving the elephant
The tenth one deals with the benefits of reciting the verses.
6. sa
pArttan2ukkku an2Ru aruLip pAratattu oRu tErmun2 nin2Ru
kAttavan2 tan2n2ai viNNOr karu mANikka mAmalaiyai
tIrttan2aip pUmpozil cUz tirumAliruJcOlai nin2Ra

Here again, Krishna as charioteer is all that is implied.
cEyan2 aNiyan2 ciRiyan2 mikap periyan2
Ayan2 tuvaraikkOn2Ay nin2Ra mAyan2 an2Ru
Otiya vAkkatan2aik kallAr ulakattil
EtilaraY meyJJAn2am il
This is one place one can assume gIta is implied.
All other Krishna/Rama myths abound in Naalaayiram
except this one place where Gita is implied.
Percentage wise it is a very tiny fraction among
all Krishna legends told in Divya Prabandham.
