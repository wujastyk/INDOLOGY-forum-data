Historicity of The Flood
There are 100s of references in Tevaram hymns (7th century CE) about flood
legends - Especially, cIkAzi as the only place floating like a boat (tONi)
when all three worlds were submerged by the sea. Shiva plays the veena
and saves all living beings.
Hope Dr. Jean-Luc will write here on Tevaram flood legends.
