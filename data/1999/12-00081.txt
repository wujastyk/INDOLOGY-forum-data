2) dr. tamizh > dAmili/dramiDi/dramiDaka, ... and also, k -> s/z
is attested in Sanskrit and Tamil many a time (eg., karkoTa/zarkoTa,
ta. kaTTam(square)/caTTam(rectangular window frame, law < (verb)
kaTTu).
Hence, is drav. kATi > skt. zATI/zATa(ka)/sADI/chATI possible?
If so, the kATi(dr.)/zATI(skt) is probably what is seen on the
shoulders of the so called 'priest' of IVC and latter on the Buddha.
