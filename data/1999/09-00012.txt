interest of his own
This strikes a new chord! Could Mr. Agrawal please be more precise. Is Dr.
Thompson's life or health threatened if he uses "pejorative terms" in relation
to the creators of the "Anti-AIT" theory?
Furthermore, is this a non-specific, general warning, or is Mr. Agrawal here
acting on behalf of specific persons who want to suppress the debate by
frightening Westerners who oppose their pseudo-scientific theories?
Given the turn this debate has taken, I will insist that all further exchanges
between myself and Mr. Agrawal will take place in public, and I will publish
any private mails that contain direct or indirect threats.
Best regards,
