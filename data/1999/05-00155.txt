I seem to have pressed the SEND button before I
actually finished.

Just wanted to add that the terms "Tenkalai" and
"Vadakalai" are of rather recent origin. (16th century
according to experts such as KKA Venkatachari ("
Manipravala Literature of the Sri Vaishnavas').
Whereas the AzvAr himself would need to be dated to
the Ist Millennium AD 8th-10th centuries.

Does anybody know if Patricia Mumme discusses the
etymology of these terms?

Thanks and Warm Regards.
