"Hindu writer who lives in New York"
I wonder if "a Hindu writer who lives in New York" has the same ring to it
as Mr. So and So, professor of Theology, or Dr. So and So of Pathology etc.
What qualification is " a Hindu writer" ? Is it the same as Russell Baker,
the White columnist, or Mr. A.M. Rosenthal, the Jewish writer ? Are we to
assume that the article is impartial just because it has been written by a
"Hindu writer" ? Probably just the same as Mr. Rosenthal writing on Saddam
Hussein. Or is it ?
Am I being picky here ?
