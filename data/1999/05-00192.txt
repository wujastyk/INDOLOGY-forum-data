Rigveda: dravidian word kun.d.apa_yya
Hi,
 I am a new member of the list. I just wanted to add that in hindi and
bengali and probably other indian languages also kund signifies a deep lake
or tank. there are place names like beas kund etc...
there is a common bengali last name "kundu" does it indicate a proffession
say a potter ?
