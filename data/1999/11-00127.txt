Having come from Orissa and read a wholesome
literature on tantrism and buddhism in Orissa,
this new interpretation baffles me.
It seems the new etymologists
tend to be very "creative" in their thoughts
and interpretation.  Over all, many
of the evidences seem circular and
not to the point.  People need to dig
more and find more circumstantial
evidence before drawing a conclusion.
Others may comment.
