Thank wonders that I am one of the "Some members" who sing the glory of "one
language and one culture(?), i.e. Tamil." I am not in a position to claim or
disclaim any unique place for Tamil but I dare anyone to stop me from praising
my mother tongue! I do not know Mr. BHK, except through this 'listserv' and
his hatred for Tamil. If he is a younger person, he is excused for his
misinterpreted youthful zeal   If he is an elderly person, one wonders about
his motive or claim to be a know all. However, as a student of Tamil, I look
up to  knowledgable people in Tamil to widen my horizon and I am glad that I
am greatly benefited by the Indology group. It is fair game to praise oneself
and it is welcome but putting down competition - if it is only  competition,
as in product sales - then that speaks volume of the capacity of the salesman
of the competition to stand up to meet the challenges of the praised product.
It reminds me of seats won in national elections with only negative and
malicious campaign. I wonder anything can be done about it? Ignoring these
venomous attacks encourages more spurting of more venom, I have learnt. Let us
learn to "Live and let live with self-pride and tolerance." Ramalingam
