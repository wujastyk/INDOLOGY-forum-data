This does not make sense. If what you say is true, more than
 200 years of Indological scholarship has been a waste of time.
In other words, according to you, when the Sanskrit texts are
translated into English, articles 'a', 'an', and 'the' do not
 carry any semantic specificity! They have been thrown about
here and there for no reason!

Every language has its own set of "tools" to convey the correct
 meaning. So it is immaterial if Sanskrit does not have a, an, the,
etc. as English does.  What Aklujkar has written is clear enough.
 If you question Aklujkar's understanding of the Sanskrit texts,
please give your interpretation of the relevant texts he has
referred to, and explain why your interpretation is better than his.
