SV: Mount Potalaka in Malaya mountains
I get this kind of gibberish too sometimes, and not only from Indology. I think
it has to do with the mail program used (the codes look like RTF codes, but may
be something else). Ask the person sending the mails to check his/her mail
program. Given the bewildering amount of options in modern high performance
programs, this may not be so easy a task. I have some bitter experiences
myself.
