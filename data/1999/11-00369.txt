"Top Five" Philosophy Works
I think I agree that Radhakrishnan was not much of a "creative" or
groundbreaking philosopher.  However, he did produce much valuable
scholarship.  Very few politicians produce works like INDIAN PHILOSOPHY, THE
PRINCIPAL UPANISHADS, AN IDEALIST VIEW OF LIFE, etc., etc.  In addition to
his work as a politician, he also did much good as an historian of
philosophy and as a commentator on and interpreter of philosophical
traditions.
