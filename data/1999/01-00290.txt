I think that Alexis Manaster-Ramer wrote something on this recently,
referring to (I believe) the following source:

Callaghan, Catherine A. & Wick R. Miller (1962)``Swadesh's Macro
Mixtecan hypothesis and English,'' Southwestern Journal of Anthropology
18.278-285.

Btw, Callaghan and Miller attack Swadesh by using his method to show
that English is Macro-Mixtecan.
