As far as some of your queries are concerned:
* Is not the Parama Samhitaa a part of the Pancaraatra? Also, I have read
that the Parama Samhitaa is/was published in the Gaekwad Oriental Series.
* According to Dr B.N.K. Sharma. ''C.R. Krishna Rao has done a useful
service in piecing together all the quotations from the Brahmatarka (a
non-extant source) running to nearly 700 verses occurring in the various
works of Madhva and arranging them under a few leading topics, and arguing a
case for accepting the genuineness of the work.'' So, it would seem that if
the Brahmatarka was not genuine, then why would Madhva go to the trouble of
writing a work of at least 700 verses? Also, Trivikrama cited a pasage from
the Brahmatarka in his Tattvapradiipa which is not quoted by Madhva in any
of his works. Also, from reading History of Dvaita School of Vedanta, I read
where Advaitaananda has quoted a verse from Brahmatarka in attempting to
refute Madhva.
* It is also hard to imagine Madhva going to all the trouble to write some
700+ verses to a work when he quotes from some 290 other works, as well as
including Rg Veda, Upanishads, Mbh, smR^itis and so on, to back up his
philosophy.
