Hi,

Please see the colorful slides at source related to recent discoveries on
cemetery H culture which was an extensive cultural phenomenon ca. 1900 BC:
http://www.harappa.com/indus2/index.html (Latest discoveries in Harappa,
1995-98, by J.M. Kenoyer and Richard H. Meadow) Slides 162 and 164 showing the
blackbuck antelope, peacock and dotted circles (trefoil motif).

It has been noted in an earlier posting that the peacock connotes ji_vanji_va
(Pali), may the life live hereafter. In addition to the peacock, dotted
circles, fish and elk (antelope or large stag) are also depicted on funerary
pottery of the Harappan civilization. To identify the language of the
civilization, the following lexemes are presented. The lexeme, iz'mare_ik
(Kho.) meaning 'I count' may be related to the pictorial of a 'dotted circle'
which appears often, for e.g. on the trefoil inscribed on the shawl of the
priest statuette. cf. ca_ran.ar = Jain or Buddhist sages (Ta.lex.)

The word is sambha_ra meaning: a token of remembrance, a deer, a fish.
sambha_ran.um = a token of remembrance; a memento; a keepsake; a memorial; a
gift for fame; sambha_ran.um rahevum = to be a token of remebrance;
sambha_ran.um rahe evum karavum = to do a work whereby one's memory will be
perpetuated; sambha_ravum (Dh. Des. sam.thariyam from Skt. smr.tam remembered;
cf. smaran.a) = to remember (Gujarati lexicon) smaran.a = remembering (R.);
memory (BhP.); saran.a = memory (Pali);  samaran.a, sumaran.a, saran.a
(Pkt.)xo~waran = remembrance, recollection, xo~warni = memorandum, horoscope
(A.)(CDIAL 13862).

The language of the civilization is close to the languages spoken even today
in the Sindhu Sarasvati River Basins.

Regards,
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
