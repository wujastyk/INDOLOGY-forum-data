Subject: Ingalls Jr and smalltalk
Message-ID: <161227045462.23782.15081433323326536590.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The justification for posting this to INDOLOGY is very thin: Dan Ingalls
Jr worked with Sr years ago on a project to write a program in the
Smalltalk language which would read Devanagari.  The easiest place to find
a reprint of the article about this is in the Brill volume of Mahabharata
studies edited by Arvind Sharma, ca. 1992.

Anyhow, I happened to notice in the current issue of Dr Dobbs Journal
(#295, Jan 1999, p.102) that Dan Ingalls Jr is mentioned as still active
in developing Smalltalk at the Walt Disney Imagineering company, of all
places.  There is a new free version called Squeak, and I wonder whether
it would be possible to get Ingalls' Devnagari OCR program running under
this?  Does anyone have the original source-code for the Devanagari
reader?

All the best,
Dominik
