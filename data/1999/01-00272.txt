Tibetan Origin of Tantrism and Siva
I would only add to Samar's post that the complex geometric patterns
used in Tantrism are believed by some to have originated from the
weaving patterns of Central Asian peoples.  There introduction into
Islam is often credited to Turko-Mongol peoples who migrated into Iran
or other parts of the Middle East. Indeed there appearance in these
regions often coincides with Turko-Mongol invasions. Even the most
isolated Central Asian tribes appear to use these weaving patterns,
although they are most popularly seen in the West on Afghan or Persian
rugs.
