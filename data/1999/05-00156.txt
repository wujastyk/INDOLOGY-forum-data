Tanagalai and Vadagalai
Sri. Lakshmi Srinivas wrote:
I think so, we have 'aaNkalai' and 'peNkalai', -
two 'divisons' in qualities.
Was originally vaTakalai referring to the Kanchipuram school
which is little North and  where Sanskrit was more weighed
compared to tenkalai referring to the Srirangam school
which gave more importance to Alvars?
With kind regards,
