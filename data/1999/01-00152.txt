 Whatever has happened of Swami Aghehananda Bharathi,an Austrian by
birth
and who put down his life story in a book <OCHRE ROBE> and who later
Syracuse Univ.?The last i heared /read about him was in an article
Illustrated Weekly some years back.

Perhaps List subscribers would have more information on him.

 According to the ex. Raja of Kollengode, Palghat district
 who is our family friend, Aghehananda Bharati was from Britain
 and served in the Indian army before Independence. He later
 worked in USA. Bharati died a decade ago & the Raja died
 2 years ago.

 Kollengode Samasthanam hosted Kanchi Mahaperiyaval
 in late 1930s. The family album has rare photos of him,
 A. Bharati, ... The soma subtitute (called cOmbu in
 Tamil) is special for Kollengode region. Tamil brahmins
 settled in Kerala for centuries supply them at big
 vedic sacrifices to Nambudiris doing the sacrifice.
