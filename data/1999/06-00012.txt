Before we Indians wear the hats of the Hindu(tva) version
of bible preachers on Sunday TV and start our ridicules
and rhetorics when we hear theories like IVC is most likely
Dravidian with Sanskrit playing an insignificant role or that RV
is likely to date from (say) 1200 BCE, readings like
a) O. Chadwick, The secularization of the European mind
in the 19th century and b) Voltaire's Bastards, etc.,
will be a help.

I think renaissance, reformation, enlightenment of
Hinduism has a long way to go.
