Last I read, the idea that Munda did not originally have retroflexes
is based on the fact that retroflexes are not universal in Munda, with
one language given as an exception. This theory does not take
linguistic drift into adequate account.

Also, the use of initial retroflexes in Munda and "Aryan" languages
as opposed to the non-initial retroflex system in the south.
