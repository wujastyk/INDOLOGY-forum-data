The elephant naLagiri/nalagiri
What comes to my mind is a connection by contrast only, cf. UdAnavarga (ed.
Bernhard) 4.37:
   dhunidhvaM mRtyunaH sainyaM naDAgAram iva kuJjaraH
"Crush the army of Death like an elephant (crushes) a house made of reed."
As for Nala and reed: reed may have a sexual connotation (like daNDa).
