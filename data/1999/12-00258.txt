Demonstrative  pronoun   sasmAd
Dear list members,
Macdonell in his vedic grammar for students section 110, Whitney 495 b note
that the demonstrative pronoun sasmAd occurs once and only once in the
sanskrit literature and that the occurance is in the Chandogya Upanishad.
Brugmann in his comparative grammar section 409 mentions the occurance of
sasmin instead of tasmin in the vedic but doesn't mention sasmAd as far as I
can see.
Can someone give me the verse in the Chandogya Upanishad where this occurs.
(A search on string "sasm" in the itrans version on the sanskrit documents
page didn't turn up anything)
Also does anyone have an explanation/theory why this lone occurance of
"sasmAd" in the sanskrit literature and that occuring in the stage of the
literature that it does.
Many thanks,
