Dear Ferenc,

With my level of proficiency in French, I doubt if I'll make much
headway with that :-) Anyway thanks for the reference.

Why should that be a source of confusion? Wasn't KAlidhAsa one of the
nine jewels in the court of VikramAditya (Chandragupta II ?)?

If the identification is indeed wrong, isn't it strange that such a
famous exponent of a leading school of philosophy, has no other
references in Indian literature?

But KAlidhAsa's frequent use of the concept of Shiva (Being) and
Shakti (Creative power) in his works, seem to mark him more as a
VedAntin than a SAmkhyan.

Could others with knowledge of KAlidhAsa's world view, throw more
light on this?

Rgds,
Nanda
