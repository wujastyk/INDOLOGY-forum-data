>Sanskrit stone inscription found in central China

Is this in the grantha script? If so, via the sea contacts.
In 1956, a Tamil inscription on South China has been
found, A Shiva temple talking of "kaDaliiccuram uTaiya
nAyanAr". I think Gustav Ecke (UCLA) wrote a book on
a Chola style temple in South China long time ago.

Or, may be via Kashmir, Central Asia.
