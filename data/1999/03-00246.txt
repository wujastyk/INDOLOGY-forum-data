All-India Kashiraj Trust Puranas
The All-India Kashiraj Trust published three translations of the Puranas
with Sanskrit and verse-by-verse English translation. I was wondering if
anyone could tell me if these editions are still in print by Kashiraj. If
so, what bookstores in South India might they be available?
