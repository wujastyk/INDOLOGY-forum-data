Wrong again, there've been quite a few orgiastic groups among the gnostics
in Egypt (a certain Basilides was famous) and in the European middle ages,
you can also find similarites in the lives of Greek Stoics.

That seems a strong bias to me, the more considering the fact that there are
quite a few Japanese and Chinese sinologists and Tibetologists (even an
occasional Tibetan has escaped the claws of the church and made a carreer
in science). And you seem to forget that texts seldomly lie. If you read
Chinese and Tibetan texts there's little room for bias left. How open are
you for ideas that contradict you're worldview?
