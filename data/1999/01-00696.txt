gIta upadEza (RE: SV: creation of human kind)
I checked the 10 poems composed by "tirumaGkai AZvAr"
on the lord at "pArtan2 pALLi" and those 10 poems simply
mention the name of the temple "pAtan2 paLLi" but
do not mention even any episodes associated with
pArtan2 (arjun2A) let alone chariot driving or gIta upadEza.
The poems are listed at
http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/pub/pm0006/praba21inm.html
the poems iq uestion are: #1318 -1327.
I could view them in a Tamil font (Inaimathi/Anjal)
 which I am viewing (by letting the Murasu Anjal application
be running in the background).
