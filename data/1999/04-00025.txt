Lankavatara sutra
Sir
I did not ask whether Nan2 Tian1Zhu2 refers to South India (it clearly does), I asked whether ZhiSheng's text (whom Mr. Iyanaga translated) used  Nan2 Tian1Zhu2 for what Mr. Iyanaga translated as South India - since there are many other words that can refer to South India (not just Nan2 Tian1Zhu2).
