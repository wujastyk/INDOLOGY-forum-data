gandhamAdana ?
Dear Fellow-listmembers,
I am puzzled over a reference I've encountered in the Ramayana'a YuddhakA.n.da
(6.37.2, in the critical ed.) to "gandhamAdana." The only 'literary character'
given in Apte's dictionary for this compound is RAva.na, yet this would not seem
to fit the context, given that the list in this (and the following) verse
evidently refers to the vAnaras who surround RAma to protect his fallen body.
Can anyone shed some light on this reference? Am I overlooking something
obvious?
