the word "potiyil" inside MaNimEkalai (Was Re: Chih Sheng              (688-740 AD))
Dear Dr. J.-L. Chevillard,
Can you give us the places where Potiyam and Potiyil figures
in Sangam texts (eTTut tokai and pattup paaTTu)? Please.
How many places Potiyil refers to Mt. Potiyil
and at how many places it refers to a "Public Hall".
Thanks a bouquet!
