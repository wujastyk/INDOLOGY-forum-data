A Request: Information on Devadasi & Keisha
Dear Indology members,
Could anyone provide me some information (reference as hard copy books, or
web sources) \
on the previously done comparative studies on 'Devadasi system of India &
Keisha System of Japan.'
Even, the references that could provide information on any one of the
systems is helpful.
Thank you very much.
Regards,
Ramanitharan, K.
