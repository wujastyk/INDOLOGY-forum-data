Subject: A Request: Information on Devadasi & Keisha
Message-ID: <161227052431.23782.682744292065220521.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indology members,

Could anyone provide me some information (reference as hard copy books, or
web sources) \
on the previously done comparative studies on 'Devadasi system of India &
Keisha System of Japan.'

Even, the references that could provide information on any one of the
systems is helpful.

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Ramanitharan, K.
