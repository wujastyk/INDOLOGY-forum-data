Consciousness in visishtadvaita
John,
Thanks for your input. I think it may prove difficult for me to get hold of
that article from here, but I'll try. In the meantime, would you know if
Prof. Balasubramanian based his critique on any particular passages of
Ramanuja's own writings, where this division of consciousness (into
substantive and attributive) is explicitly stated?
Best regards,
Martin Gansten
