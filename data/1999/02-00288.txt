teleological argument
Esteemed Indologists
Several nineteenth-century Hindu reformers invoke a form of the
teleological argument; to wit, that knowledge of God can be derived from
observation of the order and design of the universe.
Where are there precedents for this in the Indian tradition? Is this a
borrowing from European Deism?
Thanks in advance for any pointers.
