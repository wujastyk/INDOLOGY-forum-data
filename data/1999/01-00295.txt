Nehru and Persian/Arabic
Dear Members of the Net,
On behalf of a colleague who does not have access to the Internet, I would like
to forward the following question to the list members:
Where does Nehru say that Persian and Arabic are part of the Indian cultural
heritage?
(My colleague has information that Nehru says something to this effect in his
writings, but has no reference).
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
