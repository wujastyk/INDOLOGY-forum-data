Buddhism - conceptual doubts
Since I am not a scholar, I am fully qualified not to deserve your
gratitude. All my answers pretend to reflect the viewpoint of Tibetan
Gelug scholarship and all quotations are from _Cutting Through
Appearances_, Geshe Lhundup Sopa & Jeffrey Hopkins, Snow Lion
Publications. The bracketed interpolated words are mine. My purpose
in answering is to clarify the subject for myself. If my message is not
welcome please delete it. If I insist, please remove me from the list.
Specifically, what Maadhyamaka denies are the extremes of existence
beyond mere conceptual imputation (or of inherent existence) and of
utter non-existence.
Thus, the middle path propounded by the Kaas'yapaparivartha is
the merely imputed, nominal existence, of persons and other
phenomena.
The negated self here is just a permanent, independent, and indivisible
person (according to the Sa.mmitya subschools) and also a substantially
existent person, which is a person that is each of the aggregates of body
and mind, but a person which is the mere collection of the aggregates of
body and mind is accepted.
"An ultimate truth [paramaarthasatya] is a phenomenon which is
such that when it is broken up or separated into individual parts,
the consciousness apprehending that object is not cancelled", the
examples given being "directionally partless particles, temporally
partless moments of consciousness, and uncompounded space
[p.186]."
According to the above quotation not only atoms are held to be
ultimate truths, but also partless moments of consciousness (as
well as uncompounded space).
Also, "[a]ll Foe Destroyers [arhan], of the three vehicles [s'raavaka,
pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva, and thus all Buddhas] have a nirvana
with remainder [sopadhis'e.sanirvaa.na] because they assert that when
one attains a nirvana without remainder [nitupadhis'e.sanirvaa.na] there
is a severing of the continuum of consciousness, like the extinction of a
flame [p.217]."
Thus, there is no problem with a Buddha on attaining nirvaa.na with
remainder being aware that he has attained such nirvaa.na, because
the continuum of consciousness is not severed at this time, but there
is no room for such an awareness upon the attainment of nirvaa.na
without remainder, because the continuum of consciousness is then
severed.
Having attained a nirvaa.na with remainder but still not a nirvaa.na
without remainder, a Buddha has abandoned, as opposed to
non-Buddha arhans, non-afflictive ignorance preventing the
attainment of an all-knowingness, and thus his state of consciouness
is one qualified by such all-knowingness, which means that if a
Buddha thinks about objects, seen or unseen, he will know them
one by one, but not simultaneously (paraphrased from pp.205/206).
Upon attaining a nirvaa.na without remainder there is no state of
consciousness at all, because the continuum of consciousness is
then severed.
That would not be the case, as explained above.
I hope to have reported faithfully how Tibetan Gelug scholars
understand such view.
The self negated by the Sautraantikas is the same negated by the
Vaibhas.ikas, but a person which is either the continuum of the
aggregates or the mental consciousness is accepted (p.238).
As to atoms, they are said to be accepted to be ultimate truths by
all Sautraantikas, either because they are irreducible, or because
they perform the function of producing effects (p.237).
"[An] ultimate truth is a phenomenon that is able to bear reasoned
analysis from the point of view of whether it has its own mode of
subsistence without depending on imputation by terms or
conceptual consciousnesses [p.224]."
Thus, whatever is not a concept is an ultimate truth, examples being
an atom, a pot, a table, and a person.
A concept is said to be a conventional truth, or a truth for an
obscured awareness (sa.mv.rtisatya) (p.224).
Their assertions concerning nirvaa.na are said to be mostly similar
to those of Vaibhaa.sikas, which were above reported (p.246).
Yogacaarins are said to deny a self of persons, similar to that denied
by Vaibhaa.sikas and Sautraantikas, and also a self of other phenomena,
which is an object that is a different entity from the consciousness
apprehending it. Thus, the world is not denied, but only a world
that is not the same entity as the consciousness apprehending it
(pp.249/250).
An ultimate truth, or a thoroughly established nature, is said to be
the lack, or emptiness of difference of entity between an object and
the consciousness apprehending it (p.265).
A consciousness, which is the same entity as the object it apprehends,
is said to be a conventional truth, or a falsity (m.r.saa), because it does
not exist the way it appears to (p.264).
However, according to Yogacaarins, an ultimate truth (which is an
object's emptiness of existence as a separate entity from the
cognizing consciousness), does not exist as a different entity
from the consciousness apprehending it (pp.264/265)
According to Vaibhaa.sikas, Sautraantikas, and Yogacaarins, the
world as a whole is real, that is, it truly exists, because it exists
independently of its appearance to the valid consciouness
apprehending it (although it is not a different entity from
the apprehending consciousness, according to Yogacaarins)
(p.266).
Thus, none has to assert an essence in the world, for it truly
already exists.
Here, a nirvaa.na without remainder is said to be liberation from
cyclic existence while directly cognizing emptiness (without any
appearance of other phenomena apart from emptiness, as well
as of inherent existence) which is followed by a nirvaa.na with
remainder, when other phenomena apart from emptiness
reappear together with their appearance of inherent existence
(p.318).
This is because such nirvaa.nas of arhans have eliminated only
the conception, but not the appearance of inherent existence -
which are eliminated only by Buddhas (id.)
Thus, conception and appearance of inherent existence are
eliminated, not phenomena themselves, which are merely
imputed but existent phenomena.
Emptiness of inherent existence is said to be a "natural nirvaa.na",
(prak.rtiparinirvaa.na) which is not a passing beyond sorrow, but an
emptiness that is naturally passed beyond inherent existence
(the conception of which being the source of all sorrow).
The equation of sam.saara and nirvaa.na thus just indicates that
phenomena and their ultimate mode of being (their emptiness)
are the same entity, not separate entities, and not that sorrow
and liberation from sorrow are the same (the last two paragraphs
paraphrased from Jeffrey Hopkins' _Meditation on Emptiness_,
Wisdom Publications, pp.218/219)
For Vaibhaa.sikas ultimate truths are the same entity as the
phenomena of which the former are the parts.
For Sautraantikas, ultimate truths are the conceived or appearing
objects themselves.
For Yogacaarins, as well as Maadhyamikas, phenomena and their
ultimate truths - their emptiness- are the same entity, although
different phenomena.
Thus, no Buddhist school asserts a reality different from the
empirical world as a whole, or from the observed objects, or
from phenomena.
Yes, phenomena and their emptiness are the same entity but
nevertheless different phenomena, or objects of knowledge.
How is it possible? Because the sameness of entity is just imputed
by conception.
Ultimate truth is phenomena's lack, or emptiness of inherent existence.
A natural nirvaa.na is sa.msaara's ultimate mode of being, or its
emptiness, which is directly perceived in a concept-free manner.
An emptiness is said to exist, to be a truth - an ultimate truth.
When conception of inherent existence, which is the source of
sa.msaara, ceases, one attains nirvaa.na.
When conception of inherent existence ceases while in meditative
equipoise, one directly cognizes a natural nirvaa.na.
An aatman, or self, which means inherent existence is utterly denied;
persons and other phenomena that are merely imputed are not
denied, this being the middle way.
Thus, phenomena which are sa.msaara are empty if inherent existence,
and thus inseparable from their own emptiness, which is their natural
nirvaa.na.
Thus, denial of a self and equation of sa.msaara and nirvaa.na are
fully compatible, as is assertion of merely imputed phenomena.
A natural nirvaa.na is the ultimate mode of being of any phenomenon
such as sa.msaara, and is its emptiness of inherent existence, which
is directly apprehended in a non-conceptual manner.
Also, nirvaa.na comes about not upon mere cessation of conceptual
activity, but upon cessation of conception of self, or inherent existence.
Besides, such suutras as the Kaas'yapaparivartha explicitly state that
"that which is in the center between these two is unanalyzable,
undemonstrable", and so forth.
Probably what you think is so simple has nothing to do with what
the Tathaaghata meant, both with his speech and with his silence.
An emptiness, or a natural nirvaa.na, is not an object certified, or
directly cognized, by a conceptual consciousness, as all other
phenomena such as sa.msaara are, and thus such predication
indeed cannot take place.
What the Buddha denied is a self.
What Buddhist schools denied is a self.
And, what is denied cannot be put in relation to whatever.
The middle taken by Naagaarjuna is between inherent existence
and utter non-existence, which means merely imputed, nominal
existence.
Emptiness is indeed related to other phenomena, because it is
phenomena's mode of being. Emptiness is not an absolute, or
something unrelated to phenomena.
If you equate mysticism with non-conceptuality, then a direct
understanding of emptiness would be a mystic experience.
Sorry for any obscurations,
