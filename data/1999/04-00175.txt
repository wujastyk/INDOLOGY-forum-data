So? He could have well been KAlidhAsa as a grihasta and Ishvara
Krishna during his VAnaprasta and samnyAsin stages.

Probably he got tired of all the flowery verbal patterns and
linguistic gymnastics, as he got more serious :-)

Humour apart, it is a thing to be considered. The purpose of poetry is
different from philosophy. With the latter, the stress is not on
language, grammar or artistic expression. The subject being serious
and already complicated, the author might have restricted himself to
simpler forms of expression to make his theories clear.
