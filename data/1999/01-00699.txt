SV: creation of human kind
Thanks Palaniappan.
My copy of cilappatikAram seems to have a printing error:
it says:
"n2Er mun2 nin2Ra" but the translation says
"...cAratiyAka irun-tha" ("...serving as a charioteer")
This instance has unequivocally conveyed to me the
need for having a good quality publication!
