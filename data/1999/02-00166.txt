Mount Potalaka in Malaya mountains - a specialist address
Dear Mr. Ganesan
I have posted your request about the Xuan Zang's two chapters
dating on the Mailing list of Early Mediaval China and got a
response attched below my letter.
As I am not specialiased in that period and do not have much time to
do some deep reasearch on Xuan Zang, who's writing is of no interest
to me (I am interested in the
preceeding dynasties of 5th century such as Liu Song and Bei Wei
and translator called Gunabhadra), from my own experience I just
remember to read in various Chinese articles about the forgery of the
10 - 12th chapter of XZ geography - XiYuJi. I suppose
it would be much better and faster for you to directly contact the
specialist on this topic Dr. Alexander Meyer of Sinologisches Seminar,
Universitaet heidelberg,, whose address have been kindly sent to me  by
prof.
Helwig Schmidt-Glintzer from the Herzog August Bibliothek. Once
you get an answer, please let me know more about the forgery if
you can.
Attached response from the Early Mediaval China mailing list:
Dear colleague,
you might contact Dr. Alexander Meyer who is, as far as I know,
still attached to the Sinologisches Seminar, Universitaet heidelberg,
Akademiestr. 4-8 - D-69117 Heidelberg. Germany. Fax: 0049-6211

With best regards
