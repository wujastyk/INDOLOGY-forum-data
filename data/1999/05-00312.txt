Scripts  KannaDa/Telegu/SinhAla
All are called Pallava grantha script; Not only
Kannada, Telugu, Sinhala. Once I asked a Burmese, Khmer to read
Kannada -they were able to read 80% of modern kannada.
All South East Asian scripts (before Indonesian and Vietnamese
were romanized) are developed from the Pallava grantha.
