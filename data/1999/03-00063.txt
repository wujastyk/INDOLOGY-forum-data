> Re Gita translations: Take a look at Kees. W. Bolle's translation
(University of California Press, I think 1979) and especially his
concluding essay "On Translating the Bhagavadgita," where he discusses
various widely available translations, including Edgerton, Ryder, Hill,
Prabhavananda, Bhaktivedanta, and so forth.  Interesting in Bolle's
translation is his rendering of karman as "ritual."  Many would agree that
Barbara Miller's translation is commendable.

How is van Buitenen's translation regarded?
