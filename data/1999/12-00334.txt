Dear Klaus,

Did you ever get this answered?  If not I can have someone get it for
me and locate the supposed chapter.

Happy New Year and Happy New Millennium,

Allen

Dear Colleagues

In 1887 two texts of veterinary medicine, the Azvavaidyaka and the
Azvacikitsita, were published in the Bibliotheca Indica series,
Calcutta.
Is there anyone who has easy access to these volumes and could
check,
whether there is a chapter dealing with the treatment of the burns
of
horses, and send a copy of that chapter to me, if it is found (in
cannot be
long). Although the series is common and well known, these volumes
seem to
be rare. We do not have them here and during my recent visit to
Leiden I
was searching for them without success at the usually very good
library of
the Kern Institute. Thanks in advance.

Klaus
