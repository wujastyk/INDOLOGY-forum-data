varna and jati
May I venture to point out that the expression 'blue blooded' is said to
have originated because the European aristocracy ventured into the sun so
little that their skins became pale and blue veins showed through. I cannot
provide you with a reference- just read it in a book several years back.
It would be worthwhile to investigate if the Indians in the territories of
Darius are ever mentioned as dark. Because according to AIT, the Indians in
the territories under the control of Persians could not have been residents
there for more than 6-10 centuries.

    Sorry, Nanda, I beg to differ: The dark complexion of most number of
Shudras as contrased with the color of the top varna cannot just be
explained
away on the basis of "work" in the fields under the hot sun.
