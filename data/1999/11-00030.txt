When did the gods become literate? Was: Are the gods literate?
A related question:
It is generally acknowledged, I think, that there is no reference to writing
in Vedic.
There is interesting discussion in Allchin's *The Archaeology of Early
Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States* [Cambridge Unv.
Press 1995] of the first attestations of the Brahmi and Karosthi scripts.
But I am not aware of discussion of, or even identification of,  the first
unambiguous reference to writing in Indic literature .
Can anyone point to early text-places where writing is unambiguously referred
to? Is there a generally acknowledged first reference to writing in India?
