Is "Sanskrit" Dravidian ?
It is good that you pointed this out. What I said here is wrong. I meant
that one third *of foreign words* in Hindi cannot be attributed to
Dravidian or Munda, but rather to this language x. I did not mean one third
of all Hindi words.
These borrowed terms tend to be agricultural terms, by the way.
Sorry for the slip.
