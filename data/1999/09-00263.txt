Sorry, just as I am not a Padre, I am not a Mian either.

I am simply a fellow who is concerned about academic freedom
and is appalled by attempts by certain individuals to close the
minds of others. E.g., Dr. Elst denouncing me on his website for
referring to "white" authors (including Nehru, and apparently D.D.
Kosambi too, whom he conveniently omits from my list), which he
calls the "game of over-awing the Indians".

Why don't you do something similar? Instead of trying to find out
my religious affiliation, simply say that I'm "white" (whether that is
really true doesn't matter; and in some discussions, nobody
cares). Then declare that anti-"white"-racialism is basically anti-
racism, as Elst did, and you can believe that you're all right. It's
very easy.
