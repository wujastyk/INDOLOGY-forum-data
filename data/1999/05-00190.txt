Strictly speaking, in advaita vedAnta, these are not so much positive
attributes of the Atman, as the absence of the opposite, e.g. nitya means
not anitya, mukta means not baddha, etc. See, for example, Sankara's
comments on the upanishadic line satyam jnAnam anantam brahma.

I think this is a question of talking at cross-purposes because of
translational limitations. Quality, to an Indian ear, seems to imply guNa,
which of course, the sAMkhyan purusha is devoid of, technically. But it is a
different question whether the purusha is viSishTa or not, which is what you
are saying. A different word than 'quality' would clear the issue.

Note that the content here is purely negational, so that this brings up the
nature of negation in sAMkhya. The issue might be better understood by
contrasting it with the mImAMsA, which gives abhAva or anupalabdhi the
status of a separate pramANa, whereas the sAMkhya does not.
