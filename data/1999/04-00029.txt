>Actually, the word "Nan2" in Nan2 tian1zhu2 and
>Nan2 Yin2du4 was Chinese word for "south".

 When asked whether Nan2 tian1zhu2 refers to South India,
 the answer was provided as below:
""
 Nan2 in the above terms  refers to the Dravida
 Country in South India, acc. to Xuan Zang biographer.
 Ref. Lokesh Chandra's article.
""

 Whether Nan2 tian1zhu2 or Nan2 Yin2du4 occur in Lankavatara,
 only L. scholars can tell that. I don't know.
