Mount Potalaka in Malaya mountains
 In what period, would this have been added? Any idea?
 In GaNDavyUha sUtra, Potalaka occurs for the first time
as the abode of Avalokitezvara.
 Chinese like to shorten Potalaka (Pu-ta-lo-chia) as
P'u-t'o. (cf. Chun-fang Yu, Prof. of Religion); Likewise,
In Tibet, Potala is a short form of Potalaka.
