Dear List Members,

I was surprised to read my translation of portions from the
Raghuva.m"sa here in the List. It was meant for private use and
was passed on without my knowledge. Please note that it was a
quick, literal and unpolished piece of work done as a favour at
Mr Ganesan's request. It was a personal matter for me, not
meant for the List. The conclusion which Mr Ganesan drew
from my translation is his own, viz.:

> Kalidasa is talking of Uraga as the capital of Pandyas. The mention
> of Malaya (Potikai), Sandal trees, Pearls from Tamraparni, Pandyas,
> etc., shows this. This Uraga later becomes HAlAsya.

Yours sincerely,
Roland Steiner
