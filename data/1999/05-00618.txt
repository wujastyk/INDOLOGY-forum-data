I have dealt with this issue of "contemporariness" well enough elsewhere,

However, not to the extent of ignoring all evidence in making one's
postulations.  It is a welcome development that there are scholars now who
are willing and able to judge matter freely and who do not simply accept
matters on faith (a criticism that I must most vigorously make of almost
all contemporary traditional Vedic scholarship), it is unfortunate that
newer scholarship also becomes subject to the same kinds of pitfalls and
dogmas, albeit in a different form.
I'm afraid Dr. Witzel's wrong, and so are you.
