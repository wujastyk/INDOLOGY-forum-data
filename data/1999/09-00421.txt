The geocentric theory was never official RC doctrine  (i.e., dogma). It was just something (mistakenly) supported by the leadership of the RC Church at a certain time in history (in response to what that leadership -- again mistakenly -- perceived as a dire threat to the Catholic faith). I'm not sure that the RC Church has "caught up with science" even now, but its doctrine is not (and never has been) tied to any particular scientific cosmology. There is a distinction between what leaders in the Church say from time to time and what the official doctrine (dogma) of the Church is.
The RC Church made its rapprochement with modern science long before its official reconsideration of the Galileo affair in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, Pierre Duhem -- the great theoretical physicist and philosopher and historian of science -- did his very modern work in science with the complete imprimatur of the Church, and he lived from 1861 to 1916.  See his Aim and Structure of Physical Theory (1914).
But that's enough from me. This is not an Indological subject. I just don't think that we should be unfair to the RC Church (or any other person or institution).
But I have already taken this too far. My apologies.
