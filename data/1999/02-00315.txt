Paishaacika Sanskrit?
Dear Ferenc,
That's interesting; thank you. As I said, the text as a whole is definitely
a sort of (hybrid) Sanskrit, i.e., much closer to classical Sanskrit than to
Prakrit -- but certainly the irregularities could be due to Prakrit
influence. If such is the case, do you think that could help in dating the
text at all?
Regards,
