I'm not aiming at anything at all.
I'm merely providing some facts and
informing you what will happen
if the current statistical trend
continues.  It is for *you* to show
that introducing a new "rOman skript"
controversy in India will result in
the accelerated spread of literacy.
I don't have to prove it.  You do.
You are the one who linked skript
with literacy.

Don't just go on talking about fonts.
India isn't a printing press.  It's
a real country with real people
holding strong likes and dislikes.
So talk about reality.

You din't answer my question.
Allegedly, this is all about
literacy.  So answer my question.
I'll even repeat it for you:  will
starting a brand new controversy
in India (about switching to
rOman skript) accelerate the
spread of literacy?

Now, now.  You won't get very far
by claiming that
opposing rOman skript == opposing literacy.
That's untrue and we both know it.

Personally, I believe everyone
should switch to HTML (in rOman
skript, of course).
