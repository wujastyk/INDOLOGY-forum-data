>Dear Shri Adhikary,
I curious to know if, as a matter of policy,  the Department of Asian Studies would
like consider a person like me for the job who does not have degree in Sanskrit but  has
demonstrated proficiency through published books, including the translation of an
ancient text into English, and 25 years of teaching experience in literature, theatre
and Indological areas.  I can teach besides Sanskrit and its literature and theatrology,
 Hindi literature, sitar and musicology  as well.
