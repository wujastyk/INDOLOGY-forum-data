None

The logical stand taken in raising the original question can apply to the
cases of Raamakrishna and Ramana (some would like to add the name of
Vivekaananda too) as well, for it concerns the basic contradiction between
the concept of Mukti and involvement in worldly activities. Let me repeat
that this stand does not imply an attempt to devaluate the social work of
the personalities concerned. No amount of ingenuity in attempting a sort of
reconciliation between the two aspects can invalidate the original question.
