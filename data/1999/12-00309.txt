The contention about pASupata ascetics was with reference to figures from
the kAyArohaNa temple and some others, not the one pictured in
Sivaramamurti's book. Since the publication of Sivaramamurti's book, a
number of other sculptures have been also identified as representing
Sankara. And yes, ekadandin need not mean Sankara. The figures have to be
studied impartially, without letting any preconceptions cloud one's
judgment. Frankly, that seems quite impossible as of now.
