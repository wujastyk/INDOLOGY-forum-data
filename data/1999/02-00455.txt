Apparent sandhi irregularities in the Bhagavad Gita
Charles Wikner Wrote
Whitney addresses this question in his grammar section 16 b.
"If the elided initial-vowel is nasal, and has the anusvara-sign (70,
71) written above, this is usually and more properly transferred to the
eliding vowel; but sometimes it is written instead over the
avagraha-sign".
