Skanda PuraaNa, the story of Parazuraama reclaiming coastal
land from the sea is found in BrahmaaNDa 57-58: Sagara's 60,000
sons looking for the missing azvamedha horse cause the flooding
of GokarNa and other places, the former inhabitants seek
Parazuraama's assistance, who threatens VaruNa with his bow
and consecrated arrow and compels him to restore back the
submerged land.
