<color><param>0000,0000,0000</param>Scarcely anything on Parazuraama is to be found in the above
referenced Matsya chapters, as they (43-44) are devoted to the
story of Kaartaviiryaarjuna, and the Bhaargava is only passingly
mentioned (43, 41-44) in that connection.<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>


<color><param>0100,0100,0100</param>Major puranic sources for Parazuraama mythology:


- ViSNudharmottara PuraaNa 1, 23-73 (51 chapters)

</color>- BrahmaaNDa PuraaNa 3, 21-58 (28 chapters)

- Brahmavaivarta PuraaNa 3, 24-46 (23 chapters)

</color>Apart from the versions narrated in the Sahyaadri KhaNDa of the
Skanda PuraaNa, the story of Parazuraama reclaiming coastal
land from the sea is found in BrahmaaNDa 57-58: Sagara's 60,000
sons looking for the missing azvamedha horse cause the flooding
of GokarNa and other places, the former inhabitants seek
Parazuraama's assistance, who threatens VaruNa with his bow
and consecrated arrow and compels him to restore back the
submerged land.
