Subject: IhAmRga-drama and the question of identification and aesthetic              experience
Message-ID: <161227052460.23782.12275519635135422203.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

One of the main purpose of the Sanskrit Drama is to produce aesthetic
experience. A presuppostion is that the spectator is able to identify
him/herself with the hero/artist. However, in some of the drama types like
IhAmRga, the hero is a divine being. How is the identification supposed to
take place when the hero is a God, for example Rama(saving Sita)? Is the
answer simply that Rama is possessing/pretending to possess human feelings
and thus give rise to the identification and subsequently the aesthetic
experience among the audience?

Does anybody posit knowledge to share with me and the group?
