[ADMIN] warnings and cancellations
I have just sent out warnings to those INDOLOGY members who have sent too
many or too long messages to the list in recent months.  I have also been
obliged to summarily delete the memberships of four contributors who
posted a grossly inflated number of messages to the list last month.
If you don't know what I'm talking about, please re-read the "Rules"
section of the INDOLOGY terms and conditions, on the web page
(http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indnet-rules.html).
