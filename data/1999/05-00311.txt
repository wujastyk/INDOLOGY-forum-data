Dr Rajaram and Dr. Jha: Vedic Glossary of Indus Seals
Dear Sri. Agarwal,
In one of Rajaram's web pages, he wrote an applauding review
of Shrikant's work which seems to say that Aryan homeland is
modern UP, then the vedic Aryans were spreading from there
out west, quoting several puranic materials.
Is the chronology outlined in the puranas, the basis for saying
Sindhu-Sarasvati civilation is Vedic Aryan? Did Rajaram use
Shrikant's findings to decipher the oldest writing
from Sarasvati delta as Vedic Aryan?
Thanks,
SM
