Another question: what does Belvalkar give as the correct reading of BG
XIV-3, commonly given as:

   idaM j~nAnamupAshritya mama sAdharmyamAgatAH  |
   sarge.api nopajAyante praLaye na vyathanti cha  |

-- ?

Madhva seems to take the reading as `idaM j~nAnamapAshritya' with the rest
remaining same.  A 13th-cent. manuscript shows this clearly.  Also, does
Belvalkar give XIII-1,

   prakR^itiM purushhaM chaiva xetraM xetraj~nameva cha  |
   etadveditumich{}chhAmi j~nAnaM j~neyaM cha keshava  ||

-- which is not to be found in Shankara's commentary (at least the
published versions)?
