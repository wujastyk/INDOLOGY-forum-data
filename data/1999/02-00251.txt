Kashmir, Tamilnadu, Panini, Abhinavagupta, etc.
  Not really. Must be very rare. Some are in Nepal, acc. to
  Prof. Witzel
  Avalokitezvara in Mt. Potalaka from GaNDavyUha sUtra
  is there in earliest Chinese translations of Gv.
  Also, Gv. Sanskrit editions by David Suzuki and in 1960s
  edition collating several mss. by P. L. Vaidya.
  In 800 AD, Borobudur depicts Gv. well; So, by then
  we have a crystallized version of Gv.
  So, I am not in search of Gv. mss; What is available
  from Chinese and Sanskrit is more than sufficient
  for my purposes.

  PS: What you are giving as Sanskrit does not appear to
  be chaste Sanskrit. Hope the future critical edition is OK. -NG
