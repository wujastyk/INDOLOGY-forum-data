Kalaapa
Some occurrences of "kalApam"/"kalAva"/"kalavam" in classical Tamil texts:
I have translated the snippets from
the commentary of naccin2Arkkin2iyar.
[I hope this also serves to cite usages of teh word "mayil"
in the classical text for Klayanaraman's purpose.]
ciRupANARRuppaTai:15
"maNi vayiN kalApam parappi"
->"[the peacock] spreading its feather that has eyes like blue gems"
ciRupANARRuppaTai: 264:
"maNi mayil kalApam maJciTaip parappi"
->"[the clouds at the peak of the moutain] spreading themselves
amidst the peacock feathers with eyes like blue gems"
kalAva: to mix:
tirumurukARRuppaTai:301
"Acin2i mutu cuLai kalAva"
->"[the rapidly descending water fall...] mixing the mature
pulp of the jack fruit ..."
neTunalvATai: 6:
"nITu itazk kaNNi nIr alaik kalAva"
->the long petals [of the kAntaL flower: glorisoa superba]
making up the head band agitated by the water waves
kuRJcippATTu:48
"akal iru vAn2attu vIcu vaLi kalAvalin2"
->the blowing wind when joining the vast expanse of the sky
kuRJcippATTu: 127
"kazal tuyal varum tORum tiruntu aTik kalAva"
->the male anklets agitating against the feet ...
malaipaTukaTAm: 234-5
"........ veL vErp pIlik
kalava maJJai kaTciyil taLarin2um"
pIli = the single quill
->"even if the peacock tires in its dancing owing to the weight of its
feather of white-rooted quills [or collection of feathers]  spread ..."
The commentator uses the word "kalApam" to explain "kalavam"!
[..."ATutaRku viritta kalApattin2atu pArattAlE ATiyiLaittu n-iRpin2um".
