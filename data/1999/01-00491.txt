Ingalls Jr and smalltalk
Dear Dominik,
I have Ingalls' source code in SmallTalk. I have not tried to execute it. If
no one else has already sent it to you let me know and I will send it as an
attachment. I am currently working on a OCR program and will let you know
when it begins to do something interesting.
