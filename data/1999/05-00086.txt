Gentoo studies
I do not know how many writings of Gonda you have read, but he was
precisely one of those researchers who did not deal with sundry
Englishmen and other Europeans, nor maharajas and 'native villains'. He
went straight to the Vedas and all the other texts he worked on. He
also had a firm grounding in Greek, Latin and Avestan, which made him
well equipped to make pronouncements on, e.g., 'Aryan' matters.
[As an aside: I wonder whether those notorious proponents of the
'Indic paradigms of knowledge and scholarship', whose names keep
popping up in messages on this list (and are they not an 'incestuous
intellectual clique'?), are anywhere nearly as qualified as Gonda was.
His qualifications may not be an absolute guarantee against errors --for
what could be an absolute one?--, but they are very significant.]
As for the armchair: when one works on philological material from the
farthest edge of history, or even from the middle ages, why not sit
comfortably? :-) Does it matter whether the armchair is in Utrecht,
Poona, or anywhere else? I am afraid that I do not understand this
criticism of Gonda.
