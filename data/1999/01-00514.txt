According to a court ruling that was posted in this list recently, the speaker is right.
I am reminded of what B.R. Ambedkar wrote about Indian tribals in his book _Annihilation of Caste_: "Thirteen million people living in the midst of civilization are still in a savage state and are leading the life of hereditary criminals!!
