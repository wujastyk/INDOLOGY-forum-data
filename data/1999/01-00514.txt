I did not say so. Please read carefully before criticising. I cannot be held responsible for poor reading.

The basis is in the United Nations charter of human rights. I believe that India too is a member of that organisation.

According to a court ruling that was posted in this list recently, the speaker is right.

I am reminded of what B.R. Ambedkar wrote about Indian tribals in his book _Annihilation of Caste_: "Thirteen million people living in the midst of civilization are still in a savage state and are leading the life of hereditary criminals!! But the Hindus have never felt ashamed of it. This is a phenomenon which in my view is quite unparalleled."

Perhaps Ambedkar was 'anti-Indian'?
