Age of the Veda ...
Although he will no doubt jump in himself to clarify this, Michael
Witzel has of course written quite a bit about this in exquisite
detail (I have just been reading some of it this morning). The dates
1500-1200 BCE for the composition (not final linguistic
redaction)--if I have understood rightly--of the earliest parts of
the RV seems well established.  I think it is incautious and
potentially misleading to toss around dates like 4500 BCE , as Fosse
has done, although he is rather careful to state that he does not
claim this as a date for all or even part of RV. Not all his readers
may be so careful.
