Friends,

does anybody know of an electronic text of zUdraka's mRcchakaTika? I have
access only to Kale's edition, and it has some misprints I simply cannot
rectify (especially those in the prAkRt part).
In particular, in the very first sentence of Act I, maitreya says:
...pacchidavvAiM, v.l. bhakkhidavvAI (chAyA: prekSitavyAni / bhakSitavyAni).
The language is supposed to be zaurasenI.
Any help would be appreciated

Ferenc
