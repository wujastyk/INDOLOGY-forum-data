Another obscurity in Belvalkar's Gita edition
For the verse BG 2.5, the reading of the critical edition (without any
variants) is:
          "mahAnubhAvAJ zreyo" as per Van Buitenen's Gita.
However, the change of z to ch being one of the optional sandhis allowed,
it would not change the value of the text significantly.
