However great a scholar might be, there's still room for error -
something overlooked, something misinterpreted.
Especially since the AI theory was once considered valid and there's
possibility that such preconceptions might have colored their views.
Plus, I've also read the book and my first gut instinct was that
the author was not sympathetic to brahmins - I initially thought
he might not be a brahmin himself.
Anyway, even if I'm mistaken, there's still room for error,
misinterpretation etc
Same defence as above.
It's not my opinion, but the general smartha opinion. Likewise,
the Iyergars don't accept the smarthas. The feeling is mutual.
But given the fact that they're the older sampradhAyam, the
smarthas have a better claim than the VaishnavAs.
Can you give a brief account on this?
Please enlighten me with this evidence.
And it is my firm opinion that Western scholarship and even Indian
scholarship inspired by the former, has not really been able to grasp the
true significance of the caste system (one exception that I've come across
are the works of Ananda Coomaraswamy). Too much is read into "Aryan", "top
caste", "varna" etc. Further egalitarian, secular and democratic movements
of the last two centuries has also prevented a correct evaluation of the
system. The fundamental problem I think, which Manu would endorse, lies in
the inherent nature of the people itself. Can a tiger truly understand the
world view of a cow?
With such a misreading I'm not surprised at the prevailing attitude towards
the varnAshramadharma.
