Dr. Fosse asked: It would have been interesting to know more
about how Mueller's own beliefs developed. Any Muellervadins out there?

Please see the relevant sections of the book
"Hindu Christian Enclounters" by Sita Ram Goel (2nd Ed)
Published by Voice of India, Delhi
The book tries to summarize the evolution of the religious beliefs of M
Mueller and also of other early Indologists like Griffith.
As you are aware, M Mueller is the bete noire of the Indeginous Aryan
school, and adverse critiques of his translations etc. started appearing in
his own lifetime, beginning with a scathing criticism of his interpretation
of RV in the 1870's by Swami Dayanand Sarasvati in his
Rigvedadibhashyabhumika and Rigvedabhashya.
The trend has continued ever since. Other early criticisms include the
Introduction of "Vaidik Kosha" of Pt. Hamsaraj (Lahore, 1928), "Indologists:
Their Motives and Inclinations" (Pt. Bhagvadatta; 1954) and dozens of other
tracts and books in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. The recent books of Dr. N.
Rajaram are only the latest in a continuous tradition, represented more
adequately in Hindi publications. Page after page are reproduced from the
writings and correspondence of Mueller (and Keith, Griffith, Wilson......)
to demonstrate their 'biases.' This is just FYI.
