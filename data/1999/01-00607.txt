Gilgit Manuscripts German Microfilm
Hello,
I have been informed that there exists a German microfilm copy of the Gilgit
Manuscripts that tends to be clearer than the Chandra's Facsimile edition.
Does anyone have any bibliographic information on where this microfilm is
held? An address and contact name would be extremely helpful for ordering
information.
Thanks in advance,
Warner Belanger
