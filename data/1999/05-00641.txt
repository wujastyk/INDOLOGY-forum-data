Does  any  Indologist  know  if  there  is  TulAbhAra  (the  practice
of  weighing  coconut,  jaggery,  butter  etc.  against  the  devotee's
weight  as  the  fulfillment  of  a  vow)  performed  TRADITIONALLY  in
any  shrine  besides  GuruvAyUr  and  DharmasthaLa?  I  am  not
interested  in  recent  (within  40  years)  copycats  introduced  into
other  South  Indian  shrines.  Obviously,  this  practice  comes  from
the  KRShNa  tulAbhAra  done  by  RukmiNi  in  the  BhAgavata.  Thanks.

Regards,
B.N.Hebbar
