Dear Indologists,

As I am organizing a seminar on modern Indian literature in Leiden, The Netherlands, I would be very grateful if there is anyone on this list who happens to know an address of the Hindi writer Krishna Baldev Vaid, and of the critic N.S. Jagannathan, who writes regularly for The Book Review?

Many thanks in advance
