- What would be tha castes that are Vaidiks ?

- Are the Arya Samajists classed as Vaidiks ?

- Are Vaidiks the followers of what is known in Western text-books as
  `Vedism' or `Vedic Religion' ? Most books claim that the Vedic religion
  is dead in India. Is it possible it survives amongst the Vaidiks ?
  If so, then Vaidiks would be followers of the oldest religion on Earth.

- How many Vaidiks are there in India (rough %) ?
