Indus and TamraparNI
Prof. Witzel mentioned about the famous female dancer from
the Indus valley. Jewelled, but in a state of undress.
I have seen a similar early bronze excavated from the AdichchanallUr
in Tirunelvely district. Indu Shekhar, in his 1960 book on
Sanskrit drama has the two bronzes, made by the lost-wax procees,
side by side. Are there any earlier or subsequent study on
these art masterpeces?
Thanks for any references,
