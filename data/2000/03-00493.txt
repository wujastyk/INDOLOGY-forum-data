>?From what I can make out from Thurman's account, even the quips about being
shaven-headed and the rest of the word-play seem quite similar. I don't know
if such a story is found in older Pali accounts.

What is the direction of indebtedness? Has the late Tibetan author taken up
an Indian Hindu theme and cast it into a Buddhist legend, or has the
follower of Sankara taken a Tibetan Buddhist theme and given it a Vedantic
spin on the householder vs. ascetic tension? Or is it that what is central
to both accounts is precisely this tension, that is present in all Indian
religions? I wonder if there is a similar story from some Jaina source, and
I wouldn't be surprised to find one. The specific doctrinal aspects of these
accounts could then be secondary, and we might want to point to a cultural
aspect of Indian society. Similar things could be happening with other
mythological themes too. Deriving geographical and historical information
out of them is quite tricky.

Intriguing. Do elaborate on the relationship between Srivaishnavism and the
Madurai sanghapalaka reference. Satyamangalam is of course important in
stories of Ramanuja's life also, but it is quite close to the TN-Karnataka
border, not in Madurai. It is Veerappan land nowadays.
