Bitter and angry? That's a bit over the top. When a researcher
doctors historical data and makes big claims about it, I think
that the fraud should be exposed. It's also fun doing it. My
feelings about Rajaram don't go further than that. But fraud is
fraud, nonetheless. And "misspelled the culprit's name"? Thanks
for *your* excellent detective work in pointing out a typo in the
dozen or so times Rajaram's name was spelled on the webpage!
Error fixed! Hit "reload" or "refresh" on the webpage and watch
the error disappear.

I bet that Rajaram wishes he could make his "computer enhanced"
horse seal disappear so easily!
