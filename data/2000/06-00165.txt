SOUTH ASIAN NARRATIVES IN FILM, LITERATURE, HISTORIOGRAPHY

The Society for the Humanities and the Asian Studies Department at
Cornell University invite applications for a Mellon Postdoctoral
Fellowship for a one year period beginning July 1, 2001.  Candidates
should be engaged in research projects on narratives in South Asian
film, literature, and / or historiography.  Candidates should also
conduct at least part of their research in one of the South Asian
languages other than English. Some preference will be given to scholars
who rely on Bengali, Hindi-Urdu, Nepali, Sinhala, and / or Sanskrit.

The fellowship offers a stipend of $30,000.  While in residence at
Cornell, postdoctoral fellows hold department affiliation, and have
limited teaching duties and the opportunity for scholarly work.

Candidates must have received the Ph.D. degree after September 1995.
Fellowships are limited to citizens of the United States, Canada, or
those with permanent U.S. residency cards.  All application materials,
including letters of recommendation, must be postmarked on or before
January 3, 2001.
