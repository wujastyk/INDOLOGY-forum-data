The deity Fudo-myoo (= Acala Vidyaraja) is venerated by all followers
of Shingon in Japan and many temples have him as their main deity but
he is not the "God of Fire" -- he is merely surrounded by a nimbus of
fire as are most vidyarajas in Buddhist iconography.  He seems to be a
variant form of Vajrapani.  The old Vedic deity Agni is known to
Shingon followers in Japan and is invoked in the initial portion of
the homa ritual there.

Best wishes,
