Regarding the Upanishads.
This is a theological, not a scholarly, opinion.  While I have the highest
respect for the late Mr Easwaran, any translation which forms a part of a
corpus of modern religious teaching will be interpretatively rendered to
conform to the doctrinal elements of that teaching.  Hence, the original
contextuality of the document is lost or altered.  Much is back-projected
onto the Upanishads from the subsequent 2500 years of thought. A very
accurate, philologically rigorous, translation (like, IMO, Olivelle's)
gives us better access to the original text for our own interpretation.
(Needless to say, reading in the Skt is by far the best option where
possible.)
