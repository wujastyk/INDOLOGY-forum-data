Vimanas!
For those interested in the UFO-vimana connection, there is a nice book
called Alien Identities that elaborately compares modern UFO accounts and
descriptions of vimanas and which finds a remarkable number of similarities
both in descriptions of the flying machines themselves and the
characteristics of their inhabitants.  The first part of the book analyzes
the modern UFO phenomena, and the second discusses Vedic parallels.  There
is a web site on on the book which lists its table of contents at:
