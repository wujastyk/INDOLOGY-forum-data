In other words, in Bengal the linga is the male member. The interesting
question, of course, is if this interpretation is continuous in Bengali
version(s) of Hinduism, or if we are dealing with a modern reinterpretation
of the old cosmic symbol which overlaps with its original meaning. I would
also like to know if this interpretation is universal in Bengal, or if it
is confined to Tantric circles. Possibly, Kripal is not so Freudian as I
thought. More info out there?
