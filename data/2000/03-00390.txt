Saraswati... (nairukta)
Dr. Kalyanaraman:
not, if you distinguish between Paninean etymology, modern linguistic one
and Yaska's Nirukta style (i.e. nairukta), as I did, plainly.   ---  3
different approaches.
Semantics is part of linguistics (and of course of philology); see my
earlier reference to K.Hoffmann's list in his paper on  how to do
etymologies
