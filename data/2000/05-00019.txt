purANa in chAndogyopanishad?
Eric Robert wrote:
There seems to have been an itihAsa-purANa tradition much older than the
texts that are handed down to us. See Paul Horsch, Die vedische gAthA- and
zloka-Literatur, Bern 1966. This book contains a chapter about the terms
itihAsa and purANa in Vedic literature.
