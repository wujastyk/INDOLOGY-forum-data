Mijnheer Elst,
since you found it necessary to refer in English to my half-private message
to you, and nicely twist it, here is the text & translation of my remark:
=
(Mr. Elst, this kind of stupid jokes don't belong, indeed, on this list.
At least not by one who thinks himself to be a serious researcher. I do
*not* call you, indeed, together with your northern friends, a stupid
Belgian, or something like this...)
exacty the opposite of what Mijn-herr Elst makes of it in the post below.
And, though not part of Indology discussion (except for all those similar
North/South exchanges), the expression "een stomme Belg" is not a German
but a Dutch expression, as are the "Belgian jokes" that I was subjected to
during my 10 years or so in Holland. I have never heard one outside the
Netherlands;  the concept of "stupid Belgians" is unknown there.
And thanks for the Adenauer quote. Was a funny man, with his concept of
three kinds of truth:
the common truth, the clear truth, and the *real* truth...  Shouldn't we
introduce that in our discussions? T1, T2, T3?
Groetjes, MW
