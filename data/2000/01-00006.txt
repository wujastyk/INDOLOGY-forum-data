Millennium
But if we imagine (not a "Year Zero") but a "Point Zero" between 1 BC and 1
AD -- so that the "1st millennium" began on 1/1/1 AD -- then wouldn't the
year 1999 AD be the last (2000th) year of the 2nd millennium (just as the
year 9 AD was the last -- 10th -- year of the 1st decade of the 1st
millennium)?  If so, then 1/1/2000 AD would be the first day (and 2000 AD
the 1st year) of the 3rd millennium.
