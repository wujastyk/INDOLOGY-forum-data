Democracy in old India
Thanks for the reference. Makes for very interesting reading.
Corruption and inefficiency are good reasons to remove someone
from his post. But why debar all the relatives of such a man,
unless the default option was to make any such appointment
hereditary? Do we have evidence for what qualified a person to
be appointed to an administrative post in the first place?
