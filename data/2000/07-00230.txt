Subject: Aryan invasion by sea?
Message-ID: <161227059884.23782.8501213200643663541.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

NG>>Excavations at Lothal have proved that IVC seals were employed

<<<
If seals were employed for trade,
couldn't dolphins, or even whales,
have been employed for large-scale
immigration?

In other words, could the
notorious Aryan invasion
have been seaborne?  Have
any remains of chariots or
spoked wheels been recovered
from under the Indian Ocean?

Perplexed as usual,
Narayan Sriranga Raja.

I fail to understand this, as I did not mention anything
about Aryan invasion at all!

Indian archaeologists have shown that the seals were used
in seaborne trade esp., at Lothal. Thought scholars in this
forum may be interested in knowing that seals used
on packages in and out of ports are mentioned in sangam poetry.
Hence my original writeup.
