Bhartrhari
Dear Indology List:
How would you categorize someone like Bhartr.hari vis-a-vis the
6 orthodox schools of Indian philosophy. Would it be fair to say
that he represents another school of philosophy, i.e. philosophy of
language, that looked upon the Veda as sacred, yet with slightly less
deference given to the Veda than in the 6 orthodox schools?
Thank you,
