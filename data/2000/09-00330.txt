jantar-mantar
The astrological parks created by Jaisingh are quite beautiful.
As I understand so far, the various instruments constructed by Jaisigh at
Delhi, Jaipur, and Benares employed eminent astrologers of his time from
both Hindu and Islamic schools. The primary concept he was going for was
bigger is better -or at least more accurate.  Apparently, he either
disregarded or was unaware of advances in  the West when these were made.
Can any one shed light on this?(excuse the pun).
Thanks,
Robert
