BiBTeX Packages for citing MSS
Dear Readers,
Over the past few months I have been making the - at times
frustrating - transition from WordPerfect to TeX and LaTex. Looking
back, all the effort seems worth it. Now I hope I'll never have to
use a word processor again.  I am especially indebted to those who
have made ``Devanaagarii'' and ``EDMAC'' available.  On a primitive
and antiquated PC, I can now typeset Skt. class readings.  A short
while ago I considered this unrealistic. All this said, I have
encountered a problem with BiBTeX.
BiBTeX has been useful in organizing and typesetting most run of the
mill citations and bibliographies.  I am using the ``Oxford''
package: its closest to the way I have always tried to do things.
But what does one do if MSS need to be cited?
Does anyone know of a BiBTeX package which can appropriately format
references to South East Asian Skt. MSS?
