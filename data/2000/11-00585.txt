query
Dearest Colleagues, I am looking for a devotional Sanskrit text (with
English translation) similar to Jayadeva's Gitagovinda: in other words, a
text in which the love for God is expressed in a strong erotic language, and
according to kavya-style.
Furthermore, I have a great difficulty to find this text: Somaprabhacarya's
Srngaravairagyatarangini ("the wave of the rasa of love and of the
renouncement").
Someone can help me?
Many Thanks, Yours faithfully
Daniela Rossella
