Libraries have the problem that the paper of publications of the 19th
century and the first half of the 20th century is already very
"brittle". So reprints of many indological works of this period is
highly desirable. But you have to take into account the (different)
copyright laws. That means, one cannot publish blindly all and
everything without checking if it is possible to do so.

Indeed, MacDonell's Vedic grammar from 1910 was recently reprinted by
Munshiram Manoharlal (ISBN: 81-215-0946-7).
