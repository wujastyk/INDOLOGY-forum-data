Yavanas and Yapaniya
On 23 Mar 2000 I had written
I just saw Jain-Shilalekha-Samgrah, part 4, page 9. In the sixth
cent. Hoskote copperplate Sanskrit inscription of Konganyadhiraj,
the order is actually referred to as "yaavanika".
I was intrigued by the verse in darshan-sar:
kallaaNe varaNayare sattasaye pa.ncha uttare jaade
jaavaNiyasa.nghabhaavo sirikalasaado hu sevaDado
Trans: In Kalyana town, after 705 years (after the death
of King Vikrama) the "jaavaNiya" sangh arose from the shvetapata
(monk) Shrikalasha.
Tha Kadamba copper plate of Krishnavarman uses "yaapaniiya".
It is not impossible that the original term was "yaavaniiya".
