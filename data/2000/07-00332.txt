Subject-prefix for INDOLOGY (fwd)
If an individual subscriber wishes to have [INDOLOGY] in the subject
line, this can easily be done by sending the command
SET INDOLOGY SUBJECTHDR
to listserv at listserv.liv.ac.uk. I have my subscription set in that
way, but I would urge against using that as a default subject header
for everything.
