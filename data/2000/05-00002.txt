Any opinions on two reference works?
Someone recently suggested consulting the Routledge Encyclopedia of
Philosophy. I visited the Routledge site and discovered the 10-volume set
costs almost $4,000.
I noted they have two other titles that look promising:
Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy
Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy
Does anyone have an opinion on these books?
