Ideological distortions of MSS
Then, the question becomes:
 1. Is Vyasa's commentary quoting Yoga Suutra without edits?
 2. Is Vyasa's commentary preserved without edits to it?
I did compare half a dozen of translations and they do differ very slightly.
That points at the single source which might not be the original.
Let's put the same question differently:
At the time of Vyasa's commentary (and later on),
what was the usual way to copy Sanskrit MSS?
A. Was it a responsibility of a member of brahman caste?
B. Was there "peer review" of a copy?
C. Was there a practice to keep copies a MS in several locations?
D. Was there an established procedure on copiing MSS, like a code of
  conduct for a copyist? (like "one has to copy MS as it is even if
  the meaning is incomprehensible")
Sincerely, Dmitri.
