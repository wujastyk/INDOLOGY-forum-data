.dombii as scavenger woman
 I have also seen Dombar/thombar, a Dravidian caste in Salem, Tiruchy, etc.,
 Is Dombii the "iTumpi" in tamil works? Online Tamil Lexicon
 has "iTumpu"=mischief, pranks; "iTumpai"=affliction;
 It is interesting that "iTumpan" is the Chief of Skanda's hosts.
 For Skanda afflicting children in MBh., I read a post by
 N. Iyanaga a while ago.
 Lokesh Chandra, oDDiyANa: A new interpretation,
 L. Sternbach felicitaion volume, part I, Lucknow, 1979
 p. 491-514 gives a reference in German "where the presence
 of Dravidian expressions in the dhAraNI-s is explicitly
 pointed out by several Buddhist texts [5], some of which
 were translated into Chinese as early as A.D. 265-316 (T.310),
 A.D. 383(T.1547), and A.D. 398-399 (T. 212). [...]" (L. Chandra).
 [5] =Franz Bernhard, Zur Einstehung einer DhAraNI,
 ZDMG, 117 (1967): 148-168
 Of course, Daakinii occurs in the tamil CilappatikAram, probably
 first to do in literature.
