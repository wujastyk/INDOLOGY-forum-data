recent controversies
Disputants!
   I came across a nice line attributed to a Naiyaayika by the
Vaiyaakaranas:
"asmaakuunaaM naiyaayikezaam arthani taatparyam zabdani kozcintaa!"
(It seems to lose something in transliteration...)
This reminded me just a bit of the ongoing debates on the list between
scientists and Indologist/philologists. The following 'exchange' is also
supplied as a parody of a fruitless debate between the same two:
Vaiy: "Naiyaayikaah pazavah!"
Naiy: "VaiyaakaraNaas tRNavah!"
Vaiy: "tRNava iti katham?!"
Naiy: "pazava iti yatham!!"
Vaiy: "azuddham iva vakSyase."
Naiy: "mahe raNaaya cakSase."
The latter was declared the winner, which just goes to show what can
happen if you shout a Vedic mantra loud enough --and at just the right
moment.
