3. Likewise, feelings of awe provoked by the blue expanse of the sky
or the dark majesty of rain-bearing clouds sometimes prompted poets
and myth-makers (at least in Hinduism) to conceive God as blue or
dark too.

Vishnu is primarily black: Kalittokai describes him sleeping
on his bed over the milky ocean with an elephant.
The color of both Vishnu and elephant is black.
Usually, Vishnu is compared with black sea, elephant,
black cloud, or black jewels. In some cases this black
Vishnu is told as dark blue or deep green.
