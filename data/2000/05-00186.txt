an earlier, more humble settlement. From what you say about the
other texts:

</color>it looks as if a not entirely warranted jump is made from "probable
reference" to "therefore... titular Sankaracharyas". Is every
Sankaracharya a titular head of a matha? (Cf. all the Nagarjunas
among the Buddhists.)
Hacker's and Kulke's view still does not look unreasonable. By
which I of course do not mean that it should be considered
unquestionable; but it does offer an answer to the question why it
is only so long after Sankara that we have a clear statement about
a "matha". The argument ex silencio can work in both ways, but
the parallels in other traditions suggest that H. and K. could be
right.
