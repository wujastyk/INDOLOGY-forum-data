Dear Prof. Shim,

I believe Lynn Denton discusses varuNa's noose to some extent in 
this essay:

        Denton, Lynn Teskey.  ?Varieties of Hindu Female Asceticism.? 
                In _Roles and Rituals for Hindu Women_  Ed. Julia Leslie.  
                Rutherford, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 
                1991.  (Ch. 10,  pp. 211-231.)

It may be helpful to you, although I cannot say how specifically it 
addresses the particular topic of your interest.  

Perhaps others on the list are familiar with it and can advise you more 
fully in that regard.

Yours truly,
