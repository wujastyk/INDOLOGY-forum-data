The site is about the native "Dravidian Negroids" conquered
during  "Krishnaite" and "Ramaite" invasions etc.

The "Dalitstan" website, apparently a well funded operation,
is run by some people in Texas, who are certainly not Dalit
(or Indian).

It seems that the same people have created the websites:

Rajputana Liberation Front of Sakastan
Sakastan Liberation Organization
Sudrastan Books
Mughalstan Message Board

These other sites are certainly inspired by writings by
Gurupdesh S. Pandher, but are far too extensive and
well designed to have been done by him.

I have read some of Ambedkar's works and other books
that have come out of neo-Buddhist movement. Dalits
have a lot to complain about, but these web sites are not
done by them.
