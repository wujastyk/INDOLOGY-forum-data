"Dalitstan" (RE: 'INDIA ABROAD' on new textbooks)

The "Dalitstan" website, apparently a well funded operation,
is run by some people in Texas, who are certainly not Dalit
(or Indian).
It seems that the same people have created the websites:
Rajputana Liberation Front of Sakastan
Sakastan Liberation Organization
Sudrastan Books
Mughalstan Message Board
These other sites are certainly inspired by writings by
Gurupdesh S. Pandher, but are far too extensive and
well designed to have been done by him.
I have read some of Ambedkar's works and other books
that have come out of neo-Buddhist movement. Dalits
have a lot to complain about, but these web sites are not
done by them.
