Elst's review of Kochhar's Vedic People

There are few truly wild horses left anywhere. Most are domesticated
horses which returned to the wild state. At one time, after wild horses
migrated from the Western hemisphere to Asia, they were spread out over
vast ranges of the "Old World" including India. There really is no solid
evidence that *all* these species went extinct prior to the
domestication of the horse. IOW, wild horses were not necessarily
confined to Central Asia before the single or multiple domestication
events.
I personally have not read anywhere about wild equids with sivalensis
traits, but domesticated horses do exist quite commonly. Since these
horses are mostly in southeast Asia and are strongly divergent from
other equids, I doubt very seriously that the resemblance is a
coincidence.
Anyway, if DNA can be extracted from old sivalensis remains comparison
studies should be revealing.
Not in ancient times that I'm aware of. They do exist there now, and are
also found in parts of Europe particularly Italy.
No, not only can swamp (48 chromosomes) and river buffalo (50
chromosomes) interbreed and produce fertile offspring, but both can
interbreed with cattle (60 chromosomes) although fertile offspring from
such unions are rare.
Incidently about 70% of the milk produced in India still comes from
water buffalos.
Don't know for sure, but probably at least by the Aeneolithic.
Clay figurines of water buffalo and Bos indicus are common in Somrong
Sen and Ba Na cultures of the Indochinese neolithic possibly suggesting
some sacred value.

Water buffalos are mentioned in the Rgveda. For example:
