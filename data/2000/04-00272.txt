Lokananda
<<<
 The Naagaananda is a dramatization of the legend of
Jiimuutvaahana which was told in the B.rhatkathaa (see F.D.K.
Bosch: "De legende van Jiimuutavaahana in de Sanskrit-
Literatuur". Leiden 1914; Maho Shibazaki: "Jiimuutavaahana
monogatari - B.rhatkathaa kei densh? wo ch?shin ni" ("The
legend of Jiimuutavaahana - focal point [of the paper]: The
transmission of the B.rhatkathaa"), Bukkyo Bunka or Journal of
Buddhist Culture 35 (Academic Series 9), published by the
Young Buddhist Association of the University of Tokyo, 1996,
pp. 79-97). The legend is laid in the Malaya mountains
already in the B.rhatkathaa. To say it clearly: "The incidents
happening in the Malaya" in the Naagaananda are completely
unrelated to the mentioning of the Malayas in Lokaananda V.5.
Thanks again. Not only Classical Tamil texts pair up Himalaya and Potiyil.
Even 7th century Shaivaite Tevaram says Shiva's special abodes
are those, Tamil literature praises Potiyil on par with Himalayas
all the time.

Ta. kayilai = Skt. kailAsa
I will check in "peruGkatai", written by koGkuvELir, the ancient tamil
version of bRhatkathA. Unfortunately, the front and end portions
of the great work was lost. What is even more sad is that
twice the peruGkatai palmleaves were procured from kongu homes,
but lost eventually (the great editor of sangam texts, UVS
gave one to C. V. Damodaram Pillai of Jaffna, later never seen.
Another in a partition quarrel between brothers, many mss. eaten
by termites in a room locked for years by a court order. When opened,
peruGkatai was damaged.)
Dr. Bronkhorst's paper puts paravata in VP 2.485-7 in Himalayas,
OTOH Prof. Aklujkar has written many papers over the years
placing in the South.
Tamil texts locate parvata as malaya/potiyil.
Does Kuvalayamala talk of Malaya mountains?

PS: Thanks to Hollywood, Dalai Lama, geopolitics, etc., the Tibetan
positions are on the rise. Hopefully, texts like gaNDavyUha, etc.,
in Tibetan will be given academic translations...
