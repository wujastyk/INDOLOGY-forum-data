.Siddhis and Indology
.Are not the majority of the ancient writings of India concerned with the
siddhis of the superior person?
Modern Liberal academicians deny the existence of siddhis; since everyone is
declared to be equal or because such concepts are considered to be
superstitious religious beliefs.
What is left to study?
I argue that many of the reports of siddhis were quite scientific and can be
verified with modern scholastic effort.
