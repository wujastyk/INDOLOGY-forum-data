That is not entirely true, Vedic Dharma was also spread to what is today
Vietnam, Cambodia, Java, Sumatra, Burma, Nepal and Xinjiang in China. I do
not think that the Brahmins saw what is today Andhra Pradesh and Bengal as
any different than what is today Vietnam. It was a frontier and opportunity
to make a living that kept pushed out till it reached its maximum potential
and eventually retreating to peninsular India not because the Brahmins
wanted it that way.
