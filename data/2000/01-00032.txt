Typographical error in the Bhagavad-Gita?

Gosh, seems like those who did respond didn't see the obvious flaw, while
those who do see it won't respond. I suspect Mr. Chawla is working with some
publication which mistakenly puts the vowel "i" before striyo in the verse,
as in some regional pronunciations in north India. The correct word for
woman is strI, not istrI. Meter also demands a form of strI. Neither istriyo
nor kshatriyo is acceptable. Count the syllables. As for the reason why
kshatriyas have not been included with vaishyas and shudras, dare one point
to the numerous essays on the position of brAhmaNas vs. kshatriyas in Indian
thought?
