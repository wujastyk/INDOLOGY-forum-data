There is a reason for approaching the date of Mahabharata this way . The
planetary motions are determinate including those of the orientation of the
earth's rotational axis, which has a cycle of approximately 26, 000 years .
I am not sure, if the people who have made the Panchang have included this
motion . If they have not ( their model is based on observations, which may
not be as accurate ), then the date will be off.  Still , it would be
better than searching for the needle ( remains of the iron in Mahabharat)
in the haystack . If Lord Ganesh, and Vyasjee recorded things accurately (
the descriptions ) , it would be possible to estimate the date of the
Mahabharat War, and hence, the Iron Age in India. All things have to
match .  I am looking for an appropriate software to match the
description . If any one knows about such a software, pl provide the
details by posting it.
The web site where I have posted the details of the present Estimation is
mentioned below:
