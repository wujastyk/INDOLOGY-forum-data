snake & mongoose in ancient India
A common aquatic, mongoose like, brown, furry animal would be an otter.
Otters are far more widespread in India and Iran. The ancients were not
always accurate when it came to describing animals. For e.g. ground
burrowing marmots in north west india/afghanistan... were mistakenly called
gold digging ants by herodotus.
Distinctive features of beavers are dam building and large flat tails. Are
these referred to in the avesta? If not then all that can be inferred is a
furry aquatic creature.
