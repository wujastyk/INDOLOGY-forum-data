Hindu concept of time
Dear Victor!
I forgot to mention an article about Indian time by Eliade. However, I do
not remember the name of the article. It is in a book with several essays
on time in different religions and culture. Contact me in end of this
month, and I should be able to give you the data.
Best regards
Jon.
