Azerbaijan Hindu Fire-Temple ( Re: Zoroastrians in other              countries)
I wonder if it had any connection with Zoroastrian
religion. I would think it probably had.
It is still there. Someone sent me a URL
http://www.bakupages.com/wwwroot/fire_temple.asp
Are there any functioning fire-temples in China?
Someone told me there may be some, but that is hard
to believe.
