Dr.  Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical School and of the Mind/Body project
(  http://www.mindbody.harvard.edu/   ) has been doing serious research,
over the past few decades, of meditation (MT, Tibetan monks, etc. etc. ),
and its effects: lowering of rate of metabolism, more recently also using
brain scanning: with clearly visible effects, and if I remember correctly,
ultimately, linking of left & right hemisphere.
Definite paper on this topic  due in about a week.

According to this, the trick is that any "mantra" works, whether it is "oM
"or "namo buddhaaya" or "hail Mary" or "Allahu Akbar", or just *any* old
syllable or word such as "one",  "bad", or whatever. It is the repetition
that does it. Same with repetition of movements (Dervish dances etc. etc.).
Old human method.

For the time being, see his books:
