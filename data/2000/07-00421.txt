The biweekly Sanskrit broadcast from Cologne/Germany (Deutsche Welle, part
of their Hindi program) is now CONTINOUSLY available from their Sanskrit
web page, not just on every second Monday via the Hindi page.

or directly at

So, our letters have taken effect. However, they are still busy with the

death anniversary.

Good + clear listening... Useful for class.
