vikaara) of the k.setra. From a purely text-internal perspective, then, one
would not expect sa.mghaata to be yet another synonym for 'body'.
To be sure, mental 'organs' are regarded as material; but why should buddhi
(listed in 13.5) be thought more so than cetanaa or dh.rti (13.6) -- which
even in Sankara's view are functions of the buddhi, vij?aana or
anta.hkara.na? I don't follow this argument. As far as I can see, from a
Samkhya perspective, all items listed in 13.5-6 would seem to belong to the
same category, i.e., prak.rti.
I'm afraid I lack access to this commentary. Could you please list the
names of the other karmayonis?
You are quite right; I meant 18.29-35. I was quoting from my obviously
imperfect memory!
Certainly, both dh.rti and (even more so) buddhi are used with different
meanings in different contexts in the Gita. That's part of the problem.
Best,
Martin
