Who is the authority for this statement on dog-cooking Doms?
I remember having read about certain castes eating dogs, mentioned
in Manusmriti, going by a name (I forgot) that translated as "dog-eaters".
Could it be that by "dog" is meant: (H.) giida.r? Rightly or wrongly
translated as jackal? I suppose the Latin name for giida.r is Canis aureus,
at least this was the name given in a zoological garden in India I once
visited. Between the wild giida.r and (certain) domesticated dogs there
is great similarity, but the giida.r does not at all look like what I
think of as a jackal.
As a matter of fact, I myself am a "dog-eater", having partaken of
nicely cooked giidar.r as the guest of a community in Himachal Pr.
quite often. So all information about the subject you can share
will be very much appreciated. (As well as references to stories
about the giida.r-siingii and its supposed magical properties.)
Thanks,
Jaap
