Subject: Rajaram's "horse seal"
Message-ID: <161227060265.23782.11291100070869182345.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

After looking at :

http://www.safarmer.com/pico/delusion2.html

and a picture of an Indian Onager at :

http://www.deer.rr.ualberta.ca/library/taxonomy/onager.html

the tail of the Onager seems to begin further down its arse
than does the tail of the creature in the seal in Mackay 453.

An example of how up the horse's rump the tail starts can
be seen by examining the pictures of horses at

http://www.hughesarabians.com/photo/index.html

Whatever the creature is that is shown on the seal in the
first URL above, it is not an Indian Onager.
