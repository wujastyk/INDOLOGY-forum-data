Rajaram's "horse seal"
After looking at :
http://www.safarmer.com/pico/delusion2.html
and a picture of an Indian Onager at :
http://www.deer.rr.ualberta.ca/library/taxonomy/onager.html
the tail of the Onager seems to begin further down its arse
than does the tail of the creature in the seal in Mackay 453.
An example of how up the horse's rump the tail starts can
be seen by examining the pictures of horses at
http://www.hughesarabians.com/photo/index.html
Whatever the creature is that is shown on the seal in the
first URL above, it is not an Indian Onager.
