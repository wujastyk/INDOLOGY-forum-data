Probably not. I once asked a Norwegian Indo-Europeanist cum Celticist about
this, and he said the connection made between Eire and Aryan was spurious.
But there has been such a theory.

In a scholarly context, the first use is erronous. (Aryans are a subgroup
of the Indo-Europeans). It goes back to a time when being "Aryan" was
supposed to be very nice. The Germans for a period loved being Aryan, and
the term was politicized with the consequences we know. Today, the
non-technical use of "Aryan" should be avoided, since it is so closely
connected to European fascism. Only the Indo-Iranians were Aryans in the
technical sense.
