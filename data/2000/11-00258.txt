Dear Sir
While I thank you for the prodigious amount of reference you have given, I
am dismayed at your comments, which do not sound logical. You sume that
familiarity with ANY tamil literature will lead to all the references you
have given. I did write that the search I did with Cologne ebase yielded
negative result
I also notice that you have failed to give any reference for VaiNavam.
long
These are wholly unwarranted and untrue comemnts. My last 5 posts had
lengths 11 lines, 20 lines, 73 lines, 153 lines and 34 lines. The longer
posts were due to reproduction of other's posts or combining 3 replies in
one post. If this is what you term as "long" and "often", I would request
you to use your arithmetic sense, which I am sure you possess in abundance.
If you want to make a post of 316 lines , it is between you and the list
admin and there is no need to drag my name
Regards
Vijayaraghavan
