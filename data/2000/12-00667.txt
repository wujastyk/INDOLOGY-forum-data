question on recaka-pUraka-kumbhaka
I would appreciate any pointers to textual citations of recaka,
pUraka and kumbhaka - terms associated with prANAyama practice.
They are not directly found in the pAtanjala yogasUtras or in
vyAsa's commentary. vAcaspati mizra uses these terms, but he
is not their inventor. Zankara already uses all three, in his
commentary on gItA 4. 29. Any older sources, e.g. mahAbhArata
or dharmazAstra/smRti texts or Buddhist texts?
Happy new millennium everybody,
Vidyasankar
ps. Here's hoping that tempers cool down in the new year. May
I suggest taking a deep breath as a possible safeguard? :-)
