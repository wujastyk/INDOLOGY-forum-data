Zoroastrianism and Buddhism
1. Both Zoroastrianism and Buddhism coexisted in pre-islamic Afghanistan.
The Farsi term "but" (idol) is sometimes regarded to have been derived
from "Buddha".
2. It seems that there may have been some connection between Shakadvipi
Brahmins and Buddhism in Gaya region. Incidentally in Gujarat and Rajsthan,
the Bhojakas are still affiliated with Jainism.
