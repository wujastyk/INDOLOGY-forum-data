Evils of Written Vedas? (paapa)
This may be Tarak Wani's personal opinion, (NB: unsubstantiated by
quotations or by references to research), but it is not born out by
detailed  investigations.
Rahul P. Das has shown in his c. 150 pp. MA diss. (Hamburg 1985) that paapa
is INDEED  best translated as 'evil' (cf. also, for the historical
development of the term, Tracing the Vedic Dialects in: Colette Caillat
(ed.), Dialectes dans les litteratures indo-aryennes.  Paris 1989, p.
97-264).
If 'contingent on the body' implies impurity, illness and other evils
'sticking' to one's body, then this is correct (cf. the Atharvavedic
'apamarga' plant & sorcery). But TW's cryptic sentence may also be
interpreted in other (Advaita? etc.) ways.  --
However, how learning the (Atharva)veda texts leads to 'rise(?)' above
'contingence' is very much open to question. Even in modern Orissa,
Atharvavedins are looked down upon,  due to their connection with sorcery,
and also due to some other local social facts.
Of course, nobody disagrees with the fact that the oral transmission of
Vedic texts in South Asia is unique among the world's cultures.
