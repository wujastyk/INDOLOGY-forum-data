Supposed redatings of ancient China
Sethna's
Steve, the name is K. (Kaikhushru) _D._ (Dhunjibhoy) Sethna.
I notive that you have consistently called him K. N. Sethna
on your website too. And in case anybody is curious about
his religio-political affiliations, he is a Zoroastrian, of
Iranian ancestry.
