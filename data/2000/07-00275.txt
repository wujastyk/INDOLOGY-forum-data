A few words, in an attempt at countering a rewriting of some most recent
history (for those who are still interested. Dr. Elst's recent
performance suggests that he will be reading this too):

(Here I thank Dr. Elst for again demonstrating his fixation on Hitler.
The unnamed "political personality" was Goebbels, who *was* a
different person.)

My article was (let us not conveniently forget that, Dr. Elst) a
response to what N.S. Rajaram had written before, in that same paper. I
did *not* start. It is all perfectly documented and dated, and I am
growing tired of repeating this.

Several references? Elst has not shown us, despite my openly offering
all the materials in electronic, easily searchable form on this forum.

Why should Rajaram first know me? He writes things in a public
newspaper about Western scholars. I am a scholar from the 'West' and
have every right to respond. And the Indian Express thought so too.

>             If Zydenbos doesn't want to own up his "Nazi" attack on Rajaram,

I never own up what I have not done. Instead, I have offered everyone
the text of my article (see below).

> We welcome conversions to fairness.

Yes, even if it takes more than a year for Dr. Elst to admit that 3
follows 2, I too welcome it. (See below for more.)

Yes, gloves covered with the sweet poison of misinformation. All the
e-mail is available, conveniently grouped, at:

http://www.bigfoot.com/~zydenbos/laermendepolemik.html

together with Rajaram's article and my response to that article.
There's openness and fairness for you.

(By the way: Dr. Elst also mentioned on 5 Sept. 1999 that my identity
was confused with that of Rajesh Kochhar, "who had been defeated by
Rajaram in a public debate on the AIT some time before and was smarting
for revenge". Prof. Kochhar is with us on this list now and may be
interested in giving a short update of that story - if it is not too
distasteful.)
