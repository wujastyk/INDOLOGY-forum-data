>?From time to time, in this list, you have shown your ignorance and
unreasonable hatred against Tamils. However, when you ask, "Did the Tamils
keep quiet in Sri Lanka?," I can say only one thing; "It is wise NOT
commenting on something when one does not know anything."

Thus, a humble suggestion to your excellency.
Why don't you restrict yourself within the topic in hand,
rather than dragging innocent parties for your mudslinging parties?

Above everything, criticising Tamils will not make any sex change in Dr.
Rajaram's horse's genitals.

Thank you very much for understanding, if you have lent ears.
(I believe, I. Mahadevan is also a Tamil Brahmin;-))

regards,
