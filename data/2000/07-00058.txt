you who enter!' From Dante: entrance of hell).

Most students of the IV script would agree that we have to deal with
hundreds of individual characters which makes the script basically
logographic (as all early *deciphered* scripts from Egypt to China started
out).

<<There have been a few, in my opinion misguided dissenters, though, who
read these hundreds of characters as based on a real alphabet (but: all
alphabets have <much> less than 100 characters),     --   including the
most recent, very much touted  attempts by SR Rao or  Raja Ram.  They read
the IV script as early Indo-Aryan, very funny early Indo-Aryan though, and
with an a-historical setting as well>>

Precisely the point I made in 1999 (= Panjab, Sindh dialects(?)/languages):
Early Sources for South Asian Substrate Languages. Mother Tongue (extra
number), October 1999, pp.1-70
or in a an easily accessible, though somewhat shorter version that adds a
long,  more popular introduction:
Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan (Rgvedic, Middle and Late Vedic),
EJVS Vol. 5,1, Aug. 1999, 1-67 (http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs)

But, my materials  are not taken from speculation ("maybe Drav., maybe
Burushaski" -- NB Burushaski never seems to have penetrated into the Panjab
plains!), rather, as I underlined just yesterday :
they are taken from the only *nearly contemporary* evidence we have: the
300-odd loan words in the Rgveda!  Otherwise, there are only a few
"Meluhhan" words in Mesopotamian sources, some of which may be Bahrain
(Dilmun)- based and therefore misleading.

yes, but they also are more  complex!

NB. as an OVERLAY on continiung and, after the end of the IVC, re-remerging
local cultures!

Which, again, underlines the emblematic character of many of the signs that
were readable from Panjab to Sindh to Baluchistan to Gujarat, ---  like,
perhaps the better example, due to [partial] *cultural* domination:  many
Chinese characters (not ALL!) from Sian/Loyang to Nanking and from old
Silla Korea to Heian Japan to N. Vietnam, regardless of language or
"dialect" [and to some degree, regardless of word order: SVO ::  SOV].

as above....
