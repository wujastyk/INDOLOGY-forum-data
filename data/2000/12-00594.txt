Dearest Colleagues, I am eagerly looking for a lot of Sanskrit texts (with
or without a translation in a Western language) and, as usual, I have sent
my order to a number of Indian bookshops. On 13th December "Motilal
Banarsidass" and "Books & Periodical Agency" have written to me "ok", but,
afterwards, unfortunately, I don't have received no more any news. The
"Indian Books Centre" has not these texts; and "Biblia Impex" did not answer
a word. So, can someone give to me an advice?
Many thanks in advance and sorry for this annoyance.
Yours,
Daniela Rossella
