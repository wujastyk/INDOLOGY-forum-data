Would be interesting to know what a Negroid stock is? This is available
reference on them (not necessarily exhaustive)
Kurumba:-
Negroid tribe living in the Cardamom and Nilgiri hills, west-central Tamil
Nadu state, southern India. Originally a pastoral people

Also try
Mullukurumbas of Kappala by R Misra 1971, Vedam books,
Paniyans:-
Dr. N. Anil Kumar, ?Agrobiodiversitry conservation practices in the tribal
areas of Wayanad District, Kerala, India?
1. ?Paniyan, their physical features are, dark complexion, curly hair, flat
nose, thick lips, etc., very much resembling that of Negroid people?
2. ?Their language is a primitive dialect of Malayalam with an admixture of
Tamil and Tulu words?
Also try
Paniyan of Kerala by Kurup, A. M. and Roy Burman, B. K. Delhi, n.d. Census
of India 1961, Vol. I, India, Part V-B, Ethnographic Studies, No. 11.
Physical features dot not lead to obvious close genetic relationships. Just
because people have ?Negroid? features in Asia (there are many in many
countries including India) does not mean that they are closely related to
such people in Africa.
