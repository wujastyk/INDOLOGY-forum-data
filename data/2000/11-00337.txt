Arrangement of the INDOLOGY Digest
Dear Axel,
The kind of threaded presentation you want is available if you read
INDOLOGY from it's web archive.
David Salmon's suggestion about automatically sending messages to a
special folder is also excellent.  That's what I do myself.  Then I can
sort messages by subject, date, sender, etc., as I please.
