Regarding the Upanishads.- Conflicting logic of tenured              Indologists.

There is a key difference between the avirodha of gau.dapaada and the
"anything goes" purveyors of modern spirituality movements. The former says,
sva-siddhaanta vyavasthaasu dvaitino ni;scitaa d.r.dham |
parasparam virudhyante tair ayam na virudhyate ||
What is this "ayam" that does not enter into virodha? It is only advaita,
and specifically, gau.dapaada's ajaati vaada. This is a meta-creationist
view, and therefore does not come into conflict with any specific theory of
creation. However, gau.dapaada does acknowledge that the other views DO
conflict with one another.
Contrast this with some contemporary authors, who quote everyone under the
sun, in an apparently random fashion. Some of these people tell us that from
Buddha and the Upanishads down to Rajneesh and Timothy Leary, via Sankara
and Ramana and Aurobindo and Krishnamurti, everybody said the same thing.
They perhaps believe this themselves. What a far cry from the incisive
dialectic and penetrating insight of gau.dapaada.
