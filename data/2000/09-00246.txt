Henrique Henriques (1520-1600) (fwd)
Thanks, Dr. Karttunen, for the reply. I forward a portion of the reply
from an Indologist, may be useful. Another friend informed that
lot of info on Henriques is in the fine book, Tamil lexicography
by Gregory James.
Regards,

Harvard have 3 more books by him:
  HENRIQUES HENRIQUE 1520
1  antirikku atikalar iyarriya flos sanctorum/ 1967 bks
2  doctrina cristaa/ 1578 bks
3  first european tamil grammar a critical edition/ 1982 bks
4  retrato del perfecto medico/ 1900
the last one may have some interesting medical herbs
(like the c. 1600CE Latin Hortus Malabaricus from Kerala)
or Ayurveda info.
The first one deals with Christian saints.
