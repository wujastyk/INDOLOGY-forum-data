Kanchi Shankara Mutt
Hi. I have been observing the interaction of the members re. the Sringeri
and Kanchi Mutt matter. I understand that some of the members opine that
there is no record for Kanchi mutt to prove their existence prior to
1830AD.. I could collect some material in this regard from the modi
manuscripts. I invite u to contribute more on this subject. Those who feel
that the kanchi Mutt doesn't have any evidence, may post their findings..
Thanks
BGS
