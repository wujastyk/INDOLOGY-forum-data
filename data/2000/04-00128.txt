Monastic research
I am new to the list.  I was referred by another very nice subscriber who
cautioned me about the need for exactness, or face the consequences.  So
here goes...
I am researching several issues in the history of monasticism (especially
Dasanami Sannyasa).  Can anyone help with the following:
1) Sadananda Giri [Society and Sannyasin, First Edition, footnote on pg. 1]
refers to a "Vedic text" abbreviated "TMB." What does TMB stand for?
2) An English translation of Madhava's Commentary on Parasara's Dharma
Sastras (Paraasharamaadhaviiya) [I do not find Manmathanatha Dutt's edition
(printed by H. C. Das, Elysium Press, Calcutta, 1906) listed in Library of
Congress or Center for Research Libraries; I work regularly with
Inter-Library Loan but this may be too obscure for them].
3) Devanagari OCR software.
4) an email address for Dr. Munuganti Kripacharyulu (I believe in Guntur,
India).
