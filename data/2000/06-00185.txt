SOUTH ASIAN NARRATIVES IN FILM, LITERATURE, HISTORIOGRAPHY

The Society for the Humanities and the Asian Studies Department at Cornell
University invite applications for a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship for a
one year period beginning July 1, 2001.  Candidates should be engaged in
research projects on narratives in South Asian film, literature, and / or
historiography.  Candidates should also conduct at least part of their
research in one of the South Asian languages other than English. Some
preference will be given to scholars who rely on Bengali, Hindi-Urdu,
Nepali, Sinhala, and / or Sanskrit.

The fellowship offers a stipend of $30,000.  While in residence at
Cornell, postdoctoral fellows hold department affiliation, and have
limited teaching duties and the opportunity for scholarly work.

Candidates must have received the Ph.D. degree after September 1995.
Fellowships are limited to citizens of the United States, Canada, or
those with permanent U.S. residency cards.  All application materials,
