snake & mongoose in ancient India
At the AOS meeting in Baltimore (1999), Joshua Katz gave a paper on "How the
Mole Got his Name" [which probably has been published by now somewhere; does
anyone have his email address?], in which he dealt primarily with the word
aakh;u-, but also with other animal names like kaa;siik;aa- and your
nakul;a-.
    Reading his handout, I see that he emphasizes that we are dealing indeed
with Mongooses, NOT ichneumons. As for mongooses in India, he says that "we
find a number of kinds of mongoose (the word mongoose [and other spellings;
cf. Germ. Mungo] is a borrowing from Dravidian), including two species in
the north: Herpestes edwardsi (Common or Indian Grey Mongoose) and Herpestes
auropunctatus (Golden or Small Indian Mongoose). Katz refers to:
- Encyclopedia of Indian natural History 97; R.F. Ewer, The Carnivores
(Ithaca, NY 1973), 402f.; Walker's Mammals of the World (II.), 1043f.
He further refers to "hari.n;a-" as a name for Mongoose, with ref. to SW
Jamison, "The Ravenous Hyenas and the Wounded Sun", 59-61 and 87f (with ref.
to MS 3.9.3 tasmaad dhari.nam svaja.m khaadati). He adds many more
interesting bits of information, which I won't quote anymore, as they have
probably appeared in print somewhere already.
