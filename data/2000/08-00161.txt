I would suggest numerous passages in bRhadAraNyaka as a starting point, e.g.
11 rudras = 10 prANas in the human body + AtmA as the 11th; the discussion
of sAvitrI to be recited in the gAyatrI meter, not anushTubh, etc. Zankara's
commentary on brahmasUtra 2. 4. 5ff conveniently collects many such
references and discusses them in some detail. Also see surezvara's vArttika
on the pancIkaraNa text, where there is an extensive list of adhidaiva,
adhibhUta, adhyAtma correspondences. And then, muNDaka 2. 1. 8, where the
key number is 7.
