pseudo-chariot wheels, K. D. Sethna
Dr. Farmer,
The spoked wheels may point to Potter's wheels;
Potters are "vELAr", chiefs are "vEL".
Sangam texts on "puli-kaTi-mAl", the
Chalukyan king, Pulakesi/Pulikesi
and Indus seals with spoked and oblong pointed wheels
tell us of the possibility of vELs taking
symbols of spoked wheels. They have nothing to
do with chariots which were not invented then!
Thanks for pointing to Sethna's Ashram years.
More later,
N. Ganesan
