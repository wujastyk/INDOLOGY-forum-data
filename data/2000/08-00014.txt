Similes & Metaphors
I am sorry I have not previously mentioned this, but anyway, it
relies entirely on Chinese Buddhist sources--that is, in Chinese,
although the texts themselves are Indian (translations from Indic
texts):
Mori Shohji .  1988.  Bukkyoh Hiyu Reiwa Jiten  (Tokyo: Tohkyohdoh).
oh = long o
By the way, I ama total idiot about this, but my first attempt to
send this came back because "it contains an attachment of type
'TEXT/ENRICHED'."
How can I avoid this?  (I dont really care what it means if I just
know how not to do it)
