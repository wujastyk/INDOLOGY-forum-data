Dear Indologists,

In Dravidian languages, the word
for iron (=tam. irumpu) derives from
words for "night/darkness/black".

DED 2102 Ta. "iravu, ira, irA, rA" night;
"iru" black; "iruTci, iruTTu, iruNmai, irumai"
darkness; "iruL" darkness, dark color, ignorance
... Ka. "iruL, iraLu, iraTu, irLu" night;
"iddal, ijjalu" charcoal....
Te. "irulu" darkness, shades, shadows;
"irulu konu" to become dark or obscure;
"rEyi" night

DED 411 Ta. "irumpu" iron, instrument, weapon.
Ma. "irumpu, irimpu" iron. Te "inumu" iron.

Given that the IA languages use zyaama- or
kRSNa- ayas when iron gets attested in YV, AV
etc., and South India has a major role in
iron technology (eg., steel), Is the name
of iron as zyaama or krsna coming from the southern
tradtion?

In other words, zyaama/krishna (OIA) and irumpu (tamil)
for iron restricted to Indian subcontinent?

What was iron called in Mesopotamia and the Near East?

Thanks for comments,
SM
