Bizarre. I might not agree with what Dominik wrote, but I can see no trace
whatever of racial prejudice or hate-mongering in it.

I don't think I can be bothered to subscribe to Indology any more: with
honourable exceptions -- including many Indian contributors, but not
including Tarek Wani -- it has degenerated into an endless sequence of
flamewars on topics that are of little interest to me as a fairly
mainstream Indologist with interests in both ancient and modern India.
What a pity.
