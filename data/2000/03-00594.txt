Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat

The Sanskrit Language: an Overview.  History and Structure, Linguistic and
        Philosophical Representations, Uses and Users.

Translated from the French by T. K. Gopalan.

Indica Books, D 40/18 Godowlia, Varanasi 221 001, UP, India.  2000.

ISBN 81-86569-17-0.

A perfect book for any Skt undergraduate.  Wish I'd had it as a
student.  Also excellent for anyone interested in the intellectual
traditions of classical India, including its social aspects.

Formerly in the "Que sais-je?" series.
