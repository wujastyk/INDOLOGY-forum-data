Studies on present-day Hindus
Dear Indologists,
I need your help to elucidate a question. The indology so far has
concentrated on " Hinduism " " Hindu texts " " Casts " " sects "  and other
Hindu institutions. But Hindus themselves have not been often objet of its
study. It seems that indology is interested more in things than in persons.
Are there studies of Hindus comparable to subjects in Christianity like "
Roman Catholics " " Lutherans " " Orthodox "  Christians ?.  I mean studying
Hindus of India, their religious identity, categories of religious
affiliation, varieties of normal (not sectarian) hindu religious groups... I
would be thankful for comments. Greetings.
