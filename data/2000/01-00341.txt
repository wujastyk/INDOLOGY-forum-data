u.s.tra-dhuumaka (was: Skt vocabulary for: Hail)
Kindly compare go-dhuuli, the dust stirred up by the cattle when they
return from grazing at night. I have ridden camels in the desert on a
number of occasions, and never found them surrounded by noxious insects (I
don't know if they would attract them in moister climates, but camels tend
to be used in arid areas). However a string of camels in a caravan does
stir up drifting dust or sand. The question arises whether dust (dhuuli)
and smoke (dhuumaka) could be equated.
With best wishes,
