There is perhaps no way to be sure of the chronological
sequence, but what are the sources that suggest
- definite early/late bounds
- likely dates
for the two books?
Also, I am curious about available manuscripts of
the thirukkuRaL and if they have been critically
compared.
I have heard about some shlokas of Gita that are
not found in the common version. Does anyone have
those?
