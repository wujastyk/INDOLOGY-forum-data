You misconstrue the meaning of "opposite" in Shrisha's post. Vyasatirtha is
not interested in proving to the naiyyAyika that a creator cannot be
logically denied. No nyAya philosopher presents the denial of a creator as a
pUrvapaksha in the first place. What Vyasatirtha is saying is that the nyAya
argument does not really prove that the creator is one omnipotent,
omniscient being. Using the same structure of nyAya arguments, one could
also make an inference that there is ultimately no one creator. One could
also make an inference that there are multiple creators. The status of the
"author of the Vedas" then becomes even more problematic for the naiyyAyika.
