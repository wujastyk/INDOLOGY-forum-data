Well, the list appears to have been over-run once again by the hate-mongers.
Scholarship will survive this, of course, and so will the list, I trust.  But
as a student of Indology, I am fearful about the state of intellectual
discourse in India these days, if it continues to be dominated by hate-filled
voices like these.
