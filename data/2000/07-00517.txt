Did the Aryans invade India?
Suppose the answer is no. Then does it automatically follow that India is the original habitat of the Aryans?
The answer must be an emphatic NO.
Very often the two questions are seen as two sides of a coin, which they are not. It is iimportant to address these questions separately
