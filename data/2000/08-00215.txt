The "Net of Indra"
Dear Stephen,
All I said was 'not proven' !
It has often been suggested that the Avata.msaka collection was
created in Central Asia. In fact the collection includes at least two
very large texts of Sanskrit and presumably 'Indian' origin. But no
Indian source, as far as I know, refers to the collection. Some of
the smaller texts might have a lost Indian original. Some of them
could have been composed in Central Asia. Conceivably they could have
been written there in Sanskrit or in some other language. But none of
this seems very certain; so I simply said 'not proven to be of Indian
origin'.
I do not know sufficient about the Tibetan version. I have seen you
mention this before, but I do not know why older scholarship did not
accept this. Assuming that it is not from one of the extant Chinese
versions (as I had earlier understood) how do we know that it is not
translated from a Central Asian or lost Chinese original ?
