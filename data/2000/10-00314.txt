There were a couple of small errors in Raveen Satukurunathan's useful
bibliographic list, which may delay people in locating the books:

S. S. Misra's book is Ethnic Conflict and Security Crisis in Sri
Lanka, not Ethnicity, Conflict....

Manogaran and Paffenberger's is The Sri Lankan Tamils..., not The Sri
Lanka Tamils.


(No, I don't suspiciously check out everyone's citations to trip them
up; I was just making sure we had everything.)

Sincerely,

Allen Thrasher
