Tenure Track Position in Hinduism
University of Canterbury, Christchurch

Applications are invited from persons with primary expertise in the Hindu
tradition for the tenured position of Lecturer or Senior Lecturer
(equivalent to US Assistant Professor or Associate Professor) in Religious
Studies, an independent programme within the Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies. The minimum qualification on appointment is the Ph.D.
degree or equivalent. The appointment is to commence on 1 January 2001 or
as soon as possible thereafter.

The appointee must be able to teach courses in Hinduism from introductory
to postgraduate level.  The ability to teach more widely in Asian Religions
at the introductory level would also be an advantage.  While the area of
research specialisation is open, applications are particularly welcome from
candidates with a background in classical Indian Studies or Indology.
Competence in Sanskrit and/or a modern Indian language is highly desirable,
since it is hoped that the successful candidate might contribute to the
Sanskrit courses currently offered.  An interest in religion and gender
could also be advantageous.

Full details available: s.findlay at regy.canterbury.ac.nz.  Further
information about the Department at http://www.rels.canterbury.ac.nz.

I would also like to take this opportunity to announce that the University
of Canterbury is acquiring the personal library of the late Professor Jan
Willem de Jong. This means that our existing collection, which is already
reasonably strong in Eastern religions and South Asian anthropology, will
soon be augmented by over 12,000 volumes in the areas of Buddhist Studies,
Indology, Tibetan Studies, Mongolian Studies and related areas, as well as
Professor de Jong's personal papers. Prospective applicants for the above
position may find this of some interest.
