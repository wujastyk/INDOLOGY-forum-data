Is not almost whole of RigVeda "esoteric" ?
WHat is the meaning of "fire"? and "oblations"? What does "grass" mean?
Do'nt you think INDOLOGISTs are making the same mistake as those who tried to
define the Botanical name for Somavalli and tried to search it out on face of
the Earth somewhere?
I think by ritual you mean a Yajna. But what is a  "Yanja"? Is it simply a fire
sacrifice? (i.e. offering some au.sadhi in a physical fire? Are you sure that
was the intended meaning/action?
I am aware of these. I remeber here a story which I raed a few years back (and
auther assured it is based on a true event) Please do take two minutes to read
it :
"
It seems an expedition group travelled in dense jungles of South America in
search of Gold. There they had taken modern weapons like rifles,
machine-guns,etc. Eventually, these people got killed (due to reasons not of our
interest). The aborigins living in the jungle, tried to use the weapons, but
they did not know how to, but they were well impressed by their efficassy, so
they constructed fake guns from bamboo sticks and black colour. At their social
gatherings (like marriages) they "fired" these "guns" by pointing them to sky
and striking heavily on their drums. They some how thought that they will
achieve the same effect as the original guns of the expeditionary group. This
belief was strengthened occassionally by an animal that they could catch due to
its confusion.
"
Let me be clear that I do not say that the ritual (the Yajna with physical fire)
are wrong or totally useless. They are limited and not the original  major
intent of RigVeda.
Incidently I am a pukka Brahmin, doing Sandhya two times a day.
(I read in a later posting by GT that he uses the name diirghatamasin, I really
liked that. But what is the etymology  and meaning of the word  *diirghatamas*)
Best wishes,
