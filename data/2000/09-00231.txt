Dear list members,

In going thru a reprint of "Hindu Holidays and Ceremonials" by B.A. Gupte ,
1916 I've come across something perplexing.  He lists Shivaratri as the 13th
of the month, and Mahashivaratri as the 13th of Magha both in his index and
the text of the article itself.  Is there any possible reason other than
error why he would list shivaratri as the 13th and not the 14th?

On the title page it notes that he was Assistant Director of Ethnography for
India so it seems strange that he would make such a simple error.

Many thanks,
