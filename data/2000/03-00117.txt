Queries: Diwali
As I recall, P.K. Gode has an article on the antiquity of Diwali. Please
check the volumes of his collected writings: (a) Studies in Indian Literary
History, Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. (b) Studies in Indian Cultural
History, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.
Another possibility: Raghavan, V. 1979. Festivals, Sports and Pastimes of
India. Ahmedabad: B. J. Institute of Learning and Research.
