further with neologisms.   From what I have seen, there is already a
perfectly good term used in the tantras and elsewhere -- "jina".  I
also believe that the term was modelled on terms like the "yoga /
yogi" pair and so does not mean "meditation Buddha" as many would have
it.  Anyway, are the jinas or dhyaani Buddhas actually abiding in
dhyaana when they are in the mandalas ?   Just a quibble, but would it
not be more accurate to call them samaadhi buddhas IF that is what
they are doing ?  In my own limited reading of texts, I have never
come across any mention of Buddhas engaging in dhyaana and, in my
understanding, there is a qualitative difference between dhyaana and
samaadhi.   Still, some people seem very attached to the term so I am
probably fighting a lost cause -- looks like heuristic neologisms win
out over terminological accuracy.

Best wishes,
