The Caitanya Caritamrta is an early seventeenth-century Bengali and
Sanskrit biography of the great saint and Vaisnava leader Caitanya
(1486-1533 C.E.), by the poet and scholar Krsnadasa, who has been given by
Bengali tradition the title Kaviraja "Prince of Poets." The text is of
interest to theologians (Caitanya was, in Krsnadasa's view, an androgyne of
Krsna and Radha), philosophers (his theory was that aesthetic and religious
experience are much the same in kind), historians of religion (the movement
that Caitanya inspired has encompassed the great part of the eastern Indian
subcontinent, and Krsnadasa has some interesting observations on his own
times), and appreciators of literature (in Krsnadasa's very long poem are
embedded some lyric gems).

Edward C. Dimock, Jr., is Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus,
University of Chicago. Tony K. Stewart is Associate Professor of South
Asian Religions at North Carolina State University and Director of the
North Carolina Center for South Asia Studies.
