Buddhist Goddess Identification
Could any of the list members kindly help me out to
precisely identify the apparent Mahayanic Buddhist
Goddess sculpture, and to transcribe and translate its
very short stone-hewn Sanskrit inscription? I intend
to use the photo in an upcoming publication. Up to now
no one has been able to make heads or tails of the
inscription. I have uploaded the photographic
reproduction (JEPG format) for easy access.
