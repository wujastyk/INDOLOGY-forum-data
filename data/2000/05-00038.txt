Subject: Buddhist Goddess Identification
Message-ID: <161227058310.23782.10588745200176119999.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Could any of the list members kindly help me out to
precisely identify the apparent Mahayanic Buddhist
Goddess sculpture, and to transcribe and translate its
very short stone-hewn Sanskrit inscription? I intend
to use the photo in an upcoming publication. Up to now
no one has been able to make heads or tails of the
inscription. I have uploaded the photographic
reproduction (JEPG format) for easy access.
