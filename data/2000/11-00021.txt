Endo and Exo
Classification can be a valuable excercise. ..like the periodic table
of elements. taxonomical classification, or phonological classication
as is done to some exent in indic alphbets. But what purpose
does "endo and exo" serve.
I agree that a neutral external observer can make valuable and
essential contributions and is needed to balance other views but then
we should not go too far with this sort of (endo-exo) stereo typing
Scolars in Humanities revel in this sort of back and forth discussion
hemming and hawing over who is in who is not and so forth..... a not
so important distinction.
One wishes that they put their mids to better things like coming up
with a mathematical frame work for linguistics studies.
Also most indologists are not so neutral to start with. What is
needed are more people like edwyn bryant.
