On the name Pitchumani
Dear Listmembers,
What is the traditional understanding of the Tamil name Pitchumani? Does it
originate simply from bhikSa? Does anybody relate it to ziva at all? I
believe Srivaishnavites also have that name. Do they have a different
understanding of the name? Thanks in advance.
Regards
