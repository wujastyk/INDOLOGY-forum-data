Subject: On the name Pitchumani
Message-ID: <161227065626.23782.3239494412556444742.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Listmembers,

What is the traditional understanding of the Tamil name Pitchumani? Does it
originate simply from bhikSa? Does anybody relate it to ziva at all? I
believe Srivaishnavites also have that name. Do they have a different
understanding of the name? Thanks in advance.

Regards
