I am willing to accept this explanation. Then the situation is close to
Vedic and later Hindu attitudes. Brahminical attitude is also ritual
oriented and ritual purity oriented from the earliest days. Even a few
decades back, a brahmin with a dark skin (darker than many Afro-americans)
would not like to ritually polluted by the touch of much fairer looking
Muslims of say Persian origin or for that matter the British rulers. As
long the rulers kept to themselves socially (which is what the British did)
and not ritually pollute them, it was immaterial who the ruler was or how
they came to rule them.
Notwithstanding the above agreement, I am not wholly convinced by the
following
Both Jews and Nubians were subject (and slave) races in Egypt. Many times,
the oppressed minorities ( or majorities even) internalise the rulers'
disdain and prejudice for each other rather than gang up against the ruler.
One prejudice against certain populations develope, it may continue
irrespective of changes in political fortunes. Hence , by the time of
redactions of 445BCE, the prejudices aquired more than 700 years back
(against Nubians) in Egyptian exile may still be continuing, irrespective
of the changes in political fortunes in that period. Again , this is only
speculation which you are free to disregard

Because of the context in which it was written originally, I wanted to be
sure of dates of usage of the catch phrases 'saivam and vainavam'. My
admittedly limited searches did not find these words much older Tamil
literature.
