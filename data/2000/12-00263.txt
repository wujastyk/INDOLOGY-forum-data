nAraNa_n, the tamil word for nArAyaNa (was: Vishnu)
Thanks, Ganesan. This has been educative, but I couldn't find
naalikam in the online Tamil lexicon, at
http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/otl_search.html.
nAL, nAl, nal etc. were listed, but nothing turned up under the
spellings naalika, naalaka, nAlaka, nAlika, nor under the same
entries with the letter m added at the end.
I think it is right to derive it from Dravidian roots. Emeneau
and Gowda do cite Burnell and Cowell. But perhaps, it is not
right to link -aNa to -aNNa as in elder brother?
The only problem is that k/c => z does not explain s in
the name sAyaNa, which was never written as zAyaNa.
Best regards,
Vidyasankar
