Bibliographic references
Dear members of Indology!
I am embarking on a small research project concerning the Skt absolutive
(gerund). I would greatly appreciate any bibliographic references to
papers/books treating this subject that have been published during the last
5 years.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
