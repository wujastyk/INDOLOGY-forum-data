Regarding Kalidasa and Panchatantra
Hello.
Greetings.
I am a history teacher and most recently as I was teaching Indian history to
my class, I realised that
the textbook mentions the panchatantra being composed by Kalidasa. Is this
factual and correct ?
What we know is that Kalidasa wrote Shakuntala and Kumara Sambhava. But his
writing panchatantra
does not seem to be correct. Could someone confirm the validity of this
statement ?!
We know that the panchatantra was popularised during the Gupta period. But
did the panchatantra emerge only then
or did it exist even before but was merely codified during this period ?
Thanks in advance,
