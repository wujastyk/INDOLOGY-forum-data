Black and Bright and Beautiful
SA says:
Also, Gupta statues generally depict the Buddha with thick lips, wide
nose and curly hair; likewise I have made a rough count and found that
most icons even of this late period seem to be of Dravidians.

have you considered that the statues look unreal in the first place and are
stylizations. No race on earth can be identified usiing such statues.
Only aliens can have such eyes.
Curly hair might have been considered fashonable by sculptorers. full lips
have always been deemed as desirable. realism was not in vogue.
Some buddha statues make buddha look feminine. Does that mean he was a girl.
Many caucasians have curly hair too. greek statues show a lot of curly hair,
but all greeks dont have curly hair.  gandhara art shows greek influence and
curly hair too.
sculptures in mahabalipuram are somewhat realistic a better picture can be
got from those.
