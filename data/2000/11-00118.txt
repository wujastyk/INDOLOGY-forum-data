more on Hurrite/IA
continued:
MW:
Yaroslav Vassilkov:
participants in the raid had to be mentioned in order to give nobody a
pretext for breaking  the treaty. Could not the appearance of OIA names
(among Hurrian ones) in Near Eastern treaties be due to similar reasons?<<
Agreed. NB the oath of those fighting for Ludwig/Louis?, grandson? of
Charlemagne was read out to all and sworn before battle both in Old French
and Old High German... just to make sure that all were bound to it...
Certainly, though not at the *universal* level as Varuna, but on a tribal
level, and that can of course be reconstructed for IIr. (Mitra/Mithra).
cf. latest,  Brereton, J. P.  1981. The Rgvedic Adityas. New Haven.
(IIr., just like Aryaman/Airiiaman, and Bhaga / Baga > O.Slav. bog-).
===============================================================
Finally,
Subrahmanya:
who puts a lot of new questions, but doesn't answer the one why there can
be about pre-Rgvedic words in Mitanni, which he started out with.
We may agree with  Rajesh Kocchar:
The moral is:While reading other people's posting.look for a nugget of
wisdom,not for impurity.<<
However, just occasionally we should expect, instead of spit and run, some
answers. So, what to do with clearly wrong statements and just more and
more  questions such as :
Long before 400 BCE, the Brahmana texts (and AV 15) are in the *colloquial*
speech of the educated Brahmins (different from the "dialect" of the gods
the same Brahmins use inthe same Brahman texts when they make the gods
speak --not just in Mantras!--, but also that of women, and others).
Nobody says that. RV jyotis, if maintained, or Panini's word for 'drink'
(mayira?, cannot remember) are the proof. (see B. Oguibenine's post).
to just MIA
who says so? Even in India, v > b is typical only for the more eastern
languages, while the more western ones keep v, from Kashmiri to Marathi.
?? which language does not change?
?? There is no 'natural sound change'. Differs per language, timeframe,
region etc etc,
This confuses the development from OIA > MIA with that from MIA  > NIA
Meter? ok. We know about prosodic changes in MIA, see Pischel's Pkt gramar
etc etc
Why not Hattic, Hittite, Homeric or Eskimo? :-)
