Vidyasankar is right.
It can be corroborated by checking UVS Iyer's "piRkAlap pulavarkaL" ("latter
day poets")
where you can find many names such as "kandappa iyer" which would surprise
Tamils of today, "country"  names like that having been stereotyped as not
favored by non-brahmins.
That makes one wonder what exactly changed in the society for such a major
shift in naming policy among brahmins; of course non-brahmin Tamils also have
completely abandoned the same collection of  "traditional" names.
It could be that brahmin Tamils started that process early this century and
non-brahmins simply followed them.
After all the brahmin Subramanya Bharathi's wife was named "Chellamma" which
today is unthinkable as a female brahmin name.
