Re: Kinship systems
Many of the Gond language may have many similarities with Tamil or Kannada,
but it does not say about how Gonds view themselves nor does it say anything
about Gonds themselves
You are making a massive mistake by confusing language or more to the point
a "language family" - a linguistic construction- with a human community.
