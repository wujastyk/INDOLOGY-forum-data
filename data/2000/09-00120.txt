Isolated finds of iron are as early as 1400 BC.

http://www.rediff.com/news/jan/23iron.htm is just an example beware of type
errors .

Its use is not widespread till 800 - 900 BC for a very good reason, its the
onset of urbanization and increased demand and not anatolian influence.

The iron usage in pattern in sri lanka could be used as a bench mark, as it
must have been relatively isolated.

By 300 BC wootz was being exported from india to rome and west asia.

Traditionally till british times a large amount of iron work was done by
tribals.
