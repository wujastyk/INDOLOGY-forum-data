Well, I agree with the general point here.  Both Lueders and Brown recognized
that the satyakriyA, though itself a term unattested in Vedic, was a concept
and a practice that was well-known in Vedic.  But I also think that there is
an important difference between them.
In the article cited by Carlos Lopez I argued that the view of Lueders is
that the satyakriyA is magical, whereas the view of Brown is that it is
ethical.  Furthermore, I argued that the view of Lueders is more accurate
than Brown's, who I think was susceptible to a certain amount of
anachronistic interpretation of Vedic texts in this context.
For example, I do not think that RV 10.34, the famous hymn of the gambler,
represents a satyakriyA at all [pace Brown].  No, in my view the speech act
which we encounter in this hymn is an oath, not a satyakriyA, which in my
view is a 'magical performative.'
Well, in general, the point of my article was to suggest that it would be
good to carefully consider the difference between various speech-acts
encountered in Vedic,  such as oaths. vows, curses, confessions, ordeals, or
boasts -- and satyakriyAs.  In order to encourage such careful
discriminations I resorted to speech-act theory.
In any case, I have found the position of Lueders much stronger than that of
Brown.
