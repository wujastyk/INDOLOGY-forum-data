There are other reasons for all this, which I won't get into here. My paper
on the Sankaravijaya texts discusses this controversy in painful detail. Do
wait till the IJHS (International Journal of Hindu Studies) resumes
publication. And I would not second-guess attitudes either. Fights between
brothers or cousins are often more ferocious than those between mere
neighbours or strangers. And just for argument's sake, how about giving some
credit to the possibility that maybe one was established by Sankara, and
another came later?

Does not follow. One can distinguish between the official list of heads of a
matha and the actual Guru-Sishya lineage of its current mathadhipatis. See
my article on the Jyotirmath succession on the Indology website. This
becomes a rather emotional issue for most people, but the genealogical
records of the Kanchi matha are refuted by independent evidence even for the
17th and 18th centuries, i.e. less than 400 years ago. And of course, its
claim that Sankara lived in the 5th century BC can be easily rejected. But
that opens up a whole new can of worms in Indian history.
