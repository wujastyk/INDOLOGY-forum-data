"Dalitstan" (RE: 'INDIA ABROAD' on new textbooks)

Dalits are indeed involved, although the funding may come from

There is a sort of 'pan-Black' movement inspired in part by African
Americans and particularly Runoko Rashidi. It seeks the liberation or
upliftment of "Black" people worldwide to include the Sudras, Dalits
and Dravidians of India, the Melanesians, the Negritos, the Australians,
etc.
Mr. Rashidi told me that he goes to India every few years to meet
with Dalit organizations there.
