SamnyAsin names
Nanda Candran asked:
Indian
Other popular second elements in Buddhist "dharma names" include:
-sena, -mitra, -gupta, -bhadra, -deva, -bodhi, -mati, -paala
and -rak.sita.
I believe that certain second elements were preferred by different
Buddhist schools in India. There may also have been the custom, still
extant in East Asia, of using a element of one's preceptor's/teacher's
name to make up one's name.   This was certainly the case when I was a
monk in Japan whence in got the name (converted into Skt)
"Vajra-vardhana-bhadra".
Best wishes,
