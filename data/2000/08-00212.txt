Democracy in old India
I have read UttaramErUr inscriptions of the Chola period a while
ago. In those, an election process of casting votes in an earthen
pot to get elected as a member of the governing council of a grAmam
is described. Especially, the qualifications to be a candidate
for a public office in great details.
Is this Chola period democratic process recorded anywhere else
in old India? Thanks for any references where these are discussed,
Chola or other medieval dynasties.
