All this has not prevented dravidian political circles lambasting Kamban as
"Ariya adi varudi" which literally means one who massages  aryan feet.
Dravidian political circles have never forgiven Kamban for making a master
kavya on Rama and spread aryanism in Tamilnadu

Like the DMK election posters when Kamaraj was alive, he was called
'Appirikka azhage' in a snide and depracating way. Kamaraj was black, but
the Dravida political parties used to downgrade him as 'African beauty'?

Or like the big cut-outs along the Anna Salai in Madras, where even people
like Mooppanar have rosy cheeks and their faces 'whited out' so that they
are saleable electorally to the Tamil population?

After the glorious  liberation from the clutches of Vedas and Brahmins in
the 20th cenuiry, the "Dravidians" do identical colour racism which anyone
can notice without the dark glass of Sanskritists or the bright gloss of the
Tamilists
