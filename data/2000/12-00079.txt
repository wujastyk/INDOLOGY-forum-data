Questions about non-Tamil Jain, Buddhist and Ajivika beliefs
Dear list members,
I would appreciate information from non-Tamil sources on the following
questions.
1.What did the Jains (2000-1500 years ago) believe  regarding the karmic
reward for butchers, hunters, sacrificing priests, prostitutes, and
meat-eaters?
2.What did the Buddhists believe (2000-1500 years ago) believe  regarding the
karmic reward for butchers, hunters, sacrificing priests, prostitutes, and
meat-eaters?
3. Were the Ajivikas' beliefs different from the above?
Thanks in advance.
Regards
