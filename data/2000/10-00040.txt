kuRuntokai 22
wrote:
Well, his kuRuntokai viLakkam (kv) which contains the
urai for the first 111 verses was published by
Annamalai U in 1983. It contains a foreword by A.
citamparanAta ceTTiyAr which is basically a review of
the entire commentary.
Sri ceTTiyAr does say in his foreword that this is an
outgrowth of rA. rAkavaiyaGkAr's lectures at Annamalai
U on the kuRuntokai and has *the U Ve Ca urai" as the
basis text.
The commentary to this verse in the kv is brief. For
the most part, it dwells on the usage "cAraRcilampu",
quoting paripATal 6 and tiruvAymozi 3.3.9.
But it does have the line "kaNNiRku ayalatAya nutal
utan celaviR kamazum enRatanAl kaNkaL mikak kaLittal
kuRittAL" and some more extra poetic statements.
So I don't know if that's a traditional understanding
or if the kv is influenced by the u Ve Ca commentary.
I was (and am still) under the impression that this
kind of ascription of real life (and real time!)
effects to poems was a late medieval tendency. For
example stories of Kampan, auvaiyar etc have this
element in them.
Thanks and Warm Regards,
