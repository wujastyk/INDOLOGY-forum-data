This distinction between race and ethnos is fine. But to call Gonds
dravidian in an ethnic sene is also a stretch. After all Gonds themselves
call themselves Gonds and the word 'dravidian' is unknown to them. Hence
ethnicity of Gonds is just Gond and not dravidian. It is not for non-Gonds
to put different labels on them
