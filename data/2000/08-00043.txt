At this point - yes, I would call it a mistake, I dont know
Dr.Rajram's side and I havent read the book yet.

Also, coming to translations - Like I previously asked,
what if a scholar inserts non existent meanings into a text ?

There are many eminent objective scholars on this list - I am sure
that they might have some examples.
I look forward to seeing them. Thanks in advance.
