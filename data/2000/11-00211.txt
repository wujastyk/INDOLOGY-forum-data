dermato-racism
While it may be difficult to establish unequivocally whether in ancient India
skin-color consciousness in racist terms existed or not (perhaps some groups
had it, others did not), it will be difficult to argue that among present days
Indians there is no dermatochromatic racist attitudes whatever.
