Rising of the sea and other Migration myths
On Konrad's post about the rising sea levels, I am slowly working on a
book project entitled "The Churning of the Milky Ocean."
The book is meant for general audiences and deals, among other things,
with various origin traditions linked with the Milky Ocean, which by all
accounts I'm aware of is located to the east.
Here is an outline of the first four chapters:
Chapter I - The Milky Ocean
Begins with the popular Indian myth of the battle between the Devas and
Asuras for the nectar known as amrita. Explains how this appears to be a
reference to a natural disaster that resulted in mass migration.
Examples are given of how myths and legends are often history altered
for the purpose of story-telling.
Chapter II - The Language Trail
This chapter will delve into the linguistic clues provided by the
proposed Austric language family. The author offers a radical new
language relationship theory based on original research. Explained in a
style that will be easy for the average reader to comprehend.
