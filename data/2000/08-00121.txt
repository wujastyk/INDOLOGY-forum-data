To all those involved in the venerable public service of advertising
chauvinistic web-sites (indeed,  a truly motley crowd of honest-to-God
Indologists, "border-line Indologists",  chauvinists,  rabble-rousers),

could you please pass my message onto the HVK folks that I cannot be party to
their organization because I am pissed off by their spelling of "viveka" as
"vivek".

Thanks to everyone of you,  from the heart of my bottom.

ps:  What ya pity,  yas ya Brahmin,  I could hyave been ya key player in this
august yinstitution  (proof lies in non-Euclidean thinking),  believing in 70
centuries of Brahmanical contribution and more (proof:  not to be found in my
Sanskritic heritage,  but in my maRa-Tamizh heritage of 4400+3700+1750 years.)
