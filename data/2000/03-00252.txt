quotation?
I was told by someone (author of A historical study of the Brahmin
community) that it is the second line of
hastinaa taaDyamaanopi na gachchhejjainamandiram
yaavaniim is obviously Farsi. He did not know who
composed this shloka, but he thought that he must not have
been anyone significant.

Thanks for any suggestions.
