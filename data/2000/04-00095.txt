snake & mongoose in ancient India
I really do not want to make a big deal out of this, and it does not
affect me personally at all, but maybe we should reflect on this for
a moment as a community.
In reply to Birgit's interesting mongoose question Arlo Griffiths
quotes a handout from an AOS meeting of a talk given by Joshua Katz,
admitting that he is not in touch with the latter, the author whom he
quotes. Is this permissable? If Dr Katz himself provides us
information, that is one thing, and if he has published certainly his
material is in the public domain, but had we not rather be careful
about quoting things like handouts for talks?
