Horseplay in Harappa
There is now a second fast download site for "Horseplay in
Harappa: The Indus Valley Decipherment Hoax." The article is the
cover story in the most recent edition of FRONTLINE, the India
news magazine. As in Michael Witzel's site, the editorial on our
story by Romila Thapar will also be available from the site given
below in the next few days.

The same material is also available from Michael's site at:
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/FRONTLINE.htm
Within a few days (the new edition isn't posted yet) the article
will also be directly available in *both* HTML and PDF formats,
permanently archived, from:
http://www.frontlineonline.com
The Hindutva polemics in India over the article are already
getting heated and nasty, as we expected. The upshot is that the
article is apparently having its effect.
My best,
Steve Farmer
