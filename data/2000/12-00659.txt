Dravidian origins
I must remind Dr.Zydenbos, that while India remains a poor
place (because of massive orderly looting by europeans), it
remains democratic and has taken great steps in breaking bonds
that hold back dalits. Even the priesthood is not the sole
prerogative of any one group now. In addition to the head of
state,the leader of the major ruling political party in India
is a dalit.
No country in Europe can claim having minorities or
the underclass as heads of state or occupying positions of power.
It must also be pointed out that Europeans
have conducted the most horrific crimes ever and eliminated
entire civilizations. No amount  of loud speaking can cover it up.
Europe still has the greatest amount of racist attacks and
killings.
Compared to that the incidents in India are much less.
Remember India has almost 2.5 to 3  times more population and
many times poorer
While Europe may have many good admirable things. Academic
prejudice and using old ideas to reinforce euro supremacist
notions is present in Europe. Recognizing some of such weaknesses
is definitely a sign of overall academic strength. Some of our
friends on this list have not yet realized that.
