On the name Pitchumani
I haven't seen it related to S'iva at all (perhaps you are thinking of the
bhikSATana-mUrti motif)... it is merely to ward off evil in general that a
child is given this name,  and in particular a child is given this name when
the parents have lost their earlier children somehow.
