Subject: Hindu roots of Vesak Festivals?

The month of Vis'Akha is so called because its full moon (i.e. opposition
to the sun) occurs in or near the nakSatra (lunar mansion) of Vis'AkhA.
"Vis'AkhA", whose name means "branching in different directions", is ruled
jointly by Indra and Agni--an appropriate constellation, perhaps, for the
birth of the future Buddha, who had to make a choice between the life of a
king (Indra) and that of a renouncer (Agni).

This symbolism seems to be quite ancient: the list of gods named as rulers
of lunar mansions seems characteristic of the Vedic and UpaniSadic periods
rather than of later developments in Hinduism.
