putra
Dr: Deshpande:
...
There is a Tamil word "puttEL" (DEDR# 4275) listed  under the sense of Ta. putu
 = new...;
putiyar = new person(s), guest;
puttan2 = new person or thing;
...etc.
it means as per DEDR
"novelty, stranger, strange woman; god".
The phrases "puttEL ulaku" ("the world of gods" or "the world of novelty") and
"puttEL nADu" ("the country/place of gods")
is also employed to denote the heaven.
The CT maturaik kAJci says
at line# 698
"puttEL ulakam kavin2ik kANvara"
it for exemplary beauty".."
tirukkuRaL: 1323:
"...pulattalin2 puttEL nADu uNDO?"
Now consulting the Madras Tamil Lexicon weighs in favor of Mr. Iyer's
conjectures as the lexicon does indeed ask the reader to confer the following
Tamil/Skt pairs:
Ta. putalvan - Skt. puttra
Ta. puttEL - Skt. puttala.
Is it possible that the Skt. "put-"/"puttala" itself got its other-worldly
 association specifically regarding progeny from the Tamil roots?
i.e. the hell was  called "put-" because it is a kind of "puttEL"
(generalizeable from heaven to hell) where those who die without "putalvan"
(son) go to?
