    Hello Dan,
    thanks for the reply, the IE on windows combination works fine as you saw and the Bitstream Font player downloads onto both Mac and Windows platforms ok. 

    I tried the meta tag 

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
    but at the moment it did not solve the Mac platform problem

    Its easter break now so I am off the thing for a few days but my most recent observation was that it was also influenced by whether the font was "Western" or "Symbol" character sets and this influenced the effect of the utf-8 encoding.

    I will try and sort this out more next week,

    thanks again
