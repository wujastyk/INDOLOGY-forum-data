The chanting book agrees with my description of tape A's realization of
anusvAra before sibilants, r and h in my posting of Feb. 7.  I.e. it writes
gum (not ghuM)in all cases.  It also agrees with the two exceptions to the
above on the tape (the one case where the tape has [gim] it writes gim and
the one case of where the tape has [gUm] it writes gUm.
