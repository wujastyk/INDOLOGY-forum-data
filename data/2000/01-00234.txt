History of indian cooking (RE: Etymology: sambar, the dish?)
I heard an interesting story I heard from Mr.
Nagarajan, a retired IAS officer who comes from a
family of smartha deshastha brahmins settled in
Thanjavur and who runs a small math originally
stablished by Samarth Ramadas in Thanjavur. According
to him Sambar, was coined after the Maratha prince
Sambhaji who invented(?) the dish from the tamil
kuzhambu. May I dont remember the invented part
correctly but his account did connect Sambar to
Sambhaji!
