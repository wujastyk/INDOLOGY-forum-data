Black and Bright and Beautiful
According to my English-Tibetan dictionary, the modern Tibetan word for
green is ljang-khu (colour of flag), or sngon-po (colour of grass). Green
vegetables are called sngo-tshal (Lhasa-pronunciation: ngoptsee). There are
also, however:
ljang-smug or ljang-nag = dark green
ljang-dkar or ljang-skya = light green
ljang se = yellowish green
But "blue" is also sngon-po, so Tibetan may not feel the need to
distinguish between these two colours. If something is "completely blue",
whatever that is, Tibetans would say it is "sngo mthing-mthing". I might
add that sometimes when I say something is "blue", my daughter corrects me,
asserting that I am unable to distinguish between blue and green. What is
blue to me, is apparently green to her.
Best wishes,
