>A patron has asked about the source of "a folk-tale from India where
>in a marriage alliance, a girl was passed off as a boy and she was
>saved by a tiger at the moment where it was about to be discovered
>that she was a girl. Eventually her sex was changed into a boy and the
>tale ends well."  I am referring her to Stith Thompson's Motif index
>of folk literature, Oral tales of India, and Types of Indic folk
