The "Net of Indra"
Dear Stephen,
Fair enough. I probably should have mentioned the Tibetan materials 
as well. It remains the case that we should look to the Ga.n.?avyuuha 
for the moment for an Indian source for these ideas.
I don't think validity is an issue for historical scholarship and 
philology. That's a matter for Mahaayaana Buddhists themselves and 
they have clearly taken different views in different cases.
It seems equally doubtful whether the Ratnakuu.ta existed as a 
collection in India. (By India here one means ancient South Asia and 
contiguous areas.)
That doesn't rule out a composition in Sanskrit in Central Asia. This 
means that in the Indian context we cannot confidently look for 
influences on other works. We also have to consider the possibility 
of its reaching India at some point from there.
Are you confident of ruling out Iranian languages from Central Asia, 
probably using many Sanskrit loanwords ?
This may sound rather negative of me. But I remain bothered by the 
total lack of references to the Avata.msaka collection in India to 
date.
