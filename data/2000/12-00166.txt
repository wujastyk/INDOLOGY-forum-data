Dear Dr. Vassikov,

Problems in Eastern Europe are fundamental and result from over 70 years of
suppression and denial of legitimate national rights of minority groups in
the name of ideology. The resultant ethnic conflagrations are not just an
out come of "public discussions" of these problems but a reflection of pent
up REAL frustrations and aspirations of these people and the violent
suppression of it by those who oppose it. In my view public discussions all
along would have prevented such carnage.

We also had a case of smooth separation of the Czech and Slovak people who
were able to separate by publicly discussing about their problems than to
kill each other. So you need two to tango!

Fortunately in the US, even hate speech is protected by the constitution,
we just try to run them out of business by bancrupting them not banning
them :-)
