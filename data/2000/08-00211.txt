The "Net of Indra"
Dear Steve,
Not the Avatam.saka which is a Chinese collection of materials, not
all of which has been proven to be of Indian origin. It is the
Ga.n.davyuuha (extant in Sanskrit) a translation of which is included
in that Chinese collection.
It is rather difficult to know exactly what would constitute '
extreme' here. This might be why not many people have replied.
One aspect of its origins lies in the abhidha(r)mma. Specifically in
the theories of hetu and pratyaya which try to show the
interrelatedness of things. This is most elaborate in the last book
of the canonical Abhidhamma-pi.taka in Pali: the Pat.thaana. This is
a work of the last two centuries B.C. for those who accept the
substantial closure of the Pali Canon in the first century B.C.
Others would date it a century or two later.
It presents a system of dhammas using the 22 triplets and 100
couplets of the abhidhamma, analyzing their relationships in 24 major
ways. In each of the 24 are seven chapters subdivided into four
sections, each with questions and answers. Within each of these parts
it operates its basic method of 24 paccaya (conditions/relations). In
effect, everything is intricately related to everything else either
because it must be there or it must not be there, etc., etc.
I think this does qualify as 'extreme'. (And we haven't got to the
commentaries yet!)  Whether it is precisely an example of what you
are looking for, is harder to say. For myself, I would see it as
expressing in terms of 'dhammas' something similar to what is
expressed in some later Mahaayaana works in terms of persons
(puggalaadhi.t.thaana). But these are not exactly systems of
correspondences.
