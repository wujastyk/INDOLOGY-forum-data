Krishna as avatarin?

Martin Gansten has already given a long explanation of this which is
broadly correct.  See http://www.dvaita.org/shaastra/gita/bg1041.html for
actual commentary by Madhva, etc.  One point to note is that per Madhva,
the eleventh chapter (vishvarUpa-adhyAya) of the Bhagavad Gita contains a
vindication of his position that ``Krishna'' is not merely to be
understood to refer to an individual limited in time and space, and that
the qualities of the `vishva-rUpa' given there applied to Krishna
generally and at all times, though Arjuna only realized them at that time.
This differs from the understanding of Gaudiyas and others who aver that
the `vishva-rUpa' was (an apparently unimportant) material creation for
the benefit of Arjuna.
