professionals. From my own (relatively short) experience as a researcher, I
have always found that answering an amateur's seemingly trivial question can
actually help one to understand the strengths and weaknesses of one's own
arguments. Also, I find that now there is no one to dumb down the argument
so that I can understand it too.
