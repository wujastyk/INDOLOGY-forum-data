Lou and Susan are good friends.  I learned Snobol from Susan in the late
1970s, and have been in touch since.  I saw Lou just before Christmas, and
Susan has just taken up the chair in Library Studies at UCL (where I am a
lecturer).  Her inaugural was a wonderful survey of standards work.  With
Lou in Oxford, Susan back in England at London, and both John Lavagnino
and Willard Mccarty at Kings also in London, the UK is has enormous
strengths in humanities' computing nowadays.

If you examine the preliminary matter of the TEI standard, incidentally,
you will see that I chaired the Document Header Committee.  I wrote the
first draft of that part of the TEI standard.

There are two important centres in India which could probably do this
work: the IGNCA in New Delhi, and the RMRL in Chennai.  Both have 35mm
microfilm digitization equipment.  RMRL has a Wicks & Wilson microfilm
scanner; they have spare capacity and are looking for work.
