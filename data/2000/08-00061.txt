vasudhaiva ku.tumbakam revisited
At first glance, the MahA UpaniSad doesn't look that ancient.  It assumes a
highly developed VaiSNava theology, and its language contains constructions
not found in the principal UpaniSads,such as complex, multi-element
compounds, and the participle in -tavat used as a past active tense.
