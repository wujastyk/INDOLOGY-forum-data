History of Mughalstan
Well, you obviously didn't have enough of it. Why make a pretense
to prove otherwise?
Well, I for one, am hardly interested in religious propaganda. I believe
in the old Brahmin ideal which doesn't share religion too easily. But if you
seek to misrepresent it, don't expect me to keep silent.
<< In Indian history there's not much evidence that *people*
identifed themselves as nations like it was in Europe.>>
That was only a comment in passing and was not the main point in the
argument.
Underline the word "right now". And the people and the regions I'm talking
about are exclusively Indic/Hindu - Hindu rulers and subjects. The recent
secessionist movements orchastrated by Islamic and Christian interests, are
beyond the scope of my argument.
But did they become kings and queens through conquests and did people
accept them that way?
Which was never accepted willingly by the peoples it ruled.
I've lived in Europe for a couple of years and in America for more than
four years. Ofcourse I wouldn't be too bold in my pronouncements for
there's the ever present risk of too much generalization. But in my
opinion the ideals on which the societies in the West rest, are not too
conducive to spirituality (atleast spirituality as an Indian would view
it - and this is not my individual opinion - 9 out of 10 Indians will
say the same thing). And mainstream popular culture is ever widening the
gap.
"Is it not a fact that there have been bloody wars all over South Asia
throughout all of its history, irrespective of what myth-makers have
said about 'spiritual' 'Vedic' tendencies etc.?"
