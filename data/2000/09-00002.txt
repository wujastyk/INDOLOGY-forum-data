>?From the visvakarma brahmins, many tamil poets - kaTikaimuttu,
cuppiratIpam, mAmpazak kavicciGkam, ... wrote in the
"little" kingdoms. KaTikamuttu taught Tamil to umaRuppulavar
who wrote the Islamic epic, cii.raappuraa.nam.
cuppiratIpam was the teacher to the Jesuit priest from Italy,
Veeramaamunivar.

These poets' works usually question the supremacy of brahmins.
Oftentimes the hero who drinks, goes after many dasis, and suffers
poverty and disease (VD) at the end and then miraculously saved
by God is a brahmin. This happens for the first time in Tamil
literature. Earlier, the heros are usually Vellalas, and the
brahmins are praised all the time in poetry. Well in concert with
the time-honored priest-peasant alliance, explained by
the late Burton Stein. OTOH, the literature from the Nayak
period often portrays the brahmin in poor light.
This originates from the Deccan where Veerassaivism starts out
anti-brahminical (See the introduction in Warriors of "Siva,
Velcheru Narayanarao). Periyar EVR Naicker whose mothertongue
is Kannada comes from Veerashaivaite background.

Many prabandhams from the Vijayanagar period remain unedited,
from mss. and the social, historic and literary study of these
works have not been done in depth.
