Information Request
Dear Vidya Kamat,
I had an interest similar to yours and could find no direct references and
in fact became aware of the paucity of references to nipples as well as
breasts which struck me as unusual since India seemed little concerned with
genitalia. I did find however a great number of references to androgyny that
artists seemed to depict with one breast on a god.
