Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
A question was posed about the possible source of <namah.>
My recollection is that the term <nama-ukti> in the sense of uttering a homage
occurs somewhere in the Rig Veda. Perhaps some expert can explain this more.
But namah as <na+ mama> sounds like the kind of word-play that I believe
classical Sanskrit scholars used to enjoy (there is more punning in ancient
Sanskrit and Tamil writings than are wittily understood), and some Neo-Sanskrit
etymologists (unwittingly and aritficially) construct.
