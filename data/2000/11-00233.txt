Your dichotomy seems false.  A migration is a movement from one place
to the other, and an invasion means a military subjugation.  The
available evidence allows us to infer that linguistic transfer took
place, and therefore at least some migration.  It does not tell us
whether peaceful movements, military subjugation, or a combination of
several different kinds of events were involved in this migration.
To speak of "migration" rather than "invasion", therefore, is to
refrain from making inferences not supported by the evidence; it does
not mean invasions have been ruled out.
