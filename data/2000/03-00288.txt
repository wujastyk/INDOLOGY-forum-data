Good point. I discussed this several times  in 1983/6, I believe. (*see
note below)

Our experience with less  known Vedic schools (zaakhaa) shows precisely
what you refer to.
Very few variants in texts that are spread over a large part of South Asia,
e.g. in the Yajurveda,
Vajasaneyi (Samh./ Satapatha in Madhyandina version) all over northern
India and Nepal,
or Taittiriya  texts found all over S.India, where according to the
proverb,"even the house cats know the YV"  (gRR, gRR...)

But when it comes to Maitrayani texts (Gujarat, NW Maharastra, a little in
Nagpur), they were transmitted only by a small section of the 100 clans of
Gujarat Brahmins (Pancoli), and mistakes and differences in  the (written)
transmission abound (the oral one has hardly been studied; in M. Haug's
time c. 1860, Brahmins still recited the whole Samhita by heart... Another
loss, due to neglect by scholars, see HOS OM 2, intro.)
The same applies to the Katha school (only Kashmir), or to other small
schools (Vadhula, Agnivesya, Jaiminiya, etc.) And the Atharvaveda (which
seems to have been learnt only by less than 1% of the Vaidika Brahmins,
acc. to inscriptional evidence).

The point is precisely your point: In such small schools/zaakhaa-s, there
was little possibility to countercheck, once a mistake was introduced in
recitation/writing during the period of decline of such schools in the
middle ages. I remember one such typical case in Maitr. Samh. (in my
thesis). Or, what could actually happen (in the even less studied
Atharvaveda) is nicely described in S.P.Pandit's (unread!!) preface to his
ed. of the Atharvaveda, Bombay, end of 19th. cent. Luckily, Madhav
Deshpande has unearthed  and discussed this case in his ed. & transl. of
the AV Pratisakhya
(HOS Volume 52. Saunak?ya Catur?dhy?yik?. A Pr?tis?khya of the Saunak?ya
Atharvaveda, with the commentaries Catur?dhy?y?bh?sya,
Bh?rgava-Bh?skara-Vrtti and Pancasandhi, critically edited, translated &
annotated by MADHAV M. DESHPANDE. 1997. Pages, vi, 815)

Imagine a southern Rgvedin or Samavedin coming to Benares and reciting his
text (same zaakhaa) in public in front of a, say, Gujarati. Any mistake
would immediately be spotted,
etc etc.;  and of course, there are and always have been public
recitations, during the 2nd mill. CE often in comnnection with temples,
especially in the South. And rituals such as a (post-Vedic) Laksahoma where
one has to recite all 4 Vedas in public. ... Not to speak of Grhya rites,
as in marriage, or sraddhas where your colleagues can butt in and scold
you. No ritual without a ritual discussion...
