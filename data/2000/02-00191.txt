Subject: Origins of Greek art
Message-ID: <161227055999.23782.17607578884089354273.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

David Napier in his "Foreign Bodies" (UoCalifornia Press,
1992), with elaborations subsequently, sees Indic
influence in the represenation of the Gorgon at Tiryns
in the very beginning of Greek art. Does this mean that
there was exchange between India and Greece in the
2nd millennium BC? Wouldn't that go counter to
"standard" view?
