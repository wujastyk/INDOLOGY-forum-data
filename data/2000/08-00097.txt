Being a non-TamilNadu Tamil, I can not speak for Tamilnadu. However, I will
be happy if you could respond.

While agreeing that DK is not a friend of Brahmins, I will be happy if you

Noone claims that Tamil Brahmins are rich, but the issue is how they
manipulate the state.

I do not complain about every brahmin in TamilNadu, but a powerful brahmin
