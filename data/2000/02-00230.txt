Sanskrit homework from Snowy Michigan
Dear friends,
        I would like to share with you a piece of Sanskrit composition
submitted as part of the class homework.  I found this in one of my old
files.
ye chaatraa.h himam d.r.s.tvaa vidyaalayam agatvaa hime khelanti te himena
prasiidanti /  ye tu hime calanta.h tatra patanti te.saam bahu du.hkham
jaayate /  ye hime patanti te iizvaram nindanti /  iizvara.h aakaaze vasan
na kadaapi hime patati /  yadaa janaa.h hime patanta.h iizvaram nindanti,
tadaa iizvara.h taan vadati - he janaa.h, maa maam nindata / yu.smaakam
eva etat karma /  yadi yu.smaakam pu.nyam paapaad adhikam bhavet tarhi
yuuyam FLORIDAayaam eva jaayedhvam / ye.saam pu.nyam eva bhavati, na kim
api paapam, te sarve janaa.h FLORIDAdeze vasanti /
        As things would have it, the student who wrote this composition
probably about 15 years ago, got a job in Florida.  Best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
