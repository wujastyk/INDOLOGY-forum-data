[AW: Griffith's Manner on RV.61.5-9]
Sorry for my typo(RV 10.61), and thank you Prof. Witzel, Roebuck, and
specially Schlerath for detail. You all remind me that Korean also does the
samething in Chinese very often. Anyway it was strange to me that even Latin
translation had to be moved into appendix.
