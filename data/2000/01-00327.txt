well, .... actually I've been studying this text for about 15 years.
I have been preparing a new edition of the Skt, critical edition of
Tib + 5 (!) Chinese translations, English translation with extensive
notes (with G M Nagao)...  (+ plans to re-edit the Cy with full
parallels from the Yogacarabhumi)...  I'll look forward very much to
your translation, which I will study with care! (Where & when will it
be published?)

I agree with you that azani means hail here, although the word still
puzzles me.

As for our old friend camel-smoke, I'm stumped. Perhaps all I have to
add is that in BHSD Edgerton's indication that Das's Tib-Eng Dict
gives "full confirmation of the KP passage" is vitiated by the fact
that the Tib quoted by Das is the Tib trans of KP!
