Ethos is a huge concept.  I restrict to a few historical references. I suggest you read 'vanjikkANDam'
in 'CilappathikAram' - a tamil epic from 200 CE.  Similarly read a few verses from puRa naNURu
describing Mauryan attempts at colonising the extreme south; also about references on pre-mauryan
nanDA rule. There have even been mercenery attacks by yaudeya warlords (whose territories were
supposed to be around the modern eastern Rajasthan/Western UP and closer to Delhi). It has not
been smooth relations, after all, between the north and the south..
Dismissive attitude about the 'Madrasis' is not a recent development. In the epic 'CilappathikAram',
When the CErA king Cenkuttuvan hears that the kings, expecially from around pAtaliputra, talks
dismissive about Tamils, he wanted to give a fitting reply. He embarks on a warring expedition with
the help of sAta vAhana king catakarNi; he defeats the northern kings; culls out a stone from the
himalayas to erect a statue for kaNNAgi in the newly built temple (which is existing even today in
the border of tamil nADu and Kerala near tEni.
Many ancient and not so ancient tamil and kalingA kings were more oriented often towards the south
east Asia and Srilanka rather than north India. Still, occasionally they have spectacularly invaded
the north. Even an ancient kalinga (orissa) king kharavela (through his inscription - 200 BCE) talks
about a century old confederacy of Tamil Kings Which prevented nanDa/Maurya expansion in to the
 south.
This is not to suggest that there are no commonalities between north and South. But tell me, how
many north Indian Scholars,historians or otherwise, would know these stories.
.Even south Indian history professors conveniently gloss over, while we study  so much about vEdAs,
Upanishads, Asoka, Aurangazeb etc,
