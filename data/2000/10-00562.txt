-isms
1. The ending -ism (French -ism, Spanish -ismo, Latin/German -ismus) is clearly
English. Contrary to the sensitivity of some neo-Hindus, who don't like the
word Hinduism,  there is no (necessary) negative connotation to it. In some
contexts, it could correspond to the Sanskrit suffix -vAda or -siddhAnta. In
this sense, Shaivism and Vaishnavism are words created for use in English.
2. It does not follow that that their equivalents did not exist in classical
(Pre-English) Tamil where one used the words saivam or saivamadam or
saivasamayam and vainavam or vainavamadam to connote these words.
SaivasiddhAntam refers to the
philosophical/metaphysical underpinnings of saivam.
