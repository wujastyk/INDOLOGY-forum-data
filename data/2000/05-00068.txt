Impact of mantra recital, etc.
Re: Dr.  Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical School and of the Mind/Body project
(  http://www.mindbody.harvard.edu/   ) ...
.... I heard it from the H[orse]'s mouth last Friday in a local conf. about
Shamanism.
Benson has no prejudice/preconceived idea about any religion/technique and
has worked with several of them.
His claims therefore should be seriously compared with those mentioned on
the list, whether
consisting of just 1 or some 500 studies...
(The results mentioned by some go squarely against his express stress on
reptetion of *any* syllable/word)
And  (difference in) research methods should be highlighted as well.
I leave all of that to our medical & hightech shamans, not the zramaNa!
on a different topic : indicated by : "Subrahmanya S." :
http://www.vkyogas.org.in/research.html : see:
Dave & Nagendra H R "Effect of Agnihotra on germination of rice seeds - a
controlled trail".
No time to check that out. -- I just hope it is not the same type of
"controlled" experiment done some 20 years ago at U. of Khanpur, according
to a book on "Agnihotra":
- sow one field  with seeds and Agnihotra ash.
- sow one field, next to it,  with seeds but no Agnihotra ash.
Result: the one with Agnihotra ash delivered much more grain!!!
