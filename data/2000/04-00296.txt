Q: Basic text on philosophy of religion
There are more than eighty articles in Indian philosophy (Hindu, Buddhist
and Jain) and more than one hundred articles on Chinese, Korean
and Japanese philosophy (inlcuding many on Buddhism) in the Routledge
Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The articles are written by a variety of
experts in the various philosophical traditions. (Many of the authors
subscribe to this forum.)
