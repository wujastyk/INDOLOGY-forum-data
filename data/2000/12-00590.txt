Subject: nArANa, the Bengali word for  nArAyaNa
Message-ID: <161227066032.23782.7945306298365356271.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks for the info that NAraNa is in Bengali. Is NAraNa also attested?

In Eastern languages, -r- is invariably interchanged with -l-, isn't it?
Is nAlaNa/nAlANa also attested in East India as meaning Narayana?

Thanks,
SM

 nArANa [pronounced naaraana], the Bengali word for nArAyaNa [samsad bAGgAlA
 abhidhAn =   shangshad baangaalaa (sic) abhidhaan] is glossed as the
 apabhramza form of Skt [and tatsama] word nArAyaNa.


 But is it possible [ as my high school headmaster Khagendranath Dasgupta
 thought] to derive nArANa [a veritable proto-Bengali word, attested in
 place-names etc.] from Santali nAr, "to cheat", "to deceive" [nArAyaNa being
 the great deceiver, mohinI and all that]. The -ANa ending is attested in words
 like gAyANa [=gAyen], bAyANa [bAyen] etc.


 Or [the moral of the story] is it not comparable to inviting Yaska to preside
 over an etymological debate ? And construe a whole cultural universe based on
 the perennial Nirukta ?
