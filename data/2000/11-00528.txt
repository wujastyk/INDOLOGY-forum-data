Betreff: Re: Basque and Tamil related?
Can anybody in the list tell me if it is a pure coincidence, or it is due to
some other reason, that there is a marked resemblance between the Greek and
Tamil words for "old": palaios and palaiya?

Greek palaios is a derivation from an Indo-European root *kuel- "far
(away)", from the same root comes Skt. carama- "the outermost, last". - So
the resemblance disappears.
