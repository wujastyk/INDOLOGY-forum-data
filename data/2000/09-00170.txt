meaning of the word...
Could anybody give an idea what a word tvA.sa could
mean. It is not connected to tve.sa, dve.sa etc. The
word is found thrice in a Sanskrit text from Kerala,
everytime in Loc Sg (tvA.se), as a usage for various
limbs in Kathakali. The Malayalam translation gives
the same word.
          Thanks.
