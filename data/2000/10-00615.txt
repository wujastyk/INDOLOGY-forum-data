Endo and Exo
Good Evening,
Well done ! I feel rather EXO ! That is to say, naive enough to believe that
comparative philology can make peoples closer to one another.
Most European citizens speak with "Sanskrit" roots and are unaware of that.
"Monsieur Jourdain aussi faisait de la prose sans le savoir !".
Almost every time you pronounce , say, French or German, or Russian words,
you utter sanscritic phonemes. But alas one thing is missing : le "sens
critique" (sorry for the pun !).
Andr? Signoret.
