        Dr. SMS Chari has written a new book - "Philosophy of the Upanisads,
a
        comparitive assessment based on the bhasyas of Samkara, Ramanuja &
Madhva".
        Dr. Chari is a seasoned "Vedanta Expert" with 5 or 6 books ( in
English)  to
        his credit.  He has studied under traditional scholars in India and
is
        active in Vedanta for the last 60 or so years.  His previous book
was
        "Philosophy of the Brahmasutras - a comparitive assessment based on
the
        bhasyas of Samkara, Ramanuja & Madhva
        He wanted a few reviewers for his current book.
        I would appreciate if anyone can suggest experts who have studied
different
        commentaries on the Upanisads to review this book. The book is
written in
        English.  I had a chance to look into this book myself.  I did study
under
        him while he was preparing these two books.  I feel that it is a
book that
        is "one of its kind".
