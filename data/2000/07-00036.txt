[calcutta named]

It is not a coincidence that Calcutta and Calicut sound so similar. The
original settlement in Calcutta came up at a village called Sutanati, but
the new town was named after Kolkata, which would remind Europe of Calicut
already known through Portuguese trade. Note that Kolkata and Kalighat were
two distinct localities in the pre-Calcutta days.
The new town[Calcutta] was named after Kalikata [or Kolikata], and not
Kolkata, the latter being the modern calit Bangla name of the city. Kalikata
is mentioned in the rent-roll of of Akbar [the Mughal emperor]and the early
sevententh century Bengali mangal kAvya Manasamangal. 
As about  coincidences and non-coincidences, alam atipallavitena.
