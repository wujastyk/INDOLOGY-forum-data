Q: old Tamil materials
Friends,
1. Iravatham Mahadevan mentioned in an interview given in January 1998, that
he is working on a book on the earliest Tamil inscriptions. Has the book
appeared yet? Where?
2. What are the standard materials (esp. grammar, but also dictionary and
texts) to study old Tamil?
Any information is most welcome.
Yours,
Ferenc
