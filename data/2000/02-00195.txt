Please see ardhanArInarezvara below.
some people believe that Kanda refers to Prostate gland, possibly due to a
procedure known as kandapidana (stimulating kanda).
are you talking about Kundalini?
If you mean by this that the Yogi loses interest in sex, it may be acceptable,
but not if you mean physical feminization.
About what Vidya wrote :
By any chance you are not talking about ArdhanArInarezvara, because if so, then
it is very clear. It has philosophical significance.
You might have seen a minature painting of Dhanvantari (Azvinau), because that
dual god is generally shown with a jar of Oshadhi (medicines?). Indian
iconographers would show breast as breats, they did not have any inhibitions.
Best wishes,
