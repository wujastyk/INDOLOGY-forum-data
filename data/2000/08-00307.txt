Considering that the Indo-Aryans migrated into India in post-Harappan
times, the origins of the word, "mlecha" is significant. Originally,
it was meluHHa in Pali and in Sumerian clay tablets. Experts on the
Indus culture derive meluHHa as Dravidian, close to Tamil "mElakam".
Also, consider the related  words for pepper: Drav. mi.laku and
MIA mirchii.
