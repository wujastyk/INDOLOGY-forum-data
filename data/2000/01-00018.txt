Warsaw seems to have the knack of hearing the true rumours. In future, Vidarbha from
Maharashtra and Tailangana from Andhra. This is the end of glosso-centric state carving

that there will be Chattisgarhi prize for poetry and Kumaonvi  prize for music, but the
states shall teach standard Hindi in schools and colleges.
