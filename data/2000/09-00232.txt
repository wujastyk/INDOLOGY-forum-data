according to the phase of the moon at sunrise, but Sivaratri is to be
observed through the night, not through the day. Usually, the chances are
that if the moon is in its 13th phase at sunrise, it will enter the 14th
phase during the night (if it has not already passed into the 14th, in the

amAvAsyA would have begun. So the Sivaratri observance generally starts
during the night of the 13th, and continues into the morning of the 14th.
