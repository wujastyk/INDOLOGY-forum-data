Dravidian origins
For a starter, you might look at my paper "Pre-?Rgvedic convergence 
between Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) and Dravidian?  A survey of the issues 
and controversies." In:  Ideology and status of Sanskrit: 
Contributions to the history of the Sanskrit language, ed. by J. E. 
M. Houben, 17-58.  Leiden: Brill.  1996.  In the paper I give a brief 
and, I hope, fair overview of various pertinent theories and their 
problems.  The bibliographical references should open the way to 
further, more in-depth presentations of the various views.
Best wishes,
Hans Henrich Hock
