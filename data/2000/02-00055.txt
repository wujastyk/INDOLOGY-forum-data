Regarding the meaning of the Isha Upanishad, I would go with the
Eknath Easwaran translation, if I were you.  The Upanishads are
not museum pieces, to be referred to linguistic and philological experts
for precise meanings.  The Upanishads are meant to be applied to living,
and require an illumined teacher who can add the benefit of experience.
These are not mathematical equations, these are poetry.  Eknath Easwaran
(passed away in 1999) is about as good as you can get via books.
With all due respect to the scholars, you would go to learn to box
from a boxer and not from a historian of boxing.

The Upanishads are very much the underpinning of modern India.
Mahatma Gandhi said, that if only certain three words were to survive
from the Isha Upanishad from all the corpus of Hinduism, it would be
sufficient : tena tyakten bhunjitah.
