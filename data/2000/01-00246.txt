Well, we will have to wait and see.  There still is no known mechanism
for recombination in mtDNA. The researchers came to their conclusions
because they found anomalies that could not be explained by maternal
inheritance.  However, you also can not directly link it to paternal
inheritance. That is an assumption.

Critics point out that the anomalies could be due to other factors
besides paternal influence.
