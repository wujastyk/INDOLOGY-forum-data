This is very close to being an insult.  I'll let this one past, but please
be more careful in future.  I don't know whether you really meant to be
rude here or not, but bear in mind that email is a tricky medium where
emotional tone is concerned, and you need to be extra, extra polite to
make sure that nobody gets hurt, even unintentionally.
Thank you.
