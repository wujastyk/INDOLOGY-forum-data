Dear Mr. Vijayaraghavan,
Did I not give you the earliest reference for the word Saivam (maNimEkalai)
and VaiNavam ( PeriyAzvAr) ? You did acknowledge that.
And now you write to Mr Maran that there is no reference to VaiNavam.. How
is that?
With regards,
irAma.ki
By the way, I have not forgotten your asking for the references to the
prevalence cross-cousin marriages among Dravidians. It will take some time;
but I will come back.
