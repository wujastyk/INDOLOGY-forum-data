Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
The early Aryan migrants had nothing to do with temples
at all. Rigveda has no word for 'brick'. The earlier vedi
is a shallow pit to invite Gods; When public rituals
involving mahAvedis start, Non-Aryans have acculturated.
Indian art was started by heteredox religions such as
Buddhists and Jains, and art historians point to Greek
and Iranian influences in the beginnings of art of historic
India after the hiatus once Indus culture declined.
