address request
Dear Colleagues,
Can anyone please supply me with the current address (preferably e-mail, but postal
would help) of Dr H. G. Dewa who was until fairly recently at the University of
Durban-Westville?  Messages by both means have been returned to me as "gone away" but
without any alternative address.
With thanks
John Brockington
