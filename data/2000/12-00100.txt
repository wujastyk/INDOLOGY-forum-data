That was a generous and enlightened statement of apology.
I wish we would all be more understanding of one another's perspectives,
sensibilities, and emotions.
It hurts me to see that all too often Indology becomes an arena
in the Roman sense of the term, with gladiators in confrontation instead of
scholars in a common quest.
Best regards,
