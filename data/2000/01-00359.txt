To further clarify my query, given that pitch values are being associated
with the terms udaatta, anudaatta and svarita, there can be only two
intervals among three notes. The absolute pitch of one note has to be
arbitrary, and the other two can be defined relatively. That is why I am
puzzled how any sense can be made out of assigning 4, 2 and 3 Srutis to
udaatta, anudaatta and svarita.
