If you want you can use us as guinea pigs... We should focus on Mac and Windows.
I tend to be critical of TeX nowadays, because it's really a dinosaur.
I have been involved in writing converters to and from TeX myself, and we have
supported it here for a very long time. It's time to move on.
What is needed is a Unicode-based and complete coverage of Devanagari (I mean
including all variants, not just the modern "horizontally aligned" character
composition variants), plus intelligent typing wizards for Mac and Windows, which
should allow switching to and from "transliteration mode".
I have written a plug-in for this many years ago, for a graphics-mode text editor
running under--sorry--DOS, but as it was pirated totally we discontinued
development.
Maybe somebody can organize research grants or private sponsorship to set up an
international conference for deciding the Unicode side of things and for covering
the software engineering side.
The Unicode homologation is the expensive proposition, especially as additionally
agreement would have to be won from major OS vendors (Apple, MS, Sun, etc.). The
resulting software engineering is harmless.
Best regards,
Gunthard
