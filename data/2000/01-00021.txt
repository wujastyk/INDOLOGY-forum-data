Vital Statistics
Certain political realities serve to "solidify" this
picture. For example, there has been an increasing
tendency among Punjabi Hindus to return their mother
tongue as Hindi.
In what appears to be a reverse situation, the number
returned for Konkani is surprisingly low.
I doubt if communication or mutual comprehension is
the issue here.
