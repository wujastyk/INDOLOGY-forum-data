Siva and Vishnu (was: Kinship systems)
...
Offhand I can recall PeriyapurANam (medieval..12th century CE?), the classic
saiva hagiography by cEkkizAr, employing the word "caivam" in the phrase "caiva
neRi tazaittu OGka" ("in order to make the path of Saivism thrive...") when
referring to JAn2acampantar's birth.
