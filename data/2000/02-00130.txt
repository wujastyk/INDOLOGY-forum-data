Dahilaxmi library
Dear Prof. Dave,
I am very interested to learn that you are involved in running this
important library of Sanskrit manuscripts.
A list of the contents of the library was compiled in the 1950s by Prof.
V. Raghavan, and that list was included in the material compiled in the
New Catalogus Catalogorum.  But it would still be of great interest to be
able to study the original list of Raghavan, since that is the only
practical way to get a birds-eye view of the contents of this important
Gujarat collection of Skt. MSS.
Is there a copy of Raghavan's list at the library?  And if so, would you
and the other members of the library board be willing to publish it?
Yours,
Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
