I once gave a gift to a Sanskrit teacher in India.  After asking around in
the appropriate circles at some length as to what would be appropriate, I
settled on a wool chAdar. This is a fairly standard gift.  But it was of
the best quality available. People who wear such things, such as
traditional Sanskrit teachers, are well aware of the differences in
quality between chAdars ( or different types of dhotis, etc).  He seemed
well satisfied.  Edwin Bryant
