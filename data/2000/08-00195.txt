SV: Witzels's scholarly translations
... don't you feel it is high time to stop this "discussion"?
I am still in the illusion, that "Indology" is an academic forum....

yeah ! And then you use it as an example of the AMT !.
A Piltdown textual evidence for the AMT.
The nonsense of supposed IE superiority in horse handling,
chariot tanks and going around reigning over all the lesser peoples
is europeanist dogma.
Your quotes about vedic "tanks"  have already been given
on the IndianCivilization list. No, you havent said
anything about panzers. A panzer is a very specific
kind of tank that only the germanic tribes would know.
I will repost your vedic tank gems on this list as well,later
when I have more time.
sigh - immaturity !.
