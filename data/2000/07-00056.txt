Even today vETar/vETTuvar exist - a caste in Dharmapuri,
Krishnagiri, Karur, Hosur etc., Among their temples under
a tree, several important herostone inscriptions dating to
4-6th centuries are found. Lot more have been discovered
after Nagaswamy's book, CeGkam naTukaRkaL, TN state dept. of
archaeology.

Tamil KuRumbar is cognate with Kannada Kurubaru.
May be kuRumbar/kurubaru may have something to with
kuRiJci, the mountain landscape. Today they are
more like Mullai landscape folks - iTaiyar (=intermediate
people between kuRiJci and Marutam). Cuntarar got waylaid,
He mentions: "koGkil *kuRumpil* karakkut taLiyAy".
"vaTuku" seems to have denoted not just Andhra, but Karnataka
as well in old Tamil literature.

What is the connexion between Gollas & Kurubas?
