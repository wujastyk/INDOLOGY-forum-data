  Pl. note these are the words of Iravatham Mahadevan, a reputed
  scholar on early Tamil and Indian epigraphy. The reference given is
  Studies in History, 11,  2,   n.s., 1995, p.182-5,  published from
  N. Delhi.

  What you are talking is about the post-sangam era. Pallavan rule
  marks the definite break with the Classical Tamil sangam period,
  and the nascent feudal society with land-owning castes being formed.

  Iravatham and Palaniappan discuss an earlier period, and point out
  the democracy and 'kuTavOlai'  voting prevalent in the CT era which
  was followed by the Cholan  inscription at uttaramErUr dated
  1020 CE.
