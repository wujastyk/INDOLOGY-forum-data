Impact of mantra recital, etc.

For some time now, there has been a tendency in certain political circles
that anything labeled "Vedic" is assumed to be somehow authentic,
wonderful, and superior.  The adjective thus gets misused a lot.  Perhaps
this is a reaction to perceived Western undervaluation of India's
heritage, which is a stretch, but even then the results are anything but
funny.  I remember distinctly that some years ago, there was a discussion
about so-called "Vedic mathematics" on another forum; at that time, I
caused quite a bit of ire among some by stating that in my opinion, there
was nothing "Vedic"  about the same, and it wasn't even very interesting
mathematics, no matter what the source.
