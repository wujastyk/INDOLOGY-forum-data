Questions about non-Tamil Jain, Buddhist and Ajivika beliefs
For the attitudes of early Jains on some of these issues, one would do
well to read:
  Johnson, W. J. _Harmless Souls: Karmic Bondage and Religious Change
  in Early Jainism with special reference to Umasvati and Kundakunda_
  (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1995)
This is still available from MB.
Another work which is especially valuable is:
 Shah, N. J., ed., _Jaina Philosophy and Religion [English trans. of
 Jaina Darshana by Muni Shri Nyayavijayaji_ (Delhi: Bhogilal Lehar
 Chand Institute of Indology & Mahattara Sadhvi Shree Mrigavatiji
 Foundation, 1998)
This is also still available from MB.
Hope this is of some assistance,
