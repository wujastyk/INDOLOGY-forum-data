Dear Vidya Kamat,
I translate the ParAtriMshikA as stating that the ideal of Yoga is to obtain
androgyny as exemplifed by Rudra. The yogi becomes a yogini because of
releasing the lower feminine power. The Hathayoga pradipika describes the
kanda as the source of feminine power that does feminize.  Breasts may then
become the outer manifesting of this higher power.
