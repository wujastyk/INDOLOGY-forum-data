Dates of written Rgveda
Dr. Farmer,
Generally, Indologists date the Rig Veda to around 1200 BCE.
After the Indus valley culture declined around 1700 BCE, Aryan
migrations tookplace spreading Indo-Iranian language into India.
Sanskrit developed out of it. In the Indus culture, Dravidian, not Sanskrit,
was the high language. See A. Parpola, Deciphering the Indus script,
Cambridge.
Of course, Manu smrthi was written after 3rd cent. BCE giving
supremacy to Varnashrama system.
