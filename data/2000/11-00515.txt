Looking at the text version of the TS at TITUS,
I noticed an interesting pattern: At boundaries
marked as ` / ' (ardhrca?) and ` // ' (actual
breaks), there is only aH. But at the boundaries
marked as ` \ ', sandhi rules are not applied. For
example, the opening section has
    k/armaNe \ <br> /A
    -/Sa~Msas \ <br> rudr/asya
    bahv/Is \ <br> y/ajamANasya
Unfortunately, there is no explanation of the notation
at the head of the file. This might reflect an editorial
convention rather than manuscript practice.
