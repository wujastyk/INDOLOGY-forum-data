As far as I can see, the scholars you mention, eminent though they may
be, are not very recent -- Buddhist studies have moved on somewhat
since the 1960s -- for example, Stcherbatsky is considered "an
important pioneer" (a polite way of saying he is largely out of date
in his interpretations.  I think you will not find many of your other
scholars cited in bibliographies for academic studies of Buddhism
these days.   I cannot comment on Vidyasankar Sundaresan's statements
about Vedaanta but what he says makes very good sense from the
Buddhist view of this matter.

Best wishes,
