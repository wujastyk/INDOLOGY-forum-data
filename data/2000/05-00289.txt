All these deal essentially with the depiction of Indra as god of lavishness
and protege of the suuris (who imitate his conduct and resist the ari who
has become a hoarder of wealth). It is my belief that understanding of this
depiction opens a new vista for the interpretation of the term ari which in
turn is crucial to the understanding of the sociology of the RV. I find it
difficult to accept that ari means der Fremdling.
