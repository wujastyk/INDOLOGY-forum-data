The following are my responses to those who have participated or interested
on this topic :

1. I have referred to Fitzgerald's work on the use of iron in Mahabharat,
not for dating Mahabharat .
2. The date of Mahabharat has been estimated to be earlier than 1700 BCE
based on drying up of the Saraswati river  which was mentioned in the
Mahabharat . Balram made a pilgrimage along the river just before the war .
3. The events prior to Mahabharat, Indus Valley civilization clearly shows
the state of development of non ferrous metallurgy during this civilization.
4. Events, much after, 5th Century BCE have shown the ferrous ( Iron -
Steel ) to be very well developed. The steel was exported from India. The
famous Damiscus steel technology was Indian.
5.India had the raw materials as well as the technology to step into the
Iron Age in the ancient times which many countries did not have.
6. The web site regarding the drying up of the Saraswati river is:
http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/saraswatisindhucivization.html
One can cofirm the date of my statement as to when the Saraswati river
dried out .
7. The dates of Hitites , who are supposed to have started the Iron Age,
has been revised and ascertained to be more recent .
8 . This leaves India as one of the possible places where the Iron Age
began.9. This seems to be another Arabic Numeral debate as to where they
were used first.

Thanks in Advance.
