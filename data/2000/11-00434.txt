abhayada
As Artur Karp surmised, the epithet abhayada is used referring to "Siva in
puraa.nic texts. I think that many instances could be found; one reference I
can provide is "Sivapuraa.na "Satarudrasa.mhitaa 16.13a, where "Siva is called
sataam abhayada.h (the whole verse runs
tata.h sataam abhayada.h "sa.mkaro bhaktavatsala.h| dadhre "sirasi candra.m sa
vibhu.h "sara.nam aagatam||).
Incidentally, the same epithet is applied to "Siva in tantric texts as well.
