FRASKT in CSX and more.
I am pleased to tell you that My French-Sanskrit Dictionary is henceforth
available in two Formats :
                 1? For NINA fonts (as before)
                 2? For Time CSX fonts (suitable for non-French K-Boards)
Search from Sanskrit to French is now possible in both versions that,
moreover, do work with Winword 2000.
Suitable links are to be found on my Page :
http://asignoret.free.fr/index.html
Direct links are (all in low case) :
NINA : http://asignoret.free.fr/fraskt00.exe
CSX   : http://asignoret.free.fr/frsktcsx.exe
Updating Files for Dictionary alone (when available) have the same nouns
with ZIP extension (instead of EXE).
I expect that these pieces of information will be useful for Anglo-Saxon and
non-French Users. Special numeric keys (from 1 to 5) allow for the insertion
of French accents and cedilla.
Remerciements anticip?s et cordiales salutations.
