Madhava, Vidyaranya, Sringeri, and Kulke
   These Tamil inscriptions are significant given that the time gap
 between Sankara and Vidyaranya is not large (about 350-400 years).
   A good model is the one proposed by Stein for the Chola heartland
(Brahmin-Vellala alliance), the relations and accommodations between
the two groups is mutual.
