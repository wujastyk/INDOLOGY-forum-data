Repudiating Subhash Kak
Subhash Kak, the revisionist historian, has been churning out his trash at
www.sulekha.com Here is the url of his latest column, which is highly
thought provoking:
http://www.sulekha.com/cgi-bin/column.cgi?resource=ms_macaulay
Fortunately, www.sulekha.com has a comments section where readers can post
their comments on the articles at this site. I request some of the stalwarts
here to post at least one rebuttal of Kak in the comments section of Kak's
sulekha article.
