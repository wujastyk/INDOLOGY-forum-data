century BC by I. Mahadevan. From David McMahan, Orality,
writing and authority in south asian buddhism: visionary
literature and the struggle for legitimacy in the mahayana,
History of Religions, 1998, 37, 3, p. 249-274,
I understand that earlier Hinayana sects emphasized
aural text transmission in the sangha was modeled after
brahminical vedic recitation, but mahayana gave
the shift from aural to visual media. This involves
writing. Mahayana flourished in Lanka in early times
and later got purged. The Mahayana origins not just
in the Northwest but South India in places like
Sriparvatam, Potalaka(tam. Potiyil) and Ceylon also need
to be taken into consideration for constructing
the roots of  pustaka(skt)/potthaka(pali)/pottakam(tamil).

Etymology of Pustaka

I am reproducing below a section of a journal article, and
invite members to comment. Note that the supposed Iranian origin
of the word 'Pustak' is sometimes taken as a proof that Indians
learnt the art of writing from Iranians, It is also sometimes
taken as a 'proof' that Indians learnt writing (not taking the
IVC script into account) pretty  late.

"Pusta and Pustaka are accepted as words borrowed from Middle Iranian
post- 'skin', although skin and leather had never been used as
writing material in India, at least when the word is supposed to have
been  borrowed. 'pustaka' occurs much later than its immediate source
from  'pusta' which is attested in a 6th century copperplate
inscription from North Bengal (Paharpur). There is the mention of one
