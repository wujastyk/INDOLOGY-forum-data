Rajaram's bogus "horse seal"
Steve Farmer in his attack against Dr.Rajram on his
website writes:
"Jha Rajaram make much of a supposedly anamalous
genital placement in 453 claiming that the animal on
the seal is supposedly a horse and not a bull unicorn.
But Michael Witzel has found a better photo of the
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
same seal impression or a strikingly similiar one (note
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(#1)
identical inscription) in A.Parpola Corpus of Seals and
Inscriptions 1991, p.63,#772-A. Here we find the genitals
exactly where expected in a bull unicorn seal (cf. seal #773a
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(2)
on far right)"
#1. Note how Mr.Farmer first says "same seal impression" and then
adds "or a strikingly similiar one".
#2. Mr. Farmer writes "Here we find the genitals exactly where
expected" - by implication admitting that the the other seal
does NOT have "the genitals exactly where expected" - Thus
strengthening Rajarams arguments.
