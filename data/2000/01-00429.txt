Question on Text
Greetings, list members,
Has anyone seen a book called The Yoga of Spiritual Devotion: a Modern
Translation of the Narada Bhakti Sutras by Prem Prakash (Inner Traditions
Ltd.)?  If you have seen this book, can you comment on its translation,
scholarship, accuracy, and general worthiness?  Would you recommend it to
a student ever?
thanks for the responses, you may reply off-list if you prefer.
best wishes,
