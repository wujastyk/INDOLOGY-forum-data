Nagaswamy has his own reasons for doubting this, don't you think? If you
recall, he also wants Sankara's date to be in the BC period.
Inscriptions and their interpretation aside, there is concrete literary
evidence for vAcaspatimizra. bhAmatI colophons do not give the date of
composition. vAcaspati gives a date in a nyAya work of his, from which you
get either 840 CE or 975 CE, depending on whether you add 78 to or subtract
57 from the given date.
