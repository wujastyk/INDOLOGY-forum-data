But Tamil Nadu and Kerala were never part of any pan Indian ?empires? till
the advent of British Raj, hence the current apprehensions in the current
Delhi ?durbar? regarding the credentials of ?Indian? Tamils as Indians
reflected in their foreign policy decisions with respect to Sri Lanka

pan Indian ?credentials? and with Tamil identity.
