Your classification of Buddhist schools is confused.  Yogaacaras (your
"vij~aanavaadis") were just as staunch proponents of "`suunyavaada" as
any other Mahayanist. I suppose by the latter term you actually mean
Maadhyamika.  Anyway, to say that Yogaacarins deny the reality of the
world but admit the reality of ideas is to totally misread their
position.  They deny the existence per se of the objective pole of
perception but, importantly, equally deny the existence per se of
ideas/mind. I suggest you read the latter part of Vasubandhu's
Tri.m`sika carefully and you'll see what I mean.

I agree with Birgit Kellner's response to this.  Part of the problem
revolves around how one defines and understands "aalambana".

Ultimate maybe but not metaphysical in Buddhism.
