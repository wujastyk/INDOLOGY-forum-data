Etymology
muSTANDa
There is an entry in DEDR #4929 that says:
Ta. muTTattan2am = ignorance, stupidity; muTTan = dunce;
Ta. muTTATTam = stupidity, pertinacity or conceit  arising from ignorance.
Ma. muTTan2 = a stout, obstinate, stupid person.
It is very well attested that Dravidian -TT- often morphs into -NT-
(which as is well known is actually pronounced as -ND-):
For a few concrete attested examples
cf.
DEDR # 3221:
Ta. tiTTu = rising ground, bank. elevation, hillock
Ma. tiNDU = earthern wall,, bank, shoal
Ka. diTTu = hillcok; diNDu = hillock.
DEDR #4939:
lists both Ta. muTTai and Ta. muNDai = egg/ovum
kaTTi -> kaNDu (lump as in kaRkaNDu = hard candy)
DEDR #1148:Ta. kaTTi = clod, lump...
Ma. kaTTa = lump;
kaTTi = what is condensed, solid, ingot
kaNDi = lump, concretion
Hence one may safely conclude that Dr. muTTANDa- > muSTANDa.
That I hope satisfies the etymology of muSTANDa.
In general Dravidian root muTT- is rich in the senses of
stoutness, bulkiness, emptiness, hindrance etc.
One may also consider the following Dravidian words which coney a sense of
sturdiness/robustness:
DEDR #4932: muTTu = (verb) to butt, oppose, meet, assault, attack, fight.
             =(noun) battering, butting;
   Ma. muTTi = hammer
DEDR #4933 muTTu = to hinder, be hindered, prevented
 n. hindrance, obstacle, impediment, prop, support
The DEDR indirectly states that muSTi is a hypersanskritism of the Dravidian
muTTi.
The Cologne Tamil Lexicon:
muTTi
otl muTTi muTTi 02 1. fist; 2. blow with the fist; 3. a gesture with one hand

11. oblation of ball of rice deposited on the boundary line of a village
in a festival; 12. jaggery; 13. broken brick
DEDR entry #4935 lists muTTu:
Ta. = knee, elbow, knuckle
Ma. knob, joint or knot of cane or bamboo
...
That entry cross references DEDR #4919 muTagku
= (verb) to contract, become lame or maimed, bend, be spoiled.
DEDR #4932: muTTu = (verb) to butt, oppose, meet, assault, attack, fight.
             =(noun) battering, butting;

...> studies. Hope Indologists will help increase in academic Dravidology
I sure hope so too.
