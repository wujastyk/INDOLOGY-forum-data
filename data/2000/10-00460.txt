Dear Michael, they just picked
39 of the top institutions in Asia.
That was not a list of all Engineering
schools in Asia, only the top ones.
Read what you wrote.  Do you truly believe
that if Japan had the population of India,
it should have 40 of the top 39 institutions?
Isn't that taking Bonsai a bit too far?    :-)
I really fail to understand what you're
getting at here.  I pointed out that
"5 of the top 8 schools are from India".
Do you really claim that 40 of the top 8
schools ought to be from India?   :-)
True... but was it wise?
