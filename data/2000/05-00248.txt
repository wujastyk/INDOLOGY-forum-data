Liar's Paradox
in the mentioned article the focus is on verses 1-3 and 20-28 of Vakyapadiya
3.3; it contains a number of references to earlier discussions of the liar
and other paradoxes.
These verses of the Vakyapadiya have also been studied and translated,
together with the intervening verses 4-19,  in my The Sambandha-Samuddesa
(chapter on relation) and Bhartrhari's philosophy of language, Groningen:
Egbert Forsten, 1995 (Gonda Indological studies, vol. 2).
See further Claus Oetke "On the so-called Bhartrhari-paradox", at the World
Sanskrit Conference in Bangalore 1997 (English Abstracts).
and: George Cardona, Recent research in Paninian Studies (Delhi 1999), p.
269 and notes.
