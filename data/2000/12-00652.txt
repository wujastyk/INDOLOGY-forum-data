</color>Sorry that I remember the races in the Veda; or Manu, of the
Manusm.rti; or remember those millions of people called Dalitas,
and how they were and still are treated. Or that they had a
spokesperson named Ambedkar, who wrote in his book
_Annihilation of Caste_ that Hinduism must be destroyed in order
for India to have social justice. Now why should he have written
such things, if there were no "racially and religiously inferior"
people?

</color>I thought I explicitly did not do so - hm, oh well... Calumniare
audacter, semper aliquid haeret... Maybe Ambedkar too was a
western colonialist or something. Anyhow, something tells me that
the Dalitas (etc.) will be around for a long time yet, and that it
takes more than mere shouting to cover them up. And this travesty:

away unpleasant facts, is not chauvinism, but something worse,
and should have no place in scholarly exchanges.

Romanticising the past is hardly better than romanticising
colonialism. It is a waste of time. It does not explain, e.g., the
existence of newer religious groups that came into being to
religiously emancipate those who were discriminated against.
Looking at things as they were and are is always better, and
certainly on an originally academic forum, than any kind of
romanticising.
<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> The last remark does not carry much weight. Race was an unknown
</color>Apart from that there are Vedic passages that highlight differences
in physical features of people, I think the distinctions between race,
var.na, jaati make little difference for those who are at the receiving
end of discrimination and exploitation: in any case, they were 'born
wrongly'... I am very happy that this does not matter in some Hindu
minorities, where it also does not matter that I am a 'mleccha' (do
we remember the mlecchas?).
There are many things in India that are genuinely admirable, but
romantic fantasies, or misleading, quasi-indignant loudness, do
nobody any good; they do not help India either. Recognising some
of one's cultural weaknesses is a sign of one's overall cultural
strength. Some of our friends on this list have not yet realised that.
