Looking for info on Grantha script
There is a very useful short work, A Primer in Grantha Characters, by K.
Venugopalam, published by James H. Nye in 1983.  The 1983 pamphlet (pp. 14
+ v) lists the address of the publisher (319 West Swift St., St. Peter,
Minnesota 56082 USA) but this may well have changed.  However, you may be
able to obtain the work from a bookseller such as Motilal Banarsidass.
