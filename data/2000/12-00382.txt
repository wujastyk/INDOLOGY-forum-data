Incidentally, I'm surprised nobody here has raised Thor Heyerdahl's theory
that the IVC folk sailed to the Maldives and left inscriptions there.
See his _The Maldives Mystery_, which, curiously, is a banned book in the
Maldives themselves, although the research was funded by the Maldivian
government with the backing of President Gayoom.
