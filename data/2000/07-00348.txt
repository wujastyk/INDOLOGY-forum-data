(an Alexander in fortune > very lucky person) 

How common is "taqdiir kaa sikandar" as an expression 
in Urdu? in Hindi? 

Any other Indian languages have equivalents (with sikandar)? 

Has Alexander's name been remembered in India/Pakistan ever 
since his trip to Pakistan? 

Do other expressions with 'sikandar' exist in
Urdu and Hindi?
