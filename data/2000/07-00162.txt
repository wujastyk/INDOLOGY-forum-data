Date of Udhayana
Birgit Kellner writes :
If you can show that JnAnashrimitra wrote against theism and also
show that Udhayana was responding to him, your argument would be more
convincing.
As I said before, I find it strange that the top logician of the NyAya
school would write on a subject which was not critical at that point in
time.
Which is where I disagree. For I do not see his dialectic as being relevant
to his times. Unless ofcourse you can prove otherwise.
All this is quite unnecessary - can we practice some objectivity here? I
just raised a few questions. Since you are familiar with Udhayana, all
you've to do is, just show that a post-Shankaran Buddhist philospher raised
arguments against theism and this is what Udhayana responded to. Then the
subject is closed.
Vidhya writes :
It is a greater flaw to think that the schools are totally unrelated. No
school grew in isolation. Each school grew up arguing with the other schools
and that is the way Indian philosphy developed. For eg :
NAgArjuna criticizes Gautama; VAtsyAyana criticizes NAgArjuna; DignAga
criticizes VAtsyAyana; UdhyotakAra criticizes DignAga; Dharmakirti
criticizes UdhyotacAra; VAchaspati criticizes Dharmakirti and so on.
It is like architects building houses. They might have different designs,
different ideas, different ways of expression - but the ultimate goal is the
same - shelter. Likewise for Indian philosophers the ultimate end is
liberation and they're but discussing the same subject from different
angles. Whether you concentrate on the differences or similarities is your
choice - but do not take your stand on one and deny the other.
But is criticism of Buddhism the main flavour of their works? Their attacks
are more directed towards Advaita, since it was the leading philosophical
system by that time. Criticism of Buddhism and other schools is part of the
general philosphical views to be refuted.
Again by this I don't mean that Buddhists were non-existent by that time,
only that they were no more in their prime. By that time, Advaita ruled the
roost.
Since Birgit Kellner points out a Buddhist philosopher whom she claims has
written more profound works than SAntarakshita and Kamalasila and was the
one Udhayana's dialectic is directed against, best thing is to check whether
this philospher has written against the concept of a creator God. If that
were so, it would make sense to say Udhayana is answering his criticism.
Ofcouse, a school which teaches pluralism, atomism, dualistic theism and
most importantly "visesha" - the anti-thesis of the VedAntic unity
underlying all phenomena, would have "heavily" influenced Advaita. But
schools which teach non-dualism, different levels of reality, the unreality
of the world, just because they are nAstika, have no influence on Advaita,
right?
You've misunderstood me. I'm not questioning the NaiyAyika's reason to prove
the existence of a creator. I'm only questioning the time of his
argument,since I do not see anybody raising objections to the theory.
Also it would be an understatement to say that the VedAnti accepts things
just because the shruti says so. If so, why is Shankara providing logical
arguments in support of Advaita? He could have simply said that truth is
Advaita because the shruti says so and taken no further pains. So where
things can be logically explained he takes the effort to do so. Where they
cannot, he takes shelter in the shruti.
And it is not that Shankara has provided no logical background for theism.
He specifically takes care to criticize views which are against a creator
God. But what he doesn't do is try to prove the existence of God by his own
