Subject: Pseudo-Sanskrit text of Our-Father?

I would like to thank everybody who answered me here and off-list.

Maybe it will be of interest to all of you to know that the ChristusRex site lists
Our Father and/or Hail Mary and some other Christian (Catholic) prayers in about
1100 languages and dialects (some of them in many versions), among them in 51
languages from India.
