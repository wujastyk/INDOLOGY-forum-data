wrote her dissertation comparing the two old grammars, the Tamil
Tolkappiyam with Paniniyam. Peter Granda, David McAlpin, ...
have moved to fields requiring scientific/computer/mgmt. skills.
W.H.R. Rivers who studied ethnic Todas in the Nilgiri mountains
who speak a Dravidian language is an M.D. A pioneer in neurophysiology
psychiatry and so on. Jean Filliozat was an M.D., and so on.
Interested in knowing about Indologists who had/have a
