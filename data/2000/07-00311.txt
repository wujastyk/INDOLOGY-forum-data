How do you validate knowledge itself, without getting into
the nature of proof?
I can only say, read the nyAya sUtras, bhAshya and vArttika.
Specifically, sUtras 2. 1. 58-69, 2. 2. 13-21, and the comments
by vAtsyAyana and uddyotakara (note the spelling) thereon.
Aiyo, Rama! Is it too much to expect that one who wishes to
discuss these things should first read about them? The nyAya
and vaiSeshika views of ad.r.s.ta are quite different. And
within nyAya itself, you find changes in its meaning over time.
