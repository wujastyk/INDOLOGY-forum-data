zakti [was vajra], B. Walker's Hindu World
As I recall, V. Raghavan wrote a long review or review article on B.
Walker's _Hindu World_, pointing out that the author/compiler did not have
ability to read primary sources andthat his purpose was more to malign
Hinduism that to enlighten about it. -- aklujkar
