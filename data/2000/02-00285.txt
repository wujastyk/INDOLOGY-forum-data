There are several facts indicating that Rama was a historical figure
which are summarised in these sites by the Dalit and *** schools

  http://dalitstan.org/books/bibai/bibai3.html  (see the appendix also)

Although vague, the Ramayana and Mahabharata probably indicate some form
of history. Remember that Asoka was at one time also considered `mythical'
before the discovery of his inscriptions. Besides, there are no other
historical sources for the period.

As for Pandit Arun Shourie et al's credentials as historians, and
with more entertaining `gems' from *** history books, see the article
published in Dalitstan Journal -
