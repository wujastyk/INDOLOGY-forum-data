Dates of written Rgveda
I am fatigued after this long exchange, and my final post reads:
Language slips as fatigue slips in and neurotransmitters begin to
deplete. "Indus" in such cases may become "Indian." I imagine
that similar things happened to ancient reciters of the Veda,
with the drift sometimes becoming permanent after sufficient
repetitions.
Cheers,
