Your point is well taken. I was not strictly speaking interested in the
Gonds here, I just wanted to clarify a concept since "ethnic" is used quite
widely and should not be confused with "race".

English.

Again point well taken. It is the current meaning that is relevant unless
we discuss older texts where the word is used in another sense (e.g. early
nineteenth century Europeans using the word "race"). But as I pointed out
above: "ethnic/ethnos" in the modern sense of the word cannot and should
not be confused with "race" in the modern sense. That's all. :-)
