I heard in a recent TV news that researchers have revised this conclusion.
There is also some contribution from the father. I am not able to recollect
the source. The broadcast said that conclusions regarding human evolution
(re. Lucy, etc.) and dispersal have to be revised.  Does anybody have the
reference on that? Has anybody looked into how this finding will affect the
present discussion?
