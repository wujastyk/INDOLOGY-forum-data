SamnyAsin names
I've a question on the kind of names given to monks in various Indian
traditions.
Most VedAnta samnyAsins of late seem to be having names ending with "ananda"
- VivekAnanda, BrahmAnanda etc But earlier VedAntins seem to have used their
original names even after taking up samnyAsam - Shankara, GaudapAda,
PadmapAda. But again Madhva seems to have taken up the monastic name of
"VidhyAranya" and Mandana Mishra as SureshvarAchArya (or are they two
different persons?).
Bauddha monastic names seem to incline towards "ghosa", "kirti" etc
Ashvaghosa, Buddhaghosa, Dharmakirti, Chandrakirti. Again NAgArjuna seems to
be pretty unique - was that his original name? Or considering "DignAga", was
"nAga" also a popular Bauddha monastic name?
"Suri" seems to be a popular monastic name for JainA monks - Haribhadrasuri,
Somaprabhasuri etc. But JainAs also use "ghosa" and "kirti".
Any idea on what actually dictated the name-giving? Why certain preferences
among others? Also any information on names in other monastic traditions -
SAmkhya, yoga etc
