Not the politically "aware" Dalits, Tribals and some instances the OBC's

Not just native Kannada and Telugu speakers but also "many" native Malayalam
speakers also believe that their "Mula Basha" is Sanskrit not Tamil and are
enraged when confronted with 'evidence" which is most of the time brushed aside
as western "propaganda". This notion that all languages are derived from
Sanskrit is not a modern development in India but has its origin in many Purans.
