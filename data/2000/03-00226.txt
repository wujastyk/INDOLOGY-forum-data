Saraswati: Atomic Scientists reconfirm location
Congratulations to Dr. Witzel on his excellent series of posts in the last
few days. The `Vedic panzer' post was especially enlightening. And the
following is of course a classic -
On Thu, 9 Mar 2000, Michael Witzel wrote:
This would ordinarily be a coup de grace. However, it is interesting to
note that this same `indigenist' group does not accept these invasions
either, all of which are held to be `western conspiracies' :
 "... the Rajput race is the descendent of ancient Kshatriya families
  (p. 170 HSIB 1). That they had their ancestry in certain invaders is
  dismissed as a conspiracy of western historians."

Perhaps, we shall soon see authoritative websites on `Myth of Saka
Invasion Theory (SIT),' and `Huna Invasion Theory (HIT) debunked'.
Already, D.P.Agarwal has stated that the `Greek Invasion' was no invasion
at all (cf. his polemics on `AIT'). No doubt, this will be followed up by
a `Myth of Greek Invasion Theory (GIT) debunked' website.
Meanwhile, count me in on the Witzel fan club.
