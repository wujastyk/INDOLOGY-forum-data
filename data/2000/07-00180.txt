Membership/Skt. program (Max Mueller)
Subrahmanya:
I was indeed a little wary of my decipherment post which had 11k in my
Eudora program, especially as I saw that my older Telnet showed THE
SAME
message as 14,412 K. Should have split it up. Mea culpa. Though
dealing
with the same topic.
By how by VaruNa, Subrahmanyaaaaa!, do you get 22 k?
standard.
 etc. etc.
<bold>This is the same  Subrahmanya  who alleged:
</bold> S. SUBAAHMANYA:  Fri, 11 Feb 2000:
now Witzel has 'managed' to find Aryan chariot panzers <<<<
Pray, Subrahmanyaaaaa, where did I do that? You did not tell us then,
and
you will not be able to tell us now.  Tasmaat, tuSNIm bhava!
====================================
On another contented point. Max Mueller.
I checked his first edition on a visit to the main library and  found
that
he indeed signed his first edition, first part (1849 = 1906 varSe), p.
XXXI, before start of text,   with:
zArmaNyadezotpanneneMgalaNDadezanivAsinA BhaTTamokSamUlareNa
saMzodhita....
Thus, MokSamUlara; and not moksAmUla (which I remembered) is a later
(Indian)
improvement, based on his "I POINT TO INDIA " etc. involvement with
the
proponents of an *Indian* revival.
Deutsche Welle, Hindi service, today, MONday/Tuesday morning, still
continues with its memorial of Max Mueller in Sanskrit:
