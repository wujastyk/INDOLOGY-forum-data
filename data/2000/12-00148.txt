What you say may be right. Compare the given naRRiNai poem:
   koTiyai vAzi tumpi i nOy
   paTuka til amma yAn2 nin2akku uraitten2a
   mey E karumai an2Ri um cevvan2
   aRivu um karitu O aRan2 ilOy nin2akku E     (naR.277)
Here, the speaker of the poem is the Heroine, and is addressed to a black bee.
She scolds the 'tumpi' (black (male) bee)  with anger and uses "koTiyai"
(cruel/inhuman/harsh). Here, she asks if its 'aRivu'(intelligence in
the heart) is 'dark' (black)? "NOy" (sickness/disease) of the speaker is also
represented in this short poem.
In other instances which are many, the black tumpi is said to be shining like a
black jewel. "maNi niRat tumpi" (jewel-coloured-bee) in kuRuntokai 392,
aiGkuRunURu 215, naRRiNai 17 and so on. Maal-NarayaNa's color (black) is
particularly mentioned in kalittokai 46: 'mAal am ciRai maNi niRat tumpi'.
