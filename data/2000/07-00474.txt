Buffaloes were sacrificed until recently [late 70s] by the DumbAls or DumAls
of Sonepur and Baud in the State of Orissa, though not in what might be called
a temple. These animals were/are sacrificed at the shrine of KhambezvarI or
StambhesvarI [also caled MAhezvarI by them]. References are in the pre-1947
Gazateers [ Sorry, I dont have the bibliographical details]. H. Kulke's
Jagannath Cult book also has references to buffalo sacrifice of the DumAls
[again, no exact bibliography at this timebv]. 
Best wishes,
Jogesh Panda
