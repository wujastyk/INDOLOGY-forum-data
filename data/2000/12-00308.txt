There is atleast one well know nAr/nAl pair where to illustrate
-r-/-L- interchange:
nArikELa, nALikEra, nALikELam = coconut
Obviously nAr- & nAL- here are Ta. nAr = fibre, a defining feature of coconut.
DEDR #3651:
nAr = fibre, string, cord, rope;
nAri = bow-string, fibrous covering at the bottom of a leaf-stalk, as of a
coconut palm

nALikEram is attested in tEvAram:

"veLLai nALikEram viriyA naRum pALai" (tEvAram:106:5)

P. Chandrasekaran.
