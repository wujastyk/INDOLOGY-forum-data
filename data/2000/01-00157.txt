I agree, if Vacaspati's date is 976, rather than 841.
I disagree. The inscription you note indicates that Sankara's influence was
not felt in the Tamil regions before the 11th century. It does not indicate
a greater probability for 900 CE as compared to 800 CE. As I said before,
the evidence indicates only an extension of the range of dates that one
could assign to Sankara. There is a  sufficient number of internal and cross
references in the literary evidence that cannot be ignored. If the
uncertainty is frustrating, welcome to the house of cards that Indian
chronology often can be.
