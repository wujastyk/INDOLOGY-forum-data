Oedipus in Sanskrit?
Well... I actually have a paper that's been sitting *almost* finished
for years (I've presented it a few times) on this. For now, one might
just refer to AK Ramanujan's paper on the Indian Oedipus, and a paper
of Robert Goldman. I can quickly get you the exact references if you
need them. My paper concerns Buddhist versions, which among other
things I believe disprove some of the claims made by Ramanujan and
Goldman. On the other hand, I can see no reason for believing there
to be an Indo-European version that might underlie Indic and Greek
versions.
