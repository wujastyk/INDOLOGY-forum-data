putra
Do the above tamil words like "putu" relate to the Skt. "pota"
(young of a tree or animal)? cUta-pota, zAla-pota, simha-pota etc.,
Another interesting aspect of "putra" is in the town name,
pATali-putra, probably from tamil "putar/putal"=
bush/thicket/low jungle. Any comments on pATali-putra
(pAlibothra)=thicket of pATali flora? Placenames with -putra like
in zala-putra/zali-putra also be considered. Lewis Rice (EI,
no.24, p.334), " pATalika, the village in which sarvanandin made
his copy, may be pATaliputra,  in the South Arcot District.
The periya-purANam makes it the seat of  a large Jaina monastery.
pANArASTra is no doubt the territory of the bANa kings."
