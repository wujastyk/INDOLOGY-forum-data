SOAS Post Doctoral Fellowships
The School of Oriental and African Studies has decided to fund three new
'Millennium' Post-Doctoral Research Fellowships in Oriental Studies. These
will be for two years each, starting from October this year: average
salary will be around ?18,000. The fellowships will be advertised in the
press (The Guardian, Times Higher Education Supplement) within the next
two weeks (prbably in the week commencing 8th May) and details will
shortly be available from the School's Personnel Office (0044 207 898
4144). The closing date has yet to be fixed but will be around the middle
of June, and shortlisted candidates will be interviewed. The aim is to
attract post-doctoral fellows with a good record of research and
publications: they will be available for some teaching.
I thought you might like to know about this in case you know of any
eligible candidates, who should be advised to watch out for the
forthcoming advertisements or who might want to make an application.
