For others interested in the dialacts spoken in and around Magadh are :
Magadhi - South of the Ganges river but east of Sone river in Bihar
Vaishali, Kashi , Gorakhpur ( Kushinagar ) - Close to Bhojpuri -
Buddha was born in Lumbini, close to Gorakhpur . His palace was farther
from Gorakhpur .
Thanks.
