Subject: Devanagari font for LaTeX
Message-ID: <161227058559.23782.3557200333005826618.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the Indoloy list,

I usually use LaTeX to prepare documents and I am thus wondering whether a
devanagari font for LaTeX is available.  If so, how can I obtain it?

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
