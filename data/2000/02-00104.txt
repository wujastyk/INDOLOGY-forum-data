ashvamedha--to eat or not to eat?
Well, just on the anecdotal side then, we should perhaps note that the
reasonably posh and very non-veg restaurant in the Blue Diamond Hotel in
Pune is (or at least was a few years back) named "Ashwamedha" which struck
me as an odd name for an eatery.  Having dined there more than once I am
now, however, relieved by Madhav's information that it was merely "brain
food" they were serving me.  Bon appetit.
