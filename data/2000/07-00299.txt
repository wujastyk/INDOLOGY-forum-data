Faulty logic. We only know the relative order of dates. There
is no strong information about how many years actually separated
Sankara and Vacaspatimisra. One also has to consider the date of
Bhaskara, and those of Buddhist authors who refer to Bhaskara. We
have gone over this issue ad nauseum. E.g. see my earlier post -

<listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE?A2=ind0005&L=indology&D=1&P=22952>.

If you have good reasons to refute this, please specify details.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
