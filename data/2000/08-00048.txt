Rajaram's PILTDOWN horse
Yaroslav Vassilkov quotes MSK Subrahmanya:
Far from repudiating his "horse seal," Rajaram has just sent out
a letter to me, Witzel, Elst, Talageri, and a number of Rajaram's
fellow OITers in which he vehemently defends the seal -- claiming
that I've engaged in "bluff and deception" in attempting to
debunk it. There are lots of threats here about court action,
etc. According to Rajaram:
Rajaram goes on to claim that the reason I've taken him on is
probably tied to:
Can I point out that my research focuses on the links between
neurobiology and cultural evolution -- and that my "research
program centered on the horse and spoke-wheel" is as much a
figment of Rajaram's imagination as the "horse seal"?
I thought Rajaram would repudiate the seal and blame it all on
bad reproductions, as he was gently encouraged to do by K. Elst. Surprise!
