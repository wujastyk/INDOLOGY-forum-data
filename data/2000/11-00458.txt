griffith appendix
When I was working on my book The Vedic People, I asked,through a friend, a Catholic priest to translate into English  what he did not know was  Griffith's Latin version of Rv 1.126.6-7.He  did  the translation  but added  that you should not ask a priest to translate such passages.
