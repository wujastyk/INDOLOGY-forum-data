Respected members,
I apologise before hand if my simple posting disrupts a scholarly discussion
list, but I would like to get some information on a Sanskrit verse.   I
remember only one line which is as follows

  ....."Nirmalam Komalam kavyam".....

I do not remember the other lines of the couplet /verse.

If you could give some details as to the complete verse, the author, source
 etc it would be very helpful.
thanking you,
Sincerely,
M. Bauri
