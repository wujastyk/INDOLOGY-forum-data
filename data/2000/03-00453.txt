Avestan language
Schwartz/UC,  HP Schmidt (emer.) at UC, Insler at Yale, Skjaervo at
Harvard, Windfuhr at Michigan, Malandra at MN,  etc.
Many linguists/Vedic scholars also teach Avestan...
The more Vedic Sanskrit you know the better. Since Avestan is so close to
Vedic, and since Avest. texts are much smaller  in actual size  (3/4 have
been lost after 650 CE) -- and not 'because Alexander burnt them' --  we
use to joke that a Rgveda grammar is the best Avestan grammar,
