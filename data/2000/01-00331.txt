Concerning the discussion between Stephen Hodge and Jonathan Silk about the
meaning 'hail' for azani in the KAzyapa-parivarta:
Words derived from sanskrit azani in some modern Indo-aryan languages (like
Ashkun) seem also to mean 'hail', see Turner CDIAL 910. So it would be
worthwhile to examine whether the word in some of its occurrences has been
misunderstood by modern interpreters of Sanskrit texts.

Best regards,
