I posted to Indology (10/11/99) a while back some reasons why I think

pls.
Yes, the Chinese also were well aware that there was a place in the
Swat Valley region which they understood and transliterated as
"udyaana" in the sense of "parkland" -- recording the local belief
that the area was a parkland belong to Ashoka.  They were sometimes
resident there as it was an important route into India -- there are
detailed Chinese accounts of the region for the C7th & 8th.  These
records are always ignored by people who want to locate the "tantric"
Oddiyana there.
Based on the received idea -- I would not place much value on this at
all.
All secondary material, again working from the assumption that the
"tantric" Oddiyana is there.  No independent research.
Possibly as a result of later Tibetan missionary activities, as Chris
Fynn mentioned yesterday.
I have no problems with your subsequent comments.
Best wishes,
