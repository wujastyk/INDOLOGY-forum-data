Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
Bjarte Kaldhol wrote
by 2200 BC,
I don't have access right now to the reference you provide but I would
like to ask what will probably seem a naive question:  how is the
dating for the Hurrians/Mittani/Kassites fixed ?  I have no problem
with a relative chronology but how is an absolute chronology
determined -- Carbon 14 dating, AMS or even dendrochronology ?   Or is
it fixed from supposed links into Egyptian king-lists ?   If the
latter, what are your views on the hypothesis of several scholars
recently that Egyptian dates for the Middle and New Kingdoms are
erroneous and need to be moved downwards to more recent dates by
several hundred years ?  I know this sounds like the attempts to
redate the RV the other way, but at least in the case of Egypt the
evidence seems fairly compelling.  Ultimately the two questions must
have a bearing on each other vis-a-vis linguistic considerations such
as you have raised.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
