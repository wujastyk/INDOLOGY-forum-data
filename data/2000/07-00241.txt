I do *not* spell it that way. There was an obvious typo in a post of
mine mentioning the Dholavira signboard on July 10. The appearance of
a typo hardly indicates that I spell the word that way. Here's part of
my original post on the topic, from July 7:

That post led over the next few days to a devastating deconstruction
of the supposed Jha/Rajaram "decipherment."

Leaving typos aside, let me point to a substantial error in Ganesan's
post. He writes:

This thread began, back on July 1, with four powerful arguments
*against* te view that there were extensive texts written on
perishable materials in the IVC. To review those arguments -- as I
write this the Indology archives are "down" -- go to:

Those arguments have not been addressed by Ganesan, who did not take
part the later discussion of this issue. Instead of confronting those
arguments, he choses to point to an obvious typo as proof that I
misspelled a word!
