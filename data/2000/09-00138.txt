Sanskrit and PIE
If so, will the Kikkuli text on horse-training written in Hittite
(conventional date: 1380 BCE) represent Rigvedic Aryans recruited out of
India?

        Another theory could be that they were middle men, recruiters rather
than recruits acquiring power by strategic means rather than because of
miltary advantage or access to lots of horses.  The recruits could have been
central asian or peoples with more horse savvy. The ideological motives
religious underpinnings could have been contibuted by a brahmanical
community which has always been adept at legitimizing tribal customs(
including horsey ones ), motivating people to fight wars and giving them a
sense of religious purpose.
        This is similar to whats happened in afghanistan pakistan today. All
that these coutries really provide are a safe haven and a fundamental
ideology. The arms(US, arab, chinese), funds(US, arab) and often even
recruits come from outside from as far away sudan algeria, and chechnya
Jihad is carried out in kashmir, russia and iran altogether a significant
strategic and political  impact.
        This could be COMPLETELY OFF but could not help comparing it with
the modern situation.
