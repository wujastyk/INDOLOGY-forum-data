>?From whence did the wond'rous
   mystic art arise
Of painting speech,
   and speaking to the eye
That we by tracing magic
   lines are taught
How both to colour, and
   embody thought?


Just fyi, in one of her earlier and shorter versions
of her thesis published in a Scientific American
special number publ. 1984, she says that tokens were
found in Chanhu Daro. You may want to check EJH Mackay
for this.

It appears that Near Eastern archaeology has not
turned up even "one example of tokens regarded in the
hypothesis as prototypes of logograms other than
numbers".

We aren't any forr'arder, are we?

Thanks and Warm Regards,
