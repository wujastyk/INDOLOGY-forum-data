Kali's Child and controversy
Friends,
I happened meet Swami Tyagananda here in Boston today and
he was kind enough to give me a copy of his rebuttal to
"Kali's Child" of Jeffrey Kripal.  I spent this afternoon
going through Swami's notes and the paper he presented at AAR.
I have not read "Kali's child".  What appears to me
it's a product of ignorance and immature knowledge in
Sanskrit and Bengali.  It's not clear if the book is written
with a bias or ran out of hand.
Have people read this book?  Do you have an opinion?
Is it an example of Rajaram on the other side?
The greater scare is how many such books are in the making
with cursory knowledge and borrowed translations?
Let 2000 end with these thoughts and let's aim for
cultural research without bias in the coming century!
I will like to hear if anyone has read the book and
has an opinion.
Best regards,
Bijoy Misra
