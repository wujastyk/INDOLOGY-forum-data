Dear Bartje,

Shouldn't one confront the counter-arguments of Mayrhofer before answering
this question:

 _Die Indo-Arier im alten Vorderasien_ 1966.

_Die Arier im vorderer Orient: ein Mythos?_ 1973.

-- nevermind the rather long list of discussions that have followed?

I cite just one remark, from T. Burrows in _The Sanskrit Language,_ Third
Edition, 1973, p. 392:

"There is also a detailed discussion of the subject by A. Kammenhuber....
The work contains valuable discussions, but carries scepticism too far"

Et tu, Bartje?

Best wishes,

George Thompson
