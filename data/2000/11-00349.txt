No Aryan gods in Hurrian treaty?
Dear Bartje,
Shouldn't one confront the counter-arguments of Mayrhofer before answering
this question:
 _Die Indo-Arier im alten Vorderasien_ 1966.
_Die Arier im vorderer Orient: ein Mythos?_ 1973.
I cite just one remark, from T. Burrows in _The Sanskrit Language,_ Third
Edition, 1973, p. 392:
"There is also a detailed discussion of the subject by A. Kammenhuber....
The work contains valuable discussions, but carries scepticism too far"
Et tu, Bartje?
Best wishes,
George Thompson
