Finally, if You want I can - by means of my husband - contact the most
important Italian teachers of ethnomusicology.
All the best,

> Can anyone help me with the following words?   I am struggling to interpret a

> snapping of fingers, clapping of hands, [and] drums."

> The problem is how to render vanaspati and nadi(i).  The first could be read

> am, however, completely at a loss as to how I might interpret the latter as a
> type of instrumental music.  The Tibetan translation is of little help, as it
> does not interpret these terms, reading "groves" (nags tshal) and "streams"
> (chu bo).  Musical as the sounds of groves and streams may be, given that the
> text specifies vaadya, I figure I need to find *instruments* that would
> correspond to these terms.

> Thank you in advance for any assistance.
