The horse problem is not of archaeology but of natural history. We are not
looking for horse bones in human settlements but for wild horse. The
following questions are neighing for answer:

1.Why is the term for horse the same in Rgveda and Avesta?

2.What is the scientific name of  Rgvedic asva/ Avestan aspa ?

3.Is India/Iran the natural habitat of horse? Were there wild asva/aspa in
Indian subcontinent/ Iran ?

4.If yes,when was the horse domesticated? If not, where did asva/aspa come
from?
