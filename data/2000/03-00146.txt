River Sarasvati: Atomic scientists reconfirm location
Amusing:
MW:
Opinions, opinions, opinions. The problem is YOU do not know about RV
tradition. It has been studied at great length for more than 100 years.
That's INDOLOGY.  We know very well the (few) cases where it is deficient.
I suggest, before speculating,  some reading up on oral transmission in
Madhav Deshpande's recent AV Pratisakhya ed. & transl.  & comm.
HOS, Volume 52. Saunak?ya Catur?dhy?yik?. A Pr?tis?khya of the Saunak?ya
Atharvaveda, with the commentaries Catur?dhy?y?bh?sya,
Bh?rgava-Bh?skara-Vrtti and
Pancasandhi, critically edited, translated & annotated by MADHAV M.
DESHPANDE. 1997. Pages, vi, 815.

Even more amusing:
So, now suddenly,  *all* of them INTERPRET their data?  --  That's real
progress...
Finally, I cringe:
Of course, I am aware of Nostratics, as the list archives will show, and
see the MOTHER TONGUE/LONG RANGER website that I have arranged & host:
