Subject: towards a list for professional sanskritists and              archeologists & anthropolog
Message-ID: <161227064441.23782.12798695194036661200.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dr. David Solomon mentioned about
Dr. Raman's opinions about the eventual
decline in Indology pursuits in academic
disciplines.
>But, if not, or even if it is, a little, then perhaps you would do well to
>re-read Prof. Raman's concerns about the future of Indology.  He also
>raises serious concerns that warranted a more considerate answer.

As I recall, it was Dr. J. E. M. Houben who was first
to regret the decline of endowed positions for Sanskrit:
<<<
. . . But with such an Ivory-tower attitude Indologists
should not be surprised to see that chairs for Indology
are not renewed and that funding for their discipline
quickly disappears. Indology, which used to be a
fountainhead of creative ideas for the linguistic and
at that period newly emerging social sciences in the
19th century has now become an area of muddy backwaters
of outdated ideas and  concepts in the religious and
human sciences. [...]
While Indologists may fear the increasingly
"business-like" management of  Universities in view of
the low numbers of students (cf. Deshpande's memo of 25
May), such a "business-like" approach may also take a
positive turn (Lars Martin Fosse's memo 25 May) if it can
be made clear that precious subjects deserve special
treatment: oak bark is weighed per pound but cinnamon by
decagrams. >>


>The proposed criteria for admission are certainly breathtaking: the new
>list will probably be as sparsely populated as the Calvinist heaven.

Dear Sir, Some time ago, Prof. P. Velusamy provided to our dear list
the famous linguist Noam Chomsky's words on this
publication record. Chomsky is different.

Remember due to various nationalisms (eg., Germany)
of the 19-20th centuries, Sanskrit only was fostered.
Now only other classical Indic languages like Tamil
and the extremely valuable data they provide on ancient
India are being realized. Exclusively placing
emphasis on Western journal record is biased
as far as ancient India is concerned.

Following the learned Venerable Tantra, the proposed
list will be with Western Sanskrit-centered
professionals only.

Please note that a list proposed on the exact lines
of Dr. Houben already exists. However, the said
jambudvIpa list founder, Prof. Magnone was
not particularly pleased with almost dead
silence in his list either.
