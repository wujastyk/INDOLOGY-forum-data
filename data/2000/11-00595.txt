Dearest Colleague, many thanks for your kind and useful advice. In effect,
also the Srrngaravairagyatarangini is an anulomaviloma, exactly as "your"
Rasikaranjana. Now, I shall try to find these texts (in, and from, Italy it
is very difficult to do it, alas!).
Hoping to have soon your news,
Your faithfully,
Daniela
