wanted: Buddhist invocation (Skt / Pali)
The best known invocation in ancient India, for others
as well as Buddhists, was "Om Namah Siddham".
The Siddham script used by Buddhists in China/Japan
is sometimes said to have been named because of this
invocation.
It was very common to start any formal instruction
with this invocation.
