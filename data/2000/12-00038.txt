genetic markers revisited
The question of genetic markers from the father's and mother's  side  easily  lends itself to flippancy,but remains a non-trivial question.It would be instructive to obtain twin marker data from the same set of people to  see what  they say.If the Vedic people came from outside, then  this exercise could throw  light on the numbers involved.It has been argued (by Madhav Deshpande,for example) that the Vedic royalty married women from outside their pale (Satyavati is one example).As a test case from relatively recent times one could look at the north western  Indian population which presumably absorbed the Greeks who came before,with and after Alexander.
Genetic studies cannot possibly distinguish between invasion and  migration.
