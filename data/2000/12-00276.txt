Namaskar,

No problem with that. But then please refrain from
passing comments or judgements on others' battles.

These are needless and erroneous judgements. Who are
you to declare others version "closed-minded and
racist"? Why should you then object when others call
your version as colonial, obsolete, biased, recist and
unscholarly?

Yet another judgement coming from ivory towers. Mean
actions soon after preaching great words!

Nobody is forcing you to read anything and respond to
that. Use DELETE botton and step aside from what you
are not interested in.
