Potter's wheel (was: pseudo-chariot wheel)
I agree that there is a common misconception.
In South India, one commonly finds Potters' wheels
spoked, and not discoid.
Dr. Palaniappan, I think, talked about it here
long ago.

As Rajaram and Jha, along with many autochthonists, want to
let the horse-rich Rig Veda precede the Indus Civilisation
(2600-1900 bce), they need Indus horses and chariots badly.
The Piltdown horse seal now proves their point! They also
find an Indus sign which looks like a spoked wheel (but which
may be the south Indian potter?s wheel-or just about anything
else).
