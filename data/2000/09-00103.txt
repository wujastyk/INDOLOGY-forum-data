Sanskrit and PIE

e.g., carbon
Though not well-publicized, some material from the grave of
Tutankhamun (son of Akhenaten) was carbon-dated and the dates seem to
confirm the revised chronology.  However, those who prefer to retain
the conventional dating get out of this difficulty by claiming
(unconvincingly ?) that this material derives from the time
Tutankhamun's tomb was resealed following a break-in by grave-robbers.
It seems as though Egyptology is yet another field where evidence is
treated selectively :)
