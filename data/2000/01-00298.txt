Hail
I wonder if anybody can tell me what areas of the Indian sub-continent
have hail -- I would imagine fairly northly, north-western regions.  I
have a Sanskrit Buddhist text that mentions hail-storms and I suppose
that the authors would have been with such weather conditions.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
