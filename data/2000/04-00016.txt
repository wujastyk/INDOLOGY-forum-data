smArta opinion(s) about organ donation: a query
Dear members,
a reporter asked to a friend of mine if it is possible to obtain some news
about "hindU" opinion(s) about the ethical problem of organ donation. I
suppose that in this context "hindU" could mean smArta. Before launching
this query I had some doubt, because I am not able myself to configurate
a competence, an adhikAra of smArta people about contemporary ethical
questions of this kind.
Anyway, if someone has something to say with regard to the query, any
suggestion will be welcome.
Thank You,
Alberto Pelissero
