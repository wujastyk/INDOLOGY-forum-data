Revised release of CSX, CSX+ and CARB fonts
I have released revised versions of Times_CSX, and of the CSX+ and
CARB fonts that are available from http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk.
The revisions affect ONLY the Type 1 PostScript forms of the fonts,
and ONLY the PC versions of these -- most people will be completely
unaffected by the change, and will have no reason to upgrade.
The only change is to the .pfm files, which have been revised to allow
Windows systems to group the fonts properly as font "families".
