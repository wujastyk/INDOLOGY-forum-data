One may point to the older monograph of Robert van Gulik:

Another aspect that comes to mind is the Hayagrivastotra ascribed to Vedantadesika.
I think there was recently written a Ph. D. thesis on this work. Unfortunately I do
not remember the particulars. Perhaps you should look into the Dissertation 
Abstracts.
