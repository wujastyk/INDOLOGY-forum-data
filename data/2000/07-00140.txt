I suggest that we let Dr. Elst post and explain in detail the
Jha/Rajaram decipherment of the Dholhira sign, as previously
suggested. Any and all flaws in their system can be analyzed easily
enough once we have some empirical evidence in front of us. I'm
personally damn curious to see how a "Late Vedic" Sanskrit text is
drawn from a third millennium inscription!
