Death of Prof. J. W. de Jong (1921-2000)
I have been asked to make an announcement of the recent death of Prof. J.
W. de Jong on 22 January 2000 last.
He died here in Canberra after a brief illness.
Full obituaries and appreciations of his contributions to the scholarship
in Buddhist studies, Indology, Chinese studies etc. will appear in due
course in appropriate journals, including the Indo-Iranian journal (IIJ)
which he helped found in 1955.
