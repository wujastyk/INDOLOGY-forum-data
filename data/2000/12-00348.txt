In response to Stephen Hodge's posts

Defense of Euhemerism as a theoretical possibility is one thing.  Defense of
Shendge's books on Vedic is quite another.  These books are fantastic
misinterpretations of Vedic. That is an inescapable fact that makes your
theoretical defense of them moot.

Look at these books.  You will see what I mean.  In short, Steve Farmer is
not being closed minded here at all, as you seem to suggest.  He is merely
stating what is obvious.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
