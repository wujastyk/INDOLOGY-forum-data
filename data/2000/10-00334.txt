I wrote that after reading postings by those considered to be very well
qualified indologists .
Reading the right literature was always emphasized right from the
childhood . We all know that India was not governed by its majority of the
people for centuries . The history and literature of India would have very
different varieties due to this reason.
If one is not carfeful in selecting the literature, in spite of the very
hard work, the views so formed would be far away from the truth .
Hence the comment.
