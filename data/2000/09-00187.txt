cinnamastaa
Dear Ravi,
Benard's recent book is a good one:
Benard, Elizabeth Anne.  _Chinnamastaa: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu
Tantric Goddess_, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1994.  (Good work +
bibliography)
David Kinsley's books (_Hindu Goddesses_ and _Tantric Visions of the Divine
Feminine: the Ten Mahaavidyaas_) have references too.
Hope this helps!
Best Wishes,
Stuart
