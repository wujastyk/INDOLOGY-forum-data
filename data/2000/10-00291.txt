"Science" in India

I didn't "interview one student in Stanford." I've talked to
dozens of Indian engineers and graduate students about the issue.
Moreover, the discussion didn't begin with my "absurd
generalizations" about education in India, but with the scathing
recent review of Indian science in OUTLOOK, seen at:

All I added were my comments on the links between the Hindu
mythologizing of history and Indian engineers (in the US and
elsewhere). The nonsense that Kak, Rajaram, et al. dish out could
not come from anyone even with a moderate training in philology
or ancient history in general.
Misra writes:
I know many of them. The question in this forum is whether being
a engineer qualifies you to speak on Indological issues,
especially when you come from a system that mistakes narrow
technological training for a broader education. This is a problem
in US schools as well, but at a lesser level. It is much less of
a problem in most European school systems.
