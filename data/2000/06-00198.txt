Again, SANSKRIT broadcasts + M.Muller
Listened to  the  Skt. broadcast  of Deutsche Welle/Cologne's today.
Again about Max Mueller (already 7th installment), since it is his 100th
anniversary, --
but different from yesterday's Hindi broadcast, and much more  detailed:
about his early studies at Paris (with Burnouf) & stay in London in
connection with peroparing his RV + Sayanabhasya  edition, his relationship
with D. N. Tagore, etc. etc.
The woman announcer has a very clear voice and does not speak very quickly.
So, perfect for 2nd year+ students.

The Sanskrit section  is in the third part of the program, after Hindi
news, sports,  etc.

then the Tuesday program (Hindi only) will kick in.
Next  Skt. program 2 weeks from now.
