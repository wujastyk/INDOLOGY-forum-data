Then why in popular Tamil usage 'black'is associated with evil? For
example, I have seen posters by political parties about Mr.Pandyan, the ex-
speaker of Tamilnadu Assembly. One poster in Tamil I have seen excoriates
him as "karuppu bhoothamey" i.e. black devil? has such a usage or similar
usages any precedence in Tamil literature
