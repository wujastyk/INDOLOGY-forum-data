Here it is precisely. They have put themselves into a
very fine mess. But again, this is fundamentally an
ethnic-White or "westerner" problem; and one that they
had better get over pretty quick. It's preposterous.
Listen. What "some" are proposing amounts to nothing
less than a "fortress listserv" mirroring the
traditional "exclusive enclave" concept of _global
rule by a minority of superior beings_. Ladies and
gentlemen, let's get real. We are standing at the
threshold of an entirely new Indology where the
romantic myth of *scholarship* can no longer be
accepted as a valid methodology. Unprepared members
might consider skulking elsewhere.

negotiations continue to be conducted with compassion

Excuse us again sir, but the "contentions homily"
simply doesn't accord with advanced methodology. This
is nothing personal. This is universal.
