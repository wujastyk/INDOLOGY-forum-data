Yogic Texts: Gorakhaanth
Dear members,
I have found online translations of two texts
pertaining to the yogic tradition of Gorakhaanth: 1)
Gorak.sa Zataka* and 2) Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati.** I
have a three questions.
1. Is the text ?Gorak.sa Zataka? (Hundred Verses of
Gorak.sa) considered to be Gorakhaanth?s only
surviving treatise?
2. May I assume that the title ?Siddha Siddhanta
Paddhati? the same as the ?Gorak.sa Paddhiti??
3. Is the ?Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati? a later
commentary on the ?Gorak.sa Zataka,? or is it supposed
to be composed by Gorakhaanth?
Best regards,
Ven. Tantra
