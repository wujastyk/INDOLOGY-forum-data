Early Sankhya
I am interested in doing some research on "Early Sankhya" i.e. the Sankhya
described by Charaka in the Charak Samhita, and by Panchashikha (in the
Mahabharata). Presumably it is this version of Sankhya that was the original
Sankhya (due to which Kautilya grouped Sankhya with the Nyaya-Vaisesik and
Lokayata as a "logic based philosophy"). In this version of Sankhya,
"purusha" does not exist independently of "prakriti", but is a constituent
of it. If any work has been done on this version of the Sankhya in recent
times, i would like to know about it.
Thanking you
