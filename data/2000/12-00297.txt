white as unblemish
This is a perfectly valid question: <What hapened then?>
Translation:  Why didn't I keep my promise to shut up?
Answer: A number of bona fide members of the group asked me publicly and
privately not to get out abruptly, but stay on and give my two cents worth now
and again, even if some people object.
But don't worry. I won't be here for long.
Best regards,
