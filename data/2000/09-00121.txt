Dr. Gupta:

             Iron making was reported to be around 1200 BCE in the
following reference:

Biswas A. K.  1996  - Minerals and Metals in India .

So, it did not take that long , if at all , for iron making to travel from
the west to east .

The metallurgy in India was fairly well developed by the dates you mention
about Hitites .
