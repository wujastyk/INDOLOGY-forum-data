parallels to a key word in a Sunda/Upasunda story
In the traidional south indian society, there used be an office of
"Madhyasthan", which as the name implies middle man or arbitrator. I
remember seeing this word appear in a Tamil inscription quoted in Burton
Stein book "Peasant State and Society in Medievel South India"
