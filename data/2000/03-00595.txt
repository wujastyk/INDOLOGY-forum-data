How it is different: well, very simple, the Christian calendar continues to
use the birth of Christ at its starting point, but that doesn't mean that
every text which uses that calendar will also anachronistically claim that
the birth of Christ is taking place at the time of writing.  The VJ is not
merely using a calendar and mentioning its ancient starting-point, it is
saying that certain stellar configurations are visible at the time of
writing.
Rather unlikely.  Even in the Hellenistic world, the shift from sidereal to
tropical only took place with Ptolemy (2nd century AD), who by himself
conditioned the whole European and Arabic traditions of astro-logy/nomy to
use r-the tropical Zodiac.
