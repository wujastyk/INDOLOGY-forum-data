1. In some Caribbean and Latin American communities too the term<negrito>
(meaning little black one) is often used, like Kaloo in North India,  as a term
of endearment.

2. One may still ask if  there are Tamil Brahmins who would name their children
karuppan? And if not, why not? Please understand that I am not here to pass
value judgments, to attacking or defend anybody, much less to pick up a fight,
I am just wondering.

3. The fact is, black people don't  regard blackness in the same negative way
as many non-blacks do.

4. Although <varna> classification does take color as a basis (at least in its
description), I rather doubt that prior to their encounter with the <white
(Caucasian) people> the Tamils looked down upon people with dark skin color. I
have no proof positive for this, but this is my gut feeling, based on my modest
acquaintance with classical Tamil literature.
