Occidentalism
Images of the West; Edited by James G. Carrier,

Occidentalism
A Theory of Counter-Discourse in Post-Mao China
Xiaomei Chen, OUP, 1995
After Edward Said's celebrated Orientalism in which he characterized
cross-cultural appropriation as being intrinsic to Western imperialism, Xiaomei
Chen argues that the appropriation of Western discourse - what she calls

contemporary non-Western culture. Using China as a focus for analysis, Chen
examines various cultural and political East and West interrelations.
