But my problem is that I have no time for such studies. I would have liked
to see one or two arguments in favour of an immigration theory and a
reference to the "striking affinities" with Ural-Altaic languages (which
may not have existed in any known form in the fourth millennium!). Anyhow,
affinities with other languages cannot prove an immigration into India.
Best wishes,

For a starter, you might look at my paper "Pre-?Rgvedic convergence
between Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) and Dravidian?  A survey of the issues
and controversies." In:  Ideology and status of Sanskrit:
Contributions to the history of the Sanskrit language, ed. by J. E.
M. Houben, 17-58.  Leiden: Brill.  1996.  In the paper I give a brief
and, I hope, fair overview of various pertinent theories and their
problems.  The bibliographical references should open the way to
further, more in-depth presentations of the various views.

Best wishes,
