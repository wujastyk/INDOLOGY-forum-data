Re: Kinship systems
Dear Sir
Thanks for your esteem, but the appellation Indologist is a bit pre-mature
Would you give an exception for Tamil Muslims of Srilanka who claim separate
ethnicity.? And why should this privilege be available to "dravidians" which
is not available to Bosnians
When you say " Among most Dravidians ethnicity and language coincide" , on
what observational basis you make this claim. To some extent this is a
circular argument: You have already defined Dravidian both as an ethnic term
and a language group. To properly make your claim, you must ask the people
whom you consider as Dravidian language group speaking - like Malaylam,
Gond, Brahui- and ask them to name their ethnicities. If the majority or
even the sizable number of  Kannada speakers, Gond Speakers, Tamil speakers,
Brahui speakers name their ethinicity as 'dravidian' , then you are
justified. Is that the case.
But as far I can see, you have interviwed only Andree Sjoberg who does not
seem to be a speaker of Gond or Brahui , to make this claim.
Pray tell us what is the "original mother tongue" of the French and the
Bengalis
We are not discussing ancient history, but your methods of arriving at your
conclusions
