Vidya,
  It seems to me you're overlooking a phenomenon such
as the Bhagavatapurana which in its philosophical
position, is known to be closer to advaita than
anything non-Sankaran. Perhaps it may make sense to
view this purana as an attempt to present the AzvAr
bhakti in an advaitic light.
  Significantly, Ramanuja does not quote it despite
proximity in geography and time.
Thanks and Warm Regards,
