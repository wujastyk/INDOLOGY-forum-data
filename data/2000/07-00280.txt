As the Scope document for this list clearly states (see
www.indology.org.uk), this list is intended for the exchange of ideas
between university-level workers in classical Indian studies.  If you do
not have a degree in Sanskrit, Persian, Tamil, or a related field of
classical Indian studies, or regularly attend professional Indological
conferences, or subscribe to the Indological journals, you are welcome to
lurk on the list, but please refrain from participating, especially with
long postings on matters you feel passionate about.
I am responding to a posting by Dr Gupta, who provocatively opens his
message with an announcement of his lack of adhikaara for this list, but I
am addressing this to all members.
