Indology's future?
V. V. Raman referred to "the intrinsically aggressive and inquisitive
nature of
Western culture."  Acquisitiveness and aggressiveness may be related
but may not be, it depends on the circumstances, time, and personnel.
Would Dr. Raman also recommend non-Westerners stop investigating
Western culture, such as nuclear physics and computer science,
ordinary language philosophy and deconstructionism?  Is the study of
these also a manifestation of aggressiveness and inquisitiveness?
