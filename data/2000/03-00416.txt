BTW, was the Periyapuranam translated into other
languages e.g., Telugu or Kannada? It is said that the
Virasaiva vacanakaras revered the "aRupattimUvar"
i.e., the 63 Tamil saiva saints and that their legends
were current in the Kannada speaking land at that
time. It'd be interesting to know how these stories
were transmitted? In the original Tamil as, for
example, the Ramayana of Kampan?
Perhaps the Madhavadigvijayam (14th cent?) and the
Periyapuranam (13th cent?) draw from a common source?
Thanks and Warm Regards,
