I know whom you're talking about. I spoke with him yesterday.
Unfortunately, he is busy right now trying to prove that Egyptian
hieroglyphics are really an early form of Swedish, and this is *hard,
time-consuming work*. I don't think you can expect any new groundbreaking
analyses in the field of Harappan studies from him for next few months.
Best regards,
