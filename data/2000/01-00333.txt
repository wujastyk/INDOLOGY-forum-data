Dating the Veda: Using the Horse and Planets

This is very interesting.
I wonder though can we date the Ramayana and Mahabharata using content?
I think that's difficult because of problems with interpolation,
understanding of archaic language, etc.
However, if we are to use the Vedas for semi-historical purposes,
chariots would be more revealing than horses.
Under present theories, when do Central Asian chariots first appear
in the Indian archaeological record?
