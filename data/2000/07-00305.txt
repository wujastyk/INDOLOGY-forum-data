Date of Udhayana
I do not think the concept of svatah praamaanya vaada and
pratah praamaanya vaada of the Miimaamsakaa and the Naiyaayika
are as simple as this. The main point of these doctrines is
to check the validity of knowledge itself - that which you
"know" - from the pramaanas.
I accept that for the Miimaamsakaa since some knowledge is
intrinsically valid, he would accept the shruti the same way.
But again for the Miimaamsaka other kinds of knowledge are
not intrinsically valid - like the testimony of wise men,
since the validity of the testimony is inferred from the
trustworthy character of the person.
Basically the NaiyAyika stand is that at the time of cognition
knowledge is neutral and it is only later that the question of
the validity of knowledge arises. The validity of knowledge is
dependent on external factors like some excellence in the
causes of knowledge or the fruitful activity it gives rise to.
But Miimaamsakaa refutes this on the grounds that mere freedom
from defect and contradiction is enough to generate valid
knowledge. And for them the concept of "neutral" knowledge is absurd.
Validity of knowledge and belief in its validity arise simultaneously along
with knowledge itself.
So the stress is basically on validating knowledge itself and
does not relate to proving things by logic.
If what you say is true even earlier NaiyAyikas should have
done the same thing. But we see neither Gautama nor VAtsyAyana
or UdhyotakAra fighting for the cause. And also NyAya along
with Vaishesika believes in adhrsta or the unseen power which
moves the world. How can you provide logical arguments for such
a concept? And we find that whenever they are unable to prove
something by logic, they immediately take shelter in adhrsta.
This hardly matches the description of somebody who has to
prove everything by logic.
