I'm a student of Sanskrit and Tamil at the University of Pisa; I'm studying
the works of Henrique Henriques, a well-known jesuit, scholar of tamil.

Unfortunally it has not been easy to find books, articles and works
(manuscripts and printed books) on him and of his; could someone give me
further information?
I thank everybody in anycase
Francesco Paolo Villani
