RAJARAM EPISODE - BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION
Kak, Frawley and Feuerstein mention in their book that cryptological theory
(with assumptions that they do not state in the book ) shows that for the
Indus script, a minimum string of 20 characters is required to be able to
demonstrate a decipherment ( I guess, "beyond reasonable doubt").
I do not understand the result or the assumptions necessary to derive it.
I imagine that their assumptions include that the language is Sanskrit-like.
I think the results mean that an incorrect decipherment can map short
strings to valid Sanskrit words and phrases with high probability (e.g.,
Rajaram-Jha) and only beyond a certain string length is an incorrect
decipherment likely to be unable to decipher the string to valid Sanskrit.
With more general assumptions, I imagine an even longer text is required to
establish a decipherment.
