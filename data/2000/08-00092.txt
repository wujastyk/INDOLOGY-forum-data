Harappan animal icons/inscriptions

I do not know - as we found, Mahadevan's identifications of the depicted
creatures can sometimes be misleading. But I have no other material - so here
is what I found there (just a sample, there may be others): four different
texts, always on seals (the last one on seal impression), each appearing with
the "unicorn", but also with some other animal as well.

(Steve, have you overlooked it ? I have actually sent you this off-list, on
02.08.)
I do not have the relevant statistics yet - just a strong visual impression,
and of course that can be pretty much misleading. I think that the
overwhelming majority of the texts appear only once; BUT if you have a
duplicate, chances are high that you find a third one - even as many as
twenty. But it seems that the really long series are from tablets: copper in
Mohenjo-daro, stone, terracotta or faience in Harappa.
Perhaps someone else knows more about it? The data do seem interesting and
relevant.
