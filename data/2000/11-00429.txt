Betreff: Griffith's Manner on RV.61.5-9


Griffith transltated RV.61.5-9 in Latin and passed over it to his appendix.
Moreover the stanza 5-8 in Latin, but 9 in English again. He added that the
whole passage is difficult, obscure, unintelligible... .
A professor make a joke that the stanza is too obscene to translate, but
seriouslly, was it a usual manner to do this in his days?
Any antiquus can guess or read his mind?

Dear colleague, in case you mean by RV 61,5-9 RV 10,61,5-9 so are these
verses really "obscene", and it is clear that Griffith prefered to translate
the passage into Latin. - More astonishing is that an Indologist still uses
after Geldner?s translation the totally outdated Griffith.
