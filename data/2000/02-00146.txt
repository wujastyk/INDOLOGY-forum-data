I agree with you.
However, to use your analogy, Indology is a forum for aficionados of old
guidebooks. Its purpose is to ask questions like: Who really wrote this
guidebook? Did he borrow from previous guidebooks? Did other people add to it
later? Why did he choose this word? Does this word mean the same thing in all
the different guidebooks? Why is a different word used in a different edition
of the same guidebook? Are these guidebooks talking about the same mountain,
a different mountain, or just a foothill? And so on.
The benefit for a mountain climber is that all this puzzling should produce a
more reliable guidebook.
