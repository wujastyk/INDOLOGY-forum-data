posts. From that momemnt you keep trading one unsubstantiated allegation
after another
  That makes your allegation even
I am not alleging anything but a social observation. IT IS RELEVANT to the
Indological discussion to the extent of comparing social reality with
textual ideals. I hardly spent few lines by way of doing that, but you seem
to have too many bees in your bonnet and vehemenatly deny my conclusions
I did not say that. You are reading imaginary lines in my post. If A calls
B black (either pejoratively ot not) and does not refer to himself as
black, the simplest conclusion is he does not consider himself to be black.
Here A and B stand for collections, not individuals. When I pointed this

 The use of
Above is a typical incoherant statement made by you. How does it impinge on
my basic literacy in Tamil?
elections
power
I stand corrected. IN fact as soon as sending my last post, I realised
that, but waiting for you to jump on that mistake
Your argument is based on making character imputations for reasoning. I
have heard Tamil people say "Appirikka Azhage" in a snide way and I stand
by the evident of my senses, your foaming and frothing notwithstanding

I never implied only Dravidian parties are guilty of using racist slur.
Again you are reading imaginary lines in my post.
You cannot take Kamban's verse as a social statement. If you go by a
Christian text viz Bible, all people are to love each other. Are you going
to say all christians do nothing but love each other and others?
Sure .It is not. But small statements of the descrepency between textual
ideals and social realities does not make it less of Indology. It is you by
intemperate posts make it longer and longer
I am tired of replying to your foaming and frothing. This is my last reply
to you
