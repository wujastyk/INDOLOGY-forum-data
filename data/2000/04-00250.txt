The University of California (UC) presents electronic editions of
over 50 academic titles in the fields of African, Middle Eastern, and
South Asian studies; Classics; Literature; and European History. The
editions offer frames that include the text itself and a detailed
table of contents. The texts are available free for online browsing
and study, but, of course, cannot be downloaded. Those who want their
own copies can purchase them online (click on "View UC Press Catalog
Page" under the desired text's title). "UC Press E-Editions is a
joint effort between The University of California Press and The
University of California Library at Berkeley, and has received
substantial support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation." [DC]
