Technical Terminology of Shastraic Sanskrit
Dear List members,
                  In the Shastras and darshanas of Sanskrit, one comes
across various technical terms. each Shastra has its own technical
terminology which it defines. It is often noticed that the same technical
term has been employed in different knowledge domains with different
connotations.For example, the term upasarga stands for 'semantic modifier'
in Vyakarana ; in Ayurveda, it stands for 'the ailment that gets imposed on
a basic disease, a secondary ailment'; in Yoga Sutras, it stands for
'impediment' or 'obstruction'.
My question is, what are the dictionaries or reference works that one can
refer to in this regard. I will be grateful for any information on
this matter.
Thanking you in advance.
