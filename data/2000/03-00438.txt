Here we go again, inner city in the US is a euphemism for crime, non-Anglo culture,
poverty etc and is a stereotypical term with negative connotations. If you say
inner cities schools are full of racial tension then you are misinforming the
world regarding what is really going on in the US. It is the suburban schools,
which have racial tension that too directed against the minorities who are
moving into the suburbs. Sorry guys :-) again!!
