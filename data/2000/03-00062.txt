[ADMIN]  ICHR controversey
I should like to thank the participants for their views -- sometimes
exceptionally well expressed -- on this important topic.  However, I think
that I should now ask everyone to take this discussion off-list, and to
allow space for more narrowly-defined indological topics.
With thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
