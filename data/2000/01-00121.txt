Subject: Looking for info on Grantha script

For a look at the Grantha alphabets:
1) K. Venugopalan, A primer in Grantha characters, South Asia books.
A large importer of Indian books in the US, SA books' URL is:
http://www.southasiabooks.com. You can order it through SA books.
I think Dr. James Nye (jnye at midway.uchicago.edu) got this
published.

The first Western grammar for Sanskrit uses the Grantha characters.
It is reprinted:
2) Paulinus a S. Bartholomaeo, Dissertation on the Sanskrit language.
A reprint of the original Latin text of 1790, together with an
introductory article, a complete English translation, and an index
of sources by Ludo Rocher. Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and
History of Linguistic Science. Series III - Studies in the History
of Linguistics. Volume 12. (Amsterdam: John Benjamins B.V., 1977).

If you can't get these books, I can mail you a photocopy.
Is it OK to photocopy, because it is only for an
academic & non-commercial purpose and to revive the ancient
and aesthetic Grantha font?

With kind regards,
N. Ganesan
