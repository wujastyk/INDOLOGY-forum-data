It is a good hope [ drummed out of Academia ] but unlikely to happen.
History is used to argue both for and against India's nationhood; and that
argument can even be quite violent, as you are aware if you follow the news.
So, history is politicized, and that pollutes Academia.

Fraud of a similar kind ( false and misleading conclusions from a
statistical model) and far greater consequence has been perpetrated by the
psychometrians ("The Bell Curve") and none of them has been drummed out of
[US] academia to my knowledge.  In fact, they occupy tenured positions in
many major US universities.
