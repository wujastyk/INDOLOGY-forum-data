thANDA in Bengali
thANDA = 'cool' in Bengali.
Does this have any relations with the foll.?:
tamil taN- = 'cold';
'taNNIr'= cold water; 'taNNATi'= cooling glasses;
Also, taTuman2 (spoken out as 'taDuman')= common cold;
taLarvu = weak, growing old, and hence, becoming 'cold'.
taL-/taD-/taN- can easily give birth to tANDA.
(naL-/naD- 'reed'; pa_lu/paNDu = 'fruit'; ku_li/kuNDu= 'pit' etc.)
Or, Bengali thANDA 'cool' is from IA or Persian and,
has nothing to do with Dravidian??
