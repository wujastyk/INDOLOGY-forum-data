I would like to call the List's attention to a pertinent article on this
matter:

"Temple desecration in pre-modern India," by RICHARD M. EATON

 the first part of which has appeared in the most recent issue of *Frontline*
--
 Volume 17 - Issue 25, Dec. 9 - 22, 2000

Many thanks to T. Mahadevan for calling it to my attention and suggesting
that it be forwarded to the list.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
