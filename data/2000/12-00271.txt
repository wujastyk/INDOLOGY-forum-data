Violence in Indian historical process
I would like to call the List's attention to a pertinent article on this
matter:
"Temple desecration in pre-modern India," by RICHARD M. EATON
 the first part of which has appeared in the most recent issue of *Frontline*
 Volume 17 - Issue 25, Dec. 9 - 22, 2000
Many thanks to T. Mahadevan for calling it to my attention and suggesting
that it be forwarded to the list.
Best wishes,
George Thompson
