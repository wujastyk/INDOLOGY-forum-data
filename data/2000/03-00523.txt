That's even better for my purpose.  That would make it one more of the many
cultural items often claimed as "pre-Aryan Indian" but in fact attested also
in European IE cultures, e.g. the Pashupati seal of Mohenjo Daro returning
as the Cernunnos depiction on the Gundestrup cauldron, or Shiva's trident
returning in Poseidon's iconography and as a national symbol of Ukraine.

It is at any rate not me but the Discover editor who identified the tattooed
points as acu-points.

Unfortunately, no.  This line of research is only beginning, as far as I'm
concerned, though general studies comparing the Chinese and Indian systems
certainly must have been done by someone somewhere.
