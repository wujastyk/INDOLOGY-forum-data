I'm delighted someone has started a new list for Indological
discusions.  Good luck!

Rajiv seems to suggest that the present INDOLOGY list does this; of course
it does not.  The list is unmoderated: postings are never censored, and
all postings to the list are circulated.  Researchers are not exiled for
their opinions about INDOLOGY, but I have recently cancelled the
subscriptions of some people who I considered had insulted other members
of the list.  This action was taken because of their bad manners, not
because of any particular academic view they might espouse.

NO NO NO NO!!!  P l e a s e  do not do this.  As Brigit has already noted,
all that will happen is that your message will be posted ao the 640 other
members of INDOLOGY, and you will still not have joined the new list.

With Egroups, it is by far better to connect with the Egroups website, and
join your list.  That way, you get much more control over the details of
your subscription, you get to choose a password, and so forth.

Don't just "reply" in your email program!
