Indological reprint wishlist
B. Delbrueck, Altindische Syntax, Halle a/d S. 1888 would in my view deserve
a reprint. It was already reprinted in 1968 (Darmstadt, Wissenschaftliche
Buchgesellschaft) but is now apparently out of stock.
Where is A.A. Macdonnell's Vedic Grammar (the "larger one") available?
