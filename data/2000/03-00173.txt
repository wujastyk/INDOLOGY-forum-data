utkuTika
Dear list members,
    I was hoping someone might be able to affirm or deny the following
question regarding the iconography of narasiMha.  The *utkuTika* pose (legs
crossed with heels touching the ground) is a pose exclusive to the
yoga-narasiMha mUrti.
    There is supposed to be some reference to this in the VaikhAnasAgama
(patala 58), but I do not have access to this work presently.  Any help or
further references would be most appreciated.
Sincerely,
B. Fleming
