Self-discovery
Bhagawaan Buddha gave impulse to the Dharma Cakra that resulted into Dharma
Cakra Pravartanam in the Ancient India.Vartanaa means frequency and
Pravartanaa means angular frequency.A wheel rotates.Dr.Mathivanan,Dr.Kak,
Dr.Ganesan,Dr.Kochhar,Dr.Rajaram,K.D.Sethna,all had given new angular
velocity to the wheel of Self-discovery(Right word by Dr.V.V.Raman).There
is going to be some wobble in the beginning.There is no reason for anybody
to conform with the "Standard Model of Indology" of one group or with the
same of the other group.Is not the purpose of research is to bring out the
originality? There could evolve a third model of the pre-history of India
different from AIT or OIT in future. Would we like to believe that future
of "Self-discovery" is impotent? The need of the present is to respect
"Anekaanta-vaada" of Jains and not to polarize or politisize the process.I
like the idea of Dr.Zydenbos of Indians starting Europology departments.But
are Indians spending enough money on Self-discovery? To the best of my
knowledge, no detailed response was produced to the research paper of Prof.
Witzel(Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan,June1999,67pages)by equally
qualified, equally paid and equally equipped professor of Linguistics from
the Indian University.Let us have coffee together but no joint statement.
Indoloy needs less rhetoric and more archaeological facts, Rules of Sound
changes between Tamil and Sanskrit and many more things.Let us work
together!
