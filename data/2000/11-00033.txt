words in Sanskrit !!! Can somebody help me ? >>

Raghu Vira's Consolidated Great English-Indian Dictionary of Technical Terms
(Nagpur, 1950) is a very useful source.  Raghu Vira, a good Sanskritist, did
his best to find Sanskrit words in the extant literature and to coin new
words when he couldn't find old ones.
