Basque and Tamil related?
Just one for today : Basque syntax is very close to that of Dravidian
languages and has nothing to do with IE syntax, Sanskrit included.
But the same can be said of Magyar, Finnish, Samoyed, Maya, Japanese,
Turkish and many others.  I'll continue tomorrow for it is late and I fall
asleep !
