Is there an Indian Connection to Ptolemy's Fraud of Data ?
It has been published in a book by a professor at Baltimore that Ptolemy
fudged the data . Those observations could not have been made in Egypt .
This professor writes that those were from those of a Greek whose name
started with a letter H.
I have read a book by Kaye on Hindu Astronomy . He mentions that this
astronomy , prior to Ptolemy, was indigenous but later on ( post second
century A.D. ) , were essentially borrowed from Ptolemy's ideas. The Hindu
Astronomers would include those in the Vikramaditya's court, and later on .
It appears very surprising to me that the whole school of Indian thinking
would change so quickly .
At least, the truth should be known .
