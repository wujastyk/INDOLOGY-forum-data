Rajaram's "horse seal"
The discussion of N.S. Rajaram's "horse seal" has continued over
the past week on a mini-List including Michael Witzel, Rajaram,
S. Talageri, V. Agarwal, K. Elst, and a number of others. Rajaram
finally revealed this morning (as I suggested on this List a
while back) that his "horse seal" was "computer enhanced."
The evidence (not mentioning the computer enhancement, but
otherwise complete) is newly summarized at:
