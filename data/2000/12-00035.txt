How can genetic evidence  say anything about an invasion? Also,since the  Vedic tradition was patrilineal any meaningful comparison with genetic data would be possible if the genetic markers used in the study are derived from the father side rather than the mother side.
Whosoever said ignorance is bliss surely had in mind the  genetic scientist's  highly desirable ignorance about ancient Indian history.
