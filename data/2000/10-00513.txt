Subject: Types of Indology

Indology pursued in the academe involves an
*historical* approach where the appropriate attention
is given to primary sources, archaeology, epigraphy, influences,
the linguistic dimension and so on. This can be and had been
done by Indians or foreign born.

"Religious/spiritual/divine-origin"/natinalist etc., approach
is often *ahistorical*. Taking vedas as apaurusheya, those
opinions have problems with known historical data.
For example, situating the Rigveda in 5000 or 4000 years
before Christ is not the mainstream of Indology.

Two types: historical and ahistorical.

V. Iyer
