Vedic Reciters/Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
I have been following this thread and Steve Farmer's interesting and
informative posts, and I have a question for Steve.
You quoted P. Olivelle in supporty of the possibility that:
"the citations of opposing views and texts
from different vedic schools indicate that the authors were working
from manuscripts rather than oral tradition..."
But your following description seems to confirm just the opposite: that
texts along with commentary can be memorized and discussed without a
written text.
I understand that the teacher had a written text, but the process you
describe seems to have worked mainly using memory.
On the other hand, mention of differing interpretations (by Vedic reciters)
may only have required the added work of learning the differing portions,
as the rest would be the same.  These could have been heard from a reciter
from another school.
I'm not trying to prove anything, but it seems that memorizing opposing
views doesn't necessarily imply that the presence of a written text is more
likely.

A single Aristotelian text would typically be
Very interesting idea.
It could also be the other way around: they spent so much time memorizing
texts because there was an "overreliance" on authority.  Serious dissent
was not tolerated for religious texts, and even for other literature, who
dared question Aristotle?
But more along your line of thought: maybe they spent so much time
memorizing texts because written texts, although they did exist, were nor
so widely available, or/and because if they wanted to find a particular
quote it was easier to go over the text/chaper in their heads.  Things are
different when you have concordances and indexes at the back of books (or
when you can do a word search in a word processor).
