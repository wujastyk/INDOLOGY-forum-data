Genetics issues in ancient India

You see, that is part of the problem of talking across disciplines
with entirely different foci. Most physical scientists do not know
the nuances of the humanistic and social scientific problems, and
most social scientists do not know the subtleties behind scientific
conclusions. That is part of the reason I went into some detail on technical
issues in my previous post, although it seemed a little
off-topic for this list.
Given the great potential for misinterpretation and wilful political
misuse, I think the humanities and social science people should make
an effort to better inform themselves about the new results that are
pouring in from genetic researchers every day.
