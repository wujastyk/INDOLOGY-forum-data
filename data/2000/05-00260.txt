AW: Indra's Son
Haussig (G?tter und Mythen des indischen Subkontinents, Stuttgart:
Klett-Cotta 1984, p.114) gives under the entry indrANI: "wife of Indra, also
ZacI. *Mother of Rudra Jayanta*." Haussig then refers to MahAbhArata I 114
and BhAgavatapurANa VI 18.
The question, if the son of the wife is also her husbands son, is not
considered.
