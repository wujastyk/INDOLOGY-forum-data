Message-ID: <161227059576.23782.13839570741116388691.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In a couple of days the International Journal of Tantric Studies,
Special Issue, Vol. 4, including the paper by Dr. John Roberth Gardner
"Magically Storming the Gates of Buddhahood: Extensible Text Technology
(XML/XSLT) as a Simulacrum for Research", will no longer be freely
accessible.

Please check out http://www.asiatica.org/publications/ijts/default.asp

The paper is on the unique new research possibilities provided to
scholars by XML (Extensible Markup Language). The paper introduces the
reader to XML - which is very much like HTML - and then demonstrates the
theory and application of ideas like viharaNam and vidhAna within
electronic texts.
