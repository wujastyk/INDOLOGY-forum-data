Regarding the Upanishads.

Spiritual experience is not like learning boxing. It is beyond any language.
I think this discussion is between persons who do not really know the nature
of contents of religious texts. "Yato vacho nirvatante  aprapya manasaa saha
....".  Here is another quote :
" risheh drishtarthasya pritirbhavati aakhyanasamyuktaa" (Yaskacharya in
Nirukta).
There also confusion between religion and spirituality (what should be real
content of a relion). A real religion is not a movement or organization. It is
a personal thing.
