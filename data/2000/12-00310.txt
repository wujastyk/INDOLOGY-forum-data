Re. Devaraja
Thanking R. Srinivasan who, as part of a much longer
posting, wrote: <<Khmer tradition is an extension of

Among the Khmer, the cult of the Devaraja emerged
during the ninth-century reign of Jayavarman II. At
this time, the previously dominant Zakti religion ?
based mainly on fecundity and the life-giving energy
of nature ? was modified anew or replaced by a
politicized form of Zaivism founded on rites of the
Devaraja. This would seem to imply nothing less than a
king's personal deification by merging his soul with
the essence of Ziva's subtle being. Here,
interestingly, R. Srinivasan suggests something
different. This invites some amplification and
clarification.
