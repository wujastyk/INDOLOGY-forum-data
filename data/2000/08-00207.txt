It had to do with Bharat Gupt's original statement that one
cannot always distinguish between Hindu and non-Hindu on the
basis of acceptance or rejection of varNAzrama. This is often
seen as a solely Hindutva construction, but the reality is
otherwise.

As for democracy or socialism being of Western origin, aren't
they? I don't claim that the Western origin is something negative.
Just that these concepts would not be applicable to pre-19th c.
India.
