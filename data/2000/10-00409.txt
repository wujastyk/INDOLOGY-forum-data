Deutsche Welle Sanskrit programmes on the net.
I have just been sent this URL for listening to Deutsche Welle (radio?)
programmes in Sanskrit. To hear it you need to have RealPlayer 8 installed
(there is a link from the URL below).
I have not tried it myself (I use Mac OS 8.0) and RealPlayer is not
available (no longer available?) for that platform.
