This can only have been Walter Wuest, an Indological scholar with a SS
connection. He was a compentent scholar (which means that you may have to
read his work on some subjects), but with a bad reputation for his
politics. I believe Sheldon Pollock has written about Wuest in a paper
called "Deep orientalism..." (I am afraid I don't have the whole title
available, and being far away from my library, I can only hope others will
fill in the missing data.)
I don't recall Wuest lecturing for Hitler, but he apparently lectured for
the SS on the Buddha if I remember Pollock correctly.
