Could any list members offer clues of direct reference
to yoga in early Thailand/Siam? I have only "heard"
that there were relations between yogis/rishis and the
early Thai/Siamese courts.

So far, Kamaleswar Bhattacharya?s essay ?The Religions
of Ancient Cambodia? (1997) has proved invaluable in
establishing the existence of yoga in Cambodia in the
ancient period.

With gratitude.

Ven. Tantra
