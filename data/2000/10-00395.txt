Regarding indology
Very!
I sometimes wonder if calling the List "Sanskrit-L" might make its purpose
more clear. It does not only deal with Sanskrit Language and Literature of
course, but that would always, presumably, be the core to which other issues
would relate. It might discourage heated arguments about contemporary
politics. Not that politics is a bad thing - just inappropriate on this kind
of list.
