heliocentrism--predating Copernicus
Dear List,
this is kind of a rehash from a FEBRUARY posting:
Looking for a variety of responses within the corpus
of Indian kavya and sastraic literature which posit
that the sun is 'the center of the universe,' which
pre-dates Copernicus.
Is there such literature?
Thanks in advance.
