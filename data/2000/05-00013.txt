To this can also be added: Diigha-nikaaya I 52 where the view is
there attributed to Puura.na Kassapa that there is no paapa in
performing various kinds of wrong action:
"if one should come to the south bank of the Ganges, slaying etc."
Or, "if one should go to the north bank of the Ganges giving, causing
to give, sacrificing, causing to sacrifice etc."
The same passage recurs (not attributed to a named individual or
school) a number of times in the Majjhima-nikaaya and
Sa.myutta-nikaaya.
