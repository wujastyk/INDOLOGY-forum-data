Lars, things have in fact already improved

FYI, this childish whining about Brits is unknown
when Indians are among themselves.  We know that
a defeated country can expect the worst from its
invaders, so we are not surprised    :-)  :-)
Of course.
One never hears this kind of undignified, humiliating,
childish whining about Brits when Indians are among
themselves.   Sanctimonious comments from foreigners
seem to set it off.  Don't take it seriously.  BTW,
"naive" Indians are hard to find.
Democracy becomes even more essential in such
a case, since it gives even illiterate people
an equal say.  BTW, the literacy rate as of 2000
is believe to be about 63%, and is increasing by
1 to 1.5 percentage points per year.  It looks like
the literacy rate will be over 90% in 20 more years.
