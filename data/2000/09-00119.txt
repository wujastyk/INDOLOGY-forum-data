Sanskrit and PIE
What does the revision of the dates of the Hittites do to the history of
iron-working technology ?
E.g., quoting the Britannica ( apologies to all for doing this ) :
"Certainly by 1400 BC in Anatolia, iron was assuming considerable
importance, and by 1200-1000 BC it was being fashioned on quite a large
scale into weapons, initially dagger blades. For this reason, 1200 BC has
been taken as the beginning of the Iron Age."
We find iron objects in China from around 700 BC, supposedly. If it was
theorized that the technology migrated from West to East, then you have cut
down the migration time from around 500 years to around 200 years, by
revising the Hittite time line.
That is, if the Anatolian dates are not established by independent physical
evidence and are established via the Egyptian and/or Assyrian chronologies.
