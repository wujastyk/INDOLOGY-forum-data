It would be immaterial if there has been independent existence
of "dravidian" literature or documents. But there has been no such
documents, not even one . When you say 'dravidian' in Vedic times, you are
only looking at Sanskrit and some aspects of it -like vocabulary or
grammatical structure or word endings- you want to call dravidian. Fine.
