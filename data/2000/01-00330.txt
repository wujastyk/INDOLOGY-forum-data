Subject: Skt vocabulary for: Hail
Message-ID: <161227055427.23782.5779184659966661715.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Sangam texts mention hail-storm, Eg., pati.r.ruppattu 84:22-23:
"vi.n.tu mu_n_niya puyal ne.tuG kAlai
kal cErpu mA mazai". Hailstorms are "kalmazai"/"kalmAri", both mean
'stone-rain' and are usually accompanied by lightning, etc.,
"kA.r.rum, veGka_nalum, kArum, iTiyum, kal mazaiyum eGkum" -villipAratam
(="Heavy winds, powerful lightnings, dark clouds, thunder and
hail-rain everywhere"). Kambaramayanam calls arrows released from a bow
as "azani-rain" (cilai vazaGku aca_ni mAri).

The 8th century Jaina epic, cIvakacintAmaNi compares the
Benares king to Krishna lifting govardhanagiri to save people:
"kal mazaip po_n ku_n.ru Entik kaNa nirai a_n.ru kAttu
ma_n uyir i_n.ru kAkkum vAra.navAci ma_n_na_n-"
Later examples are many: "ko.n.tal kalmAriyai, mu_n_nam,
kOvartta_namE ku.taiyAka" - villipAratam.
Indra hurting cattle, yadhavs with hailstorms is common
in tamil. Does the motif of "VajrapA.ni creating hailstoms"
in the Krishna legend have anything to do with hail being called ashani?
