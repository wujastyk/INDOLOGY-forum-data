Looking for info on Grantha script
The text of K. Venugopalan's _A Primer in Grantha Characters_ is available
at <http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/southasia/grantha.html>.  The page
images are sized for printing and not for display, so the individual GIF
files are too large to consult easily on most viewers.  This should improve
as I have time to work on the files over the next month or so.
