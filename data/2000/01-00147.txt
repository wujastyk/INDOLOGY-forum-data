Subject: Looking for info on Grantha script
Message-ID: <161227055087.23782.4055438822566496349.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The text of K. Venugopalan's _A Primer in Grantha Characters_ is available
at <http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/southasia/grantha.html>.  The page
images are sized for printing and not for display, so the individual GIF
files are too large to consult easily on most viewers.  This should improve
as I have time to work on the files over the next month or so.

>Dear Indologists,

>I'm looking for information on the Grantha script, but it is hard to come
>by where I am, so I would be very grateful for any help you can offer.  All
>I got so far--shame to say--is a photocopy of a rather poorly printed chart
>showing the basic ak.saras.  Thus any reference to sources that would be
>generally available by interlibrary loan at western libraries would be of
>interst, but especially so information on how conjunct characters are
>formed.  I would be equally grateful if somebody could provide me with
>scanned images; in that case please contact me by private email at
><bpj at netg.se>.  Please note that I subscribe to Indology in subject-index
>form only, so I would appreciate if on-list responses are cc-ed to the same
>address!
