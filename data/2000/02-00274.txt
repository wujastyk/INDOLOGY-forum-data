Retroflex and Boghazkoy.
Hello list members,
I have recently heard of the discovery of Sanskrit words in the remains of
the Hittite capital of Boghazkoy. Being interested in what the words were
and their characters, where might I find reports on the findings? Could it
be that some of the words contain characters that are later associated with
retroflex sounds? Wouldn't that be something?
