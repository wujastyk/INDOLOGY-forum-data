Rashad, protector of Lakshmi?
J. Kingston Cowart writes:
This "protector" is perhaps an attendant deity rather than a consort.  The
second element in the name will presumably be "dev" (deva).  Most likely
sources for the first element would seem to be r.s.i (sage) or some
derivative of hr.s. (to horripilate, be excited, be joyful etc) such as
hars.a (joy).  Cp. Hr.s.iikes'a, a name for Vis.n.u and Kr.s.n.a.  A
Vais.n.ava attendant figure would probably have Vis.n.u-related attributes
(conch, cakra, mace?) and name.  But this could be a very local deity,
adopted into the worship of Laks.mii.
