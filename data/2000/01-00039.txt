CARB fonts: proposed character set
A few weeks ago I announced a plan to launch a set of fonts to supplement
the Times Norman and CSX+ fonts. These were to be called CARB, standing
for "Character/Accent RagBag", and were to contain whatever weird and
wonderful accented characters Indologists require that are not already
found in the standard fonts.
I have received numerous suggestions, and I attach to this message a
definition file listing (and assigning encoding slots to) the characters
which I propose to include in CARB. Final suggestions are welcome; there
are still 24 vacant slots, so if you have a burning need for
n-underring-macron-acute, now is your chance!
After a few days to allow people to comment I shall build and release the
fonts.
