Or, maybe more to the point, all the Arabic words in Spanish.  Many Spanish
words that begin with "al" are Arabic imports that preserved the
Arabic article:
alfiler
alfombra
almacen
alcazar
almohada
albondiga
alberca
...etc.
Plus other common words such as "ojala, ("hopefully," "I hope so") which
originally means "Allah willing."

Mozarabic, the archaic Spanish spoken for centuries in the areas under
Muslim domination, had many Arabic words but preserved its Romance (Vulgar
Latin) grammar and sound system, just like Urdu preserved its Indo-Aryan
ones.  After the expulsion of the Moors from Spain in the 15th c. Spanish
became increasingly latinized, just as after partition Hindi became more
sanskritized and Urdu more arabicized and persianized.
