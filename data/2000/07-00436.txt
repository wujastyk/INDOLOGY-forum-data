The evidence from the "mound culture" along the Mississipi River would
seen to indicate otherwise.  The main settlement of Cahokia is
estimated to have had a population of 20,000 + inhabitants with
evidence of vast trading networks.  I  cannot imagine a city of 20,000
that survived for several hundred years having been supported by
merely "dabbling in agriculture".  The city is thought to have been
abandoned around the C13th CE due to climatic change and agricultural
over-exploitation and the inhabitants then reverted to simpler
pastoral and nomadic lifestyle.
