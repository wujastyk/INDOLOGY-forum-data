Subject: XI WSC -- set to go, I presume
Message-ID: <161227056144.23782.15455406995523983367.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

With regard to the XI World Sanskrit Conference, as far as I know it
is certainly happening -- anyway I am supposed to present a paper
there (on text-historical issues in editing the Atharva"siras
Upani.sad), and I have a room through the conference housing.  They
have replied to all my postal and electronic correspondance, and
although they were a bit slow to get underway, I have no reason to
suppose it will not happen.

But I hope I am not going to be the only person to show up!?

The address   cesme at tin.it   has worked fine for me.
Housing is being arranged through:
Hotel Reservation Convention Bureau Torino:  hotelres at hotelres.it

 They did say (on
Jan. 31) that the schedule of papers was not yet complete (and they
announced that it would be distributed only at the start of the
conference.

I hope to see others there!

Tim
