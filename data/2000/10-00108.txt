Thanks, Chandra for your detailed explanation.
kuRuntokai is supposed to have had an old commentary
(now lost) by pErAciriyar. Would it have had this
interesting explanation .. whereby the poem is
considered to have (not a mantra like but) an
effect (nevertheless) on the situation it's
describing?
I think not but I'd be interested to know if there are
other opinions.
Thanks in advance,
LS
