Re. Valerie,

Thank you love. I appreciate that and I know exactly
what you mean. But I specifically avoided using the
term "race." Race itself is a totally fallacious
theory with absolutely no scientific basis. However,
color of skin combined with a preponderant set of
regional cultural-conditioning factors is very
tangible and quantifiable even within this list. To
repeat the theme in common parlance: It is almost
exclusively from the ethnic-Whites we hear all the
bitching and advocacy of a purified apartheid
Indologist list. Yet, it has to be said that
intelligent Whites that recognize this (and they are
many) do not feel threatened. As for the blacks, if
they are not Uncle-Toms, they just get on with it.

For the stressed-out old-school types, it is worth
repeating what Swaminathan Madhuresan pointed out
recently.

Our list has a very nice built-in system whereby one
does not have to receive the entire daily load of
Indologist postings. This allows one to pick and
choose ? at a safe and hygienic distance ? from the
instantly updated archives. But one really needs to
pose a few rhetorical questions to the beleaguered
Western Scholar.

1. When you read their erudite Indology
print-journals, do you purge your office of all
non-Indological and/or profane material?
2. Do you read every advert and story in your
newspaper?
3. I mean, who on earth is forcing you to read every
posting?

The estimated "95% irrelevant postings" are no further
away or closer than any of the zillion extent
web-interfaces on the net. Please try to get this
though your heads: _Everything in cyberspace is only
just a click away_. If you can't wrap your mind around
the simplicity and directness of the Internet
revolution then the New Indology has probably passed
you by.
