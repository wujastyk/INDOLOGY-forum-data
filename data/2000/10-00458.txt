I may also add that in the Tamil popular conception throat viz 'nenju' also
occupies the place of justice, equity, fairness, etc.
There are common expressions like Nenjukku needhi i.e a cry for justice, or
'Nenju ketkavillai' which literally means Throat did not accept it which is
understood to be 'I felt something unfair and monstrous'
I wonder whether any Tamil scholars have something to add on this with
examples from literature
