You are quite right and all attempts to derive Skt "hRd-" from, say,
Dravidian, is nothing but romance !
"Modern" linguistics, just like modern music, art, etc. indulge in somewhat
provoking theories ! The "esprit critique" seems to have left our world...

Innovation is quite necessary but must be kept within "reasonable" limits. A
linguist is not a poet even if there is a pinch of poetry in a number of
etymological commentaries. For instance, Basque "BIHOTZ" (heart) = two
ticks, two sounds (BI + OTS) !

Etymology IMO has three functions :

1? A normal one. Such is the sequence hRd-, cor, etc...
2? A mnemotechnical one. i.e Engl. "jump" and Skt. "jhampaa-"
3? A letter-game as interesting as Scrabble or others.
