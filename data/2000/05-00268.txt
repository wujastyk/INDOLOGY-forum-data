Asram Vidya publications - evaluation
Would anyone care to comment on the scholarly value of the Italian
translations of Indian classics, mostly Advaita Vedanta, published by
Edizioni Asram Vidya.  I saw a very small number in Torino at the book
displays but the web page lists are large number.  Do they have
scholarly apparatus?  Is there reason to believe they are not direct
from the Sanskrit but from English?
Thanks,
Allen
