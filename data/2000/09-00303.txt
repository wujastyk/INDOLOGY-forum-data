Quest for Material Culture of the Grammatical Texts
Respected Scholars of the "Indology" Group,
I am working for my doctoral research on the above mentioned topic. I have
browsed the important and original books and articles on the subject. Can
anyone furnish any other bibliographic references to the topic ?
Requesting you for such references,
Thanking you,
- Shreenand L. Bapat.
