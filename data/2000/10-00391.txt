I am glad that the double standards of 'The Hindu' group has been aired for
the benefit of Indologists. The Hindu group was partially responsible for
the Rajaram phenomenon to begin with by publishing his 'pet theories' and
giving it, its stamp of approval. Now a sister publication, the Frontline
which is nothing but a personal fiefdom of its communist (yes he is a card
carrying member of an Indian Communist party) editor Mr. N. Ram (and a
member of a VERY wealthy Madrasi family which owns The Hindu group of
publications) has published a scathing attack on Rajaram thanks to Dr.
Witzell and Dr. Steve Farmer. Unfortunately the fact that the article was
published in the Frontline magazine makes the whole episode suspect to the
English media reading middle class Indian public. It is because of
Frontline's very partisan attitude towards the Tibetan freedom struggle,
national question in Sri Lanka and the ruling BJP party.  It is similar to
cynicism an average American might feel for the New York Times endorsement
Mrs. Hilary Clinton or anything 'New York' in general and New York Times
particularly. Sorry for the digression, I will keep to a barest minimum:-)
