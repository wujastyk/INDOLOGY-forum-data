Subject: question of roots
Message-ID: <161227059832.23782.15622896709362835893.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

It has been said that the roots of the Ealy Harappan Phase go back to Mehrgarh,even though there a gap between the closure of the Baluchistan tradition and the beginning of the Harappan. If the Harappan script is  related to the Vedic tradition, how far back do its roots go?
