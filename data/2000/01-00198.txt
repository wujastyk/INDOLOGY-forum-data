here. From the Islamic perspective rather, he is certainly a Kafir.
SA:Secondly, this statement (that Asokan empire was larger than Aurangzeb's)
is wrong, but I shall not belabour the point.
Interested readers may consult the numerous court chronicles to read for
themselves how Aurangzeb conquered Assam, Tibet, Afghanistan and Tamil Nadu.
VA: You seem to have read chronicles which even Jadunath Sarkar and other
scholars on Alamgir Aurangaeb Padshah Ghazi (Ghazi = killer of Kafirs) have
missed. Please post some references for our benefit. As far as I know, only
the army of Muhammad bin Tughlaq invaded Tibet and it perished in the
Himalayas. Maybe Aurangzeb provided his army special 'Down Jackets' from the
Burlingtom coat factory in the USA. On Tamil Nadu, I request Dr. Ganesan and
Dr. Palaniappan to clarify to your satisfaction. On Assam, the Mughal army
never procededed beyond the lowest parts of Assam. Even to this day, there
is a memorial marking the site of the victory of the Assamese Army over
Aurangzeb's army. So which court chronicle are your referring? Similarly,
you are wrong on Afghanistan.
SA:Parts of Aurangzeb's empire were over-run with bandits, but these
were temporary phases.
VA: Who were these bandits? Chhatrapati Shivaji? Durgadas Rathore? Satnamis
of Mathura who revolted against the destruction of the Krishna-Janmabhoomi
temple? Guru Tegh Bahadur who laid down his life to fight persecution of
Kashmir Hindus by Aurangzeb? Guru Gobind Singhji who lost his sons in his
fight against Aurangzeb, and whose mother died of shock when the Sahabzadas
chose death to Islam? It is rather Aurangzeb who regarded himself as a
Hijazi and not an Indian because he considered India a Darul Harb (a country
of Kafirs at war with Islam) and was therefore a bandit.
