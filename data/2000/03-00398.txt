I wonder Chris where you live. The tensions you mention are increasingly
found outside the inner city as minorities continue to migrate to the
suburbs and even rural areas as they have over the past decade or so.

I have a friend from rural Minnesota who knew only a few Native Indian
people from a nearby Chippewa reservation as he was growing up.

Now, the convienence store down the road from his parent's house is
owned by Ethiopian immigrants, and all the gas stations in town by
Indians or 'Middle Easterners.'

He says that there is a fairly large African American student body at
his former high school now, while there was not one while he went there.

Sorry for straying off topic.
