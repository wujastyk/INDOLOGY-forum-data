UBS university
It would be quite wrong of me to abuse my position as founder of the
INDOLOGY list to mention a completely unrelated topic such as the inspired
website of the University of Bums on Seats
(http://www.cynicalbastards.com/ubs/), which exemplifies all that is so
very special in British higher education today.
However, perhaps there is a relevance after all, since members of INDOLOGY
may be interested in registering for a fasttrack E-Degree in Post-Rational
Discourse.  This would certainly have a dramatically exiguous impact on
the discussion of some topics in this forum.
