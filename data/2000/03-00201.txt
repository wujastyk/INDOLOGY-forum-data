Well, technically speaking, you are right, of course.  But it is hard to
imagine anyone understanding "RV" as a reference to RV  brAhmaNas or RV
AraNyakas or RV upaniSads.  No, RV is generally recognized to be a short-hand
but unambiguous reference to RV saMhitA.

Of course, I do not know if Dr. Farmer knows this.  There is no evidence to
suggest that he does. So it is probably better to be explicit about this.

Thanks for your correction.

Briefly, I think that the answer is yes.  There are many members of this list
who are much more familiar with contemporary Vedic schools, and their
traditions, than I am. Perhaps they can provide some details and insights. I
myself have never heard of Sakuntala Devi. Please tell me more about her

Best wishes,
