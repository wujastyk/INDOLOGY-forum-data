The copies of the photos of the Tiroler iceman tattoos that I have do not
show that they occupy the Chinese Jingluo (acupuncture) points. To the
contrary, these tattoos run horizontally like shaivite lines, across the
channels, not in the same direction. They could equally be some sort of
ritualistic tattooing.
Please find a body part which doesn't have acupoints! There are acupoints
(as there are marmas) all over the body,
that is true, but to claim that these tattoos represent acupoints is
difficult to prove.

medicine.  Both Oetzi's tribe and the
the Indian sphere of influence.  And >Indian medicine does have a tradition
(likely much older than its first appearance in writing) of acu-points...
This is a very interesting subject! Aryan and Dravidian sources explain
marma and marmam from texts attributed to Sushruta and Agustya, but how do
we place a date on the Dravidian marmam model. Can you please explain this?
Best regards,
Mark.
