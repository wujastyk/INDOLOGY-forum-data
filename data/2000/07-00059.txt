Subject: Seals in trade
Message-ID: <161227059574.23782.300768271251080591.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Excavations at Lothal have proved that IVC seals were employed
for trade purposes. Sangam poetry in Tamil mentions the use
of seals exactly in this manner. I am interested in knowing about
mention in ancient literature about seals used on the packages
shipped in and out of ports. Any references to seals in Sanskrit
used for trade? Thanks.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
