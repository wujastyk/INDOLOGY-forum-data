Seals in trade
Excavations at Lothal have proved that IVC seals were employed
for trade purposes. Sangam poetry in Tamil mentions the use
of seals exactly in this manner. I am interested in knowing about
mention in ancient literature about seals used on the packages
shipped in and out of ports. Any references to seals in Sanskrit
used for trade? Thanks.
