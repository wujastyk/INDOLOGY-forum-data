Which takes one to a fundamental methodological problem, does it not? Under
the general description of "Hindu" as an inhabitant of the land east of the
Indus (especially true for 500-300 BC), Jains and Buddhists would be "Hindu"
in origin. That apart, does anyone have a consistent and comprehensive
statement of Hindu-ism as defining *a* religious community? If so, I would
very much like to know what it is.

Re: contemporary Jains associated with BJP, perhaps it would interest people
to know that many Swetambar Jain Acharyas are nowadays closely associated
with VHP. It might be a more north Indian phenomenon than south Indian, but
power equations in India are still largely decided by what happens in the
north.
