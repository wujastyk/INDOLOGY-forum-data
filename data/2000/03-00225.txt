The term utkutuka (or derivations, like utkutika) occurs also in
Buddhist Vinaya texts, see e.g. Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit
Dictionary, s.v. utkutuka. A note on utkutukasana (u.tku.tukAsana) and
garudasana (garu.dAsana) in Buddhist Tantric literature and iconography
can be found in R. O. Meisezahl: Geist und Ikonographie des
Vajrayana-Buddhismus. Hommage ? Marie-Th?r?se de Mallmann. Sankt Augustin
1980, pp. 241-243 (die Hocksitze utkutukasana und garudasana).
