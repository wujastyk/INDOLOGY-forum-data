There is a fairly high presence of -- in Punjabis.

Yes, just from the maternal side.

Haplotype M must have crossed over into Yemem because there aren't many
traces of it in the Levant.

Well, that's one of the points of my website at:

For the later haplotypes the probability would be very small indeed
because at the least you would have to multiply the probabilities of all
the ancestral haplotypes together.

Of course, in reality there is a somewhat Africoid substratum
