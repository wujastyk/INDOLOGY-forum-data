abhayada

I am studying a 9th century inscription which contains a cosmologically-
based list of incarnations terminating with 'a reflection of abhayada'. The
reference refers, in one sense, to a transcendent tathagata Buddha figure
of Amitabha. However, is the same epithet 'abhayada' also used in a Sivaite
context?
If so, then where might I find a textual reference to its usage?
Pehaps, Puranic texts?
Otherwise,
Ram. has abhayada two times: 4022010, 7006016;
Mbh. three times: 02022056, 02030012, 12237014
I have looked through ZivasahasranAmastotra, and it seems
the text doesn't contain the epithet.
(But check it once more, just to be on the safe side).
