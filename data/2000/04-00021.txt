I am trying to determine whether the constellation Ursa Major has any
connection with the figure of a bear in Indian astrology/ astronomy. The
only references I can find re to the constellation as the Seven Rsis or
Saptashayah. However as Ursa Minor is Largha Balu and therefore clearly has
a bear association I was wondering of the same held true for the Great
Bear. The bear is represnted figuratively in a Buddhist temple in Vietnam
dating from the 10th century and an association with the constellation of
the Great Bear would tie up a few loose ends regrading the inscriptions
associated with the site.
