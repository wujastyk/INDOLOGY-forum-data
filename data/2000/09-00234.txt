Subject: SV: "Buddha" before the Pali Canon?
Message-ID: <161227061749.23782.528415723801238318.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks for the new posts and bibliography from Lance Cousins, Jan
E.M. Houben, Georg von Simson, and Lars Martin Fosse. All are
greatly appreciated. The bibliography of concordant voices is
especially appreciated: it is reassuring to know that I'm not a
chorus of one. M. Witzel has pointed out some striking
etymological evidence about various names associated with the
supposedly "historical" Buddha and family members that I'd like
to discuss sometime, but I'm blowing a deadline and can't.

Further discussion is not needed, in any case, since Lars has
already raised the clincher argument by bringing Wild Bill
Hickock and Calamity Jane into the picture. QED!  :^)
