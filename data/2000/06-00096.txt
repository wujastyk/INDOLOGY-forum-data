Who exactly?
Very shabby reasoning.  The time if his birth is also fixed as 1238, and
tradition is still for 79 years; hence only do we have the latter date
established as 1317.  The period of 43 centuries is only approximate (note
that Madhva says only that he was born after the passage of 4300 years,
not that he was born in a specific year designated 4300:  chatuHsahasre

does not alter the date of the document to 1300 CE, although the statement
is broadly accurate.
Anyway, this matter has been discussed in detail in the HDSV and materials
referred to therein; you could do better referring to them instead of
coming to arbitrary and uninformed conclusions.
