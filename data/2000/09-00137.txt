Dharmadhara
Dear list members,
In the 13th century the Kashmiri pundit Dharmadhara and the lo tsa ba Grags
pa rgyal mtshan translated several works: the ParamArthasa.mgraha, the
JambhalAstotra, the SAmudrikanAmatanUlak.sa.naparIk.sA etc. I would
appreciate any references to works which deal, even if briefly, with the
figure of Dharmadhara.
Thanks,
