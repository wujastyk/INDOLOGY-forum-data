new Indology list
Am 23 Oct schrieb Namrata Bose:
For the amusement of our readers: our vociferous Ms Namrata has yelled
at me in a similar vein before (I believe it was on RISA-L), and when I
asked her to produce proof that I have ever been a Christian (let alone
a fanatic), she was not forthcoming.
Further comment seems unnecessary.
