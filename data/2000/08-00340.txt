No doubt others with more time and more books to hand than I can provide

Subhaa.sitaratnako.sa, Vidyaakara's early anthology, recently.
Subhaa.sitaratnako.sa (ed. Kosambi and Gokhale) 1241 (verse 29 of the
sadvrajyaa, and indeed as you will see their is no question of meanness
or deceit here):
aya.m nija.h paro veti ga.nanaa laghucetasaam
udaaracaritaanaa.m tu vasudhaiva ku.tumbakam
This verse is quoted in several Ala.mkaara"saastra works too.  The only
precise reference I have at hand as I write is Bhoja's
"S.r"ngaaraprakaa"sa (new ed. by V. Raghavan, part 1. [can Michael Witzel
or anyone tell us when we can expect the rest? I for one am very eagerly
looking forward to it] Harvard 1998, Harvard Oriental Series 53)) where
you will find the verse quoted on p. 405. It is apparently sometimes
attributed to Udbha.ta, sometimes to Ke"sa.ta.
The expression indeed does not occur in the Manusm.rti (An electronic text
of Manu input and proofread by M. Yano and Y. Ikari is publicly available,
and you can find it e.g. through following the link for Virtual Archive of
Indic e-texts on the INDOLOGY home-page).
