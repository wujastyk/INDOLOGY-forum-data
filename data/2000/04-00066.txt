tsampa = sattu?
  'Tsampa,' in Tibet, is said to be the flour made from roasted barley.
  In Nepal, supposedly, both 'tsampa' and 'sattu' are used to denote flour
made from roasted grains.
  In Bihar, 'sattu' is used for flour made from gram (chick-pea) and also
barley. (apparently 'sattu' is a Pali word)
What, if any, is the nature of the etymological connection between the two
words?
