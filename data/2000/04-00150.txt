snake & mongoose in ancient India
More "logic" without enough biological or linguistic background:

Rajarshi Banerjee:
The stress, again, should be on "could". Unfortunately, the otter is *not*
= Skt. babhru/Avest.
bawri,
but  otter =  Skt. udra, and one of the best attested Indo-European animals.
Regularly derived from the very *archaic* IE word for water, (i.e. 'water
animal'): IE *wod-R ,   gen. **ud-n-s  'water' (archaic  r/n heterocliticon
as in Skt. ahar, Gen. ahnas): Engl. water, Hittite uidaar, Gen. wedenas,
Skt. udan (Loc.), udnas (Gen.) etc.
otter:  IE *udro,  Skt. udra, Avestan udra, Greek hudros (and hudra!),
Lith. Udras, Udra;
O.H. German ottar, O.Church Slav. vydra; Serbo-Croatian vidra, etc.
see Pokorny, IE Dict. (Indogerm. Woerterbuch) 1959 :  79
A clear, OLD derivation. Skt. udra' otter' is an old IE word.
They were,  when they *wanted* to describe. But the Rgveda and Avesta are
texts of ritual poetry , not biology handbooks. We have to take what they
tell us and see how far we get with this information. And this is enough in
the  case of the beaver (see below).
Certainly and well known (also on this list, some years ago I think)
Only, Herodotos never went to Afghanistan/Kohistan and got his news, not
unlike some anthropologists,  through a chain of translators and
travellers: unreliable. Sometoime she believes them, sometimes not.,.
No dams, or flat tails in the Avesta, but a  Goddess' dress made of 30
beaver skins. Specifically of a fem. beaver with 4 cubs (within the range
of a beaver).
Does one make dresses of water rats, etc?? Or mongoose??
Since IE *bhebhru 'beaver' (see earlier message) is attested in a large
number of  IE  languages, is found in Central Asia even today, and  since
Avestan bawri- is derived from the IE word, why to substitute  it by an
unknown species (any water animal or the otter) for the well known and
linguistically and textually well attested Avestan /IE one?
Just to please speakers of Sanskrit who have substituted babhru 'brown,
beaver' by 'brown, mongoose, mungo'??
Occam's razor applies:
IE *bhebhru 'beaver' and *udro  'otter'  have come down to Sanskrit
as babhru 'mongoose' and udra 'otter', as befits the Indian climate.
