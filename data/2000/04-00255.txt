[How] wonderful that </color>[he, the Bodhisattva Jiimuutavaahana] out 
of pity for the sake of another gives, as if it were straw, that 
very life,<color><param>0100,0100,0100</param>

<color><param>0100,0100,0100</param>once devoured the flesh of a dog,
        for which reason Gautama killed Naa.diija"ngha who had 
done him a favour,
        [and] for which purpose this son of Kaa"syapa, Taark.sya, daily slays snakes.
