Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
Many thanks, Bjarte, for drawing our attention to this.
Yes, (pre-)Old Indo-Aryan, not Indo-Iranian.
This is an old canard, perpetuated by SS Misra (Aryan Problem 1992) and
Norman (1995, Erdosy's Indo_Aryan vol.)
As has been known for long, satta in satta-vartana 'seven turns' has been
influenced by Hurrite  'seven' (J. Friedrich 1940) and is not a reflex of
the much later MIA satta 'seven'; in the same vein, the words starting with
b- such as bi- did not receive their b- from a MIA pronunciation of vi,  as
Misra maintains, but are due to the fact that Mitanni does not allow
initial v- (Diakonoff 1971: 30, 45). In sum, the Mitanni IA words are not
Prakritic but (pre-)Rgvedic.
As you say:
or see above.
Only in so far as the Kassites had contacts with (pre)OIA as some loan
words  indicate (gods, horse color)
Again, some CONTACT must have happened to account for the many male (!)
personal names, a few IA gods,  and many items relating to horses and horse
racing. Mayrhofer assumes contact a (few) hundred years  before c. 1380,
the date of the Mitanni-Hittite agreement
That is important information, and agrees with what Mayrhofer supposes.
However,
I find more difficult to swallow. Whether a real IA dynasty existed or not,
we do not take royal names from horse trainers (or, today, from
computer-wallas: Bill I, king of X-sthan?)
That, I find a moot question, still. ONE group of (pre-)OIA, probably on
the Eatern (Iranian) side of the Zagros range, had contact with the
Kassites and with the Mitannis before these moved into Mesopotamia.
For dating (esp. of the RV) it is important to note that some of the
Mitanni words have a pre-Rgvedic form, thus are pre-Old-Indo-Aryan.
