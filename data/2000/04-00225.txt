The trail of the Romani (Gypsy) can be established with considerable

of the population in that region.
The people mentioned by a Mount Ethos monk in 1100, may or may
not be Romani.
In Europe they have a clear identity. The ones in Turkey too are
also clearly of the same kind. However people who can be clearly
associated with European Gypsies in Iran are the ones that have
migrated back from Europe. The supposedly related tribes that are
thought to mark trail further back to India, appear to have
questionable relationship.
A possible guess is that in their current form, Gypsies have
emanated from region near the second Rome (Constantinople),
termed Romania. It is the second Rome that gave Jalauddin Rumi
his name.
It is not clear to me why derivation of the term Roma from
the Constantinople region is often ruled out. If the bulk
of the Gypsies are largely the descendants of the slaves taken
by Turks, the slaves must be largely descendants of the farmers,
a large  number of them being Jat in NW India, and not Dom.
