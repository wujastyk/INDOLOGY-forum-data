Turner [CDIAL-5904] includes "pencil" as one of the meanings of tUlA, tUlI.
The word in this sense occurs in DivYavadAna. He also mentions the possible
connection to Drav. turi [DED 2790].


<In what kind of mss. do you

I have this scribal end-verse in the mss. of BalarAmadAsa's GuptagItA bA
chatisAlekhana, a sixteenth century Oriya poem.

By the way, I prefer 'sthIradRSTiH', eyes intent and fixed on the palm leaf
and stylus.

Best.
