I feel that we need not invoke mantra etc here.
Simple human psyhcology is enough to explain the situation.
Even the whole episode is expressed as  a poem but we must separate
that from the utterances referred to inside the poem.
This poem belongs to the pAlai (desert) landscape/genre involving
the theme of separation, either of the hero from the heroine or of both
lovers from their parents by way of elopement.  When it is the former, it
is often not separation but impending separation. The hero has just
announced his intent to depart to a far-off land, which can be symbolically
reached only after crossing a desolate landscape, to seek wealth, fame or
battle victory. The heroine is unable to bear the news and needs
consolation, or the hero himself is torn between duty and family/romance.
Real separation of lovers occurs mainly in mullai landscape; in mullai
though impending arrival or reunion of lovers at the promied date is
portrayed.
This particular poem obviously refers to the impending separation of the
hero from his lover.
Viewed simply, as soon as the heorine hears the phrase
"who [,ever,] would want to part with you"  which gives hope that the hero
himself may not bear to leave her behind,
she feels uplifted and looks up...
Neither does rA.raghava iyengAr's.
To me it looks like an interesting but minor and harmless adornment by UVS.
