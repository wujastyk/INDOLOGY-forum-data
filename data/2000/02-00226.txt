CALL FOR PAPERS
Announcement: The Department of Philosophy at Miami University,

in the Twelfth International Congress of Vedanta. International
Congress of Vedanta, founded in 1986 at Miami University , Oxford,
Ohio, is the focal point for meeting of North American scholars
specializing in all aspects of Indian philosophy and religion. In the
past, the Congress has also celebrated the birth centennial of S.
Radhakrishnan 1988), the 1200th anniversary of Sri Sankaracharya
(1990), the centennial of Swami Vivekananda's sojourn to America and
his participation in the World Parliament of Religions (1992), birth
centennial of J.  Krishnamurti (1995), and the 700th anniversary of
sanjeewan samadhi of Sri Jnaneswara (1996). International Congress of
Vedanta also held its meetings in Madras, Rishikesh and Hyderabad,
India, and in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, in order to facilitate better
interaction between scholars in India and the West.
Location: The 12th Congress will be held in the Marcum Conference
Center of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, between September 13 and 17,
2000. Oxford, Ohio, is situated near Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, a
30-45 minute drive from each. The Cincinnati and Dayton airports are
an hour's drive from Oxford. The Marcum Conference Center offers
excellent modern conference facilities with conference, seminar,
