Walking Buddha
  True, gods are sculpted as sitting and standing or sleeping.
  The walking style is rare, I know only of walking buddha statues
  from Sukhotai period Thailand, if we don't take trivikrama avatara
  as walking which Alvars say as "naDantAn2".
 This seems to refer to a devotee. OTOH, the kuRaL clearly refers
 to the God's attribute as One who walked on the flower.
 Thanks and kind regards,
