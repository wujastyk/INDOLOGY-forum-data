A brief note in support of Jan Houben's proposal, before he departs to India.

While I have sympathy with those who want to continue an 'open' discussion
list, an unmoderated list simply does not meet the minimal standards of a
scholarly list.  That is obvious, and has been for a very long time.

For me, the lost opportunity of this list consists in the fact that there are
numerous very learned scholars who have either dropped out of the list or
have remained silent.  I am encouraged whenever one of them posts a message
to the list.

Wouldn't this be a better, wiser list, if the standard were such that we all
could have more opportunity to hear from them?

I myself am prepared to accept a voluntary maunavrata [think how difficult
THAT would be for a jalpaka like me!], if that would contribute to a list
where it is the ziSTas who speak, and the ziSyas who listen.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
