English translation of Siddhanta Kaumudi
Dear list members,
I am looking for an english translation of the Siddhanta Kaumudi and see the
following three listed in the Library of Congress catalogue.
1) The Siddhanta Kaumudi of Bhattoji Dikshita, Edited and translated into
English by S. C. Vasu and V. D. Vasu, Allahabad, The Panini office, 1907
(available in reprint).
2) Sri Bhattoji Diksita's Vaiyakarana Siddhanta Kaumudi, the standard
Sanskrit grammar: an analysis in English by P.V. Naganatha Sastry, Motilal
Banarsidass, 1974-1983.
3)Siddhanta-kaumudi, Karaka-prakarana of Bhattoji Diksita, editted with an
elaborate English exposition & critical annotations by Bishnupada
Bhattacharya, Calcutta:Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 1974.
Which one would you recommend as the best and most accurate translation.
Many thanks in advance,
