Guests (inquiry on behalf of a colleague not on the list)
Dear members of the net.
A colleague non involved in sanskrit studies has sent me the following
question:
"Hindus normally explain their hospitality as inspired by the following line
in Sanskrit: "Atithi devo bhava" (treat your guests like God).
Can anyone tell me what scriptures this line appears in?"
I assume that it should be "Atithir devo bhavatu" or something to that effect.
Please send your answers to Kathinka Froystad, Kathinka at prio.no.
