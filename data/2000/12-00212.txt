Disturbing Discussions
I am a little concerned about the recent line of discussions on Koh-I-Noor,
and mosques and temple destructions etc. The discussions are bordering on
blaming one another for what happened in the past and using historiography
to invent things that might or might not have happened. I would like to
appeal to the editors of the list to avoid such discussions to carry on
endlessly. Perhaps the points by respective individuals have been made and
can we have an end to this?
