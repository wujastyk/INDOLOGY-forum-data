Koh-I-Noor
Namaskar Vikrantji,
It is not that I have a ready solution but IMO
there are certain steps that must be followed.
1. Recognition of the fact Hindu temples were
destroyed, descrated and plundered on a very
systematic and large scale by invaders, mainly
muslims. Before we set out to recover what was
looted from us we must not have any doubt whether
looting and plundering itself was committed.
We still have Congress, communists and pseudo-
secularists denying this very fact.
2. We need to spread this fact among masses of
Bharat so that they know the fact and become
aware enough to demand justice, right and property.
Once the people rise up for truth, rest would
follow.
3. We should always watch out for those who's
agenda is to white wash history by concealing
and/or distorting the fact. We must expose such
people and their agenda.
Regards.
