origins of Pali
Witzel:
This is what is in debate. Even for the northwest there is a recently
discovered inscription in Braahmii with no north-western dialect
features.
The converse is the case. We should perhaps view the north-west as
the special case which has to be explained i.e. it is probably a
product of pre-existent administrative practice in this area, using
the Kharo.s.thii alphabet.
It is a little later that that, but there are also Pali materials
from Burma (Pyu), dating to the fifth or sixth century A.D..
This is well-known. However, it should not be exaggerated. The
discussions in the Pali commentaries do sometimes make it clear what
precise forms are at issue.
The form -sattva- is not found in any Pali text; you must be thinking
of BHS. Metrical studies may show that braahma.na- is sometimes or
always a later Sankritization and not an indigenous feature of Pali.
The point at issue is whether forms such as the nominative in -o are
geographically an exclusively western feature. And in fact they are
not. The inscription of Khaaravela does not have either the
nominative singular in -e nor the use of l for r. It is not alone in
this.
Subsequent inscriptions from Western India in the century after
A'soka do not closely resemble the language of Girnaar. Conversely
the inscriptions from Bhaarhut and Saa~ncii have elements in common
with Pali which are not found in the inscriptions of A'soka.
