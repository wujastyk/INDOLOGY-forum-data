I think that Ludo- if it is the same as the American game Pacheesi- is
modelled on the Indian game CaupaR, which was supposed to be especially
liked by Krishna.

I have no idea what the American game Pacheesi looks like, but the Indian
games Pacheesi and CaupaR are two different games. The Pacheesi [or Pachisi
from pachis < paJcaviMSa]has twenty five houses [or squares] on a borad [or
floor] drawn with five parallel lines across and five parallel lines
horizontal. It is played by four players with four pawns [or tamarind seeds,
date seeds or betel nuts]. These pawns are called goTi-s, possibly from
pebbles that were earlier used in such games. For example, in the game of
"bAgh-bakri". The player whose pawns reach the twenty fifth house first wins.
The CaupaR also is a board [or floor] game. The CaupaR can be played by as
many players as can be seated around the table or on the mat or durry. The
board [or floor] plan is like an oversized Plus [+] sign. The four hands [or
sides] have each sixteen [or more]houses or squares. The game is played with
dice [or cowrie shells].  
Hope this information helps.
Best wishes.
