It is precisely this (multinational question in a single country /existence
of many nationalities) which many hindutvadis are unable to comprehend. You
are absolutely right. India should be compared to Europe but with one
administrative federal unit. When India started in 1947, the founding
fathers were clear in calling it as  Indian Union. It was Indira Gandhi in
1969 who changed it as Republic of India. Confusion soon spread among the
elites.

There are many Hindutvadis who think that we are un-patriotic when we talk
about the multi-national question.

It is not surprising  that the present OIT theory and the Republic of India
concept go together.
