Musical trees and rivers?

No music related shastra, as far as I can remember, uses
' vanaspati' as a synonym for daaravii, the harp. Unless
we regard this (Christian's material) as the only instance.
For a fair guess to ammendations it is necessary that the whole passage
with its context is revealed with the identity of the text
and its likely date.
After all, there is a whole history of the change in meaning for the same
musical terms from the Natyasastra to Pt. Bhatkhande and the even later
interpreters like Acharya Brhaspati, a period of more than two thousand years.
Then, there is a history of musical terms used in yogic and philosphophic
context. Lexicons like Amar onwards are all a part of this development.
Lexicons take words from shastras not the other way round.
May be Christian does not want to share more at this moment. Bhavatu.
