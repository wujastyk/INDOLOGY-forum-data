Can you give the title of this volume?
The crucial question in this thread is the history of Sringeri maTha. Has any
new information come to light regarding this? Have you or other scholars
authenticated and analyzed the pre-Karnataka/Vijayanagara records mentioned
by Vidyasankar?   Whom do you agree with on the pre-Karnataka history of
Sringeri, Kulke or Vidyasankar?
the
Based on Kulke's work (p.129)  you seem to be reversing your views of 1985.
Can you briefly tell us the basis of your change of view? Does this mean that
Harihara I had two ministers named Madhava? or as some others have held
Madhavamantrin and Madhava-Vidyaranya were one and the same?
Then, are you in agreement with Kulke that the "kaDita" records held by
Sringeri maTha are not reliable?
Thanks in advance.
