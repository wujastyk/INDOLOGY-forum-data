On behalf of my son I am sending the following:

"I plan to make the electronic text of Perunkatai freely available to all on the web. The work is about one-quarter finished. I hope no one will go to the trouble of duplicating my efforts. The keying is done according to the UBC INDIC format. Prospective users should have no difficulty in converting it to whatever format they find convenient. They will be given the keyboard layout, should they need it."
