Vaitarini
Y.Vassilkov about:   The Vaitara.nii:
As so often, I find myself agreeing 100% with Y. Vassilkov, and would just
like to point to a similar case, published quite a while ago:
Salomon, Richard. The Three Cursed Rivers of the East, and their
Significance for the Historical Geography of Ancient India.  Adyar Library
Bulletin 42, 1978, 31-60
where  the Sadaaniiraa (in Satapatha Brahm. )  ~~ mod.Gandak(ii),
the later Karmanaazaa (s. of Ganges, W. border of  Magadha /S. Bihar
play similar roles as 'cultural boundaries'.
And, YV's  note on
is very well taken, too.
Note birds/ the peacock in such complexes of ideas, since early Vedic (KS!)
and since the burial urns in the early post-Indus "Cemetery H" graves, with
peacock & homunculus motives....
