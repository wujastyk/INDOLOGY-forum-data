Recordings of Ramayana on music CD
Namaskar!
There is an old Folkways recording of several selections of  the Valmiki
Ramayana
(Folkways 09920, 1951), as recorded by S.R. Ranganathan, T.M.P. Mahadevan,
and Swami Nikhilananda.  If I recall correctly, these passages formed one
side of an LP record containing Sanskrit material.
This recording (I think on cassette) can now be ordered from Smithsonian
