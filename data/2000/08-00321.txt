Equating sa.mghaata with the body + senses rather seems to be making the
parts more than the whole: 'A, B, C, D ..., and the
complex-of-body-and-senses (sa.mghaata) ... this, in brief, is the body
(k.setra).' I still find this meaning implausible. But perhaps we are
beginning to exhaust the subject. I am very grateful for your insights and
comments, and for those of Ferenc.

Thanks again,
Martin
