The reason that I didn't point them to this list was due to the
enormous amount of useless argumentation in the discussion. On
the Advaitin list my arguments are better structured, since
I wasn't distracted. The audience was more mature and atleast
willing to hear me out before attempting to shoot my theories
down. (And when searching the archives on the Advaitin list
search for "MAdhyamaka" and not "Understanding MAdhyamaka", as
the first article in the series doesn't show up with the latter,
as its subject line is different).

Does netiquette bother Vidhyaji only when he is affected? And I've
hardly seen anything to equal the above - slander on the members of
one list on another list.

In the month long discussion on the Advaita list, apart from one or
two posts, the rest is for most part grounded in ignorance. About
the list members knowledge of Buddhism, the less said the better.
Mere quantity doesn't ensure quality. That you don't think so,
doesn't surprise me anymore.

Yes, go ahead and look at the list. As I said before, the evidence
is there for all to see.

>And

Yes, so well informed that they quote from both Hinayaana and
Mahaayaana in the same breath, without even realizing the difference!
