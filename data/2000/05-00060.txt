a question for the traditionalists among us

There is a lot that can be said on this topic.  Here are just a couple
verses I'm aware of:
The following is one verse from Padma Purana:
sat-karma-nipuno vipro, mantra-tantra visaradah,
avaisnava guru na syad, vaisnavah sva paco guruh
A brahmana (priest or intellectual) with all brahminical qualities and
abilities is not qualified to be a guru unless he is a devotee of Lord
Vishnu (the Supreme Lord).  While a devotee of Lord Vishnu, even if born in
the lowest class, is qualified to act as guru.
And one from Bhagavad-gita 4.34
tad viddhi pratipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from
him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can
impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.
I hope this is helpful.
Best wishes,
