Subject: towards a list for professional sanskritists and              archeologists & anthropologists of south asia
Message-ID: <161227064409.23782.6994568617810323936.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Prof. Aklujkar expressed views that also need to be considered:
http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE?A2=ind9711&L=indology&P=R10601

The tone and accuracy should be monitored, no doubt. My experience is
people with PhD in Indology or in some other academic field write with
high signal-to-noise ratios. Recent postings may have more to do with
people with undergraduate degrees, and no publication record, not just
in Indology but  elsewhere in the academc arena also.

One easy option is to "set indology nomail", and read the
posts of choice (subject, author, etc.,) from the Indology website.

Regards,
SM
