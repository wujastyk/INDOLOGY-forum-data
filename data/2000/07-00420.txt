Medical texts
Dear Members,
I am familiar with references to the therapetic uses of meat especially beef and buffalo meat in Caraka, Susruta and Vagbhata. I wish to know whether this tradition continued in later Indian medical texts/commentaries (E.G. Arunadatta, Dalhana, Cakrapanidatta). 
With regards,
D.N.Jha
