Etymology of the words 'vedi' in ritual context

You  have said "I am still contemplating". Granting me a little bit of
study
and familiarity with RigVeda, please think *why* would I have suggested
to refer
to those two mantras? What do those mantras really say? Do they say
something about
the nature of what is called vedi? What is the meaning of the word
p.rthivii  [RV I-164-35]?
and parame vyoman  [RV I-164-39]?
I am ready to accept etymology of vedi based on veda (grass) provided
Linguists
agree  with me that  grass {veda, barhi} means neurons of the human
brain, i.e. the brain
belonging to yajamaana. But will they? Trouble with RigVeda is that one
can not apply only
linguistic rules for deriving etymologies.
