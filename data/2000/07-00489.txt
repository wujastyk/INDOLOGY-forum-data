An annual buffalo-sacrifice takes place in Chitra-month in Cenci, Tamilnadu.
It's during the annual festival for the three main goddesses of the place
(Mariyamman, Kaliyamman and Kamalakkaniyamman, a local goddess) - and it is
a combination of religious sacrifice and royal ceremony...



I witnessed the festival a few years ago and collected video- and
photo-documents of it which I am willing to share, if requested.



Kind regards,

Ulrike

Dear List Members,

I am trying to find out the temples in India where baffalo is sacrificed or
was sacrificed till recent times. Could any one be so kind to provide
relevant information/references?

Sincerely,

D.N.Jha
