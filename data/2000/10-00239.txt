Correct.

I have just noticed that in 1844 Sir Thomas Metcalfe presented his daughters
with a compilation entitled 'Reminiscences of Imperial Dehlie' [imperial here =
Mughul].   Near the beginning is an account of the Delhi Jantar-Mantar, which
begins:

The Observatory at Dehly denominated the "Juntur-Muntur", literally Witchcraft,
was constructed by the Maha Raja Jey Singh of Jeypoor ... . [ref 1]

Hindi 'jantar-mantar' can mean "jugglery, conjuring, witchcraft, an
observatory", while 'yantramantra' is "sorcery, magic". [ref 2].

Hence one may speculate that 'Jantar-Mantar' is something of a popular name
arising from the mystery of astronomical/astrological work as a whole, and not
from any particular instrument.

I have not been able to ascertain whether the observatories at Ujjain and
Varanasi bear the same designation.
