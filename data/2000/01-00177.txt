What do we know about KauTalya? Does his name come from
"kUTal", the ancient name for Madurai? KauTalya talks of
Madurai in his book and also the different pearls harvested
at the Cape Comorin and the place where tAmraparNI (taNporunai -
its old name). What are Hemacandra's words along with damila
for KauTalya?

Is there any book/paper where K.'s discussion of things South
Indian and his name, etc., are analyzed?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
