SV: ICHR controversey
Rajarshi,
   I belong to this listserve because I am very much interested in and
profoundly impressed by the wisdom that has come out of India over the
centuries. But of course I also have other interests. Your recent posting
touched on one of them.
Perhaps you explain to me why or in what sense the Israelis are "paranoid."
Without doubt, many people see the Zionists as the aggressors in the
Arab-Israeli conflict (even if many of such people remain well-disposed
toward Israel). So if this is the way you see it, I am hardly shocked by
this. But the point is, I am very interested in exactly how such people
actually do see the Arab-Israeli conflict, since I believe that strong cases
can be made against the typical charges leveled against Israel and the
Zionist movement.
If you prefer, you may respond directly to me at
