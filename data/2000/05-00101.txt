sculptural terminology: tribanga, trivanka
In reference to Indian sculptural terminology, let?s
say we come to the Indonesian Standing Buddha. The
posture of the Buddha is gracefully sensuous. The
weight of the body favors his right foot thus making
the lateral line of the hips slightly angled. My notes
refer to this pose as tribanga or trivanka, that is,
?broken? in three or ?bent? in three. Could any list
members clarify and amplify the meaning of these two
terms? Are they both Sanskrit? Or Sankrit and Pali
equivalents? I am also not sure of any diacritical
marks.
Best regards,
Ven. Tantra
