And not too soon, in my opinion.  I had begun to wonder if you had be
away on holiday and were unaware of the barrage of vituperative msgs.
I subscribe to a number of Buddhist acdemic lists but have not
encountered anything like the recent spate of unpleasantness on  the
Indology list.  I would have unsubscribed but for the members who
provide information and discussion that is useful and presented in a
friendly and courteous manner.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
