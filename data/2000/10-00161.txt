It makes little difference. 'Jaati' means little more than 'a group
of people' / 'community' distinguished by whatever characteristics.
If their neighbours refer to them as a 'jaati' (which is commonly
translated in English as 'caste', following the Portuguese 'casta'), they
learn to identify themselves in those surroundings as a 'jaati' / 'caste'
and will say so. But as the illustrations in my previous message show, this
identification as a 'jaati' / 'caste' as hardly a basis for determining
whether a person belongs to a religious or social community termed 'Hindu' (or
even 'Indian'). It is a label in very flexible use in South Asian society, and
its use in itself does not necessarily indicate inclusion of the other
person / group of persons in the group of the speaker in any sense.
