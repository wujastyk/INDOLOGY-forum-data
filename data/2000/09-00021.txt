Hands Of Goddess Durga ?
My understanding is that the images are created
on interpretations of depictions in Devi Mahatmaya.
It's a function of saktis accumulated in the devi
to remove "evils".  Hands are needed to hold
the ayudha that sakti needs.
The ayudhas are ghanta, shULa, haLa, sankha, musaLa,
chakra, dhanu, sAyaka.  (from devi mahatmya, uttamacharita).
