Tuan/Se?or Manansala is wrong, comme l'habitude:

rather, a philologist -- (I am not a linguist by profession, incidentally,
though I have a
lot of training in that area) --  will soon find out that this is a saying.

Derived, no doubt, like all Anguli-sthaana speech and folklore, from the
real horse's mouth, given by the ancient Rishi Dadhyanc Atharvana, to the
Ashvins.

These, incidentally, are the ancestors of the English subgroup of the Druhyu
that emigrated from India. Too bad that  Talageri etc. did not notice it: the
first Englishmen are  Hengist ('stud', German: Hengst) and Horsa...

All Hail to these Thanes!
