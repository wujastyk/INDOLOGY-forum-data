Earplugs and ear elongation
I have been comparing the use of earplugs and the associated practice of
ear elongation in India.
Such earplugs appear in Harappa and particularly large numbers were
recovered from Lothal. Statues of the Buddha often show the practice of
ear elongation minus the ornament. Also, in South India, statues, such
as those of the Tamil saints, suggest that ear elongation was still
prevalent at latter periods.
My question is when did ear elongation fade out in different parts of
India. Are there any old texts that go into detail concerning this
practice?
