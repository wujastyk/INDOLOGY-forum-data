Logic and fudge

It would seem that the semantic range of the word as used in the US is
different to UK English.  The relevent parts of the Oxford English
Reference Dic define it thus:
n.:  1.  nonsense; 2. a piece of dishonesty or faking
v.tr:  1.  to put together in a makeshift or dishonest way; fake
v.tr:  2.  to deal with incompetently
v.int:  to practise such methods
I wonder if the good Konrad Elst speaks British English or its
American version ?   As Oscar Wilde is supposed to have said of the
Americans, "Nothing divides us but a common language".
