Material for correct time of observance of Hindu holidays              inEnglish
You may enjoy a very simple popular description of Indian festivals and
holidays.  There is a chapter on the Indian calendar system:
Rituals and Festivals of India, by Tara Bapat, published by Popular Prakashan,
Bombay, 1991.
Sincerely,
Peter Freund
