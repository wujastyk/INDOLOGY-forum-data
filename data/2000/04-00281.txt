RA + RI = ?

I have read (but am presently unable to cite the source) that the same

I am surprised the authors of the Unicode standard have such an idea.
I expect RA + virama + RI to produce RA-halant followed by RI, and
quite not repha+RI. After all, nobody is thinking that RA + virama + I
should produce II, isn't it? :-)
On a similar point, CDAC produce stand alone LI as if it were LA+RI
(which does save two slots in the character map). There are much more
similar examples in other scripts (the lla/au mark in Tamil comes to
my mind).
I do not think it is obvious. For example, CDAC products (like iLeap)
do not produce the repha-RI form but instead a "normal" RI matra below
"normal" RA (even in Sanskrit mode). OTOH, iTrans (and I believe
F.Verthuis' devnag) do produce the repha-RI (and even repha-LII)...
I believe it is rare enough for not being mentionned in ISCII.
In fact, ISCII does not mention any particular rendered syllable,
being Devanagari ru, Tamil or Malayalam ku or whatever.
