in the USSR. Moscow, 1984, pp. 126-243.  (this seems to be the best
source in English)

America. Delhi, 1987.
There is much more literature in Russian, of course. If you have any
questions or need any details of Stcherbatsky's biography, I shall be
glad to give you all the answers.
Unfortunately even in Russian there is hardly any literature on Esper
Esperovitch Ukhtomsky.
Hope it will help.
