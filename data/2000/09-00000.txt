[Re: Inputting Sanskrit Dictionary(Bon-wa Daijiten)]
Speaking as an attorney but not expert in copyright law, I think fair use of
copyrighted material, especially electronic material that is not always
available, could well include making a copy for personal use.  I would
respectfully suggest you not take your copyright advice from Indologists,
but consult a good copyright lawyer.
