Evils of Written Vedas? (apology for cross-posting)
Dear Madhav,
The variant from the Yaaj~nvalya Zik.saa is perhaps
yathaa-likhita-paa.thaka.h instead of yathaa likhita-paa.thaka.h.
For a correct recitation of the veda, it is necessary to learn it through
oral transmission
and the written text is just for help to the teacher. I have seen some times
that those who do not memorize the text with accents and try to recite it
with
the help of the text are able to read the words but cannot pronounce the
accents
correctly. I recorded the Atharvaveda from Gujarat some years ago. The Pandit
did not do his svaadhyaaya regularly. He tried to recite the text with the
help
of the printed one and made blunders in his recitation.
