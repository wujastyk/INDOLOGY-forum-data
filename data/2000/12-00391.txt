Unfortunately 'official' Maldivians have a lot of problems with their
history. They want to literally bury their past prior to their Islamic
conversion and don?t want any facts, which might disturb their mythical
history.

Clarence Maloney in his well researched article titled ?Where Did the
Maldives People Come From?? says  ?What was not known previous to my
research in the early 1970s, is that there is a strong underlying layer of
Tamil population and culture. So far, most Divehis have not shown
themselves interested in accepting this finding, as it does not suit their
sense of their prestigious origins. Be that as it may, the evidence is
overwhelming. There is a clear Tamil substratum in the language, which also
appears in place names, kin terms, poetry, dance, and religious beliefs?
