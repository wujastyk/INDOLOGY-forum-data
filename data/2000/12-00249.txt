This list is not designed as a forum for insults, accusations, or
political lobbying. 
I'm getting pretty fed up with the lack of self-control shown by some
recent posters, and I shall now recommence summarily unsubscribing people
who persistently ignore the scope and purposes of this list.
I shall issue one warning before unsubbing a person.
This is such a warning.
