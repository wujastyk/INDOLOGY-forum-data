Abbas wrote:
The Jews do not form 5-10% of the population of Europe. Even before the
Holocaust, the Jews hardly made up for such a high percentage.
Jews have never monopolised intellectual fields in Europe, they have in
fact contributed substantial. F.Mendelsohn, S.Freud, A.Einstein and
J.Derrida are wellknown representatives for the latter, not the former.
