History of Mughalstan (or so it was)

Perhaps you should consider the following: if you do not want anyone to
read and respond to something you write, then it may be better not to write.
We have seen a good many amateuristic and unreasonable things on this list
in the past years, but this looks like a special case: something like an
attempt at a methodological justification of unreasonableness. No one (also
not I) can be held responsible for whatever weird ideas others impute to them,
and no one can reckon with the randomness of prejudice / eccentricity etc.
which some persons in the reading public may come up with. To defend oneself
in advance against all possible unforeseen imputations is plainly
impossible, and nobody should expect it. In future, please just see what others
write, instead of imagining what they might write, or what you would want them to
write, etc.
Does this mean that you cannot answer by yourself? All right, after
reading your previous message: yes, you _are_ doing it just for the fun of the
polemic.
