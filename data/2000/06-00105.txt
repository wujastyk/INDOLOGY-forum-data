A good place to start is Braj Kachru's The Indianization of English.  It
is a statistical and sociolinguistic study of the common features of
Indian English.  There has been a lot of work done in the field of
Code-mixing/switching between Indian languages and English. Ira Pandit's
monograph on Hindi-English Code-switching is an excellent document of this
phenomenon.  OUP Delhi recently published a collection of essays entitled
South Asian English: Structure, Use and Users with articles by such
notable authorities on contact and code-interaction as Kachru, Ferguson,
Sridhar among others.

Hope this helps,
