ulUkhala (was pie/sanskrit)
I guess this is from the 1955 review by Thieme of "The Sanskrit
language" by T. Burrow, Language 31: 428-457. However Witzel rejects
this  IE explanation of his old teacher Thieme. Especially in the
layer-by-layer analysis of the RV in the more recent researches
and he permits Drav. to occur in this part.
