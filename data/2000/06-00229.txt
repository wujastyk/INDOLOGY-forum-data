Dear Himanshu,

Perhaps we should resort to a division of labor.  Let us leave it to the
philologists and paNDitas to try to figure out what the RV says.  And we will
leave it to the philosophers and vipras to tell us what the RV means.

As for the name dIrghatamasin, it is not a name that I have presumptuosuly
chosen for myself.  No, it was, rather playfully, assigned to me by an
Iranist, after I had suggested that the Gathic hymns of Zarathustra might
well deserve comparison with the corpus of hymns attributed to dIrghatamas.
Both corpora are roughly the same size, and in my view roughly of the same
date, and not very far from each other geographically, too.  A RSi like
dIrghatamas is a good representative of the type of tradition that
Zarathustra was raised in, and eventually departed from.  This is a project
that I hope to return to and complete some day soon.

As for names, I am presently interested in the etymology of the second part
of yours.

Best wishes,

George
