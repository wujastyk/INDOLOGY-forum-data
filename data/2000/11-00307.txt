MacDevnag (fwd)
Software testers required.  Do you use a Mac, TeX, and Devanagari?
MacDevnag
Someone called Bernard Desgraupes has just emailed me to say that he
has ported devnag to the Mac, giving it a suitably Mac-type interface.
If the thing works I think it would be good to add it -- or at least a
pointer to it -- to the CTAN directory. But Macs are beyond me, so I
can't test it out. Do we know anyone who might like to try it?
