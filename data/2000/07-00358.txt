Similes & Metaphors
Many Indian philosophical texts have a liking for similes and
metaphors to illustrate the point in hand -- certainly Buddhist texts
I read have a great number of these.  Some are well-known stock
similes but others are more unusual.   I was wondering if anybody has
researched or compiled a list of such similes ?
Best wishes,
