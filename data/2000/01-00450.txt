Sacred Offering
Heritage: Danish woman presents Pune with an audio archive of the Vedas
                        <snip>
Thank-fully Guni Hesting Kirchheiner, a Danish scholar, who dared to dream
of recording the four Vedas, each syllable uttered to perfection, and
preserving them for posterity. Now that dream is secure in an audio archive
of 226 cassettes.
