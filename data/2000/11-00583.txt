Re. Black as Evil

Swaminathan:

<<. . .it is something almost archetypal that isn't
going away any time soon, no matter how thoroughly it
is explained.>>

An archetypal disease. Like herpes then?


Kendra Crossen Burroughs:

<<. . .there could be a third way of writing about
these subjects, which is to present a tradition from
the inside. . .>>

Then wouldn?t the presenter in effect be submitting
his or her self as an anthropological artifact? ? a
