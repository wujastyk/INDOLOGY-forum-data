I am looking for a photocopy of an article by Pischel in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft, vol. 35 1881 (old series), probably on pp. 717-724.

This issue is lacking in our national collection at the Royal Library of Denmark.

Could any one please send me a photocopy of these pages?

Sincerely,
