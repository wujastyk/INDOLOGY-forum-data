Subject: Etymology of sukha and duHkha
Message-ID: <161227056817.23782.2298908687979208537.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I find the following etymological conclusions quite humorous, though! There
is fun in doing etymology, after all!!!

Pratap

>> "Sukha, mfn. (said to be fr. 5.su+3.kha and to mean originally 'having a
>> good axle-hole;'
>> Oppositely, duHkha would refer to the state of not having such a good hole.
