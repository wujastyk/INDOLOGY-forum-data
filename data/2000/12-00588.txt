The main problem is non-willingness to accept the existence of Dravidian
and Munda families independent of IA. Let me give 2 quotes from Prof. Witzel,
(the entire message forwarded is attached).

               Guillaume,

  Honestly, I think you waste your valuable time arguing with (most of) these
  guys. As you have seen some month(s) ago, many/most of them have no idea
  about [comparative] linguistics -- or even of several non_Indian languages
  as such!

  I pointed out the relevant linguistic literature --Beekes, Szemerenyi
  etc.-- politely and privately to (dr.!) Kalyanaraman, -- who, a year later,
  still writes nonsense like this :

     >>The basic methodological problem
     >> with linguistics as it has evolved is this: excessive reliance upon
     >> phonetics and some intimations of morphology and grammatical
     >> structures. It would appear, that this discpline is flawed because
     >> adequate methodologies have not been evolved to delineate or
     >measure,
     >> 'semantic structures and semantic distances' between languages.

   The man either does not read these basic introductions or does not
   understand them. He simply is not to be 'taught': we (Archaeology & Skt.)
   had invited him, on his insistence, to Harvard some 2-3 years ago. Meadow
   and I then still had the (vain) hope that we might be able to tell him
   about thorough and solid methods and that he could/would use his time &
   computer, not just for aberrant fantasies about Soma = electrum but for
   some real archaeological or linguistic work on the Indus period -- even if
   this would be just a website like the very useful(!) and well-organized
   harappa.com, which is run by an arch. amateur/afficionado as well.

   Well, K. came, plus followers, and talked to us, in baseball cap and
   all....  and I have never heard a more *confused* presentation, jumping
   from one topic to the next, and backwards. With no  inherent logic,
   conclusions, results (a mess, just like the web site).  In fact, I do not
   remember ONE single *useful* item from that talk.

   Of course, as always, we were polite, we had a long discussion, and we
   still *tried* to talk about methodologies... He readily "agreed", but you
   now see his 'results' all over the list/Sarasvati website!  One of my
   colleagues left in a huff, and I got 'scolded' for inviting such a hopeless
    fellow... Well, hope springs eternal...

   Repetition of prejudice does not make up for inside knowledge. So, you are
   right:

               >No, you really don't get the point.

   (In addition he now is 'pissed'  -- to speak American -- that Farmer & I
   included him in a list of revisionists & Hindutva people ... he should feel
   honored instead, from his point of view! At any rate, I am amused to see
   that in every other message he now refers to our "yellow journalism" in
   "glossy magazines" (Le renard et les raisins?) and that even the widely
   used Kyoto-Harvard transcription (used even for Tamil with a few additional
   signs...)  is 'bad'. Who cares?  The users decide as long as the
   America-centric lower ASCII survives. )

   Again: these guys still do no get it AT ALL about comp.ling.:
   first, human speech organs-based sound correspondences/laws and language
   family-typical grammatical formantia, only then syntax, and finally, even
   less of [single word] semantics (which is, with Kalyanaraman, an excuse to
   correlate anything with anything, in Indian languages, that looks vaguely
   similar: Kratylos, Nirukta, Pseudo-Voltaire revived...  just to get his
   Pan-Indian "Prakrt" of 3000 BCE).

   Perhaps, you could tell them that an Indian horse ain't related to an
   Indian cow - only because both exist in India and graze on the same
   meadow... The zebu being a local breed, the horse (Equus caballus), NOT
   (you'll be killed for that example!) And, they do not talk to each other in
    a proto-Indianese animal language (a Mammal Prakrt) but just roam the same
    pasture.

  In ultimate reduction and analysis, these guys just cannot stomach it, --as
  you compared about la douce France--, that one (accidental/incidental
  political) entity like present (France or China or the USA or) India might
  comprise several language families. What is the big loss? What about the
  Swiss who thrive on it?

  In short, labour lost... unless you want to preach to the deaf: 1 or 2 may
  listen...

  (Ceterum censeo equum sivalensem esse delendum.)

  And, many thanks for keeping up your list, all of which I have read,
  especially the VERY interesting and informative discussions about Koguryo,
  -- but I was too busy to participate this year -- and of course, I am not
  specialized when it comes to O.Ch./TB consonants/vowels, etc. And I do not
  want to run off my mouth about such E.A. ling. topics, like the
  Kalyanaramans, Manansalas and Agarwals (not even to begin with Fraudley et
  comp.ie) of this world do about India, without providing a shred of hard
  evidence ... that would stand up to peer review.

  Enough said / alam araNyarodanena/ Genug des Guten / Cela suffit!

  Joyeux Fe^tes:
  Good Holidays & success and all the best for the new millennium, 2001 !

  ...the linguistic authority of a former engineer and computer specialist...

 Hindutva proponents generally cannot stomach that a country as large as
 India (not to speak of the whole subcontinent) should have languages that
 do not belong to the "Sanskrit group".

 Instead, (non-linguist) writers from S. Kalyanaraman (web site) to Subhash
 Kak (in print, at Poona, BORI) speak of an original Prakrit (all the while
 misusing the technical term, used for certain Middle Indo-Aryan languages,
 spoken AFTER Vedic Sanskrit);  their kind of Pkt. would include pre-Pali,
 pre-Hindi as well as pre-(ancient)-Tamil...

 They also misappropriate the studies, made over the past fifty years or so,
 of a 'lingustic area'  such as the Sprachbund of the Balkans, where
 languages have increasingly influenced each other and have evolved certain
 common grammatical categories (e.g., the postposited article in Bulgarian
 and Rumanian). Archaic India would have had such an ancient "sprachbund",
 speaking various sorts of "Prakrits". (Sometimes, Sanskrit is viewed as
 having been 'artificially' created, by Panini!]  --  Even nowadays,
 however, Greek, Bulgarian, Rumanian, Albanian, (etc.)  -- each of them from
 a different Indo-European sub-family: Greek, Slavic, Romanic, etc. --
 *still* differ from each other in basic vocabulary and grammar and are NOT
 mutually understandable.

               Just as e.g., Marathi, Tamil, and Santali.

 To compare the similar situation, in size and antiquity, of Europe: nobody
 there is bothered that Finnish, Esthonian, Hungarian (etc.)  do not belong
 to the Indo-European but to the Uralic language family. And, that Basque
 descends from an old European language  that is much older than both. And,
 that we also have Turkish languages (in Turkey, European Russia), and even
 the (Buddhist) Mongolian Kalmyks (west of the Volga, near former
 Stalingrad)...
 (Not to speak of  a number of smaller Uralic languages in N. Scandinavia
 and N. Russia, and all the various Caucasian etc. languages in southernmost
 Russia, and beyond).

 Nobody thinks a Basque or Finn to be less "European" than a Portuguese or a
 Swede.
 Nor -- obviously-- do the various Balkan peoples think they form an ethnic
 unit.
 If linguistic diversity and several language families can be tolerated in a
 large sub-continent of Asia such as Europe (and in nation states with
 several official languages such as Finland (2-3), Belgium (3), Switzerland
 (4) etc.,) why not in India? (The constiutution mandates it anyhow!)

 The "primordial Prakrit" slogan and the denial of a Dravidian language
 family (stretching  from from Brahui in Baluchistan and Kurukh, Gondi in
 teh Vindhyas to Tamil) is just another political ruse, intended at "nation
 building" and  promoting "national unity." It has nothing to do with
 linguistic reality.

I suggest to submit Indian language materials to any *disinterested*
linguist of *any* national background, such as to specialists of
sub-Saharan African, Amerindian, Australian or Papua languages, and see
what they come up with: it will be the same language families that all
other linguists, Indo-European or Drav., will enumerate to you:

 We have at least 7 major language families in South Asia: Indo-European,
 Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic (Munda, Khasi in Meghalaya), Tibeto-Burmese
 (Himalayan belt, Arunachal, Nagaland, Manipur etc.), Thai-Kadai-etc.
 (Khamti in Assam = Ahom), Burushaski (in Hunza,  etc.), Andamanese (part of
 Indo-Pacific?), and many small remnant groups, unrelated to any larger
 families, such as Kusunda (C. Nepal), the substrates of Nahali (on the
 Tapti-- the "oldest" Indians), Tharu, Vedda, etc.
 -- plus, the unknown language(s) of the Indus civilization.
