The date of Sankara

Now, you agree that Sankara possibly lived as late as 850 CE.
Kunjunni Raja's analysis when updated with Vacaspati
(late 10th century) makes it rather more like 900 CE. Pl. note
that while Kunjunni subtracts only around 40 years from
vAcaspati to get to Sankara, a liberal 75 yrs. were taken out
to reach this 900 CE. I don't know  how Bhaskara comes
into this unless he or his successors lived between 850-900 CE.
