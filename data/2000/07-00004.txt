Harappan 'non-texts'?
Probably, the IVC did not care about developing much writing
even though they interacted heavily with Sumerians;
Just used some logographic symbols to denote the owner's name
or kulam in the seals . W. A. Fairservis points to composite
animals representing a combination of diiferent groups.
However, it appears IVC should have developed mnemonics well enough.
And traditions of grammatical analysis. Parpola and others point
to crab as denoting graha(planet), fish as denoting star using
Dravidian words common to fish/star etc.,
IE spread from the PIE homeland (Southern Russia?) all over the
world. But the linguistic analysis of an IE language was done
only in the IVC region, not anywhere else. The reason: After the
language change, the acculturated IVC people applied their language
analysis skills to Sanskrit and developed it further.
Both Sanskrit and Tamil have traditions of poetry long passed on
orally before being rendered in writing. Tamil classical poetry
content is so unique, and it could not have been produced just when
writing was introduced a couple of centuries before Christ.
Centuries of selection of words, grammar and aestheics must
have preceded.
