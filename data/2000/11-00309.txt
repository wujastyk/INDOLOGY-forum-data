    The following news item carried in the Gazette (Montreal, p B6) of
November 11, 2001 is further evidence that tampering with facts by scholars
may be a widespread phenomenon (I am assuming that the Gazette report is
accurate).
    Shinichi Fujimora, one of Japan's leading archeologists, dug holes at a
site some 300 kilometres of Tokyo and deposited some artifacts in them in
such a way as to make them appear part of one of the world's oldest known
places of human habitation.
    Unfortunately for Mr Fujimora, someone from the newspaper Mainichi
Shimbum managed to secretly videotape the archeologist planting the fake
evidence. The newspaper took this initiative because disturbing rumours
about Mr Fujimora's methods had been growing. Now, the Tokyo National Museum
has removed more than 20 pieces attributed to Mr Fujimora.
