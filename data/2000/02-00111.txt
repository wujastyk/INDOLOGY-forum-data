Augment i and DhAtupAThas
You might start with Paa.nini 7.2.10: ekaaca upade's'nudaattaat and
commentaries thereon.  Thus, the Mahaabhaa.sya (kielhorn III.285-6) lists
the bases that are anudaatta and the Kaa'sikaa and later commentaries
elaborate.  In addition, the Dhaatupaa.thas contain statements for separate
subsections, saying that such and such are se.t, ani.t or optionally
either.  There are good editions of these available.  Sincerely, George
Cardona
