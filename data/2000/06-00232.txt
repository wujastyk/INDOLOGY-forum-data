Heinrich Luders, VaruNa, II  VaruNa  und das Rta, Goettingen. Vandenhoeck &
Ruprecht. 1959, pp 486 ff  (Die SatyakriyA) contain a discussion of the
relevant Buddhist  references. Pp 496 ff deal with "Die SatyakriyA  in der
brahmanischen Literatur". This is of course considerably more than "some
simple information".
The whole Buddhist ritual of ParittAna (Skt. ParitrANa) is based  on the
notion that the truth, when told with lovingkindness (mettA = maitrI), is a
great force for healing and protection.
