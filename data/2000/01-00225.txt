I am trying to understand your point:
Is it that, in your opinion, the invading hordes were all male, they all
made concubines of every native female they encountered, all native males
were eliminated, and in this way the DNA of the invaders was watered down to
insignificance in an incredibly short period of time?
If so, this appears to be a very opportunistic way to try and bolster your
case.
Kindest regards
