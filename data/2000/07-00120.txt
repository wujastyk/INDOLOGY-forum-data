In rereading my recent analysis, I realize that one comment in it may
be incorrect. That doesn't change the general analysis, however.

My comment would only be correct if the same sign could refer to
different sounds at different times. The situation would be different
-- but still muddled -- if multiple signs referred *unambiguously* to
single sounds.

Dr. Elst: Could you clarify which is the case in Jha/Rajaram?
