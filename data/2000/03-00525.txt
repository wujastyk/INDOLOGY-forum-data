Prof. Kochar has not refuted the views of Prof. Satya Swarup Misra who has
presented a well-argued thesis on IE out of Bharat. I will separately present
a detailed list of etyma evaluated by Prof. Misra. "...That the Gypsy
languages are of Indo-Aryan origin is no more controversial...the Gypsy
dialects present sufficient evidence, which shows that Indo-Aryan a changed
into a,e,o in European Gypsy. Thus in a way the linguistic change in Gypsy,
suggests a clear picture of an assumption for a similar change in
Proto-Indo-European stage, of Indo-European a (as shown by Sanskrit and as
reconstructed by Bopp, Sleicher etc.) into dialectical a,e,o (as shown by Gk.
etc.). Uptil now no evidence to the contrary is available that
Proto-Indo-European a,e,o (as reconstructed by Brugmann etc.) have merged in
India...Gypsy languages show a repetition of the linguistic change, which
occurred in a remote history of Indo-Europeanj, when the original groups,
speakers of various historical languages, left their original homeland (India)
and travelled to Europe...the borrowed elements in the Uralic languages show
borrowed R.gvedic forms in 5000 BC...the date of RV must be beyond 5000 BC..."
