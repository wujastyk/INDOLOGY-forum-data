As a matter of principle, I think that material from handouts, personal
views expressed in lectures, or views put forward in conversation, in
private letters or email-exchanges should not be quoted unless the  source
has given his or her permission (such views should of course then be quoted
as "personal communication").

There may, however, be exceptions to this. If, for instance, NN travels the
world loudly and repeatedly claiming X and denying Y, s/he may not have the
same right to other people's discretion as less boisterous personalities. I
leave it to others to define other "grey zones".
