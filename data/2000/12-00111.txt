Subject: thanks for passage references

Hello Indology:

I'd just like to thank Valerie and Vidyansankar for their references
concerning the beginnings of the idea of "no karma". Also, if anyone has any
more references within either early Buddhism or Hinduism, it would be
appreciated. So far, I have not found too many early passages which are 100%
explicit about the accumulation of no karma being the goal.

Thanks,
