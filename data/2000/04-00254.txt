Message-ID: <161227058076.23782.16537785076807282439.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

*PLEASE* anyone who aims at joining the recently announced "indology"-list,
do *NOT* just hit the reply-button as mentioned in the announcement!
Indology (the present list) is apparently administered such that all reply
e-mails are sent to the list, and not to the original sender.

Regards,

Birgit
