I second Bjarte Kaldhol's majjhimaa pa.tipadaa.  The primary goal of this
list should be academic discussions of Indological matters and we don't
need to go into checking people's race, skin color, birth cirtificates,
nationalities, and passports.  None of these confer authenticity in the
arena of scholarship. Any such requirements are uncalled for.  However, if
there are signs of intemperate uncivilized language, the membership of a
poster should be ended after due warnings.  We all have the option of
deleting messages by looking at the subject line.  Best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
