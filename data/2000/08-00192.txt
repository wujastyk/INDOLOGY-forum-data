Gilgit Buddhist Manuscripts
Greetings-
There seem to be two publications available of the Gilgit Buddhist
manuscripts:
1 A reprint of the Vira/Chandra facsimilie edition, offered by Vedams books,
in 3 volumes.
2 A reprint of Dutt's 1939 4-volume edition, also offered by Vedams. Is this
a critical edition? If so, is it legible and/or reliable?
Is the Vira/Chandra reprint of good quality, that is, are the
photoreproductions decent enough to work from?
Thank you for any and all advice
Dante Rosati
