Subject: Dates of non-meteoric iron in India
Message-ID: <161227059251.23782.1904466238028427203.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 Archaeologists from India have pushed smelted iron back in time;
 these early iron will make it that smelting was first invented
 in the Vindhyas, is it not? Have chemists and archaeologists
 from outside India verified these datings?
