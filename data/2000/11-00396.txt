The world does not work like this.

There may be few left primarily because Western universities do *not* spend
vast amounts of money training and--more importantly--employing such
scholars. Look at any university's budget and you will see that the amount
spent is statistically insignificant. (Or, as they would say in Florida these
days, well within the margin of error.)


All the best,
