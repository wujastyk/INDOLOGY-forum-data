SV: SV: SV: Integrity of academia
I remember many regular Hindu pUjAs, in which many aSTakams and strotrams
are chanted where every part of a deity's body is praised including eyes,
nose, chest, knees, elbows, arms, armpits, toes and so on. Hindus are used
to this drill for time unknown. So even an implication of phallus is regular
devotion, nothing sexual but regular divine, no more than the sexy
sculptures on temple walls.
taittirIya saGhita explains the method of laying bricks and its relation to
waiste, thighs, legs of the cosmic person.
