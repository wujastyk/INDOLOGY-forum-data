Indology's Future?
Gosh, no. I think Indians (and people from other non-Western
cultures) who feel isolationistic should ask themselves how
much they are themselves influenced by Western ideas and
patterns. And make an honest attempt to answer this, before
harping upon isolationism. The answer is not to tell "them"
to go away and leave "us" alone. Instead, some of "us" should
study "them" in turn. In today's world, people should look
for more and better channels of communication, rather than
shutting down the existing ones.
