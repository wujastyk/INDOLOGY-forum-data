History of Mughalstan
As I feared, this thread is becoming an excuse for religious
propaganda, so I've had enough of it. But I do want to point out a
few more tendentious misrepresentations:

Well, I did read in your message:

etc. etc. Sorry that I responded to something that you wrote. ;-)
Don't be too sure, and don't idealise India so quickly. Just have a
look at what is happening right now in India: Assam, Kashmir, or a
terrorist Tamilian outfit that this very moment demands that
Karnataka recognise Tamil as the second official language of
Karnataka (spoken by approx. 3% there).
Yes: the royal family of the Netherlands is originally German; the
royal family of Sweden is originally French; etc. etc.
Once upon a time there was the Roman empire too...
I have lived in North America, Europe and in India (16 years of adult
life). Perhaps you should learn a bit more about Europe, if not live
there, before you make pronouncements about that part of the
world and make comparisons with India, if I may make this modest
suggestion. Bluff doesn't always work.
You did not hear that from me.
