     granite sculpture carved in the round, the 133 feet
     signify the number of chapters in the short text
     that Valluvar wrote. The pustakam in Valluvar's hand

     Secular in concepts, Tirukkural is full of compassion
     and love for humankind. It is unlike any other ancient
     literary product of India, emphasizing equality of all.
    "The maxims of Valluvar has touched my soul"
                         - Mahatma Gandhi
    "With sure strokes, the Kural draws the idea
     of simple ethical humanity. There hardly exists
     in literature of the world, a collection of
     maxims in which we find so much wisdom"
                         - Albert Schweitzer
    "Kural has entered into the very soul of a
     whole people. It proclaims in sweetest mystic
     couplets virtue, truth, wealth and joy"
                         - G. U. Pope
