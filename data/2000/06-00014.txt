Questions of Transliteration
Could you kindly indulge my very rudimentary question?
I am getting mixed signals from ?reputable sources?
concerning the correct transliteration of certain
Sanskrit words. This concerns the use of the Sanskrit
?n? and/or ?m? and the proper placement of the under
and over dot. The terms in point are:
1) sannyas / sa.nnyaas ? -- (i.e., ?renunciate?)
2) sa.nkhya / sa.mkhya ? -- (re. the philosophical
school).
With thanks.
