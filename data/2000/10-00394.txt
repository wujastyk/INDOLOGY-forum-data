"Science" in India
This is such a cop out !
Is this the only way you could defend mistakes in europeanist
theology ?
If making mistakes is ok ? why didnt you extend that logic to
Rajaram ? Is it because he is a native who doesnt agree with
Europeanist theology ?
Also, it is interesting to note that not one of the self
styled objective scholars had the integrity to criticize
Witzels manipulations and coverups. Wheras they have no
problems making sweeping comments about natives !!
