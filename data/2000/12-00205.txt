For what it's worth, Romila Thapar has been attacked by South Asian
Islamic fundamentalist for her truthful reporting on the excesses of
Mahmud of Ghazni's raids--a fact rather studiously ignored by her
Hindu fundamentalist detractors.  Somebody who manages to upset
fundamentalists on both sides must be doing something right!
