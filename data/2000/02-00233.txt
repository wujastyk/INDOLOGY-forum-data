New Web Site
Dear Indologists,
I am happy to announce a new Indology resource, "Archive of Indological
Resources Online," which
is located on the home page of Professor Gudrun Buhnemann at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison:
http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~gbuhnema/
The archive is currently under construction, and Professor Buhnemann would
appreciate it if Indology members would send her relevant lndological links
to add to the site.  She can be contacted at:
gbuhnema at facstaff.wisc.edu
There is also a form on the site for recommending new links.
The site contains resources such as Sanskrit transliteration fonts, links
to Sanskrit educational materials and programs on the net, and links to
publishers, booksellers, and journals.
All the Best,
Stuart
