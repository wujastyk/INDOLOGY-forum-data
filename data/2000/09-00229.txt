SV: "Buddha" before the Pali Canon?
Lars Fosse writes:
The historical context in which the Buddha is depicted appears to
predate the consolidation of Magadhan hegemony over a large area of
eastern India. So we can be fairly certain that whatever he spoke it
was not called Maagadhii at the time.
Whatever dialect he spoke would have been more related to the
dialects in use in Kosala/Benares or Videha. There is no reason to
suppose that would have been the same as the dialect spoken in
Maagadha proper.
Later of course the long period of rule from a capital in the area of
modern Patna may well have given a dialect from that area some kind
of administrative or cultural priority, but it would be quite
anachronistic to suppose that things would have been the same earlier.
The use of 'eastern' and 'western' to designate a linguistic
distinction is confusing. We know very little about the distribution
and variation, but it may well have varied considerably. In other
words, some so-called 'western' dialects were probably found in
geographically eastern areas. Moreover, there were undoubtedly
dialects with some 'eastern' features and not others.
The Asokan evidence in particular is controversial and may represent
early tendencies towards Sanskritization rather than local dialects
in the west. It is in any case quite limited.
I doubt the assumption that there was ever a single dialect in which
the Buddhist suttas were transmitted. They may have been handed down
in multiple dialects from the beginning.
