November flames
November has traditionally been a bad month for flames and arguments on
INDOLOGY.  Things build up in October and get nasty in the following
month.
Can we stay one step ahead this year?  I'd be very grateful if everyone
would make a special effort not to argue, and to stick to short, pithy
postings.  More pith, pleath.
