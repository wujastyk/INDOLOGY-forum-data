As a rough guide to subject content, if you enjoy receiving journals like
the JAOS, JRAS, BSOAS, IIJ, etc., then INDOLOGY is for you! If you don't
recognize these acronyms, think twice before joining. The forum is
targetted at professional participants in Indological studies, and is not
primarily a forum for discussions with undergraduates or scholars from
other fields who have an amateur interest in Indian history and culture.
For example, if you do not recognise any of the above acronyms, or never
read any of these journals, or if you never attend academic conferences in
some aspect of INDOLOGY, then perhaps another forum would be more
appropriate for you, since you will not be on the same wavelength as the
other members.

In a rather Buddhist manner, I think, I've tried to characterise
indologists by what they habitually do, not by what they are,  or what
formal qualifications they have.
More or less, yes.
It is impossible to know the "strength of an argument" unless you have a
thorough grounding in the field.
This "certain knowledge/instinct" can be profoundly misleading too, of
course.  Having grown up in a culture is absolutely not the same as having
an analytical knowledge of that culture.  That's why some Hindu students
fail courses in Hinduism (yes, it happens!).
I'm afraid your argument is based on a grossly oversimplified fantasy of
the foreign indologist.  Almost all the people I know who study classical
India professionally (Indian and non-Indian) have complex, multi-racial,
multi-cultural backgrounds, have lived in many countries, including India,
and speak several languages.  The ability of an indological scholar to
enter empathetically into an understanding of Indian culture depends on a
number of factors, including how self-reflective the scholar is, how good
a writer, how well-educated, how interested, and so on.  This applies
regardless of birthplace, caste, or gender.  You can't essentialize
scholars on the basis of geographical origins in any simple or even
worthwhile manner.
