The Seventeenth Annual South Asia Spring Symposium in Hawaii

The Center for South Asian Studies, University of Hawaii at Manoa,
will be holding the XVII Annual Spring Symposium on April 13th through
15th, 2000. The theme of this year's symposium is "Public Culture and
Democracy in South Asia". The annual spring symposium is one of the
highlights of the academic calendar on the Manoa campus and in the
community. Past years have included participants such as Ashis Nandy,
Sudipta Kaviraj, E.Valentine Daniel, Ayesha Jalal, the late
A.K.Ramanujan, Gyan Prakash, Kapila Vatsyayan and many others. The
symposium, held in the verdant campus of the University of Hawaii, is
made possible by the generosity of the G.J. and Ellen Watumull Fund,
in addition to support from the University of Hawaii's School of
Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific Studies.

Some (highly) subsidized accomodation on campus can be arranged for
out-station scholars. Those interested in presenting a paper at the
symposium should send a title and abstract of the proposed paper to
the CSAS through email (csas at hawaii.edu) or by fax (808-956-2682).

The deadline for receipt of title/abstracts is January 31st, 2000.
