Origins of the "double-truth"

Are you saying that the Buddhist "dual-truth" is so widespread
that there is nothing unique about it? But Gnosticism and
Manichaeism have to a lot to do with Iran and India. Similarly
Chinese Daoism was influenced by Buddhism early on.
In Greece, interactions intensified during Alexander.
There is a good possibility of Upanishads and Greek philosopher
contact with ideas traveling both ways. Esp. when time periods
for the veda and buddha are lowered.
Do you know any examples from Greece that clearly predate
Buddhist "dual-truth"?
