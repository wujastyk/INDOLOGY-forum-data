Hinduism and Colonialism
In another mail:
Tamil data do not agree with this. Not only some forms of
democracy and ballot casting were prevalent (uttaramErUr, etc.,).
Many CT poems are highly egalitarian, and the authors - both
men and women, were drawn from all castes. Valluvar in his kuRaL
declares, "in birth, all are equal". Prof. T.P.M. wrote a
book on CilappatikAram with the title, "kuTimakkaL kAppiyam"
('kAvya of the people'). Early Tamil bhakti poetry, at the
fountainhead of a mass cult that swept all across India,
was egalitarian in intent. It too drew inspiration and poets
from all the castes. After some centuries, Ramanujar made a
bold attempt to mitigate the caste effects through democratization.
