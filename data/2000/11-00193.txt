 Europeans have been living in Africa for centuries (eg. Afrikaners,
Kenyan whites, etc.); except for some `bronzing' of skin tone they do not
yet show any development of thick nose or curly hair, which, if at all
possible, would require at least 1000-10,000 years. Even the proposed
changeover from blonde to brunette hair has not taken place. Hence it is
likely that the Dravidians already possessed these features when entering
India.
 It is hypothesised that the Dravidians were displaced from these regions
as well. Certain place-names are said to be of Dravidian origin.
