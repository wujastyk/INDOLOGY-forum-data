After reading about Iron age in India from Possehl's article
(reference given by G. Thompson, I think), Farmer wrote:
"Chronologies re the first use of iron in Anatolia, in different
areas of India (and regional variations are *critical*) are
wholly independent of Egyptian and Assyrian chronologies. Same
for Central Asia and China. Even the use of terms like "Iron Age"
is, for good reasons, being widely challenged by people in the
field. In India - and this has deep implications for dating of
the RV and later Vedic literature - the dates have been pushed
well into the first millennium. For recent overviews and
extensive bibliography, see the studies in Vincent C. Pigott,
_The Archaeometallurgy of the Asian Old World_ (University
Museum, University of Pennsylvania, 1999)."

Prof. Witzel usually dates the Rigveda to 1200 BCE based on the
fact that iron in India is creeping upward chronologically, and
the RV is pre-iron. But if the dates for iron are pushed
"well into the first millennium", 1200 BCE date sounds
too conservative. Is your take on the date of the RV very
different from these?
