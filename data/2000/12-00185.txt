Black as Evil
While I sympathise and agree with Dr.Vassilkov's concern about
the ridiculous black/white nonsensical emails.
It must be pointed Indians have been subjected to this
kind of nonsense for a long long time.
Christian fundamentalists use these kinds of arguments in
their missionary literature.
Recently, It was pointed out on another list a few weeks ago
that the marxist academic Panikkar who has
been on a speaking tour of US universities has been stating
that the Aryans had invaded and subjugated
the Dravidians. The Aryans were uppercaste etc etc...
So I would second Vidyasankar's call that scholars should
keep themselves informed about abuses of their work.
