Akbar's death
"Nur'ul Haqq Dihlavi's Zubdat ut tavarikh gives the answer as indigestion,
followed by burning fever and diarrhea, with no medicine producing any
effect, and with the emperor finally expiring on 26 October 1605. No
suggestion of any foul play, and N's informant is Shaikh Farid Bukhari
Murtaza Khan, the Mir Bakhshi or imperial paymaster, an eyewitness source."
