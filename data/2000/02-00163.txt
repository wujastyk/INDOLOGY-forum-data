language, literature, and heliocentrism in India
The Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata (b. 473) contains the well-known statement
about the earth rotating; followed (annoyingly) by a statement about the
earth being central and the stars rotating.  Anyhow, this was certainly
controversial in the jyotisa tradition, and later writers such as
Varahamihira criticised Aryabhata roundly for deviating from the true
opinion of the Puranas and other such texts.
See Pingree, Jyotihsastra: astral and mathematical literaure, Wiesbaden
1981, for an orientation in this literature.
