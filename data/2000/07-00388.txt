In the absence of any evidence shown for the use of the time period of 70
centuries in the Indian tradition, the above statement has no merit.
In an earlier posting, I have linked '70 centuries' to the views of Rajaram.
We know that Rajaram and others  of his school insist that their views are
based on archaelogy, hydrology, etc. So, all the statements about Christian
religious beliefs by Arun Gupta are irrelevant and unwarranted vis-a-vis the
present discussion.
See above. Rajaram does not offer his views as based on religious belief.  It
is precisely because of presenting the date as based on scientific analysis,
Rajaram and others are able to convert many non-specialists to their point of
view.
