nAraNa_n, the tamil word for nArAyaNa (was: Vishnu)
Search for "nAlikam", three items will pop up. One entry will be:
*otl nAlikam nAlikam 02 crow*
nAlikam = kaakkai is a common item in Tamil dictionaries
in print as well. As you know, nAlikam = water buffalo
both in Tamil and Sanskrit.
Why not??? There more semantic field for the tamil root aN-,
not just elder brother. I already gave:
<<<
-aNa like tamil -aNan is Dravidian; Names like
MuttaNan, RaamaNan, KaruppaNan, RangaNan, PeriyaNan, Cin2n2aNan,
PaccaiyaNan, KongaNan, CembaNan, ... are common tamil male names.
If one wants an attestation prior to sAyaNa (which is an
'akam'/'interior' name and, maadhava which is a 'puRam'/
'exterior' name, if Burnell-Cowell theory is correct) consult
CilappatikAram. The aTiyArkku nallAr wrote his commentary
under the patronage of "poppaNa kAGkEyan" . Without
aTiyArkku-nallAr's work, we would have missed precious lot on ancient
Tamil music, ATiyArkkunallAr thanks PoppaNan profusely in the pAyiram:
   "kURRait tavirttu aruL poppaNa kAGkEyarkOn2 aLitta
    cORRuc cerukku allavO tamiz mUn2Ru urai colvittatE!"
In literature, pAmpaNan/pAppaNan/poppaNan can be found.
pAppu/pAmpu/poppu all refer to snake, and hence these
names refer to Shiva Nagalamkarar.
The root, aN- means "upper, elder, high" etc. in Tamil.
