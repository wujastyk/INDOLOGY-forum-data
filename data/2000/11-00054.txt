Book wanted
Dear list members,
I have been told that the following book is unavailable.
English translation of Bharatiya Jyotish Sastra (History of Indian
Astronomy) Translated by R.V. Vaidya . Issued under the authority of the
Director General of Meterology, New Delhi, India.  Published by Controller
of Publications, Civil Lines, Delhi, 1981.  2 Volumes.
Would any of the list members possibly have it and be willing to sell it?  I
very quickly glanced through it at the New York Public Library Oriental
Collections and I thought it seemed quite good.  I seem to recall (but I
could be wrong) that it even went so far as to give some information about
panchangs being published in India.
