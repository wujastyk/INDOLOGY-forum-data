That is fine. It is just that the philosophical flavor of KusumAnjali seems
to be inconsistent with the philosphical environs of its supposed dating.

So the main question seems to be whether the author of KusumAnjali is the
same as the author of Atmatattvaviveka. So are there internal references in
the works themselves, which assert this?
