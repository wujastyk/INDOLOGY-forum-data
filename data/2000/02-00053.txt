Regarding the Upanishads.

Ah, but the boxer and the historian are not at odds, otherwise, the boxer

the historian would otherwise not be there to remind:

yAthAtathyato 'rthAn vadadhAc chAzvatIbhyaH samAbhyaH
and so it goes, then,
vidyAM cAvidyAM ca yastad vedobhayaM saha
avidyayA mRtyuM tIrtvA vidyayAmRtam aznute
with all due respect, of course, for historian and boxer--either wise
enough to ply their trade--know that the context in which an event--or
quote--occurs is inseparable from its relevance and meaning,
