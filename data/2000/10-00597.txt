Buddhism in Bangladesh
Hello Listmembers:
Does anyone have any idea where I can locate articles/books on the Buddhist
groups in the area near Chittagong etc. in present day Bangladesh? I heard
that H. Bechert wrote some articles on this but I have not yet been able to
locate them. Does anyone have any idea of the journal and/or book in which
H. Bechert's or other articles on this subject are located?
Thanks,
