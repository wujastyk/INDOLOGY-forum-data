The Pali "potthaka" is usually explained by Tamilists
from the following root words. Online Tamil Lexicon:

I) pottu 1. covering, stopping, closing up; 2. mending,
botching, closing a hole; 3. rent or puncture;

II) pottu-tal 01 1. to bury; 2. to cover, close, as the mouth,
eyes or ears, with the fingers or otherwise; 3. to close the
fingers together; 4. to mend, patch,botch, as baskets or bags;
5. to stitch; 6. to hide, conceal; 7. to beat, flog; 8. to
light, as a fire; 9. to tie, string together, as a wreath;
10. to invent, imagine; 11. to mix,unite; 12. to be filled

You can see all the meanings of the pustakam, a sanskritzed
form of 'pottakam' is contained in the root verb 'pottu-tal'.
"nuval" has been used in Old Tamil to mean various meanings such as
'to utter, to say, to sing, to sing the praise'. "nUl"
formed from "nuval" also means pustakam and thread.
Note that 'prabandham' and 'grantam' also refer to books
written on leaves tied together by thread.

Steve Farmer's theory of IVC being an oral society,
which used very little writing has relevence to tamil
'nUl' which in earlier times meant 'to say, recite' etc.
and ultimately having one meaning 'book'. The IE folks
went to many regions in the world, however the oral
preservation of the oldest IE texts tookplace *only* in
the IVC by the acculturated Aryans, and not anywhere else.

Earliest inscriptions are written by the shramana sects.
For example, Asokan inscriptions. Earliest Tamil inscriptions
are have many gifts to Jain monks. There are claims by Sri Lankan
archaeologists for writing to have started arond 600 BC. The earliest
coins found in Sri Lanka contain unique Tamil names found
in Sangam texts and these coins are dated to 3rd
