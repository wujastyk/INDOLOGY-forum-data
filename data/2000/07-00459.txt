Subject: inverted commas
Message-ID: <161227060386.23782.3936696822881673429.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

When any statement is placed in inverted commas, the assumption is that it is being reproduced exactly. Any  comment added by the quoter should be placed in square brackets. If  any statement is being referred to from memory,one should say so,. One could ffor example say I am paraphrasing, or recalling from memory.
