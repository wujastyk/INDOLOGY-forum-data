Siva and Vishnu (was: Kinship systems)
..> >The problem may be due to incorrect usage of transliteration in
For the occurrence of the word "vaiNavam"
from cologne digital tamil textbase:
http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/ttt_search.html
The saivite text KantapurANam (approx 10-11th century CE):
Qkan3120x3 \BT neRi varum av Alayattil ceRikin2Ra vaiNavarkaL neTitu nOkkic \et
[a rough and verbatim translation: "...in that temple, the thronging Vainavites
stared..."]
Other occurrences are from tiruviLaiyATar purANam,
a very staunch Saivite text that of course describes the 64 leelas of Siva in
Madurai:
#1:  Qtiv23x11x3x1438x3 \BT coRRa tantira vaiNavat toTakkuNTu tiriyum \et
#2: Qtiv23x7x2x1434x2 \BT varuvatu Aka agku oru pakal vaiNavap paTivap \et
#3: Qtiv23x14x4x1441x4 \BT pollArAy vaiNavattup pukku ozuku tAy tantai poRArkaL
Aki \et
#4: Qtiv23x31x4x1458x4 \BT van2pu pUNTu ozuku vaiNavam pUNTu poRai irakka mAn2a
nIttOr \et
Note that occurrences #3 and #4 very clearly denigrate Vainavism:
#3: pollArAy = "behaving like evil men"
that is "Entering Vainavism and behaving like evil men and not even able to
bear their own mothers and fathers..."
#4 means: "[they], having undertaken to follow Vainavism that bears evil
[ways], renounced [tha virtues of ] patience, mercy and self-respect".
Being nearly 1000 years old that should serve the purpose at hand I suppose
(whatever it may be:-)).
