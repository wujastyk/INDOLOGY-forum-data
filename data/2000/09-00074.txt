Urdu speakers
What SA was alluding to was that half the population of present day
Bangladesh are not native Bengalis (thus not "inferior" Dravids and Kafir
converts) at all but descendants of ?blue blooded? immigrant (liberators in
his parlance) Turks, Pathans, Arabs etc., who were duped into believing
that they are part of the native Bengali mass by the Indian (i.e Hindu)
infiltrated formerly Hindu  ?low? Bengalis. Thus the underlying message is
that the 50% of Bangladeshis were wrong in supporting the war for
liberation because they are not Bengalis at all!!. Further the message is
that they have more in common with the Arab, Turk and Pathan "derived"
Punjabi, Sindhi, Muhajir Pakistanis than with the "converted" natives.
Following is a list of revisions of history that I being attempted
1) Pakistanis irrespective of ethnicity are not of indigenous origin but
descendants of invading ?liberators?.
2) Urdu is of Turkish, Arab and Iranic origin.
3) 50% of Bangladeshis are descendants of the ?liberators?.
This is part of the revising of history, which is going on in Pakistan and
Bangladesh by the likes of Jamat e Islami, and other collaborators of the
genocide of the people of Bangladesh during the war for liberation in 1971.
There are scores of books, websites and discussion email groups where you
can find enough information on this regard. A cursory browsing of the
archives of a premier Bangladeshi discussion group
(www.egroups.com/list/alochona) will enlighten many of the efforts of such
revisionists.
It would be interesting to see what the E. Timorese collaborators would
come up as an excuse for their role in suppressing the E. Timorese
independence movement 20 years from now. May be they should start getting
lessons from sub continental revisionists :-)
