IS IT THE TIME TO COME UP WITH A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR INDIA ?
Dear Dr. Griffith:
                   I would propose that the Federal Government ( called the
Central Government ) should be able to intervene with whatever force it
feels necessary to protect the basic human rights of people - right to
live; right that they not be subjected to extorsion, or failing to pay the
demand - be murdered ; women not be raped and murdered and their naked body
left in a garage  or no parallel courts exist within the country of India
where trial is held by gangs and people get executed , and so on. Such is
the condition of this great India to-day .
                What is preventing this Central Government from acting - it
is the sacred cow called the constitution . The Prime Minister of India
makes statement in Parliament that his party does not have the strength to
uphold the President's Rule, which means direct Central Rule. Even the
former Prime Minister Mr Gujral is not free from this episode where the
balme ought to be go on him too. He removed the chief of the Central Bureau
of Investigation who was trying to correct the problem . Mr. Gujral stood
from the city where all or most of these things are happening . Now ,
seeing the problems, and concern about his association with criminals, he
has left and gone to Punjab , to avoid all of these embarassment .
              People are being beaten up and being subjected to extorsion,
even in jails . What can you say about the state government .
