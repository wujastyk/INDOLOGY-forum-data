The statements on the web site of the Deutsche Welle:
http://kleist.dwelle.de/hindi/audio.html regarding the history of their
Sanskrit radio broadcast
 -- worldwide first in Germany in 1966(!); next, after questions on this in
Indian parliament, also in India --
lead me to (1) a remark and (2) a question.
(1) This would be a nice example of what the Austrian anthropologist
Agehananda Bharati called "the pizza-effect": a cultural phenomenon is
suddenly much more appreciated in its original country/environment if it
receives attention and appreciation abroad.
(2) Who -- some German Indologist, I assume, but which one -- was
instrumental in getting a Sanskrit broadcast on the German radio in 1966?
