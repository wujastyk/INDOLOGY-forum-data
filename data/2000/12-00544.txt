SV: Origins of the "double-truth"

 There's an interesting recent article on the YS as being an extension
 of a Indo-European tradition.  It doesn't definitively address
 language but looks at "cognate" themes in the YS and the Odyssey
 among other references.  N.J. Allen "The Indo-European prehistory of
 yoga," International Journal of Hindu Studies 2, 1 (April 1998): 1-20.
 As far as I know there are suggestions of the YS being an extension
 of earlier Sanskrit sources (Hiranyagarbha, etc.) and its ideas being
 pre-Indo-European...but non-Sanskrit YS "text" I have not heard of.
 Have you found something to suggest this?
 Does Allen give examples of Yoga practices among Celta and Germanic
tribes, OR just only Greek examples? Yoga can also be a term (IE?) used
to describe a phenomenon encountered in India.
