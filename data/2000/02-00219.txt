Those interested in pursuing the very common Indian theme of gender
transformation in religious, mythological, and other contexts might like to
look at my paper on this topic, "Transsexualism, Gender and Anxiety in
Traditional India."  Journal of the American Oriental Society. Vol.113,.
no. 3. 1993 pp. 374-401 in which I discuss a number of examples of the
theme.
