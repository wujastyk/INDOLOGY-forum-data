Dear List members,

Donald Allan Nelson completed a Ph.D. dissertation on the following topic
at the  University of Chicago in 1974:  _The "Brhatkatha" : a
reconstruction from the "Brhatkathaslokasamgraha,"
"Perunkatai," and "Vasudevahimdi_.  He is said to have left the field of
South Asian studies a few years later. Can anyone give me his current
address or the address of a person likely to know his whereabouts?
