To be clear:
I have no opinion, and should not,  on the following claim or that of
anyone else (H.Benson, or recently, the one about the Hare Krishna mantra).

William Sands, PhD:
Witzel: His [Benson's] claims therefore should be seriously compared...
WS: His claims have been seriously compared with others on the list. One
result can be found in the following paper: Eppley, K.,
...."Transcendental Meditation had significantly (p<.005) larger effect
size (2 to 3 X) than the other groups, which were not significantly
different among themselves. This study included research on Benson's
relaxation response."

Apart from the fact that, apparently,  2 different things are compared here
1989(!), i.e.  "trait anxiety":: general use of "mantras"  across cultures
(Benson, forthc., 2000),
I reply, with the usual philologist's suspicion:

Isn't it a trifle surprising that some claim and insist that their Mantra
(Hare Krishna....), and others that their method (MT) have the best effect,
and Benson :  both/neither?

As I said, I leave the investigation of the METHODS and RESULTS to
non-involved, *independent* scientists. For the time being, it seems a
little too early to come to conclusions, and certainly so for non-medical
people like me.
And, please do not rely on my anecdotal reports, but read Benson's paper,
due now any day.

Ever wondered about the repetitive movements of zoo animals? the only thing
they can do...
