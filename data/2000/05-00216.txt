A question on ArAyirappaTi guruparamparAprabhAvam
Dear List members,
I need the text of the passage in ArAyirappaTi guruparamparAprabhAvam,
dealing with parAzarabhaTTar worshipping in tirunArAyaNapuram and going on to
the home of mAdhavadAsar (later naJjIyar). I would appreciate if anybody
could provide this either on the list or off the list. Thanks in advance.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
