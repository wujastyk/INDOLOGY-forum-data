Kanchi mutt's connection with Shankaracharya
I am observing with interest the recent discussion on the dating of
Shankaracharya's time period.
This calls into a question yet another dispute that exists within Shankarite
circles,
ie. the link of the kanchi mutt to Shankara.
Traditionally, it is acknowledged that only 4 mutts were personally
established by Shankara
and the kanchi mutt does not feature in this list. The kanchi mutt however
insists that it is
Shankara who personally established this mutt as his last mutt before he
departed from this mortal world.
Consequently, the debate also extends to the place of his final departure.
The Kanchi mutt considers
this place to be kanchipuram while the others point to Badari, Himalayas,
north india, etc.
What is the verdict on these disputes if there is one from the Indological
viewpoint ?
