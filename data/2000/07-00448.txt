Just a thought :
Frog (mu"ndaka.h) represents jeevaatmaa or aatmaa inVedas. The female figure
may represent Shushumna or Kundalini. Resting on the left hand of frog  and at
the same time contact with the right shoulder of frog, is indicative of this.
In non-tantrik terms, she would be Vaak.

For all this is worth!
