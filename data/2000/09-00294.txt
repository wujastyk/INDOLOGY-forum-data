Hindu women's caste status
Dear Scholars,
I am writing a conference paper, and am stuck in a place with a question:
Is a Hindu woman considered to be 'reborn' at the time of her marriage?
If yes, is she 'reborn' into her husband's caste?
If her birth-caste is different from the caste of the family she is
marrying into, what is her own caste after marriage?
Please help me out.  Thank you.
