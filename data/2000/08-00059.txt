Franz Osten: "Life of the Buddha"
Dear list members,
a friend of mine told me about a documentary film, titled "Das Leben des
Buddha" ("Life of the Buddha") which was directed by Franz Osten in
1928. According to his informations there is only one copy of the film
which has survived in some archive in Poona. Does anyone of you know
more about the film, its whereabouts and how a copy of it could be
procured?
Thanks
jn
