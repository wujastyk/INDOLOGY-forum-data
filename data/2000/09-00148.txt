NCOLR Seminar Mo 18 & Tu 19 Sep 2000 (fwd)
NCOLR Seminar Mo 18 & Tu 19 Sep 2000 Cambridge UK
Though many people will have heard of the NCOLR Seminar in Cambridge
earlier this year a reminder at this time seems sensible.
We may do one completely new thing this year, something on video and
audio sources for language learning on the Internet, Cambridge now has
sophisticated access to source material in many languages.
If you are interested simply e-mail
