While discussing subjects of beavers and IE climate, a hypothesis may be
formulated as follows: Glacial records of vegetation and climate changes show
the coldest part of the Younger Dryas around 12,800-11400 cal.y.a and a cold
event again at 8,200 cal.y.a. 

The battle-axe warriors, traders and navigators from Bharat, from the
Sarasvati River Banks close to Khetri mines [see Prof. Kenoyer's route map
from Kalibangan (sarasvati_) to Harappa (parus.n.i_) ca. 2500 BC] might have
dispersed as the desiccation of the river progressed(and bronze tools trade
with Mesopotamia and tin trade with Ga_ndha_ra regions waned) to the now
habitable Caspian, Urals etc. 'vouru' (pastures)...

Basis: [Apart from the underlying economic assumption that script signs and
pictorials denoted bills of lading of bronze age tools and weapons...], the
following quote:

"The general hypothesis that past climate changes strongly affected lingu
istic patterns can also merge into more traditional explanations; sudden
climate change could have been the primary cause of migrations of IE-speaking
neolithic farmers or horse-riding warriors. If one accepts the paleolinguistic
view that such 'technology' words as 'wheel' and 'copper' were initially
present at the point of divergence of Indo-European languages, and that they
actually applied to technology items such as a fully-formed wheel or worked
copper, then the 8,200 y.a. or the 5,900 y.a. climate events (rather than the
Younger Dryas) could have been more important, respectively influencing
migrations of farming groups or of horse-riding warriors."  [For further
arguments and an extensive glacial bibliography cf: Jonathan Adams and Marcel
Otte, Did Indo-European Languages spread before farming?:
