This is of course rather interesting. Campantar seems
to show up as a pious bigot. Is he perhaps making a
snide attack on Dharmasena (Appar) for having been a
Jaina? It is probably not easy for him to forget this
fact considering his vitriolic hatred for the Jainas.
After all he seems to be calling them all kinds of
names:
"scoundrels" (3.297.1),
"filthy" (3.297.2),
"blind fools", "apes" (your quote),
"rogues" (3.297.11, 3.305.1),
"evil" (3.305.4),
"destructive" (3.305.10),
"wicked" (3.3.05.11),
"indecent" (3.366.1),
"base" (3.366.3),
"emaciated" (3.366.11)

Siva)
