Dear Motilal Banarsidass,
It is strictly forbidden for anyone to use the INDOLOGY list to promote
commercial interests.  This applies particularly to advertisement.
If your postings promoting commercial services recur, I shall be obliged
to cancel your subscription.
If you wish to contact me privately and request a URL link on the INDOLOGY
website, I should be glad to consider your request.
This way, people who want your information can seek it out easily, and the
600+ members of the list do not need to suffer a direct e-mailshot.
Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
