The purpose of the Conference will be to research into the evils of
dowry, atrocities on women, bride-burning and son-preference in India
and people of Indian origin abroad, recommend plans & programs to
eradicate these inhuman practices, and present a "Work-Plan" to the
Government of India for implementation of the said plans & programs.
Articles and research papers are solicited from scholars, professionals,
social workers and other interested people by
*June 30, 2000*, which should be mailed to:

ISADABBI will have the copyright on these articles/research papers which
may be published in a "Souvenir of the Fifth International Conference on
Dowry, Bride-Burning and Son-Preference", or in the proposed
"Work-Plan", and/or in other publications of ISADABBI on any later date.
Articles and research papers may be on any topic related to the purpose
of the Conference stated above. It may be noted that, since we are
trying to develop a practical plan and program to eradicate the evil
practices of dowry, atrocities on women, bride-burning & son-preference
in India and people of Indian origin abroad, articles and papers with a
stronger scope of implementation will have preference in the
"Work-Plan".
As for a general agenda of the Conference, the first two days (January
27 & 28, 2001) will be utilized for presentation of papers and
discussions. On the third day (January 29), resolutions will be adopted
and a "Work-Plan", generated by earlier discussions, will be submitted
to the Prime Minister or his representative. The last day of the
Conference, January 30, will be devoted to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi,
Subhas Chandra Bose and other martyrs who dedicated everything for
India's independence. The agenda may slightly be modified to accommodate
unforeseen situations.
