karma
Dear Indology Members:
Does anyone know where the first reference to the idea of not accumulating
karma at all comes within the early scriptural texts of Buddhism and
Hinduism. I am looking for passages in Sanskrit and/or Pali in which it is
explicitly stated that one's goal is not accumulate karma at all, versus the
accumulation of good karma.
Thank you,
