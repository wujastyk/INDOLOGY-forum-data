This seems a very reasonable explanation though looking through all
the Tib/Skt indices and dictionaries I have, "sngon-po" is
overwhelmingly the word of choice for "niila", occasionally for "hari"
and very rarely for "`syaama" for which another word is normally used;
and as I previously mentioned, I have only found "sngon-po" for the
skin-colour of Indians in native works not translations.   I can only
surmise that it must have entered into use in this way from some
translated text which had "sngon-po" for "`syaama".
While we are talking about "black/white", I can mention that the
Tibetan word for India is "rgya-gar" (white expanse) and "rgya-nag"
(black expanse) for China -- apparently because of the predominant
soil colour in Tibetan eyes.
Colour terminology can be quite surprising -- I have a Japanese book
which gives a huge range of terms with colour samples which shows that
a number of colours given conventinoal translations in English are
actually quite different to what we would call them ourselves -- the
word for purple being one example.   I wonder if anything has been
produced like this for other languages.
Best wishes,
