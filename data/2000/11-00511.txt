In Tamil, the word 'pon' is used for Gold and also just 'metal'.
Sem pon > sembu = Red metal = copper
veL pon > veNbu = veLLi = white metal = Silver
irum pon > irumbu = black metal = iron
there are also many words starting with k and gradually getting softened
over the years and turn into h and eventually lose the initial sound.
One interesting example is as follows:
kuru - red
kuruthi - blood (the red one)
kuruthayam - organ handling blood
kuruthayam> huruthayam. Moving to Sanskrit it becomes hruthayam>hrithayam.
It comes back to Tamil as Iruthayam. It further turns into Ithayam.
Now the original meaning (very scientific too!) of the organ handling blood
is completely lost in the modern context. I have not seen this explanation
anywhere. If there are any, I would like to know.
In a similar context, we can look for the similarity of krishNa and iru.
We start with the root 'kal' meaning dark/black. Numerous words have sprung
from this root.Let us restrict ourselves to the present case.
kal> karu > kari
