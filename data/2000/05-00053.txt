Subject: Impact of mantra recital on health
Message-ID: <161227058326.23782.10835479997357603434.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is there any research (completed/ongoing) on the impact of
mantra recital on health -- more specifically the mental
health, i.e. the psychological/psychiatric problems ?
Any references (web-sites/print/contact persons) will be
helpful.

Thanks in advance,
Surya P. Mittal
