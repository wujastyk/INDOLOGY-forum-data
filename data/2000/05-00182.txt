Dear Ven. Tantra,

This was new to me; so in return:

Skilling, Peter, "The Advent of Theravaada Buddhism to Mainland
South-east Asia," Journal of the International Association of
Buddhist Studies , 20, 1, 1997, 93-107.

Skilling, Peter, "New Paali Inscriptions from South-east Asia,"
Journal of the Pali Text Society , XXIII, 1997, 123-158.

Information about Buddhist schools could have important implications
for the study of the Buddhist schools in India; so this is not really
off-list.

>According to her thesis, every tablet contains an idea
>of the particular sect it represents.

One has to have doubts here. It is extremely difficult to identify =

specific schools on the basis of archaeological data unless there are =

actually named inscriptions.

>Mahaasa=96ghika)  schools were especially active along

In fact Indian inscriptions which were originally taken as =

identifying the Caityaka school (cetiyava.mdaka or similar) are now =

considered simply to refer to worshippers of cetiyas i.e. stuupas. So =

one would want fairly solid evidence for the presence of a Caityaka =

school.

This may be correct, but sculptures of Avalokite"svara are found  in =

many locations e.g. Ceylon. So that and the use of Sanskrit may =

sometimes simply evidence the presence of other forms of Theravaada =

from there. All this data requires a lot of care in its use.
