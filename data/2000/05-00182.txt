Early Thai Religion
Dear Ven. Tantra,
This was new to me; so in return:
Skilling, Peter, "The Advent of Theravaada Buddhism to Mainland
South-east Asia," Journal of the International Association of
Buddhist Studies , 20, 1, 1997, 93-107.
Skilling, Peter, "New Paali Inscriptions from South-east Asia,"
Journal of the Pali Text Society , XXIII, 1997, 123-158.
Information about Buddhist schools could have important implications
for the study of the Buddhist schools in India; so this is not really
off-list.
One has to have doubts here. It is extremely difficult to identify =
specific schools on the basis of archaeological data unless there are =
actually named inscriptions.
In fact Indian inscriptions which were originally taken as =
identifying the Caityaka school (cetiyava.mdaka or similar) are now =
considered simply to refer to worshippers of cetiyas i.e. stuupas. So =
one would want fairly solid evidence for the presence of a Caityaka =
school.
This may be correct, but sculptures of Avalokite"svara are found  in =
many locations e.g. Ceylon. So that and the use of Sanskrit may =
sometimes simply evidence the presence of other forms of Theravaada =
from there. All this data requires a lot of care in its use.
