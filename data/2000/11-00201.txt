Subject: Analogies,valid and invalid (was Re: Scenario of language              replacement)

Dear listmembers,

I do not understand a word of what is being discussed here. Does somebody
assert that the Aryan invasion/migration into India is so unique that no
parallels exist elsewhere? History IS migration, invasion and
acculturation, and all known peoples on this earth have been invaders. But
I agree that we should avoid using words like "chauvinist". Let us describe
our views clearly and succinctly and refrain from using emotionally loaded
words as well as abstruse philosophical terms.

Best wishes,
Bjarte Kaldhol
