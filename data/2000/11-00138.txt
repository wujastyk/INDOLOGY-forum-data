Pseudo-Sanskrit text of Our-Father?
Pseudo-Sanskrit text of Our-Father?
Dear Indologists,
                              The language is (missionary) Malayalam. It is
a kind of Manipravalam of Sanskrit and Malayalam words with a predominant
Malayalam grammar. Hope this will answer your question about the language.
It is certainly not Tamil.
With regards.
