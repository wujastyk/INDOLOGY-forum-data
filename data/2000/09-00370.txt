All Jai Singh's instruments have names, and none is called Jantar-Mantar.
Jantar-Mantar in this context means 'observatory'.
Whether Jai Singh used 'Jantar-Mantar' to refer to any of his observatories will
depend on the original documents.
There is a lot of information in the book:
M F Soonawala, 'Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II of Jaiapur and his observatories',
Jaipur Astronomical Society, Jaipur, n.d. [Foreword & Preface dated 1952].
Stated to be "Available from Vani Mandir, Sawai Man Singh Highway, Jaipur".
This book mentions that Jai Sing consulted with European astronomers, who came
to him by request.
