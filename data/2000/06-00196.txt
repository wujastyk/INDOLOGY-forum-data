Hello Michael,

I have always found tempting, though not utterly persuasive, the following
etymology first proposed by Johansson and re-affirmed by Thieme:

ve'di  <  *(a)va-zd-i  [from ava-sad-].

As Thieme suggests [Kl Schr. 1984, p.691] there is clear association between
vedi and the root sad- [cf. vediSa'd, used to refer to Agni].  ava-sad-
occurs only once in RV, but refers there [9.96.13] to Soma, which would be
appropriately placed on the vedi.

I would think that this etymology strengthens the link between ve'di and
veda', 'grass bundle.'

I would be curious to know: what do you and others on the list think of this
proposal?

Best wishes,

George Thompson
