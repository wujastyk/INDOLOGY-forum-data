 It is not just Tamil-speaking peoples, most Indian peoples are
 different shades of brown and black, and more so when we look at
 the so called low castes and untouchables.

Earlier words about Indology's future:
<<
 3. I acted like the messenger who came to Versailles to inform Marie
Antoinette
 while she was regaling that trouble was brewing in the heart of Paris. I am
 aware that I have inadvertently distracted you from your main focus, for which
 I apologize. For this offense, one member of this group politely asked me to
 leave. I will honor his request. - V.V.Raman, November 16, 2000

 What happened then?
