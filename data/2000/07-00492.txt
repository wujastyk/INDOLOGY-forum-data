It sounds as though Ludo may have elements of both CaupaR and Pachisi. It's
played on a square board, but the Plus-Sign-shaped track of CaupaR is still
there.  The squares that this leaves in the corners are used as bases for
the players.  There are four players, with four counters each, as in
Pachisi. Players have to race their counters round the track to get to
their own "home" square (in the middle of the board).  They can also slow
down other players by taking their counters, forcing them back to their
base to start again.  Moves are determined by the throw of a dice.  (You
have to throw a six to start a counter off.)  There are other refinements,
but this (from memory) is roughly how it works.  The OED has the word
"Ludo", but the date it's first recorded is illegible in my copy
(18-splodge-8), and there's no other information.

pebbles that were earlier used in such games. For example, in the game of
"bAgh-bakri". The player whose pawns reach the twenty fifth house first wins.
