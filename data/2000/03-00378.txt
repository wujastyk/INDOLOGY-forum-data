Bhartrhari
Mr. Lynken Ghose seems to have asked the following question at a very
inopportune time.
The editors of the multi-volume Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies have
included a separate volume on the "Philosophy of the Grammarians". Rightly
so.
Generally, vyAkaraNa is called a zAstra, and not a darzana. However, it is
not clear that Bhartrhari's deference to the Veda is any less than that
shown by other traditional darzanas like sAMkhya and yoga.
