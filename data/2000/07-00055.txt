SV: Harappan 'non-texts'?

Strictly speaking, I don't belong in this discussion, since I have no
expertise in any of the questions debated. However, I would like to make a
remark in the margin: Bernard Sergent suggests the possibility that more
than one language was used in the IV culture. Part of the area (in the
South) may have spoken an early form of Dravidian, whereas other parts
possibly spoke a precursor of Burshashki (according to Sergent) or some
other language(s) X. If this is correct, the Harappan signs may have had
something in common with the ubiquitous signs we see all over Europe: signs
for men's rooms and ladies' rooms, traffic signs etc. As generic signs for
concepts they may have enabled or facilitated trade within the IV area,
which shared the same material culture without being monolingual. The sheer
size of the IV area would seem to support a suggestion of plurilingualism.
At the same time, it is not surprising to find some local variants in the
semiotic system. That situation also obtains today.
