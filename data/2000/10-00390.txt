If I remember right, this is not a complete translation of the whole text,
rather some sort of commentary that covers parts of it.

As the title says, this one deals only with the karaka chapter.

Since the translation of Srisa Chandra Vasu is only one that is complete
you do not have a big choice. I suspect, however, that the work of
Bishnupada Bhattacharya improves that of Vasu, at least for this chapter.

You may look also for the short versions of the Siddhantakaumudi by
Varadaraja: 1. Laghu-, 2. Madhya-, and Sarasiddhantakaumudi. The first one
(the Laghukaumudi) was translated into English by J. R. Ballantyne in the
mid-19th century (still available in reprint). The last one (the
Sarakaumudi) was edited and translated by G. V. Devasthali.
