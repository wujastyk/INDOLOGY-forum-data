etymology of mani
Dear Dr. Kaldhol,
possibility of reflection in Near Eastern records of the Indic *mani* is
very interesting. But could not you tell us is the word maninnu "used in the
Akkadian El Amarna letter 25 to describe different necklaces inlaid with
lapis lazuli" Akkadian or Hurrian (as you say in your last posting). Or is
it Akkadian borrowing from the Hurrian (with Hurrian -nnu)? And what is the
dating of this letter?
Best regards,
