Dear VS,


Thank you for numerous interesting thoughts and bits of
information, which inspire one to read Hacker and Kulke again,
along with things you have mentioned. But for the moment I would
like to send these few sentences in return:


Am 16 May 2000, um 00:45 schrieb Vidyasankar Sundaresan:


[Basava, Allama, sunyasimhasana]

</color>I do not think that his being referred to as "devaru" necessarily
means that he was no longer among the living. Allama /
Allamaprabhu was also referred to as "Prabhudevaru" very early, if I
remember correctly.


[Madhva]


<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> And let's not forget that Madhva from Udipi, who broke away from

</color>That is clear, and nobody in the Maadhva tradition will deny it. A
good deal of the narrative of the Madhvavijaya is precisely about
this; but I don't believe that in the older Maadhva records (like the
Madhvavijaya; unfortunately I do not have a copy at hand right now)
  there is mention of a _matha_ at Sringeri, although Sringeri was
not far from Madhva's home ground. [Is Shrisha Rao reading this?
Do you know, SR?] Since the role of Sankarites in the
Madhvavijaya is so prominent, we could consider it highly
meaningful for the dating of the Sringeri matha whether a matha is
mentioned there or not.


<color><param>0000,0000,0000</param>[legitimation]


<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> For example, take Kulke's view of the legitimation of

</color>We also need to look at what that "legitimation" signifies. Is it a
legitimation of Vijayanagara as just another big empire, or as a
bulwark of pre-Mughal traditions and values that also wants to push
back the influence of Delhi? I think only the second possibility
would favour the Sankarite imagery. The other prominent religious
traditions, like the Maadhva and Virasaiva (also politically influential
in Vijayanagara) would at the time have been less useful in
appealing to northern India, where, on the other hand, the Sankarite
 tradition had  already spread.


[Padmavati / Sarada]


<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> It seems to me that it would have been easier to Brahminize the

</color>It makes more sense when viewed from the Jaina angle. On the
one hand, yes, Padmavati is a goddess of prosperity, like Lakshmi;
but she is also associated with learning. There is such a thing as
a  Sahasranama of Padmavati, and one of her epithets actually is
"Sarasvati". She is also known as a ;saasanadevataa or "divinity of
 the doctrine", a protectress of higher learning. Seen in this light, a
 switch from Padmavati to Sarada is less puzzling.


[Buddha / Gommatesvara]


<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> Why is substitution of Gommatesvara for Buddha as part of the

> Dasavataras a sign of opposition? Because of the ninth  avatara

> being described as one that purposely misleads people?


</color>And because, if the ninth 'slot' is actually meant for the Buddha,
there must have been a special reason for putting Gommatesvara
there.


[alliances]


<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> Again it is not clear what sort of strategic alliances with other

</color>To give a possible latter-day parallel: the USSR and USA were
allies until the end of World War II, when other concerns became
more prominent. The idea of the "four mathas founded by Sankara"
might have been part of an attempt at creating a geopolitical
solidarity which failed or was too weak or shortlived to be politically
effective at the time but was maintained in religious circles.


<color><param>0000,0000,0000</param>[Chandramoulisvara]


<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> As for a Chandramoulisvara linga at Sringeri, the above is not

</color>Some Virasaivas see the gifting of the Chandramoulisvara as a kind
of lingadiksa, which would make Renukacharya the diksaguru (and
 thereby a superior, in a sense) of his Sringeri contemporary who
accepted it. Personally I think this is an exaggerated view. But the
 episode is interesting as an illustration of what seem to have been
 more relaxed times of friendly relations between different
traditions.


[matha / hermitage]


I get the impression that at least part of this discussion hinges on
the question when something is / becomes a "matha". As
Sudalaimuthu Palaniappan also asked: must lineages have
mathas? To give two other parallels from Karnataka: Madhva gave
eight pupils the responsibility of continuing the worship of Krishna
at Udupi, and these pupils had their own pupils, and this was the
beginning of lineages; but mathas? These appear to have been
formed a bit later. Or: the Jaina presence at Shravanabelagola is
ancient, tradition placing its beginning in the 3rd cent. BC, but it
seems that it was only in the 10th century that a matha was
established with support from the Ganga dynasty.


Similarly, the rulers of Vijayanagara could have lent their support
towards establishing a Sankarite matha at Sringeri, on the basis of
