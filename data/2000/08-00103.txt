evidence of absence
Sure, but it is not evidence for presence either.
If common salt is not mentioned in the Rg Veda, then the
correct position would be to be neutral about it and
not speculate about its existance or non-existance.
Likewise if the dog didn't bark, it is best to be silent
about it rather than speculate whether the dog existed
or not, the reasons why it didn't bark, whether it had
lost its voice or its interest in barking etc
Ofcourse you can wonder, but why try to make facts out
of your speculation?
