Hinduism: once was: RAJARAM EPISODE
Am 6 Oct 2000, um 3:49 schrieb Ven. Tantra:
Do you mean 'jaati' when you use the word 'caste'? The same word
is used (at least in Kannada) also for Muslims and - get ready! -
foreigners. And the foreign caste has sub-castes: American,
Italian, etc. I.e., the mere use of the words 'jaati' and 'caste' does
not mean much.
