Dr.Witzels logic just doesnt seem right. Here's why:

>Note that the Avest. text already has to give an explanatory note!

If the explanatory note has to mention that it is a water animal, that
means that some (mistakenly) consider it to be NOT a water animal.  As you
yourself mentioned the mongoose is not a water animal.
So the possibility of mongoose > beaver remains.

This could be the Punjab as well.

I suggest that you rethink your logic and try to come up with a better
answer.
