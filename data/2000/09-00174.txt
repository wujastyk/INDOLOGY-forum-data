itare.saam - what does it mean?
Thanks everyone for the suggestion
itare.saam = pl.gen. of pronomial declension of itara (which, by the way,
is sometimes is declined as an adjective -- W.D.Whitney)
Let me put it differently:
What might be the objections the following:
itare.saam as pl.gen. of itare.s = itara-i.s = search for the other,
or, search with the other?
Did such use ever happen in Sanskrit MSS?
TIA, Dmitri.
