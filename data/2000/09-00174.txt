Subject: itare.saam - what does it mean?
Message-ID: <161227061618.23782.2704925591113388263.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks everyone for the suggestion

itare.saam = pl.gen. of pronomial declension of itara (which, by the way,
is sometimes is declined as an adjective -- W.D.Whitney)

Let me put it differently:

What might be the objections the following:

itare.saam as pl.gen. of itare.s = itara-i.s = search for the other,
or, search with the other?

Did such use ever happen in Sanskrit MSS?

TIA, Dmitri.
