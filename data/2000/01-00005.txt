Millennium
I know it is off-topic and all but allow me just a short remark:
The new millenium begins on 1.1.2001, not 1.1.2000. There was not a "Year
Zero", the year 1 B.C. was followed by the year 1 A.D.
So, happy new year 2000, the last year of the 20th century and the 2nd
millenium to all worthy scholars! ;-)
