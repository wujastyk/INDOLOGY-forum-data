I am studying a 9th century inscription which contains a cosmologically-
based list of incarnations terminating with 'a reflection of abhayada'. The
reference refers, in one sense, to a transcendent tathagata Buddha figure
of Amitabha. However, is the same epithet 'abhayada' also used in a Sivaite
context?

If so, then where might I find a textual reference to its usage?
