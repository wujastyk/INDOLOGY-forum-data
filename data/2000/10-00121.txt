I think, it is long shot to claim that the arrival of ShankarAchArya or
Ramanuja catalyzed the re-conversion back to Hinduism.

It is more due to NayanmAr (especially Sambanthar, Appar and
Manickavasagar) and AlwAr (especially three muthal Alwars).
This re-conversion was at the end of KaLappirar rule and the start of
Pallava rule. History is more clear on that.

Again, it is an un-supported accusation. Can you please define "linguistic
chauvnism"?

You said "let go of it and Brahmins themselves will fight for your cause".

If you are a Tamilian, who stopped you from fighting for that cause? Why
are you mixing politics and scholarly debate?
