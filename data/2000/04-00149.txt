Thanks, Michael.
A small point:
- there is a small problem with the table: the second column
 ought to begin with 097
- there was a post from Thomas Burke <84.3d1b029.26272537 at aol.com>
Why do you believe about these?
- did I guess correctly about the kampa (to be encoded resp.
 \u0966\u0953\u0952 and \u0968\u0953\u0952) ?
- more generally: some (many?) of these accents differ mainly by the
 context more than by the meaning: so it may appear that we diverge
 from the conventional "Unicode codepoints=character alias meaning"
 toward a more glyph-based approach (which approached seemed to be
 the one used by ISCII-91, BTW)
Best regards,
