towards a list for professional Sanskritists and              archeologists &               anthropologists of South Asia
Jan Houben's is an intriguing proposition; but it may cause problems 
for some of us who have come into Sanskrit studies from other fields 
(my dissertation was on ancient Greek dialects) and whose 
publications on Sanskrit and other South Asian languages do not 
normally appear in the journals that he indicates. I personally am 
perfectly ready to accept that non-experts may have something 
valuable to contribute (there is, after all, an advantage both to the 
insider's and the outsider's perspective), or at least that their 
contributions may present valuable challenges to established views. 
What worries me more than paper qualifications is the "tone" of many 
of the submissions--and on that count I find that some established 
"experts" and "outsiders" may be equally on the side of the 
angels/devas or the devil/asuras.  That's my ?1.
Best wishes,
Hans Henrich Hock
