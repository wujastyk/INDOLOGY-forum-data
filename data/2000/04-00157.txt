Snake and Mongoose
Dr. Witzel said:
"Since IE *bhebhru 'beaver' (see earlier message) is attested in a large
number of  IE  languages, is found in Central Asia even today,"........
But, beavers occur *even now* in Central Asia, as a look in Grzimek's
encyclopedia will show."
VA comments: The validity of the above depends on how one defines 'Central
Asia'. Grzimek's encyclopedia DOES NOT indicate (in present times or in the
past) the presence of Beavers in the Central Asian republics (except perhaps
the very northern fringes of Kazakhstan), Afghanistan, Iran, Sinkiang.
However, Beavers are indeed found in Mongolia, Siberia and northern shores
of Caspian Sea.
I looked up other encyclopedias on 'Zoogeography' and on Mammals and all of
them have the same story to tell--that the Beavers were/are found in Europe
from the borders of Spain to Sweden and all across Russia and Mongolia to
Amur River. Nor have any fossils been found in our region of interest,
except very far up north in Siberia, Mongolia...
Apparently then, the Avestan Beavers' skins must have been been imports.
