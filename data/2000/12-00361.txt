Dear Bob,  I am thinking of applying for the Doshi Chair in Early Indian
History at UCLA.
Could I put your name down as a referee, please.
Do you know anything about the position?
Things here are as hectic as ever.  I am redrafting the GP trasnlation for
the third time and tryinfinish off other bits and pieces.  In addition, all
my daughters are living with me nw.  That's OK but causes a bit of
rearrangement.
Are you going to the Montreal Conference in May.  I am.
Cheers to you and Sally,
Greg
