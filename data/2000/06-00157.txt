Dates of non-meteoric iron in India
See discussion by:
Chakrabarti, Dilip K. Iron in early Indian literature, Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society 1979, 22-30  <<when I read that  long ago, I thought that
his interpretation of Vedic texts was partly wrong, but do not remember
details>>
iron in India.  JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE ORIENT
20:  166-84.
For the Vedic sources, see esp., the late W. Rau, under translation into
Engl. now:
Rau, W.,  Zur vedischen Altertumskunde, Akad. d. Wiss. Mainz, Abh. d.
Geist. u. Soz.wiss. Kl. 1983 No.1, Wiesbaden 1983
<general summary of his ved/arch. work, also on iron>
Rau, W., Metalle und Metallgera"te im vedischen Indien,  Akad. d. Wiss.
Mainz: Abh. d. Geist. u. Soz.wiss. Kl. 1973, No.8, Wiesbaden 1974, pp.
649-682
In general, the RV has only (non-gold/silver) "metal" (ayas) ; but from the
Atharvaeda onwards, we have zyaama ayas/ kRSNa ayas 'the black metal"=
iron, and therefore now also: lohita ayas 'the red  metal for
copper/bronze;   ...  see already Vedic Index.
Arch.s now believe that iron entered India from the hills of the Vindhyas,
not from Iran.
