Subject: Toward a Science of Translating--Sanskrit texts--the basis              for the meaning of meaning

On Haridas C's appeal for material relevant to the problem(s) of
translating from Sanskrit into English:

1. The introduction by Daniel H.H. Ingalls to the abbreviated version of
his translation of Vidyaakara's _Subhaa.sitaratnako"sa_, Harvard
University Press, 1965.

2. A Ph.D. thesis done by Hank Heifetz at Berkeley in the mid eighties on
this very problem. I don't know the title.

And there are more things that don't immediately come to mind.

Both the above works deal, however, specifically with translating kaavya.
Translating other types of texts into English is another problem(s).
