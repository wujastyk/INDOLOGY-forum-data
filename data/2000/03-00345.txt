There are few "Dravidian" speaking tribals who exhibit typical "Negroid"
physical characteristics;
1. Kurumba of Tamil Nadu
2. Paniyan of Kerala among others
Further Dravidian is a language group not a racial group contrary to what a lot
of people want to believe. Speakers range from Caucasian Brahui to Negroid
Paniyan and every possible human combination in-between including the much
contested Australoid and even some Mongoloid characteristics of tribals in the
east.

Dravidian Place names in Maharashtra
F. C. Southworth (University of Pennsylvania)  In their book The Rise of
Civilization in India and Pakistan (1982),  the Allchins state that there is a
substratum of Dravidian place names in Maharashtra. This statement, based
probably on the ideas of H. D.
Sankalia.....

Pretty interesting that without the help of modern linguistics, old Puranic
writers ?some how? knew that the natives of Gujarat and Maharashtra were
Dravidian speaking although currently a majority of them speak in IE
