aryan
Terms have the meaning given to them. After the misuse of the term Aryan, there is a strong emphasis on using "correct" expressions, emphasising language rather than race. Aryan is a subset of the broader Indo-European speakers.The Aryans are the Rgvedic and Avestan peoples, because these books use the term, Rv more generally than the Av.The term Indo-European ( probably coined as a counterweight to Indo-Germanic ) is as old as 1813,although it  was long before it bacame fashionable. Incidentally the scientific term energy was coined by the person who coined Indo-European:Thomas Young
