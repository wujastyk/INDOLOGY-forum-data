So sorry, fuzzy math!

If Japan had the population of India, it should have/would need 8 times as
many top institutions, thus c. 40  ....

But, not with just 120 million people: for whom would they produce all
these engineers/technocrats? For export?

India has five schools and should have, in comparison to Japan's
population, c. 40 !

QED

China (minus HK, Taiwan) with just 5 is roughly comparable.

Simple absolute numbers don't do it. Otherwise, what about relatively small
countries/units,
Singapur and Hongkong, having one each??  Or, Thailand, etc. etc. etc.
