Whines in India (was Re: "Science" in India)
So sorry, fuzzy math!
If Japan had the population of India, it should have/would need 8 times as
many top institutions, thus c. 40  ....
But, not with just 120 million people: for whom would they produce all
these engineers/technocrats? For export?
India has five schools and should have, in comparison to Japan's
population, c. 40 !
QED
China (minus HK, Taiwan) with just 5 is roughly comparable.
Simple absolute numbers don't do it. Otherwise, what about relatively small
countries/units,
Singapur and Hongkong, having one each??  Or, Thailand, etc. etc. etc.
