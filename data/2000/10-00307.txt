"Science" in India
One should note that while OIT advocates may be spouting nonsense, there is
plenty of Indian AIT advocates who are guilty of the same --
they make extrapolations not justified by the evidence. Simply because they
are advocates of the "correct theory" does not make their scholarship any
less shoddy. Poor education in the humanities makes people fall for that
nonsense too.
One should also note that while OIT might have a "fascist" political agenda
in India, where fascism here is defined as a form of nationalism that
excludes some of the people resident in that country, there are plenty of
Indian AITers with a fascist agenda as well.  The construction of modern day
politics as a continuation of an Aryan-Dravidian struggle should offend
people as much as the "historical Hindu-Muslim dispute".
One could also make a strong case that the civil war in Sri Lanka in which
people are actually being killed is in part the contention between two
fascist views of history of the Tamils and Sinhalese.
One hopes that the scholars here would endeavor to educate the Indian public
in these matters, as in the Frontline article.
