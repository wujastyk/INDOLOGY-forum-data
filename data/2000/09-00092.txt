For those of you who read Italian:
You can compare with *Aforismi dello Yoga (YogasUtra) by Patanjali*,
transl. by Paolo Magnone -- Torino: Promolibri, 1991 -- Pp. 183, ITL
24,000.
It has been translated into Italian with the commentary RajamArtaNDa of
the king Bhoja (11st cent.), which accompanies each verse.
(There are two other translations into English of Bhoja's commentary,
both of the last century and somehow incomplete: by J. R. Ballantyne and
G. Z. Deva in 1852-1868, and by R. Mitra in 1883).
You can read the English presentation of the book in
