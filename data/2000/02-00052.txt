Q: Manu on Pouring Lead in Sudra Ears
Dear members,
I'm not sure about receiving all the messages regardind the issue "Re: Q:
Manu on Pouring Lead in Sudra Ears", because I cannot trace the beginning
of the discussion (even from the Indology archive-list), which has been
interesting until now. Particularly, I do not know if an initial list of
"standard" quotes from scriptures related to the problem has been the
starting point of the debate. So, if this is the case, any of the
contributors of the issue can send me a resume of the starting point
passages from texts?
