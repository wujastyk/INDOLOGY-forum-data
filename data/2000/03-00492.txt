Being a Tamilian myself, I am highly intrigued by the parallels that keep
cropping up between Sankara's hagiography and Tamil Saiva legends. However,
I would like to err on the side of caution, as I think mythic themes have a
way of rapidly travelling far.

Take the case of Sankara's debate with Mandana Misra. The former is a monk,
the latter is a householder. Sankara enters Mandana's home during an annual
Sraaddha ritual, and they banter about for a while before entering into a
serious philosophical debate.

It all sounds highly Hindu/Brahminical, with a vivid description of the
tension between ascetic and householder. Recently, I found from Robert
Thurman's "The Central Philosophy of Tibet" that a very similar report is
found in 16th c. Tibetan texts, about a debate between Aryadeva and
mAtRceTa. Here too, an ascetic visits a householder's home during an annual
Sraaddha ritual, and engage in similar banter before getting into a debate.
