iamjoking
This reminds me of the following joke known in Pune among the
Sanskritists.  When the teacher asks the pupil to translate "piino
devadatta.h divaa na bhunkte", the Marathi translation from the student
comes out:  "The yellow Devadatta does not blow out the lamp (Marathi:
pivaLaa devadatta divaa phunkat naahii)" When he is told that this is not
correct, his revised translation comes out as: "The yellow Devadatta does
not bark during the day" (Marathi: pivaLaa devadatta divasaa bhunkat
naahii)".
