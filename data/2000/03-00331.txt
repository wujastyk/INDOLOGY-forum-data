Saraswati: Atomic Scientists reconfirm location
Agreed.  Then you should have no objection to renaming this forum "Science
of the Rgveda".  Why call it 'Indology'?  As a recent subscriber, attracted
by the name 'Indology', I find it misleading.  It is similar to saying that
Egyptology is the 'scientific study of Egyptian hieroglyphics'.
