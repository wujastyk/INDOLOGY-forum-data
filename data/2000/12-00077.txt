A patron is interested in whether and how Zoroastrianism and Buddhism
influenced each other, and why Buddhism did not spread much into Iran
south of Merv.  I have not been able to find anything explicitly on
this and just supplied him with some of the histories of
Zoroastrianism and of religion in Iran, and also suggested he
investigate works on Mani, since he was influenced by both and any
good work on him would have to discuss his sources and the
socioreligious context he worked in.  Does anyone have other
suggestions? Is there some well known work on this already in
existence?

Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
