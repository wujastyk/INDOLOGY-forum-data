[q] Possehl book
Prof. Witzel
I remember reading in a review that Greg Possehl's 1996 book,
(Indus Age: The writing system) that Asko Parpola's 1994 book
was not included because Possehl finished the mss. before
Parpola's work was printed. Does Possehl's book include the
analysis on Parpola's book?
