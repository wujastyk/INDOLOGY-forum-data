I don't think so. It is within the range of dates (+/-) for C14 at
that date. So the tree ring data and the C14 evidence essentially
coincide.

We may differ, but I am reluctant to accept that this is in the end a
plausible viewpoint.

There is a long history of this. It goes back to the writings of
Velikovsky. I repeat that I don't think this has a significant
following among specialists.
