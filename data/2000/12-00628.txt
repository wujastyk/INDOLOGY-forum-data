Skt. examples formed by loss of Pkt. or other i-/e-
Dear Sanskritists,Linguists, and the List,
Are there any examples of Sanskrit words formed from
Prakrit or from other languages, where word-initial i- or e-
in the supposed root word goes to zero?
For example, yakkha/yakSa and tamil iyakkan/esakkan.
The medieval commentary of Nammalvar's TiruvAymozi ITu
among others uses "ecaGkumpaTi" here "iyaGkutal"/"esaGku-tal"
= 'to move'. Incidentally, Sri Krishna is "moving" to Brindavan
in that verse of Nammalvar. Also, RV 'iisa/isa' means 'to move'.
issara/ii'svara and yakSa look related. Also, liGgam
seem to be related with tamil "e_lu-tal" = 'to stand firm'.
Any known examples where word-initial e-/i- is lost
while forming Sanskrit words? Either on-list or in a private
mail to this address, I solicit your examples.
Thanks for help.
Happy New Millennium to all at INDOLOGY,
N. Ganesan
