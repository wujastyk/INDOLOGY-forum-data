Black as Evil
I give up. Isn't yours an out-of-India/Iran theory of racism?
And isn't such racism an "Aryan" construct in your book? To
that extent, it is an "Indigenous Aryan" theory. Only the time
period is different. The "chauvinists" may claim that aeroplanes
and nuclear bombs were exported from an Aryan India. You want
to say that racism was exported from an Aryan India/Iran. Don't
tell me there is no parallel here!
