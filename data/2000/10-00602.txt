Mahabharata Conference 2001
Dear Dr. Tilak,
I just sent you a private message.  Apologies.  It went to the Indology
list as a whole.
"Herewith a copy:
Dear Dr. Tilak,
I would like to attend the conference on the Mahabharata you announced some
time ago.
If it is not too late, I would like to offer a paper fitting into the
second of your categories.  I have not yet formulated a full paper but a
tentative title would be:
The Mahabharata's Simultaneous Affirmation and Critique of the Universal
Validity of Dharma.
I apologize for responding to you so late.
Would please be able to confirm whether my paper is acceptable to you.
Yours Sincerely,
Dr. Greg Baile"
Take it is a reflection of my incompatability with computers.
Cheers,
Greg Bailey
