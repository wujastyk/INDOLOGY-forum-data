Vedic Concordance downloadable (and RV)
                        M. Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
is now available in electronic form.
We at IAVS thank Marco Franceschini  and Alex Passi for their foresight,
hard work, and for their generosity in making this important work
accessible to all scholars.
Please note that the Concordance is *copyrighted in Italy and the USA.*
It is available only for *private use* of scholars and the interested
public (see below).
Infringements of the joint copyright of  M. Franceschini/Harvard Oriental
Series will be pursued by legal means.
I stress this as such has happened with the van Nooten/Holland Rgveda (HOS
50, 1994) which has been indiscriminately copied, changed, and rebroadcast,
and in the process, successively degraded.  By now, there is a veritable
stemma of mistakes.
Only the copies in TITUS (U. Frankfurt), J.R. Gardner's Vedavid, Tokyo
(Tokyo U.), and Harvard U./HOS (via my website, below) are legal and
correct ones. (TITUS actually has a slightly improved version which will be
used for the planned reprint; the book is out of print now).

J.R. Gardner's version helps those who use Mac, and the Tokyo version
enables all users of the Japanese OS to access and use these files which is
difficult otherwise (as explained in the web site).  Most are linked via
Dominik's e-text page: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indnet-textarchive.html
(Dominik, could you please linke the Concordance as well?)
I copy, below,  M. Franceschini's/A.Passi's original announcement of the
Concordance made to IAVS a few days ago.

Dear Members of IAVS,
we are very glad to inform you that a complete electronic version of
Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance is now freely available and downloadable at
the following sites. This version is under US and Italian copyright and
meant for the private use of scholars only.
Italian site:
http://digilander.iol.it/marcofrance
American site (presently under reconstruction):
http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~sanskrit/pubs.html
(for the moment, also directly at):
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/VedicConcordance/ReadmeEng.html
The files contained in these sites constitute the result of a research
project undertaken by Marco Franceschini, under the supervision of Prof.
Alessandro Passi, at the University of Bologna. They  were scanned and
processed from the edition in the Harvard Oriental Series, Vol. 10:
"A Vedic Concordance, being an alphabetic index to every line of every
stanza of the published Vedic literature and to the liturgical formulas
thereof, that is, an index [in Roman letters] to the Vedic mantras,
together with an account of their variations in the different Vedic books,
by Professor MAURICE BLOOMFIELD, Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative
Philology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. -- Cambridge (Mass.) 1906.
Pages, 1102. Royal  4?."
Typographical mistakes in the original edition have been corrected.
The files are provided for both the Macintosh and PC/Windows platforms:
each version comes with its own font, respectively Macind and Winind (of
course, users must load the new font  unto their machines before running
the files). Besides the font, the Archives contain three files:
Introduction, Abbreviations, and  Concordance.
Due to the large size of the main file, containing the working part of the
text ("Concordance", about 5.6 Mbytes unstuffed in the Mac version), it is
advisable to allot a considerable amount of memory to the application used:
Nisus (Mac platform) works very smoothly with about 40 Mbytes of RAM. If
you do not have Nisus you can also use other word processors (which are
slower, though).
More detailed instructions are contained in the downloadable files.
For any question or problem, please write to Marco Franceschini at
bloom at alma.unibo.it
Comments and suggestions are welcome and will be appreciated.
