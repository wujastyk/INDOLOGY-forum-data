Ferenc Ruzsa answered:
Ferenc lists candidates from Mahadevan's Concordance, and adds:
I do have this List, many already checked out by M. Witzel or me.
I'll doublecheck the data using all the sources I now have at
hand. As of now, despite Mahadevan's Concordance, no violations
of the "same animal/same inscription" rule have turned up that I
know about. Marshall 252/378 doesn't exactly qualify, as you've
suggested. I'll keep looking.
I'll see if I can find more too, as soon as I have time.
