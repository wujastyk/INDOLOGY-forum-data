Again, SANSKRIT broadcasts + M.Muller
  It was very cool to listen to the Sanskrit program from dwelle.de
  I have a question - I hear the reader as saying sharmaNya deshIyasya
  prakaNda panditasya Max Mueller mahabhagasya ??
  Is - sharmaNya deshiyasya - a common usage in Germany ?
  Thanks in advance.
  Subrahmanya
