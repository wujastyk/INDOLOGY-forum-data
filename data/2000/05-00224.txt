Madhava, Vidyaranya, Sringeri, and Kulke
 Hacker and others' 700 dating derives from the suggestion by
 Kuppuswamy Sastri in the early 20th century that Sankaracharya
 predated Mandana seeing few sentences that have similar ideas.
 But this textual evdence may be wanting. Both could quote from
 an earlier author. However, inscriptions from Chola, Pandya, Hoysala
 periods dating to 11, 12, 13th centuries have been found related to
 Adi Sankaracharya. These inscriptions need to be taken into account,
 and parallels from dating of say Basava, Tamil alvars, nayanars
 or Sankara mathas like Kanchi or Sringeri suggest a much later
 date than the one by Hacker.
 Please consider a parallel with the advent of Writing in India (except for
 the "Sindhu-Sarasvati" letters taken as Sanskrit by S. R. Rao, ...).
 Prof. V. Agarwal was pointing to writing in the atharvaveda passages.
 Still no writing predating Ashoka has been found archaeologically
 (Falk, and others).
