Basque and Tamil related?
Andr? Signoret <sanskrit at CLUB-INTERNET.FR> writes:
"The first European missionary active among the Tamils was
perhaps a Navarre Spaniard, Francis Xavier (7.4.1506-3.12.1552)
who landed at Goa on May 6, 1542 and performed intensive
missionary work in the name of the Societatis Jesu in
Tamilnadu. He lived there for several months (particularly
in Tuticorin), and in his letters he compares his mother
tongue *Basque*, with "their mother-tongue ... Malabar"
(=Tamil). Oddly enough, centuries later, N. Lahovary
a Rumanian-French scholar, produced a sweeping but
bizarre hypothesis connecting Basque with Dravidian
(1963)."
