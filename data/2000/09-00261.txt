Electronic Vedic Concordance
Hello Everyone,
        I have been trying to use the electronic version of the Vedic
Concordance on my Macintosh Powerbook 1400c without success.  Each time
Nisus tries to read the main Concordance file, I get the message "not
enough memory".  My machine has 64 MB ram.  Does anyone know how much
memory one needs to be able to read the Concordance files?  Best,
                                                Madhav Deshpande
