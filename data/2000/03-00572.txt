Indological projects [was: P.V.Kane's HDS in abridged form]
Mikael Aktor and Axel Michaels have both identified good indexes to Kane
as being a desideratum.  I agree.  A few months back, I raised the topic
of completing Raghavan's NCC.  Several people agreed that this was also a
worthwhile indological project.
What are we to do about these things?  There are several important
"enabling" tools of this type that our field would greatly benefit
from.  They are hardly the sorts of job on which a PhD should be
spent.  But in what way can they be made to happen?   Should the IASS have
a bursary to sponsor such project work?  Would we all be prepared to pay
into such a fund?  Is that the right way to proceed?  Or perhaps an
independent Indological Charity Fund should be established to sponsor
these and similar tasks.  Payment could be made to pre- or post- doctoral
students who could use some funds.
Perhaps I'm dreaming.
