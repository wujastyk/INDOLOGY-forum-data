In January 2001 it will be one hundred years since Sven Hedin (1865 -
1952) excavated the first bamboo manuscripts from a Wei/Jin dynasty tomb
and stimulated a new era of research into ancient Chinese manuscripts. To
celebrate this centenary four eminent scholars from the history
departments at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Academy of
Research into Chinese Medicine will spend three months in London examining
the Dunhuang Manuscripts related to medicine. Their visit will culminate
in an international conference on early Chinese Medicine at the Centre for
the History and Culture of Medicine, SOAS on September, 10th September
2000.
