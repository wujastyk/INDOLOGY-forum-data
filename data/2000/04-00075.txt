Bhatt/Info on Hemachandra/Tamil-Prakrit
here we go again.... where does all the following come from?
Yashwant Malaiya <malaiya at CS.COLOSTATE.EDU> 4/9/2000:
???
Is Skt. hRdaya = Maharastri  hiaa??  And maybe I write Pidgin here?
Nogat, mi i-tokim na i-raitim Inglis (tok bilong bikpela soldia bilong balus).
Plis, stopim kranki toksave!
The "northern" language is known, even in the Vedic texts, as especially good.
Nope.  They used Gandhari, a Prakrit much further 'down the road' towards
New Indo-Aryan than Pali.
???
No. Gandhari Prakrit was used first in inscriptions! See G. Fussman's long
paper  in C. Caillat, Dialectes dans les litteratures indiennes, Paris 1989
Sanskrit was only used *later on*. And then survived the even transition to
Islam in Kashmir in the 14th century by c. 100 years, when finally king
Zain ul Abidin, son of a Hindu mother and in general very friendly towards
the Kashmiri Hindus,  made Persian the official language at c. 1420 CE.
Nope. the Kalasha (in Pakistan) not yet, but the Afghani Kafirs, after the
Muslim conquest out of Kabul,  a hundred years ago...
they still are, in Chitral,  and their temples & figures & rituals survive,
in Pakistani Chitral...
That is overdone... Kafiri (Nuristani) is not Sanskrit, just has some
conservative forms (such as gram for 'village'),  and:
since Nuristani is the third subfamily, next to Iranian and Indo-Aryan,
of Indo-Iranian, it differs from both and has preserved e.g. a sound (.c.
in du.c. '10') that is lost as early as in Vedic Skt. (daza) and Old
Iranian (dasa)...
Nope, that's the Afghani Kafirs. Not the Kalasha  in Chitral.
