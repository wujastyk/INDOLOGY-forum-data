I seriously doubt that Patrick Olivelle *gave* you this impression.  It would
seem to me rather that you just took it.  Patrick Olivelle knows that 500 BCE
is too late for the latest strata of the RV.  If you would like to create
disagreements between me and Patrick Olivelle and Micahel Witzel, it will be
necessary to document them.  For as far as I know, there aren't any when it
comes to the dating of the Vedic period.

Your working assumption is the same as Goody's.  Heuristic or not, it has no
basis  I think that you should either provide it with one, or abandon it.

My response was not a slip, nor was it an expression of emotion.  ManusmRti
is irrelevant because it is post-Vedic.  And by the way its date is 2nd or
3rd cent. CE.

No, my position hasn't shifted at all. You are utterly confused about your
dates.

Let's be clear. Vedic is Vedic and Brahminical is Brahminical.  They are not
the same thing.  What you find impossible to accept on the one hand, and in
harmony with the views of one Vishal Agarwal on the other, has nothing to do
with the matter.  You are confused.

What are you talking about?  I have made no 'pretty large admission'
whatsoever.  The Vedic period was preliterate.  It preserved itself.  Even
after the arrival of literacy in the Indian subcontinent it continued to
preserve itself.  Why is this hard to understand?

Nope.  Manu is much later than this, and Manu 12.103 does not establish that
the RV was preserved by literate processses.

Comparison of Vedic with other traditions may well be fruitful in the long
run.  But it won't be until you get basic facts of Vedic right.
