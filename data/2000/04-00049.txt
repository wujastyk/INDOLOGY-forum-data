Student Assistance at Indus Valley Sites
Dear Members,
I have several undergraduate students of varying abilities and some with
archaeological experience who have expressed serious interest in working on
an Indus Valley site, either in India or Pakistan.  Does anyone know of site
directors who will accept applications from undergraduates, particularly
those who have some fieldwork experience?
Thanks!
Dan White
