I wrote a very similar letter to National Geographic (NG) 17 (?) years ago
because they ran a cover story on Australian Aborigines with the standard
theory,that the AA migrated from South East Asia. I wrote with all my
juvenile enthusiasm that they should say that 'AA migrated via South East
Asia not from South East Asia' and even sent some photographs of people
that I knew could pass for AA from India and Sri Lanka. I received a very
polite letter from NG saying that the standard theory is based on
archeology and other scientific evidence not on physical features of
people. Needless to say I was disappointed:-(

But when I visited Sydney, Australia a few years ago, I met a Aboriginal
Didgeridoo player in a busy spot called Circular Quay. He was playing the
wind instrument for petty cash from visitors and tourists. It was a sad
site to see.  But compounding that he called me aside and said that he is
a ?real Aborigine not an Indian or Sri Lankan pretending to be one? as many
people have 'accused' him in the past. So it is not only ?us? who make this
connection but also ?them?. Further when I visited an Aboriginal settlement
in Arnhem Land (in North the AA looks closer to Papuans than Indians), I
was called as a long lost brother from far away land by the local
aboriginals. There is definitely layers of human migrations in Australia
and who ever populated India has left their traces in Australia too.
Overall it was a very emotional trip.
