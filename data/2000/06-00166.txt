Subject: h after t and d in S. Indian transliterations
Message-ID: <161227059272.23782.9362429471670948424.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Devanagari script has four sounds; t  dot,th dot: t,th.If you wish to write
Indian words without using diacritics, you must do with only two Roman
combinations: t and th.Hindi does away with distiction between  t and t
dot.,e,g, t serves different purposes in tota (parrot) and chattan
(rock).Similarly th and th dot are seved by th...South indian languages ,on
the other hand, distinguish between t and t dot by using t and th
respectively. They do not need sybols for th as in thali, and so on.
