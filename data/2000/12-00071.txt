Sanscrit?

 Most European citizens speak with "Sanskrit" roots and are unaware of that.
 "Monsieur Jourdain aussi faisait de la prose sans le savoir !".
 Almost every time you pronounce , say, French or German, or Russian words,
 you utter sanscritic phonemes. But alas one thing is missing : le "sens
 critique" (sorry for the pun !).
As Dr. Fosse explained, nowadays Europeans are not "Aryans", and that
19th century usage is replaced with Indo-European (In Germany,
Indo-German) (in scholarly writing, atleast). Along the same lines,
Signoret means Indo-European wherever he puts Sanscrit, is it not?
The French generally do not use Indo-German. I understand that
tripartite scheme of Sanscrut and European languages is done
most in France. Is it the grounding in Classics (Greek/Latin)
leading to these claims as Hinduism, Yoga, etc., are IE?
