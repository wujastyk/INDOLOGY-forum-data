Buddha and Hitler
There was a PBS program. I think the British narrator Michael Wood (1948-),
producer of Legacy produced this. On Arians and Nazi Germany.
There was a mention about a top Indologist speaking before Hitler,
Himmler and other elite leaders of 1930-40s Germany proclaiming that
Hitler's book and the teachings of the Buddha are very similar
or same...
Who was that famous Indologist?
Thanks,
