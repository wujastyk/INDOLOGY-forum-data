"In the 1970s, Don and Jean Johnson worked with Charlotte Wiser on a filld
strip/slide show on the village Karimpur, of Behind Mud Walls fame. That
slide show is now available as a web site (with a 1990s addition
forthcoming) at
http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/southasiacenter/karimpur/
A new edition of Behind Mud Walls will be out later this spring from
California , with a chapter on the village in 1998."
