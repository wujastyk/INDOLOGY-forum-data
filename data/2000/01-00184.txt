...that is why the text of the Constitution of Indian prescribes in its
paragraph 343 (1) not only Hindi as the "official language of the Union", but
also: "The form of numerals to be used for the official purposis of the Union
shall be the international form of Indian numerals." I.e., Arabic numerals.

PS to "vital statistics": Which means, the globalization of Arabic numerals does
not demonstrate the semitization of world culture.
