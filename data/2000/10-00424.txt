"Science" in India
It is surprising that in all the discussions about Harappa no mention is
made of the work of the archaeologist Shereen Ratnagar, and the target is
invariably Prof. Thapar, who does not even specialise in the period.
Professor Ratnagar's work is possibly too scientific for those who only want
to find leftist sounding rhetoric. See her Social Organisation of the
Harappan System, Ravish Publications, Pune, (I am not sure this is the exact
title) and End of the Great Harappan Tradition, Manohar, Delhi.
