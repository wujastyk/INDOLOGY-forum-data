The nonsense of supposed IE superiority in horse handling,

Your quotes about vedic "tanks"  have already been given
on the IndianCivilization list. No, you havent said
anything about panzers. A panzer is a very specific

I will repost your vedic tank gems on this list as well,later
when I have more time.
