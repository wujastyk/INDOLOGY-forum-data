There was some interest in mechanics in the Hellenistic and Roman
period, true, and some manuals of it are preserved, partly in Greek,
partly, thanks to the Oriental Princes (?), in Arabic. However, the
Greek engineers were not capable of constructing robots and flying
machines, this was only part of their exaggerated fame in Indian
literature.  The late Finnish scholar Bjarne Hulden wrote in the 1980s
and 1990s two books about Greek and Roman science and engineering;
unfortunately they are in Swedish, but Lars at least is capable of
reading them.
