 Scholars can come from anywhere; To study ethnic Gonds, it is not
 necessary to be born with Gondi, a Dravidian language/dialect as
 mother tongue. It is normal to get good observations when foreigners
 write about the details or viewpoints which may be missing in native
 narratives. A particular case is Indian history which will be lot poorer
 without Greek, Chinese or Arab visitors.

 The problem is many ethnics incl. Gonds are pre-literate. No literature
 of their own or historical documents from their own hands exist.

 As Historians say, history begins with writing. Many ethnic groups' dead
people
 have left us with no writings at all.
