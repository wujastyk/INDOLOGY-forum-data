Agreed that Vishnu-Purushottama is depicted as dark colored in Indian
art, but the word that is translated as yellow is pingala, and not
purusha. The modern Swami's translation is on rather strong grounds.
Also, Urdhvaretas is a name more easily applied to Siva, the Yogi,
than to Vishnu/Krishna, and we know that virUpAksha definitely was
Siva, in temple-building times. There are many things going on in
this verse, not the least of which is the usage of the dative case
(vizvarUpAya) after a list of accusative cases, surely a very old
feature. The tatittirIya AraNyaka cannot be dated much later than the
zatapatha brAhmaNa of the Sukla YV.
