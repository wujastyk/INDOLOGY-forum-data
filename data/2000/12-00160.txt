The construction of mechanical wonders (thaumatourgia in Greek, I believe)
goes all the way back to antiquity. Oriental princes were very
enthousiastic about such devices whereas they were practically unknown in
the West during the Middle Ages. The phenomenon is described in art
history, I recently saw a monograph on the subject (unfortunately, I don't
remember the title of the book, but I can find out).
