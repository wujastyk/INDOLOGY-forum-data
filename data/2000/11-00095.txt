Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
Thanks,  Bjarte: very good, now we make some real progress (for which this
list is intended, after all) :
We relied on outdated data: Friedrich 1940, also reported by Hock 1999:3 :
Mitanni shinta/shitta. So, this opinion, 60 years old, may be a red herring?
I assume that the variant shitta is not typical, or no longer maintained by
specialists?
If so, we must agree:
Even then, it would be the only "Prakritic" form. B.Oguibenine is right, of
course, in assuming  an early origin for some such words, but the few that
have survived discussion so far now are under constant attack; recently I
have seen a paper (where?) that even explained away RV jyotis (for *dyotis).
That is not excatly correct: we have, just looking at Mayrhofer Etym Dict.
II 569 sqq,
names such as Artataama = Rtadhaaman, (Biridas'uva = *priitaas'va,
Priyaas'va = *priyaas'va), Tuis'eratta/Tus'ratta = TvesSaratha RV,
Indaruta/indaruda = Indrota RV, S'ativaaja ~ vaaja-saati, S'ubandu =
Subandhu RV, --by no means a complete list. Such princely names are found
all over Syria and down to Jerusalem, if I remember correctly, down to 1000
or 900 BC.
Fine. There are many possible scenarios and you have now explained a very
probable one.
The case seems similar to that of the Dravidians, who also have separate
words for the horse but later on took over "Panjab" vocabulary for parts of
the chariot..
Thanks for the ref.!
But isn't it just the case that the *male* line has IA names, while their
wives, then > mothers, consistently have Hurrite names? This looks more
like 'throne names' (or fashion), for whatever reason.
Certainly. But see below:
quoting from memory, from his:  Die Indo-Arier im vorderen Orient.
Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz 1966, and: Die Arier im vorderen Orient - ein
Mythos? Wien 1974.
Which discussed the sceptical approach of Annemarie Kammenhuber. He is
against "Aryan" domination and assumed influence, one way or the other,
(several) hundred year(s) before 1380 BCE.--- All from memory. Cannot check
at home.
Again, good to know. All of this becomes important for the RV (below)
which, in my mind at least, seems to go down in age now.
These facts combined, don't they just point to IA influence on the higher
level (marriage as you say?) AND the low level (horse trainers, foreign
mercenaries?)
I always wondered why Mitra, Varuna, Indra and Nasatya (=Ashvin) were
listed as no. 104-108 in the Hittite agreement!  Like an afterthought: "to
be sure, lets include them as well!"
However, Thieme, The 'Aryan' Gods of the Mitanni Treaties. JAOS 80, 1960,
301-17 , has shown that they are OIA, and are listed in this order.
Varuna is typical for oath and truth (Read RV 7.86-88)
The question of ai and au is up for grabs. Theoretically older than RV, but
we may even discuss this point, as there is some indication that Rgvedic
people still said: daiva for deva, etc. (Long story).
But there are other cases that I actually wanted to ask for from Subrahmanya.
Since I now have to give them below, he should point out to all of us in
INDOLOGY why these words cannot be pre-OIA/pre-Rgvedic:
The important ones include cases such as vaz'anna [vaz'hana] which in the
RV already is > vaahana (cf. Diakonoff 1971: 80 sq)., or  mazda for
[mazdha] which in RV > medha, in Priyamazdha (Bi-ir-ia-ma-as'-da), =
Priyamedha, frequent RV name, cf. Mayrhofer EWA II 358.
Exactly. As I have written (in press), such data now tend to drag down the
RV a quite bit. The counter-argument, however, could be that the reflexes
in Mitanni could be due to some archaic dialect that survived in NW Iran...
No way to tell. Even then, the preclusion of much earlier influences, as
you detail above, now makes this option much less probable.
In short: if Mitanni has, by 1400 BC, mazda, vaz'hana, then the RV medha,
vaahana is *late*/later. Note that Possehl now wants to bring down the date
of iron as well. If this goes down from c.1200 to, say, 1000 BCE, so goes
the RV. It has no iron, yet.
As always, new evidence (and thanks for that!) opens new avenues. In case,
very old ones; the good old Max M?ller with his 1200 BCE date gets
repudiated.
Agreed. But there are a few that can be discussed.  The old S'uriyas' and
Bhaga (Bugas')> Do you have arguments against them?
More interestingly Abiratta = Abhiratha, a perosmnal name. Maybe S'ukaniya.
horse names : Akriyas' (agriya?), and finally there are a few suspious
names ending in IA -as' etc. (nominatives).
Others certainly have to be scuttled (see the very sceptical Balkan, 1954):
such as S'u/imaliya = Himalayaa (fem.!!)
What do you think about these?
And Subrahmanya, thank you kindly for your indulgence: an old canard is
something like a red herring, but maybe more delectable. Unfortunately,
this particular dead horse now is 60 years old (Friedrich 1940) and may no
longer pass as food for thought. What is your linguitsic  input about the
pre-OIA forms listed above?
