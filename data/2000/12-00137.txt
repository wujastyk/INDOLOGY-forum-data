Musical trees and rivers?
interpret a
(vaadya). The
phrase
take this to
nadi(i),
Despite all the helpful musical suggestions, I think people are
barking up the wrong tree (excuse the pun).   I am almsot 100% certain
that your text is alluding to the three types of sound I mentioned
previously.  I suggest you look under "`sabda" at the first chapter of
the Yogaacaaara-bhuumi, where Asa`nga explicates them in greater
detail using the same and other stock examples.  You should read the
phrase as :
    vanaspati-nadii-`sabda.h
    uccha.taa-taala-`sabda.h
    murajaadi-vaadya-zabda.h.
Hope this finally clarifies the matter for you.
Best wishes,
