[q] Madhva
On Madhva, his biographer Narayana, and his followers and critics see also
Madhva und seine unbekannten literarischen Quellen: einige beobachtungen by
Roque Mesquita, Wien 1997 (of which I wrote a brief review which is to
appear in one of the coming issues of Asiatische Studien/Etudes Asiatiques).
The author of this study told me that an English version is in preparation.
