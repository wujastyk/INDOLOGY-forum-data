yogadIpikA
D. G. White (The Alchemical Body, p. 140) writes:
"Another vernacular work attributed to Gorakh, entitled the YogadIpikA, is
written in the Old Kannada language. I have not consulted this work; however,
a description of it leads me to believe that it is a south Indian version of
the HaThayoga PradIpikA of SvAtmArAma, ..."
Could anybody confirm / refute this assumption?
Are there any other renderings/translations of the HYP into other Dravidian
languages?
Thanks
