I have joined the list much more than a month ago. I don't remember to have
written against christian missionaries working in India, in this list or
anywhere. About western scholarship, I have not written "against" it, but
be aware of it's prejudices and  priorities.
Scholarship not knowing national boundaries is both true and false. Each
country's scholarship is determined by it's intellectual traditions and no
scholarship escapes the cultural, political and other prejudices of the
moment. Even within the same national boundary , the  priorities and
prejudices change, or can change, drastically over a few decades
