Yes. Vaishnav author Nabhadas in his Bhakta-Mal (1585) writes:

[His "ramaini" "shabda" "sakhi" (sections of his "Bijak") are
accepted by Hindus and Turks alike. He spoke without discrimination
for the good of all]
Kabir was very influencial. Several panths in India, specially
Sikhism, were inspired by him.
Kabir represents openness of the Hindu society. Religious
criticism has traditionally been accepted in India. Sarahapa,
Ram Simh, Kabir, the Sikh Gurus, Swami Dayananda etc have
criticized existing practices and beliefs.
He was one of the Bhakti pioneers, along with the Vaishnavas.
While Kabir was brought up as a Muslim, and he stressed that
Hindus and Muslim are same, his philosophy basically belongs
to the Hindu and not the Muslim tradition.
Kabir was dead when Akbar was born. He may have been influenced
indirectly. Akbar appears to have been accepting of multiple
traditions, while Kabir questioned all traditions.
Songs of Kabir
by Kabir, Rabindranath Tagore (Translator)
ISBN: 0877286957
is out of print currently. Other translations are available.
It should be available in libraries.
He did have Muslim followers, but his movement was basically
a Hindu one (using the original definition of the term).
I haven't seen Muslims discussing him. Some consider him a
sufi.
His time is about 1398-1518, he is said to have lived more
than a 100 years. There is some disagreement about the dates.
He is one of the most quoted Hindi authors, perhaps right after
Tulsidas.
