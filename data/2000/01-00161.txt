This question may be too technical for all but the hard-core Vedic
scholars.  While looking at the Padapaa.tha for RV 4.16.6 and AV 20.77.6
which are identical with each other, I find that the last word vavru.h is
repeated:  vavrur iti vavru.h.  Such repetitions for the line-final words
are common in the Kramapaa.tha, but not in the Padapaa.tha.  Can anyone
think of why such a repetition might have come about in the Padapaa.tha.
Best,
