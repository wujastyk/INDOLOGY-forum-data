I don't have a clear-cut definition at hand, but I could suggest one:

"A classical language is a language with an ancient literature of
outstanding quality that through a considerable period of time has played
an important part in the history, literature and culture of several peoples
that otherwise may use different mother tongues."

This definition would include languages such as Greek, Latin, Arabic,
Persian, and Sanskrit as well as Classical Chinese. It would exclude Tamil,
Old Norse, Old German, Anglo-Saxon English etc. in spite of the fact that
these languages have old and venerable literatures. Classical languages are
normally used across time and space by educated people and serve as link
languages and carriers of ideas with some claim to universality: e.g. Greek
and Latin for Christianity, Arabic for Islam, Sanskrit for Hinduism etc.

I offer myself up for criticism.

Best regards,
