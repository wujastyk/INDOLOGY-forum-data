[buffalo sacrifice]
Professor D N Jha's question and the answer following it show that baffalo
sacrifice is not so common in India.  However, in Nepal baffalo sacrifice
is very common, particularly during the annual Durga Puja. Hundreds of
baffaloes are sacrificed in the temples of Goddess Durga all over the
country.  Buffaloes are also included in the 'panchavali', or 'five
sacrifices' which are given to Durga, (Bhagavati, Maheshvari), and also to
Lord Bhairav.
