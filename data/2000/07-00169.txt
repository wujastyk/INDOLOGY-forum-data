Rules of Membership
Dr. Witzels posting on July 8th was 22k.
Jha's posting of a PDF attachment on June 27 was 35k.
Also, Dr. Witzels and Dr. Farmers posting's were not polite
by any standard.
I hope that the same standards apply to all people or
are the Europeanist school members more equal ?.
Regards.
