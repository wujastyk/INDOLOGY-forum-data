"Science" in India
 Indians have done it in USA and Silicon Valley, and Germany
 should not be different, I hope.
 The humanities training in tech/science colleges is very poor;
 Also, the library facilities. A (historical) linguistics course
 and one on comparative Indian literature, with good portions
 from Sanskrit and Tamil classics, something like a Norton anthology
 will be of sure help.
 People like Rajaram portray Zvelebil as a Christian missionary!
 If we conduct surveys from people on the streets, the results
 for Dravidian languages may be that they are coming from Sanskrit.
 Since a majority of HindutvavAdis claim that drav. studies is a
 Christian effort, should the Indological discipline abandon its Dravidian
 linguistics studies??
