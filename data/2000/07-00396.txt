Indus Valley Civilization, geometrical knowledge
G.F.Dales in his article "Sex and Stone at Mohenjo-Daro (Frontiers of
the Indus Civilization. Ed. by B.B.Lal and S.P.Gupta. Sir Mortimer
Wheeler Commemoration Volume. New Delhi, 1984, pp. 109-115)
reconsidered traditional interpretation of some specific stone
artefacts as symbols of lingam and yoni. In Dales's opinion there
are no grounds for this "erotic symbolism" interpretation. Instead he referred
to the hypothesis by M.Jansen who had suggested that the stone
rings might have been used in measuring angles and making astronomical
calculations.
        Unfortunately, I have not the book with me anymore and can not check
if there are any direct references to M.Jansen's works.
        Hope it may be of use.
        All the best
