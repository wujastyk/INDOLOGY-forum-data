In all haste, I am rather bogged down right now: To be on the safe side, I
would like to say that I did not make the remark above.
Not my comment either.
Given the runaway demography, a literacy rate of 63% or even 40-50 % is
actually quite an achievement in my opinion. More people know how to read
and write in India today than there were people in all of South Asia at
Partition. Since the population increase is so dramatic, any reference to
the British becomes rather nonsensical. Other things being equal, I believe
that India would have done much better for herself if she had managed to
stabilize her population at, say, 300-350 millions. Yet, India's
politicians have a lot to answer for, although their job has been and
remains extremely difficult.
