If you can show that JnAnashrimitra wrote against theism and also
show that Udhayana was responding to him, your argument would be more
convincing.
As I said before, I find it strange that the top logician of the NyAya
school would write on a subject which was not critical at that point in
time.
Strange though it may seem to some, the index to Anantalal Thakur's 1996
edition of Udayana's nyaayavaartikataatparyaparizuddhi records five
references to nyaayakusumaaJjali within the text of
nyaayavaartikataatparyaparizuddhi. All five references refer the reader to
nyaayakusumaaJjali for its exposition of the matter then under discussion
(please note the last index page entry "588", should be corrected to "591").
In two of these references (pages 393 and 417), Udayana explicitly claims
that he has already treated or elaborated the matter in nyaayakusumaaJjali.
In my book, these amount to a claim of authorship.
