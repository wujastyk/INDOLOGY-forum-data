Indology in Russian
Yes, it was after her visit to Moscow and Leningrad (now St.-Petersburg
again) about 25 years ago. The title (or subtitle) was "The disregarded
scholars". She reviewed mostly the works of Indologists belonging to
Moscow-Tartu school of structural studies. Some of the people mentioned here
soon after that had to emigrate, but others left. Unfortunately, I can not
give the precise reference. An American magazine. The article never reached
the libraries of the USSR.
