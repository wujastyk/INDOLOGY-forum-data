A hypothetical question
Namaskar Sri Ghose,
I wonder if I should define the words, such as
pseudo-secular, that can be referred easily to
any dictionary?
However, I am sorry if my expressions are not so
clear. Let me know where you require further
explanations and I would do my best to explain.
In the present thread, a question was asked, ?What
would the list members say if a person who
does not know Sanskrit (say, in the weak sense of
reading a page in 15-20 minutes) is (hypothetically)
appointed as the vice-chancelor (comparable to provost
in sone US universities) of something named ``...
Sanskrit University''??
I thought that this question was not so hypothetical
because I have recently read in the news that K.N.
Pannikar, the well known communist historian, has been
appointed vice- chancellor of the Adi Shankara
Sanskrit University in Kaladi, Kerala by the communist
government of that state. They don?t care whether and
how this man, who knows no or very little Sanskrit and
is known to have no respect for anything Hindu would
serve a Sanskrit University named after Adi Shankara.
All they care is that their man, K. N. Pannikar,
severs their ideology and might change one more
academic institution into a communist bastion.
