[Re:] Violence, 'threats to culture', etc.
Yo Nazi man stop talking your bullshit let all participants 
decide what research needs to be done, I do not think we are 
ruled by Hitler to say who should be on the list  and who sould 
not be put forward your own research ideas and let the subscribers 
on the list decide what is relevent to a culture.
