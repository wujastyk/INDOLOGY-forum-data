Hydronomy  of Tamil rivers (Re: Again, SANSKRIT broadcasts)
 Like kAn2/kAn2al, maN/maNal, nolai/nolaiyal which are nouns
with -al endings formed from non-verbs mentioned, Tamil toponyms
with -al endings are:
kOval (a srivaishnava tiruppati), cikkal, cuziyal,
cEynjal, nAval, marukal, mAkaRal, paRiyal, jnAzal, ...
noyyal can be like one of these.
