What if there had been well made CD-ROM's in Vedic Times??????????

Many of the people on this list would have to undergo retraining as teachers
rather than debators/arguers!!

There would be no use at all for several thousands of the argumentative
posts made in recent years!

And think of all the lost shAkhAs we would know about!
