Info on Bhattas

Some information you can get in the old gazetteers, e.g. Nanjundaya/Iyer 1928:
314; Bhattacharya, Hindu Castes and Sects (p. 73 and 83). Bhatta was a caste
name as well as a title, not necessarily, but predominantly for brahmins.
It?s also a caste name for brahmins in Nepal, as well a term for the priests of
the Pashupatinatha temple (which are from South India).
Best wishes, A.M.
