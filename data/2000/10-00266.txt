and jump, and add the suffix -man => Garutman. From Garutman
to Garuda is a piece of cake. Everybody who was not Indo-Aryan
then became Dalit. To escape their oppression, the Dravidian
people went to Southeast Asia, and took the Indian Garuda
with them. Horus and Garuda are both connected to kingship.
So even today, Indonesia has Garuda Air, while Egypt Air has
Horus on its logo, and Air India has the Maharaja.

This is a groundbreaking discovery, and if you don't agree
with it, you don't know what you are missing. We can now try
to relate Harappan signs to Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like adding
namak and mirchi to taste, we can throw into this ancient
kichri, the Phoenicians, the Babylonians, the Canaanites, the
Hebrews, the Hittites, the Mittani, and the sundry adventurer
who took a wrong turn somewhere. Then, via Aramaic, we can
find some connection of Harappan signs to Kharoshti and Brahmi.
Extremely fascinating, no? :-))
