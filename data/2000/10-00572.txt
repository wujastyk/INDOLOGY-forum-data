In recognition of the remarkably learned, perceptive
and cordial exchange of S. Hodge and H. Isaacson,
might anything be said regarding the validity of the
term "vajravaada," its presumed reference to an erotic
ritual and its correlation to the linga? Moving into
the adjacent area, might anything be cited on the
linguistic origin of "linga," its original sense, and
the suggestion that linga is the symbol from which the
Buddhist "vajra" evolved?

Appended questions: (1) Is "linga" spelt with
overdot-'n'? (2) What is a good way to transliterate
the Sanskrit overdot-'n'?
