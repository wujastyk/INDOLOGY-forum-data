Basque and Tamil related?
Thank you for the link. It is very hilarious ! A very good example of
Trubetzkoy's "Hirngespinst" (chimera) !!!
However, I appreciate the leading position of Basque, probably the most
interesting language in the world, the David opposed to I-E. Goliath !
Agglutination and Super-declension versus Analysis ! Short, a jewel for
linguists. "Mais gardons la t?te froide".
We don't intend to make a new Scrabble !
Best wishes.
