Subject-prefix for INDOLOGY (fwd)
I've just discovered (thanks Richard) that this is all unnecessary!
The Listserv software can be configured on a person-by-person basis to add
this [INDOLOGY] header or not.  Just go to the website (via
www.indology.org.uk) and you will see that you can adjust all sorts of
useful settings for yourself.
Apologies for the red herring.
