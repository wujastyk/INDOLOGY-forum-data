ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

Dear Colleague,

We are pleased to announce Bridges: Berkeley Research Journal on South and
Southeast Asia (BRJSS), a faculty refereed journal.  This journal will be
interdisciplinary in scope, drawing from wide theoretical disciplines in
the social sciences, humanities, and the arts.  Scholars are encouraged to
submit their work on South or Southeast Asia.  Special consideration will
be given to scholarship focusing on comparative studies in South and
Southeast Asian cultures.  We expect scholars in the fields of
Anthropology, Economics, Folklore, Geography, History, Linguistics,
Political Science, Religious Studies, and Sociology to submit manuscripts
for publication.

Volume One will be released on September 01, 2001.  The deadline for
submissions for this introductory volume is January 31, 2001.  Late
submissions will NOT be considered for this volume.
