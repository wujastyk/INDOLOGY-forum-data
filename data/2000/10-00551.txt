I would appreciate if Vijayaraghavan could clarify the above statement. I
would like to know if he is saying:
1. That Hindu sectarian divisions did not exist in the Tamil society before
the advent of the British?
2. Or if they did, they could not have coined these terms to identify these
sects.
3. If his contention is that they could not have coined these terms, what are
the linguistic/sociological/religious reasons?
4. What were the Tamil terms that Tamils used to refer to these sects?
When he says, "As far as I can see...", is it based on any specific textual
evidence? I would appreciate if he could give the source texts for this
statement.
Thanks in advance.
