In principle, the introducers of Indo-European language into India,
introducers of horse & chariot into India and authors of the RV are
potentially distinct.  These people may be significantly separated in time,
may have ancestor/descendant relationships, or they may be different groups
of people.  These should not all be confused by using one term -- "Aryan"
-- until identity is demonstrated.
