The medieval Sanskrit term Turuska is a hangover from the days of Kushan
and Tokharian invasions. The Aryans confounded the later Muslim Turks

`Turuskas' (ie. Rajputs) actively participated in the army of the Islamic
Turkic sultanate, forming more than half of Aurangzeb's army. The army was
thus a `Turuska' army for the medieval writers.
