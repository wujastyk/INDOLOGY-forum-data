Studies of Vedic mnemonics
Many thanks to Steve Farmer for the interesting and informative post
I agree that there does not seem to be anything comparable in Vedic with the
'memory palace' devices that you describe.  I myself am unaware of anything
as elaborate as these in India.
But I am curious about such things as the Incan quipus which have been much
discussed in the literature on mnemonics.   Would you be willing to comment
on this device for us?  I have never been able to understand exactly how
these rope things work. Perhaps the list in general would find your
observations on this of interest.  I certainly would.
Best wishes,
George Thompson
