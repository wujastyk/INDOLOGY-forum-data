Yashwant, the theories of Runoko Rashidi, Bernard Sergeant, Clyde Ahmad
Winters and others are not acutally linked with the medieval arrival of
the Siddis.

They argue either for a Holocene or pre-Holocene migration from the
Sahara or East Africa as the main source of 'recent' African genetic and
cultural contribution to the Dravidian population.

Strangely, the ancient Greeks also noted that there were very hoary
connections between 'Ethiopia' and India.

One of the darkest people I've seen was a brahmin that I met in Delhi,
although I don't think he was originally from there. The lightest
brahmins I've seen were Kashmiri migrant/refugees living in Kathmandu.
