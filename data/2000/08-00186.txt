The notion that "Hindu" as a religious category is a colonial fabrication
does not stand up to scrutiny.  Let me quote from D. Lorenzen (1995:12) as
he discusses North Indian bhakti movements of the 15th and 16th centuries:
"...the poems of virtually all nirguNI saints beginning with Kabir and Guru
Nanak repeatedly refer to 'Hindus and Turks' and 'Hindus and Muslims
[musulaman]' in contexts that clearly show that the authors had in mind
religious, and not ethnogeographical, communities."
concept
Again, Lorenzen (p.20):
"It is easy to demonstrate that nirguNI religion, particularly in its early
stages, has embodied a fairly direct rejection of the ideology of
varNAzramadharma."
In this respect, the articles by Schaller and Juergensmeyer in Lorenzen's
volume are relevant.

The following is a good analysis that might be of interest (especially to
those who would apply Said's Orientalism to India):
