Vedic accent in taittiriya samhita
Is there a living tradition of Taitiiriya Yajurveda in
Maharashtra ?. Also, isnt there a marked difference in
the recitation of the rk samhita  and taittiiriya
samhita in south india for the svarita. rgvedis always
recite the svarita (for a syllables with the deergha
matra ) in the same way as a yajurvedis recite the
deergha svarita, right ?.  Also the svarita for
letters with non-deergha matra is  emphasized more
than in yajurvedic tradition. The treatment of
anusvara is also
different.
Thanks,
Nikhil
