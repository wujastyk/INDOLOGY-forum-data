vasudhaiva ku.tumbakam revisited

It seems that Houben is suggesting that the verse might be a relatively
late addition to the Subhaa.sitaratnako.sa. It should be remembered that
one of the reasons why the Subhaa.sitaratnako.sa is a very valuable source
is that the principal MS of it is an old one, which was photographed by
Saa"nk.rtyaayana in Tibet. The editors place it (admittedly on
palaeographical grounds alone) at around A.D. 1150. I don't have the book
to hand now though: the old MS is incomplete and therefore its evidence is
not available for all, though it is for the greater part, of the
collection. If Houben wishes (us) to believe that the Hitopade"sa
occurrence has a significant chance of being earlier than that in the SRK
(`just as well...') it would be of importance for him whether it is
available here.
As I mentioned in a previous post, the verse is also quoted in Bhoja's
"S.r"ngaaraprakaa"sa (where, as so often, no author or work from which it
has been taken is named). Houben's post does not refer to the question of
the dating of this work (nor indeed at all to this occurrence of the
verse). I believe that it is usually assigned, without controversy, to the
first half of the 11th century. Of course Houben may wish to argue that
that dating might be wrong (though almost certainly not by much; I seem to
remember that there are some testimonia and references to the work that
would preclude that) or that the verse might have been interpolated.
It seems really to be unlikely that the Hitopade"sa is the first text in
which the verse occurs. (Perhaps someone with more books and time
available than I have at present can tell us of other attestations earlier
than or roughly contemporary with the "S.r"ngaaraprakaa"sa; it would not
surprise me if there are some.) And I see no reason to think that whoever
composed it had any cynical intention.
