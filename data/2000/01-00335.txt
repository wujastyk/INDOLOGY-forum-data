Why not simply: "causing more (abhyadhika) pain than a scorpion ..."
Shouldn't we rather translate:
"#The bite (subject of the sentence!)# causes erection of the penis (read
"sephaso instead of "sophaso), the standing on end of the body hair, #and
the soaking of the limbs with cold water (= cold sweat)#"?
But if it 'bites with its mouth', one would either think of a mosquito or -
rather - of a spider. Are there tarantulas in India? A tarantula would be
somewhat similar to a scorpion and its bite is extremely painful.
If Su"sruta says that the ucciti"nga has the poison in its sting, he is
either wrong or he thinks of something else than Vagbhata, who says that
the animal bites with its mouth. Of course, Vagbhata too could be wrong.
