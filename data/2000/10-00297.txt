Thanks, Bijoy Misra, for your comments. The sudden flooding of Indian
engineers (or is it the sudde opening in the Western marketting needs ?) has
created a lot of ill feelings. In Germany there is a slogan running now :
Kinder, nicht Inder (More children please, not Indians). I guess these are
the initial reactions of fear. The substantial esteem will follow I hope.
Greetings. A. Nayak

        Dear Steve (Farmer),
        I don't know you personally.  But that you could interview
        one student in Stanford and then flood the net with opinion
        on the quality of scientists and engineers of Indian origin
        does not say much about your own scientific thinking.  Pardon
        me for saying this, but your absurd generalizations does sound
        extremely irresponsible and you must rethink your empiricism.

        I have been a teacher in the US for more than twenty years and
        have brushed through school systems with two children of my own.
        Person to person the training in mathematics and sciences in high
        schools in India would be superior to such training in public
        schools in the US.  It has not to do with the resources, but the
        quality of the teachers.  That the children do not rise up to
continue
        career of research comes from the deep economic handicap the family
        faces immediately.  It's changing though.  Do interview any of the
        new engineers who are flooding the US, who even do not come from
        the quality schools.  Do observe the respect they gain at the
        American workplace.  They do not have a research resume with them,
        but certainly carry a head of objective thinking to deal with
        rational logic of computing.  The keyword is "objective".

        Hope you would contemplate rather than getting angry.  To make
        sweeping generalizations from places of importance is not helpful
        to your colleagues.  Unfortunately it conotes an attitude that
        better be not displayed in public.  Hope you would rethink
        and engage in a more meaningful dialog.

        Best regards,

        Bijoy Misra
