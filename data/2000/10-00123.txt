Dear sir,

Thank you for raising an interesting point. But don?t
feel so squeamish! No ones pointing the finger at you.
Your sensitive post alludes to the European past when
?heresy? was used as a Dark Age tool of terror and
coercion. But you are also suggesting, at least
indirectly, that the term has no valid place in a
scientific community. My view is different. I would
further put forward that the ?scientific community? is
exactly the place where ?heresy? should be. Yes,
beneath the lens of a scrutinizing microscope. All the
same, I do concur that this needs to be viewed with a
little sensitivity. And if that were possible, one
would likely see that in contrast to a widely held
misconception, heretics have never been the enemy of
truth, nor the purveyor of fraud and imitation.
Heretics are highly unconventional beings who - in so
being precisely what they are - embolden later
generations to advance beyond every form of
ideological ghetto. One would also come to understand
that the ?concept? of heresy is the Idiot Child
begotten from the marriage of Dogma and Fanaticism.

Thanking you for you patience,

Ven Tantra
