It is quite a different thing, but may be of interest, too: You
know Ramacandra's Rasikaranjana? Every verse has a double meaning
(as well as a srngara and a vairagya sense). It was published and
translated in 1896 by Richard Schmidt.

Somaprabha's text was published in the Kavyamala series (the one
with Roman numbering, not to be confounded with the general
Kavyamala series). The title is:

        Somaprabhacaryaviracita Srngaravairagyatarangini
        Sukhabodhikaya vrttya sameta. In: Kavyamala : a collection
        of old and rare Sanskrit Kavyas ... / ed. by Pandit
        Durgaprasad and Kasinath Pandurang Parab. -- Part V. --
        Bombay : Nirnaya-Sagara Press, 1888, pp. 124-141

I have seen a reprint of the 14 parts (in Roman numbering)
published in Varanasi 1988, it may be still available.

Hope it helps,
