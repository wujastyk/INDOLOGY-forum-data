Kanchi Shankara Mutt
Dear sir,
One is still in the dark, with respect to what these publications are. Since
others cannot be expected to know the details of the books you have, the
commonly accepted practice is to give the following -
Author's name (or editor's name), title of the book, year of publication,
place of publication, publisher's name.
Page numbers may be given for specific quotations. If you are referring to a
journal that is published periodically, the year, publisher's name, page
numbers, title of the particular article you quote and its author - these
pieces of information are necessary.
That there was a Sankaracarya associated with Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham in the
19th century does not require much proof. Around the 1700's is the crucial
time period for which one needs information. As far as one can make out from
your mails, the Modi documents do not cover this.
Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
