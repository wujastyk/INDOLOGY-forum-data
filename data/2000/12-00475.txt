Your suggestion that there is some peculiarly "western" (as
opposed to "Indian"?) meaning of "truth" is a remnant of old
romantic ideas about the "wisdom of the East." I don't see a
great divide here.
Go back and read the Stoics or Epicureans or Daoists for many
parallels.
Followed by the kicker:
No comment needed.
