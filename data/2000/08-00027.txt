Rajaram's PILTDOWN horse
I hope that Dr.Rajaram admits his mistake.
Because it was a visual image and the claim was
very big, the falsity was (comparitively) easy to expose.
On the other hand -
What happens when a person indulges in mistranslations
of passages in order to prove ones point or theory ?
Is it any less objectionable ?
