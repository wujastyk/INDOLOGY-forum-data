Prof. Witzel's sarcasm is a refreshing break from the pathless meanderings
which have recently beset the mailing list.
On Druhyu, I have a question: Which Druhyu?
Druhyu I is a son of King Yaya_ti. Two sons, Yadu and Turvasu were born
to Yaya_ti, the son of Na_hus.a, by his wife Devaya_ni_ and three sons
Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pu_ru by his wife S'armis.t.ha_.
Druhyu II is a son of Matina_ra, a king of the Pu_ru dynasty (MBh. A_di
Parva. Ch. 94, Stanza 14).
Since Druhyu seems to be central to the process of emigrations which have
haunted indology for a long, long time, I would appreciate a further
discussion on this issue, with or without sarcasm, with or without early
references from vedic texts! If you run out of space in this list, you can
