An Interview with Prof David Shulman
Dear All,
The On-line edition of the Frontline magazine carries
an interview with the well-known western scholar of
South Indian studies, Prof Shulman. (Oops, is
Jerusalem west?)
He makes some interesting observations on Indian
historiography, linguistic attitudes etc
