Presumably, the answer must be yes.
It also seems that some aspects of Assyrian / Babylonian chronology
must also be revised as, perhaps surprisingly, elements of that
chronology are actually derived from the conventional Egyptian one.
It can also be shown that a similar problem to the Egyptian one, that
of parallel rulers, also occurs in the Assyrian king list -- Assyria
was at times a divided kingdom (north/south).  But the details are
complex so I suggest you refer to Rohl's book I mentioned previously
as he deals with the Assyrian/Babylonian question -- whether it
contradicts the revised Egyptian chronology.   Rohl's opinion is that
any problems are not insurmountable.
I cannot comment on the other points you raise as they are well
outside my range of expertise.
Best wishes,
