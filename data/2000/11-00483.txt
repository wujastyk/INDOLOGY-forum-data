Bhoja's Bhojpur temple (was ZRngAraprakAZa)
The unfinished (and still grand) temple at Bhojpur, is assumed to have been
under construction by king Bhoja who for some reason stopped further
construction. The "temporary" ramp to raise stones to the shikhara still
stands.
The draft sketches for parts of the temple can still be seen carved on the
nearby rock. Has anyone studied these sketches to speculate how the final
temple was intended to look like?
While Bhoja is one of the most famous kings of India for his patronage of
Sanskrit, he does not appear to have been very lucky.  What plan did he
have for the Bhojpur town by the great artificial lake he created?
