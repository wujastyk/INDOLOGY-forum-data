I believe this has to do with historical reasons. Traditionally, "Indology"
referred primarily to the study of India's *classical* languages as this term
was understood in the last century. In other words: Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali.
(There is in other words an element of habit here). In the US, I believe one
has tried to give the child a new name: South Asian studies. The problem with
this term, however, is that it covers too much, so that when we want to refer
to India's classical culture(s) and languages, we revert to the older term.  In
fact, Indology is not a good term, try to coin the term "Europology", and you
will immediately see what I mean, particularly if you restrict its meaning to
the study of classical antiquity. More differentiated and less clunky terms
would have been an advantage, but if we don't want to use "South Asian"
studies, Indology is what we've got.
I believe that I am now pushing my quota for this month, so this will be the
last email from me in March.
