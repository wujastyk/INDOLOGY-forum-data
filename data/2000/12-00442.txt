Questions on Indian idealism
I do not intend to disturb your flow. I am finding your postings extremely
educative in scope and content.
A physician may know that humans are made of flesh, bones etc, but still
loves a person of opposite sex. In this case the form is still associated
with the idea even after the object has been atomised. I believe the object
and/or its form is associated with every idea, though there may be
ideas/objects for which no corresponding mapping may be readily known in an
expressible language.
Piece of cake. Please check following for what it is worth..

That was based on Br.U. I.V.5-10, and argues that the "unknown" is also part
of the game as a protection system. Once the unknown gets into the scene
there is no limit to how ideas can change.
In fact the biggest mystery of mankind is that life would be so confusing if
a coffee cup in the hand suddenly becomes a news paper; but people are quite
comfortable when ideas in their mind change every fraction of a second. That
is because, as per the argument of Br.U, when ideas change unexpectedly the
prANA protects by itself becoming the unknown idea.
Bringing the "unknown" into the equation systematically, and placing it at
an "appropriate place" (this is important!) (as per the rules of yajna, may
I add?) into the scheme of things, has been a clever strategy of Vedicists.
It can do wonders in unexpected ways.
I am not partial to advaitists, though I take advaitic positions for my
convenience.
