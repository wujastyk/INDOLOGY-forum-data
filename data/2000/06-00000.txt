Subject: Etymology  and meaning of bhAv in NIA languages
Message-ID: <161227058879.23782.1963271579380185639.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,

A friend of mine has asked me to check the etymology and meaning of "bhAv"
in modern Indian languages.

1) Turner in entry 9475 in CDIAL (bhAva) uses the spelling "bhAv" for
Marathi and Gujerati but uses the spelling "bhAu" for Hindi, Panjabi, Sindi,
Nepali.  Are "bhAu" and "bhAv" alternate spellings for the same word in
Hindi (or any of the other modern Indian languages Turner lists)?

2) Turner gives meanings of "price" or "market rate" for NIA languages
"bhAu" or "bhAv". Do any modern Indian languages have a meaning for "bhAv"
similar to "State of being or way of thinking or feeling etc."?


Many thanks in advance,
