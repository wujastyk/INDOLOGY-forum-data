gifts for Sanskrit teachers
In Nepal, brahmin priests, pandits and acharyas have a great collection of
umbrellas. More suitable presents you find in any daana-portion of
Dharmashastra-texts. My pandit in Benares always wanted to know how meat
tastes and asked me - jokingly - to bring vegetarian "meat" as gurudakshina.
