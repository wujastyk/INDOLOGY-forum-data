While I am not suspecting the oral character of Veda, which I have myself
asserted (see my article in the Estonian journal Folklore 8, 1998, 114ff.,
also in http://haldjas.folklore.ee/folklore/vol8/veda.htm), I think that
this argument is not so good. Living in a wholly literate culture the Greek
and Latin authors, when quoting written books, normally did it from memory,
without actually checking the text and thus committed many kinds of
mistakes. Therefore it is important that the mistakes somehow show the oral
character of the text. Fortunately Witzel goes on to this:

I was also waiting for somebody to mention the Polynesian traditions.
Thanks to Witzel for doing that.
