Dear List member,

conch ib Bengali is sankha (pronounced as shonkho) not zakha as Mr. Panda
has written).  Bangles made out of conch shells are called Shankha (in
Bengal). These bangles are a must for the bride in a traditional Hindu
wedding in some parts of eastern India, together with red bangles known as
pola, (from pravala), but made of plastic.
