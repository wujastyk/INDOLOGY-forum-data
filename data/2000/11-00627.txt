Original language of Yoga Suutra
There's an interesting recent article on the YS as being an extension
of a Indo-European tradition.  It doesn't definitively address
language but looks at "cognate" themes in the YS and the Odyssey
among other references.  N.J. Allen "The Indo-European prehistory of
yoga," International Journal of Hindu Studies 2, 1 (April 1998): 1-20.
As far as I know there are suggestions of the YS being an extension
of earlier Sanskrit sources (Hiranyagarbha, etc.) and its ideas being
pre-Indo-European...but non-Sanskrit YS "text" I have not heard of.
Have you found something to suggest this?
all the best,
Stuart
