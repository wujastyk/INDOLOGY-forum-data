Subject: Early Indian attitudes to Western Indology
Message-ID: <161227060577.23782.3981226292577188715.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,

In the last few centuries what were the Indian attitudes to passing on to
the western colonizers the traditional knowledge of:

1)The Sanskrit language and literature in general.

2)The Vedas.  When western editions of the Vedas were being prepared in the
last century was this done only from manuscripts or were the Brahmin priests
willing to recite them to foreigners.

3)Would it have been controversial for a Brahmin priest or traditional
pandit to cooperate with a western indologist.

Many thanks,
