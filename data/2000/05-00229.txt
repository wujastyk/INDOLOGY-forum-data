Vedic Reciters/Wisconsin Card Sorting Test

The question that I asked Patrick Olivelle had to do with the
quotations from dozens of *conflicting* schools that show up in later
Vedic traditions, many of which apparently originated in widespread
geographical regions. To all appearances, this began to occur in the
last half of the first millennium BCE. This is exactly when similar
cross-references begin to appear in Chinese and Greek traditions, when
manuscripts from opposing schools became widely available in those
civilizations. Another way of putting this: there was 'leakage' across
school boundaries at some point, even when there were strong
injunctions *within* the schools to stop all such leakage.
(Esotericism wasn't an exclusively Vedic phenomenon: think of the
Pythagoreans and other so-called mystery religions.) In the sutra
literature, e.g., see the extensive list of cross-school citations
collected by Makoto Fushimi for the Apastamba Srautra sutra, located
