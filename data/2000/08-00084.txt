In the first part of your statement you refer to accepting the Vedas as
revelation, but then you mention Buddhism and Jainism and instead of
continuing to talk about whether the Vedas are considered as revealed or
not you talk about the varNas.  I assume you are not saying that Buddhists
and Jains accept the Vedas as revealed texts.
