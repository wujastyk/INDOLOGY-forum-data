Material for correct time of observance of Hindu holidays in              English
Dear list members,
I am looking for any material in English that gives the rules for the
correct time of observance of Hindu holidays.  One of the list members has
directed me to Vol. 5 part 1 of "The History of Dharmashastra" by P.V. Kane.
  If any of the members can give me references to any other material in
English I would greatly appreciate it.
Many thanks in advance,
Harry Spier
