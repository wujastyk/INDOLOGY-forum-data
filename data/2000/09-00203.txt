Subject: Material for correct time of observance of Hindu holidays in              English
Message-ID: <161227061675.23782.12462591274232981670.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,

I am looking for any material in English that gives the rules for the
correct time of observance of Hindu holidays.  One of the list members has
directed me to Vol. 5 part 1 of "The History of Dharmashastra" by P.V. Kane.
  If any of the members can give me references to any other material in
English I would greatly appreciate it.

Many thanks in advance,

Harry Spier
