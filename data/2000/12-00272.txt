nAraNa_n, the tamil word for nArAyaNa (was: Vishnu)
nAlikam
otl nAlikam nAlikam 01 1. lotus; 2. buffalo
nAlikam
otl nAlikam nAlikam 02 crow
-aNa can be very authoritatively linked to -aNNa as in elder brother.
DEDR # 131:
Ta. aNNan....
Ka. aNNa, aNa = elder brother; respectful address to an older male
Konda. ana elder brother;
The aN- words for elder brother are derived from the Drav. root aN = upper
DEDR #110:
Ta. aNNal = great person; aNNam = palate, roof of mouth;
aNNavi = teacher, director of theatrical performances.
Ka. aNNe, aNNa, aNa = excellence, purity
It is interesting to see from DEDR entries that onlyt Kannada seems
to drop one of the double Ns.
...
A cursory look at the c-initial entries of DEDR shows that there
are so many entries that have s- for non-Tamil languages.
example:
DER #2464:
Ta. cAri = time, turn
Ma. sAri = id.
Ka. sAri, sAre = id.
Te. sAri = id., repetition, occasion
