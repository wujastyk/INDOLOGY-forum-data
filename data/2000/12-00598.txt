Finding books
Maybe I can be of help, if you let me know what you are looking for.
Part of our team is in India, so we might be able to source the books for you.
We have also started publishing digital facsimile editions of Indian
manuscripts, as well
as paper-printed versions of them.
Yours,
Gunthard Mueller
