16th century European contacts with Hinduism
Dear List Members
Arabic now seems the most likely, perhaps with the aid of an interpreter.
Steve Farmer tells me that Pico had studied Arabic, among many other
languages.  The Indian must presumably have picked up Arabic on his long
journey via the Middle East.
from Sir Thomas Browne, Hydriotaphia, Urne-Buriall, 1658, p. 7
It turns out that in the 1st edition, it's spelt Brachmans.  So there is
nothing here that could not be found in the Greeks, and indeed Browne puts
a note in the margin, after "Athens":  "And therefore the Inscription of
his Tombe was made accordingly Nic. Damasc. [Nicholas of Damascus]"
However the paragraph that follows includes a reference to India (though
not to Hinduism) that purports to be contemporary:
The latter part is a clear reference to the funerary practices of the
Parsees, who didn't settle in India till 936 CE.  Browne doesn't give a
source for this, but it must at least be post-classical.
