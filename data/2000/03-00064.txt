I wish people would stop referring to the inhabitants of the UK as
"Brits" -- this Americanism is nearly always used in negative
situations and many people in the UK find it somewhat offensive.  It
seems it bit insensitive especially in the context of the present
discussion.  Would you similarly write "Yanks" when talking about the
Americans ?

Best wishes,
