It has been said,and rightly so, that there are very
few original jokes in the world.What we do when we
come across a joke is to adapt it to the stereotypes
we know. There are a good number of jokes Sardarji's
down to eartiness against the Lucknow Nawab's
sophistication/hypocrisy.Interestingly,the same jokes
are told in Pakistan involving a Punjabi and a
Mohajir.

But here is a literary rather than a social joke.as
you will see it could not have been adapted from
anywhere:

Hindi teacher:Explain the following:
Surdas tab vihansi Yasoda, le ur khanth lagayo.

Pupil: Surdas ne tab hans kar Yasoda ko gale laga liya.
