I just want to add one remark.
In this honoured list itself, with many scholars around, the word 'Indology' is almost always interpreted as
'Sanskritology' i.e. matters relevant to north India.
Where is South India and related matters? Once in a while a few scholars write about Tamil and others are apparently
dismissive about it. In two of my postings, I mentioned that indology does not get benefitted by restricting like this.
Any introspection ?
