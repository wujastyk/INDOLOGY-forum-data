zrIvaiSNavas have the name pitchumani/pichumani with a possibility of
(mistaken?) association with ziva.

Yes.  Love for the child seems to overcome any zrIvaiSNava misgivings about
potential association with zaivism. But the love of parents irrespective of
sectarian affiliation also seems to cheat the evil forces by sneaking in a
very positive "gem" to attach to the apparently unattractive facade presented
by "pictchu/pichu/piccu".
