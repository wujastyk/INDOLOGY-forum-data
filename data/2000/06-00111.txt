ViziSTAdvaita
I have the following questions related to ViziSTAdvaitavedAnta:
1) Are there editions of the following texts:
- GuNaratnakozavyAkhyAna by ?
- zrIraGgarAjastavavyAkhyAna by GargakulInarAmAnuja
- VaradarAjastavavyAkhyAna by ? (all mentioned by AlaziGga BhaTTa in his
commentary on the SAttvatasaMhitA)?
2) Where (apart from NyAyasiddhAJjana, Tattvatraya and the commentaries
on them) can I find explanations or at least occurrences of the terms
zAntodita and nityodita?
3) Is divyAtmasvarUpa a technical term in the tradition of
ViziSTAdvaitavedAnta? If yes, in which text(s) does it appear?
Yours,
