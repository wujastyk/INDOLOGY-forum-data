Hindu roots of Vesak Festivals?
The Siddhantic calendar (Saka,Vikrami,or the Hindu calendar) is a twin-track
calendar. It keeps track of the sun's ingress into a zodiacal sign,as also
of lunar phases.The luni-solar year begins (at least in theory ) with  the
new moon so that the vernal equinox falls in the first lunar month.,Caitra
.I do not think the secod month Vaisakha has any particular Buddhist
connotation. In fact, Buddha Jayanti itself falls in Jyestha as a lunar
festival.
The various aspects of all  calendars  are authoritatively discussed in M N
Saha's Report of {Indian} Calendar Reform Committee,1956. For details of
religious festivities/rituals see L D S Pillai(c.1912) An Indian Ephemeris
AD 1800-AD 2000(Madras),Chaps 1 and 2.
