Gandharva nagar and Saubha nagar
In reference to the word "Gandharva", there is expression in Mahabharat as
Gandharva nagar for Mirage city in the desert seen upside down in the
sky.There is also reference in Mahabharat to the flying city called Saubha
nagar. Any comments please? Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
