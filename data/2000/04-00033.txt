On September 15, 2000 the so-called Advanced Master's Programme of research
school CNWS at Leiden University will enter its third year. The nine month's
programme is intended for students holding a relevant M.A. degree who want
to embark on an academic career in Asian, African or Amerindian studies. The
programme provides an opportunity to study a wide variety of topics under
close supervision of CNWS scholars. Students will profit from the rich
collections in the archives, libraries and museums in the Netherlands. As
part of the Advanced Master's Programme, students are offered assistance in
writing a fellowship proposal for a Ph.D. dissertation, which can
subsequently be submitted to the CNWS or other institutes in the Netherlands
or abroad. Indological research fields that can be accommodated include
Vedic and other South Asian rituals, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Buddhist studies,
Hindi, Dravidian, South Asian art and South Asian history. For more
