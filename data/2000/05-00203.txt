A Hindu Temple Library
Dear Avi
I would like to recommend books on yoga and meditation to become a part of
your library.  A book titled : Complete Yoga Book by James Hewitt is one of
the good ones I have read on the subject.
Good luck with your selection.  If you need my personal views on other books
and at the same time not to bother all members of Indology, please send me a
message at rchawla at dellnet.com.
Regards,
RChawla
