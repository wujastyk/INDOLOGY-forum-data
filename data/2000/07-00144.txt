Harappan Deciphered?! (correction)
Mea culpa -- by error the link I've been providing doesn't lead to the
Dholavira inscription, but to a smaller long inscription.  M. Witzel's
recent post gives the correct link:
Dholavira "signboard":
http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/html/Corpusmain.htm  (midpage)
The other long inscription I gave:  http://www.harappa.com/seal/14.html
