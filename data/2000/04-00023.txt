Found the first paragraph to be informative.  Unfortunately, the rest
appears to be in jest or a typographical error.

>They are quite likely to be people who have migrated into towns and >cities
>in search of employment, but who have found being a mendicant >a better
>business proposition.

Of course, a skeletal body; weather beaten, insect bitten, dehydrated skin;
calloused soles; matted hair etc clearly indicate a much 'better business
proposition.' Highly recommended as a choice alternative vocation or even as
a supplement to your day job!

>Pictures of such mendicants are v. popular, especially if they are >taking
>in a deep whiff from a chillum or a hookah.

Sorry I missed those pictures since tourism literature appear to be target
marketing the nudist, pot smoking hippie.

>It creates a picture of Hinduism/India as still wholly exotic and >very
>mysterious.

Of course, now we are on to these 'mendicants'.  In fact, they are actually
unemployed, frustrated business people and/ or homeless vagrants.

I'm sure this last part must(?) be supported by meticulous research....
