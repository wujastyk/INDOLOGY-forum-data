Indian ascetics
Found the first paragraph to be informative.  Unfortunately, the rest
appears to be in jest or a typographical error.
Of course, a skeletal body; weather beaten, insect bitten, dehydrated skin;
calloused soles; matted hair etc clearly indicate a much 'better business
proposition.' Highly recommended as a choice alternative vocation or even as
a supplement to your day job!
Sorry I missed those pictures since tourism literature appear to be target
marketing the nudist, pot smoking hippie.
Of course, now we are on to these 'mendicants'.  In fact, they are actually
unemployed, frustrated business people and/ or homeless vagrants.
I'm sure this last part must(?) be supported by meticulous research....
