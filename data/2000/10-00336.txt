"Science" in India
Please ask Witzel that question.
Dont you realize that your so called 'standard model' is also based
on poor evidence, misleading argumentation and so forth ?
Standard model ? Based on that flawed assumption you extrapolate
that the others are wrong.
How are you so sure that your standard model is close to the
truth - it has its origins in a racist past and arrogant present.
It is ok to be partisan - but please do not present it is objective
scholarship.
Remember that when I asked "What happens when a person indulges in
mistranslations of passages in order to prove ones point or theory"
See Dr. Vassilov's reply at

Considering the history of mistranslations and misrepresentations
that europeanist scholars have indulged in from anaasa to amaavasu
they cannot be trusted anymore.
