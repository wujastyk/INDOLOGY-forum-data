European ancesrty
I have just seen a report about an article has appeared in the Science
magazine reporting the findings of research at Pavia University
(Italy) concerning the genetic origins of European and Middle Eastern
Males based on the inheritance of Y chromosomes.
Based on the results, it is hypothesized that nearly all males in
these areas descend from just 10 anscestral strains.   Two of these
lineages are together thought to represent 80% of European males are
paleolithic c.40,000-35,000bp and probably originated in Siberia; the
other lineage arrived from the Middle East c25,000-20,000bp.   The
remaining eight lineages are much more recent and are thought to have
arrived either from the Urals or the Middle East approx 9,000-6,000bp
and account for only one fifth of present-day European males.   Food
for thought ?
Best wishes,
