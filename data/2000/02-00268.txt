Sanskrit Spelling
There is such a thing as standard accentless sanskrit or hindi devoid of
colloqialisms with only minor variations. A school educated urban hindi
speaker has a standard accentless pronunciation including bengalis from
calcutta. sakUl is for the hicks and hardly mainstream. Please listen to
newsreaders..
MW> For example, if R. Banerjee calls his colleague from Poona by her first
name, zoTTi (short o, i), she won't answer -- as she is used to be called
zakti (never mind the long i).
zoTTI would actually be satya or truth
 shakti would be pronounced as shoktI. not shoTTI.
Bongs hardly ever use short vowels, their short vowels sound longish.
Bengalis are at an extreme in the way they warp sanskrit sounds. the short a
is taboo in bengali and is replaecd by O or AU depending on context and
subconscious rules.
regards R. Banerjee
