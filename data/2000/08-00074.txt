Nationalisms
Why talk of objective scholarship then?

But do they teach of the holocaust in schools? Doesn't look like they've
learnt anything from it, given the rising spectre of neo-nazism in the
region.
Living memory isn't enough. Is it publicly accepted? Is it in school
books?
Is 50 years enough to set right 200 years of looting? In two hundred
years all local industry had been decimated and the populace rendered
illiterate and helpless. Caught in the vicious cycle of population +
poverty + unemployment, is it that easy to recover?
If you know your economics and sociology, you'll understand why
the Brits are the root cause of the current misery in India. Plus
as a parting gift they have left behind ideologies to divide the
society.
This bunch themselves - most of them thugs - are a product of Brit
cunning and Indian naivete. What meaning has democracy in a country
where half the population is illiterate?
But what can they do about it? Nothing. Probably get more gambling rights
for their reservations. Also see the attempts to prove that whites lived in
America even before the Indians! I don't see anybody learning anything,
accepting anything!

But is that taught as serious history? Why not teach a serious version
of it in English schools?
Oh, haven't you heard about the civilizational mission of the Empire?
Let them learn their true history. Then see whether they'll settle for
autonomy.
After evading most of my questions, you've the gall the make this statement.
So typical!
How can you, when there's hardly any ground for that claim!
Better heed your own advice.
