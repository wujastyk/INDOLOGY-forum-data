I did not say "could not have ", I question is  when was it done and
popularised? Did the sects see themselves in these terms from when? was it
done during the period of Bhakti poetry itself, or did  it become in vogue
during latter medievel period  ? was it popularised  during 18th-19th
centuries.

The parallel I was seeking was the term Renaissance, the cultural
florescence in Italy during 14th to 16th centuries. but the term itself
became popular only in the late 18th century, long after the events

No, it is not my contention.

Going through the U of Cologne KWIC Concordance of Classical Tamil Texts and
searching these two words , for Saivam there was no result and for Vainavam
there was only one - in Tiruvila.

The concordance searches through these books: Tolkappiyam, Cankam,
Patinenkizkanakku, Pazamozi, Kural, Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai,
Civakacintamani, Tevaram, Nalatiyar, Kamparamayanam, Villiparatam,
Tirumantiran, Tiruvilaiyatapuranam, Periyapuranam, Kantapuranam, Tempavani.
