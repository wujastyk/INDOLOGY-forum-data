Black as Evil
Leaving aside the "mainstream" RV datings of Klostermaier
and other Hindutva writers, the periods of composition
of the Veda (now dated downward) and Iranian material (now dated
upward) close in time are highly relevant
to look for the influence of Persia in the Judaic texts in
black versus white imagery.
The Judaic texts appear to have picked up this theme
while interacting with Persia. There is no other
culture except Vedic and Iranian where black vs. white
dualism is brought out and, and the apocalyptic mentioning
of the white horse, black one vs. sons of light dualism etc.
attributed to Persia. I would certainly like to know if there
are other sources than Indo-Iranians for this duality
in Judaic strata.
And, in South India white is worn by widows among most castes,
and brides certainly do not wear them.
How does the hating of black color from Iran/India
from the invading Aryans (c. 1000 BCE) become Indigenous Aryan
theory?
