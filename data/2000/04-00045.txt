Tim Cahill address
Thank you so much for all those who have sent suggestions regarding Tim's address.
 His primary address is tccahill at loyno.edu. (two c's) I think several others that work, but the main problem was their mail server was broken for several days. It is working now.

  You might try tcahill at beta.loyno.edu or, if that doesn't work go to Loyola University New Orleans' web site (http://www.loyno.edu) and look in the faculty directory. Best of luck.
