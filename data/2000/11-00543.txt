Black as Evil

The chapter of Genesis that Ganesan mentions belongs to the E source
rather than the J (not Y, by the way) source.   Also the
Graf-Wellhausen theory has been extensively refined over the past
100 years and further sources for Genesis have been tentatively
identified apart from J and E (Elohist), such as the L (Lay)
source, the S (Seir) source, the K (Kenite) source.  A common G
(Gundlage) source for both J and E has also been suggested.   The
whole of Genesis and the other four books of the Torah seem to be a
composite mosaic of compilations, additions, redactions from which it
would perhaps be difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the
dating of light/dark symbolism -- one cannot guarantee that the older
layers are free from editorial emendations or insertions so while I do
not necessarily endorse Ganesan's suggestions, I think they cannot be
entirely dismissed out of hand though I think that Genesis 1 does not
warrant a light = good / dark = bad classification.   Nevertheless,
just a few lines above the passage Ganesan mentions about God "seeing
that the light was good", there is mention of the "spirit of God".
Most biblical scholars accept that this a Persian Zoroastrian epithet
that has been inserted here so even the early E source has been
edited.
Abinos ?  Vampires ?
But I wonder if there is any correlation between colours for
mourning -- many cultures use white for mourning rather than black so
it would be interesting to note whether they consider black to be
negative or positive in other contexts.
Best wishes,
