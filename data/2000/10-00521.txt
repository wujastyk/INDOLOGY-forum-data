FIREMAND POSTMAN CHERRY, etc.

Please see my recent post on Spoken Sanskrit movement. They are very active
in Bangalore India at least and give regular long term classes there (months
or years) with a lot of people living there basically permanently and
speaking nothing but Sanskrit. They also give regular classes all over the
US and had a one week Sanskrit Camp in California this last summer. I think
they will be eager to put your university on there regular visit list if you
write to Vasuvaj.
