All right, I'll and come out of the closet and confess... Here I am. You
can read all about me in Bhagavadgiitaa ch. 18. :-)

But, as the j;naana and vij;naana of my karma demand, I must set straight
a quoted matter:

No no no. Then where did that 'h' go? This etymology looks too much like a
hypercorrection (probably south Indian, where many people have problems
with the 'h' and with aspirations) - while it should be obvious that 'Koeln'
(as the misleading prakritic French name, with its three syllables, also
suggests) is actually 'kuliina', "of eminent descent", in Monier-Williams'
definition. Na vaa? :-)))
