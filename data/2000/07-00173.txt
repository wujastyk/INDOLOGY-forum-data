Rules of Membership
Well, one important distinction here is that the posts of S. Farmer and M.
Witzel were in response to an on-going discussion on the List, whereas the
paper on Indian chemistry was unsolicited.  I'm sure that if they or anyone
else started using the List as a means of distributing unsolicited papers to
the List membership, they would be promptly removed as well.

[Speaking of insulting posts, K. Elst has learned well the schoolboy's trick
of striking first, and then feigning hurt victimhood as he appeals to the
List and the List's moderator to condemn the nasty retaliation of his rivals.
Has anyone else noticed his rather frequent use of this ploy?]
