Rashad, protector of Lakshmi?
Dear List Members,
Someone I know was recently shown a figurine purported to depict
"Rashad Dav" (or Dan?).  He was told that this was a name for a
"protector" of Lakshmi.  He declined to purchase the object and has
inquired of me whether or not such a figure exists in any aspect of
Indian mythology.
I have never heard of any consort or protector for Lakshmi other
than Vishnu -- but "Vishnu has a thousand names" and I may easily
have missed this one.
Does anyone have any additional information on this?
Sincerely,
John
