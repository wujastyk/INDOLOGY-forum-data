I was trying to reduce the politics, but due to popular demand, here
goes.
   The "Pseudo-Secular" [henceforth psec] bloc (ie. Congress) has been in
the forefront of the Hindi movement for 50 years. The "Hindutva bloc"
[sangh] have always wanted Sanskrit instead of Hindi. The entrenchment of
Hindi has become the biggest stumbling block in the way of Sanskrit.
Hence, the Sangh is attempting to split and divide Hindi, thereby paving
the way for Sanskrit. Witness the Sangh proposal to partition not 1 but 3
Hindi states. This fracturing of Hindi is the groundwork preparation for
the introduction of Sanskrit. Witness Golwalkar's statements,

" There is but one language, Sanskrit, of which these many `languages'
 are mere offshoots, the children of the mother language. Sanskrit, the
 dialect of the Gods, is common to all from the Himalayas to the ocean in
 the South, from East to West."

The following websites shows that power has been on the side of Hindi
rather than English, and that southern opposition to Hindi is still strong

True, but there are concrete plans to carve out Chhatisgarh :

  perhaps bureaucratic inefficiency is the prime reason for the delay.
