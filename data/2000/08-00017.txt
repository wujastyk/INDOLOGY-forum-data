In reply to some of Vidyasankar's comments:

LGR:
>>has pointed out).  Books by Rajaram & Co. do have a wide audience even in
>>the U.S., where there is a large South Asian community.

VS:
>Most expatriate South Asians are very technologically savvy.

Yes, of course.  I am fully aware of that.  Some weeks ago I attended a
talk by S. Kak at the UC, Berkeley campus and one of the most interesting
things was to hear South Asian students from the sciences (biology,
computing, engineering) questioning many of his assumptions after his
exposition of the so-called "new paradigm."
But it is also true that many of them are exposed to all sorts of ideas
from relatives (who read Rajaram et al), and in some cases they don't have
access to scholarly information on the subject unless they enroll in a
South Asia course.  This is, in large part, due to the grandiose claims and
wide diffusion of many of these ideas which seem to have taken some
Indologists by surprise.

VS:
>It hardly helps, for example, to keep snubbing people with
>scientific backgrounds, as has often happened.

A scientific background can definitely be very good, but for some areas it
needs to be combined with some training in the humanities. A positive
example of this kind of combination is Anthony Aveni (one of the principal
voices for the discipline of Archaeoastronomy) who has a solid background
in both astronomy and anthropology.
There have been too many western scientists (physicists and the like) who
have naively accepted many spectacular claims about the Vedas without any
research.  Witness many of the followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
This might help you understand where these comments about hard scientists
and Indology are coming from.

Well, it is certainly dressed in the garb of defending "tradition," even if
it is not expressly said to be brahminical.  The problem, as usual, is:
what is tradition?
