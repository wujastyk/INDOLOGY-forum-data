Violence, 'threats to culture', etc.
Dear Mr Tiwary,
Your new message is intended to be insulting, and this list was not
designed for insults, but for the discussion of classical Indian culture
and language. I have issued one warning to you already, and you responded
with this new off-subject posting.
You have apparently not, in fact, left the list, so I am now cancelling
your subscription.
In the words of the currently popular TV game show, "Goodbye".
