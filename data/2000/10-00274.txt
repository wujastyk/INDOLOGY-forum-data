SV: Semitic origin of Hindu Vijayadashamee
No quarrel with that.
Sometimes, this works in science, but one has to be an Einstein
to pull it off. Engineers do have to do a humanities requirement
to graduate, so they read a little more than the equivalent of
the "XYZ for Dummies" books that are popular nowadays. My feeling
is that the problem is not so much the lack of required homework
reading as with the expectation that theories in the humanities
and social sciences should be scientific.
Maybe so, but the prejudice does not look very good, when worn
with pride on one's sleeves, on the Internet and in public print
media. Besides, when a respected Indologist's prejudice extends
to some of his own colleagues, it hampers objectivity, as I
showed in at least one case.
Best wishes,
