Rajaram's PILTDOWN horse / horse bones
Prof. Vassilkov certainly is right in pointing out that the 'feeding
trough' in front of
Rajaram's "Horse" is a figment of his imagination, or rather his photoshop
manipulation abilities.
OF COURSE,  nothing of this sort in the same seal =  Mackay 453 (1937)  and
= Parpola 772 (1991), see  S. Farmer:
http://www.safarmer.com/horseseal/rajarambull.html
and cf. my enlarged picture from Parpola (scroll down:)
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/Rajaram's-Bull.html
The telephone-like trough is part of the clearly BROKEN OFF SECTION of the
seal!
Same in the copper plates in Pakistani collections, see: SGM Shah and A.
Parpola,   Vol. 2,  Coll. from Pakistan: p. 204-216 and in a few more.
(Except, for the male hare on these copper plates that stands in front of a
bunch of grass....!)
Indeed, on seals we usually have  the larger "stand"in front of animals. Of
course, with some exceptions, for example, the regular bull in front of a
feeding trough in Vol.2, p. 110-114
(M 1080-1097) or in vol. 1, p. 58-70 on and off: bull and even a tiger (M
234-289).
Therefore, we must agree with Prof. Vassilkov:
AND
Add to all of this his "ingenuity" in finding inscriptions that "mention"
horses....
No horses attested in the  Indus civ., see:
Patricia Meredith Greer <pmg6s at CMS.MAIL.VIRGINIA.EDU> asked:
NONE at all see:
Meadow, R. H. and Patel, A.
A Comment on "Horse Remains from Surkodata" by S?ndor Bokonyi.
South Asian Studies 13, 1997,  308-315
(ref. to Bokonyi's paper in the same volume).
cf. also:
Meadow 1998, The Review of Archaeology, The Transition to Agriculture in
the Old World,  19, 1998, (Special Issue  ed. by Ofer Bar-Yosef), 12-21.
B?k?nyi thought that he could find horse bones in at least that *one* Indus
site, but see above.
And note that "horse bones" identified so far belong either to the onager =
half-ass = khor = hemione or to horses from UNSTRATIFIED or badly reported
sites and levels.
The first well-attested horse bones are from the Kachi plains in E.
Baluchistan (already in the Indus plains) only at 1700 BCE...
which explains Rajaram's eagerness to find an Indus horse, hook by crook!
