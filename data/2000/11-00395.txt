The numbering scheme of the Bibliotheca Indica is very confusing. The real
volume number of Pratapacandra Ghosa's Satasahasrika edition is:
Bibliotheca Indica Vol. 153. There are, however, various fascicle numbers;
Sieg and Nobel list ca. 19 fasc. nos., published from 1902 onwards. The
copy we have in our library ends with the prathamakhanda on page 1676. I'm
not aware of a reprint of this work.

Lefmann's edition has been reprinted in Japan. Some years ago, I have seen
an advertisement of the publisher Meicho Fukyu Kai, Tokyo indicating a 2
volume reprint (for Yen 19,000). I do not know if it is still
available. By the way, you know that Koichi Hokazono has published a new
edition of chap. 1-14 together with a Japanese translation? The title is:

        Hokazono, Koichi: Raritavisutara no kenkyu / Hokazono Koichi
        cho. -- Jo-kan. -- Tokyo : Daito Shuppan-sha, 1994. -- X, 989 p.

I am not sure if part 2 has been published.

I remember vaguely that there was a Japanese reprint of this work (maybe
Rinsen?).
