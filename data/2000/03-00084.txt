chariots (was: AIT, NEW  genetic evidence)
If so, (according to the Nostratic theory which derives  Dravidian,
Indo_Euroepan, Uralic, Altaic, Kartvelian in the Caucasus,
Afro-Asiatic/Hamito-Semitic from a parent language of c. 10,000 BCE),
then indirectly.
As Nostratic  is so early, no entry for 'to turn/roll' in the Nostr.
dictionary by Illich-Svitych, except for **t.ur^ 'fast',  IE *twer, etc.
(I suggest the journal Mother Tongue - $ 25 per year - for such questions,
see the website of the journal, newsletter of the  Association for the
Study of Language In Prehistory (ASLIP):
http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/aslip.html
Latin rota, German Rad  (both 'wheel') go back to an IE root *reth 'to
turn'; Skt. ratha is derived from it, by extension of meaning, cf. Engl.
'my wheels' = 'my car'.
(cakra  is more interesting, see below).
Since  Dravid. words cannot really begin with r-, the initial  u- of uruL
may be epenthetic, as in the very old loan word  arahan   (inscr.)   DEDR
201 < Skt. raajan, cf. also araicu  < raajan ''king'', and uruva(m)  <
ruupa 'form, appearance'...
Onomatopoetic sounds are everywhere of course,  ---
cf. late Sanskrit lolati / lollati 'to roll, to loll,', Slavic lel-,
Latin lolium; -- and cf. Engl. to roll, etc., French rouler, etc. etc.
guli 'round object',  gulicaa 'pill', Japanese goro-goro 'rolling around,
thundering etc.';
sounds...
Many studies on onomatopoetica or 'expressive', etc. words,  whatever
linguists happen to call them. Emeneau has one on Drav. of the type
kara-xara, K.Hoffman on the type bal-bal, and others  in Vedic.
Well, 'axle' comes from IE *ak'sa  (Latin axis, Greek -aksa, O.H.German
ahsa, etc./ Vedic:  akSa > (N?) Drav. accu;
but ANi  'lynch pin' is foreign to both Drav. and Vedic languages (though
DEDR derives it from Skt.!) -- and a local loan.
But cakra, Engl. wheel, etc. < IE  *kwe-kw-lo- may ultimately derive from
Sumerian  gilgul 'wheel', cf.  also  (GIS-)gigir 'wagon'.
However, Dravidian has quite a number of loans from Sumerian in the
agricultural field, see
Blazek, V. and C. Boisson, The Diffusion of Agricultural Terms from
Mesopotamia. Archiv     Orientalni 60, 1992, 16-37 , -- --
such as Sumerian ur 'millstone', Proto-South Drav. *ur-al 'mortar' (p. 24),
Sumer. ili 'sesame', Akkad. ellu/Ulu 'sesame oil', which is only found in
South Drav. with eL, eLLu 'Sesamum indicum' but cf. Ved. tila and jar-tila
'sesame';  etc. etc.
Mesopotamia on the Iranian plateau, (cf. also the --supposed -- genetic
connection of Drav. and Elamite,  in McAlpin's work, denied by a number of
Dravidian scholars).
A Drav.- Mesopotamian link, at least of loan words, seems clear, though.
