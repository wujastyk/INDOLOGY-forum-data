Leverite; Vyasa; The Mahabharata
The spelling of the term should be Levirate, from the Latin, Levir,
"Brother -in-law." In the Bible, the duty of a brother to marry and
impregnate his deceased brother's widow (if she has had no son) is given in
Deuteronomy 25:5-10. The vicissitudes of this injunction exhibit a very
surprising outcome in Genesis 38, the story of Judah and Tamar.
