This is interesting -- as you know, there is also a
"vajropama-samaadhi".  In Mahaayaana exegesis, the element that seems
to be emphasized here (as far as I can tell) is the solidity
symbolized by the diamond aspect of vajra.  Given that a diamond was
also thought to be indivisible / unbreakable, it is also used as a
simile for j~naana or bodhi itself.  That is not to say that the
lightning aspect was unknown in Mahaayaana but there does seem to be a
trend in the other direction as time went by.

Further to my above comment, the stress in later Mahaayaana is on the
nirvikalpa aspect of j~naana as hence the solidity / admantine aspect
seems foremost.

See the previous.

But is not Avalokite`svara always male in Indian Buddhism ?   But I
agree with you regarding the pairing you allude to.

I thought this is what has happened already with US English :))
