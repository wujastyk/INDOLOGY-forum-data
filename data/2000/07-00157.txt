I have deleted this member from the list for wilfully posting a large
message to the whole membership.  This is explicitly against the
guidelines for the group, which are very clear and explicit.  See
www.indology.org.uk, under "membership and rules". Recommeneded maximum
size of posting is 2k.

Yes, 2 kilobytes.  One screenful.
