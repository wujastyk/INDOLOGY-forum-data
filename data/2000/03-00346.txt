I will be surprised that if "unrefined names" such as Kuppan, Suppan, Karupaih,
Muniyandi etc., did not exist then, that some how it is a post CT development.
Because these names are primordial and describe a person in very basic terms
versus the flowery highly descriptive names of the CT elite. ( Will be good topic
for a masters thesis to a student of Tamil:-))
