The "older" literature can be found in Akira Yuyama's _A
systematic survey of Buddhist Sanskrit literature_. Part 1:
Vinaya-Texte. Wiesbaden: Steiner, 1979, p. 41, No. 1.67.S.2.
A newer study/monograph in English is:
Maulichand Prasad: _A comparative study of Abhisamacarika_. Patna:
K. P. Jayaswal Research Inst., 1984 (Tibetan Sanskrit Work Ser.
No. 26).  I don't know if there are newer Japanese publications
on this text.
