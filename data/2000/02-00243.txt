Subject: Did the Aryans return to India?
Message-ID: <161227056099.23782.3548096886873213874.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

    Winnipeg Free Press of February 26, 2000 carried a column called "They
all discovered America," by Tom Oleson, one of the editorial writers. In his
column Oleson informs the reader that in April Canada will commemorate the
millenium of the arrival of a party of Icelanders from Greenland (led by
Leif Eiriksson) to North America in 1,000. A settlement dating from that
period has been uncovered at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland.
    But after spending only a few years in what is now Canada, the
Icelanders realized that they were unwelcome and therefore returned to
Greenland. About 400 years later this group mysteriously vanished from the
face of the Earth.
    I wonder if the same fate befell the "Aryans." Montreal based Bhagwan
Gidwani's novel "Return of the Aryans" is based on a similar idea. His
Aryans return to India after a similar experience in Europe, although they
do not disappear.
