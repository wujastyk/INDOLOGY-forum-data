Is Manikkavacakar talking about Jayaraasi of the 8th century?
Jayarasibhatta is partial towards madhyamika while harsh on others
(Eli Franco's thesis). The south had many "Middle Way" teachers,
did Jayarasi learn it there? Does the TiruvAcakam refer to
MaNDana as the mayavadim like later Kashmir Shaivaites?
