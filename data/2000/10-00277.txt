There is always something common between two groups of people. I am denying
any facts if you can ring anything forward. If there is a linguistic
connection between two languages which can be called Dravidian I am not
denying that too

Dravidian identity belongs to languages, not people
It is all very good, but why do you want it Dravidian practice? After all
there are about 500000 different literary and other documents in different
media like palm-leaf, stone, copper-plate in Tamil from 2nd C BC to 17th C
AD. None of them mentioned the word 'dravidian'. Nowhere Tiruvalluvar called
himself dravidian, there are different 'Urais' i.e. commentaries on
Titukkural by different persons like Parimelazhagar. But nobody mentions
Tiruvalluvar as a 'Dravidian'. No Tamil kings or social groups are referred
to as Dravidian in any of the thousands of stone inscriptions. So is the
case with Kannada or Malayalam. There was no proclamation anywhere
mentioning " We dravidians". If this "weness" was missing, then such a
ethnic/tribal identity did not exist.
In contrast, people referred to themselves as " We Periya nattar" or "We
Bhumiputtirar" and different "we"s, but this is important-- no "we
dravidian".

You are calling them Dravidian tribes, but they themselves don't use the
word and not even aware of it. In fact even South Indian were not aware that
till Padiri Caldwell introduced the term. Even then there were riots against
the Reverend's theories. That was how the tamils received 'Dravidian
ethnics' theory- with hostility. But then in Colonial-Colonized relationship
such objections were overruled

Those who use a linguistic term to describe different tribes/communities
without even asking their permission are in maya
