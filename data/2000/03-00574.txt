Indological projects [was: P.V.Kane's HDS in abridged form]
I didn?t mean that Kane?s index is useless, on the contrary, it?s not very
comfortable but fairly comprehensive. I agree, however, with Dominik?s opinion
on a completion of Raghavan?s NCC. This is a desideratum. It needs perhaps
some iniative in India, eventually the Rasthriya Samskrit Samsthan?
