CARB fonts for Macintosh
Dear John Smith,
I downloaded the Times_CARB font for Macintosh, unstuffed it, installed the
fonts in my Fonts folder in the System folder and restarted my machine:
however the fonts don't appear under the Fonts menu when I start my Word
Processors. (I tried Nisus and Word).
What have I done wrong? I was trying to get the Truetype font.
Thanks, and with best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
