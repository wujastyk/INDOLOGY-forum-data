Recordings of Ramayana on music CD
Namaskar!
Dr. Leo Both of Bonn University (who is not on the list) has
asked me to forward the question if there are recordings of the
Valmiki Ramayana -- or parts of it -- on music CD, or perhaps
music interpretations that make use of the Sanskrit text. By
browsing through some web databases we have found something based
on Tulsi's Ramcaritmanas and Indonesian interpretations -- but
nothing that seems to be directly related to Valmiki's text.
Thanks in advance
