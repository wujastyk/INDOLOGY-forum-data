 Ms. Rumer has penned this novel based on the London newspaper reports.
Some smugglers swindled away a famous Chola bronze Natarajar
from the Thanjavur village, Paththuur. Dated to 9-10th cent. AD.
Tamil Nadu Govt. sued on behalf of the presiding deity, Lord Shiva
of Paththuur in the court of London. Dr. George Schwindler, an American
art historian represented the buyers. But the court, in a landmark
judgement, returned the precious Natarajar back to the village temple.

Regards,
SM
