River Sarasvati: Atomic scientists reconfirm location
Paul Kekai Manansala:
Think again: the Rgveda, due to its near-perfect ORAL transmission,  can
serve as a contemporaneous  document (even when it was first written down,
c. 1000 CE, as Albiruni  and the first surviving Vedic  manuscripts seem to
indicate)...
Ever noticed that archaeologists (Allchin :: Shaffer),
anthropologists  (do they even know what they *should* do, right now?),
even geneticists (Cavalli-Sforza :: Vince Sarich, Berkeley)
INTERPRET their data?  And always differently...
Mushy indeed, if one does not pay attention to the differences between
'normal', classical Sanskrit and Vedic, to textual/linguistic levels, basic
rules of comparative linguistics etc.
As for some really mushy stuff, I suggest that readers check out
P.K.Manansala's Austro-centric  website which bristles with etymologies
that put Plato's Kratylos and Yaska's Nirukta to shame.
In this particular case, it was the Roman etymologists that were right:
not:     ex oriente (Savaiki-Pilippinense) lux,
but :    lucus a non lucendo...
