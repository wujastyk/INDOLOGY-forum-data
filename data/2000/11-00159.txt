To all:

N.S. Rajaram has responded to the recent cover story in FRONTLINE
debunking his "decipherment" of the Indus Script (Witzel &
Farmer, "Horseplay in Harappa," October 13) by claiming to find
another Harappan horse -- this time on the seal depicted on the
FRONTLINE cover that debunked him!

To get a quick view of Rajaram's newest Harappan "horse" fantasy,
go to:

Today FRONTLINE published a special 8-page supplement on
Rajaram's newest "horse" -- entitled "A TALE OF TWO HORSES" --
with contributions by Iravatham Mahadevan, Asko Parpola, and
Michael Witzel and Steve Farmer. More data is here (thanks to
Iravatham Mahadevan) that helps us reconstruct the story of the
"computer enhancement" of Rajaram's original horse.

Parpola, Mahadevan, and Witzel-Farmer explain in detail (with
amusing images) why "Rajaram Horse II" (as Parpola and Mahadevan
call it) is an optical illusion.

For a PDF file of "A TALE OF TWO HORSES" -- with the scathing
communications by Parpola, Mahadevan, and Witzel-Farmer -- go to:

http://www.safarmer.com/frontline

The 8-page supplement can be downloaded from PDF file #5. You
will also find Rajaram's letter there and a curious interview
with the
Harappan horse lover.

Michael Witzel and I invite you to ENJOY this special PRE-PUBLICATION
VERSION of "A TALE OF TWO HORSES."
