Early Thai Religion
Besides some Tamil inscriptions of maNigrAma/merchant-guilds that
quote Srivaishnava Alvars, the early bronzes and the writing script from
Thailand show Pallavas' influence. Thai ramayana and Kamba r.'s
parallels were studied by S. Singaravelu, Univ. of Malaya.
Now a lawyer in Sangapore. Prof. Singaravelu's papers are important
for the relations between S. India and Thailand.
See Avalokita with Amitaaba bronzes in the classic study
by T. N. Ramachandran, Nagapattinam bronzes. For Ceylon
Avalokitas, J. C. Holt, Buddha in the crown.
