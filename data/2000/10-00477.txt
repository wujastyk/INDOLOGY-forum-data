Dear List,

please refer to item #022548 in which Dr. Farmer
wrote:

"Rajaram finally revealed this morning (as I suggested
on this List a while back) that his "horse seal" was
"computer enhanced."

Dr. Farmer, please reproduce this email/communication.


A lot of this stuff which has been clogging up the
list with 'off-topics' could have been avoided if you
would have reproduced this communication awhile back.

This is too much!

Please, give Rajaram's bull what i hope and pray will
be the coup de grace!
