> Since "mantra recital's impact on the subject's health" is only one facet
of
the more general question, "Can human suggestion effect unrelated external
events?",

How about unrelated external events affecting human thought. Sometime back I
read about so called morphogenetic fields.

An experiment was conducted where non english speakers were asked to
memorize many easy poems identical in terms of simplicity. The subjects on
average memorized mary had a little lamb faster than other equally inane but
unknown poems.

And now a message to parents in general. Mosh pit, hood wherever ..as one
gets more and more attuned to say rap or any other form of music/rythem the
benifits and enjoyment increase, neural training comes into play you see.
Speaking from personal experience there is nothing more soothing than
banging on drums. There should be a study ...

The vedas could be thought of as some sort of pastoral hip hop, acquiring
greater subconscious meaning as the tradition matures and listeners ascribe
more meaning to it.
