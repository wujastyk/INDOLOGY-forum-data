"Science" in India
<<<
The question should not be why are Farmer and Witzel pursuing this
matter, but why are Indian scientists so silent in their support?
Have they been intimidated?
As Thoreau is reputed to have said in response to Emerson's question
after Thoreau had been jailed after standing on some point of
principle, "The question is not why am I here, Brother Emerson, but why are
you still out there?"
My respects to you, Brother Farmer.

Not just Indian Scientists. Even the Western Indologists.
I have seen none crusading other than Dr. Witzel, a lone exception
