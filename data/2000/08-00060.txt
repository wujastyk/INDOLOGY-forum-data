Franz Osten: "Life of the Buddha"

You must be referring to the film "Die Leuchte Asiens"/"The Light of Asia"/"Prem
Sanyas", directed by Franz Osten (whose real name was Ostermayr), in cooperation
with the Indian actor Himansu Rai, for the German film company Emelka in Munich.
The film was released in 1925; its first screening took place on October 22nd
1925 in Munich; it was then shown in Berlin on November 2nd at the occasion of
the opening of the cinema "Picadilly". Osten thereafter directed the films
"Shiraz" (1928), "A Throw of Dice" and "Achhut Kanya" (dates unknown to me). In
1935, he founded the company "Bombay Talkies" and made another 16 purely Indian
film productions. He later worked for Bavaria Film in Munich and finally ended
up as a "Kurdirektor" (sorry, I don't know the English word for this profession
:-)) in Bad Aibling.
I am not not exactly sure where a copy of "The Light of Asia" could be located
today, but it was shown at a small festival in Wiesbaden in February 1999 called
"Buddhismus im Film". The festival was organized by Barbara K?kenhoff
(Nerostr.34, 65183 Wiesbaden).
I also have an entry for a book on Franz Osten, which however I haven't seen
yet:
Gerhard Koch, "Franz Osten's Indian Silent Films" (New Delhi 1983).
