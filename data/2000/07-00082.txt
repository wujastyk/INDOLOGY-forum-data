Why do we have to suppose a flow of ideas in the connection with
scepticism? Sceptics have been found everywhere, I believe, since times
immemorial. Some cultures or societies may punish them if they get to be
too loud-mouthed, but it would seem to me that scepticism is a fairly
natural state in quite a few individuals. Aren't there people in the Vedic
period who say "neti, neti" in connection with Indra?

How does this jibe with the idea that the signs were used for trade? So
far, we seem to have the following suggestions as to the Harappan sign
function:
1) a proper writing system
2) a logographic system used for trade purposes
3) a sign system possibly used for personal identification
4) a mnemonic system where the sign has the value of a set narrative
More than one of these functions may of course apply at the same time. But
I find 4) dubious. If we discard 1), we are left with varieties of 2) and
3). Combinations of signs may of course carry standardized messages, but if
we were dealing with a mnemonic system as described by George, why would we
find the signs used for trading purposes in the assumed way? How much
semantic/semiotic load can a sign have at the same time? Would a sign be
used as a shipment tag for customs purposes one day and as a symbol for a
standardized narrative on the next day?
