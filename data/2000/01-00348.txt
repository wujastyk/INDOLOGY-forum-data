Subject: Looking for studies on the Rbhu-s
Message-ID: <161227055438.23782.8039537328571447000.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List members,

Is there any good study on the Rbhu-s, giving a more exhaustive treatement
than that contained in the various handbooks on Vedic mythology? I've gone
through Dandekar, but found very little. Any suggestion?
Thank you,
        Sincerely,
                Roberto Donatoni
