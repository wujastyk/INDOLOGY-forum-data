Looking for studies on the Rbhu-s
Dear List members,
Is there any good study on the Rbhu-s, giving a more exhaustive treatement
than that contained in the various handbooks on Vedic mythology? I've gone
through Dandekar, but found very little. Any suggestion?
Thank you,
        Sincerely,
                Roberto Donatoni
