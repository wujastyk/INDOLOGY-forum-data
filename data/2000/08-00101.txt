text is god
If an Indian  from 1500 years ago were to come alive today,would he recognize that  we are talking about him and his times. I suspect we are getting obsessed with the indologists' India, an Asiatic Society type of ancient India.Surely there was a tradition of truth,ethics, common sense,  belonging to the field India. May be,  moulded and influenced by the texts, but  self-supportig and autonomous.
