A place in Medieval Karnataka
In a 13th century Tamil Vaishnavite work, we come across the name "kaGkOrai"
as a place in Karnataka. This could stand for kaGkOrai, kaGkOrA, kaGgOrai,
kaGgOrAi, gaGkOrai, gaGKOrA, gaGgOrai, gaGgOrA, etc. I would like to locate
this place more accurately. I would appreciate any help from Karanataka
experts who can tell us the exact location of this place based on
inscriptional or textual sources in Kannada. Thanks in advance.
