  The "Goddess Ishwar" mentioned in your post is
Inana/Ishtar. The Sumerian goddess, Inana is recorded for
few 1000 years before the Assyrians, and it is probably
derived from a presumed Nin-ana, 'Lady of Heaven'. Ishtar
is her Akkadian name. She is usually depicted with wings,
and two hands. May be it is the wings that you take
to be four hands.

  Durga and Inana may be related, but long before 612 BC.
Pl. refer to Ch. 14 in A. Parpola, Deciphering the Indus
script, 1994.
