But he went beyond linguistics.

They were not days of internet, CNN or instant communication. The book was
written in English and just a handful of  english educated shanars would be
around who normally would not have taken much interest in such matters and
would have least expected remarks from such a quarter. It would have taken
sometime to digest what Bishop Caldwell wrote, and sometime to explain to
other people and organize things.

 Is this an early example of a non-issue that was

What is a issue or a non-issue depends on the subject and not a third party.

True, Ganesan's remark carries more weight than he realises. When the
colonial masters themselves began to be interested in Aryan country club,
naturally the colonised have to be edged out of it slowly just as the entry
into real British clubs were verboten for Indians well till recently.

One can rationalise individual success and failure in a quixotic way, but
that does not change the the British Indian empire as a loot-raj. The same
would be reaction so many zamindars the colonial rule created to make
efficient tax collection

The coveted education and jobs in India now are to become "rotten baniya to
sit in a shop and sell things" to which those who aspire are mostly non-
baniyas.

Romanticizing colonialism does not help. The last remark does not carry
much weight. Race was an unknown concept in India. As far as religion is
concerned there was no idea of One True Male God and all religious paths
were considered by and large valid

BTW, there is nothing chauvinistic about 'padiri' which is a Tamil
corruption of Padre. I was not singling out padiris but the whole gestalt
of colonialism of which Bishop Caldwell was a cog in a wheel
