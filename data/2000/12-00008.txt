Genetics issues in ancient India

I'm in full agreement with this and the rest of your last post.
This key point was missed when the paper by Kivisild et al.
came out last year (Current Biology 8 Nov. 1999,
9[22]:1331-1334), which focused on early migrational patterns
into India. When the paper first appeared, it
was widely cited as providing evidence against any Aryan
migration (e.g., by Disotell TR, Current Biology 9[24]: R925-8).
What no one bothered to note was that the divergence time that
Kivisild found for the most recent influx of the putative
Caucasoid haplogroup U into India (putative since this too is in
dispute) was given within errors of + or - 3,000 years BP.
Error ranges of up to 6,000 years, needless to say, can wipe
out a big hunk of history.
When you systematically review these studies, you get the
impression that linguistics may remain the best evidence for
studying the Aryan migration issue for quite some time. Another
common error in these papers -- one shared by the Kivisild &
Disotell studies -- is to assume close overlap between genes and
language, ignoring acculturation issues. On this obvious but
often overlooked point, I cite a post from Mark Hall this
morning on the NEAsianStudies List:
Hopefully, enough on this topic for now. The potentials for abuse of
these studies in studying migrational issues are manifold -- and
not
anything suitable for detailed discussion on this List.
