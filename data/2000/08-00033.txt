Pancagavya
Dear List Members,
Is it possible to trace the earliest dharmasastric mention of pancagavya? If the five products of the cow can be puricants, why not those of the buffalo? As far as I know (I may be wrong, though!) that taxonomically the meat of the cow cannot be separated from that of the buffalo.
