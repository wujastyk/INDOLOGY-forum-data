Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
I wish I knew more about this subject. Since I must concentrate on my
Hurrian, Akkadian and Sumerian studies I feel I have to accept the
mainstream views of chronology. (I follow the so-called low chronology,
that is, my "1500" corresponds to "1560" in the middle chronology.) To move
Egyptian chronology forward "several centuries" sounds too dramatic; I
would not take such speculations seriously. The destruction of the Mittani
palace at Tell Brak was dated by dendrochronology to some time in the
beginning of the thirteenth century, I believe. See the Historical
Commentary in EXCAVATIONS AT TELL BRAK. VOL. 1: THE MITANNI AND OLD
BABYLONIAN PERIODS, by D. Oates, J. Oates and H. McDonald, British School
of Archaeology in Irac, 1997.
