Migration of Indus Valley People
Dr. Ganeshan:
Thank you very much for the information . Certainly, there is a need to
look at sign interpretations from various locations in India . The Indus
Valley culture still lives on in different parts of India . It is just that
these have not been looked at by common masses in India . The study of this
civilization is still not very common.
I would look into the references mentioned by you.
Regards,
Anand M. Sharan
