Dr. Ganeshan:

Thank you very much for the information . Certainly, there is a need to
look at sign interpretations from various locations in India . The Indus
Valley culture still lives on in different parts of India . It is just that
these have not been looked at by common masses in India . The study of this
civilization is still not very common.

I would look into the references mentioned by you.

Regards,

Anand M. Sharan
