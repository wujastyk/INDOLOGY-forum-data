One more try re: AnusvAra in Vedic Recitation

Is this just due to a typo... or a clear mistake.
The Taittiriya school seems to recite the anusvAra with the "ghuM" on such
occasions,  as far as I know !!
That is how I have always heard "gaNapatiM havAmahe" recited by Taittiriya
reciters.  I am surprised that Wayne Howard doesn't have any note on this,  but
he may not have studied or recorded it much since it is one of the most readily
available and documented schools.
I have a few tapes of Vedic recitation by traditional scholars.  One among these
is a tape recording of a LP from the Unesco Collection entited "A Musical
Anthology of the Orient" made by Alain Danielou in 1950-51.  The Taittiriya
reciter,  Venkatesha GhanapaaThi of Kanchipuram,  recites Taittiriya Samhita
2,2,6,5,50.  He consistently uses "ghum" in the various vikritis whenever he
recites the phrase "(pra)hiNuyAt nirRtiM"...  so in the jaTA,  it is recited as
"hiNuyAnnirRtiM nirRti(-ghu-)MhiNuyAt hiNuyAnnirRtiM".
