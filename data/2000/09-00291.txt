          *Re: muSTANDa, apANDa, eunuchs)*.
          
In the context of male circumcision, the following words (concerning
which I might have more to say) are likely to be of at least some
relevance:

     du?carman (TS+, also N); dvinagnaka (L);
     baNDa (AV+) --- vaNDa --- caNDa [*];
     ?ipiviSTa (RV+, much-discussed); ?unaH?epa (RV+, N).

See Abhidh?nacint?maNi iii. 118 - 119.

          [*] Cf also vaNTa, vaNDara, paNDa(ka), paNDra(ka), SaNDHa.
