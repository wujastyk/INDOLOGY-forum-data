Ancient China: From the Beginnings to 221 BC_ (1999: 106-23). Boltz
strongly emphasizes clear stages in the evolution of the script,
affirming that all indications are that Chinese script "developed
according to the same pattern that characterized the appearance and
early development" of writing systems in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and
Mesoamerica. (Note that this same pattern is NOT seen, as I
emphasized at the beginning of this thread, and as M. Witzel has
likewise affirmed, in Harappan.)

Boltz also writes of "the group of manuscripts written on silk from
the tombs at Mawandui," confirming the views cited above from
Henricks and Shaughnessy. Specifically, Boltz writes:

  Because these manuscripts were written largely prior to, and
  independent of, efforts to standardize the writing system
  emanating from the Qin capital in the north [later center of
  the Qin empire] they show literally hundreds of examples of
  paronomastic uses of characters that would be viewed as
  nonstandard and eccentric, or even wrong relative to what
  came later to be extablished as the precepts and conventions
  for a standard orthography.

("Paronomastic" = what Indologists generally refer to as "rebus"
use of symbols.) Boltz goes on to discuss several "baffling"
uses of Chinese characters found in the text.

Finally please note -- since Witzel's response was to claims by
another poster (*not* Stephen Hodge) that Chinese hadn't changed from
c. 300 BCE to the present (!) -- that the 15 texts found in the tombs
at Guodian in 1994 from around that precise time -- c. 300 BCE -- are
all transcribed into modern Chinese before publication. The reason
is that the majority of specialists in ancient Chinese otherwise
wouldn't be able to read them.

M. Witzel is right: All specialists agree that before the Han
dynasty ancient Chinese was anything *but* "fixed"!

> The Chinese script of 300 BCE is not that of 300 CE!
