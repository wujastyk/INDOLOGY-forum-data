truth is god
Myabe I should rephrase my statement:
"I don't think that it affects anyone's personality [in a negative way] to
know the truth, I didn't stop loving my country because of that."
The nearer you are from the truth the further you are from Maayaa. In that
way , maybe truth is god , if we see moksha as the elimination of maayaa and
union with the purusha. Therefore the seeker-finder of truth becoming god
,and truth being god in itself.
