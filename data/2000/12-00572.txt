We cannot expect ordinary people 150 years back to be linguistics and take
positions on purely linguistic questions. The point to note is that it was
a healthy reaction on the part of ordinary Indians to object to those who
came to rule the country with the aim of plundering it (and within whose
ruling classes Rev.Caldwell firmly belonged) and  who thought that
racially, religiously and politically Indians were inferior , and as an
ultimate insult start to define, who the Indians are and what their
identitiies should be.
