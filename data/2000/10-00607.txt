Buddhism in Bangladesh
In addition to the reference provided from v Simson re: Bechert & 
Roth, there is (at least) one book in Swedish on exactly the 
contemporary situation of Buddhism in Bangladesh. With english 
summary--
      Buddhismen in Bangladesh :   en studie av en minoritetsreligion 
/  Ros?n-Hockersmith, Eva,  Uppsala : Universitet, 
Religionshistoriska Institutionen,  1985   Studies in history of 
religions,; 3;   ISBN: 9150604643;
I have also just found the reference:
Chaudhuri, Sukomal, 1939-
Title:          Contemporary Buddhism in Bangladesh / Sukomal Chaudhuri ;
foreword by Egaku Mayeda.
Published:      Calcutta, India : Atisha Memorial Pub. Society, 1982.
but for example WorldCat has numerous other references!  (Please take 
the time to check such catalogues before asking others for help!!!!)
