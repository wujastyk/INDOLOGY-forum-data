Rajaram as "Scientist"
The ISI (Institute for Scientific Information) database gives a
total of six references, mostly in ISA Transactions, the rest
in InTech. You can also get information on references cited in
a given paper, and other authors who have cited the same. Nothing
newer than 1992 comes up, and the online database does not cover
years earlier than 1982. I presume Rajaram is retired.
