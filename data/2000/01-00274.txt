Dating the Veda: Using the Horse and Planets
How does one conclude that all references to as'va in the R.gveda connote a
horse? S.B.Roy notes that the word as'va in the very early R.gvedic times
meant an ass. (S.B.Roy, 1976, Prehistoric Lunar Astronomy, New Delhi,
Institute of Chronology). So, while expounding on the early domesticated
'horse' and the date of the Veda, one has to be sure if the textual reference
connotes an ass which is also of the horse family though with a braying call
[Equus hemionus (Asia)--similar to the ones depicted on a Sumerian chariot or
ratha]. Santali: asen = to lead about, to carry aboput, to conduct, to tend.
The Concise Oxford Dict. says: ORIGIN OE assa, from a Celtic word rel. to
Welsh asyn, Breton azen, based on L. asinus.
On planets and celestial keys, the latest work is by Prof. B.G. Sidharth,
1999, The Celestial Key to the Vedas: Discovering the origins of the world's
oldest civilization, Rochester, Vermont, Inner Traditions. "The twin As'vins
denote the planets Mercury and Venus..." For those interested, some excerpts
