Mahabharata date. Was: Iron Age in India
I draw your attention to the following information taken from R C
Majumdar(ed)(1988) The Vedic Age ( Bombay:Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan):
"Astronomical references in the Mahabharata itself about the position of the
Nakshatra and planets have been utilized for determining the date of the
war.But,the same data have yielded various divergent results.As a matter of
fact,the statements in the Epic are conflicting and self-contradictory,so
that in order to arrive at some conclusion it is necessary to reject certain
statements or their implications as later interpolations or mere
exaggerations. .No satisfactory and acceptable result can be arrived at from
these data"{p.272}
The book (p.320,note 4)  then goes on to give examples of the various
divergent results obtained by different scholars.
Rai :3140 BC;  Triveda:3137 BC;   Vaidya:3102 BC   ;Abhyankar :3090 BC;
Sen Gupta:2449 BC;   Karandikar:1931 BC;     Deb:1400BC;
Daftary:1197BC;      Pradhan:1151.BC
There is thus urgent need to resolve the issue. It will however be not
sufficient to add one's own date to the existing directory, but  also to
comment on the results obtained so far and show why they should be rejected
