Recombination is very rare with the Y chromosome as compared to nuclear
DNA, which was the basis of earlier studies. This has been proven in
extensive clinical tests and is one reason that it is considered a
fairly reliable marker of paternal descent.
You are right on mtDNA, but a recent article in Science suggests there
is at least some male effect on mtDNA.  I'll try to dig up the citation.
With regard to mtDNA, Indians show greatest similarity to East Asian
populations and also Ethiopians. This is shown in the tables below:

India,"  _American Journal of Human Genetics_, 59:927-934, Oct. 1996.
There is also a study showing similar results by Mountain et
al.(Mountain et al.,(1995) "Demographic History of India and
mtDNA-Sequence Diversity,"  American journal of human genetics,
APR 01 1995 v 56 n 4, p. 979).
A newer publication deals with mtDNA haplotype M, which was formerly
thought of as Asian origin, but which now may be connected with the
first migration out of Ethiopia, and strangely enough into India!

through eastern Africa. Nat Genet. 1999 Dec;23(4):437-41.
Regarding Y chromosomes, global studies have placed South Asians in a
cluster with Southeast Asians.
The proto-European p49/TaqI haplotype 15 is not an important type in
India according to studies I have seen. There are African YAP+
haplotypes in India, but many Indian haplotypes appear to be of Indian
origin.
