Harappan language (latest Frontline URL)
The Witzel-Farmer response is strange.
It suggests that Shendge's differing views constitute "attacks"
on Indological research and that they put her in the same company
with "Hinduvta" folk.
Does this mean Witzel and Farmer are in the same company with
white supremacists who regularly quote from Western Indologists'
pet theories?
I guess Dilip Chakrabarti should now also be worried about
being declared guilty through association or simply overlap of
theoretical belief.
