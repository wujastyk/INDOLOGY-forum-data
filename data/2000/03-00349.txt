For us "Madrasis" includes not only South Indians, but Sri Lankans and Australian
natives too.
But I wonder why for more than  century after establishing the  Boden chair,
the British continued to include the Tamilians, Kannadigas, Telugus, Marathawadis
and Malayalis under the "Madras Presidency "?  Monier Williams admonished nothing
to the Burrah Sahibs ?
Why was all Maharashtra and beyond called  "dakkhin" by Turks and Mughals ?
Too bad , the wisdom of comparative philology and Dravidian studies never fell on
the ears of Allauddin Khalji, Akbar or Aurangzeb.  Inshallah, we Delhi-ites would not
