BG: I am overwhelmed on my inclusion in the category of distinguished professors.
What greater sukha ("axle holes" ?)! Perhaps my next promotion shall be to the
company of "eminent" indologists.

I am  further awed by the thunderous correction to my sentence. I am used to it.
Like  many Indians from missionay schools, even when I was saying exactly what
I meant, my English has been improved by tutors from the Indo-European nations.
Prof. Zydenbos  has rushed to put words in a mouth where Saraswati fears to tread.

BG : Yes, we are all cab-drivers in Delhi and we look down upon all Indians.
For us "Madrasis" includes not only South Indians, but Sri Lankans and Australian
natives too.

But I wonder why for more than  century after establishing the  Boden chair,
the British continued to include the Tamilians, Kannadigas, Telugus, Marathawadis
and Malayalis under the "Madras Presidency "?  Monier Williams admonished nothing
to the Burrah Sahibs ?

Why was all Maharashtra and beyond called  "dakkhin" by Turks and Mughals ?
Too bad , the wisdom of comparative philology and Dravidian studies never fell on
the ears of Allauddin Khalji, Akbar or Aurangzeb.  Inshallah, we Delhi-ites would not
have so ignorant.
