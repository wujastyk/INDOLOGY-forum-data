Subject: Vedic accent in taittiriya samhita
Message-ID: <161227055461.23782.7118945444982612209.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

How are the accents rendered in Maitrayani recitation (assuming that the
tradition is still alive, at least for those mantras used in grhya rites)?
In particular, does the notation used in MS reflect the actual practice?
