[q] Madhva
Have a question to Kannada & MAdhva scholars,
a) Did Madhva attain samadhi in 1317 CE or is it in 1386 CE?
b) When was the Madhva life history put together?
Was it accomplished in 15th or 16th centuries? In the case of Alvars
or Nayanmars or Sankara, the hagiology is done after few
centuries.
Thanks for the info.
