Inappropriate INDOLOGY posting
Dear Sanjay,
As I mentioned to you earlier, I have the highest regard for the Shri
Venkateshwar Steam Press, and I am delighted to have been able to include
a link to your web pages from the INDOLOGY webstite.
However, please note that the INDOLOGY discussion list is purely for
academic matters, and it is absolutely forbidden to use the list for
advertising or commercial promotion.
May I ask you to limit your postings to the list to matters relating to
actual research in indology.
Authors are positively encouraged to send news to INDOLOGY about any
recent scholarly publications, but publishers are asked not to use the
list for promoting their companies; the proper outlet for that is their
own websites, which are linked to INDOLOGY.
Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
