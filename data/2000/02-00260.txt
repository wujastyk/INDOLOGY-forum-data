Subject: Stats on Linguistic Groups

 In a recent monograph on linguistic cultures I have published
over 130,000 stats covering 460+ language groups worldwide
(demographics, economics, geography, etc.).*  I have recently
created a spreadsheet of the database which is complementary to
researchers/scholars.  If you or a colleague might find this useful
for your research, please let me know and I can send you a zip or XLS file
of the data.

Yours,

Phil Parker
Professor of Economics and International Studies
UCSD & INSEAD
