I have not read Kripal's work, but judging by the mails of Vidyasankar
Sundaresan, Swami Tyagananda, as well as your own, the criticism seems at
least partly justified. Apparently, Kripal has read too much Freud and too
little Indology. It would have been interesting to hear his defense. I
would of course concur with Swami Tyagananda that a moder Hindu - and a
19th century Hindu as well - would not see the linga as a penis. Symbols
have a history, and as all bearers of meaning they can change their
semantics with time.
