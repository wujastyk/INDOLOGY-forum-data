It is my understand that the vedic accent set, and quite a large one at
that, is part of std. subsequent to ISCII-1988 (My copy is not here in the
office), and this set is part of Annex G of the set.  It's complete, but
not implemented anywhere I know of.  I remember Mohan Tambe at (I think)
GIST had a role in this and was working on it . . . then there was a weird
rant about the Taj Mahal and ISCII a while back . . . in response to an
effort not unlike yours.  A word of advice in advance: tread lightly.
This topic generates more inconclusive babble than one would think.  It
was IS 13194:1991 (which is out of synch with Unicode 1.0, though unicode
is a superset of ISCII:1991).  Alas, Annex G is expressly excepted from
ISCII-1991.

Have a look at ISCII, at lest, before you proceed . . . Unicode 3 may have
begun to address this.  Unicode 3.0 (see sect 9.1, pp. 211f of the
consortium's volume) encodes ISCII in same relative posiitons, A0-F4/16.
This is an uphill battle to say the least.  I've even heard respected
indologists . . . even leaders in teh e-text field . . . argue _against_
keeping such nuances as the yet-to-be-resolved idiom of ZB accent.

A sad state, if I might eulogize a moment, when the precision of
transmission which is described as a "tape recording from ancient times"
due to the precision of pronunciation is nonetheless in danger of being
lost in encoding.  It would be tantamount to the British atrocities of
building railroad beds with bricks from Mohenjo Daro, or US atrocities of
pumping deadly gas into the air at Bopal.
