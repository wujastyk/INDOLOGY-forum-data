Kannada word for Dharma

Yes indeed, Kittel's dictionary lists a_ra / a_ru with the meaning
'virtue, law, charity' or 'Yama'. Its use however seems to be more
frequent as a first member in compounds; as a simple word, Kittel
only refers to ancient lexica. I have to admit that I have not come
across the word in my reading.
