SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE SEMINAR ON SKANDA-MURUKAN
24-28 April 2001 in MAURITIUS

CALL FOR PAPERS

The First International Conference Seminar on Skanda-Murukan hosted by the
Institute of Asian Studies (Chennai) in Chennai in 1998 brought together
for the first time over 100 scholars of various disciplines from 21
countries around the world sharing a common interest in the composite
Aryan-Dravidian god Skanda-Murukan.

The Second International Conference Seminar on Skanda-Murukan will take
place in Mauritius from 24 to 28 April, 2001.

Since late Vedic times in the Sanskrit tradition and perhaps far earlier
among proto-Dravidian and tribal peoples of the South, the vigorous and
complex deity Skanda or Murukan has exerted a powerful influence upon
Indian literature and religious thought. Even today, his cult continues to
command the allegiance of millions in South India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia,
Singapore, Mauritius and wherever there are expatriate Tamil communities.

CONFERENCE DETAILS AT A GLANCE:

* Hosted by the Mauritius organising committee for the 2nd International
Murukan Conference with Government of Mauritius patronage;
* Organised by the Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai;
* Hosted by the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Moka, Mauritius
* Theme of the 2nd Conference: "Murukan devotion among the Tamil diaspora".
* Proposals for presentations concerning the cult of Skanda-Murukan from
earliest times up to the present will be considered from these ten
disciplinary perspectives:

 * Sociology * History * Art History * Folklore * Ethno-musicology
 * Mythology * Religion * Anthropology * Philosophy * Literature

NOTE: The Conference will provide meals and accommodation for the entire
four-day conference, extras and a post-conference tour of Mauritius will
