The Hon'ble minister says, ``Even Parvathi (Lord Shiva's wife)
would have frightened by seeing the snake.'' (sic)
naishA yuktir nUtanA.
"Sive SRngArAdrA .... harAhibhyo bhItA ..." - ring a bell?
Poor Siva - he has for long been used to nindAstuti. :-))

Hon. Anbazakan and Karunanidhi come from ThiruvArUr. Early Tamil
poems on ArUr Shiva themselves employ this nindAstuti.
   nAkattai naGkai aJca; naGkaiayai maJJai en2Ru
   vEkattait tavira nAkam; vEzattin urivai pOrttup
   pAkattin2 nimirtal ceyyAt tiGkaLai min2 en2Ru aJci
   Akattil kiTanta nAkam aTaGkum, ArUran2ArkkE!
                                    - tEvAram
   [Parvati was frightened by the snake on Shiva; In turn,
   the snake was afraid as well mistaking her to be a peacock.
   And, was calmed further thinking His crescent as a lightning.]
