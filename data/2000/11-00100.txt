Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
As I said, the normal Hurrian word for seven is $indi. All known words for
numbers in Hurrian end, as they should, in -i/e, not in -a, though there is
a case ending (essive) in -a as well as a change to -a- if certain
morphemes follow. But E. Laroche, in his GLOSSAIRE DE LA LANGUE HOURRITE,
lists the word $ittanna from the Kikkuli text and comments: "... "sept",
d'apres l'indo-arien $atta-wartanna. - Forme de $inti/a??" S.v. $inti 2 he
says: "Mais $inti "sept" doit encore etre separe... de $itta."
He also lists a word $ittaa (long a) from two (Hittite?) Kizzuwadna texts.
Laroche, in fact, states that the Hurrian (?) word $ittanna is influenced
by the IA word $atta!
I will see if I can find out more about this later.
