Q: new book on Atisha's works
Dear colleagues,
recently I heard about a new book on Atisha published
by Motilal Banarsidass and I'd like to know which treatises
of this buddhist teacher are translated in it. Here is its title:
The Complete Works of Atisa : (The Lamp for the Path, The Commentary, together with the Newly translated Twenty-Five Key Texts)((Tibetan and English))
Richard Sherburne (Tr.), Dalai Lama (Foreword)
Many thanks in advance!
Yours sincerely,
Dmitry Olenev
