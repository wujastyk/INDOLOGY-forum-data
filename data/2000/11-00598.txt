question, Michio Yano wrote the following:
What is to be noted first is that Aryabhata's view is not 'heliocentric'
but he just maintained that the earth rotates on its axis. There is no clue
in Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya about how he got this idea. But we suspect that
the idea was transmitted from Greek astronomy where similar idea was
offered by Aristarchos. It is interesting to note that the Indian way of
objecting this idea is very similar to that given by Ptolemy. I have
written a paper on this topic: YANO, Michio "Aryabhata's possible Rebuttal
to Objections tohis Theory of Rotation of the Earth", Historia Scientiarum
19 (1980), pp.101-5.

Where exactly in the AryabhaTIya do you see this "clear and unambiguous"
reference to heliocentrism?
