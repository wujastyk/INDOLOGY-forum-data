As Klaus Karttunen wrote javaNalivi is mentioned as one of the
18 scripts in Jain literature. The Yavanas in India were
Indo-greeks, having originated from the Greek colonies in Balkh
region. Some of the Yavanas had settled as far as Tamilnadu
in India.
What I was wondering about is: could JaavaNiiya have been Yaavaniiya
rather than Yaapaniiya.
