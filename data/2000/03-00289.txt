Dates of written Rgveda

This naive comparative historian, who naively jumped into this
list and called the Indologists naive, is deep into studies of
Vedic mnemonics, Panini, Pali suttas, Bechert's redating of
Buddha, and related topics -- trying to cure his naivite. The
question of oral/literate transmission is coupled to other
questions, tied to issues involving the growth of premodern
cosmological systems throughout Eurasia, that I have been
studying with a sinological collaborator for many years. I
understand now, at a late date and with some pain, what issues,
including political issues, are at stake here for Indologists as
well.
Since I started the most recent battle over this topic -- or,
rather, stumbled onto a battlefield in a lull, awakening everyone
to bloody combat -- I have an obligation to return to the List in
the next few weeks with an outsider's report on what he's
learned. John Archibald Wheeler once suggested: "In every field
find the strangest thing and then explore it." In Indology, I've
quickly found the strangest thing. For that, thanks to all.
