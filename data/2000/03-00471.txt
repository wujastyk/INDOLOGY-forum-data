Not really. I don't claim that Sankara's followers were exclusively Saivas.
I don't doubt that Vaishnava groups also got influenced by Sankaran Advaita.
All I'm saying is that there must have been a significant Saiva orientation
even among Sankara's direct disciples. My real criticism of Hacker in this
regard is that it is impossible to identify Sankara himself or his disciples
as being either Saiva or Vaishnava.
