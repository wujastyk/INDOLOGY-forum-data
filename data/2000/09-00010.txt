TO: Indology Discussion Group :

At our Hindu Temple located at Northern Virginia, I noticed that the image
of Goddess Durga has eight hands. The "bahan", lion is there, as in
Bengal, but the "ashur" emerging from a buffalo's body as Goddress Durga
is depicted in Bengal is missing in this image. This image of Goddess
Durga is typically worshipped in North India, UP/Bihar areas (I am told) ?

Goddess Durga in Bengal is always depicted with ten hands. Also, I
think, the depiction in Bengal is perhaps a celebration of triumph of good
over evil ?

Is it possible that this depiction came to Bengal via a migrating tribe who
came perhaps, from outside India long ago and who wanted to remember a
memorable battle somewhere (such for example as in Mahabharata?), possibly
outside of India through, their favorite deity, a Goddess of War ?

(two possible clues: I remember seeing a  photo  from an archeological
excavation at ancient Babylon which depicted a Goddess of War
with four hands. Also, I noticed in a National Geographic magazine
that area of present day Iraq where Babylon once was locted, still has
herds of wild water buffalos in the Euphrates River tributaries !).
As far as the Asian lion, even though there is none there in present
day Iraq or Iran, in earlier times, the Asian lion was rather prevalant
in that area I think ?)

Can anyone explain these two variations of Goddess Durga or comments
on possible link to ancient Babylon ?

Any discussions on this variations and where and when such
variations possibilities ?
