kha (lit. a hole) is used to denote a port, i.e. a means of access or
interface. Generally denotes sense organs or means of acquiring information.
Remember that "manas" is also a sense organ, a means of acquiring information
according to Indian philosophy.

In the etymology of sukha and du.hkha, it means that if one's mind is "su" in
happy state or "dus" unhappy state.

As I was trying to tell members of the august Indology list some time back, you
have to know the "concept coding" used in Vedic literature if you are going to
make some headway with etymologies and meanings. You can not neglect Nighantu
and Nirukta.
