AW: Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
<<<
I call attention to the last publication concerning this problem: O.
Carruba: Zur ?berlieferung einiger Namen und >Appellativa der Arier
von Mitanni- a Luwian look" in: Indoarisch, Iranisch und die
Indogermanistik ed. by B. Forssman and R. Plath, Reichert Verlag
Wiesbaden 2000, p. 51-68. Best wishes Schlerath, Berlin
Can a list member tell us about this learned article?
Did VaruNa and other IA gods exist in Hurrian?
a) yes or b) no or c) cannot be said definitively.
It appears there are problems with very feeble data,
and hypotheses only will make powerful Aryan rulers there.

V. Iyer
