Comparative linguistics
Collating the different strands from your post:
Indology = philology and philology superior.  No wonder the fight to get on
the Indology 'shelfspace' gets so fractious!
Linguistics subset Philology cannot answer all questions; or ,it may take a
few centuries; maybe these questions are not even philological questions.
Philologists, however, do not intend relinquishing an inch of said
shelfspace.
Not the human sciences but, certainly, the all too human scientists
certainly can appear that way.
Last, but not least, malign the critics.
Thanks to all who provided links and reference materials offline. It has
made for some interesting reading. Given the vast Indology universe built
upon philology, all I can say is that Vishnu must have incarnated as a
philologist recently and had one of his 'universe out of a navel dreams'!
