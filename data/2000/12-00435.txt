Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
Gernot Wilhelm is a leading Hurrologist. His book about the Hurrians,
GRUNDZUEGE DER GESCHICHTE UND KULTUR DER HURRITER, Darmstadt 1982, is
somewhat outdated, but there is a more updated English translation: THE
HURRIANS,  Warminster 1989. Wilhelms has earlier defended the "essential"
(wesentliche) importance of the Indo-Aryans in Hurrian culture; I do not
know his opinion today, let us say after Frank Starke's study and after the
excavations at Tell Mozan/Urkesh and Tell Brak.
Important studies on the Hurrians are published almost every year in the
series STUDIES ON THE CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE OF NUZI AND THE HURRIANS. In
volume 10, CDL Press 1999, Wilhelm writes in his introduction: "It should
be emphasized that Hurrian and the Hurrians were part and parcel of ancient
Near Eastern civilization." One tends to forget this, and there are too few
researchers in this field.
