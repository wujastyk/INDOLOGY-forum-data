Namaskar,

Judging by thier recent articles in that Leftist
magazine Frontline and their tirades against whosoever
speaks for Hindus (without Aryan-Dravidian divide),
the answer to your question is a big YES.

These are the ivory tower experts on India who are
running out of steam and getting frightened by the
fact that their racist interpretation of India's past
is getting blown away by truth. Their recent articles
show clear sign of desparation.

Regards.
Jha
