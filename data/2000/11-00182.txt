Dasyus and PaNis inRV
aitareya brAhmaNA vii.18 (xxxiii.6) says "vizvAmitrA had a hundred
            and one sons, fifty older than madhcchandas fifty younger. Those
that were older did not think this right (adopting of sunAHzepA). Them he
cursed "Your offspring shall inherit the ends (of this earth). These are the
(people) the AndhrAs, puNDrAs, zabarAs, puLindAs, and mUtibAs who live in
large number beyond the borders. most of the dAsyUs are descendents of
vizvAmitrA...."
Some more words seen in AB vii.18... "jahnUs, gaAthins"
No answers are needed, questions only...
Does this mean dAsyUs could be Vaidic tribes? If dAsyUs lived in
mediterranean when did they/AndhrAs move to south-central India?
taittirIyA upaniSat uses the word "draviNam" in a verse written by trizanku
who was known to be a contemporary of vizvAmitrA. Is trizanku a draviD?
