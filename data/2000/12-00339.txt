If you take into account the Puranic legend, any midget who
suddenly grows into a tall giant must have been quite lanky :-))
That one throws me. I thought Dadhici, with the horse's head, who
supplied the bones to make the vajra, was an Atharvan ...
I have no idea what Malati Shendge really writes, but I wonder what
makes it okay and non-euhemeristic to refer to the mythical Dadhichi
whenever archaeologists discover real horse skulls in ancient graves.
