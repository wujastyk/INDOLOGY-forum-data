Vimanas
On this I can only say what I used to say to my students.  In general
you have to have the idea of a technology before you have the
technology.  Therefore the descriptions of flying palaces in the
Indian texts are extremely weak evidence for their actual existence.
In addition, the vimanas would require an elaborate accessory
technology to build them, to house them, and to have places to take
off and land.  Why has no one stumbled across archaeological evidence
of this technology?
