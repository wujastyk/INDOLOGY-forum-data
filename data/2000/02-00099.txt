Martin Gardner, in his entertaining book _Fads & fallacies in the name of
science_ (Dover, 1957), pp.28 ff. gives a fairly full account of
Velikovsky's ideas and orientation, and points out that he was not the
first to propose an asteroid collision as the explanation for various Old
Testament cataclysms.  William Whiston did this in 1696.  Several other
authors following Whiston took up the theme.   Velikovsky was just the
most recent to have written about the idea, presenting it as  a new
insight.
