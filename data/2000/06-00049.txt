I know, at least, three bibliographical works on Ramayana in
English that appeared in recent years:

        Smith, Harry Daniel: Select bibliography of Ramayana-related
        studies / comp. by H. Daniel Smith. - Bombay :
        Ananthacharya Indological Research Institute, 1989. - vii,
        127 pp. (Ananthacharya Indological Research Institute
        Ser.; 21)

        Singh, Gaurishankar: Ramayana and Ramakatha : an
        international literature survey / Gaurishankar Singh. -
        Varanasi : Bibliographical Society of India, 1989. - xxiv,
        523 pp.

        Krishnammorthy, K. (ed.): A critical inventory of
        Ramayana studies in the world / ed. by K. Krishnamoorthy
        [et al.]. - Vol. 1: Indian languages and English. - New
        Delhi : Sahitya Akademi, 1991. - lxxv, 515 pp.

A more general reference work in two volumes may be useful, too:

        Epic and Puranic bibliography (up to 1985) annotated and
        with indexes / comp. under the chairmanship of Heinrich
        von Stietencron by P. Flamm, H. v. Stietencron [et al.].
        Ed. by H. v. Stietencron, K.-P. Gietz, A. Malinar [et
        al.]. - Part 1.2. - Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 1992. - lx,
        1052; 1055-2116 pp. (Purana Research Publications T?bingen
        ; 3) 

I hope it helps
