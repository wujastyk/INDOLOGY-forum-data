There seems to be quite a few books coming out on Vaasthu
(also spelled Vasthu?) these days. Any particular reason
for this? Because of the current popularity of Feng Shui
(in the west), did somebody happen to discover Vaastu in
the vedas?!

- What is the original source of Vaastu?
- Is there a rough consensus on the age of that work?
- What does Vaastu mean (literally)? To a layperson (me)
  it seems close to a couple of words - one meaning
  physical/material object and the other meaning truth.

Thanks,
Das
