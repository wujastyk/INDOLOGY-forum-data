Book wanted
Dear Peter,
Many thanks for the bibliographic information.  The Indian book dealer I
deal with (DK Agencies) told me it was out-of-print and that he couldn't get
it for me and thats why I'm hoping that somebody on the list might have a
copy theyed be willing to sell.
Thanks again,
Harry
