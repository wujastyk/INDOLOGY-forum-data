Genetics issues in ancient India
Was there any survey re: Anglo Indians in India? Many of them were there in
India since Britishers first landed. Some of them I over heard Bangalore
still look foreigners who just landed, but they can speak impressively in
original Kannada and Hindi. If Aryans could mix up quickly in 500 years how
long it will take for Anglo Indians to look like Punjabis? I hope this will
be a quickie.
