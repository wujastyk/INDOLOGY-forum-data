 Of Mohinder Singh Randhawa I do not have a full biography. He was old
enough to be active before the independence. He was the special
commissioner of Chandigarh and the Vice-Chancellor of the Agricultural
University of Chandigarh and still living in the 1980s. He wrote at
least 10 books about Indian painting and a few about sculpture.
I?m sorry that my transcription font will not be readable in correct
form, but that cannot be helped.
