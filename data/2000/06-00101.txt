Chutes and Ladders
Thank you everyone for your comments on Chutes and Ladders. While on my
honeymoon in Vermont, my mother-in-law (a local superintendent of schools)
had heard of the game's connection to India and asked what I knew. Since I
knew nothing I thought I'd ask my friends at RISA. Thanks again.
