In case it needs to be mentioned, "Mazdaism" itself represents
one person's thoroughly dualistic reformulation of old Iranian
religion. There is little connection with Rgvedic or post-Vedic

following underlined sentence from Russell implies for his own
theory of Persian influence on Judaism and Christianity.
