Etymology of the words 'vedi' in ritual context

Well, the four sides of a vedi are concave [the east-west sides, which are a
quarter to a third of the length of the north-south, are only slightly
curved]. The resultant form might remind one of an hour glass or a beaker, I
suppose.  Or perhaps the form of a thin-waisted woman, as far as that goes.
