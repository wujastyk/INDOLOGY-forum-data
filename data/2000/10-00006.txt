Appa!

Finally it requires a great Professor to state the obvious. (We should 
thank Mr. Kumar Kumarappan to forward the mail from Prof.George Hart.)

With great humility and simultaneous confidence, the Professor has stated 
the above.

Even after this assertion, if some of our Indian/Indological friends are 
hesitating to acknowledge the Classical Nature of Tamil, then perhaps we 
are talking to closed minds.

Incidentally, stating the above assertion about Tamil does not in any way 
undermine Sanskrit. In this august list, I have earlier raised a rhetorical 
question:

"What do we say to historical (cultural and linguistic) matters related to 
tamil and others? Dravidology perhaps?"

If we don't want exclusivity, then we have to boldly state that
Indology is not equal to Sanskritology;  it should be much more. To state 
differently, Indology does not start from Kyber Pass alone. It also starts 
from Kumari down south, including the submerged land. It is not only Jumbu 
Dweep; it is also Navalam thaNpoZil.

RM.Krishnan.
