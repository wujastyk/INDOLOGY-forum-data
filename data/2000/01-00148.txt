"Likely"?  What do the DNA or mitochondrial surveys say?
The languages of 50,000 years ago are so far removed from the languages of
the last 10,000 years or so as to be almost beyond study.  The relevance of
population and language movements of 50,000 years ago to the question of the
origin of Dravidian would seem to be nil, as you might agree?
I think the point of the authors probably had more to do with -disproving-
any large maternal DNA contribution to the South Asian populations than with
trying to -prove- anything about modern and more recent (a few thousand
years or so) changes.
Even so, one wonders what the ratio of women to men were in those "Aryan"
tribal excursions into India.  Were they like the Greek onslaught on Troy,
composed almost solely of men?  Or if not, how many men originally does the
DNA imply in total, if one assumes that most of them arrived in the
centuries in which the "Aryans" came, however they did it?  I don't believe
that data can say a thing about that.
Much ado about very little, perhaps?
