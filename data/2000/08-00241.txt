literacy. In his paper, "From Orality to Literacy: The Case of the Tamil 
Society", Iravatham Mahadevan says, "Another noteworthy feature of early 
Tamil literacy was its popular or democratic character, based as it was on 
the local language of the people. Literacy seems to have been widespread in 
all the regions of the Tamil country, both in urban and rural areas, and 
encompassing within its reach all strata of the Tamil society. The primary 
evidence for this situation comes from inscribed pottery, relatively more 
numerous in Tamilnadu than elsewhere in the country?The pottery inscriptions 
are secular in character and the names occurring in them indicate that common 
people from all strata of the Tamil society made these scratchings or 
scriblings on pottery owned by them. On the other hand the inscribed pottery 
excavated from Upper South Indian sites is all in Prakrit and is mostly 
associated with religious centres like Amaravati and Salihundam.
