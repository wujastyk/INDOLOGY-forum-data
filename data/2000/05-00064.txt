Buddhist Goddess Identification
Thanking List members Dante, Stephen Hodge,
Swaminathan Madhuresan and David Gray for their
remarks on the identity of the sculptural image of the
apparently Indian/Buddhist Goddess.
The photo itself came to me as a private collection on
an un-labled CD. If the other photos in the archive
are any indication, the Goddess shot may be up to 80
years old. Stylistically, I initially shared
Swaminathan Madhuresan?s feeling that the statue could
be from Indonesia.
I take, then, that the inscription identifies her as
maamakii.
Inscription aside, however, can Dante?s observation --
that she looks like Taaraa -- be disputed? He has
pointed to her left hand <in vitarka mudra ? holding
something: the stem of the lotus ? [t]he right hand in
varada?>.
Finally, can the entire inscription not be deciphered?
Kind regards,
Ven. Tantra
