Dear Lindegaard,
Though not eaxactly what you're looking, the following two articles may be
helpful: Frits Staal's "MAna: Vedic" and Bruno Dagen's "MAna in the Arts:
Architecture and Image-making", which occured in KalAtattvakosha, edited by
B. Baumer, Vol. II, 355-84, N. Delhi: IGNCA, 1992.
Sincerely,
Narender Mohkamsing
