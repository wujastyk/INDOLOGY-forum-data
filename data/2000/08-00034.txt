vasudhaiva ku.tumbakam revisited
"Jan E.M. Houben" wrote:
Thomas Egenes replies that the reference to Manusmirti was corrected in later
editions of his book:
The expression vasudhaiva kuTumbakam is now referenced as Mahopanishad 6:71.
This can be found on page 452 of the Upanishatsamgraha. (Motilal Banarsidass,
1970)
Is this a sufficiently "ancient" Vedic source for the phrase?
Sincerely,
