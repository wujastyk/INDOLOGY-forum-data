But,  pray,  Lord of Madhura,  like the Lord's son at Swamimalai,  would you
enlighten us all your own identity and preferences...  since you have so much to
say on so many varied subjects and times,  are you a moderner or an ancient or
beyond Time ?

I am sure your words will come like the cooling southern mountain breeze to all of
us,  but will yet warm the cockles of our beloved list founder's heart,  who
ever-so-lovingly beseeched all his innumerous anAmadheya offsprings on yahoo.com,
hotmail.com to identify themselves,  but just once in a while.

dayaleni,
