beyond Time ?
I am sure your words will come like the cooling southern mountain breeze to all of
us,  but will yet warm the cockles of our beloved list founder's heart,  who
ever-so-lovingly beseeched all his innumerous anAmadheya offsprings on yahoo.com,
hotmail.com to identify themselves,  but just once in a while.
