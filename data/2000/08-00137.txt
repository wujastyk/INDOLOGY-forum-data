Nationalisms
All conquests/genocides/suppression of cultures/religions should be studied
carefully, with records from both sides carefully recorded and examined.
There have been several holocausts and genocides. People
ought to carefully study the ones that occurred in
Iran and India as well as in other places. Scholars should study the
ideologies that caused such events to happen. They ought to discuss if such
ideologies have the potential to cause these to happen again.

Yes, they do, as they should.
It could be, but evidence suggests that regions administered by the British
in India generally were
more prosperous that the native ruled territories.
Wealth is automatically generated in well administered regions.
Incidentally the Sword-of-Truth stuff on Feroze
Gandhi is mostly nonsense.
