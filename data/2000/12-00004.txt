Correction re: Cerebral L in Rg Veda
Keep in mind that the rule that changes .d to .l in the RV samhita
requires that this .d occur in between two vowels, cf. the RV
Praatizaakhya rule:  dvayoz caasya svarayor madhyam etya sampadyate sa
.dakaaro .lakaara.h (don't have the book with me at the moment for
reference).  Thus the form "ii.dya" does not qualify for this treatment,
while the form "ii.de" does qualify for change to "ii.le".  Now the change
of "ii.dya" to "ii.dia" is not a traditional change, but a suggestion of
modern scholars.  This is why there is no traditional treatment of
"ii.dia" or its change to "ii.lia".  Whether one should make this change
in a "reconstructed" text, is purely a decision of the reconstructor and
not of the tradition.  Compare the fact that when Yaaska paraphrases
"ii.dya" with "ii.litavya", the phonetic environment changes to
intervocalic.  Professor M.A. Mehendale has dealt with this example in his
work "Notes on the Nirukta".  Best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
