I think we have to abandon the idea of "clouds of obnoxious insects" and
instead interpret the word uSTra-dhUmaka in a different way. I would now
suggest that it refers to the animal's colour: dhUma could be a
Sanskrit-misunderstanding of Prakrit dhUma < dhumma < Skt. dhUmra,
"smoke-coloured". Thus uSTra-dhUmaka = "smoke-coloured like a camel".
According to some Lexicographers (see Peterburger Woerterbuch or
Monier-Williams Dictionary), dhUmraka (and acc. to Monier-Williams also
dhUmra, in the TaittirIya-SamhitA) indeed means "camel" (= "the
smoke-coloured animal)!
If we take this together with the passage from Vagbhata quoted by Dominik,
uSTradhUma(ka), also called uccitinga, should be a night-active,
camel-coloured, poisonous spider (it is mentioned together with scorpions,
but, as it "bites with its mouth", it is probably not a scorpion).
