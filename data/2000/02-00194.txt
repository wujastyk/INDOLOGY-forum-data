Q. is the kanda the prostrate or  prolapsus uteri?.
My experience is that the swelling of the kanda is noticeable following
certain sadhanas in men and women. The surrounding tissue first softens with
the stretching of asanas and becomes easily penetrated with the fingers as
described. The swelling of the kanda (yonyarshas) precedes the protrusion of
the inner linga. that is felt as the source of the kundalini.  Women report
the feeling and changes as masculine, while men report it as feminine hence
androgyny..
