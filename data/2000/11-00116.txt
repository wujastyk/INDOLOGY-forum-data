Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
Stephen,
You mentioned this once before and it passed unquestioned.
I lurked in an Egyptology list for a while and it became clear that
the chronology put forward by David Rohl is widely rejected among
Egyptologists, mainly on the grounds of scientific dating of the
eruption at Santorini in the Aegean. We cannot use it as evidence for
anything Indological.
