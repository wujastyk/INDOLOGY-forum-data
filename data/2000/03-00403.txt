Ceremonial disposal of the "asva" carcass (apart from the              asvamedha sacrifice)?
Dear list members,
Perhaps I should have been more specific and should have phrased
my question as follows.
"Ceremonial disposal of the "asva" carcass apart from the asvamedha
sacrifice ? "
I am interested in knowing as to how the carcasses of the "asva"s
that died a natural death were disposed off. Given the significance
associated to the "asva", is it possible that the carcasses of
even the "asva"s that died of natural causes were disposed off
ritualistically (say buried, cast off in a body of water,
cremated etc.)?
BTW, as far as I know, the carcasses of Cobra snakes, irrespective
of the cause of death of the snake, are still disposed of
ceremoniously in India. Could the carcasses of the "asva"s be
treated similarly during the Vedic times ?
Thanks,
Best regards,
Dinesh Maheshwari
