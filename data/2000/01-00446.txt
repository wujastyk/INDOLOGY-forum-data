armageddon myth
As to christianity building on Eastern concepts, there is considerable
evidence provided that an old definition of such terms as heart, soul,
spirit, yoni, lingum are used. The sermon on the mount can then be
retranslated from the Greek becoming an equivalent of an Eastern
developmental practice.
