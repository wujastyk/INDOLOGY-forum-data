Call For Grant Proposals

The Infinity Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, is calling
for project proposals to do research and/or develop educational
materials, in order to improve the authenticity of portrayal of Indic
traditions in the educational system. These projects can either
contribute to the growing body of knowledge concerning India?s
contributions to world civilization, or critique the ways in which Indic
traditions are currently portrayed in educational curricula.

All interested parties will be required to submit a C.V. and project
proposal.  For more information concerning the proposal submission
