Subject: Indus Script Deciphered!
Message-ID: <161227061821.23782.8060773946431493723.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

One more decipherment claim.  Here's the url:

http://www.the-hindu.com/stories/14222183.htm

According to the newsitem, the Archaeological Survey
of India has, however, refused to authenticate this
claim, arguing that the research study needed to be
verified by a group of experts.

In this context, the comments of the Director
(Excavations) of the ASI, Mr RS Bisht are interesting.


QUOTE

Refusing to comment on the latest claim on the Indus
script, Mr. Bisht said a large number of people have
made similar claims but none have been accurate.

UNQUOTE

Wonder if Mr Bisht was including NS Rajaram et al in
his 'large number of people'.

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
