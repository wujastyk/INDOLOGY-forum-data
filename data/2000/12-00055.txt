Tamil Muslims
There are many Muslims who speak a Tamil dialect in Sri Lanka who call
themselves Tamils. Several famous Tamil writers and artists come from
the Muslim community in that country.
L. M. Fosse writes: "It would also include typical non-Aryans like Finns and
Basques." By implication, Germans and British etc. are Aryans. This
even though Europeans have heard the term "Aryans" a mere 200 years ago.
When Europeans are called Aryans, the muslims in Sri Lanka
are Tamils. Of course, They are Tamil Muslims.
