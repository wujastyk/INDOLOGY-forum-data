Dr. Wujastyk:
I am surprised that you are objecting to the word "europeanist" wheras
Dr. Witzel and others have used the words hindutva, indian nationalist etc
to refer to scholars who do not agree with the AIT.
If that is ok, then europeanist is valid too. Europeanists are merely
those who subscribe to the eurocentric viewpoint.
By Dyaus, I still think that "tuSNiiM bhava" is not polite :)
But that decision is upto you and list members are intelligent enough to
come to their own conclusions as to who started the scholarly name calling
;)

Regards,
Subrahmanya.
