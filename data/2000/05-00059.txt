a question for the traditionalists among us
Steve,
For a non-classical method, you might look one of Anantadas's
hagiographies, the Kabir Parachai, where Kabir becomes a disciple of the
guru Ramanand in a novel way:  Kabir hides on the bathing ghats of the
Ganges where he knows Ramanand will come in the morning for his bath.  When
Ramanand approaches, he trips him, causing the Guru to tumble down the
stairs crying out, "Hey Ram!".  Thus Ramanand's mantra is transmitted to
his accidental disciple, thereby initiating Kabir.  Supposedly, Kabir had
to follow this unorthodox path because he would otherwise have been refused
initiation due to his low birth and ambiguous religious status, between
Muslim and Hindu.
Like I said, not a "traditional" way, but perhaps a critique of tradition.
