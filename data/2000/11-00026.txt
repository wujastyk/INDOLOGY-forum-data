Turmoil & shantih
Dear listmembers,
As a new member on this list I am now reaching for the delete button
whenever I see certain names, as I suspect others are doing.
It appears to be difficult to V.V. Raman to understand that this is a list
with hundreds of participants who would like to discuss well-defined
problems meaningfully and dispassionately. I do not like to have my mailbox
littered with angry personal attacks, and it is not very polite to post
such attacks day after day. Quarrelsome people might "discuss" among
themselves, if they like. This has nothing to do with an (artificial)
distinction between endo and exo - it is simply a matter of politeness. By
being impolite and rude, Hindutva representatives cannot gain anything -
least of all understanding and sympathy. To remain "calm and collected in
the face of such outbursts" is unacceptable, and to defend rudeness in
order to attain "long-range greater good" (whatever that might be) is
unacceptable as well.
I believe we should listen to ancient Indian wisdom instead of defending
petty quarrel:
"Na:sti buddhir ayuktasya,
na ca:yuktasya bha:vana:,
na ca:bha:vayatah s?a:antir,
as?a:ntasya kutah sukham?"
