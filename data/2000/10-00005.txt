RAJARAM EPISODE
Are you happy because Rajaram gets a bash or are you happy
that Harappans received attention?  As I have said your various
research and points of view have a different bias, that
you need to contemplate.
As a person of Indian origin I appreciate research in Indology.
But I sincerely beg objectivity and unbiased research.
