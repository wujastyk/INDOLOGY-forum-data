The quietness of the library that the Indology list seeks to maintain is
broken whenever anyone -- much published scholar or rank amateur -- brings
political opinion on this list.  Since the politics invariably pertains to
contemporary India subsequent discussion tends to polarize around West versus
East (or "Aryan" vs. "Dravidian", etc.).

As in the case of the library, noisy political discussion should be taken off
list. Provocateur and provoked alike should be reminded to maintain silence.
