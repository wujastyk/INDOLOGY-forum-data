  Is Sanskrit aa.ni related to tamil verb aa_li(-ttal) = to dig deep, to
 sink? Also, aa_li= wheel, Vishnu's discus; aa_lvaar = drowner, Srivaishnava
 saint; aa_lttu = to immerse, to plunge. "aa_l" to "aa.l" change seems to be
 in aa.lva.l.li=cakkarava.l.li=wild yam.

 Is this due to interactions between Harappa and Sumeria?
