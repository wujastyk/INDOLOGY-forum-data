I will not presume to speak for the practical jokers.  Unlike that group, we
live, breathe and practice Indian culture daily.

If it is any comfort to the scholars on this list, I, for one, would not
have subscribed to this list though I would have certainly taken the time
for a courtesy look.

Sincerely,

Sanjay
