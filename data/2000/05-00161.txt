Impact of mantra recital, etc.

I don't think politics needs to be dragged in here.  Perfectly apolitical
people label their vegetarian cookbooks as "Vedic cooking".  For quite some
time astrologers have called their art "Vedic astrology" eventhough Hindu
astrology does not predate Alexander.  It is nothing new for classical music
as well as for Bharatanatyam to be called "the fifth Veda", so it seems the
inflation of the Vedic component to everything is simply part of Hindu
culture.
