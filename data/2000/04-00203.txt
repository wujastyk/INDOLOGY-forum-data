   From the verb, "aka_ltal", the nouns were formed like:
   i) aka_li = ditch surrounding a fortification, moat
   ii) aka_z = 1) moat 2) tank, reservoir
   iii) aka.lam = 1) jar 2) large earther pot 3) bucket
                  4) body of the lute, as shaped like a
                  bowl.
   Is "aga.da" used in proposing ".d" in proto-munda?

F.B.J. Kuiper, Aryans in the Rigveda, 1991, p.72
"Attention was also drawn to Pkt. "aga.da-" 'pit', apparently
a prefixed form  (p. 41) of "ga.da-" n. 'id'
that is also found in Santali "ga.da", etc. (K.1958a: 352 n.15)
[...]
About the same time Burrow pointed to Kannada "ka.d.da"
'a pitfall to catch elephants' but, whereas Pkt. "aga.da-"
clearly points to a Munda origin [...]".
Is Prakrit "aga.da" meaning "pit" coming from Munda?
Does Dravidian not have the word, "aga.da"?
