 Dr. Manansala's excellent tables throw up some interesting questions.
It seems East Asians are genetically quite close to Africans with
regard to mtDNA. So a Mongoloid contribution and an Africoid contribution
to Indian mtDNA would be indistinguishable. Any way of resolving a
possible Africoid contribution from a Mongoloid one in India ? Has any
work been done on this ?

Moreover, what to make of the following table ?

> Tribals (A.P.)     30     60.0        0          40.0

> Sub-Sah. African  197      1.5       88.7         9.6

 This shows a negligible Caucasoid contribution, even to Punjabi
populations. It has been suggested that this and Dr.N.Mahajan's citations
negate an "Aryan invasion"; before `OIT' advocates celebrate they should
realise that these papers negate any major Indo-Caucasoid presence itself.
Simply put, the papers indicate that there are genetically speaking no
`Indo-Aryans' in India. So, bad news for both AIT as well as OIT. Of
course, this is just part of the data.

 This seems to imply that the first Africoid migration into India occurred
not from Sudan (as suggested by Sergent) but from Ethiopia (presumably via
the Yemen). Or did Ethiopians (presumably `Hamites') inhabit the Sudan
prior to the advent of Sudanics ?

This Southeast Asiatic contribution may come from `Naga'+`Kirata'
immigrations which are attested in ancient texts. Strange also, that they
left little mark in linguistic terms - even East India is IA. Has this
contribution been overlooked, or has the research been neglected ?

  On what timescale could such haplotypes arise ? What would be the
probability of them arising independantly ? Also, is there any reason for
the East Asian-African mtDNA similarity ? C.A.Winters postulated an
Africoid substratum in East Asia, an idea widely dismissed when he first
proposed it on linguistic grounds. Would this research support his thesis
? Or did these genes evolve independantly in East Asia ?
