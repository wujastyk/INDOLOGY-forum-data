Balderdash !

Sorry, but the notion that one should study only the culture one is born in,
or that only people born in a culture are allowed to become experts about
it, or that support is not going to be available for people who want to
study another culture, etc. is so absurd, chauvinistic, bigotted, racist,
anti-humanistic, that it merits impoliteness, if nothing stronger.

Reduce the proposition to concrete terms and note, e.g., it is not
acceptable that the I.C.H.R., whether packed with Marxists or packed with
BJP-ites, dictates to India what India's history is.
