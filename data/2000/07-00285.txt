If one were to use the terms 'you' (your) 'face' and 'punch' in any
discussion (save discriptive medical anatomy), it most certainly IMHO
constitutes a violent gesture. The fact that metaphors are (or not) used
does not eliminate the violence. Why use such terminology when so many other
means of expression exist?
