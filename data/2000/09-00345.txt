Rajaram FRONTLINE paper in pdf
Yesterday I announced the FRONTLINE paper on Rajaram/Jha's horse=bull &
'decipherment'.
We have now received it in pdf form. You can view it via my web site (with
the periodically  updated Rajaram & Jha file (R&J) ---- to keep track of
developments)

or directly at:

Romila Thapar's paper still is missing there as I cannot reach her for
copyright permission. She is 'out of station'.
Unfortrunately, yesterdays's PLUG for the papers, by FRONTLINE editor N.
Ram, was distorted by Bill's various programs. I do not seem to be able to
fix it (it was/is OK on my Mac).  I will resend it later on, maybe once
Frontline of 10/13 comes online.
ENJOY!
M.W.
