Probably one should mention Chizen Akanuma's Indo bukkyo koyu meishi
jiten, too. This work is nearly a contemporary of Malalasekera's and it
has been reprinted more than once. It gives the references to the
Taisho ed. of the Chinese canon (besides those to the Pali canon and
some stray references to Sanskrit Buddhist works).
