Black as Evil
"N. Ganesan" wrote
People say widows wear white because wearing colorful clothes may increases
desires. White being a symbol of satva guNA may give peace of mind. These
white clothes are not really sarees, but they are just men's "dhoti",
usually the dead husband's garments. This practice is not followed any where
in AP. That generation died away. Nowadays widows wear all colors.
There is a clear difference between a white cloth of dead husband, and a
formal white saree.
White sarees (silk or cotton) are popularly liked and worn by brides in AP,
especially on nuptial ceremony. But there will be usually colorful border or
"pallo".
Clothes worn by bride and groom during marriage are also white in AP.
