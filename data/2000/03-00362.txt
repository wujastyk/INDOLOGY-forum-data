Mushtanda; and Bharat

Please bear in mind the contexts in which utterances are made. Of course
there is such a thing as "India", but intelligent people should beware of
overly reifying it. There is such a thing as multidimensionality of even a
single individual's social identity. And any Indian who is reasonably sane
and not living a pipe dream should be aware of that.
Of course. Start with the fact that "Europa" is an ancient Greek name, and
from there you can follow it right down to today, and in various languages.
But if you do not want to find out for yourself, I suggest that you consult
lists other than the Indology List.
Not at all. Of course it would be possible for a polemicist to pretend that
they are by imposing a one-sided interpretation and make a big point out of
this; a person of ill will can always do so, and I do not think that we should
worry too much about that.
