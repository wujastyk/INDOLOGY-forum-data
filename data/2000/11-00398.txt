This is more to do with mass media and modern cultural integration on an
all India basis. Nowadays names Suresh, Ramesh, Ashok, etc with a north
Indian ending or ring to it is common. This cuts across caste lines. Tamils
, who have stayed in the North India for a length of time for job reasons
have named their offspring , boys and girls, along these lines. There are
also Ajit naidus and Arun Mudaliars along with Ramesh Iyer.
This process has accelerated in the last 30 years with cinema, Radio and TV.
BTW, this "north Indian" cultural accuturation has affected not only
personal names but also dress- again irrespective of caste. About 25 years
back one would hardly see south indian girls in Shalwar kameez, mostly they
would be "dhavani" or half-saree. Now among college girls shalwar kameez is
a la mode.
