This "ivory tower expert" on India (who has lived and worked for 5 1/2
years in Nepal and India), and is otherwise termed a "Romantic Euro-centric
Missionary Communist," (NS Rajaram) will not run out of steam for along
time, but he must strongly protest against being put in the  company of
white supremacists:
P. Manansala (welcome back from friendlier, anything goes territories!) wrote:
A.Jha answered:
Small question, for which I beg enlightenment from Akilesh Jha (author of:
Sexual designs in Indian culture, 1979?) :
How can a recently anointed Communist (to be exact, as of Oct. 13, 2000)
share company with "white supremacists"?
Rationalists of all countries, unite!
PS: I did not know so far that only S. S. Misra, S. Talageri, K. D. Sethna,
S. P. Gupta, Bh. Singh, M. Shendge, Bh. Gidwani, P. Chaudhuri, A. Shourie,
and S.R. Goel speak for Hindus...  without the Aryan Dravidian divide (add:
the Sino-Tibetan divide: Newars, Manipuris, and the Austronesian divide:
Balinese!)
Of course, all these peoples belong to the same language family, and ethnic
group... :^)
