Probably he did not consult the scope section of the Indology list. In any
case, his statement did serve a useful purpose. He  said:
There seems to be a definitional creep here. Lars' first "definition" demands
only that a classical language "play a part" in the history, literature and
culture of peoples who use different mother tongues. But, later he expands
the list of constraints by saying that classical languages must be "used by
educated people and serve as link languages".
In "Slaves of the Lord", Vidya Dehejia translates a line of Padmapurana as
follows:
"And Bhakti spoke:
I was born in the Dravida country, matured in Karnataka, spent my youth
wandering in Maharashtra,  attained old age in Gujarat...
                                            Padma Purana, uttara khanda
                                                    chapter 189, line 54"
