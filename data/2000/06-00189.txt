Etymology of the words 'vedi' in ritual context
Dear list members,
The Sanskrit word 'vedi' in ritual context (as found in for example
the zulbasUtras) means a raised area on which a sacrifice is
performed.  As the word seems to be derived from the root /vid 'to
know', how did it come to denote a sacrificial area?  Is there any
etymologi to explain this?
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
