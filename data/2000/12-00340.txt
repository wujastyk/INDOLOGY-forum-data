PDF
Dear All,
It seems to me that this thread has, amongst other things, succeeded
in emphasising that the production and manipulation of file types --
especially PS and PDF files -- can involve a number of complex issues.
I would hope that the discussion has not caused anyone to shy away
from the whole idea. Postscript and PDF files remain an extremely
useful medium for sharing papers.
Could I mention, then, for those of you who don't already know, that a
great deal of assistance, often of extremely high quality, is
available from the following newsgroups:
          comp.text.tex
          comp.text.pdf
          comp.lang.postscript
Many of the issues which have been raised -- font quality,
compatability, conversion et caetera -- are discussed frequently on
these newsgroups.
Hopefully this is of assistance.
Many regards,
 Richard Mahoney
