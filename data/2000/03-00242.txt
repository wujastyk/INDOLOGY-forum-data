Etymology of sukha and duHkha
Dear Prof. Kumar,
greetings, nice to hear from you again.
You are right that, on the surface,
But, please, think of the passion for horse racing among the Indo-Aryans
(Veda), Mitanni Indo-Aryans  (aika-, tri-, panza-, satta-, nava-vartana
etc.), and "Avestan people" (Zoroaster uses horse race terms as theological
terms), cf. also the  Oxus chariot, Old Persian monuments at Persepolis etc
etc.
No wonder that su-kha and duH-kha can refer to the state of your race car:
it needs 'oiling'.
See SPARREBOOM, Chariots. The etym. is  maintained by M. Mayrhofer, EWA
(Etym. Woerterbuch des Altindoarischen) 1986-
Incidentally, if connected at all with Ved. khaa, Avest. xaa 'well,source',
then already of Indo_Iranian age. (Must check the materials in EWA, maybe
connected with  khan-  'to dig').
And, of course etymology can be fun, if done scientifically (identifying
root, stem, meaning), -- but also, when we derive, say, putra from
*put+traa (Upanisads, from an imagined *put 'hell') or  Bhairava from bhii
+ ru + vam as in Kashmiri Shivaism... The German  (of course, humorous)
version is "Loewe, weil er durch die Wueste loewt (laeuft)",  or as the
Romans do:
lucus a non lucendo.
Best, Yrs MW>
