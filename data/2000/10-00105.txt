Dravidian cannot be excluded from Buddha's ethnicity analysis either.
Like Krishna, he married his cross-cousin, a practice
much prevalent in the south so much so it gets the name
Dravidian kinship. (Cf. T. Trautmann's works).

Perhaps just after few centuries of bilingualism,
kinship remains, but langauge is IA.

This is not correct bcause of old and significant exceptions.
Sangam Tamil texts take Arya to mean Northeners only.
But in later times, in 9th century Kamban and so on, Arya is
taken to mean noble.
