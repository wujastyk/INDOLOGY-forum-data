"Science" in India
Dear Readers,
While reading thru the Indology list almost on a regular I found quite a
steadily growing interest in Indian "Science" almost all across the world.
Therefore, shortly in the future we are going to launch a new series of
books called INDIA'S SCIENTIFIC
HERITAGE, the general editor of which is going to be Dr L M SINGHVI. The
series will begin with a couple of volumes on VEDIC & JAIN MATHEMATICS &
which would follow covering almost all the subjects within this field. Since
such a venture has been undertaken by our publishing house for the 1st time
& there's hardly any publisher in India or overseas who
has done much in such a specialised field, so we'd be looking forward to
"superior quality" manuscripts yet to be published by
eminent scholars. However, whatever manuscripts we get for publication will
be thoroughly examined not only from contents point of view, but its
language style. Therefore, we'd be expecting lucid language & to be very
precise it should be in READER & USER FRIENDLY, so that our customers or
readers are not put off.
For the sake of scholarship we'd like to invite manuscripts & all those who
happen to work in these areas.
Regards & best wishes
