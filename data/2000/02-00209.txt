Evils of Written Vedas? (apology for cross-posting)
I seriously doubt whether the mantra AV. 19.72.1 can point to a Medic
"book" to be taken out from a chest and to be deposited again in it. The
mantra is :
    Yasmaat ko;saad ud abharaama veda.m tasminn antar ava dadhma enam /
     k.rtam i.s.ta.m brahma.no viirye.na tena maa devaas tapasaa' vateha
//
The mantra mentions the lifting up of the veda from some receptacle.
