Savitri/Satyavan legend
The earliest version of the story of SAvitrI is contained in the
MahAbhArata, but its roots are to be found in the Vedic Mythology of
SAvitrI/GAyatrI (the goddess - personification of the mantra - steals
the soma=amRta from heaven in order to prolong the lives of the gods;
in the Initiation ceremony the mantra SAvitri 'revives' the initiate,
ensures his 'second birth', etc.).
However, in the course of time the "mythological background" of the tale
was changed; in the PurANas it got connected with the
vaTasAvitrIvrata rite and relevant mythology.
