Harappan Gold
Here is a report from the Times of India, June 4th.  The coins don't sound
Harappan.

Re: Harappan Gold
The newspaper article I read was very general -- hence my interest in
further information.  It also mentioned that the bulk of this horde
was "acquired" by the local villagers before archeologists can get to
the scene.  Of the estimated 3 tonnes that was found, only about three
hundred kilos have been recovered -- the rest will probably be
illicitly melted down somewhere.
Best wishes,
