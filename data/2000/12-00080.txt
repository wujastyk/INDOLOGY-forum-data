genetic markers
Acc. to the map Fig.1 in the recently discussed article on Indian
genetics in Current
Science Nov. 10, 2000, the mtDNA investigation  was limited to Eastern
and South-
ern India; thus people in Western, North-Western and Central India are
not included.
To the extent that mtDNA is a relevant marker it seems therefore that
this investigation
does not contribute to the understanding of the ethnicity of the Indus
Valley population.
As to whether mtDNA or Y Chromosome markers are the most relevant, two
articles
on the genetics of  European populations back to the Paleolithic
recently appeared:
 Tracing European Founder Lineages in the Near Eastern mtDNA Pool
    American Journal of Human Genetics, 67: 1251-1276, 2000
 The Genetic Legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens sapiens in Extant
Europeans:
     A Y Chromosome perspective; Science Vol. 290, 10 November  2000
The findings acc. to these articles are discussed in The New York Times
article:
'Pushing the Limits of Prehistory', Nov. 16, 2000 where a spokesman for
the authors
of the first article (based on mtDNA) says about the Y chromosome
method:
   "Although this agrees with the mitochondrial DNA findings in major
outline,
    suggesting that Europe was populated mostly in the Paleolithic
period with
    additions in the Neolithic, there are some points of difference."
   However, discussion whether the "points of difference" are material,
ought not
   prevent/delay comprehensive surveys including Western and Northern
India.
