NB: following the complaint of HTML format in postings, I have tried to avoid this problem. If someone nevertheless receives this mail in an unfortunate format, please let me know off-line.

I do not subscribe to the Advaita list and have thus not been present in the "original discussions". The rest of your answer about "ignoring all the arguments", etc., I believe are not related to what I wrote but seem to be an answer to Vidyasankar Sundaresan (?).

Of course, I might look up your postings on the Advaita List in their archive (though you did not provide a weblink), but I do frankly find it frustrating that you thus engage in a thread simultaneously on two different lists in this way. I do not feel that I could respond to what you might have written on the Advaita List here on the Indology List. So, what am I to do with that information?
