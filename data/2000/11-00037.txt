Re. vajra
Or is it that a religious (spiritual) interpretation is applied to all
apparently sexual descriptions? (a rather obvious and juicy sprat to catch
the mackerel of the ordinary man's attention and interest)
It depends entirely on what level this is taken at, and where one's
interests (and therefore interpretations) lie.
