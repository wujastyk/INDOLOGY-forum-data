Subject: Arrangement of the INDOLOGY Digest
Message-ID: <161227064005.23782.13475767939096457818.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A question to Dominik or Chris: The increasing number of contributions to the
indology list makes it increasingly difficult to enjoy it because only every tenth
message or so is of  interest for oneself. Would it be possible to arrange the digest
in a way that topics from the contents could be selected without being "forced" to go
through the whole digest? Would it technically be possible, for instance, to arrange
the topics in the digest as links to the respective contributions? This would help to
select quickly such messages which are really of interest for oneself.  It would
also, I guess, stimulate the active participation in the various discussions.
Best
