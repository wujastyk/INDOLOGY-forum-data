Violence in Indian historical process
This is exactly the reason, why there is so much chaos
due to the so-called-political-nature of some issues at stake.
History, as I understand, was taught by people who had more
weight on the left side of the scales, only to cover up or
hush up a lot of issues which would potentially wake up the
minds of millions of Indians. I now distinctly remember, my
favourite history teacher (with whom I still have contacts),
saying in the class, that she personally wondered why the
history books are so biased.
The latter issue - below - is not political. It is this
hypocrisy so evident , is the cause of all political chaos.
Do temples and mosques, as such, belong to any political
party ? Is it not fair to ask how many temples have been
destroyed during the so called 'glorious mughal rule' ?
Did Akbar really practice what he preached - din-i-lahi ?
If temples have been destroyed to build mosques, let us
accept the historical truths as they are. No one, either
on this list, or elsewhere, is going to raze all those
mosques and start another bloodshed.
How long can truth be suppressed ? How long can history be
distorted ? Why is it always objected for a fair and open
view of the Indian history of the past ?
It is rather sad that the growth of Islam and Christianity,
in India (and elsewhere), was upon and over the culture and
traditions of India (and elsewhere). No history or study of
ancient history (culture, traditions, languages, religion et al)
is complete without a complete thorough investigation into the
whole topic - this includes construction and destruction done
in that time frame.
Mr. GT, it is this kind of attitude, that would ruin the list further.
All one needs to do, is have a 'free and frank discussion'.
We all know what this means, when used as an euphemism. :-)
[ too much infighting, differing in views, taking a long
time to agree to come to a finality .... ]
Why not discuss the issue in entirety and accept the past
as it was ? In simple terms, one should be able to complete
a table in the format suggested below.

On a side note, I do support the destruction of numerous
small road-side temples and mosques and all other places
of worship in all towns and cities in India, to facilitate
better traffic. That does also mean, that there must be
some record officially - as to why this was done, when it
was done and how it was done - so that tomorrow, some
leftist historian from JNU or elsewhere does not alter
facts, that this was all done by a fascist regime. :-)
