Vedic Reciters/Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
Steve Farmer wrote:
It seems to me that two different things are run together here that should for
analytical purposes better be kept apart:
(1) depth of understanding, (2) capacity of independent thought. It is certainly
possible for a reciter of Vedic literature to have deep understanding of the
"texts" he recites, but to still be incapable of formulating independent ideas in
other areas or even to explain the meaning of the memorized texts in a vocabulary
other than the one they use. Or else, one should be clearer about what
constitutes "deep" understanding and what constitutes "independent" ideas
Furthermore, even though it may be possible by means of psychological tests to
detect a physiological basis for mental deficits in virtuoso reciters, I wonder
what this would actually help to establish. I think the more interesting
questions are what societal, cultural and/or political features condition the
high esteem certain cultures have for virtuoso reciters, and in what specific
situations precisely what forms of criticism of such "recitation machines" arise,
perhaps, but not necessarily related to the emergence of writing or other
competing "preservation technologies". Regarding these issues, pointing to de
facto mental deficits might be interesting to know (if that can indeed be
established), but would have little, if any, explanatory value - unless one is
satisfied with claims such as "the emphasis on authority in Vedic traditions is
caused by collective frontal-lobe deficiencies", which I seriously hope noone is.
