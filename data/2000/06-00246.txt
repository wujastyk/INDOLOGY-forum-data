two new papers
Dear List members,
I have put two new papers as follows on our web site : ddit.ernet.in
They are available via anonymous FTP under the directory
pub/hbdave/papers
The papers and files are :
etasha_300.ps.gz    Etasha's Prattle (aitashapralapa.h) this is one
                    of the so called Khila sukta in RigVeda, which may be
                    of interest to some members of this List. The sukta
                    vividly describes the experience of a meditator. Some
                    of the utterances match with what Shri Ramana Maharshi
                    taught.
prahlika_300.ps.gz    so called Pravahlika sukta, which describes the activity
                    of mind, jeeva or Durga (as the female aspect of the Ultimate
                    Reality). The word used for these is kumari (not kumarii).
These sukta very clearly show that meditation practice preceeded RigVeda and was
matured by the time RigVeda was composed.
These suktas has interpretation in terms of Advaita also, of course.
I hope some of you may find these useful.
