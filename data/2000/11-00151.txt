Happy Diwali A.S.I.!
Dear Steven and the Group,
You have hit the nail.  I do agree with you that the revised prices by the
ASI is unfair. There is no doubt that every institution needs money for
maintenance. However, the charges should be reasonable. There are other
options from where money can be generated. In fact, what we need is a
professional who can guide about the possible sources of income.
I would like to site an example of museums in Gujarat. The State Govt. has
fixed prices for photographing any objects at professional rates (though it
is a different point that they also charge heavily from research scholars,
too!). I know when I say that photography should be allowed in these
monuments, there is a going to be criticisms about the bad effects of light
on the objects and monuments. But, dear all, all our monuments are open to
sky and summer-sun in this part of the world is more dangerous than flash
lights. Moreover, people using these monuments as a picnic spot are
"hazardous for the health of" these monuments. Next in line are
encroachments of these historical places.
If we want that the concerned authorities should take a serious note of our
concern about these monuments and the ASI, all of us should forward these
posts to the ASI. This will make an impact that we do care for them.
Cheers
DR
