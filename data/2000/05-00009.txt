AnekAnta-Jaya-PatAkA. Journal of Indian Philosophy 23,4 (1995) 381-401.
Van den Bossche distinguishes (1) anekAntavAda proper as the ontological
theory of Jain relativism, (2) syAdvAda proper or saptabhaGgIvAda as the
(meta-)logical aspect, "a corollary" of anekAntavAda proper and (3)nayavAda
as the epistemological theory.
Apart from their specific meaning the terms anekAntavAda and syAdvAda
should , so van den Bossche, also serve as designation of Jain relativism
in general.
