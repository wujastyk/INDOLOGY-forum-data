wanted: Buddhist invocation (Skt / Pali)
Indologists,
   Is there a metrical invocation (preferably in Skt.) from a Buddhist
text which in *any* way corresponds to verses like:
        sarasvati namastubhyaM varade kaamaruupiNi (etc.)
or      zuklaambaradharaM viSNuM zazivarNaM caturbhujam (etc.)
I need something appropriate to teach a group of Intro. to Buddhism
students on the first day of class. Or any metrical slogan dealing with
the 1st Noble Truth.
best,
Tim Cahill
