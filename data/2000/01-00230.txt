Indologists,

   Is there a metrical invocation (preferably in Skt.) from a Buddhist
text which in *any* way corresponds to verses like:

        sarasvati namastubhyaM varade kaamaruupiNi (etc.)

or      zuklaambaradharaM viSNuM zazivarNaM caturbhujam (etc.)

I need something appropriate to teach a group of Intro. to Buddhism
students on the first day of class. Or any metrical slogan dealing with
the 1st Noble Truth.

best,
Tim Cahill
