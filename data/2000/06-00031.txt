June 19-23, 2000

A workshop on the Ramayana is scheduled at the University Centre at the
University of British Columbia.  Organized by the Programme in
Intercultural Studies in Asia at the Institute of Asian Research,
the workshop is being sponsored by the Peter Wall Institute of Advanced
Studies, and will bring together a group of UBC scholars and colleagues
from Europe, India, Thailand and the U.S.A.  On June 20, 21, 22, music
and dance performances relating to the Ramayana will be presented in the
evening at the Museum of Anthropology. The description of the workshop
follows:

MEDIATING CULTURES: THE FOUNDATIONAL ROLE OF THE RAMAYANA IN SOUTH AND
SOUTHEAST ASIAN SOCIETIES

As one of the cornerstones of the social and political life of South and
Southeast Asia, the Ramayana has influenced public life through centuries
both as a verbal and a visual artefact. This workshop is aimed at
understanding the role of the Ramayana in the social and cultural life of
south and southeast Asia from the earliest times to the modern, and the
reasons--historical and social--for its cultural and ideological
viability. The outcome of the workshop, including its edited proceedings
and recommendations, will thus be a guideline for mapping the cultural
space of the Ramayana by using the tools of several disciplines.
