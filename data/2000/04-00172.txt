Vedic
Dear Colleagues
Here are some comments on Michael Everson's revised proposal for Vedic accents
in Unicode (vedic-accents.pdf).
VISARJANIYA (0501) is the older name of VISARGA (0903) and they are the same -
see Monier Williams' Sanskrit-English Dict., s.v. visarjaniya.   I query whether
visarjaniya is ever written superscript, as in 0501.   A vertical pair of small
circles is a variant of a vertical pair of dots.
I think UPADHMANIYA (0502) and JIHVAMULIYA TWO (097A) should be slightly larger
and on the bottom line (see F. Kittel, A Kannada-English Dictionary, Mangalore,
1894, p.xii and s.v.)
Surely the various forms of jihvamuliya and upadhmaniya are exactly equivalent
(being breathings before k and p, respectively).   I have tabulated several
combinations of their forms at
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/stone_catend/jihvupadh.pdf, also linked
from
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/stone_catend/translit.htm
I don't have any views on what particular forms should or should not be included
in Unicode.
I query whether the dotted circles in VISARJANIYA (0501),  UPADHMANIYA (0502),
and ARDHAVISARGA (0503) are really necessary.   At 0903 VISARGA it was not
really necessary, but it's there now.
ZA (095B) is shown as nuqta-a instead of nuqta-ja.
