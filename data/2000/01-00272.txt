Dear Indology Members:

I was wondering if anyone knows of a Jain group that I could contact
which could give me some information about Jain practice. I would prefer
a group in North America - if possible both email and phone. I am
asking because I will be presenting a class on Jainism next week and
need more concrete information than is in the textbooks.

Thank you,
