Could it be that the 'jangama' was a Virasaiva? There are numerous
Virasaivas in Maharashtra too (also in the Pune area), and in
Karnataka the term 'jangama' was originally used for a wandering
Virasaiva mendicant (later it became a term for a heriditary, more-
or-less priestly sub-caste).

The issue becomes interesting in view of repeated brahmin-
Virasaiva polemics about whether the Virasaivas have
vedaadhikaara or not. The Virasaivas redefined what brahminhood
means, and this meant that according to the (more) orthodox
brahmins, the Virasaivas cannot have such authority, whereas the
Virasaivas claimed the contrary. These arguments have also led to
a few cases of litigation, esp. in the Karnataka-Maharashtra border
area. The Rudra recitation was brought forward as a point of
dispute in one case early in the previous century, about which a
short book (in Kannada) was written some 30 years ago.
