Latest news from Dadhyanc
News just received from Dr. Kalyanaraman, the only defender of Rajaram's
Horse I,
and R's new, decapitated horse II (Dadhyanc), exposed and freshly
discovered by Rajaram on the Frontline cover, Oct 13.
The new species has been named, already, after its discoverer:
        equus ashvus Dadhyanc Rajarami
and is a sub-species of the new breed, including, as per Kalyanaraman:
equus caballus, equus hemionus, equus sivalensis and equus asinus, -- the
whole newly re-aligned equid group also already named after its discoverer,
        equus ashvus indicus Kalyanaramani

Like Rajaram,  Kalyanaraman, too, has discovered something new on our
Frontline cover:
(see :  http://www.safarmer.com/frontline
and my own website with links and periodical updates),
that is :         Horse AND chariot:
For the report of this important discovery, see his note on the list called
IndianCivilization at egroups.com, Thu, 09 Nov 2000 00:22:41 -0000:
"As I read the supplement of the Frontline, I am convinced that the
the ligatured sign does indeed look like a horse-head superimposed
on the 'chariot box' [the inverted U, almost like a roof of a Vedic
house -- see Louis Renou's article] which also gets ligatured with an
inlaid six-spoked wheel in other inscriptions. ....  "

How this new decapitated Dadhyanc horse and Kalyaranaman's ass ( = Skt.
as'va! per him, =
horse (equus caballus), equus sivalensis, equus hemionus (half-ass/onager),
and equus asinus, the ass)

One Indus sign gone on the Frontline cover Oct. 13,  just 2 remain:
The U-shaped empty jar with 2 rims/horns  (so well explainable in Italian =
cornuto),
and a strange assortment of 9 small strokes: ANY bidders??  I suppose it
must represent the navagraha, the 9 planets, but I may well be wrong. Any
better solutions?

If all of this good news about decapitated horse-asses and non-circular
wheels wasn't enough,

I can no longer ask you to enjoy.
But it is not Ash Wednesday either.
What about Guy Fawkes' day, Dominik?
Shall we burn all these horses together,
to give them proper burial?
So that they can walk the dustless paths,
in the fold of the gods?  (RV 1. 162-3)
