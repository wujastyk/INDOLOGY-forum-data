vasudhaiva ku.tumbakam revisited
I agree with Isaacson's understanding of the verse.  Yes, it is true that
the context of the verse in the Hitopadeza makes it certain that the
character of the Hitopadeza uses this verse in a deceitful way.  That does
not make the contents of the verse itself any more deceitful than the
contents of so many other verses in the same work which are clearly
citations from other older works.  The story seems to show that a
deceitful character may indeed say very nice things to lure an
unsuspecting person.  It is again the use of this same verse by modern
political groups that is questionable, rather than the original contents.
Best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
