non-elite CT names (Re: Telugu history)
one may survey the rich  cast of the great CT epic "cilappatikAram":
the hero and heroine who are scions of rich businessmen: kOvalan2 & kaNNaki
Their fathers: mAcAttuvAn2 (great merchant), mAnAykan2 (great leader?)
The courtesan: mAtavi (the name of a domestic creeper/vine)
Her female friend (of mAtavi): vAcavadattai
The milkmaids at madurai suburb: mAtari, aiyai
(= "great consort of king" ?given name )jain monk:
The Jain monk guiding the hero/heroine: kavunti
Brahmins:
The brahmin friend of kaNNaki: tEvanti
The brahmin messenger sent by mAtavi to kOvalan2: kOcikamANi (kaucikan2?)
The brahmnin visitor from pUmpuhAr at madurai: mADalan2
Brahmin names mentioned:
kIrantai (a tamil name), parAcaran2, vArttikan2, kArttikai, takkiNan2 (dakSiNa)
The "elite":
Coza: karikAl vaLavan2
The paNdiyan emperor/empress: ceziyan2 (hereditary title),  kOp perun tEvi
Chera: ceGkuTTuvan2
Chera chieftains: azumpil vEL, villavan2 kOtai
Brahmin names are evidently Sanskrit. But it is difficult to detect any
differences among the non-brahmin names.
