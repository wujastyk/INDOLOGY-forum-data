Communalism and rewriting of Indian history
COMMUNALISM AND THE REWRITING OF INDIAN HISTORY
How do politics of today color the lenses through which we examine the
past?  Are the dominant communal forces in India rewriting the
country's history to create new 'enemies'? Or are they merely correcting
errors of previous historians?
