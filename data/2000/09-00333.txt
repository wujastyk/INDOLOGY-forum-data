'>''Classical' does not mean the same as 'ancient' or 'attested since

'>'*not* mean that it is not worth serious scholarly attention. (Perhaps
'>'this needs to be mentioned here.)
    Would you or soemone else on this list be kind enough to explain
    what is a classical language and why Tamil is not one of them ?
    Thanks
