I don't recall making any claims nor does McEvilley as far as I can
see.  But no, I would call this a hypothesis which then needs to be
tested and evaulated.  If the facts -- no matter how surprising --
fit, then it can be provisionally accepted.  If not, then it remains a
hypothesis which can be discarded if shown to be completely false.
To my mind, it is just as much a prejudice to dismiss any hypothesis
without contrary proof as it it to assert a claim without proof.
