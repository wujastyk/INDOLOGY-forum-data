N.J. Allen Article & Tapas
Many thanks to N.J. Allen for attaching the text to
his very interesting article ?THE INDO-EUROPEAN
PREHISTORY OF YOGA," International Journal of Hindu
Studies, 2, 1 (April, 1998):1-20.
Of particular interest is his ?Indo-European cultural
comparativistic? approach to the subject of "tapas".
He compares the heroic ordeals of Odysseus with
ascetics from pre-historic Indian sources. Hence when
?he sleeps in his pile of leaves, the Greek hero is
likened to a firebrand (dalon) carefully kept alight
under a heap of ashes (5.487).?
The author then points to a series of Svetaambara Jain
scriptural stories where a king that becomes an
ascetic similarly ?undertakes intense austerities and
is likened to ?fire confined within a heap of ashes.?
For my own, I would agree with the author that if
accepted, ?the rapprochement has bearing on the
history of the notion of tapas (literally ?heat?),? n.
12.
