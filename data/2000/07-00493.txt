Yonivaktra and manojyotis
Two unrelated questions on behalf of a friend not on this list:
1. A text he came across described the shape of a certain vedi as
'yonivaktra'. Does anyone know where he can find a more elaborate
description of this, and/or an illustration?
2. Who is the .r.si of the 'mano jyoti.h' mantra in Vaajasaneyi-sa.mhitaa
2.13?
Many thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
