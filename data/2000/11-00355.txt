Indologists,

If anyone can supply me w/ the email address of Sunthar Visuvalingam
(France?) I would appreciate it. His article in A. Hiltebeitel's *Criminal
Gods and Demon Devotees* (SUNY 1989) lists a B.H.U. dissertation and
alludes to forthcoming volumes which I've never been able to locate.

best,
Tim Cahill
