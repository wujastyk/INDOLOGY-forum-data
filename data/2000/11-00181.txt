Dasyus of vedas are the same as Daha of Gathas and Dahae of Greek
reference.( I don't have the refernce URL at the moment). There is nothing
to suggest that Dasyu/Dasa/Daha/Dahae were any different from the composers
of Vedas i.e. aryas in speech or appearance. So this group Dasyu/Daha were
spread over much of India, Iran and central asia
To really settle this question , the folowing steps must be taken:
1. Skeletal remains are found across the alleged/proposed route of entering
or migration
2. Reconstructions of skeletal remains must be undertaken using up-to-date
forensic and archeological technology so that a reasonable reconstruction.
The reconstructions must show the , DNA profile , height, physical
features, skin colour, hair , etc with a reasonable degree of confidence
3. All this reconstructions must also reveal if possible the  most likely
the conditions of living and manner of dying
4. These skeletal remians must be proved to belong to what the contemporary
evidence called "dravidians". i.e. if you find a skeletal remain of the
period 1000 BC, then you should look into contemporary records for
Dravidians and show that the record matches with that of the skeletal
remain.
At the moment when we say "dravidian" , primarily it is linguistic tool and
secondarily it means whoever spoke (as their mother tongue) this language.
Hence from the skeletal remain we cannot determine what language the person
spoke when alive
My thoery is this is impossible to settle at all this question. I have not
come across any single reconstruction as delienated in Step 2 of anyboby or
body in India Even the question itself assumes so many things, the question
can be dropped without any loss to Indology or archeology at the moment.
To the best of my knowledge the ancient people from Central
Batlles of the 19th century are not yet over, leave alone 20th
