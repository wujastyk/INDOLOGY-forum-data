I hope I'm not making an ass of myself :-), but the animal in
the seal at http://www.safarmer.com/pico/delusion2.html does not
look like a donkey -- the tail rules that out.

What is at the head is totally unclear in the picture of the seal
given. The artist's depiction shows a filled peepal leaf over the
head; the seal at best has the outline of such a leaf.

Moreover, the hindquarters of the animal in the seal do not match
any unicorn that I can find at www.harrapa.com
