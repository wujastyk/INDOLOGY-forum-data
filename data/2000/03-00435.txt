Ceremonial disposal of the "asva" carcass ?
PK Manansala:
So you checked.
After checking the two RV hymns for any (vague) references to rice/odana at
home yesterday, I was about to do the same, for zoology, to have reliable
information. I know, of course, about the Arabian horse, but what we need
is good information, such as the RV one, on the distribution of the various
types of horses *early on*.
More later on.
At any rate, all of this  does *not* yet solve the initial problem : how a
VERY long gone pre-prehistoric type of horse (the Sivalensis) could have
effected the emergence of 17 pairs of ribs in Indian (Rgvedic) horses.
(And how the Arabian one could sprout another 4 extra ribs...)
