[Re: Inputting Sanskrit Dictionary(Bon-wa Daijiten)]
To say exactly, What I have done was based on the Bon-wa Daijiten to collect
words, and is not the same with that. My <list of words> is quite different
from Bon-wa Daijiten in many points, but rather looks similar with Hirakawa's
Chinese-Sanskrit Dictionary(1997), which is also based on Bon-wa Daijiten. 
please see my sample.(http://phaidrus.hihome.com)
I basically agree with Dr.Hodge but I wonder if my work need a permission from
them. I couldn't come up with copyright law in this case well. But If I need a
permisstion, I'll try. 
I'am looking for the way everybody can use this free.

This sounds a very useful and worthwhile project.  However there is
one big problem.   As far as I know the Bon-Wa Jiten is still
copyrighted.   As I understand the situation, unless you have explicit
permission from the publishers, it will be illegal under international
copyright law to publish this electronically -- I assume Korea is a
signatory to this law.   You could be liable to claims of very
substantial damages.
