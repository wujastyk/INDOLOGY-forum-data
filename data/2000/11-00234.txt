History of the religeous title bhagavAn
I believe it is a "creative" etymology such as one sometimes finds in
commentorial literature.  I have just had a quick look a few reference
sources on hand but I couldn't find what I was looking for -- a lot of
my books are stashed away right now.  I'll have a more thorough search
to track a reference down for you if you want when I have finished
current writing obligations.  The Tibetan sGra-sbyor -- a useful
etymological commentary to accompany part of the Mahaavyutpatti will
have some info about "bhagavat" but I doubt it covers tantric
interpretations.  By the way, Qumran is not in Egypt -- it is on the
north-western shore of the Dead Sea -- I think it might now be under
Palestinian control at present though it was part of the territory
appropriated by Israel after the 6 Day War.
Best wishes,
