Dear Dr. Kalyanaraman,

Your resentment has gotten the best of you.  You shouldn't blame Michael
Witzel for the failure of your website, and for your failure to gain an
audience on this list.  Your failure is the result of the fact that you
insist on talking about Vedic and Avestan as if you knew these languages,
when it is clear that you don't.

Who is the blame for that?  Michael Witzel?  I don't think so.
