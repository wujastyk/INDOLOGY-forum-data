        Although I have no proof, but I guess the mantras mentioned in Raghuvamsa
are those from Dhanur Veda. At least according to the tradition, when a
ksatriya releases an arrow he utters a particular mantra in order to invoke
a particular deity who presides over particular "spells of nature". Thus,
for example, I can shoot an arrow "accompanied" with fire (to burn my
enemy), for this purpose, most probably, I need to invoke Agnideva, who is
the Fire himself. To counteract such an arrow, one has to shoot an arrow
"accompanied" with water (to extinguish the fire), I need to invoke,
probably, Varuna. So, it works like this. Even the so-called brahmastra
requires a mantra uttered by the archer and can be counteracted by another
brahmastra only (compare Bhagavata Purana, first Canto).
        I hope this helps somehow.

With best wishes,
Sergei Schmalz.
