Can you tell me when do the words "Saivam"   and  "VaiNavam" occur in the
Tamil literature. For example do they occur in the Prabhandam or Nayanmar
works itself? or do they occur much later?
As far as I can see these words are the Tamil translations of the English
words Saivism and Vaishnavism. But the Tamil texts themselves were unaware
of 'ism's. But still it would be interesting to know when do these two words
in the sense of 'isms's appear in the Tamil texts
