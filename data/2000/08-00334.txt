Three major scientific problems -

1. It is highly anachronistic to apply the notion of IQ to peoples who did
not think of such a thing, at a time when nobody in the world ever thought
of such a thing.

2. The assumption that intelligence, like the color of the skin, is an
inherited trait, is profoundly unfounded. The only people who will support
your stand are the authors of The Bell Curve, who would make for very
strange bedfellows. In case you don't realize it, your argument takes you
down a very slippery slope.

3. There is an internal contradiction involved. Surely, you must hold that
varNa rules were strictly enforced, as they had to be, if the socially
powerful status of the Brahmana and the Kshatriya had to be maintained. If
so, marrying "high-IQ" people from outside the immediate community could not
have been possible. In case you didn't know, manu and others delight in
giving detailed lists of what castes the offspring of mixed marriages should
be assigned to.

A fourth, social issue - There never was a time when Jews were not
persecuted in Europe. A rather strong case can be made that Nazi
anti-Semitism was only the logical culmination of centuries of European
ill-feeling against the Jews. Not so with Brahmanas in India. Blaming
Brahmanas for all India's social ills is a rather recent development.

Best,
Vidyasankar
