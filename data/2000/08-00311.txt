History of Mughalstan
Anand M. Sharan,
Excuse me, was there a library spared? You talk of Nalanda as if that was
the only one destroyed.
That greatly minimizes what happened. A large number
of people, both ordinary and noble, were taken into
slavery, flooding the slave markets.
I have seen an estimate that a third of India's
population perished in the first 2-3  centuries
of Islamic expansion.
Were they spared in North? Is there one that the
conquerers did not destroy in the area conquered?
However it must be said that India was luckier
than Iran where devastation was almost total,
leaving only a trace of the past.
Rustam
