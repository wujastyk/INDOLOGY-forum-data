NyAya has influenced Advaita? This doesn't cut too much ice
either for almost all schools both Astika and nAstika, have
benefitted by NyAya's standards and formulations in logic.
But again when comparing Advaita and NyAya, there's a vital
point which should not be missed. For NyAya *knowledge*
of the true nature of the sixteen categories is what will lead
to liberation. Most of the other pre-bhakti schools too believed
that knowledge in some form or the other is what'll fetch
liberation. So logic and the means of knowledge is very
important to them in their scheme for liberation.
But the MAdhyamaka and Advaita differ in this vital regard.
For they do not believe in the ultimate validity of knowledge
itself. None of the pramAnas can grasp reality and are invalid
at the paramArtha level. That's the basis for the two levels
of reality. NAgArjuna's and Shankra's dialectic is aimed at
destroying empirical knowledge itself. But this lower knowledge
should not be confused with the higher knowledge - Atma jnAnam
or knowledge of the Self - which is true knowledge. So unlike
the NaiyAyikas Advaitins do not seek an end in logic itself and
Shankara himself condemns those who are addicted to logic to
an endless cycle of birth and death (quite like the Buddha in
BrahmajAlasutta). Shankara says that he wouldn't be
bothering with philosophy and dialectic if they weren't too
many false views being prevalent. He wants us to give up this
theoretical philosophizing and practice Atma VichAram which is
what will lead to liberation.
So logic is for the MAdhyamikas and the Advaitins, as Chandrakirti
says, only of negative value - useful in destroying the validity
of empirical knowledge, after which it should be given up. So
even in this regard Advaita is diametrically opposed to the NyAya.
