I'm afraid I cannot provide details, because I don't have them.  But the
position of Director of the School of Oriental and African Studies is
currently under advertisement.

SOAS's phone number is +44 20 7637 2388

The current Director, Sir Timothy Lancaster, will shortly be moving to a
new post as head of an Oxford college.
