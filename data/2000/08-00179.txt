 Book Trust to bring out his "popular  book"  'From Sarasvati River to the
 Indus Script' in English and thirteen  other languages." (Sanskrit seems to

You have convinced us that Rajaram is boastful and possibly untruthful.  So
perhaps R's claim of "friends in the Indian Government" is untrue as well.

Such values are never granted from above; they are won from below.  A people
who are not willing to fight for it do not deserve it.
