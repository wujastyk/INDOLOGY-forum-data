The University of Virginia 2000 Summer Session will offer an intensive
introductory course in Literary and Spoken Tamil taught by Professor Anne
Monius (Hindu Studies) and an indigenous Tamil speaker. One of the two
classical languages of India, Tamil developed independently from Sanskrit
and is now spoken by roughly 80 million people not only in southern India
but in Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Malaysia as well.

Students will learn basic grammar and develop speaking, reading, and
writing proficiency. By the end of the summer they should be able to read
an article or short story from a modern Tamil magazine, write simple essays
and letters, and function orally in most everyday situations. The class
will watch several Tamil films as well as practice conversing with an
indigenous speaker.

Students intending to enroll in Introductory Tamil (TAML 101 & 102) must
apply directly to the Summer Session for admission. For the 2000
