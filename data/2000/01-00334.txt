Dating the Veda: Using the Horse and Planets
Dr. Kalyanaraman:

No, he always looks for *all*, divergent  expressions denoting a horse.
Misleading. Better:
Pokorny, J. Indogermanisches etymologisches Worterbuch, Bern/Munchen 1959
p. 301-302
which lists  relatives of azva (IE *ekwo-s, h1ekwo-s) from Iranian to
Keltic and Tocharian:
* in: Avestan, O. Persian, Ossetic; Greek, Thracian, Lycian; Latin,
O.Irish, O.Anglo-Saxon, O.Saxon, Gothic; Tocharian A +B --> Turkic;
* of fem. azvaa : in Avest., Lat., O.Lith.,
* of adj. azv(i)ya- in: in Avest., Greek, Lat., O. Prussian, Lithuanian.
* also in Pannonian, Illyrian, Tarentian, Epid.,  ...
It is no big news: if there is a well attested word  in virtually all IE
languages, it is the h1ekwo- the horse: Contra Rao quoted by Kalyanaraman...
