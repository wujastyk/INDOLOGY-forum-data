Bernard Sergent does claim that the churning of the ocean myth (and many
other myths besides, e.g. the birth of the human race from a pumpkin,
preserved in the patriarch's name Ikshvaku/pumpkin) comes from SE Asia.
Elsewhere in the same book, Gen?se de l'Inde, he also says that it has a
common origin with the Germanic myth of Aegir churning the ocean to produce
beer.  This seems to imply that the myth travelled all the way from the SE
to the NW of the Eurasian continent.  Maybe we should keep the unmentionable
invasion, but have it come from the SE rather than from the NW.
