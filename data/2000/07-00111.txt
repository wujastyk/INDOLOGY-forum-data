16th century European contacts with Hinduism
Oops, big, big, big mistake. It couldn't have been Parmenides who lived
slightly later than the Buddha himself and centuries before NAgArjuna.
My statement on the MAdhyamika influence on Greek philosophy was based on a
article that I read sometime back. Do not know why Parmenides came to my
mind when I tried to remember it.
Let me recheck and give the correct name.
