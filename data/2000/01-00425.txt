Subject: Gombrich on British higher education
Message-ID: <161227055585.23782.5697415793384044994.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I've just added an essay by Prof. Richard Gombrich to the "position
papers" section of the INDOLOGY website.  Richard is, of course, well
known to the indological community, so I thought this essay would be of
general interest, even though it is about British "higher" education in
general, and not indology specifically.

I would ask colleagues not to use the INDOLOGY list for the discussion of
this paper, since it is not indological.  If a discussion develops on some
other list, or between members privately, it would be nice if you let the
list know where the discussion is happening.
