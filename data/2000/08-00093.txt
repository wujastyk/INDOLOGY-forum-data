Indologist's India
I write in support of Rajesh Kochar's posting today that Indologists have
created a certain kind and type of ancient India, an Asiatic Society type of
ancient India. Those of us who read the agamas more than the nigamas, and
study folk rather than classical art, do not seem to fall into that trap.
