Subject: River Sarasvati: Atomic scientists reconfirm location

Is your web site denying the input of gurus? In the Western modern world is
not a scientist comparable to a Guru? Is not a reverence of the role of the
Guru essential in understanding the writings of India? Does only an
Indologist in academia understand India? Would it not make sense to limit
the subject matter and length rather than who contributes? Most technical
journals do this.
