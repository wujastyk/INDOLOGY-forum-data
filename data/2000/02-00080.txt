Subject: Text of a Song in Praise of Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227055797.23782.10460671529793888002.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

    In recent years I have noticed that a typical "Annual Sanskrit Day"
function in Pune begins and/or ends with a song in praise of Sanskrit. The
beginning words of the song are: pravahatAm samskRta mandAkinI...
    Can anyone on this list supply the text of this song, which I believe
was composed by Professor Kashikar? (It is not very long). On one such
occasion I suggested to the lady who sang it to make it available as an
audio casette. If it is now so available where could I buy it?
    Thanks,
