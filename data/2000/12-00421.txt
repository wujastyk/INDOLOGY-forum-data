Re. Chain letters in pre-modern India
<<Is there any evidence that it worked? Are there
other examples?>>
This frequently occurs in devotional Mahayana sutras;
i.e., claims of inestimable merits resulting from
expounding respective texts. Even the Diamond Sutra
(vajracchedika-prajna-paramita) affirms that ?those
who are able to receive, hold in mind, read, recite
and expound it widely to others will achieve
inexpressible and inconceivable merits without measure
or limit.? This has long been an impetus for vigorous
re-print and free-distribution activities particularly
among the Chinese, from ancient times to today. Spread
the word.
