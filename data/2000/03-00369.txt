historian Diodorus Siculus penned that, "From Ethiopia he (Osiris)
passed through Arabia, bordering upon the Red Sea as far as India.... He
built many cities in India, one of which he called  Nysa, willing to
have remembrance of that (Nysa) in Egypt, where he was brought up."

     Another important writer from antiquity, Apollonius of Tyana, who
is said to have visited India near the end of the first century C.E.,
was convinced that "The Ethiopians are colonists sent from India, who
follow their forefathers in matters of wisdom." The literary work of the
early Christian writer Eusebius preserves the tradition that, "In the
reign of Amenophis III [the mighty Dynasty XVIII Egyptian king] a body
of Ethiopians migrated from the country about the Indus, and settled
in the valley of the Nile." And still another document from ancient
times, the Itinerarium Alexandri, says that "India, taken as a whole,
beginning from the north and embracing what of it is subject to
Persia, is a continuation of Egypt and the Ethiopians.'
