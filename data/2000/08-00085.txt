I'd very much appreciate any information on the use of the Sanskrit term
"agnikuNDa".

Monier-Williams identifies it as "a pan with live coals" and "a hole or
enclosed space for the consecrated fire" and a Hindi dictionary  calls it
"a havan kuND", but these definitions don't say whether or not the word is
a recognised technical term for an implement or feature in the Vedic
sacrifice.
