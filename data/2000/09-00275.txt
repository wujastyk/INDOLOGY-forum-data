A steatite relief plate
On the page 188 of the Geographical Dictionary of the Ancient and Medieval
India (Author: Nundo Lal Dey, 1971, there is reference to the recent
discovery of a steatite relief showing in an artistic way the celebrated
story of Usinara(the ancient king of Zivi or Zibi)offering flesh of his
body to save the life of a dove. It is said in the book that this steatite
plate is now in the British Museum. Does any body has the knowledge of the
date of this object? N. R. Joshi.
