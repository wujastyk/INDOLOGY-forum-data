Hinduism and Colonialism
In a recent post I quoted from D. Lorenzen (1995) to the effect that
"Hindu" as a religious category was not a colonial invention.  Those
interested in a detailed analysis can now see:
Lorenzen, David N. 1999. Who Invented Hinduism? Comparative Studies in
Society and History 41, no. 4: 630-659.
