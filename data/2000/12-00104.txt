Heat and Colors
Prof. G. v. Simson wrote:
I know an instance where white is considered cool.
Tamils assign 'hot' or 'cold' to the things they encounter.
Anything new and unfamiliar is said to be 'hot':
Native doctors or shamans tell ice cream is 'hot'!
To predict the future, paper packets of red and white flowers
is tossed and one is picked up by a child. If it comes white,
it signifies cool, non-problematic result. Red means trouble.
Instead of the child making a choice, a mixture of white/red
flowers are decorated on a temple deity and the fall to
the right/left and white/red folwers is interpreted by
the priest.
In the context of Heat, white is cool and desirable and, red is hot.

N. Ganesan
