Subject: Buddhas wearing Glasses

Slightly off the main area of the list, but perhaps someone can help?

I have recently seen two reproductions of Burmese images of the Buddha
wearing glasses.  One was a colossal image, apparently in concrete, from
Shwedaung. (A man on a ladder cleaning the glasses reached only from its
forehead to its chin.)  Only the head and shoulders appeared in the
picture.  The other, perhaps not quite so large, was in the earth-touching
mudrA.  In each case the glasses were the round, gold-rimmed kind, with
plain (but slightly tinted) lenses.

In every other way, these were completely traditional Burmese images of the
Buddha.

Can anyone explain this phenomenon? Is this some kind of symbolism
connected with vision and insight, or a tribute to a respected local
teacher who wore glasses?

Thanks for any suggestions!
