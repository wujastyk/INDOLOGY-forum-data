Thank you Palaniappan, I stand corrected. Thanks too for the ref. it makes
so much sense, considering the latest theory that Janaganamana was written
by Tagore in praise of the British monarchy, rather than India, the
Motherland! Godking concept revisited!

The poem follows the CT model of a mother's utterance about her daughter's
love for the hero who is tirumAl/viSNu here. What should interest Radhika
Srinivasan is not the first line but the third line and the use of tEvil and
kOyil. Also to be considered are the etymologies of iRaivan2 and kaTavuL.
