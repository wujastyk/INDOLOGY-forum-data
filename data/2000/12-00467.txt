Thank you Palaniappan, I stand corrected. Thanks too for the ref. it makes
so much sense, considering the latest theory that Janaganamana was written
by Tagore in praise of the British monarchy, rather than India, the
Motherland! Godking concept revisited!

This is not really a Tamil eulogy to sing the praise of the king. The
correct
version of the above line is part of tiruvAymozi 4.4.8 of nammAzvAr.

tiruvuTai man2n2araik kANil tirumAlaik kaNTEn2E en2n2um
uruvuTai vaNNaGkaL kANil ulakaLantAn2 en2Ru tuLLum

The poem follows the CT model of a mother's utterance about her daughter's
love for the hero who is tirumAl/viSNu here. What should interest Radhika
Srinivasan is not the first line but the third line and the use of tEvil and
kOyil. Also to be considered are the etymologies of iRaivan2 and kaTavuL.
