theory is mentioned). From the point of view of Indo-european and
Indological studies the book is rather vague in its references and
arguments, but it does bring together interesting pieces of information
(which one would have to check in the
cited sources before trusting them and building on them).
One of the author's main conclusions is that the European pagans have strong
ties with the Persian Magi (cf. p. 806). I thought this was already known
(some early indologist, if I am not mistaken, linked the "thread" which the
Inquisition regarded as one of the signs of an accused being "pagan" with
the initiatory thread of the Zoroastrians, which in turn is related to the
thread of the Indian upanayana)
although so far no attempt was made to bring together so many relevant data
esp. from Eastern Europe and Russia.
