In techniques of praa.nayama retention of praa.na  is denoted with
kumbhaka, expulsion -- with recaka. And inhalation --puuraka--
would have been mentioned as well, but it is not.

cittaprasaadana is neuter,
vi.sayavatii (I.35) is a feminine adjective, same for jyotismatii (I.36).
It seems that there is some other noun missing.

When I experience shortness of breath, the advice to take a deep breath
is useless. When deep breath (like in pra.nayama) is an option,
zvaasa is absent already.  Matsyaasana works much better for zvaasa.
That is another, empirical, point against interpreting
pracchardana and vidhaara.na as expulsion and retention of breath.

Best regards, Dmitri.
