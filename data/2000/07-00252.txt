message from Dr. Elst
It is Friday evening, time to relax. And reading one's mail:
We must thank a surrogate of a surrogate of the busy decipheres of the
Indus script for another bit of information  (Rajaram writes that he is
rather busy with translating the remnant of the c. 4000 inscriptions).
I am shocked to see that the most obvious reading of the famous Pashupati
seal has escaped the decipherers, Dr.s Jha/Rajaram. It reads:
rimmed vessel -  simple fish - rimmed vessel with Roman ''  on top  -
pincers (with double handles?)   -   crab   -    simple (five stroke) man
deciphered  as by them as:
'any vowel'   -      z        -          dy              -       tt       -
m    -    r
Especially in conjunction with the picture on the seal, i.e. the
three-faced, crossed-legged, ithyphallic Lord of the Animals, Shiva, and
following the Jha/Rajaram method,  *plainly* reads:
             iiza  udyatto  merau!
            "The Lord, with his [ ] up,  (residing)  on Mt. Meru"
What is up here is clearly visible on the seal.
uurdhvalinga, uurdhvamanthin.
Much better than to invoke overcoming the post-Vedic, Buddhist demon Maara
(or the equally late god Kaama):  where does the Great Yogi do that, on the
seal?  He merely sits there touching himself.
                                                        ***
On second thought, another reading, one closely following Jha's
construction of compounds,  many be more appproriate:
'any vowel'   -      z        -          dy              -       tt       -
m    -    r
           aazodyattaamara(H)
          "The [aim, resesarch, etc.]  striven after  out of hope is
immmortal"
in other, though Mleccha words:
        "Hope springs eternal!"
