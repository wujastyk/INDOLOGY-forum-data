Four maTha tradition
Usually, in neo-vedanta or Sankara matha writings, we come across
the statement that Adi Sankaracharya founded  mathams in
all the four cardinal directions. How old is this tradition?
Is this only a post-Vivekananda phenomenon? Related question:
are they any written records of interactions between the
4 mathams suppposed to have been founded by Sankara, and how
far back in time those records go?
In other words, what is the oldest writing which mentions
Sankara founding 4 mutts? 19th/20th centurie, or earlier?
Thanks,
SM
