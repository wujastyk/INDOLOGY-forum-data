Hello, I am looking for some information regarding two contemporary authors
on miniaturre painting books, William George Archer, who has worked
extensively on Punjabi Painting, and M.S. Randhawa, author of Kangra
Paintings on Love, Basohi Painting and many other titles. I have not been
able to get hold of a biography of them anywhere.
Thank you,
Rosa E.Garcia-Franco
