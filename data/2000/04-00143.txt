.dombii as scavenger woman
Ven. Tantra wrote:
The association of .dom with music is well known in India. They have provided 
some good musicians in the last century. Over the centuries their
poverty seems to have restricted them to scavenging, a case of downward caste mobility.
Many medieval works refer to raagas called .dombakriti, .dombakriyaa, .dombakrii,
.dombi, and .dombikaa. A taala called .dombuli is recorded as a popular (desii) one.
A medieval history (cant recall which, right now)  also name them  as a caste making a 
living out of music.
