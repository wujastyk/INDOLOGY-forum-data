I know it is a trend in Urdu-speaking circles to dissociate Urdu from Hindi
and other Indian languages. Like the Hindutva attempt to deny the fact that
the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages belong to separate families, this
trend among Urdu-speakers is in crass violation of all sound linguistic
knowledge. The arguments against the "alternative" theory you propose are
overwhelming, and no amount of "open-mindedness" will convince Western
linguists (or for that matter any competent linguist Western or otherwise)
that Urdu is not an Indian language derived from a Prakrit, filled up with
loan-words from Arabic and Persian. What you are presenting is essentially
another politicized academic non-starter.

It should have been quite clear by now that Western scholars are not that
eager to "take orders" from governments, Indian and otherwise. (Scholars
working inside dictatorship have a different situation.) Our views are
based on scholarly work, and we don't like to be told by politicians what
we should think and say. Nor are we that naive. We do not normally
"subconsciously" accept "official versions" of this or that. The arguments
concerning the Indianness of Urdu are chrystal clear, based on grammatical
structure, vocabulary etc. No competent linguist needs to be told what to
think.

Noone on this list has mentioned such a theory. What we say, is that Urdu
has its roots in a Prakrit (not in Kharhi Boli). Are you responding to some
other hair-brained politicized theory with origins in the Hindutva
movement, or are you responding to what you perceive to be the standard
academic version of Urdu history?
This is positively wrong. Invaders do not always impose their language on
the conquered. They do so occasionally, but very often they "get lost" in
the masses of the conquered people. This happened to the Mongols that
conquered China - Kublai Khan spoke Chinese, not Mongol. This also happened
to the Norsemen who conquered Normandy: there French, not Norwegian is
spoken. What usually happens is that conquerors contribute with vocabulary
to the existing local language: just look at all the French in English,
vocabulary dumped by an invading French army that took control of England.
The same thing happened to that particular Prakrit that became Urdu.
To
Noone assumes that. Their soldiers did.
I have not seen Prof. Sachau's work, but this would only be correct if we
assume that there was a large contingent of Prakrit speakers in Ghazni. The
point is that the history of Urdu is judged on the basis of linguistic
criteria. Other criteria are secondary. There were no Prakrits in
Afghanistan as you say, consequently Urdu must have arisen in India where
related dialects are found. I will therefore assume that Prof. Sachau has
no case until I have seen a few nifty arguments from him in support of his
theory.
It is true that the first Moghuls that arrived in India, used Turkic, but
Persian was the language used by most of the Moghul courts. In a Muslim
court milieu, it is self-evident that Arabic was in use to some extent, but
Persian was the main language of culture.
