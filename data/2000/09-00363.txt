RAJARAM EPISODE - BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION
I think we are wasting a lot of time here going after Rajaram and not
making efforts in deciphering the Indus script . Rajaram possibly has done
wrong, if he intentionally tried to falsify things . It does not mean we go
on crucifying some one.
I posted on my web about the Migration of Indus People where the
decipherment by Pathak and Verma was mentioned . It was a genuine work on
decipherment . I did not see any one intending to pursue on that line.
It is an interesting problem for those linguists who take the decipherment
seriously . That work shows that Indus people went every where, not only to
South India which many think.
I believe that the Indus Valley civilization is a at the substratum of
entire India, and not any particular region.
Thanks.
