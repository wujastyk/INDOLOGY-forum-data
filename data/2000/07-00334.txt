 Edited volumes of speeches by the late Chandrashekarendrasaraswathi Swamigal
of the Kanchi Sankara Matham will contain this info. Long ago, tamil magazines
like Kalaimagal carried his Alexander as Skanda > Sikandar > (add a
prefix, al) Alexander (Greek). Don't know the English translations of
Kanchi Sankaracharya's speeches has this (eg., the Bhaatiya Vidya Bhavan
volume).
