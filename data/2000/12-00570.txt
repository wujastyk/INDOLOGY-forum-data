Thanks for the correction! I am away from my library and relied on my
memory, which did not serve me right.
This is of course the problem. Deciding exactly when transmigration became
important in India itself is indeed difficult. Early kshatriya religion
seems to have operated with a warriors' heaven not unlike the Norse
Valhalla (again, I rely on memory and solicit rebuttals). But even if we
are able to show that the belief is early, we cannot say for certain that
it migrated from India. What we need is insight into historical sources or
data that actually document the process, and such sources don't exist.
(Compare e.g. the influence of Persian religion on Judaism, where the
Babylonian exile easily explains how such an influence was possible).
Failing that, we have to look at details in transmigration beliefs in India
and Greece, and here we do not have a lot of data either. Consequently, all
we can say is that belief in transmigration occurs among several
Indo-European peoples, but only becomes predominant in India. Theories of
migration have to be treated cautiously.
