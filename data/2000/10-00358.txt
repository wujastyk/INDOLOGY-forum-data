The standard model is not based on racism, but on the dispassionate

I think you are confusing scholarship with football.  In scholarship it is
okay to be wrong!  (Thank goodness!)  In fact, from a certain point of
view all serious scholars are wrong all the time. The search for academic
truth is a process of approximation.
This is lame conspiracist thinking.  First, you would be hard put to it to
demonstrate to dispassionate scholarship that the great translators have
really made widespread systematic and deliberate errors in their work,
i.e., errors beyond the bell-shaped curve that everyone has to live with.
Second, it would be impossible to establish to dispassionate scholarship
that any particular selection of translation errors was part of a
conspiracy of European scholars.
