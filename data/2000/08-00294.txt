Reviewers , well versed in Upanisads,  needed
Dr. SMS Chari has written a new book - "Philosophy of the Upanisads, a
comparitive assessment based on the bhasyas of Samkara, Ramanuja & Madhva".
Dr. Chari is a seasoned "Vedanta Expert" with 5 or 6 books ( in English)  to
his credit.  He has studied under traditional scholars in India and is
active in Vedanta for the last 60 or so years.  His previous book was
"Philosophy of the Brahmasutras - a comparitive assessment based on the
bhasyas of Samkara, Ramanuja & Madhva
He wanted a few reviewers for his current book.
I would appreciate if anyone can suggest experts who have studied different
commentaries on the Upanisads to review this book. The book is written in
English.  I had a chance to look into this book myself.  I did study under
him while he was preparing these two books.  I feel that it is a book that
is "one of its kind".
