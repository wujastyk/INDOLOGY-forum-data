Because today we know better, or at least should know better. There is no
reason to go on repeating the atrocities of former centuries. The fact that the
forefathers of group X committed atrocities against the forefathers of group Y
does not give group Y the right to commit atrocities or unjustice against the
members of group X TODAY. If we accept that idea, things never stop, do they? I
don't ask people to forget and forgive, only to be pragmatic: Brutality and
injustice will go on repeating itself indefinitely if we don't call a stop here
and now. Muslims living today are not responsible for the crimes committed by
past Muslim princes.  Consequently, the victimization of Muslims for those very
reasons that we see in some quarters is not only immoral and unjust, it is
stupid. That is not tantamount to saying that Muslims never do/did anything
wrong. Muslim wrongs should be addessed just like Hindu wrongs, but within the
framework of a constitutional state founded on legal protection. The ultimate
consequences of a civil moral based on the principle of revenge (which is
really at the bottom of you argument) can be seen vividly in the former
Yugoslavia. You may turn a place into a desert and call it peace. But you can
also turn a place into a heap of dung and call it justice.
