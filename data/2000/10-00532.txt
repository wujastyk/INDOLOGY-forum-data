Those questioning the impact of Hindutva views of history on
Indology should look at this story in the 28 October (Saturday)
issue of The Times of India. The story discusses the
controversial new Harappan Gallery in the National Museum in New
Delhi. Much more will be published on this story in other
publications in the next few weeks.

Note the ringing endorsement of the new exhibit by N.S. Rajaram.
