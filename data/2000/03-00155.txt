Elst's review of Kochhar's Vedic People
PKM> Equus sivalensis may be gone but domesticated horses with sivalensis
dentition, pre-orbital depression and 17 pairs of ribs are still found
in South and Southeast Asia.
RB> Unlike the case for cattle there is no evidence for horse domesication
in the sub continent. If sivalensis was extinct how did such features
survive. Did some wild horses in central asia  also have sivalensis traits?
Are there any surviving wild equids which have sivalensis traits?
PKM> Interestingly, practically everywhere one finds domesticated Bos
Indicus
one also finds domesticated Bus bubalis (water buffalo).
RB> Any signs of bubalis in the near east? I believe that the swamp and
river buffalos cannot inter breed. When were the swamp buffaloes of south
east asia domesticated? How old is the tradition of associating yama with a
buffalo. Any refrences to buffaloes in the rig veda?
regards RB
