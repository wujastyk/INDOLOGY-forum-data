You are right. The word vedi has relationship to the verb "to know".
Kindly look up RV I-164-39, read with I-164-35 and contemplate what do
those mantras say.
I do not think the etymology given by Dr. Witzel  (from veda  = grass)
applies to the word vedi as used in rituals. "barhi" has entirely
different meaning from "sacred grass".
