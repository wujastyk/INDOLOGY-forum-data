Regarding the Ven Tantra's links to Gorakhnath texts,

I think the Gorak Bodh is one of the texts in Gorakh Bani edited by P. D.
Barthwal (without comparing the text)

Does anybody know if any more of the old Hindi works of Gorakhnath have been
translated into English?

I heard back in the 80s of somebody translating them but am not aware of any
publications
