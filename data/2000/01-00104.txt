Typographical error in the Bhagavad-Gita?
If the verse in question is actually read, this question does not arise at
all -- at least not as long as we stay within the soteriological framework
of the Bhagavadgita. Women are assured of liberation (paraa.m gatim) on the
condition that they take refuge (vyapaazritya) in Krishna.
Brahmin/kshatriya men are not promised liberation on any different terms;
the process is merely considered easier for them (ki.m punar braahma.naa.h,
etc).
