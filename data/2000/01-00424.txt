gifts for Sanskrit teachers
teachers
As I understand, the purpose of scriptural studies is not to get passing
grade but to achieve self transformation and self awakening.  Therefore,
Karma yoga ( such as taking teacher's cows to graze,or wash his laundry)  is
one of the paths for people who are incapable of study - due to many
circumstances such as lack of time,  or other reasons.
