Yes. tozu and toRu both mean 'cattle shed'.
Once George Hart pointed to the same word from
Bronze age Minoan Crete to South India
the same: "taurus" and tamil "toRu/tozu".
Perhaps Fr. Heras in Proto-mediterranean culture, v.1.
Today, I saw Ven. Tantra mentioning
"an immense Aegeo-Afrasiatic territory".

It is agreed by scholars Krishna fighting
the seven bulls comes from Tamil.
Erik Af Edholm and C. Suneson, The seven bulls and
Krsna's marriage to Nila/Nappinnai in Sanskrit and Tamil literature,
Temenos, v.8, p.29-53, 1972.

Ulrike Niklas is publishing a tamil oral epic
on bull fighting and F. Gros has done a translation
of vATivAcal, a fine novel by C. S. Chellappa.
