I think this is probably true.  But perhaps some Indian scholars also do
not appreciate how hurtful it is when our motives for studying the subject
are maligned.  I believe that most of us took up the subject from a deep
love and respect for the cultures of South Asia, often in the face of
opposition and hardship, and (in the case of the older generation, at
least) against the prevailing values of our societies at the time.
Studying Indology is not a route to fame or fortune!  So let us argue with
one another's ideas, but not attack one another's sincerity.
