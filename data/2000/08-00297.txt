May I make a suggestion?Do not read between the lines. Just read the lines.
Whether a person is serious or not,whether he is making a political move is
his problem.Look at the positive side. Even if a person has a political move
in mind,it is encouraging that he is seeking  legitimacy through
intellectual activity. Fight him on the firm ground of legitimacy  not on
the marsh lald of motive.
