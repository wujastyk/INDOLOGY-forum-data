Skt pronunciation (Was: Sanskrit Spelling)
For an excellent account of the regional differences in Sanskrit
pronunciation, see the S.K. Chatterji article in the Pathak Memorial
Volume(BORI, c. 1930's). In this article, Chatterji provides phonetic
transcriptions (near IPA) of the BhagavadgItA verse "dharmakSetre..." as
pronounced by boys from Calcutta, Varanasi (Maharashtrian),
Tamil Nad, Kerala.
If interested, I will provide an exact reference.

"You couldn't fool your mother on the most foolingist day
of your life, even if you had an electrified fooling machine. "
