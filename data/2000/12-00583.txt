Subject: PASUPATHI SEAL IN MOHENJODARO
Message-ID: <161227066012.23782.16348756137720647268.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

DEAR FRIENDS,
I invite your opinions regarding the pasupathi seal
discovered in Mohenjodaro.The seal contained the
figure of a man in yogic posture(siddhasana), with
animals around him(tiger, rhino, elephant etc.).hewas
wearing a head dress with three horns.

Sir Mortimer Wheeler identified him as Pasupathi, the
Proto Siva for the following reasons:
1.Lord Siva is termed as Pasupathi in Aagamas.
2.The head dress resembles Trident of Lord Siva.
3. The man is in Yogic Posture and Lord Siva is a Yogi
and he will be  meditating in Yogic Posture on Mount
Kailasa.

My question is,
 "Is he really Proto Siva??".

If we study  the other seals of Harappan Civilisation
we find that all the figures on the seals who are
identified as gods or goddesses have the head dress
with three horns.
the head dress of Mother Goddess (clay figures) if we
see from front it appears with three horns.
The concept of Pasupathi was developed later in
Aagamas and it in not an ancient concept.For example
in Rgveda the God Rudra is not associated with Pasus
(animals).
With best wishes
girish
