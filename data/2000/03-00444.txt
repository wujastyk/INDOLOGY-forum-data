While it is true that rice is not specifically mentioned in the Vedic
version, there is a bit of interesting information in these passages:


      1.162.18 The axe penetrates the thirty-four ribs
      of the swift horse; the beloved of the gods, (the
      immolators), cut up (the horse) with skill, so
      that the limbs may be unperforated, and
      recapitulating joint by joint.

      (from Wilson)

Now, 17 X 2 = 34.

(Other breeds have 18 pairs, Arabian has 19 pairs).

Those amazing flying rishis and their genetic engineering marvels!
