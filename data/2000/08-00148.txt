Subject: Hindu names for Kashmiri Muslims (Was: Nehru-Gandhi dynasty)
Message-ID: <161227060864.23782.3104940016464106256.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The idea that the Nehrus were Muslims seems pretty absurd to me, but I
want to take issue with one contention:

<<A Muslim cannot have the surname `Gandhi' or `Nehru', they are
definitely forbidden. It would have to be changed to Shaikh
on conversion.>>

Whether it's forbidden or not, I have met or read of Kashmiri Muslims
with what one would usually consider Hindu family names, such as Bhat,
or even Shaiva.  Whether their families were recent converts or not I
would not know.
