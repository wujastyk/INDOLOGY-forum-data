Indo-Aryan words in Hurrian
To continue our interesting discussion on the Mit(t)an(n)i:
Some early IA immigrants may be recorded in a tablet of the Dynasty of
Agade, at the end of the third millennium BCE:  A-ri-si( <sa')-en  =
Arisaina and Sa-um-si( < sa')-en = Saumasena, which Harmatta  (1992: 374)
takes as a sign of  early Indo-Aryan spread towards Mesopotamia at c.
2300-2100 BCE.
This & the spelling is from Harmatta who deals with IIr materials (in :
Dani, A. H. and V. M. Masson (eds.), History of civilisations of Central
Asia, Vol. I. The dawn of civilisation: earliest times to 700 BCE. Paris
1992; Harmatta's paper is not reliable, has many wrong dates and forms), an
earlier version of it has been used, more or less uncritically, by the late
SS Mira (Aryan Problem 1992).
Bjarte, any comments?
Bjarte, please let us know more whne you have more materials...
Rajesh Kocchar asks:
Forms that are older than Rgvedic, as in Mitanni: IE  g'h >  Indo-Iranian
j'h > pre-Rgvedic z'h > RV h :
In other words, there is a definite time difference between the two OIA
dialects, Rgvedic and Mitanni-IA. How much is the question. See below.

Steve Farmer:
I reread that paper and you are right: 900 (or maybe 1000) BC; in addition,
the important point to note, (as you say later on), is that the dates vary
for the various parts of S. Asia:
Gandhara 900/1000 BCE
PGW  900/1000
Pirak, Baluchistan 900 (1300??)
S.Indian Megaliths: Hallur 1100  (such early Deccan dates had led
Chakrabarti to surmise an origin of the N. Indian iron age in the Vindhyas
(Bihar)
Note also early Kashmir and W.Bengal materials
N. Ganesan correctly concluded:
(just substitute 'first collection' for "redaction", which is later: in the
late Brahmana period, and in N.Bihar, by Sakalya)

Trouble is that the only horse trainer we know of is teh Hurrite Kikkuli
(and that as an expatriate at the Hittite court). Latest news:

which has been answered by S. Farmer:
deals with weaponry, which is where iron made its first major
cultural impact ...

LC:
3. it is important to note that iron probably did not have
significant advantages over bronze initially.
For this point, on which S Farmer has touched as well, better to read
Possehl & Gullapalli: (Meteoric) iron was treasured, even in the Bronze
age, for its hardness. and used appropriately.
LC.
4. Without the Mitanni evidence I would see no conclusive evidence to
_prove_ a date earlier than the eighth century. With it an earlier
date does seem likely. But, given that, one feels that a thorough
reexamination of the Mitanni material is overdue.

Steve Farmer:
that period. Now it appears that iron came at a much later date to South
Asia -- with important regional differences complicating things further...
It doesn't *prove* the case for later dates of the RV, but it certainly
makes the case far more likely. .... <<
Since we cannot cram everything into just one email, and Dominik will
protest, here an addition to my earlier post:
The RV matter is of course based on the (always weak) argumentum ex nihilo.
It is complicated /enhanced by  the fact that RV asi 'sword' = Latin ensis
'sword'; both per Thieme 1958  from 'black' (metal), see Mayrhofer, Etym
Dict. 1986- , vol.II 154.
And asi first occurs first in the late RV books 1 and 10.  In short, if
correct, the late RV may have the first occurence of iron.
Which brings its late stratum (before collection, "samhita", as distinct
from te much later redaction) down, close to 1000 BCE (instead of 1200 BCE)
again).
Importantly, in the immediate post-RV Samhitas (AV, YV) iron is firmly
established as 'black metal'. They overlap nicely, in time and geographical
extent, with the Painted Gray Ware culture of Haryana, UP, Chambal area,
see MW, Tracing the Vedic dialects. In: C. Caillat (ed.), Dialectes dans
les litt?ratures indo-aryennes. Paris : 1989, 97-264
