Hello Colleagues,

I am trying to put together some bibliography which would provide as
comprehensive as possible an overview of the mythology and symbolism of
the God Indra--from the Vedas through Puranas, tantrism, philosophical
systems, politics, speculations about Indra and indriyas, etc.  This is
a huge field from a rather oblique angle.  I would be grateful for any
suggestions.

Best regards,
