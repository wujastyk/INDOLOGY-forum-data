a question for the traditionalists among us
Concerning Steve Brown's question:
guru?
And Chris Beetle's response:
This verse, of course, is not about how to find a Hindu spiritual guru in
general.  It is, rather, a sectarain VaiSNava statement.  The Padma Purana
is a VaiSNava Purana, and a very sectarian one at that: it fiercely
condemns non VaiSNava Hindus of several traditions.
It all depends on what Steve Brown is looking for, a guru within a specific
sectarian branch of Hinduism, or a more open spiritual teacher that accepts
different branches of Hinduism.
