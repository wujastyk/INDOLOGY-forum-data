new Indology list
This post is in bad taste, unfair and insuling to list members of whatever
nationality.
If anybody is found making racist remarks, it must be confronted on the spot
instead of making wild generalizations and accusations which lead us
nowhere.
I have not found anyone making remarks which can be explicitely be construed
as racist.
