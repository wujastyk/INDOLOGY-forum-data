R: Musical trees and rivers?
Dearest Colleague, it is a very interesting query. I am not expert in Indian
music (I study and translate Classical kavya, alamkarasastra and so on), but
I have discussed the problem with my husband, who teaches "musical
composition" in the Musical Academy of Parma (Italy).
Taking apart the possibility that nadi and vanaspati (wooden drum?) can be
only a poetical allusion to the "songs" of a grove with a river (many, many
times I have read that this "natural music" accompany - for example - a
woman in love and god Kama), You can think about an instrument similar to
the Western glasharmonika or aeliphon.
