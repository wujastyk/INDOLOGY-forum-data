Kabir For Hindu Temple Library?

Kabir is not taken as a Hindu, but is highly respected as a saint
by all Hindus.  Kabir was a part of core literature while we were
in school in India.  To state Kabir is despised by Hindus would be
a great distortion.
I come from Puri in India.  Among the prayers offered to the deities
is one composed by a Musilm mystic.  Hindus know that Salabega was
Muslim, but they also know he was a more sincere devotee than many
of them.
The answer is a resounding "yes".
Everyone accepts Kabir's teachings.  As I said above Hindus have
accepted and continue to accept prophets from all religions.
None of the Kabir's work will raise eyebrows anywhere.
Kabir is a precursor to Nanak.  God does not sit in
temples or mosques.  God is in us and God is in a name.
It's our conduct that makes us good, not where we are born.
Kabir has to be read by all.
I visited Kabir's house in Varanasi in 1992.  It's in the muslim
area and normally the area is tense.  Transports won't go.
I walked and was greeted with extremely friendly Muslim people.
Previous day I had been to Tulasi Ghat on the banks.  I had
the simlar awe in both locations.
