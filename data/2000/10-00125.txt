=?utf-8?Q?2_Pata=C3=B1jalis?=
Dear Dmitri,
There's a summary of this issue in:
Whicher, Ian _Integrity of the Yoga Dar'sana_, Albany: State
University of New York Press, 1998
In chapter 2 Whicher gives a few of the classic positions on this
issue (w/bibliographic info).  He believes that the consensus is on
the side of two Pata?jali figures.
You might also want to check out the interesting article of
Bronkhorst on Pata?jali--
Bronkhorst, Johannes "Pata?jali and the Yoga Suutras," in Studien zur
Indologie und Iranistik, Heft 10, 1985, 191-212 (in english)
Bronkhorst has some interesting suggestions about who "Vyaasa" was as
well--i.e. that he may well have been "the" Pata?jali, or that
Vindhyaavasin might have been Vyaasa...
Hope that's useful!
Stuart
