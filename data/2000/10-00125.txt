Dear Dmitri,

There's a summary of this issue in:

Whicher, Ian _Integrity of the Yoga Dar'sana_, Albany: State
University of New York Press, 1998

In chapter 2 Whicher gives a few of the classic positions on this
issue (w/bibliographic info).  He believes that the consensus is on
the side of two Pata?jali figures.

You might also want to check out the interesting article of
Bronkhorst on Pata?jali--

Bronkhorst, Johannes "Pata?jali and the Yoga Suutras," in Studien zur
Indologie und Iranistik, Heft 10, 1985, 191-212 (in english)

Bronkhorst has some interesting suggestions about who "Vyaasa" was as
well--i.e. that he may well have been "the" Pata?jali, or that
Vindhyaavasin might have been Vyaasa...

Hope that's useful!

Stuart
