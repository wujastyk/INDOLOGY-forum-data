Thanks for pointing that out.

Anyway I had forgotten to mention idam/adas demonstrative pair.

from the famour verse:
"Om pUrNamadaH pUrNamidam ..."

--------
idam
.. this , this here , referring to something near the speaker ; known , present
; (opposed to %{adas}


ada4s
          nom. mf... (opposed to %{ida4m} q.v.) , that , a certain , (%{adas})
ind. thus , so , there.
