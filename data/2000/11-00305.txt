Thanks for pointing that out.
Anyway I had forgotten to mention idam/adas demonstrative pair.
from the famour verse:
"Om pUrNamadaH pUrNamidam ..."
idam
.. this , this here , referring to something near the speaker ; known , present
; (opposed to %{adas}
ada4s
          nom. mf... (opposed to %{ida4m} q.v.) , that , a certain , (%{adas})
ind. thus , so , there.
