I don't think we can use the last two passages you quote as evidence
for the new moon day at the beginning of the battle. The poet here just
collects all kind of sinister omens: meteors, hurricanes, earthquakes
and all kind of queer movements of the planets - if you try to take
this astronomically seriously, you will see that it doesn't work. This
is not on the same level as the first quote (V.140.18).
Best regards,
