Yes, it is really an eye-opener when comparing prices of Indian
editions of books with Western editions.  But to put it into context,
perhaps one should go and live in India on Indian salary levels --
then those prices will not seem so cheap !  Though Indian booksellers
are no doubt happy that us Western scholars buy their books, I get a
feeling that an element of neo-colonial exploitation is at work.
What I would be more concerned about is the fact that the kind of
academic publishers mentioned (Brill, Curzon etc)  usually pay no
advances to the poor author -- OK if you have a tenured academic job
but not if you are an independent scholar. More exploitation ?

Best wishes,
