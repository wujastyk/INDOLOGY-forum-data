What a wonderful idea!  Thank you for adding this supplement to the CSX+
font.
I'm sorry, but I missed your earlier announcement.   I hope it is not too
late to
add these 16 characters:

For rendering Bengali transliteration:

a-candrabindu
a-macron-candrabindu
e-candrabindu
i-chandrabindu
i-macron-candrabindu
o-candrabindu
u-candrabindu
u-macron-candrabindu

and their capitalized versions

A-candrabindu
A-macron-candrabindu
E-candrabindu
I-chandrabindu
I-macron-candrabindu
O-candrabindu
U-candrabindu
U-macron-candrabindu

Many, many thanks.  -- Rachel McDermott
