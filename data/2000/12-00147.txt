Namaskar and Vanakkam,

I also fully agree with Sri Vidyasanakar's

knowledgeable people should still be discussing such
obsolete ideas as the one that attempts to interpret
Vedas on the lines of racist thinking which is just
another way of clinging on to thoroughly discredited
Aryan Invasion Theory.
