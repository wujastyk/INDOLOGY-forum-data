Beyond jokes:
I *have* frequently said that the concept was anachronistic. But
I also disagree with your new point.  When someone (Sethna, not
you) does try to "prove the presence of chariots" in the Indus
Valley, and his *only* evidence consists in Harappan signs, he
better show us the elliptical and pointy signs with
cross-hatching on them -- and not draw round "wheels" when the
originals clearly aren't round.
Fully understood!
