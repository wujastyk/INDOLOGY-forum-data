Buddhist rules for text copying
Dear List Members,
I am looking for any discussion (primary or secondary) of Buddhist monastic
rules concerning the copying of texts in India. Which texts get copied, who
copies them, is there priority given to certain texts over others, etc. I am
especially interested in Mahasamghika material, although other material
would be useful as well.
Thanks
