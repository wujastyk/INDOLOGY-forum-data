Here we go again!  You have to distinguish between religious fanatics
and traditional scholars.  That Mahabharata had anything to do with
mythical Ganesha is religion.  That its writer was Vyasa is
admiration of scholarship.  To identify who was vyasa or how many vyasas
existed can be modern.  Material may exist and we don't know yet.
There is a tacit recognition in Indian literature that extreme
creativity has to be attributed to "external" empowerment.  Here
we come to mind-brain complex.  Since none of us has been as
creative as the writers of classical texts, we cannot honestly
fathom if Ganesha or Kali was involved.  Scriptural writing is
very different than scientific writing.  The imagination in
scriptures is fanciful and occasionally extra-human.  That men/women
were able to write such material makes you think of extra attributes.
Do try to write a five page poem and post!  Then empirically
examine the efforts involved..
