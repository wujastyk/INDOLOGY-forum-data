Subject: Central (Eur)Asian Studies - community building efforts...



Central (Eur)Asian studies has long been a field that is fragmented and
underdeveloped, with its feet widely spread between Islamic/Middle Eastern
studies, East Asian studies and Slavic/Soviet studies.  We're trying to
counteract this in a variety of ways, and as someone interested in "Central
Eurasia," we thought you might be interested in some information about this.
(If we have mistakenly identified you as someone interested in Central
Eurasia, you might let us know, but don't feel that you have to, as this
message is a one-time mailing and is not from an automatic mailing list).

So our goal is to promote as wide involvement in these activities as
possible.  Please consider joining/contributing to...

* 1 *

Central Eurasian Studies Society -- This newly formed organization is
devoted to promoting communication and improvement of scholarship in all
fields of the humanities and social sciences pertaining to the region from
the Crimea and the Caucasus in the west to Mongolia and Tibet in the east
(including such places as: Iranian Azerbaijan, Volga Basin, Afghanistan,
Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Xinjiang, Tuva, Buryatia, etc.)
  - General information about the organization may be found at the CESS
    Website: <http://cess.uno.edu>.
  - The first annual meeting will be held this fall in Madison, Wisconsin --
    information about this will soon be available on the CESS Website.
  - CESS will produce a bulletin, available on the Website and in print format.
  - Interested persons world wide are welcome to join and get involved -- and
    for scholars from the former Soviet Union, membership is free.

the Directory, visit the same site to submit your information.

* 6 *

Dissertations in Central Asian Studies -- To provide easy access to
information about "up and coming" scholars in Central Asian studies, the
Dissertations site provides indexed information on recent dissertations
(within the last ~8 years) in all fields.  This resource helps conference
organizers and editors find contributors, and helps young scholars see what
work is being done already to help determine where they can make their own
contributions.  Visit <http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~casww/CASWW_Diss.html> to
see the hundreds of dissertations already included, or to submit the
information on your dissertation or those of others in your department.

These are just a few of the initiatives that are under way to try to build
communications and strong community and high intellectual standards among
those focused on this part of the world.

Please consider this also an invitation to join in collaboration and to let
us know about similar projects that you are involved in.

If it seems too much to absorb all at once, then you might just join CESS or
subscribe to CentralAsia-L, and this will open the door so that you can
learn about other resources in time...

Thank you for your interest!
