Date of Jyotisa Vedanga
  The equinox in KRttikA (3rd mill. BCE) is discussed in
Parpola's book well. The later tamil texts, MaNimEkalai (5th cent.?)
and TEvAram (7th century) also state that KRttikA is the first
nakshatram just as in Krishna YV. No one argues for dating T. or M.
in 3rd millennium BCE!
We go straight from c. 1 B.C. to c. 1 A.D. No 0 B.C/A.D in between.
Then 2000 A.D. is 20th century.
