Fw:      The Buddha's withdrawal into Parinirvana
Dear collegues,
    I am afraid that political emotions aroused by the "Horseplay in
Harappa" led us probably a bit too far so that sometimes we fail to responce
to questions having purely Indological (and not political in any way)
significance. In particular, to my great disappointment, nobody gave as yet
an answer to a very interesting question put by Vladimir Shelkovich. Being
myself very much interested in knowing an answer, I would ask specialists in
Buddhism, Yoga, Anthrolology and other disciplines to reconsider the
question. The way of Buddha's withdrawal into Parinirvana meant a revolution
both in the yoga technique and in religious [psycho-]cosmology. That is why
the question seems to me so important.
    Or maybe the specialists in these subjects have already left the list,
except those of us who continue to participate in polemics over Rajaram's
little pranks or the question what Indian language is more classical than
others?
 Best regards
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
