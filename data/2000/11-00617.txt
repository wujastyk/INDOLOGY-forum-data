Indian Edition: Prof. Parpola's book
I just heard from Prof. A. Parpola that there is
a new Indian edition oh his book, Deciphering the Indus script.
The price is reasonable, sells at Re. 895.
A short new preface to bring it a bit "uptodate".
The ISBN is 0-521-79566-4, and the book is available at the
Delhi office of the CUP:
Cambridge University Press India,  2 / 19 Ansari Road,
Darya Ganj, New Delhi 110 002 India,
phone +91-11-328 85 33, 327 41 96, fax
328 85 34,  e-mail: cup at cupind.com
