G. Fussman in "Atlas Linguistique des parlers dardes et Kafirs"
gives distribution of words in the kafir valleys. His maps
suggest that Sanskrit words are most preserved among the Kalash.
This is even though the Kalash who lived at the edge of  Kafiristan
have been exposed to outsiders a lot more. The center of the Kafir
cuture was in, I think, the Prasun valley where a  magnificent
temple to Imra stood in George Robertson's time.
The Kafir languages vary quite a bit from valley to valley.
