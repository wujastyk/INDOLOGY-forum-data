SV: Arguing techniques
L.M. Fosse wrote
I remember an afternoon spent in a cafe during the Sanskrit Conference in
Leiden (1987). The company included one Sikh and one half-Bengali and I was
able to hear a number of Sikh and Bengali jokes. The habit of making jokes
about neighbours seems to be rather universal and the stereotypic ideas
supported by these jokes have often very little to do with the reality. I
do not like much the Norwegian jokes about Finns I have heard (they tell
such in Estonia, too), but certainly the Finnish jokes about the Swedes or
Russians are not better.
