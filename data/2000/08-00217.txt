Maybe so, but was Athenian democracy in 200 BCE similar to
British or American democracy 22 centuries later? And were
these ballot-casting traditions around when the Cola empire
was expanding overseas?

Well, there are people who read socialism and/or communism
into the philosophical stance that everything is the one
Brahman, from the god brahmA to a blade of grass. But was
that the intention of the original texts and authors?

That again is the stuff of myth, of which there is plenty,
from all over India, and about different people at different
times. To read democratization in the modern sense into these
stories is still revisionistic, wouldn't you say?
