Need infor. on Kavadi and other Indian body piercing rituals (FWD)
Hello there:
I am doing a film for the Discovery Channel on various religious practices
involving the body and am interested in the rituals done in Tamil
Nadu or elsewhere in India involving piercing the flesh or kaavadi bearing. I
want to know how I could find out more. I have had a hard time getting
information on this. Thanks
My e mail is Terni at aol.com
Thanks in advance for any tips.
