Subject: Finding books : a librarian's hint
Message-ID: <161227062187.23782.6934777244058233406.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

May I suggest to people on the list that they can usually go to their
college library and search OCLC and RLIN, gigantic online union
catalogs now rapidly expanding from North America to Europe and Japan,
to find where copies of the books they want are?  Indeed access to
these can be found at some public libraries as well.
