The identification of Aryans versus Dravidians is primarily based on
linguistic criteria, and is scientifically warranted. The fact that the
Vedas don't mention the Dravidians is immaterial. Who the dasyus were, is a
different question. They may have been any number of peoples present in the
North of India at this period, including other Aryans. Not to mention the
fact that some of them were demons.

In scholarly exchanges, the race of the scholar is not supposed to matter.
What matters, however, is scholarly method and approach. I suggest that we
leave "race" out of it. Cultural prejudices, however, do matter, and there
is ample evidence of such both among white and black scholars (as well as
yellow ones, too, I would assume). Europeans have been accused of being
"Eurocentric", and Edward Said has criticized "Orientalism". Such critical
approaches are academically legitimate, irrespective of whether the crit
ique is valid or not.
