Arka- the Sun/Calotropis Gigantea
Dear Indology Members,
Bhagavad Purana mentions 'arka' to be 'belonging to or relating to Sun' and
for that reason Karna is called 'arki'.Varaha-mihira's Brihajjataka explains
'arka' as 'coming from the plant Calotropis Gigantea (erukku/erukkalai in
Tamil).
Could any one kindly clarify as to whether there is any occurance of term
arka in association with either the Sun or Calotropis Gigantea in Vedic
Literature?
Thanking You all
Regards,
R.Balakrishnan
