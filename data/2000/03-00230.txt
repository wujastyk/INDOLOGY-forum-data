JambUdvIpaSaMgrahaNI
Dear members of the list,
Currently I am working on Haribhadra SUri's JambUdvIpaSaMgrahaNI, a Jain
text on geography. I am looking for an edition of the JDS, published by
Bhimsi Manek (bhImasiMh MANakanI) in Bombay; 1908. I found this reference
in the Jina-Ratna-KoSh. Can anyone give me more details about this edition
and, if possible, tell me were I can find it? I heard that it is
republished in 1985.
Thanks in advance.
