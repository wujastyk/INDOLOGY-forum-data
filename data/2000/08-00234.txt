Migration of Indus Valley People
Hello Prof. Sharan,
I'm wondering if you have images of the signs used by the Santals
themselves.  Also, if you have the values of the other signs, I would
really like to see them as I don't have access to the main reference in
your work.
Regards,
Paul Kekai Manansala
