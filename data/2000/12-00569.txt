   Although Indology will always have to do its job, the
conspicuously immanent truth remains that the real " double truth " always
was and will forever be
that there are two lines which should run somehow parallel to each other,one
openning the way for the other: the line of knowledge and that of Being (
despite its epistemological or metaphysical ultimate denyal ).But for the
hand be able to clap alone that of Being is undoubtely the very one which
counts.
   Vij?Ana and Praj?A. Would that be possible to ontologise these terms
in order to adequate things?
