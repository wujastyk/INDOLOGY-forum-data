Still all and all,
   Although Indology will always have to do its job, the
conspicuously immanent truth remains that the real " double truth " always
was and will forever be
that there are two lines which should run somehow parallel to each other,one
openning the way for the other: the line of knowledge and that of Being (
despite its epistemological or metaphysical ultimate denyal ).But for the
hand be able to clap alone that of Being is undoubtely the very one which
counts.
