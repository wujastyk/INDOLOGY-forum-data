Subject: taqdiir kaa sikandar
Message-ID: <161227060178.23782.15964259392021095525.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Both Hindus and Muslims have been using Sikandar as a "Christian " name:
Sikandar Lal, Sikandar Bakht.There is a "popular" saying: gaya  jab sikandar
duniya se dono haath khali the.This means that when Sikandar died both his
hands were empty. ( Futility of ambition)Sikandar  by his campaigns
introduced the cocept of empire into India. Interestingly, the Indian word
for Greek, Yunani, predates Alexander, who was a Macedonian. Northwest
India's introduction to Greeks came during the Persian Achaemenid times when
Ionians were brougt over, as punishment for revolt or for their  safety.
