Skepticism in Indian philosophy
Dear Indology members!
1. Were there in past (before 17th century) any schools of philosophical
scepticism in India?
2. Is there anything in Indian phylosophical thought similar to systematic
doubt techniques of Pyrrho, Socrates or Descartes?
I'd appreciate any references to translations into English of original
manuscripts.
Best regards, Dmitri.
