BUT, HE DID NOT TELL US WHERE IT COMES FROM. See below!

(this was written this morning. I now see that some info on the sword web
site has been supplied in the meantime. Nevertheless:)

WELL,  the "populace" here clearly is located in TEXAS (below!), so which
"uneducated politicians" are they complaining about?

""               Welcome to Sword of Truth, a weekly online magazine which

                  controversy (Part 3)
                  While the second Ayodhya dispute is entirely a recent
concoction with no historical
                  basis, for the Aligarh school of Muslim scholars it has
been a godsend. These men
                  whose ideas and actions had been responsible for the
holocaust of the Partition were
                  now gifted an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves
under the Marxist shelter. --

(2)  Now that we are at it,  the "Hindu Vivek Kendra" site, out of Bombay I
thought, but surprise, surprise:

http://hvk.org/hvk/

""The ideology of Hindutva is becoming popular because there is a growing
realization that everything else that has been tried to inculcate a
national spirit, has failed to yield the desired results. ...
      ... an essentially negative picture of Hindutva. It is therefore
necessary to give the theoretical basis of the Hindutva movement due
publicity.
      In one of his recent books, a Eurpean scholar, Dr. Koenraad Elst
says, "... As long as there is no intellectual mobilization, Hindu society
is badly on the defensive.... The intellectual dimension for the success of
a cultural and political movement is highly indispensable."
      The "Hindu Vivek Kendra" has been established as a resource center,
with this objective in mind. We hope it will become one of Hindutva's
"nerve centers" both in India and abroad.   ""
