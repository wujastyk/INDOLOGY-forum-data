Oedipus in Sanskrit?
 I must confess that it is a bit startling to see that people interested in
this topic seem to be somewhat unaware of what has been published on it.
In any case three of my earlier articles in this area are:
"Fathers, Sons, and Gurus:  Oedipal Conflict in the Sanskrit Epics."
Journal of Indian Philosophy. Vol.6, 1978, pp. 325-92.
"Matricide, Renunciation, and Compensation in the Legends of Two Warrior
Heroes of the Sanskrit Epics," in Proceedings of the Stockholm Conference
Seminar in Indological Studies.  Indologica Taurinensia Vol 10, 1982, pp.
117-31.
"Transsexualism, Gender and Anxiety in Traditional India."  Journal of the
American Oriental Society. Vol.113,. no. 3. 1993 pp. 374-401.
I would also suggest that people have a look at Obeyesekere's interesting
"The Work of Culture" U. of Chicago Press 1990 especially  Lectures Two and
Three, "Oedipus: The Paradigm and its Hindu Rebirth" (pp.71-139) and "The
Parricide in Buddhist History" (pp. 143-214) and, for a recent collection
of psychoanalytically oriented studies of Indian culture, "Vishnu on
Freud's Desk" Edited by J. Kripal and T. G. Vaidyanathan, OUP ( Delhi) 1999.
I too of course look forward  to the forthcoming pieces mentioned by Silk
and Reusch. I will be especially interested to see how the study of
Buddhist texts "disprove" findings made ( largely but not entirely) on
non-Buddhist sources.
