Not that I know of. The Viswakarmas are another interesting group
of unclear position in the caste system: while they are thought of
plainly as a collective of five groups of craftsmen by other
communities, they claim brahmin status for themselves and at
times call themselves "Viswakarmabrahmana's" or
"Viswabrahmana's". But I knew a Viswakarma lady in Mysore who,
when my wife enquired about her ancestral village and the kinds of
people who lived there, answered that besides themselves there
were gowdas, untouchables, brahmins and ayyangars -- i.e., she
considered neither her own group nor ayyangars brahmins. In any
case the Viswakarmas are ritually independent of ('other') brahmins.
