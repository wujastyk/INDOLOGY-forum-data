   The Munda assignment of words like aga.da may need
   a revision, because of (old) Tamil words. A cursory look
   at the online Tamil lexicon.

   a) aka_lAn2-e.tuttal = 1) to make holes in the earth
                          2) to burrow as rats
   b) aka_li-tiruttutal = to fill in small pits
   c) aka_ltal = 1) to excavate, dig out
                 2) to pluck out, as  an eye
                 3) to uproot
