Dravidian may be the first to have been separated and went north. Next the

Pamir and then to Europe etc. The satem speakers left after that, batch by

To me this is as good a hypothesis as any in comparative linguistics
(substantiation of which of course needs help from other scientific
scholarship, e.g. archaeology).
