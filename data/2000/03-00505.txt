thank you: angavastram
Dear Mr. Deshpande and Mr. Chandran,
thank you very much for your information. As a translator I am also reading the
German translator's list u-litfor. The question was asked by a lady translating
a novel by a Bengali author. She did not give any other background information,
but sends her best regards.
Thank you again - Ursula Graefe
