I guess the assumption here is Sankara's date around 700 CE.
The "standard" academic opinion is more like early 9th century.
Kunjunni Raja (ALB, 1963) takes the 9th c. date assuming an
earlier era for Vacaspati Misra. Subsequent researches collating
scores of manuscripts by S. A. Srinivasan, ... pushes Vacaspati to
late 10th century. See Dr. B. Kellner's posting in Indology referring
to works by Slaje., The ency. of Indian philosophy volumes also
mention late 10th century date for Vacaspati. Using the late
10th century date of Vacaspati, and K. Raja's article
Sankara's date looks more like 10th century, is it not?
