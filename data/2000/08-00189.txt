Hurrees? "Brahmanophobefulness" is more appropriate than "Brahmanophobyness", no question about it. Please consider the following example:
Billy Bunter: Which of you chaps is going to lend me a bob until Thursday?
Hurree Jamset Ramsingh: The lendfulness is terrific, my boy.

Thanks and Warm Regards,
