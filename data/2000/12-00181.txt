Sir,
You are absolutely right.. the 2nd reason is more
appropriate.. The point is not to make scapegoats for
things which their forefathers (invaders) have done..
But just to prevent history from being forgotten
totally and thus not allowing it to repeat in future..
How many of our kids are taught the results of
partition.. I guess, in couple of generations it will
be forgotten that their was a partition based on
2-nation theory, based on communal identity a part of
the body of our Mother India was given away.. thus
paving a way for another partition..
And yeah, if the views of this generation (including
the converts) are different from their forefathers
(invaders), we should not really worry about the
future.. But yeah,
if their views remain the same..
outlook to life remain the same..
mentality remain the same..
jehadi ideology remain the same..
"respect" in their minds for other religions remain
the same..
"respect" for "kafirs" remain the same..
(in)tolerance remain the same..
then we might have to make sure that "we dont remain
the same".. we should be more united and all set to
counter all threats..
We neednot attack any other
dharma/religion/ideology/country but yeah we should
have enough guts to atleast defend our own.
Gandhiji himself wished that if missionaries in India
where for humanitarian support he would welcome them..
but if they are here for the sake of conversions.. he
would want them to leave.. Gandhiji had very well
understood that this country will prosper much more
with its own culture..
So any threat to our culture should be very well dealt
with..
