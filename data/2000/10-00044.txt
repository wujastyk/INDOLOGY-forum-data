T. W. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 1903 (reprinted 1997), p. 116
"These merchants were mostly Dravidians, not Aryans.
Such Indian names of the goods imported as were adopted in the
west (Solomon's ivory, apes and peacocks, for instance,
and the word "rice") were adaptations, not of Sanskrit
or Pali, but of Tamil words."
