Vedic Reciters/Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
Steve Framer writes:
Quite a number of Buddhist sutras translated into Chinese seem to have
been done in this way with accompanying oral explication and
commentary.
Was this not also one of the earlier criticism's on the "memory place"
technique even by Ricci's day ?  It often led to the acquisition of
many facts without true understanding.
Best wishes,
