Sakadwipa (RE: Rising of the sea and other Migration myths)
Though the MahAbhArata really places the ZAkadvIpa continent to the
east of Meru (XII.14.23), the first ZAkadvIpa (Maga) Brahmans seem
to come from the NW, acc. to the SAmba legend, related in the SAmba-,
BhaviSya-, Brahma- and SkandapurANa. In this case the ZAkadvIpa as
the place of their origin is to be connected rather with the historical
SakasthAna, i.e. modern Seistan in Eastern Iran. Invited by the KRSNa's son SAmba,
the Magas first settled in Mitravana/SAmbapura/MUlasthAna (=
historical Multan). They brought with them the pratice of wearing avyanga
(a corruption of the Avestan term meaning the "sacred girdle of the
Zoroastrians") and the specific cult of the Sun-God, worshipped under
his Old Iranian name Mithra, which was later replaced by Middle
Iranian Mihr/Mehr/Mihir (from whence Indian Mihira). Research done by
several generations of scholars has revealed the gradual spread of the
ZAkadvIpa Brahmans over the Indian subcontinent and eventually their
penetration even into Eastern India. The well-known Indian ethnologist P.L.Vidyarthi
in his brilliant monograph on the city of GayA in Bihar expressed his opinion of
Iranian (Magian) origin of the local ZAkadvIpi Brahmans. The Bibliography on the
problem of Indian Magi (including basic works by R.C.Hazra, K.Hoffman and H. von Stietencron)
see in my article "An Iranian Myth in Eastern India: GayOmart and the Mythology of GayA"
