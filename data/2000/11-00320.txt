Thanks for your nice observation. In Tamil, 'karuppu' and
'nalla' are used in common names for people. DEDR lists
'al' (=night) from 'nalla'. Iravatham Mahadevan has an
article describing how 'nalla' means 'black' in many
situations.
When Tamils refer to African people as "karuppar",
it just means Blacks, and they do not assign any
negative cannotations to it. Otherwise, will they
themselves name their children as karuppu-/nalla-?
Best wishes,
