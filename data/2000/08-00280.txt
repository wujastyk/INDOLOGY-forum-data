nature and volume.I will try to provide complete ref. details hereafter..
I rely upon the books published by the Tamil University and Saraswathi
Mahaal Library, Tanjore. The Annual nUmbers of The Saraswathi Mahaal
Library are also referred often.
My conclusion is that The kanchi Kamakoti Mutt had come to Kumbhakonam
during the reign of Prathapa Simhan. The modi manuscripts and other
inscriptions (during the 18th and 19th Centuries)do refer the institution
only as Kanchi Kamakoti Shankara mutt and the Peetadhipathi as The
shankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam.
