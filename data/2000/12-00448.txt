Dravidian origins

Firstly, you should not read a mere encyclopedia article. Much
better is Zvelebil's book _Dravidian Lingusitics: An Introduction_,
which I have mentioned some time before on this list (publ.
Pondicherry, I believe by the Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics
and Culture, in 1990 or 1992 or so. I do not have my copy of the
book at hand for the exact reference, sorry). A few chapters deal
with the question of relationships between Dravidian and other
language families, and Zv. gives bibliographies for further reading.
Secondly, after reading those chapters (through which you will
learn that Dravidian is more than Tamil ;-) ), you will see that Zv.'s
standard for what is "definite" is rather high. A migration of this
language family via the Indian northwest is rather certain; but it
cannot as yet definitely be said whether Dravidian came from
central Asia or from further west. On this matter too, Zv. gives good
bibliographies for further reading.
