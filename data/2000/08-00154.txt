<<It is said that these persons are converts from the recent 1990s
jihad. >> The man I know who was Muslim and named Shaiva (a clearly
religious name and not an occupation name like Sethi) was in his
twenties in 1979, clearly before any recent forced conversions.   I
know of a case of a Kashmiri Pundit converting to Islam in the 50's
because he was in love with a Muslim girl.  In his case I don't know
what name changes he made.  Allen Thrasher
