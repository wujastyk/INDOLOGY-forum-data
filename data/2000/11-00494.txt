RV. asi - L. ensis < black (metal)?
It is worth drawing the attention to the family of Dravidian
words with the root *ay/*Ay = minute, fine, small, sharp, and iron.
And to the word irumpu = iron, weapon and *ir = dark;
DEDR #193:
Ta. ayil: = javelin, lance, surgical knife, lancet;
Ma. ayil: = javelin, lance; ayiri = surgical knife, lancet
DEDR #192:
Ta. ayil: iron
Ma. ayir, ayiram = any ore
Ka. aduru = native metal;
Tu. ajirda karba = very hard iron
Note that DEDR #341 lists Ma. ayiram = iron dust
