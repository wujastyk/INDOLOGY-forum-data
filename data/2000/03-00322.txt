SV: Saraswati: Atomic Scientists reconfirm location

There are no overt mathematical formulas in the Vedas, so if you want to find
mathematical stuff there, you need to know your Vedic language very well
indeed. The right person to look for would be an Indologist with a good
knowledge of mathematics (like e.g. Paul Hacker, who was an excellent
mathematician, but never found any maths in the Veda, I believe.
Yes, it does. If you don't know the language well, you can read any sort of
nonsense into it. Amateur Vedic studies abound in "creativity" caused by a lack
of philological and linguistic knowledge.
Unlike certain "scientists", we (the Indologists) do not try to lecture
scientists on e.g. cosmology, physics, or chemistry. We simply assume that they
know their business, and if they disagree (which they often do), we leave it to
them to thrash it out. We do not presume that reading a couple of books on
physics qualify us to engage the pros in complex discussions.
