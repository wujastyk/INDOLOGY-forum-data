I am sorry no offence is meant. We just had a heartful discussion of
"several" branches of buddhism compared with "several" versions of advaita
by "many" authors who lived at "different times" as reported by some modern
authors and as posted by Satya. We may not afford some more discussion of
the intermediate interpreters. My preference is to go back to original texts
of veda or what Buddha originally said (silence?).

>(ayodhya issue)
I have questions on historicity of vizvAmitrA who was deconstructed in Ai.A.
