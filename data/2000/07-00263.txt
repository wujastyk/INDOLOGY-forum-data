message from Dr. Elst
Prof. Gupta writes:
Yes : he transmitted a letter by Dr. Elst who writes instead of Dr.
Rajaram, who tells (some of) us that he is too busy translating the Indus
seals. Of course, we can only *invite* him to defend his "decipherment"
himself on this list, and not via-via:   He *does* have email, vide:
Re: Spoked -wheels in the Rv
CC: navarat at bgl.vsnl.net.in (N.S. Rajaram),
        vishalagarwal at hotmail.com (Vishal Agarwal), witzel at fas.harvard.edu,
        kendra at bol.net.in, koenraad.elst at pandora.be, dirkgysels at hotmail.com,
        Vedicinst at aol.com <<<
Rajaram finds time, though, to write elaborate, ---how shall we phrase it
politely--- elaborate denouncements of virtually anything in Indian/South
Asian Studies/Indology that does not come from an *Indian* pen or keyboard.
The insulting quote given a few days ago is just a small specimen. I invite
members to read his effusions on the (generally rather poisonous)   website
: The Sword of Truth":
http://www.swordoftruth.com/
Read some of their news, commentary, between the lines, and very revealing,
their POLLs!! With regard to Indology proper,  read Rajaram himself:

and on the linked site :

Simple question? Why did Elst not send a last message himself? Why some
much via-via??
PS: I just see that he has bothered to briefly rejoin us....
