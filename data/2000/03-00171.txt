Elst's review of Kochhar's Vedic People
You conveniently cut my note on cows:
Ukraine eastwards, from at least c. 4000 BCE onwards. They did not go there
of their own volition. How to keep them during winter is another problem."
...everybody knows that...
??? -- I don't follow here; -- what is the relation between (half-)asses
and  Aryans?  -- Half-asses and asses are attested in the S.Central Asian
BMAC culture (Arch. lingo : bricks, mortar, asses and camels).  Where they
thrived in the desert oasis/steppe/thick delta brush of the Central Asian
rivers flowing down from the Kopet Dagh/Hindukush.
Half-asses were local (=onager, hemione); the real ass (asinus) was a more
recent import from the Near East (Mesopotamia), just as camels were of more
recent adaptation in the BMAC. Sorry, no horses there, so far. So, no horse
riding/chariot riding BMAC Aryans.
Don't remember her to well from my last life. Never was found of that kind
of 'spiritualism'.
NamaH kharaaya, namo raasabhaaya, namo gardabhaaya.
