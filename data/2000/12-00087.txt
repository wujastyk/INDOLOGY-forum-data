Zoroastrianism and Buddhism
Allen,
Though an old work which does not take into account more recent
scholarship--historical, linguistic, text critical, etc.--, Emil Abegg's Der
Messiasglaube in Indien und Iran, Berlin:  W. de Gruyter, 1928, carefully
outlines the confluence of many of the major issues in these two traditions.
