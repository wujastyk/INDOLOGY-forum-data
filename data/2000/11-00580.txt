 The contrast in ancient India in the preference of color symbolism
 is notable:

 Among the Dravidians, their ancient God is Black.
 The oldest Dravidian literature calls Him mAl, mAyan meaning
 Black. White is their color of mourning and mere sight
 of widows wearing white is a sign of misfortune.

 In direct contrast, in the ancient Iranian-Aryan texts, black skin and color
 is not portrayed in good light.

Indologists differ from the methodology of New Age writers like
Georg Feuerstein, ...

The black versus white symbolism trasfered to evil against good
in Judaism is coming from Iran, as far as we know.
