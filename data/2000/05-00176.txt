I do not have a list of references from the Puranas, but the book mentioned
by J. Houben on this matter is a very good place to start (by the way, the
author is Steinmann, not Steiner).
The "Guru-Gita" is widely available through the (zaiva) Siddha Yoga
Foundation.
An interesting passage is TaittirIya UpaniSad 1.11, which seems to concede
that Vedic students can distinguish between the good and bad behavior of
teachers.
