As far as I can see, Mbh. (Poona Edition) 5.140.18 is the only passage
where the start of the battle on the new moon day "which has Indra as its
deity" (that means probably jyeSThA so that the month would be mArgazIrSa)
is mentioned. Though the chronological account of the Mahabharata battle
does not seem to be quite consistent (see my article "Narrated time and its
relation to the supposed Year Myth in the MahAbhArata", in M. Brockington
and P. Schreiner (ed.): Composing a Tradition. Proc. of the First Dubrovnik
Int. Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Puranas, Zagreb 1999, p.49-66,
here p. 59 f.), it is nowhere said that the battle did NOT start on a new
moon day.
