The Sinhala word 'Karave' is ultimately derived from the Tamil, 'Karaiyar' (
coastal dweller). The 'folk etymology' of Karai with Kuru had already been
made in Tamil Nadu before associated with the Kshatriyisation of
"lower" castes before these people showed up in historical records of Sri
Lanka, which is pretty late.
