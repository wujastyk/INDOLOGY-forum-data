Aryan Panzers
The new century as begun as badly as the last one ended. Since Jan. 1, we
have seen one tirade after another about  Aryans, Indian Studies/Indology
in the West, or about the North/South Indian  divide.
However, the following is an interesting 'philological' study of amusing,
emotionally and politically motivated, rhetorical distortions of one's
writing.
Readers of INDOLOGY beware!

My original paragraph reads:  Erdosy 1995; p. 108-9
< From: Early Indian history: Linguistic and textual parameters In: The
Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia. G. Erdosy (ed.),  Berlin/New York: de
Gruyter 1995, 85-125, (bold characters are added here for ease of reading
and reference) >
** A rather long period of acculturation is also visible in the appearance
of "Aryan" kings with non-Indo-Aryan names, such as Balbutha and Brbu.  In
fact, this is just one of the many features which point, in spite of the
constant warfare mentioned in the RV, to a rather close relationship
between the incoming Indo-Aryans and the local populations, with the result
that the latter became gradually "Aryanized."  Not only the language but
also the culture of the newly arrived elite was appropriated, including the
Vedic "tank", the horse-drawn chariot. In the words of  F. Southworth
(1974), echoed by Kuiper (1991:8), "the equation of Indo-Aryan speakers
with 'Aryans' (i.e. the original intruders and their direct descendants) is
not supported by historical evidence",  and: "As a sociological term,
'Aryan' denotes all those who took part in the sacrifices and festivals."
(Kuiper 1991: 96)  **
(My old files read slightly but not substantially differently, and can be
supplied; this is the version as edited by Erdosy)
Incidentally, as any conscientious reader will understand, this is not a
theory of massive "Aryan invasions" on chariots/horse back but represents a
much more nuanced and sophisticated scenario, in part based on the model
developed by the, sorry, .... anthropologist C. Ehret, for  --horribile
dictu--  parts of Africa.

The following quotes from INDOLOGY are of interest as we can nicely
establish the trail (after all, I am a philologist). It was started some
3-4 years ago in an *anonymous* review ("must read!") of Erdosy's ed.
volume (1995) in, I think, the Sanskrit list out of Utah (if necessary, the
