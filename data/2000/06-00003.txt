Bibliography on  Divehi grammar
The best starting point is probably
C. H. B. Reynolds, Maldives (Clio Press: Oxford, Santa Barbara, Denver,
1993). World Bibliographical Series, vol. 158.  ISBN 1-85109-076-2.
It's a very comprehensive bibliography of studies up to 1993.  The field
doesn't move very rapidly, so you will not miss a great deal if you start
with this.
