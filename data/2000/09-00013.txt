SV: interesting experience/Urdu/hindi
Certainly Mr Abbas seems another Rajaram on the other side,
I am amused by both the efforts.  Not clear how many followers
exist or are these just attempts..  On the other hand,
objective stirring does have merit.
So how does Urdu originate now? and what is the theory and span
of Mughalstan?  Are there other "..stans", like marthastan,
kalingastan, tamilstan?  What is the complete theory?
Are "...stans" separate or merge into one India nationhood?
Kindly illuminate..
