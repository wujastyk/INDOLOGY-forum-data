The word Caucasian is merely a PC substitute for Aryan.
It seems to have been coined at a time of growing nationalistic
fervor in Europe.
It is also no wonder that the Great Indo European Homeland is
located in the Caucasus according to present day europeanist
academics.

------------
This is what the Merriam Websters Dictionary has to say
on the word Caucasian:
Main Entry: Cau?ca?sian
Pronunciation: ko-'kA-zh&n, k?- also -'ka-zh&n
Function: adjective
Date: 1807
1 : of or relating to the Caucasus or its inhabitants
2 a : of or relating to the white race of humankind as classified according
to physical features b : of or relating to the white race as defined by law
specifically as composed of persons of European, No. African, or southwest
Asian ancestry.
---------------

Also remember some time ago there were some on this list
who were criticizing the weak Humanities in India. It must be
pointed out that Stanley Wolpert is a senior Historian
and his work is published by OUP. So much for the boasts of
peer review and academic quality.
