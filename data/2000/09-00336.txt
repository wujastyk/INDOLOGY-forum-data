Perhaps it indeed is asking too much, :-))) after the performances
of 'scientists' on this list from time to time. Let me assure you that
I have nothing against mathematicians per se; but I do find
Rajaram's piece very illustrative of the style of reasoning that
regularly leads to clashes here because it is out of place. Of
course not all mathematicians a.o. do that; but then they cease to
be 'typical' mathematicians etc.
