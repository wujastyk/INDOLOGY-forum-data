Viveka & Rta/Satya
Seems like rather unnecessary paranoia, and directed at the
wrong source. For one thing, there is already too much violence
in India, and due to other kinds of rhetoric. For another, what a
few people in Madras based organizations like TAMBRAS and AIBF
think is hardly going to affect the rest of the country. The
"All-India" Brahmin Federation is even less All India than the
All India Anna DMK. It is not even All Tamil Nadu to begin with.
Where is the money to come from? And you seem to be appealing
to the very people who are struggling to find institutional
support of their research. Rather misdirected, I should think.
This underestimates the continuing political power of certain
groups as much as the earlier comment overestimates that of
others.
Well, don't worry about that. Interest in Sankara studies is
rapidly dwindling too. I have yet to see a single response to
my simple question about studies of his chAndogya upanishad
bhAshya. In any case, I'm mystified why Sankara has to be
singled out here. If you really look at what is happening,
the big-time publishing industry nowadays has to do with
Abhinavagupta. The dogma is rapidly getting established that
anything that is "Tantric" has to do with Kashmir. Tirumular
and other Tamil icons get almost zero attention.
In this, you reveal as much contempt for rigorous scholarship
as the right wing fanatics you oppose. This date is too late.
Why single out these two? Just because they are in the south?
Let's see, the only other person on this list who has made this
comment about "Maratha origin" is Swaminathan Madhuresan. Both
of you share such a remarkable congruity of views on every
possible item of discussion, one begins to wonder whether the
only thing that divides you two is a computer account.
Sorry, couldn't resist that.
Leave what? And who does not argue? Have you been reading this
list recently?
Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
