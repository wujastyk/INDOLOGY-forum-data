This is the library i have told you about before that I think has a LOT of
sanskirt texts in Telegu script. what do yo thin about offerign to be
involved in this. Perhap we cold offer them the manual OCR in exchange for
soem of the texts, etc.
Big questions:
1) Is Tamil ready for ocr?? (it uses free internet font does it not??
2) can we realistically predict that Telegu ocr will be ready this
(december) month??
3) can we realistically predict transliteration to work well, at least
one-way between these scripts??? (We might ask them to specifically tell us
the correct transliterations from Devanagari and Telegu to Tamil, etc.)
