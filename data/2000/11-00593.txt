This is the library i have told you about before that I think has a LOT of
sanskirt texts in Telegu script. what do yo thin about offerign to be
involved in this. Perhap we cold offer them the manual OCR in exchange for
soem of the texts, etc.

Big questions:
1) Is Tamil ready for ocr?? (it uses free internet font does it not??
2) can we realistically predict that Telegu ocr will be ready this
(december) month??
3) can we realistically predict transliteration to work well, at least
one-way between these scripts??? (We might ask them to specifically tell us
the correct transliterations from Devanagari and Telegu to Tamil, etc.)

the

> The manuscripts include copies of the Vedas, Samhitas, Brahamanas,

> the rare books on subjects as varied as art, architecture, astronomy,

> With the manuscripts and books in thousands, the college has already spent

> India to help them in their effort but no positive response has been
> received by the college authorities. Says Dr KK Dhawan, honorary director
> of this library, the Government wrote back asking if the DAV college was a
