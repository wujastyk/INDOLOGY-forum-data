I would like to echo Ashok Aklujkar's appreciation of Prof. Dr. Wilhelm Rau.
I had the good fortune to spend some months as a guest scholar at Marburg in
1982 while working on my dissertation. I remember his supportive interest in
my project, the facilities offered for me to pursue my work, and his
personal attention to my well being while staying in Marburg.
