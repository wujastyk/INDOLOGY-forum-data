This is contemporary Indian politics, mixed with generic Indian
conceptions of long yugas. After all, 50 centuries of Kali Yuga
have already passed! The speech does not belong in Indology, and
need not concern Indologists, unless of course, one wants to
avoid being operated upon by a doctor who says such things. I
don't think anybody here needs brain surgery, so Dr. Ramamurthi's
comments are best left aside.
