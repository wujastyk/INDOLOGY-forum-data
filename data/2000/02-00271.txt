SM> Archery is old, but I am told archers on chariots in India is post-1700
BCE.

RB> I believe there is no evidence of chaiots but just horses in India e.g.
baluchistan around 1700 BC. Is there an archeological trace of chariots in
India? Ofcourse they are found in egypt, mesopotamia, syria and turkey from
around this time but what about India? Did they all rot? What about
iconography?

SM> "IE speakers at an early stage" in India. How early?

It is unatural to assume that PIE suddenly appeared in complete isolation.
There must have been ancetors, neighbouring languages, daughter languages
through out its history. India's oldest attested IE language has voiced
aspirates, retroflexion, geminates,.. which are fairly well entrenched but
not found in most other IE languages. This might indicate a long period of
isolated development within India.

SOme harappans might have spoken it. I would hardly swear byit but it is as
good a conjecture as any.
