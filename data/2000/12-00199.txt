nAraNa_n, the tamil word for nArAyaNa (was: Vishnu)
There is a bug in hotmail which sometimes causes mail to HTML mail, sorry
about that.
ana is a rarely used secret word for prANA. chAndogyA says ana is the
conceptual eater, and the food of ana is its derivative annam. I also saw
aNNam for food, does this lead to aNa for prANA? Is there a parallel between
ana/annam or aNa/aNNam to Tamil endings anan/aNNan or Telugu ending anna?
nArAyana or aNrAyaNa means indestructible prANA. It may be phonetically
engineered with nArA for inhalation/ArohaNam and ana for
exhalation/avarohaNam.
