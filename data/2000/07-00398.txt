Rajaram's "horse seal"

He further declares:
As a new example of Rajaram's "scientific analysis," take a look
at claims he makes about the supposed Harappan "horse seal" in
his new book on the Harappan script. List participants will
recall that Rajaram's "avaricious horse thieves" decipherment of
the Dholavira sign board was thoroughly debunked by Michael
Witzel and myself on this List a while back. The "horse seal"
evidence is equally manufactured. To see a reproduction of the
seal, go to:

Rajarm writes (p. 162):
Given the importance of this claim, it is curious that the
original of the seal is incorrectly referenced in Rajaram's book
(see my note on the web page above). More information on the
original seal will be posted when I track it down.
Scientifically yours,
