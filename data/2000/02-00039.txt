Many thanks.
Good evening,
I have received a prompt number of very accurate indications and I want to
thank this forum for their precious help, especially on pointing me toward
the Olivelle translation of the Upanishads, which is apparently a consensus.
Mr. Agarwal, Carpenter, Wallis, my most profound thanks for guiding the
cautious and insecure steps of the novice.
