The following articles discussed transmission of the story.

H.Matsumura, "Kobikisaiban denshotojo no shomondai," Setuwabungaku kenkyu 33
(1998), 197-121.
K. Nomura, "Kobikisaiban wo megutte," Mukashibanasi densetu kenkyu 16
(1991), 98-108.

The first deals with literal tradition, and the second oral one.

Hisashi
