Vajra
In the second mandala of the Rigveda, in these two verses:
adhva\'ryavo\` yaH sha\`taM shamba\'rasya\` puro\' bi\`bhedaashma\'neva
puu\`rviiH  |\\
yo va\`rcinaH\' sha\`tam indraH\' sa\`hasra\'m a\`paava\'pa\`d bhara\'taa\`
soma\'m asmai  || \EN{2}{014}{06} \\
ava\' kShipa di\`vo ashmaa\'nam u\`ccaa yena\` shatru\'m mandasaa\`no
ni\`juurvaaH\'  |\\
to\`kasya\' saa\`tau tana\'yasya\` bhuure\'r a\`smaa\m+ a\`rdhaM
kR^i\'Nutaad indra\` gonaa\'m  || \EN{2}{030}{05} \\
Indra's vajra seems to be called "ashmaan", which is a stone or possibly a
precious stone? (diamond)?
Is this perhaps the first mention of the vajra as a stone or diamond, as
opposed to the more common descriptions as an iron or metal bladed weapon?
