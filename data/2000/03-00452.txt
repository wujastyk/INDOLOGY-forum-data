This is an interesting (EC selective) point you have made. I was always told
that *yavana* did not refer to any particular race, but meant a *foreigner*
of any description, but Europeans mistranslate/misconstrue to means Greeks
for their own particular reasons. Hence, even in India, I have been often
referred to, being born an Australian, as being yavana.
