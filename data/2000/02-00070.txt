Oedipus in Sanskrit?
Shiva and PArvati's son andhaka grows up abandoned by his parents. After
growing up he becomes a king among the asuras and makes advances on his
mother not knowing who she really was. He is defeated by shiva and repents
when he finds out that parvati is really his mother.
Well I read this as a kid from the amar chitra kathA a popular childrens
illustrated book which often has stories from Indian mythology.
