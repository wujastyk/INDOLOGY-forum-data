Toward a Science of Translating--Sanskrit texts--the basis for              the meaning of meaning
Dear List members,
With respect to the Sarasvati and chariot discussion
which has been taking place, I am re-posting and
adding to my inquiry which follows below.
The basis for most of the debates on this list and in
other areas is centered upon the basic question of
'what is the meaning of the word/text?'
So I wondering about the variety of the past authors
which have been foundational to the science and the
practice of translating sanskrit, pali, and prakrit
literature in the west.
Any thoughts upon recent thinkers, such as Foucault,
Derrida, Godamer in light of the mechanics of
translating into english, german, french etc., would
be warmly welcomed also.
For example, Derrida wrote: "Il n'y a pas d'hors texte
('there is nothing outside a text')" how might this
apply to the topic of interpretation/misinterpretation
translation/mistranslation on the list.
I am also interested in essays and discussion on the
mechanics of translating Sanskrit into English.
thank you.
