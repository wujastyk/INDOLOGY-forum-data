As a result of the above remark, a number of list members have sent me
smug personal messages telling me that the "real" new millennium begins in
2001, yada yada yada.  Some have even insulted me for being so stupid as
to think that 2000 is the millennium.
As you can imagine, this is not a life-enhancing beginning to my
year!  Kindly desist.
