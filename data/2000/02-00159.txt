Dear Vishal Agarwal,

I remember the clarifications you mention here from a private exchange of
emails, but I am afraid that your email on the subject died in a computer
accident some time ago.  You must therefore give clarifications in this matter
to Prof. Witzel yourself.  Since you keep records, I suggest that you copy the
relevant passage in your email to me and send it to Prof. Witzel. I will not
mind you doing so even if our exchange was private.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
