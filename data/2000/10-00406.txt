Dear Dr.Vassilikov
One gets the message from the  para quoted that western scholars are the
repository of balance and reasonableness while such is not the case with
Indians. The cultural ideal in India is 'stithapragnya' and Indians too have
to look at their own country in a balanced way and compare it with the views
given by others. After all more Indians have a long-term first hand
knowledge of educational and political situations both in India and the west
than the western scholars having a similar quantity of transnational
experience. I mean there are tens of thousands of Indians who have studied,
worked and being governed both in India and the  west compared to few
hundred western scholars at the most
Hece if the reactions of some Indians seem to be far out of sync than what
the western scholars had hoped for, it might as well show the depth of
misunderstanding of western scholars than any unreasonableness of Indians.
After all some  of the harder reactions of the Indians are political in
nature  and a reaction to having played into the hands of politcal elements
in India
"Indians
I did not say you meant all Indians;. When I said Indians , it does not mean
all Indians
Without accusing you of anything , I can point out that there is no direct
relationship between studying India all one's life and not hating it. There
have been christian missionaries in the last few centuries in India and
studying India all through their life , but who were prejudiced against
heathen beliefs , cultures and traditions till their last breath. Even many
colonial administrators were good students of India but who could never
bring themselves to shed their anti-Indianism. These gentlemen-Indologists
of yore are a good negative proof of what you are saying
 and, as every other
I don't know about every other Indologist, but I take in what you are saying
about yourself and thank you for the same
