Perhaps it is worth noting here that the IQ, as several psychological and
anthropological researchers have pointed out (cf., e.g., a Penguin book with
a dozen essays that appeared approx. 30 years titled _Race, Culture and
Intelligence_), stresses certain kinds of mental abilities, and that too in a
way that is very modernly Western (with an emphasis, e.g., on certain verbal
skills). The authors argue that a person from outside the contemporary West,
who has not had a modern Western-type education, is destined to score not
too well (as would also have been the case with Westerners in previous
centuries). So perhaps we should not lay too much stress on those numbers called
'IQ'.
