Dear INDOLOGY members,
please accept my warm greetings.

Could someone provide me any information or hints
about the primary/secondary sources of sAtvata-tantram
(a kRSNaite work; not to be mistaken with sAtvata-saMhitA,
a pAJcarAtrika text). Also, information about its Sanskrit
commentary sAtvata-tantra-bhASya is sought.

Many thanks in advance.

With best regards,
Sergei Schmalz.
