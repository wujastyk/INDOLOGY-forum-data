LOOKING FOR A WEB SITE FOR BROADER INDOLOGY DISCUSSIONS ?
My field is not literature but I have interest in broader issues which can
be called Indology . I find that my interests often are not intended for
this group which is meant primarily for those having interest in
literature .
Any one knowing about such a web site , pl post it on this web site .
I want to respond to the questions raised here on the following issues:
1. Jantar Mantar
2. What language did Buddha Speak ?
Thanks.
Anand M. Sharan
