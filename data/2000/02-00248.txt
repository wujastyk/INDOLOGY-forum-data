I womder if anybody knows about Sanskrit "spelling".  What I mean is,
how would Sanskrit words traditionally be spelt out aloud.  Perhaps
such exists but it is never mentioned in any of the standard Western
grammars of Sanskrit.   Some subscribers may know of the Tibetan
method where each element is spelt out and pronounced cumulatively.  I
am wondering if this was a native Tibetan innovation or had Indian
antecedents.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
