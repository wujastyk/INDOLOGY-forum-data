History of indian cooking
In the 1970s Gabriela Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi wrote some interesting articles
about food and religion in South India. The only reference I have here
(others are at home) is "The foods disliked by the gods in South India",
Annali dell' Istituto Orientale di Napoli 37, 1977, 257-373, where she also
discusses the question of contrast between the traditional foods offered to
the gods and the more recently introduced ones not acceptable to them.
