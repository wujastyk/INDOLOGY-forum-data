Bonjour,

In order to fill out my French-Sanskrit Dictionary I am looking for words
like FIREMAN (pompier), POSTMAN (facteur), etc.
I don't even know if such words existed in the past ! What about the
sanskritization of existing Hindi words ?
This is my first intrusion into INDOLOGY which I consider to be a very
useful means of improving my knowledge of special vocabulary.
I consulted all on-line dictionaries and did not find these current words.
The same for CHERRY (cerise) and many others.

Many thanks in advance.
