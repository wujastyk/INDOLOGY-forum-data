The best starting point for a fresher is certainly
Deciphering the Indus script / Asko Parpola
                 New York, NY : Cambridge University Press, 1994
However, the field changes all the time, as new evidence is unearthed, and
new interpretations suggested, as Michael Witzel has just demonstrated.
But Parpola's book is a good overview, and very even-handed, even though
of course he has his own ideas about the meaning of the IV
characters.
Parpola's two photographic volumes,
Corpus of Indus seals and inscriptions / edited by Jagat Pati Joshi and
Asko Parpola ; with the assistance of Erja Lahdenpera and
Virpi Hameen-Anttila
                 Helsinki : Suomalainen tiedeakatemia, 1987-
are absolutely essential for anyone thinking seriously about the IV
script.
