Buddhists and others, wasRe: RAJARAM EPISODE
 The decline of Buddhism and Jainism is largely due to the
 "emotional" Bhakti movement of Shaivism/Vaishnavism.
 In Karnataka and Andhra regions, Veerashaivism poets/saints
 repeatedly cite the earlier saints further south, and
 use their stories in their wars against heretics.
