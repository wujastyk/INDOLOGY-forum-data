Subject: Agni is scientific
Message-ID: <161227057066.23782.7715482377573395122.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

How can Agni and Indra be explained without a knowledge of the physical
nature of energy and of the heavens? For a scientific explanation: ...
ancient India saw the solar eclipse as the union and separation of moon and
fire. The sun was the exact same size as the moon and hence fell away from
the moon as burning pitch falls away from a stick. The moon, therefore, is
the source of fuel to the heavens and earth. The fire of the sun is the
illumination. Energy is a mystical substance even today; it takes many forms
and no one knows what pure energy may be. Energy is only manifested when it
changes its form or nature.
The Rig Veda points to the science of the time, why do people study the
finger rather than what it is pointing at?
