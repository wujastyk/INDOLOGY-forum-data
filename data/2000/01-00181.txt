Well, they do disclaim any recent major maternal contribution from
outside India. By "major" I mean on a widespead demographic basis.

Well, the paternal Y chromosome data is not much different from maternal
mtDNA. Hammer grouped modern Indians in a South/Southeast Asia cluster.

The major European Y chromosome haplotype is very rare or absent in
India, but a North African/Middle Eastern variety is found in small
numbers.
