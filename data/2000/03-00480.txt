Query on a myth of "Siva killing a shark
Dear Member,
In the Shaiva mythology what I have read is that Shiva takes the form of a
"Hamsa" Indian swan to kill the Fish. This fish was none else but VisNu in
Matsyaavataara.
With this regard, in the temple of Ekaa,breshvara at Kancipuram there is a
sculpture of a Hamsa with trident and Damaru holding a fish in its beak.
This fish is adorned with Shankha and Cakra.
Tyhe story you have related is really interesting.
