Subject: Query on a myth of "Siva killing a shark
Message-ID: <161227057287.23782.11985598810325898249.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Member,
In the Shaiva mythology what I have read is that Shiva takes the form of a
"Hamsa" Indian swan to kill the Fish. This fish was none else but VisNu in
Matsyaavataara.
With this regard, in the temple of Ekaa,breshvara at Kancipuram there is a
sculpture of a Hamsa with trident and Damaru holding a fish in its beak.
This fish is adorned with Shankha and Cakra.
Tyhe story you have related is really interesting.
