New Indology List
Dear Dominic,
I think this new list is unfortunate.
I have a question for you.
How is a person terminated in this list?
Is it solely based on what you think or
are their objective evaluation by peers?
Please advise.  Please don't just terminate
me for asking a question.  This happened
in kingdoms in pre-independence Orissa,
where I come from.  We must refrain.
I appeal all not to split the small group that
spends time on Indian matters. Let it not be
an Indian and non-Indian divide..
Best regards,
