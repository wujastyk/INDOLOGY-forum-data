Dhyani Buddhas ?
Re: Message from Stephen Hodge dated Tue, 11 Jul 2000
somebody about the use and origins of the term "dhyani
Buddha".  I have never come across it in any canonical
Buddist texts but I believe it was a C19th European
invention which should be discarded. <<
How then might one refer to the traditional grouping
of five ?dhyani? Buddhas? Is there mandalic
functioning, etc., not of some importance and
therefore worth retaining?
