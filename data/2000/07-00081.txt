Strange. The first time I heard it somebody said it was from Plato's
Timaeus. Either my source was wrong or I remembered wrong.

That itself need not invalidate the story. Even the Buddhist canon that we
have now was put down in writing centuries after the historic Buddha. Still
we accept that as his teachings.

We also have the Buddhist text, "Milindapanha", which is basically a
debate between the Greek king Menander (Indianized to Milinda) and the
Buddhist monk NAgAsena. Bertrand Russell, in his, "History of Western
Philosophy", makes a dubious claim that this text has a Greek original! Is
there such a text?

Doesn't seem too likely - given the stress on "anatta" - "no soul" in the
text which is uniquely Buddhist.

Also Parmenides, who is supposed to have been a soldier in the Grecian army
which invaded India, seems to teach something pretty similar to the
MAdhyamaka Buddhist chatushkoti - the four fold negation.

Plus the stories regarding Alexander's encounters with yogis and logicians
in India.

Fascinating. So was the Church trying to counter philosophical scepticism
with support from India - that religion itself is the end of philosophy?
