I've just read
Noah's Flood by Ryan and Pitman.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684861372/theindologybooks/

It's an odd book, presenting apparently solid geological seabed and
related data but in a popular, even sensationalizing, medium.

In any case, the central idea is that the Black Sea basin was virtually
dry in the early sixth millennium BC.  Then, in ca. 5600 BC the Bosphorus
channel opened up and a cataclysmic flood poured through a 400ft
waterfall, at water speeds of 40-50 knots, for a period of a year or so.
This caused the creation of the modern Black Sea.  The populations living
in the Black Sea depression were of course caused to flee from the rising
waterline.  The flood legends in Akkadian, Babylonian, Hebrew, and other
traditions are a memory of this event, which is also suggested as the
cause for the beginning of the Indo-European migrations.

Any thoughts from others who have read the book, or related studies?
