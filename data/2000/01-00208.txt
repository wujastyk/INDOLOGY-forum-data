everywhere. From the phenotypic standpoint, yes, there was also an
Africoid or "Oceanic Negroid" presence in Asia.
I doubt that mtDNA haplotype M in Africa and Asia are unrelated. The
chances of independent evolution occuring are extremely tiny because
we're speaking of multiple events each dependent on the previous one.
