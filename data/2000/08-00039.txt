In any analysis of the Hindu hostility to "Western" indology,
you must make a distinction between the different eras of
western interpretation of Indian history.  At one time,
history was definitely a tool of imperialism.

As to the analogy between Indian communists and nastikas --
a far better comparison is between Rajaram and the communists.
If you have time to waste, take a look, e.g., at :
