Of course you 'do not bother the programming experts on their lists with my
amateurism'.  I'm sure their lists are true to their area of expertise and
do not pretend to be any more than that...

On the other hand, this list calls itself "Indology" but is in fact a narrow
subset of "Indology".  So, why act surprised when you see 'amateur
Indologists bother this list'?

BTW, would you also not classify as an 'amateur Indologist'?  I presume you
are NOT a PhD in Indology?
