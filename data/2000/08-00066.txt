Maya and Truth
In the recent discussion about God and Truth there seems to be a tacit
presumption that maya is not truth. Why should this be so? In rejecting maya
as an illusion Shankar's Advaita Vedanta offers a clever solution to the
problem of appearance versus reality. But let us not forget that to the
Tantrics, and especially Kashmir Shaivites in particular, the affirmation
and celebration of maya is the only doorway to Truth.
