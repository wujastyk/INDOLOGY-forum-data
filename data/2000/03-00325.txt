Dear Dr. Thompson,
Since you have chosen to post on the list, I have to respond. I have posed
a Nirukta (closer in time to R.gveda than any of us) question 2.10.8 re:
ma_yu. (http://sarasvati.listbot.com Message#97: Divinities in the R.gveda
(1); the series will continue). I am sure indology has been accepting postings
from a variety of disciplines beyond IE linguistics. I am not the subject to
be graded, I am only an inquisitive student posing questions. The subject now
is ma_yu: semant.divinity.
Regards,
Kalyanaraman
