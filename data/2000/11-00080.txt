Silk dress
After reading about "ahimsaka" honey allowed for eating by
(modern) Jains, a question about silk. Do any Jain or Buddhist
textual sources discuss about silk and the nonviolence
of killing silkworms? Do the Chinese monks avoid wearing
silk for this reason? I doubt Vaishnava or Saiva sources
prohibited wearing silk.
Thanks for comments,
