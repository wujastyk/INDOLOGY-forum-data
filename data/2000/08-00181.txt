To assume that a thread across a man's shoulder gives him political
power in India, when he lives in the USA, is too simplistic, to say
the least. No matter what may have been the case some centuries ago,
I wish people would pay some attention to the real world here and
now, when it comes to such things. If some people go berserk with
their Occidentophobia, it looks like others have a deep case of
Brahmanophobia. Ground reality is much more complicated, you know.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
