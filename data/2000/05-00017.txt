                          Lectureship in Hindi

Applications are invited for a Lectureship in Hindi, beginning from 1
October 2000, due to
the retirement of Dr. Bahadur Singh. It is a permanent position. Before
officially taking up
the post, the appointed person has to pass a probation period of six
months.

Ph.D. degree in Hindi language or literature is required. Experience in
teaching Hindi to non-
Indian students and knowledge of other new Indian languages are most
desirable. Candidates
with German language skills and the willingness eventually to teach in
German are
encouraged to apply.

The appointee will be required to teach Hindi from the basic to the
advanced level of the
program. The courses to be taught involve regular elementary language
tuition and readings
in modern Hindi literature, both prose and poetry. Therefore, a profound

knowledge of
developments in Hindi literature as well as skills in text analysis are
expected. A course in
a second new Indian language (preferably Punjabi, Bengali and/or Tamil)
is desirable.
Teaching obligations are 12 hours a week during the semester. The
appointee will also be
expected to cooperate and assist in various research projects of the
institute.
