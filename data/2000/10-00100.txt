The Library of Congress has records for the title Sadkhandagama
(originally Prakrit Chakkhandagama) as listed below (including the ed.
mentioned in inkprint and in microfiche, and two others).  Take these
to your local university or public library and they can get them on
interlibrary loan.  The double angle brackets >> represent a macron
(long mark) over the following vowel; your interlibrary loan librarian
will be used to such typographic deficiencies. The ILL system is first
supposed to try other libraries and then LC, but that's not something
the user has to worry about.  The fiche can be ordered from LC's
Photoduplication Service (photoduplication at loc.gov), and prices and
procedures found at its homepage <http://lcweb.loc.gov/preserv/pds/>.
IMHO the prices are quite reasonable.
