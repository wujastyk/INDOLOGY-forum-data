Zupanov should have copious updated bibliography. The book isn't yet
available at the research libraries that I frequent.
Response #3:
This one comes from a well-known French scholar. It doesn't
contain much useful data, but suggests that the question
about Indian/European contacts is _terra incognita_ for most
16th-century European historians:
No Renaissance
scholar whom I've polled has yet claimed to know anything of the
Indian texts mentioned by Ferroli, referred to in Valerie Roebuck's
note, that were supposedly sent to Rome c. 1559. Knowing something
about ecclesiastical archives in this counter-Reformation period, it
wouldn't surprise me if these texts never made it out of Jesuit
headquarters. That was common in the case of many missionary reports
sent to Europe in this era from Mesoamerica. It is not impossible that
these records may be accessible today, however. Possibly some
bibliographical guidance might be found in Giorgio Levi Della Vida,
_Richerche sulla formazione del pi? antico fondo dei manoscritti
orientali della Biblioteca Vaticana_. Vatican City, 1939, or more
recent works by this same author. I've found them useful in the past,
but I can't recall whether they cover Hindu as well as Islamic
manuscripts.
So far, it appears that the earliest known discussions of Indian
thought in the Renaissance took place in the interviews that Pico
della Mirandola held with his Indian informant in Florence in 1494,
mentioned in my earlier post.
