This is Calanus, who was brought back to Greece by Alexander and made a big
impression of the Greeks [accounts in Onesicritus, Arrianus, Strabo -- going
back to Megasthenes, if I recall].  So the knowledge of gymnosophistai is
much older than Plotinus.  See the book of Klaus Karttunen already cited for
details.
