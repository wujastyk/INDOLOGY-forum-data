  That intelligence is partly inherited was well-known to the ancients :
"Jewish success has depended on the evolution of a highly intelligent
group of people using eugenics...Europeans have...an average IQ of 103
versus the average Jewish IQ of 117"
                               - [ http://home.att.net/~nuenke/mac.htm ]
 So this is just another common thread between Europe and India.

 Actually, Jews formed 13.76 % of total population in Poland, and
10.85% in Galicia, 4.40 % in Hungary, almost 4 % in Russia ca. 1900.

 So the previous comparison between Europe and India is not misplaced.
