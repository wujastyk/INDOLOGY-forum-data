I'm curious about the above observation. Could you cite a specific
example of an ellipsis like gap from the text? It may be that the
intentionally terse structure of the sUtras could cause a new
reader to think so. I find the flow of ideas from one sUtra line
to another in the yogasUtra to be remarkably lucid and more self-
explanatory than in any other sUtra text.
