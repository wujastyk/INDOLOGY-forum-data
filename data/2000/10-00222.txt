"pumpkin" myth and ikSvAku
I have read that the dynasty name, ikSvAku is related with
the Austroasiatic "pumpkin" myth. For example, Dr. K. Elst
refers to Bernard Sergent. "e.g. the birth of the human race
from a pumpkin, preserved in the patriarch's name Ikshvaku/pumpkin
comes from SE Asia." Can a lister look into B. Sergent, Gen?se de
l'Inde and, give me the reference where Ikshvaku and pumpkin
are linked? Thanks.
Prof. Vassilkov once talked about the floods myth. "The Indian
myth by its archaic plot-structure is much closer to the
Mesopotamian myth, than, e.g., to the Austro-Asiatic
versions where brother and sister escape in a hollow pumpkin,"
Following my post, "kEkaya, zAkya (Buddha's clan), Ehu Saantamula,
and tamil cEku/eHku", it is possible to give an alternate
explanation for the title, ikSvAku which is in RV X.60.4.
For a son or great person of a clan, usually "maka_n" is added
in Dravidian kings' title. Example: atiyamA_n/atiyamaka_n is
called "satiyaputo" in Asokan inscriptions. "maka" is 'son'
reconstructed by Zvelebil for PDr. (Drav. linguistics: an intro.)
I also think the same "makan"(drav. for son) is in
zAlivAhana/zAtavAhana where -vAhana < drav. "makan".
Drav. kEku = strong. Prof. Parpola derives milakkha < *mElakam
(tamil). zAkya is ikkhaga in MIA which is ultimately related to this
drav. kEka-(tamil cEku). Then combining, kEk- with maka, ikSvAku
can be derived. Its stages are something like:
Drav. kEk-maka > *ikkhvaku > ikSvAku.
Thanks for pointing to the reference in
Sergent, Genese de l'Inde,
