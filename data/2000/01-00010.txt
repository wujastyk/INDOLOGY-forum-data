The Ethnologue enumeration scheme is quite curious. Among the
major languages of the world they include:
46 AWADHI
71 HARYANVI
72 MARWARI
75 MAGAHI
76 CHHATTISGARHI
77 DECCAN
As a result they are able to adjust the ranking of the
top few languages of the world.
Who runs "Ethnologue"? Is it a committee of academic
researchers? What is their objective?
