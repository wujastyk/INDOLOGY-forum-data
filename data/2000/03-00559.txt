No insult taken, as none was intended.

In principle, our views are startlingly alike.  I am therefore confident
that you will join me in requesting the name of this list be changed to
"Speculations in Indology - A philological perspective".  I respectfully
submit this title change will bring about two key benefits:

1) more accurately reflect the nature of this list
2) sharply reduce the number of 'non-specialists' that subscribe to/ clutter
this list

warmest regards,
Sanjay Garg
