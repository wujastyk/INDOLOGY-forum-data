Subject: --the basis for the meaning of meaning
Message-ID: <161227056625.23782.14563991142940505222.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

We are currently working on a method of using a computer to assist in
translations. our starting approach is that any translation must be based
upon the subject matter, the time and place as well as the source. In other
words it is as if different dictionaries must be used for different
translations. A modern computer is ideal for this application.
Sanskrit seems to have its own problems, as  I mentioned Abhinavagupts's
ParAtrISikA VivaraNa in which he gives assistance to the Sanskrit reader as
to how to extract the meaning. If such problems existed in his time in his
own Language, they surely are worse today?
Let me know if you find your answer.
regards
Bob Peck
