Message-ID: <161227061593.23782.17318843355064220802.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The CTAN distribution of Charle's Wikner's TeX/Metafont Devanagari
includes ten bug report files.  Has anyone applied the patches to the
various files (esp. skt.c and skt.sty)?

It's a bit of work, and if someone's already done it, I'd be grateful for
a copy.  I could also arranged for the patched files to be mounted at CTAN
for others.

Best,
Dominik
