Ganakashtadhyayi - A Software on Panini's Sutras
Dear scholars of Indology,
The 11th World Sanskrit Conference scheduled to be held in Turin in the
beginning of next month reminds me of its previous conference held at our
Taralabalu Kendra in Bangalore 3 years ago. I had the privilege of being the
Honorary President of the Organizing Committee. Many of you attended the
Bangalore conference and presented scholarly papers.  Some of you even
helped me in organizational/academic matters with good advice and active
participation.  After the conference was over, I could not personally thank
you enough, for all that help I received.
On the eve of the Turin Conference and the Sanskrit year, I wish to offer
all of you a small gift in the form of a software developed by me on
Panini's sutras.  The software is named as Ganakashtadhyayi  (windows
version 1.0) and is freely downloadable from the site:
http://www.vsna.org/swamiji/panini/win/win_panini.html
The present version (1.0) is only a preliminary version containing minimum
features:
1. All the Sutras of Panini are given in Roman script using standard
diacritical marks.
2. Pada-Patha:  Splitting of Sandhis in the Sutras for easy comprehension
(Incomplete)
3. Vrittis on the Sutras as found in the Siddhanta Kaumudi and Laghu Kaumudi
(Incomplete)
4. Sutras can be sorted in the order of Ashtadhyayi, Siddhanta Kaumudi or
Laghu Kaumudi.
We have tested the software with Internet Explorer (4.0) and Netscape (4.7)
on the operating system Windows 98.  However, Windows NT users are advised
not to download.
Any comments or suggestions for the improvement of the software are most
welcome.
Looking forward to seeing some of you at the Turin conference!
Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji
