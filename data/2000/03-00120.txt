Elst's review of Kochhar's Vedic People
PKM>However, the Indian cow is an entirely different breed than Bos
taurus of West Asia, separated by many thousands of years. And the zebu
shows little signs of introgression from bos taurus, quite the reverse
in fact.
RB> Actually Bos Indicus has separated from other Bos atleast 200000 to
300000 yrs ago.
The african breeds are also distinct and domestication is local although the
branching off is more recent. Skeletal data from mehergarh and other places
show evidence of local domestication( reuction in size from wild state ).
