muSTANDa, apANDa, eunuchs
Indologists,
   In a March Indology message responding to a query by Ruth Schmidt,
Georg von Simpson provided an explanation for Hindi-Urdu "muSTANDa",
noting an observation that Wezler had made concerning "apa-ANDa" along the
way. If someone could supply me with the title to Wezler's article (ZDMG
148 (1998), pp. 261-276) I would appreciate it.
   Any information / references about eunuchs in ancient India would also
help me to advise a classical studies student who is very interested in
doing research on this topic. [Key words: chinnamuSka, hRtapuMstva,

Thanks very much,
Tim Cahill
