Q: Nehru-Gandhi dynasty
I believe the immediate cause of Jawaharlal Nehru's death was an aortic
aneurysm.  Since Nehru was cremated, and the ashes scattered, it would
not be possible to study his remains.
Feroz Gandhi was Parsi.
Similar sources to the gossip mentioned also have stories of how one of
Nehru's sisters was having an affair with a Muslim, and how the Mahatma set
spies on her and so on.
I've never been able to substantiate any of that -- its basically nonsense.
