Thanks much; I'm aware of a reference in the Brhadaranyaka U., III.8.10
which however could be taken as a rhetorical statement; will need to check
out yours for something that's not presented as a counterfactual.

Translation by S.C. Vasu (AMS Press, NY, 1974):

    Whosoever not seeing (knowing) this Aksara, O Gargi performs
    sacrifices, offers prayers to gods, or practices austerities for
    thousands of years, all that work of his is sure to come to an
    end.  An object of pity is surely he, who departs from this world,
    O Gargi, having no knowledge of this Aksara.  But he, O Gargi,
    who departs from this world having seen (known) this Aksara,
    becomes indeed a Mukta (Brahmana).
