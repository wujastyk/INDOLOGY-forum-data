Comp. ling.: Tamil Prakrit???
It's not terminological difference of opinion that's
really at issue here. I'm afraid the spirit of Dr
Palaniappan's original post is getting lost here in
some very fine philological hair splitting :-)
To my mind, Dr Palaniappan was suggesting that Tamil
was a Classical language on par with Sanskrit. To
quote the original post,
Indeed, as AK Ramanujan once wrote, "Tamil, one of two
classical languages of India, is the only language of
contemporary India which is recognizably continuous
with a classical past."
