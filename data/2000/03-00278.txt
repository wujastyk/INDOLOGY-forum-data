Horse
Seems I ought to join Herr Witzel's fan club.  I never studied the BMAC
(well, the one whose writings I did study was the Babri Masjid Action
Committee), except for some much-discussed BMAC data on soma and fire
temples.  Stupid me, I never questioned the widespread assumption that it
was a "horse-centred" culture, implied in Bernard Sergent's thesis that the
BMAC was the Indo-Iranians poised to invade India.  But now I read:

If that were true, it would change the picture concerning the horse evidence
completely.  If the absence of horses in the BMAC doesn't disprove its being
Aryan, the near-absence of horses in Harappa need not disprove its being
Aryan either.
