Madhava, Vidyaranya, Sringeri, and Kulke
In his article, "Maharajas, mahants, and historians. Reflections on the
historiography of early Vijayanagara and Sringeri" (pp. 120 -143 in the book
"Vijayanagara - City and Empire" ed. by A. L. Dallapiccola et. al, vol.1,
1985), Hermann Kulke presents arguments showing the following.
1. The stories of the Sangama brothers' Telugu origin and conversion to Islam
etc. are not supported by epigraphic evidence.
2. While there is epigraphic evidence of a Jaina establishment at Sringeri in
the 12th century, there is no evidence of a Sankara monastey at Sringeri
prior to 1346 when the vijayotsava of Vijayanagara was celebrated. The
hitherto known epigraphical evidence allows only the conclusion that Sankara
was not the founder of Sringeri's famous matha.
I would very much like to know if there have been any scholarly arguments
challenging Kulke's findings?
On a related issue, what are the earliest documents attesting to any
interaction between Vedantadesika and Vidyaranya?
Thanks in advance.
