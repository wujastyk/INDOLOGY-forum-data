Subject: Rajaram's bogus "horse seal"

Being only a curious observer in the field
I went through various sites this evening.
Rajaram's site definitely sounds political.
(why is it "sword of truth"?)
He should just point the evidence than
point fingers.  He probably has an audience.

His claim of decipherment may have
some merit.  He claims to have "read" scripts
on 2000 seals and if the reading is scientific,
he deserves credit.  Does he err 2000 times?

Now whether he stretches on the "horse seal"
to create news is another matter.  It's too flimsy
an evidence to establish a theory.  By using strong
language like "bogus" in this forum is playing into
the politics.  We can respectfully disagree.

I will like to hear from the knowledeable sources
if Rajaram's decipherment has merit.  I am an
imaging scientist.  I know some technology behind
such studies and recognitions.  I will appreciate
any comments.
