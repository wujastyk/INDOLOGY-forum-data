Viveka & Rta/Satya
Is there something wrong in Rajaram presenting his views
as based on scientific analysis ?
Isnt the AIT marketed as being based on scientific analysis,or
is it now a matter of faith ?
It is incumbent on Rajaram to present his case in a scientific manner.
Factual history can be known only by considering various views.
Until now, Indian history has been the monopoly of Europe. It is
refreshing to see competition.
