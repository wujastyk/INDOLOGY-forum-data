Indra's son
Dear Prof. Goldman,
Is the story of Jayanta in the form of a crow
trying to hurt Sita told in Valmiki (Sundarakanda)?
Perialvar in the Divyaprabandham and Kamban in his
Ramayanam tells this story. Folkstories explain
how the crows got only one eye from this episode.
Do only southern mss. of Valmiki have this episode?
Thank, SM
