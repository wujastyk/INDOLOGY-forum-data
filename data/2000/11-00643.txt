Off-the-cuff, Walker's description seems "okay" (given its brevity).  There
is more than one text regarding the azvamedha and he may be blending various
aspects from different texts/recensions (if he has looked at the primary
sources...I don't know).  For example  descriptions of the horse, its color,
etc. varies across texts.  Also, if I recall correctly, Madhyandina SB does
not send the king out with the horse to roam for a year (does any text? I
don't know).  While I do not currently have the SB handy, I recall also that
in Madh. SB that the king is to be in seclusion, not to do his kingly
duties, not to engage in intercourse, etc. while the horse is roaming.
Whether all these things happened literally or were ritually represented is
unanswerable in the early sources.  I tend to lean towards the former.

That said, however, I see no reason to necessarily assume that a king
performing the azvamedha was actually trying to conquer new territory
(especially if my memory of his seclusion is correct).  Ritual error (i.e.,
dead or captured horse being the most extreme) would be quite possible, not
to mention very embarrassing for the king (there are expiations for this,
but they are also for accidental or natural death).  The king in an
azvamedha may simply have been ritually asserting or inaugurating his
authority over his territory (perhaps newly acquired, perhaps not).  Bear in
mind that the army "letting the horse wander" needs only to feed to horse to
keep it from running off and starting a war.
