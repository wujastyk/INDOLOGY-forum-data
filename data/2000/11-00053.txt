Ven Tantra quotes:
Whenever I read an author who uses the term "`sakti" for the female
consorts (vidyaa/praj~aa) of Buddhas, I find I get alarm-bells going
off in my head.  I think to myself, "If this guy doesn't know that
that term is never used in Buddhist tantras (with the exception of the
late Kaalacakra-tantra) and why not, how reliable is the rest of
his/her stuff".   This case seems to be typical -- it seems very
reductionist and superimposes onto Buddhist tantrism interpretations
that are borne out by traditional commentories.   The last sentence
strikes me as misleading over-imaginative rubbish.  It might have been
more convincing if he had referred to the exegesis of "bhagavat" which
is sometimes glossed as "bhaga-endowed" where "bhaga" = "yoni".
Perhaps Harunaga (if he has time) could comment.
Best wishes,
