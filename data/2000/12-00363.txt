Why look for presumably western endowments.? Parties calling
themselves 'dravidian' have been in existence for half a century with the
public exchequer in their control.'Dravidian' varsities have been
established, dozens have immolated themselves with petrol in an imagined
attempt to 'save' Tamil and millions have been moved to think positively
of 'dravidian' languages.

If all this does not help Dravidian studies, why depend upon western
endownments?
