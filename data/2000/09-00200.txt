Bharataa battle and MBh
It is important to distinguish between the Bharata battle( between the Kauravas and the Pandavas) and the Mahabharata text. The text contains matter later than the battle), e.g.reference to Yavanas.Clearly, the text remained open much after the event that forms its core. When was MBh closed?A clue comes from the fact that MBh does not refer to weekdays or zodiacal signs, which are believed ,on the basis of circumstantial evidence, to have been introduced into India c.100 BC. In other words, a statement in MBh could be as recent as just before 100BC.
