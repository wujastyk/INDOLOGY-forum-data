         I wonder what would be the use of such new "characters", mixing
nagari (candrabindu or pseudo umlaut) and roman. I suppose that the
standard transcription of nasalized vowels, short or long, is the addition
of a superscript "tilde".
         Otherwise, as a diacritical mark, very similar to an "umlaut", is
used alternatively with the candrabindu to mark nasalized vowels in
Nepalese manuscripts, I would be very happy to add six more characters to
the proposed set : a macron umlaut, i macron umlaut, u macron umlaut and
the corresponding capitals...
