Manuscript of the Jnanasamhita of the Sivapurana
Dear Members
I have been working on the Jnanasamhita of the Sivapurana which
was last printed in Maharashtra and in Bengal in the 1890s. I would
be grateful for any information on the MSs of this Samhita.  As per
Hazra, no MS has been found in Bengal.  Does someone know of
one elsewhere in India?
