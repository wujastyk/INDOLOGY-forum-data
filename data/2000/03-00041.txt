Re. D.ombii
In reference to a sort of tantric muse/partner, two
popular scholars (Eliade and Walker) from the 50?s and
60?s translated the Sanskrit word d.ombii as
?washerwoman.? But I see no connection to ?washer?
here. Are we to presume that they mistook d.ombii for
a female dhobi* or ?laundry person?? Could the
apparent confusion be caused by mistaking the
retroflex d in d.ombii for a unretroflex dh as in
dhobi?
*Dhobi: presumably from Sanskrit root dhav, as is the
Hindi word dhona, both of which mean, ?to wash??
