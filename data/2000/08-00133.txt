I believe children in New Jersey, USA, can study about the genocide of the
Irish by the English -- it is an approved part of the school curriculum.
(e.g., see mention in http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1997/049721.shtml )

Now, either this is a distortion of history, or else, the British get off
very lightly in most history books.

Either way, some one ought to be protesting, no ?
