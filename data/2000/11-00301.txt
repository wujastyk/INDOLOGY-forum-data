Re. Black and Bright and Beautiful
Black and Bright and Beautiful
In Gau.diia Vai.s.nav literature ?hari/hari.h? has at
least three meanings pertinent to this thread.
Hari is that . . .
1. which ?attracts the mind by ecstatic love (for
God)? /  prema dyaa hare manu
2. which ?takes away all inauspiciousness? / sarva
maNgala hare
3. ?quality which attracts the mind and causes people
to give up the four (Vedic) [mundane] goals of life
[ie. dharma, artha, kaama, mok.sa] / caari
puru.sa-artha chaa.daaya, gu.ne hare sabaara mana.
See _Zri Caitanya-caritaam.rta, Madhya-liilaa_, Ch.
24, Texts 59 & 64.
BTW, I for one have personally witnessed people of
both African and Southern Indian origin that had
complexions so black that they were blue. I would add
that I found these remarkable countenances to be
equally radiant and beautiful.
