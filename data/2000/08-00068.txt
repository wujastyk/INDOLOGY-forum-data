Harappan animal icons/inscriptions
Ferenc Ruzsa writes (on Marshall 252 and 378):
So much for the "different animal/same inscription" argument in
this case. I missed this in Mahadevan and was misled by Marshall
1931, where the pictures of the two sides are shown in different
Plates. I have a note from M. Witzel that supports the idea that
they are opposite sides of the same object.
In light of what we've already found, Ferenc, does *any* evidence
remain of "different animals/same inscription" on separate seals?
The suggestions of this in Mahadevan's concordance on copper
plates, as you know, have turned out to be incorrect. Maybe my
original claim that the same inscriptions are always associated
with the same animals holds for separate seals? Any exceptions to
this rule might tell you a lot.
Interesting conjectures. Has anyone ever closely studied the data
just on the two-sided seals? I'm not certain how many of them are
around.
On inscriptions on "bossed" seals as names:
Again, good points. This said, do you think that the number of
duplicates of inscriptions on the "bossed" seals argue againstthe
personal name thesis, as I conjectured? You have a better idea of
how many duplicates of this sort are around than I do.
