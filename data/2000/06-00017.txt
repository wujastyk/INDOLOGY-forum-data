Hindukadesa
     I am intrigued by a reference to "Hindukadesa" by John Guy (Victoria &
Albert Museum, London) in his description of a Jain manuscript (c.1400)
recounting the exploits of a Jain monk named Kalaka. Hindukadesa was invaded
in the first century B.C.E., according to Guy, by a people from Central
Asia--the Sahi (see The Perpetual Liberators: Jain Art from India by
Pratapaditya Pal et al 1994: 203).
     What is the etymology of Hinduka in the above context? Were the Sahi
subsequently "Hinduized?" Because my understanding is that the Sahi dynasty,
which ruled what is now Afhganistan, was the last Hindu dynasty to be
converted to Islam in that part of the world.
