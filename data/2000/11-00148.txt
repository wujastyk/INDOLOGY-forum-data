hayagriva
Dear Richard Thomas -
You inquired about the figure of Hayagriva. Kamala Nayar has written a
dissertation on this figure. It's available through McGill University in
Montreal. You could probably also get her email if you call McGill at
514-398-4121. If you want me to do a search for her email, I can. Please
write me at my email to remind me.
Best of Luck,
Lynken Ghose
