Dear palaniappan,
This matter may be taken up seperately.. b'se We may have to discuss about
some other evidences in connection with some of the earlier maratha kings.
nOw, Sri. Vidya Sankar has raised a point about the date Raja Prathapa
Simhan's Pattabhisekam.
How ever, I am yet receive any reponse from him/other members regarding the
two inscriptions and other Modi Documents cited as the evidences to confirm
the existence of kanchi kamakoti Shankara Mutt at Kumbhakonam.
Thanks
BGS
