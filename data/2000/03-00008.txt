I could also add there is a cursory survey of the uses of -man with
brahman in the early and late RV, discussed in my dissertation, online at
http://vedavid.org/diss/,  use the pull-down menu top left to select
chapter four (4), then 5, and on the right, after selecting 4 or five,
choose the section on mental faculties.  It is brief, but juxtaposes -man,
-cit, and dhii viz. brahman.
Per MW, definitely, a detailed study is warranted!
