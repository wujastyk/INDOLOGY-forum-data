[INDOLOGY] Question about a copper plate
 <A82A8488-62DD-4450-ACA0-71318E512542@yahoo.com>
Dear Anna,
It looks like a 5x5 grid yantra (which might explain the number 25 next 
to the grid). Perhaps if the inscriptions were easier to make out, it 
would be possible to identify it more precisely. There does not seem to 
be any obvious connection to games, though the Yantracint?ma?i does 
contain a similar yantra for achieving success in games (yantra no. 73). 
It is inscribed on an 8x8 grid which is navigated by a knight's tour 
(v?jikrama). This means that you place a chess-knight in one space, and 
then jump around the grid according to the knight's move until you have 
landed on all the squares without landing on the same square twice. If 
you do it correctly, the resulting series of 64 syllables go together to 
form two ?lokas which can be used as a mantra to ensure success in 
games.
Best,
Jacob
