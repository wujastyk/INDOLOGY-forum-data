Dear Indology list,

I was sorry to learn today of the sad demise of Pr. Laksmi Thathachar <http://tamil.sampspeak.in/2021/05/tributes-to-sri-u-ve-lakshmi-thathachar.html?m=1>, former Director of the Academy of Sanskrit Research in Melkote.
As an early investigator of computerized ?abdabodha, he was a founding father of Sanskrit computational linguistics.
G?rard Huet
