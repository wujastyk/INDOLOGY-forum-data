[INDOLOGY] archeological puzzle
Dear friends,
This article has been making the rounds among yoga and meditation groups recently:
https://www.indiadivine.org/2700-year-old-yogi-samadhi-found-indus-valley-civilization-archaeological-site/
I am aware that the "proto-Siva" interpretation of certain Indus Valley seals has been much contested during the last few decades but have no knowledge of the other material discussed here.  If you know of pertinent references to reliable sources that will help to shed light on this, I would be most grateful.
best regards,
Matthew
