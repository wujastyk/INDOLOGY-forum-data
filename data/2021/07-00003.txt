Dear list members,

just two small additions to the already very useful pointers on
modality:

Within the vy?pti discussions of Buddhist logicians, it might be useful
to focus on the ?all-inclusive pervasion relations?
(sarvopasa?h?ra-vy?pti).  Kano and Sakai have recently discussed
struggles within the post-Dharmak?rtian tradition to account for how the
most prominent type of this pervasion, the one between existence and
momentariness, undermines the trair?pya requirement.[1]

A second thing to consider in this regard could be arguments involving
the impossibility of positing opposing properties
(?viruddha-dharma-adhy?sa? or similar).  This impossibility, it seems to
me, derives from the strong notion ?These properties can?t possibly
coexist?, rather than from ?These properties just never happen to occur
together.?  But of course, it would all depend on the reasons given for
the impossibility of their co-existence.
