I meant to add that Auvai Turaic?my Pi??ai, however, considers aruvi ?mpal a case of ve?ippa?ai.

Dear JLC,

 

Thank you for mentioning the interesting case of aruvi ?mpal. If one goes by the definition of ve?ippa?ai as given in the Tamil Lexicon that the meaning of an ambiguous word should be disambiguated by a qualifying word, then aruvi ?mpal does not conform to that definition since in the case of aruvi ?mpal in Pati??uppattu 63, aruvi is really made up of aru+vi, a compound. Moreover, the expression a?ai a?uppu a?iy? is already there to clarify that ?mpal is a number and not a flower. Thus, aruvi simply provides information in addition to a?ai a?uppu a?iy? that ?mpal is not a flower. The modern commentator Aru?ampalava??r also does not call it ve?ippa?ai. 

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
