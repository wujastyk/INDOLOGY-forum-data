A very rich collection of references to the ear is:
Boll?e, Willem B., 2010. Remarks on the cultural history of the ear in India. Pp. 141-167 in: Balbir, Nalini (ed.) 2010. Svasti: Essays in honour of Professor Hampa Nagarajaiah for his 75th birthday. Bangalore: K. S. Muddappa Smaraka Trust. 
On p. 145 Boll?e discusses the form of the ear, starting with ?Kar?a ?Longear? (?)? and ?Vikar?a ?With widely extended ears?? ? ?Long ears are a positive mark of Mah?v?ra (?); such people, however, are to be excluded from the sacrifice to the dead.? ?
Best wishes for a Happy New Year 2022,
