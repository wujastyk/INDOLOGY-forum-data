Dear Joanna,
I suspect that all *var?a*s participated in the "Mantra period" era
ceremonies although with different ritual roles/restrictions. When the
Spalding Symposium lectures go online, I talk a bit about my preliminary
research on this subject. In short, I think *var?a *as represented in the
Sa?hit?s is a radically different institution with virtually none of the
associations that it would have by the Dharmas?tras. In the R?jas?ya as we
have it, I don't think we can equate the figure of the *vai?ya* with a
particular "professional type" just yet.
Best,
Caley
