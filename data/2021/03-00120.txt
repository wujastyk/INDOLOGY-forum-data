=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Mah=C4=81bh=C4=81rata_11.24.17?=
Dear list members,
I apologize in advance for my shameless request.
I need to find out the page number of Mah?bh?rata 11.24.17 in the BORI
edition. It's the following stanza:
aya? sa ra?anotkar?? p?nastanavimardana? /
n?bhy?r?jaghanaspar?? n?v?visra?sana? kara? //
I have searched through archive.org. One of the available pdfs of the BORI
Mah?bh?rata is marked as the eleventh book, but it is a mistake.
I would be very grateful if someone could help me.
With best wishes (and my eyes fixed on the tips of my shoes in
embarrassment),
Gaia Pintucci
