Dear colleagues,
this brings the news from the Toyo Bunko (Oriental Library), Tokyo, 
which I post via my husband's account. I am YOSHIMIZU Chizuko, Professor 
of Tibetan and Buddhist Studies, University of Tsukuba. The Tibetan 
research group of the Toyo Bunko led by myself launched the project to 
digitize the Manuscript Kanjur brought by KAWAGUCHI Ekai and preserved 
at the Toyo Bunko. It is our great pleasure to announce the publication 
of the images of the six volumes of dKon brtsegs (Ratnak??a) section 
with introductions, catalogue, and references in collaboration with 
Prof. Jonathan Silk of Leiden University, Prof. Helmut Tauscher, Dr. 
Markus Viehbeck, and Dr. Bruno Lain? of the University of Vienna.
The database is directly accessible at the site:

or at the Toyo Bunko repository, Tibetan Digital Library, where some 
e-Texts of indigenous Tibetan works and previous publications of Tibetan 
studies are also available:
