Dear all,

I am looking for intertextual references for the use of ?lobh? guru? in the text I am studying by an early-modern Jain Braj author.
Besides a Hindi proverb (lobhi guru l?lci cel? do? narak me? thelam thel?), several popular sources ascribe the following witty verse to Kab?r.
'guru lobh? sikha l?lc? dono? khele d??v. dono? bapure b??dah? ca?hi patthar k? n?v?.
Can anyone tell me where the verse might come from? I could not find it in the B?jak or Millennium V???.

Thank you very much!
