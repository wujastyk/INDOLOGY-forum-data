[INDOLOGY] Central Asia/Silk Roads Maps
Dear Indologists,
Maybe someone can help me. I need a few maps of Silk Roads and Eastern and
Western Central Asia Buddhist centres. Do you know any website where I can
find good quality maps or can you submit any scan of 2-3 maps of this
geographical area?
Best wishes,
Paolo
