Hi Jim,
The older Vedic references to ??????? ???? ??????? ????? have been
continuously reinterpreted. ??????? ???????? ?????????????????????: is an
explanation that we see in pre-Bhartr?hari sources. With Bhartr?hari begins
the expansion into ????????, ?????? and ????? to which ??? gets added at
some point. You have raised an interesting question about the origin of the
word ?????, if it is a Sanskritized Prakrit word.  The Sanskrit verb
??????? seems to appear as ?????? in Hindi and ?????? in Marathi. I don't
know how far back in Prakrit this can be attested. But looking at the word
?????, I would not be surprised if it has a Prakrit origin.
