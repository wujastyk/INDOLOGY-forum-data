   Dear all,
   Long note here, please read at your own risk. The ca. 5th Century
Khotanese Buddhist compendium, the so-called *Book of Zambasta,* contains a
short but fascinating tirade against the Sanskrit epics (translation mine):
*c? B?rat? py???u kye arth? samu tta?dya pa?jsa na?aune h?????ai p?ra
Ka?sad?ysna bi??? ???ra jsat?nd?tt? v? bi??? Vy?ys? ri?ay? n?te
K?l?asundhare b?s?hvanaino ?hau ha?baste tcamna lova bitandaR?m? Da?agr?vi
S?ysau n?te La?gg? k?nthai b?stettye k???na j?v?tu rruste R?m?y?n? ttand?
arthi Valm?ki r??ay? ha?baste ha?tsa dr?gyau h??e cv? lovi m?nya py???e
samu ha?daraysa?thva karma*
What has been heard by you in the *[Mah?]Bh?rata*, whose point [is] only
that five men,
Sons of a relative (?), [together] with Ka?sad?sa killed all the heroes,
These [things] the seer Vy?sa, the servant of K???sundar?, gathered;
He composed a fabulous tale by which the people of the world are misled.
[From] R?ma Da?agr?va took S?t?, he led her to the city of La?k?,
For this reason he lost his life. Such is the point of the *R?m?ya?a*.
The seer Valm?ki composed it but together with lies.
That the world listens to him with [any] respect is only [due to] the deeds
of [his] other births.
  Many things are noteworthy here, especially the contemptuous tone that
the text strikes by referring to K???a as the "slave of Ka?sa" (cfr. *Mbh*
9.60.27 *ka?sad?sasya d?yada* and *Vi??upur??a* 5.27.13) and by bringing up
the Buddhist satirical version of the story of Vy?sa and Ambik?, which
involves the former being infatuated with the latter, and the latter
kicking him in response (cfr. *Buddhacarita* 4.16; *Saundarananda* 7.30).
  What interests me here, though, is the form of the name of S?t?. The
Khotanese *S?ysau* should be acc.sing. for a *ka*-suffixed stem *S?ysa?*-=/
*si:za.a:*/ (*-a?>ak?*), but conceivably also for a simple thematic stem
*S?ys?-=/si:za:/* (these generally end in -o, but even in Old Khotanese
there is a noticeable o/au oscillation). In the much later "Khotanese
*R?m?ya?a*" (9th Century?) the name appears as *S?js?-=/si:dza:/*, but this
is probably an indigenous Khotanese development.
  To me the most promising way to explain the form S?ys? has to do with the
vast number of G?ndh?r? loanwords present in Khotanese: in G?ndh?r? /z/ is,
among others, the outcome of intervocalic OIA [th] and [dh], so that
OIA *bodhi>
*G?ndh?r? *<bosi>=*/bozi/ *and OIA *?amatha> G?ndh?r? <?amasa>=*/??m?z?/*.
The Khotanese form could be made sense of by postulating a source form
**S?th?* or **S?dh?* (or **S?thak?*/**S?dhak?*) for a hypothetical G?ndh?r?
*<*sisa*>=*/*si:za:*/, neither of which seems to be attested. **S?s?* would
of course also be a candidate.
  However, under entry "13428. *s?t?* f.  'furrow, goddess of agriculture'
" Turner's *Comparative Dictionary* mentions a form *sih?* 'furrow' from
the Bhalesi language spoken in central Kashmir, which may conceivably act
in support of my hypothesis in view of its geographic proximity to ancient
Gandh?ra proper: here we would have [th/dh]>/h/ instead of Gandh?r?
[th/dh]>/z/.
  Is anyone aware of (other) Middle Indo-Aryan or New Indo-Aryan versions
of the name of S?t? that may point in a similar direction?
