You might look at some of the earlier work of John Kelly, a linguistic and
cultural anthropologist at the University of Chicago, who has done
extensive work on Fiji and India (not the Philippines, but Fiji, much
further out in the Pacific Ocean), as well as maintaining an interest in
Sanskrit. A sample of his relevant publications is below, and more may be
