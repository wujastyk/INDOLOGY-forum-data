A highlight of my time in India after the WS conference in 1997 was an invitation to Melkote. He and his team were wonderful and gracious hosts. I echo Dominik?s comments regarding the meals.
It was a very meaningful week. His personal concern for me and support of my work making Vedic texts available for free on the Internet was both inspiring and touching.
