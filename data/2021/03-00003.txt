    >>              >>         have been Ta. pANan2. It is also possible that 
    >> in the Kannada
    >>              >>         and Telugu areas 'pANa-' was being pronounced 
    >> as 'bANa' either
    >>              >>         independently or influenced by the

    >>              >>         in perumpANan2 as '-bANan2' .  Once the
