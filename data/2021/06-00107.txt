Dear colleagues,
With apologies for self-promotion, I would like to announce the 
publication of my book, /The Yoga of the Matsyendrasa?hit?/, a critical 
edition and annotated translation of core chapters of a probably 
13-century ?aiva tantric yoga text.
/The Yoga of the Matsyendrasam?hit?. A critical edition and annotated 
translation of chapters 1?13 and 55./ Csaba Kiss. Collection Indologie 
n? 146 / Hat?ha Yoga Series n? 1, Institut Fran?ais de Pondich?ry / 
Ecole fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient, 608 p., ISBN: 978-81-8470-239-2 (IFP) 
/ 978-2-85539-241-7 (EFEO). For details visit:
