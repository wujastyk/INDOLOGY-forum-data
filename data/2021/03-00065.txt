Dear Colleagues,
Might I be able to lean on one of you to send a .pdf/digital copy of the following article?  I have tried my university library and the other usual digital resources to no avail.
Brunner, H., ?Le s?dhaka, personnage oubli? du ?iva?sme du sud?,  Journal Asiatique, pp. 411-43 (1975).
Thank you.
Sincerely,
John
