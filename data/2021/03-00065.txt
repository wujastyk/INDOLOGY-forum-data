Dear Colleagues,

Might I be able to lean on one of you to send a .pdf/digital copy of the following article?  I have tried my university library and the other usual digital resources to no avail.

Brunner, H., ?Le s?dhaka, personnage oubli? du ?iva?sme du sud?,  Journal Asiatique, pp. 411-43 (1975).

Thank you.

Sincerely,
John
