Dear all,
Outside of Pali contexts, it is normally treated as a dvandva, and indeed k?ema is understood as safe-guarding or securing (parirak?a?am, parip?lanam).  Standard commentarial glosses are of the type:
alabdhal?bho yoga?, labdhaparirak?a?a? k?ema? (Madhus?dana on BhG 2.45)
yogak?emau = alabdhal?bha-labdhaparip?lane  (Anarghar?ghavapa?cik? 2.40)
yogo.alabdhal?bha? ? k?ema? labdhaparirak?a?a? (??varapratyabhij??viv?tivimar?in?, p. 240)
Kau?ilya 6.2.1 provides a definition:
KA?06.2.01/ ?amavy?y?mau yogak?emayor yoni? //
KA?06.2.02/ karm?rambh???? yog?r?dhano vy?y?ma? //
KA?06.2.03/ karmaphalopabhog?n?? k?em?r?dhana? ?ama? //
KA?06.2.04/ ?amavy?y?mayor yoni? ???gu?yam //
KA?06.2.05/ k?aya? sth?na? v?ddhir ity uday?s tasya //
1. Rest and exertion form the basis of enterprise and security.*
2. Exertion consists of the enterprise that one furnishes to activities that are being undertaken.
3. Rest consists of the security that one furnishes to the enjoyment of the fruits of one?s activities.
4. The basis of rest and exertion is the sixfold strategy (> 7.1.2).
5. Its outcomes are decline, stability, and prosperity.  (tr. Olivelle 2013)
Olivelle?s note thereon:
?Rest . . . security : The translation of the compound yogak?ema poses several problems. As a single concept, it often refers to security or security measures. Thus, at MDh 9.219, yogak?ema is one of the items that cannot be divided during the partitioning of an inheritance, and there it clearly refers to security measures, such as fences for fields and houses. In the Vedic usage, yoga referred to the trek, when the people were on the move in search of wealth, while k?ema referred to a time of encampment and rest in a defensive position. I think this dual meaning of the compound is prominent in the A?. In this passage, rest (?ama) is connected to k?ema, and exertion (vy?y?ma) to yoga. I have regularly translated the compound as a dual, unless the context dictates otherwise (e.g., 1.13.7, 8; 3.11.3).?
And 1.4.3 suggests that the compound provides the basis (the first half) of da??an?ti:
?nv?k?ik?tray?v?rtt?n?? yogak?emas?dhano da??a?, tasya n?tir da??an?ti?, alabdhal?bh?rth? labdhaparirak?a?? rak?itavivardhan? v?ddhasya t?rthe pratip?dan? ca //
3. What provides enterprise and security (6.2.1 n.) to critical inquiry, the Triple [i.e., Veda], and economics is punishment (da??a); its administration (n?ti) is government (da??a-n?ti). Government seeks to acquire what has not been acquired, to safeguard what has been acquired, to augment what has been safeguarded, and to bestow what has been augmented on worthy recipients
It is thus the king?s duty is to provide an environment in which those complementary goals can be pursued:
Hence yogak?ema?abdena yogak?emak?ri?o r?jamantripurohit?daya ucyante iti kecit? (Mit. ad Y?j?Dh 2.119)
But the deity may also be appealed to for success:
Y?j?avalkyaDh 1.100ab (99ab in Olivelle?s edition):
upey?d ??vara? caiva yogak?em?rthasiddhaye |
?He may, furthermore, approach the lord for success in the aims of acquiring and safeguarding.?
Mit?k?ar? thereon: alabdhal?bho yoga?, labdhaparip?lana? k?ema, tadartham upey?d up?s?ta |
N?r?ya?a on the N?larudra Up. 1.3, speaking of Rudra?s activities:
anena k?emak?ritvam uktam | alabdhal?bho yogas ? so ?pi te tav?p?rval?bhakaro ?py etv ?gacchatu yogak?emakaro ?bhi?ekajale sa?nihito bhavatv ity arthah.

Dear Matthew,
For several excerpts from the Pali Kanon which are compared with Sanskrit sources (on yogakkhema/yogak?ema) see also:

Yes, thank you, Patricia, - it has been widely.
To the list more generally -
There is one question it raises for me, not about Weingast's fantasies, but about K. R. Norman's
translation cited herein. In the first verse quoted, he renders yogakkhema (= Skt. yogak?ema) as "rest-from-exertion". Charles Hallisey, in his recent translation of the same work https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674427730<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hup.harvard.edu%2Fcatalog.php%3Fisbn%3D9780674427730&data=04%7C01%7CLubinT%40wlu.edu%7C8413065617cc4b25135208d8c137ffb2%7Cd1a80622a99943e58eb67873905e939e%7C1%7C0%7C637471793559071993%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=SxSsMpQQNpV05xHWK5qISt36yulRfuS%2FqsXrK4QNMQ8%3D&reserved=0>
gives "safety," which seems more plausible to me in light of the Sanskrit usage.
I would be grateful for any insights you might have into Norman's treatment of the term and, more generally, into the semantic range of the curious expression yogak?ema. Tibetan lexicographers, by the way, treated it as having the meanings "accomplished" (grub-pa = siddha) and "comfort/ease/happiness" (bde-ba = sukha).
best to all,
Matthew
