[INDOLOGY] Help with a simile
???Dear Jim,
I was just looking at this verse recently when considering different definitions of ha?ha and I wonder whether perhaps the verbs are the issue rather than the simile? I?m sure you probably know more about this than I do, but it seems to me that once the ku??alin? is awakened (which I know can take some force) it should actually arise quite easily like a key unlocks a door?
Best wishes,
Zo?
