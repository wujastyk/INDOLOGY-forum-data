Hi,
I wrote to Andrew Ollett (U. Of Chicago) regarding  ?vaikhar?? in Prakrit. He replied as below. I got his permission to post his reply as it adds to the discussion (and may in fact show that we might not be able to track the proper history of this word with current knowledge.)

Dear Jim (if I may),
I saw the discussion on INDOLOGY but didn't have too much to add. Mayrhofer interprets it, sensibly, as if it had come from a hypothetical Middle Indic form (I don't say "Prakrit" for reasons that will become clear) *vi-k?arati, which is also the etymology of the Hindi word bikharn? "scatter." The P?iyasaddamaha??ava <https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdsal.uchicago.edu%2Fdictionaries%2Fsheth%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cjryan%40ciis.edu%7Ca5bf7e180e1048c9f82308d998a58739%7C34d667e31c5d4101b901e5d9fd8d69d9%7C0%7C0%7C637708658969521889%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=uMi946zgBY9cYLnoHkGauScJiAFFrP%2FU17lVDxs0DJo%3D&reserved=0>, an early dictionary of Prakrit, does give vikkhara- as a verbal stem, meaning to "scatter" or "spread," attested apparently in the Uv??gadas?o, an early Jain text. But in fact the usual "Prakrit" form of the root that appears in Sanskrit as *k?ar is jhar-. In fact, in the Prakrit texts I have (i.e., literary Prakrit, produced between the second and the twelfth centuries), I find neither vikkhara- or vijjhara-. While we're at it, an origin from *vikr?ta- might be entertained as well.
None of this, in any case, would explain why Bhartr?hari should have chosen to use a Middle Indic form, or a form derived from Middle Indic, for a major element of his theory, especially when there was a Sanskrit term easily to hand. I know of no citations of vaikhar? or similar words (*v?khar?, *vekkhar?, *va?khar?, *vehar?, *vikkhar?*, etc.) in Prakrit.
I hope this helps, although I suspect it won't!
Andrew
