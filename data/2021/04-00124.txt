Dear All,

After waffling about a bit on whether to promote myself or not, I have
decided to go ahead and do so. In short, this is my etic method for
approaching the Vedic texts with an ultimate goal of using this method to
recover emic textuality subtly embedded in language, performative frames,
and formal organization.
