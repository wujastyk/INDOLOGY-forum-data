Some more context might help. Here is a video from 1929, in which one can
see the bamboo poles tied together.
https://www.britishpathe.com/video/acrobatics-1/query/indian+acrobatics and
the relative height of the pole compared to the buildings.
Here are some images from the ACK rendering of Uggasena's tale. As well as
some images from a book on India from the 19th century and some photos from
the 20th century. The ACK images look more like a contemporary mallakhamb
pole made from teak or rosewood than the bamboo poles clearly used in the
photos and mentioned in primary sources. In the photos, the poles seem
approximately 4?5 meters long. 27 meters just seems wildly inaccurate.
