Dear Jim,
For what it's worth, Bhartr?hari uses the term Vaikr?ta Dhvani for the
diversely manifested phonetic output. So Ollett's suggestion that "an
origin from *vikr?ta- might be entertained as well" may be on track.
Bhartr?hari also uses the expression vyavak?r?a in the sense of scattered
or disfigured. This is what happened to the divine speech at the hands of
incapable speakers - "daiv? v?k vyavak?r?eyam a?aktair abhidh?tr?bhi?". So
in my opinion Skt vi+kr?? > vikirati is also a possible candidate for the
origin of vaikhar? via some MIA transformation returning back to Sanskrit
like the word -geha.
