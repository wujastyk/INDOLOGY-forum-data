Dear colleagues,
I am working with my student Marine Schoettel to prepare an edition and translation of a major (14-plate) charter of 15th-century Java, that contains quite a number of Sanskrit stanzas, interspersed between Old Javanese prose passages. Besides the k?vya stanzas of the royal genealogy, that were certainly locally composed, there are some (possibly Indian) dharma??stra stanzas at the end of the text, where we read, toward the end of the charter:
yatikoma?gu(13v4)hakna vipar?tani? brahmamukhodita saptavr?ddhi, ndya ta lvirannya //
XXXII. [anu??ubh]
    ?yurh?nir yya?oh?ni?, h?ni? praj??sukha?riy??*,
    dharmmasant?(13v5)nah?ni? ca, santu te saptah?naya? //
We translate:
'They will encounter what are [called] the opposites of the seven gains enunciated orally by Brahm?, as follows: "Loss of vitality, loss of glory, loss of wisdom, happiness, and fortune, loss of dharma and progeny; those shall be the seven losses!" '
I am unable to locate the saptah?ni stanza in my e-text corpus. I am hoping that one of you may be able to.
Also, I am unable to find any (relevant) occurrences of the expression saptavr?ddhi, and am curious if my impression that the Old Javanese is alluding to a text ascribed to Brahm? can somehow be confirmed from the Sanskrit tradition.
Thank you.
