Dear All,



(Apologies for cross-posting)



It is our great pleasure to announce the first ?Heidelberg Indology
Doctoral Symposium?(HeiIDS). The symposium is organised by the doctoral
students of the Department of Cultural and Religious History of South Asia,
South Asia Institute, Heidelberg University. It will be a hybrid event (if
the situation allows), taking place on 12-13 November, 2021, in Heidelberg.
We aim to make this a recurring event that will provide young researchers a
platform to share their research and ideas in a constructive environment.



The experience of disruption in all walks of life since last year has
inspired the theme of this year?s symposium. We invite papers dealing with
?Disruption? in South Asia from doctoral students of Indology and South
Asian Studies. You can find the call for papers on the following link:

Abstracts (of 500 words) due August 16, 2021, using the link:

We look forward to receiving your abstracts submissions, and having you
attend. Please pass on to any PhD students who may be interested.



Best,


Kush (on behalf of the organising team)
