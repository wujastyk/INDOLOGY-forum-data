[INDOLOGY] Source of a half stanza
Dear list members,
I encountered this half stanza:
and could not find a specific source for it.
Of course it could be one of those sayings that just float around, but if
anyone should have a suggestion about a (likely) source, I would be happy
to hear it.
All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
