Dear list members,
The anun?sika as printed  in Weber's edition of ?atapatha-brahma?a in
Madhyandina-?akha is similar but slightly different from the versions
of  anun?sika/anusvara
in the Unicode  Vedic Extensions block.  Can someone identify which
character in the Unicode Vedic Extensions block the  anun?sika in Weber's
?atapatha-brahma?a corresponds to.  See attached pdf.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
