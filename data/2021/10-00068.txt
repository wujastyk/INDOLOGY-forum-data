[INDOLOGY] Question about a copper plate
 <E7FFBB99-7CD7-4CF9-ACA1-A790535F190A@yahoo.com>
I am attaching Rivi?re's French translation of the Yantracint?ma?i from 
1976 with all the yantras beautifully drawn up in red ink. That is, of 
course, only a drop in the ocean of yantras, but at least it is a good 
place to start. The text was critically edited by Hans-Georg T?rstig in 
1988, but I do not have a digital scan at hand.
I would be happy to take a second look at the yantra if you manage to 
decipher the inscriptions in more detail.
Best,
Jacob
