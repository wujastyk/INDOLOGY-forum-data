Dear Dan,
I didn?t come across any references to the S??mit?yas in Vanaratna?s rnam thars or related materials. In a conversation reported in ??kya mchog ldan?s rnam thar, Vanaratna tells the adolescent ??kya mchog ldan that he was ordained as a Sarv?stiv?din, and gZhon nu dpal identifies this as the vinaya lineage he received at the Mah?caitya Vih?ra in Sadnagara. Given the time period I think we can safely assume this means the M?lasarv?stiv?din. That said, there are traces of P?li and Therava?sa influences in Vanaratna?s early narrative (heavily obscured by the Tibetan biographers, if not Vanaratna himself), so I suspect the situation was much more complex than the rnam thars let on. 
Vanaratna is reported to have received a broad Mah?y?na-Vajray?na education in Sadnagara before leaving home for his life of epic travel, but whether the extent of his education described in the rnam thars marks a deliberate attempt to bolster his credentials for his Tibetan audience (or by his Tibetan audience) is a question I address but don?t fully resolve. It does seem that a Mahay?na-Vajray?na education was still available in the region at the turn of the fifteenth century, but the quality and extent of it is uncertain.
Best wishes,
Ryan
