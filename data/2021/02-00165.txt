Dear JLC,

Thank you for this link. I should acknowledge that long time ago, it was Rajam who pointed out this type of usage in Classical Tamil to me. It should also be noted that some commentators call this technique by the term 've?ippa?ai'. This is how Tamil Lexicon explains the term, "(Rhet.) A figure of speech in which the meaning of an ambiguous word is made clear by the use of a qualifying word, as p?y?- v??kai; ????????? ?????????? ?????? ??? ???????? ??????????????????? ???????? ??? ?????????? ?????? ??????. (?????. 17, ???.)" It should be noted that by this definition, even affirmatively explaining a homonym is called 've?ippa?ai'.  Indeed, the example cited by the Tamil Lexicon is one such usage in Pu?am 17.13, i.e., 'a?u poruna' making clear that by 'poruna' the warrior-king is indicated and not a bard. The commentators also use this term in regards to 'p?v? va?ci (Pu?am 32.2), u??a n??cil (Pu?am 139.8), and ur?ak kutirai (Pu?am 168.14). However, one can see that most of the examples use NAP in these usages.

That is why I was surprised that commentators like V??ka?ac?mi N????r missed the significance of the expression 'e??ap p??a?'. 

Regards,
Palaniappan
