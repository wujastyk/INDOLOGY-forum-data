Dear list members,
I thank all of you who have responded via the list or via email.
With respect to
"Johann Jakob Meyer: Das altindische Buch vom Welt- und Staatsleben.  
Das Arthacastra des Kautilya, Leipzig 1926"
Mark Clish was so kind to send me a pdf of Meyer's Vorwort and  
Einleitung. For the translation, see Tim Lubin's remark below.
Concerning
"DevaNabhaTTa: SmRticandrikA, vyavahArakANDa, Part III"
I learned from Patrick Olivelle that such a third part does  n o t   
exist in Sanskrit. I was confused because Gharpure's translation has  
three parts. The subject matter of the third part (translation)  
corresponds to pages 561-721 of the Mysore edition (edited by L.  
Srinivasacharya) where it belongs to part II. Gharpure's own edition  
(for PDFs thank you to Tim) follows the order of the Mysore edition.
All the best from Leipzig
Harald Wiese
