Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Dr. Sally Sutherland Goldman and I are happy to announce the publication of a single, unabridged paperback edition of the Princeton University Press? original seven-volume translation of the Baroda Critical Edition of the V?lm?ki R?m?yana, which appeared serially from 1986 to 2017.  The translation was a collaborative effort on the part of the two of us together with Professors Sheldon Pollock, Ros Lefeber, and B. A. van Nooten.

The present volume, newly revised and edited, contains a new introduction, the translation of the complete text of the Critical Edition along with a guide to Sanskrit pronunciation, a comprehensive index, a bibliography, and glossaries of important names and terms and of weapons. It does not include the dense and massive scholarly annotation of the original publication as it is intended for the use of non-specialist scholars, students, and general readers.  The paperback runs to 943 pp. and is priced at USD 27.95.

Best wishes to you all for  a pleasant holiday season and a safe, healthy, happy  and productive New Year.

Bob Goldman
