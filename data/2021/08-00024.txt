[INDOLOGY] Article needed
Dear colleagues,
Due to (ongoing!) library closures I have been unable to locate the
following article:
G. von Simson, "Die Buddhas der Vorzeit: Versuch einer
astralmythologischen Deutung," *Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik *7,
1981, pp. 77-91.
I would appreciate it if anyone could provide a copy.
Thanks in advance,
Rich Salomon
