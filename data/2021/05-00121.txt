Interesting that in some of those citations, Dan, sutta is in the
singular.  That suggests, to me, a genre rather than "texts".  (I'm not on
secure ground here;  my Pali grammar is a bit rusty.)
On another topic, my teacher Richard Gombrich also taught me that sutta
could be *<s?kta .  But I'd like to note that he wasn't dogmatic about it.
It was represented as a possibility.
Best,
Dominik
