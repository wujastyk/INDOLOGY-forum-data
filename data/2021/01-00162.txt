Dear friends,

Is there a system of proper terms used for the penstrokes of devan?gar?
or other Indic scripts?

In particular, is there a standard term for the horizontal overbar/overline/headline used in written and printed devan?gar?? We sometimes see da??a  not only for the punctuation mark, but for the right-hand vertical bar in kha, ga and other letters. And some ligatures do have distinct names that are well known, e.g. repha.

Modern Hindi work on typography does sometimes have ?irorekh?
for the headline, but I suspect that this is a recent calque from English and not a traditional scribal term.
However, I am uncertain about it and wish to verify the traditional usage.

any light will be appreciated,
Matthew
