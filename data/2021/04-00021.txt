Subject: [INDOLOGY] ligature in grantha script
Message-ID: <66a38bc2-1565-e0f6-1eaf-09b31f199347@mi.parisdescartes.fr>

Bonjour,

In an 18th century manuscript I found a ligature "rya" (see attached 
document) which is not as this ligature is supposed to be in grantha: 
the ligature r-y does not follow the same rule as for other letters 
(d-y, t-y etc.) but here r is treated as the other letters.

Is it a scribe mistake or does this ligature exists (or has existed) as 
a variant?

Thank you.
