> One more remark on the v?l??p p?rppa? and the other examples given mentione by you. From these constructions it would appear that the terms p?rppa?, porunar and p??a? refer to something like a (sub)caste called p?r?ppa? etc, whose members are not restricted to brahmins performing sacrificial duties. However, before being able to say something more in this line we have to have more examples of this type of compound.

> Dear Palaniappan,
> I think your interpretation of e?? p??a? is correct, as is that of por?a porunar. I like to add another instance of this type of compound (about this, more below), from AN 24:v?l??p p?rppa? Wilden's (ad hoc) interpretation of this compound runs as follows: we would have to do with a non-sacrificing brahmin (p?rppa?) making a living by, in this case, cutting bangles, when he is unable to do so by officiating at sacrifices. Also here, your interpretation applies: we have to do with a craftsman referred by the same name as a brahmin priest. The craftsman is distinguished from the latter byv?l??.

> I recently came across Auvai Turaic?mip Pi??ai?s interpretation of some key details of Akam 113, and Akam 226. He makes these comments in his introduction to the decad called P??a? Pattu of his commentary on Ai?ku?un??u (1958: 1028-29). (See attachment.) I do not know if he has provided detailed commentaries for the two poems.
>  
> With respect to Akam 113, Pillai says that the ruler P??a? belonged to a section of the bardic community of the P??ar that did not engage in music and dance but excelled in wrestling and ruling the land. He refers to Perump??app??i, etc., which we had discussed earlier in the thread. Pillai adds that the descendants of that P???? were later called  V??ar, V???tir?yar, V??ataraiyar, and V??ak?varaiyar. Pillai?s interpretation has been accepted by many later scholars such as Ve. Varatar?can (1973: 15) and Ir?. I?a?kumara? (1987: 141). This confirms my interpretation of e??a in Akam 113.17 as 'not making music?. (For the affirmative use of e??i in the sense of music making, see Pati??uppattu 29.7-8.) 
>  
> In this context, it should be noted that the critical edition of Akan????u by Eva Wilden (2018) interprets the text ?e??[a]p p??a?? as ?the bard who does not rise?. In my view, Wilden got only half of it right. She is right to translate p??a? as ?the bard?. But, Wilden has interpreted e?? as deriving from DEDR 851 e?u- 'to rise'. It should be related to DEDR 5156 y??, ???, stringed musical instrument; e?u- 'to emit sound?? The correct interpretation is ?the bard who does not play the lute/make music?. This usage is the converse of 'por?ap porunar' in Pu?am 386.19, where 'non-fighting warriors? is used to refer to bards, where both the bards and warriors can be denoted by the word ?porunar?.
>  
> One may argue that the fact Akam 113 uses ?e??[a]? to describe ?P??a?? may simply indicate the homophonous nature of the name of the ruler ?P??a?? and the word for the bard, ?p??a?,? and not necessarily show that the ruler was of bardic origin.  But, we know that the bards had received villages as gifts from Pu?am 302. But, with respect to bards receiving a bigger territory, we have that possibility supported by Ci?up?????uppa?ai 109 according to which the chief ?ri  gave ?the good country with small hills to K??iyar?. Pillai (1958: 1030) states that depending on what they did, P??ar were known by several names such as P??ar, Akavunar, K?ttar, K??iyar, Iyavar, and Porunar. In a similar manner, the P??ar could have received some territory in the northern border area of the Tamil region, which could have become the base of the P??ar, who later became the B??as.
>  
> As for the bards becoming warriors, it is not impossible for one to have both skills. In the famous Tanjavur temple inscription South Indian Inscriptions, vol 2, no.66, there are several members of the crack troops of ??jar?ja I (Terinta Vala?kai V??aikk?rar, Terinta Parikk?rar) who have been given grants as musicians (pp.299-300).
>  
> The dynastic drift of the B??as from the northern Tamil border area into Telugu or Kannada regions is nothing unusual. As I already noted in an earlier post, a branch of C??as settled in the Cudappah district of the Telugu region in the 7thcentury can be seen to drift all the way to Sonepur in South Kosala (Orissa) in the 12th century Mahad? plates of Somesvaradevavarman.
>  
> In Akam 226, Pillai does not interpret P??a? as an ally of Ka??i who fled without fighting in the court of the C??a king Titta? Ve?iya?. Rather, it was P??a?, who was in the court of the Ch??a king, the intended adversary of Ka??i. Modern scholars like V??ka?ac?mi N????r and R. V??ka??calam P?llai (1946: 454) unnecessarily add a word ?k??i? meaning ?having joined? to ?P??a?o?u? to come up with the misinterpreted meaning. The verb ?poru? ?to fight? is preceded by the adversary being fought/intended to be fought by the subject of the verb with the case marker ?o?u'. Perhaps N????r was influenced by R?. Ir?kavaiya?k?r (1923: 1670), who interpreted P??a? as an ally of Ka??i in his earlier edition. Hart (2015: 232) has followed N?tt?r?s interpretation.

I am still not convinced by what you say about p??ar in the Ku?untokai poem -- after reading many Sangam poems and working through much of the Akananuru, your interpretation just doesn't sound right to me.  Of course, that doesn't mean you aren't correct, but there's really no way to tell.  If the P??ar were standing to one side (or, more likely, in the middle of one side playing their drums), and a battle started, they'd still be looking in front and behind them to avoid being killed.  Thanks for an intriguing and informative analysis.

The modifier 'peru' is found in other names such as perumuttaraiyar (mentioned in nAlaTiyAr), ko-p-peru?-cOzan2, peru?-cEral, etc. The title peru- is very common in Tamil. It was also used in connection with different professions as in perumpANan2 and perunAvican2. Then how about the title bRhad in bRhadbANa?
>  
> First of all, the title bRhad-bANa for a dynasty is very unusual. The only other so-called dynastic title I know of, bRhatphAlAyana, is not a dynastic title at all. In fact, in the case of bRhatphAlAyanas and sAlankAyanas, according to K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, the scholars have simply used the gotra names in the absence of dynastic names.  (Early History of the Andhra Country, p.151, n.1). Moreover, it is only in the tALagunda inscription we find the occurrence of 'bRhad-bANa'. Everywhere else in non-Tamil inscriptions, the members of the dynasty are called bANarAja, bANAdhirAja-. In other words we only find bANa- but not bRhad-bANa. But in Tamil we find many instances of perumpANaraicar, permpANan, etc. 
>  
> This leads one to infer that the author of the tALagunda inscription was simply translating the name perumpANan2 into Sanskrit. Since in Tamil -p- following nasal -m- is pronounced as -b-, the author of tALagunda has rendered the first component as bRhad and kept the second part as bANa. This suggests that the original form of the dynastic name should have been Ta. pANan2. It is also possible that in the Kannada and Telugu areas 'pANa-' was being pronounced as 'bANa' either independently or influenced by the pronunciation of '- pANan2' in perumpANan2 as '-bANan2' .  Once the stand-alone form 'bANa' becomes widespread, a re-branding using a Sanskrit mythological pedigree tracing the lineage to mahAbali, father of bANAsura is carried out with the dynastic title as 'bANa'. Later when this form 'bANa' is imported back into Tamil, Skt. bANa > Ta. vANa-.

>  
> The phrase "ezAap pANan2" further points to the homophon indicating bard as well as the chieftain suggesting in this case that the chieftain was called 'pANan2' too with word-initial p-. 
>  
> As for the domicile and area controlled by the pANan2/bANa chiefs, it has varied historically. They might have started near Gingee where the paRaiyan2paTTu inscription is found mentioning 'pANAtu'. (At least one variant of akam.155 mentions pANATu. See Early Tamil Epigraphy, p. 629 for a discussion of this.) Then they could have moved north so that by the 4th century they are found near zrIparvata hill. After serving the Chalukya, Pallava, and Chola dynasties, in the 13th century, we see bANa chieftains with titles such as mAvali vANAdirAyan, mAbali vANarAyar, etc., controlling parts of the pANTiya country under the pANTiyas. As a parallel case, it should be noted that a branch of the Cholas, Telugu Cholas,  were controlling areas around Sonepur in Orissa in the 12th century issuing inscriptions in Sanskrit tracing their descent to Chola karikAla and uRaiyUr (EI 28, p. 286) progressively moving northeast from the area to the north of the Tamil country over several centuries.

'kaGkan' referred to the Western Ganga dynasty. Vicciyar were also in the northern area. So it is not surprising that pANar allied themselves with vicci or kaTTi.

> As for non-fighters standing between the two armies, I consider it highly unlikely they were standing in between the fighting armies. They have to be really standing on the side while the battle is raging and in that case they will only move their gaze from side to side and not front and back. So I do not think simhAvalokanyAya will be valid here. At least if the description applies to the fighters, then their behavior will parallel the warriors whether it is their fierce look or looking forward and backward, So, the looking persons should be fighters and not bards.
