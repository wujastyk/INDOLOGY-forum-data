This is of course absolutely wonderful news for younger scholars and the field in general, especially since the funding for the South Asia Across the Disciplines  series , which also published first books on the region (not just indology) was finally exhausted. 
Rosane, Patrick et al  at the  Foundation are doing great work for the field. 
Best wishes to all for a pleasant and productive holiday season.
