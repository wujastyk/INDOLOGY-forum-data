Hi,

I?m curious about the term Vaikhar? for articulated speech. In the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies volume on the Grammarians, judging from the index, it seems this term was first used  by Bhart?hari (at least in a grammatical context.) V. S. Apte cites the Mallinatha commentary on Kum?rasa?bhava for an authoritative reference of the word, but that is quite late (15th century.) Firstly, are there instances of this word used with any frequency before Bhart?hari? Secondly, the lexicons give no good verbal root or root word for it. I note that the word vaik?t? as ?alteration? has a similar shape (and wouldn?t fit badly in the ?articulated speech? category of V?c), but I?m presuming that the word  vaikhar? is not a Prakrit-derived form.  So? where and how do we get to this important term in language theory in India, which seems unrelated to any other common root or word?
