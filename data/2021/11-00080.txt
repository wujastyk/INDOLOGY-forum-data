Dear list members,
when looking up the word va?alai in the Tamil Lexicon, I found a reference to a text called c?vara?c?mirutam 344 (j?varak??mr?tam). I have been unable to find out what kind of text it is: a medical text, a text with charms (va?alai would be used in the meaning ground snake here), a text about creepy animals. I hope someone can help me.
With kind regards, Herman.
