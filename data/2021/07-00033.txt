Dr.Bausch.
It was very illuminating to read your explanation of the journey of Vedas to the Upanishads.For an individual seeker of truth, the moment he realises his identity with the unmanifested part of himself&nbsp; he is not only free from punarmrittyu ( as stated by you) ,but also free from punarjama ( Rebirth,) as well.
