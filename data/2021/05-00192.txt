  Hello Patrick,
  The term occurs in act four (4.95), p. 152 in the Shulman/Rao
edition+translation for the Clay Sanskrit Library.
  Mallagha?? is given only as a scenic indication on how a verse is to be
performed, perhaps involving specific modes of song, dance, or pantomime.
  Lyne Bansat-Boudon in p. 97 of her *The?tres indiens* notes that the
commentator Ra?gan?tha says only that *mallagha??* is a "specific mode of
theatrical technique" ("*vari?t? de n??ya*"=*n??yavi?e?a*). This is MW's
source.
  In his preface to his 1961 critical edition of the play, H.D. Velankar
conjectures, on the basis of the etymology, that the "*mallagha??* involved
the use of earthen pitchers (like the Garb? [dance] in Gujar?t)" (p.
lxxxvi). However, I find it unlikely that an "earthen pitcher" would have
been conjured up to perform a single *p?da*, and would be more inclined to
see it simply as a gesture.
  I hope this helps!
  *namaskaromi*,
  Diego
