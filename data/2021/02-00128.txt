[INDOLOGY] Re: Puranas
Dear All,
thank you very much for your private and public comments. Many thanks to
David and Peter for sharing the bibliography for Puranic texts. I didn't
know that all the translations published through Motilal Banarsidass were
based on the Venkatesvara edition. In Rocher (1986), I think, only the *?iva
Pur??a* is said to be based on the Pa??itapustak?laya edition (1963), which
was an emendation of the Vankatesvara edition.
Are there new studies on the date of compilation of these (probably
non-original) Puranas? Following Rocher and Hazra it seems almost
impossible to give any useful and realistic date of compilation.
Best,
Paolo
