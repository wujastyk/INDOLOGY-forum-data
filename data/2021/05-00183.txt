A great scholar indeed. Very rarely we come across such Great Scholars
deeply rooted in the traditional Knowledge systems at the same time very
much conversant with modern technology.
I have seen his software on Sh?bdabodha in 1993 (or maybe in 1994), during
a conference organised by him. This software would generate the
shaabdabodha for a given Sanskrit sentence.
He was very open-minded and of helping nature. When I approached him in
2002-03 informing him about my plan to work on Sanskrit computational
linguistics, he immediately provided me with his word generation software
and asked his technical staff to provide me all the necessary help so that
I could install it on my machine.
Thus under the contributor's list
<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/contributors.html>, of Samsaadhanii,  the
Academy of Sanskrit Research, Melkote goes at the top.
It is a great loss to the field of Sanskrit Studies.
