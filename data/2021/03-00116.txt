Dear Colleagues,
The most recent issue of the journal /Pur??a/ of which I am aware is 
volume 49 (2007).? Does anyone have firm information about whether any 
later volumes have been published or whether it has ceased publication.? 
Also, I am particularly interested in two articles in vol. 45 (2003), 
those by Bob Goldman and by Sally Sutherland Goldman; if anyone has PDFs 
of these I should be grateful to receive them.
Best wishes
John
