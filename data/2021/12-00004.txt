[INDOLOGY] OCR for sanskrit transliteration

Dear Harry,
   The O - Sanskrit CR (pronounced "Seer") also does a tolerably good job
cedillas with dots, etc., as global replacements.  (Just as Diego
suggested.)
   BTW,  S. Ve?ka?ar?ma ??stri's English translation of the B?lar?m?ya?a is
now available on archive.org
Best wishes,
Tim Cahill
