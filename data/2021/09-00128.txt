Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question about Tamil grammar and usage
Message-ID: <0B2E0994-2FBF-44BE-B5AA-9CE4BB58205F@illinois.edu>

Dear Tamil-specialists,

I would appreciate your enlightening me on the following issue

Tamil is reported to have discourse-linkage structures such as the one in (a) below, in which the final verb of an earlier sentence is resumed in the form of a converb (or conjunctive participle) at the beginning of the next sentence. In such structures the [+ human] subjects of the converb and the main verb of the sentence have to be identical.
I understand that, as a consequence, structures like the third line of (b) are unacceptable, because the subject of cey-tu and celv?m are human and not identical. Would the use of the infinitive ceyy-a ? ?um as in (c) improve the sentence or even make it grammatical?
Hoping that some of you will be able to answer my question,

I remain with best wishes to all,

Hans Henrich Hock
