Dear Finnian,
I am very excited to read your article. I cover some of the same territory
(though likely much more broadly) in an article on *sam?dhi *burial
practice coming out this month in *Journal of Hindu Studies*. I'm certain
your work in this article will be very helpful as I push forward on the
book project.
All best to you and congrats on the article.
Mark
