[INDOLOGY] requesting (pages of) Zehnder 1999
Dear colleagues,
I am currently unable to access Thomas Zehnder's edition of
Atharvaveda-Paippal?da, Book 2 (Schulz-Kirchner, 1999). Specifically, I
would like to consult
2.16
2.34
2.37
2.68.
If anyone is able to provide scans of those, I would be very grateful.
Best regards,
Dieter Gunkel
