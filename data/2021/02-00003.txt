Subject: [INDOLOGY] requesting (pages of) Zehnder 1999
Message-ID: <CADVOX3587iNEFxPFTB_TSf_VdSvsuKJHfR+ETZ48Jt1F7PuqEw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I am currently unable to access Thomas Zehnder's edition of
Atharvaveda-Paippal?da, Book 2 (Schulz-Kirchner, 1999). Specifically, I
would like to consult

2.16
2.34
2.37
2.68.

If anyone is able to provide scans of those, I would be very grateful.

Best regards,

Dieter Gunkel
