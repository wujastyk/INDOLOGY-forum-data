HUP Summary: Utpaladeva on the Power of Action provides the first critical edition, annotated translation, and study of the first three chapters of the Recognition of the Lord, a landmark in the history of nondual ?aivism by Utpaladeva, that were recently recovered from marginal annotations in manuscripts of other commentaries on Utpaladeva?s treatise.
