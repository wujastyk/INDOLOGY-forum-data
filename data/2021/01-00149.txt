The Rites of the Twice-Born, by Sinclair Stevenson. Mrs Stevenson was a missionary trying to bring Christianity to Hindu women, so her account obviously reflects her prejudices. But she clearly loved the women themselves, and the book tells you a great deal about both sides of the colonial story and the way of life of upper class Hindus at the time. And it?s by and about women! Hooray!
