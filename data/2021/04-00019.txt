[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit floating in midair
Dear List Members,
I am looking for a passage in a book by Louis Renou in which he writes that Sanskrit literature is floating in midair ? not necessarily in these words, but this is how I remember it. I do not remember, however, where I read it (Histoire de la langue sanskrite?, which booklet I left behind, when I had to vacate my room in the Kern Institute). I hope some one can help me with the location of the passage and the literal text of it.
With kind regards, Herman
