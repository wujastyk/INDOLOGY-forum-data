Dear Madhav,
Pr?krits are literary languages developed within the K?vya literary tradition. They are imitations of the spoken languages (Middle Indic languages) on the basis of Sanskrit. Sanskrit serves as a primer. The tradition started early. However, some of the literary dialects have been developed fairly late: M?h?r???r? on the basis of a kind of a ?aurasen?-like dialect in which intervocalic t had been voiced, Apabhra??a, the language of popular songs sung during festivals on the basis of this M?h?r???r?, the language of the Dhruv? songs .... etc. (see my article in JESHO 51/2 (2008) (pdf on my website). G?ndh?r? was spoken on the fringe and was therefore and for reasons mentioned by Johannes Bronkhorst not included in these linguistic experiments in what basically was a Sanskrit tradition. I think this last argument, that we are dealing with a Sanskrit tradition, is the main point.
