Hi
Reading through Nitti-Dolci?s insightful 1938 survey of Prakrit grammars I have produced a draft schematic overview (PDF attached here I hope) of her main comments for my own use (thought to share just in case it is helpful to anyone else).
I have though, also been trying to locate a copy (hard or soft) of her 1938 thesis (citation below) but the usual sources (internet.archive, Scribd, Abebooks, etc.) have not produced a copy. 
Does anyone have a PDF of this study to share I wonder?
