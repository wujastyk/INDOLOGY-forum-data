I second Madhav's suggestion, as I won't be able to attend but I would have liked to.

One Flew Over the Nest: an Externalist Among Prama?n?ava?dins

Serena Saccone
 University of Naples, ?L?Orientale?

S?ubhagupta (8th cent.) is a key figure within the Buddhist tradition of logic and epistemology (prama?n?a). Most of his works are in fact a systematization, as well as elaboration, of the doctrines and arguments found in Dharmaki?rti?s writings. In this respect, he shares views with (and perhaps also directly influenced) his fellow Buddhist contemporaries, S?a?ntaraks?ita and Kamalas?i?la, who represent the mainstream tradition in the 8th century. On the other hand, as seen in his magnum opus, the ?Verses on the Demonstration of External Objects? (*Ba?hya?rthasiddhika?rika?), S?ubhagupta significantly deviates from that mainstream tradition on some crucial tenets by advocating the existence of external objects and the illogicality that cognitions bear their objects? images (nira?ka?rava?da). The main point of contention appears to be (to some extent) the theory of self-awareness (svasam?vedana) of cognitions. In this lecture, I shall present the pivotal elements of that internal debate, which, arguably, made S?ubhagupta the Buddhist externalist (bahirarthava?din) par excellence for that tradition.

Bio

Serena Saccone is an Associate Professor at the University of Naples, ?L?Orientale.? She holds a PhD in Indology and Tibetology from the University of Turin and was a research fellow at the Austrian Academy of Sciences from 2015 to 2021. Her main area of research is the intellectual history of Buddhism, focusing on South Asian authors from the early medieval period, with a specific interest in epistemology, logic and soteriology, as well as their interconnections. Saccone?s monograph, ?On the Nature of Things? (2018), concerns the internal Buddhist debate on cognitions and their object in the 8th century. Her second book, ?Tantra and Prama?n?a. Studies in the Sa?raman?jari?? (2021), co-authored with Pe?ter-Da?niel Sza?nto?, deals with the interrelationship between Tantric Buddhism and the Digna?ga-Dharmaki?rtian tradition of logic and epistemology.
