[INDOLOGY] New version of the DCS
Dear all,
after quite a while, a new version of the DCS has been released
(http://sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/). Most changes took place in the
Vedic subcorpus where new texts were added and existing ones corrected.
The Pancavimsabr., for example, though one of the less exciting texts
imo, has largely been reworked and should now be usable; same for many
of the Grhyasutras. The corpus also shows syntactic annotations if
available which were added by Erica Biagetti (Pavia), Salvatore Scarlata
(Z?rich), Elia Ackermann (Z?rich) and me (see the first few suktas of
the AV, for example).
As always, updated source data can be found at github:

Best, Oliver
