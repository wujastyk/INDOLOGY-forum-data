Hello Hans,
     I have lost track of some of the relevant old publications, but I
remember that some of the occurrences of ? in Sanskrit were accounted for
by Fortunatov's law regarding the IE l+dental changing to retroflex in
Sanskrit, and some others may be what Thomas Burrow called spontaneous
retroflexes. Are some of your examples [other than *ruki *and *o?t? >
a?t? *?eight?,
covered by these theories?
     The other indication to suggest the instability of ?/? is the
discussion in the Aitareya-?ra?yaka about whether the RV Sa?hit? was
a?ak?ra/a?ak?ra or sa?ak?ra/sa?ak?ra. The ?ra?yaka says that the M????keya
version of the RV was sa?ak?ra/sa?ak?ra, and that ??kalya followed
M????keya in this respect. But the discussion itself indicates that there
may have been other reciters whose Sa?hit? was a?ak?ra/a?ak?ra.
