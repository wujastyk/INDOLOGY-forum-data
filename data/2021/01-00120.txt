Dear All,
Does any of you have PDFs of the following grammars?
Jainendravy?kara?a, with Jainendra Mah?v?tti
??ka??yana?abd?nu??sana with Amoghav?tti
Sa?k?iptas?ra Vy?kara?a (Saini, R. S., Jumaranand?, and Goy?candra.
Sa?k?iptas?ravy?kara?am. 1. ?vr?tti. ed. Dill?, Bh?rata: Bh?rat?ya Vidy?
Prak??ana, 1995.)
Unfortunately my university library is giving me only limited access
to Sa?k?iptas?ravy?kara?a, does not have the edition
of ??ka??yana?abd?nu??sana with Amoghav?tti, and does not give me access to
the Jainendravy?kara?a. I will be truly grateful if I could get your help
with these texts.
Gratefully,
Radhika
