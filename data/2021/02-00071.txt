[INDOLOGY] Re: Hymns that are a mixture of sanskrit and vernacular languages
Dear Harry Spier, 
You have asked for studies/articles, which in my view would be secondary sources. Nevertheless, I?m giving you a good primary source to contact. I hope it will be of some help.
South Indian Carnatic/Classical Music is loaded with songs/hymns depicting a mixture of Sanskrit and different regional languages such as Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil.  [One main reason for the ?Tamil nationalists? to boycott them! ;-) ]
A wonderful musician, Prince Rama Varma (from the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom; a direct descendant of a ruling king and a great composer Maharaja Swathi Thirunal & the famous painter Raja Ravi Varma), considers such songs display a  'ma?iprav??a style,? meaning that such songs have one line in Sanskrit and another in a regional language. 
Prince Rama Varma has been singing bhajans, hymns, songs, ? from several Indian languages.
Feel free to contact Prince Rama Varma at: writetoramavarma at gmail.com <mailto:writetoramavarma at gmail.com>
