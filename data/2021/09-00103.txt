[INDOLOGY] Grep tool for searching on Mac
Dear list members,
While the utilities like grep are good for languages with simple
morphology, for Sanskrit, the regular expressions would result either in
under-generation or over-generation, if one would like to search with a
pr?tipadikam/dh?tu.
In order to facilitate such search, we have developed a search engine
Gave?ik?, available at http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in:8082/searchengine
This search engine combines the morphology engine with the search engine
making it powerful.
Best regards,
Amba Kulkarni
