[INDOLOGY] Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL)
The last issue of DLA [Dravidian Linguistic Association] News contains a copy of a letter sent to the Government of India by D. P. Pattanayak, the first Director of the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) in Mysore. CIIL has published a number of good introductions to Indian languages and other useful publications, but its fate seems sad.
With best wishes, Asko Parpola
