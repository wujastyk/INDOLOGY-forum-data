Dear Indologists,

I just read the paper ?? Of ??dras, S?tas, and ?lokas: Why is the Mah?bh?rata Preeminently in the Anu??ubh Metre?? by Arvind Sharma (Indo-Iranian Journal 43: 225-278, 2000). That raised a question regarding the real social status of S?tas, the bards, in the early Indo-Aryan society. How can one rely on texts like the Dharma??stras or the Mah?bh?rata, which might not be without a vested interest in promoting their own social agenda? If there are early epigraphic data that deal with actual ground realities, that might be helpful. But, given the date of the advent of writing in north India, we may not have that possibility. Has anybody analyzed the real social status of the bards in the early Iranian society?

Thanks in advance

Regards,

Palaniappan
