Dear Walter

Probably I am just missing it, but before signing I wanted to read the
actual petition, but following the link while I found a page to sign, I
could not find the actual petition --what am i missing? every button I push
gets me back to the same page, with the signature submission but no
petition (that I can see anyway)

I send this to the list since it is possible that I am not the only one
with this experience.

Best,
Jonathan
