?Sorry I did not forward my comments to Victor to the whole Indology community. The term ?i???? is found in B?hler?s edition.

Actually, I cannot find the references you mention in that volume.  Check the citation?
Best,
Tim

Dear Victor,

The file is attached.  The reading (on p. 260) likewise lacks the word ?i???.  Note that Patrick?s publication that you refer to is a collection entitled Ascetics and Brahmins.

Best wishes,
Tim

Subject: [INDOLOGY] ?pastambadharmas?tra with Ujjval? V?tti

Dear all,

I am hoping that someone might be able to help me with an edition of the ?pastamba Dharmas?tra with Haradatta's Ujjval? V?tti. In particular, I need the edition cited in Olivelle 2011, p. 395 (Cultural, Historical and Textual Studies):

?pastamba Dharmas?tra. Ed. with Haradatta?s commentary Ujjval? by
U. C. Pandeya. Kashi Sanskrit Series, 93. Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1969.

I've been able to consult three other editions:

the Kumbakonam edition of 1895 ed. by Halasyanatha Sastry

the Mysore edition of 1898 ed. by Mah?deva ??stri and K. Rang?ch?rya

the Kashi edition of 1932 ed. by Ramanatha ?astri

But none of them give a reading quoted on p. 304 of Olivelle's publication, namely, ad ?p 2.7.7: pr?ye?occhabda? ?i??? na pa?hanti. In the editions at my disposal the word ?i??? is omitted.

Thanks and happy holidays!

All the Best,
Victor
