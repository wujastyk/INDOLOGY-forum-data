[INDOLOGY] Rgveda complete study material and reverse word index
Dear all
I would like to have  comprehensive study material of rgveda which includes
most of the recent research scholarship. I use Jamison 2014. But there is
no explanation for translation followed. I would like to see such
explanation for each and every word. A detailed commentary in English.
I would like to know if
Rgveda reverse word index is prepared by anyone.
Thanks to all of you
