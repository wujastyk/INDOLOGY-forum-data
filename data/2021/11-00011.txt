Dear Raffaele,
The situation is easily explained:
The fossilized institution known as the Soci?t? Asiatique has yet to be made aware of the
digital age.
best regards,

Re: [INDOLOGY] Journal Asiatique
Dear Charles,
thank you very much for your offer.
Being visiting professor at the Jagiellonian in this semester, I am currently away from the library of my Department. I could easily ask our excellent librarian to provide me with a PDF of Renou?s article of 1953. But, in more general terms, I would like to know if (in some corner of the web) the collection of such an important journal can be found, or if, now and in the future, I should only rely on its hard copies.
Warmly,
Raffaele

Dear Prof. Torella,
I had occasion to search for a many decades old issue of Journal Asiatique just this past week. Like you, I was not able to find any issues from between 1940?1999 easily available online. However, I was pleased to learn that my university library at Ghent seems to have an extensive collection of back issues and they swiftly scanned the article I needed. If the library in Rome does not have the issue you need in its collection please let me know and I will have it scanned for you.
With my kind regards,
Charles
