[INDOLOGY] Question about Tamil grammar and usage
Dear Hans,
In normal day-to-day interaction, to convey the meaning intended by the English sentences, the sentence 3 in (a) should have the verb ?ceytuvi??u? to denote the completion of the ?doing? action. ?Sentence 3 in (b) should have the word for ?after? as in ?ceyta pi??. Otherwise, it might give the meaning that ?we? worshipped them and took them to the shop. Sentence 3 in (c) would give the meaning that we will take them to the shop to worship too (may be, some priests are being invited to the inauguration of a shop, where the priests have to offer worship in addition to buying stuff!)
Hope this helps.
Regards,
Palaniappan
[INDOLOGY] Question about Tamil grammar and usage
Dear Tamil-specialists, 
I would appreciate your enlightening me on the following issue
Tamil is reported to have discourse-linkage structures such as the one in (a) below, in which the final verb of an earlier sentence is resumed in the form of a converb (or conjunctive participle) at the beginning of the next sentence. In such structures the [+ human] subjects of the converb and the main verb of the sentence have to be identical.
I understand that, as a consequence, structures like the third line of (b) are unacceptable, because the subject of cey-tu and celv?m are human and not identical. Would the use of the infinitive ceyy-a ? ?um as in (c) improve the sentence or even make it grammatical? 
Hoping that some of you will be able to answer my question,
I remain with best wishes to all,
Hans Henrich Hock
