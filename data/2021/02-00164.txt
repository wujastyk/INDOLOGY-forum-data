Many thanks to Manu and also others who replied offline. I can now compare the Tamil inscriptions with the English version as well as the content of other tombstones. What interested me initially was why the tombstones are there on the ground of a Hindu Temple in the first place. Some of the suggestions include: infant burials, military cenotaphs, memorials for wealthy family, lingayat followers who are considered Hindus but do not cremate their bodies, non-Hindu spouses and children, etc.

I wonder if someone could help me to transcribe the Tamil inscription and to direct me to some resources on the practice of tombstone inscription in Tamil. I include some photos here.
