I was wondering if those specialists in yoga on the list might know the origin of this definition of pr???y?ma found in Bha??otpala?s commentary to B?hatsa?hit? 95/97.62 in connection with the practice of warding off the effects of bad omens:
savy?h?ti? sapra?av?? g?yatr??iras? saha/
tri? pa?hed ?yatapr??a? pr???y?ma? sa ucyate//
Many thanks in advance, 
Best,
