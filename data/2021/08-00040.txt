My thanks to P?ter Sz?ler for confirming off-list that the Southern Recension of the Mah?bh?rata does not mention dances by K???a, Vi??u, Indr??i, and Manmatha. 
On this day of happy ??am, it is interesting to explore what these B??a stories suggest regarding the question of Bali. Clifford Hospital has discussed in detail the stories regarding Bali in various Sanskrit texts as well as the connection between Mah?bali and ??am in Kerala in his book, The Righteous Demon: A Study of Bali. But what he has completely missed is any discussion of the dynasty of the the B??as, who claimed descent from Mah?bali. Given that this claim was articulated during the period when different dynasties were claiming descent from the Solar and Lunar dynasties to buttress the legitimacy of their sovereignty over their domains, it is interesting that the B??as chose to claim their origin from Bali. After all, in most Sanskrit accounts, he loses his sovereignty. Also, the lineage has a much better ancestor in Prahl?da. Even B??a is not pushed into hell or netherworld losing his sovereignty. So, the reason for the chiefs/minor kings of the B??a dynasty to trace their lineage from Mah?bali is the possibility that there must have existed a tradition in the Tamil country, that gave a much better treatment to Bali than the Sanskrit texts. It is possible traces of this tradition had influenced the role of Mah?bali in the ??am celebration of Kerala.
