Dear Dr Palaniappan,
At the moment I have no time to answer your question. I am about to leave for a short holiday, and return on 13 September. After that I will look into the matter.

Dear Herman,
Reviewing some old Indology posts, I thought further about your interpretation of Ku?untokai 328.
The reading you have considered has been used by Cauripperum???s 1933 edition. See attachment. An important difference between your interpretation and Cauripperum???s is that he has taken the noise in Ku?ump?r to be produced by the inhabitants of Ku?ump?r and not by bards as you have interpreted. Grammatically, Cauripperum?? is correct. But then to make sense of the word ?pa?ar? which simply hangs there, he is forced to insert the verb ?pa????um? (praising). In contrast, you seem to suggest the bards considered the situation of a dwarf taking on a tiger to be either futile or ridiculous. (The closest saying related to this I can think of in literature is the case of a blind man striking his foot against a sleeping tiger (tu?cu puli i?a?iya cita?a? p?la) in Pu?an????u 73 uttered by the P???iya king Ne?u?ce?iya?.) Cauripperum?? also takes ?Ku?a?a?? to refer to a specific person unlike in your interpretation, but then says he does not know the history behind the event.
I think it is because of these problems this reading has been rejected by all other editors.

Palaniappan

Correction
The gossip (about our love affair) is louder than the noise in Ku?ump?r ...
Mind you, it is a rough paraphrase.

Dear Sudalaimuthu,
You ask for reactions. Mine is restricted to Ku?untokai 328 and Akan????u 155.
The latter poem does indeed mention P????u (or p????u), but as far as I can see the context does not provide any information about its position on the map of South India.
The case of Ku?untokai 328 is more complicated. It mentions a battle between the inhabitants of Ku?ump?r, the Vicciyar, and the v?ntar, or a king, or all the kings, of the great dynasties. I have not been able to locate the Vicciyar. However, a Vicikk?, or ?Vicci king? is mentioned in Pu?an????u 200,8 and a Vicci in Pati??uppattu, Patikam 9, 4 (p. 384).
The second part of Ku?. 328 reads:
                        alar?
vilke?u t??ai vicciyar perumaka?
v?ntaro?u poruta ????aip p??ar
pulin?kku?a?nilai ka??a
kalike?u ku?ump?r ?rppi?um perit?.
Eva Wilden offers the following translation:
[The] gossip is louder than the roaring of bustling Ku?ump?r, which has seen [ka??a] the posture [nilai] of bards [p??ar], resembling [u?a?] tigers [puli] (exchanging) looks [n?kku], at a time when the great son of the Vicciyar with the bow-armed army fought with the kings [v???ar].
As Wilden admits in the notes to this translation she herself could not make sense of the text. The translation is the outcome of consultations with Gopal Iyer.
In her edition Wilden has collected the variant readings of all the manuscripts and editions available. Unfortunately, she does not do anything with this material. For pulin?kku?a?nilai (puli, ?tiger?, n?kku, ?look, gaze?, u?a?, ?resembling?, nilai, ?posture? (and many other meanings, from the verb nil- ?to stand, remain, stop?)) there are two interesting variants, puli-n?r-ku?a?-nilai and puli-n?r-ku?a?a?-nilai. ku?a?a? in the latter may well stand for ku?al?a?, ?dwarf?. The following is a rough paraphrase:
The gossip (about our love affair) is louder than that in Ku?ump?r produced by the bards on the day of the battle between the Vicciyar with the great kings, which they (the bards) considered a case (nilai, but compare Skt ny?ya) of a dwarf taking on (n?r, see DED 3132) a tiger.
I admit that all this is not really an answer to your question.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Location of P??alika of Loka Vibh?ga
According to Lewis Rice, Lokavibh?ga, a Jain Sanskrit work, possibly translated from Prakrit into Sanskrit, says it was copied in ?aka 380 (458 CE) in the 22nd year of Si?havarman, the lord of K??chi, by the Jain Muni Sarvanandin in the village named P??alika in the P??a-r???ra. According to Rice (EI, vol.14, p. 334), "P??alika, the village in which Sarvanandin made his copy, may be P??al?pura, in the South Arcot District. The Periya-pur??am makes it the seat of a large Jaina monastery in the 7th century. P??ar??h?ra is no doubt the territory of the B??a kings."
The village called P??alika has been usually associated with Tirupp??irippuliy?r, a suburb of Cuddalore on the Tamil Nadu coast. Tamil P?tiri is the same as P??ali in Sanskrit. But we have another village called today as P??ir?ppuliy?r (near Mailam) approximately 60 km to the northwest. P?tirai in Tamil is a variant of P?tiri. Thus the present form P?tir?ppuliy?r could represent an ancient form P?tiraippuliy?r. This means P??alika could be P?tir?ppuliy?r too.  Which one was it really?
Now we know that the ca. 6th century Va??e?uttu inscription (Early Tamil Epigraphy, 2003, pp. 471 and 629), which mentions the name of a Jain teacher from P???tu, is at Pa?aiya?pa??u near Aval?rp???tai and about 68 km to the northwest of P?tir?ppuliy?r. Ku?untokai 328 mentions a village called Ku?ump?r which was probably close to the territory of the P??ar, where a battle was being fought.  I think the village of Ku?ump?r approximately 68 km north of P?tir?ppuliy?r and 13 km north of Vandavasi is probably the one mentioned in the poem. The attached Figure 1 shows the locations of P?tir?ppuliy?r, Pa?aiya?pa??u, and Ku?ump?r.
The attached picture shows the locations of Jain temples near the north central Tamil Nadu. Looking at the density of Jain sites, it is clear P?tir?ppuliy?r is right in the middle of them. But the Tirupp??irippuliy?r (Cuddalore) area hardly has any Jain sites. Certainly, what the Google map gives is the current picture. But the distribution of early Tamil inscriptions (2nd century BC- 6th century CE and most of them Jain) shows a similar concentration in this area as shown by Early Tamil Epigraphy Map 1 on p.34.
Based on this, I propose that the location of P??alika from where Lokavibh?ga was copied is present day P?tir?ppuliy?r and that P????u mentioned in Akam 155 and the Pa?aiya?pa??u inscription and the P??a-r???ra mentioned in Lokavibh?ga should be located in the general area where P?tir?ppuliy?r, Pa?aiya?pa??u, and Ku?ump?r are located.
While the area was known as P????u or P??a-r???ra from the time of Akam 155 to the 6th century, the P??ar rulers might have moved further north extending from northern Tamil Nadu into Telugu and Kannada regions by the 6th century.
I welcome comments.
Thanks in advance
Regards,
Palaniappan
