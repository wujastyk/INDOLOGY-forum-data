[INDOLOGY] Re: archeological puzzle
Thanks, Nagraj Ji. I have seen some similar burial photos of Sannyasis in
more recent times and they were not connected with the Veershaiva
community. This is also the imagination about J??ne?vara's Sam?dhi in the
town of Alandi near Pune. The poetic description given by Namdev is that
J??ne?vara went inside the underground chamber and sat in a Yogic posture.
Then the entrance to the chamber was closed with a large stone.  The
popular belief is that J??ne?vara is still alive in that chamber.
