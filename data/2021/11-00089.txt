*Indian Music Theory Through The Ages*
Indian music theory has a long, complex, and fascinating history. This
presentation will take a broad look at various historical moments
which have been pivotal in the evolution of both Hindustani and Carnatic
musical practice. Beginning with the *N??ya-??stra* and the
*Sa?g?ta-ratn?kara *as foundational texts of a pan-Indic music theory, we
will explore not only musical theory per se, but also how musical practice
is informed by Indian philosophies of sonic vibration, mathematical
precision, aesthetic pleasure, and ultimate salvation. Lastly, we will
discuss the rise of new traditions of music theory that arose in the
twentieth century as responses to colonialism, modernity, and secularism.
