Dear Toke,

Here is a link to this edition:

https://archive.org/details/BrahmandaMahapuranEdByDr.KVSharmaKrishnaDasAcademy/page/n205/mode/2up

The pur??a text in this edition is a reprint of one of the
Venkatesvara Press printings. So it is the old Venkatesvara Press
edition, first published in 1906. This edition has more than the usual
number of corrupt readings, as has been noted by several researchers who
used it. R. C. Hazra in his *Studies in the Puranic Records on Hindu Rites
and Customs* used the Vangavasi Press edition, which was published in
Calcutta in 1908, probably in Bengali script. I have not seen it, and have
been trying to obtain a copy of it. This edition seems to have significant
differences from the Venkatesvara Press edition, in the way of additions
and omissions and better readings. The *Epic and Puranic Bibliography*
lists three other editions published in Calcutta, 1895, 1908, and 1940,
that I have no way to check. They are not held in any North American
Library and have not yet been scanned by the Digital Library of India, as
far as I can find.  As far as I know, the Venkatesvara Press edition and
the Calcutta editions are the only independently made editions that were
based directly on manuscripts. I would be glad to get a copy of any of the
Calcutta editions.

Best regards,

David Reigle
