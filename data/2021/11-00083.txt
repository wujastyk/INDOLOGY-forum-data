[INDOLOGY] Organization of the Brahma Sutras
I seem to remember reading somewhere that the current organization of the Brahma Sutras into Chapters, Sections, and Adhikarana was a later development.
If so, could someone please point me to more information about this process and how it might have been originally organized?
Best,
Dean
