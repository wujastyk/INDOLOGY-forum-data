[INDOLOGY] Organization of the Brahma Sutras
References: <1353366928.191154.1637596068864.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
I seem to remember reading somewhere that the current organization of the Brahma Sutras into Chapters, Sections, and Adhikarana was a later development.
If so, could someone please point me to more information about this process and how it might have been originally organized?
Best,
Dean
