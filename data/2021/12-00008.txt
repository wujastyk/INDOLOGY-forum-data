It is with great sadness that I write to share that John C. Huntington passed away this past Sunday, November 28th, after an extended illness. He is survived by his wife and partner in art-historical studies, Susan, their son Eric, and daughter-in-law, Yumi.

John was a supportive adviser and mentor, who nurtured many students in their pursuit of knowledge about Buddhist and Himalayan art during his tenure at Ohio State. His publications on Buddhist art spanned the vast and diverse regions of Asia, but focused primarily on South Asia and the Himalayas. The John C. and Susan L. Huntington Photographic Archive of Buddhist and Asian Art, originally at The Ohio State University and now at the University of Chicago, stands as a lasting legacy of John's scholarship and photographic documentation of art and architecture across Asia. John?s absence is already deeply felt.

Those wanting to contact Susan can reach her at huntington.susan at gmail.com<mailto:huntington.susan at gmail.com>. Cards and letters can be sent to their home address:
