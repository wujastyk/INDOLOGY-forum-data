[INDOLOGY] The Buddhist term sutta
Dear all,
Sheldon Pollock in The Language of the Gods in the World of Men (p. 52) suggests that the Buddhist term ?sutta? does not derive from the Sanskrit s?tra, but rather from s?kta. Sanskrit double consonant clusters do show regular assimilation, regressively and progressively, in Prakrit, where two different consonants become a double of one of them. I?m interested in hearing learned opinion on Pollock?s suggestion. I had not noticed this interesting detail, when I first read this book some years ago.
