Oriented towards research in the field of human and social sciences, this specialized training offer is unique in France. It offers integrated training where each identified cultural area is addressed through a methodology specific to each discipline. The MA Asian Studies educational team encourages students to expand their reflection beyond a single cultural or linguistic area and to embrace a multidisciplinary and comparative approach to their subject of study. The MA Asian Studies also pays particular great attention to field mobility in Asia. Funding is secured by its partner institutions (EHESS, EPHE, EFEO) for student?s fieldwork in order to adequately prepare the M2 dissertation.
The MA Asian Studies (M1 and M2) is directed to graduate students in the field of human and social sciences. It may, however, concern professionals (journalists, librarians, consultants, etc.) wishing to enhance their knowledge of Asian societies. In addition to the compulsory knowledge of French and English, a partial or total fluency of an Asian vernacular language is recommended, and sometimes depending on their research projects. 
You are cordially encouraged to forward this announcement to students who might be interested in this type of training.
