[INDOLOGY] Sunil Kumar
Very sorry to hear of this, Patrick. I knew Sunil  reasonably well and met and spoke with him at various conferences and at the DU History Dept. . He was a resident fellow at our Townsend Center for the Humanities in 2007?08. A very  nice persona and an outstanding scholar. A very sad and significant loss.
