[INDOLOGY] Question about Gandhari Prakrit
I will not refer to my own book on the history of Prakrit and its forms of
knowledge (well, I guess I just did), but I did want to make a few points
in this connection and see if anyone has anything to add.
(1) "Gandhari Prakrit" is of course a modern designation. The
term "Gandhari" was made up by H. W. Bailey in 1946, and we don't know (or
at least I don't know) how the speakers of the language referred to it, or
whether they knew of "Prakrit" as a designation for a language or a type of
language.
(2) The earliest Prakrit grammars were grammars of one specific literary
language, which they called "Prakrit," and even they were probably composed
at a time when Gandhari had ceased to be used as a literary language in the
Northwest. (This certainly seems to be true of the earliest grammar that
survives in its entirety, the Pr?k?taprak??a, which in its original form
only described a single language, as Nitti-Dolci showed 83 years ago.)
(3) One exception to the above is the N??ya??stra, which briefly describes
a number of notionally regional languages (alongside a more general
distinction between Sanskrit and Prakrit). Sylvain L?vi argued 119 years
ago that the languages of Indian theater "radiate like a fan around
Ujjayin?." Now it doesn't seem that anything like Gandhari is used in any
surviving plays. But languages like B?hl?k?, ?ak?r?, and ?bh?r? are
mentioned in the N??ya??stra, and it seems likely that they were at least
notionally connected to the speech of the Northwest. (Of course the
theatrical languages are based on conventions of representation, and not on
a premodern "Linguistic Survey of India.")
