[INDOLOGY] Trippunitura MS catalogues?
Biswas records the following two finding-aids for the library of the
Government Sanskrit College in Trippunitura (near Kochi and Ernakulam).

Does anyone have a scan of any of this material, by chance?  0995 probably
only exists at the NCC project at the U. Madras.   But 0996 may have been
published.
I visited this library some years ago, and saw their hand-written ledger /
accessions list.  But I was searching for a specific item, and it didn't
occur to me to do more.
Best,
