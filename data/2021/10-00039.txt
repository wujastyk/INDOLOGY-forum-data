[INDOLOGY] Question about the Indian grammatical tradition's
 impact on Western philology and linguistics
Hi Brendan, if I may,
I wrote an MPhil dissertation on this subject at Oxford many years ago. I
didn't publish it, but if you put your student in touch with me I can help
with readings etc.
Best wishes,
Ananya.
