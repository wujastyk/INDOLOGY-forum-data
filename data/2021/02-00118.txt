Esteemd scholars, 

Might anyone on this list possess a soft copy of the following and be wiling to share it with me privately?  

Tilak Raj Chopra (Bonn). "BHS triyantara and Hindi tem?tara. Notes on a folk-belief in the Mah?vastu and some other Buddhist Sanskrit texts.? In Frank-Richard Hamm Memorial Volume. Edited by Helmut Eimer (IeT, 21). Bonn: Indica et Tibetica Verlag, 1990, pp. 19?47.

I?m aware that the volume is still in print. But I have no access to a library and I need the article or, in particular, the 'Supplement: Text of the Sabhika-Parivarta, edited for the First Time from Manuscripts?, relatively quickly for a research project. Ordering the book and waiting for it to be delivered would take too long...    

Many thanks! 

Bruno Galasek-Hul
