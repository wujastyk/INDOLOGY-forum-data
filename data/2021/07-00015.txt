Dear Friends,
Am I right in thinking that there is at least another volume, or two, to
this series on the Dhammapa
<https://archive.org/details/DhammapadaAtthakathaVol.2Dr.NathmalTatia/page/n15/mode/2up>da
A??hakath?? I cannot find it.
Vol. 2 ends with #6. P?pavagga. I'm trying to find #26 Br?hma?avagga.
*I'm specifically interested in the story #26.14 Uggasenavatthu.*
I've spent too long today looking for an untranslated Pali version. If it's
on GRETIL then I apologize for not noticing it. These Buddhist texts are
totally unfamiliar to me. If anyone can point me toward a digitized or
scanned copy I would really appreciate it.
Thank you.
All the best,
????? ???????
