Apologies, the precise citation is:

?pastamba Dharmas?tra.
Contained as article XIV in the collection titled LANGUAGE, TEXTS, AND
SOCIETY EXPLORATIONS IN ANCIENT INDIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION published in
2011 by Anthem Press (here

I replied earlier to Tim but forgot to send it to the list in case anyone
wants the exact reference.
All the Best,
Victor
