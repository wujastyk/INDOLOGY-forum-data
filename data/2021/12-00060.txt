[INDOLOGY] New book about the Nataraja
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
Allow me to introduce to you a new book about the specifically southern Indian form of the Dancing Siva, popularly known as the Nataraja. It is a multi-author volume edited by myself, presenting new research on the Nataraja (and lavishly illustrated) and published (just now!) by Brill.
Perhaps interesting for your library or as a Christmas/season gift?

With all best wishes,
Anna Slaczka.
