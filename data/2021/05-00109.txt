Thanks all for a very interesting discussion.
I was wondering Nathan, if you might say a bit more about your critique of
the s?kta hypothesis, or perhaps send me your article.
I kind of favor it myself, but I want to know your take as your book has
been so influential on my more
recent thinking of the web of LateVedic/Renouncer/Householder webs of
conceptual reinvention.
 The reason I was partial to the *s?kta *model, is I think Rigvedic *s?kta*s
(from the perspective of the anthologizers of the text and maintainers of
the
*anukrama??*s) are conceptually animate. That is the reperformed speech act
of a figure of memory, who could be a legendary human, god, or even a
river.
Figures like Atri and the "Atris" that followed him. Whatever their
vision-experience was (*dh?*) it was wrought into the form of a poem,
frozen in verbal amber, and thus the oral tradition is preserving not just
the words of legendary figures but their perspective, breath, mind, etc.
(the components of the self in the later Vedic tradition that frequently
enter and exit the figure of Praj?pati). In the Rigveda itself, we see *satyam
uktam, *but I don't think it's until the Khil?ni that we get *s?ktam
vacas *with
the explicit noun the adjective modifies before its history of
adjective substantivization takes its course. It is not just "well" said, I
think but "truly" said. The re-performance of something imagined to have
been an original first performance once upon a time. When Atri found the
Sun, or when Vasi??ha aided Sud?s, when Indra turned the Maruts into his
entourage, when Vi?v?mitra cajoled the rivers Vip?? and ?utudr?, etc. In
other words a kind if impersonation and re-enactment is, I will argue in my
book *the Invisible Mask *baked into much of the Rigvedic s?ktas (of the
inner ma??alas at least) as an exponent of a particular kind of textuality.
In an oral tradition you will never encounter a "dead text" like a book
that merely contains information, you will encounter a person, a father,
whose voice is laden with the voices of an unbroken succession of fathers,
going back to a legendary forerunner. An animate voice, an active
intelligence, who embodies generations of poetic intelligences going back
to an imagined First (most of my thoughts on all of this are in my book ms *The
Invisible Mask*).
Compare this to the earliest text we think of as a s?tra, the
*Baudh?yana?rautas?tra,
*is not like this at all. They are stage directions that only refer to the
actor's script when necessary. Personal identity is extremely understated,
the assumed subject of the verb is often just whoever is the acting
*adhvaryu* or if not him then it's just the *yajam?na* but these are
offices not individuals. Their textuality, their performativity, is very
different than that of the *s?kta*.
So, I suppose it's worth asking: which of the two is the *buddhavacanam* more
like? Is reciting the *buddhavacanam* a kind of impersonation? Speak like
the Buddha to be more like the Buddha? Does it have this kind of
re-enactive/impersonation component in the way I think the mantra-period
*yaj?a* did? Or are they more like stage directions? Or perhaps they are
nothing like either of these and wholly dissimilar to Vedic textualities.
Not knowing the Buddhist materials nearly as well as the other contributors
to this thread, I am extremely curious about your thoughts on this.
Best,
Caley
