Hi Brendan,
The names that usually float to the top are Sir William Jones, the Grimm Brothers, and Ferdinand de Saussure. Many others contributed as well, but these figures mark special milestones in the development of linguistics. Some online sources to get one started.

Sir William Jones? (1746?1794) - initiated modern historical linguistics by noting similarities between Sanskrit, Greek and Latin in a lecture to the Asiatic Society in 1786. That led to the PIE theory.

As Edgerton writes, ??the specific fact that Sanskrit resembles Greek and Latin had been seen before. But no one before Jones had drawn the inference that these resemblances must be explained by the assumption of common descent from a hypothetical earlier language ? which, perhaps, no longer exists.? At this moment modern comparative grammar was born.?
