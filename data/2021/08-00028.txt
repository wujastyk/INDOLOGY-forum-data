Dear Palaniappan,



Apart from the Hariva??a, the Southern recension of the Mah?bh?rata and many
pur??as relate the story of B???sura. The Mah?bh?rata
(2.35.29.d*21.1448?1534), the Bh?gavata? (10.62.1?63.53), the Brahma?
(205.9?206.50), and the Vi??u?pur??a (5.32.6?33.50) share more or less the
similar storyline with the Hariva??a, while the version of the K?rma?pur??a
(1.17.1?7) differs a bit more from the others. B??a also appears in the
K?lik??pur??a, in the story of Naraka. In this pur??a, it is he, who taught
the worship of ?iva to Naraka (K?lik??pur??a 39.1?8).

In connection with B??a?s dance, I offer to read Phyllis Granoff?s article,
