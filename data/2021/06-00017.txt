[INDOLOGY] Partial success at the University of Halle
Many thanks to Antonia Ruppel for informing us of the current status of
this unfortunate matter!
I only have to add that, contrary to appearances, the process of filling
the two professorships in Indology is to be stopped as a result of
yesterday's decision by the Senate. This is because the resolution now
provides for a completely new discussion on the retention or closure of
disciplines. No one can predict when and how this discussion will end.
Until then, the chairs will remain vacant if the initial approval of the
Rectorate that has already taken place is not realised immediately.
In this respect, I can only agree with Antonia Ruppel that now would be the
time to press massively for an immediate filling of the Indological
vacancies.
With heartfelt thanks for your great support (15,200 signatures at the
moment),
and with my very best regards,
Walter Slaje
