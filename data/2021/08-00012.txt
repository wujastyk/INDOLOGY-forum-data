Dear list members,
in a contribution by Gokul Sashadri in Kulke et al, Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa. Delhi: Manohar, p. 107, I came across a reference to Jambudv?pa in a late (seventeenth century) P?li text, namely the Gandhava?sa, in which Jambudv?pa would be used to refer to peninsular India. I am interested to know if this interpretation is correct for the Gandhava?sa and if we have to do with an old (how old?) use of the word.
With kind regards, Herman
