"The Bombay edition": Atha Brahm???amah?pur??a? pr?rabhyate, Mumbai: ?r?ve?ka?e?vara Steam Press, 1906 (?ake 1828 / V.S. 1963), was reprinted in 1912 (?ake 1834 / V.S. 1969) with the Lalitop?khy?na added (from f? 204 v?); then a new edition (viz. a new typographical composition) was produced by K?emar?ja ?r?k???ad?s, Mumbai: ?r?ve?ka?e?vara Press, 1935 (?ake 1857 / V.S. 1992). It is this last edition which has then been reprinted both as being the ?ed. K. V. Sharma?, Varanasi: Krishnadas Academy (Chowkhamba Press), Krishnadas Sanskrit series no. 41, 1983, 20002, 2009 etc., and New Delhi: Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, 20023; and also as being the ?ed. J.

>> The pur??a text in this edition is a reprint of one of the Venkatesvara Press printings. So it is the old Venkatesvara Press edition, first published in 1906. This edition has more than the usual number of corrupt readings, as has been noted by several researchers who used it. R. C. Hazra in his Studies in the Puranic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs used the Vangavasi Press edition, which was published in Calcutta in 1908, probably in Bengali script. I have not seen it, and have been trying to obtain a copy of it. This edition seems to have significant differences from the Venkatesvara Press edition, in the way of additions and omissions and better readings. The Epic and Puranic Bibliography lists three other editions published in Calcutta, 1895, 1908, and 1940, that I have no way to check. They are not held in any North American Library and have not yet been scanned by the Digital Library of India, as far as I can find.  As far as I know, the Venkatesvara Press edition and the Calcutta editions are the only independently made editions that were based directly on manuscripts. I would be glad to get a copy of any of the Calcutta editions.
