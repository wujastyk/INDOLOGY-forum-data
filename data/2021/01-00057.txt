Dear list,
Is there any consensus on what an a?gula corresponds to in the metric 
system? Or should we not consider it an absolute standard, but rather 
take it literally as the breadth of a finger (with all the uncertainties 
that follow)? There are a lot of suggestions floating around on the 
internet, but I would be interested in any scholarly references.
Best,
Jacob
