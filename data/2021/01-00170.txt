Dear Jan and all,
On this term see also Schmithausen, Alayavij. n. 184. Schmithausen  
points out that the term is used as synonym of artha, hita and  
nirvANa. See also the helpful references therein (AN III, 403, Norman  
1969: 28).
Best wishes,
Eli

> Dear All,
> In continuation of Tim's detailed and valuable discussion and his reference
> to Patrick Olivelle's note on yoga-k?ema, it may be useful to explain in
> addition (1) that in this compound yoga, whether from a Vedic or Buddhist
> point of view, has nothing to do with buddhist or Patanjali's meditation or
> with difficult seating positions, but it refers, at least originally, to
> the yoking of bulls to the chariots (probably bulls rather than what we
> call oxen because castration was rare in ancient India -- as Basham
> observed, I believe correctly, somewhere in The Wonder That Was India) --
> next, from the yoking of the bulls it refers, indeed, to the trek of a
> family, group or clan; (2) that k?ema as derived from ?k?i 'to reside
> (safely and undisturbed)' had similarly a very concrete meaning referring
> to the concrete conditions of a temporary settlement; (3) that yoga-k?ema
> is thus one of several words/expressions in the language, whether Vedic or
> Buddhist, that points to a transition from a semi-sedentary mode of life to
> a more, or to a completely, sedentary mode of life, together with words
> such as graama 'caravan / village', mahaanasa 'great chariot / kitchen'
> (the word occurs both in Asoka's inscriptions and in the Paippalaada
> samhitaa), perhaps also g.rhapati/gehapati 'ritual chief or family chief /
