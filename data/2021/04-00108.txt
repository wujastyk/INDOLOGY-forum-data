Dear Dominik,
     I entirely agree with you. In some quarters there is a tendency to
consider everything "western" to be a P?rvapak?a, with an implication that
a Siddh?nta can come only from what can be labeled "Indian." This "Indian"
does not include "westernized Indian" but often includes "Indianized
westerners." Such labels already distance a reader from the content of a
given argument, and they have to first take sides based on the labels
attached to arguments. Such is the sociopolitical reality of academics.
