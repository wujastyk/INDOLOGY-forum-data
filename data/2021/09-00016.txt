Dear list members,
On behalf of the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute, I am pleased to
announce.
The following 14 Virasaiva e-texts have been added to Muktabodha's
searchable etext library.
https://muktabodha.org/digital-library/
They were created from sources provided by Dr. Elaine Fisher, Assistant
Professor of Religion at Stanford University and a member of Muktabodha's
Academic Advisory Council. This is the first installment of a project to
digitally preserve and transcribe rare Virasaiva texts and is funded by a
fellowship to Dr. Fisher from Stanford University.
