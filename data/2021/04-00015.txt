Subject: [INDOLOGY] IMPORTANT technical announcement: Pause posting
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Ce2NOsK-JFXzkekw650VCMSWjjS1CjKvwi4Viy1RLZgtw@mail.gmail.com>

The INDOLOGY list is shortly to undergo technical maintenance.  During this
time, messages sent to the list will not be archived and may be lost
entirely.

Please do not post to the INDOLOGY list for the time being.  Posting will
resume quite soon, I expect between a few hours and a day.

I will write again as soon as the list is open again.

Best wishes,

Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY list <http://indology.info> committee member
