Dear Natalia,
Thanks / Spasibo !
I figured that ??????? must mean Download and it worked out well.
In this brochure I could not find any hint about one important aspect of
this 1955 performance: that it was filmed!
At that time this was an enormous undertaking, with separate instruments
for recording image and sound.
I read or saw on some picture that van Buitenen had mobilized a whole team
and some scaffolding for the filming and separate sound recording of this
event, so it is hard to believe that the Samiti was not aware of this.
Hence in van Buitenen's film, which *does* mention the
Vaajapeya Anu.s.thaana Samiti, one of the acknowledgements -- a little
difficult to read -- states:
"Assembled by: Stichting Film en Wetenschap, Universitaire Film, Utrecht"
This Dutch Stichting Film en Wetenschap was just established in 1955, and
continues at present under the name Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en
Geluid.
Due to the poor quality of this historic recording it is difficult to
recognise persons and faces, but at 07 min 31 seconds it is unmistakably
Prof. R.N. Dandekar who appears, walking next to the procession of the
yajamaana and patnii and his fires from his home to the sacrificial area
prepared at the SP College ground. Madhav, do you recognize any other
persons in the film?
Best regards to all,
Jan Houben
