[INDOLOGY] Balinese Hinduism
Dear friends,
Might you be able to shed light on just when it was that the designation "Hindu" first came to be applied to the religion of Bali, and what the local term(s) may have been beforehand? A small number of references would be most welcome as well.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
