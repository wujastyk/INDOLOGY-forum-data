[INDOLOGY] question about Tamil

Dear Herman,
the Chicago electronic version of the Tamil Lexicon 
(https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/tamil-lex/) has a "words ending 
with" function. By using this function, quite a lot of nouns ending in 
-i? can be found. Many of them are obscure, but at least the words ????? 
vayi?, "place", and ????? kavi?, "beauty", are well attested in 
classical Tamil.
Best regards,
Jonas
