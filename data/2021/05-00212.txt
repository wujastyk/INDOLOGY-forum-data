Russian translation of Gitagovinda in Moskvityanin
Dear All,
It came to my notice that the monthly literary review Moskvityanin (????????????, "The Muscovite")  published by  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Pogodin> Mikhail Pogodin in  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow> Moscow contains the following translations by the foremost Russian Indologist Pavel Jakovlevi? Petrov, ?Razbor sanskritskoj poemy ?Gita-govinda? s otkrybkami iz nee?, Moskvitjanin 1:1, 1842, 120-129?, apart from ?Mats?opak?anam ili skazanie o rybe?, Moskvitjanin 4:8, 1841, 404-409 and ?Skazanie o Savitri?, Moskvitjanin 6:12, 1841, 337-352. 
Is there any member of the list who might be able and willing to share, at least, the first item, or ideally, all of them in an electronic version?
Last time I approached the list, I miserably failed among the Tamilologists (none response on the authorship of the statue of poetess Auvaiyar on the Marina in Madras/Chennai). May I hope in more success with my present Sankskritic query?
With best regards, Jan Filipsky, Oriental Institute, Praha
