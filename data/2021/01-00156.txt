Dear Matthew,


For several excerpts from the Pali Kanon which are compared with 
Sanskrit sources (on /yogakkhema///yogak?ema/) see also:

Shozen Kumoi, The Concept of Yoga in the Nik?yas. Studies in Honour of 
Heinz Bechert on the Occasion of His 65^th Birthday, Indica et Tibetica, 
vol. 30, p. 407-420.


Best

Heiner
