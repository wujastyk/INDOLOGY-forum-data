Dear All,
    Tagging on to this topic, someone contacted me about donating 300
Sanskrit books to any institution that would agree to keep it together, and
find some way of memorializing the gift from her husband. She has made a
list of the books (including LC call numbers); the bulk are on grammar &
linguistics with a smaller number on Veda.
    I'll be happy to post the book list to Indology if there is interest.
Best wishes,
Tim Cahill
