Dear All,
In continuation of Tim's detailed and valuable discussion and his reference
to Patrick Olivelle's note on yoga-k?ema, it may be useful to explain in
addition (1) that in this compound yoga, whether from a Vedic or Buddhist
point of view, has nothing to do with buddhist or Patanjali's meditation or
with difficult seating positions, but it refers, at least originally, to
the yoking of bulls to the chariots (probably bulls rather than what we
call oxen because castration was rare in ancient India -- as Basham
observed, I believe correctly, somewhere in The Wonder That Was India) --
next, from the yoking of the bulls it refers, indeed, to the trek of a
family, group or clan; (2) that k?ema as derived from ?k?i 'to reside
(safely and undisturbed)' had similarly a very concrete meaning referring
to the concrete conditions of a temporary settlement; (3) that yoga-k?ema
is thus one of several words/expressions in the language, whether Vedic or
Buddhist, that points to a transition from a semi-sedentary mode of life to
a more, or to a completely, sedentary mode of life, together with words
such as graama 'caravan / village', mahaanasa 'great chariot / kitchen'
(the word occurs both in Asoka's inscriptions and in the Paippalaada
samhitaa), perhaps also g.rhapati/gehapati 'ritual chief or family chief /
farmer'.
