Hi, Everybody,

First of all, I wish all the colleagues on the Indology list a very 
happy year 2021.
The fact that a?gula is defined in the Baudh?ulb. as 14 a?u (I,3-4 
Thibaut numbering) or 34 tila (I,5) is not to be taken too seriously. 
The last one has something to do with the approximate value given by 
Baudh?ulb. I,62 to the dvikara?ii (square root of 2, in a modern view) 
as 1 + 1/3 + 1/12 - 1/(12.34) and the first one with M?n?ulb 10.1.2.6-7 
(Van Gelder), that implies an approximate value of 7/5. I developped all 
this in my book "Les math?matiques de l'autel v?dique" (Droz, 2016) and 
in a previous article : ? Quadratures, circulature and the approximation 
of square root of 2 in the Indian ?ulba-s?tras ?, Centaurus 
(International Magazine of the History of Mathematics, Science and 
Technology), vol.47 (2005), pp.60-71.

All the best,

Jean Michel Delire,
Lecturer on Science and civilization in India - Sanskrit texts, IHEB
