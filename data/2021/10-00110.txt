[INDOLOGY] On the date of Banabhatta 7th century
Dear all
Is there any paper or writings, for inferring the date, which describes the
contexts (giving references from Harsha Charita and references from
Biography of Chinese traveler Hieun Tsang) and which makes us believe that
the same Harsha was referred to by both Hieun Tsang and Bana? I highly
appreciate your help.
Thanks
Krishna Prasad
