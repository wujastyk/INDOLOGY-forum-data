*Economic Class in Early South Asian Buddhism: Perspectives from Epigraphy
and the Divy?vad?na*


*Matthew D. Milligan Trinity University (San Antonio, TX)*

To date, most studies of classical South Asian Buddhist demographics have
focused on var?a and conversion, mercantile professions, and, more
recently, finally, on gender. Unfortunately, even when scholars have turned
their gaze onto demographics they have primarily relied upon anachronistic
and generalized readings of literature and/or century old tabulations of
inscriptions. As far as I can tell, there have been no attempts to
critically examine economic class through close readings of texts and
historical documents together. In this paper, I will evaluate the
definition of ?economic class,? decouple it from classical Sanskrit
concepts of idealized var?a, and introduce some new data from texts and
inscriptions to examine the lived realities of ?class" from approximately
300 BCE until at least the 5th c. CE when the *Divy?vad?na* was composed.

*Bio*

Matthew D. Milligan is a Visiting Assistant Professor at Trinity University
in San Antonio, TX. He is also a Harwood Research Fellow at the American
Institute for Economic Research. He works on the intersections of Buddhism,
Economics, and Philology and has published numerous articles on the
economic history of Buddhism in South Asia. In addition to forthcoming
articles in the *Journal of Contemporary Religion *and *South Asian Studies*,
he is completing a book manuscript titled *Of Rags and Riches: The
Disruptive Business of Early Buddhism*. His latest project involves
decolonizing the field of engaged Buddhist Economics in the United States.
