Dear Jim,

Perhaps try thinking of a heavy medieval lock opened by a very large metal key, requiring rather a lot of force to turn or slide, depending upon the type of lock being used. Maybe my imagination is too influenced by images of huge Tibetan locks and keys that served also as lethal weapons. Might not some old Indian locks be preserved in one or another of the palace museums?

best ever,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with a simile

Dear colleagues,

I wonder if anybody can help me understand a simile in a ha?hayoga text I?m editing, the Vivekam?rta??a. Verse 34 reads:

udgh??ayet kap??a? tu yath? ku?cikay? ha?h?t |
ku??aliny? tath? yog? mok?adv?ra? vibhedayet ||

My incomplete translation is as follows: ?The yogi should use Ku??alin? to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a ku?cik? to force open a kap??a.? I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.

All the best,

Jim
