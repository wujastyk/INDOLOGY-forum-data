[INDOLOGY] Searching the Indology List Archive
The earlier Indology archive and its browse and search functions worked very well. The new Indology archive and its search function have created a terrible problem where none existed. It is hard to search and hone in on specific posts to cite them. The Indology archive was a very valuable knowledge database. But, it is terrible to use right now. Is it just me or do other members have run into problems too? If yes, can we go back to the earlier system a la the Coca Cola experience?
Thank you.
