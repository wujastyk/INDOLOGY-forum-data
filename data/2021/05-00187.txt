Dear colleagues,
Many thanks to all those who replied to me, on and off the list, with their valuable suggestions. Having been altogether unable to make sense of the simile I now find myself with a surfeit of possible solutions.
In particular I thank Andrea Acri for reminding me that I myself have written about ku?cik?s. Chasing up that lead led me to a half-verse in the Khecar?vidy? (2.105ab) in which udgh??ya refers to removing an argala or ?bolt?:
udgh??y?rgalam ?k??e jihv?m ?rdhva? pras?rayet |
I find a similar usage in the Ha?hasa?ketacandrik?. Because of these usages, and the suggestions from colleagues that udgh??ayet and vibhedayet might have subtly different meanings in the Vivekam?rta??a verse, I now suspect that udgh??ayet is being used in the sense of ?unlock?. And that ha?h?t, as some colleagues suggested, gives a sense of certainty or inevitability. (By the way, I should have noted that the Vivekam?rta??a does not call its yoga ha?ha, so it is unlikely that there is any connotation of a particular type of yoga in ha?h?t.)
My latest translation of the verse is: ?In the same way that by means of a key one may be sure to unlock a door, by means of Ku??alin? the yogi may [be sure to] break open the doorway to liberation ?
But I feel a long footnote coming on. To help with that, would any colleagues be able to point me towards a pdf of the book by von Hin?ber that Sven Sellmer kindly mentioned (or provide just the relevant pages)? Here are the details again:
Oskar v. Hin?ber: Sprachentwicklung und Kulturgeschichte. Ein Beitrag zur materiellen Kultur des buddhistischen Klosterwesens. Stuttgart: Steiner (Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur. Geistes- und Sozialwiss. Klasse. Jg. 1992, Nr. 6)., esp. pp. 14??24, 30??34.
All the best,
Jim
