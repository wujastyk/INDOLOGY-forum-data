[INDOLOGY] Visualisation of Sanskrit Phonetics
Dear Marcis,
no, there is of course more literature. Apart from the translations of 
(and accompanying commentaries on) the Pr?ti??khyas and older ?ik??s, 
most importantly perhaps:
 ??? Allen, W. S. (1953). Phonetics in Ancient India. London: OUP.
and
 ??? Varma, Siddheshwar (1929). Critical Studies in the Phonetic 
Observations of Indian Grammarians. London: Royal Asiatic Society.
Best regards
Tim
