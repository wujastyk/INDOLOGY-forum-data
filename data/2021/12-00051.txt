[INDOLOGY] Questions for PhD on Sanskrit dramas
Dear list members,
I am currently working on my PhD thesis, for which I am looking into the
ways Sanskrit epic stories are adapted into Sanskrit dramas.
My focus is on three themes: embassies (e.g., the Mah?bh?rata?s
Udyogaparvan and Bh?sa?s D?tav?kya), sneak attacks (e.g., the Mah?bh?rata?s
Vir??aparvan and Bh?sa?s Pa?car?tra), and r?k?asas (e.g., the Mah?bh?rata?s
Hai?imbopaparvan and Bh?sa?s Madhyamavy?yoga).
Do you know if the night attack from the Sauptikaparvan is explicitly
featured somewhere in Sanskrit drama?
Could you suggest other plays that might be worth looking into?
Thanks in advance,
