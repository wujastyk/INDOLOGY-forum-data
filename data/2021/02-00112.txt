>From whatever I have understood of another major language of the world,
Chinese, I estimate that it will be entirely impossible to capture the
nuances of different interpretations expressed in these translations into
German, French, Russian, English, without enormous footnotes at each
subjunctive, injunctive, imperative, at each explicit or elliptic use of a
form of 'to be' ...  Perhaps a translation into Chinese can at the most
aspire to be a close paraphrase... By contrast, this shows the importance
of having different interpretations of Vedic ritual poetry and Vedic
literature into German, French, Russian and English... (and of course into
Polish...).
All best,
