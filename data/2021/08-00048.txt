Dear Gaia, you might have a look at two g?th?s from the Sattasa? (edition A. Weber 1881), namely 351 and 648, where instead of n?vi the text has (Pr?krit) ga??hi. I give the translations by Peter Khoroche and me (Poems on Life and Love in Ancient India. H?la's Sattasa?. Albany 2009):
351 (trsl 158)
He was embarrassed
But I laughed and gave him a hug
When he groped for the knot (ga??hi)
Of my skirt (?ia?sa?a) and found it
Already undone.
648 (trsl 149)
Feigning sleep
The husband turned over
And let a trembling hand fall as if by accident
On the knot of his young wife's skirt
Which she held firmly between her thighs.
