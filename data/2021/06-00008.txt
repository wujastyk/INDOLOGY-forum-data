Dear colleagues,
If there is a problem with your subscription, first try to fix it
yourself.  You have full access to the controls :-)  Everything is
available from the INDOLOGY website <http://indology.info>.  Select
"subscribe / manage your preferences"
Second, please write to the INDOLOGY committee about anything else, as
requested on the website <https://indology.info/contact/>.
Please don't write to me personally, for the reasons given on the website.
I will not be able to help
