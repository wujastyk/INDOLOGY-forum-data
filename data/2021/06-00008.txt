Dear colleagues,

If there is a problem with your subscription, first try to fix it
yourself.  You have full access to the controls :-)  Everything is
available from the INDOLOGY website <http://indology.info>.  Select
"subscribe / manage your preferences"

Second, please write to the INDOLOGY committee about anything else, as
requested on the website <https://indology.info/contact/>.

Please don't write to me personally, for the reasons given on the website.
I will not be able to help

Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY list <http://indology.info> committee member
*Please do not reply to me personally: re*ply to
indology-owner at list.indology.info
