Friends:

I know this is a strange request, but of this article I only have a scan and thus not able to access the text without typing it all over again. My computer seems to have chewed up my original Word file and spit it out!
If any of you have access to a PDF of this article that I can copy and paste, I would be very grateful. I cannot find it in Academia.

?The Term vikrama in the Vocabulary of A?vagho?a.? In Pram??ak?rti?: Papers Dedicated to Ernst Steinkellner on the Occasion of his 70th Birthday. Ed. B. Kellner, et al., pp. 587-595. Two Volumes. Wiener Studien zur Tibetologie und Buddhismuskunde. Vienna: Arbeitskreis f?r Tibetsche und Buddhistische Studien, 2007.

Thank you all very much.

Patrick
