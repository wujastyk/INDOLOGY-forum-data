Nacci??rkki?iyar (N) seems to have interpreted the word ko??i as ?plunder? and has applied that meaning to interpret the occurrences of the word in Pa????app?lai 212 and 246. That the meaning of ko??i in Pa?. 212 is simply ?wealth? is obvious as many modern commentators have correctly interpreted. But, still they follow N in his interpretation of Pat. 246, which in my opinion is unwarranted.

 

Here is a quick translation of Pa?. 207-212 where the text describes the living area of traders in the port city of Puk?r

 

And the area where the traders with ancient wealth live in large numbers, 

who are impartial, good-hearted,

being afraid of reproach, speaking the truth,

seeing own goods and those of others in the same way,

without taking excess (of what is right) and giving less (than what is right)

giving many kinds of goods announcing their prices?

 

?Ancient wealth? is my translation of ?tol ko??i?.

 

N explains ?tol ko??i? as ?ancient plunder? (pa?ait?kiya ko??aiyi?aiyum). He goes on to explain the poet?s rationale for using the word ?ko??i? here in the following words. ?ko??aiye???r, inne?iyai na?atti??ri?attallatu poru??ira?u???k?te??a?ku.? N seems to say that one can accumulate wealth only if you follow the path of plunder! This is in spite of the fact that the text goes to extraordinary lengths to describe the ethical trade practices of the traders of Puk?r.

 

U.V?. C?min?taiyar, the editor of the text, intervenes to explain N?s use of ko??ai with a note saying ?ko??ai ? mikuti? meaning ?abundance?. This really does not justify N?s explanation. 

 

In contrast to N and U.V?.C?, R?. Raghavaiya?k?r explains ?tol ko??i? as ?to??uto??uvanta celvattira?? meaning ?the accumulated wealth from ancient times?, which makes sense. Peruma?aippulavar explains it as ?to??uto??u ???iya poru?? meaning ?the wealth earned from ancient times? which makes sense too. While these commentators give the correct meaning, they do not discuss the error of N?s interpretation and when it comes to Pa?. 246, they simply follow N?s interpretation.

 

Pa?. 246-249 describe some women who take bath in a waterbody which is used by the people for drinking water, smear the floor and decorate with flowers and light lamps in the evening at a temple with a sacred pillar that is worshipped by many and where travelers come and stay. The text uses the term ?ko??i maka?ir? to denotes these women. With his predilection for the meaning ?plunder? for ?ko??i?, N goes on to explain ?ko??i maka?ir? as women of the household of the kings captured by the C??a king and forced into working at the temple. According to N, the C??a king thought that his fame would increase as a result. 

 

Unfortunately, this idea of captive royal women being forced into being temple women (and by extension devad?sis) has been unquestioningly accepted by all modern commentators. The real meaning of ?ko??i maka?ir? becomes clear from the names of some high status individuals we come across in inscriptions. For example, consider these names:
Tiruva???malai inscription of ca. 1235 CE, we find one Putuv?ru?aiy?n Ko??i Tiru???acampantav???? (SII 8, no. 83, ln. 8, p.45)
An inscription of 1288 CE from Ka?app?? near Tiruttu?aipp???i in the rule of Ja??varma? Cuntara P???iya? III mentions a Brahmin, Ko??i Varatar?capa??a?, who sold some land. SII 8, no. 265, ln.4, p. 147
In the year 1301 under the rule of M??avarma? Kulac?kara P???iya? I in the same place, we find a Brahmin lady by the name Ka?paka?ko??icc??i, who was the wife of Uyyakko????bha??a? and younger sister of Ke?avabha??a Sarvvakratuy?jiy?r who was her advisor. 
An inscription from Singarattoppu near Chidambaram in the 17th year of Kulottunga III mentions a brahmin named M??ala? Uyyakko??i Ko?iy??v?? who was the guardian of P?rattuv?ci Ce?in?yaka? Po?koyi? Pa??a? (SII 28, no. 109).
 

When the names Uyyakko??i and Uyyakko???? are compared, it becomes clear that ko??i is synonymous with ko???? just like ???i is synonymous with ?????. But ko??i and ???i are used for both masculine and feminine names, but ko???? and ????? are used only for masculine names. The name ?uyyakko????? means ?One who took possession of the person, who gets salvation?. Thus, ko??i is either a ?lord? or ?lady? depending on the context. What has happened between the time of the Pa??i?app?lai and the medieval inscriptions, ko??i which was used to refer to ?wealth? (or possession) was metonymically used to refer to one who possessed wealth (lord or lady). If we were to consider the singular form of ko??i maka?ir, i.e., ko??i maka? in Classical Tamil times, it is equivalent to ko??i in medieval inscriptions. So, ko??i maka?ir in Pa?. 246 meant ?ladies?.

 

Thus, the persons Pa?. 246 refers to were very highly respected women who were temple functionaries. They were not captive women forced to being temple workers. It is not that the Tamil kings were very gentle towards the royal women of the defeated kings. Classical Tamil poems mention ropes being made from the hair of defeated royal women. Medieval inscriptions mention royal women being captured and moved to the victor?s ?v??am?. Some defeated royal women?s noses were cut.  But, there is no epigraphic record of any captured royal women being forced into being temple workers.

 

I welcome comments.

 

Thanks in advance.
