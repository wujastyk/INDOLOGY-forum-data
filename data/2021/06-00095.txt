[INDOLOGY] erratum-Schwab's English translation

Curious, I was just reading that Abel-R?musat (1788--1832) secured the
first chair in Chinese at the Coll?ge de France, also in 1815;
enviable time.

Dear colleagues,
I just noticed a typo in my post. Please correct it: Ch?zy?s chair in
Coll?ge de France was created in 1815.
My very best,
Lyne
