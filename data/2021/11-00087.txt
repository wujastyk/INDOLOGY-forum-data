I guess that Dan may be referring to the Barmakid dynasty. A very useful survey is:
Kevin van Bladel, "The Bactrian Background of the Barmakids", in Anna Akasoy, Charles Burnett and Ronit Yoeli-Tlalim (eds.), Islam and Tibet: Interactions along the musk routes, London: Ashgate 2011, pp. 43?88.

That barely lasted a generation, when a new ruler started to kill them off, purging them, having them flee back to Central Asia, then following them in a drive that purged Buddhism and Buddhists from much of Central Asia (Tibet was spared due to its relative inaccessibility and reputation as fierce warriors). I attempted a quick search for a website or two to include in this ? they were not hard to find a few years ago, but web information on that seems to have been purged and whitewashed as well ? I searched with three different search engines. More hits on Buddhists acting badly even for a search like ?baghdad buddhists? then even the tiniest morsel of information on the tragedy of the invited Buddhist communities to Baghdad, and the aftermath.

The Vikings were very active in the slave trade with Byzantium, which moved along the Volga river and Caspian sea, but the presence of a given artifact at a Viking site may not always imply that it arrived through Viking raiders moving upstream. There were also slave traders, and other merchants, based in Byzantine lands who moved downstream.

While they might not have gone all the way there, it seems certain that they did penetrate well into Central Asia -- probably at least as far as the Caspian Sea.

The Buddhists are better attested and there were probably more of them, but I was wondering what evidence we have for both groups in Central Asia.
