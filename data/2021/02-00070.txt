Mixture of Sanskrit and Indian vernacular languages is at three levels :

1. Language used in the hymn itself is a hybrid of Sanskrit and the
vernacular, the language is called Manipravaala

Malayalam examples are the 15th century works, *Vasudeva Stavam, Avatharana
Dasakam, Dasavathara Charitham, Chelloor Nadha Stavam, Ramayana Keerthanam*,
and *Bhadrakali Stavam (*http://www.keralaculture.org/manipravalam/264)

2. A given stotra having a few verses in Sanskrit and a few in the
vernacular

There are some stotras in Telugu and Tamil falling under this category.

3. Recitation routines mixing Sanskrit and vernacular stotras.

This is the most common, widely prevalent phenomenon, sometimes creating
number 2 above.
