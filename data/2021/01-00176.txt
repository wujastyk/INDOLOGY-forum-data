[INDOLOGY] PDF request (VOHD Band 2 Teil 19)
Dear Deepro,
As far as I am aware this particular volume is not available in PDF yet.
All other volumes seem to be available. You might have to take help of
someone who has access to the physical volume/s. That is what I did when I
wanted to make a reference to a particular Ms from this volume. Sorry if
this is not helpful. Best wishes.
