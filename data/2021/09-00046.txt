Dear Jim,
The suffix added last in the progressive formation (prakriy?) of the name
'P??ini' is in fact the taddhita suffix i? (AA 4.1.95 aTa i?), so there is
no reason to take the word as a neuter noun.
Another example would be d?a?a-rath-i in the sense of ?descendant of
d??a-ratha-?, one of the epithets of R?ma.
