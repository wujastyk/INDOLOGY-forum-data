Dear Jim,
I do not know any story, but the following two verses from R?mabhadra D?k?ita?s Patan?jalicaritam present a version of the double patronymic indicated in Monier Williams and in the references Victor cited.
If I understand correctly, Pa?in is a great grandfather, who has a son called P??ina; this son has a son by the same name (P??ina junior), who marries Dak?a?s daughter, and the two name their son P??ini.
pa??ti ka?cin munir asti p?rva? sa p??ina? n?ma kum?ram ?pa ? svatulyan?mn? tanayena so'pi d?k??m ud??h?? d??ham abhyanandat ?? 2.47
sa p??ino dak?abhuv? purandhy? ripu? pur???m umayeva reme ? k?le muni? skanda iva pras?to har?a? tayo? p??inir apy ak?r??t ?? 2.48

Re: [INDOLOGY] P??ini
Victor, Guy, Dan,
Thanks for your responses. I, of course, was looking for possible ?pseudo-etymologies? for the name ?P??ini,? thinking there may be one (or more) like there is for Pata?jali (the yogin). But, interestingly, conditioned by my teacher some years ago, Frances Wilson, I always go first to Apte?s dictionary. Frances disdained Monier-Williams because it gave the words in transliteration and not in Devan?gar?! Apte in this case was unhelpful. I usually, anyway, always look at Monier-Williams aside Apte for things, as both dictionaries contain items the other doesn?t. But, obviously, I didn?t do my back-up work in this case.
Still wondering if there may be mythological stories about P??ini and, now, his family line. A double patronymic. Would this mean then, that his grandfather is P??in?
Victor, some of what you?ve posted I cant? decipher because I don?t know P?nini well enough, his ?code-words? for forms and categories. But part of it, seems to basically spell out what Guy and Dan were pointing out, it seems.
Jim

Dear Jim,
I've pasted below two derivations given in commentaries to the Prakriy?kaumud? or R?macandra; the first is by Vi??hala in his Pras?da (p. 3 of the first volume) and the second (spanning two portions) is by K???a ?e?a in his Prak??a (pp. 8ff. of the first volume). The former text can be downloaded here<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YrjVLXHkqneSwwEjNzWK2vx_CNfA-sHn?usp=sharing>.  The latter, here<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NysQ-LteMaqetcAjSKp3QnnxbxOLyLYU?usp=sharing>. Hope that's helpful.
All the Best,
Victor

Hi,
I'm curious if there are any creative etymologies or mythological explanations for the name ?P??ini.? I don?t recall encountering any over the years. The word itself seems to be neuter in gender (if we assume an ?in? suffix) and therefore somewhat unusual in designating a person.
