[INDOLOGY] Chaos in Indian mythology and philosophy
I think that not only darkness (tamas), but also flood (salila), beginning
with  (RV 1, 164.41, 10.129.3), and used, in later texts (up to Smrti
cosmogonies) very consequently to conceive and express the pre-creative
state of the world, which might correspond to the Greek concept of chaos.
Maybe also the concepts of asat (RV 10.72.2, 10.129.4) as opposing to sat,
cosmos.
