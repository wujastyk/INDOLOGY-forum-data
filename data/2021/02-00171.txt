[INDOLOGY] Re: On the Date of Classical Tamil Poems
Dear Palaniappan,
thanks for this.
Maybe one could add to the list of such usages the phrase ????? ??????? 
[aruvi y-?mpal], which was considered as striking enough to be chose as 
a title for the poem Pati??uppattu 63 (which is part of the decade 
composed by Kapilar)
