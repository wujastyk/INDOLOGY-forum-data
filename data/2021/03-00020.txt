A few years ago, I wrote a brief outline of burial practices in Hindu traditions. Perhaps, for those who are interested in this topic, it could be useful.

It was taken by Dr. Vasant Shinde of the Department of Archaeology at Deccan College and dated by Dr. Gwen Robbins to the 6th cen BCE. I reference this image and dig in an article on the roots of sam?dhi burial coming out in the spring issue of Oxford Journal of Hindu Studies. The issue itself is part of a special double issue on sam?dhis, tombs, and relics co-edited by Brian Hatcher, Abhishek Amar and myself.
