[INDOLOGY] Re: Puranas
Thank you to David Reigle for this list and thank you to Peter Wyzlic for
the reference to the Epic and pura?n?ic bibliography.  On looking at Ludo
Rocher's "The Puranas" in "A History of Indian Literature" (1986) I see he
also has a bibliography for each purana he lists and a list of editions and
also a general bibliography.
