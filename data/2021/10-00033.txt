[INDOLOGY] Question about the Indian grammatical tradition's impact
 on Western philology and linguistics
Dear colleagues and friends,
I have an undergraduate student interested in getting a better 
understanding on the impact of the Indian grammatical tradition on 19th 
century philology and early 20th century linguistics. I would be 
grateful to receive some suggestions of books and article he, and I for 
that matter, might read.
Best wishes,
Brendan
