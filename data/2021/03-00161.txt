[INDOLOGY] Re: deva+nagari
The older I get, the more I feel that devanagari got its name because only the gods have eyes sharp enough to read it. I can?t help thinking it?s unfortunate that devanagari became the standard writing system for Sanskrit instead of grantha (which was only ever used for Sanskrit) or one of the other South Indian writing systems. Even Gujarati, which is close to devanagari, is easier to read, with more differentiation between the different ak?aras. I can no longer read my devanagari books, something not true of Tamil. Thank heavens for pdf?s that allow one to increase the size of devanagari printing until it is legible to aging eyes. George Hart
