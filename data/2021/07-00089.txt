Subject: [INDOLOGY] IFP Shaivite transcript collection in Muktabodha digital
 library
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_mZbaGG+=1wZ=eArcmiXoqrEww3a5B_sbx7GMTNaFnpg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
About 6 months ago, the Muktabodha digital library was moved to a new
server.  When that move happened, some pages in the pdfs of the IFP
Shaivite transcript collection became corrupted.  As of a few days ago, all
of these pdfs with corrupt pages have been replaced with good copies.

If you've downloaded any transcripts from the IFP Shaivite transcript
collection in the past 6 months, its probably a good idea to redownload
them.

Thank you,
Harry Spier
