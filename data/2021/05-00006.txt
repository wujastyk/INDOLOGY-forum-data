[INDOLOGY] =?utf-8?q?Stahl_of_the_Soci=C3=A9t=C3=A9_Asiatique?=
Dear colleagues,
Might any of you know the first name and lifespan of "Stahl," who 
succeeded Eug?ne Burnouf as secretary of the Soci?t? Asiatique de 
Paris?? He seems always to have signed just "Stahl," and references to 
him seem to be only to "M[onsieur] Stahl." He was a very active member 
of the Soci?t? Asiatique, but Raymond Schwab does not mention him in /La 
Renaissance Orientale.

I would be grateful for any pointers,
Rosane Rocher
