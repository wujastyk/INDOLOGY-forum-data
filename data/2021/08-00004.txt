[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Library courses and Web-based Sanskrit homework
 exercises
Dear Colleagues,
The Sanskrit Library would like to announce three courses beginning from 6 September and the debut of Web-based Sanskrit homework exercises:
CG20. Introduction to the P??inian tradition, beginning 18 September.
This course offers an overview of the architecture of P??ini?s A???dhy?y? as well as an introduction to the whole Indian grammatical tradition.
US101a. Introductory Sanskrit Ia, beginning 12 September.
This is the first of four courses Ia--b, IIa-b, offered in four quarters over the coming year that presents a linguistically rich introduction to Sanskrit equivalent to a first-year graduate course.  In this course, we are excited to roll-out sophisticated automated exercises that provide immediate feed-back to students while doing their homework.  The Web-based exercises avoid the doubt and frustration that students feel from flipping pages in dictionaries and grammar books by using cutting-edge software to provide glossary access via a flex-search interface, error-highlighting, linked help pages, etc.
UP113. Introductory Sanskrit Ia. Kir?t?rjun?ya sarga 1, beginning 6 September.
This coures reads the first canto of the Kir?t?rjun?ya, one of the Sanskrit Mah?k?vyas, applying traditional oral methods of thoroughly analyzing the prosody, grammar and syntax of each verse.
