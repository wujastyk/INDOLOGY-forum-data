Dear colleagues,
Would anyone happen to have V?japeya 1955 Performance Committee manual:
*The ?rauta Ritual and the V?japeya Sacrifice*. Poona: V?japeya Performance
Committee, 1955 .
And the film by Dr J.A.B. van Buitenen of the V?japeya in Poona and
13-page unpublished  typescript "*Vajapeya: English commentary*"
(1956)  accompanying the film.
With thanks and best wishes,
Yours,
Natalia Korneeva
