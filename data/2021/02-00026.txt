[INDOLOGY] Re: Upgrade of the Mailman software
Dear Patrick, it's very kind of you to think of this aspect.  In fact, our
host company, EMWD.com, offered us this upgrade free of charge.  It's still
quite a modest quarterly charge and I can pay it easily.  As before, I
would rather just pay it and not have the hassle associated with
fundraising.  But thank you very much indeed for thinking of it!
