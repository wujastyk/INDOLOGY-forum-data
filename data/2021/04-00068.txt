Thanks to all for your responses.
The book indeed exists and is available from the publisher only as an ebook.
Some hard copies do seem still to be floating around Amazon and other third-party distributors.

thanks again for your rapid and plentiful replies,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] an Austrian mystery

Dear friends,

Ole Holten Pind's work on Dign?ga is listed on the website of the Press of the Austrian Academy:
https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/ikga/publikationen/reihen/beitraege-zur-kultur-und-geistesgeschichte-asiens-bkga/dignagas-philosophy-of-language

However, when one tries to "order online" the link does not work. And to search from the Academy's homepage https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/
is similarly fruitless.

Does anyone have any ideas about whether the book really exists and, if so, how it can be ordered?

thanks in advance,
Matthew
