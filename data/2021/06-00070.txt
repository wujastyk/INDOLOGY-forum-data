Subject: [INDOLOGY] Where can you do a BA in Sanskrit?
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CfdMmq8WM4K60+G8HdO=LbTovgj3ZrrP+siY-TzPKy2LQ@mail.gmail.com>

What universities offer a BA in the Sanskrit language?

   - Oxford (link
   <https://www.ed.ac.uk/literatures-languages-cultures/asian-studies/sanskrit/undergraduate-study>
   )
   - [add yours here]

I do mean a BA devoted specifically to Sanskrit language and literature,
not courses where it is a component, like area studies, South Asian
civilization, etc.

Best,
Dominik
