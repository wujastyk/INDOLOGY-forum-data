Dear Paolo,
besides the excellent resources that were just recommended by other colleagues, you may have a look at the recent article by the late Yuri Khokhlov (who untimely passed away just a few weeks ago): 
"Uncovering Amoghavajra's Legacy in the Hexi Corridor and Tibet?', Zangxue xuekan ????/Journal of Tibetology  21 (2019): 48?133, Beijing: China Tibetology Publishing House. Available on https://www.academia.edu/42179583/Uncovering_Amoghavajras_legacy_in_the_Hexi_Corridor_and_Tibet <https://www.academia.edu/42179583/Uncovering_Amoghavajras_legacy_in_the_Hexi_Corridor_and_Tibet>
A thoroughly revised version of the article will appear (as ?In the Footsteps of Amoghavajra (705?774): Southern Indian Artistic Mode in Tang China and its Transmission to Tibet?) in a volume edited by Peter Sharrock and myself, hopefully before the end of the current year.
Best,
Andrea
