[INDOLOGY] Chaos in Indian mythology and philosophy
Dear Dmitry,
When you refer to the Western concept of "chaos," I wonder if you mean the
Greek idea of a primordial chaos from which the cosmos emerged. If so, we
would have to think of the primeval "darkness" (tamas) in Sanskrit texts
such as Rigveda 10.129.
