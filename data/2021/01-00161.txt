The village gods of South Indiaby Whitehead, Henry, 1853-1947
The archive.org page has the following:

" This book by Henry Whitehead is quite interesting; it details the rituals
practiced in villages in South India.

However, it should be born in mind that the author was a Christian
missionary, whose main objective was to convert people. Hence, the parts of
the text where the author makes judgements and comparisons about the
rituals, or what they mean, should not be taken too literally.

Overall, good information about rituals in South idea; ignore the
judgements, comparisons and theories. "
