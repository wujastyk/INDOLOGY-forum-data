[INDOLOGY] Modality in ancient Indian philosophy

Dear all,
I would like to ask a similar question on the Naiy?yikas? concept of
atyant?bh?va (absolute non-existence; non-existence in all time). I have
been wondering if impossibility is a fair interpretation. It?ll be great if
someone is aware of any relevant discussions.
Best,
Lee Ling
