[INDOLOGY] request re Benfey
Might a kind colleague be able and willing to share a copy in any form 
of Meta Benfey's biography of her father, Theodor Benfey, apparently 
privately printed in 1909? I am particularly interested in his early 
years in Frankfurt (1830?1832) and Heidelberg (1832?1834). According to 
Windisch's /Geschichte der Sanskrit-Philologie/, the relevant section 
would include pages 19?20.
With thanks and best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
