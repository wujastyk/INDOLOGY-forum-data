Dear M?rcis,


It is hard to know where to begin, since - as the opening of the
Dhanvantarinigha??u puts it, "there is no limit to the names of medical
substances" and there is much scholarship from different traditions on
this topic. But in addition to the sources already mentioned, quite useful
reference works (especially when used in conjunction with each other)
are: Chatterjee
& Pakrashi, *Treatise on Indian Medicinal Plants*; *Chopra's* *Indigenous
Drugs of India*; Kirtikar & Basu, *Indian Medical Plants*; Nadkarni, *Indian
Materia Medica*; Sharma, *Fruits and Vegetables in Ancient India*. (PV
Sharma has a number of other books that might interest you.) There are also
excellent English translations of al-B?r?n?'s pharmacological text as well
as Book 2 of Ibn S?n?'s *Canon* that might enjoy looking through. I am
happy to share PDFs off list.


In addition to the excellent Pandanus Database of Indian Plants already
mentioned, the following databases might also be useful for your project:


e-Nighantu, developed by the National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage:
https://niimh.nic.in/ebooks/e-Nighantu/


and


IMPPAT: Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics database,
hosted by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc), Chennai:
https://cb.imsc.res.in/imppat/


Take care,

Eric
