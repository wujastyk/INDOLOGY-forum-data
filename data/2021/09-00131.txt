For our purposes, it is good to follow the publishing history of the Akan????u by V?. Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r. It should be noted that the whole Akan????u was published by Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r on 1923 June 27 (Rutir?tk?ri ??i 13). In 1926, he published Akan????u Part 1 (Ka?i??iy??ai Nirai) with the old commentary for the first 90 poems and his own commentary for poems 91-120. In 1933, he published Akan????u Part 3 (Nittilakk?vai). The interesting thing about this is that the cover page shows the date ?r?muka year and ?va?i month (1933 August-September) but the preface by Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r is dated ?r?muka year and ?ippaci month (1933 October-November). This suggests that the cover page of Part 3 was printed in August-September of 1933 but the rest of the volume was printed only by 1933 October-November. From his preface to the Nittilakk?vai, it looks like he did not publish Part 2 (Ma?imi?aipava?am) as a separate volume. As mentioned earlier, the complete Akan????u was also published by Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r with the cover page showing the date ?r?muka year and ?ippaci month (1933 October-November). This is summarized in the table below.

Two changes in readings relevant to our discussion occur between 1923 and 1933 editions. The variant reading is given in parenthesis.

UVS view???????? p?? n???u (p?????u)??????? palv?? p??a? (palv?? p??ar)????? in comments for 113, UVS links with 325 based on published??????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????? Civacuppirama?iya? (UVSL) edition of 1990.? Per Mahadevan, UVS connects 

155 with 113 and 325. Since the 1990 edition shows palv?? p??ar as both the chosen reading as well as the variant, I consider p??ar to be a printing error and p??a? to be correct in 325. ?If anybody can share a picture of the UVS manuscript pages for poems 155 and 355, it will be very helpful. ?????? ??????????? ??????????? 

 

Conspicuously absent in the two index entries, (p??a? and p??a???u) is poem 155 as can be seen in the attached index page. (The index page for Part 3 also shows the same connections.) So, even at the time of printing the index, which could be sometime between 1933 August-September and October-November, Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r had not emended/chosen p?? n???u to p?????u. But, by October-November, when he printed the complete volume, he had made the emendation/choice and he has given notes, from which we can infer the reasons for his emendation/choice. I have attached the pages from the 1933 edition.

 

Looking at the emendation/choice Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r made in poem 155 and the notes he has given, we can infer the following as his views.

 
Although, he does not explicitly link poem 155 with 113 and 325, the fact that he glosses pa?a? as ?a warrior? shows he has implicitly done so. 
Since he glosses p?? as p??a? citing the Pu?apporu? Ve?p?m?lai, where p??a? is used in the sense of ?a bard?, and he also glosses p??a? as a warrior, Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r seems to identify the warrior as a bard. 
In poem 113, P??a? is described as being engaged in cattle-raiding and having a lot of food. Poem 155 mentions there were many milch cattle in his land. This suggests that his land could not be described as ?ruined? or ?barren?, which is what p?? n??u would mean. 
The original place name in the text must have been p????u < p??+n??u and all the earlier copyists of manuscripts had reinterpreted p????u as p??+na?u.
 

In his preface to the 1933 edition, Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r says that he obtained some additional manuscripts after 1926 and that the revised readings were based on the additional manuscripts and further research. Could the UVS? unpublished manuscript with notes have influenced Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r? 

 

Wilden says in her introduction to the critical edition that R. Raghavaiyangar had used a manuscript from Aiyar, which she wonders if it was from UVS. (See pp. xxxiv and xxxv in the attachment.) The reading ?Aiyar? is a misreading of a word in the printed preface by R. Raghavaiyangar. The word uses a symbol used in the Tamil society to indicate ?what has been mentioned above?. ?See attached page from the 1933 edition. The manuscript in question was from Ti. Ta. Ka?akacuntaram Pi??ai and not any ?Aiyar?. 

 

Even apart from the above manuscript, the difference between ?palv??? used by UVS and ?nalv??? in poem 325 used by Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r suggests he must have had a different source to adopt the reading, which he had earlier considered a variant. Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r probably had access to another manuscript. Or he might have come to know about the reading ?p??a-r???ra? in the Loka Vibh?ga, which was brought to the attention of epigraphists by R. Narasimhachar in Mysore Archaeological Department Reports for 1909 and 1910 and mentioned by Lewis Rice in Epigraphia Indica of 1917-18.

 

This suggests that although Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r may not have provided all the details regarding his choice of/emendation as ?p???ttu? in poem 155, I think he has given enough to justify that to be the critical reading. The fact that the Pa?aiyanpa??u inscription, which was discovered more than more than 40 years after Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r published the 1933 edition, has p???ttu? seems to validate Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r?s choice or emendation.

 

Thank you in advance.
