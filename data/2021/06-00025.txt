[INDOLOGY] Indian sites of learning
Dear friends,
Might any of you be able to point me to good sociological or anthropological studies - or sound personal testimonies - of programs of study in traditional mathas and pathasalas? Or other institutionalized settings in which Sanskrit learning was cultivated?
I am not interested in work on renunciate communities that does not engage rather precisely with the question of formal education.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
