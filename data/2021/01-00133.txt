[INDOLOGY] Question about Gandhari Prakrit
Thanks, Andrew, for providing several clarifications. I am exploring the
degree of disconnect of the ?ryavarta centered culture reflected in the
Mah?bh??ya of Pata?jali from the northwestern region of P??ini. Pata?jali
does occasionally refer to Kashmir.  I wonder if the region of Kamboja that
is referred to by Pata?jali would include P??ini's ?al?tura.  If my memory
serves me, Thieme takes Kamboja to refer to the eastern Iranian border
regions.
