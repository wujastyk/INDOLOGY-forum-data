[INDOLOGY] =?utf-8?q?saptavr=CC=A5ddhi/saptah=C4=81ni?=
Greetings all,
A colleague who wishes to remain anonymous reminded me that similar enumeration appears frequently in the Pali tradition ... for instance in the ?Sabba Buddhanubhavena...? prayer. 
I am presently on the move so I am unable to access my digital library. I will provide a more thorough citation once I?m settled. In the meantime, if you see p. 94 of the prayer book found here:
https://www.sunnataram.org/uploads/498/english-chanting-book-dec2012.pdf
You will see (forgive the lack of diacritics... copy-pasted due to present conditions):
AYU-VADDHAKO DHANA-VADDHAKO SIRI-VADDHAKO YASA-VADDHAKO BALA-VADDHAKO VANNA-VADDHAKO SUKHA-VADDHAKO HOTU SABBADA.
(Again, note ?dhana? instead of ?dharma? just as Prof. Lubin points out in the Nev? citation).
Sincerely,
Westin Harris
