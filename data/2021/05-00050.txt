Dear Herman,
Dear VSR,
dear Srilata,
dear all,
being on multiple mailing list is frequently quite nice.
I finally understood just now what Herman's question was all about by 
seeing this picture and its caption
(I do not know whether the .png picture will make it to the list but it 
is reachable via the links)

I had never seen the use of green palm-leaf
I wonder whether the botanical species of palm leaf used here (as 
measurement tool) is the same as that of the palm leaf used for writing?
Herman, are you writing  review of this 2007 book?
Best wishes to all
