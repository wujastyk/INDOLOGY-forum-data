[INDOLOGY] Re: -t/-d
And apologies, I should have said explicitly that I am referring to the
Nom/Acc Ntr Sg forms! I'm actually unsure what we reconstruct for ablative
forms such as tasm?t (also an original -d based e.g. on Old Latin ablatives
in -od (long o)/-?d?) and don't have my books with me right now. But I'm
sure the other Indo-Europeanists on the List will be able to answer this.
All best,
