Thanks a million, Jacob!
If anyone else encountered a similar one - in India, in a temple, being used, anything - please send me a message off-list.

That is, of course, only a drop in the ocean of yantras, but at least it is a good place to start. The text was critically edited by Hans-Georg T?rstig in 1988, but I do not have a digital scan at hand.

There does not seem to be any obvious connection to games, though the Yantracint?ma?i does contain a similar yantra for achieving success in games (yantra no. 73). It is inscribed on an 8x8 grid which is navigated by a knight's tour (v?jikrama). This means that you place a chess-knight in one space, and then jump around the grid according to the knight's move until you have landed on all the squares without landing on the same square twice. If you do it correctly, the resulting series of 64 syllables go together to form two ?lokas which can be used as a mantra to ensure success in games.
