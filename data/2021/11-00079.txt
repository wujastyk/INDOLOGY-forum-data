Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ritual use of camphor
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_qZOnX-WMtqMHF4c94fzOf7iE8Sf_EnM08ei4Ddmh_5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I've been asked to find out if in the ritual use of camphor, waving or
placing before an Indian deity etc., burning pellets are ever placed
*floating* on water in a vessel. Any  information would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
