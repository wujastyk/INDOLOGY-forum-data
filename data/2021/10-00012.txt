Dear List members,

Recently someone has spread a grafitto all over the centre of The Hague. He (I take 'him' to be a man) did not follow the code of grafitti artists and in some places wrote his text over picture of his colleagues (not in the case of the attached picture). His grafitto consists of text only. To me it looks like a Devan?gar? related script. Could someone help me to decipher it.

Herman
