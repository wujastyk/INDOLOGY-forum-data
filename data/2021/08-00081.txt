Dear Colleague,

Even as early as the Rig Veda there is evidence, both for ? occurring after a-vowels and for s occurring after i- and u-vowels. See the evidence further below.

What made the distribution of s and ? unpredictable is the fact that Proto-Indo-Iranian ?, the source of Skt. ? is of two sources. One if the development of earlier s to ? after ?RUKI? (i.e. r-sounds, u-sounds, velars, and i-sounds; in the case of the vocalic sounds, both syllabic and nonsyllabic); the other was the development of PIE *? to ? before obstruent. Examples are nis- > ni? ?down? and o?t? > a?t? ?eight?.

As the second example shows, the second of these changes introduced ? after a-vowels and thus made the RUKI outcome of s opaque and hence contrastive (consider e.g. Skt. asta- ?thrown? beside a???(u) ?8?, with s and ? contrasting after a-vowel.

This contrastiveness, in turn, made it possible for analogical processes to extend ? into contexts after a-vowels (as in pary-a-?asvajat) as well as for borrowings and the like with ? after a-vowels and s after ?RUKI? to be adopted without further adjustment.

All the best,
