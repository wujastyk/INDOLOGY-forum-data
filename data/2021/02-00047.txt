Dear Prof Rocher,

I think the biography of Benfey you are looking for is the same as the 
one that is included in his /Kleine Schriften/ (ed. A. Bezzenberger, 
vol. 1, pp. vii-xl; the Frankfurt episode pp. xiii-xvii therein).

Unfortunately I don't have a pdf of that book or a scanner at hand right 
now...

Maybe somebody else on the list can provide you with those pages.

Best regards from Hannover

Tim
