Dear Prof. Hock
Greetings.
Some corrections are in order and I hope they are coming not all
that belatedly.
In the set a,  in the second sentence, the indirect object  phrase
*k?yilukku.p
*would not be repeated.
             *avarka?           mutalil             k?yilukku
       p?varka?*
they                 first                 temple.dat      go.fut.3pl.mf
*k?yilukku.p     p?y-i                p?cai               ceyv?rka?*
                      go-cvb             worship           do.fut.3pl.mf
And with the third sentence also the direct object phrase *p?cai* would not
be repeated as well   and
  then, as Dr.Palaniappan has already pointed out here in this thread, the
converb would also take different form like *ceytuvi??u *
where the past adverbial form of the auxiliary verb *vi?u* is appended to
the past adverbial form of the main verb to add a perfective aspect [Lehmann
1993:209, 271

]
Moreover normally a temporal adverb like *appu**t?am* (or *appu**t?ant?*n?
with the emphatic clitic *t?**n? *[Lehman 1993:158]) would be added as well
with a stress on its leading syllable to indicate the finality.
*p?cai               cey-tu  **ceytuvi??u *                  *appu**t?am* *
                               ka?aikku.p       p?v?rka?         ?*
worship           do-cvb+-finish-past-adverbial-participle (having done
that)   then-ADV                     shop.dat         go.fut.3pl.mf
