APOLOGIES FOR CROSS-POSTING

Dear friends,

I cordially invite you for our lecture series "Religious Traditions of India", organized in the frame of the UGent Humanities Academie. The lectures can be followed online and/or on campus. After each on campus lecture (Aud. 2 Blandijn), we offer you a small reception at our department (Blandijn, 5th floor).

The online lectures are free. The program is posted below.

For registration (to get the URL): https://humanitiesacademie.ugent.be/religious-traditions-of-india.
