 Speaking of "the oceanic littoral" mentioned here, can anyone point me to *reliable* sources that discuss the submerged ruins off the coast of India and their ramifications? I've heard there are some off of Dwaraka and others down south near Chennai.
 Discussions of Lemuria and Atlantis are not what I'm looking for. 
Best,
Dean
