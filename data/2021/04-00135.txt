  Dear all,
  In the first place, I would like to say that I am excited about the
seminar, for which I am already registered, and that I greatly look forward
to it.
  On the other hand, I find the 10:1 ratio of men to women among the
programmed speakers troubling since there is no dearth of female scholars
in several fields that would have had much to say. Certainly Prof. Jurewicz
would have been an ideal speaker for the seminar given her field of
expertise and experience.
  I do understand how we often, when organizing events, first appeal to our
immediate community and acquaintances, but I do want to encourage the field
to pay closer attention to how we configure our projects, events, and
initiatives.
