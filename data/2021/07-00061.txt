Please feel free to share the link! We do have a few ground-rules:

? Please refrain from making *recordings* of the presentations.

? Keep your microphone *muted* during the presentations.

? We will not tolerate any *offensive or abusive language.* The 
organizers reserve the right to remove individuals who break these rules.

? Lastly, we would like to ask you, if circumstances permit, to consider 
turning on your *camera* during the presentations and especially during 
the Q&A sessions (the reason for this is that interacting with a black 
screens is somewhat unsatisfactory for most presenters). Of course, this 
is not a rule, but only a suggestion.

Here is the schedule (please also find the entire programme attached as 
well as online:
