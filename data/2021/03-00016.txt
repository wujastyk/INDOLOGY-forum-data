[INDOLOGY] Re: archeological puzzle
Dear Matthew,
The skeletal image shown in this article is from a dig at Balathal in
Rajasthan. It was taken by Dr. Vasant Shinde of the Department of
Archaeology at Deccan College and dated by Dr. Gwen Robbins to the 6th cen
BCE. I reference this image and dig in an article on the roots of sam?dhi
burial coming out in the spring issue of Oxford Journal of Hindu Studies.
The issue itself is part of a special double issue on sam?dhis, tombs, and
relics co-edited by Brian Hatcher, Abhishek Amar and myself.

Environment: Journal of the Indian Society for Prehistoric and Quaternary
Studies. Volume XX, Number 1 (January - June 1995).
