Dear all,
I have been asked on the possible source of a simile of Yaj?adatta falling in love with his own reflection in a mirror and going mad, mentioned in the ??ra?gama S?tra (???????), a Chinese Buddhist text, probably composed in Tang China, during the early eighth century CE:
 "Did you hear about Yajnadatta from Shravasti who on impulse one morning held a mirror to his face and fell in love with the head in the mirror? He gazed at the eyes and eyebrows but got angry because he could not see his own face. He decided he must be a mountain or river sprite, lost control, and ran madly about. What do you think? Why did this person set out on a mad cause for no reason?"
Purna said,  "That person was insane. There's no other reason."

Has anybody encountered this story in other Indian or Chinese sources?
Thank you in advance!
Best regards,
Dimitry
