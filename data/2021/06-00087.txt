Dear Dean et al,
There are assuredly others, but one place to find a detailed account of the early study of Sanskrit in the West (and especially its French connections through Burnouf and others) is Raymond Schwab, _The Oriental Renaissance: Europe's Rediscovery of India and the East, 1680-1880_, New York: Columbia University Press, 1984. (translation; originally published in French, 1950).
