Oskar von Hin?ber suggests here that the Therav?da tradition offers no support for a derivation of sutta from s?kta. (In der Therav?da-?berlieferung findet die Annahme, da? sutta- eigentlich s?kta- entspr?che, nirgends eine St?tze, wie die lange Er?rterung  zu sutta-, As 19, 15?26 mit aller Deutlichkeit zeigt.)

However, the Atthas?lini passage cited here (= Sp I 19 = Sv I 17) quotes and explains a mnemonic verse that offers 6 ways of taking sutta; the second of these is precisely s?kta (Pali suvutta):

"As revealing benefits, as well spoken (suvutta), as productive, as yielding,
as sheltering well, as a universal measuring cord, it is called sutta.?

"For a sutta reveals various benefits for ourselves and others. And in it these benefits are spoken well (suvutta) since they are spoken in accordance with the disposition of those who are to be trained ?"

Oskar von Hin?ber (1994: ?Die Neun A?gas,? p. 132) approvingly cites Mayrhofer?s judgment (EWA III/ 492) that the derivation from s?kta is ?entbehrlich?; he cites a long discussion of the term in Buddhaghosa?s Atthas?lin? 19.15?26 as evidence against it.

Dear Jim,

See Max Walleser's 1914 book, footnote on p. 4:

K. R. Norman and Gombrich accepted this suggestion. I suppose Pollock got it from Gombrich.

Dear all,

Sheldon Pollock in The Language of the Gods in the World of Men (p. 52) suggests that the Buddhist term ?sutta? does not derive from the Sanskrit s?tra, but rather from s?kta. Sanskrit double consonant clusters do show regular assimilation, regressively and progressively, in Prakrit, where two different consonants become a double of one of them. I?m interested in hearing learned opinion on Pollock?s suggestion. I had not noticed this interesting detail, when I first read this book some years ago.
