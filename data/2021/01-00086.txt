[INDOLOGY] recommended software for diacritical marks in Romanized Sanskrit transliteration?
Dear Piotr,
   You cannot send a ?.zip? file through a Listserv; it will be deleted as a security precaution (some systems will automatically execute them, which makes them a vector for malware & viruses).
   Instead, you should upload the .zip file to a file-sharing website and provide the download link in your email.  
Regards,
Paul Hackett
