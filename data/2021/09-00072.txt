[INDOLOGY] Interpreting the Pew Report at Brown University
Dear colleagues?
As many of you know, the Pew Research Center recently published a massive and fascinating report on religions in India <https://www.pewforum.org/2021/06/29/religion-in-india-tolerance-and-segregation/>. I write now to invite you to an upcoming virtual webinar at the Center for Contemporary South Asia, ?Interpreting the Pew Report on Religions in India: A Conversation with Neha Sahgal.? This event will take place this Friday, September 17 from 2-4 pm EST (pre-registration required). Along with Dr. Sahgal, the report?s lead author from Pew, our conversation will feature commentary on the report?s findings from Elaine Fisher (Stanford University), Anand Taneja (Vanderbilt University), and Pradeep Chhibber (UC Berkeley).
You can find further details and information on registration on our website <https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/events/2021/interpreting-pew-report-religions-india-discussion-neha-sahgal>. I hope you?ll join us?and encourage your colleagues and students to do the same!
Yours,
