Dear list members,
The word n?r??jana or n?r??jana appears  in a few of the tantric texts of
Muktabodha. But I can't find it in any of the dictionaries.  Is this just
another spelling for nira?jana meaning the pure one, or another spelling of
n?r?jana meaning "the waving of lights" or does it have another meaning.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
