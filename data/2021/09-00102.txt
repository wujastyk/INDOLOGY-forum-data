[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit terms on title pages of books
 <874kan3tmj.fsf@lmu.de>
I should have sent to the list at the time, but guess I didn't, this one (Harvard-Kyoto):
bhASAbhASya
Literally, of course, "vernacular commentary," but in my observation more like an expanded translation, into Hindi, without discussing difficulties of interpretation. Bhaktivedanta Swami's translations into English of Vaishnava works use a similar procedure, though the degree of expansion he uses is far larger.
