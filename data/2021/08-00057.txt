It depends upon how narrowly or widely one defines the word "mnemonic".
There are a good deal of aids for memorization in Sanskrit, especially in
various ??stras and for the Vedic reciters. One such device is used in
helping memorize P??ini's A???dhy?y?. For each P?da, there is a string that
includes the first words of rules 1, 20, 40, 60 etc. and the number of
rules in the final odd lot. For example, the string for the first P?da is:
????????????????????????:????????????????????. There are 32 such strings
for the entire A???dhy?y?. One is expected to memorize the entire
A???dhy?y?. But to find the numerical place of any given rule, if one
begins reciting with that rule, very quickly one hits one of the location
markers in one of these strings, and then it is an easy calculation.  My
senior classmate in Pune, Mr. S.L. Athlekar used to do this in a split
second, and then he taught his 8 year old daughter to do this. So this was
a very efficient system.
