Dear List members,
from the reactions of Victor Davella and Patrick Olivelle (both off list) it is clear that the use of Jamb?dv?pa as referring to peninsular India is most probably late.
The information provided by Rajam put me on the trail of a South Indian goddess Camp?pati. She is mentioned in Ma?im?kalai 6. 190 and in the Patikam to this text, line 8. Especially the Patikam passage is interesting. It mentions a goddess who, after she has practiced austerities under a campu (Jamb?) tree (campu k??), went to the South (te? ticai), where she became known as Camp?pati. At the same time, I wonder if there is a direct link between camp? and campu.

Dear Professor Tieken,
It would help if we look at the usage of the following words in Old Tamil [I don?t know exactly how old they are] texts:
?????, ????????, ???????????, ?????, ?????????? ?
Thanks and Regards,
rajam

Dear list members,
in a contribution by Gokul Sashadri in Kulke et al, Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa. Delhi: Manohar, p. 107, I came across a reference to Jambudv?pa in a late (seventeenth century) P?li text, namely the Gandhava?sa, in which Jambudv?pa would be used to refer to peninsular India. I am interested to know if this interpretation is correct for the Gandhava?sa and if we have to do with an old (how old?) use of the word.
With kind regards, Herman
