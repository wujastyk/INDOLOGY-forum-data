Dear Walter,
Thank you for sending this on. I have signed and I encourage others to do
the same. The link you provided in the second message,
https://www.openpetition.de/petition/online/kahlschlag-an-der-mlu-verhindern-fakultaeten-retten
worked
for me. Please do let us all know if there is any other ways to support the
study of South Asian languages and cultures at the University of Halle,
Best,
Luther
