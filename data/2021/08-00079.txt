Dear List member,
as may be gathered from my previous question about a r?ckl?ufiges dictionary of Tamil, I have no good overview of texts available in electronic form. Now, another question in that area: I like to know if, and if so, where an electronic version of Villiputt?r???r's Mak?p?ratam is available. I came across a reference to a book/parvan called campava, which I would like to check.
Wiith kind regards, Herman
