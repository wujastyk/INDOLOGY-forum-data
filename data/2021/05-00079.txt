Dear Caley,
In your reactions I think you have put the finger where it hurts, where the
comparison is indeed entirely fraught.
I especially like your remarks:
(1) ... the middle (even late) Vedic situation ... derives directly from a
real pastoral/horticultural mode of subsistence in which pasturage/fields
are not part of self-idealization but actually the basis of food production.
(2) ... the focus is really on the poetic-priestly tradition and these
patrons as the audience.
(3) ... we would speak of Vedic "ceremony-networks".
It is remarkable how arguments about ancient India often try to move around
on the map monolithic and mono-linguistic communities, without inner
differentiation and inner (social, sociolinguistic) dynamics.
Your work is an exception, as is the work of Heesterman and a few others.
All best,
Jan
