Dear list members,

Verse 3 of the D?ridryadahana?ivastotram is:

bhaktipriy?ya bhavarogabhay?pah?ya

ugr?ya durgabhavas?garat?ra??ya |

jyotirmay?ya gu?an?masun?tyak?ya

d?ridryadu?khadahan?ya nama? ?iv?ya ||


I'm having difficulty translating gu?an?ma in this verse.  Its been
suggested to me that line 3 might be  jyotirmay?ya gu?an?masu n?tyak?ya
instead of  jyotirmay?ya gu?an?masun?tyak?ya but I haven't found that
attested anywhere. Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
