Dear list members,
Verse 3 of the D?ridryadahana?ivastotram is:
bhaktipriy?ya bhavarogabhay?pah?ya
ugr?ya durgabhavas?garat?ra??ya |
jyotirmay?ya gu?an?masun?tyak?ya
d?ridryadu?khadahan?ya nama? ?iv?ya ||
I'm having difficulty translating gu?an?ma in this verse.  Its been
suggested to me that line 3 might be  jyotirmay?ya gu?an?masu n?tyak?ya
instead of  jyotirmay?ya gu?an?masun?tyak?ya but I haven't found that
attested anywhere. Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
