[INDOLOGY] Fwd: who are they?
Bonjour,
I sent this message two days ago and it is still waiting for a moderator 
advice...
I (think) I have found the reason why: my messages have an electronic 
signature attached and the robot seems to not like too much this!
I hope that this message with no signature will reach the list.
Best regards.
