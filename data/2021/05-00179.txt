[INDOLOGY] Help with a simile

Jim, picking up from Prof. Kapstein and Andrea Acri, I am reminded that in
Hindi, the "key" or "Cliff Notes" that people use to study for exams here
in India is called a ku?j?. Basically, with the right ku?j?, you can
"crack" an entrance exam. I realize that the door-key-opening-breaking
through metaphor is continuing here, from ku??alin? yoga to the IIT
qualifying test, which yields its own version of mok?a for the successful
candidates. And certainly getting through such ordeals to breach the
portals of these vaunted institutions -- engineering / medical /
architecture / management / law colleges -- requires a certain ha?ha,
determination, force, effort, discipline, rigour, zor-zabardast?!
I see you don't really need our help, except as a form of "time-pass" in
this unending lockdown...
Yours,
AV.
