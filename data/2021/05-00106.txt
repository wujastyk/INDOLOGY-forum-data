Interestingly ?a?kara gives a similar illustration in his BSBh 1.1.2: ved?nta-v?kya-kusuma-grathan?rthatv?t s?tr???m; ved?nta-v?ky?ni hi s?trair ud?h?tya vic?ryante; "The s?tras ae for knitting the flowers that are the Upani?adic passages; for, the Upani?adic passages themselves are examined through the s?tras."

One benefit of reading sutta as s?kta is that it is no longer mysterious why Brahmanical s?tras are so economical and Buddhist having so much repetition. Later Brahmanical definitions all associate s?tra with being short and having few worlds and syllables.

But this is not really much to support sutta < s?kta, since the regular P?li form parallel to s?kta includes the glide -v-, as Skt ukta ~ P?li vutta and similarly in other MIA languages, which all seem to preserve the initial v- of the verbal root *vac- (Pischel ?337), despite the vowel change a > u before a labial (?104).

And anyway, Buddhaghosa here is offering multiple exegetical ?etymologies? (an old technique beginning already in the Vedic br?hma?a-prose), which are alternative or mutually complementary.  The last of the six offered here relies on the ?thread? meaning, explained using two distinct analogies which, if anything  about the author?s sense of the basic literal meaning of the term is to be inferred from that fact, would point rather to a stronger awareness of sutta as connected with threads:



? suttasabh?ga? c?eta? yath? hi tacchak?na? sutta? pam??a? hoti eva? etam pi vi???na?, yath? ca suttena sa?gah?t?ni pupph?ni na vikir?yanti na viddha?siyanti evam etena sa?gah?t? atth?.



The trans. of the whole passage:



This Scripture shows, expresses, fructifies,

Yields, guards the Good, and is unto the wise

A plumb-line; therefore Sutta is its name.



For it shows what is good for the good of self and others.

It is well expressed to suit the wishes of the audience. It has

been said that it fructifies the Good, as crops fructify their

fruit; that it yields the Good as a cow yields milk; and that

it well protects and guards the Good. It is a measure to the

wise as the plumb-line is to carpenters. And just as flowers

strung together are not scattered nor destroyed, so the Good

strung together by it does not perish. Hence it has been said,

to facilitate the study of the word-definition:



This Scripture shows, expresses, fructifies,

Yields, guards the Good, and is unto the wise

A plumb-line; therefore Sutta is its name.

(tr. Maung Tin, The Expositor, v. 1, PTE (1920), p. 24



Best,
Tim

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] The Buddhist term sutta



Oskar von Hin?ber suggests here that the Therav?da tradition offers no support for a derivation of sutta from s?kta. (In der Therav?da-?berlieferung findet die Annahme, da? sutta- eigentlich s?kta- entspr?che, nirgends eine St?tze, wie die lange Er?rterung  zu sutta-, As 19, 15?26 mit aller Deutlichkeit zeigt.)



However, the Atthas?lini passage cited here (= Sp I 19 = Sv I 17) quotes and explains a mnemonic verse that offers 6 ways of taking sutta; the second of these is precisely s?kta (Pali suvutta):



"As revealing benefits, as well spoken (suvutta), as productive, as yielding,

as sheltering well, as a universal measuring cord, it is called sutta.?

"For a sutta reveals various benefits for ourselves and others. And in it these benefits are spoken well (suvutta) since they are spoken in accordance with the disposition of those who are to be trained ?"

Dear Jim,



See Max Walleser's 1914 book, footnote on p. 4:

K. R. Norman and Gombrich accepted this suggestion. I suppose Pollock got it from Gombrich.

Dear all,



Sheldon Pollock in The Language of the Gods in the World of Men (p. 52) suggests that the Buddhist term ?sutta? does not derive from the Sanskrit s?tra, but rather from s?kta. Sanskrit double consonant clusters do show regular assimilation, regressively and progressively, in Prakrit, where two different consonants become a double of one of them. I?m interested in hearing learned opinion on Pollock?s suggestion. I had not noticed this interesting detail, when I first read this book some years ago.
