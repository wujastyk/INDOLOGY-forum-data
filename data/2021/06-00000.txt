I'd like to give a special shout for Adam?s Reports.  Adam's heart was in the right place and he visited scores of Tols, interviewed Pandits, and gave a very detailed and positive picture of indigenous education.  Where it was weak, he thought it merited support; he also saw its real strengths and its embeddedness in north Indian culture.  He described syllabuses in different Tols, gave lists of the Sanskrit texts that the students studied, analysed the differences between kids who were headed for intellectual lives and those who needed practical bookkeeping skills.  It's an extraordinary first-hand account of an almost-vanished education system.

Best,
Dominik
