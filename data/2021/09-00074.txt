Dear List Members,
On behalf of a colleague who is not a List member I would like to ask if anyone could share a pdf copy of Fujii, M. & Parpola, A. (2016). Manuscripts of Jaiminiya Samaveda traced and photographed in 2002-2006. In A. Parpola & P. Koskikallio (eds.), Vedic Investigations (pp. 127-162) (Papers of the 12th World Sanskrit Conference, vol. 1). Motilal Banarsidass.
I would be very grateful for your help.
Regards
