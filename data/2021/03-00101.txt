I feel somewhat stupid, but I have a citation in a book I am editing and I had traced it to ??ik??grantha 31.7?. But for the life of my I cannot trace this book in my computer!! Would anyone have some idea about it? The two verses cited from it are:

??? ?????????? ?
????: ???? ?? ?????? ????? ??????? ?????? ?
?????? ?????? ?? ?????? ???? ???????? ??????? ?
???????????? ??????????????? ?????????????? ?
??????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????? ? ??? ? 

Thanks for your help.
