Thanks, Tim. The double-entendre has been on my mind too. You have no problem with "indicated meaning"? I am a bit reluctant to it because of possible confusion with figurative meaning (abhidh? vs. lak?a??), which I don't think is intended.

Best wishes,
Aleksandar

Dear Matthew and Aleksandar,



Matthew, you say: ?Once more, S?C, and nothing to do with thread, ??  But we should remember that s?c- is also (indeed, most literally) connected with piercing (with a needle) and sewing.  S?c?/s?caka = needle, s?cita = pierced, s?cika = tailor, s?cit? = needlework.



So a double-entendre is involved here: the s?tras have ?indicated meanings? but also ?stitched meanings,? and so, paradoxically, the nirukti deriving it from s?c- is still an indication of a basic meaning of ?thread?.



Best,
Tim

Dear Matthew,



Thank you for sharing this. The same idea appears as part of the definition found in V?caspati?s Bh?mat? on BSBh 1.1.1 (and I imagine elsewhere) ?



yath?hu?

lagh?ni s?cit?rth?ni svalp?k?arapad?ni ca |

sarvata? s?rabh?t?ni s?tr??y ?hur man??i?a? ||



I have been thinking for a while about the best way to render this s?tr??i ? s?cit?rth?ni in English and am currently leaning towards ?s?tras are statements that index their meaning.? I wanted to avoid ?indication? because of possible confusion with figurative meaning, but perhaps that is too cautious? What would you (the forum) suggest?



Best wishes,

Aleksandar

Dear friends,



Without wishing to prolong too much what has already been a very long (though highly informative!) thread (so to speak), I thought that this might be of some interest:

In the early 9th century Tibetan work, the ?Two-Volume Lexicon? (sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa), which was compiled by a team of Tibetan translators working under the guidance of a group of monastic scholars from Apar?ntaka (Kashmir/Gandh?ra/Bactria) and provides nirukta-style explanations of several hundred key terms in Sanskrit with Tibetan commentary, s?tra is glossed arthas?can?d s?tra [read, of course, arthas?can?t s?tram].

Once more, S?C, and nothing to do with thread, was prominent in the Buddhist understanding of the term.

Dear all,



Thanks to all of you who contributed to this robust and quite informative ?thread? (s?tra!) on the proper derivation of the Buddhist term sutta from the Sanskrit. I tossed a pebble in the pond, I thought, which made

ripples beyond expectations. A thorough treatment of the issue that leaves open, perhaps, a fillip of sorts (this said without having yet read Nathan McGovern?s article.) Of course, the philological question rather quickly

leads to deeper issues regarding the conceptualization of types of text among traditions. I hadn?t even considered Jain notions of sutta/s?tra, comments on which emerged along the way.



Best wishes,



Jim Ryan
