[INDOLOGY] list of Sanskrit book collection
Glad to hear that there is some interest in the books.
I'm attaching pdf's of the nine lists.
Please contact me off-list if you know of an institution that would be
willing to accept the books under the two conditions that they be kept
together, and that there be some sort of commemoration of the donor's
husband.
Best wishes,
Tim Cahill
