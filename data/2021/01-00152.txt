Yes, thank you, Patricia, - it has been widely.
To the list more generally -
There is one question it raises for me, not about Weingast's fantasies, but about K. R. Norman's
translation cited herein. In the first verse quoted, he renders yogakkhema (= Skt. yogak?ema) as "rest-from-exertion". Charles Hallisey, in his recent translation of the same work https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674427730
gives "safety," which seems more plausible to me in light of the Sanskrit usage.
I would be grateful for any insights you might have into Norman's treatment of the term and, more generally, into the semantic range of the curious expression yogak?ema. Tibetan lexicographers, by the way, treated it as having the meanings "accomplished" (grub-pa = siddha) and "comfort/ease/happiness" (bde-ba = sukha).
best to all,
Matthew
