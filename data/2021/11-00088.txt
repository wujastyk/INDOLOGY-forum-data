[INDOLOGY] Hindus and Buddhists in Central Asia
I've been working on the Indo-Europeans and some of their interactions.
It started with the discovery that Vikings penetrated into Central Asia. Their hoards in Scandinavia contain silver coins from Afghanistan. While they might not have gone all the way there, it seems certain that they did penetrate well into Central Asia -- probably at least as far as the Caspian Sea.
That led me to the second question which I asked here. Thanks again for all of the fascinating answers in another thread here that discussed Indo-Aryan influences as far as the Philippines and beyond.
Now I'm looking back in the other direction again and wondering if anyone can provide more sources on evidence for Hindus and Buddhists in Central Asia. The Buddhists are better attested and there were probably more of them, but I was wondering what evidence we have for both groups in Central Asia.
Best,
Dean
