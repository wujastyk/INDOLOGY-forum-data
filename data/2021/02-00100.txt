[INDOLOGY] Re: vimeo.com/channels/vedicritual: updated channel description
Dear Jan,
Thank you so much for your resources and for referencing my own work on
your channel. I hope that some colleagues will find it useful.
Unfortunately, towards the end of my fieldwork, I lost many hours of
recordings of Vedic rituals and recitation styles when my computer broke
down and I could only rescue a few things from the damaged hard drive.
Luckily today there are many resources available online and otherwise than
a few decades ago. Just today I was listening to Day 92 of 200 *Sampoorna
Rigveda Ghanaparayanam by Kanchi mutt's Pazhur & Truvanaikovil Pathashala*
students on Facebook. The recordings are also available on YouTube:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-5NdQ7kG-gXeRRdCZGwyyg/videos in case
someone is interested in listening to this very difficult recitation style.
I gave up collecting in a systematic manner all the material on Vedic
recitation and Vedic ritual found on the internet today, but it would be a
project worth pursuing.
In any case, thank you so much, Jan, for sharing also my material with the
rest of the list.
Best wishes,
Borayin
