Dear Jan,

     I was only 9 years old in 1955, but my parents did go and see parts of
this event. This was in part because the late Professor Vidyadhar Bhide was
a classmate of my father and Vidyadhar Bhide's father was a living
Agnihotri who, from what I heard, had participated in this sacrifice.  I
remember visiting the Bhide home and seeing the Homakunda there. Also,
right behind the grounds of the S.P. College, there was a M?m??s?
P??ha??l?, and the people there may have participated in this performance.
Besides the few Vedap??ha??l?s, Pune also had the Veda??strottejak Sabha
established something around 1870s and this was still functional during my
student days.  I appeared for one of their examinations held in the
Anandashrama.
