Hi Adriano, and all,
It seems that the Velthuis orthography has been incorporated into the Serif versions of the all-purpose ?GNU Free Font? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_FreeFont <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_FreeFont>), with more info available here (https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/ <https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/>), and downloadable from here: http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/ <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/> 
I downloaded and tested the file  freefont-otf-20120503.tar.gz <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/freefont/freefont-otf-20120503.tar.gz>, and it seems to show up OK on my Mac, though many ligatures are missing (e.g., Xr series, where X stands for any consonant), so, not really satisfactory. maybe there are others out there? 
On the CTAN archives, you can get the whole devanagari TeX/LaTeX package, which  includes all the Type 1 fonts used in the typesetting. https://ctan.org/pkg/devanagari <https://ctan.org/pkg/devanagari> Maybe it can be figured out how to upgrade these fonts to the OpenType standard, if you are looking to use them outside of the TeX environment. 
For XeTeX, you can see Daniel Stender?s input maps here: https://ctan.org/pkg/xetex-devanagari <https://ctan.org/pkg/xetex-devanagari> (which can be used to process IAST as well as KH transliteration in addition to Velthuis?s scheme) 
There is also an excellent manual by Anshuman Pandey for using the package in TeX/LaTeX from 2019 here:  http://ctan.math.illinois.edu/language/devanagari/velthuis/doc/manual.pdf <http://ctan.math.illinois.edu/language/devanagari/velthuis/doc/manual.pdf>
all best wishes,
