Dear list members,

The Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t, M?nchen, is pleased to announce a call for
papers for the workshop "*Buddhism and Language - A Twofold Perspective:
The Role of Language in Buddhist Teachings and the Role of Buddhist Sources
in Linguistic Research*", to be held on October 22-23, 2021 in Munich,
Germany, with keynote addresses by *Prof. Dr. Christoph Anderl* (Ghent
University) and *Prof. Dr. Steffen D?ll* (Hamburg University).

Due to the dynamic situation of the pandemic, the workshop will probably be
held in hybrid format (in presence *and* online) . We encourage abstract
submission from early career scholars, especially PhD students, but also
from established scholars.
The deadline for applications is March 20, 2021.
