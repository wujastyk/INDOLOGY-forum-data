[INDOLOGY] Through a Glass Darkly...
Dear list members,
I'd be very grateful if someone can share with me a soft copy of Hans
Henrich Hock's chapter "Through a Glass Darkly: Modern 'Racial'
Interpretations vs Textual and General Prehistoric Evidence on *?rya *and
*d?sa*/*dasyu *in Vedic Society" from the 1999 Bronkhorst & Deshpande
volume *Aryan and Non-Aryan in South Asia.*
Many thanks!
Robert
