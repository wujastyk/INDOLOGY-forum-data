Dear Prof. Pandurangi,
Regarding comprehensive study material for the ?gveda, and in particular
your question as to whether a ?gveda reverse word index had been prepared
by anyone: I do not know of a reverse word index. You no doubt already use
the complete ?gveda word index prepared by Vishva Bandhu and his team.
Besides this, there is another helpful study tool, *A ?gvedic Word
Concordance*, by Alexander Lubotsky, 2 volumes, 1997. It lists every word
found in the ?gveda, followed by the number of its occurrences there, and
then it gives every p?da in which the word occurs. So you can easily see
the usage of each word throughout the whole ?gveda in one convenient place.
Of course, you often have to go to the whole verse, or even the whole s?kta,
to get the context. But it provides a good start. I do not know if it is
available online.
Best regards,
David Reigle
