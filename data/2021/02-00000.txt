Dear Friends,

If anyone is able to help me I'd appreciate it. I'm trying to find a copy
of this book by A.L. Dallapiccola:

*South Indian Paintings: a catalogue of the British Museum Collection*,
London 2010
<https://www.worldcat.org/title/south-indian-paintings-a-catalogue-of-the-british-museum-collection/oclc/758465858&referer=brief_results>

I am specifically interested in the comments of acrobats performing on a
perilous structure said to be located on p. 182.

The closest copy to me is in Tokyo, at the Diet's library, which is a
journey unable to be made at this time. It's not urgent. More a curiosity.
Nonetheless, it is part of an ongoing project. If you do happen to find
yourself serendipitously staring at it in the book shelf of your local
library, I would appreciate a scan/clear photograph of the relevant image
and description

Thank you.


All the best,
