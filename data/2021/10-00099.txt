Overview

??kuntala? (Sanskrit translation: ?of ?akuntal??) is an upcoming 2021 Indian Sanskrit language historical film directed by Dushyanth Sridhar, a renowned speaker, writer and researcher on Indian scriptures. The film has been produced by Dushyanth Sridhar and Srinivas Kannaa under Desika Daya Productions. The film is an aesthetic adaptation of Abhij??na ??kuntala? from K?lid?sa's work.

Set in an era pre-dating the Mah?bh?rata, the film tells the story of ?akuntal?, the daughter of Sage Vi?w?mitra and the damsel Menak?, and her love for King Du?yanta. Du?yanta, the King of Hastin?pura of that time, belonged to the Chandravamsa and the Puru Dynasty. After a marriage which results in ?akuntal?becoming pregnant, the King goes back to his capital promising to come back for her, but does not. Later, when ?akuntal? goes to his palace to claim her love, he has forgotten her, much to her shock and disappointment.

The film stars Payal Shetty (debut) and Shubham Sahrawat (debut) in lead roles with Y.Gee Mahendran, Mohanraman, ?TV? Varadarajan and Sivakumar playing important characters. Rajkumar Bharati, great grandson of Subramania Bharathi, has composed the music, and Sai Shravanam, who was the Sound Recordist for Academy award winning Life of Pi, is the music producer for the film. Audiography is by A.S.Lakshminarayan, a two-time National Award winner. Editing is by B.Lenin, a five-time National Award winner. Make-up is by Pattanam Rasheed, another National Award winner. Costumes were designed by Lakshmi Srinath. Filming for the movie began in June 2021 at Maara Studios, Chennai.
