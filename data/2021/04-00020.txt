our field but has been published somewhat outside the general Indological
radar:

Lake in Kashmir, India. New York / Oxford: Berghahn 2021. 362 pp., 110
ill., 6 col. ill., bibliog., index.

eISBN 978-1-80073-030-4 eBook
In the Himalayas of the Indian part of Kashmir three communities depend on
the ecology of the Dal lake: market gardeners, houseboat owners and
fishers.  Floating Economies describes for the first time the complex
intermeshing economy, social structure and ecology of the area against the
background of history and the present volatile socio-political situation.
Using a holistic and multidisciplinary approach, the author deals with the
socioeconomic strategies of the communities whose livelihoods are embedded
here and analyses the ecological condition of the Dal, and the reasons for
its progressive degradation.
