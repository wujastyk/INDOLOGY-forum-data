Yes, it is the verbs which are important here. ??????? and  ?????? are what
are being compared.

???? , ?????? is Kundalinee saadhanaa related term . There is a ???? ,
??????  of each chakra. This is a process of revealing/unfolding each of
these entities/aspects that are already existing but closed to one's own
experience, to one's own experience. The procedures for  ???? , ?????? of
each chakra are to be executed under the Guru's guidance.

Hatha here refers to (the courage/perseverance for ) overcoming the
hesitation/fear or fearlike state experienced during the moment of  ???? ,
??????.

There is a skill and insistence involved in turning the key through the
levers inside the lock, while groping for the levers and waiting for the
moment of the notches of the key fitting the levers and turning immediately
once that matching/fitting is felt with the optimum amount of force and
skill.
