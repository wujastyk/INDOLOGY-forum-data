[INDOLOGY] Re: -t/-d
Dear Mark,
     This divergence goes back to the ?aunak?ya-Catur?dhy?yika [rule
1.1.10] which reads: *pratham?nt?ni tr?t?y?nt?n?ti ?aunakasya pratij??na? n*
a* vr?tti?*, "It is a precept of ?aunaka that the words [*padas*] ending in
the first members of the stop-series, i.e. voiceless unaspirated stops,
should rather end in the third members, i.e. voiced unaspirated stops. Such
however, is not the recitational practice." [HOS 52]. So, should a pada end
as *tat *or *tad* seems to have been a very long debate. The practice of
the ?aunak?ya-Atharvaveda Padap??ha, as noted in the Atharva-Pr?ti??khya
reads: *tat iti tak?r?nta? ?aunake*.  This is also the case in the
manuscripts of the Padap??ha and Ja??p??ha that I used for my edition in
the *Recitational Permutations of the ?aunak?ya Atharvaveda *[HOS 61].
Such is also the practice of the RV Padap??ha. But as the rule in the
?aunak?ya-Catur?dhy?yik? shows, there was a dispute among different
scholars about this.
