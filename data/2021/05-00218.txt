Dear Paolo,
Chunghui Tsui put together a map for Northern Liang stupas, you might
find it helpful. See fig. 40, p. 97:
Tsui, Chung-hui ??? (2020) Chinese Calligraphy and Early Buddhist
Manuscripts. Oxford: Indica et Buddhica.

Dear Indologists,
Maybe someone can help me. I need a few maps of Silk Roads and Eastern
and Western Central Asia Buddhist centres. Do you know any website
where I can find good quality maps or can you submit any scan of 2-3
maps of this geographical area?
Best wishes,
Paolo
