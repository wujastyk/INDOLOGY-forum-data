Dear Palaniappan,
Harivamsha chapters 106--113 (critical edition) narrates the story of Krishna's family's conflict with Bana. At the end of chapter 112 Bana, his extra arms having been severed by Krishna's discus, dances at Nandin's instigation in order to receive successive boons from Shiva. The critical apparatus is particularly rich in these chapters, so it is worth looking to see whether any more dancing is mentioned there.
All the best, from Simon Brodbeck.

Dear Indologists,
In the Cilappatik?ram, the Tamil epic often dated ca. 5th century CE, the courtesan M?tavi performs 11 dances possibly based on puranic themes. Of these 11, four deal with dances performed by K???a, Vi??u, Indr??i, and Manmatha as part of their conflict with B???sura. I would appreciate any references to the story of B??a in Sanskrit sources. Do these Sanskrit sources mention any such dances?   Also, how does the Sanskrit tradition explain the kingship of B??a in light of V?mana sending Bali to the netherworld?
Thank you in advance.
Regards,
Palaniappan
