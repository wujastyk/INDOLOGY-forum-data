[INDOLOGY] Comparison of Brahmins (and their cultural context)
 with Nazis (and their cultural context)? both inappropriate and inapt

Tak.
A few questions, perhaps simplistic, but nevertheless necessary.
Did something described as "Indian civilization" actually exist (Caley:  <I
am not sure if we should continue to call it "Vedic civilization" at that
point.>).
If so - then when, where, in what forms?
Did farmers, craftsmen, merchants fully participate in it?
Were the religious messages preserved in the Vedic texts accessible to them
linguistically - and conceptually?
Were early urban organisms administered by reference to Vedic legal
formulas, including, but not limited to, the cleaning up of urban spaces of
refuse, of animal and human excrement? Including taxation?
I would like to know where in the Vedic tradition I could find these kinds
of formulas. I see them in the Buddhist tradition, clearly - but in the
Vedic tradition?
Best,
Artur
