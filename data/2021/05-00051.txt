Dear Rajam,
as to o?i, "snapped", I think you are right. In the picture supplied by Jean-Luc the leaf has been divided into sections. DED sub o?i mentions, for Malay?l?am, "division or range of ricefields".
Jean-Luc, as to your question if I am reviewing the publication you mention, I am not. I stick to classical Tamil literature,
With kind regards, Herman

Dear Herman,
Dear VSR,
dear Srilata,
dear all,
being on multiple mailing list is frequently quite nice.
I finally understood just now what Herman's question was all about by
seeing this picture and its caption
(I do not know whether the .png picture will make it to the list but it
is reachable via the links)

I had never seen the use of green palm-leaf
I wonder whether the botanical species of palm leaf used here (as
measurement tool) is the same as that of the palm leaf used for writing?
Herman, are you writing  review of this 2007 book?
Best wishes to all
