[INDOLOGY] Re. Chaos in Indian mythology and philosophy
Dear Dimitry, 
I can?t imagine this is the chaos you?re looking for, but for what it?s worth, the anti-M?dhva polemics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries frequently accuse M?dhvas of engaging in a kind of exegetical chaos, evident in various phrases like ?vedavipl?vana,? ?m?m?m?s?vy?karan??dim?ry?dollan?ghanam,? and ?vedaved?n?g?di?u ucchr?n?khalam valgyate.?
