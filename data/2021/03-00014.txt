Dear Herman,

in Pi?kalam 3133, we obtain some (incomplete) information concerning the 
polysemy of ?mpal.

??????? ??????? ????? ????????
????????? ?????? ????? ??????.

icaiyi? ku?alu? ka??u m??kilu
malliyum y??aiyu m?mpa l?kum.

Modern editors extract these items,
as representing 5 meanings of ?mpal

icaiyi? ku?al --> icaikku?al
ka?
m??kil
alli
y??ai

The need for the specifier icai in icaiyi? ku?al (replaced by icaikku?al 
in the modern gloss) comes from the fact that ku?al itself is polysemic, 
as explained by Pi?kalam 3407

??????? ????? ???????? ?????????
?????????? ???????? ??????? ??????.

irup?? mayiru micaiyi? karuviyun
to?aiyu?aip poru?u? ku?ale? ??kum.

Modern editors extract these items,
as representing 4 meanings of ku?al

irup?? mayir --> ?? mayir & pe? mayir
icaiyi? karuvi --> icaik karuvi
to?aiyu?aip poru?


On the basis of this, I would understand that Pi?kalam 3133 (if 
completed by Pi?kalam 3407) enumerates 5 meanings for ?mpal
-- musical instrument
-- toddy (if MTL interpretes Pi?. correctly)
-- bamboo
-- Water-lily, nymphaea lotus; (if MTL interpretes Pi?. correctly)
-- elephant

That leaves out 6 of the meanings given by the MTL (on p. 233)

?????? ?mpal , n. 1. [K. ?bal, M. Tu. ?mbal.] Water-lily, nymphaea lotus; 
?????. (????.) 2. Musical pipe. See ???????????. ??????? ???? ????? ???????? ?????? 
(??????????. 222). 3. A melody-type played on a pipe; ??????. (????. 1314.) 
4. Bamboo; ????????. (????.) 5. Blow-horn; ?????????. (????.) 6. Elephant; 
????. ????????? ??????? (?????. ???????????). 7. Toddy; ???. (????.) 8. A very 
high number; ??? ?? ????. (????. ?????. 393.) 9. Affliction; ???????. (????.) 
10. Arrangement, order; ?????. (????.) 11. Moon; ????????. (??. ??.)

As for the 2nd meaning in MTL, namely "Musical pipe",
another MTL entry gives more details

??????????? ?mpa?-ku?al , n. < ?????? +. Musical pipe of bell-metal with a 
handle in the shape of a water-lily; ??????????? ????? ?????????????? 
????????????. (?????. 17, ??????, 2, ???.)

The meanings left out are

3. a melody-type played on a pipe
5.
8. A very high number;
9.
10.
11.

In Pi?kalam 3024, THREE synonyms are given for kumutam.

They are:
-- ?mpal
-- neytal
-- alli

kumutam is mentionned in the Pi?kalam section on Big numbers,
and more precisely it appears in Pi?kalam 1655 & 1656

Regarding meaning 3.
in his 2010 Tami?icaip P?rakar?ti,
N?. Mammatu has written that
the melody-type which is intended is
a pentatonic pa? also called cutta ta?y?ci

Therefore,
maybe your interpretation
? (floods) which make a loud noise (?mpal) produced by waterfalls 
([v]aruvi) ?
  can be slightly modified
and become

"the pentatonic melody produced by the cascade which has been tuned in 
?uddhadhany?si"


According to Walther Kaufmann 1976, page 311,

The ascending sequence is: Do, Mi b?mol, Fa, Sol, Si b?mol, Sol, Do
The descending sequence is: Do, Si b?mol, Sol, Fa, Mi b?mol, Do


In Paris, near the Porte de la Villette, inside a park, there is a 
spherical cinema theater called La G?ode

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_G?ode

If you walk near it at night, you can probably still hear a (random) 
music of a similar nature. I have not verified whether it is pentatonic 
but it is partly linked with the sound of water

Of course one can also visit more than one sphere and listen to big 
numbers in that manner and perceive "La musique des sph?res"
:-)

with my best wishes
