Dear Santosh,

nice to see that you are working on? ?????????? ??????!

I do have a copy of the "Pa?cakro?a Sudh?" and did quickly check my 
notes. The printed text gives "iti vidy?ra?yat?rthak?t? 
pa?cakro?asudh? (Pa?cakro?a Sudh?: 111). Both the
publisher of the Pa?cakro?a Sudh? as well as Up?dhy?ya (1994: 800), 
however, give K???
hajihva Sv?m? as the author of the text, although 
Vidy?ra?yat?rtha is given as name of his d?k??guru (Up?dhy?ya 1994: 793).

In case the "Pa?cakro?a Sudh?" is of interest, I could try to get it 
scanned.

Best

Joerg
