[INDOLOGY] Question about the Indian grammatical tradition's
 impact on Western philology and linguistics
 <409D9471-406D-4C16-9571-CEEA431D2FCE@unil.ch>
Hi Brendan,
Halbfass's India and Europe may be worth looking at. I'm sorry that I don't have my copy in my present location to verify whether or not this is really a good lead, but it's definitely something I would want to check in this context.
best,
Matthew

Dear Brendan,
I published a paper that touches upon the topic: ?La linguistique indienne: perspectives europ?ennes et indiennes.? Cahiers de l'ILSL 52 (Historiographie et ?pist?mologie des sciences du langage: du pass? vers le pr?sent; ed. Ekaterina Velmezova), 2017, 27-63.

I hope your student will find something of interest in it.
Best wishes,
Johannes

Dear colleagues and friends,
I have an undergraduate student interested in getting a better
understanding on the impact of the Indian grammatical tradition on 19th
century philology and early 20th century linguistics. I would be
grateful to receive some suggestions of books and article he, and I for
that matter, might read.
Best wishes,
Brendan
