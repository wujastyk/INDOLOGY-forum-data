Dear colleagues,
I think that Dominik and Andrew have effectively made the case that this
insider/outsider distinction does no useful analytical work in our
disciplines; I furthermore realize that few if any will be persuaded by
polemics on this thread.
Nevertheless, this insider/outsider rhetoric not only vitiates the
productive atmosphere of collegial exchange that should characterize our
profession (and that has thankfully characterized the Indology list in the
past); it prevents us from doing rigorous historical as well as
philological work, including into histories of racism in our fields. As
such, the sooner we put it to rest the better.
One colleague has opined:  "Human products of culture having a
culture-insider's perspective and culture outsider's perspective is an
established professional understanding in the contemporary studies of
culture world over. " This is patently false. Current understandings among
anthropologists and cultural theorists, not to mention historians,
consistently challenge this crude binary, arguing that in fact the notions
of 'insider' and 'outsider' are constantly being made and remade through
processes that are distinctly contingent, historical, and political. These
scholars also point out that appeals to notions of 'insider' and 'outsider'
necessarily mask internal heterogeneity, most often in the interest of
consolidating the hegemony of those that seek to represent a supposedly
'authentic' 'insider' perspective.
Consequently, such vulgar interpretations of the serious work of
anti-colonial scholars like Said and Fanon only serve to carve out a domain
of dubious authority for an imagined insider?and those pushing this idea
these days invariably cast themselves as such an insider: a convenient
assignment of authority to oneself. As Andrew pointed out, we are only too
familiar with how this has been pursued over the past several years:
individuals and organizations conferring on themselves the authority to
decide which Indologist or scholar is an insider and which is an outsider.
Apologies for the prolixity but having seen the intellectual damage that
this crude binary does in our fields, I truly hope we can put it to rest
and move on. As always, I am happy to point interested colleagues to
relevant sources in anthropology, history, critical race theory, etcetera.
Regards,
Tyler Williams
