Dear Caley (but also Aleksandar and Madhav),

The problem posed by the markedly non-pithy discursive Pali "suttas" is 
actually a pseudo-problem. Properly speaking, the Pali discourses are 
called suttantas (sUtrAnta), and only sutta for short, which implies 
that they elaborate upon or complete in some way something different, 
called suttas. The word sutta by itself is used within Pali discourses 
in particular cases, most notably in various lists of angas, which have 
been discussed by Lamotte, von Hinueber, and others. These angas 
probably referred to "genres" so to speak of early Buddhist literature. 
Sometimes scholars have assumed that the sutta-anga just refers to the 
suttantas, ie, the discourses as they come down to us, but this is 
almost certainly incorrect. I argue in the JIABS paper that I already 
cited that the word sutta referred to the pithy formulations of dhamma 
that served as oral formulas for use in performing the larger discursive 
suttantas.

Best,

Nathan
