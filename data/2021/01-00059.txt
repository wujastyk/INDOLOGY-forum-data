a?gula or finger-width measurement is specific to the individual. My finger
widths differ from yours or my wife's, etc., but when I measure distances
on my body using my finger widths, those will match the same distances on
my wife's body using her finger widths. I've tested this quite a few times
and was a bit astonished to find it consistently true. Others may differ
(I'm very interested to hear if that's so), but the idea as I understand it
is that an a?gula is personal measurement, not a standardized measurement
like a metre/meter, cm, mm, inch, etc. In this sense there is no
uncertainty involved, just inter-individual variation.
No doubt there's more to this topic, but this is my bit I can comment on.
Cheers
James
