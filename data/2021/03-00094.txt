[INDOLOGY] Re: Searching the Indology List Archive
Dear Sudalaimuthu,
Like you I find the Indology list archives invaluable and I ran into
problems.
There was a bug in the browse by month feature (it only displayed the first
25 entries correctly  ) but that seems to be fixed now, so I'm OK with the
new archives browse feature now that I'm used to it.
I prefer the new archives "search" function.  I found with the original
archives "search" function, the same post was displayed multiple times. But
I would have liked something like the google groups search function, where
you can filter searchs by poster, date, contents or if it has an attachment.
