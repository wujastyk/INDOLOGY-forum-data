Patrick:
Very interesting, thanks. Do you think in the 'objective'-use instances of
the terms the tradition somehow developed an 'average' version of the
personal measurements?
I've worked mostly on yogic-tradition related texts, where the term a?gula
was used mostly for personal body measurements (length of arm, elbow to
wrist, distance between cakras, etc).
