[INDOLOGY] Central Asia/Silk Roads Maps
Just in case you have not yet thought of this resource: There are 
several results for "silk road map" on wikimedia commons: 
https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=silk+road+map&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image 
These images have the advantage of a license that allows re-use. Some of 
them are svg files and especially handy for scaling and further editing.
Best wishes,
Vitus
