Dear Professor Tieken,

Hope you?re doing well in this difficult CORONA Times. We are managing things ok in California. God bless the world. 

Professor Tieken, no offense meant but I wonder why you have taken my wording ??? ?????? ???????????? (?r ayalakattami??yv?l?ar) as pointing to you!! It could refer to Dr. S. Palaniappan or anyone else!  

I guess there?s a problem in translating my phrase ??? ?????? ????????????. 

Here, you have translated ??? as ?some,? while I meant ?one.? As you well know, ??? can be translated as ?a/one/specific.?  It is not derogative at all. ?????? ???????????? could refer to anyone such as myself, George Hart, Palaniappan, Jean-Luc Chevillard, and some other friends of mine who are very much interested in Tamil and ask me questions now and then.  We all live in foreign countries, so we all are ?????? ????????????. 

Anyway, as I said, no offense please. 

In any case, I wish to respond to your query about "this type of compound." I?ll reply soon. 

Meantime, peace. 

Thanks and regards,
rajam

I do take this opportunity to add that I am glad that I am also a sanskritist: Sanskrit does not have speakers. This is true in the sense that one is not born a Sanskrit speaker, or a "son of Mother Sanskrit", to vary on Tamiltt?y.
