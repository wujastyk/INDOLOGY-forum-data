Dear colleagues,
I am curious if any work has been done on the attribution of the
Govind???aka to ?a?kara. Gussner's 1976 JAOS article ("A Stylometric
Study...") rejects the attribution to ?a?kara of most of the stotras
considered therein, but the Govind???aka is not included in the study.
Amarnath Ray, in 1935 in BSOAS, states that J?va Gosv?min had made this
attribution, but does not cite a source, and my cursory attempt to find
this in some of J?va's main works has proven futile. Any suggestions are
welcome.
Thanks,
Dave
