Dear List members,
a colleague of the South-East Asian department asked me for information about Kalki's epic novel Po??iyi? Celva?, or, apart from an English translation, if there exists an analysis or synopsis of the epic in English or any other West-european language. Unfortunately, I cannot help him ? I do not know much about modern Tamil literature.  I hope someone on the list knows more about Kalki?s epic novel.
With kind regards, Herman?
