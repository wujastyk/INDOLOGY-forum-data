Dear Ananya,
Thanks for these useful references to the research of John D. Kelly!
The spread of "Sanatan Dharm" to Fiji is of course a much later, late 19th
century, phenomenon, parallel to what is seen on the other part of the
globe in South America, in formerly Dutch Surinam -- where, as on the Fiji
islands, Arya Samaj is relatively much stronger among those of Indian
background. Surinam has several languages including a beautiful local
creole, Sranang Tongo, and a specific form of Surinam Hindustani, Sarnami,
rooted in east-Indian Hindustani dialects that predate the formation of
modern Hindi. In the 20th+ centuries this Sarnami has been largely replaced
by "shuddh Hindi" through schooling etc. Incidentally, recruiters searching
for candidates in impoverished areas of British India to settle in faraway
Suriname (they got in fact a return ticket by boat valid for 5 years, but
many finally preferred to stay) said they would be going to the land of Sri
Ram...
Best,
