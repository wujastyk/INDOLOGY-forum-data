The Department of Religion at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, invites applications for a full-time assistant or associate professor in South Asian Religions to begin Fall 2022.

The successful candidate will have a proven record of research and teaching excellence and should be prepared to teach a variety of graduate and undergraduate courses in Hinduism and South Asian religions. We further desire a colleague who can contribute to interdisciplinary conversations and teaching in the Department of Religion and the Graduate Division of Religion, and who will inspire students to relate their study of premodern Hinduism to contemporary concerns.
