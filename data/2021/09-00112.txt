>From NGMCP manuscript 1-1337 reel no: B 39/5
A compilation of citations from works dealing with yoga on which the author
comments.

11) *Mu??am?l?tantram I*
This and the following text Mu??am?l?tantram II were transcribed from an
edition by Rasika Mohana Ca??op?dhy?ya published in Calcutta at the end of
the 19th century in Bengali script. These two texts are quite different
texts but largely coincide in their contents and concerns and belong to the
same period.

12) *Mu??am?l?tantram II*
Same comments as for Mu??am?l?tantram I.

Thank you,
Harry Spier
