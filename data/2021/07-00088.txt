Dear All,
I'm looking for a PDF of P.K. Mukhopadhay's The Ny?ya theory of linguistic
performance: A new interpretation of Tattvacint?ma?i (Publisher: Published
for Jadavpur University, Calcutta by K.P. Bagchi & Co, 1992).
Kindly let me know if you know where I could get a copy of it.
Thank you!
Sincerely,
Lee Ling
