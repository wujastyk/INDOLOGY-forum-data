Well, thank you, but  I feel horribly humiliated.
If someone criticized my  work, my methodology, if someone showed that I am
talking nonsense, I do not understand Sanskrit, whatever,  I would
understand why I am not with you - with you, people, born beyond
the western border of the Oder. I have written plenty of  papers, two books
on the Veda, ,the third is about to be published (my paper on conceptual
connections between the Veda and the Buddhism is one of the most cited,
positively),  trying to do that in English which is not my mother tongue in
order to submit myself to the critics, to discussions, moreover, I can see
that it makes sense what I do... and I could not do without cognitive
linguistics which is difficult and I devoted much time to learn it too.
Sorry, Dominik, I am too old not to talk about it. In two years I will be
sixty. Now I have nothing to lose.
But as I told you, I feel horribly humiliated. Do your duty and I will do
mine.
