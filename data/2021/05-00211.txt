[INDOLOGY] Padmanabh S. Jaini
Sad news indeed. The last I saw Professor Jaini was at Berkeley during the
celebration of his 95th birthday. When Jaini left Michigan for Berkeley in
1972, I was his replacement at Michigan. I did not know much about Michigan
before accepting the job offer. However, before coming to Michigan, I met
Professor Jaini at the Pune train station where he was between trains, and
he described to me the University of Michigan in some detail, making me
feel at ease. He was a great scholar with a wonderful sense of humor and
kindness. Will miss him.
