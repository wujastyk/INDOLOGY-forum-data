Hi Dean,
Archeological sites as far west as Anatolia record Buddhist settlements. See for instance Roxann Prazniak, ?Ilkhanid Buddhism: Traces of a Passage in Eurasian History,? Comparative Studies in Society and History, 2014;56(3):650?680.
It is well-known ? or I should say *used to be* well-known ? that during the Abbasid period, Buddhists from NW India and Central Asia were invited to Baghdad because of their skill as translators to participate in the Bayt al-?ikmah (House of Wisdom) translation projects of Greek and Indian texts. That barely lasted a generation, when a new ruler started to kill them off, purging them, having them flee back to Central Asia, then following them in a drive that purged Buddhism and Buddhists from much of Central Asia (Tibet was spared due to its relative inaccessibility and reputation as fierce warriors). I attempted a quick search for a website or two to include in this ? they were not hard to find a few years ago, but web information on that seems to have been purged and whitewashed as well ? I searched with three different search engines. More hits on Buddhists acting badly even for a search like ?baghdad buddhists? then even the tiniest morsel of information on the tragedy of the invited Buddhist communities to Baghdad, and the aftermath.
Our increasing reliance on the internet for basic information is becoming scary. We have entered 1984.
