Sorry for my delay with this, but, with caveats similar to those others
have offered, one could include:
Brown University (
https://www.brown.edu/academics/classics/academics/undergraduate-program)
Your degree would say "Classics" but the transcript would note the
Concentration track as Sanskrit (or South Asian Classics [less language
intensive], or Greek and Sanskrit, or Latin and Sanskrit).
With prerequisites, the Sanskrit track would normally require 6
semester-long Sanskrit language courses.
Best,
Dave
