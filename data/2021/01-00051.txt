[INDOLOGY] recommended software for diacritical marks in Romanized Sanskrit transliteration?
Namaste Dean,
If you are a linux user,
Ibus-m17n would work just fine with IAST diacritics for all programs.
If I have to convert some small patches to specific transliteration, I
write in Devanagari / SLP1 and get it converted at
https://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript . Hope this helps.
