*-?t seems to be the standard assumption, so for instance in the
declension tables in Meier-Br?gger?s Einf?hrung ? 311 and Sihler?s
Comparative Grammar ? 255 (variant *-?t), though then in his
discussion in ? 257 Sihler has ?*-t (? or *-d) preceded by a long
vowel.? He adduces Hittite instr. -at, abl. -az(a) < *-ati, and
does seem to consider Sabellian *-?d as secondary, namely from
?**-o-Vt.?

Macdonell, Kale and Whitney presumably just chose the Sanskrit
sandhi forms that corresponded to their understanding of the
Indo-European background of the nominative and ablative.

All best,
Stefan
