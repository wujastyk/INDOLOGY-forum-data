Dear McComas,

     The closest P??ini comes to the notion of a syllable is the term *ek?c* in
his grammar. This is the unit that contains a single vowel (*ac*). So for
example, in the verb form *dad?ti*, the units *da *and *d? *are *ek?c*.
The other context where he comes close is in defining the terms *laghu *and
*guru*. Strictly speaking, these terms only refer to vowels, rather than
syllables as we understand in modern linguistics. For P??ini, a short vowel
is *laghu* "light," but it becomes *guru *"heavy" if it is followed by a
consonant cluster (*sa?yoga*)*; *and all long vowels are *guru *"heavy" as
well.
     Discussions of syllables occur more extensively in works on metrics
and in the Pr?ti??khyas and ?ik??s. For the latter, you can consult
Siddheshwar Varma's book: *Critical Studies In The Phonetic Observations Of
Indian Grammarians* <https://books.google.com/books?id=MfuwbwAACAAJ>.
