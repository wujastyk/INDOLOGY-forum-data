[INDOLOGY] video Buddhacarita murals Sri Lanka
Dear listmembers,
for about two or three decades, starting at the end of the 19th century, 
it was very popular in Sri Lanka monasteries to visualize buddhist 
themes in a style which is reminiscent of theater performances.
I came across a monastery in Colombo where the complete Buddhacarita is 
depicted in this painting style and I decided now to make a video with 
(german accented) englisch eplanations.
