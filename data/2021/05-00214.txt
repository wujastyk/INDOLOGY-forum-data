A truly great person and scholar. I have so many great memories of talking
with him?his candor, learning, and generosity all three beyond measure?from
the beginning of my student days to sharing an office with him 2010-11. His
life story alone was an education. He aged in such a beautiful way too: he
was so generous and accommodating as to give even old age a good name
(k?udre 'pi n?na? ?ara?a? prapanne...). His memory and example will live
for eternity.
