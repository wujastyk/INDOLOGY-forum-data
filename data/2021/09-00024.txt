Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), an Institution of Eminence in
India, Manipal, is all set to launch Master?s in Sanskrit Studies from this
academic year onward. The launch of Master?s in Sanskrit Studies will be
set off by the inaugural address *?The Importance of a Multidisciplinary
Approach to Liberal Arts in India?* highlighting the case for Sanskrit in
current educational scenario delivered by Dr Bibek Debroy, Chair of the
Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), Govt of India,
New Delhi. Prof Debroy is a Sanskrit scholar and an Economist. He has
translated major literary classics from Sanskrit to English that run over
8000 pages.
The address will be a part of the orientation day for its master?s students
in European Studies, Indian Philosophy and Sanskrit Studies organised
jointly by the *Jean Monnet Centre for Excellence* ? Manipal Centre for
European Studies (MCES) and the Department of Philosophy (DoP) on Friday, 3
September 2021 at 3 pm with a special inaugural address via *Zoom ?
https://bit.ly/orientation3sep2021 <https://bit.ly/orientation3sep2021>*. We
extend a warm welcome to you for the launch of Sanskrit Studies this Friday
afternoon at Manipal. You may please find attached the invitation for the
same.
As a constituent of the Faculty of Liberal Arts, the *Department of
Philosophy (DoP) *conducts teaching and research activities in the areas of
Humanities and Social Sciences through academic programs, projects,
publications, and events. Apart from the upcoming *MA Sanskrit Studies*,
DoP offers its flagship program ? *MA Indian Philosophy* and other courses
in Humanities with a team of promising scholars - who are the beneficiaries
of prestigious Erasmus Plus and Raman Charpak research fellowships at
European universities. The Department is collaborating with the University
of Toronto, Canada on a project on Indian dialectics and argumentation
funded by Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute (SICI), New Delhi. It has also
developed the first searchable Digital Concordance ? MAHE Mahabharata with
three critical editions (http://mahabharata.manipal.edu/). The Department
has brought out several scholarly translations and publications and is
conducting interdisciplinary research in the areas of philosophy,
literature, digital humanities and computational linguistics.
The *MA Indian Philosophy *program involves critical and interdisciplinary
engagements with Indian discourses and introduces philosophising as a skill
set which students can incorporate in their approach (further
studies/research) to other academic fields, as an acquired life skill, and
as a professional competence necessary for diverse career pursuits. The
program has been designed to accommodate students from diverse academic
backgrounds and offer ample exposure to a variety of philosophical subjects
such as ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and linguistics. With a
structured curriculum that gradually proceeds from beginners to advanced
levels of study, it prepares the students to specialize in subjects which
best serve their intellectual growth.
The two-year *MA Sanskrit Studies *provides an opportunity to acquire
proficiency in Sanskrit language and study its linguistic underpinnings,
while also understanding Sanskrit as a broadly-deployed medium of
intellectual, literary, artistic, and religious expression in India. A
significant part of the course will include text-critical engagements with
different genres of Indian thought in Sanskrit ? literature, philosophy,
and hermeneutics. Simultaneously, emphasis will be placed on achieving an
understanding of the intellectual culture represented by Sanskrit and the
socio-cultural setting in which it flourished. This also incorporates an
attempt to trace and reconstruct the intellectual history of India and
develop a familiarity with the ongoing debates and topics in the study of
Sanskrit. The program aims at equipping students with the skills necessary
for interpreting and analysing Sanskrit texts of various styles and
genres - epic, poetry, commentary, and exploring the intertextual links
between discourses in pre-modern and modern literary traditions of India.
We sincerely hope that you would consider joining us for the launch and
participate in fostering Sanskrit ? philosophy, language and literature.
Thank you.
Regards,
Srini
