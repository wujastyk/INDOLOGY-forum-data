Subject: [INDOLOGY] looking for a pdf
Message-ID: <2e89d8797ea34d41bce60c2cd3120877@hum.leidenuniv.nl>

Dear List Members,

I am looking for a pdf of the following book:


S.N. Kandaswamy, Foreign Notices of Tamil Classics. An Appraisal. Tamil University, Tanjavur. 2010.


At the webpage of Exotic India I could have a look at a few pages of the book. The first two chapters are "appraisals" of, in this order, my book K?vya in South India, and Pollock's The Language of the Gods.


The author appears to know much about me. He writes that I "used to say before the Sanskrit students that Classical Tamil is superior to Sanskrit. Likewise when he (that is, I) met with Tamil students, he (I) was accustomed to extol Sanskrit Classics."


I don't know which students he had this information from: he situaties the Kern Institute at the University of London!


I am just curious what more he has to say about me. In the blurp provided by the bookseller a point is made that so far the author had not received a reaction from me.


With kind regards,

Herman
