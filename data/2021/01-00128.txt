[INDOLOGY] Question about Gandhari Prakrit
Thanks, Johannes and Herman.  Your responses are along the lines that I
suspected, but I wanted a more authoritative confirmation than my own
hunch.  I have suggested that P??ini survives in Pata?jali's ?ry?varta, but
his homeland is no longer within its limits.  Best wishes,
Madhav
