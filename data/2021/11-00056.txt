Dear colleagues?
As many of you know, over the summer the Pew Research Center published a groundbreaking report on religious life in India: ?Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation.? <https://www.pewforum.org/2021/06/29/religion-in-india-tolerance-and-segregation/> I was fortunate to have the chance to interview lead author Neha Sahgal about the report?s rich findings. Our conversation is the latest episode of Sensing the Sacred, my podcast on religion, politics, and society in South Asia:
