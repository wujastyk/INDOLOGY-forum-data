Dear Friends, ?????????, It seems I only have a very bad-quality pdf of the
KSS ed. of the Dhvany?loka in my collection. Would someone have a
high-quality pdf they could share?
If not I will get mine scanned by a pro and make it available. Thanks and
best to everyone, ??????,J

It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the
individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a
relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and
its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or
demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for
the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and
that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have
experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their
time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of
someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, *Playing and Reality*
