Subject: [INDOLOGY] List of FOASAS publishers and journals
Message-ID: <2670254d-0369-bfe7-feb9-049ceb2fbc16@univie.ac.at>

Dear colleagues,

we are pleased that the *Initiative for **Fair Open Access Publishing in 
South Asian Studies (FOASAS)* continues to find support, and we are 
working to ensure that our website remains a useful resource. For the 
past year, we have been maintaining *a list *of relevant FOA 
*publishers, journals, book series* and other publication media. Please 
have a look at it here:

https://foasas.org/index.html#journals 
<https://foasas.org/index.html#journals>

The list remains work in progress. Do you know of any other FOA 
publishers, journals etc. with an emphasis on Indological / South 
Asia-related research? Or do you have any other feedback or suggestions 
for the list?

If you are involved in one of the listed FOA platforms, we would like to 
thank you for your work and ask you to have a look at the respective 
entry (and to consider becoming a supporter, if you have not already 
done so)!


Best regards,
Vitus Angermeier
Dominik A. Haas
