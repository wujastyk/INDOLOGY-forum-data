Victor, Guy, Dan,

Thanks for your responses. I, of course, was looking for possible ?pseudo-etymologies? for the name ?P??ini,? thinking there may be one (or more) like there is for Pata?jali (the yogin). But, interestingly, conditioned by my teacher some years ago, Frances Wilson, I always go first to Apte?s dictionary. Frances disdained Monier-Williams because it gave the words in transliteration and not in Devan?gar?! Apte in this case was unhelpful. I usually, anyway, always look at Monier-Williams aside Apte for things, as both dictionaries contain items the other doesn?t. But, obviously, I didn?t do my back-up work in this case. 

Still wondering if there may be mythological stories about P??ini and, now, his family line. A double patronymic. Would this mean then, that his grandfather is P??in?

Victor, some of what you?ve posted I cant? decipher because I don?t know P?nini well enough, his ?code-words? for forms and categories. But part of it, seems to basically spell out what Guy and Dan were pointing out, it seems.

Jim
