I am very sorry to learn of Professor Jaini's passing.
Besides his remarkable learning, his unmatched mastery of the several fields of scholarship to which he profusely contributed,
we was a kind and generous mentor and friend, graced with good humor and great warmth.

He will be dearly missed.

Dear all,

Some colleagues in India brought to our attention that Padmanabh S. Jaini, one of the greatest scholars of Jainism (and Buddhism), and professor at Berkeley, has passed away at the age of 97.

In 1998, while teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, I befriended a scholar much older and far more learned than I. This was Padmanabh Jaini, a great authority on Buddhism and Jainism, with a profound knowledge of texts in half a dozen languages.
