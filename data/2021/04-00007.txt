[INDOLOGY] Article Request
Dear Colleagues,
My University library does not have the following article, which I would very much like to read. If anyone has a pdf of it, I would be very grateful, if they would share it with me.
Kalyanov, V. I., 'On Krsna's diplomatics in the Mah?bh?rata', Indologica Taurinensia, Vol. 7, 1979, 299?308. 
Best,
James Hegarty
