Dear Indologists,
I am looking for a PDF of the following article. 
Burton Stein (1978). "All the King's Mana: Perspectives on Kinship in Medieval South India." in Kingship and Authority in South Asia. J. F. Richards, ed. pp. 115-167.
The local university library does not have the volume.
Thank you in advance.
Regards,
Palaniappan
