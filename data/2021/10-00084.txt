Dear Indologists,

 

I am looking for a PDF of the following article. 

 

Burton Stein (1978). "All the King's Mana: Perspectives on Kinship in Medieval South India." in Kingship and Authority in South Asia. J. F. Richards, ed. pp. 115-167.

 

The local university library does not have the volume.

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
