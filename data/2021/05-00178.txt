Dr.Mallimson,I find "Kunchika" may be loosely translated as "Ripper" i.e a tool to rip open something.

[INDOLOGY] Help with a simile
  Dear colleagues,I wonder if anybody can help me understand a simile in a ha?hayoga text I?m editing, the Vivekam?rta??a. Verse 34 reads:udgh??ayet kap??a? tu yath? ku?cikay? ha?h?t |ku??aliny? tath? yog? mok?adv?ra? vibhedayet ||My incomplete translation is as follows: ?The yogi should use Ku??alin? to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a ku?cik? to force open a kap??a.? I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.All the best,Jim
