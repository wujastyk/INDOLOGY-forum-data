In person, John and Susan were warm and generous as well. For those unfamiliar with their archive of Buddhist art, please visit

A list of publications, some accessible online:

John will be greatly missed.

>> John was a supportive adviser and mentor, who nurtured many students in their pursuit of knowledge about Buddhist and Himalayan art during his tenure at Ohio State. His publications on Buddhist art spanned the vast and diverse regions of Asia, but focused primarily on South Asia and the Himalayas. The John C. and Susan L. Huntington Photographic Archive of Buddhist and Asian Art, originally at The Ohio State University and now at the University of Chicago, stands as a lasting legacy of John's scholarship and photographic documentation of art and architecture across Asia. John?s absence is already deeply felt.
