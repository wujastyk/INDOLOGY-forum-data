Dear colleagues,
two new publications just appeared in the Austrian Academy of Sciences 
Press that may be of interest to list members:
John Taber and Kei Kataoka: Meaning and Non-existence: Kum?rila's 
Refutation of Dign?ga's Theory of Exclusion. The Apohav?da Chapter of 
Kum?rila's ?lokav?rttika; Critical Edition and Annotated Translation. 
ISBN13: 978-3-7001-8641-0. EUR 39. 
https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/meaning-and-non-existence-kumrilas-refutation-of-digngas-theory-of-exclusion. 
In the Apohav?da chapter of his ?lokav?rttika, the seventh-century Hindu 
philosopher Kum?rila undertakes an exhaustive critique of the 
distinctive Buddhist theory of meaning, the ?theory of exclusion?, or 
Apohav?da. According to this theory, which was introduced by the 
sixth-century Buddhist thinker Dign?ga, a word refers not to some 
positive entity such as a universal, but to an ?exclusion?. It became 
one of the core teachings of the Buddhist epistemological tradition. The 
debate on it is illustrative of the Buddhist-Brahmin disputes that 
shaped the development of classical Indian philosophy. This translation 
of Kum?rila?s chapter, together with a critical edition, is accompanied 
by a running explanation based on the classical commentaries and 
extensive notes.

The correspondence of the linguist Anton Schiefner covers the years 1843 
to 1879 and deals with a great variety of subjects. The present volume 
offers an historical survey on the situation and development of 
Linguistics of that period, owing to the manifold activities and 
interests of the author (i.a. Classical Philology, Finno-Ugric 
languages, Slavic languages, Tibetan, Caucasian languages) and of his 
correspondents, scattered all over Europe, as well. The present volume 
is complemented by various illustrations and extensive indices.
