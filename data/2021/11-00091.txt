Dear List,
Would it happen that somebody has a scan to share of the 1910 partial English translation of the drama B?lar?m?ya?a of R?ja?ekhara:
A Literal Translation of the First Five Acts of Rajasekhara's Balaramayana. By S. Venkatarama Sastri, Bangalore, Irish Press, 1910.
The exemplar in the library of the University of Chicago https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/275192
has been scanned by Google, but it is only a snipped view which is available to me at
https://books.google.com/books?id=5EtIAQAAMAAJ<https://books.google.be/books?id=5EtIAQAAMAAJ>
(Cf. the exemplar of the British Library
https://discover.libraryhub.jisc.ac.uk/id/61008311 , which apparently corresponds to
https://books.google.com/books?id=zBrYMgEACAAJ without view)
Waiting for the EFEO/IFP planned critical edition with translation (see below), a copy of a more recent edition than the Benares 1869 one
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.362388/
https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092182252 etc.
Or the Calcutta 1884 one
https://archive.org/details/RamayanaPlay/Balaramayana%20of%20Rajashekara/
https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044025035593
etc.
would also be welcome (ex. Chaukhamba 1984, 1986 or 2011, Nag Publishers 1994)
Best wishes,
Christophe

Critical edition of Rajasekhara's Balaramayana (9th-10th centuries).
Director: H.N. Bhat; Collation of sources: V. Lalitha. A project concerning the critical edition of the play was initiated prior to 2004. The first ever critical edition of the Balaramayana, based on approximately thirty manuscripts from all over India, as well as on previously published non-critical editions, and on textual references in other works, will appear in the first volume. Work on the first six (out of ten) acts is complete. A second volume will include the first English translation of the play ever published (of which H.N. Bhat has completed an initial draft, indexes, and an introduction in which the play's literary fortune in India will be examined). This important work will be published in 2011.
