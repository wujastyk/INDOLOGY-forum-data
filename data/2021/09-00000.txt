Hi Stefan,

I have not been able to locate copies of these three articles from the
Gandhari bibliography. Do you perchance have copies of them? >>

B. N. Mukherjee 1990. ?Kharosh?? inscriptions from Chunar (U.P.).? *Monthly
Bulletin of the Asiatic Society* 19: 1?9.
B. N. Mukherjee 1990. ?A Kharo??h??Br?hm? seal?matrix from Oc-Eo.? *Monthly
Bulletin of the Asiatic Society* 19: 1?4.
B. N. Mukherjee 1990. ?A sealing in the Lopburi Museum (Thailand).? *Monthly
Bulletin of the Asiatic Society* 19: 1?2. \

Thanks. Hoping all is well there --

Rich
