[INDOLOGY] PDF Request - Mysore ORI Sanskrit Descriptive Catalogue vol. 13
Dear Scholars,
Does anybody have a soft copy of vol. 13 of the *Descriptive Catalogue of
the Sanskrit Manuscripts, Oriental Research Institute, Mysore*? It was
prepared under the directorship of H. P. Malledevaru in 1986 I believe, and
the particular volume is not included in the collections of most North
American libraries.
All the best,
Eric
