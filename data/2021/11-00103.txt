Dear List members, a colleague not on the list needs a pdf of the following article:

N. Sethuraman, ?The Later Pandyas (1371-1750)?, Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India, vol. 20, 1994 (pages not specified).

I hope someone on this list can help him. I used to have the journal myself, but gave all the issues I had to a Russian colleague when I had to move the books I had at the Kern Instituut to my house.

With kind regards, Herman
