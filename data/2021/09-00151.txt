Dear Antonia, Madhav, Michael and Alexander, Dear All,
Thank you for your responses, they are really very useful for me. It is
good to talk about all these problems.
Just to clarify my point a little bit more.
I am not trying to aim at any ideal which I am aware does not exist. Maybe
it is connected with my craziness about speech-exercises  and fascination
with how people can easily speak sounds which in other languages are found
difficult.
I have also noticed that exercises on vocal apparatus allow me to show my
students the role of speech in ancient India as if experientially: they can
observe the changes in their whole body when I ask them to sit up straight,
to start breathing deeper (diaphragmatic breathing is also an Upani?ad), to
focus on their head and neck (we everyday life we rarely do that), on what
happens when they open their mouths more or less, when they release the
muscles of the upper part of the body, when they force their tongue to move
differently than in Polish etc.
I do this while learning the basics of Sanskrit and reciting selected
passages. During recitation, my point is that they learn to speak the
following words fluently. It also helps a lot in understanding Sandhi, why
these and not other assimilations occur: because it's just easier to
pronounce. And slowly becomes obvious. They don't have to learn by heart
their rules, they can, to some extent of course, predict when it may occur.
I described this method as painstaking, because it is so compared to the
ultrasound image, but in fact,  we have a lot of fun during these classes.
And last but not least: when reading Vedic texts, I have the impression
that, for example, when it comes to creating space (e.g. in the morning),
it is also about creating space in the mouth, i.e. opening them during
morning recitation. I am more and more convinced  that not only the mental
processes, but also the processes of the organism taking place during the
recitation, were the conceptual framework derived from experience for
describing the processes of the world. This is also why I consider phonetic
exercises important in learning Sanskrit.
I called them "the art of yoking the tongue"  just because they need
conscious efforts, concentration and restraint. I am of course aware that
yoga was a later invention than the Vedic tradition.
Coming back again to retroflex consonants, I am really aware that we don't
know how they were pronounced in the Vedic times. But they are a
 linguistic phenomenon which is not found in Polish and I think that it is
good to try how to pronounce such a consonant, even if it comes out
differently from modern Indian languages (not to mention Vedic Sanskrit).
By the way, I found another website on phonetics (
https://seeingspeech.ac.uk/about-the-project/) with use of ultrasound
technology , and also some papers and a simple video film on Youtube
showing the differences between their pronunciation in various Indian
languages. But probably you know them all.
With best wishes,
Joanna
