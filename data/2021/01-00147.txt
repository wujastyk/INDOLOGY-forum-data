Subject: [INDOLOGY] Book recommendations? Folklore, British colonial era
Message-ID: <CAPAr6cHm66wiy8u6G3RbM-q5M_wDdix3akbcWhBhPWJdyUytyA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

A former student is looking for some book recommendations on books that
cover Indian Folklore, magic and mythical tales, and an accurate account of
life during the era of British colonialism. (Scholarly or non-scholarly
work is fine.)

Many thanks in advance
