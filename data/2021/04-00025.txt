SUMMARY: The present book contains a modern Sanskrit translation of 
eight chapters from the First Part of Cervantes?s monumental Don 
Quijote. At the suggestion of the American accountant and book 
collector Carl Tilden Keller (1872?1955) and with the mediation of the 
British explorer Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862?1943) from November 1935 
until August 1936 Pandit Nityanand Shastri (1874?1942) and Pandit 
Jagaddhar Zadoo (1890?1981) translated chapters I.2, I.3, I.8, I.10, 
I.16, I.17, I.18, and I.23 of Don Quijote. For this purpose the two 
Kashmiri scholars did not use the Spanish original, but rather the 
English translation by Charles Jarvis (c. 1675?1739) prepared in the 
first half of the eighteenth century and edited by the British Hispanist 
James Fitzmaurice-Kelly (1858?1923) in 1907 for the Oxford World?s 
Classics series. In this book both the Sanskrit translation and the 
corresponding parts of Jarvis?s English version are printed on facing 
pages. The Sanskrit text, typeset with a newly produced historical 
reconstruction of a Nagari typeface designed by the German critic, 
translator, poet, and Sanskritist August Wilhelm von Schlegel 
(1767?1845), has been edited on the basis of a unique manuscript 
which was written in Kashmir in the winter of 1936/37 and is now kept 
at the Houghton Library of Harvard University, USA. This publication 
includes an overview of the reception of Cervantes?s classic in India, as 
well as a detailed study of the fascinating history of the Sanskrit 
translation of Don Quijote and its still unedited partial rendering in 
Kashmiri. The printed book is accompanied by an audiobook containing 
the recording of the entire Sanskrit text read by Prof. Shrikant 
Bahulkar in Pune in 2017/18.

"???? ?????????? / Don Quixote" will appeal to specialists with interests in a 
variety of fields such as Sanskrit philology, modern Sanskrit studies, 
manuscriptology, history of Indology, Romance languages and 
literature, as well as translational and cultural studies.
