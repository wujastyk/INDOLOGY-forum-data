 Hi Steve,
I just realized you may be one of the best people to ask about this question I posted in Indology.
There used to be a great one in Yahoo groups but I don't know what happened to it.
Best,
Dean

 Dear Dean,
I don't know of any mailing lists (so would be interested to hear if there are any!), but the Facebook group 'Indo-European Linguistics' has excellent moderators that keep discussions on point and thoroughly well-informed.
Hope this helps,? ? ?Antonia
