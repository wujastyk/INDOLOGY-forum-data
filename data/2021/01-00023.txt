Dear Indology list member,
	The Sanskrit Library <https://www.sanskritlibrary.org/> is excited to announce two new courses beginning in mid-January:
The retelling of ???'s story in Sanskrit literature.
UG101.
The epic ?????? is one of the two most celebrated epics in Indian tradition. It was composed by ???????? and consists of 24,000 verses. However, ????????'s ?????? is not the only version of the story of ???. The story appears in several versions in Sanskrit as well as in the regional language of India. The story of ??? is told as episodes in the ??????? and in ?????s. There are also independent compositions that retell the story in Sanskrit. There are Jain and Buddhist versions of the ?????? in Prakrit and Pali too. The story of ??? spread not only throughout India but also across South-east Asia. Taking into consideration the vast number of retellings of the story of ???, we will study only the Sanskrit versions in this course. It is important to study the various narrations of the story of ??? with reference to the original Sanskrit texts rather than translations and secondary sources. Doing so will help us re-examine popular opinions about the story and reveal the complexity of the transmission of this story and texts in general in Sanskrit. This will also help us understand the importance of and need to undertake philological analysis of Sanskrit literature.
