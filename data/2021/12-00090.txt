[INDOLOGY] Rajasthani Sabadakosa launch, Dec. 29 2021
Dear colleagues,
The Chaupasani Shiksha Sansthan and Charans.org have been working over the
past two years to create an online, searchable version of Sitaram
Lala's *R?jasth?n?
?abadako?a* <http://www.rajsabadkosh.com/>, a valuable resource for those
studying late medieval and early modern works from the
Gujarat/Rajasthan/Malwa regions. The online dictionary will go live *tomorrow,
December 29th*, and these organizations would like to extend an invitation
to interested scholars to attend the launch event.
The launch will be streamed *live over Facebook, from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM
India Standard Time*. Please see the flier below for details regarding the
program, speakers, and how to attend.
Best,
Tyler Williams
