Dear listmembers,

for about two or three decades, starting at the end of the 19th century, it was very popular in Sri Lanka monasteries to visualize buddhist themes in a style which is reminiscent of theater performances.
I came across a monastery in Colombo where the complete Buddhacarita is depicted in this painting style and I decided now to make a video with (german accented) englisch eplanations.
