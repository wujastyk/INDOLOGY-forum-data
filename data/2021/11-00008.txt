Subject: [INDOLOGY] National Manuscript Mission data to be put in public
 domain
Message-ID: <CADSGPzVWys7WBEFigTPhyah=1cou+aiF2m-NV=DVNUL37KTBGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear scholars,

This information may be of interest to those of you who work with
manuscripts for their research. It is regarding access of manuscripts
digitized by National Mission for Manuscripts, Government of India.

I would like to bring it to the notice of this august gathering that my
second appeal in honourable Central Information Commission was decided on
30.10.2021. The order is attached herewith.

Honourable Information Commissioner Mr. Uday Mahurkar has decided this
matter with a well reasoned order.

The order directs NMM to do two things.
1. Put the digitized manuscripts (roughly 3 lacs) in public domain within a
period of 1 year
and
2. Allow me access of 30000 manuscripts for downloading the same within a
period of 1 month.

This order would surely pave the way for easier access of manuscripts
digitized by NMM to research scholars.

 I once again pay my respects to the honourable Information Commissioner
for enabling access to this centuries old manuscript treasure of India. I
also place my appreciation on record for NMM and manuscript repositories
without whose support the manuscripts would not have been digitized, and
their digital access would have been impossible.

Dr. Dhaval Patel
