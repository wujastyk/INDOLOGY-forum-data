Even a simple popular source such as Wikipedia covers this :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhu-vidya#Vedic_background
In the Rig Veda <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rig_Veda>, Soma
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(drink)>, the Vedic symbol for deep
spiritual truth, is addressed as *Madhu*, the nector or ambrosia, the drink
of Immortality sought by both gods and men. Rishi Vamadeva
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamadeva> has described how the saving of
the knowledge of *Madhu* or *Soma* Doctrine came to him through a hawk in a
sudden flash in his darkest hour.[4]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhu-vidya#cite_note-4>
It is believed that Rishi Dadhichi had his *ashrama* in Dudheshwara on the
banks of Sabarmati River <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabarmati_River> near
present-day Ahmedabad <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad>. His name
appears in the Rig Veda <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rig_Veda>.[5]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhu-vidya#cite_note-5> Dadhichi was a sage
of Vedic repute (Rig Veda I.84.13: ??????? ????? ????
????????????????????????| ???? ???????? ||). He was the son of Rishi
Atharvan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atharvan> of the Atharvaveda
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atharvaveda>, and the father of Pippalada
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippalada> of the Prasna Upanishad
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasna_Upanishad>. His name is seen to occur
in the first Mandala of the Rig Veda, and in the Bhagavata Purana
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana>. Rishi Kakshivana, the
sage of the Rig Veda <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rig_Veda> Sukta
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukta> 119 which is addressed to the Ashvins
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashvins>, in Mantra
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra> 9 tells us :

praise-song for you. Aushij in delight of Soma tells how Dadhichi, told you
the secret of his mind after the head of his horse was cured."[6]
