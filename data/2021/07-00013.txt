[INDOLOGY] modality, exclusion and pervasion

Dear Brendan,
just to clarify: I was only expressing a hunch about where one could
start looking for notions of modality that are not just linguistic.  I
generally agree with the points made in this thread by Matthew Kapstein
and John Taber that modality was not a subject of systematic reflection
(though I would like to reread the arguments Birgit Kellner indicated in
this light), and I also share John Taber?s opinion about necessary truth
in this context.
Best wishes,
Patrick McAllister
