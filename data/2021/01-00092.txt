[INDOLOGY] fire
Dear Patrick,
See also chapters VI.42-43 of the /Mok?op?ya/ (MU) in which ?iva  
expounds to the sage Vasi??ha that /both /forms of worship, namely the  
"outward/outer"/ (b?hya)/ and "interior/inner" /(antar)/ or "mental"  
/(m?nasa)/ "worship"/ (p?j?)/, are actually and exclusively realized  
as ongoing /?tmadhy?na/. [According to his own words (MU VI.33.12),  
?iva teaches here the "excellent" /(vara)/ or "very best" /(anuttama)/  
form of /dev?rcana/, which, when performed, will lead immediately to  
liberation.]
Best wishes,
Roland Steiner
