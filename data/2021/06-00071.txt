What universities offer a BA in the Sanskrit language?
  *   Oxford (link<https://www.ed.ac.uk/literatures-languages-cultures/asian-studies/sanskrit/undergraduate-study>)
  *   [add yours here]
I do mean a BA devoted specifically to Sanskrit language and literature, not courses where it is a component, like area studies, South Asian civilization, etc.
