Dear Aaron (if I may),
There is, to my knowledge, little to no writing on this, so the following
are the most basic of leads (and I'm afraid may not be that helpful) but
here goes:
You may already know that the earliest textual history of the
*R?macaritam?nas* was published by Mataprasad Gupta in his *Tulas?d?s : eka
sam?locan?tmak adhyayan *(1942); he of course doesn't mention the
*Lavaku?ak???*.
Imre Banga at Oxford has recently been revisiting the textual history of
the *R?macaritam?nas*; he may have some leads.
Biographical and bibliographical information for the scholar and translator
Pandit Ramanarayan Pandey may provide some leads; he edited one of the
editions containing the *Lavaku?ak??? *and was incidentally a prolific
translator into Avadhi/Hindi from Bengali.
On that eastern connection, the *Lava-Ku?a *narrative enjoys wider
circulation in Bengal and Orissa than it does in Avadh; though I'm only
speculating on a possible connection here, you may want to look at William
Smith's ?Variants of the Lavaku?op?khy?na? In *Categorization and
Interpretation.*
All best for the search,
