>> Hi everyone,

>> I am reminded by Professor Paul Dundas of a few other points that

>>
>>   * Paul Dundas (?Somnolent S?tras: Scriptural Commentary in
>>     ?vet?mbara Jainism," /Journal of Indian Philosophy/?24: 73?101,
>>     1996) says the following (p. 78: see the notes for the sources):
>>       o The Jain position with regard to scripture and commentary
>>         upon it,?of whatever type or period, is strongly predicated
>>         upon the acceptance?of meaning as being superior to word.?
>>         This can be seen clearly from?the standard Jain etymology for
>>         the term ?s?tra? which would derive?it from the root s?c,
>>         ?indicate.? A s?tra ?indicates? many meanings?which the
>>         teacher explicates through commentary, obtaining the
>>         sense?from the root text in the same manner as a potter
>>         creates shapes from a?lump of clay.
>>   * Mari Jvy?rsj?rvi (?Retrieving the Hidden Meaning: Jain
>>     Commentarial Techniques and the Art of Memory,? /Journal of
>>     Indian Philosophy /38.2: 133?162, 2010), cites Sa?ghad?sa?s
>>     commentary on the /Br?hatkalpa /(p. 138):
>>       o Sutra [becomes sutta] just like supta; or s?tra has a double
>>         meaning [ 's?tra is?a thread']. Or it becomes sutta because
>>         it indicates [s?cana] the meaning, or is?well-spoken
>>         [s?kta].?These are its etymologies: it 'indicates' or it
>>         'sews,' or also 'it is produced,' or?'it follows.' These are
>>         the divisions [of etymology], and these are its names.?S?tra
>>         is like a person who is slumbering: unless it is "awakened"
>>         by meaning,
>>         it cannot be known. Or due to the similarity in [words that
>>         have] double?meanings, many meanings are joined together.?A
>>         needle, even when broken, can be traced by the thread as long
>>         as it is?threaded. Likewise meaning [is pointed out] by the
>>         s?tra. It 'sews together'?words and meanings like a thread
>>         [sews together] jackets and so on.13
>>   * The name of one of the older texts in the ?v?t?mbara canon,
>>     S?yaga?a-, is often rendered as S?trakr?ta-, but the first part
>>     doesn't correspond to the usual development of the Old Indic word
>>     s?tra-. Willem Boll?e suggested that it might come from
>>     *s?ca-kr?ta- or *s?ca-gata- (in his glossary to /Studien zum
>>     S?yaga?a/, vol. 1, p. 197). Compare the Sanskrit word /s?c?/.
