Dear helpful colleagues,

In Volker Caumanns? book, Shakya-mchog-ldan, Mah?pa??ita des Klosters gSer-mdog-can (Wiesbaden, 2015), he presents material on an Indian monk in Tibet named Lokottara, who self-identifies as of the S??mit?ya nik?ya, and says his home is in eastern India, in a place called Sa?gharatna. This is 15th century. I know of a Sa?gharatna in Kerala, but not one in eastern India. Would anyone have a clue where that might have been (still is?), and what might correspond to it in today?s India?

Thank you.
Dan
