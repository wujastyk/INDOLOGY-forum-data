 Thanks, Dan.
I found a similar thing in Boyce, as cited in that article. Unfortunately, that story is somewhat more mundane and roundabout as it relates to haoma (Vedic Soma) and cows -- which is interesting in its own way.
But it doesn't help me in my specific research question dealing with this particular myth about Indo-European divine births. At least not as directly.
It does inspire me to follow up on your reference, though.
Best,
Dean
