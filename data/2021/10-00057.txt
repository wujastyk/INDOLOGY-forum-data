Dear colleagues,
I am pleased to announce that the following volumes are now available:

This publication results from a two-day international symposium

Paris. The symposium was organised jointly by the ?cole Pratique des
Hautes ?tudes (EPHE) ? UMR 7528 Mondes iranien et indien and the
Centre de Recherches sur l?Extr?me Orient de Paris?Sorbonne (CREOPS).
