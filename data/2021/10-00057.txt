Dear colleagues,

I am pleased to announce that the following volumes are now available:

Murugaiyan, Appasamy & Parlier-Renault, ?dith (2021) (Eds) Whispering
of Inscriptions: South Indian Epigraphy and Art History: Papers from
an International Symposium in memory of Professor Noboru Karashima
(Paris, 12?13 October 2017). Oxford: Indica et Buddhica. (2 vols)

This publication results from a two-day international symposium
? Epigraphie et histoire de l?art de l?Inde m?ridionale: Colloque
international en m?moire du professeur Noboru Karashima ? held on
12?13 October 2017 at the Institut National d?Histoire de l?Art,
Paris. The symposium was organised jointly by the ?cole Pratique des
Hautes ?tudes (EPHE) ? UMR 7528 Mondes iranien et indien and the
Centre de Recherches sur l?Extr?me Orient de Paris?Sorbonne (CREOPS).

Details on the two volumes can be found here, and on the pages
accessed through the left hand side menu:

In addition, the proceedings can be downloaded as two open access
PDFs; copies of these PDFs have just been lodged with the National
Library of New Zealand and will soon be permanently available through
the National Digital Archive.


With best regards,
