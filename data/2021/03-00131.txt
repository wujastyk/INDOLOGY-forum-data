Dear colleagues,

I am pleased to announce the publication of volume 5 of the critical
edition of the Skandapur??a (Adhy?yas 96-112. The Var?ha Cycle and the
Andhaka Cycle Continued):
https://brill.com/view/title/59532

Thanks to the support of the J. Gonda Fund Foundation, its electronic
version is made available in Open Access. Of course there is nothing that
beats the real thing: the hardback can be pre-ordered from Brill and will
be available from 21 April.

The following link provides an overview of all the volumes published so far
in the series:

For review copies for journal editors please contact Mrs. Patricia Radder
at Brill publishers: Radder at brill.com

We hope you enjoy the text as much as we do!

Best regards,
Also on behalf of Yuko Yokochi,
Peter Bisschop
