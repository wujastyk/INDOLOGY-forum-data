[INDOLOGY] A Songster's Hairdo, a Waistcloth, and a pregnant Lizard
Dear List members,
For those interested, on my website I have under the heading "Publications> Articles" posted a short article titled: "A Songster's Hairdo, a Waistcloth, and a Pregnant Lizard", in which an attempt is made try to find out what these three "things", which in Old Tamil Ca?kam literature are linked together in comparisons, have in common with each other.
With kind regards, Herman
