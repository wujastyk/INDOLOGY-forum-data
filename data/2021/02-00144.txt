[INDOLOGY] apology for involving the list
I apologize for the fact that the message below was by accident also sent to the list. I do take this opportunity to add that I am glad that I am also a sanskritist: Sanskrit does not have speakers. This is true in the sense that one is not born a Sanskrit speaker, or a "son of Mother Sanskrit", to vary on Tamiltt?y.
Dear Jean-Luc, thank you very much for the information.
