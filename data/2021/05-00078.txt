Dear VSR,
thanks a lot for your clarification,
/*?????????????* ?????? (from coconut trees)/
which I find upon waking up this morning on this side of the Atlantic 
ocean, although it would nevertheless take one hour to fly to the Ocean :-)
Yesterday, before going to bed, I had also sent a message to our common 
friend Sharmila Ganesan (whom I know thanks to you :-)
She had also replied to me she thought it was thennai olai and that she 
would make further verifications.
This morning I had another message from her which she sent after 
consulting with Prof Selvakumar of Tamil University, Thanjai
and he also says it appears to be thennai olai.
His inputs:
Odi = ??? fold
He refers to this blog:
https://ilupeju.blogspot.com/2009/11/divine-labour-ward.html
He also sent a Ph.D. on the topic,
which I shall forward privately to you, to Herman and to Srilata because 
I am not sure how well the PDF would go on the mailing list server
