I didn't try to order it, but it is at least listed here:

One would like to think that the Austrian Academy can afford to buy books,
even if individuals cannot afford them...
But maybe this is a victim of the unceremonious death of the Istituto
Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente? i was told that all back stock of books
had been pulped, though I never confirmed this.
Can someone clarify?
