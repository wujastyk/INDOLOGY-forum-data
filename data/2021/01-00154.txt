Summary
The combination of the stems yoga- and khema-/k?ema- occurs in phrases or compounds in both ancient and in middle Indo-Aryan sources but what is intriguing is that such a combination is generally interpreted as coordinating in the former occurrences and as subordinating in the latter ones. In particular, yogakkhema- within the Buddhist Therav?da Canon and its commentarial literature is regularly analysed as a tatpuru?a and often translated as ?freedom from bondage or safety?.We recently presented a part of the Vedic and Pali documentation collected in the context of more broadly shared research on this subject during the 18th Conference of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (Section: ?Buddhism and Its relation to other religions?) held at the University of Toronto on August 20th?25th, 2017, now published as Pontillo and Neri 2019. The case of yogak?ema/yogakkhema in Vedic and Suttapi?aka sources. In response to Norman. In: Journal of Indian Philosophy 47(3): 527?563. Here, we shall take a further step in the above-mentioned comparison by concentrating on the occurrences of the compound yogak?ema/yogakkhema as found in the upani?ads and in the Bhagavadg?t? and in some comparable Suttapi?aka passages with the aim of understanding what might have been the boundary that this word historically crossed in the framework of an assumed dialogue between different traditions.
