Dear Prof. Ryan,

Esteemed colleagues mostly are pointing out here that such derivation is
not likely or necessary, but it does not change the fact that the early
Buddhist *suttas *are wordy dialogues (or monologues) that narrate the
matters in a rather lively manner, but the Brahmanic *s?tras *are terse and
extremely succinct coded messages, which do resemble "threads" (Sanskrit "
*s?tra*") as such. The contrast to me is very striking. How can we explain
it? For instance, assuming that *s?tra *and *sutta *are different words
(and "literary genres").

Kind regards,
