[INDOLOGY] The Buddhist term sutta
Dear Prof. Ryan,
Esteemed colleagues mostly are pointing out here that such derivation is
not likely or necessary, but it does not change the fact that the early
Buddhist *suttas *are wordy dialogues (or monologues) that narrate the
matters in a rather lively manner, but the Brahmanic *s?tras *are terse and
extremely succinct coded messages, which do resemble "threads" (Sanskrit "
*s?tra*") as such. The contrast to me is very striking. How can we explain
it? For instance, assuming that *s?tra *and *sutta *are different words
(and "literary genres").
