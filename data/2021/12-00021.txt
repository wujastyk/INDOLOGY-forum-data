A request and a question. I have the physical book, but need either an
electronic version or another hard copy for some friends. If someone has
already scanned it, that would save me the time to scan my copy. Thanks.
Gnoli's edition (1960) seems to be highly regarded, and would be superior
to Malvaniya's nearly contemporaneous edition (1959), because Gnoli had an
additional manuscript to use, and also compared the Tibetan translation. I
have not noticed any critical review of Gnoli's edition that might offer
some corrections to it.
By chance I checked verse 254 and noticed that in 254c the word "hi" in
Gnoli's edition is "sy?t" in other editions, including Malvaniya's (verse
258a in this edition). The manuscript that Malvaniya used is one of the two
manuscripts that Gnoli used. Yet, there is no mention of this as a variant
reading in Gnoli's edition. I wonder why.
