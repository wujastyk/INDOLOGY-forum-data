Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vasucaritra (4.72) and Manucaritra (2.43)
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrB6vUeLJGbe09wB=Y+zfXg4vnHH=ZfLu5fVW1_Z1+nNKw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Might anyone have digitized AND romanized versions of
the Vasucaritra and Manucaritra?

I'm expressly interested in

Vasucaritra (4.72), which mentions Gari?is (the city gymnasia) and

Manucaritra (2.43), which mentions S?mugari??lu (gari?is).

Thank you.

All the best,

????? ???????
