Thank you, Dear Professor Srilata Raman.
It?s interesting ? ????? (mozham or mo?am, however we transcribe it) is the length of measurement from one?s elbow up to the tip of the middle finger. So, the length of this ?????/????? would vary depending upon the person who?s doing the measurement. For example, my muzham/mozham/mo?am is about 16-inches. Others? may vary. 
So, I?m curious about the measurements used in ?ilpa ??stra texts. I?ll keep exploring.
Again, thanks Professor Srilata Raman.
Regards,
rajam
