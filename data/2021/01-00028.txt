[INDOLOGY] Chaos in Indian mythology and philosophy
Dr Dimitry.As far as "chaos" in Indian Philosophy is concerned, concepts&nbsp;
&nbsp;like "Vada , Jalpa , Vitanda" , being the Sanskrit equivalents of Argument and counter-arguement , as propounded in the&nbsp; Nyay school of Indian Philosophy , may be&nbsp; an answer to your query.

[INDOLOGY] Chaos in Indian mythology and philosophy
Dear list members,&nbsp;
I would be very thankful for any suggestions and works, which have studied the concepts in Indian philosophy and religion related or similar to the Western concept of "chaos".
Best to all,
