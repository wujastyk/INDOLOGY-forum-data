[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit mnemonics?
Dear Antonia.
There is this verse in the Mukunda-mAlA (verse 33 in some editions) --
k???o rak?atu no jagat-traya-guru? k???a? namasy?my aha?
k???en?mara-?atravo vinihat?? k????ya tasmai nama? |
k????d eva samutthita? jagad ida? k???asya d?so 'smy aha?
k???e ti??hati sarvam etad akhila? he k???a sa?rak?a m?m ||
Best wishes,
Aleksandar

[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit mnemonics?
Dear all,
Whenever I've learnt a language in a classroom setting, we'd get mnemonics to help us remember word forms or uses. (I am thinking of things like 'after si, nisi, num, ne, all the ali's fly away', or 'If one shwa by another is hounded, the first is silent, the second sounded.')
Do any of you have any such mnemonics (no matter how silly - or dare I say: the sillier, the better?) for Sanskrit? So far I only have minuscule things like reminding students of Har*e* K???a (for the vocative of i-stems), and also verses like
gurureva gatirgurumeva bhaje guru?aiva sah?smi namo gurave |
na guro? parama? ?i?urasmi gurormatirastu gurau mama p?hi guro ||
If you have anything you use that works well with your students, I'd be grateful if you were willing to share it. I'll happily sum up everything I get in an email to the List.
Many thanks, as always,
    Antonia
