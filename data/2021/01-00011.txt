[INDOLOGY] very interesting site
Dear All
On the always interesting (well, mostly interesting) Language Log one finds
this: https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=49861#more-49861
The site itself is here: https://en.amarahasa.com/
It seems very interesting, and while it is avowedly a work in progress, I
could see this being quite useful for students!
(Nota bene: I haven't  explored the site yet, so this is not an endorsement
[not that I'm in a position to endorse anything, of course!], just
information)
