Subject: [INDOLOGY] very interesting site
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4KZ39Z37_CLD8Wy2-B7Dt3eOxowSFU2xtWw23cuKC49pw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

On the always interesting (well, mostly interesting) Language Log one finds
this: https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=49861#more-49861

The site itself is here: https://en.amarahasa.com/

It seems very interesting, and while it is avowedly a work in progress, I
could see this being quite useful for students!

(Nota bene: I haven't  explored the site yet, so this is not an endorsement
[not that I'm in a position to endorse anything, of course!], just
information)

Jonathan
