Many thanks for the good news!.

So now there is hope that I may finally see a Banaras Skt. Univ. manuscript that I had applied for nearly 50 years ago:

on my third fruitless visit to their library in April 1974, I applied for a microfilm, paid the fee, (even left them a long raw film and developer)  ? but have not yet received my film, in spite of reminders.

Some years ago the then director wrote to me in another matter. I said I could help ? provided he would send my my film. Crickets?. No answer.

Luckily some enlightened officials (also elsewhere) take a different approach now.

Cheers!

Michael

Dear Dhaval,

     This news is wonderful indeed. Let us hope that the NMM carries out the task in a timely manner, and that the manuscripts become available for scholarly use. Thanks for your efforts. Best wishes,

Dear scholars,

This information may be of interest to those of you who work with manuscripts for their research. It is regarding access of manuscripts digitized by National Mission for Manuscripts, Government of India.

I would like to bring it to the notice of this august gathering that my second appeal in honourable Central Information Commission was decided on 30.10.2021. The order is attached herewith.

Honourable Information Commissioner Mr. Uday Mahurkar has decided this matter with a well reasoned order.

The order directs NMM to do two things.
1. Put the digitized manuscripts (roughly 3 lacs) in public domain within a period of 1 year
and
2. Allow me access of 30000 manuscripts for downloading the same within a period of 1 month.

This order would surely pave the way for easier access of manuscripts digitized by NMM to research scholars.

 I once again pay my respects to the honourable Information Commissioner for enabling access to this centuries old manuscript treasure of India. I also place my appreciation on record for NMM and manuscript repositories without whose support the manuscripts would not have been digitized, and their digital access would have been impossible.

Dr. Dhaval Patel
