About aruvi ?mpal in Pati??uppattu 63, line 19:
a?aiya?uppa?iy? varuvi y?mpal
?yita vel?l?a v??i
v??iy?ta v??iya palav?.
O V??iy?ta?, may you live long, living through the great floods of thousand Kalpas (??i), (floods) which make a loud noise (?mpal) produced by waterfalls ([v]aruvi) and which (the floods, of else the waterfalls, in which case "and" is to be deleted) are unstoppable (a?ai a?uppa a?iy?)
One of the meanings of ?mpal is the music (noise) produced by blowing through a pipe. It is not exactly the type of noise produced by a waterfall.
I had already removed the mails by Palaniappan and Jean-Luc. Therefore this reaction is not attached to their exchange, which took place under the wrong heading anyhow (The date of ...), a topic, which, as you will know, is otherwise close to my heart.
With kind regards
