[INDOLOGY] Sculptures (from Assam) that I'd like to identify
 Dear Indologists,
during my fieldwork in Baihata Chariali (Assam) I took some pictures that I
would like to identify (I attached one in this email). The scenes were
probably sculpted within the iconographic programme of a temple complex
belonging to the XII century. The site is not scientifically preserved and
the remains of all the temples were messed up.
Any idea will be apreciated!
Sincerely,
Paolo
