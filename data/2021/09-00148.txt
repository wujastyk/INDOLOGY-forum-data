Dear Joanna, Madhav and All,
regarding the pronunciation of the vowel ?  (ru, ri), the original pronunciation as vowel  (without i, u) is still retained in the very conservative Kerala Veda recitation,
as in RV 1.1.1 : agnim  ? ?tvijam. Or even in the word  Sa?sk?tam. ? Or also in Croatian/Serbian in the name of the beautiful island of Krk (I have been there). Or in ?red wine? crno vino (I have ordered it!) Just listen to it in translate.google<http://translate.google/>. Think of the vowel r in the American pronunciation of Peter  [p?dR], of course not = Skt. ?
Like wise for the vowel ? (cannot find a recorded example quickly)  ? As in Czech  vlk ?wolf?  = v?ka. Just listen to it in translate.google<http://translate.google/>. Think of American ?bottle' [bodL], of course not = Skt. ?.
Cheers,
Michael

Hi Joanna,
     My mother-tongue is Marathi and I studied Sanskrit in Pune. Marathi does have the retroflex consonants of Sanskrit, except that the contrast of ?/? is not clear for most speakers. In Marathi, r? is typically pronounced as ru, unlike ri in north India, and the combination j?a is typically pronounced as dnya. So, while teaching my students, I am able to personally demonstrate how the retroflex consonants are pronounced and gradually guide my students to that pronunciation. For my Sanskrit class, I insist on pronouncing j?a as a combination of j+?, rather than as dnya in Marathi or like gya in the Hindi area. For r?, I am generally following the Marathi ru, because I have no idea how that r? was pronounced in ancient times. I also try to make the distinction between ?/? clear. It is pretty much lost in Marathi, but a few Sanskrit scholars in Pune conscientiously used to make that distinction in their pronunciation, and I am following that. That is just about what I can say regarding my own teaching. Best,
Madhav

Well, I was somehow misunderstood. I am not going to reconstruct or teach the original Sanskrit pronunciation. I have explained that the formulation "native Sanskrit speakers" was unfortunate.
But we all teach Sanskrit, don't we? And we have to explain to our students how to pronounce e.g. cerebral consonants. Do they exist or not? If they do, I think that the website mentioned by Adheesh could also be very useful  in teaching Sanskrit phonetics. That's all.
I would be rather interested in how you teach Sanskrit phonetics in practice? I have described how I do that. Do you have the same painstaking methods?

No historically authentic Sanskrit pronunciation has survived in India today, because no modern Indian language preserves all Sanskrit sounds. However, there are regional standards of Sanskrit pronunciation, which may be described in terms like the Pune pronunciation, Banaras pronunciation, Mysore pronunciation etc. Sanskrit scholars in these different regions generally follow that regional standard. Reciters of the same Veda from different regions also have their regional standards. The Yajurveda recited in Maharashtra sounds different from the Yajurveda recited in south India. This is to be expected given the diverse linguistic history of India that has left its marks also on the pronunciation of Sanskrit. Even works like R?ja?ekhara's K?vyam?m??s? give details of the regional peculiarities of Sanskrit pronunciation and recitation of Sanskrit poetry.

Dear Johanna,
I was just wondering to what extent, without native speakers (and even with modern native speakers), we have any chance of reconstructing classical Sanskrit phonetics. Devanagari is of course much closer to the ?one grapheme - one phoneme? ideal than e.g. Greek or Latin writing are, and in some later grammatical works we have descriptions is how sounds are to be pronounced; but that still usually only gives us an overview of phonemes, and not necessarily their complete phonetic reality.
I think it?s much more important to teach our students to be consistent in their approximations, so as to be intelligible, than to give them the idea that there is *one* correct ?ideal? pronunciation, so to speak.
All best,
     Antonia

What a wonderful website!
I wish I could use ultrasonography when I teach my students to explain the Sandhi phenomena, e.g. cerebralisation of consonants (cerebral consonants are the most difficult consonants for Polish speakers).
For example, it takes me much time to explain them how to pronounce the noun  k???a. I tell them that if they want to properly  express it,  they have to realise:
1) that they have to open their mouth slightly more than when they speak Polish  and release the muscles of their chicks and other muscles of the lower part of their face,
1)  that when they open the mouth slightly more and pronounce the guttural "k", they will have a lot of place between the tip of the tongue and the palate,
2)  that, having pronounced "k", they have to push the tip of the tongue slightly back (which is now not difficult thanks to creation of space in the mouth), and quickly move it in order to pronounce the vocalical "?" (which is the same movement as in Polish "r"),
3) that, having pronounced "?", they still  have to keep their tongue back (to "yoke" it) in order to pronounce the sibilant "?" (which is contrary to Polish habit to move the tongue a bit forward to pronounce the Polish consonant "sz", the same is for English "sh"),
4) that, having pronounced "?", they still have to "yoke" their tongue in the same position to pronounce the cerebral "?".
I make funny faces when I try to "show" them this process, they laugh at me, and I ask them why they don't laugh at people at the gym who train various muscles of their body (which might look very funny too) and that the tongue is a muscle too, moreover its structure is unique to human species, because it allows us to speak. Then  we come back to the exercises until they say "wow, if we push our tongue back and keep it there, there is no problems with "?" !".  Then they have to exercise until they are able to pronounce the word quickly.
The fact that the larynx is placed slightly more below in Sanskrit pronunciation than in Polish  is the upani?ad and I teach it to them later on. I have some devices to explain how to lower one's larynx. But the video would be of much help.
The movements of lips  (generally speaking the whole vocal apparatus) are also different, but this is easier to be shown. And the role of breathing is crucial, of course (which I teach my students from the very beginning).
If I had such a device, it would be easier for me to explain to them "the art of yoking of the tongue".
It would be great if we could create such videos with Sanskrit native speakers which would take into account the invisible aspects of Sanskrit phonetics. I'd gladly take part in such an enterprise!
Thank you very much, Adheesh. I will certainly use the page during my phonetics classes to show the movements of the tongue in general perspective.
Best wishes,
Joanna

Dear Marcis et al,
I don?t know if this will be useful for your purposes, but the Linguistics department here at UBC has designed a website called ?eNunciate!? with various linguistics learning tools, including ?Sounds of the World?s Languages?, which provides videos illustrating the pronunciation of a broad range of IPA consonants and vowels, including, presumably, all sounds within the Sanskrit syllabary.
They feature both graphical representations like you are looking for, as well as actual ultrasound captures of a live speaker.
The site can be accessed here: https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/linguistics/world-sounds/<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__enunciate.arts.ubc.ca_linguistics_world-2Dsounds_&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=tFXzIbyKS2C0TpVqKsMrj46qwsAermBN5wzaDe51So0&m=H5Bs3ihYMnGJSz0-9unZVIZM7dwn4gyVT36BAeKVp2M&s=9ErP1m2G1sOPUPLQ8_2ihp61BY97CSDiV7-GUmniHHY&e=>

For a list of correspondences between IPA and the Sanskrit syllabary, you may consult Andrew Ollett?s excellent Sanskrit reference grammar (v?ddhi?) at the Univ. of Chicago, here: http://prakrit.info/vrddhi/grammar/<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__prakrit.info_vrddhi_grammar_&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=tFXzIbyKS2C0TpVqKsMrj46qwsAermBN5wzaDe51So0&m=H5Bs3ihYMnGJSz0-9unZVIZM7dwn4gyVT36BAeKVp2M&s=aq2d2LeKDeDGDJ1fi181gS2JNHcwNF-4oAom9K-w7Rk&e=>
I am also currently making youtube videos that you can find if search for UBC Sanskrit on Youtube. These may or may not be useful.
