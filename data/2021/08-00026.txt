Dear Indologists,

 

In the Cilappatik?ram, the Tamil epic often dated ca. 5th century CE, the courtesan M?tavi performs 11 dances possibly based on puranic themes. Of these 11, four deal with dances performed by K???a, Vi??u, Indr??i, and Manmatha as part of their conflict with B???sura. I would appreciate any references to the story of B??a in Sanskrit sources. Do these Sanskrit sources mention any such dances? ??Also, how does the Sanskrit tradition explain the kingship of B??a in light of V?mana sending Bali to the netherworld?

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
