Dear friends,
I have been wondering about something that is perhaps only tangent to  
the discussion. Can one distinguish between reductio ad absurdum  
(prasanga) and modus tollens (also prasanga?) in the Indian tradition?  
I am not sure that the distinction between the two is clear in the  
Western tradition either.
With best wishes,
Eli
