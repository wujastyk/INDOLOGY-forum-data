Dear List members,
As I do not know of a journal that might be interested in a short article on the word ka??am in three Ca?kam poems, two of which deal with divination by the v?la? priest, I have placed a pdf on my website, sub "articles" (for the year 2012).
The title of the article is "Muruka? in the molucca beans".
Kind regards, Herman
