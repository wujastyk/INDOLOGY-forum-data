[INDOLOGY] Question about the Indian grammatical tradition's
 impact on Western philology and linguistics
Dear Brendan,
I would just add one text to this wonderful list:  ?Philology: the
forgotten origins of the modern humanities? by James Turner (2015,
Princeton Press). It?s a nice comprehensive overview of the political and
academic context of philology and Sanskrit.
Valeas,
Tejas
