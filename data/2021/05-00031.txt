Thanks Daniel,

I was going to mention Pandanus as well - if anyone has feedback or requests for that database, feel free to reach out to me offline!

Hello,
as far as flora is concerned, the Pandanus database http://iu.ff.cuni.cz/pandanus/database/ is still around. For finding the current standard taxonomic names corresponding to the often dated ones in Sanskrit dictionaries, The Plant List http://www.theplantlist.org/ is a useful resource. I hope others will add more.
Best wishes,
Daniel

Greetings,

 ?There is an excellent book in English on Ornitology and an impressive, but not so huge list of Flora in India in German. About Fauna in India there is only a book I'm aware about dogs. Advice wanted.
 ? You better do not trust most of the dictionaries, because they say, that ?????? ?blue lotus?, ??????? ?the curlew or snipe? ? ??? ?female antelope? - and that is not really so. For that reason I would love to hear some stories around some mistakes in the dictionaries regarding the taxonomy and some stories how to get around them with trustable sources:

I've have found https://www.biodiversityofindia.org/, but it does not contain far too many of the 1750 Latin plant names I was able to extract from Monier-Williams (https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/simple/). What other good reference works online or scanned books would you recommend, please. Some major (not only Indian related DB would be of interest as well).
