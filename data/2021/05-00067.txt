Dear Artur,
Thank you for your interest, but my latest research on the way Vedic texts
conceptualize and reflect ideas like society, lineage, family, etc. and
their conceptual history in the post-Vedic period...is not published yet
and I'm still trying to think through it (some of my thoughts on this are
in "The Invention of Vedic Authority" which will come out in Bloomsbury'*s
A Cultural History of Hinduism in Antiquity *ed by Jarrod Whitaker). I will
instead refer to other scholars' work which has influenced my thinking
about the *yaj?a *a great deal (too name just a few: Proferes 2007 *Vedic
Ideals of Sovereignty and the Poetics of Power, *Ferrara 2016 "One Yaj?a,
Many Rituals" and Ferrara 2016 "The Function of the Yaj?a Between
Practitioners and Clients", Jamison 2019 "Vedic Ritual: The Sacralization
of the Mundane and the Domestication of the Sacred" (in the same volume as
Jan's "Ecology of Ritual Innovation in Ancient India: Textual and
Contextual Evidence.? ed. by Lauren Bausch)
Most of my published work focuses on theorizing Vedic
performativity/textuality (

)
and then using this performative lens to read Vedic narrative through that
specific context
