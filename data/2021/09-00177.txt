[INDOLOGY] PDF of  Finot 1934,
 Manuscripts Sanskrits de sadhanas retrouves en Chine
Dear all,
I am asking for a colleague who is not on this list if anyone might be  
able to share a pdf of
  Finot, Louis, "Manuscripts Sanskrits de sadhanas retrouves en  
Chine", Journal Asiatique, Vol. 225 (1934), pp. 1-85.
In theory, it should be available here:  
https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb34348774p/date1934 , but it does  
not seem to be actually there.
Best
Peter
