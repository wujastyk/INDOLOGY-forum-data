We seek candidates whose research and teaching interests complement and enhance our existing departmental strengths<https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/about/>.

Candidates must provide evidence of excellence in research as demonstrated by a record of sustained high-impact contributions and publications in top-ranked and field relevant journals, the submitted research statement, presentations at significant conferences, distinguished awards and accolades for innovative work, other noteworthy activities that contribute to the visibility and prominence of the discipline, and strong endorsements by referees of high standing. The successful candidate will have an established international reputation and will be expected to sustain and lead an independent and innovative research program in South Asian Philosophy, and to be conducting an outstanding and competitive research program at a high level in contemporary metaphysics/epistemology.

The successful candidate must also be able to teach a wide range of courses in philosophy from the introductory to advanced levels, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Candidates must provide evidence of excellence in teaching as demonstrated through teaching accomplishments, the teaching dossier (including the statement of teaching philosophy), sample course materials, and teaching evaluations, as well as strong letters of reference.

Salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience.

Candidates should demonstrate, in their application materials, an ability to foster diversity on campus and within the curriculum or discipline, and should show evidence of a commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion, and the promotion of a respectful and collegial environment. Candidates should submit a statement describing their contributions to equity, diversity, and inclusion, which might cover topics such as (but not limited to): teaching that incorporates a focus on underrepresented communities; efforts undertaken to develop inclusive pedagogies, collaboration, and engagement with underrepresented communities; and mentoring of students from underrepresented groups.
