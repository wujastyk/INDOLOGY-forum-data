To all Vajapeyins:

I have an electronic copy of the Poona performance, made a few years ago from a VCR cassette tape.
But it is around 650 MB, so I would have to send it to interested colleagues via WETRANSFER, so that you can download it.

I also have a photocopy of the Vajapeya booklet, but it is in my (closed) office and it would  have to be scanned.
Perhaps someone already has a scanned copy ?

So please let me know. After a day or two I will send the film to interested parties.

There also is a film of a Pravargya, done at Delhi, maybe a decade later. I think Jan Houben has it (as do I).

Finally there are multiple snippets of the Pravargya as part of the 2011 Agnicayana held at Panjal, Kerala. Some are in Youtube, if you look for Atiratra  (Athiraathra) [NB not the Indian cinema movie!).

Best wishes,

Michael

Are the materials Madhav cites the same as the Van Buitenen materials?

David Knipe's book, Vedic Voices: Intimate Narratives of a Living Andhra Tradition, has an entry in the bibliography for Van Buitenen's 1956, 13-pg, unpublished typescript that accompanies the film. (Perhaps he has the typescript in his possession.)Also, the entry for Van Buitenen's papers, held at the UC library, suggests that there are at least field notes to the film in their collection (but perhaps not the actual typescript that accompanied the film).

A 1977 multi-authored document written by Knipe, Morgan, Dell, McDermott, and Smith, "Focus on Hindusim: A-V Resources for Teaching Religion," indicates that even in 1977, the film was no longer to be found.

This was brought up years ago in the Indology list. In 2010, Jarrod Whitaker sent out the following:

Does anyone know how I can get hold of a copy of the film: Atha Vajapeyah Somayagah: The Vajapeya Sacrifice produced by J.A.B. van Buitenen, 1955. My inter-library loan people sent me this message: "We have exhausted all possible ILL sources.
There are no libraries that own this item that are ILL suppliers. Additionally, I have conducted online research and have been unable to locate the film as cited."
