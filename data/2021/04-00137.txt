Dear all,

I would like to second Diego's observations. Surely we as a discipline must do better in terms of gender representation in general, and particularly at such prominent events.

Best wishes

  Dear all,

  In the first place, I would like to say that I am excited about the seminar, for which I am already registered, and that I greatly look forward to it.
  On the other hand, I find the 10:1 ratio of men to women among the programmed speakers troubling since there is no dearth of female scholars in several fields that would have had much to say. Certainly Prof. Jurewicz would have been an ideal speaker for the seminar given her field of expertise and experience.
  I do understand how we often, when organizing events, first appeal to our immediate community and acquaintances, but I do want to encourage the field to pay closer attention to how we configure our projects, events, and initiatives.

  namaskaromi,

  Diego

Well, thank you, but  I feel horribly humiliated.

If someone criticized my  work, my methodology, if someone showed that I am talking nonsense, I do not understand Sanskrit, whatever,  I would understand why I am not with you - with you, people, born beyond the western border of the Oder. I have written plenty of  papers, two books on the Veda, ,the third is about to be published (my paper on conceptual connections between the Veda and the Buddhism is one of the most cited, positively),  trying to do that in English which is not my mother tongue in order to submit myself to the critics, to discussions, moreover, I can see that it makes sense what I do... and I could not do without cognitive linguistics which is difficult and I devoted much time to learn it too.

Sorry, Dominik, I am too old not to talk about it. In two years I will be sixty. Now I have nothing to lose.

But as I told you, I feel horribly humiliated. Do your duty and I will do mine.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Upcoming symposium on the Greater Magadha theory

Greater Magadha: Evaluation and Retrospective
An online symposium to discuss the Greater Magadha hypothesis of Johannes Bronkhorst
May 6 - 9, 2021  ?  University of Alberta (online)

In his 2007 book Greater Magadha<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.ca%2Fbooks%3Fid%3D4GNG5KuH73QC%26printsec%3Dfrontcover%26source%3Dgbs_ge_summary_r%26cad%3D0%23v%3Donepage%26q%26f%3Dfalse&data=04%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7C3e198b4fdb9743a0e84b08d90a79de04%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637552340820908085%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ubWQUdoW8C375EbvreEAcePcyXfCPke8olfauOEYgSk%3D&reserved=0>, Johannes Bronkhorst proposed a new theory for the historical formation of Indian culture in the mid-first millennium BCE. The theory proposed that a cultural and geographical area, Greater Magadha, was settled by an early wave of Indo-European speakers.  A second wave of Indo-European speakers, carriers of Vedic culture, subsequently encountered the Greater Magadhans to the east and the resultant cultural meeting gave rise to the main features known in later Indian history.  The Greater Magadha theory addresses many deep problems about the early formation of Indian culture that have long puzzled historians.  It has been widely accepted, but has also given rise to serious criticism.  This symposium will bring together some of the principal scholars who have engaged with the theory to discuss and retrospectively evaluate the theory just over a decade after it was proposed.

This symposium is hosted by Prof. Dominik Wujastyk at the Department of History, Classics and Religion at the University of Alberta and with the financial support of the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.

The symposium will be conducted online as a Zoom Webinar.

Full details of the symposium and registration are available at this website:
