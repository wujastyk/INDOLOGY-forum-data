Dear colleagues,

It strikes me that I ought to have given some reason for my abrupt 
warning against the English translation of Raymond Schwab's /Oriental 
Renaissance. /Let me quote the introductory paragraph of the review I 
gave it back in 1988:

"Scholars interested in the East-West intellectual encounter will 
welcome the publication of an English translation of Raymond Schwab's 
"La Renaissance Orientale", a book that, though 34 years old, has not 
been replaced. A look at the contents of this handsome volume reveals 
useful added features, such as an alphabetical and updated bibliography 
and a fuller and more readable index. A thorough perusal of the English 
translation, however, turns elation into disappointment. Not only was 
Schwab's difficult, poetic French occasionally beyond the powers of the 
translators, their lack of familiarity with Indian culture and 
Anglo-Indian history not infrequently led them astray." //

Examples are given in the core of the review. The full text can be found 
in /Orientalistische Literaturzeitung /86.4, 1988, coll. 471?473.
