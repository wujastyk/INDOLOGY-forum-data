Dear Dominik, Antonia, Prof. Rocher, and Colleagues,
On a different trajectory than Schwab, and apart from the history of area
studies in the US which is by now pretty thoroughly known, Pollock has
explored the antecedents and inter-connections of Philology, Classics,
Sanskrit, Oriental Studies, Indology and the Humanities in the
post-Enlightenment Western university quite consistently over the past
decade and a half.
You may find many articles of interest on this broad theme -- how the
disciplines are organized and departmentalized; how chairs, syllabi and
degrees emerge; what role the study of Sanskrit plays in the definition and
evolution of the modern humanities -- in a repository of his writings, here
<http://www.sheldonpollock.org>:

There are also reflections on the relationship -- or disjunction -- between
intellectual cultures, philological methods, reading practices, pedagogy,
translation, transmission etc. in India and in the West, before the
colonial university (largely) supplanted more "traditional" forms of
Sanskrit teaching and learning in colonial and post-colonial India.
A similar exercise was undertaken comparatively for China and the study of
classical Chinese. Some aspects of the history of Indology in France is here,
I think, though I haven't seen this work yet, except for Shelly's chapter
<http://www.sheldonpollock.org/archive/pollock_indian_2019.pdf>. Professors
Isabelle Ratie, Matthew Kapstein or Jan Houben would know more (about
the French case).
Best wishes,
Ananya.
