Dear List members,

I am looking for text passages of the soothsayer ka??uvicci in Tamil literature.

Apparently, the character is absent in Ca?kam poetry. The word does not occur in the standard indexes.

Unfortunately, I am unable to open the Digital T?v?ram disk, but I do not expect the character in ?aiva Bhakti poetry, but I maybe wrong here.

So far, I have found two references in Vai??ava Bhakti poetry, namely in Tiruv?ymo?i 4.6.3 and Ci?iya Tiruma?al 20. My question is: is there an index on this particular corpus? If not, is there someone who happens to know other, more occurrences of the word in Vai??ava poetry or knows of a publication about the ka??uvicci?

With kind regards, Herman
