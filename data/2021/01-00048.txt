Dear friends and colleagues,
I am looking to access a copy of the Vikram??k?bhyudaya by Some?vara 
III. An edition was published as "Vikram??k?bhyudayam of Some?vara" by 
M. L. Nagar in Gaekwad?s Oriental Series, no. 150. I have looked in vain 
in all the usual places online, and would be grateful for any pointers 
toward a digital copy.
Best regards,
Jacob
