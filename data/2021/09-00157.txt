Dear Dr Ryan,

This seems to have been a matter of debate within the tradition since quite
some time; cf. Uva?a at *?gvedapr?ti??khya* 1.1:

?ik??dibhir yat s?m?nyenotsarge?okta? lak?a?am | yath? t?vac chik??y?m syur
m?rdhany? ???ura???? s?m?nyena sarva??kh?su repho m?rdhanya ity ukta? |
tath?nyasy?? ?ik??y?m ?dantam?l?ya?? iti repho dantam?l?ya ukta? | eva?
sarv? ?ik?? var?e?u sth?nakara??nuprad?n?di sarv?su ??kh?su vidadh?ti | na
tu niyamata? kasy?? ??kh?y?? repho m?rdhanya? kasy?? dantam?l?ya iti | ata
etad vyavasth?pakam ?rabhyate ?dantam?l?yas tu tak?ravarga??
?sak?rarephalak?r?? ca? ?repha? vartsyam eke? | evam asy?? ??kh?y??
dantam?l?yo v? vartsyo v? repha ity etad avadh?ritam |

In any case, one should always keep in mind that phonetics and phonology
don't really have a one-to-one correspondence.

All best,
Giovanni
