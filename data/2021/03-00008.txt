[INDOLOGY] Re: On the Date of Classical Tamil Poems
Dear SP,
the explanation which I have seen for what you refer to as
? /aru+vi/, a compound ?
relies on "vi" to be the modified form of "v?" ?? (i.e. "flower)
I imagine the interpretation is
/aru-v? ?mpal/ = The ?mpal whose flowers are difficult to find (i.e. the 
?mpal which does not have flowers, i.e. the big number referred to by 
the designation ?mpal
But why is there a need to shorten v? into vi in the first place?
Another possibility is to take "aruvi" as being the item referred to by 
one entry on page 136 of the Madras Tamil Lexicon
????? aruvi (p. 136)
*?????? aruvi , n. < a-r?pin. That which is formless, shapeless; 
?????????????. ??????? ???? ??????? (?????. 6, 53).
Then "aruvi ?mpal" means the shapeless ?mpal
(which is not a flower but a big number)
Does that sound plausible?
Best wishes
