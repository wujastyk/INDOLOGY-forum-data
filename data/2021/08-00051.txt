[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit mnemonics?

Dear all,
are there really no other mnemonics or are they perhaps too childish to 
post them on this list?  I also like to use the verse r?mo r?jamani? 
etc., but rather in order to recall the order and numbering of 
vibhaktis.
Is there a common word for "mnemonic" in Sanskrit?
