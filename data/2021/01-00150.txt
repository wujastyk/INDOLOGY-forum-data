[INDOLOGY] Book recommendations? Folklore, British colonial era
I would recommend this book:
J. Abbott, The Keys of Power: A Study of Indian Ritual and Belief, London: Methuen, 1932.
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.219400
It is a treasure that I consult quite often. There are several Indian reprints (under the title: Indian ritual and belief: The keys of power), I have this one (from Manohar, it costs only 750 Rs):

The book will be reprinted this year by Routledge (and will cost ?130!):
