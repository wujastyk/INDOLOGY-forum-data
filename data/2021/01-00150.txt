I would recommend this book:

J. Abbott, The Keys of Power: A Study of Indian Ritual and Belief, London: Methuen, 1932.
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.219400

It is a treasure that I consult quite often. There are several Indian reprints (under the title: Indian ritual and belief: The keys of power), I have this one (from Manohar, it costs only 750 Rs):
https://www.manoharbooks.com/BookDetails.asp?Id=2835&isbn=9788173043390

The book will be reprinted this year by Routledge (and will cost ?130!):

> The Rites of the Twice-Born, by Sinclair Stevenson. Mrs Stevenson was a missionary trying to bring Christianity to Hindu women, so her account obviously reflects her prejudices. But she clearly loved the women themselves, and the book tells you a great deal about both sides of the colonial story and the way of life of upper class Hindus at the time. And it?s by and about women! Hooray!
