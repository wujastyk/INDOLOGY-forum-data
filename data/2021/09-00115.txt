Thank you very much to Arlo Griffiths and Birendra Nath Prasad for the relevant additional bibliography, and to Arlo, Elliot Stern and the two other off-list for their proposals of reading of these two dedicatory inscriptions. Summarizing (in bold what appears clear) ?
First inscription: 
			[siddham]* pa-?r?/?c?-ni/ji-ta-ka-?ca/?ca/??ha-m?-ta/dha-ca/va ||
(reading the fifth to tenth character ka??ha m?dhava* appears satisfactory)
Second inscription:
			[siddham] bha/pha-??a/?-vi-n?-ya-ka ||
For the first, the script can be termed as early eastern Nagari from the 10-12th century.
Best wishes,
Christophe
