A?gulim?la
A murderous robber "wearing a necklace of [human] fingers", known from
Buddhist sources.
Question: Apart from Angulimala, is there any mention in ancient Indian
texts of someone wearing a finger necklace?
Is there - perhaps - any mention of someone wearing a measuring tape around
their neck?
