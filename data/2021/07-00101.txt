[INDOLOGY] Help needed to identify numeration system
Dear friends,
I am trying to figure out which numeration system is being used in the 
19th-century ?r?tattvanidhi attributed to K???ar?ja O?ayar III (r. 
1799-1868) of the Kingdom of Mysore.
Dates are read from right to left, with the rightmost numeral given as a 
bh?tasa?khy?, and the three preceding numerals as syllables. The 
syllables largely follow the Ka?apay?di system 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katapayadi_system), but the syllable for 
"7" varies more than the system seems to allow for, e.g.:
gha?achendu: gha (4) + ?a (5) + cha (7) + indu (1) [?aka 1754]
?agha?hendu: ?a (5) + gha (4) + ?ha (7) + indu (1) [?aka 1745]
gha?a?endu: gha (4) + ?a (5) + ?a (7) + indu (1) [?aka 1754]
Can anyone identify the system being used here?
Best regards,
Jacob
