Subject: [INDOLOGY] skrutable for transliteration, scansion, and meter identification
Message-ID: <CADbR+Y_TrELE=L9pmhZ-p0w5g9C2CXCqSQh1mqVurXfMXHufJA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I wrote a month ago mentioning a tool I've been working on, which I said
could be used to analyze the meter of whole texts (the R?m?ya?a, for
example). Fortunately, I was able to give it more time since then, and I'm
pleased to say that it's finally in good shape and ready to be used more
widely.

Access it online here: skrutable.pythonanywhere.com

The web app should hopefully be easy to use, even on mobile devices, and it
also gives point-and-click access to whole-file analysis. Meter
identification was already able to give good detail on such things as
anu??ubh vipul?s and unmetrical p?das, but now it's also able to handle
even more difficult cases like tri??ubh upaj?tis. As a nice bonus, I was
also able to optimize it for speed in a major way, such that where it was
taking 20 minutes to finish the R?m?ya?a before, now it can do it in just
10 or so seconds(!)

I'm hoping that this tool will come in handy not only for research but also
for helping students learn about and enjoy Sanskrit meter. Please do give
it a try and also pass it on. I'm interested to follow up with people on
their experiences with it.

Kind wishes,
Tyler
