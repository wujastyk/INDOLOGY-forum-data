 1)* Nityakarmavidhi*
One of the few examples of Kashmiri sm?rta ritual manuals. It presents, as
its name tells us, the ritual procedure to be followed on a regular daily
basis. It is attributed to the Kashmiri Laug?k?i who is identified with
author of the Laug?k?g?hyas?tra. Compilled by Ke?ava Bha??a, a late 19th
century Kashmiri who published several liturgical works. Amongst the
*stotra*s that constitue the second half is the ?ivastuti, better known as
the Bhairavastava by Abhinavagupta.
2) *Pr?s?dacandrik?*
