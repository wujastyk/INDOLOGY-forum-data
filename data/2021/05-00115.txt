Dear all,
To address Madhav?s question: Sutta is used in Pali suttas to mean the discourses of the Buddha. For instance:
Take a mendicant who says: 
Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu eva? vadeyya: 
?Reverend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: 
?sammukh? meta?, ?vuso, bhagavato suta? sammukh? pa?iggahita?? 
this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher?s instruction.? 
aya? dhammo, aya? vinayo, ida? satthus?sanan?ti. 
You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant?s statement. 
Tassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno bh?sita? neva abhinanditabba? nappa?ikkositabba?. 
Instead, you should carefully memorize those words and phrases, then check if they?re included in the discourses and found in the texts on monastic training. 
Anabhinanditv? appa?ikkositv? t?ni padabya?jan?ni s?dhuka? uggahetv? sutte ot?retabb?ni, vinaye sandassetabb?ni. 
If they?re not included in the discourses and found in the texts on monastic training, you should draw the conclusion: 
T?ni ce sutte ot?riyam?n?ni vinaye sandassiyam?n?ni na ceva sutte otaranti na vinaye sandissanti, ni??hamettha gantabba?: 
?Clearly this is not the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 
?addh? ida? na ceva tassa bhagavato vacana? arahato samm?sambuddhassa; 
It has been incorrectly memorized by that mendicant.? imassa ca bhikkhuno duggahitan?ti. 
And so you should reject it. 
Iti heta?, bhikkhave, cha??eyy?tha. 
(and so on)

Sutta occurs frequently meaning ?thread.?
paripakka? v? kamma? phussa phussa byant?kariss?m?ti heva? natthi do?amite sukhadukkhe pariyantakate sa?s?re, natthi h?yanava??hane, natthi ukka?s?vaka?se. Seyyath?pi n?ma suttagu?e khitte nibbe?hiyam?nameva paleti; evameva b?le ca pa??ite ca nibbe?hiyam?n? sukhadukkha? palent???ti? 
Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there?s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. It?s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering???

Seyyath?pi n?ma suttagu?e khitte nibbe?hiyam?nameva paleti;  evameva b?le ca pa??ite ca sandh?vitv? sa?saritv? dukkhassanta? karissant??ti.
