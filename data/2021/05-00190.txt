Dear Friends,

MW lists

\textbf{mallagha??}    f. a kind of pantomime

as mentioned in the Vikram?rva??yam.

Does an e-text exist? It does not appear on GRETIL.

I have downloaded a pdf of the Sanskrit from archive, though I have no idea
where this term is mentioned. Does someone more familiar with this play
know its location?

I don't know much about this play. Do I correctly presume it is a pantomime
of wrestling?

Thank you.

All the best,

????? ???????
