Dear Friends,
MW lists
\textbf{mallagha??}    f. a kind of pantomime
as mentioned in the Vikram?rva??yam.
Does an e-text exist? It does not appear on GRETIL.
I have downloaded a pdf of the Sanskrit from archive, though I have no idea
where this term is mentioned. Does someone more familiar with this play
know its location?
I don't know much about this play. Do I correctly presume it is a pantomime
of wrestling?
Thank you.
All the best,
????? ???????
