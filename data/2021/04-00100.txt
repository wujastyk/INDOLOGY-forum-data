Thanks.
It is good they are moving ahead with this commentary, which was available
partly few years ago.

Still many mantras are left out for being too clear? for example 1.2.4-6
are left.
I hope they will cover whole rgveda.

This will help us to understand the western perspective which I want to
note in my new commentary on first mandala.

Any other suggestions?
