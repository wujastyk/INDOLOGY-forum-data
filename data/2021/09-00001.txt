Good to hear from you, Madhav,
A check of Mayrhofer?s 1992 and 2001 etymological dictionaries shows that most of the forms with the ?wrong? sibilant are of uncertain or controversial origin; some may be borrowings from other languages or from Prakrit (with hypersanskritization); and only bh?? ?speak? may be inherited (if the explanation that s --> ? to avoid homonymy with bh?s ?shine?. Forms like parya?asvajata obviously result from analogy (based on forms like pari-?vajati). (See details below.)
As for Fortunatov?s Law, I have discussed this in an earlier paper, as well as the assumption thata there was a variety of Vedic that retained the distinction between *r and *l; Mayrhofer further concludes that there is no evidence for such a variety in all of early Indo-Iranian. (See details and references below.)
I also have a discussion of the issue of sa?ak?ra vs. a?ak?ra, where I argue that external-sandhi retroflexion gets degeneralized in the history of Vedic and that it the sandhi (as in RV r?jati ???p) must go back to pre-Rig Vedic. (Again, a reference is found below.)
Mayrhofer?s and my papers contain extensive references to and discussion of earlier literature. Unfortunately, I?m not aware of any more recent detailed discussions of these issues.
All the best,
Hans Henrich
Mayrhofer (to the extent that he has anything in his 1992 and 2001 dictionaries)
??atara: evidently corrupted
kava?a: Uncertain
c???a: No convincing etymology
j?l??a: Uncertain meaning; no etymology provided
ca???la: Perhaps dissimilated from *car???la (see car?/kar?)
v??a?: No etymology given; I have speculated that ritual distortion has affected the form)
bh??-: Controversial. Some derive this from *bhels- (cf. Lith. bal?sas ?voice?) ? Fortunatov?s Law; others think of homonym differentiation from bh?s- ?shine?
m???a: Problematic; compare perhaps MPers./NPers. ma? ?legume?, Shughni max? ?pea, bean?, hence Proto-(Indo-)Iranian *mar??a ?
jha??: Uncertain; probably loanword
?b??sa: Uncertain
k?st?: Loanword (unlikely) or hypersanskritization of *k?rtha > MIAr. kittha, with tth reinterpreted as corresponding to Skt. st.
k?sindha: Uncertain etymology
ka?: a colloqial form of kar?- [i.e. a borrowing from Prakrit?]
kusuma: uncertain
kisalaya: see ki?alaya
bisa: Uncertain; note Pkt. variant bhisa.
Additional comments
None of these forms has a clear, uncontroversial etymology. Even though Mayrhofer tends to rule out borrowing in most cases, such a possibility should not be dismissed (except, probably, for bh??); consider especially the word for ?bean?.
m???a: Could this be one of those Central-Asian substrate words that Lubotsky has talked about? Lubotsky himself classifies it and its Iranian counterparts as a ?wanderwort?.

Hello Hans,
     I have lost track of some of the relevant old publications, but I remember that some of the occurrences of ? in Sanskrit were accounted for by Fortunatov's law regarding the IE l+dental changing to retroflex in Sanskrit, and some others may be what Thomas Burrow called spontaneous retroflexes. Are some of your examples [other than ruki and o?t? > a?t? ?eight?, covered by these theories?
     The other indication to suggest the instability of ?/? is the discussion in the Aitareya-?ra?yaka about whether the RV Sa?hit? was a?ak?ra/a?ak?ra or sa?ak?ra/sa?ak?ra. The ?ra?yaka says that the M????keya version of the RV was sa?ak?ra/sa?ak?ra, and that ??kalya followed M????keya in this respect. But the discussion itself indicates that there may have been other reciters whose Sa?hit? was a?ak?ra/a?ak?ra.

Dear Colleague,
Even as early as the Rig Veda there is evidence, both for ? occurring after a-vowels and for s occurring after i- and u-vowels. See the evidence further below.
What made the distribution of s and ? unpredictable is the fact that Proto-Indo-Iranian ?, the source of Skt. ? is of two sources. One if the development of earlier s to ? after ?RUKI? (i.e. r-sounds, u-sounds, velars, and i-sounds; in the case of the vocalic sounds, both syllabic and nonsyllabic); the other was the development of PIE *? to ? before obstruent. Examples are nis- > ni? ?down? and o?t? > a?t? ?eight?.
As the second example shows, the second of these changes introduced ? after a-vowels and thus made the RUKI outcome of s opaque and hence contrastive (consider e.g. Skt. asta- ?thrown? beside a???(u) ?8?, with s and ? contrasting after a-vowel.
This contrastiveness, in turn, made it possible for analogical processes to extend ? into contexts after a-vowels (as in pary-a-?asvajat) as well as for borrowings and the like with ? after a-vowels and s after ?RUKI? to be adopted without further adjustment.
