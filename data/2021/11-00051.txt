Dear Fran?ois. 
At V?lm?kir?m?ya?a (criticism. ed.) 3.13.10 ff. Ja??yus tells R?ma the history of Dak?a?s sixty (not fifty or sixteen)  daughters. Eight of  them, who become the wives of Ka?yapa are named   and, Ja??yus says that they became, respectively, the mothers of various gods and daityas as well as various species of animals.
