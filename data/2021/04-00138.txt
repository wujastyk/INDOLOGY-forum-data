There's a glitch in registrations, I'm afraid.  I'm talking to Eventleaf
about this right now, and hope to have it solved shortly.  But in the
meantime, the Webinar link and agenda are both on the front page of
the symposium
website <http://eventleaf.com/GreaterMagadha>, so registration isn't
essential.
I apologize for the difficulties!
Best,
Dominik
