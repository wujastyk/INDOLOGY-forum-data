Dear Indologists,
I apologize for the length of the following post dealing with Tamil philology, epigraphy, and critical editions. Those, who are not interested in these, please delete this post and move on. I am writing this post in order to seek some relevant information.
Before publication of Early Tamil Epigraphy (ETE), in 2001 I had a chance to read a portion of the manuscript and gave my comments to Mr. Iravatham Mahadevan. In connection with the inscription from Pa?aiya?pa??u in which the place name p????u in its oblique form p?????u occurred, I pointed out to Mahadevan the occurrence of the same word in Akan????u 155 and the occurrences of p???? nal n???u in Akan????u 113 and 325. I have attached page 629 from ETE, where he writes what he learnt further regarding Akan????u 155. 
Mahadevan mentions that R. Raghava Iyengar?s edition as well as the edition by N. M. V??ka?ac?mi N????r and R. V??k??calam Pillai gave the reading as p????tu in Akan????u 155. The so-called R. Raghavaiyangar edition is actually the work of R. Raghavaiyangar as well as Ve. Ir?jak?p?laiya?k?r alias V?. Ir?jak?p?la? alias Ir?jak?p?l?rya? with some input from Mu. Ir?kavaiya?k?r. Wilden in her introduction to the critical edition of Akan????u Part 1, says, ?With a few variations (most of which are printing mistakes), it [the edition by N????r and Pi??ai] reproduces the text? established by R. Raghavaiyangar / Ir?jak?p?la?, the 1933 edition, and gives a number of (but not all) variants (Wilden 2018, xiv ? xvi). Wilden also notes that the 1973 edition by P. V. C?macuntara??r does not materially differ from the one by N????r and Pi??ai. So, it is not surprising that p????u is the word used in the edition by N????r and Pi??ai.
