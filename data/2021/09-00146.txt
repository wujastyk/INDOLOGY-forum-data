Dear Joanna,
I apologise if my response sounded overly critical.
You described how you teach pronunciation, and that approach seemed to
imply, to me, that you were aiming for specific phonetic traits far beyond
anything that I assumed we could know about Sanskrit (as you say, your
method is painstaking!). Hence my query.
To answer your question: I don't spend a lot of time at all on
pronunciation in my intro classes: when we go through the alphabet, I say
'this sound is like sound x in [language of instruction]', using whatever
is closest; with only few exceptions (such as retroflex stops) this works
quite well teaching in English or German.
I focus on phonemic contrasts and thus teach them to make a difference
between, say, th and t, but don't ever mind if their t's aren't fully
unaspirated. I am absolutely fine when my German- or English-speaking
students pronounce what I suppose we assume were purely dental stops as
alveolars, or when I get English l's or German r's; and I certainly don't
expect anyone to voice their h's (the latter, I fully admit, also because I
myself struggle with that one:-)).
Of course it is important to be able to vocalise the language you are
learning, and so I tell them to aim for consistency; but given the lack of
phonetic information (and, I assume, the lack of a unified pronunciation
across time and space) the explicit goal in my classes simply is
approximation.
I hope this is useful - and again apologies that I didn't simply ask 'why
do you do what you do?' in the first place!
All my best,
     Antonia
