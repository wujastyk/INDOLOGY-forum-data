[INDOLOGY] Chaos in Indian mythology and philosophy
Just working from memory, I think you might find something relevant in the
following article by Harry Falk:
2009. ?Greek Style Dedications to an Indian God in Gandhara.? *Indo?Asiatische
Zeitschrift* 13: 25?42.
I seem to recall that he posits an identification of "Chaos" in a bilingual
(Greek/Gandhari) inscription with Bhava = S'iva - or something along those
lines.
