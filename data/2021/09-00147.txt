Hi Joanna,
     My mother-tongue is Marathi and I studied Sanskrit in Pune. Marathi
does have the retroflex consonants of Sanskrit, except that the contrast of
?/? is not clear for most speakers. In Marathi, r? is typically pronounced
as ru, unlike ri in north India, and the combination j?a is typically
pronounced as dnya. So, while teaching my students, I am able to
personally demonstrate how the retroflex consonants are pronounced and
gradually guide my students to that pronunciation. For my Sanskrit class, I
insist on pronouncing j?a as a combination of j+?, rather than as dnya in
Marathi or like gya in the Hindi area. For r?, I am generally following the
Marathi ru, because I have no idea how that r? was pronounced in ancient
times. I also try to make the distinction between ?/? clear. It is pretty
much lost in Marathi, but a few Sanskrit scholars in Pune
conscientiously used to make that distinction in their pronunciation, and I
am following that. That is just about what I can say regarding my own
teaching. Best,
Madhav
