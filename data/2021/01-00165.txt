=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_names_of_devan=C4=81gar=C4=AB_penstrokes?=
Dear Matthew,
I believe that the short answer is that there is still no in-depth study of the terminology you mention which is based on sources that precedes the introduction of print. I am working precisely on a study of Sanskrit terminology in early print and if you want, I can tell you more off list. (Incidentally, I would consider reph? as a term rather defining the sound and only by extension used to define the written sign for ra.)
Best wishes,
