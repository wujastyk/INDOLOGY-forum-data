About FreeFonts, they have many merits, but there are technical problems
too.  See

There was a fix for the conjunct problem that Norbert Preining worked out,
but it stopped working in 2017.  I haven't checked back since 2017.
The official distribution directory for GNU Freefont
<http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/freefont/?C=M;O=D> shows the latest edit was in
2012. Back in about 2014, I corresponded with the author, Stevan White, and
he was aware of the problems but didn't have the resources of time to do
major new work on the fonts
