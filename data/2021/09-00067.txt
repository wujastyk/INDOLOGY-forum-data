[INDOLOGY] D. D. Kosambi and Indian Royal Genealogies
Dear Indologists,
I remember posting in Indology several years ago a quote by D. D. Kosambi about invented royal genealogies. Unfortunately, I have lost the reference. Indology archives is not searchable. Does anyone remember the quote and reference? 
Thank you very much.
Regards,
Palaniappan
