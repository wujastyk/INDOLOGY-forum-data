Dear Dmitry,

In addition to the excellent suggestions already given, you might also look into the concept of adharma. To the extent that dharma comes to take over the meaning of the Vedic ?ta, or cosmic order, adharma would suggest its opposite (and would fit well with some of the things already mentioned by others, such as the admixture of var?as in the Kali Yuga).

All the best,
Jeff
