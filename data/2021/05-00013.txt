Dear list members,
I am curious about the *Lav-Ku? K???* that appears in some editions of
the *R?mcaritm?nas
*(e.g., I have personally seen it in the 1969 ?ik?? Granth?g?r edition and
in R.C. Prasad's translation done through Motilal Banarsidass; I'm sure
there are others).  The history of this curious part of the text has so far
eluded me and I'm hoping that this list can steer me in the right
direction.  I would be grateful for any suggestions on how to find out more
about this section's relationship to the larger text.
Best wishes,
Aaron
