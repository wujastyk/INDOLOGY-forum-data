[INDOLOGY] Re: request re Benfey
Thanks, Tim #2.? I had found it in Hathi in the meantime, but it is even 
nicer to have it downloaded.
I am well, thank you. I got my first Pfizer vaccine shot this week. Your 
lecture here at Penn was my last outing before the pandemic struck. It 
feels like a decade ago.
Keep well,
Rosane
