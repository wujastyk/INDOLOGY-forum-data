 Dear Shaman,
thanks for pointing out this.
I attached other two picture.
I hypothesised the picture (6476) represents the goddess Sarvatomukhi (who
is sculpted also on the torana (6315) placed at the enter of the
complex---that is around 1-2 kms away from the temple complex) but I am not
sure at all.
Best,
Paolo
