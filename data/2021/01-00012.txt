"*Computational
Sanskrit and Digital Humanities NEW SUBMISSION*" in the subject line.
It is possible that some of you who have already submitted your manuscript
may have advanced your work further and would like to revise your
submission. If you would like to do this please email your submission
to: *sanskrit at kaigi.com.au
