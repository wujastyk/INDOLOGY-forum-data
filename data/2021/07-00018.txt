[INDOLOGY] Query
A colleague in India has a question to which I did not know the unwire. So I am turning to you.
The question is:
I was going through the portions of Garuda Purana which mention hells and after life, especially where it is mentioned that humans or sinners will be reborn as animals, birds and insects. I was wondering if someone has worked on the ecological and socio-zoological aspect of these punitive injunctions. If yes can you suggest a reading list.
Thanks for any help.
