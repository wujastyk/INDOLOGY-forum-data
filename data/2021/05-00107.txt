If I remember, the term *sutta *is found in a passage describing the views
of one of the ?j?vikas (*suttagul?e khitte*), where it clearly refers to a
thread. Is the term *sutta *as a kind of text found anywhere other than in
the titles of texts? In other words, does the word *sutta *as a kind of
text belong to the oldest stratum of Pali, or is it only a sort of
editorial usage?
