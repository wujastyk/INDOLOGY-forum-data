Dear Friends:
It is with much sadness (but also many sweet memories!) that I report to
all of you that our beloved colleague and friend Tom Hopkins gently passed
away this morning in his asleep at the age of ninety-one. A couple of
months ago, Tom suffered a stroke, but appeared to be recovering quite
steadily and well from it, so his departure today comes unexpectedly.
Tom was born on July 28th, 1930 in Champaign, Illinois. He was married to
Fran (Skinner) Hopkins on December 22, 1956. Together they had four
children, five grandchildren, and even four great-grandchildren. He will be
very missed by all of them.
Tom's colorful educational background can be spelled out as follows: Tom
earned his B.S. in Physics in 1953, and went on to MIT earned a B.S. in
Mechanical Engineering in the same year. He then went on to Yale Divinity
School to earn his B.D. in Religion and Culture, and then completed the
M.A. in 1959 and the Ph.D. in 1962 in Comparative Religion from Yale
University Gradue School. His unpublished dissertaion is entitled, *The
Vaishnava Bhakti Movement in the Bh?gavata Pur??a. *
