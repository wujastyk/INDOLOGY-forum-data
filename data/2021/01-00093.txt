[INDOLOGY] Sunil Kumar
Just read on Indian Express that Prof. Sunil Kumar, the Chair of History at Delhi University, passed away due to COPD complications (not Covid). I did not know him well, but interacted with him when I published a paper in  Indian Economic and Social History Review, and gave a talk in his department a couple of years ago. He was a very friendly person, and a fine medieval historian; did his doctoral work at Duke.
