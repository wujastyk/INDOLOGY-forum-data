Dear Jim and others,
I apologize for sending out such technical passages without further
annotation or clarification. Please find a translation of the Prak??a
passage here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XElrRPzJbP4PnnLdZqXFu4fWh0GcNd8_b5pojWwPz2o/edit?usp=sharing
I'm afraid I dashed this off in a bit of a rush so there might be (very
probably are) errors. According to K???a, P??ini is a yuvan form, i.e., a
great grandson of Pa?in with at least one surviving male ancestor in the
immediate line of descent going back to Pa?in. Pa?in is a name
meaning possessing pa?a, which is equivalent to stuti as Gary rightly
pointed out. K???a rejects the possibility that pa?a could be
something like measurement (parim??a) on the basis of  P. 3.3.66, by which
we also form m?lakapa?a "fist full of radishes", but notes that others do
accept it. I think the fist full of radishes for trade is sort of a
humorous way to allude to and reject the other meaning of pa?, vyavah?ra.
The final bit where he refutes Vi??hala requires more annotation.
All the Best,
Victor
