Dear Dominik:

With the increased charges for hosting Indology, will you be able to set up a place where members can contribute to the expenses? I know a while back there was a discussion on this issue. It is so unfair that you or a small group have to shoulder the financial burden. Thanks.

Patrick

Dear friends,

The INDOLOGY mail forum runs on a piece of software called Mailman.  Our installation was recently upgraded from version 2 to version 3<https://docs.mailman3.org/projects/mailman/en/latest/src/mailman/docs/NEWS.html>.    At the same time, our service provider has changed the interfaces for registering and controlling our accounts and for consulting the archive.

The links on the main indology website, INDOLOGY.info<http://indology.info/> were updated several days ago; if you find any errors there, please inform the INDOLOGY committee<mailto:indology-owner at list.indology.info>.

The new interface for managing your account is here:

  *   https://list.indology.info/list/indology.list.indology.info

The software interface is called "Affinity."  Your INDOLOGY subscription will work as always without taking any action.  But if you would like to change the settings of your subscription, you need to "register."  The procedure is simple and self-evident.

The new interface for the INDOLOGY Archive is now here:

  *   https://list.indology.info/empathy

The software is called "Empathy."  As before, the archive is open to the public.

Please let the committee<mailto:indology-owner at list.indology.info> (not me!) know if you discover any bugs.

Best wishes,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY list<http://indology.info/> committee member
