[INDOLOGY] date of death of Narendanath Law
Friends, according to all sources I have found Narendranath Law was born in
1889. I strongly suspect that he is no longer alive (although if he is,
well, felicitations!), and yet I am unable to find a date of death. Does
anyone know? And if so, where did you find it?
Many thanks in advance,
Jonathan
