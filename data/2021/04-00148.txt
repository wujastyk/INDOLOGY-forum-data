Hi Madhav and Camillo,
We do record the lectures and will begin posting them to the UGent
Youtube channel after the end of the series. However, sometimes the
lectures are of research in progress and thus the presenters have the
option of keeping the recording of their talk from being shared
publicly outright, or may opt to select some later date to make it
available after their findings have been published. I'm not sure what
Serena will select in this case.
All my best,
Charles
