Dear Suchandra,
the manuscript of Jinad?sa's commentary on the Niryukti ( i. e. the 
c?r?i, 2vols.) you find at
https://jainelibrary.org/list-search/
and search for
Aavashyak_Sutram_Purv_Bhag
Aavashyak_Sutram_Uttar_Bhag
The part which deals with the namokk?ra-prayer (Namask?ra-niryukti: vol. 
1) includes many stories. These stories I have translated into German 
some decades ago, An English revision of my doctoral thesis I have sent 
to the L.D. Institute in Ahmedabad about 25 years ago. The plans for 
publishing it in India were never realized.
Best
Heiner
