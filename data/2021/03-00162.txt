After an eighteenth-month valiant battle with pancreatic cancer, Agnes 
Stache-Weiske passed away peacefully at home this morning, as she 
wished, surrounded by the love of her children and of her many friends. 
We have lost a great scholar, a model collaborator, and a wonderful 
friend. Her memory and her example will live with us.
