[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit outside universities
Dear List,
Sanskrit instruction (and instruction in the humanities in general) is
being cut at many universities, while at the same time 'real-world'
interest in these topics is on the rise. Hence I thought it might be useful
to get an overview of the existing 'alt-ac' institutions out there.
So far I am aware of
(Full disclosure: I teach the Introductory Sanskrit courses offered by
Yogic Studies, and will be involved in the higher-level Sanskrit literature
courses.)
I would be grateful for replies to this post
courses at a properly scholarly level, taught by academics, but not limited
to students enrolled at one specific college or university)
department, interested in expanding the educational offerings available to
their students by working together with such an alt-ac institution (the
Yogic Studies three-term Introductory Sanskrit sequence, for example, is
basically the same as the two-semester introduction I used to teach at
Cornell; and Yogic Studies is beginning to build up co-operations with
colleges/universities)
I will happily send a summary of such offerings/institutions to the List.
Thank you, and all the best,
     Antonia
