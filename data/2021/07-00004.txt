Dear list members,
in support of Patrick McAllisters point, in particular the second aspect 
strikes me worthwhile exploring in connection with modality: the 
Dharmakirtian (and post-Dharmakirtian) notion of "incompatibility" 
(virodha), of which two types are distinguished:
(1) a factual incompatibility which means that two spatio-temporally 
bound real entities cannot coexist in the same environment (like hot and 
cold temperature), insofar as the presence of the one invariably 
destroys the other one. This is referred to as 
sah?navasth?na(lak?a?a)virodha).
(2) a conceptual incompatibility that broadly speaking corresponds to 
Aristotelian contradiction or contrariety between two predicates (there 
is a divergence of viewpoints in the Buddhist logical tradition whether 
contrariety or mere "difference" is really a type of virodha or not). 
Both the stronger and the weaker version of this relationship are 
subject to the principle that the determination (pariccheda) of the one 
amounts to the exclusion (vyavaccheda) of the other, but only the 
stronger version -- obtaining between a predicate and its negation, like 
"blue" and "non-blue" -- is subject to the principle that also the 
exclusion of the one amounts to the determination of the other. The 
weaker version, by the way, would be exemplified by "blue" and "yellow". 
This type of incompatibility is referred to as 
parasparaparih?rasthiti(or sthita-)lak?a?avirodha.
The elaboration of (1) leads to discussions relating to the theory of 
universal momentariness (the problem being that real entities, when 
analyzed as momentary phases, are after all not destroyed by external 
agents; they "self-destruct", so this kind of factual incompatibility 
has to be analyzed on the level of series (sant?na)). But it is in the 
elaboration of (2) where one may gain further insights into thinking 
about logical impossibility.
With best regards,
