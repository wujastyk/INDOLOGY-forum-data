Dear Jim,
I've pasted below two derivations given in commentaries to the
Prakriy?kaumud? or R?macandra; the first is by Vi??hala in his Pras?da (p.
3 of the first volume) and the second (spanning two portions) is by
K???a ?e?a in his Prak??a (pp. 8ff. of the first volume). The former text
can be downloaded here

The latter, here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NysQ-LteMaqetcAjSKp3QnnxbxOLyLYU?usp=sharing>.
Hope that's helpful.
All the Best,
Victor
