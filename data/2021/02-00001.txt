[INDOLOGY] PDF request (VOHD Band 2 Teil 19)
Thanks, Mrinal and Christopher, for your responses. Yeah, it's
disappointing that this site doesn't have the 19th part but they have the
20th part.
I am looking for the manuscripts of a K?tantra commentary *B?labodhin?. *There
are 13 manuscripts listed in the other volumes of the Janert's collection
(parts 15-19). I think at least one more manuscript of the B?labodhin?
(Serial no. 7288) is listed in the 19th part.
