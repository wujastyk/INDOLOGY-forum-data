[INDOLOGY] Esoteric Buddhism in Central Asia
Dear All,
I wish you all are safe and well during this endless global pandemic.
Anyone can point out a few articles on Esoteric Buddhism in connection with
Silk Road's sites and particularly with Eastern centres (such as Dunhuang).
I am very interested in articles based on iconographic developments (from
the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia).
Best wishes,
Paolo
