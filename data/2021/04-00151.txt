Subject: [INDOLOGY] Esoteric Buddhism in Central Asia
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf-oyAiY-SeF=c_e19Aahq2mn=v7mZ3NFHfbSa78vTCkTA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I wish you all are safe and well during this endless global pandemic.
Anyone can point out a few articles on Esoteric Buddhism in connection with
Silk Road's sites and particularly with Eastern centres (such as Dunhuang).
I am very interested in articles based on iconographic developments (from
the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia).

Best wishes,
Paolo
