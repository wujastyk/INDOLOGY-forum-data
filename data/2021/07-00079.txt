[INDOLOGY] Velthuis nagari font for linux
Dear Adriano,
Fonts are not specific to operating systems.? I have moved from MacOS to 
Linux to BSD over the course of the past 15 years, and I have never had 
a font that worked on one not work on another operating system.
I hope that helps,
Michael Slouber
