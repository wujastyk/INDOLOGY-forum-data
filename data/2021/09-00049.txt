Hello Jan,
     Your circumstantial inference about the commercial background of
P??ini may be close to reality, and yet I don't see any awareness of it
among the grammarians from K?ty?yana to N?ge?a, and so I would not suspect
any deliberate effort to hide this background. Historically, Brahmins have
been engaged in various occupations including commercial, political,
administrative and agricultural. However, the theoretical role of the
Brahmin is always seen in his "Brahmanical" activities.
