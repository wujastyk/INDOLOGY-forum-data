[INDOLOGY] Two questions on epigraphy
Dear Indologists,
I would like to know 
 the difference in geographic extent indicated by terms such as r???ra, vi?aya, ma??ala, etc. 
The earliest datable inscription/s where dynasties claim solar, lunar, or mythical lineages
Thank you in advance for any information.
Regards,
Palaniappan
