Dear Prof. Deshpande, dear All,
Thanks for all the replies.
The context is the one described in my query about the clothing item called
n?vi/n?v? (
https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/2021-August/055095.html). I
am sorry for not clarifying this. I had found the word
dhudhurik?/ghughurik? next to the word n?v? in a manuscript from Rajasthan
and was wondering what it means (I guess it could be a gloss for n?v?) and
in which language.
All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
