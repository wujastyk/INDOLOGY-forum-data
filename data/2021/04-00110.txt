Dear colleagues.
Please forgive me for sharing my two pennies with you, above all because I'm not a Vedic scholar. However, the discussion about Western vs Indian Indology goes well beyond the boundaries of Vedic studies, as we all know -- unluckily, if I may say so.
In my modest opinion, nominal arguments based on analysis of labels in -isation (or -ization, if your prefer the American spelling, apparently the West is not a monolithic entity even in terms of English grammar), are merely vitaNDa -- but again, I might be wrong. Let's start from a materialistic approach instead and see who in fact represents the two points of view and, even more importantly, for which economic, political, and social reasons are doing so. Only then this discussion will be fruitful, otherwise we will be beating around the bush. If you think that this list is not the right place for this kind of discussion, I perfectly agree with you and you can let this message be the last one of this thread.
Best wishes,
Camillo
P.S. As to labels, please feel free to infer what is my materialistic stance based the analysis of the economic, political, and social relationships in a given historical period of a given society -- if you so wish.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Rgveda complete study material and reverse word index
If "Indian" includes "Indianized westerners"' and "western" includes "westernized Indian " then it shows that this classification is not based on the place of origin of the researcher/scholar but is based on -ization, a certain approach to the material studied.
The category 'western' as a label for a certain worldview , a certain approach to understanding things has been used widely in the academic studies world over.
If there are two approaches to issues they being purvapaksha to each other is good for the health of academic studies.
Readers too get excited to follow the debate.

Dear Dominik,
     I entirely agree with you. In some quarters there is a tendency to consider everything "western" to be a P?rvapak?a, with an implication that a Siddh?nta can come only from what can be labeled "Indian." This "Indian" does not include "westernized Indian" but often includes "Indianized westerners." Such labels already distance a reader from the content of a given argument, and they have to first take sides based on the labels attached to arguments. Such is the sociopolitical reality of academics.

Is there such a thing as a western perspective on the RV?  What might be the demarcation criteria for such a taxonomy?  And if such a category could be delineated, would it be desirable or fruitful to do so?  In my view, the category "western" or "the West" is best avoided because it is so deeply flawed, conceptually, that whatever you say it is, there are ten counter-examples.  The most obvious of which being that Japan, where much Vedic research is conducted, is east of India.
I prefer to proceed on the basis that all serious scholars are united in their pursuit of truth, wherever their desks may happen to be located.
Best,

Thanks.
It is good they are moving ahead with this commentary, which was available partly few years ago.
Still many mantras are left out for being too clear? for example 1.2.4-6 are left.
I hope they will cover whole rgveda.
This will help us to understand the western perspective which I want to note in my new commentary on first mandala.
Any other suggestions?
