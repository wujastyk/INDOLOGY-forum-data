Dear Harry,

 

Thank you.

 

Just compare the browse feature for the months of January 2021 and October 2012.

 

The October 2012 results shows individual posts, which you can cite.

The January 2021 results show threads which include posts in February or later too.

https://list.indology.info/empathy/list/indology.list.indology.info?sort_by=date_desc&month=2021-1

 

The search function works only on single words and Boolean search is not possible.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan

Dear Sudalaimuthu,

 

Like you I find the Indology list archives invaluable and I ran into problems.

There was a bug in the browse by month feature (it only displayed the first 25 entries correctly  ) but that seems to be fixed now, so I'm OK with the new archives browse feature now that I'm used to it.  

 

I prefer the new archives "search" function.  I found with the original archives "search" function, the same post was displayed multiple times. But I would have liked something like the google groups search function, where you can filter searchs by poster, date, contents or if it has an attachment.

The earlier Indology archive and its browse and search functions worked very well. The new Indology archive and its search function have created a terrible problem where none existed. It is hard to search and hone in on specific posts to cite them. The Indology archive was a very valuable knowledge database. But, it is terrible to use right now. Is it just me or do other members have run into problems too? If yes, can we go back to the earlier system a la the Coca Cola experience?

 

Thank you.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan
