Dear Alakendu Das,

The Tattva-bodha is traditionally thought to have been written by
Shankaracharya. The story is that he wrote it for his mother shortly before
she died. So he put the Advaita Vedanta teachings in the simplest possible
form. Even today it is regarded as a sort of Advaita Vedanta catechism.

Best regards,
