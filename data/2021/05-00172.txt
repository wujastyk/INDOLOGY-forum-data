Dear Jim!

It seems to be possible that the ku?cik? might be either a massive key, as Matthew suggested, or perhaps even rather a kind of special stick. Some details on Indian keys and locks can be found in:

Oskar v. Hin?ber: Sprachentwicklung und Kulturgeschichte. Ein Beitrag zur materiellen Kultur des buddhistischen Klosterwesens. Stuttgart: Steiner (Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur. Geistes- und Sozialwiss. Klasse. Jg. 1992, Nr. 6)., esp. pp. 14??24, 30??34.

Best wishes,
Sven

Maybe my imagination is too influenced by images of huge Tibetan locks and keys that served also as lethal weapons. Might not some old Indian locks be preserved in one or another of the palace museums?

> My incomplete translation is as follows: ?The yogi should use Ku??alin? to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a ku?cik? to force open a kap??a.? I had been translating ku?cik? as ?key? and kap??a as ?door?, but this isn?t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this ku?cik? and kap??a might be. I am aware that a kap??a is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the ku?cik?? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.
