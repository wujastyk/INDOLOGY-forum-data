Dear Antonia,
I don?t think anyone has mentioned yet the mnemonic for remembering the
names of the 3-syllable ga?as for the analysis of meters:
*yam?t?r?jabh?nasalaga?* (or I?ve also seen *yam?t?r?jabh?nasalag?*). Thus,
?ya? is the name for a light-heavy-heavy triad, ?ma? for heavy-heavy-heavy,
and so on. I?ve always found it very useful, and my students have too.
Best wishes,
Hamsa
