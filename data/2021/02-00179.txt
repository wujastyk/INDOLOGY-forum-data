[INDOLOGY] Problems with new Indology archives
Dear list members,
When I search the new Indology archives by month I get weird results.  For
example I've just tried to search the archives for October 2004 sorted by
most recent.  The results I get are the threads for Oct 2004 only from Oct.
26 to the end of the month.  These are preceeded by threads from Feb. 2021
not by earlier threads from Oct. 2004.
