[INDOLOGY] deva+nagari
Dear Friends,
Might anyone be able to pinpoint the general/specific period/text when the
n?gar? lipi is divinised and qualified as devan?gar??
The dates of 1st to 4th c. CE for its development and standard usage by the
7th c., with the modern lipi emerging in the 10th c. are reasonably clear.
Though, I find it difficult to pinpoint more accurately when the lipi
becomes a deva.
Are there any discussions of this in primary texts? Some sort of
orthographic argument? If you catch my sense.
Thank you.
All the best,
????? ???????
