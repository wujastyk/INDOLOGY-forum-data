Dear Christophe,
Happy to see your msg after a long time. Hope you are doing well.
Yes, I went through this small inscription below the statue of Vishnu. 
My reading goes as follows:
first character (stroke) - ru > ?? 
second: pa > ? 
third: ;srii > ???? 
fourth: ji > ??  (some rubbing is there later which gives an impression of na-ni > ? - ??  )
fifth: ta > ? 
sixth: ka > ? 
seventh: .n.tha > ???  
eight: maa > ?? 
ninth: dha > ?  (see Rath 2011, page 196 5.1, line 3 dharmmo..)
tenth: va > ?
Whole line: (ru?)pa ;sriijitaka.n.tha maadhava> ?????????????????? 
fifth to tenth character : confirmed reading (no doubt at all)
Script: Early eastern Nagari variety
I have seen that you have put this in Indology list, also saw the comments.
Sorry to say that the scholars have given more confusing statement and wrong readings.
Hope my reading could help you in some extent.
Warm regards,
Saraju
