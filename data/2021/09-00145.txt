Well, I was somehow misunderstood. I am not going to reconstruct or teach
the original Sanskrit pronunciation. I have explained that the formulation
"native Sanskrit speakers" was unfortunate.
But we all teach Sanskrit, don't we? And we have to explain to our students
how to pronounce e.g. cerebral consonants. Do they exist or not? If they
do, I think that the website mentioned by Adheesh could also be very useful
 in teaching Sanskrit phonetics. That's all.
I would be rather interested in how you teach Sanskrit phonetics in
practice? I have described how I do that. Do you have the same painstaking
methods?
Best wishes,
Joanna
