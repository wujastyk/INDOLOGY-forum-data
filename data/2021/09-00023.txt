[INDOLOGY] new book announcement
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to be able to announce that two more articles of ours 
(one each) have just been published in a volume resulting from a 
conference on /R?m?ya?a/ retellings in South India and Southeast Asia in 
September 2017.? Attached is a flyer we received which gives basic 
information about the book.
With all good wishes
John and Mary
