Dear Luther,
thank you!
This first campaign of the petition only serves to make clear to the Senate
meeting on Wednesday the resistance that the university and the state
government would have to reckon with if the rectorate's decision were to be
implemented. Perhaps the plan for this sacrilege in the humanities will
fail already at this early stage. That would settle the matter. Only if it
does not, other measures would have to be taken and the Ministry of Culture
would have to be approached directly. In this case, I will gladly turn to
the list for appropriate support.
Warm wishes,
Walter
