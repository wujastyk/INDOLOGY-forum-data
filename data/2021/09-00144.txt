No historically authentic Sanskrit pronunciation has survived in India
today, because no modern Indian language preserves all Sanskrit sounds.
However, there are regional standards of Sanskrit pronunciation, which may
be described in terms like the Pune pronunciation, Banaras pronunciation,
Mysore pronunciation etc. Sanskrit scholars in these different regions
generally follow that regional standard. Reciters of the same Veda from
different regions also have their regional standards. The Yajurveda recited
in Maharashtra sounds different from the Yajurveda recited in south India.
This is to be expected given the diverse linguistic history of India that
has left its marks also on the pronunciation of Sanskrit. Even works like
R?ja?ekhara's K?vyam?m??s? give details of the regional peculiarities of
Sanskrit pronunciation and recitation of Sanskrit poetry.
