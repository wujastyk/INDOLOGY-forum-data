Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit mnemonics?
Message-ID: <CAEjEOsB0js6-XxGOq_S7NDrSZc6v5+BgnrKWeXZ3zpCk8xu3ag@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Whenever I've learnt a language in a classroom setting, we'd get mnemonics
to help us remember word forms or uses. (I am thinking of things like
'after si, nisi, num, ne, all the ali's fly away', or 'If one shwa by
another is hounded, the first is silent, the second sounded.')

Do any of you have any such mnemonics (no matter how silly - or dare I say:
the sillier, the better?) for Sanskrit? So far I only have minuscule things
like reminding students of Har*e* K???a (for the vocative of i-stems), and
also verses like

gurureva gatirgurumeva bhaje guru?aiva sah?smi namo gurave |
na guro? parama? ?i?urasmi gurormatirastu gurau mama p?hi guro ||

If you have anything you use that works well with your students, I'd be
grateful if you were willing to share it. I'll happily sum up everything I
get in an email to the List.

Many thanks, as always,
    Antonia
