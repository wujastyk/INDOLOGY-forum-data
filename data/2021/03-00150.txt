For what it's worth, the Tibetan regent Sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, in his Cha tshad dpe ris of about 1687 (reproduced in "Handbook of Tibetan Iconometry" Brill 2012), lists five of the Indic scripts he gives there (nos. 9, 10, 11, 12 on plates  257-8 and 14 on 264) as NAgari, but with no "deva."  In his Tibetan gloss on the term, he simply calls it "town writing" (grong khyer gyi yi ge). Hodgson, in his 1828 "Notices of the Languages, Literature, and Religion of the Bauddhas...." reproduces a Tibetan manuscript, the model for which I estimate to date to ca. 1700, that similarly uses just NAgari, though Hodgson in his English descriptions gives Deva-n... , no doubt reflecting what was by that time accepted usage among European Indologists. (Our colleague Dragomir Dimitrov also examines these and related materials in his recent, excellent monograph The Buddhist Indus Scripts and Scriptures [Harrassowitz 2020], although I do not believe the question of deva+ is among those that occupy him there.)

Dear Patrick,

I too was wondering about this a while back, and received the following two references from Professor Oskar von Hin??ber, which I pass on to the list because they may be of more general interest:


J. F. Blumhardt: Catalogue of the Gujarati and Rajasthani Manuscripts in the India Office Library. London1954, S.6 on the name devanagari. (https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001173373)

Walter H. Maurer: On the name devan??gar?? , JAOS 96.1976, S. 101-104 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/599893)
