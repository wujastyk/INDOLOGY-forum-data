[INDOLOGY] Orissa Historical Research Journal
Dear colleagues,
I am looking for the following article:
K. Krishna Murthy: "Dice Play and its Archaeological Corroboration at 
Nagarjunakonda" in Orissa Historical Research Journal no. 10, 1961, pp. 
1-4.
Archive.org does not have the issue I am looking for, and while the 
Odisha State Archives have an image of the front page 
(http://odishaarchives.nic.in/node/165946) there are no download 
options.
If anybody on the list has a scan of the article or issue I am looking 
for, or know which portal to access the journal from (the Royal Library 
of Copenhagen does not), I would be most grateful.
Best regards,
Jacob
