[INDOLOGY] Map of Madras Presidency
References: <0DE01FFC-E3DA-4AE0-9EE8-442661A85CA0.ref@aol.com>
Dear Indologists,
I need a digital map of the Madras Presidency ca. 1910 without copyright restrictions (or with easy-to-obtain permission to use) for inclusion in a paper. I would appreciate any help from the list members. 
Also, I am in the processing of mapping the locations of some inscriptions in South India. Do you know of any mapping software that could be helpful for this purpose?
Thank you in advance.
Regards,
Palaniappan
