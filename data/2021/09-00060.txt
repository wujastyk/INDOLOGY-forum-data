Dear Professor Tieken,
I see at least two sides to your query:
1. The ?word' ?ka??uvicci?  for soothsayer in Tamil literature.
2. The (soothsaying) 'character? in ca?kam (Sangam) poetry.
++++++++++
Regarding #1 above ? 
You are correct. The word ?ka??uvicci? for a soothsayer in Tamil literature does not appear until in the Vaishnava texts. 
However the concept of soothsaying is expressed in earlier texts such as the Tolkappiyam, where the soothsaying is referred to as ?ka??u.?
I think it is also mentioned in the Cilappathikaram or Manimekalai, I forget. 
Regarding #2 above ? 
///Apparently, the character is absent in Ca?kam poetry./// 
The soothsaying character is very much present in ca?kam poetry. She is referred to as ?akava? maka?.?  Please see kuruntokai 23.

For a very good Index in Tamil, if you haven?t already, you can browse and rely on Dr. Pandiyaraja?s Sangam Concordance: http://tamilconcordance.in/concordance_list-B.html <http://tamilconcordance.in/concordance_list-B.html>
