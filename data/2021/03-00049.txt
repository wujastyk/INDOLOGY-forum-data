Thank you, Matthew, Peter and Ryan, for your suggestions. The geographic web site is quite addictive and a useful resource! Thanks for that.

Ryan, your pointers are also helpful. Do you have any indications that others in that region also identified as S??mit?yas? In addition to saying his parents were brahmins (suggesting a brahmanic upbringing which might be why his Sanskrit was so impressive), he also says of himself:

 [As for my] knowledge (yon tan), [I] am practiced in Madhyamaka and Pram??a. I know by heart the commentaries [made] by Devendrabuddhi and ??kyabuddhi on Dharmak??rti's Pram??av?rttika. In addition, I am well versed in the commentaries on Praj??karagupta, Dharmottara, and Yam?ri?
[My translation from Caumanns?s German translation]

[Was meine] Kenntnisse (yon tan) [angeht, so] bin [ich] im Madhyamaka und im Pram??a ge?bt. Die Kommentare, [die] Devendrabuddhi und ??kyabuddhi zu Dharmak??rtis Pram??av?rttika [verfassten], kenne ich auswendig. Dar?ber hinaus bin ich auch bewandert in den Kommentaren des Praj??karagupta, des Dharmottara und des Yam?ri.

It?s as if, while being a S??mit?ya, he is offering a cv touting his expertise in the doctrinal qualities (yon tan = gu?as) desired and in demand at that time from possible Tibetan patrons.

thanks,
Dan
