 library
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o83GNp-C_RooTsoWB0+k8Hz_sqJ=fSbOPnCqnTm9rFA=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
On behalf of the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute, I am pleased to
announce the following nine tantric etexts have been added to the
Muktabodha searchable etext library.
 https://muktabodha.org/digital-library/

The texts listed below with brief descriptions from the notes of Mark S.G.
Dyczkowski.

1) advayavajrasa?graha This consists of a series of short tracts
concerning the basic tenets of the philosophical and yogic foundation
of the
Buddhist mah?y?na especially the Vajray?na of the anuttarayoga class.
The similarities with what is loosely called
Kashmiri ?aivism are unmistakable and fascinating. It has accordingly
been placed in this collection of ?aiva etexts.
