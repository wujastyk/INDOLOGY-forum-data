Dear Madhav,
I remember when you explained this to me and to my then classmate, Ed
Hamlin. Ed, with a background in computing, immediately said: that's how
hard drives look for data!
Good memories of your book-crowded office in the Frieze building, back
there in the corner of the ground floor, almost 40 years ago!!
