Dear Matthew,
     I have not seen such names for the penstrokes in Sanskrit, but you
will need to look for them in the vernacular languages.  For example,
Marathi has such names.  When you add ? to ? to write ??, you are adding a
????. When you are adding ? to ? to write ??, you are adding a ???????.
When you are adding an ????????, the dot is called a ????. I am attaching a
chart of these from the 1857 Grammar of Marathi by Dadoba Pandurang:
