[INDOLOGY] an Austrian mystery
Dear friends,
Ole Holten Pind's work on Dign?ga is listed on the website of the Press of the Austrian Academy:
https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/ikga/publikationen/reihen/beitraege-zur-kultur-und-geistesgeschichte-asiens-bkga/dignagas-philosophy-of-language
However, when one tries to "order online" the link does not work. And to search from the Academy's homepage https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/
is similarly fruitless.
Does anyone have any ideas about whether the book really exists and, if so, how it can be ordered?
thanks in advance,
Matthew
