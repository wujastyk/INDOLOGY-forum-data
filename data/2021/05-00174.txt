Dear Jim,
Please disregard if you find this silly, but my thinking went in a different direction. Ku?cik? = a key, but it evokes a sense of similar terms, such as ku?cana, ?curving, bending, contracting; contraction (of a vein)? (MW), and ku?cita ?crooked, curved, bent, contracted; curled (MW), i.e., an image of a coiled snake; keys do force locks to unlock by exerting pressure on tumblers, etc., so just as a key ?snakes? its way to open a door, Ku??alin? breaks through the doorway to liberation for a Yogi. The violence of the snake is implicit in the imagery.
best wishes,
Dan
