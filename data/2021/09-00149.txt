Dear Joanna,
I teach similarly to Antonia, with a few peculiarities.
For dentals, I emphasize that the tongue is on the teeth like in the English thin, thought (obviously not the sound itself). But then, being consistent with it is not easy for myself either, and, like Antonia, I am perfectly fine when students switch to the alveolars. For retroflex, I follow Coulson's explanation. I spend more time on the varieties in pronunciation of the visarga before the velars, labials, and sibilants. And since my native tongue has a widely used vocalic r, for me it is natural to revert to it when teaching the ? and ?. I pronounce j?a as gnya but tell them to do otherwise if they are more comfortable.
I tell them to think of the anusv?ra for practical purposes as a variation more of writing than of pronunciation, except before the sibilants, and that they should look at the following consonant and just go for the homorganic nasal. I also try to make them realize that they likely do pronounce the right nasal even if unaware of it (I illustrate with bang/bank for the velar, Istanbul for the labial). Etc.
At the end, most revert to the sounds they are comfortable with, just as most of us non-native speakers do with English. I see no problem with that, as long as they are not trying to produce Indra's killer.
Best wishes,
Aleksandar

Re: [INDOLOGY] Visualisation of Sanskrit Phonetics
Dear Joanna,
I apologise if my response sounded overly critical.
You described how you teach pronunciation, and that approach seemed to imply, to me, that you were aiming for specific phonetic traits far beyond anything that I assumed we could know about Sanskrit (as you say, your method is painstaking!). Hence my query.
To answer your question: I don't spend a lot of time at all on pronunciation in my intro classes: when we go through the alphabet, I say 'this sound is like sound x in [language of instruction]', using whatever is closest; with only few exceptions (such as retroflex stops) this works quite well teaching in English or German.
I focus on phonemic contrasts and thus teach them to make a difference between, say, th and t, but don't ever mind if their t's aren't fully unaspirated. I am absolutely fine when my German- or English-speaking students pronounce what I suppose we assume were purely dental stops as alveolars, or when I get English l's or German r's; and I certainly don't expect anyone to voice their h's (the latter, I fully admit, also because I myself struggle with that one:-)).
Of course it is important to be able to vocalise the language you are learning, and so I tell them to aim for consistency; but given the lack of phonetic information (and, I assume, the lack of a unified pronunciation across time and space) the explicit goal in my classes simply is approximation.
I hope this is useful - and again apologies that I didn't simply ask 'why do you do what you do?' in the first place!
All my best,
     Antonia

Well, I was somehow misunderstood. I am not going to reconstruct or teach the original Sanskrit pronunciation. I have explained that the formulation "native Sanskrit speakers" was unfortunate.
But we all teach Sanskrit, don't we? And we have to explain to our students how to pronounce e.g. cerebral consonants. Do they exist or not? If they do, I think that the website mentioned by Adheesh could also be very useful  in teaching Sanskrit phonetics. That's all.
I would be rather interested in how you teach Sanskrit phonetics in practice? I have described how I do that. Do you have the same painstaking methods?

No historically authentic Sanskrit pronunciation has survived in India today, because no modern Indian language preserves all Sanskrit sounds. However, there are regional standards of Sanskrit pronunciation, which may be described in terms like the Pune pronunciation, Banaras pronunciation, Mysore pronunciation etc. Sanskrit scholars in these different regions generally follow that regional standard. Reciters of the same Veda from different regions also have their regional standards. The Yajurveda recited in Maharashtra sounds different from the Yajurveda recited in south India. This is to be expected given the diverse linguistic history of India that has left its marks also on the pronunciation of Sanskrit. Even works like R?ja?ekhara's K?vyam?m??s? give details of the regional peculiarities of Sanskrit pronunciation and recitation of Sanskrit poetry.

Dear Johanna,
I was just wondering to what extent, without native speakers (and even with modern native speakers), we have any chance of reconstructing classical Sanskrit phonetics. Devanagari is of course much closer to the ?one grapheme - one phoneme? ideal than e.g. Greek or Latin writing are, and in some later grammatical works we have descriptions is how sounds are to be pronounced; but that still usually only gives us an overview of phonemes, and not necessarily their complete phonetic reality.
I think it?s much more important to teach our students to be consistent in their approximations, so as to be intelligible, than to give them the idea that there is *one* correct ?ideal? pronunciation, so to speak.
All best,

What a wonderful website!
I wish I could use ultrasonography when I teach my students to explain the Sandhi phenomena, e.g. cerebralisation of consonants (cerebral consonants are the most difficult consonants for Polish speakers).
For example, it takes me much time to explain them how to pronounce the noun  k???a. I tell them that if they want to properly  express it,  they have to realise:
1) that they have to open their mouth slightly more than when they speak Polish  and release the muscles of their chicks and other muscles of the lower part of their face,
1)  that when they open the mouth slightly more and pronounce the guttural "k", they will have a lot of place between the tip of the tongue and the palate,
2)  that, having pronounced "k", they have to push the tip of the tongue slightly back (which is now not difficult thanks to creation of space in the mouth), and quickly move it in order to pronounce the vocalical "?" (which is the same movement as in Polish "r"),
3) that, having pronounced "?", they still  have to keep their tongue back (to "yoke" it) in order to pronounce the sibilant "?" (which is contrary to Polish habit to move the tongue a bit forward to pronounce the Polish consonant "sz", the same is for English "sh"),
4) that, having pronounced "?", they still have to "yoke" their tongue in the same position to pronounce the cerebral "?".
I make funny faces when I try to "show" them this process, they laugh at me, and I ask them why they don't laugh at people at the gym who train various muscles of their body (which might look very funny too) and that the tongue is a muscle too, moreover its structure is unique to human species, because it allows us to speak. Then  we come back to the exercises until they say "wow, if we push our tongue back and keep it there, there is no problems with "?" !".  Then they have to exercise until they are able to pronounce the word quickly.
The fact that the larynx is placed slightly more below in Sanskrit pronunciation than in Polish  is the upani?ad and I teach it to them later on. I have some devices to explain how to lower one's larynx. But the video would be of much help.
The movements of lips  (generally speaking the whole vocal apparatus) are also different, but this is easier to be shown. And the role of breathing is crucial, of course (which I teach my students from the very beginning).
If I had such a device, it would be easier for me to explain to them "the art of yoking of the tongue".
It would be great if we could create such videos with Sanskrit native speakers which would take into account the invisible aspects of Sanskrit phonetics. I'd gladly take part in such an enterprise!
Thank you very much, Adheesh. I will certainly use the page during my phonetics classes to show the movements of the tongue in general perspective.
Best wishes,
Joanna

Dear Marcis et al,
I don?t know if this will be useful for your purposes, but the Linguistics department here at UBC has designed a website called ?eNunciate!? with various linguistics learning tools, including ?Sounds of the World?s Languages?, which provides videos illustrating the pronunciation of a broad range of IPA consonants and vowels, including, presumably, all sounds within the Sanskrit syllabary.
They feature both graphical representations like you are looking for, as well as actual ultrasound captures of a live speaker.
The site can be accessed here: https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/linguistics/world-sounds/<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fenunciate.arts.ubc.ca%2Flinguistics%2Fworld-sounds%2F&data=04%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7C45973cd1aa424e47a78108d98073f3bd%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637682057793147425%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=LWHgjcYLw2HgKQjewDHDtS8u%2Fy1JCf23E4%2FhJwGQPvs%3D&reserved=0>
Similar animated videos are found on the ArticulatoryIPA YouTube site: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuOKJqD00W2EiC3DHmOuu0g<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCuOKJqD00W2EiC3DHmOuu0g&data=04%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7C45973cd1aa424e47a78108d98073f3bd%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637682057793147425%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=%2FtrY%2BLDy6AYWbdG6mu3Vkss5gQu3o%2F9R9NOQ%2F%2Bql76o%3D&reserved=0>
For a list of correspondences between IPA and the Sanskrit syllabary, you may consult Andrew Ollett?s excellent Sanskrit reference grammar (v?ddhi?) at the Univ. of Chicago, here: http://prakrit.info/vrddhi/grammar/<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprakrit.info%2Fvrddhi%2Fgrammar%2F&data=04%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7C45973cd1aa424e47a78108d98073f3bd%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637682057793157382%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ZNnVI7mvymXAb6xlAI%2Bk%2Fjp0uGeXB2mvRep4yBQXUlU%3D&reserved=0>
I am also currently making youtube videos that you can find if search for UBC Sanskrit on Youtube. These may or may not be useful.
