[INDOLOGY] Prof. George Chemparathy (1928-2021)
Dear colleagues,
This is to inform you that our colleague Prof. George Chemparathy has 
peacefully passed away in his sleep in the afternoon of November 24, at 
Kattappana, Kerala. He was buried on November 26 at the cemetery of the 
Brothers of Saint John of God there. I am attaching the notice of his 
funeral.
Prof. Chemparathy earned his doctorate at the University of Vienna in 
1963, under the supervision of Erich Frauwallner, and always remained 
close to its Department of Indology and later on the Department of South 
Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies. After his retirement from Utrecht 
University in 1990, he twice served as guest professor at the 
Department.
