Dear Harry,
I am delighted to see so many texts on ritual, many of them very special 
and little known, have been added to Muktabodha list.
It is really a great work and will be very helpful in undertaking 
comparative researches on the vast and varied aspects of Tantric ritual 
system.
Kindly keep on adding such texts. Because the Tantric/Agamic rituals are 
so vast, so variegated and at the same time they all follow certain 
fundamental concepts.
My best wishes for the continued service to Tantric Studies,
Ganesan
