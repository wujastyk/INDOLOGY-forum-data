Dear Lyne,
 thank you for your support and of course also all the others who have
signed the petition so far!
subjects ?
Your suggestion is of course very welcome. Hardly anyone in their right
mind who knows our disciples from the inside would ever think of calling
them "small". Unfortunately, we have no choice, because this is a
designation that has been quasi-officially introduced and has been formally
in use in Germany since then. This can be looked up on the portal of the
"Arbeitsstelle Kleine F?cher":
"A quantitative criterion is used to distinguish small subjects from large
and medium-sized subjects, which refers to the number of professorships per
location."
It is also correctly explained there that "the distinction between small
and large subjects - and thus the emergence of the term "small subject"  as
such - [...] goes back to the development of the "mass university" in the
1960s in the FRG."
(https://www.kleinefaecher.de/kartierung/was-ist-ein-kleines-fach.html)
More need not be said, except that a deliberate misunderstanding of "small"
as "insignificant" has been approved here.
We shall collect all Indology related comments made by the petitioners in
order to present the complete package to the persons in charge.
Thanking you,
and with my very best wishes,
Walter
