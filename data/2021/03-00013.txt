[INDOLOGY] Re: archeological puzzle
Prof. Deshpande,
The picture you shared is of a Veerashiva ascetic.
Veerashaivas bury the bodies of their non-ascetic departed community
members too in a sitting posture only.
But the skeleton under discussion seems to be holding some mudras which is
not a part of Veerashaiva tradition.
