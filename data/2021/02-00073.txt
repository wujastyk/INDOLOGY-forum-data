[INDOLOGY] Re: Hymns that are a mixture of sanskrit and vernacular languages
Thank you to those members who replied on list Nagaraj Paturi, Rajam and to
those who replied off-list, Andrew Ollett and Y?to Kawamura.
An especial thanks to Madhav Deshpande for his superb article.
On page 430 of that article he wrote:
 . . . in the passage *?r?**savit?**s?ryan?r?ya?adevat?pr?tyartham* . . .
Here, the expression *devat?prityartham* is a genuine classical Sanskrit
expression. . . The form *savit? *is a hanging nominative form, which
cannot be grammatically justified in this context. One would expect the
form *savit?* to appear in the compound. However, the vernacular-speaking
audience, and the priest himself, have a greater recognition of the
nominative form savitA than he abstract base-form *savit?*. The nominative
Sanskrit form *savit?* has been inherited by Marathi, but not the abstract
base-form *savit?*.
Is the form  dh?t?  in dh?t??a?karamohin? in Verse 5 of the
ku??alin?stava? also
a vernacular  form.  Verse 5 of the  ku??alin?stava? is :
dh?t??a?karamohin? tribhuvanacch?y?pa?odg?min?
sa?s?r?dimah?sukhaprahara?? tatra sthit? yogin?
sarvagranthivibhedin? svabhujag? s?k?m?tis?k?m? par?
brahmaj??navinodin? kulaku?? vy?gh?tin? bh?vyate
Thanks,
