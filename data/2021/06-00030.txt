[INDOLOGY] question
Dear List Members, in some Tamil Vai??ava Bhakti poems K?r??a is said to have split (k?l?) a bird beak (pul?l?i? v?y). I remember having once seen a miniature depicting this scene. At present I am in particular interested in the name of the bird ? if it has a name. I hope someone can help me with this.
