[INDOLOGY] Re: [Spam:******] Re: On the Date of Classical Tamil Poems
Dear Herman,
as is clear, every ONE has a specific relationship with ONE's mother 
tongue and ONE's culture.
As you could see last week, with the debate about the linguistic 
requirements for the EPHE post in France,
there are different reactions depending on the country.
If somebody whose mother tongue is XXX wants to apply for an Indology 
post in a country CCCC where the "indigenous language" is ZZZ,
and says "Give me the post and I promise to be fluent in the ?indigenous 
language? within two years, the reaction will probably be different if
CCC = France
CCC = Multilingual Canada
CCC = UK
CCC = USA
CCC = Germany
CCC = your country
CCC = ....
As someone who has tried to learn TRIGLOSSIC Tamil for thirty-nine and a 
half years, and who still feels very far from that beautifully elusive 
goal, I am reconciled with the idea that I shall always be
a Lingua Franca (namely English) in which I can never say: "This is how 
I speak" :-)
Language and cultures are fascinating but each one is singular.
There is NO INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ;-)
And you frequently need a visa on your passport :-)
C'est la vie :-)
????????
Way, ...)
