[INDOLOGY] another brief article on Tamil poetry
Dear List members,
as I have just finished a larger project, I feel I am allowed to amuse myself with smaller things. On my website you may find a pdf of a new version of the article posted a few days ago on the role of the ka??am in divination, and one of a new, equally brief, article titled "On Bees, Dragonflies and Drones".
