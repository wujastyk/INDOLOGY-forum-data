[INDOLOGY] syndicalism
Dear Friends,
I'm writing about the unionisation of yoga, its possibilities and
precedents. I serendipitously stumbled across this entry at
spokensanskrit.org:
zramikasaGga-vAda
<https://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=zramikasaGga-vAda&direct=au&script=hk&link=yes&mode=3>
syndicalism
<https://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=syndicalism&direct=au&script=hk&link=yes&mode=3>
[Econ.: Theory of trade-union action]
I'm guessing this refers to the anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the
socialist Auguste Blanqui and the syndicalists that emerged from their
ideas.
Does anyone know the backstory to this entry?
Thank you.
All the best,
????? ???????
