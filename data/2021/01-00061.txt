No doubt there's more to this topic, but this is my bit I can comment on.

Dear list,
Is there any consensus on what an a?gula corresponds to in the metric
system? Or should we not consider it an absolute standard, but rather
take it literally as the breadth of a finger (with all the uncertainties
that follow)? There are a lot of suggestions floating around on the
internet, but I would be interested in any scholarly references.
Best,
Jacob
