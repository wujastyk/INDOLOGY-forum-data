 To clarify, the two cultures are not connected.

  I heard from a Harappan archaeologist and he said that they are not connected. It's from a different time and place.

  Thanks for this reference, Mark.
I think the key sentences here, that many are overlooking, is:
"Another clue is the time frame of these skeletons. While the leper was dated to 2000 BCE, the skeletons in samadhi were from700 BCE[9]. So while the leper burial was unusual, there is nothing unusual about burying a man in samadhi posture by the Early Historical Period."
Interesting, nevertheless.
Best,
Dean

 Dear Matthew,
The skeletal image shown in this article is from a dig at Balathal in Rajasthan. It was taken by Dr. Vasant Shinde of the Department of Archaeology at Deccan College and dated by Dr. Gwen Robbins to the 6th cen BCE.?I reference this image and dig in an article on the roots of sam?dhi burial coming?out in the spring issue?of Oxford Journal of Hindu Studies. The issue itself is part of a special double issue on sam?dhis, tombs, and relics?co-edited by Brian Hatcher, Abhishek Amar and myself.?

Dear friends,
This article has been making the rounds among yoga and meditation groups recently:https://www.indiadivine.org/2700-year-old-yogi-samadhi-found-indus-valley-civilization-archaeological-site/
I am aware that the "proto-Siva" interpretation of certain Indus Valley seals has been much contested during the last few decades but have no knowledge of the other material discussed here.? If you know of pertinent references to reliable sources that will help to shed light on this, I would be most grateful.
best regards,Matthew
