It seems like perhaps it is possible that Jan has not quite addressed
Dominik's point: I did not read him as rejecting the use of French, only
the condition that fluency is a requirement *for application*.

For instance, although one might expect a Spanish or Italian speaker to be
able to ramp up to working fluency in two years, this seems to be ruled
out. NB: As far as I know, the requirement for fluency in German in German
and Austrian universities, and in Dutch here in the Netherlands, is
normally specified as "within two years," and at least it used to be the
case that the university provided support for language training.

Jan, himself Dutch, is surely aware that most people in the world were not
able to benefit from the excellent gymnasium training he received in which
language acquisition was strongly present (and a further note: this is
increasingly not the case even in the top gynmasia here, where so-called
beta tracks [natural sciences] have largely taken over, for completely
understandable reasons.)

So what we seem to come down to is an implicit interest in preventing
non-French scholars from even applying...(which Dominik was of course too
polite to say in so many words)
