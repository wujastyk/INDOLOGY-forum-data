I found the following discussion of this verse in

Meaning of ha?ha in Early Ha?hayoga
by Jason Birch

https://www.academia.edu/1539699/Meaning_of_ha%E1%B9%ADha_in_Early_Ha%E1%B9%ADhayoga

In the Vivekamartanda there are only two instances where the adverb hathat
is used and both imply that Hathayogic techniques have a forceful effect,
rather than requiring forceful effort. In the first instance the Yogin
applies what appears to be khecarimudra and, while meditating on kundalini,
he drinks the liquid (jala) that trickles from a sixteen-petalled lotus in
the head and is obtained forcibly (ha!hat). 86 Here, the combination of
three techniques (i.e., khecarimudra, meditation, and possibly some kind of
pranayama 87) enables the Yogin to forcibly retain his nectar, which would
otherwise trickle away. The second instance occurs in a verse that was
appropriated by at least five later Hatha texts. 88 It reads ?as one
might forcibly (hathat) open a door with a key, so a Yogin breaks open the
door to liberation with kundalini ? (udghatayet kapatam tu yatha ku?cikaya
hathat | kundalinya tatha yogi moksadvaram prabhedayet). As Brahmananda
notes, 89 the most important word in this verse
is hathat because it serves as the proverbial ?lamp on a threshold? to
illuminate both the simile and the statement. He understands hathat as both
balat and hathabhyasat, and the implication of this is that the practice of
Hathayoga causes kundalini to rise, which, like a key, forces the door of
liberation to open. When coupled with other images that are used to convey
the effect of Hathayoga on kundalini, such as that of a stick (danda)
beating a snake (e.g., Hathapradipika 3.10, 3.67), the implication is that
the force of Hathayoga is the forceful effect of its practice on kundalini.

Here he mentions one Brahmananda and the footnote 89 takes us to Jyotsnaa
3.105 of that author.
