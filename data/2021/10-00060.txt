Dear Harry,
no, the fact that this mantra is part of the post-Vedic ?r?s?kta does 
not indicate that it's older than the others.
The late age of these mantras in general has been noted by several 
scholars, from Leopold von Schroeder in 1900 to Peter C. Bisschop in 
2018. It is impossible to infer the date of their composition on the 
basis of their Vedic ?source? texts. In a paper I gave at the DICSEP 
last year, I argued that the modified or adapted G?yatr?s probably did 
not come into being before the 2nd century CE at the very earliest. You 
can find an early draft of my talk and further references here:
