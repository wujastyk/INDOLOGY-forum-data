*New Light on Yoga: Insights, Perspectives, and Methods*
International Conference: September 17?19, 2021
Yoga Vidya e.V., Bad Meinberg, organized in co-operation with the
University of Leipzig and the University of Hamburg

Over the last three decades, Modern Yoga Studies has established itself as
a vibrant and multifaceted field of research that fruitfully combines
approaches from the disciplines of Indology and South Asian studies,
religious studies, philosophy and anthropology. Through this
multidisciplinary effort, the perception of Yoga in the academic world has
fundamentally changed. These significant improvements in the state of
research need to be communicated, discussed, and shared within the circle
of specialists and the broader public with a sustained interest in the
history of Yoga theory and practice. With this thought in mind, Yoga Vidya
e.V. organizes an international academic conference in co-operation with
the Universities of Leipzig and Hamburg, where some of the world-leading
specialists in Modern Yoga Studies will gather to highlight their recent
discoveries, insights and innovative methodological approaches in
comprehensive and comprehensible live-on-stage and online presentations,
each of which will be concluded with a public discussion.
