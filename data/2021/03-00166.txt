Dear Rosane,
Thank you for sharing this shocking information. As you rightly say Agnes was a great scholar and a model collaborator and will be dearly missed. She was probably the only person able to decipher Albrecht Weber?s and other great scholars? handwriting. I am glad that she was at least able to complete many of her ongoing projects over the last years before her illness set in.
