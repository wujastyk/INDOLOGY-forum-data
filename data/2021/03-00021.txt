Prof. Deshpande,
That is another kind/category of Samadhi.
It is called Jeeva Samadhi.
Some Yogis get a tomb constructed around them while being alive. Such a
Samadhi is called Sajeeva Samaadhi.
Guru Raghavendra Swamy's Brindavan in Mantralayam belongs to that category.
Fingers in mudras etc. are possible in such cases.
