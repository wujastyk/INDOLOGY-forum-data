[INDOLOGY] Question about Gandhari Prakrit
Dear Madhav,
You raise an interesting question. One factor that must probably be taken into consideration in trying to answer it is the following: Though a center of Vedic culture at the time of P??ini (i.e., presumably before Alexander's invasion and the Maurya Empire), Gandh?ra was no longer Brahmanical territory after the collapse of that empire. This I argue at length in my book How the Brahmins Won (Brill 2016), especially ? I.1.3.
