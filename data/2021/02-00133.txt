Dear Herman,

Thank you for your comment. Earlier I have discussed in Indology, why the popular interpretation of ?pa?pp??? as ?brahmin? in all occurrences should be set aside in favor of treating it as meaning ?a priest? in general, who could be either brahmin or non-brahmin. (I have discussed the reading v???rp pa?pp?? in Aka. 24 earlier in Indology.)

Coming to other occurrences, there are many instances where a homonym is used in an expression following a verb used as a negative adjectival participle (NAP). The verb used in the expression cannot be used with the intended subject and thereby indicates the other unique meaning. Here are some examples.

tuvv? na?avu - (Pati. 60.12) 
Here na?avu  can mean toddy as well as a city in the C?ra domain. The NAP 'non-eaten/non-consumed? is used to indicate the city.

v??? va??i - (Peru. 370)
Here va??i can mean either a creeper or a type of dance. The NAP 'non-withering' is used to indicate the dance.

v??? m?lai  (Pu?. 364.1)
Here m?lai can mean either a garland or necklace. The NAP v??? ?non-withering? is used to indicate a necklace.

eyy? varivil  (Aka. 192.4)
Here varivil can mean either a bow with lines (of material tied around the bending material) or a rainbow with lines and ?ey? means ?to discharge an arrow?. The NAP 'non-arrow-discharging? is used to indicate the rainbow.

The multiple objects indicated by the homonym can sometimes be linked by an obvious etymological connection and sometimes not. They can also be connected by metonymy. When multiple subjects indicated by the homonym can use the same verb we need to look at other contextual information provided.

Tolk?ppiyam Collatik?ram Ki?aviy?kkam (n??p?s 50-54 or 52-55 or 52-56 according to different commentators) deals with this use of homonyms. 

In the case of por?ap porunar and e??ap p??a?, we are not dealing with disparate things like toddy versus city or creeper versus dance. Moreover, as I have discussed earlier in Indology (https://list.indology.info/empathy/thread/F2E2TBAGDGGHNC45MKHVVLBO64ZOYEDA?hash=F2E2TBAGDGGHNC45MKHVVLBO64ZOYEDA#F2E2TBAGDGGHNC45MKHVVLBO64ZOYEDA <https://list.indology.info/empathy/thread/F2E2TBAGDGGHNC45MKHVVLBO64ZOYEDA?hash=F2E2TBAGDGGHNC45MKHVVLBO64ZOYEDA#F2E2TBAGDGGHNC45MKHVVLBO64ZOYEDA>), the same word ma??ar is used to describe both the bards and warriors. So, in these cases, we are talking about different subsets of a single community that perform different functions and the poets use the same general technique we described above to uniquely identify the subset.

Regards,
Palaniappan
