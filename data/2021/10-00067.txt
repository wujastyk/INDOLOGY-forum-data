Dear Jacob,
Fabulous, thank you! A yantra of 5 by 5 and the number written next to it - that makes perfect sense. I can try to read the engravings with better light, but I doubt that I can read all of them, ever. I can see a ?ta?, and probably ?Ta? (or ?da?), but not in a sequence. Where could I find examples of such yantras (might be too many of them?).
With thanks,
Anna.
