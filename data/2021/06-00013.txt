Thanks, Richard.
Academia.edu has started a similar service, "Academia Letters.
<https://www.scilit.net/journal/6018935>"  Some of our colleagues have
already used it
<https://www.scilit.net/journal-articles?q=journal_id%3A%286018935%29%20AND%20%28bronkhorst%29>.
Short pieces, rapidly reviewed, published with a DOI.  I quite like the
idea.
But there are many, many experiments out there in academic publishing
because everyone who thinks about it seriously knows the traditional models
of peer-review and of knowledge-distribution-funding are terminally flawed
(peer review is not free from bias, distribution is expensive and
exclusionary, publication is too slow).  PeerJ, PLOS, etc. etc.
Best,
Dominik
