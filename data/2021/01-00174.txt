[INDOLOGY] PDF request Dash Fundamentals of Ayurvedic Medicine
Friends,
Would anyone happen to have a scan of Vaidya Bhagwan Dash's Fundamentals of
Ayurvedic Medicine? I need pages 142-156 from the chapter "Cannabis in
Ancient Medical Texts".
The text is on Hathi Trust but I cannot print the relevant pages. Thank
you.
