Many thanks to Evgeniya Desnitskaya, and to Raffaele Torella, for sending
me a PDF scan of Gnoli's edition.

Thank you very much, Vincent, for pointing out that the reading "sy?t" from
the second manuscript is indeed reported in Gnoli's edition, in the
"Additional Notes" at the back. I had missed this.

As Raffaele wrote to me, the quality of Gnoli's edition is so good that,
after sixty years, only some minor details could be improved. This is the
view he got from Dharmak?rti specialists Ernst Steinkellner, Eli Franco,
and Vincent Eltschinger.

Best regards,
