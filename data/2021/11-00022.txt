[INDOLOGY] =?utf-8?q?Book_on_the_=C5=9Aibi_myth?=
Dear List members,
I am searching for a particular publication on the ?ibi myth. I am interested in it in connection with the C??a dynastic history. I remember having seen announced sometime back a book on ?ibi similar to, for instance, Adalbert Gail's Para?ur?ma. Brahmane und Krieger (Harrassowitz). If it exists, I can't trace it. So perhaps my memory is playing tricks on me. I hope someone on the list can enlighten me (on the book or the state of my memory).
With kind regards, Herman
