Dear All,
Thanks for all the replies both on and off-list.
I am eager to hear any further input you might have on the nature of the
n?vi/n?v? and related questions, but I would like to briefly zoom in on the
word dhudhurik?.
Come to think of it, in the manuscript in which I found it, gha and dha
can't be clearly distinguished. (Actually, from a purely graphic point of
view they *could*, but the scribe does not seem to use the graphic
peculiarities of the two *ak?ara*s with a purpose.) Therefore the word
might be either dhudhurik? or ghughurik?.
In this respect, in J.T. Platts' Urd? dictionary I see that the words
ghagh[a]r? and ghagh[a]r? mean ?a petticoat (= gh?ghr?); a short frock? and
that they should be related to the ?S[anskrit] gharghara+ka? and
gharghara+ik?? (p. 935 of the 2004 reprint). However, the meanings listed
by Apte for gharghara?, gharghar? and ghargharik? don't have much to do
with "petticoat", see
https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AP90Scan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=0477-a.
(I might well be on a spectacularly wrong track.)
Does anybody have any thoughts on dhudhurik?/ghughurik?? Can anybody figure
out which language it is?
All the very best,
Gaia Pintucci
