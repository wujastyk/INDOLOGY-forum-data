Interested scholars are invited to send us their CV and a short abstract describing their project.

The candidates will apply for a fellowship (junior or senior) through the Fund for Scientific Research ? Flanders (www.fwo.be<http://www.fwo.be>), with a deadline of December 1st.

Please feel free to forward this information to any interested parties.
