Here, I think, ?dar?a? is the new moon day ? in the common expression dar?a-p?r?am?sa. So a vyutkrama MAY be the performance of a new moon rite on the full moon day, and vice versa.

Dear list members,
In the 'Ma?galav?da' by Var?h?rya (probably, a XVII century Navyany?ya work) I came across a sentence:
r?tri-?r?ddh?dau vyutkrama-k?ta-dar??dau ca ?i?t?c?ra-dar?anena tena ma?galasya saphalatva-kalpan?nupapatte?.
I'm puzzled about what "vyutkrama-k?ta-dar?a' might mean. A Moon rite performed in an inverted order?
I'll be glad to learn your suggestions.
