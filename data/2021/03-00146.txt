[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit term
Dear All:
I wonder whether any of you have come across the expression: pariparamaguru? I find this in a text I am editing, although this sentence cited by T. Ganapati Sastri omits the initial pari. It could be he just felt it was a mistake, but I want to be sure that it not another way of referring to the par?tparaguru. Thanks.
