[INDOLOGY] Re: Trippunitura MS catalogues?
Dear Dominik,
(I repeat Biswas references since the slide did not reach me)
I would be also interested to get a scanned copy of Biswas 0996,  this "Catalogue of manuscripts in Grantha Library attached to Sanskrit College, Trippunitura, Kerala, by K. Rama Pisharoti" appearing to corrrespond to  the hand-written catalogue in Malayalam script preserved in the Library itself, that visitors (like you and me) once saw there.
Biswas 0995 corresponds indeed with the (preserved at the) NCC 'Trippunittura' hand-lists: "Five hand-lists of collections of manuscripts in Trippunittura, Cochin, Kerala State, containing respectively 1839, 353, 211, 43 and 33 manuscripts.
I & II Lists ? of mss. in the Palace Library.
III List ? of mss. in the Puliyannur Mana. Same as Puliyannur Mana.
IV List ? of mss. in the Vadakkedattu Mana.
V List ? of mss. belonging to Ayurvedavidvan T. Kunchu Varier."
And so you put the EFEO copy of the List I-II (mss. of the Palace which must be now in the Sanskrit College library) at its right place in your repository.
The catalogue of the microfilms which were once made by the National Mission for Manuscripts is still available on the IGNCA website:
http://ignca.gov.in/mss/Kerala_ShriRam_Verma_Govt_Sanskrit_College_Tripunithura.pdf <http://ignca.gov.in/mss/Kerala_ShriRam_Verma_Govt_Sanskrit_College_Tripunithura.pdf>
In this case it nearly corresponds to the whole collection of the Trippunithura Sanskrit College Library (without the transcripts and the addenda, see below).
To the list III-V (the fate of these private collections of manuscripts remaining uncertain) and Biswas 0997 (mss. in the Uzhuttara Variyar , Trippunithura, that you provide), one can add now four "lists of manuscripts/transcripts newly identified" published in C.M. Neelakandhan ed., Sanskrit Tradition of Trippunithura, Trippunithura, Centre for Heritage Studies - Hill Palace, 2009, pp. 168-184 (I can copy the pages for your repository): three private collections nearby Trippunithura (Ernakulam and Alwaye) and one collection now included in the Sanskrit College one.
