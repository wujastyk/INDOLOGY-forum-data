Having myself French as mother language, I always had the feeling that 
the education system in France is not particularly open to non French 
students or teachers. Of course, it is different in the world of 
research.
Just an example : we have in Belgium thousands of French students in our 
Universities or Hautes Ecoles, because our education system is quite 
open, while it is particularly difficult for a Belgian to study in 
France.
