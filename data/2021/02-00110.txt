[INDOLOGY] Re: Professor-researcher recruitment campaign EPHE
Another example, which perhaps is not to be generalized : a year ago, I 
was informed that a position as Professor of History of mathematics 
would be opened at the University of Wuppertal (Germany). I went into 
contact by email with two professors there, and all our exchanges were 
in English. I was told that my CV was perfect for the position, which 
implies the training of future math teachers. But, when I asked if I 
could teach in English for a year or two (before becoming able to do it 
in German, a language of which I have a passive knowledge), it was 
answered that this would not be possible. I applied nonetheless, but 
received no invitation to an interview, probably due to the pandemy.
