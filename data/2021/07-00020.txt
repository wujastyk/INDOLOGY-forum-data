Dear Scholars,

I have a question about the story about the meeting of J?va Gosv?min and
M?r?b?? which supposedly happened when she first came to Vrindavan?it is
widely known in the Gau??ya Vai??ava tradition, but I only heard it
transmitted viva voce and never came across any written sources for this
story. If anyone knows of a text that mentions it or is likely to mention
it, please do let me know.

?????????? ??????,
??????
