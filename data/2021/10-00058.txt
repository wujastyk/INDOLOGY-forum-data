Dear list members,
Verse 26 (Sheftelowitz's edition) of the ?r?s?ktam (in the rg-veda khilas)
is the gayatri mantra
 mah?lak?m? ca vidmahe vi??upatn? ca dh?mahi |
tan no lak?m?? pracoday?t |
Would that make it older than the gayatri mantras at Maitr?ya??-Sa?hit?
2-9-1.  Does that make it the oldest gayatri mantra in the form
... vidmahe
... dImahi
...pracodayAt |
Thanks,
Harry Spier
