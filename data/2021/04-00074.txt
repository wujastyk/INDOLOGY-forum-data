Dear List,

With regard to my search for Bahur?pami?ra?s D?pik? on Da?ar?paka and Avaloka, some colleagues asked me about the details of the available edition. 
It is published in Varanasi with Bharatiya Vidya Parakasana, more infos on this link: https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000307811 <https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000307811>
There should be a more recent reprint too.

Best,
Elisa
