Hello, and apologies for cross posting.
I have been working with the library here at the University of Texas to
obtain a copy (either physical or electronic) of the *B?dh?lakacca?a??u?*,
a Malayalam translation of the* V?dh?laGS. *Unfortunately, after hearing
back from the publisher, I recently discovered it is out of print and
unavailable. I was hoping to read this for a directed-reading course this
fall. Does anyone have an electronic copy which they would be willing to
share, or a physical copy from which they could scan select sections?
Publication information about the book is below. Thank you!
VE???RAPPI??I Ma?hattil Illattu S?may?jipp??u? Mahan V?sud?van Namp?tiri.*
B?dh?lakacca?a??u?*. Kunna?kula?: Pa?c??ga? Prassu?,1978.
Best,
Michael Fiden
