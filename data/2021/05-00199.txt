Thanking you in advance for your new book, can you kindly let me know whether any PDF version of the book exists, or whether I can access the book online.(in these pandemic and stay-home times, online studies are in full swing)Iam looking forward to going through your book, which , I believe , would be a highly enlightening one.
Regards.
