Subject: [INDOLOGY] recommended software for diacritical marks in Romanized Sanskrit transliteration?

Dear Dean,

I am not sure which OS you use. If you happen to work with Linux, you may
use the keyboard I designed for Sanskrit and many other South Asian
languages to be used with *IBUS* for Linux (Intelligent Input Bus,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Input_Bus), as a sub-part of the
*m17n* library. The keyboard follows both ISO 15919 and IAST. In fact, as
you will see, it handles almost all possible diacritics (see the file
"keyboard for IBus description.pdf").

The details are in the zipped file: sa-iast-iso.zip

In Linux, you just copy the files the m17n library:

"sa-iast-iso.mim" to usr/share/m17n/ ,

and "sa-iast-iso.png" to usr/share/m17n/icons

run IBus, in IBus preferences ? Input method, add "Sanskrit - iast-iso".

It is free to use, but please retain the source / designer name: "? Piotr
Balcerowicz", also when you modify the file.

Best regards,

Piotr Balcerowicz

Subject: [INDOLOGY] recommended software for diacritical marks in Romanized
Sanskrit transliteration?

Can anyone recommend a web site or program that allows one to easily create
diacritical marks in Romanized Sanskrit transliteration?

Thanks,

Dean
