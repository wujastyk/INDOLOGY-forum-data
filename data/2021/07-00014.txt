Dear list,
I am working on a short grammatical text in Pali called the Kacc?yanas?ra,
composed in Burma, probably around the 14th century. It is a Pali version
of Ca?gad?sa's Sambandhopade?a. Not all verses, however, derive from Ca?ga.
Some seem to be borrowed from a certain *sakkatagantha* "Sanskrit book",
cited in the *nava??k?* on the Kacc?yanas?ra. One of the stanzas borrowed
from the Sanskrit book is the following:
an?dir ayam ?loko saddakhyo yassa na pphu?o ||
The idea is quite common but I have been unable to find the exact Sanskrit
source for this text and I would be most grateful if anyone could offer
help. Maybe it is simply a recast from other famous stanzas with similar
meaning.
Many thanks and best wishes,
Aleix
