An eminent scholar and my colleague, Artur Karp, has just
rightly questioned in a personal letter if there are Sanskrit native
speakers. Well, there are villages in India where Sanskrit is spoken as the
first language, but  Artur is right, the expression "Sanskrit native
speakers" was unfortunate.

>> Dear Marcis et al,

>> The site can be accessed here:

>> Similar animated videos are found on the ArticulatoryIPA YouTube site:

>>
>> For a list of correspondences between IPA and the Sanskrit syllabary, you

>> I am also currently making youtube videos that you can find if search for
