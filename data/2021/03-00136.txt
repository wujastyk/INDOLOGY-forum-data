Dear list members,
Can anyone give me any information about the following Ga?e?a mantra (what
scripture it is originally from, how old it is, ritual usage, anecdotal
information, anything).

 gaj?nana? bh?taga??disevita?

kapitthajamb?phalac?rubhak?a?am |

um?suta? ?okavin??ak?raka?

nam?mi vighne?varap?dapa?kajam ||

I was under the impression it was a popular mantra. but on searching GRETIL
and Muktabodha, and the internet,  I was only able to find it in Kul?la??stra
(IFP transcript T0452) and a mention in an online website that its part of
the rituals on Holika Dahan.


Thanks,
Harry Spier
