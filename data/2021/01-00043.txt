In

Mircea Eliade, *Cosmos and History. The Myth of the Eternal Return*, trans.
Willard R. Trask, New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1954. (in English)
 ,

the word 'chaos' occurs 31 times.

He repeatedly uses the phrase 'chaos to cosmos' to signify the cycle.

He talks of vrtra in connection with chaos pp19-20.

For the purposes of a global comparative mythology and philosophy of chaos
including the 'Hindu', this book is a very good , a highly elaborate , if
not exhaustive source.

It discusses many  concepts such as 'suffering' as  related to chaos, the
other 'end' /'side' of cosmos.
