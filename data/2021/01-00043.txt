the word 'chaos' occurs 31 times.
He repeatedly uses the phrase 'chaos to cosmos' to signify the cycle.
He talks of vrtra in connection with chaos pp19-20.
For the purposes of a global comparative mythology and philosophy of chaos

not exhaustive source.
It discusses many  concepts such as 'suffering' as  related to chaos, the
other 'end' /'side' of cosmos.
