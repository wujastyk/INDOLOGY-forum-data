Dear Herman,

 

Thank you.

 

Yes, if the variant vicciya is considered, then there is no specific mountain named vicci mentioned here. Although Tamil Lexicon does not mention it, paruvi is a synonym for cotton as U. V?. S?minataiyar (UVS) explains in his commentary for Ku?untokai 72 and he cites T?v?ram 7.77.3 although he only cites the form vicci. 
UVS explains how cotton is also planted in millet fields on mountain slopes. Interestingly, UVS had cited T?v?ram 7.77.3 in his notes on Pu?an????u 151 (in 1935 edition) where he explains vicci as a mountain! ?Since the first edition of Ku?untokai was published in 1937, he probably had changed his view on what vicci meant in T?v?ram 7.77.3.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan

Dear Sudalai,

Have you considered that vicciya in T?v?ram 7. 77. 3 is the spoken form of vittiya, the participle of vittutal, "sowing", and is no mountain name at all? paruvi could be a verbal participle of the verb paru(vu).
