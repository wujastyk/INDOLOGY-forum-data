On looking at Ludo Rocher's "The Puranas" in "A History of Indian Literature" (1986) I see he also has a bibliography for each purana he lists and a list of editions and also a general bibliography.

There is a large Epics and Puranas bibliography: _Epic and pura?n?ic bibliography : up to 1985_ (in 2 vols.) ed. by Heinrich von Stietencron et al., comprising more than 2000 pages. See the entry on WorldCat: <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/419980809 <https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldcat.org%2Foclc%2F419980809&data=04%7C01%7Cchristophe.vielle%40uclouvain.be%7Cd098278f56d74b0c00d208d8d5bf78bb%7C7ab090d4fa2e4ecfbc7c4127b4d582ec%7C0%7C0%7C637494366293707657%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Hw0crNYlI1tnwVpKD2QwlXGbJqyj2XalJ4cfcFkS1us%3D&reserved=0>>.

> According to the extensive researches of R. C. Hazra, most of the pur??as now extant are not the original ones. This is based on his gathering quotations from the pur??as found in the old sm?ti-nibandhas, and on descriptions of the contents of the pur??as given in some of the pur??as. The results of his researches were published in a series of journal articles, and mostly included in his book, Studies in the Pur??ic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs. He concluded that only seven of the now extant mah?-pur??as can legitimately claim to be the original ones: M?rka??eya, V?yu, Brahm???a, Vi??u, Matsya, Bh?gavata, and K?rma, and even the K?rma with considerable qualifications. Of the other eleven erstwhile mah?-pur??as, he discovered the original Agni-pur??a in manuscripts under the name Vahni-pur??a. This was edited and published after his lifetime:
