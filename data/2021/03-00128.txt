Hi all,
Would anyone happen to have a PDF version of the following edition of the Brahm???apur??a?
The  Brahm???a Mah?pur??a with English Introduction, Verse-Index and Textual Correction
Editor: K. V. Sharma
Varanasi: Krishnadas Academy, 2000 (reprint)
A PDF of another edition would work as well.
Alternatively, if anyone has access to the physical book of the above edition, I?m merely looking for a couple of page references.
Many thanks in advance.
Best wishes,
Toke
