[INDOLOGY] Origin of Soma and churning of the ocean?
References: <522094581.1303232.1633767601654.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Can anyone provide references to the earliest mentions -- even glancing -- of the origins of Soma -- in particular, to its origin from the churning of the oceans by the devas and asuras?
Later references or surveys would also be appreciated.
Best,
Dean
