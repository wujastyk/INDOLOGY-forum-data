[INDOLOGY] Anup, Bikaner 1944 manuscripts' catalogue
I'm pleased to announce that there is now a scan of the Kunhan Raja 1944
Anup library catalogue available at catalogues.indology.info (direct link
<https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/index.php/s/yfwp8XFRtmnQ8Mr?path=%2FBiswas%200106%20Bikaner%20Anup%201944>).
It has taken a long time to get a scan of this rare catalogue and the
present contribution is thanks to the splendid service of the Wellcome
Library, London.
This catalogue is number 0106 in the Biswas survey
