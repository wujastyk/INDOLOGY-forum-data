[INDOLOGY] Epigraphy and Indology
Dear Dr. Paturi garu,
Thank you.
I agree with you about the introductory parts of literary texts and how epigraphic information can be used along with them to date them, which will lead to the study of the text in its historical context. (My own 2016 paper entitled, "On the Date of Bhavatra?ta, the Jaimini?ya Commentator,? does the first part based on epigraphy arguing for a date several centuries after the one previously held by scholars. I do not know if anyone has followed up with the analysis of its historical context.)
But what I am looking for is a different issue. We know that epigraphic information is preserved intact for a much longer time than manuscripts of literary texts. In other words, inscriptions often preserve texts as they were inscribed long time ago. On the other hand, literary manuscripts, which need to be periodically copied, often contain variations resulting from hypercorrection, copyist errors, editorial efforts, etc. For instance, in my work on the name for Vai??ava saints, inscriptions preserve the original form ??v?r, while the literary texts have come to use the hypercorrect form, ??v?r. The meanings of the two forms are entirely different. Thus the inscriptions help us to identify the original significance of the appellation of a Vai??ava saint and how the literary form has changed. 
It was information on this type of Indological work that I am after.

Palaniappan
