Dear all
I want to know the details (Mss, or published whereabouts) of commentary by
Sripati, on Kadambari.
I found this name referred by Sri Haridasa Siddhanta Vagisha on  Kadambari
Purvabhaga By Mahakavi Sri Banabhata.
Why am I searching ?
To Publish the work because
Sripati's commentary seems to be more rational than Bahnuchandra
For instance in Kadambari
????? ?????????????????
Here Bahnuchandra says the genetive case ending according to ????
?????????? which is very far from the context. Where as Sripati says
?????????????? ????? otherwise which actually had taken accusative
Thanks
