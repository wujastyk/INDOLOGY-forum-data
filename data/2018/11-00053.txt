[INDOLOGY] brick-making communities
It's very tempting to look at today's brickmaking castes and make the leap
to Indus technology.  I've done it myself.  But then one must remind
oneself of the vast depth of time we're considering.  It seems impossible
that this craft could really be genetically connected with practices 4500
years ago.
That's why I'm asking about history, really, to see how far back the
current practices are documentable.
As for the Needham Project, O. P. Jaggi had a go at it.  Not that good, but
sometimes one is surprised.
Best,
