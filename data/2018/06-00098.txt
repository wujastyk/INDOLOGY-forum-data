Dear Johannes,
thanks for this, of course I know all the papers from this conference, including this yours. It deals with the fundamental problem whether we should understand the teaching of classical S??khya more as a cosmogony or individual anthropogony. Preferably both, but then serious inconsistencies would arise.
I understand that in the light of this crucial question my problem with the all-pervasive puru?a is a minor one, but not being a S??khya specialist, I might overlook something important, so that is why I put my question to this forum.
All the best,
Lubomir
