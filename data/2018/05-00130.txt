Dear Elisa,

Thanks you for your message. That is helpful though I find that only about 4 useful diacritical marks come up on the default ABC Extended keyboard: ?, ?, ?, and ? that I can see (I am using a Unicode font). Is there a good tutorial for navigating and/or inputting the diacritics one needs for Sanskrit? It is not self evident, at least to me.

Best,
Ben

Dear Benjamin,

if you use a Mac, you just need to type using a ?US extended? or ?ABC extended? keyboard layout and select a unicode font, like Times or Gentium.

Best,

Dear List,

I am currently trying to update my unicode diacritics input method from the "cut and paste? and or ?autocorrect? input methods I currently use. I was pointed to the IndUni keyboard layouts which I found on John Smith?s web site, however since the instructions are from 2009 I am not finding it easy to adapt to current Mac OS. Is their a better input system than IndUni that people use or have people learned to adapt it to current OS?

Thanks for any input/help!

Best Wishes,
Ben Fleming
