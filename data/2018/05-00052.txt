Re: [INDOLOGY] Rajaparikatharatnamala of Nagarjuna.
Dear Niranjan,
The title is actually RatnAvali and the later Michael Hahn's edition is available here:
http://www.iet-verlag.de/
I do not know if there is an e-text of his edition available, however.
The version given in the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon is quite outdated (derived from Vaidya's reedition of Tucci's edition), but may be accessed here:
http://www.dsbcproject.org/canon-text/book/233
I believe that some additional may have appeared in recent years, but I cannot locate the references just now (or perhaps my memory about this is in error).
