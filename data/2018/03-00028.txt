[INDOLOGY] Abhidharmakosa(bhasya) chapter 6 English translation by Poussin (Ridding/Thomas)
Dear David,
the worst came after : the personal library and all the archives of LVP were given, through Etienne Lamotte, to the University of Louvain, and everything was lost in the second burning of the University library in 1940!
Best wishes,
Christophe
