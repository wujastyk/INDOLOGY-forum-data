Dear Christophe,

allow me to disagree re the meaning of *ajanam*. S. jana - taken as a
collective noun - may mean 'subjects'.

*ajana? te kari?yanti* - could then mean: 'will make you subject-less",
"will deprive you of [your] subjects".

*asm??s te hi prab?dheyur *-------
*ajana? te kari?yanti*

Roughly: <<us - they will deprive of our followers, you - of your subjects>>

Very roughly.

Best,

Artur
