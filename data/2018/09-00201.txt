[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Garuda's resolution
Re: [INDOLOGY] Garuda's resolution
Dear Christophe,
allow me to disagree re the meaning of *ajanam*. S. jana - taken as a
collective noun - may mean 'subjects'.
*ajana? te kari?yanti* - could then mean: 'will make you subject-less",
"will deprive you of [your] subjects".
*asm??s te hi prab?dheyur *-------
*ajana? te kari?yanti*
Roughly: <<us - they will deprive of our followers, you - of your subjects>>
Very roughly.
Best,
Artur
