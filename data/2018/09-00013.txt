[INDOLOGY] Request for commentaries on YS
 Dear Dhaval Patel,
I just noticed that a commentary of some importance is missing in the list
of 21 that you posted. It is of some importance because it is written by a
Jaina commentator: Ya?ovijaya. It was first edited by Sukhlalji, *Yogadar?ana
of Pata?jali with V?tti by Ya?ovijaya and Haribhadra's Yogavi??ik?*, Agra
1922. I have not seen this edition, so the bibliographic data is uncertain.
I have only a 1991 reprint titled *P?ta?jala Yogadar?ana tath? H?ribhadr?
Yogavi??ik?.* I also have a 2001 edition of it by Vair?gyarativijaya simply
titled *P?ta?jalayogas?tr??i*, published by Pravachan Prakashan.
Best regards,
