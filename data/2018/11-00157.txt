[INDOLOGY] Hartsuiker Archive
The Hathayoga Project "resources" page points to the Hartsuiker Archive of
1900 photos at the British Library.  This is an amazing resource.  But
the British
Museum link
<http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=1612938283&objectId=3628111&partId=1#more-views>
has stopped working.  Using keywords it is possible to find a lot of the
Hartsuiker images, but only in a kind of haphazard manner.
Does anybody here know whether the BL has a (new?) "Hartsuiker Digital
Collection" page that showcases the collection properly?  I can't find one.
Best,
Dominik
