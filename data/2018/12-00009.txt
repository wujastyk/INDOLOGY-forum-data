Subject: [INDOLOGY] Kashmir Shaiva and 'vernacular' - a question

Now I become interested. Apabhra??a started its career as a literary language as the language of popular songs sung on the streets (see the dvipad?kha??a in Har?a's Ratn?val?, JESHO, 51 (2008), pp. 355-69). If we had been able to ask the writers of the early literary texts in what we tend to call vernaculars, in what language they were writing they would probably have answered "Apabhra??a". In this case, too, we have two answers, namely "vernacular" (Bannerjee) and "Apabhra??a" (Spier's informant). Is it possible to see a few examples of the passages concerned?

I was  told the verses in the tantrasAra are in Apabhramsa.

Dear Tatiana, and dear Harry,

Strange, somehow. Your exchange contains no information re the language of the vernacular verses ending each chapter of the "Kaashmira (with short 'i'! - TO) Shaiva works". Should it remain a closely guarded secret?

Dear Tatiana,

I referenced the KSTS edition of the tantrasAra because this is available online in the Muktabodha digital library as both a digital e-text and a pdf of the original.   I vaguely recall looking at a tantrasAra manuscript about 20 years ago that had  prakrit verses  that were different from those in the KSTS edition.  But that was 20 years ago so I could be mistaken.

Dear Harry,

Thank you ever so much for the tip!

Are they to be found only in the KSTS edition?

Best wishes,
Tatiana
