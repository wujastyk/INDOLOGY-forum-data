[INDOLOGY] Surdas
Friends
There is a verse attributed to Surdas:
The sakhis were jealous of Krishna's attention to Radha and gave her a cup of hot milk.
This scalded Radha's throat but she did not complain as she was lost in thoughts of Krishna.
When Krishna appeared the next day he had red spots all over him.
Does someone have the actual verse? Is the attribution correct?
Kind regards,
