[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
Surely Nagaraj has made it quite clear that, whatever the precise wording of his sentence, he did not intend to affirm that Sanskrit can tackle climate change.
I think he has also made it clear that he does not wish to affirm categorically that Sanskrit (whatever we might mean here by Sanskrit) cannot assist in tackling climate change. That seems to me a perfectly reasonable position.
I don?t see what purpose is served by trying to insist that his words mean something other than what he clearly intends. It?s not a particularly edifying or constructive spectacle.
I think too that we should avoid assuming that all Indian scholars who criticise Western presuppositions are mindless adherents of RSS or Hindutva propaganda. The situation is more complicated and more nuanced both in India and in Western academia. Can we not be a little more respectful of each other, even when we disagree?

Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
In reporting speech, sentences following the sentence with 'that' conjunction , though do not contain conjunction that, often have the reported part.
Thus in
Prof. Antonia Ruppel -ji was very clear in saying that texts in Sanskrit
can help human kind to tackle climate change. In that sense, Sanskrit can
tackle climate change.
Sanskrit can tackle climate change is part of the reported part.
That it is part of the reported part is substantiated by
Dr Ruppel's
" So, understood in this very specific way, yes, Sanskrit can help us tackle climate change. "

That is not the full sentence. The full sentence is this:

"
This was a paraphrasing of Dr Ruppel's

The statement " I did not make a statement " Sky is blue" "

Dear Nagaraj,
Once again, I beg to differ. I asked a clear and simple question, namely whether Sanskrit can tackle climate change for real or not, and Dr Ruppel provided her own articulated answer. I then replied saying that I understand it so that Sanskrit cannot tackle this problem, to which you replied that I was wrong and that yes, Sanskrit can tackle climate change. After some other emails, Dr Ruppel agreed with me that Sanskrit literature can only help, as many other literatures, but not tackle this problem. The thread is there for everyone to be read.
Now you say that Sanskrit literature can't tackle climate change. Which is your opinion? It's a simple question, to which I can give my simple answer, no it can't. I don't understand why you can't. I didn't ask whether Sanskrit literature contains passages which advocate respect for nature. Sure it does, again as most other literatures, even in the ancient world.

Thanks, Prof. Camillo Formigatti , for agreeing that Sanskrit , like any language is not toxic.
Yes, I am equally worried about climate change.
Speaking Sanskrit can not tackle climate change.
Using Sanskrit for any other form of communication such as writing in it can not tackle climate change.
After diagnosing the roots of the Ecological Crisis in the 'modern' attitude of dominating or controlling nature (I need not quote any specific book or article here because there are plenty of them) and in the Christian attitude ( Lynn White's well discussed/debated famous/notorious article " Historical Roots of the Ecological Crisis) people turned towards traditional cultures from various places, countries etc. Many arrived at the conclusion that cultural diversity is key to biodiversity which is key to environmental health of the Earth. That India has been pro-diversity from millennia can not be disputed. It has been the opposite of the uniformity imposing messianic cultures. That literature in Sanskrit articulates the worldview contributing to the age old diversity in India is the point. In addition, Texts such as the Gita in Sanskrit have a very clear articulation of nature friendly attitude and following eco-cycle etc. as shown in my early post in the present thread. Of course, this kind of ideas can be found in some other texts in some other languages too. But this forum is not a forum of Egyptology to discuss similar ideas in ancient Egypt if there are any. Since  discussing Sanskrit is within the scope of the list, we are doing it here.
I did not make a statement that Sanskrit can tackle climate change anywhere in the thread.
When Prof. Ruppel said that in a certain specific sense, phrasing by the thread initiator can be justified, I agreed with her and said that I would have said the same.
This book <https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Technology_and_Human_Destiny.html?id=9bbQAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y>  and Myths of Science and Technology by the Mc Cormac by the same publisher discuss use of Indian worldview for a solution to ecological crisis.

I am interested in the answer to the question whether Sanskrit can tackle climate change or not, because I'm really very worried about climate change. First you said it can, quoting Dr Ruppel to sustain your argument, and now you say that the sentence "Sanskrit can tackle climate change" cannot be used in a meaningful way. Does this mean then that Sanskrit cannot tackle climate change? I confess I'm really confused now.

That was the phrasing by the thread initiator.

It can not be meaningfully be used only as much as statements such as "Sanskrit is toxic" or phrases such as  "toxicity of Sanskrit can not be.

In isolation, the sentence
'Sanskrit can tackle climate change'
is like the sentence
'Doctors named Brian can prescribe antibiotics'
The latter makes it sound as though it was something about specifically doctors of this name that could do this, rather than just doctors in general. The former makes it sound as though this was a property specifically of Sanskrit, whereas it is a property of all literary cultures - and I pointed out that by 'Sanskrit', we can only mean 'Sanskrit literature and the ideas contained therein' rather than the Sanskrit language.
In Indian English, I often hear 'Sanskrit' used to mean exactly 'Sanskrit literature and the ideas contained therein'. It would be more helpful to reserve a term like Sanskriti for this even in English, and use Sanskrit  (< saMskRt*a*-), for just the language. Otherwise it sounds as though we, either mistakenly or intentionally, assign properties to the Sanskrit language that it, as beautiful as it is, does not have.
All the best,

Bottom line, Sanskrit as a language cannot help us with climate change and some ideas expressed in Sanskrit literature, as well as in ?many other literatures and literary cultures all over the world?, can help humankind in tackling climate change. This means that Sanskrit itself and not even Sanskrit literature can tackle climate change, as much as Henry David Thoreau?s books cannot either, because ?[w]hat is needed to tackle climate change is for people to live moderately and treat their environment (human and non-human) with respect?, and not simply read Sanskrit texts.

Dear Camillo, dear all,
What I find most striking in these debates is the lack of definition/understanding of what people mean when they say 'Sanskrit'. The author of the article at the basis of this thread does not seem to have had a good idea of what they or the speakers they talk about were thinking of; as Nagaraj pointed out further down in this thread, Sanskrit *literature* contains numerous passages that might be relevant in the climate change debate.
What is needed to tackle climate change is for people to live moderately and treat their environment (human and non-human) with respect, and for companies to do that even more so. What also is needed is research that leads to understanding of what the factors are that are the most damaging to the environment.
Sanskrit - the language - cannot help us with that. Sanskrit literature, and many other literatures and literary cultures all over the world, present us with us with centuries and sometimes even millennia of careful thoughts on how to live happily without greed and with respect for others. There are many texts that furthermore encourage careful inquiry, i.e. the kind that is the necessary basis of climatological research. As such, knowledge of (some of) the thoughts presented to us by Sanskrit literature can indeed help us with climate change, as it can with many other aspects of our modern lives.
So, understood in this very specific way, yes, Sanskrit can help us tackle climate change.
But to phrase it in this stand-alone way is misleading: knowledge of the thoughts people have thought in the past, of the ways in which people in the past have dealt with very human problems, and of the ways in which those problems actually remain very relevant today: this is what helps us deal with climate change (among other things).
So up with Sanskrit scholarship, up with ALL the humanities! We just need to make this point more clearly and probably more repeatedly; maybe then they'll stop cutting our funding.
All the best,

Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
Trying to appear as though we have overcame our love for our own individual prestige, prestige of our family, prestige of our educational institute of our affiliation, nation of our origin, nation of our current belonging etc. is unnecessary.
Expressions such as ?? ?? ??????  ????? ?????? ? suit a ????????, a renounced ascetic , not a ??????  , a family person. Within the reference frame of  ?????? ,  expressions such as ?? ?? ??????  ????? ?????? ? are not only anauchitya but even infidelity and treachery to that system. In Telugu there is an idiom meaning "dry Vedanta" used in reference to such usages of extreme level ascetic Vedanta used by family people with mundane interests.
Coming to the word German Indology, I must confess that my understanding of -logy of -logy in the case of Indology is not adavanced enough to distinctly identify German Indology from other strands of Indology. Prof.s Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee even talk of German Indology of 18th and 19th centuries as their focus. That is too much of a minute nuance to my level of understanding. Some time ago, some people asked me to respond to their posts and responses to their posts. I responded to them saying that the issues such as antisemitism in German Indology (of 18th and 19th centuries) etc. raised by them are not studied by me so well.
Later, a few months ago, I got the opportunity to meet the two professors in India. That was their talk on Mahabharata. They were doing a poorvapaksha of the view that Mahabharata is full of self-contradictions etc.
Antisemitism might look to be straw man used by the critiques of early or old German Indology to malign it using the Hitler, Nazis, genocide etc.
But 'Hinduism' and Indian nationalism have been greater victims of this straw man based on Hitler, Nazis and genocide because the symbol of swastika associated with 'Hinduism' and the word nationalism in Indian nationalism are repeatedly invoked to stereotype 'Hinduism', Indian nationalism etc. as fascist, Nazi-like, genocidal in tendency etc. The word German Indology is not popular beyond the readers of the publications of Profs Adluri and Bagchee. But the  repeated invoking of stereotypes of 'Hinduism', Indian nationalism etc. as fascist, Nazi-like, genocidal in tendency etc  is found almost everywhere including popular political discourse. Connection of German Indology with antisemitism may at least give an impression of being reasonable. But why Hinduism should be bad because Hitler used its sacred symbol or why Indian nationalism should be bad because Hitler and Nazis were 'nationalists' or because they used the unscientific racist term 'Aryan', is beyond the comprehension of any reasonable understanding.
Those knowledgeable in German Indology of 18th and 19th centuries and its connection or lack of it with antisemitism might discuss with Prof.s Adluri and Bagchee.
I for one, am not in a reference frame of  ?? ?? ??????  ????? ?????? ? or what your nation? , what my nation ? not to respond when I see that misrepresentation of Sanskrit, India and Indian culture is being done particularly by those who are viewed in India as those who chose  Sanskrit, India and Indian culture  as their subject matter out of love and respect for that subject matter.

This, to be as polite as possible, turns my stomach, but that does not solve the question whether I should, therefore, stop reading his book at the preface. [you might, all of you, take solace in the fact that this proves that at least one person reads prefaces!]]] (sorry, lost count of my embedded brackets!)
Anyway, back to the point (there was one): I am far from the first person to notice that it hardly makes any sense at all to speak of "German" Indology in the first place, but whatever attacks are made against one approach or another, whether the nature of those attacks makes any sense is not to be determined by the motivation of the attacker. Let's sift the wheat from the chaff, and perhaps, after all, some ideas, even if published as scholarship, are not really worthwhile rebutting at all.
