[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
re JOYDEEP
As long as you all allow this hindutva racist to post to this list, mr
joydeep, who has regularly attacked "German Indology" over the years, then
I will fight with you.  I don't defend "German Indology" because I am
German. I defend it because German Indology has been good Indology.
Joydeep's Indology is a racist Indology.  I think that Jonathan and Nagaraj
are astonishingly na?ve when it comes to Joydeep's ideology.  Have they
read Joydeep's papers?
Shame on you both!  Please read some of  Joydeep's papers, and then get
back in touch with the rest of us.
best wishes,
George Thompson
