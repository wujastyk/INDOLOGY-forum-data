Continuing with my Krishna verses:

????????????? ?????? ???????: ??????? ???? ?

???????? ???????????: ????? ?? ???????? ??? ???????

The dark deeds of your uncle Ka?sa cause fear in your mother, Devak?.  The
scare of your mother, O Kr???a, caused the dark hue of your body.


???? ??????? ???? ???????? ????????? ?

?????? ????????? ?? ????? ??????????? ??? ?? ?????

Perhaps it is the accumulated sins of your devotees that you removed that
is causing your dark hue, like the [held up] poison in the throat of ?iva.


??? ?? ????? ????? ????????? ???????????? ?

????????? ????????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ??: ???????

When S?t? entered the fire to show her purity, you were worried of her
burning.  Remembering that you developed a dark hue.


???????? ?????? ???? ??????? ????? ??? ?

????? ?????????, ??? ?? ???????? ??? ???????

Assuming the form of a boar when you held high on your raised tusk the
earth in the water, that earth gave you your dark hue.


??????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????: ?

??? ?????????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????

When you traversed the earth assuming the form of a dwarf taking three
steps, then by the touch of that earth your body became dark.


?????????? ?????? ???? ??????????: ?

???????????: ?????, ?????: ?????????????? ???????

Assuming the form of Man-Lion, when you tore apart the belly of the demon
Hira?yaka?ipu, your anger became the cause of your dark hue.


???: ?????????????? ??????????????????? ?

??? ?????????: ????? ????? ????????????: ???????

The brilliance of a thousand suns will be too scorching for the eyes of the
devotees.  With this worry, O Kr???a, you assumed a dark hue.


??????????? ????????? ????? ?? ?????? ?

?? ??????? ???? ??????? ????? ???? ????????? ?? ???????

Whichever way your dark hue came about, O Kr???a, do not worry.  I love you
as you are.


?????: ????? ??????? ???? ???? ??????? ?

?????????????? ??????? ??????????????? ??? ???????

What kind of a hue or an illness you are, O Kr???a.  Merely by remembering
you, O Govinda, you have spread around me.
