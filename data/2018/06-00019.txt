Continuing my Sanskrit Krishna verses:

????????????? ??????: ??????? ??????: ?
???????? ???????????? ???????????? ???? ???????
Vi??u is described as having the complexion of the moon and wearing white
garments. Just after being born in the womb of Devaki, how did he acquire a
dark hue?

??????????: ???? ???? ????????????? ?
?????????????? ???????????????? ????????? ??
Looking at your own reflection in the mirror of the water of Yamun?, and
noticing your own dark hue, you asked your mother about it.

??????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ????????: ?
??????? ?????????? ??? ????? ?????? ?? ???????
Why am I with a dark hue, while my brother looks fair. O Mother, please
tell me. What is the reason behind my dark hue?

??????? ?? ????????? ???: ????? ????: ?
??????? ???? ??? ????? ??????? ???????
O Kr???a, there are many reasons for your dark hue. Pay attention to what I
am telling you, O Madhus?dana.

??????? ????????? ??????? ???? ???? ?
?????????????? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ???? ???????
Day after day you dive into the dark waters of Yamun?, and then your body
became dark. O M?dhava, is there any surprise?

?????? ??? ??????: ????? ???? ???????? ?
???? ???????? ????? ??????? ?? ??????? ???? ???????
O Kr???a, even if you bathe in the water of Yamun? a hundred times, that
water of Yamun? is of a dark hue. How will your dark hue go away?

???? ????????? ????? ???? ???? ???? ?
?????? ????? ??????? ?????? ????????: ???????
On the banks of Yamun?, you play in the sun day after day. Your brother
plays in the shade. That is why he looks fair.

????? ????????? ?????????????????????: ?
??? ????????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ??? ???????
As a child, you used to run here and there stuffing your mouth with mud.
Your body smeared with that mud became dark.

?????? ?????????????: ????????? ????????? ?
?????? ?? ??????????? ?????????? ????? ???? ???????
The collyrium in the eyes of the mother passes on to the body of her child.
O M?dhava, the collyrium from my eyes passed on to you.

?????? ???????????? ???????????? ? ?
???????? ?????? ?? ????? ?????? ?????
There is collyrium in R?dh??s eyes and in the eyes of the milkmaids, and it
constantly showers on you in Gokula, O Kr???a.

?????????? ????????? ??????: ??????? ?? ???: ?
????? ??? ?????? ????? ? ???????? ????? ???????
The gaze of the milkmaids, smeared with collyrium, touches your body. That
collyrium of theirs will never go away.

??????? ?? ??????? ????????? ????? ?? ?
?? ?????? ????????? ????? ????? ???? ????????? ?? ???????
O Govinda, your dark hue has entered into my heart. What worry is bothering
you today? You are dear to me as you are.
