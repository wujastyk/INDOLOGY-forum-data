Dear Prof. Deshpande,
1. >  On the contrary, Madhv?c?rya calls Arjuna *uttam?dhik?r? *at the
beginning of his Bhagavadg?t?-T?tparya-Nir?aya. Contrary to what?
2. S'ankara does not call Arjuna 'mandabuddhi'. While paraphrasing the
first person expression of Arjuna, he uses the first person expression
 '*yadyapi
vivikt?bhidh?y? bhagav?n tath?pi **mama** mandabuddher vy?mi?ram iva
bhagavadv?kyam pratibh?ti.'. *So S'ankara is saying that Arjuna is
considering himself or making himself appear to be 'mandabuddhi' .
 Sri V. Subrahmanianji pointed out this finer aspect already when he said,
"  ?????? ?????????????? ?????? , ????? ?? ??????????? ????????????
??????????? ????????? ?  This is the thinking *by Arjuna*, *as per Shankara*,
BG 3.2 bhashya "
3. Why should Arjuna, use expressions such as '????????????? ???????
??????? ??????? ??' ? In books such as BhG, which are composed in the form
of a conversation between a guru and a s'ishya, the s'ishya represents the
target reader / target audience of the book. When the composer of the book
realises that the explanation given so far by the guru could be difficult
to the target reader / target audience of the book to grasp, further
clarifications may help the  target reader / target audience of the book,
the composer of the book makes the s'shya say, ' I am not able to grasp.  I
am a bit confused. Please clarify. '. This is a very good technique to make
the  target reader / target audience of the book feel that the book is able
to read his mind and respond to all his questions almost as an interactive
presentation.
4. So the mandabuddhi that is presented by Arjuna as his is, in fact, that
of a certain level of  the target reader / target audience of the book.
5. Prof. S. Radhakrishnan's expression madhyamaadhikaarin is not coming
from this vyaamis'rENEva context. It is coming from a jnaana-karma context.
His defective expressions such as salvation for moksha show his capability
of making defective expressions such as madhyamaadhikaarin.
6. There is no proof that Madhvaachaarya was saying Arjuna is a
uttamaadhikaarin in response to any words of S'ankara. Nor is there a proof
that S'ankara had a view contrary to this view of Madhva about Arjuna.
