Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
In-Reply-To: <LO2P265MB0304DA7D771C8D99EFD7A9898E1B0@LO2P265MB0304.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eb6zkv_jrsiD97a1i9PLvrcpfC8gDbZWkG4K5NFN6FCbg@mail.gmail.com>

In reporting speech, sentences following the sentence with 'that'
conjunction , though do not contain conjunction that, often have the
reported part.

Thus in

Prof. Antonia Ruppel -ji was very clear in saying that texts in Sanskrit
can help human kind to tackle climate change. In that sense, Sanskrit can
tackle climate change.

Sanskrit can tackle climate change is part of the reported part.

That it is part of the reported part is substantiated by

Dr Ruppel's

" So, understood in this very specific way, yes, Sanskrit can help us
tackle climate change. "
