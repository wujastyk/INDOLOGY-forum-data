In modern Marathi, the word "bh?gola" is used in further extended meaning
of "geography," and the Marathi books on geography routinely use this
word.  However, the word "bh?ma??al?a" is used in the work of R?mad?sa in
the 17th century: "?????????? ????? ???? ???? ??? ???? ??????? ??? ???."
"Ma??a?a" and "Gola" are also used in Marathi in conjunction with S?rya.
