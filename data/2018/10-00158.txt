Dear Harry,
For a clarification of Witzel?s views as a textual critic, see *Philology
and Criticism*, Conclusion: Textual Criticism and Indology. The entire file

On the attempted stratification of the BhG (and Artur?s reference to
?earlier strata?) see ?Paradigm Lost: The Application of the
Historical-Critical Method to the Bhagavadg?t?,? available here:
https://www.academia.edu/30431442/Paradigm_Lost. See especially the table
on pp. 259?61.
Best,
