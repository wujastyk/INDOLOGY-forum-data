[INDOLOGY] "Caste passing"
The query was for
"I am searching for *references in** Indian literature* and *classical
texts *of instances of "caste impersonation", i.e. when an individual or a
group "passes" as a caste which is not their original birth group. My
search includes such instances in *contemporary literature*" (highlighting
mine)
Since the first sentence has Indian literature and classical texts , I
thought 'contemporary literature' in the second sentence means contemporary
literary texts such as novels. Am I right?
