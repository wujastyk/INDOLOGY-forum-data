It is perhaps not reasonable to enter into this question here, but:
insofar as any scholar has his or her own skill set and range of interests,
it is obviously true that "Even if the department enthusiastically pursued
his replacement, it would struggle to find a scholar today with Insler?s
skills." But only if that is understood to mean an exact or very close
match for Insler's skills. For there are more than a few Sanskritists with
excellent broad knowledge of Indo-European, general linguistics, Vedic etc.
and more than one of these scholars, I am quite sure, would be delighted to
apply for a chair at Yale. So it is a pity that Marko Geslani chose to
express the matter in this way. (None of this should be understood to be
any criticism of Prof Granoff, by the way; I was also more than a little
surprised to see that her almost superhuman knowledge of Indic languages
was ignored...)
