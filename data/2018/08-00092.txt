[INDOLOGY] Deccan College sanskrit ditionary
Dear Prof. Deshpande,
I absolutely agree. Most probably Wilson's entry (MW's presumable  
source here) goes back to the information given by contemporary  
Pandits which fits perfectly well in the fact that the lemma apavyaya  
is lacking in both of the Petersburg dictionaries.
