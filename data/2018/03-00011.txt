There is a trend in the 17th century and the period around that, of writing
abridged versions of Ramayana, MahaBharata, Bhagavata etc. A very big
number of such works is there.
Yigal Bronner was telling me that he was working on the political
/sociological background that lead to this trend.
I do not know if he came up with any publication on this.
