[INDOLOGY] Hartsuiker Archive
I'm told by Jason Birch that,
"I was told by someone that the BL had taken the images of the Hartsuiker
Archive offline in order to replace them with high res ones. This involved
redigitising the whole collection. I don't know when the collection may go
back online."
Thanks, Jason,
Dominik
