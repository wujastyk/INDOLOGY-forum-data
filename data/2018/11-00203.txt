[INDOLOGY] Kashmir Shaiva and 'vernacular' - a question
Dear colleagues,
I would be grateful for an answer to my question related to the following
passage in the Introduction by the editor, S.R. Banerjee, to  
'PraakRtadhyaaya':
"Kaashmira (with short 'i'! - TO) Shaiva works are  almost invariably  
accompanied
with some verses in the vernacular in the end of each chapter." (p.34)
What kind of a 'vernacular'/Prakrit is it?
Does it show some specific local features?
With best wishes,
Tatiana Oranskaia
