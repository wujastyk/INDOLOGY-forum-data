"pu?gala is defined: puna? punar gati?u liyata iti. Because one is born and is joined repeatedly to existence as a god, human, etc., it is called 're-joining' [perhaps for punarbhava]. It is also explained:  p?ryate galati caiva pu?gala. From birth to maturation one grows (lit. "fills") and from maturation to death runs down (lit. "leaks, oozes"). The term may be explained in either way, but because the designation made earlier is well-known, it is left as is and gang zag is the [accepted] designation."


This is interesting in part as it suggests that gang zag  (?grows and runs down?) was in current usage prior to the work of the translation committee responsible for the Madhyavyutpatti, but it does not clarify whether it had been a coinage of earlier translators or a Tibetan convention that had arisen otherwise.


The late Michael Hahn may have had the above in mind when he wrote his remark cited by Prof. Steiner, but he did not enter into it in detail as he was concerned in that article to mention it as an analogy for the type of compound we find in gtsug lag.
