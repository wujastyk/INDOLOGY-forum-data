[INDOLOGY] The Buddha's body in a vat of oil
"teli-dona" in Sanskrit would be "taila-dro?am".  This expression occurs
twice in the *Carakasa?hit?*.  In both cases it should be understood not in
the sense of "a barrel of oil," but rather "ten litres of oil."  A *dro?a*
is a unit of measure (see *Roots of Ayurveda* "?ar?gadhara on weights
measures and definitions."  A dro?a is not exactly ten litres, but roughly
so.
When the *Carakasa?hit?* gives its longevity instructions at Ca.ci.4.7, the
patient is to be put in a barrel and the word is *dro?a*: s*nehabh?vit?y?m
?rdrapal??adro?y?? sapidh?n?y?? digv?s?? ?ay?ta* "he should lie naked in a
pal??a-wood barrel that has been steeped with oil, covered with a lid."  (
*Roots*, "Rejuvenation through Soma" in the Su?ruta chapter).
My conclusion is that although there are oiled barrels in classical
Ayurveda, a teli-dona isn't a barrel of oil, but rather an amount of oil.
