I always thought that on this list ad hominem remarks are not permitted. Therefore I am amazed that Jean-Luc Chevillard's mail has passed the moderators. I refer to the sentence "It is indeed an opinion current among those who have not read Tolk?ppiyam", by which Jan Houben is set aside and disqualified to express an idea about the origin of the title Tolk?ppiyam. All this, only to get rid of the word k?vya in the name Tolk?ppiyam. Strictly speaking this move is not even necessary, that is, unnecessary for those who claim an early date of Ca?kam poetry, as the word k?vya is almost certainly older than the 9th century; see Stephanie Jamison, The Rig Veda Between Two Worlds, p. 144.
The type of argument used by Chevillard is typical of many Tamil scholars: about me (and not only about me but also to my face, in Pondichery and at JNU) they say that I do not know Tamil, for if I knew I would not date Ca?kam that late.
Here I stop, this is my last mail in this particular thread.

Dear Jan,

I don't believe wwhat you say is true.

However, it is indeed an opinion current among those who have not read
the Tolk?ppiyam.

But if one reads the Tolk?ppiyam, one will not find this explanation to
make much sense.

My preferred explanation is the traditional explanation, current among
native Tamil scholars, which derives the name from ?????????????????
[tolk?ppiyakku?i] which is the name of a clan (or gotra? or village?).

However,
life being short
and this topic having already been discussed on this very mailing list,
NINE years ago (in April 2009),
I shall leave it at that.

???????? [a?pu?a?]
