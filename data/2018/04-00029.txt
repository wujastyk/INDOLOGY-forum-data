Dear Raffaele,
If you do a search of the Muktabodha digital library e-text collection.
http://muktalib5.org/digital_library_secure_entry.htm
and do a search of the e-texts for  <camatkAra>
(Note the < and > in the search term tell the digital library you are using
Kyoto-Harvard transliteration.) you will get a large number of references
to camatkAra.  Most are later than the date you are asking about but its
possible some might be earlier if you are lucky.
Best wishes,
Harry Spier
