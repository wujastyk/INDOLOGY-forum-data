Hello Ken,
     It seems to me that the connection of the words go??ha and go??h?
needs to be investigated.  Go??ha refers to the cowshed, and that cowshed
may have served as a place for gathering of friends and family members to
chat. Such may be the origin of go??h? as a
dialogue/conversation/chatting.  In this sense, the word go??? appears in
Marathi usage, and the vernacular usage is probably related to the use of
go??h? in combinations like k?vyago??h?, vidvadgo??h? etc.
