[INDOLOGY] Resources for commentarial interpretations of particles
Alas Bochenski's discussion (art. 53 sec. F) consists of 9 lines, 3 
lines of which are a schema for the three conditions of the Trairuupya, 
are translations of eva, respectively, as "wholly", "only" and "never".
On `eva', see the following:
Kajiyama, Y. 1973 Three kinds of affirmation and two kinds of negation in
Buddhist philosophy. Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?dasiens: v. 17,
pp. 161 ? 175.

ical) quantification in Sanskrit. Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde

An appendix to the last article provides a taxonomy of the various 
usages found in the Svaarthaanumaana section up to verse 38 of 
Dharmak??rti's Pramaa.navaarttika. I have found that taxonomy to be 
borne out in various readings I have done since then. (There are usages 
which were to me, at least, unclassifiable.)
