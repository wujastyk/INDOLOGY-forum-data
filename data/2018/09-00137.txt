[INDOLOGY] Garuda's resolution
Dear List Memebers,
First of all: my thanks to all who gave me their time and answered my query
- preventing me from commiting a grave error. To Roland Steiner, Hans
Henrich Hock, David and Nancy Reigle, Tracy Coleman.
Now, my second question ---
In Mbh I, 30.7c-e Indra says (to Garuda):
01.030.007c na k?rya? tava somena mama soma? prad?yat?m
01.030.007e asm??s te hi prab?dheyur yebhyo dady?d bhav?n imam
VanBuitenen 1973: 90: "If you have no need for the soma, return the soma to
me. For those to whom you may give it will forever best us".
[ad 'best':  Monier-Williams has several other - sort of 'sharper' -
meanings for pra-b?dh: to repel, drive away, keep off (Mbh); to torment,
vex, hurt, injure, annoy.
By the way - Kalyanov (I value his pioneering translation immensely) 1950:
103: "Yesli ty ne nameren vospol'zovat'sya somoy, to day yeyo mne. Ibo te,
kotorym sobirayesh'sya dat' yeyo, budut vredit' nam". 'Budut vredit' nam' -
'shall injure us'; no 'forever'.]
*Whom the myth makers may have in mind when they speak about those who
"will forever best us"? *
I'd be grateful if the comments were directed to the List, not to my
private e-mail address.
Thanks,
