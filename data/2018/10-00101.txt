I agree that the phrase "shit-and-muck sprinkling system" is somewhat rough.

But I'm quite fed up with the tendency to reductio ad Nazismus of 
Indo-European studies promoted by some people. I have the right to be 
offended by this "method".

So I consider the phrase adequately describes the discourse of these 
people. That's basically what their discourse is about. It's not a 
regular and acceptable scientific discourse.

If you reduce Indo-European studies to Hitler, racism and nazism, don't 
expect to get rose petals in exchange (at least not from me).

With best regards.

In the meantime the list policy must have changed a lot if it is now deemed fine for a list member to call in earnest a ?shit-and-muck sprinkling system? some other list member?s discourse. Or does it depend on academic status ? some list members may be freely offended, and some must not, even in a dream?
