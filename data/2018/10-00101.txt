[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 69, Issue 18
I agree that the phrase "shit-and-muck sprinkling system" is somewhat rough.
But I'm quite fed up with the tendency to reductio ad Nazismus of 
Indo-European studies promoted by some people. I have the right to be 
offended by this "method".
So I consider the phrase adequately describes the discourse of these 
people. That's basically what their discourse is about. It's not a 
regular and acceptable scientific discourse.
If you reduce Indo-European studies to Hitler, racism and nazism, don't 
expect to get rose petals in exchange (at least not from me).
With best regards.
