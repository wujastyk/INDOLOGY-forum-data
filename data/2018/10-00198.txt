=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_gang_zag_and_puru=E1=B9=A3a?=
Negi, Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary [vol. 2], CIHTS, Varanasi, p. 473 gives pudgala?, with sattva? as a secondary for gang zag; then lists pu?gava? and pum?n.   Through the next 15-20 definitions, there are variations of pudgala such as pudgalapraj?apti? (gang zag ?dogs pa), but none with puru?a.
I forget where, but I read a perhaps apocryphal story, maybe a joke, about a nomad or some other rustic visiting Lhasa who came upon two monks hotly debating the famous emptiness of the gang zag, and intervened to say, as I recall, ?pray sirs, just use mine!? offering his tobacco pipe (gang zag).  A tobacco pipe is filled (gang) and emptied (zag).
This meaning of pudgala (Pkt puggala) becomes clearer in the Jain context where a person?an individual karmic subject?waxes and wanes. Thus, Jainendra Siddh?nta Ko?a (vol 4, p 68) cites niyamas?ra t?tparya v?tti 6: galanap?ra?asvabh?vasan?tha? pudgala?
For puru?a, Tibetan translates skyes bu or mi.
