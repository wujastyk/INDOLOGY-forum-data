[INDOLOGY] Resumption of 'In an oil vat'.
Dear List Members,
    The Buddha's last  sermon (of unknown content) took place in
P?v?. Its recipient
was the local blacksmith. His name, *Cunda*, does not sound Indo?Aryan. The
text calls him *kamm?ra*-. Although generally related to the Skt. *karm?ra
- *'blacksmith'*, * the etymology of this term is uncertain. In his *A
Comparative Dictionary of Indo**?**Aryan Languages * (2898) Turner allows
for the possibility of it being a borrowing from the Dravidian (<<cf. Tam.
*karum?, *'smith, smelter', whence meaning 'smith' was transferred also to
KARMAK?RA->>).
     The Buddha and Cunda: a meeting, it seems, of the representatives of
two differing traditions. *S?karamaddava*, the term describing the dish
offered by Cunda to the Buddha, sounds Middle Indo-Aryan. Nevertheless, its
meaning is not clear, it has acquired a number of unconvincing
interpretations.
     If so - could this term have also  originally come from the local
non-Indo-Aryan dialect? Was it, in its Pali form, an ad hoc created
vocabulary item? Have there been attempts to find its equivalent in the
local smiths? professional terminology? In the local Dalits' kitchen
vocabulary?
    I am not aware of any.
