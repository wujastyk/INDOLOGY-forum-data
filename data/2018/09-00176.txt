Jonathan,
It's a phonological feature that is characteristic, I think, of a specific group of MIA/NIA and nearby languages. Hence, for example, both the modern Nepali name Harkha (<--Har?a) and the modern Newar pronunciation and occasional orthography of the ?khe?ak?ar?? (= ?a?ak?ar?). Newars would have been speaking about these texts in Newari, of course, but using pronunciations that made sense in a linguistic and cultural milieu that connects them to Bengali, Maithili and so on.
There is a paper by Brinkhaus that may examine some of this, but I've never been able to put my hands on a copy. Would anyone happen to have a copy?
Brinkhaus, Horst. 2003. "On the Transisiton from Bengali to Maithili in Nepalese Dramas of the 16th and 17th Centuries." In Maithili Studies: Papers Presented at the Stockholm Conference on Maithili Language and Literature, pp. 67-77. 
Be well,
?WBTD.
