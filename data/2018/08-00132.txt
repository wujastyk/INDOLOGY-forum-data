[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Sandhi of word final n
Hello Harry,
     In a sandhi sequence like dev?n+tatra, according to P 8.3.7
(na?chavyapra??n), the word final n changes into ru, which changes into
visarga and ultimately into s.  The vowel before the n becomes optionally
nasalized by P 8.3.2 (atr?nun?sika? p?rvasya tu v?), and in the alternative
that it does not become nasalized, it is followed by an anusv?ra by P.8.3.4
(anun?sik?t paro 'nusv?ra?).  The rule P 8.3.36 (v? ?ari)  says that a
word-final visarga optionally remains a visarga before ?, ?, and s, while
the V?rttika (kharpare ?ari v? lopo vaktavya?) stipulates that if the
following ?, ? and s are followed by a khaR sound (i.e. kh, ph, ch, ?h, th,
c, ?, t, k, p, ?, ?, or s, then the visarga is optionally deleted.  Your
example ???????? ?????, and the observations of Whitney, MacDonell and
Coulson seem to relate to the variation noted by these rules of P??ini and
the V?rttika.  There are quite a few options involved, and they reflect the
variation in the usage.  Best,
Madhav
