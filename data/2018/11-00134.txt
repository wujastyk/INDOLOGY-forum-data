Actually, the object is botched in the manner of many Chinese manufactured objects drawing on esoteric Buddhist motifs. It has nothing to do with Tibetan. The central mantra is supposed to be O? ma ?i pa dme h?? sv? h?, but in fact, if read clockwise it is

O? dme pa ?i ma h?? sv? h?, or if read counterclockwise

O? h? sv? h??  ma ?i pa dme .

In other words, wrong either way.


The longer surrounding dh?ra?? in a sort of funky devan?gar? I've not tried to sort out.

Dear McComas,
This is a typical Buddhist votive object with Sinitic n?gar? script. The eight petals: o? ma?i padme h?? (counter-clockwise) and the b?ja letter hr?? in the center. The outer ring must be another dh?ra??. Tony Lin has a number of works in Chinese discussing all these objects. I am happy to share the bibliography if it is of interest to you.

Dear Colleagues

I wonder if any of you multi-talented folk can help me read the inscription on this small Chinese ceramic from the Ardebil shrine?

Yours sincerely
