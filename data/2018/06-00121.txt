=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_all-pervasive_puru=E1=B9=A3a_in_classical_S=C4=81=E1=B9=83khya?=
I thank to everyone who responded to my query on and off the list. Apparently there is no easy and simple answer to the problem of the all-pervasive puru?a as it is described in the Jayama?gal?. I am inclined to believe that (as Edeltraud Harzer mentioned) this commentary sometimes comes with concepts which are different from the classical S??khya mainstream teaching.
Best,
