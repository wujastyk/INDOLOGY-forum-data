I thank to everyone who responded to my query on and off the list. Apparently there is no easy and simple answer to the problem of the all-pervasive puru?a as it is described in the Jayama?gal?. I am inclined to believe that (as Edeltraud Harzer mentioned) this commentary sometimes comes with concepts which are different from the classical S??khya mainstream teaching.

Best,
Lubomir

See YD on SK 36 (Wezler/Motegi edition), p. 223, l.1ff.

Sure, it might reflect some older teaching that survived outside the S??khya mainstream. But the question whether each puru?a is all-pervasive all the time or only when liberated seems to me rather crucial. All commentaries apparently take it for granted that puru?as are all-pervasive all the time, only Jayama?gal? for some reason distinguishes between liberated and non-liberated puru?a. This puzzles me.

I cannot answer the question of my students how could puru?a (who is absolutely passive etc.) change itself so dramatically? And where does this concept occur in classical S??khya? Could you please help me with these answers? I am not a specialist in S??khya, we have this seminar just for fun, so I probably missed something in S??khya teaching on puru?a. I promised to my students that I will ask this learned forum to get the right answers.
