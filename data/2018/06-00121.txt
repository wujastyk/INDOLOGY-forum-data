I thank to everyone who responded to my query on and off the list. Apparently there is no easy and simple answer to the problem of the all-pervasive puru?a as it is described in the Jayama?gal?. I am inclined to believe that (as Edeltraud Harzer mentioned) this commentary sometimes comes with concepts which are different from the classical S??khya mainstream teaching.
Best,
