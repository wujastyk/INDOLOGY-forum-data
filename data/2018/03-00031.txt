Yes, dear Eli, you are right: what was still kept in Lamotte?s home/office was saved and later transferred with Lamotte?s library, through Durt, to the EFEO in Kyoto. I heard that this EFEO collection came back to Paris a few years ago and that now Lamotte books can be found in the EFEO library at the Maison de l?Asie. Note that the manuscripts collection did not burn in 1940, and so there is still in the university library one Indian manuscript donated by LVP, with the following hand-written notice by Lamotte :
"Manuscrit sanscrit. Eloge du champ du seigneur Sv?yambhu, ?criture devan?gari, 44 p. avec miniatures 4 planches histori?es et 2 planches ? motifs fleuris, 19e-20e  si?cles, don Louis de la Vall?e Poussin ?




Best wishes,
Christophe

>>> Thank you very much for explaining all this. Yes, it seems that I misunderstood LVP to mean that his translation had been published. Glad that you clarified the sense of the French word "sortit" as meaning that an English translation "was produced," not published. Pruden had translated this phrase as saying that their collaboration "led to the appearance of an English version . . . ," which normally means that it had been published, and I followed him in this understanding. Thanks to your explanation, I now know why I could never find where it was published: it was not published.

>>> according to me, following what LVP says in the concerned paragraph (https://archive.org/stream/labhidharmakosat04vasuuoft#page/n5/mode/2up <https://archive.org/stream/labhidharmakosat04vasuuoft#page/n5/mode/2up> ), this English translation was not published (by ?sortit? LVP rather says only that an English translation was produced; if it had been published, I think he would have spoken differently, and the item would have been recorded in Lalou?s almost complete bibliography of LVP) ? for me (but I may be wrong) it must have been a kind of ?working paper? made by LVP together with Ridding and Thomas during the time he was in Cambridge (viz. during the whole first world war), that he later used for preparing his 1925 publication, like the preliminary (French) translation he says he made in 1913-1914 of the 5th chapter : the latter is said (in the same ?) to have been partly printed by J. Istas - I do not see to what LVP refers according to his 1913-1925 bibliography (in the following work - https://archive.org/stream/pts_bouddhismetude_3720-0699#page/n135/mode/2up <https://archive.org/stream/pts_bouddhismetude_3720-0699#page/n135/mode/2up> - printed by Istas in 1913, I only find a portion of AK ch. 3; the whole ch. 3 having been published in Bouddhisme. ?tudes et mat?riaux. Cosmologie?, printed in 1913-14 for the Royal Academy of Belgium but published only later, in London, in 1919, because of the war) - however, an explanation can be found in the intr. to the first vol. of the AK (1923, https://archive.org/stream/labhidharmakosat01vasuuoft#page/n7/mode/2up <https://archive.org/stream/labhidharmakosat01vasuuoft#page/n7/mode/2up> ) where LVP refers to the ?chapter 5 of which the translation was burned in Louvain? (the university library was destroyed together with printing offices attached to it, like J.B. Istas? one, in 1914): so we can imagine that his 1913-14 translation of the 5th chapter was in course of publication by Istas, and that proofs were printed for a part before being lost (LVP keeping his typescript).

J. Thomas. Because of this collaboration, he says, the English equivalents were very carefully researched. I have never been able to find where this English translation of this chapter was published. Neither Leo Pruden nor Lodro Sangpo give a bibliographic reference to it in their English translations of Poussin's entire French translation. Can someone point me to it? Thanks.
