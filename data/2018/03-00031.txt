[INDOLOGY] Abhidharmakosa(bhasya) chapter 6 English translation by Poussin (Ridding/Thomas)
Yes, dear Eli, you are right: what was still kept in Lamotte?s home/office was saved and later transferred with Lamotte?s library, through Durt, to the EFEO in Kyoto. I heard that this EFEO collection came back to Paris a few years ago and that now Lamotte books can be found in the EFEO library at the Maison de l?Asie. Note that the manuscripts collection did not burn in 1940, and so there is still in the university library one Indian manuscript donated by LVP, with the following hand-written notice by Lamotte :
"Manuscrit sanscrit. Eloge du champ du seigneur Sv?yambhu, ?criture devan?gari, 44 p. avec miniatures 4 planches histori?es et 2 planches ? motifs fleuris, 19e-20e  si?cles, don Louis de la Vall?e Poussin ?
Best wishes,
Christophe
