[INDOLOGY] Garuda's resolution
Dear Colleague,
The usual interpretation of the combination kim (interrogative pronoun) plus cid is as an indefinite, and combined with the negative na, it is best translated (in English) as ?anybody?. So the interpretation of the line would have to be something like ?I (aham) will not (na) give (d?sy?mi) soma to even (api) anyone (kasmaicid) to take (sam?d?tum) [it]?. So, everybody will be excluded from taking the soma.
Best wishes,
Hans Henrich Hock

Dear List,
In Mbh I, 30.8 b Garuda says:
na d?sy?mi sam?d?tu? soma? kasmaicidapyaham
kasmaicid - (to) whom?
Who is going to be excluded?
Your opinion, please?
Thank you,
Artur Karp
