Subject: [INDOLOGY] Updates and new look of Aksharamukha
Message-ID: <CAODNnZi1ya+Up7MHs-Kp=mN-vfDoS4hXb8rR80wdm20nT=UgmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all
Here is Aksharamukha by Vinodh Rajan:

I have done a major update to Aksharamukha. The UI has been completely
reformatted to look very modern (and mobile-friendly) and the backend has
been rewritten in Python.

The new converter can be now reached at http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/

Aksharamukha now supports 66 scripts that fall within the greater Indic
cultural sphere.

You can see a comparison here:
http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/#/script-matrix/

You can read sample Texts (in Sanskrit/Pali) in all of the 66 scripts.
http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/#/texts/nilakantha

It has additionally individual script pages (showing the vowel/consonant
repertoire), view syllabaries, conjuncts and even play some games to learn
different scripts.
