[INDOLOGY] Updates and new look of Aksharamukha
Dear all
Here is Aksharamukha by Vinodh Rajan:
I have done a major update to Aksharamukha. The UI has been completely
reformatted to look very modern (and mobile-friendly) and the backend has
been rewritten in Python.
The new converter can be now reached at http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/
Aksharamukha now supports 66 scripts that fall within the greater Indic
cultural sphere.
You can see a comparison here:

You can read sample Texts (in Sanskrit/Pali) in all of the 66 scripts.

It has additionally individual script pages (showing the vowel/consonant
repertoire), view syllabaries, conjuncts and even play some games to learn
different scripts.
