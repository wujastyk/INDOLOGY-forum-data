Dear Friends, The *Bha??ik?vya* has an especially recherch? verb form in
2.35: '*vyatiste*'. Both Jayama?gal? and Mallin?tha understand it as 'as'
?tmanepada, emphatically illustrating P??ini 1.3.14 (*kartari
karmavyatih?re*). The r?k?asa M?r?ca has just said that killing brahmins is
his dharma, and that he is not allowed to follow a Vedic lifestyle. R?ma
responds that his own dharma contrasts, namely to kill him in turn [see
below], i.e. reciprocity of action. Whitney seems to think he has seen an
?tmanepada form of 'as' 3 pl. 'asate' in the Mah?bh?rata somewhere, but I
can't locate it. Here is the *Bha??ik?vya* verse:
*dharmo ?sti satya? tava r?k?as?yam anyo vyatiste tu mam?pi dharma?/*
*brahmadvi?as te pra?ihanmi yena r?janyav?ttir dh?tak?rmuke?u?//* (2.35)
My question=has anyone ever come across a comparable form?
Thanks as always, bhavad?ya?,J
