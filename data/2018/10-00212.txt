[INDOLOGY] Dating of the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad
there is a mention of Steven Lindquist's "lines of descent and dissent"
published in "religions of south asia" 5. it is available in equinox
website for a price.  Brian Black's "Rethinking the Upanishadic Vamshas" is
also published in the same thing. I would be glad to read both. I hope you
will help me.
