[INDOLOGY] India in Greece by Edward Pococke (19th century)
Thanks to Dan Lusthaus and others for looking into this question. As I 
had suspected, it seems that Pococke was not an early Indologist, but 
rather what used to be called an 'antiquarian'. And yes, there was a 
17th-century scholar, rather more well-known, of the same name.
Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
