Just a note that is it certainly untrue that South Asia lacks living traditions involving consumption of psychedelic plants; shamans in Nepal, for example, have a rich and diverse tradition of using dozens of such plants.  On this, see the following excellent and heavily photo-documented book:  *Shamanism and Tantra in the Himalayas* by Claudia Mu?ller-Ebeling; Christian Ra?tsch, 2002.
