Dear friends,
Might anyone have current contact information for Vijayar?ja Vajr?c?rya, who was affiliated some years ago with the Central Institute for HIgher Tibetan Studies in Sarnath? He is not now listed on the CIHTS website. (I imagine that the usual romanized spelling of his name is Bijay Raj Bajracharya, a name that seems relatively common in Nepal.)
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
