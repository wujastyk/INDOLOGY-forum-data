Is there such a thing as a specialized Sanskrit glossary for different 
food products, particularly grains and pulses? If such resources exist, 
I'd be very grateful if anyone could point me in the right direction.
Also, does the term /mudr? /in the sense of 'fried grain' actually occur 
outside of Tantric contexts, for instance in cookbooks?
