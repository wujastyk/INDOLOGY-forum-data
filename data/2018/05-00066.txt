Subject: [INDOLOGY] Death of Luise Anna Hercus (nee Schwarzschild) (1926-2018)
Message-ID: <EAF95573-AED6-44AA-A50E-012BF5C86EA8@gmail.com>

Dear colleagues

I have today attended the very well-attended ceremony to mark the passing away of Luise Anna Schwarzschild (LA Hercus) a few weeks ago?Luise's exemplary and important work on the grammar of Middle Indo-Aryan dialects spanned many decades until the mid- to late-1970s. Luise was a mainstay of the teaching of Sanskrit and Prakrits at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra for many decades; her quirky, engrossing and inspiring classes will be remembered by any who had the good fortune to sit in on them.
