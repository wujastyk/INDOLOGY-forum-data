Dear all;

I?m wondering if any list members might have information on the Ko?kan?bhyudaya by S?garar?m?carya. B.N.K. Sharma makes extensive use of it in his history of M?dhva Ved?nta, but, as far as I can tell, makes no mention of bibliographic information or which manuscript libraries may hold copies of the text. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
