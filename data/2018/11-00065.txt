[INDOLOGY] South Asia Books
Yes they still seem to be on Amazon. Amazon has unfortunately completely
blocked Australian customers so I needed to contact them directly to obtain
a copy of "Vedic Sakhas" - one of the volumes in the HOS - Opera Minora
series edited by Prof Witzel.
Numerous attempts to phone and email them has been fruitless so I will just
have to wait until I'm next in the States to try to get a copy! It's
disappointing when scholarly book distributors exclusively park their
business with Amazon.
Kind regards,
Antonio

S. A. Books still has a presence on Amazon. I am pretty sure I purchased
from S. A. Books, ordered via Amazon, in the last year.  It's possible they
(whoever "they" may be now) have moved to an online only store.
