Yes they still seem to be on Amazon. Amazon has unfortunately completely
blocked Australian customers so I needed to contact them directly to obtain
a copy of "Vedic Sakhas" - one of the volumes in the HOS - Opera Minora
series edited by Prof Witzel.

Numerous attempts to phone and email them has been fruitless so I will just
have to wait until I'm next in the States to try to get a copy! It's
disappointing when scholarly book distributors exclusively park their
business with Amazon.

Kind regards,
Antonio
Brisbane, Australia
