[INDOLOGY] Mbh stratification
Dear Oliver,
As a retiree of - already - some seniority, I have difficulty in ingesting
phraseological solids, such as <<neural networks digesting all kinds of
linguistic features and making temporal predictions based on them>>.
Could you please explain what hides behind these scholarly terms?
Regards,
Artur
