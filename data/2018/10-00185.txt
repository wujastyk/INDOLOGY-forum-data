Dear Oliver,

As a retiree of - already - some seniority, I have difficulty in ingesting
phraseological solids, such as <<neural networks digesting all kinds of
linguistic features and making temporal predictions based on them>>.

Could you please explain what hides behind these scholarly terms?

Regards,

Artur
