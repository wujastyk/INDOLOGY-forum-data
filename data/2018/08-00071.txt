Dear Prof. Lusthaus,

A greatly impressive show of truly impressive erudition - demonstrated by
selecting & quoting the equally erudite inputs of the MPS commentators *re*
kamm?raputta and s?karamaddava.

Nothing to add from my side.

However - the question of the basic question, and that is: how to call the
practice of making the translated texts as elegant as possible? Of - sort
of - beautifying them? Even at the cost of losing some of their original
meaning/purpose?

Hyperglossia - as suggested by Matthew Kapstein?

> The Suttanip?ta <http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/suttanipata.html> Commentary
