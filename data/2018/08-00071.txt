[INDOLOGY] A terminological question
Dear Prof. Lusthaus,
A greatly impressive show of truly impressive erudition - demonstrated by
selecting & quoting the equally erudite inputs of the MPS commentators *re*
kamm?raputta and s?karamaddava.
Nothing to add from my side.
However - the question of the basic question, and that is: how to call the
practice of making the translated texts as elegant as possible? Of - sort
of - beautifying them? Even at the cost of losing some of their original
meaning/purpose?
Hyperglossia - as suggested by Matthew Kapstein?
