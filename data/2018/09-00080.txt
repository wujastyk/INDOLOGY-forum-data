Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] go??h?

My mail inadvertently was sent before I could finish my communication. I apologize. Here is the rest of my message.


The term "go??h?" appears frequently in the ??stras of n??ya and denotes a group dance with music and some acting. Here are some references:

 "Go??h?' appears as a form of de??n??ya in Dattila, quoted in Sa?g?tan?r?ya?a (3. 15-18); V?tsy?yana, in his K?mas?tra mentions "go??h?" along with hallisaka and n??yar?saka and prek?a?aka as minor dramas or dance dramas (II.10.25);  Agnipur??a also mentions "go??h?" without any detail. Bhoja first identified it as a minor drama in which K???a dances with gopis (???g?raprak??a, vol II, p. 468 in V. Raghavan, Madras,1963). R?macandra and Gu?acandra, Hemacandra, V?gbha?a, S?garanandin, S?rad?tanaya, Vi?van?tha and ?ubha?kara all include go??h? in their list of minor dramatic types that require song and dance. Vi?van?tha of the14th century identified minor dramatic types that included music and dance as upar?pakas. (See Bose, Mandakranta. Movement and Mimesis. Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991 for further details. p. 181).
I am sorry that my email is working erratically. I hope this time it reaches in correct form.

I should appreciate it if someone could direct me to any papers written on the Sanskrit word go??h? or ?the gentlemen?s club? in ancient India.
Many thanks in advance.
Best,
Ken
