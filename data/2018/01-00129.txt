[INDOLOGY] "Caste passing"
In contemporary narrative literature including the narratives in Indian
films, there is a formula: A person born into a caste considered as
panchama (harijan /sc/ dalit in contemporary parlance) being brought up by
a 'upper' caste (usually a Brahmin) social reformer to become a Vedic
scholar or a brahmanical dancer/ musician (if the person brought up is a
woman) and after getting acceptance of the society, in a twist of the
narrative, the actual identity of the person getting exposed, the reformer
getting ridiculed by his neighbourhood , the reformer arguing about the
actual character being more significant than birth and the 'caste passing'
person getting accepted by the neighbourhood.
