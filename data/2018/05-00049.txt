O Kr???a, if acting in your play is so delightful, then engage me in your
play again and again.

O Kr???a, we are the sounds coming from your flute.  O M?dhava, delighting
in ourselves, how should we not always be happy?
??????????? ???????????? ??????????: ????? ???? ?

You are the blazing fire and we are the sparks rising from you and flying
around and coming back to you, O Kr???a.

On your stage of the world, O Lord, you created us with love, and for your
pleasure, we will do what you want us to do.

We will carry out your words, as Arjuna said after listening to your advice
on the battlefield, and as he took refuge in you.

You and I are two birds sitting on the same branch, O M?dhava.  You are the
older brother and I am the younger.

O Kr???a, with your strong wings you touch the sky.  With a confused mind,
I am still sitting on the branch.
??? ????? ????????? ???? ?? ?????????? ?
????? ?? ?????? ?? ?????: ?????????? ???? ???????
Having left the branch, how will I move in the sky?  O M?dhava, is there
strength in my wings?

Seeing you roaming in the sky, if I were to try and fall, then who will
save me from the fall?
??????? ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ?
???? ??? ???? ????????????? ??????: ???????
If you are ready to save me, then i will try to fly in the sky.  Watch me
flying into the sky without falling here and there.

You are my brother, O Kr???a, and I am fortunate to have you as my brother.
O M?dhava, always have your compassionate gaze on your brother.

In your play in Gokula, I was your friend in stealing yoghurt.  But you ate
all the yoghurt that I had stolen.

O Lord, what is the benefit of becoming your friend?  Give me half of what
you stole, O Kr???a.

It was your theft, and I was caught.  Is this right, O Kr???a?  Please
quickly free me caught for the theft.
