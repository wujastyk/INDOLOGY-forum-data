Continuing with my Krishna verses:

???? ?? ????? ?????????????????? ?

???? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???: ???: ???????

O Kr???a, if acting in your play is so delightful, then engage me in your
play again and again.


?????? ?? ??????? ???????? ?????? ???? ?

??????????: ????????: ??? ????? ? ???? ???????

O Kr???a, we are the sounds coming from your flute.  O M?dhava, delighting
in ourselves, how should we not always be happy?


??????????? ???????????? ??????????: ????? ???? ?

?????? ????????: ????? ??????? ????????: ???????

You are the blazing fire and we are the sparks rising from you and flying
around and coming back to you, O Kr???a.


???????? ????????? ????? ???????? ??????????: ?

?? ???????? ????????? ????? ???????? ???????

On your stage of the world, O Lord, you created us with love, and for your
pleasure, we will do what you want us to do.


???? ?? ????????? ??? ????? ???????? ?

?????: ????????????? ?? ??????? ???? ??: ???????

We will carry out your words, as Arjuna said after listening to your advice
on the battlefield, and as he took refuge in you.


????????? ????????? ? ???? ? ???? ?

?????? ??????? ???? ???????: ??????? ?????????? ?? ???????

You and I are two birds sitting on the same branch, O M?dhava.  You are the
older brother and I am the younger.


?????????? ?? ?????????? ??: ??????? ???? ?

????????? ??????? ?????: ??????????????: ???????

O Kr???a, with your strong wings you touch the sky.  With a confused mind,
I am still sitting on the branch.


??? ????? ????????? ???? ?? ?????????? ?

????? ?? ?????? ?? ?????: ?????????? ???? ???????

Having left the branch, how will I move in the sky?  O M?dhava, is there
strength in my wings?


???????? ???? ???????? ??????? ?????? ??? ?

??????? ????:?????? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? ???????

Seeing you roaming in the sky, if I were to try and fall, then who will
save me from the fall?


??????? ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ?

???? ??? ???? ????????????? ??????: ???????

If you are ready to save me, then i will try to fly in the sky.  Watch me
flying into the sky without falling here and there.


????????????? ?? ????? ????? ???????? ?? ?

???? ?? ??????????????? ??????? ???? ???????

You are my brother, O Kr???a, and I am fortunate to have you as my brother.
O M?dhava, always have your compassionate gaze on your brother.


?? ???????????? ????? ???????? ?

????? ?????? ????? ?????? ?? ????? ??? ???????

In your play in Gokula, I was your friend in stealing yoghurt.  But you ate
all the yoghurt that I had stolen.


?? ?????? ?? ???? ???????? ??????? ?

????????? ????? ????? ?????? ???? ?? ??? ???????

O Lord, what is the benefit of becoming your friend?  Give me half of what
you stole, O Kr???a.


?????? ?? ??????????? ???????? ??? ?????????? ?

??????? ???????? ??? ????? ???? ??????? ???????

It was your theft, and I was caught.  Is this right, O Kr???a?  Please
quickly free me caught for the theft.
