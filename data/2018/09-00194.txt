[INDOLOGY] India in Greece by Edward Pococke (19th century)
Since the author of India in Greece lived 2 centuries later than the same-named Edward Pococke (17th c), the links I sent are moot - unless the 19th c name is a deliberate pseudonym drawing on his illustrious predecessor. Perhaps one of Urs Apps? books on the western discovery of Buddhism ? e.g. The Cult of Emptiness. the Western Discovery of Buddhist Thought and the Invention of Oriental Philosophy (2014); or The Birth of Orientalism (Encounters with Asia) (2010) ? has some information on the 19th c figure. I don?t have them on hand at the moment.
