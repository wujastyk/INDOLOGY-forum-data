[INDOLOGY] New Book
Dear All:
Want to bring to your attention a new book edited by me and Don Davis in the series ?The Oxford History of Hinduism?: ?Hindu Law: A New History of Dharma??stra.? We had a wonderful and long list of contributors.
Here is the OUP website, which also gives the table of contents that also lists the contributors of various chapters:

Here is the Amazon link. The Kindle version is available right now, but the hard copy version will be available on Feb 14.
