[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit grammatical terms
Dear McComas,
If I recall correctly, thematic and athematic were first employed by European Sanskritists on the basis of a perceived analogy with Greek. There is no corresponding traditional distinction.
best,

[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit grammatical terms
Dear Friends
A Cambodian colleague is translating Gonda's grammar of Sanskrit into Khmer. She would like to use Sanskrit grammatical terms where possible.
She is asking for help with the following terms:
present stem
thematic and athematic verb classes
If some kind person could respond to me, I'll forward the information to her.
With thanks in advance
Yours
McComas
