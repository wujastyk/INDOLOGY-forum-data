Dear Lubomir-ji,
avy?pi vyaktam, vy?py avyaktam / puru?o'pi vy?p? yad? prak?ty? mukta? /
yukta? cet vyaktena sad??o  na pradh?nena / hi sarvad? dev?di?u pravartate /
yad? prak?ty? mukta? is just solving a logical problem.
As long as  puru?a is bound with  prak?ti, it has the features of prak?ti.
Since  prak?ti is  avy?pi ,   as long as  puru?a is bound with  prak?ti ,
puru?a  is also avy?pi. But being  vy?pi  is the nature of   puru?a . When
is this nature  puru?a found? When it is not bound to  prak?ti .
