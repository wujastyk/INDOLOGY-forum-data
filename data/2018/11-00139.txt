[INDOLOGY] Request for identification of two manuscripts
Dear Dr. Patel,
The first work is the Pr?kr?tapi?gala (or Pr?kr?tapai?gala), which is
available in a very nice edition by Bhola Shankar Vyas from 2007. It is a
work of Chanda???stra, although its language is generally more Apabhramsha
than Prakrit.
