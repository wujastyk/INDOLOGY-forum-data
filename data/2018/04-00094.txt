[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit verse today
I am told by a few friends that they see in the second line of my verse the
word "mukt?duyati?".  The Devanagari on my MacBook clearly reads
"mukt?dyuti?."  So there is some issue in how Devanagari Unicode typed on a
MacBook gets displayed elsewhere.  I don't have a way of solving this
dilemma.  I would appreciate if anyone has suggestions.  Best,
