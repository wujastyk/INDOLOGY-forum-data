"The Vaidalyaprakarana provides a rare glimpse of the sophisticated
philosophical exchange between Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools at an
early stage and will be of interest to scholars of Buddhist thought,
classical Indian Philosophy, and the history of Asian thought.
Belonging to a set of Nagarjuna?s philosophical works known as the
yukti-corpus, the Vaidalyaprakarana is noteworthy for its close engagement
with the Hindu philosophers. It refutes the sixteen categories of the
Nyaya school, which formed the logical and epistemological framework for
many of the debates between Buddhist and Hindu philosophers.
The Sanskrit original of the Vaidalyaprakarana long lost, the author
translates the text from Tibetan, giving it an extensive analytical
commentary. The aim is twofold: to investigate the interaction of the
founder of the Madhyamika school with this influential school of Hindu
thought; and to make sense of how Nagarjuna?s arguments that refute the
Naiyayika categories are essential to the Madhyamika path in general.?
?This translation of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna?s Vaidalyaprakara&#7751;a is an
important contribution to Madhyamaka studies, to our understanding of the
history of debates between early Indian Mah&#257;y&#257;na philosophers
and their orthodox interlocutors, and to the history of world philosophy
generally.?
