[INDOLOGY] Date of the Tolkappiyam
It was my impression that, like many older Indian works (cf. the Vy?sa Mah?bh?rata, the Rig Veda, probably the N??ya??stra), the Tolk?ppiyam is a collection of things that may have been composed at different dates. Some parts may be quite early, some later, but I would be pretty surprised if anything in the work is as late as the 9th century. My opinion is that parts of the work may go back to (or mirror/be influenced by) things as early as the 1st century BCE (and conceivably even earlier) while other parts may be as late as the 3rd or even 4th century CE. Burnell's work relating the Tolk?ppiyam to the Sanskrit Aindra (On the Aindra School of Sanskrit Grammarians: Their Place in the Sanskrit, available on Google) is important. One might note that P??ini describes things that are earlier than the Sanskrit used when he composed his work ? I am not a vaiy?kara?ika, but I am sure people on this list can speak to this. The writers of grammars, whether in Sanskrit or Tamil, do not appear out of thin air. George
