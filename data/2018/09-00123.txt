Dear Jacob,
This is a common feature in colophons and is often found with genitives to indicate for whom the manuscript was copied. Scholars of Jainism would know better than I any particular connoted performance contexts, but in general this can mean for both study and recitation (at least in the case of non-Jain manuscripts).
Best,
