[INDOLOGY] Details about author and work
Dear Krishna Prasad,
When I read your message, I immediately thought Apa must mean Apar?rka, aka Apar?ditya, a later commentator on the Y?j?avalkyasm?ti. But something doesn?t seem right.  Apar?ditya?s commentary was edited and published in the ?nand??rama series.  To my knowledge, Ganapati Sastri edited the Y?j?avalkyasm?ti with the commentary of Vi?var?pa through the Gov?t Press in Trivandrum in 1921.  The Nirnaya Sagar edition by Narayana Ram Acharya contains the commentary of Vij??ne?vara.
Not sure this helps, but I?d be curious to learn of an edition by Ganapati Sastri in Nirnaya Sagar.
Best, Don
