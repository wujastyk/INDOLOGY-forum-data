[INDOLOGY] Deccan College sanskrit ditionary
Dear Dan,
     Thanks for these two references to apavyayam?na in old texts.  I just
checked Kangle's translation of the Artha??stra passage and he translates
this as "if the officer denies all charges."  I did find the ManuS, 8, 51.1
<https://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=22912>
 arthe *'pavyayam?na?* tu kara?ena vibh?vitam / in Patrick Olivelle's
critical edition, with numerous alternative readings.  I don't have his
translation at hand, but Buhler translates this as "But him who denies a
debt which is proved by good evidence."  So it looks like in both passages,
the meaning of apavyayam?na is something like "one who denies charges."
This is very different from the meaning of apavyaya as wasteful or improper
use of money or time which it has in modern languages like Marathi, and
which some of the Sanskrit dictionaries are reporting without a citation
from a classical text.  Some of these expressions are re-entering Sanskrit
in the modern usage of Sanskrit in meanings these expressions have in
modern languages.
