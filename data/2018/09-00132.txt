[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
Dear Camillo,
change. Or am I wrong and 'Sanskrit literature and the ideas contained
directly, but you are telling me I'm wrong.
Yes, I agree fully, Sanskrit (literature and the ideas contained therein)
can *help* tackle, and not directly tackle, issues such as climate change
ni which a larger perspective is useful.
To make it clear, in spite of the context I tried to give in my initial
mail (which I still think is the aspect we *should* be focussing on to make
this debate fruitful!), I do NOT think that the sentence
'Sanskrit can tackle climate change'
can meaningfully be used as phrased.
All the best,
   Antonia
