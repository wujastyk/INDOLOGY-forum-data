[INDOLOGY] Indian Council of Philosophical Research orders postponement of conference on religious pluralism because 'there are some papers on tribal religious practices, some papers are by foreign scholars.'
In yet another disturbing development, an academic conference at JNU has
been cancelled by the Indian Council of Philosophical Research on the
grounds that it included papers on tribal religion and papers to be
delivered by foreigners.  This is shameful.  The ICPR head, Prof. S. R.
Bhatt, defended the decision with a series of transparently feeble
arguments.

I was shocked to learn that JNU even had to submit conference planning to
the ICPR for vetting and approval in the first place.  It is a fundamental
tenet that a university should be intellectually independent.
