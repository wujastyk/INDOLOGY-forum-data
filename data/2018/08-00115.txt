The love between a father-in-law and a son-in-law, bound with which they
will not leave each other, is rare in the world.

[However], Vishnu resides with Lakshmi [= m?] on the ocean, the home of his
father-in-law. Shiva too resides with Uma on the Himalaya mountain, the
home of his father-in-law.

Lakshmi [= m?] does not abandon the ocean and go somewhere else.  [Similarly],
Uma does not abandon the Himalaya and go somewhere else.
