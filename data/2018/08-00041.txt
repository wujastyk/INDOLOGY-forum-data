[INDOLOGY] A terminological question
Dear Artur,
The term "hyperglossia," as introduced by Pollock in his
The Language of the Gods in the World of Men,
refers to this phenomenon, though I am not sure how widespread this usage is. Pollock seems to have treated it as a neologism.
If I understand just what you are talking about, James Strachey's translations of Freud -- e.g. his rendering of "das Ich" as "the ego" -- may serve as a modern example. You may therefore find other terms for what you are looking for by digging into the critical literature on Strachey's translations.
good luck,
Matthew
