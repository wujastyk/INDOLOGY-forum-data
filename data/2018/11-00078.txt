[INDOLOGY] Cologne online Sanskrit dictionaries new interface (also for Pune, Apte, etc.)
Dear all,
It has come to my attention over the past year or so that the new interface
for Cologne's dictionary tool may not be very well known, although it
represents in my opinion quite a healthy leap forward in coverage and
usability. For example, I searched the Indology list archive but couldn't
find any mention of it at all. Does anyone perhaps know a reason why this
development happened so quietly?
Prof. Karin Preisendanz has given me permission to share the below
exchange, which may hopefully be of some instructional use to others, as
well.
Kind regards,
Tyler Neill
Re: Pune dictionary online
Dear Prof. Preisendanz,
You are correct, there is such a website. It is the Cologne one, most
commonly associated with the Monier-Williams dictionary.
The trick is to notice at the top of the home page ?
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/ ? the link to "Dec 2017", "new
display".
What this gives is:
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/simple-search/v1.0/list-0.2s.html
Then, in the "Dictionary" box where the page defaults to "MW", simply
change the code there, either by clicking with the drop-down menu or by
typing. The desired Pune dictionary is accessed with the code "PD". (Two
editions of Apte are also available, although my preferred digital
interface for that remains the trickier-to-use Chicago website, which
nevertheless allows not only a single-entry view
<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:4467.apte>
but also a page view
<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.3:226.apte>
.)
You'll notice that the search box even features auto-completion while one
types. I think you'll agree, this already useful resource has now become
significantly more powerful. For whatever reason, however, awareness of the
new interface remains low. I think I will forward our exchange on to the
Indology list, if you don't mind. I read it daily and also just now
searched the archive, but I haven't yet seen any trace of a proper
announcement.
With kind regards,
Tyler
