=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pa=E1=B9=ADhan=C4=81rtha_and_v=C4=81can=C4=81rtha?=
Dear Dominik,
I agree with your translations, of course, but wonder how "v?can?rtha" 
might be understood in the context of a gy?n b?z? game chart which can 
hardly be read out meaningfully. Perhaps the implied meaning is that it 
was to be used for playing/instruction.
Best,
Jacob
