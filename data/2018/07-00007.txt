I was going to mention Achaya's excellent food *Dictionary*, but Edeltraud
beat me to it.  Achaya also wrote *Indian Food: A Historical Companion*
(Oxford University Press, 1994), which has indexes.
Meulenbeld's HIML deals with P?ka??stra literature in volume IIB and
includes many, many terms and translations.
