Dear Toke, maybe the following passage from the N??ya??tra (2, 72cd-73ab) is of interest to you. It deals with the surface of the ra?ga??r?a:
k?rmapr???ha? na kartavya? matsyapr???ha? tathaiva ca
**?uddh?dar?atal?k?ra?** ra?ga??r?a? pra?asyate.
With kind regards, Herman

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Pur??as, "resembling the belly of a mirror"
Dear all,
I?m looking at some pur??ic passages where the expression ?resembling the belly of a mirror? occurs.
Li?gapur??a 2.28.47-48 (all references in this email are drawn from GRETIL) has:
?r?yat?? parama? guhya? vedikoparima??alam /
a??am??gulasa?yukta? ma?gal?kura?obhitam //
phalapu?pasam?k?r?a? dh?pad?pasamanvitam /
vedimadhye prakartavya? darpa?odarasannibham //
The verses speak of a diagram, ma??ala, to be drawn in the center of the altar, vedi. The expression darpa?odarasannibham, ?resembling the belly of a mirror,? is used with reference to the ma??ala.
Li?gapur??a 1.8.83 has:
atyantanirmale samyak supralipte vicitrite /
darpa?odarasa?k??e k????garusudh?pite //
The context is the location where a practitioner should engage in yoga. The expression darpa?odarasa?k??e, ?resembling the belly of a mirror,? is used to describe a characteristic the place should have.
The ?ivapur??a 7.2,29.11-13 has:
na tu prayogo bhidyeta vak?yam??asya karma?a? /
par?k?ya bh?mi? vidhivadga?dhavar?aras?dibhi? //
manobhila?ite tatra vit?navitat??bare /
supralipte mah?p???he darpa?odarasa?nibhe //
pr?c?mutp?dayetp?rva? ??strad???ena vartman? /
ekahasta? dvihasta? v? ma??ala? parikalpayet //
The context here is the ground on which the diagram, ma??ala, is placed. The expression darpa?odarasa?nibhe, ?resembling the belly of a mirror,? is used to describe the ground.
I?m interested in the image of a belly of a mirror used in the passages. The most obvious interpretation is that the image conveys something smooth, polished, and clean, as we would want a mirror to be; imperfections and dirt would distort the image we see in the mirror. I doubt that ?reflective? is meant, though ?shining? is a possibility.
My question is if the image could be used to indicate shape in some way? I doubt ?concave? or ?convex? shape is meant, but perhaps ?round? or ?flat??
With all best wishes,
Toke
