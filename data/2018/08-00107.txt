[INDOLOGY] Resources for commentarial interpretations of particles
Emeneau's article appeared in Indo-Iranian Journal IX (1969), pp. 241-68. Leendert van Daalen wrote a kind of rejoinder/addendum to this article, which, if I remember well, was published in IIJ as well. I must have it, but can't find it at the moment.

The article by Emeneau, entitled "Sanskrit syntactic particles ---
khalu, khila and nuunam", appeared, if I recall correctly, in JOAS in 1969.
I don't recall where Joel's article appeared.
