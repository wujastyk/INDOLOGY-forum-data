Thank you and everybody else for enlightening me on this.A proper interpretation of the term "Chodana" helps me to understand the arguments between Purva and UttarMimanshists system better.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Purva Mimansha
The s?tra reads:
codan?lak?a?o ?rtho dharma?.
codan? means injunction, especially Vedic injunction, and is often used as a synonym of vidhi. So dharma is something beneficial disclosed by a Vedic injunction.
