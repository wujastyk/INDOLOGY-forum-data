Thank you and everybody else for enlightening me on this.A proper interpretation of the term "Chodana" helps me to understand the arguments between Purva and UttarMimanshists system better.

The s?tra reads:



codan?lak?a?o ?rtho dharma?.



codan? means injunction, especially Vedic injunction, and is often used as a synonym of vidhi. So dharma is something beneficial disclosed by a Vedic injunction.
