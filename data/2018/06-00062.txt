Continuing my Krishna verses:

????????? ?? ???? ?????? ?? ???????? ?

??????? ?? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ???? ???????

Whether my eyes are open or closed, if I am immersed in your dark hue, how
could I see anything different?


???????????? ?????? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ?

????? ?????? ?????: ????? ?????? ????: ???????

Thinking that I am Kr???a, I assumed your name.  If M?dhava is Kr???a,
then, O Kr???a, you must be M?dhava.


??????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ???????? ???? ?

????????? ?????????????? ???: ?????? ????? ???????

O Kr???a, your uncontrolled dark hue catches everyone.  Even Arjuna, though
he did not know it, was transformed into you, O Lord.


?????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ?

????????? ?? ????????? ????? ? ??????? ???????

Those who claim to know do not, and those who do not claim to know do know.
 Such is the dark hue of yours and mine, O Lord.


????? ?? ?????????? ?? ????????? ????????? ?

????? ??? ??????? ? ?? ??? ?????: ???????

If my dark hue will merge into your dark you, O Kr???a, that will be a
great joyous occasion for me.


?????????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ???? ?

? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????

O M?dhava, your dark hue exceeds all other colors.  What else would a wise
person wish for, O Madhus?dana.


??????????? ??????? ??????????? ???? ?

?????? ????????????? ?????? ????? ???????

O Krishna, like the sky you cover the world with your compassion.  Like a
cloud you fill the earth with the rushing waters of your kindness.


????????????????? ????: ???????? ?

??????? ??????: ?????? ???? ?????????????? ???????

Quench the thirst of the world like water, O Cool Krishna.  Like the
life-giving breath, the wind, you enliven the whole world.


???? ?????? ??? ????????????? ??? ?

????????????? ????? ????? ???????? ???????

Like the earth, O Lord, you are the loving support of the world.  O Lord,
like the sun, sprinkle the earth with your brilliance.


???????????? ????????? ??? ?????? ???? ?

?????????? ???? ? ???????????????? ??? ??? ???????

You are the sky and you are the cloud and the water, O M?dhava.  You are
the wind, the earth and the sun, O Krishna.


????????? ?????? ??????? ???? ?

?????? ???? ?????? ?????? ????? ???? ??? ???????

Support of the World, O Krishna, these are your own forms, and holding
those forms you always take care of the earth.
