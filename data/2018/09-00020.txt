[INDOLOGY] Confession of ignorance and request for your kind advice
Namaste,
I understand Gujarati. 'bolisu' seems Gujarati, meaning, 'we will speak'.
I am a Gujarati and can read manuscripts with interlinear commentaries. I
can help you decipher the commentary in case you wish to share the MSS via
personal mail.
