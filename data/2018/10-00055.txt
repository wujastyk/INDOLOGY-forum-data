[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Dear List,
Regarding Soma, maybe  it would be useful to cite a Soma hymn.  I would
recommend RV 10.119, which I have translated and discussed and published in
several places.  I have been looking for a pdf file to send to the list but
I cannot find one right now.  In the meantime, it can be found in my paper
in the Frits Staal memorial volume and also in my EJVS paper already
cited.  If folks are having trouble finding these papers, I will try to
convert them to pdf files so that they can be sent by email.
Obviously, I like talking about Soma.  By the way, I was asked a number of
years ago to write a paper on Soma for a popular yoga journal here in the
US "Naamaruupa:Categories of Indian Thought"  [April 2007].  This was
written for non-specialists in Vedic and is more accessible than my
scholarly papers.
