My posting may be ignored since it concerns Tamil, not Sanskrit!!

In Tamil we have a proverb: 

?t?yaip pa?itt?lum ta???raip pa?ikk?t? (?????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????)? 
meaning, ?Don?t revile the water even if you revile your mother.? 

The well-known literature Tirukku?a? has a chapter on rain/water. 
Ancient Tamil poetry has some nice references in praise of water.
