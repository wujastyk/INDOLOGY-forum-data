[INDOLOGY] Continuing my Krishna verses
Dear All,
I am looking at ordination lineages within kammatic Theravada practices. I know Michael Aung-Thwin has written a lot on this from the Burmese perspective. Has anyone described parallel structures from the Sri Lankan side?
I am most grateful for suggestions,
Mary Storm
