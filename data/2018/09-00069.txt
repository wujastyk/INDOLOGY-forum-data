For some, Sanskrit , not some specific portions of its literature, is
toxic.

For some, Sanskrit,  not some specific portions of its literature is
amrita, ambrosia, nectar ,  a panacea.

Prof. David Shulman said, " Even in Sanskrit, it?s a misconception, I
think, that Sanskrit is built around this notion of tremendous power and
inequality. There?s an aspect of that, but I certainly wouldn?t think of
that as its major feature. Sanskrit?s a language, like any language.
Everything is in it. All of human life is in it! "

With regards to environmentalist understanding in Sanskrit, you have in
Gita:

??? ?????????? ????? ???????????? ?? ?

??????????????????? ???? ????? ? ????? ? ?-???
Those who do not follow/live as per the ecological cycle, such sensualists
are paapajeevis and they live a vain life (experiencing the harmful
consequences of not following the eco-cycle)

???????? ?????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ?

Creator , in the beginning created human beings along with the
(eco-friendly/nature nourishing/)sacrificial rituals and said through these
rituals get what you want;  these fulfil whatever you want

Through these nourish and nurture the devas (nature forces) and they
nourish and nurture you back. Thus 'treating' each other both you humans
and the nature forces , may you achieve the best of the welfare

Luxuries and pleasures that you want/like are provided by the devas (nature
forces) who get treated by your  eco-friendly/nature nourishing/sacrificial
organised actions; thus enjoy all the luxuries provided by them.

The Mann Ki Bath report by the news portal highlights one aspect of many
praises of Modi for Sanskrit. That praise has a context. Sanskrit week
celebration. A girl calls him from Bengaluru and speaks in Sanskrit.
---------------------------------------------------------

Modi recently said that Tamil is the most ancient Indian language and
received bashing from those who believe that Sanskrit of the Vedas, not
Tamil , is the most ancient language of India.

-------------

That article on coal has in fact some statements criticising Modi taking
the side of renewable energy sources.

Modi appears in that article in

India has plans for alternative means of generating electricity. Even
before the Paris summit, Narendra Modi, the prime minister, aimed to
install 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable-energy capacity by 2022, a vast
increase from today. That has now risen to 227GW.
and

Mr Modi may have thrown his weight behind solar and wind but, until other
forms of backup power, such as storage, become cheaper, the system will
still need coal to keep the lights on.

------

The links provided show that the article, not Modi or BJP, is in support of
continuing the use of coal. The links do not substantiate that Modi or BJP
have the view that "Climate change is a hoax, invented by left liberals ".
On the contrary, the first link provided proves that Modi considers climate
change is a problem and considers that texts in Sanskrit have a solution
for it.
