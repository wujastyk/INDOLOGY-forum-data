 Dear colleagues,

I was wondering whether any of you know of resources to recommend 
especially to students on commentarial interpretations of particles, 
especially api, ca, tu, eva, which function as connectives and logical 
operators. I am particularly interested in presentations of the range of 
options that are available from vy?kara?a analysis, and discussions of 
the metalanguage used (e.g. avadh?ra?a, samuccaya, sambh?van?, ati?aya 
...).

There is much material tucked away in footnotes to various publications, 
of course, there are helpful classics like Speijer's Sanskrit Syntax, 
there are some remarks in introductory textbooks and grammar works, and 
some efforts were made towards compiling patterns of commentarial 
language inTubb & Bose's "Scholastic Sanskrit" and in Angot's recent 
"Sanskrit commentarial", and there are articles dealing with specific 
particles and their logical implications (esp. eva), but I have not come 
across attempts to offer more comprehensive inventories of the terms 
??stric commentators use in interpreting particles.

Pointers would be much appreciated; I'll collect responses and post a 
list later.

With best regards,

Birgit kellner
