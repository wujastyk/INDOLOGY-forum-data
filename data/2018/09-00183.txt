Here is the paper, but it does not discuss the problem of ?a/kha.

Best,

Hence, for example, both the modern Nepali name Harkha (<--Har?a) and the modern Newar pronunciation and occasional orthography of the ?khe?ak?ar?? (= ?a?ak?ar?). Newars would have been speaking about these texts in Newari, of course, but using pronunciations that made sense in a linguistic and cultural milieu that connects them to Bengali, Maithili and so on.

But now it appears that this is not a "quirk" of Nepalese scribes but an instance of a wider phonologically motivated fusion?

But in kashta,vishnu,etc. It is pronounced as sha.Almost all over India it is pronounced as kha in Shuklayajusha. I would like to mention that in our Mithila(North Bihar) retroflex sha is not only pronounced in Shuklayajusha but in ClassicalSanskrit too pronounced as kha and also inMaithili Language( a modern Indo-Aryan).It would not be out of the context what I would say.It has been coming from the Indo-European period.There is a Russian parallel "snokhaa" which resembles Sanskrit "snushaa" but both have the same meaning i.e.grand daughter.RegardsGirish K.JhaRetd.
