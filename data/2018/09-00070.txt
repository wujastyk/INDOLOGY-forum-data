[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
May I make a plea, please?
I think all discussions of Sanskrit and Indology-related topics are
appropriate and welcome here.
I think discussions of world leaders (or non-leaders) when the topic does
not bear on Indology or Sanskrit (Tamil etc) are not appropriate here, no
matter how passionate you may be about that. There are plenty of other fora
for that.
Thank you keeping this a "safe space" for Indology (the scare-quoted
expression was meant as a little joke...)
