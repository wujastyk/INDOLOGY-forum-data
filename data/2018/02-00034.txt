Dear Arlo,
In A?oka's Minor Rock Edict 1, sentence C, we have a?h?tiy?ni/a?hatiy?ni vas?ni, or "two and a half years" (see P.K. Andersen, Studies in the Monor Rock Edicts of A?oka I. Critical Edition, Freiburg 1990).

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] go??la and ardhatrika
Thanks to all those who responded, on or off list, to my query on go??la etc. Here is another one:
I find ardhatrika in the meaning 'two and a half' in some inscriptions, but don't find the word in any dictionary I can access; some of the forms under CDIAL ardhat?t?ya to me rather look like they derive from ardhatrika.
Is there any Sanskrit dictionary (maybe the Pune Dict.?) with an entry ardhatrika that I am missing?
best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths

Dear Dr. Griffiths and colleagues,
gho?a "station of herdsmen" (MW); Pkt. ghosa "cowherd?s station" (for equivalents in modern languages, meaning "house", see CDIAL 4528) + -?la suffix (cf. AiG II, 2 ? 178c; cf. also i???la, ca???la, chinn?la etc.)?

Dear colleagues,
I am working with some inscriptions from 5th-century Bengal where it seems the word goh?la/goh?l? (ultimately from Sanskrit go??la) is used in the meaning 'hamlet', or in any case to indicate something larger than 'cow-shed'. But I have so far not found any dictionary, whether for Sanskrit, Prakrit or NIA wors, that gives clear support for any such meaning. The closest to anything like support is Sheth's Prakrit Dictionary, where the first meaning indicated for gos?la is de?avi?e?a. Can anyone help me determine on what textual passages this meaning is based? Can anyone cite other examples from any Indo-Aryan languages where a word related to Sanskrit go??la means something like 'hamlet'?
Thank you.
