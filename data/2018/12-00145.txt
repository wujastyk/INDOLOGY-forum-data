Subject: [INDOLOGY] How ancient DNA may rewrite prehistory in India

This may be true, but the multi-author article by Reich et al. does contain important new information. It may also be worth googling for Rakhigarhi and DNA, but in this case the problem is that absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. Moreover we have to keep in mind that genetics/ethnicity and language don?t necessarily dovetail

All the best for what promises to be an interesting New Year

This article has nothing new for the New Year from the author. He has been writing on the same lines for a long time in his news paper columns:

https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Tony-Joseph-1094/

What is new is that these writings of him have all been compiled into a book and there is a lot of publicising work going on for this book all around in the form of these article.

No nationalist anywhere in the world likes to be reminded the highest fact that all humans have migrated to different parts of the world from Africa.

This knowledge of ???? ??? ?????is to be spread to enlighten and elevate all humans from their national or other identities are just Maya and African origin all humans is the only reality.

Dear Jarrod,

     Thanks for posting the link for this interesting article.  Research and politics will both continue unhindered.  Not to worry.  I am curious as to how the politics in Pakistan responds to such new findings about the Indus Valley.  With best wishes,
