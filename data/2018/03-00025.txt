[INDOLOGY] Abhidharmakosa(bhasya) chapter 6 English translation by Poussin (Ridding/Thomas)
Louis de La Vall?e Poussin, on the first page of his Avant-propos to Tome
IV of his French translation of the Abhidharmako?a, refers to an English
translation of chapter 6 that he made in collaboration with Miss Ridding
and E. J. Thomas. Because of this collaboration, he says, the English
equivalents were very carefully researched. I have never been able to find
where this English translation of this chapter was published. Neither Leo
Pruden nor Lodro Sangpo give a bibliographic reference to it in their
English translations of Poussin's entire French translation. Can someone
point me to it? Thanks.
