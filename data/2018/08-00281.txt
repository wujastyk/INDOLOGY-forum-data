Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Works attributed to ?a?kar?c?rya

Dear Alakendu Das,
As you know, each of the ma?has started by ?a?kar?c?rya

 has a long line of adhipatis up to the present. Each adhipati also has the title 
?a?kar?c?rya. So there have been many ?a?kar?c?ryas

 after 


















?di ?a?kar?c?rya. The idea, then, is that the majority of the more than 400 works attributed to ?a?kar?c?rya

 are actually by later&nbsp;?a?kar?c?ryas, not by ?di ?a?kar?c?rya, even though they are usually taken to be by 
?di ?a?kar?c?rya.
A clear example of this is the Saundarya-lahar?, which has long been attributed to&nbsp;?a?kar?c?rya, meaning 
?di ?a?kar?c?rya. V. Raghavan found a manuscript of this work whose colophon stated that it is by&nbsp;?a?kar?c?rya, the adhipati of the Sarasvat?-p??ha at 
?r?vidy?nagara, i.e., a later 
?a?kar?c?rya. (See footnote 24 in The Saundaryalahar?

 or Flood of Beauty, edited and translated by W. Norman Brown, Harvard University Press, 1958, pp. 29-30.)

There are also known cases where a work written by someone else has somehow, over the years, gotten attributed to&nbsp;?a?kar?c?rya. An example of this is the Prabodha-sudh?kara. V. Raghavan showed of the basis of manuscript colophons, etc., that it was actually written by Daivaj?a S?rya Pa??ita. (See his article, "The N?simha Camp? of Daivaj?a S?rya Pa??ita and the N?simhavij??pana of 
?r?

 N?simh??ramin," Adyar Library Bulletin, vol. 1, 1937, p. 44.)
Best regards,

Mr.Reigle,
It was enriching going through your elaboration on Shankara's work.However,I find it interesting to know ,if 24 out of 408 works are actually by Shankara himself,then who composed the rest?
