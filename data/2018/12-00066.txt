[INDOLOGY] DCS data
Dear all,
the data of the DCS are now open source.
You find a download link and additional information on how to 
build/explore the database on github (folder dcs):
https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit
The user interface of the corpus will probably be migrated to a new 
server in the next weeks.
Best, Oliver
