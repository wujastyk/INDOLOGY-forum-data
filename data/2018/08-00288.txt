[INDOLOGY] An article on Kalabhras
Dear Indologists,
Someone mentioned to me that Suresh B. Pillai, the author of "Introduction to the Study of Temple Art" (1976), also authored an article on the Kalabhras. Does anybody know the reference? I would like a copy of the article, if available.
Thanks in advance
Regards,
Palaniappan
