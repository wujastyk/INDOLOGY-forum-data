[INDOLOGY] M.P. Pandit's citation of the Brihani Tantra?/Sastra?/Sutra?
In M.P. Pandit's "Bases of Tantra Sadhana" (page 32-33), he cites a text,
the "Brihani," which I am unfamiliar with and haven't been able to find a
single reference to anywhere else. Hoping someone in the list might be able
to shed some light on it. Many thanks.
His quote is as follows:
"Truth has no gender, but it is spoken of in terms of gender." -Brihani
attached is a photo of the page
