Subject: [INDOLOGY] M.P. Pandit's citation of the Brihani Tantra?/Sastra?/Sutra?
Message-ID: <CALBYX4VLAQt4iy6YOdEHO4DYDed=9rsF2JEdQ87rC8CuKZ8GtA@mail.gmail.com>

In M.P. Pandit's "Bases of Tantra Sadhana" (page 32-33), he cites a text,
the "Brihani," which I am unfamiliar with and haven't been able to find a
single reference to anywhere else. Hoping someone in the list might be able
to shed some light on it. Many thanks.

His quote is as follows:

"Truth has no gender, but it is spoken of in terms of gender." -Brihani

attached is a photo of the page

Best,
