[INDOLOGY] Sandhi of word final n
Hi Madhav,
I think I'm still a little unclear.
I follow this for  dev?n+tatra,
which changes into visarga and ultimately into s.
I.e. if n is before  ch, ?h, th, c, ?, or t   then n -> ru
dev?n+tatra ->  dev?ru+tatra ->   dev??+tatra  -> dev?s+tatra
The vowel before the n becomes optionally nasalized by P 8.3.2
I.e.  dev?s+tatra ->   dev??s+tatra, or dev?s+tatra  with nasalized vowel
The rule P 8.3.36 (v? ?ari)  says that a word-final visarga optionally
I.e.  dev??s+tatra ->  dev??s+tatra or dev??+tatra

I see how this applies to   dev?n+tatra but I'm unclear how we get from
amu?min+ stave to amu?mi?+stave since in this case the n is followed by s
and I don't see how rule 8.3.7 applies.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
