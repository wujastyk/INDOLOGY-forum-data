Dear Madhav,
Thank you for sending me this interesting text. V?dir?ja certainly doesn?t use the word bh?gola in the sense of ?the earth?s sphere,? a spherical earth at the center of the universe. I?m wondering what bh?gola means to him. The text goes beyond a description of terrestrial geography and includes, for example, a description of the region of the stars (nak?atragati; starting in verse 320) and a description of the various layers of the shell of the brahm???a is found toward the end of the text (starting in verse 345).
I wonder if V?dir?ja means the entire brahm???a when he uses the word bh?gola?
I see that V?dir?ja is a 16th-century Dvaita follower of Madhva.
Regarding the occurrences of bh?gola in the works of R?pagosv?min and J?vagosv?min, I agree that they probably go back to earlier uses of the word in texts they rely on. Going further, I wonder if their use of the word, along with the occurrences of the word in the G?tagovinda and the Gop?lat?pan?-upani?ad, can all be explained by the reliance of these texts and authors on the Bh?gavatapur??a (which uses the word five times)?
All best wishes,
Toke
