Dear Madhav,

Thank you for sending me this interesting text. V?dir?ja certainly doesn?t use the word bh?gola in the sense of ?the earth?s sphere,? a spherical earth at the center of the universe. I?m wondering what bh?gola means to him. The text goes beyond a description of terrestrial geography and includes, for example, a description of the region of the stars (nak?atragati; starting in verse 320) and a description of the various layers of the shell of the brahm???a is found toward the end of the text (starting in verse 345).

I wonder if V?dir?ja means the entire brahm???a when he uses the word bh?gola?

I see that V?dir?ja is a 16th-century Dvaita follower of Madhva.

Regarding the occurrences of bh?gola in the works of R?pagosv?min and J?vagosv?min, I agree that they probably go back to earlier uses of the word in texts they rely on. Going further, I wonder if their use of the word, along with the occurrences of the word in the G?tagovinda and the Gop?lat?pan?-upani?ad, can all be explained by the reliance of these texts and authors on the Bh?gavatapur??a (which uses the word five times)?

All best wishes,
Toke

However, the word "bh?ma??al?a" is used in the work of R?mad?sa in the 17th century: "?????????? ????? ???? ???? ??? ???? ??????? ??? ???."  "Ma??a?a" and "Gola" are also used in Marathi in conjunction with S?rya.
