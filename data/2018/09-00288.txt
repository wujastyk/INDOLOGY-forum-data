I should add, that like with a previous query, this is another case of an earlier and later figure sharing the same name (the later MAH?-Tipi?aka-C???bhaya is 12th c., while the earlier one described by Malalasekera is considered pre-Buddhaghosa). I don?t believe that Jaini, who edited the Milinda-??k?, identified the author of that commentary, but, since it cites Buddhaghosa, it must be by someone post-Buddhaghosa. Cf. http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an343601.pdf <http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an343601.pdf> 
Barua is quoting Walpola Rahula re: the 12th c Therav?din commentator who wanted to become a Buddha, with the reference: Walpola, R. 1971. L'ideal du Bodhisatta dans le Therav?da et le Mah?y?na. Journal Asiatique: 69.
I don?t have access to that Journal at the moment, so can?t check to see what sources Rahula was drawing on. Perhaps someone else has it on hand.
