Dear Colleagues,

You may be interested to see this new digitisation project just completed by the University of Edinburgh library team. It is a fully scrollable high resolution digital version of an 18th century scroll of the Mahabharata, with beautiful illustrations. You can see it at the following link:

A blog post on the project giving some more details can be found here: http://libraryblogs.is.ed.ac.uk/diu/2018/06/22/a-stitch-in-time-mahabharata-delivered-online/

With best wishes,
Naomi
