[INDOLOGY] brick-making communities
I have come across one case of incredible continuity from the Indus Civilization to the present day. On a mature Harappan potsherd from Amri in southern Indus Valley one can see two images of crocodiles who instead of hind legs have a 90 degrees sideways projecting extension reaching the ?ground?. I found an explanation to this puzzling picture from the crocodile cult of fifty tribal villages in southern Gujarat ? area once inhabited by Harappan people: wooden images of crocodiles installed on wooden posts are worshipped in sanctuaries that are now becoming neglected but are documented by Eberhard Fischer and Haku Shah in a booklet entitled ?Mogra Dev, tribal crocodile gods? (Ahmedabad 1971).
