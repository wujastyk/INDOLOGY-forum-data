I have come across one case of incredible continuity from the Indus Civilization to the present day. On a mature Harappan potsherd from Amri in southern Indus Valley one can see two images of crocodiles who instead of hind legs have a 90 degrees sideways projecting extension reaching the ?ground?. I found an explanation to this puzzling picture from the crocodile cult of fifty tribal villages in southern Gujarat ? area once inhabited by Harappan people: wooden images of crocodiles installed on wooden posts are worshipped in sanctuaries that are now becoming neglected but are documented by Eberhard Fischer and Haku Shah in a booklet entitled ?Mogra Dev, tribal crocodile gods? (Ahmedabad 1971). 
See pp. 25-29 in:
Parpola, Asko, 2011. Crocodile in the Indus civilization and later South Asian traditions. Pp. 1-57 in: Toshiki Osada & Hitoshi Endo (eds), Linguistics, Archaeology and the Human Past: Occasional Paper 12, Kyoto: Indus Project, Research Institute for Humanity and Nature. Reprinted 2012 as ?Current Studies on the Indus Civilization, vol. IX. New Delhi: Manohar.
Very briefly with two images (the Amri pot & Fischer?s photo of Devlimadi sanctuary) pp. 184-6 in:
Parpola, Asko, 2015. The Roots of Hinduism, New York: OUP.

Best regards, Asko

True, he was concerned more with science (and philosophy of science) than technology, but e.g. in his book History of Science and Technology in Ancient India (KLM 1986) there are several chapters devoted to bricks and brick-making.
