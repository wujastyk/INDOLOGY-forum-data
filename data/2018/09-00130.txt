[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
There are statements such as "Sanskrit is toxic" , "Toxicity of
Sanskrit" " once
the "toxicity", "extraordinary inequality" and "social poisons" of Sanskrit
'
to which
Prof. David Shulman had to respond saying,, " Even in Sanskrit, it?s a
misconception, I think, that Sanskrit is built around this notion of
tremendous power and inequality. There?s an aspect of that, but I certainly
wouldn?t think of that as its major feature. Sanskrit?s a language, like
any language. Everything is in it. All of human life is in it! "
