=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pronunciation_of_j=C3=B1?=
Dear Harry,
/j?/ is has been a very unstable sequence in India for a very long time, and its varying treatment can be traced in part through Prakrits (see Pischel?s Prakrit Grammar, ?88, ?119, ?303).  Already, in A?oka?s edicts we see a simple (very rarely doubled) /n/ (Kalsa in N, Dhauli in E) or /?/ (NW and far south) or /?/ (at Girnar) in forms like ?napayati or ??apayati, ?orders? (cf. Sanskrit ?j??payati), with [n] or [?];  Pali has /?/ (pronounced [ny]) initially and /??/ medially.
One can sum up by saying that the initial /j/ has a tendency to disappear, or to survive in a minimal way in western India as an unexploded /d/ ? that is, the beginning of a /j/ = [dzh/ without the fricative which is dropped before the [ny], OR realizing the /j/ with a velar stop instead.
The options by region, generally, seem to be [gy] with or without accompanying nasalization much of the Hindi belt, [dny] in Maharasthtra and thereabouts, and either [ny] or [gn]/[kin] in the Tamil sphere, where an epenthetical vowel is inserted to break up the cluster.  This also happens in northwestern India, where we get Ismaili works called gin?n (< j??na) from Sindh, Gujarat, and Panjab.
What does NOT seem to happen much is what Westerners today most often produce: j + epenthetical vowel + n
The regional variation is discussed (too) briefly on p. 78 of:
Chatterji, Suniti Kumar. 1960. ?The Pronunciation of Sanskrit?. Indian Linguistics 21, 61?82.
In my edition of the N?larudropani?ad (p. 87), I use the Maharashtrian pronunciation as diagnostic to identify the origin of a particular variant reading in the text:

I discuss the Prakrit and Tamil reflexes of the j? conjunct a bit here as well (on pp. 425?426):

[INDOLOGY] Pronunciation of j?
Dear list members,
I've been asked about the pronounciation of the conjunct j? .
Coulson writes:
"j?a: the pronounciation of this varies wid is that it is a palatalisation so to speak en bloc of an original gn,  In some places, for instance, it is like gya, in others dnya. . . . The point about j? is that it is a palatal isation so to speak en bloc of an original gn.. . . . Perhaps the most approprate of the modern pronunciations to adopt is therefore gnya which (by adding y to gn) thus crudely represent a palatalisation."
1) Is j?a  ever pronounced in India as jnya and if so where?
2) where in India are the different pronounciations Coulson lists (gya, dnya, gnya) located?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
