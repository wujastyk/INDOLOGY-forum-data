[INDOLOGY] Kashmir Shaiva and 'vernacular' - a question
H.C. Bhayani has an essay in vol. 1 of his "Indological Studies" (Ahmedabad
1993) titled "The Apabhra??a Passages from Abhinavagupta?s Tantras?ra and
Par?tri??ik?v?tti" (pp. 276?296), originally published in 1971 in Vidy? 14
(2): 1?18. There he attempts to correct/rewrite the 32 Apabhramsha passages
in the Tantras?ra are the 7 Apabhramsha sa?graha?l?kas in the
Par?tri??ik?v?tti. I don't have a soft copy, but he says there (p. 293)
?there is nothing specifically *dialectal *or *regional* or ?Kashmirian?
about Abhinavagupta?s Apabhra??a.? Prof. Bhayani also noted that the text
of these verses as printed in the KSTS edition (in 1918, when Apabhramsha
studies were in their infancy) is "a chaotic jumble of letters from which
it seems near-impossible to make out any connected verbal structure or
palpable meaning." I remember hearing that Paul Gerstmayr was working on
these verses at one point.
