I would like to add to Brendan's appreciation of Ole Pind. I never met him, but I and others have benefited immensely from his study of the fifth chapter of Dign?ga's Pram?nasamuccaya, which finally unlocks the mystery of apoha. It came out as his dissertation, under Prof. Steinkellner, in 2009 and was republished in 2015, with corrections (by Pind himself and also Steinkellner, after Pind became ill) by the Austrian Academy of Sciences in their Beitr?ge zur Kultur und Geistesgeschichte Asiens series. http://www.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/Literatur:2015_Pind It is a work of great erudition, the achievement of a generous and courageous intellect. Those who work in Indian Buddhist philosophy remain in his debt.

I am sad to learn of Ole's passing. Though I did not know him well, on the several occasions we met, it was a pleasure to be with him. I especially recall fondly spending an afternoon discussing Dignaaga and apoha with Ole at a cafe on the shore of Lac Leman, following a delightful conference on the topic of Apoha organized by the Tom Tillemans and Mark Siderits. I learned much from our conversation, as well as from various of his articles.

It is my sad duty to inform the list that Ole Holton Pind passed away on 13 December this year after a long illness. Funeral for those who can make it will take place at Lyngby Kirke on Friday the 21st of December at 13.00.
Ole was the editor of the Critical Pali Dictionary for many years and contributor of books and papers on Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist literature.
He was an accomplished violinist and a genuinely fine person in all respects.
