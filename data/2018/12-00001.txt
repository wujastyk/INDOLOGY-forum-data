[INDOLOGY] Continuing my Krishna verses
Continuing my Krishna verses:
During my flight from San Francisco to Amsterdam, I composed almost 50
Krishna verses. After my Gonda Lecture in Amsterdam yesterday, some
colleagues here wanted to hear my Krishna verses, and so I read some of the
newest ones to them. Now these will be added to my ongoing collection.
Today, I have my return flight to San Francisco, and I can only wait to see
how many more verses Krishna inspires during that flight.
