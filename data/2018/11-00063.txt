South Asia Books had clearly been struggling ever since the death of its founder, the historian of Sikhism Jerry Barrier, in 2010.  I did not know that it had finally closed.  It is a great loss.  Jerry had a booth every year at the annual meeting of the Association for Asian Studies.  It was a spot where scholars of South Asia met and exchanged news in addition to buying books.

Dear All,

recently there was a news item on this list that South Asia Books had shut down in July.

(They never told me though they distribute our HOS-OM books).  Does anybody know more?

A local colleague graciously drove by their location and here is the answer:

"I went by the address, and South Asia Books is completely gone. There is no longer a sign, and the store is closed and empty. ?

A mystery.
