[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Thanks to everyone for alerting me also offline to the missing picture!
Meanwhile I had to realize that others who had explored the secret
Himalayan Soma vendor cave (after me), made haste to publish it (before I
could), failing however to decipher and translate the inscriptional
caption. Anyhow, for those interested in the pre-?rauta early Aryan Soma
trade, here is the link for further research:
