[INDOLOGY] buddhiyuktena
Dear List members,
For the expression buddhiyuktena MW refers to the R?jatara?gi?i. I would like to know the exact place, but could not find the text in the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit. Could anybody help me with locating the instance in the text.
With the best wishes, Herman
