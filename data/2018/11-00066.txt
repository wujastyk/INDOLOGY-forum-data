[INDOLOGY] brick-making communities
Thank you, Julia!  That's very helpful indeed.  It's a literature I'm
completely unfamiliar with.
Is there a general opinion amongst SA archaeologists about the continuity
or otherwise of contemporary rural brickmaking with medieval, ancient or
very ancient brickmaking?
Best,
Dominik
