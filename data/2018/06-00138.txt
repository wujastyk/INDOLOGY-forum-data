However, the word "bh?ma??al?a" is used in the work of R?mad?sa in the 17th century: "?????????? ????? ???? ???? ??? ???? ??????? ??? ???."  "Ma??a?a" and "Gola" are also used in Marathi in conjunction with S?rya.

>> (2) Four philosophical texts use the compound word:
>>  (a) Mok?opaya (10th century) has dhar?gola and bh?gola (Roland Steiner kindly helped me with the references from this work)
>>  (b) Tattvacint?ma?i (12th century)
>>  (c) Ny?yasudh? (14th century)
>>  (d) Sa?khyas?travivara?a (a late commentary)
>> 
>> (3) The Gop?lat?panyupani?ad (13th century or later) uses the compound word bh?golacakra.
>> 
>> (4) The G?tagovinda (12th century) uses the compound word once.
>> 
>> (5) The Hariva??a uses it in one verse (a star-verse).
>> 
>> (6) Some Bengal Vai??ava works use the compound word; for example, the Gop?lacamp? of J?va Gosv?min (16th century) uses bh?migola once; R?pa Gosv?min (16th century) uses the compound word as well.
