Thanks Toke.  Thats a copyright violation.  Mark owns the copyright.  Also
be very careful about signing up to SCRIBD.  I signed up with them and when
I stopped my subscription they kept charging me even though I kept writing
to them that I had cancelled my account.  I eventually had to contact my
credit card company who then had to stop them charging my credit card.
