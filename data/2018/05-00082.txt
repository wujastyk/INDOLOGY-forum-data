[INDOLOGY] Meters measured by morae
Dear list members,
Can someone tell me if there is a sanskrit technical term for meters
measured by morae.  I don't mean the names of the individual meters such as
AryA etc.  But the sanskrit name for this type of meter (meters measured by
morae).
Thanks,
Harry Spier
