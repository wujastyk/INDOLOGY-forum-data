Subject: [INDOLOGY] Meters measured by morae
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFbRzaCJFJegLdZ__TmVcHQYY945pXDgD+-6W9TomzB_A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Can someone tell me if there is a sanskrit technical term for meters
measured by morae.  I don't mean the names of the individual meters such as
AryA etc.  But the sanskrit name for this type of meter (meters measured by
morae).

Thanks,
Harry Spier
