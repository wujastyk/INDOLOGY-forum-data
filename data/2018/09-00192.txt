Subject: [INDOLOGY] India in Greece by Edward Pococke (19th century)
Message-ID: <266525d4-a404-c67c-8de0-134e6db40cf8@gmail.com>

A colleague working on Hellenic religious reconstructionism recently 
came across an 1852 book by one Edward Pococke entitled /India in 
Greece: Truth in Mythology (Containing the Sources of the Hellenic Race, 
the Colonization of Egypt and Palestine, the Wars of the Grand Lama and 
the Bud'histic Propaganda in Greece)/. The book itself is available 
<https://archive.org/details/indiaingreeceort00poco> on Archive, and 
there is some information 
<https://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-no2007036969> on the author 
on WorldCat, but not much. Would anyone on this list happen to know more 
about Pococke and his work?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
