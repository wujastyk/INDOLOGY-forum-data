[INDOLOGY] sUcI-kaTAha-nyAya
Dear all,
I find this expression (s?c?-ka??ha-ny?ya) in an early 17th century mathematical commentary (K???a?s commentary on Bh?skara?s Bijaga?ita), and Monier Williams tells me that this is the ?rule of the needle and the caldron? by which easier things are done first. Can anyone tell me the story behind this expression, and also if you have met this phrase in other scholarly contexts?
any insights and references will certainly be helpful
yours,
Agathe
