Dear All,

Some on this list may be interested to know of a recently published book on
the Gau??ya Vai??ava tradition by my colleague Rembert Lutjeharms entitled *A
Vai??ava Poet in Early Modern Bengal: Kavikar?ap?ra's Splendour of Speech*.

Further information on the book is available here:
https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-vaisnava-poet-in-early-modern-bengal-9780198827108?cc=gb&lang=en


I have been informed that the code AAFLYG6 can be used for a 30% discount
when ordering the book from OUP's global website (oup.com).

Best wishes,

James
