G.P. Malalasekera?s Dictionary of P?li Proper Names offers the following.

3. C???bhaya.? A Thera of Sri Lanka and a well-known commentator; he was known as Tipi?aka-C???bhaya. He is several times quoted in the Commentaries (e.g., VibhA.11, 16; Vism.69, 394, 397). He had a prodigious memory. Once he shut three of the gates of Anur?dhapura <http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/anuradhapura.html>, allowing only one door for the use of those leaving the city. As each person went out he asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530). He was a contemporary of C??an?ga <http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/culanaga.html> (DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), with whom he held discussions. His description (given at the Lohap?s?da) (DA.ii.442) of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic. He once went with a company of monks on a pilgrimage to N?gad?pa <http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/nagadipa.html>. On the way he stayed in a monastery. One of his followers, who lacked self-control, made friends with another of like temperament in the vih?ra, and C???bhaya, seeing them laugh aloud, pointed out how truly the Buddha had said in the Dh?tusa?yutta that like joins with like. VibhA.457?f.

Is this commentary the same as the Milinda??k? published by the PTS, or a different commentary?  The Milinda-A??hakath? of U N?rada alias Mingun Zetavun Sayadaw that was written around 1948 and transcribed and published by me [Studia Philologica Buddhica, Monograph Series XIII, Tokyo, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, 1999] refers to the opinion of a Tipi?aka-C?l??bhayatthera on p.57.  I would appreciate any information on this monk and his commentary on Milindapa?ha. Is it available anywhere? Best,
