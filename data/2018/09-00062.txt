[INDOLOGY] The Sanskrit forgeries of Senarat Paranavitana
Coningham 1996 ("Passage to India? Anuradhapura and the Early Use of the
Brahmi Script" DOI <https://doi.org/10.1017/S0959774300001608>) cites two
Paranavitana publications.  I haven't yet read the Coningham article
specifically to see whether he has been misled.
