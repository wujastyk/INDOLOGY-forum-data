Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Sanskrit forgeries of Senarat Paranavitana
In-Reply-To: <DBDD0A90-FA64-4683-B1F9-8C305AD10076@uclouvain.be>
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cf8pchsSnhQqvQvgQNWkJ86msnd8UYNJOtJoC+PU-LPmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Coningham 1996 ("Passage to India? Anuradhapura and the Early Use of the
Brahmi Script" DOI <https://doi.org/10.1017/S0959774300001608>) cites two
Paranavitana publications.  I haven't yet read the Coningham article
specifically to see whether he has been misled.
