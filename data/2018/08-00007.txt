[INDOLOGY] K.L.V. Sastri bio data
This is the mail I received from
gerow at reed.edu 4 years back
Mr Prasad,
I woud be interested to know why you have become interested in KLV Shastri.
I studied K??ik? with him in Madras in the early sixties. He was then
retired, having taught Sanskrit at Presidency College, Madras for many
years. He is the author of several books on Sanskrit and related topics and
was honored with several learned titles. He was a close collaborator of V
Raghavan, then Professor of Sanskrit at the University. If you wish to
learn more about him I would suggest that you contact one of his sons,
notably Dr K V Ramesh, formerly Director of the Archaeological Survey, in
Mysore, or K V Padmanabhan, advocate, in Madras. Another of his sons, whose
name I have forgotten, taught Chemistry at Duke University for many years.
His son-in-law, KS Haridasa Bhat, was head of MGM College in Udipi and
founder (with Shivaram Karanth) of the Yakshag?na Kendra in Udipi.
Regards,
Edwin Gerow
Thanks
