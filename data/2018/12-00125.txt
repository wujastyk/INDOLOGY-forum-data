[INDOLOGY] Correction and updates of Nirnay Sagar Fonts
Dear Prof Krishnaprasad,
This evolution of your font is super to observe.
Madhav voted against the matra-gaps; I voted for them.  It's a hard choice,
but if you are really going for the look-and-feel of the NS fonts, then it
has to be admitted that they had such matra-gaps and that it's a key
feature of the NS fonts.  When viewing a page of writing from a normal
reading distance of 18" or so, these gaps are not really noticeable, but
subliminally - for me - they aid rapid, accurate reading.  I assume they go
back to scribal practice, where gaps between aksaras are normal.  I don't
know when the continuous matra line came into fashion.  Alessandro has made
an implicit argument for such a matra-gap, which is a feature of the
original font that he created for his 2015 Jayanta book

Regarding the multiple forms of da etc., modern font technology can help.
OpenType includes some "alternates" or "contextual alternates" features
that allow the user (or auto-select) to select from multiple versions of a
glyph.  But I'm sure you know this.  And it's only certain advanced
text-setting programs like TeX that allow one to access such features
easily (e.g., through fontspec <https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec?lang=en>,
manual part IV).
Such questions make me wish to consult Naik's classic work *Typography of
Devanagari <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6241715>* (3 vols, 1971 rev. ed.),
but I've never had access to a copy of this rare publication.
Best,
Dominik
