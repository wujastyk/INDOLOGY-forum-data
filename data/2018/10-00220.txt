After an interesting discussion about Draupad?'s marriage to the five P???ava brothers we are back again at German Indology and Nazism, the latter an interesting illustration of Patrick Mccartney's vyakti prati yukti/ argumentum ad hominem.

Dear Joydeep,
You are doing it again!
Which only confirms the aptness of my analysis at www.academia.edu/7378413<http://www.academia.edu/7378413> (last version with minor corrections 30-10-2018, pp. 9-12).
Point 1 of your representation of my argument is almost correct with one crucial distinction: this was never my objection but an observation.
Gradually, the points of your representation swim away from my brief analysis.
Until at points 5 and 6 it is diametrically opposed to the conclusions reached in my analysis (as it is very clear in my review
that I consider Love in a Dead Language (by Lee Siegel) and "Ypsilon" (by Hermann Weller) to be significant masterpieces).
