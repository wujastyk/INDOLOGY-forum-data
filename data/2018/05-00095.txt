[INDOLOGY] Spaces between words in Sanskrit manuscripts?
Dear McComas,
     This must have happened gradually after the Sanskrit Pundits were
exposed to English printing.  Even the early Sanskrit printed texts in the
form of pothis did not separate words.  I have many such old printed
materials.  I have attached a sample page.  If this practice continued into
early printing, it is simply because the printing style was copying the
writing style of the manuscripts.  I have photographs of a few texts that
were hand written by the famous Pandit Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar where I
do not see gaps between the words.  Early pothis of Vedic texts printed by
the Nirnaya Sagara Press also do not show any gaps between words.
