Dear Herman (if I may),

Thank you so much for this interesting passage, which I wasn?t aware of. In ?r?pati?s Siddh?nta?ekhara, there is another interesting passage in this regard:

?dar?odarasannibh? bhagavat? vi?vambhar? k?rttit?
kai?cit kai?cana k?rmap???hasad??? kai?cit saroj?k?ti?

?The venerable, all-sustaining [earth] is said by some to resemble the belly of a mirror; by others to resemble the back [that is, shell] of a turtle; and by yet others as having the form of a lotus.? (My rough translation.)

Here ?r?pati distinguishes the shape of a mirror?s belly from the shape of a turtle?s shell, like in the passage from the N??ya??stra.

I wasn?t sure about matsyap???ha, ?back of a fish.? I see that Asha Saxena, in ?Ancient Greek and Indian Theatre? (Delhi: Parimal Publications, 1997), citing Abhinavagupta?s commentary, explains that k?rmap???ha refers to ?a surface sloping on all sides like the back of a tortoise and a little raised in the centre,? and matsyap???ha refers to ?a surface sloping on both sides like the back of a fish and long in the centre? (p. 26). She holds that the shape of the ra?ga??r?a should be plane.

Abhinavagupta?s commentary reads: k?rmap???ham iti / samantato nimba? madhye ca vartular?pa? mandam / tatt?d?g eva madhye d?rghar?pa? matsyap???ham /

However, in ?A Historical and Cultural Study of the N??ya??stra of Bharata? by Anupa Pande (Jodhpur: Kusumanjali Prakashan, 1996), the author cites Subbarao as stating that ?k?rmap???ha? and ?matsyap???ha? mean convex and concave, respectively (p. 18).

It?s hard for me to see how one could get ?concave? from ?back of a fish,? and I think both shapes must be convex, sloping downward in some way, as Abhinavagupta has it.

Finally, D. R. Mankad in ?Hindu Theatre? (Indian Historical Quarterly, 8:3 (September 1932), 480-499) separates the two lines you cite: ?Surface should not be k?rmap???ha or matsyap???ha. Ra?ga??r?a, clean like the surface of a mirror, is praised? (p. 486).

It seems to me that the N??ya??stra contrasts three different shapes, two with a slope (both convex, I think, though it?s tempting to read the latter of them as concave) and one that resembles the belly of a mirror. The mirror shape is probably to be understood as flat here, not round.

With all best wishes,
Toke
