Unaware at his time of the *Bha??ik?vya *evidence, Whitney says that
"Middle forms from *as* are also given by the grammarians as allowed with
certain prepositions (*vi *+* ati*), but they are not quotable" (? 636 b,
p. 240). In contrast, Kielhorn (? 269, p. 86 f [German version]) and B?hler
(p. 102) in their respective grammars / textbooks quote full paradigms of
*as* in their active and middle voices, e.g. *asmi *: *he*, *asti *: *ste*,
etc., with Kielhorn adding the remarkable remark that "als Hilfsverb auch
?[tmanepada] im Ind. Praes." (occurs as an auxiliary also in the present
indicative in the middle voice).
