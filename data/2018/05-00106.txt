[INDOLOGY] Spaces between words in Sanskrit manuscripts?
Dear All,
The Spitzer Manuscript, one of the oldest Skt manuscripts (of the  
Kushana period), regularly uses spaces between sentences.
It also uses special "viramic" forms of letters such as t or m in the  
end of sentences.
I think the same is true for the so-called "Dramenhandschrift", but am  
unable to check now.
The non-application of sandhi in the end of sentences is indeed very common.
Best wishes,
Eli
