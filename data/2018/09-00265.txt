=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]=09Why_there_is_no_Padap=C4=81=E1=B9=ADha_for_this_mantra?=
The other two recensions of the ?gveda sa?hit? that are now available in
print have bearing on this question, the ??val?yana ??kh? and the ???kh?yana
??kh?. Both of them give a padap??ha for verse 7.59.12. What we do not know
is whether the padap??ha for this verse was actually found in the 16
manuscripts of the ??val?yana padap??ha used by B. B. Chaubey for his
edition, or in the 17 manuscripts of the ???kh?yana padap??ha used by Amal
Dhari Singh Gautam for his edition.
B. B. Chaubey says (p. 57) that he himself supplied the padap??ha for the
212 verses of the ??val?yana ??kh? that are not found in the ??kala ??kh?,
since the ??val?yana padap??ha manuscripts did not give them. He does not
say whether he also supplied the padap??ha for verse 7.59.12 that is found
in the ??kala ??kh? but there lacks a padap??ha. As far as I could see,
Amal Dhari Singh Gautam does not say whether he himself supplied the
padap??ha for any verses in his edition of the ???kh?yana ??kh?. We may
recall that Vishva Bandhu's edition of the ?gveda quietly supplies the
padap??ha for the six verses of the ??kala ??kh? that did not have it.
