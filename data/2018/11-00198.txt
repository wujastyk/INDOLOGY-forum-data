I found a reference to the following book in NCC (vol. 38. p. 1) and also
in the Sanskrit Books Catalogue of India Office Library (Vol. II, Part I,
Section IV, p. 2262)
<https://archive.org/stream/IndiaOffice_CatalogueOfSanskritBooks/Nath%20and%20Chaudhuri_Catalogue%20India%20Office%20Sanskrit%20Books%20S-Z_1957#mode/2up>
:

Sam?j?nu??sana-s?tra by Trivikramat?rtha Sv?min,
Var???rama-viveka-s?tra-sametam.
?r?trivikramat?rtha-sv?mi-cara?ai? sa?grathitam. pp. 62. 17X11 cm.
Karnatak Printing Press, Bombay [1922].

I don't find this book even on www.worldcat.org

Can anyone share a copy of this book?
