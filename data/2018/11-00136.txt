Dear colleagues,
Aware of the fact that it has been reprinted in the same author's Essays on Buddhist, Hindu, Jain iconography & epigraphy (Dhaka 2000), I am wondering if someone could help me obtain a pdf of the original version of this article:
Bhattacharya, Gouriswar. 1995. ?K??ch? monks at Kukkutap?da-giri-vih?ra.? In E???vatu Ulakat Tamil? M?n???u cir?appu malar (International Conference-Seminar of Tamil Studies), 89?93. Ta?c?v?r: Karnatait Tamil?c Ca?kam.
I am not 100% sure this bibliographic reference is correct, but think the paper must have appeared in this "souvenir brought out during the 8th International Conference-Seminar of Tamil Studies, held at Thanj?v?r, in January 1995" (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916278945).
Thank you, and best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
