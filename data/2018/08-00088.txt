[INDOLOGY] Deccan College sanskrit ditionary
Thanks, Patrick.  There was a discussion elsewhere about this word
apavyaya.  In Marathi, the word means waste of money or improper use of
money or time.  It also occurs in this meaning in some other Indian
languages.  The ?a?kara-Digvijaya usage seems to have a completely
different meaning.  In the sense of waste of or improper use of money or
time, this seems to be a relatively new coinage.  It does appear in
Molseworth's Marathi-English Dictionary prepared around 1850, but does not
occur in Tulpule-Feldhaus Dictionary of Old Marathi.  So, apavyaya in this
sense arose sometime during the early modern period.  The inclusion of this
word in MW and Apte in this meaning surprises me, but they don't provide
any classical attestations.
