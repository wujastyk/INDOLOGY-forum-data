Subject: [INDOLOGY] Etymology of mukura / makura
Message-ID: <9D070C0D-77B0-43FF-A8DB-E1DC4F4B81F9@hum.ku.dk>

Hi all,

The two Sanskrit words mukura and makura both mean ?mirror.? I?m trying to understand their etymology.

Other meanings given in MW are ?the stick or handle of a potter's wheel? and ?a bud, blossom.? Turner?s _A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Languages_ connects the words to mukula and bakula, meaning ?bud? and ?the tree Mimusops elengi,? respectively. Burrow and Emeneau?s _Dravidian Etymological Dictionary_ (entry 4619), also connects the two words with  Mimusops elengi.

How did mukura and makura come to mean ?mirror? in Sanskrit?

Many thanks in advance.

All best wishes,
Toke
