[INDOLOGY] Etymology of mukura / makura
Hi all,
The two Sanskrit words mukura and makura both mean ?mirror.? I?m trying to understand their etymology.
Other meanings given in MW are ?the stick or handle of a potter's wheel? and ?a bud, blossom.? Turner?s _A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Languages_ connects the words to mukula and bakula, meaning ?bud? and ?the tree Mimusops elengi,? respectively. Burrow and Emeneau?s _Dravidian Etymological Dictionary_ (entry 4619), also connects the two words with  Mimusops elengi.
How did mukura and makura come to mean ?mirror? in Sanskrit?
Many thanks in advance.
All best wishes,
Toke
