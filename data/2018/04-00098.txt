[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit verse today
Dear Madhavji,
There is nothing wrong with your *dyuti?*. It is the problem with the font.
The default font on Microsoft windows was changed from Mangal font to
Nirmala font, in Windows 10 (actually from Windows 8). The rendering of *dyu
*is not correctly implemented in Nirmala font. So, unfortunately, everyone
using Microsoft windows 10 would find your  *mukt?dyuti? *as  *mukt?duyati?*
.
You can see how your text appears in various fonts as shown below:
I hope someone at Microsoft is working to rid their default font of all
these bugs.
Regards,
Suresh.
