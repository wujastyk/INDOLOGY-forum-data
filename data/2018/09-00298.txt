[INDOLOGY] French Institute at Pondicherry
Dear Colleagues, ? Thanks for this interest. I would suggest to look at the bibliography of Jean Filliozat, where reports on the activity of the IFP can be found. You may also write to Nicolas Dejenne (nicolas.dejenne at gmail.com), who has made several stays there, and who knows the history of Indology in general.?
Best regards, ? Georges-Jean Pinault?

Interesting question. I suppose you mean an external point of view, not the brief self-description that can be read on http://www.ifpindia.org/the-institute? If anything exists, I am sure its librarian Anurupa Naik, who I believe is on this list, will know.>
