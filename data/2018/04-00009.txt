Dear Matthew,
Thanks. It?s certainly possible that the author of my source misunderstood the opinion he paraphrases and took ?cart-shaped? to refer to the entire earth, whereas only a portion of the earth was intended.
In Hindu cosmography, Jambudv?pa refers to a circular continent surrounded by annular oceans and continents. Since the author rejects that the earth is cart-shaped, it?s possibly a refutation of a Buddhist idea.
The triangular or trapezoidal shape in the Buddhist sources you refer to agrees with the drawing in the ?ilpa-prak??a manuscript. I?m not sure where Bose got ?quadrangular, with a long triangular projection on one side? from.
This begs the question, of course, of whether carts in ancient India were generally trapezoidal-shaped?
Best wishes,
Toke
