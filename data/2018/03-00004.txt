Post-Baccalaureate Program in Buddhist Languages and Translation Studies
The year-long Postbaccalaureate Program is designed for students who are planning to go on to graduate school in Buddhist studies or related fields. It emphasizes language study. A student who completes the program will have the equivalent of two years of graduate-level study in either classical Sanskrit or classical Tibetan. The program also will also offer training in Buddhist Studies and Translation Methods and a Postbaccalaureate Seminar, helping to prepare students for a successful academic career.
The program starts with the Summer Language Intensive, followed by a two semester program that runs from late August through early May.
The syllabus for the Post-Baccalaureate Program was designed by Luis G?mez, who was MRC?s Academic Director until his passing last year, in consultation with our Board of Advisors.
The deadline for applications is May 4, 2018. Partial tuition waivers may be available.
