[INDOLOGY] Searchable text?
I am trying to find if and where ?a?kara uses the term madhyam?dhik?rin in
reference to Arjuna in his G?t?bh??ya.  Radhakrishnan, in his introduction
to his translation of the Bhagavadg?t?, attributes this view to ?a?kara.  I
have not yet found a passage in ?a?kara's G?t?bh??ya where he used the term
madhyam?dhik?rin for Arjuna.  I would appreciate if anyone else has come
across such a passage.
