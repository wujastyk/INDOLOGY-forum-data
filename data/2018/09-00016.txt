Dear Professor Sahab,It's really a new idea and style to present thedevotion/Bhakti to Shri Krishna.I am indeed delighted.But you don't remember the Divine Couple including Rajarajeshwari Alabeli Aparimitakarunaamayi Sachchidaanandarupaa? Radha ShriKrishnasya paanigrihiti api vane Brahmavaivartaanusaarena.Although SriKrisna is Akaaranakarunaavarunaalayah but in doing karunaa Raadhaa goes superior to Shri Krishna as She never examines her Bhaktas especially sharanaagatas.Tathaapi kinchin nahi vaktum ishe? harshaabdhi vichi muditaantaraatmaa./Iti ShriKrisnadaasaanudaasasya GirishJha sharmanah.

Continuing my Krishna verses:
Krishna says to me:
???? ???????????????? ? ??????? ? ???????: ???????? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ???????I am not some strange form, remote or mysterious.  With a calm mind, you will see me as I am.
???? ??????? ?????, ??????? ?????, ???????? ??????? ?????, ??????????, ???????? ? ??? ?? ???????I am the sensation in your heart, your faith and your intelligence.  I am your thought and your movement.  How am I not known to you?
??????? ??? ????? ?????????? ?? ???? ?? ??????? ????????????????? ??: ???????Fallen in some difficulty, O friend, when you call me with your words, I am not far away.  I am near you and busy protecting you.
?? ??:???? ?????? ?????? ? ?????? ??? ????????? ??? ???????????? ? ??:?? ? ? ?? ????? ???????O friend, I know your sorrows and happiness.  In this world, no sorry or happiness transcends me.
