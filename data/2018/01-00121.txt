[INDOLOGY] "Caste passing"
Dear Dr. Francis,
Joel Lee <https://anso.williams.edu/profile/jl20/> at Williams College in
the US has written on the phenomenon of caste 'passing' in contemporary
South Asia and is also interested in historical and literary precedents. I
am sure that it would be fine if Dr. Headley contacted him directly, but I
would also be happy to introduce them if she prefers.
Best,
Tyler Williams
