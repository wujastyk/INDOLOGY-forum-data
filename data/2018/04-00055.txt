=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_camatk=C4=81ra?=
Dear colleagues,
only a final short note (along with my grateful thanks for the interesting suggestions, including those sent to me off-list by Roland Steiner and Christophe Vielle):
- I apologize to Ashok and Jesse for partly misrepresenting their comments.
- Nagaraj Paturi?s is precisely an apt statement of that communis opinio about the meaning of camatk?ra I don?t agree on. But I am afraid that the Indology list (indeed a wonderful resource!) is not the right place to delve into complex philological investigations?
Warmly,
Raffaele
