Dear Jacob,
I cannot help you with Jaina yoga texts, but in ha?hayoga texts the association of n???s with dv?ras is quite common. Or, to be more precise, most of the HY texts only list the main n???s (usually ten or fourteen), but some of them provide more details about their position. One of these systems (with 14 n???s) is described in the Vasi??hasa?hit? 2.34?40, where the link of n???s with dv?ras is as follows:
1/ kuh??: ?me?hr?nta?
2/ pi?gal?: y?mye n?s?nta?
3/ p???: y?mye netr?ntra?
4/ payasvin?: y?mye kar??ntam
5/ sarasvat?: ?jihv?y??
6/ ?a?khin?: ?savyakar??d
7/ g?ndh?r?: savyanetr?ntam
8/ i??: savyan?s?nta?
9/ alambu??: p?yum?l?d
The same verses are in Yogay?j?avalkya 4.39?45  (Divanji ed.) and similar system is e.g. in the compendium Ha?hatattvakaumud? 23.15?18.
More texts describe ten main n???s, e.g. ?ivasvarodaya (Lonavla ed.) 38?40:
i?? v?me sthit? bh?ge pi?gal? dak?i?e sm?t? |
su?umn? madhyade?e tu g?ndh?r? v?macak?u?i ?38?
dak?i?e hastijihv? ca p??? kar?e ca dak?i?e |
ya?asvin? v?makar?e ?nane c?py ala?bu?? ?39?
kuh?? ca li?gade?e tu m?lasth?ne tu ?a?khin? |
eva? dv?ra? sam??ritya ti??hanti da?a n??ik?? ?40?
= Gorak?a?ataka 29?31 (Nowotny ed.) etc.; slightly different system is in ?ar?gadharapaddhati 4309?4312.
Many of these verses are used in various Yogopani?ads, e.g.:
Dar?anopani?ad 4.13?22
Yogac???ma?yupani?ad 18?21
Brahmayogin on ????ilyopani?ad 1.10
cf. also J?b?ladar?anopani?ad 3.7?22.
Outside the yoga texts, several later tantras make this connection too, see e.g. Ahirbudhnyasa?hit? 32.24?30.
Thus it seems that in various Hindu yoga systems the association of n???s with dv?ras was common. This, however, does not mean anything for Jaina yoga. A few Jaina texts I am familiar with (e.g. Hemacandra's Yoga??stra or Haribhadra's Yogad???isamuccaya) do not describe system of n???s. I would recommend you to check Hemacandra's autocommentary on his Yoga??stra (Svopaj?avivara?a) - this is a great treasure of Jaina yoga concepts.
Best,
Lubomir
