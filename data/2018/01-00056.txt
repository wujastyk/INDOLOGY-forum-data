Dear All, ? Thanks for these informations and best wishes for 2018.? I would be grateful if anyone belonging to this list can recommend me monographs or reference papers about the mirror, preferably in Classical India, under all aspects; literature, art, craft, mythology, etc.

Dear all,
?
This announcement reminds me of an expression in the Sarvadar?anasa?graha that I have difficulty understanding. On p. 418 of Abhyankar's edition (line 16.298) it mentions "showing a cloth with the imprint of the son's foot" (putrapad??kitapa?apradar?anavat) in the context of announcing the birth of a son. Does this refer to a known custom in India?
