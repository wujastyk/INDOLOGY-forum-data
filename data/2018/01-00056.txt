Dear all,
?
This announcement reminds me of an expression in the Sarvadar?anasa?graha that I have difficulty understanding. On p. 418 of Abhyankar's edition (line 16.298) it mentions "showing a cloth with the imprint of the son's foot" (putrapad??kitapa?apradar?anavat) in the context of announcing the birth of a son. Does this refer to a known custom in India?
