[INDOLOGY] Heliodorus Pillar
Thank you very much for the reference. Of late,I visited Vidisha- and found myself standing in front of the Heliodorus pillar.It' s curious to note how Emperor Antialkidas if Bactrian Greek lineage,became Amtalikitasa in Sanskrit(may be itis a blend of Brahmi as well,).

To All,Wishing everybody a Happy New Year,may anybody translate the following excerpt from what Heliodorus wrote in his GarudaDvawaja at Vidisha-
Devadevasa Vasudevasa GarudaDvawaja Ayam,Karito Heliotdorena bhaga,vatena diyasa putrena Takshashilakena,Yonadatena agatena maharajasa,Amtalikitasa upamta samkasam -rano
