Thank you Madhav,

You mention aravinda as possibly non-indo-european.  Does that also apply
to govinda?
Monier-Williams has govinda as go-vinda with vinda ifc as "finding".  But I
vaguely recall (though I can't find it anymore) that MacDonells or Whitneys
grammar   had a footnote somewhere that the etymology of govinda was
uncertain and that it might be from go+indra through the prakrit.
