Re: [INDOLOGY] BhG quote
Dear all,
This is indeed an intricate question, which requires further investigation.
Regarding the Kashmirian recension, allow me to draw your attention on the
ongoing project undertaken by Judit T?rzs?k and myself of editing (with new
manuscript material) and translating  Abhinavagupta?s Giitaarthasamgraha on
the Kashmirian Giitaa. A co-signed paper on the topic has recently been
published in the *Journal of Indian Philosophy*:
Bansat-Boudon, Lyne et Judit To?rzso?k (2018). ? Abhinavagupta on the
Kashmirian Gi?ta?. Announcement of the First Critical Edition of the
Gi?ta?rthasam?graha, with the Reconstruction of the Text of the
Kashmirian Gi?ta?
as Abhinavagupta Probably Read It and a French Translation of Both Texts ?.
In : Journal of Indian Philosophy 46.1, p. 31?64.
The paper is on line on each author?s Academia page.
With best regards,
Lyne Bansat-Boudon
