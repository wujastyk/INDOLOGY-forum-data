Dear Colleagues!
I am trying to trace the source of the following 108 names of Ga?g?:
http://stotrasamhita.net/wiki/Ganga_Ashtottara_Shatanamavali
According to this text, it should be the Bh?gavata-Pur??a, but I am unable to find it in the editions I have access to:
|| iti ?r? mah?bh?gavat? mah?pur?n?? ?r? gan?g?s?t??ttara?atan?m?valih? samp?rn?? ||
Basically I am interested in name no. 89: ?iva-vallabh?. 
Any help in locating the source of the 108 names or pointers to other places where the Ga?g? is characterised as ?iva's beloved (or similar) would be greatly appreciated (a GRETIL search seems to yield no results)! 
Best wishes,
Sven
