Krishna says to me:

????? ???? ?????? ????? ??? ???? ???????? ???????
Not knowing me, if you think that I don?t exist, think for a moment as to
you impels your thoughts.
??? ???? ??? ???????? ????? ??????? ?? ?
??? ? ??? ???????? ????? ??????? ?? ???????
When you think of me, I am near you. But even if you do not think of me, I
am still near you.
??? ???? ?????? ????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ?
?????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ???????
O friend, you are always in Me and I am always in you. However, your mind,
overwhelmed by ignorance, is unable to see the non-difference.

With wisdom, when all the darkness in your mind will disappear, then in the
space of your heart, you will always see only Me.
