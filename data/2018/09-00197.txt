[INDOLOGY] Indo-European graduate studies?
Dear Dominik,
There is also a useful list of universities
currently offering courses and options in Indo-European studies on the
Indogermanische Gesellshaft / Society for Indo-European Studies website,
with helpful web links to individual
programmes.
https://www.indogermanistik.org/indogermanistik/studium/lehrstuehle.html
Which
programmes may be considered &#39;top&#39; probably depends a lot on what
a given student wants to research given the field is broad and different
departments have their own special areas of concentration. In the USA,
UCLA, Harvard, and Cornell have very good generalist IE programmes. There
are many more in Europe; the programmes in??Copenhagen, Cologne,
Munich, Leiden, Jena, Z??rich, and??Vienna are all highly regarded
(apologies to my colleagues if I&#39;ve missed any other obvious
programmes).
Kind regards,
Matthew
