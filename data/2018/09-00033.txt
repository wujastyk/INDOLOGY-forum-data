Jim Nye of the Regenstein Library at the University of Chicago, who got many of the Anandasrama Series books microfilmed, told me that sometimes Anandasrama when doing a second edition of a text, would print a totally new edition rather than reprinting the old one.? David Reigle indicates he checked the reissues of Agase's edition and the different readings are errors stemming from fresh typesetting.? But if one is looking (or searching in online catalogs) other 2nd or further editions of Anandasrama publications, it might be wise to make sure they weren't fresh, independent, editions rather than mere reprintings.

 Dear Dhaval Patel,
If you just want to get an idea of what is in the various commentaries, any edition will do. But if you need to do serious research, commentaries that are well edited and accurately printed are necessary. In the case of the Vy?sa commentary, several editions are available. About the early editions, here is what James Haughton Woods wrote in the Preface to his 1914 English translation (p. xi):
"The most accessible and the most carefully elaborated of these books is the one published in the ?nand??rama Series and edited by K???n?tha Sh?str? ?g??e. Variants from twelve manuscripts, mostly southern, are printed at the foot of each page; and Bhojadeva's V?tti is appended; also the text of the s?tras by itself and an index thereto. Another edition, in the Bombay Sanskrit Series, by R?jar?m Sh?str? Bodas, is also an excellent piece of work. I have, however, made use of the edition by Sv?mi B?lar?ma (Calcutta, Sa?vat 1947, A.D. 1890; reprinted in Benares A.D. 1908) because it is based on northern manuscripts and because of the valuable notes in the editor's ?ippa?a."
The edition by Sv?mi B?lar?ma was very hard to find. I finally had a friend make a photocopy of the 1908 reprint at the Harvard University Library, apparently the copy previously used by Woods. The ?nand??rama Series edition has been reprinted several times, but the reprints are re-typeset, introducing new typographical errors. So I photocopied the original 1904 edition at the University of Chicago Library. The original 1892 Bombay Sanskrit Series edition was also hard to find in North America, but I was able to photocopy it from the American Oriental Society Library at the Yale University Library. Scans of all three are posted here, along with a few other commentaries on the Yogas?tras: http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-hindu-texts/

Since the ?nand??rama Series edition was edited by K???n?tha ??str? ?g??efrom twelve manuscripts, giving variant readings in footnotes, it is in effect a critical edition. However, the first critical edition that was called such is that by Vimala Karnatak, P?ta?jala-Yoga-Dar?anam, four volumes, Varanasi: Banaras Hindu University & Ratna Publications, 1992. It includes the commentaries by Vy?sa, V?caspati-mi?ra, and Vij??na-bhik?u. It also includes her own Hindi exposition.
More recently the first volume of a critical edition by Philipp Maas was published: Sam?dhip?da: das erste Kapitel des P?ta?jalayoga??strazum ersten Mal kritish ediert = The first chapter of the P?ta?jalayoga??strafor the first time critically edited, Aachen: Shaker, 2006. This is a very thorough critical edition of theYogas?tras and Vy?sa's commentary, together forming the P?ta?jalayoga??stra, using all available sources. We anxiously await further volumes of this definitive critical edition. 

Best regards,
David ReigleColorado, U.S.A.
