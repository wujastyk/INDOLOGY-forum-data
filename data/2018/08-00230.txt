=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Works_attributed_to_=C5=9Aa=E1=B9=85kar=C4=81c=C4=81rya?=
Dear list members,
I'm looking for articles that discuss the authorship of works attributed to
?a?kar?c?rya .  Which works are considered genuinely by him and which are
not.
Even better are articles that discuss the authorship  and dating of the
Dak?i??m?rtistotram .  Whether that is considered genuinely by ?a?kar?c?rya
or whether that is a much later work.
Many thanks,
Harry Spier
