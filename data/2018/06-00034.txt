[INDOLOGY] Brackets in modern sanskrit translations
Re the Sanskrit to Tibetan translation aspect, I would echo what Matthew
has written.  In my work on English translation from Buddhist Sanskrit
tantra material that also has Tibetan translations, I found that the
Tibetan versions are:
a) often very exactly literal, word for word renditions of the original
Sanskrit
b) often rewordings that capture essentially the same meaning though with
different phrasing, both in prose and poetry sections
c) sometimes,  the Tibetan translators use a more general term for a quite
specific Sanskrit meaning, leading to issues with English translations
based solely on the general Tibetan term rather than the Sanskrit original,
since the more general Tibetan term loses the specificity of meaning
intended by the Sanskrit.
d) sometimes, as Matthew writes, "given the polysemy of Sanskrit, the
better translators recognized that choices had to be made on many
occasions"--these
unavoidable choices in the case of polysemous Sanskrit terms result in what
one might term 'partial' meaning in Tibetan, when the Tibetan translators
sought a single term in Tibetan to represent the polysemous term in
Sanskrit, since typically I found that the use of the polysemous Sanskrit
term was intentional, with the multiplicity of meaning embedded in the
single Sanskrit word important, or even critically important to
understanding the intent of the text--these instances suggested to me that
it was better in fact not to translate the Sanskrit term, but rather import
it into English (along with a suitable explanatory note).
e) rarely Tibetan translators mistook the original Sanskrit term for
another term and translated it incorrectly (these instances were rare, but
not non-existent).
f) occasionally the Tibetan translators did not translate the Sanskrit, but
tried to copy transliaterate it into Tibetan--more often than not these
transliterations were somewhat or even largely erroneous.
