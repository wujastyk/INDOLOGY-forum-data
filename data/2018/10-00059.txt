[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Dear George,
I am also waiting for your paper. Please, do find it!
I would also like to say that I have analysed the problem of Soma in my
"Fire and cognition in the Rgveda" (2010). I have not tried to decide its
botanical identification, but I have analysed how this concept was used by
the Rgvedic poets (on the basis of the experience which is attested in the
RV) in their philosophical (yes, I dare to use this word) investigation.
The work of George was very useful for me.
Best wishes,
Joanna
