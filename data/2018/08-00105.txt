Subject: [INDOLOGY] Resources for commentarial interpretations of particles

In addition to the two books you mentioned, one by Angot and the other 
by Tubb and Boose, one might find useful Apte's Student Guide to 
Sanskrit Composition, where fifty or sixty particles are treated with 
brief explanations and cited examples over the lessons 21 to 28. The 
particles are taken up in (Sanskrit) alphabetical order.
