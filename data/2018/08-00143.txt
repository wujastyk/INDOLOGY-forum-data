[INDOLOGY] PDF request
Dear all,
I just noticed that Prof. Arcangela Santoro published a short paper on Prof. Anna Maria Quagliotti who passed away almost 2 years ago (23/08/2016). 
Anyone can email me three pages (283-86) from 
Annali Sezione Orientale, Volume 78, Issue 1-2 (2018)
Best wishes,
Paolo
