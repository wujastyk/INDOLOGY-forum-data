[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Report on the Conference on Jainism & Environment at UNT Sat. Apr 14th
My colleague Prof. George James wanted to share this:
"On April 14, the Bhagwan Adinath Professorship in Jain Studies at the
University of North Texas held a one day conference on the topic of Jainism
and the Environment.  The event featured the work of established scholars
in the field of Jainism and Ecology as well as Jain Art and Architecture,
History and Iconography, as well as the work of younger scholars opening
new areas of research in Jain Studies.  The event was well attended by
students and faculty from UNT and neighboring Universities as well as
members of the Jain community in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.  It ended with
a dinner recognizing local donors to the Bhagwan Adinath Professorship in
Jain Studies, featuring a keynote address by the eminent scholar of Jain
Studies Christopher Key Chapple".
