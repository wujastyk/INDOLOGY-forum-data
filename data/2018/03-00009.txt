Dear colleagues,

I am writing a paper on the use of laghu as a value in assessing the composition of mathematical and astral science treatises. Author?s could present their work as a rewriting of previously known knowledge, but making it easier/shorter.

 I suspect that this was a wide spread value, and was wondering if you could point to me any papers published on this topic in other fields of indological query.

with all best

Agathe
