[INDOLOGY] Brackets in modern sanskrit translations
I find the positive reasons adduced by Alex also convincing. I am 
wondering sometimes whether instead of the "translation without 
brackets" approach it might not be better to begin devising a new genre, 
one that does not announce itself as "translation", but more of a 
paraphrase or interpretive rendering which somehow makes transparent (1) 
that someone renders a Sanskrit text in another language (English or 
German or ...) and thus follows the logic / narrative and terminology of 
the text and (2) that interpretative work has gone into this rendering 
that makes it expressing one among several perhaps equally possible 
interpretations. Perhaps the problem is not one of how to translate, but 
that translation is overcharged with too many different and divergent 
functions, and expectations.
I don't find Dominik's argument to the effect that using brackets in a 
translation is premised on the assumption that the Sanskrit text is 
incoherent particularly convincing. Authors of texts make assumptions 
about what their audience knows, and expect them to fill in gaps. We are 
at a historical distance from these authors, and which gaps to fill, and 
how, is interpretative work we have to do, and (now going back to Alex' 
points about intellectual honesty) it may be advisable to signal where 
more of this work has been required, for instance, by brackets. This 
isn't a question of incoherence, it is perhaps a question of recognizing 
a legitimate multiplicity of different renderings.
