Dear Agathe,
You may find a veritable list of Sanskrit works with *laghu* as the initial
part of their titles in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum on archive.org
<https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.142408/2015.142408.Catalogus-Catalogorum-An-Alphabetical-Register-Of-Sanskrit-Works-And-Authors-Part-i#page/n549/mode/2up>.
The *New catalogus catalogorum. An alphabet. register of Sanskrit and
allied works and authors. Vol 26*.
<http://portal.kobv.de/uid.do?query=b3kat_BV041582033&index=internal&plv=2>will
be even more comprehensive.

Best wishes,

Philipp
