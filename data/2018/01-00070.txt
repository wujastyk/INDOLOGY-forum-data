[INDOLOGY] in praise of water
Hi, Alex, my following study is somewhat relevant. More references are
found in the article.

the *Taiyi sheng shui*?. In Ithamar Theodor and Zhihua Yao (eds.)* Brahman
and Dao: Comparative Studies of Indian and Chinese Philosophy and
Religion* (Lexington

My posting may be ignored since it concerns Tamil, not Sanskrit!!
In Tamil we have a proverb:
?t?yaip pa?itt?lum ta???raip pa?ikk?t? (?????? ??????????? ?????????
?????????)?
meaning, ?Don?t revile the water even if you revile your mother.?
The well-known literature Tirukku?a? has a chapter on rain/water.
Ancient Tamil poetry has some nice references in praise of water.

Dear List Members
A friend has asked if I could help him collect Sanskrit verses in praise of
water.
He's not thinking so much of verses praising specific rivers, but water as
such.
Does anything come to mind?
Yours Alex
