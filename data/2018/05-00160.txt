Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help identifying the deity of a gayatri mantra

There was a thread on this list on this. I am travelling. Please search in
the archives.

The point is, these Gaayatris have no relation to the 'goddess' Gaayayree.

But the Gaayatree mantra is the prototype (maataa) after which these are
'generated'.
