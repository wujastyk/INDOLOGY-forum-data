[INDOLOGY] Help identifying the deity of a gayatri mantra
There was a thread on this list on this. I am travelling. Please search in
the archives.
The point is, these Gaayatris have no relation to the 'goddess' Gaayayree.
But the Gaayatree mantra is the prototype (maataa) after which these are
'generated'.
