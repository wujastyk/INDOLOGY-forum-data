Hi all,
According to this website
https://www.sites.google.com/site/bharatasahitya/archives
the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute at one point had an e-text of the K?lik?kulapa?ca?atik?, a.k.a. the Dev?pa?ca?atik?, edited by Mark S. G. Dyczkowski.
However, I can?t find this text at the Muktabodha website.
Would anyone happen to have a copy of this e-text?
Many thanks in advance.
All best wishes,
Toke
