[INDOLOGY] Identifying two verses on spring
At the end of an astrological MS, available to me only in digitized 
microfilm format, are two partly illegible verses which appear to be 
(part of?) a poem on spring, and nothing to do with astrology at all. 
The first half-stanza runs:
r?jan vasantasamaye vada ki? tar???? ki? k??yate virahi??m uraga? kim eti |
If any rasikas on the list recognize it and are able to supply the rest 
of this and the following verse, I should be very grateful.
Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
