Subject: [INDOLOGY] call for applications: intensive course "Lived Sanskrit Cultures in Varanasi" (18.2.2019-8.3.2019)
Message-ID: <eb57d69f-c9c4-436c-a30b-2303ad859e3f@uni-heidelberg.de>

Dear list members

from February 18 to March 08 (2019) the Department "Cultural and 
Religious History of South Asia (Classical Indology)" of Heidelberg 
University and the "Indology" department of Wuerzburg University

offer the three week intensive course *"Lived Sanskrit Cultures in 
Varanasi". *

This course is designed to impart a practice oriented training in 
methods of cultural and religious studies. Its aim is to complement and 
supplement the approaches of philology and textual studies. It is 
suitable for students registered in a bachelor or master level program 
in any University in the field of cultural and religious history of 
South Asia with special focus on Sanskrit studies.

Three broad areas will be covered during the course. These include (A) 
the lived cultures of Sanskrit learning (B) Rituals that are practiced 
in public or private spheres, and (C) Varanasi as a centre of 
pilgrimage. An essential part of the course would be to include gender 
perspectives in the study of all the areas mentioned above.

Applications for admission are invited by *students registered in a 
university or other academic institutions*. This course is suitable for 
students who are studying in B.A./M.A. or researchers working in these 
areas. It is open to students hailing from any part of the world 
(including India!). *Knowledge of Sanskrit is mandatory* (equivalent to 
at least 1 year of university level courses). In addition to it, 
*working knowledge of Hindi* is desired, although it is not a 
prerequisite for the course. Moreover, previous exposure with Varanasi 
or India is useful. For large parts of the course, participants will 
work in teams. *Willingness and ability for team work* is therefore an 
essential precondition.
