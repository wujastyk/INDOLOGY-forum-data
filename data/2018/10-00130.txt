[INDOLOGY] [Indology] Rules of the game
Wielce Szanowny Panie Arnoldzie (Arnaudzie does not sound properly Polish),
Nale?? - zgodnie z Pa?skim okre?leniem - do 'li?ciarzy' , czy 'listownik?w'
(listees) i dlatego pozwalam sobie na uwag? w j?zyku, w kt?rym ma sens
stare powiedzenie:
<<robi? z ig?y wid?y>>
As far as I am concerned this exchange of arguments re ad Hitlerum and
contra-ad Hitlerum is more than a bit dull. Quite boring, frankly speaking.
Threatening to become endless - and, finally, empty.
Robi Pan z ig?y wid?y.
There are much more important topics that need be laid on the indological
discussion table - such as the introduction of iron forging technologies
and its consequences in the sphere of cultural politics. Or - such as the
origins of untouchability.
