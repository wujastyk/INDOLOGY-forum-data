Wielce Szanowny Panie Arnoldzie (Arnaudzie does not sound properly Polish),

Nale?? - zgodnie z Pa?skim okre?leniem - do 'li?ciarzy' , czy 'listownik?w'
(listees) i dlatego pozwalam sobie na uwag? w j?zyku, w kt?rym ma sens
stare powiedzenie:

<<robi? z ig?y wid?y>>

As far as I am concerned this exchange of arguments re ad Hitlerum and
contra-ad Hitlerum is more than a bit dull. Quite boring, frankly speaking.
Threatening to become endless - and, finally, empty.

Robi Pan z ig?y wid?y.

There are much more important topics that need be laid on the indological
discussion table - such as the introduction of iron forging technologies
and its consequences in the sphere of cultural politics. Or - such as the
origins of untouchability.

> SOB's tricks are ok, if they respect surface "Etiquette". Well, I definitely disagree.

> PT3. basically your "Etiquette", whatever that twisted pseudo-French word means, rejects my straightforward description but accepts Reductio ad Nazismus.
> So let me reword what Koenrad Elst's "work" is about:
> Basically, it's a Troyan horse: it looks like a pseudo-historiographical discourse, but the core of the beast is to sprinkle s*t and m*k on Indo-European Studies.

> So, concretely, your "Etiquette", whatever that twisted pseudo-French word means,
> 1. does not promotes (academic) courtesy, it promotes hypocrisy and oblique abusive perversion,
> 2. puts historiography at risk of becoming the playground for hypocritical "s*t and m*k sprinkling systems".
>
> I definitely believe that the historiography of sciences, and of linguistics in particular, deserves more than becoming the playground where a number of bastards can freely have fun with their "s*t and m*k sprinkling systems".
>
> As a matter of fact, in France, we have one indigenous exemplar of a "s*t and m*k sprinkling system", namely Jean-Fran?ois Demoule, an archeologist who writes books on linguistics where he drools at heavy length on how much linguists are half-incompetent, half-nazi, etc.
