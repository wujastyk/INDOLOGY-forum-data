[INDOLOGY] Fwd: launch of Anthem World Epic and Romance
Dear Colleagues,
I am forwarding, for your reference, the announcement of a new scholarly publication series focusing epic and romance literature from antiquity to modernity and from all languages and cultures. I will be serving as a member of the editorial board of the series.. 
Do pass this along to your colleagues and advanced students and keep the series in mind for possible publications of your own.
Warmest good wishes to you all.
