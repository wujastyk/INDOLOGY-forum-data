I generally find it best, especially at the early stages of Sanskrit
learning/teaching, to avoid equating grammatical terms from different
systems. Most of the Sanskrit terms are fairly precise, whereas there is
often some variation in the definitions for Latinate terminology and the
two don't often match up exactly. Plus, to be accurate one often ends up
going on long tangents.

The technical terms s?rvadh?tuka and ?rdhudh?tuka and the results of being
so termed are very interesting as well as complex. I'm not sure how far we
can associated the stem to which s?rvadh?tuka suffixes are added with what
is commonly termed the present stem. Since all of the personal endings are
termed s?rvadh?tuka (ti??it s?rvadh?tukam), s?rvadh?tuka suffixes occur
with all of the tense stems.   The vikara?as, many of which are associated
with the class signs used to build the present stem, are not universally
termed s?rvadh?tuka either; u of the tan?di ga?a (3.1.79) is ?rdhadh?tuka
(it's not marked with ?) and hence is not ?it by P. 1.2.4 s?rvadh?tukam
apit. Consequently there is gu?a-strengthening in karoti from ? k? (?Uk??)
when u follows but not in sunoti from ? su (?u?) when ?nu follows (?nu,
being treated a marked with ? by P. 1.2.4 and hence blocking
gu?a-strengthening according to P. 1.1.5 k?iti ca). In any case, this can
get a bit complicated quickly, so it might be best to treat each set of
terms separately and not look for one to one correspondences.

Could a reference be given to Max M?ller's translation? It doesn't
immediately come to mind.

All the Best,
Victor
