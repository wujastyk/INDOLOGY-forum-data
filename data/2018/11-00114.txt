Dear Scholars,
I hearby regret my error in the naming of the third collection.

It is Prof. V. R. Trivedi collection, and not Prof. V. R. Tripathi as
mentioned before.

The corrected line and link are as below.
3. Prof. V. R. Trivedi collection
<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/ChunilalGandhiVidyabhavan/blob/master/ProfVRTrivedi.tsv>
- 27 manuscripts
