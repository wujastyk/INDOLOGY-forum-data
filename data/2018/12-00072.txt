[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Resumption of 'In an oil vat'.
Re: [INDOLOGY] Resumption of 'In an oil vat'.
Dear Alakendu (if I may address you so),
the ending -*putta* may in the Pali rather mean - figuratively - 'of a
group'. In this case *Cundo* *kamm?raputto *would mean 'Cundo of the
smiths', 'Cunda the smith'. Like *buddhaputto* - which would mean - 'a
follower of the Buddha', 'a Buddhist'.
I'd be interested in the name, itself. Any etymology for 'Cunda'?.
Iron Age? According to many - rather 1200 -300 BC. High quality steel
already 300/200 BC.
