Dear Alakendu (if I may address you so),

the ending -*putta* may in the Pali rather mean - figuratively - 'of a
group'. In this case *Cundo* *kamm?raputto *would mean 'Cundo of the
smiths', 'Cunda the smith'. Like *buddhaputto* - which would mean - 'a
follower of the Buddha', 'a Buddhist'.

I'd be interested in the name, itself. Any etymology for 'Cunda'?.

Iron Age? According to many - rather 1200 -300 BC. High quality steel
already 300/200 BC.

Respects,
