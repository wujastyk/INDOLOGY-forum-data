The attached article, which quotes the piece by Briggs that Patrick links
to above, might also be of interest here.

It is linked to at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7724257/ and is
part of conference proceedings rather than an article in one of IEEE's
journals.

The authors do their best to arrive at a positive answer of the title
question ('Is Sanskrit the most suitable language for natural language
processing?'), but their arguments fail to convince me.

All the best,
