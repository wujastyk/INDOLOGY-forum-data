=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Pronunciation_of_j=C3=B1?=
Dear list members,
I've been asked about the pronounciation of the conjunct j? .
Coulson writes:
"j?a: the pronounciation of this varies wid is that it is a palatalisation
so to speak en bloc of an original gn,  In some places, for instance, it is
like gya, in others dnya. . . . The point about j? is that it is a palatal
isation so to speak en bloc of an original gn.. . . . Perhaps the most
approprate of the modern pronunciations to adopt is therefore gnya which
(by adding y to gn) thus crudely represent a palatalisation."
1) Is j?a  ever pronounced in India as jnya and if so where?
2) where in India are the different pronounciations Coulson lists (gya,
dnya, gnya) located?
Thanks,
Vasishtha
