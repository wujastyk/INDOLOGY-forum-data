Dear list members,

I've been asked about the pronounciation of the conjunct j? .

Coulson writes:
"j?a: the pronounciation of this varies wid is that it is a palatalisation
so to speak en bloc of an original gn,  In some places, for instance, it is
like gya, in others dnya. . . . The point about j? is that it is a palatal
isation so to speak en bloc of an original gn.. . . . Perhaps the most
approprate of the modern pronunciations to adopt is therefore gnya which
(by adding y to gn) thus crudely represent a palatalisation."

1) Is j?a  ever pronounced in India as jnya and if so where?

2) where in India are the different pronounciations Coulson lists (gya,
dnya, gnya) located?


Thanks,

Vasishtha
