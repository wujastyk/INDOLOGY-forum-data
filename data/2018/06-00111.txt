[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit grammatical terms
There are real vaiy?kara?as on the list, but for what it is worth,
"thematic" and "athematic" in the usage of most European grammars simply
mean "ending in -a" and "not ending in -a," which is captured in
traditional Sanskrit grammar by "at" (see 7.2.80 and 81), or "adanta-" if
you like to be more explicit, and "present stem" is a slightly more narrow
version of the verbal stem to which s?rvadh?tuka affixes are added (more
narrow because there are s?rvadh?tuka suffixes that wouldn't be considered
part of the present system, like kha?). I have to say, though, that I would
also appreciate some information about whether this identification holds.
Max M?ller translated ?rdhadh?tuka and s?rvadh?tuka as "general or
unmodified" tenses and "special or modified" tenses respectively.
