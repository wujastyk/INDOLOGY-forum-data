Dear Arthur,

one possible explanation runs as follows:

(1) Linguistic features: Every text from the DCS is split into sections 
of equal sizes (say 100 lines). Frequencies of approx. 1,000 linguistic 
features such as the accusative, certain Sandhi, metre, ... are counted 
in each of these sections.

(2) Dates: I collect approximate dates for each text from secondary 
literature. They include "exact" ones, as for some texts after 1000 CE, 
as well as quite wide temporal ranges for Puranas (and almost all the 
rest of Sanskrit literature).

(3) Now, I use a mathematical model (neural networks) that tries to 
predict the approximate dates (2) on the basis of the feature 
frequencies (1). Basically the same as is done, for instance, for 
weather forecasting: Collect some information about the weather of 
today, and try to predict the temperature in the next 24 hrs.

The uncertainties arising from (2) are hopefully handled in a follow-up 
of the follow-up, which I am currently working on.

Best, Oliver
