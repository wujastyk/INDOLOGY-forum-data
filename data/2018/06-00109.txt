Subject: [INDOLOGY] Edinburgh Vedic papers published
Message-ID: <CA+JSsdhFGxKHr_GdtYbSTe_j0Xrwe+bg1yvTxVHG54k87MEERg@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear All,

The following volume is now published:

Creating the Veda, Living the Veda. Selected Papers from the 13th World
Sanskrit Conference. Eds. Joel P. Brereton and Theodore N. Proferes
Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae. Humaniora 379
Helsinki 2018, 185 pp.

This is the last publication of the Edinburgh WSC papers that will come
out. As I was involved in the practical part of the publication, it was
eventually published in the Finnish series which I co-edit. More
information (+ orders) through the link: https://www.tiedekirja.f
i/english/creating-the-veda-living-the-veda.html. Contents in the
attachment.


Petteri Koskikallio
