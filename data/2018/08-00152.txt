[INDOLOGY] Caste and Gender at the WSC
Mr. Paturi and others,
The existence of p??ha??l?-s and gurukula-s for girls and women in some
corner of India does nothing to mitigate the fact that several WSC
participants were downright offensive to the three speakers on the
specially convened public forum on caste and gender in Sanskrit Studies.
The basis of the interruptions, shouting, heckling and intimidation was
primarily a kind of arrogance towards both women scholars like Professors
Bose, Panwar and myself, and those who are perceived to belong to
non-Brahmin castes, and therefore to be unwanted and unwelcome interlopers
in Sanskrit.
I entirely forgot to mention that many in the audience also insinuated that
they were unable to follow the Sanskrit pronunciation of Professors Bose
and Panwar, one of whom hails from Bengal and other from Haryana. The
implication was that Sanskrit diction coloured by the speaker's vernacular
language is unacceptable -- a laughable proposition, because who in India
does not have one or other native local language which is her or his mother
tongue. Someone even had the gall to ask Professor Bose to wear her glasses
when she had trouble reading something out. The rudeness was intolerable.
Again, the basis for these despicable interventions lay in deeply
entrenched Brahminical notions of "purity" and "pollution", of "adhikara"
and "bahishkara" -- whether based on caste, on gender, or on other
registers of regional and linguistic identity.
Kindly stop trying to justify, excuse, explain or dismiss what happened.
Stop pretending that everything is great because there are Vedic schools
for girls in existence somewhere out there. It won't do. A collective
apology is owed us all and most especially Dr. Panwar. This concerns the
founding principles and protocols of the world's largest professional
organization of Sanskrit scholars, which has no business undermining the
basic respect and dignity owed to each and every member, male or female,
Indian or foreign. If the WSC cannot get its act together, we will ask
every woman Sanskritist -- and every man as well, who has a conscience --
to boycott the next meeting. Why would we come to a place where we are not
treated on par with our male colleagues, and where basic and non-negotiable
standards of professional courtesy are not maintained.
