Dear Colleagues,
I am very interested in this equivalence, because what I remember having
learned (I am not sure now whether this is the right word) that kha/?a
"confusion" was a characteristic of Nepalese manuscripts, and that they
were to be considered the same (I perhaps learned this from John Brough's
lengthy review of Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and
Dictionary, if memory serves...). But now it appears that this is not a
"quirk" of Nepalese scribes but an instance of a wider phonologically
motivated fusion?
Curious, Jonathan Silk
