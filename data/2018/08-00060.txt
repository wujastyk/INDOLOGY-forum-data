[INDOLOGY] Ganga Jamuna Tehzib
Friends:
I was recently in Lucknow and the phrase Ganga Jamuna Tehzib kept on ringing in my ear.
Is Ganga Jamuna Tehzib to be understood only at a social and cultural level or can it go deeper?
In other words do we have here a case of synthesis or syncreticism?
Kind regards,
