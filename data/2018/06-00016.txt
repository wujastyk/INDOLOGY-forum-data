Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brackets in modern sanskrit translations
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQGD2+Cj0h6cZrem=1X3eA9PY-nbqZr=aRAv1hoXNEtvBA@mail.gmail.com>

My understanding is that in modern sanskrit translations when the
translator inserts words into the translation that weren't in the sanskrit
to make the meaning clearer then those words  are usually put in brackets.

Is there a convention on what type of brackets are usually used, square
brackets or regular brackets?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
