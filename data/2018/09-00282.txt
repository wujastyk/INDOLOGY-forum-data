Subject: [INDOLOGY] My verse on scholars and poets
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzc09FBmW8NaQHbQsfEmYtuOp_r4SCcpENZD8TWJYT=XYw@mail.gmail.com>

My verse on scholars and poets:

?????????? ? ??????? ? ??? ?????? ????? ?
????????? ???????: ?????: ????????? ???? ???? ??

Scholarship and poetry are never alike. Scholars conduct warfare with
words, while poets play with words happily.
