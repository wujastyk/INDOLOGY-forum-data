[INDOLOGY] sha and kha
Dear Jonathan,
     As Professor Girish Jha described, the change of ?a to kha, except in
conjuncts with ?a-varga [?: ?????????], is prescribed by the Pr?ti??khya of
the ?ukla-Yajurveda and seen in the recitation of this Veda till today.
This also results in variation like p??a??a/p?kha??a.  Certainly, a
wide-spread dialectal feature.
