RV 7.59.12 ?????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????????
??????????????????????? ?????????? does not have a Padap??ha.  This is not
a repeated mantra in the RV Sa?hit?.  What might be the reason why this
mantra does not have a Padap??ha?  Is it likely that there were a few
post-Padap??ha additions to the RV Sa?hit??  Someone asked this question on
another discussion group.
