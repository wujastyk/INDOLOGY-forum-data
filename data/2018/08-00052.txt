[From my main e-mail address]
In my work with the Pali works - original texts and their translations - I come across traces of a peculiar practice.
The translators tend, not infrequently, to supplant plain, ordinary, common terms with their more elegant, subtler lexical equivalents.
There is a Greek/Latin term for this practice - but I cannot recall it.
May I count on your help re?
