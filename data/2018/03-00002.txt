[INDOLOGY] Call for Papers: IIGRS 10 at SOAS, University of London
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that the tenth International Indology Graduate
Research Symposium (IIGRS 10) will take place at SOAS, University of
London, on Friday the 28th and Saturday the 29th September 2018. We would
like to thank the SOAS South Asia Institute, the School of Languages,
Cultures & Linguistics and School of History, Religions & Philosophies for
their support.
We look forward to receiving abstracts from graduate students, as well as
early career researchers who have completed their PhD within the past five
years.
Abstracts should be submitted to iigrsuk at googlemail.com by the 6th of May
2018. We will consider all Indological topics provided they are based on
primary sources studied in the original language.
We are pleased to announce that we will be providing speakers with
bursaries (?75-100) to help with covering travel and accommodation costs.
Speakers will be able to claim these against costs incurred upon submission
of receipts. However, we encourage participants to secure funding from
their home institution.
More information can be found at:

If you are teaching at an institution, we would be very grateful if you
could circulate this information among your students.
 For further questions, you can contact us directly at
