[INDOLOGY] Abhidharmakosa(bhasya) chapter 6 English translation by Poussin (Ridding/Thomas)
Dear Christophe,
Thank you very much for explaining all this. Yes, it seems that I
misunderstood LVP to mean that his translation had been published. Glad
that you clarified the sense of the French word "sortit" as meaning that an
English translation "was produced," not published. Pruden had translated
this phrase as saying that their collaboration "led to the appearance of an
English version . . . ," which normally means that it had been published,
and I followed him in this understanding. Thanks to your explanation, I now
know why I could never find where it was published: it was not published.
Thank you also for the additional information about the fate of his
translation of chapter 5 during the war. What a shame about the destruction
of the university library at Louvain and the associated printing offices!
Thanks and best regards,
David Reigle
