[INDOLOGY] Shared histories of yoga and Ayurveda in the 20th century
Dear colleagues,
I am pleased to announce the launch of the Ayuryog project's timeline on
the shared histories of yoga and Ayurveda in the 20th century, which you
can find on the project website at http://ayuryog.org/timeline . The
timeline was created by Suzanne Newcombe.
One of the major aims of the Ayuryog project is to explore the
entanglements of yoga and Ayurveda. As a resource to visualize these
entanglements in the twentieth century, we are pleased to present an
interactive timeline of key events linked to the entanglement of yoga and
Ayurveda from the colonial period to the present.
Any summary of key events and dates is always incomplete. If you?d like to
suggest additions and corrections to the timeline, please get in touch!
We used a Drupal plugin for this, and have found the technical details of
the plugin somewhat limiting (for example, we can't go back any further
than the 19th century). Nevertheless, it's a start and will hopefully prove
useful.
With kind regards,
Dagmar Wujastyk
