To All scholars,&nbsp;So far I have got access to only one book by Asanga,the 4th CE Buddhist Scholar, namely Mahayana Sutralankar.Can anybody kindly let me know whether there exists any other book by Asanga.If yes,then whether any English version is available or not.My gratitude, in Anticipation,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alakendu Das
