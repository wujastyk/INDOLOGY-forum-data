Dear Alakendu Das,
As you know, each of the ma?has started by ?a?kar?c?rya has a long line of
adhipatis up to the present. Each adhipati also has the title ?a?kar?c?rya.
So there have been many ?a?kar?c?ryas after ?di ?a?kar?c?rya. The idea,
then, is that the majority of the more than 400 works attributed to
?a?kar?c?rya are actually by later ?a?kar?c?ryas, not by ?di ?a?kar?c?rya,
even though they are usually taken to be by ?di ?a?kar?c?rya.
A clear example of this is the *Saundarya-lahar?*, which has long been
attributed to ?a?kar?c?rya, meaning ?di ?a?kar?c?rya. V. Raghavan found a
manuscript of this work whose colophon stated that it is by ?a?kar?c?rya,
the adhipati of the Sarasvat?-p??ha at ?r?vidy?nagara, i.e., a later
?a?kar?c?rya. (See footnote 24 in *The Saundaryalahar? or Flood of Beauty*,
edited and translated by W. Norman Brown, Harvard University Press, 1958,
pp. 29-30.)
There are also known cases where a work written by someone else has
somehow, over the years, gotten attributed to ?a?kar?c?rya. An example of
this is the *Prabodha-sudh?kara*. V. Raghavan showed of the basis of
manuscript colophons, etc., that it was actually written by Daivaj?a S?rya
Pa??ita. (See his article, "The N?simha Camp? of Daivaj?a S?rya Pa??ita and
the N?simhavij??pana of ?r? N?simh??ramin," *Adyar Library Bulletin*, vol.
1, 1937, p. 44.)
