My Sanskrit verses this morning. This is a conversation between Krishna and
Rukmini:

????????? ???? ??????? ???? ???????????? ?
?????: ??????? ?? ???? ??????? ???????? ????? ??
After Krishna often blurted the name of R?dh? at night in dream, the
worried Rukmi?? asked him in the morning: "who is she?"

?????????? ??????: ?????? ?????? ?: ?
????????????? ??? ???????? ????????????? ??
Trying to hide the memory of R?dh?, he said: "I said some syllables while
dreaming."

???? [?+???] ??? ???????? ???? [?+???] ?????? ????????? ?
?????? ????????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ??
"R is your own name, and Dh means I hold it in my mind. Day and night I
repeat the name of Rukmi?? as R?dh?."

??????????? ???? ?????? ???????? ????????? ?
???? ????? ? ??? ???? ????????? ???: ???: ??
Having heard those words, Rukmi?? was pleased and she embraced Krishna, and
he said to her the word R?dh? again and again.
