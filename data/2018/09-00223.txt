[INDOLOGY] Devanagari for Marathi
Dear list members,
Can someone tell me if in Marathi ? (? with dot underneath)  is used for
the letter transliterated as za .  I've been told that in Marathi ? without
dot underneath is used but the ISO transliteration guide has ? (? with dot
underneath) for z .
Thanks,
Harry Spier
