[INDOLOGY] Vedic citations
Dear Patrick,
perhaps you got already enough replies, but just in case: The problem of
"inaccurate" Vedic quotations in the ?Bh was acknowledged already by Garge
in his *Citations in ?abara-Bh**??**ya (A Study) *(1952). My sense is that
a scholar could reuse freely whatever belonged to their school, whereas one
had to be more cautious about quoting from another school. And one's
Veda??kh? was probably felt as "own" as one's own philosophical school. I
discussed this in my Introduction to the 2015 issue of the Journal of
Indian Philosophy on textual reuse.
Hope this helps! Please keep me updated if you continue working on the
topic.
Best,
elisa
