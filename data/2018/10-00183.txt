[INDOLOGY] Mbh stratification
Dear all,
just a short PS for the Mbh stratification thread (Andrew, Joydeep and 
others): A follow-up paper to appear in 2019 (neural networks digesting 
all kinds of linguistic features and making temporal predictions based 
on them) seems to suggest that we can distinguish temporal strata in the 
Mbh. A detail study of the Bhishmaparvan produces results that are not 
too far away from some outcomes of philological research:
 ?* BhG + the introductory chapters of Book 6: first few centuries CE 
(rather 200 CE++)
 ?* Battle passages quite constantly placed in the centuries BCE
