Thank you so much for brining this wonderful tool to our attention. I tried it, and it is fabulous.

Dear all,

It has come to my attention over the past year or so that the new interface for Cologne's dictionary tool may not be very well known, although it represents in my opinion quite a healthy leap forward in coverage and usability. For example, I searched the Indology list archive but couldn't find any mention of it at all. Does anyone perhaps know a reason why this development happened so quietly?

Prof. Karin Preisendanz has given me permission to share the below exchange, which may hopefully be of some instructional use to others, as well.

Kind regards,
Tyler Neill

Dear Prof. Preisendanz,

You are correct, there is such a website. It is the Cologne one, most commonly associated with the Monier-Williams dictionary.

The trick is to notice at the top of the home page ? http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/ ? the link to "Dec 2017", "new display".

What this gives is: http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/simple-search/v1.0/list-0.2s.html

Then, in the "Dictionary" box where the page defaults to "MW", simply change the code there, either by clicking with the drop-down menu or by typing. The desired Pune dictionary is accessed with the code "PD". (Two editions of Apte are also available, although my preferred digital interface for that remains the trickier-to-use Chicago website, which nevertheless allows not only a single-entry view<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:4467.apte> but also a page view<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.3:226.apte>.)

You'll notice that the search box even features auto-completion while one types. I think you'll agree, this already useful resource has now become significantly more powerful. For whatever reason, however, awareness of the new interface remains low. I think I will forward our exchange on to the Indology list, if you don't mind. I read it daily and also just now searched the archive, but I haven't yet seen any trace of a proper announcement.

With kind regards,
Tyler

Dear Mr. Neill,

I dimly remember that at our last project meeting you mentioned an
online Sanskrit dictionary that comprises most of the currently
available fascicles of the Pune dictionary. I have had a closer look at
Martin Gluckman's Sanskrit Dictionary now, but obviously it does not
consider this dictionary. Could you please give me the relevant
information or correct my memory?

With many thanks and best regards,

Karin Preisendanz
