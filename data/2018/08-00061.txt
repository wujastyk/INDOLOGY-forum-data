[INDOLOGY] Deccan College sanskrit ditionary
There are actually more volumes published. After vol. 9 the editors changed the numbering to 28 (published 2012). The last volume I am aware of came out 2014 as vol. 30. Unfortunately, I don?t have them at hand right now so I am not able to say what the last lemma is about.
All the best
