Yes. I believe they are all related. In Telugu *t?p(h)-???na* is still used
to refer a storehouse of guns. But  *t?ph *used only for canons.  There is
another persian word  *tupak *to refer to a musket. I believe Telugu/Tamil
tup?ki came from the Persian word. Another word *tamanca* is also used in
Telugu for pistols, which also has a corresponding word in Persian.
???? *tufang,* A musket
 ??? tupak, A musket
????? tamancha, A pistol.
