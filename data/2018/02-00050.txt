Call for Papers:

The Navar?tri Seminar is currently seeking submissions for the 2018 AAR meeting.

We, therefore, encourage papers that cover a range of traditions, regions, and languages in which Navar?tri is celebrated.

Some themes identified as potential papers session topics at our last meeting were:

? Economies of Navar?tri
? Spaces of Navar?tri
? Different Religious Traditions? Responses to Sacrifice in Navar?tri
? Ornamentation and Navar?tri
? Navar?tri and Democracy
