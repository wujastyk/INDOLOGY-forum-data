[INDOLOGY] Help with translation
Dear list members,
The fourth verse of the vi?van?th???akam is:
?ita??u-?obhita-kir??a-vir?ja-m?nam
bhalek?a??nala-vi?o?ita-pa?ca-b?nam
n?g?dhip?-racita-bh?sura-kar?a-p?ram
v?r??as?-pura-pati? bhaja vi?van?tham
bhaja vi?van?tham
I've seen bhalek?a?a translated as "the eye on the forehead".
But Monier-Williams has bh?la not bhala as forehead.  And  M-W also
cross-references bhala to bhalla .
Can bhala be an alternate spelling for bhalla .  M-W has meanings for
bhalla of "a kind of arrow or missile with a point of a particular  shape"
and also "a particular part of an arrow".
In other words can bhalek?a?a mean "eye shaped like an arrowhead" so the
phrase bhalek?a??nala-vi?o?ita-pa?ca-b?nam  would mean something like "the
fire from His eye shaped like an arrowhead dessicated the bearer of the
five arrows [K?ma]".
Thanks,
Harry
