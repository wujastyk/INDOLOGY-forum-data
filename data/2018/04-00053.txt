---- Utpaladeva-Abhinavagupta-K?emar?ja view of chamatkaara is rooted in
pratyabhijnaa and its application /extension to Rasa as abhivyakti is
obviously a sudden re-cognition. The suddenness and lack of its previous
awareness (at a 'conscious' level ) leads to a surprise in the experiencing
individual. Part of the ecstatic tingling or tingling ecstasy is
characterised by this flash  and surprise aspect.
