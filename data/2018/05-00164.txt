[INDOLOGY] On Sanskrit in the USA
For those interested, Salisbury, who founded Sanskrit studies at Yale, was
recently "rediscovered,", and there is some fascinating information about
his program of "Oriental Studies" at Yale.

Among the many interesting tidbits was that Salisbury, by his own
admission, was not much of a Sanskritist (or, much of a teacher), and had
only two Sanskrit students (none in Arabic, which he seems to have known).
One of his two students was W. D. Whitney. Whitney, went on to study in
Germany, and then was appointed at Yale through Salisbury's generosity.
Salisbury, who died around 1900, is said to have left an endowment valued
at $130,000 in 19th c. dollars. Assuming it was all in cash (and it likely
was not), that would today be an endowment of $3.5 million (US). Certainly
enough to maintain Sanskrit at Yale!
