[INDOLOGY] How ancient DNA may rewrite prehistory in India
Although this is a discussion I enter into with great hesitancy, I highly
recommend Asko Parpola's recent work, The Roots of Hinduism, for those
wishing to delve deeply into these issues. Parpola's remarkable synthesis
of the archaeological record with millennia of cultural evidence
anticipates Reich's DNA work  -- as cited in the BBC article. However,
Parpola's analysis focuses not on divisiveness (between Indus and Vedic,
etc.) in Indian culture ... but rather on the fact that India today still
reflects a cultural patrimony of great variety (likely drawn from genetic
and cultural connections stretching from India to the steppes and to
western Asia). This trend to see cultural continuity is not unknown in
recent scholarship (Biardeau; Hiltebeitel, etc.); Parpola's work, however,
carries it very far forward.
(By way of full disclosure; I recently reviewed Parpola's book.)
