Dear Lubom?r,
Many thanks for taking the time to answer my query in such detail. It is 
greatly appreciated.
I had a quick look at the Svopaj?avivara?a commentary on Y? V.61-9 which 
describe the three main n???s (i??, pi?gal?, su?um??), but did not find 
any mention of further n???s or dv?ras. I will have to look more closely 
at other passages as well, but as you mentioned yourself it does not 
seem to include a more developed system of n???s.
I might also add that about half of the approximately sixty Jain gy?n 
b?z? charts included in my analysis features a verse describing them as 
"the game of the nameless brahman" (an?mat brahm k? b?j?) which seems to 
indicate outside (possibly N?th) influence.
Once again, thank you so much.
Best regards,
Jacob
