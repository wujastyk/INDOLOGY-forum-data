Hello Lubom?re,
Even though your initial inquiry is about S??khya ontological questions, we can draw from some of the epistemological material of the YD, which shows that puru?a has no connection with vyakta, such as instruments/faculties engaged in the operation of acquiring knowledge. See YD on SK 36 (Wezler/Motegi edition), p. 223, l.1ff.

The intellect acquired the form of non-doubting awareness (adhyavas?ya) having accepted the conscious power/power of consciousness. There is no connection/bond of an internal instrument with the unintentional consciousness (puru?a)? 
 Of course, there is more to be said.
A little note: I would like to suggest that sometime we need to play a little with the way how we choose translating: vipary?sa, vipar?ta, etc., which may be understood as ?contrast? and not necessarily ?opposite.?

PS Jayama?gal? is suspected sometime that there might be other influences.
