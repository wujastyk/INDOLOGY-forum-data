Dear Professor Pinault, cher Georges-Jean,


There was a string on mirrors on INDOLOGY a few months ago. You can search the archive to find the relevant messages.


Avec mes meilleurs voeux pour 2018,


Arlo Griffiths

Dear All,   Thanks for these informations and best wishes for 2018.  I would be grateful if anyone belonging to this list can recommend me monographs or reference papers about the mirror, preferably in Classical India, under all aspects; literature, art, craft, mythology, etc.

Many thanks in advance.    Best regards,    Georges-Jean Pinault (Paris, EPHE)

Dear all,



This announcement reminds me of an expression in the Sarvadar?anasa?graha that I have difficulty understanding. On p. 418 of Abhyankar's edition (line 16.298) it mentions "showing a cloth with the imprint of the son's foot" (putrapad??kitapa?apradar?anavat) in the context of announcing the birth of a son. Does this refer to a known custom in India?
