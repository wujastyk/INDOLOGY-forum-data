[INDOLOGY] A regressive face of Indology at the World Sanskrit Conference
I did not attend WSC 2018 for that matter any WSC.
My concern is possible representation or misrepresentation of facts
regarding the issue said to have been discussed in the 'special forum'
appearently first of its kind.
Organisers of the forum , I think are on this list.
