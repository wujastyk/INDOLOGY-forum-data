As Christophe Vielle pointed out to me in a personal mail, also the Malayalam word deriving from Sanskrit camatk?ra has this meaning.
In fact, it is still to be written? I have taken interest in camatk?ra (and other crucial concepts) in the course of my ongoing research on aesthetic speculation as the basis of Utpala-Abhinava?s philosophical-religious thought (not viceversa). Two articles on this more general topic are forthcoming. Yes, ?philological' investigation, provided that we take ?philology? in its highest meaning of historical-hermeneutic-linguistic discipline dealing with ?texts? (in this regard, you might see my JAOS article of few years ago).
