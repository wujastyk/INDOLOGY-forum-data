[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit and the beginning of existence
Dear list,
I am currently writing a piece discussing the question of 'How old is
Sanskrit?' for a general audience.
To shed some light on the origins of the popular claim that Sanskrit is the
'oldest language', I am trying to find the exact passage(s) in which it is
mentioned that the universe was sung into existence through Sanskrit. Could
anyone help me with specific textual references?
Many thanks,
    Antonia
