Dear Harry,


No, the underdot is also used for instance in Bengali and Oriya script. Its used as a diacritical marker is, however, much older than the development of these modern script forms. It is found, i.a., in the Pyu script that was in use in Burma from about the 6th or 7th century onwards to mark some kind of consonantal phonetic feature. See ?3.4.4 in ?Studies in Pyu Epigraphy, I: State of the Field, Edition and Analysis of the Kan Wet Khaung Mound Inscription, and Inventory of the Corpus,? BEFEO 103 (2017).


Best wishes,


Arlo Griffiths

Thank you to Madhav Deshpande for answering offlist that Marathi doesn't use nukt? (the underneath dots in devanagari) .  Does that mean only Hindi uses nukt?  , also how modern is the use of nukt? in devanagari and related scripts ?

Dear list members,

Can someone tell me if in Marathi ? (? with dot underneath)  is used for the letter transliterated as za .  I've been told that in Marathi ? without dot underneath is used but the ISO transliteration guide has ? (? with dot underneath) for z .

Thanks,
Harry Spier
