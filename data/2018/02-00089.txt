[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY mailman migration
I have been informed by the company that hosts our INDOLOGY mail server
that the server software is being migrated later this week to a new cloud
platform.
This should be transparent to all users; you need do nothing, and service
will continue unchanged.  However, there may be an INDOLOGY forum outage
for an hour or two this week, while I am reconfiguring some technical
details of the mailman host.
Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee member.
