[INDOLOGY] Help with translation
Dear list members,
Please ignore this post I just sent.
As Madhav Deshpande just pointed out to me the version of the hymn I had
has a typo:
Its bh?lek?a??nala-vi?o?ita-pa?ca-b?nam not bhalek?a??nala-vi?o?ita-pa?ca-b?nam
so the question I asked makes no sense.
Thank you,
Harry Spier
