[INDOLOGY] A terminological question
elegant' effectively remove the early Buddhist sangha from the original
socio-economic context of its aims and activities.
In the already classic example: the shift from 'smith' to 'goldsmith', from
'hog's mincemeat' to 'truffles', locates, effectively, the Buddha and his
disciples in the world unknown to them.
In their world Cunda is a village smith; he offers them shelter and a local
delicacy: minced pork.
As a village artisan Cunda seems to represent the main social group
addressed by the Buddha's message: the people actively involved in the
process of change, civilizational change.
As retold by some of the translators, the story drags the Buddha's name
into politics, in its local and, consequently, general manifestations.
Cunda, a rich goldsmith (rare truffles in dishes offered to his noble
guests) becomes a natural addressee of the Buddha's message. By accepting
his invitation, the Buddha confirms Cunda's high status and, symbolically,
separates himself from other, less successful members of the community.
There are many other - although not always so evident - examples of such
translatorial practices.
The need to recognize similar textual traps, with their interpretative
temptations, is what makes translating the Mahaparibbana-sutta (in my case
- into Polish) a difficult but exciting project.
Thanking for your comments, greetings & regards from over-hot Warsaw,
