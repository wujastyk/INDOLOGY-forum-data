[INDOLOGY] Dalip Kaur Tiwana
Dear Friends,
Dalip Kaur Tiwana's  "Within without":
I am looking - so far unsuccessfully - for the translation of the poem from
the original Punjabi into English. Is there any?
Regards,
Artur Karp (ret.)
Chair of South-Asian Studies

PS. Would anyone want to read my - so far unpublished - translation of the
poem into Polish?
Artur
