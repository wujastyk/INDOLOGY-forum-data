[INDOLOGY] French Institute at Pondicherry
Interesting question. I suppose you mean an external point of view, not the brief self-description that can be read on http://www.ifpindia.org/the-institute? If anything exists, I am sure its librarian Anurupa Naik, who I believe is on this list, will know.

Dear all,
Is there are work on the history and functions of the French Institute, in either French or English?
Thank you!
