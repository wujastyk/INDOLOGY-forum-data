[INDOLOGY] The universe as an image in a mirror
Dear Harry,
The image is definitely widespread in Buddhist materials, both tantric and non-tantric. One of the five aspects of the Buddha's gnosis (pa?caj??na) is "mirror-like gnosis" (?dar?aj??na), in which, according to the ca. 4th century
Mah?y?nas?tr?la?k?ra (Bodhyadhik?ra)
all that is knowable is reflected. I am sorry that I do not have the time at my disposal to identify additionalsources for you, but the famous article by Paul Demi?ville,
? Le miroir spirituel ?, Sinologica, I, 2, Basel, 1947,, pp. 112-137,
may prove helpful (I do not recall now whether he considers only Chinese materials there or includes Buddhist canonical sources).
Given the intertextuality between later Indian Buddhism and Kashmir Saivism, it is not surprising that the metaphor would be found in the latter sources as well.
hope this helps to get you started,
Matthew

[INDOLOGY] The universe as an image in a mirror
The first verse of the Dak?in?m?rtistotram is:
vi?va? darpa?a-d??yam?na-nagar?-tulya? nij?ntar-gata?
pa?yann-?tmani m?yay? bahir ivodbhuta? yath? nidray?
ya? s?k??t kurute prabodha-samaye sv?tmanam ev?dvaya?
tasmai ?ri-guru-m?rtaye nama ida? ?ri-dak?in?m?rtaye
One of the reasons Amarhath Rai in his article "The Daksinamurti Hymn and the Manasollasa published in Vol. 6 of The Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, 1932 gives for rejecting Sankaracarya as the author is  the metaphor in the first verse of the world as an image in a mirror.
Does  this metaphor of the world as an image in a mirror only appear in Kashmir Shaivite writings or does it occur in  the writings of other religous or philosophical schools.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
