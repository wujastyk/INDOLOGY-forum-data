[INDOLOGY] Help identifying the deity of a gayatri mantra
Dear list members,
The Vaikhanasamantraprasna contains this gayatri mantra
r?jar?j?ya vidmahe
dhan?dhyak?y?ya dh?mahi
tan nas soma? pracoday?t
Monier-Williams identifies dhan?dhyak?ya as Kubera.
Is this a gayatri mantra to Kubera or to Soma as the moon, or to the elixir
Soma?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
