Dear Piotr

Thank you heartily for these! Indeed I think Schayer remains
underappreciated (I would say the same about his student Constantine
Regamey, well-known, in fact, but rather as a composer of modern music; the
published biography does not so much as mention his scholarship, which was
however appreciated in a paper by the late Jacques May, the reference to
which I do not have to hand). It might be not pointless to mention also
here O filozofowaniu Hindus?w: artykuly wybrane/On philosophizing of the
Hindus: selected papers. By Stanislaw Schayer, edited by Marek Mejor. pp.
xxxiii, 539, illus. Warsaw, Polish Scientific Publishers for the Polish
Academy of Sciences, Committee for Oriental Studies, 1988 [I have
copy-pasted this, so apologies for infelicities]. I have seen this volume,
long ago, but to my memory none of the contributions are translated...

Very best thanks! Jonathan
