Dear Madhav,

Thanks for this, Madhav.
I was fortunate to be a student at Berkeley when Jaini arrived in 72 and have always continued to learn from his extraordinary scholarship. A revered guru!
Best,

[INDOLOGY] Professor Jaini's 95th birthday?I was so fortunate to attend Professor Padmanabh Jaini's 95th birthday celebration yesterday at the University of California in Berkeley. In 1972, Jaini left Michigan for Berkeley, and I became his replacement in Michigan. He is a giant in the fields of Buddhist and Jain Studies, and it was wonderful to see the love of his students and colleagues for him.
