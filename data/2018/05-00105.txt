[INDOLOGY] Spaces between words in Sanskrit manuscripts?
This is a fascinating thread, and Camillo's remarks that there is still
much to be done in this area, certainly ring true.
Although McComas's initial concern was to find out when the scribes started
inserting spaces, I want to reiterate that the use of spaces is really a
European tradition, based on the fact that Europeans had become by the 19th
century were no longer comfortable with unspaced texts. (Unspaced printing
had been a European tradition, pre-1000.) In fact, many written cultures do
not use spaced texts, so we should in no way presume it is a "better" (or,
more "advanced") way of presenting text. Extensive presentation of Indian
texts with spacing likely is to be matched to the rise of printed texts in
India, which was initially directed by Europeans (Carey, Colebrooke, etc).
Related to this are the many 19th discussions of transliterated text, which
presume Sanskrit would be "easier" to read for Westerners (especially)
missionaries. This, too, is a ridiculous presupposition...
