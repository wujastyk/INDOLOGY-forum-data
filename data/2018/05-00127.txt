[INDOLOGY] Continuing my Krishna verses
Continuing with my Krishna verses:

At that (ancient time) on the holy battlefield of the Kurus, the Kauravas
and P???avas killed all the eighteen armies.
????? ????? ?????????? ????? ?????? ?
?????????? ?? ???? ???? ???????????: ???????
O Kr???a, a battle goes on even in my mind all the time.  My mind has
created its own Kauravas and P???avas.
???????: ?????????? ? ?????? ???????? ?
??????? ??????? ?????? ??????????????????? ???????
Born together, these Kauravas and P???avas do not tolerate each other, and
they constantly create unbearable attacks on my mind.
???????? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ???? ?
??????????????????? ????? ???????????: ???????
Like Bh??ma fallen on the ground [in the Mahabharata battle], I watch this
battle raging around me.  How will these Kauravas and P???avas [in my mind]
stop this battle?
?????????????????? ?? ???????? ??????: ?
????? ??? ??????? ????? ?? ???? ???????
Modulations of my mind have become these Kauravas and P???avas.  To stop
them from battling, I need your help, O Kr???a.
?????????????????????? ? ? ????????????? ????? ?

Raising up my arms, I call them out, but no one listens to me.  O Kr???a,
perhaps these unrestrained warriors might listen to you.
?????????????????? ?? ??? ?? ???????????: ?

If my Kauravas and P???avas were to see your cosmic form, they would
certainly stop battling, and my mind will attain peace.

Struck with my own arrows, how shall I find peace, O Lord?  Perhaps, a
pleasant touch of your hand may pacify my pain.
???????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ?

When in the battle the P???avas were about to be completely destroyed, O
Lord, you compassionately saved five of them from fire.
????????????????????? ???????? ???????? ?
?? ????????????? ??? ???? ????? ???????
The house of my mind is burning with fierce flames.  O Compassionate Lord,
quench this fire with the shower of your sweetness.
