Continuing with my Krishna verses:

???????????? ???????????? ??? ???????????: ?

?????????????????????? ????? ???????? ???????

At that (ancient time) on the holy battlefield of the Kurus, the Kauravas
and P???avas killed all the eighteen armies.


????? ????? ?????????? ????? ?????? ?

?????????? ?? ???? ???? ???????????: ???????

O Kr???a, a battle goes on even in my mind all the time.  My mind has
created its own Kauravas and P???avas.


???????: ?????????? ? ?????? ???????? ?

??????? ??????? ?????? ??????????????????? ???????

Born together, these Kauravas and P???avas do not tolerate each other, and
they constantly create unbearable attacks on my mind.


???????? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ???? ?

??????????????????? ????? ???????????: ???????

Like Bh??ma fallen on the ground [in the Mahabharata battle], I watch this
battle raging around me.  How will these Kauravas and P???avas [in my mind]
stop this battle?


?????????????????? ?? ???????? ??????: ?

????? ??? ??????? ????? ?? ???? ???????

Modulations of my mind have become these Kauravas and P???avas.  To stop
them from battling, I need your help, O Kr???a.


?????????????????????? ? ? ????????????? ????? ?

?????????????: ????? ???? ?? ?????????: ???????

Raising up my arms, I call them out, but no one listens to me.  O Kr???a,
perhaps these unrestrained warriors might listen to you.


?????????????????? ?? ??? ?? ???????????: ?

?????? ?????????????????? ?????????? ???? ????? ???????

If my Kauravas and P???avas were to see your cosmic form, they would
certainly stop battling, and my mind will attain peace.


?????: ???????????? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?

????? ?? ?????????: ???????????? ?? ???????

Struck with my own arrows, how shall I find peace, O Lord?  Perhaps, a
pleasant touch of your hand may pacify my pain.


???????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ?

?????? ???????: ???? ?????? ???? ????? ???????

When in the battle the P???avas were about to be completely destroyed, O
Lord, you compassionately saved five of them from fire.


????????????????????? ???????? ???????? ?

?? ????????????? ??? ???? ????? ???????

The house of my mind is burning with fierce flames.  O Compassionate Lord,
quench this fire with the shower of your sweetness.
