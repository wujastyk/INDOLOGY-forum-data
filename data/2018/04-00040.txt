The /Akan????u/ is an anthology of four hundred long poems (12-30 lines) 
on love (/akam) /that belongs to the Eight Collections (/e??uttokai) of 
the Classical Tamil Ca?kam corpus. /Its//first book, Ka?i??iy??ainirai 
(?Row of Bull Elephants?), comprising the first one-hundred twenty 
poems, is here critically re-edited on the basis of the surviving eight 
manuscripts ? among which five are fairly old palm-leaf copies ? and of 
the numerous quotations found in the grammatical tradition. A special 
layout has been developed to allow the synoptic representation of both 
extant transmission strands. The edition is accompanied by an 
interlinear English version and by an annotated translation. The 
introduction (in English and in Tamil) discusses in detail the history 
of the text and the editing procedure. Volume 3 comprises an edition of 
the old commentary, a complete analytical concordance, a glossary and 
several indexes.
