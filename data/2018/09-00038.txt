Dear colleagues,
Dharma and Bhakti start from the faith.Only that Tarka[logic] is
permissible there which is approved by
Veda-Shastras.Tarkaapratisthaanaat.// As far as the Srimad Bhagavata
is concerned acc. to Indian Vaisnav Saints  Shukadeva ji approached
his father Veda Vyasa.He began to narrate the srimadBhagavata and as
soon as  Radha's name was pronounced Shukadeva reached the stage of
Samaadhi.This is why Veda Vyasa removed Radha's name from the
SrimadBhagavata.But in several contacts Radha is mentioned
indirectly.During the Raasalilaa Gopis, looking for srikrisna, went to
the middle part of the forest and found a particular Gopi sitting with
tears in her eyes.VedaVyasa sings,
" anayaaraadhito nunam Bhagavaan Harir iishvarah/ Yan no vihaaya
govindah priityaa taam anayad rahah"
Radha's name was removed but the root radh with upasarga "aa"has been
used.    In some other contexts the word raadhas ha been employed and
somewhere Radha is remembered in different styles.        In other
Puranas such as Padma,Skanda,Brahmavaivarta,DeviBhagavata and the like
Radha's name has been directly written.Many Pancharatra texts also
read Radha's name directly.The Gargasamhita depicts Radha in detail.
Radha and Krisna are anaadisiddha nitya divya dampatii in
Goloke.WhenKrishna came to the Martyaloke Radha became the role model
for devotion in parakiyaa bhaava. This is why Radha is not married to
Krisna.Vaisnavas of different schools consider Radha their svaamini [
aadyaa  aachaaryaa].         In the Gagasamhita and some other texts
there is a legend that many devotees expressed their desire to marry
or embrace sri Ram. He prohibited them as he was Ekapatnivrata and
inspired them to come to Dvaapara for Kaantaa bhaava.This is one of
various reasons of Krisnaavataara.These things are the matter of firm
belief.If you would try to prove these things on logic then the whole
theism
fall and scatter on the ground.
Dear Indologists,I came to know this idea at the lotus feet of old
saints.There are many other things and texts which I could not quote
for fear of expansion.
If my views are not acceptable please excuse me.
Iti RadhaKrisnadaasaanudaasakinkarasya Girish Kumar Jha sharmanah.
