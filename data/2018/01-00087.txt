Dear Colleagues and Friends,
At long last I received the much awaited news that the Journal is  
indeed still alive, but now located at the new website:
  www.asiainstitutetorino.it/Indologica

Thanks to Dominik Wujastyk, we could also use the information he  
kindly provided us soon after Christmas:
"The indologica.com website exists in many historical snapshots at the  
WayBackMachine (archive.org).  See, for example, the snapshot of 21  
June 2017:
https://web.archive.org/web/20170621131741/http://www.indologica.com:80/ "
This is also still active.

With best wishes,
Jay Soni
