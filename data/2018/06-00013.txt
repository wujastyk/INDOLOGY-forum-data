Right; the EWA is not accessible to me right now.

Renou (introduction g?n?rale to Wackernagel), p. 29-30, accepts gopendra as the source, with folk etymology (not his term) of MIAr. govinda (fr. Skt. gopendra) as based on go and vid; and in note 438 he states that this has been accepted by Mayrhofer in his EWA. ? ?Ainsi govinda- ?p?tre? (surnom de K???a), forme m.i., s?est accr?dit?e en place du synonnyme gopendra- [438], parce qu?on pouvait la relier ? vid- (vindati)[439] et l?analyser en go-vinda- ?qui trouve our procure des vaches?.'

I remind everyone that Manfred Mayrhofer spent his entire life writing etymological dictionaries of Sanskrit, the Etymologisches W?rterbuch des Altindoarischen and the Kurzgefasstes etymologisches W?rterbuch des Altindischen. Even if you don't read German (and the KEWA has English glosses), you are always better off trying to make sense of his comments than Whitney's (or almost anyone else's) guesses. For most of the words mentioned in this thread, he has reliable and relatively up-to-date comments. He refers to the two possible explanations for g?vinda- (including references to Vedic g?v?d- and g?vind?-, ga?? ?vindan, Avestan v?dat?.gu-, etc.) and adduces ????????? ?chickpea? and Kannada are-viri ?be half open? in the case of aravinda-.

fwiw: Another possible source of govinda is gopendra ?chief of the cowherds?

Thank you Madhav,

You mention aravinda as possibly non-indo-european.  Does that also apply to govinda?
Monier-Williams has govinda as go-vinda with vinda ifc as "finding".  But I vaguely recall (though I can't find it anymore) that MacDonells or Whitneys grammar   had a footnote somewhere that the etymology of govinda was uncertain and that it might be from go+indra through the prakrit.

I was under the impression that words like Mukunda, Aravinda, Maranda, Mucakunda were historically of non-Indo-European origin.  Did Michael Witzel write something about such words?  Trying to remember.  Best,

Dear list members,

Can someone give the etymology of mukunda?

Is the information in Monier-Williams under "muku" a folk-etymology?
muku = mukti (a word formed to explain mukun-da as "giver of liberation")

Thanks,
Harry Spier
