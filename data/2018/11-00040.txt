[INDOLOGY] English translations of Chinese books
Dear friends,
One of my friends has asked for help in locating and if possible in
getting  the English translations of a few Chinese books
. He says,
"There was a ancient Chinese historian called Zheng Qiao (1104-1162)
He wrote an ancient chinese reference book called "Tongzhi" and
another book called Lun Fanshu ( On Sanskrit Books)
In Tongzhi,I have learnt that Zheng Qiao has a few essays on sanskrit.
I am looking for English translations of these Chinese books. "
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance for the help.
Regards,
