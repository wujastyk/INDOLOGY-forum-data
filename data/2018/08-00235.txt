I am sure that he will add this himself, but our colleague David Reigle has
published online:

http://www.easterntradition.org/article/Bibliographic%20Guide%20-%20Sankaracarya's%20Original%20Works.pdf

http://www.easterntradition.org/article/Bibliographic%20Guide%20-%20Sankaracarya's%20Collected%20Works.pdf

Both of these might be highly useful to you.
