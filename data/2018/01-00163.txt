=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pur=C4=81=E1=B9=87as,_"resembling_the_belly_of_a_mirror"?=
Dear Madhav,
Though glass mirrors were produced in India (from 1500 CE in western India according to one article I?ve read), the references must be to mirrors made from polished metal.
One ?ilpa??stra text prescribes that a mirror should be very round (suv?tta) and have a raised rim (though surviving mirrors don?t always have a raised rim). As such the mirror?s belly (udara) must be the polished part inside the rim or the edge of the mirror.
Your suggestion of ?highly polished? makes sense and what I had in mind with ?smooth, polished, clean.? But I?m honestly not entirely sure how exactly the diagram, ma??ala, would look like. Since mirrors were generally perfect circles, is a shape implied here?
All best wishes,
Toke

Before this question can be answered, we need to figure out what the darpa?as were made of.  Was it a glass mirror as we now have it, or was it a highly polished plate of metal?  If it is the latter, your description probably refers to "highly polished."  Just a thought.

Dear all,
I?m looking at some pur??ic passages where the expression ?resembling the belly of a mirror? occurs.
Li?gapur??a 2.28.47-48 (all references in this email are drawn from GRETIL) has:
?r?yat?? parama? guhya? vedikoparima??alam /
a??am??gulasa?yukta? ma?gal?kura?obhitam //
phalapu?pasam?k?r?a? dh?pad?pasamanvitam /
vedimadhye prakartavya? darpa?odarasannibham //
The verses speak of a diagram, ma??ala, to be drawn in the center of the altar, vedi. The expression darpa?odarasannibham, ?resembling the belly of a mirror,? is used with reference to the ma??ala.
Li?gapur??a 1.8.83 has:
atyantanirmale samyak supralipte vicitrite /
darpa?odarasa?k??e k????garusudh?pite //
The context is the location where a practitioner should engage in yoga. The expression darpa?odarasa?k??e, ?resembling the belly of a mirror,? is used to describe a characteristic the place should have.
The ?ivapur??a 7.2,29.11-13 has:
na tu prayogo bhidyeta vak?yam??asya karma?a? /
par?k?ya bh?mi? vidhivadga?dhavar?aras?dibhi? //
manobhila?ite tatra vit?navitat??bare /
supralipte mah?p???he darpa?odarasa?nibhe //
pr?c?mutp?dayetp?rva? ??strad???ena vartman? /
ekahasta? dvihasta? v? ma??ala? parikalpayet //
The context here is the ground on which the diagram, ma??ala, is placed. The expression darpa?odarasa?nibhe, ?resembling the belly of a mirror,? is used to describe the ground.
I?m interested in the image of a belly of a mirror used in the passages. The most obvious interpretation is that the image conveys something smooth, polished, and clean, as we would want a mirror to be; imperfections and dirt would distort the image we see in the mirror. I doubt that ?reflective? is meant, though ?shining? is a possibility.
My question is if the image could be used to indicate shape in some way? I doubt ?concave? or ?convex? shape is meant, but perhaps ?round? or ?flat??
With all best wishes,
Toke
