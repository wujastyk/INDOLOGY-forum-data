Subject: [INDOLOGY] A terminological question

A side note, not directly relevant to the terminological issue:

I think that the question of what Cunda served the Buddha is not one likely
to be decided on ideological grounds. Perhaps it is known what the social
status of "truffles" was in Ancient North India, and that vis-a-vis the
status of pork, but I do not know it, and I think it is a bit incautious
for us to assume that this was necessarily a higher-status food just
because it is for us (in general). There is, as I recall, considerable
philological investigation of the identification of the Buddha's last meal,
although I confess that I don't recall what the latest idea is, or whether
it has been generally accepted by specialists. (I recall that Oskar von
Hin?ber wrote about it relatively recently, or at least I think I recall
this...).

As I said, however, this is a separate issue from that of "cleaning up"
translations, and we might, in that sense, extend it to questions about
tone and style as well: if something is roughly written, even
"ungrammatical," is translating into grammatical and even smooth
English/German etc. translation or does it too fall under the category you
are discussing? (I recently worked on a Buddhist text in which the grammar
in Skt was something of a mess, often impossible, although the meaning was
quite clear. If i 'fix' it am I improving / raising its level?)

best, Jonathan
