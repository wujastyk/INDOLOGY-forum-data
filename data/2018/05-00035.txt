[INDOLOGY] Date of the Tolkappiyam
Dear Herman,
I do not see what is /ad hominem/ in my statement.
Jan's sentence is ambiguous.
It could mean
(A) the most generally accepted etymogy of Tolk?ppiyam [AMONG THOSE WHO 
HAVE STUDIED THAT TREATISE] is "old K?vya"
or
(B) the most generally accepted etymogy of Tolk?ppiyam [AMONG 
INDOLOGISTS IN GENERAL] is "old K?vya"
What I am saying is that (B) may be true but that I believe (A) is not true.
Best wishes
