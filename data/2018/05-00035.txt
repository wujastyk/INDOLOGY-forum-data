Dear Herman,

I do not see what is /ad hominem/ in my statement.

Jan's sentence is ambiguous.

It could mean

(A) the most generally accepted etymogy of Tolk?ppiyam [AMONG THOSE WHO 
HAVE STUDIED THAT TREATISE] is "old K?vya"

or

(B) the most generally accepted etymogy of Tolk?ppiyam [AMONG 
INDOLOGISTS IN GENERAL] is "old K?vya"

What I am saying is that (B) may be true but that I believe (A) is not true.

Best wishes

-- Jean-Luc

I refer to the sentence "It is indeed an opinion current among those who have not read Tolk?ppiyam", by which Jan Houben is set aside and disqualified to express an idea about the origin of the title Tolk?ppiyam. All this, only to get rid of the word k?vya in the name Tolk?ppiyam. Strictly speaking this move is not even necessary, that is, unnecessary for those who claim an early date of Ca?kam poetry, as the word k?vya is almost certainly older than the 9th century; see Stephanie Jamison, The Rig Veda Between Two Worlds, p. 144.
