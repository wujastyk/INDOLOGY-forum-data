=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Vy=C4=81sayogicarita?=
Dear Indologists,
I am looking for a digital copy of Soman?tha?s Vy?sayogicarita, which seems to be unavailable everywhere. I wonder if someone in this list may kindly help me in this matter.
Thanking in advance, I wish good work to all of you.
Best regards,
