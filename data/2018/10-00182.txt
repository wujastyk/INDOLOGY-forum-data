[INDOLOGY] logical fallacies
Thanks, Jonathan, for being rather clear; and, as you say, 'old fashioned'.
It would help if I were currently in any of those three locations to access
these books. This might explain the current search for a digital copy. Had
someone not already sent me a copy of not one volume, not two volumes, but
all three volumes, I probably won't have to worry about those things called
printed books.
All the best,
