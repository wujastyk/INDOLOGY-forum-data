Dear Madhavji,

Have you checked the supersite of IIT-K which has the text for all the
important commentaries including ?ankara and Madhva.

https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in

Also the following paper appears to discuss the topic in detail, which I
have only a snippet view access on google books:

Bhavani, Sudhindra: Is Arjuna amadhyamadhikarin? [Engl.]. In: Studies in
Indian history and culture: volume presented to Dr. P. B. Desai ... 1971. -
pp. 412-415

The following snippet appears to confirm Sankara proposed  Arjuna  as a
Madhyamadhikarin.

Madhva has therefore, hastened to correct this impression left by ?ankara
and dispel the myth of *Arjuna's* being a *Madhyamadhikarin*. At the very
beginning of his G?ta-Tatparya he hails Arjuna as a front rank Adhikari
(Uttamadhikari) and as the best beloved of the Lord (Atmanah priyatamah).

Regards,
Suresh.
