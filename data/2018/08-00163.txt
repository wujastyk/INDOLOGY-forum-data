O M? [= Lakshmi], my mind is attached to you. Don?t go away from my
vicinity. The Lord of M?, who constantly says ?O M? O M? [?? ??], steals

Shiva resides with Uma always on the Himalaya mountain, and Vishnu too with
M? [= Lakshmi] always resides on the great ocean.

I know the strange reason for their behavior. All the gods are terrified of
the bed bugs.
