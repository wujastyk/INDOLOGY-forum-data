Dear Paolo,


Interesting parallels. If you read my introduction, you'll see that I think the eroticism, while everywhere in evidence, is frequently misunderstood. And the cult of the yogini seems a relatively minor aspect of Candella religion, though undeniably present.


In any case, your work may well reveal other perspectives.


good luck with your project,

Matthew

Dear Metthew,

thanks! My books are packed because I'm moving to a new flat and the department's library is closed in August, so it's quite difficult to read new material.

I don't know if I'll never try to plan a project on Chandelas. But I find strong analogies with the Pala of Kamarupa (that now is my main geographical area of research):

Both are supposed to be hinduized or mixed-blood (samkarajati) dynasties.
Both reigned between the X and the XIII century CE.
Both were linked to the cult of the yogini.
Both produced erotic sculpures.

So, I need to know much more about Chandelas, their origins and their religious life - maybe through the iconographical study of their temples.

Best,
Paolo

Dear Paolo,


Please see the introduction to my translation of the Prabodhacandrodaya, available here:

https://www.academia.edu/27671250/Introduction_to_The_Rise_of_Wisdom_Moon_Prabodhacandrodaya_


It certainly does not include everything about the Candellas, but it does have some additional references for you. I am sorry that I do not have pdf-s, however -- I was using old-fashioned xerox copies that are now in a storage box and not easy for me to access. If your project on the Candellas will continue for some months, I will be happy to see if I can locate what I have and then send it to you in the autumn, I do not believe that I will be returning to Candella studies myself. A lot of the useful work on the Candellas, by the way, is in Hindi.


best of luck,

Matthew

Dear all,

I am looking for a pdf of

Su??la Kum?ra Sullere. 2004. Chandella Art.
Dikshit, R.K. 1976. The Candellas of Jej?kabhukti

I also would appreciate any suggestion for publications that studied ritual and religious life during the Chandela's kingdom (X-XIII c.).

Best,
Paolo
