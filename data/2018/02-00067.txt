[INDOLOGY] PDF of Gokulanatha's 'Vidyota' commentary?
Dear List,
Might anyone be able to share a PDF of Gokulanatha Upadhyaya's commentary
on Raghunatha Siromani's *Di?dhiti*, published as the
*Anumitidi?dhiti-vidyota*?
This was published in 1982 from Darbhanga and edited by Dharmanath Jha and
Ramsevak Jha.
Thanks very much,
Sam
