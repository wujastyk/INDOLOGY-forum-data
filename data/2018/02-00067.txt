Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF of Gokulanatha's 'Vidyota' commentary?
Message-ID: <CAOYLp6+7ajyFB7Qp=6VO_a_f4L=NF+O0VeoN_0K9K_-i4rtSdA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

Might anyone be able to share a PDF of Gokulanatha Upadhyaya's commentary
on Raghunatha Siromani's *Di?dhiti*, published as the
*Anumitidi?dhiti-vidyota*?

This was published in 1982 from Darbhanga and edited by Dharmanath Jha and
Ramsevak Jha.

Thanks very much,
Sam
