=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pa=E1=B9=ADhan=C4=81rtha_and_v=C4=81can=C4=81rtha?=
Here is an example of a colophon from a 19th-century Jaina gy?n b?z? 
from western India:
???????? ?? ????????? ???? ?????? ???? ?????? ?????????
[written for the purpose of "v?cana/v?can?" by lay follower Keso R??mj? 
(under the instruction of?) Pa??it Lak?min? Je?h]
The whole thing is written in Devan?gar? except for the "j?" which is 
written in Gujarati script. Following Sweta Prajapati's suggestion, I 
checked the meaning of "v?cana" (neuter substantive) and "v??cavu?" 
(verb) in Mehta & Mehta's "Modern Gujarati-English Dictionary" from 1925 
(the only one currently available to me). Both indicate "reading, 
perusal, study" as the main meanings.
However, based on the examples provided by Rolf Heinrich Koch, I wonder 
whether v?can?rtha could also be understood in the sense that the 
drawing of the gy?n b?z? was assigned as a lesson.
Many thanks for your continued help in this matter.
Kind regards,
Jacob
