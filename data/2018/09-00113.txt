[INDOLOGY] Scientification in India
Dear Axel,
I look forward to the final version of your contribution of which I heard a
fascinating presentation in Delhi in November 2015. As you know, Frits
Staal first expanded the concept of "science" beyond the narrow confines of
"natural sciences" in order not just to include "human sciences" but also
to go beyond the division between these and the natural sciences; next he
showed how "India" contributed, at an early date, significantly and
foremost to this "science" in a broadened sense, esp. to ritual science and
linguistic science. Current "scientifications" as in the mentioned
brochure, however, neglect India's contributions in ritual science (kalpa)
and linguistic science (grammar, vyakarana) except for marginally
mentioning phonetics: taking the narrow concept of "(natural, including, at
the most, medical) science" as main reference point they make every effort
to find "relevant" statements in ancient Indian literature (for Ayurveda
only Sanskrit texts are considered, Siddha texts in Tamil are neglected;
for other knowledge systems I am not aware of serious "Dravidian"
counterclaims).
In this context a question to all list members, does anyone have a scan of
Frits Staal's* What Euclid is to Europe, Panini is to India -- or are they?*
published in Bangalore, India: National Institute of Advanced Studies,
2005.
