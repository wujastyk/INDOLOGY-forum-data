[INDOLOGY] Fame
Dear All:
I am reaching out to find out any studies (thematic, word-study, etc.) on the concept of ?fame? in classical India: ya?as, k?rtti, etc. I got some information a while back from Jarrod Whitaker, but thought I would reach out more broadly to see whether there are any studies that I am not aware of. With thanks and best wishes,
Patrick
