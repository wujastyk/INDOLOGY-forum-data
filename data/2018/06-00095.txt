Dear Dan,

thanks for this reference. As you say, this reflects a pre-classical or proto-S??khya teaching; in classical S??khya all puru?as are the same, there are no different types or kinds of puru?as. 

Jayama?gal? is probably the latest among the pre-Kaumud? commentaries and stays a bit apart from other commentaries. Sure, it might reflect some older teaching that survived outside the S??khya mainstream. But the question whether each puru?a is all-pervasive all the time or only when liberated seems to me rather crucial. All commentaries apparently take it for granted that puru?as are all-pervasive all the time, only Jayama?gal? for some reason distinguishes between liberated and non-liberated puru?a. This puzzles me. 

I simply do not understand how could puru?a (being an absolutely passive, reflective consciousness devoid of any activity) have any capacity for changing itself?

Best,
Lubomir

I cannot answer the question of my students how could puru?a (who is absolutely passive etc.) change itself so dramatically? And where does this concept occur in classical S??khya? Could you please help me with these answers? I am not a specialist in S??khya, we have this seminar just for fun, so I probably missed something in S??khya teaching on puru?a. I promised to my students that I will ask this learned forum to get the right answers.
