Dear Dan,
thanks for this reference. As you say, this reflects a pre-classical or proto-S??khya teaching; in classical S??khya all puru?as are the same, there are no different types or kinds of puru?as. 
Jayama?gal? is probably the latest among the pre-Kaumud? commentaries and stays a bit apart from other commentaries. Sure, it might reflect some older teaching that survived outside the S??khya mainstream. But the question whether each puru?a is all-pervasive all the time or only when liberated seems to me rather crucial. All commentaries apparently take it for granted that puru?as are all-pervasive all the time, only Jayama?gal? for some reason distinguishes between liberated and non-liberated puru?a. This puzzles me. 
I simply do not understand how could puru?a (being an absolutely passive, reflective consciousness devoid of any activity) have any capacity for changing itself?
Best,
Lubomir
