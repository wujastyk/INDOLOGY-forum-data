Dear scholars,

I am looking for published commentaries on Yogasutra. The attached work
mentioned 21 such published Sanskrit commentaries in bibliography from page
55-57.

I have been able to locate book 3 in this list.
I would appreciate if any scholar can point to pdf or purchasable copy of
any of the above work.
Also any other Sanskrit commentaries on Yoga works would be welcome.

Best wishes
