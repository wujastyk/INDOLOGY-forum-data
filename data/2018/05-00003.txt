[INDOLOGY] Prof. Madhav Deshpande at SOAS, the University of Cambridge and the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies_amended
Dear Colleagues,
the poster for Prof. Deshpande's visit to the UK needed to be slightly
amended. All the dates, times and places remain unchanged. Please find the
new version attached.
I look forward to seeing you in London, Oxford and Cambridge.
All the best,
Lidia Wojtczak
