Dear friends and respected colleagues,

if you plan a visit to Germany in April, please consider attending the next
Coffee Break Conference in T?bingen, 9--11.4.2018. Coffee Break Conferences
are chances for active interactions, reading is banned and discussions are
welcome. This eight instantiation will focus on European and Asian
Renaissances.

I am attaching the program, but in case you don't receive it, you can find
all infos here:

Looking forward to seeing you in T?bingen,

elisa (freschi)
