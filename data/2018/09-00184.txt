Subject: [INDOLOGY] Persian (?) seal on spurious Chola plates
Message-ID: <CANVHsm6ru8RacwJj4ZrGQhO28kqAaFqNRAF_q7MJNkX-OKdwMw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am presently studying a set of spurious Chola copper plates (in Tamil and
Telugu) in the Chennai Government Museum from available descriptions and
translations (no illustrations, unfortunately).
Sources mention that the plates bear a Persian seal.
In the catalogue of copper-plates of the Museum Srinivasa Ayyangar (1918,
p. 15) writes:

?This and the subjoined eleven grants are more or less similar in
character. Two of them are exactly alike, while the rest differ in minor
details. These bear a seal at the top of the plates, in which is inscribed,
in *Persian*, ?*R?h?lilla*? which means *dharma or charity* and another
seal at the end of the inscription, in which is inscribed, in Telugu,
?yekk?l App?j??.?

Could anybody kindly enlighten me on ?R?h?lilla?? Is it Persian? Arabic?
Both? What does it mean precisely? Are other examples known?

A subsidiary question concerns ?yekk?l App?j??? What does it mean? Note
that Burgess & Na???a ??str? (1886, pp. 137ff.), who edited and translated
some of these plates, record variant readings of ?Yekk?l App?j?? on some of
the plates:
?Yek?l App?j??, ?Ekk?lu App?j??.
There is also a Telugu seal reading ?Yajva App?j??.
