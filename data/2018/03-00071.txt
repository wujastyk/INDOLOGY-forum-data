[INDOLOGY] requesting an article
Dear all,
I am trying to access an article titled, "A Fifteenth Century G?tagovinda
Manuscript with Gujarati Paintings." The author is M.R. Mazumdar. The essay
was published in the Journal of the University of Bombay (1938) Vol. 6, pt.
6, pp. 123-137.
I would be grateful to anyone who is able to share this article with me.
With best wishes,
Jahnabi
