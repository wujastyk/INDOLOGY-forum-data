[INDOLOGY] Cologne online Sanskrit dictionaries new interface (also for Pune, Apte, etc.)
Speaking of important tools for Indological scholarship, there was a post
sometime ago about a reliable mirror site for the ndli (I believe). I
cannot find the post in the archive. Does anyone recall the site (or, am I
imagining the thread...?)
Thanks,
Herman Tull
