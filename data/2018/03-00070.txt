  I would like to thank Drs. Oranskaia, Tieken, and Koch for the very
helpful references regarding *pavitthara*: it is plenty to work with for
while, in the hopes of elucidating this interesting word. I seize the
occasion to ask: does anyone have, or is aware of a digitized text of the
*Vasudevahi??i*?
