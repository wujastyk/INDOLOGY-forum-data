[INDOLOGY] Help identifying the deity of a gayatri mantra
While we?re at it, does anyone know of sources exploring the theoretical basis for or historical development of these ?gayatris?? 
For example, in what sense is the mantra below a ?gayatri? beyond containing the verbs dh?mahi and pracoday?t? Is there any relation postulated between the 'gayatris' of Kubera etc. and Gayatri as a goddess? 
 With thanks,
