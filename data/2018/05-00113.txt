[INDOLOGY] Spaces between words in Sanskrit manuscripts? > in inscriptions
I'm not sure whether this has been mentioned, but I briefly discussed 
the question of word division in inscriptions in my Indian Epigraphy 
book, p. 67. Basically, it is not found in Sanskrit inscriptions but 
does occur in some Prakrit inscriptions, mainly from the earlier periods.
