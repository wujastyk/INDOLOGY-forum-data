Multiple grants between $500-$5000USD are awarded annually to support generative research collaborations between scholars located in different geographical regions who wish to pursue focused, joint projects in any area of the study of religion.

In the past, numerous scholars working on South Asia have been recipients of CIRG awards to fund joint projects in diverse areas of the study of South Asian religions?see the list of previous awardees<https://www.aarweb.org/programs-services/collaborative-international-research-grants-awarded>.
