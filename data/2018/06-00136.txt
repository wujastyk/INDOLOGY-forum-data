Dear Madhav,
Thank you so much for your note. I noticed this usage of bh?gola in Asoke Chatterjee?s ?Padma-pur??a?A Study?:
https://archive.org/stream/PadmaPuranaAStudyAsokeChatterjeeSastri/Padma%20Purana%20A%20Study%20%20Asoke%20Chatterjee%20Sastri%20#page/n31/mode/2up/search/bhugola
The word bh?gola must have the same extended meaning of terrestrial geography in Bengali also.
Whether we can use this meaning of the word in passages from the Padmapur??a is another question.
Best wishes,
Toke
