[INDOLOGY] Further Clarifications regarding the WSC Forum
Dear All,
This is a formal retraction of Dr. Sathaye?s earlier note. It?s shameful. It apologizes to the offenders, not the maligned. It deflects attention from the real issues. It is part of the problem identified by Dr. Vajpeyi. If anyone needed further proof of how much hateful Hindutva sentiments and pressures are overtaking our discipline, look no further.
It seems to me that the World Sanskrit Conference is a lost cause at this point. The bigger issue, however, is seeing the moral and ethical compromises being made by Indologists in emails such as this. I?m horrified and, frankly, embarrassed to see such things.
For those interested in ongoing coverage of the event that sparked what?s become a show of horrors and how our discipline looks to the outside world - https://www.firstpost.com/life/world-sanskrit-conference-shows-that-sanskritic-scholarship-in-india-remains-afraid-of-gender-and-caste-4895051.html
