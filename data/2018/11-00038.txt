Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bhitari Pillar

Dear Csaba,

If you search in Google Maps for Bhitari Monuments and Historical Places, two of the eight photographs there, dated May and June 2018, show that the pillar was still ?in situ?.

Best wishes,

As far as I understand the Siddham database, this information must be based on Agarwala 1983, who is not necessarily a reliable source on such issues. (I don't have the work at hand.) Has no-one in Michael Willis' team undertaken fieldwork at Bhitari?
