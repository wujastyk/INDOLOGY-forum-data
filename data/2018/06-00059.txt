Continuing my Sanskrit verses on Krishna:

????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ?? ???? ????????? ?

????????? ???????? ??? ???? ??????? ???? ???????

O Kr???a, I beg for your dark hue, and I am willing to give everything I
have.  Take everything, but give me just this one thing.  O M?dhava, what
will you lose?


????????? ????????? ???? ?? ???? ??????? ?

?????????: ??? ????? ????????????? ???????????????

O Lord, just give me a speck of your dark hue.  By giving me just a speck
of it, your are not going to lose it all.


???????: ????????? ????????????????????? ?

???????? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ???????

That is Kr???a and this is Kr???a.  Kr???a arises from Kr???a.  Having
taken Kr???a from Kr???a, Kr???a alone remains behind.


??????? ??? ?? ????? ??????? ?? ????????? ?

??????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ??? ?????? ???? ???????

If I am a speck of yours, O Kr???a, and if I have a dark hue, why would
that diminish your dark hue?


??????? ??? ?? ????? ??????? ?? ???????? ?

?????? ? ? ?? ???? ??????? ?? ???????: ???????

If I am a speck of yours, then my dark hue is uncontested.  It is neither
to be given or taken.  O Kr???a, it is my very own nature.


????? ?? ?????????? ?? ??????? ???? ???? ?

????? ???? ????? ???? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ???????

O Kr???a, my whole world is immersed in your dark hue.  O M?dhava, how do I
know where you are and where I am.


?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ?

???????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????

Immersed in the dark hue, when I search, O Lord, thinking it is you I grab
my own hand.


?????? ?????????????????? ?????? ??????????? ?

???????? ????? ?? ????? ?????? ????????? ?????: ???????

Let this play in the playground of your dark hue go on for ever.  Whether
you catch me or I catch you, there is no reduction in the joy of the game.


????????? ????? ????? ??? ???? ??? ????? ?

?? ????????? ??????? ??? ???????? ?? ???? ???????

O Kr???a, during this play, whether I catch you or you catch me, what
difference does it make, as long your hand catches my hand.


?????? ?? ?????????? ??????? ?? ???? ?

??????????? ????????????????? ???????????: ???????

O M?dhava, my otherness is dissolved in your dark hue.  I am unable to see
if you are other than me or if I am other than you.


??????????? ?????????? ??? ??????????????? ?

??????????????? ?????????????? ????? ???????

For those immersed in the ocean of your dark hue, how could there be
anything else to see?  There are only the waves of your dark water around
me, and nothing else.


??????????????????? ??????? ? ????????: ?

?????????????????????? ?????? ? ????: ???????

Why would the waves of the ocean of your dark hue not have that dark hue?  You
are the ocean, and I am a wave, but undoubtedly both have the same dark hue.
