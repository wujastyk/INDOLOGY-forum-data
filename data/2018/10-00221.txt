Brilliant.
This is also what I predicted:
"the author of such allegory or caricature cannot himself explain it without, in some sense, destroying the piece of art he has created" !

Not again! We?ve gone over this ground already. Eli already raised these ?misunderstandings? of The Nay Science before. We comprehensively responded to him in ?Theses on Indology.? But if Jan wishes to have it all explained again, here we go. Jan raises the following objections:

1. That we did not define German by race or nation or language.
2. That we overlooked the commonality of German Indology with other countries.
3. That we made a subset of German Indology stand in for the whole.
4. That we critique Indology because we stand for tradition.
5. That we therefore stand outside a European tradition of critical inquiry.
6. And finally, that our work lacks the proper graces.

The definition of German Indology in terms of allegiance to intellectual concerns and a methodological and institutional paradigm is wholly consistent within itself, and misunderstandings such as those voiced in points 2 and 3 only arise because scholars insist on the categories of nation, language, and ethnicity. Finally, we can continue to repeat tropes of ?European = critical,? ?Indian = traditional.? By now it is amply clear whose work is critical and who is desperately trying to protect traditional authority and privilege. Who is caricaturing whom here?

In order not to belabor the discussion, I have appended a list of our writings where further clarifications to Jan?s comments can be found. If there are new objections, Vishwa and I will be happy to respond to them. But let?s not self-defeatingly keep proposing ethnic or national definitions of ?German? and stereotypes of ?the critical European? vs. ?the uncritical Indian.? It only confirms the point.

Dear Shyam Ranganathan,
This is a legitimate question, which merits an adequate response.
My "two cents":
You may already have looked at the bibliographical article ?German Indology? by Joydeep Bagchee (JB) (Oxford Bibliographies online: www.oxfordbibliographies.com<http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com> under ?German Indology? or:
www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0147.xml<http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0147.xml>)
Since, as I pointed out elsewhere, ?Indology was more or less since its beginnings, end 18th ? beginning 19th century, mainly ?European? in character with intensive cooperations between French, British and German specialists, and has thus not only been sharing Oriental dreams but also a Nazi-nightmare,? the focus on ?German Indology? in JB?s article is itself problematic, especially because the author justifies it by invoking ?a distinct history and traditions? for German Indology, and ?unique concerns that set it apart from other forms of research into India? (?German Indology?, section ?Introduction?). Given this and other peculiar premises, the article contains nevertheless useful bibliographic references and brief evaluations (from the author?s point of view) of relevant publications, especially ? for your subject ? in two sections of the article: ?National Socialism? (topic: German Indology and National Socialism) and ?German Responses to National Socialist Indology.? Another relevant section is ?Orientalism Debate? which, in the view of the author (JB), as he expresses it in his evaluation of Halbfass?s India and Europe (1988), really starts with the publication of ?Pollock 1993? (see above). It is hence regrettable but not entirely surprising that the collective volume Beyond Orientalism (1997) is regarded by JB as a work which ?does not directly address the orientalist debate; it is really an overview of Halbfass?s work as a post-orientalist scholar.? In this section a reference is lacking to my review of this work which discusses and demonstrates how the work and in particular Halbfass?s dialogical contributions to it are indeed directly relevant to the ?Orientalism Debate? (?Orientalism, its critique, and beyond: review article of Beyond Orientalism, ed. by K. Preisendanz and E. Franco, Amsterdam 1997? (15 [1998]: 16) IIAS-Newsletter : Newsletter of the International Institute for Asian Studies (Leiden), no. 15. 1998 : https://www.academia.edu/6169112). With regard to Halbfass?s unsurpassed India and Europe (1988), the author (JB) thinks that it ?needs revision in light of newer discoveries? but fails to point out that several currently self-styled ?new discoveries? need, in fact, also revision in the light of Halbfass?s monumental achievement in comparative philosophy which is exceptionally well-founded both in ?Western? and in Indian philosophy.
I have in the meantime also updated my almost antique "conference report" (of the 29th DOT of the DMG in Leipzig, 1995)
www.academia.edu/7378413<http://www.academia.edu/7378413>
with two "Further Postscripts", the second of which containing a brief compte rendu of VA&JB's The Nay Science in which I address two "key-problems" that remain in this work, a heavy ?stone in the pond? of Indology and Asian Studies, in spite of the large number of reviews and rejoinders that have already appeared, and propose two "keys" to solve them.
With best regards,
Jan Houben

Dear all,

Forgive me if this question has an obvious answer that I don't know.

I recall that in India and Europe, Halbfass discusses the development of ideas associated with National Socialism by those who took an interest in India. I'm wondering if there is anything classic on this topic. I'm trying to reference, in passing, the racist reception of India in Europe (the friendliness to "Arya" or "Swastika" for instance) where India was treated as a kind of European prehistory, and I'm not sure what to point to. I'm happy to point to Halbfass, though I was wondering if there was something specifically on this topic (a paper or book).

Thanks,

Shyam
