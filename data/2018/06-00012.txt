[INDOLOGY] Etymology of Mukunda
I remind everyone that Manfred Mayrhofer spent his entire life writing
etymological dictionaries of Sanskrit, the Etymologisches W?rterbuch des
Altindoarischen and the Kurzgefasstes etymologisches W?rterbuch des
Altindischen. Even if you don't read German (and the KEWA has English
glosses), you are always better off trying to make sense of his comments
than Whitney's (or almost anyone else's) guesses. For most of the words
mentioned in this thread, he has reliable and relatively up-to-date
comments. He refers to the two possible explanations for g?vinda-
(including references to Vedic g?v?d- and g?vind?-, ga?? ?vindan, Avestan
v?dat?.gu-, etc.) and adduces ????????? ?chickpea? and Kannada are-viri ?be
half open? in the case of aravinda-.
