[INDOLOGY] Suggestions for improving services of Asiatic Society, Kolkata
Very strange, indeed,
I visited the Asiatic Society in 2009 and received everything I ordered 
100%.
On the other hand, there are libraries outside of India which have this 
policy : the department of the British Library which was anciently the 
India Office Library prevented me, some years ago, to take a complete 
xeroxcopy of Garrett and Guleri's The Jaipur Observatory and its 
Builder. I was authorized to copy something between a third and a half 
(I don't exactly remember) so that I had to do it in two or three 
visits. Very convenient.
Best,
J.M.Delire
