Dear Indologists,

I am looking for a pdf of three articles:

Vol. 19, No. 1/2, INDIGENOUS VISION: PEOPLES OF INDIA ATTITUDES TO THE
ENVIRONMENT (SPRING-SUMMER 1992), pp. 145-155

**A DISCUSSION OF TWO METAPHORS IN THE "CHURNING OF THE OCEANS" FROM THE
"MAH?BH?RATA*
Rodney Parrott

Vol. 64, No. 1/4 (1983), pp. 17-33

*THE VEDIC METAPHOR IN THE "CHURNING OF OCEAN"
