[INDOLOGY] Kashmir Shaiva and 'vernacular' - a question
Dear Tatiana, and dear Harry,
Strange, somehow. Your exchange contains no information re the language of
the vernacular verses ending each chapter of the "Kaashmira (with short
'i'! - TO) Shaiva works". Should it remain a closely guarded secret?
Greetings from frosty Warszawa,
