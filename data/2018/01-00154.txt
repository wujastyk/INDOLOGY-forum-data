Dear Indologists,

I am looking for the article ?the Religion of the Brahmins? in 'Kerala Charitram?, pt. II,  by Marthanda Varma, Ernakulam, 1974. While the specific pages I need are 384-85, if I can get the whole article, that will be great. I am sorry I do not have better bibliographic details.

Thank you in advance.

Regards,
Palaniappan
