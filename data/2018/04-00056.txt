[INDOLOGY] BhG quote
Dear Patrick,
In 1937 the editor and scholar Jivaram Kalidas Shastri published an
augmented Bhagavadgita (worldcat permalink
<http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18183358>).  I've got a copy in a box
somewhere.  I went to Gondal in the early 90s (with Peter Schreiner), and
met Jivaram's son, Ghanashyamji, and we discussed his father's work and
legacy.  The 1937 Bhagavadgita publication was based on a birchbark
manuscript of the work that was - if I recall - given to Jivaram by someone
in Varanasi.  The MS still exists, and is today in the library of the
Gujarat Ayurvedic University in Jamnagar, together with all of Jivaram's
extensive MS collection.  I visited Jamnagar on the same trip, and examined
the Bhagavadgita MS that was behind the edition.  It was transparently a
forgery.  That is to say, it was a modern production, physically speaking,
and plainly so.  The birchbark pages were made of pieces cut very squarely
and glued together in a patchwork, and the handwriting was large and
student-like.  Since Jivaram was an experienced MS collector and editor, I
am surprised that he took the object seriously as a new and important
manuscript.
The publication claims to contain verses that appear in no other
transmitted version of the Gita, and therefore to be a better and more true
version of the sacred work.  I haven't checked, but it is possible that
your verse is in that version of the Gita.
Best,
Dominik
