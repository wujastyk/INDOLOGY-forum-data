Subject: [INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria

In Bhagavadgita, we have

???????? ?????? ?????? ???? ?????? ???????? ? ??-???

This usage of the word Soma indicates that at least by the time of
composition of Gita, Soma has been viewed as the Rasa that provides the
common quality to all the (medicinal) plants.

Even if this usage is viewed as the result of a semantic change from the
Vedic usage, there has to be a common semantic connection between the two
usages that lead to this semantic change.
