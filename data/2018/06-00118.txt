Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit grammatical terms

Dear Colleagues,
In the given context, Andrew is -- pace Matthew -- absolutely right: 
Every historical linguist not only in the 19th cent., but also nowadays 
(as myself in the field of Indo-Iranian studies) would classify the 
inherited skt. dev?- as a thematic noun and, e.g., its derivational 
basis in Proto-Indo-European, being continued in Vedic Skt. by 
dy?v-/div-? 'heaven', as an athematic one.
With best regards
Chlodwig H. Werba
