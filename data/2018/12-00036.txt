[INDOLOGY] Help with Indian Antiquary
Dear Colleagues,
I would like to find out what it behind a somewhat curious, perhaps in exact quotation referring to A. Weber in IA 1901, page 287 (English translation of an article published in Deutsche Rundschau 1899). In out library Indian Antiquary only begins from 1902 and the otherwise good scan in Archive.org is made of a defective piece where the fascicle containing the said page is missing. If anybody has access to the volume, I would appreciate a scan.
Best,
Klaus
