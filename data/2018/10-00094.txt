Dear all,

As mentioned some time ago, Daniela Bevilacqua and I are organising a 
workshop at SOAS for November 2019 entitled 'Yoga and the Traditional 
Physical Practices of India: Influence, Entanglement and Confrontation' 
(CFP attached). The deadline for proposals is October 31st.

At this stage, we are particularly interested in papers on textual 
sources for physical practices. And we are also wondering if anyone on 
the list could point us to scholars who have worked specifically on a) 
acrobats in India (we're only aware of Lee Siegel et al's film on 
acrobats in Delhi), and b) Persian/Islamic physical disciplines?

Thanks and best wishes,

Mark
