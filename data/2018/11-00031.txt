[INDOLOGY] Language use at the site of the Statue of Unity
Dear Palaniappan and all,
just to be sure, the Russian ?transliteration? is really hilarious. Unlike the Hindi one, it is not phonetic but simply renders individual letters and that in a very funny way too. ??? for ?y? at the end made me wonder first if it was Mongolian or smth.
best,
Andrey
