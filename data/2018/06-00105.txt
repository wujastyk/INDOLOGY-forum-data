Dear Tiru Palaniappan avarghal,

I think the situation you mention is just the opposite of reality. Most of
the modern , particularly Indological understanding of literary texts has
been well informed by history which is mostly based on epigraphy. In fact,
we have to identify epigraphists who have been Indologists who used
literary texts to inform and correct epigraphic data since their number is
not big.
