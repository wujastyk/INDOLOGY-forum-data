Dear all,

I remembered that Rao's edition of the work is available for download 
here: 
http://www.nyayamruta.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=3.

It also has further useful material on Vyasatirtha.

The site doesn't seem to come up on google searches.

Best wishes,

Michael Williams,
