[INDOLOGY] Tattvadipini Commentary MSS America 2085
Dear list members
I am looking forward some favor to search the Tattvadipini Manuscript which is written by Jagaddhara on the original work Vasavadatta.
NCC suggests America 2085 and I also happen to see it expansion in the initial pages. But I am not clear as to which institute to be contacted. Is that
American oriental Society Connectict ??
Could anyone kindly help.
PS
Tattvadipini editing is my thesis Subject
Thanks
Krishna Prasad
