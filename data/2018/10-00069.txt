[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Dear Joanna and list members,
I apologize for being slow to respond.  I have come down with the flu.  My
body aches all over and I am unable to move around easily.  It will
probably take me a few days to get pdfs to you all.
Thanks in advance for your patience.
George
