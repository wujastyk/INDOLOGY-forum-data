Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brackets in modern sanskrit translations
In-Reply-To: <VI1PR0202MB329487F0B93D70AC254BB0F5CA650@VI1PR0202MB3294.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

We are perhaps somehow in this discussion running the risk of not
clarifying sufficiently what we mean.
To write: The Buddha attained extinction (nirodha) before ... is one thing
To write: I picked up (my) pen to write a letter to (my) mother... that's
another.
And when we get [The] Buddha spoke [outloud] to [the previously mentioned]
?ji?vika [renuniciant] [saying] "Hey [you]! How's it hanging?" ...
something is clearly wrong, is it not?

Just adding (my) 10? (an American unit of money; see US Mint 2012,
passim)....

*Yes, it's been a long day. We didn't, by the way, even talk about notes,
really.... and whether we are happy with pages littered with numbers (hint:
I'm not a big fan of this in translations, and think it can be an admission
that the translation is not actually doing its communicative job)
