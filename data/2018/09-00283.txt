Dear Colleagues,

on behalf of the author, I have the pleasure of drawing your attention to a
review by J?rgen Hanneder of the so-called "Nay Science", passed off as a
history of German Indology by Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee.
A recommendable weekend leisure read, it can be downloaded from here at no
charge:

Enjoy!

Kindly regarding,
WS
