[INDOLOGY] Tributes to Dr Ram karan Sharma
My condolences to Dr. Sharma's family and friends, and I was lucky to count
myself among the latter.  Dr. Sharma was really a wonderful fellow who was
instrumental at key junctures of my career in guiding me in the right
direction.  We shared living quarters for some months in New York and spent
many pleasant hours together.  I will never forget him, his warm
heartedness, deep and generous spirit, and rich understanding of the
Sanskrit knowledge system.  May he rest in peace.
