[INDOLOGY] Scholars proficient in 19th-century Rajasthani dialects
Dear all,
I'm looking for someone proficient in 19th-century Rajasthani dialects 
to help identify the language in a verse on a gy?n caupa? chart from the 
Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum in Jaipur. I thought that I would 
start here as this diverse and learned group might have a few obvious 
suggestions up their sleeve.
Kind regards,
Jacob
