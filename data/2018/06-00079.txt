Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scholars proficient in 19th-century Rajasthani dialects
Message-ID: <96e9e181e993236684ee20af7377a68c@fabularasa.dk>

Dear all,

I'm looking for someone proficient in 19th-century Rajasthani dialects 
to help identify the language in a verse on a gy?n caupa? chart from the 
Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum in Jaipur. I thought that I would 
start here as this diverse and learned group might have a few obvious 
suggestions up their sleeve.

Kind regards,
Jacob
