=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pronunciation_of_j=C3=B1?=
Tim Lubin's account is generally fine.  The typical Marathi pronunciation
of j? is indeed dny today.  However, in the language of the countryside,
one also hears "gy?nab?" for J??ne?vara.  The dny pronunciation
occasionally results into ny for some speakers.
