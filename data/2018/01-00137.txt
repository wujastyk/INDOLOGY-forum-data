[INDOLOGY] "Caste passing"
Chandala?
Hinduism is not unusual and even a highly widespread tendency; so it is not
particularly pointed at your usage when I said there is no God in
'Hinduism'. Translating back, this word could be somethinglike an
Upanishadic paramaatman/bhagavaan/brmhan  or a puraanic Vishnu /Shiva.
Though I am not able to connect which story this could be, this is a great
story. Chandaala literally the one who is a dear devil professional
handling activities which others can't dear to even imagine taking up,
activities related to death, executing death sentences etc., As such,
Chandaala being viewed as, say, Shiva himself makes a lot of sense.
If the reference is to Maneeshaapanchakam incident of Shankara, then the
hagiography Shankaravijayam is depicting this as the disguise Shiva takes
to bring Shankara's own theory into his anubhooti.
Shiva passing for Chandaala is not person of one caste passing for one of
another caste. It is the case of a super-caste entity or an entity beyond
caste passing for a person of a caste treated badly by the hierarchically
oriented people of caste system.
If an entity beyond caste passing for a person of a certain caste is caste
passing, yes, this is a case of caste passing only.
