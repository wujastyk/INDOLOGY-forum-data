[INDOLOGY] Language use at the site of the Statue of Unity
On a plaque at the site of the statue of Sardar Patel, the name ?Statue of Unity? has been transliterated or translated into different languages as shown in the attachment. The terrible rendering in Tamil became widely ridiculed on the Web. Some wondered if it was a photoshopped joke. But BBC Tamil <https://www.bbc.com/tamil/india-46054914> has confirmed that it is true and shows a picture with attempted erasure of the Tamil version after the problem was brought to the attention of the authorities. The designer of the plaque was Larsen & Toubro. Can other language experts comment on the other versions on the plaque?
Thanks
