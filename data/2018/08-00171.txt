[INDOLOGY] Floods in Kerala
Dear members of the list,
The flood situation in Kerala is serious, I?m in contact with colleagues and friends there. All those trapped in remote houses are yet to be rescued. The magnitude of the calamity has not been assessed. At least rains have abated in the last 24 hours and things are slowly coming under control. Kerala is experiencing unprecedented pain.
