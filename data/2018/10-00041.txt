[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
?
Dear All,? The list of references provided by Jarod is excellent and nearly complete. I may add a little contribution of mine, that may escape notice: in "Further links between the Indo-Iranian substratum and the BMAC language", in B. Tikkanen & H. Hettrich, Themes and tasks in Old and Middle Indo-Aryan linguistics, Delhi, 2006, p. 167-196. I have devoted some argument (184-189) about the name RV aMSu-, which I consider as the genuine name of the plant, because soma- was actually the name of the juice. My etymology of aMSu- takes it as a colour name borrowed from a language of Central Asia, and referring? to the rusty red (brown) colour of the internal part of its stalk. All other colours attributed to th soma- in the RV are based on metaphors. This would support the identification as ephedra.?

This is a modest contribution to the debate. Best wishes, ? Georges-Jean Pinault?
