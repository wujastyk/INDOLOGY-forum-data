[INDOLOGY] ADMIN: If your message is not getting posted to INDOLOGY...
Dear colleagues,
The INDOLOGY committee is seeing a lot of "discarded messages" every week
at the moment.  When we look into these, it is most often the case that the
INDOLOGY member has posted the message from an email account that is
different from the one they used to subscribe initially.
If this has happened to you, you can fix it by updating your email address
at the Mailman menu page (first link on the INDOLOGY.info page).  You could
also apply to be registered with two email addresses if you really need
that.  Write to the INDOLOGY committee <indology-owner at list.indology.info>
if you need assistance.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee member.
