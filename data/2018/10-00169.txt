[INDOLOGY] Draupadii and polyandry
Dear Discussants,
In his letter (the first *re*) Jan E.M. Houben writes: "Then in the
Mahabharata there is suddenly the major character of Draupadii/Krsnaa
marrying all five Pandava brothers."
Suddenly. The unexpected appearance of the motif.
Unexpected ? and seen as such in the Mbh. (I, CLXLVIII);  the two
mythological precedents given there seem to be unknown to those who
participate in the exchange of opinions on the project.
The creation of the epic is in itself a political act. Why, then, shouldn't
we treat the acts of its heroes as mirroring the political ethos of the era?
The question arises ? why? Why would the epic makers want Draupadi to marry
'all five Pandava brothers'? To my mind ? a signal, directed to the
prospective audiences of the epic, confirming their *belonging to*.
You were kind enough to kill my supposition ? using the
philological/logical arsenal of counter-arguments.
The Mahabharatian stratigraphy. A difficult subject, in itself.
But ? to my mind (again) ? what is unexpected, devoid of precedents, might
be rightly treated as belonging to the epic's later stratum. As something
disturbing, a novelty, unsettling in its very unexpectedness. Demanding
explanations ? and given them, but ? unconvincing and weak. Opening the
space for the appearance of successive, ever new concepts of feminine
power. And freedom. Vide the popularity of the motif of the Draupadi's
*svayamvara* ? in its modern film-and-theatrical versions.

A bit more on *unexpectedness* ? no one called my way of thinking on the
nature of Indian cultural processes (with their search for the ways of
intercommunication) as *racist*. Not so far.
Regards ?
