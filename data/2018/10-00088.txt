[INDOLOGY] Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland - digitization project
Dear Colleagues,
During my recent stay in London I visited the library of Royal Asiatic
Society of Great Britain and Ireland where I learned from the librarian
that this year they started to digitize their manuscript collections. First
portion of the digitized manuscripts belongs to Whish Collection.
All digitized texts are in open access and you can find it by clicking on
