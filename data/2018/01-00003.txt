 I guess an obvious place would be the publisher's, Les Belles Lettres themselves:
https://www.lesbelleslettres.com/livre/2884-sanskrit-commentarial-tome-i
who may also suggest alternative ways, perhaps, if they have distributors elsewhere in the world. I have little doubt that they can deal with queries in English. You can also find a number of other books by Michel Angot in their catalogue.

With best regards,
