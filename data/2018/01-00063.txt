Subject: [INDOLOGY] in praise of water
Message-ID: <CA+H=kyS_SWFWY=S6VNO1cFVvqgJYL-45rJhEt5tcghc0Ti=oNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List Members

A friend has asked if I could help him collect Sanskrit verses in praise of
water.
He's not thinking so much of verses praising specific rivers, but water as
such.
Does anything come to mind?

Yours Alex
