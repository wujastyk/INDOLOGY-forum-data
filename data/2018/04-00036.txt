[INDOLOGY] BhG quote
Hello,
I'm curious about this quote as I am writing about the use of phrases
related to ,,journeys to self,,. In a google search for examples, I came
across this
"Yoga is the journey of the self , through the self, to the self ~ The
Bhagavad Gita"
Might anyone know which chapter and verse this translation is? I do not
recognise it.
Thanks, Patrick
