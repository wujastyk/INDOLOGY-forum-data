I mistakenly linked to the Motilal reprint of Farquhar.  The OUP edition is https://archive.org/details/FarquharAnOutlineOfTheReligiousLiteratureOfIndia

Re: [INDOLOGY] PDF requests -- Farquhar and BNK Sharma
Dear Tracy,
Both are available on archive.org (Sharma at https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfDvaitaSchoolSharmaBNKVol2 and Farquhar at https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.224306).
Generally speaking, archive.org is a wonderful resource, but you have to be a bit patient and creative with search terms since they are inconsistently catalogued/tagged (I find that minimal works better, such as author last name and a couple keywords from the title)
My best,
Steven
