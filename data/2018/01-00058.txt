Dear List,
I agree with colleagues who have welcomed this conference on footprints. I
wish that I could attend.  I have noticed, however, that there is no
reference among the conference papers to footprints in the Vedas.  If any
of you are interested in footprints in the Vedas, may I recommend to you
two papers that I wrote in 1995:
"The Pursuit of Hidden Tracks in Vedic", published in Indo-Iranian Journal,
vol. 38: pp. 1-30
