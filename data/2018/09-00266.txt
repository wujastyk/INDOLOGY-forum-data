Dear David,
     What you have reported is very worrisome.  After getting hold of the
editions of the ??val?yana and ???kh?yana Sa?hit?s, I was myself looking
for such details, but many of these details are not provided by the
editors.  So, one does not know to what extent, these editions faithfully
reflect the texts found in the source manuscripts and to what extend the
text found in the manuscripts has been "normalized" by the editors.  A
careful researcher may need to return to the source manuscripts to check
the facts.
