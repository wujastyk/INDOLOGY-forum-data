=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_camatk=C4=81ra?=
Having thanks to the quick availability of David Shulman's "Notes on
Camatk?ra"
been able to go through the article, I noticed that, although *en passant*
touching on
the meaning of this term in the philosophical system of Pratyabhij??, he
predominantly
concentrates on its originally (thanks to Abhinavagupta) not altogether
unrelated
employment in later *ala?k?ra* contexts. For the sake of scholars with a
considerable
interest in comparative philosophy, such as Matthew Kapstein (who requested
a pdf
of the article in the present context), it may be remarked that the most
important
reference provided in *T?ntrik?bhidh?nako?a* II: 231 under the lemma
*camatk**?ra* is
actually to note 23 of Prof. Torella's *The **??varapratyabhij*
*??k?rik? of Utpaladeva *
*with the** Author's V?tti* (1994: 118f.).
Unfortunately, Shulman does not display any awareness of Torella's
masterful work.
In the context of Utpaladeva's Pratyabhij?? philosophy *camatk**?ra*, as
Torella explains,
has a profound significance in connection with realizing/re-cognizing one's
Self,
one that "goes beyond that relative and momentary transcendence that one
has in
the aesthetic experience of poetry and the theatre" (*ibid*.). He provides
a number
of adumbrative terms, introducing these by saying "[t]he terms with which
it is
glossed or with which it is closely related may be grouped according to its
principal
components: cognition, bliss, wonder."
Given Matthew's primary field, let me add that *camatk**?ra* in the
Pratyabhij?? context
closely resembles that of *?o mtshar* as employed by Klo? chen pa and other
rDzogs chen philosopher in the Tibetan context.
Aware of the largely common geographical origin of modes of thinking that
subsequently was turned into parallel systematic philosophical
developments,
this may not be altogether surprising.
Naturally, this sphere has received hardly any independent attention
by Western philosophers. Yet, there actually is a rather astonishing focus
in one of Heidegger's works. In volume 45
*Grundfragen der Philosophie. Ausgew?hlte "Probleme" der "Logik" *
of Martin Heidegger, *Gesamtausgabe*, (II. Abteilung: Vorlesungen
1925-1944),
those interested in this ontologically attuned aesthetico-phenomenological
context
will find a long ? 38 with 15 subsections (pp. 165-181) titled:
"Das Wesen des Er-staunens als der in die Notwendigkeit des anf?nglichen
Denkens
n?tigenden Grundstimmung".
Best wishes,
