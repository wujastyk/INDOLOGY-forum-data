Following up on the notification from Royce that the ?vet?mbara Jain
canonical texts in the original Prakrit are available in searchable files,
the other need is the commentaries on them, whether searchable or not. Most
of these are in Sanskrit, even though they are on texts in Prakrit. For
several decades, the main editions of these available were those included
in the canonical text editions by ?nandas?gara/S?gar?nanda, published by
the ?gamodaya Samiti starting in 1915 and continuing into the 1930s. But
almost none of these ever reached North America.
M. B. Emeneau's 1935 *Union List of Printed Indic Texts and Translations in
American Libraries* lists a grand total of four of these texts (2 at
Cleveland Public Library, 1 at University of Chicago Library, and 1 at Yale
University Library). A WorldCat search just now turned up only a few more
at Yale. This was no doubt a big factor in the paucity of Jaina studies by
American Indologists. These texts did not even start being replaced by
critical editions until the Jaina-?gama-Series published by the Shr? Mah?v?ra
Jaina Vidy?laya of Bombay (which began in 1968) started including Sanskrit
commentaries in 1999, and only a few with commentaries have so far been
published.
So I was quite happy to see the announcement of the
*Sav?ttika-?gama-Sutt??i* in 2017, which consists of photographic reprints
of ?nandas?gara/S?gar?nanda's editions in 40 volumes, prepared and
supplemented by the indefatigable Muni D?paratnas?gara. I intended to post
a notice of them here; but after receiving my set (can be purchased through
Biblia Impex), I saw that they were printed from the digital files
available at the Jain eLibrary. They can be found there under this spelling
of the title, Savruttik Aagam Sootraani, or of the editor, Anandsagarsuri,
or under the serial number 035001 and following.
The need for editions of the ?vet?mbara canonical texts with commentaries
had been met by Muni D?paratnas?gara with his 2000 publication of *?gama
Sutt??i (sa??ka?)* in 30 volumes (now also available at the Jain eLibrary,
serial numbers 003305 to 003334). However, when I was cataloguing my set
several years ago, I was somewhat dismayed to see typographical errors even
in some of the titles on the title pages (the volumes were all newly
typeset). Many (all?) of the volumes of ?nandas?gara/S?gar?nanda's editions
were typeset at the famous Nirnaya Sagar Press, Bombay, known for their
careful work. So I tend to trust the 2017 reprints over the 2000 newly
typeset edition. It may be that the corrections made by Muni D?paratnas?gara
in the 2000 edition over previous editions are more than counterbalanced by
the newly introduced typographical errors.
