Continuing with my Krishna verses:

????? ????? ????? ????? ???????: ?

O Kr???a, sweet is your flute, and sweet is the sound of your flute.  On
the sweet bank of Yamun? stands the sweet Holder of Flute.


????? ????????? ????? ???????????? ?

?????: ?????????????????? ?????????: ???????

Sweet is the water of Yamun?, and sweet the courtyard of Gokula.  Sweet is
the Delight of Nanda along with his sweet friends.


????? ????? ???? ???????? ????: ???? ?

? ????????????? ??????? ?? ????  ???????

Sweet is mother Ya?od? and sweet is your father Nanda.  O M?dhava, your
sweetness is well known since your childhood.


???????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ?? ?????: ?

?????? ??? ??????? ??????? ???: ???: ???????

No sweet thief other than you is ever seen or heard of.  Even the robbed
beg you again and again ?Rob us.?


??????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????: ?

You stole the clothes of the bathing milkmaids, and yet, saying ?Don?t go,?
they beg you again and again.


?????? ?? ????? ????? ????? ???????? ?

??????? ????????? ???? ? ?????????? ???????

Your danced sweetly, O Kr???a, in the sweet water of Yamun?.  You removed
the poison of the snake K?liya and sweetened the water.


????????????????????? ?????? ????? ??? ?

???? ?? ??? ???????? ??? ?????? ??? ???????

Roaming with sweet milkmaids in the sweet woods, you appear to me like a
honey-bee collecting honey in spring.


?????????????? ???? ?????? ?? ????????? ?

?????? ????? ???? ????? ?? ?????????? ???????

Your play, sprinkling nectar, goes on in Gokula.  Soaked in your sweetness,
Gokula became so sweet.


???????? ??: ???? ????????? ???????????? ?

?????? ????? ???????????? ?????? ???? ???????

In Mathur?, you killed your evil-doer uncle Kamsa, and freed your parents
from the prison and made them happy.


?? ????????????? ???????? ???? ?? ??: ?

???? ???? ????? ????? ?? ?????? ???????

With the shower of your sweetness, please remove the poisons from my mind.  Go
on roaming, O Honey-Bee, in the sweet wild of my mind.


???????? ???? ?? ??????? ??? ?????? ?

If I were to see you always roaming in my mind, then my mind becomes
Gokula, and I need to go nowhere else.


????? ???? ????? ?????? ?????? ???? ?

?????? ?? ??????????? ??? ???????????? ???????

May I always stay where M?dhava always happily roams around.  What is the
point of coming and going.


????? ?? ????? ???: ???????????? ???????? ?

O Kr???a, your sweet words on the battlefield of Kuruk?etra completely
removed the darkness from Arjuna?s heart.

The words that you spoke to Arjuna to purify his mind were all reported by
Sa?jaya to purify the world.


????????????? ?????? ???? ???? ???: ???? ?

You, O Lord, the compassionate father of the world, by using Arjuna as an
occasion you taught to the whole world the path of righteousness.


????? ????? ? ???? ?????? ???? ??????? ?

????????????????????????: ???????? ??????? ???????

O Lord, even though you are the maker and the sustainer of the world, there
is no sweet speaking teacher other than you.
