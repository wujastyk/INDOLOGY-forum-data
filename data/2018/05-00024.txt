Continuing Krishna verses this evening:

?????????????? ???????????

????????? ?? ???? ?????? ???????: ???????

Let the inexorable wheel of the world continue to rotate in front of my
eyes, and let any loud tumults fall on my ears. As long as the sound of
your flute is in my heart and your figure resides there, I am happy.


?????????? ????? ???????? ??????????

?????? ??????? ???? ??????????????? ?

I did not recognize your figure residing in my heart.  The immaturity of my
mind was previously preventing this.


?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ????

????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????

But your compassionate hand touched my body and removed that immaturity.


?????? ?? ??????? ??? ??: ??????? ????? ?

??? ?? ????????? ???????????: ???????? ???????

When the moon of Kr???a shines in the sky of my heart, darkness is removed
from my mind by your dark luster.


??????? ?? ?????????: ??????? ?????? ???: ?

? ??? ????????? ?????? ?? ??????? ??????? ???????

The moon in the sky waxes and wanes.  But in the sky of my heart the moon
of Kr???a does not ever wane.


?????????????????? ???????????: ???????? ??? ?

???? ???? ??: ?????? ???????????????: ???????

The never-waning bright moon of Kr???a unrestingly destroys the darkness
hidden in the heart with compassion.


?????? ???? ??????? ?????????? ? ?????: ?

??? ?? ????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ???????

In the sky, when the moon comes up, the stars do not shine.  Similarly, in
the sky of heart, nothing else shines.


???? ????? ??????? ??????? ? ???? ??????? ?

???????????? ???? ?? ???????? ????????? ???????

The moon shines at night, but not during the day.  The moon of Kr???a
shines in my mind day and night.


?????? ????????????? ??????: ????????: ????: ?

???????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????

By the rising moon of Kr???a, all nights were turned into full-moon nights.
It does not leave my heart even during the day.


?????????????? ????? ????? ???? ??????: ?

????????? ?????? ??????: ??????????????????: ???????

On account of the cool brilliance of the moon of Kr???a, the blazing fires
in the mind, fueled by inherited karma, are pacified.


????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ?

?????? ???????????? ????? ????????? ???????

By the young moon of Kr???a, the Gokula was brightened.  By the grown moon
of Kr???a on the [battlefield of] Kuruk?etra the entire world was
brightened.


?????????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ?

?????????? ????????????????? ?? ????? ???????

The face of mother Ya?oda, brightened by the dark brilliance of the moon of
Kr???a, shines like the moon.


???????????????????? ???????????????? ?

???????? ????? ????????????? ????????? ???????

The heart of Arjuna, enveloped by the evil of ignorance and overcome by
grief and delusion, was brightened by the moon of Kr???a.


?????????????? ?????: ???????? ?????????? ?

???????????: ??????? ????????? ????????? ???????

The beams of the moon of Kr???a, namely the words of the Bhagavad-Gita,
constantly spread over the world cleansing it of evil.


?? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ?

???????????? ????? ????? ????????? ???? ???????

How can the darkness of ignorance enter the heart of those, who constantly
see the moon of Kr???a risen in the sky of their heart?


?? ????? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ?

????????? ???????????? ???? ? ??????? ???????

If the moon of Kr???a were not to shine in the three worlds, the sun and
the moon will not be able to remove darkness.


????? ???????????? ????? ????????? ?

?????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ??? ???????

O Friend, if you heart is overcome by darkness and the body is whitened,
that kind of life in this world is like a dried up leaf.


???????? ???????? ???????????? ??? ?? ?

??? ??????? ?????? ???? ????????? ???? ?????? ???????

When the moon of Kr???a shines in the sky of your heart, then unwaveringly
see M?dhava with your eyes closed.


???????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ???? ?

????? ????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????

In one sky of heart, you should see M?dhava with joy.  He too will see you
as a friend.  You are two friends on the same branch.


??? ????? ??????? ????: ??????: ?????? ?

??? ??????? ?? ????? ?????????? ???? ???????

Whenever I see children playing around me, O M?dhava, Delight of Gokula, I
remember your play.


??????? ??????????????? ????????????? ????: ?

?????????? ?????? ??? ??????????????? ???????

The mothers doting their children and discipling them remind me of Ya?od?,
the mother of the delight of the father Nanda.


????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ????? ?

???? ???? ?? ????? ??? ????: ??????: ???????

A father carrying his child on his shoulders and showing him to people
seems to me, O Kr???a, like Nanda, with his delightful son.


??????? ?????? ??? ?????????????? ?

??????? ????? ???? ?????? ????????? ???????

O Lord, the entire moving and unmoving world spread around me appears to me
like Gokula, O Delight of Nanda.


???????????????? ???: ?????? ????????: ?

?????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ???????

You subdued the poisonous K?liya snake, and you cleansed the water of
Yamun? for the life of the people.


?????? ???? ???? ?????? ??????? ?

????? ???????? ????? ???? ?????????????? ?????

There are many snakes hidden in the minds of people.  To purify their
minds, O Kr???a, destroy those snakes.
