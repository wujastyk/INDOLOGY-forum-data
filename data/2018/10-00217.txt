Can you share a pre-print version of your paper, Oliver? I?m interested in
the developmental hypotheses you propose for these findings. When you write
?not too far away from some outcomes of philological research? I presume
you mean von Simson (1968/1969) (cited in your 2017 paper). But even if
your results are close, it cannot vindicate von Simson?s work as
?philological research.? It only demonstrates the failure of
text-historical philology as it unfolded from Lassen to von Simson, since a
a different science and technology, i.e., computer science and information
technology, was required. The success of psychopharmacology does not
vindicate phrenology as a science. Results acquired through prejudice,
chance, or ideology are not scientific results, and the development of a
posterior science cannot confer scientificity on them. Finally, we cannot
referee past Mah?bh?rata scholarship without attention to its historical
context. Here I recommend looking at *The Nay Science*for von Simson?s
reliance on Holtzmann?s ?inversion hypothesis? and on Lassen?s thesis of a
war epic before its ?Brahmanic? corruption. I have uploaded the section
here: http://www.academia.edu/37681318. Also, to bring this discussion,
which Jan Houben began, full circle, see this link for Irawati Karve:
http://manufacturingrace.org/3-researchers. We simply cannot go forward
with philology unless we acknowledge the problems with previous scholarship.
