[INDOLOGY] 2 questions
Dear Colleague*s*,
I have two questions about a passage from the *N??ya??stra *cited in V.
Raghava?s book,* The Number of Rasas.* The passage comes at the ed of
Ragavan?s summary of the ?adbhuta synthesis? of N?r?ya?a, the grandfather
of Vi?van?tha.
First I give it in what seems a paraphrase: ?The story has to be, says
Bharata, like a cow?s tail, bushy at the end, full of surprises. There must
be adbhuta at the end.?
Raghavan 1940, 173 cites and quotes *N??ya??stra* 20.46-47, which I give
here in my transliteration:
kAryaM gopucchAgraM kartavyaM kAvyabandhamAsAdya
ye codAttA bhAvAH te sarve pRSThataH kAryAH
sarveSAM kAvyAnaM nAnArasabhAvayuktiyuktAnAm
nirvahaNe kartavyo nityaM hi raso ?dbhutastajjJaiH
My two questions are:
1.      I don?t see in the Sanskrit what would make the cow?s tail ?bushy??
2.      Can any of you tell me whether this is one of the *N??ya??stra*?s
well-known gems, and, whether it is or not, does gopuccha occur elsewhere
in connection with literary endings?
Very best,
