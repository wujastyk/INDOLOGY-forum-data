Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tattvadipini Commentary MSS America 2085

just a side note: I believe that Harvard is making efforts to digitize
their Skt MS holdings; they provided me recently with excellent photos, and
were good enough to move my MS up in the list of those waiting to be
photographed, so my assumption is that when scholars are interested in a
particular MS they can facilitate access.
