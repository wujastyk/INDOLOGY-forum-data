[INDOLOGY] [Spam:******] Re: Racism in Indology (Was: Sanskrit can tackle	climate	change)
It may be of some interest to the participants of the present discussion on racism, nazism etc. that the last few messages did not pass the Leiden University spam filter.

Dear Colleagues,
We must sympathize and feel with Dr. Bagchee on this "non-racist"
remark about "aging white men"! Also for the modest and clear
articulation of his unsurpassed and unchallengeable "knowledge of
German history, politics, society, religion, and philosophy that far
exceeds our Germanist colleagues much less any Indologist." I really
think there is nothing further to be said is there - on the part
especially of any of us who have also, alas for us,  studied "German
Indology" in Germany and must now shamefully bear that dreadful cross
for the rest of our lives!  I will leave it to Dr. Bagchee to have the
last word yet again as he usually does and must - after all I cannot
claim to even have a minuscule amount of his knowledge, his vast sense
of victimhood or his sheer expertise regarding the weighty matter at
hand.
with friendly greetings,
Srilata Raman
