[INDOLOGY] Nazis, India
Since Joydeep Bagchee mentions me as one of those who misunderstood  
his usage of the word "German", perhaps he should  have also mentioned  
what I said about this:
"Furthermore, the authors? arbitrary definition [of German Indology]  
is not innocent or candid. Suppose someone were to define Indian  
nationalists as persons who subscribe to a Fascist ideology, write a  
(partial and distortive) history of Indian fascism and present it as A  
History of Indian Nationalism. When a reviewer would object to this  
cheap manoeuvre, he/she would then protest: ?The reviewer has not read  
my book.  I have dealt with this problem and clearly admit that some  
Americans are also Indian nationalists and that there are Indian  
nationalists who are not Indian nationalists.? Precisely this is the  
tactics of the authors."
Best wishes,
Eli
