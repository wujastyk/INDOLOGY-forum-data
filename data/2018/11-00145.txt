[INDOLOGY] The online catalogue of MS collection of Anand Ashram Pune
Thanks, AJ. This is great news. I was impressed to see that they have over 1300+ jyoti?a mss alone. Though the catalogue is not available online except for a few categories, if I am not mistaken, they are charging at 8 INR (or 1 USD!) per folio.
When I was in India last January looking for jyoti?a manuscripts at the Asiatic Society, National Library (Calcutta) and various archives in Varanasi, the circumstances were often difficult and complicated. Though I did find most of the things I was looking for at the end thanks to all the helps I received, I came to the conclusion that one of the best archives of Sanskrit jyoti?a mss is in fact Pingree?s collection at the John Hay Library, Brown University!
