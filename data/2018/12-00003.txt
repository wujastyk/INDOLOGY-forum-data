[INDOLOGY] Kashmir Shaiva and 'vernacular' - a question
Dear Tatiana,
I referenced the KSTS edition of the tantrasAra because this is available
online in the Muktabodha digital library as both a digital e-text and a pdf
of the original.   I vaguely recall looking at a tantrasAra manuscript
about 20 years ago that had  prakrit verses  that were different from those
in the KSTS edition.  But that was 20 years ago so I could be mistaken.
