Dear Friends,

     I am thankful to Shri Janardan Hegde for suggesting a correction in
the line "?????? ?????????: ??????????????? ?????????: ??????".  The line
has now been revised to "?????? ????????? ?????? ???? ?????????? ??????".
Again I acknowledge my indebtedness to members of this group who have been
forthcoming in their appreciation and encouragement, and occasionally
correct me when needed.  I now have a concluding batch of verses which I
will post in a while.  With this concluding batch of verses, I now have
completed my ?????????????.  All this was originally inspired by reading
the beautiful poetry of Shri Shankar Rajaraman.
