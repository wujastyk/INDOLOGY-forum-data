[INDOLOGY] Nirnaya Sagar Fonts are at finishing stage of development
Dear Krishnaprasad,
  My only suggestion would be to test the fonts in a wide range of programs (such as Microsoft Word, Adobe Indesign, etc.) and operating systems (MacOS, Windows, Linux) to ensure that your new fonts are useable by the most people.
Regards,
Paul Hackett
