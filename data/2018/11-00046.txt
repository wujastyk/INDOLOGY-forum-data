[INDOLOGY] brick-making communities
Travelling in India, especially by train, one occasionally sees large
mounds of bricks, or maybe they are kilns or sun-drying piles.  There are
workers at these places, making bricks.  Is there a scholarly *historical*
literature about these communities and the practice of brick-making in
earlier Indian history?
