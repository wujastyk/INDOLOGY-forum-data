[INDOLOGY] Article request
Dear list members,
I would be extremely grateful if some of you could send me a pdf of the following article (apparently no Italian library holds this volume):
George Artola, "The Transvestite in Sanskrit Story and Drama," Annals of Oriental Research (Madras), 1975, Vol. 25 (Silver Jubilee Volume), pp. 56-68.
Thank you very much in advance,
with best greetings,
Marco
