[INDOLOGY] PIhrase in Lingastakam
Thank you Nataraj for this information.  All three versions can be found on
religious websites. M Aktor used as his reference a li?g?stakam inscribed
on a marble slab on the end wall of the Siddhe?vara Mah?deva Temple in the
Goyanka Sanskrit School in Varanasi.  Unfortunately he only lists the
sanskrit of the first two lines of each verse in his footnotes so its
impossible to tell which version is on this marble slab.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
