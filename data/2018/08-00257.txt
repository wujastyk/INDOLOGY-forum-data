Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sandhi and compound splitting model
Message-ID: <7c6322b7-ebbb-dde4-424e-5613839226ff@gmx.de>

Dear all,

Sebastian Nehrdich and I have developed a machine learning model that 
splits Sandhis and compounds in "raw" Sanskrit text.

You find further details, model, code and the data it was built with 
(~600.000 lines of Sanskrit text from the DCS) at
https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/papers/2018emnlp

The pdf in the github directory contains further technical information.

If you know researchers who work on this topic and may be interested in 
the model or the data, it would be great if you could forward this mail 
to them.

Oliver
