This article has nothing new for the New Year from the author. He has been
writing on the same lines for a long time in his news paper columns:

What is new is that these writings of him have all been compiled into a
book and there is a lot of publicising work going on for this book all
around in the form of these article.
No nationalist anywhere in the world likes to be reminded the highest fact
that all humans have migrated to different parts of the world from Africa.
This knowledge of ???? ??? ?????is to be spread to enlighten and elevate
all humans from their national or other identities are just Maya and
African origin all humans is the only reality.
