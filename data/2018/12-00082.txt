=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Fwd:_Here=E2=80=99s_that_passage?=
Dear All:
A colleague who is not on the list had a question regarding the meaning of ?tana?it?? in the commentary on the term ?stabdh?? of verse 11. The passage is from Sushruta-samhita, uttaratantra chapter 38, with Dalhana?s commentary. Thankful for any leads. With best wishes,
Patrick
