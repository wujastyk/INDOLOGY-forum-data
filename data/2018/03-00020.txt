[INDOLOGY] Arabic and Persian Astronomical Manuscripts in Jaipur
I'm sure you're right, Jean Michel, and it's a pity.  I was lucky enough to
have several humorous and talented math teachers when I was a schoolboy,
and that made me love the subject (though I'm terribly rusty nowadays).
Best,
Dominik
