[INDOLOGY] Nazis, India
Not again! We?ve gone over this ground already. Eli already raised these
?misunderstandings? of *The Nay Science *before. We comprehensively
responded to him in ?Theses on Indology.? But if Jan wishes to have it all
explained again, here we go. Jan raises the following objections:
1. That we did not define German by race or nation or language.
2. That we overlooked the commonality of German Indology with other
countries.
3. That we made a subset of German Indology stand in for the whole.
4. That we critique Indology because we stand for tradition.
5. That we therefore stand outside a European tradition of critical inquiry.
6. And finally, that our work lacks the proper graces.
The definition of German Indology in terms of allegiance to intellectual
concerns and a methodological and institutional paradigm is wholly
consistent within itself, and misunderstandings such as those voiced in
points 2 and 3 only arise because scholars insist on the categories of
nation, language, and ethnicity. Finally, we can continue to repeat tropes
of ?European = critical,? ?Indian = traditional.? By now it is amply clear
whose work is critical and who is desperately trying to protect traditional
authority and privilege. Who is caricaturing whom here?
In order not to belabor the discussion, I have appended a list of our
writings where further clarifications to Jan?s comments can be found. If
there are new objections, Vishwa and I will be happy to respond to them.
But let?s not self-defeatingly keep proposing ethnic or national
definitions of ?German? and stereotypes of ?the critical European? vs. ?the
uncritical Indian.? It only confirms the point.
