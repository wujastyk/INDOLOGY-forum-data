?vet?mbara Jain texts available in digital format (Unicode Devan?gar?)
I wish to draw attention to a set of 45 ?vet?mbara Jain canonical texts in the original Prakrit uploaded as Word documents in (mostly?) Unicode compliant Devan?gari that has been available for sometime from the Jain eLibrary (run by Jain Education International). 
The eLibrary new website can be found with a search under jainlibrary.org <http://jainlibrary.org/> or similar terms (registration and approval is necessary there for access or to download the files for personal use). Searching on that site is a bit complex, the quickest way to locate these particular 45  files (amongst the hundreds of scanned and uploaded books) is to search using the file identification numbers 003701-003789 (only odd numbers though from that range).
As indicated in the email below (shared with permission), in 1996 Muni D?paratnas?gara-j? released his editions of the 45 texts of the ?vet?mbara Jain canon in booklet form based mainly on the ?gama ma?j??? set (1940s) (also on the website and available on-line) (003901 to 003953), which in turn was based on ?nandas?gara/S?gar?nanda?s earlier editions. 
By 2012 Muni D?paratnas?gara-j? had produced and released those 45 versions as digital files in Unicode Devan?gari: PDF and Word files can now be downloaded file by file, which means a searchable set of canonical texts is available for the first time (admittedly without apparatus but it is a wonderful starting point and put together by a single individual working consistently over many years).
Recently Pravin Shah, sent me the email below, based directly on Muni-j??s responses to my question about the basis for his textual work and this background is important for scholars making use of these documents (which certainly need to be recognized as a major step forward for studies of Jain texts and Prakrits).

PS Any questions about accessing the texts can perhaps best be emailed to Pravin-bhai though he is travelling at the moment.
