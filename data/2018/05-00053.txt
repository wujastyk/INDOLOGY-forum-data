[INDOLOGY] Rajaparikatharatnamala of Nagarjuna.
Do you mean the ayurvedic/magical text, Yoga Ratnam?l?, attributed to N?g?rjuna?
If so, there is a hardcopy version, with the 140 Sanskrit verses (in devanagari) and an English translation, accompanied by a Sanskrit commentary by Jain MUni Shri Gunakara called Laghu Viv?tti.
Pushpendra Kumar, Nagarjuna?s Yogaratnamala, Delhi: Nag Publishers, 1980.
I don?t know of an e-version.
