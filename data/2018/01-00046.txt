Hi everyone,



With added apologies for cross-posting, applications are being accepted for
the Asian Division?s 2018 Florence Tan Moeson fellowship, which supports a
minimum of five business days of research in the Asian Reading Room at the
Library of Congress (in Washington, D.C.). Here?s the link:
http://www.loc.gov/rr/asian/ftm.html. *Deadline is February 28, 2018.*
Notifications of awards will go out by the end of April. After
notification, we?ll work with awardees on scheduling their trip to the
Asian Reading Room.



This is open to undergraduate and graduate students, faculty at all levels,
librarians, and independent scholars and researchers. Applications from
outside the United States are accepted, but please be advised that the
Library of Congress cannot assist in the procurement of any visa toward the
use of this fellowship. Please share this announcement far and wide with
your contacts.



More info on LC?s Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, South Asian,
Southeast Asian, and Tibetan collections is available on the Asian Reading
Room homepage: http://www.loc.gov/rr/asian/. The homepage also includes
several research guides, including one for the South Asian collection:

Warm regards,



Jonathan
