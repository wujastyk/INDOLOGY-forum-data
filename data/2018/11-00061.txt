[INDOLOGY] brick-making communities
Standardised  brick size and type particular to specific periods figure prominently as dating tools  in  South Asian excavation reports (too many to collate here). For example, tables based on brick size are provided in G. Verardi's (2007) Excavations at Gotihawa and Pipri, Kapilabastu District, Nepal, Rome, IsIAO.
Further, more general  discussion:
T.N. Mishra, 1997
Ancient Indian bricks and Brick Remains, New Delhi: Harman
E.S.N. Reddy, 1998. Evolution of building technology: Early and Medieval in Andhradesa, 2 vols. New Delhi. Bharatiya Kala Praashan.
M. Pareek, 2002. Early Indian Residential architecture.
I'll try to look out some other references on continuities / discontinuities between Harappan / early-historic brick technology. There is also ethno-archaeological work on brick making communities, again which I'll need to look out.

It's very tempting to look at today's brickmaking castes and make the leap
to Indus technology.  I've done it myself.  But then one must remind
oneself of the vast depth of time we're considering.  It seems impossible
that this craft could really be genetically connected with practices 4500
years ago.
That's why I'm asking about history, really, to see how far back the
current practices are documentable.
As for the Needham Project, O. P. Jaggi had a go at it.  Not that good, but
sometimes one is surprised.
