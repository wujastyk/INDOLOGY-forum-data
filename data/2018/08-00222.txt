[INDOLOGY] Further Clarifications regarding the WSC Forum
Dear All,
I have no complaints regarding the number of hours that Dr. Sathaye put into organizing the WSC. I have an objection to basically apologizing to those who disrupted conference proceedings by spewing misogyny, casteism, and other vile sentiments. I also object to watering down an earlier commitment to professionalism, scholarly discourse, and integrity.
I think there?s a pretty big problem with giving slack on bowing to hateful Hindutva pressures and behaviors. Unsurprisingly, this slack comes at the expense of the most disadvantaged within our discipline already, such as women and Dalits. When will we see more folks standing up for those that lack power, rather than those who have it and are ?exhausted? by exercising it?
I think we are better off naming - clearly and without equivocation - the poisonous trend of accommodation and compromise with hate that is sweeping up many in our discipline. It?s likely a losing battle, but I?ll fight my corner all the same. I invite others to join me.
