[INDOLOGY] Racism in Indology (Was: Sanskrit can tackle	climate	change)
Dear Colleagues,
We must sympathize and feel with Dr. Bagchee on this "non-racist"  
remark about "aging white men"! Also for the modest and clear  
articulation of his unsurpassed and unchallengeable "knowledge of  
German history, politics, society, religion, and philosophy that far  
exceeds our Germanist colleagues much less any Indologist." I really  
think there is nothing further to be said is there - on the part  
especially of any of us who have also, alas for us,  studied "German  
Indology" in Germany and must now shamefully bear that dreadful cross  
for the rest of our lives!  I will leave it to Dr. Bagchee to have the  
last word yet again as he usually does and must - after all I cannot  
claim to even have a minuscule amount of his knowledge, his vast sense  
of victimhood or his sheer expertise regarding the weighty matter at  
hand.
with friendly greetings,
