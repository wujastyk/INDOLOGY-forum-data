Concluding (?) verses of my Krishna poem:

???????????: ????? ????????? ??? ???? ???????
O Kr???a, we have been happily placed on the stage of your world. You, O
Kr???a, are blissful, and we are your particles on the earth.
???? ????? ??????????? ??? ? ?????????????? ?
??????? ?????? ????????? ???? ?? ?????? ???????
O Lord, it is all your planning as to where you have placed me, how you
have placed me, and the task in which you have engaged me.
???????? ? ?????? ? ???? ?? ?????? ?
???? ???????????????? ?????? ???? ????????????
I do not understand the purpose, nor your plan. All I know is that
propelled into this world I am an instrument of yours.
??? ?????? ?? ????? ????????? ?? ???? ?

O Kr???a, though the hands are mine, you are the doer, and though my feet
move, you are their mover.
??? ????? ??????? ???????????? ?? ?

Let my mind wander from object to object. I have no worry, O Lord, since
you are the driver of the chariot of my mind.

The wheels of the world turn just by a tiny portion of your compassion. So
if the chariot of my life moves ahead, what is so surprising?
???????????????????? ?????????? ?????? ?

Just by a glance of yours, O Lord, the lotus of my mind blooms. Let it
never close up.

The gate of my mind is open and for a long time I am waiting for you. Come
quickly. O Friend, do not delay.

O Lord, many of my lives have gone by and so also of yours. O Kr???a, life
after life, I was your friend.

O M?dhava, your friend is waiting for your in the yard. O Lord, as you did
before, do your play today.

O Kr???a, this is your stage, and I am M?dhava, your friend. Let our happy
and blissful game go on for ever.
