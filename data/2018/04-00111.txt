I think Prof. Slaje's

It is well known that ?secret intercourse with a woman who is asleep,
drunk, or mentally deranged? is categorized as a form of ?marriage? in
ancient Indian law books.

Manu (3.34) uses ?*upa-gam*? ? *inire feminam* (pw) / to approach a woman
sexually (MW) ? for the consummation of ?marriage?. *upa-gam* is a common
verb for ?having sex? in a general sense.


is a reference to pai??cha as a viv?ha.

Attention may be paid to the name of the  viv?ha . pi??cha --> pai??cha

Each of the  viv?has is described as found among a certain community.

Does anyone have info on which community is described as following  pai??cha
as a viv?ha?
