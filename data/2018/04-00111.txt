[INDOLOGY] Gender, Power, and Rape when Conducting Research
I think Prof. Slaje's
It is well known that ?secret intercourse with a woman who is asleep,
drunk, or mentally deranged? is categorized as a form of ?marriage? in
ancient Indian law books.
Manu (3.34) uses ?*upa-gam*? ? *inire feminam* (pw) / to approach a woman
sexually (MW) ? for the consummation of ?marriage?. *upa-gam* is a common
verb for ?having sex? in a general sense.
is a reference to pai??cha as a viv?ha.
Attention may be paid to the name of the  viv?ha . pi??cha --> pai??cha
Each of the  viv?has is described as found among a certain community.
Does anyone have info on which community is described as following  pai??cha
as a viv?ha?
