=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Pa=E1=B9=ADhan=C4=81rtha_and_v=C4=81can=C4=81rtha?=
Dear colleagues,
I have recently come across the expressions "pa?han?rtha" and 
"v?can?rtha" at the end of a few colophons in Jaina manuscripts and 
drawings/diagrams. I assume that the expressions indicate that the 
text/drawing in question was copied for purposes of study, and would be 
interested to know if they are conventionally used in colophons to 
indicate as much.
Kind regards,
Jacob
