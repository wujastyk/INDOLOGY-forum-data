[INDOLOGY] Lexical challenge for the OIT
Dear Paolo,
There's no need to join in the general insulting spree by ironically
accusing the INDOLOGY management committee of "changing policy."  Irony is
not a good tool in public email communications.
If anybody on this list wishes to know the policies of the forum, they are
on the website <http://indology.info> for all to read.  The heading to
click is "netiquette <http://indology.info/email/email-rfc-1855/>".  You
will find they have not changed.
The INDOLOGY forum is not moderated, and never has been.  The behaviour of
members is up to them.  But the management committee does sometimes
intervene privately or publicly when it seems that people are getting rude
and the language is not settling down by itself after a couple of exchanges.
When I read Dr Fournet's post, I winced at the opening paragraphs, which
were unacceptably rude in such a public forum.  I do understand the
background to his comments, but really, one can't talk like that in a
public, academic environment.  It does nobody any credit and does not
advance the quest for knowledge.
I also noticed the inutility of this rhetorical choice.  Dr Fournet's post
contained precise information and compelling argumentation, and challenged
Dr Elst in an interesting way to engage in a meaningful academic
discussion.  However, because of the rude opening remarks, Dr Elst was
justifiably able to spend many paragraphs in a rejoinder to the insults,
without giving the kind of scholarly and precise response to the specific
issues that Dr Fournet had raised, namely ancient loanwords appearing in
OIA.
