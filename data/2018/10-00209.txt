[INDOLOGY] Query about Poetics
Dear Colleagues,
I wondered if there is a preferred English-language term used currently to
replace ?poetician? when referring to writers on poetics / literary and
aesthetic theory / literary criticism / figures of speech in the Sanskrit
traditions of Alankara Sastra and Kavya Sastra. I find ?poetician? somewhat
dated and I?ve never really seen it used outside of Indological
scholarship.
Please advise.
Thank you,
Ananya Vajpeyi.
Sent on the fly, please excuse typos.
