Subject: [INDOLOGY] Query about Poetics
Message-ID: <CAHxuC0RwDGGhgD0zOhTFxO8MXTRmh393SC0yrDyDSOcVoNejzw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I wondered if there is a preferred English-language term used currently to
replace ?poetician? when referring to writers on poetics / literary and
aesthetic theory / literary criticism / figures of speech in the Sanskrit
traditions of Alankara Sastra and Kavya Sastra. I find ?poetician? somewhat
dated and I?ve never really seen it used outside of Indological
scholarship.

Please advise.

Thank you,

Ananya Vajpeyi.
