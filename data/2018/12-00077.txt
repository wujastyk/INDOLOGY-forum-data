The 17th-century astrologer Balabhadra in both his magna opera quotes 
(as p?rvapak?a) a stanza in ?ry? metre apparently supporting fatalism 
and attributed to ?aunaka:

yena tu yat pr?ptavya? tasya vidh?na? sure?asacivo ?pi |
ya? s?k??n niyatij?a? so ?pi na ?akyo ?nyath? kartum ||

'Whatever anyone is to meet with, not even the counsellor of the lord of 
gods, who has direct knowledge of destiny, is able to alter his fate.'

I should be grateful for any suggestions as to what work(s) attributed 
to ?aunaka might be referred to here (educated guesses welcome). It 
would be even better, of course, if someone happened actually to know 
the origin of the stanza.

Best wishes,
