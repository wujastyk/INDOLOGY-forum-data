Some information is below.
*??Call for Papers*
This conference seeks to foster an interdisciplinary exchange between
anthropologists, sociologists, historians, indologists, scholars of
religion, philosophers, philologists and linguists. And, also, yoga
practitioners and members of the general public interested in attending.
The intention is to facilitate a leisurely and collegial two-day
interdisciplinary conference, which is thematically anchored around the
broad theme of *yoga as movement*, particularly in relation to the imaginative
consumption
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p3JAECEsKasMly1PikdfM88fQeXdZ187>of
tourism and pilgrimage within the multi-trillion-dollar global wellness
industry
<https://www.globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/>
(which defines wellness as a*state of complete physical, mental, and social
well-being*).
Building upon a 'serious leisure perspective
<https://www.seriousleisure.net/concepts.html>*'* (SLP), participants are
free to discuss how movement can be understood as that which occurs *on and
off the yoga mat. *This includes the imaginative movement that occurs in
meditation, the physical movement to and within one?s local yoga studio, or
travel to exotic, distant lands. Aspects of which are inherent in the
creation and consumption yoga-inflected lifestyles.
We will also explore how the subjective, embodied experience of the yoga
practitioner is mediated through internal movements of aspiration,
expectation, and imagination. This includes textual-historical and
ethnographic analysis of how imaginative interiorisation is used to
traverse an internal sacred-scape, such as a*m?nasa-t?rtha* (mind-passage),
a process that is arguably as important as physical movement through time
and space.
This development and management of imaginary landscapes, where the imagined
*-scape* is interpolated onto a physical place, may hold more
epistemological and ontological importance than the physical location one
finds themselves in (See McCartney 2017
<https://www.utne.com/politics/imagining-sanskrit-land-zm0z17fzcmar>).
This notion of ?movement? allows for the exploration of how the pursuit of
self-improvement
<https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/improving-ourselves-to-death>
 and purification may consequently produce different types of environmental
and social 'pollution'; and how participation in the global yoga tribe
might potentially reify both, global and local, social and economic
networks and hierarchies. Thus, 'movement', also relates to cultural
conflict related to the social-political issues of manipulating cultural
narratives, cultural appropriation, 'white-washing', and the building of
cultural nationalisms. Therefore, there is space within the conference for
us to discuss the steps required to practically decolonise yoga

both from the colonial and post-colonial/neo-liberal masters.
