[INDOLOGY] Date of the Tolkappiyam
Dear List Members,
[Disclaimer: I?m not a social historian, nor an interpretive socio-anthro person, nor an etymologist. I?m just a morphologist/grammarian. ;-) I?m not an expert in ?dating? any ancient texts. In fact, I won?t worry if someone declares that the Tolkappiyam was written/verbally transmitted in the remotely unknown BCE times or in the late CE times. What matters to me is the content of the Tolkappiyam, which is quite sophisticated in my opinion.]
Anyway, I have some questions which occurred when I read through this discussion thread.
Questions:
1. Doesn?t the word k?vya refer to something related to literature? If that would be the case, how can the Tolkappiyam, which is a grammar, can be connected with that?
2. This question is for George. George, could you please explain the ?layer?ed aspect of the Tolkappiyam? Exactly which parts of the Tolkappiyam are layered and how? 
I?ve heard about this ?layer?ed business of the Tolkappiyam in the Tamil circles where some people are like parrots just repeating what the West has said. But, so far, to my knowledge, no one seems to have explained precisely what parts of the Tolkappiyam belong to which layer, and so on. 
3. This question is for everybody ascribing to the ?layer?ed nature of the Tolkappiyam. So ? if it took several centuries to compose the Tolkappiyam, how many authors were involved? Why only one author is known now and what happened to the rest?
I would appreciate precise answers to my questions.
Thanks and regards,
rajam
