[INDOLOGY] Racism in Indology (Was: Sanskrit can tackle climate change)
Dear friends,
The problem with Indology is perhaps greater than we think, when two young
Indian intellectuals are called names in this forum by aging white men.
Remember that a few days ago there were loud demands for apologies to women
who had apparently been criticized at the WSC. Since when has it become
acceptable to scream names like ?Hindutva racist?? If only hypocrisy could
speak!
Self-righteous posturing is no substitute for hard work and rigorous
research. By calling us ?Hindutva? you have only demonstrated that the term
is a weapon you use fecklessly to defend weak scholarship from criticism.
Not ONE of our arguments in any of our books rests on ad hominems. Do not
display your ignorance by repeating hearsay... it only demonstrates that
you do not read.
Because George Thompson raised the issue of racism in Indology, here is our
work on the subject:
https://www.academia.edu/37374680/Indology_The_Origins_of_Racism_in_the_Humanities
.
It is a review of Pascale Rabault-Feurhahn?s book *Archives of Origins*.
We do not make the charge of racism lightly: it is based on a knowledge of
German history, politics, society, religion, and philosophy that far
exceeds our Germanist colleagues much less any Indologist. When you attack
us for bringing these problems to light, you only prove their continuing
existence and the timeliness of our critique.
Shana Tova,

Philosophy is the supremely precious.
