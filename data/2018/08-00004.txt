The/Brahmay?mala/or/Picumata/is one of the earliest surviving 
goddess-oriented (/??kta/)/tantra/s, its core probably dating back to 
the late seventh or early eighth century. Though long forgotten, it is 
thus crucial to understanding the early history of the 
Tantrictraditions.Spanning more than twelve-thousand verses 
and104chapters, this monumental work is transmitted in a beautiful 
Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript of theeleventh century, which forms the 
principal basis for this criticaledition. Complementing volume II, 
edited by Csaba Kiss in the same series, thisvolumeincludes the 
firstpublishededition and annotated translation of five chaptersof 
the/Brahmay?mala/. The volume alsopresents pioneering studies 
ontopicsthesechapters illuminate: Tantric ?aiva conceptions ofrevelation 
and the canon, the history of Tantric coital ritual,the mythology of 
Bhairava,and the iconographyand symbolism of the skull-staff 
(/kha?v??ga/). As with other texts published in the Early Tantra Series, 
study of the/Brahmay?mala/helps reshape our knowledge of Tantric ?aivism 
and religion in early medieval India.
