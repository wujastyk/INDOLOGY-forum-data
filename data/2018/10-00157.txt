[INDOLOGY] Draupadii and polyandry
Oliver Hellwig has written some very interesting articles on applying
various statistical techniques to Sanskrit texts (including the
Mah?bh?rata) in order to determine "authorial structures" and hence
relative dating:

https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqn043
https://doi.org/10.1163/15728536-06002001
The last article presents a technique for distinguishing sections of a text
based on several features (lexical, syntactic, metrical, etc.) while
controlling for differences introduced by changing topics.
