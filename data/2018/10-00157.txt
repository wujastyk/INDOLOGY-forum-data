Oliver Hellwig has written some very interesting articles on applying
various statistical techniques to Sanskrit texts (including the
Mah?bh?rata) in order to determine "authorial structures" and hence
relative dating:

https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqp034
https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqn043
https://doi.org/10.1163/15728536-06002001

The last article presents a technique for distinguishing sections of a text
based on several features (lexical, syntactic, metrical, etc.) while
controlling for differences introduced by changing topics.
