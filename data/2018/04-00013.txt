[INDOLOGY] Help with source of quotation
Dear List,
I?m trying to track down the source of a quotation but not having much luck.
The quotation is ?nitya? vij??nam ?nanda? brahma?.
I?m inclined to read this as a variation of Brhadaranyaka Upanisad
(3.9.28): 'vij??nam ?nanda? brahma....'
But, I?m wondering if the inclusion of ?nityam? is found anywhere. The
texts in which I have encountered this quotation are all later than 1550 CE.
Many thanks,
Sam
