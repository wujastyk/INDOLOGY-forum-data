Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with source of quotation
Message-ID: <CAOYLp6LbQSsv4JZrnV9LbqJwaqbD5Af8ogSBZFL1eDc3JMo5vw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I?m trying to track down the source of a quotation but not having much luck.

The quotation is ?nitya? vij??nam ?nanda? brahma?.

I?m inclined to read this as a variation of Brhadaranyaka Upanisad
(3.9.28): 'vij??nam ?nanda? brahma....'

But, I?m wondering if the inclusion of ?nityam? is found anywhere. The
texts in which I have encountered this quotation are all later than 1550 CE.

Many thanks,
Sam
