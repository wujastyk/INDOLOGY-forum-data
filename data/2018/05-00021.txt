[INDOLOGY] Petition to complete the New Catalogus Catalogorum
A big thank you to those of you who have sent me your names for inclusion
in the petition.  To anyone else wanting to be included, just send me an
email at wujastyk+ncc at gmail.com (sorry! last time, I accidentally tagged
that as a website instead of an email address).
