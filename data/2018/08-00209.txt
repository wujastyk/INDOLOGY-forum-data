O Krishna, many of my lives have come and gone, and in every life I have
been waiting for you.

When will I hear your words, and when will I see you? When will my mind be
satisfied and when will there be peace for my heart?

I am always calling upon you. Where are you, O Lord? Your hiding from view
always hurts my heart.

Enough of this teasing, O Krishna. Offer a vision to your friend. I want to
hear your words. O Lord, satisfy my ears.
