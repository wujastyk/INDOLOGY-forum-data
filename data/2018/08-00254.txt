Subject: [INDOLOGY] Verba Indoarica by Chlodwig Werba
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQFQdRvSE1OJhZzrYp_bk1d5e-rsgL-WoT-6XVemi5Rupg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I ordered a copy of Verba Indoarica through a book dealer over the
internet.  I received Part 1 Radices Primariae .

Is there a part 2 or is that yet to be published?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
