occurrence of "Charon's obol" in Indian sources? From the point of view of
archaeology,
?are there ?
any graves
?known with any degree of certainty to be ?
from historical times in the Greater Gandh?ra area? Any coins ever found in
graves? Buddhist sources do list burial as
?one possible?
method of disposal of the dead, but otherwise it would seem to have been
rare.
    Any feedback on this topic would be greatly appreciated!
