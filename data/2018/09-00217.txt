[INDOLOGY] India in Greece by Edward Pococke (19th century)
Regarding the first paragraph of Dr Elst's post, there's an elegant and
profound book on this subject by Thomas Trautmann, Aryans and British India
<https://www.worldcat.org/title/aryans-and-british-india/oclc/652492240&referer=brief_results>(1997).
There's more to this topic than is suggested by Dr Elst's brief post,
including the general early nineteenth-century belief in Mosaic time, and
the sea-change in thought that followed the discoveries of Lyell on geology
and Darwin on evolution that placed human history forever in a new
chronological framework, dispelling older quests for an Edenic age in 4000
BC.
