Subject: [INDOLOGY] Telegu (Telugu) script
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4Jbp+LYxaeO=sRPX2sUN-71gUC73kbVw5CS6dwmiK53cw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues
I wonder whether a kind soul would be able and willing to help me. I have a
text I am editing, most of the MSS of which are in n?gar? (or something
like it), one in Tilagari, and one in Telegu. The Tilagari MS has been
deciphered (not by me) but the Telegu... well, let's just say that my
optimism that with a script table I could make something of it (since I
already know what the text says!) was hyper-over-optimistic. Therefore, I
wonder if anyone familiar with the script already would be willing to
contact me off list; I could send you both the text (edited) and the
photos, which are extremely high quality, and... well, if it works out that
would be wonderful. It's very short, 27 ?ry? verses (probably + ma?gala and
a colophon).

Very best thanks in advance, jonathan
