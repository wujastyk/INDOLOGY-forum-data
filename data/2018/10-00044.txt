[INDOLOGY] Balarama behind a rock
Dear Simon,
The detail is more likely to have come from the oral tradition(s) of k?rtanak?ras or hari-kath?k?ras than from any written source. These performers are known to answer queries from the audience occasionally in a light-hearted way. The Hindu audience is ordinarily quite comfortable with the liberties they take in the middle of a serious, uplifting discourse. 
In the detail to which you refer ? Balar?ma watching intimacies without himself being seen ? may also  indicate a  liberal attitude toward voyeurism. 
It is also possible that the k?rtana or hari-kath? performer did not wish to come across as a deficient knower of the tradition. In other words, if the traditional sources did not raise a question that an inquisitive member of the audience thought of, he had the presence of mind to improvise an answer ? that he was not one who did not know answers to all questions.
A few statements about Balar?ma in a similar vein can be found on pp. 275-277, 319 (last 5 lines) of Lee Siegel's _Laughing Matters_ Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1987.
