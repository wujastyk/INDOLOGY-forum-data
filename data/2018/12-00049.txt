In some sources, I have seen a reference to a work of Jagann?thapa??ita
titled ?abdakaustubha-???ottejana.  This is evidently a critique of
Bha??oji D?k?ita's ?abdakaustubha.  I don't have access to the volume of
NCC that may contain information regarding this text.  If anyone has any
information regarding this text or its manuscripts, please let me know.
With best regards,
