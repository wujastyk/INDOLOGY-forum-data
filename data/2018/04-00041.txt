[INDOLOGY] BhG quote
Dear Patrick,
I have enjoyed and referred my students to the "Fake Buddha Quotes"
website: https://fakebuddhaquotes.com/
Perhaps it's time for one of us to launch "Fake Bhagavad Gita Quotes" (or
"Fake Veda Quotes"? The possibilities are endless, as *avidy? *is seemingly
endless).
