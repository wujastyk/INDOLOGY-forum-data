[INDOLOGY] logical fallacies
Thank you, Brendan.
I found Pandeya's book on archive
<https://archive.org/details/MajorHetvabhasasAFormalAnalysisDr.RaghavendraPandeya>
.
Hamblin's book is on a server but I don't think we are allowed to share
such things here.
I am having more trouble finding an electronic copy of this book Philipp
Maas kindly suggested by G. Oberhammer et al., *Terminologie der fr?hen
philosophsichen Scholastik in Indien*. Vol 3. Vienna 2006.
All the best,
