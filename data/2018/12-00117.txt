I thank to James Madaio who promptly sent me a recently published article discussing this problem (doi:10.1093/jhs/hiy014).
The author convincingly argues that the ?vet??vataropani?adbh??ya "might have been composed tentatively between the twelfth century...  and the fourteenth century".

Already  the editors of this text (AAS 17) list several reasons why this work cannot be written by ?a?kara and almost all scholars accept this view. So it seems there is a scholarly consensus that this is a late text, but I did not find any discussion on the date of this work.
