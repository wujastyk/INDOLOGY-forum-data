[INDOLOGY] "Vedic Science"
I gave a talk for the Hinduja Foundation that was subsequently published as
"Science and Vedic Studies" in JIP in 1998.  PDF
<https://www.academia.edu/492300/Science_and_Vedic_Studies>.  And although
not aimed at Indian materials, I made a preliminary exploration of issues
of trust in a lecture -> paper a few years ago.  I consider networks of
trust to be at the heart of the issue of scientific truth, following
Michael Polanyi.
Wujastyk, D. Baatz, U. & Biffl, G. (Eds.) "Whom Do We Trust? Authority,
Authenticity and the History of Science" in *Die Krise und das Gute Leben*,
N? Forschungs- und Bildungsges. m?.H und Donau-Universit?t Krems (Hg.),
2015, 37-46.
also at the academia.edu site, I believe.
There are other critical writings on this topic, including especially works
by Mira Nanda <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meera_Nanda>.  Her 2016
essays *Science
in Saffron: Skeptical Essays on History of Science* is good but hard to
get.  Her best-known work is *Prophets Facing Backwards*.
