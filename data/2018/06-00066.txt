Like a father and a loving mother you protect the world, O Krishna.  Like a
kinsman and a friend you are the best among those who please the people.

Without you, how can even the blade of grass move?  Only with your will,
the wheel of this world constantly rotates.

The wheel of the world has twelve spokes, and its hub is in your finger.  The
seasons and the months move along when you move them.

The night and the day, the moments, hours and watches move along by your

There is not even a speck, O M?dhava, where you are not.  You reside in
every pot, every tree and every mountain.

In the form of an individual soul, you yourself reside in every body.  Without

O Krishna, you are the heart, the mind and the intellect, and you are the
blood flowing in all my veins.

Holding your finger, I walk along the path of the world.  O Krishna, please
do not go elsewhere.  Where can I go without you?

I beg for your friendship, O Krishna, and not for your servitude.  You have
many servants, but I am only your friend.
