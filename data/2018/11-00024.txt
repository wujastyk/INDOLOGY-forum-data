[INDOLOGY] Language use at the site of the Statue of Unity
It is curious that the Spanish, French and Chinese offer translations of the title, while the Russian, both arabic-persian script attempts (with slight differences), and the devanagari offer transcriptions of the English title ? privileging the English, which is also graphically lifted above the rest, as if the other languages were incapable of expressing the idea ?statue of unity.? How British.
