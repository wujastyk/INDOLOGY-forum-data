Continuing my Krishna Verses:

O Krishna, your play on the banks of Yamun? is so delightful.  On the other
hand, our play on the stage of this world is sometimes unhappy.


????????????????????????????? ?????: ?

??????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??:??? ??????????

You are the Lord untouched by afflictions, actions and fruition. [Yogas?tra
1.24].  Then, why is it that for us, who are specks of yours, there is a
painful touch of all these, O Lord?


? ????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ?

??????? ???????????? ??? ?????? ???? ???????

O Lord, I do not suspect that you are uneven or cruel.  You give us the
fruit in proportion of our Karma, O Lord.


????? ?? ?????????? ???? ?? ??????????? ?

????????? ???????? ??? ??? ????? ??: ???????

Still I do have a doubt as to why I have this bondage of Karma.  Is it
appropriate to say that my bondage of Karma is without beginning?


??????????? ??????? ??????????????? ??????: ?

???????????????????? ???? ?? ??????????? ???????

O Lord, you are without beginning, and you are untouched by Karma.  If I am
a speck of yours and equally without beginning, why do I have the bondage
of Karma?


??????????? ??????????????????????? ? ?????? ?

?????? ? ?? ??????? ??????? ?????: ???: ???????

If the bondage of Karma is without beginning, then there is no cause for
its existence.  I have not committed a crime, and yet why am I locked up in
a prison?


????? ????????? ???? ?????? ??????? ?

????????????? ??????? ??????? ???? ?? ??? ???????

O Lord, if there is an answer, please tell me.  O Lord, do not cause
delusion in my mind with mixed up words.


?????????? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ???????: ?

??????????????????? ???? ? ?? ???? ???????

Even after hearing your words [in the Bhagavad Gita], I still have
confusion in mind.  O M?dhava, this is my own fault, a dullard, and not
yours.


????????? ? ?? ?????????????? ???????? ?

??? ????? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ???????

Dancing on the banks of Yamun?, you have no bondage of Karma.  O Krishna,
how will you understand our pains of Karma?


?????????? ?????? ???????: ?????? ?????????? ?

????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ?? ???? ???????

While resting on the cosmic ocean, Lakshmi presses your feet and the cosmic
snake Shesha holds a shade for you.  Why would you have a worry?


??????? ?????????? ???? ?????? ??????? ?

??????? ???????????????????? ???????

O Krishna, if you wake up for a moment, please look at our difficult
circumstances that have no cause.


????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ?: ????????? ?

???????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ???? ???????? ???????

With you being awake, how can we have the pain of Karma?  O Lord, is it
justified?  You decide for yourself.


??? ?: ?????????????? ?? ???????? ???? ?

?????? ?????: ????????? ???????? ???? ????? ???????

If we do have a bondage of Karma, O Lord, please remove it.  If we do not
have a bondage of Karma, then happily go to sleep on the ocean.
