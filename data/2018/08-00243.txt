[INDOLOGY] Further Clarifications regarding the WSC Forum
Dear colleagues,
I would like to endorse John Nemec's comments in appreciation of Adheesh 
Sathaye's efforts on behalf of the recent WSC conference and its 
aftermath. He, along with Mandakranta Bose and many others, did an 
excellent job, and it seems to me that we should be thanking rather than 
criticizing him/them. As organizer he was inevitably caught in the 
crossfire, but has managed the matter in as tactful and diplomatic a 
manner as possible.
It is all too easy to criticize a person who lands in such a situation, 
but it is usually best to resist the temptation.
