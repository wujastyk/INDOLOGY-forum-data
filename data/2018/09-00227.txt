If we speak of v?can? PWB has s.v. v?cana 2) f. ?: "Lektion, Kapitel" 
=Hemacandra's Pari?i??aparvan 9.67sq:
One part of the Jaina canon (the D???iv?da) was lost. The sangha came 
together in Pataliputra and sent monks to Bhadrab?hu in Nepal asking him 
to come to Pataliputra and teach the D???iv?da. Bhadrab?hu was engaged 
in a religious vow and refused to join the meeting of monks. He offered 
to teach daily seven lessons to monks there in Nepal:? ... /sapta 
d?sy?mi v?can??/ (9.67d).
One lesson after returning from th begging tour (/tatraika v?can?? d?sye 
bhik??cary?ta ?gata?/ (9.68ab).
etc
In the Buddhist Cullavagga? (GRETIL text) we read the colophon to a 
certain chapter of the Cullavagga:
.../mah?vih?rav?s?na? v?can?/? "[this is] the chapter (/v?can?/) from 
the residents of the Mahavihara...".
