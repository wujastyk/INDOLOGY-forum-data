[INDOLOGY] Indologist featured in Amnesty International's campaign: Make Online Spaces Safe for Women
Dear Colleagues,
I am writing to share a recent venture of mine, which is not scholarly per
se but certainly has strong implications for my scholarly activities -
Amnesty International's campaign 'Make Online Spaces Safe for Women' (pdf
attached; also link <https://issuu.com/aiindia/docs/mas_book_02_final>).
The campaign is specifically focused on India. As part of the project,
Amnesty International did interviews with nine women who have faced
particularly vitriolic attacks on social media, and I am one of the nine.
I think this is relevant to Indology as a discipline as many of us face
increasingly vehement attacks online. As we saw recently at the World
Sanskrit Conference in Vancouver, inappropriate attacks - gendered and
otherwise - can also happen in person. Sometimes threatened violence
becomes real. Scholars, activists, and students have been the targets of
violent assaults recently in India.
I hope that some find this interesting and worth a few minutes of your time.
