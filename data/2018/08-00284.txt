[INDOLOGY] Sandhi and compound splitting model
Dear Jan,
thanks for pointing out Geldner, his thoughts are always interesting. 
However, I don't see that his comment (and even his redirection to 
7.16.6) is in basic disagreement with the annotation.
Just to make sure: My analysis of the line says: "There's an atomic 
*lexeme* dhAtama in acc. sg. masc., and this lexeme has a word semantic 
annotation of 'giving' in this occurrence." No derivational statement 
implied, and the root dA- is not mentioned at all. How would you 
annotate dhAtama on the meaning level at this place, by the way?
Herzliche Gr??e aus Berlin, Oliver
