[INDOLOGY] sha and kha
I have not looked at Michael?s material, but this phenomenon is widespread even in classical Sanskrit and Prakrits. Perhaps it had to do with regional pronunciations. The word that comes to mind is ?p??a??a? with no obvious Indo-European etymology (see the forthcoming paper by Joel Brereton in my edited volume on the G?hastha).
It has several variants: earliest in A?oka is p?sa??a (with variants in different locations), and in Sanskrit generally p??a??a, and often also p?kha??a. In Jain Prakrit also the form p?sattha. I find both p?kha??a and p??a??a forms in manuscripts in various scripts.

There is frequent reference to the same phenomenon in some of Michael Witzel's "Materials on Vedic ??kh?s", his series of articles published in various journals in the 1970s-1990s.

Re: [INDOLOGY] {???????????????????} sha and kha
Dear Colleagues,
I am very interested in this equivalence, because what I remember having learned (I am not sure now whether this is the right word) that kha/?a "confusion" was a characteristic of Nepalese manuscripts, and that they were to be considered the same (I perhaps learned this from John Brough's lengthy review of Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary, if memory serves...). But now it appears that this is not a "quirk" of Nepalese scribes but an instance of a wider phonologically motivated fusion?
Curious, Jonathan Silk

Dear colleagues
Sorry for the mistake due to haste.Both snushaa and snokhaa have the meaning
daughter-in-law and not grand daughter.

{???????????????????} sha and kha
Dear colleaguesThere is a sutra in Shukla yajuh praatishaakhya i.e." shah khah tumrite" It means retroflex sha is pronounced as kha except combined with the group t(tavarga).Hence in Shuklayajurveda it is pronouncedas kha. But in kashta,vishnu,etc. It is pronounced as sha.Almost all over India it is pronounced as kha in Shuklayajusha. I would like to mention that in our Mithila(North Bihar) retroflex sha is not only pronounced in Shuklayajusha but in ClassicalSanskrit too pronounced as kha and also inMaithili Language( a modern Indo-Aryan).It would not be out of the context what I would say.It has been coming from the Indo-European period.There is a Russian parallel "snokhaa" which resembles Sanskrit "snushaa" but both have the same meaning i.e.grand daughter.RegardsGirish K.JhaRetd.
