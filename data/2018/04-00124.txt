Dr Deshpande,

                            While  going thru a book on Gita interpretation in Bengali, I came across the name of Madhusudan Saraswati with a long " I ".In Bengali , Sara's water is always spelt with a long " i", either while referring to the Goddess, or Religious order or the mythical river.However, I am not aware  of any other regional variants.

            

                                       Alakendu  Das.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on Sarasvati as a masculine title
Dear Colleagues,
>? ? ?This morning I came across this book, where the author&#39;s name is given as ?????????????????????, where the word &quot;sarasvati&quot; occurs with a short &quot;i&quot;.? This &quot;sarasvat?&quot;, as well as &quot;Bh?rat?&quot; is added in the title of many Sannyasins.? Sometimes I see the titles with a long &quot;?&quot;, and here is an instance of a short &quot;i&quot;.? I am wondering as to what is the common practice and the grammar of that practice, especially since normally feminine expressions are being used in male titles.? Any suggestions?
