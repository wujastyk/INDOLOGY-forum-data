[INDOLOGY] Question on Sarasvati as a masculine title
Dr Deshpande,
                            While  going thru a book on Gita interpretation in Bengali, I came across the name of Madhusudan Saraswati with a long " I ".In Bengali , Sara's water is always spelt with a long " i", either while referring to the Goddess, or Religious order or the mythical river.However, I am not aware  of any other regional variants.
                                       Alakendu  Das.
