Subject: [INDOLOGY] Atharvaveda edition/translation
Message-ID: <4bd3321c-052e-036d-4ea4-585707a21a14@gmail.com>

I received the following question about the Atharvaveda from a 
non-Indologist colleague:

> I know that?Ralph T.H. Griffith translated the text in 1895, but could 
> you recommend a more recent translation? Also, is there a printed 
> critical edition (ideally in Romanized Sanskrit) that you could recommend?

As this is outside my sphere of expertise, I would much appreciate any 
leads.

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
