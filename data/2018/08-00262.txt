[INDOLOGY] Sandhi and compound splitting model
Dear Oliver,
Congratulations and thanks for sharing again a very useful research tool.
Also for the tool you shared earlier (see below),
which, incidentally, contains a mistake in the very first line:
1#1#1#2#2ratnadh?tamam#2#dh?tamam#dh?tama###219609#4443604#1#ADJ#3#1#1#_##giving~130047~2
The mistake -- and you are not the only one to make it -- is that the
adjectival word part -dh?tama- (you have chosen to neglect tama, probably
consciously) is not derived from d? (cp. Gk. didoomi "I give, confer") but
from dh? (cp. Gk. tith?mi "I establish").
Herzliche Gr??e,
Jan

with morphological, lexical and verb-argument information.
Data are stored in a publicly accessible repository at
https://git.adwmainz.net/open/rigveda
Details of the annotation process are described in the LREC paper, which is
stored at the upper level of the repository.
