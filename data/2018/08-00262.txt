Dear Oliver,
Congratulations and thanks for sharing again a very useful research tool.
Also for the tool you shared earlier (see below),
which, incidentally, contains a mistake in the very first line:
1#1#1#2#2ratnadh?tamam#2#dh?tamam#dh?tama###219609#4443604#1#ADJ#3#1#1#_##giving~130047~2
The mistake -- and you are not the only one to make it -- is that the
adjectival word part -dh?tama- (you have chosen to neglect tama, probably
consciously) is not derived from d? (cp. Gk. didoomi "I give, confer") but
from dh? (cp. Gk. tith?mi "I establish").
Herzliche Gr??e,
Jan

I would like to announce the release of a full annotation of the Rigveda
with morphological, lexical and verb-argument information.

Data are stored in a publicly accessible repository at
https://git.adwmainz.net/open/rigveda

Details of the annotation process are described in the LREC paper, which is
stored at the upper level of the repository.
