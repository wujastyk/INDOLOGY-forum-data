Dear colleaguesSorry for the mistake due to haste.Both snushaa and snokhaa have the meaningdaughter-in-law and not grand daughter.Girish K.JhaSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.-------- Original message --------From: jhakgirish <jhakgirish at gmail.com> Date: 9/12/18 10:16 AM?

But in kashta,vishnu,etc. It is pronounced as sha.Almost all over India it is pronounced as kha in Shuklayajusha.?I would like to mention that in our Mithila(North Bihar) retroflex sha is not only pronounced in Shuklayajusha but in ClassicalSanskrit too pronounced as kha and also inMaithili Language( a modern Indo-Aryan).It would not be out of the context what I would say.It has been coming from the Indo-European period.There is a Russian parallel "snokhaa" which resembles Sanskrit "snushaa" but both have the same meaning i.e.grand daughter.RegardsGirish K.JhaRetd.
