[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Dear Jarrod,
Thanks for this extensive series of references.  I would like to add one
more:  "A Brief Anthology of hymns in the Rgveda Having to do With Soma
(and Shamanism)" written  by me and published by me in "On Meaning and
Mantras: Essays in Honor of Frits Staal", edited by me and Richard Payne,
published by the Institute of Buddhist Studies and BDK America, Inc. 2016.
By the way, there are lots of great articles in this volume.
Best wishes to all.
George Thompson
