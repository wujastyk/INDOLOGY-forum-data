Dear colleagues,
GRETIL does not seem to have any e-text for the Chanda???stra.
Does anyone have an e-text of s?tras with/without commentary that can be shared?
I also have the impression that the files for N?g?rjuna's Ratn?val? on GRETIL are not based on Hahn's edition and don't cover the 5th chapter. Does anyone have an e-text of the complete Ratn?val? based on Hahn's edition?
Thank you.
Arlo Griffiths
