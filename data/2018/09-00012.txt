[INDOLOGY] Request for commentaries on YS
Dear Dhaval Patel,
Another example of the need to consult improved editions of Yogas?tra
commentaries is the Yogasiddh?ntacandrika commentary by N?r?ya?at?rtha.
This was published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series as work 35 in
1910-1911, which long remained the only available edition, and is currently
the edition that is available online. But this edition is incomplete,
lacking the commentary on chapter 4 from the end of verse 3 to the end of
the chapter, i.e., verses 4-34. It also lacks the commentary on most of
verse 23 of chapter 1, all of verses 24 and 25, and the beginning of verse
26. It abruptly resumes with the commentary on verse 26 in mid-paragraph of
the commentary on verse 23, without indication (p. 22, line 11).
Fortunately, in 2000 a critical edition by Vimala Karnatak was published in
the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series as work 108. It is complete.
