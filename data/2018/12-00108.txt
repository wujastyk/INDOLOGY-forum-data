Dear Krishnaprasad Ji,

     Your fonts are looking more and more beautiful.  You have to make
choices as you go along.  Consistency should be one principle.  The
traditional writing is with a pen-tip with a 45 degree angle.  That angle
needs to show up in all characters.  So the end of ? showing up a rounded
end does not fit within this consistency.  With a 45 degree angle of the
tip, one cannot draw a rounded end.  The same thing with signs like ? ? ? ?
where the 45 degree angle should show up, and not rounded tops.  I am
giving these suggestions following some of the principles I followed in
designing my own Madhushree font.  Since my font is not unicode compliant,
I no longer use it.  I can no longer type using that font either.  For some
reason, my Mac does not allow it.  Here is a sample from my
Sa?skr?tasubodhin?:

I also prefer the top line without gaps.  With best wishes for your project.
