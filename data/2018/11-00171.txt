[INDOLOGY] invite to participate in "Churning of Indology" international conference 4th to 6th January 2019 Udupi
Dear Dr Formigatti,
to avoid a possible misunderstanding, sentences in my earlier mail quoted
from another source were put in quotation marks. The remaining words and
sentences were my own, admittedly somewhat ironic remarks, which I could
not help making from the background of the intellectual level of all this.
Irony  also holds for the sad Italian rebirth of Leonardo. Truly sorry!
Best regards,
WS
