[INDOLOGY] Questions about Octavio Paz's Indian sources
Dear List Members, 
I would like to thank you for your invaluable help in my investigations on Octavio Paz?s Monkey Grammarian. Thanks to your precise and documented informations, I could identify the very probable translation from which Paz rewrote his text. Actually, even if he indeed stayed in Paris between 1959 and 1961, that is to say a very short time after the publication of Hymnes sp?culatifs (1956), it seems that he decided to use Renou?s first translation (1938) : Octavio Paz keeps ? salta ? whereas Renou abandoned this term in the 2nd translation.
I already knew that in several places he condensed elements taken from different parts of Sanskrit sources, such as the Ramayana or the Shatapatabrahma, but he always gave a reference. In this case, he left it hidden. Besides the symbolic interpretations, it shows that the structure of the Vedic ritual was used as a metatextual metaphor.
I am deeply grateful for your help and I am pleased that this list exists and is ready to help people who work in other fields. 
Kind regards,
Caroline Dubois
