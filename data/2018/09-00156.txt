[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
That is not the full sentence. The full sentence is this:
"
Prof. Antonia Ruppel -ji was very clear in saying that texts in Sanskrit
can help human kind to tackle climate change. In that sense, Sanskrit can
tackle climate change.
"
This was a paraphrasing of Dr Ruppel's
" So, understood in this very specific way, yes, Sanskrit can help us
tackle climate change. "
The statement " I did not make a statement " Sky is blue" "
does not imply that  I made a statement " Sky is not blue"
