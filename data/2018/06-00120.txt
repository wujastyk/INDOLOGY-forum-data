[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit grammatical terms
Thanks, Victor, for your note of caution.  It is not always possible to
render P??inian terms into modern Latinate terms.  Terms like "active" and
"middle" fall in the same catetory.  They don't match Parasmaipada and
?tmanepada, or kartari and karma?i in P??ini.
