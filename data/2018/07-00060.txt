Of those thousands of wives, there are children from house to house, and, O
Krishna, they lovingly call you ?Daddy!?.
?????????? ??????????: ????????????????: ?

Some children are crying, others busy running around, and some, climbing
upon your head like monkeys, are overjoyed.

Someone pulls your hair, another one holds on to your hands, another clings
to your feet, while someone closes your eyes.

There is a massive chaos in your home of all these children of yours. Yet,
with a calm mind, you lovingly care for them all.
