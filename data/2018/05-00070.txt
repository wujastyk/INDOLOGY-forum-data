I would like to thank those of you who wrote in support of the letter to Dr
Duraisamy, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Madras, requesting him
to help complete the *New Catalogus Catalogorum*.

I sent the letter today, with seventy-three signatures in addition to my
own.

Again, thank you all very much indeed!

Dominik
