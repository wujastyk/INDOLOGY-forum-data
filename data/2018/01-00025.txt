[INDOLOGY] Unpaywall
Today I discovered Unpaywall <http://unpaywall.org/welcome>.  It gives
fast, free, legal access to many research articles that are behind a
paywall.  A clever and, again, legal idea that truly helps us with our
research.  FAQ <http://unpaywall.org/faq>

?If you arrive at a journal website and can't read the article without
paying, Unpaywall will search for a copy of that same article that is on a
legal university research repository or the author's home page,
PubMedCentral, etc.  In about half the cases, a free copy of the article
can be found.
