[INDOLOGY] Mahabharata story/episode index
Dear Adriano et al, 
For up?khy?nas and other secondary narratives embedded in the MBH, the best source I know is the doctoral dissertation of Barbara Gombach (Columbia, 2000) titled ?Ancillary Stories in the Sanskrit Mah?bh?rata? and I see that it has been made available on archive.org: https://archive.org/details/AncillaryStoriesInTheSanskritMahabharataBarbaraGombach
For a cursory list of what he calls ?subtales? in the two epics, see Alf Hiltebeitel?s ?Not without Subtales: Telling Laws and Truths in the Sanskrit Epics,? JIPhil 33 (2005): 455-511, and available through springer here:

With best wishes,
Adheesh
