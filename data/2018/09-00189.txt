[INDOLOGY] Garuda's resolution
Great thanks, Christophe.
I have found Tripathi's edition of the Suparnadhyaya:
https://archive.org/stream/SuparnaAdhyayaCommentaryJayaSwamyEd.GayaCharanTripathiDramaOfVedicAge/Suparna%20Adhyaya%20Commentary%20Jaya%20Swamy%20Ed.%20Gaya%20Charan%20Tripathi%20%28Drama%20of%20Vedic%20Age%29#page/n0
What catches my interest is that Astikaparvan's Indra while warning Garuda
against offering the Soma [to the serpents] says that they would then expel
[prab?dheyur] the giver. In the Suparnadhyaya  - if the serpents (sarp??)
are given [even on] drop [of Soma] they would make him [Garuda]
people-less [ajanam]. 'Expulsion' made into 'genocide'? If so - what could
be the reason for this change? For such reinforcement in the meaning of the
key phrase?
Thanks again,
Artur Karp
