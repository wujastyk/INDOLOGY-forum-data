It?s not just in the p?yiram (???????), but in I?amp?ra?ar?s commentary also we find the word Tolk?ppiya? as the name of the author and Tolk?ppiyam as the name of the book. 

Reference: Tolkappiyam, collatik?ram, v???umai mayankiyal 33

For the benefit of all those who can read Tamil:

? ??????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ?



>> Since the p?yiram is supposed to be produced at the beginning of a text?s existence, it is unlikely, the author would be named after the grammar at that stage. Then the question has to be changed to whether he could have been named after some exemplary k?vya he had authored before producing his grammar. That seems unlikely also since the author is only praised for his knowledge of Aintiram, a possible grammatical text and not a k?vya. It is high time we give up relating the name ?Tolk?ppiyam' to k?vya.
