Dear Paolo,


Please see the introduction to my translation of the Prabodhacandrodaya, available here:

https://www.academia.edu/27671250/Introduction_to_The_Rise_of_Wisdom_Moon_Prabodhacandrodaya_


It certainly does not include everything about the Candellas, but it does have some additional references for you. I am sorry that I do not have pdf-s, however -- I was using old-fashioned xerox copies that are now in a storage box and not easy for me to access. If your project on the Candellas will continue for some months, I will be happy to see if I can locate what I have and then send it to you in the autumn, I do not believe that I will be returning to Candella studies myself. A lot of the useful work on the Candellas, by the way, is in Hindi.


best of luck,

Matthew

Dear all,

I am looking for a pdf of

Su??la Kum?ra Sullere. 2004. Chandella Art.
Dikshit, R.K. 1976. The Candellas of Jej?kabhukti

I also would appreciate any suggestion for publications that studied ritual and religious life during the Chandela's kingdom (X-XIII c.).

Best,
Paolo
