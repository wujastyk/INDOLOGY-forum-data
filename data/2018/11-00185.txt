[INDOLOGY] Segmentation of Ayurvedic works
Hi,
Does anyone know about segmentations of Charaka Samhita or other Ayurvedic
works, from medical point of view?
For instance, I would be interested to know about how many types of
premonitory signs and symptoms are for diseases, and which ones are common
to which diseases...
The same for causes, etc.
This only can be known if the works are segmented properly.
Thanks,
