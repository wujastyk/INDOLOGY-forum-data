[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Shrikant Jamdagni-ji posted on another list:
Dear Scholars,
I am reproducing some passages from Collected Works of Acharya T.V.Kapali
Sastry Vol.1 Book Of Lights.Page 62. Acharya Kapali Sastry was a
collaborator of Sri Aurobindo in their work of reconstructing the esoteric
or inner meaning of the RgVeda.
"........ Here we may note in passing that the Soma plant is an extinct
species and it was not easily available even thirty centuries ago.
Twenty-four varieties of Soma plant are mentioned along with the places of
their growth and their therapeutic virtues such as strength and longevity
in the Sushruta Samhita (Chikitsa-sthana, Chapter 29), but the intoxicating
property is not mentioned"
"...And some Riks cannot be properly construed at all if the Soma is taken
to mean the drug. What are we to say when the Veda plainly hymns "O Thou,
all-seeing, the illuminating rays of thee, who art the lord, encompass all
the abodes;Soma, with thy natural powers thou pervadest (the all) and
flowest, thou art the king and ord of the whole world" ? (RgVeda 9.86.5).
Another Rik openly decides the question of Soma. "When they crush the herb,
one thinks that he has drunk the Soma; but no one ever tastes him whom the
Brahmans know to be the Soma" (RgVeda 10.85.3)

Soma: What it is and what it does
Monier Williams (in his great Sanskrit English Dictionary)  interprets SOMA
only at physical level  as a -juice, extract,(esp.)the juice of Soma plant,
(also) the Soma plant itself,(said to be a climbing plant) the stalks, an
????  anshu of which  is pressed between stones by the priests, then
sprinkled with water , and purified in a strainer to get Soma.  Anshu
???? however
is translated by MW  as  a filament(especially of Soma plant);thread; end
of a thread, a minute particle; a point, end;..
....... There is an obvious incongruity in this interpretation of Soma. It
will be physically a difficult / impractical task to press the thread, end
of thread, a minute particle, a point of Soma plant. The entire concept of
an  already minute particle, to be pressed between stones, sprinkled with
water and purified in a strainer is more in the realm of an imagined
process and not physically feasible .
In fact Dr Nene beautifully describes the human anotomical process by which
human brain processes all information as if crushing on stones and then
sifts the findings for concusive decision to arrive at final wisdom. That
is Soma. Dr Nene actually describes the physical features in human anatomy
that work like two stones to press by and then a seive of wool like
structure throgh which the pressed substance is actually strained in
processing of information by human brain.
 Thus  in popular perception SOMA is  a kind of  herbal preparation, which
is consumed for exhilarating/ stimulating  benefits.  But  Soma is a lot
more than a mere stimulating herbal  concoction. The entire 9th  chapter
Mandal on Pavmani Soma of Rig Veda appears to have escaped notice of MW in
giving this highly limiting interpretation of Soma. Pavmani Soma signifies a
  non physical  entity  that provides the stimulant for physical action for
welfare and benefit of entire creation.

Solar radiations, the greatness of earth and all the planets in the sky
that support life, derive their abilities from the SOMA that is established
in them.

 Yask translates this mantra by saying-" Some chemists crush soma and then
drink it , and think that they have drunk soma. This is not correct,
because that is not true soma."
But The Soma that Learned, Scientists, Intellectuals, know of is not an
edible product.

It is covered and protected by well regulated non material  laws  governing
in the material world .
Soma can not be physically consumed by a living being*.*
