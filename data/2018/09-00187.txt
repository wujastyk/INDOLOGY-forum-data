 Dear Emmanuel,
For the Persian/Arabic expression, is not to say for certain without seeing the Persian seal.??
It is not certainly a single word but it seems a compound expression. If is meant to be a translation of dharma it could be "r?h il? All?h" i.e. the "way to Allah". This does not seem to me a conventional expression, especially the combination of the Persian r?h with the Arabic?il? All?h,?but it could be an acceptable translation for dharma.
All the best,
Fabrizio

 Dear Colleagues,

I am presently studying a set of spurious Chola copper plates (in Tamil and Telugu) in the Chennai Government Museum from available descriptions and translations (no illustrations, unfortunately).
Sources mention that the plates bear a Persian seal.
In the catalogue of copper-plates of the Museum Srinivasa Ayyangar (1918, p. 15) writes:

?This and the subjoined eleven grants are more or less similar in character. Two of them are exactly alike, while the rest differ in minor details. These bear a seal at the top of the plates, in which is inscribed, in Persian, ?R?h?lilla? which means dharma or charity and another seal at the end of the inscription, in which is inscribed, in Telugu, ?yekk?l App?j??.?

Could anybody kindly enlighten me on ?R?h?lilla?? Is it Persian? Arabic? Both? What does it mean precisely? Are other examples known?

A subsidiary question concerns ?yekk?l App?j??? What does it mean? Note that Burgess & Na???a ??str? (1886, pp. 137ff.), who edited and translated some of these plates, record variant readings of ?Yekk?l App?j?? on some of the plates: 
?Yek?l App?j??, ?Ekk?lu App?j??. 
There is also a Telugu seal reading ?Yajva App?j??.
