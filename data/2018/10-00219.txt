[INDOLOGY] Nazis, India
Dear Joydeep,
You are doing it again!
Which only confirms the aptness of my analysis at www.academia.edu/7378413
(last version with minor corrections 30-10-2018, pp. 9-12).
Point 1 of your representation of my argument is *almost* correct with one
crucial distinction: this was never my objection but an observation.
Gradually, the points of your representation swim away from my brief
analysis.
Until at points 5 and 6 it is diametrically opposed to the conclusions
reached in my analysis (as it is very clear in my review
that I consider* Love in a Dead Language* (by Lee Siegel) and "Ypsilon" (by
Hermann Weller) to be significant masterpieces).
From* almost *correct to diametrically opposed in just five to six steps.
Brilliant.
This is also what I predicted:
"the author of such allegory or caricature cannot himself explain it
without, in some sense, destroying the piece of art he has created" !
Best regards,
Jan
