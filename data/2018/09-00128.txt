[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit can tackle climate change
In isolation, the sentence
'Sanskrit can tackle climate change'
is like the sentence
'Doctors named Brian can prescribe antibiotics'
The latter makes it sound as though it was something about specifically
doctors of this name that could do this, rather than just doctors in
general. The former makes it sound as though this was a property
specifically of Sanskrit, whereas it is a property of all literary cultures
- and I pointed out that by 'Sanskrit', we can only mean 'Sanskrit
literature and the ideas contained therein' rather than the Sanskrit
language.
In Indian English, I often hear 'Sanskrit' used to mean exactly 'Sanskrit
literature and the ideas contained therein'. It would be more helpful to
reserve a term like Sanskriti for this even in English, and use Sanskrit
(< saMskRt*a*-), for just the language. Otherwise it sounds as though we,
either mistakenly or intentionally, assign properties to the Sanskrit
language that it, as beautiful as it is, does not have.
All the best,
