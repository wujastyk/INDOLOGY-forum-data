[INDOLOGY] Epigraphy and Indology
Dear Scholars,
While many epigraphists have been Indologists who used literary texts to inform and correct epigraphic data, I would appreciate references to scholarly works in the other direction, i.e., the use of epigraphical data to inform and correct interpretations of literary texts.
Thanks in advance
Regards,
Palaniappan
