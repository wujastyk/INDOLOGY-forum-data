Dear colleagues,

It is with great pleasure that I am sharing news of my new book, Yasodhara. This book has taken the shape of a novel - unlike previous publications - although it is based on many years of research. It is Yasodhara's story, in her voice, as best as I could imagine it.

The book is published by the wonderful team at Speaking Tiger in Delhi and is available in North America via amazon. Here is a link:

https://www.amazon.com/Yasodhara-Novel-about-Buddhas-Wife/dp/9387693716/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534343832&sr=8-1&keywords=yasodhara&dpID=51S5d309BYL&preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch

My apologies for the cross-posting.
With warm wishes,
