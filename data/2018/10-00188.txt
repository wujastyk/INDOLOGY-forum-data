[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Mbh stratification
Re: [INDOLOGY] Mbh stratification
I, quite to the contrary, am not convinced.
While determining the sequence of the epic's strata, I would instead search
for the mentions (direct or indirect) for the datable indicators of
material development. Such as networks of roads, novel technical and
architectural solutions (among them the Buddhist and the Jaina forms), use
of metals (especially iron), the introduction of new, non-native plant and
animal species.
Datable - because known well to archaeology.
I would also search for the mentions of uncharacteristic relations linking
people belonging to different communities/social strata. Such as 'mixed'
marriages and the appearance of the new type of heroes (as Astika) willing
to serve as mediators between the 'human' and the 'demonic' peoples. Which,
indeed, would place them in the later strata of the text.
