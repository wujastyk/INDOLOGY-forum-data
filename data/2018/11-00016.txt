Dear Palaniappan,

The Chinese translates as ?statue of unity.?

????? tuanjie de diaoxiang = ?Statue of Unity?

Broken down:
?? tuanjie = to unite, unity, solidarity, united.
? de = possessive marker
?? diaoxiang = statue

The terrible rendering in Tamil became widely ridiculed on the Web. Some wondered if it was a photoshopped joke. But BBC Tamil <https://www.bbc.com/tamil/india-46054914> has confirmed that it is true and shows a picture with attempted erasure of the Tamil version after the problem was brought to the attention of the authorities. The designer of the plaque was Larsen & Toubro. Can other language experts comment on the other versions on the plaque?
