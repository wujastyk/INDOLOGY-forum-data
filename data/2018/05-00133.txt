=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Renou=E2=80=99s_article_needed?=
Friends,
Would anybody be willing to share a copy of Renou?s (with Silburn) seminal study ?Sur la notion de brahman?, Journal Asiatique 237 (1949)? The old collection has seemingly been digitised only until 1940, nor do local libraries have a hard copy of the volume.
Thank you,
Paolo Magnone
