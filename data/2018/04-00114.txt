[INDOLOGY] Etymology of mukura / makura
Dear Toke,
It seems possible that Sanskrit makura- 'mirror' is a Dravidian loanword,
derived from the root *maku*l*- 'to turn round, be turned upside down,
return, turn back' (DEDR 4617), cf. Tulu magu?u, maga?u, mag?u 'next,
following; again, once more'; magu?-uttaro 'reply', and magu?udani 'echo';
maguru mu??uni 'to crop up again, to oppose, counteract; Telugu magu?a,
magi?i 'again, anew, back, in return'.  Of course one would like to get a
better confirmation than Tamil makuram 'mirror', which can come from
Sanskrit.
