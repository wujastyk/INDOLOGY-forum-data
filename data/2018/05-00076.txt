[INDOLOGY] Date of the Tolkappiyam
Dear Rajam,
As you know, I am not an expert on the Tolk?ppiyam. With that proviso, let me respond to your post. 
1. Regarding the derivation of Tolk?ppiyam, I had the same problem you did. To translate ?Tolk?ppiyam? as ?Old K?vya? does not make sense, since the work is not a k?vya.
(My comments on to 2 and 3 do not apply to the Poru?atik?ram, which is not a grammatical work in the common sense of the term).
2. As far as ?layers? are concerned, my point was that after the Tolk?ppiyam was written down, it might have come into the keeping of a group of (Jain?) scholars, monks, or others who wished to keep it current and added to it or emended it. It is possible, though obviously it?s just speculation, that the section on the pu??i was added when the ?dot? (pu??i) started to be incorporated into the writing system. It is equally possible that the work itself postdates the appearance of the pu??i and that it is not layered at all but is actually the product of one person (or conceivably a group of people) who lived at a certain period. 
3.  It seems to me likely that if the text was added to and/or emended, those who did so would have been careful to keep the name of the original author in order to maintain the legitimacy of the text.
I wonder whether there is any way additions or emendations, if they exist, could be identified. Is there a change in the use of language or any other aspect of the text/content that could be identified as not fitting with some of the other parts of the work? I think this is unlikely, as the emenders (if they existed) would have been careful to add/change things so they appeared to fit with the older text. 
I think a better case can be made that the Poru?atik?ram is layered, or at least that it has disparate elements. It is my impression that the grammatical parts of the Tolk?ppiyam (Collatik?ram, E?uttatik?ram) are more coherent.
