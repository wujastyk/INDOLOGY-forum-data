Thank you Madhav,
You mention aravinda as possibly non-indo-european.  Does that also apply to govinda?
Monier-Williams has govinda as go-vinda with vinda ifc as "finding".  But I vaguely recall (though I can't find it anymore) that MacDonells or Whitneys grammar   had a footnote somewhere that the etymology of govinda was uncertain and that it might be from go+indra through the prakrit.

I was under the impression that words like Mukunda, Aravinda, Maranda, Mucakunda were historically of non-Indo-European origin.  Did Michael Witzel write something about such words?  Trying to remember.  Best,

Dear list members,
Can someone give the etymology of mukunda?
Is the information in Monier-Williams under "muku" a folk-etymology?
muku = mukti (a word formed to explain mukun-da as "giver of liberation")
Thanks,
Harry Spier
