[INDOLOGY] A regressive face of Indology at the World Sanskrit Conference
All:
	While this may be new to the Indology forum and the WSC, similar issues have plagued the Religion in South Asia (RISA) section of the American Academy of Religion since the mid 1990s. Scholars and non-scholars, insiders and outsiders, adhikarin and anadhikarin behaved poorly and poisoned what was a relatively good, congenial, and fruitful samvada. Alas.
	By way of the Doniger affair, some may find this short piece that I wrote in 2014 to be provocative and germane.

I hope that Indology, also a relatively good, congenial, and fruitful samvada is not spoiled, as was RISA and its E-list counterpart, RISA-L.
