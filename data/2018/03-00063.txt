[INDOLOGY] Erasmus Academy
Dear Colleagues,
I am writing to ask whether others on the list (mostly likely others in the US) have experience with students who have taken Sanskrit at the Erasmus Academy (http://www.erasmusacademy.com). The website claims to give students a full academic year of Sanskrit study and to enable them to join intermediate-level courses. The instructor seems properly credentialed and the textbook used is well-known, but we remain skeptical, both because of the format and because the contact hours are 1/3 of what our first-year course would ask.
If any you have worked with students who?ve done courses via this online method, I would appreciate hearing your impressions and opinions.
Thanks,
Don Davis
