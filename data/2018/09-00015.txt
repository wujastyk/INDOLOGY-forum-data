[INDOLOGY] The universe as an image in a mirror
?? ?? ????????????????? 3.2.28 ???????????
itself has the image/simile of images.
?????? here means the Sun's image.
3.2.28 is part of explaining
? ????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????? ?? 3.2.11
Thus 'image' as the relation between Brahman and the (entities in) Jagat is
not limited to Advaita Vedanta. It is common to all schools of Vedanta.
What Dakshinamurti stotra is specifically doing is making Jagat the image
of  Aatman inside the observer's ownself (????????????). For Advaita Aatman
= Brahman.
