?

The Perso-Muslimpolymath al-B?r?n? lived in Central Asia between the tenth and the eleventhcenturies CE. His monograph on India, the Ta?q?qm? li-l-Hind (ca. 1030), isparticularly remarkable, as the scholar describes Indian religion, sciences,literatures and customs in an extremely exhaustive, meticulous and objectiveway; which remains unparalleled for his time. In this work, al-B?r?n?abundantly quotes two texts related to classical S??khya and Yoga philosophieswhich he had also translated from Sanskrit to Arabic. The two texts are respectivelytitled in Arabic the Kit?b S?nk andthe Kit?b P?tan?al. As for theformer, extracts of it are scattered in the Ta?q?qm? li-l-Hind; which remains our only source of knowledge of this work. Acomplete manuscript of the latter exists today and was edited by Hellmut Ritterin 1956. Several established scholars, such as Carl Edward Sachau (1888),Richard Garbe (1894; 1917), Junjiro Takakusu (1904) or Schlomo Pines and TuviaGelblum (1966; 1977; 1983; 1989) attempted to identify the Sanskrit sources ofthese translations. Their efforts however never reached conclusive results.

After an introductionto al-B?r?n??s life and intellectual context, the presentation will focus onthe methods and strategies he adopted when composing the Kit?b S?nk and the Kit?bP?tan?al. Rather than proposing a literal translation, al-B?r?n? isoffering his own interpretation of Indian philosophical concepts to aPerso-Muslim readership. During this process of cultural translation, thescholar negotiated a great deal with his Sanskrit sources. The presentationwill analyse several passages of his interpretations and discuss the possibleSanskrit sources of the two Arabic translations.

The J?mi? al-Taw?r?? or The Compendium ofChronicles is a Persian historical work composed by Rash?d al-D?n Fa?l All?hHamad?n? (d. 718/1318), a vizier who served to Ilkhanid rulers ??z?n (r.1295?1304) and ?ljait?(r. 1304?16), comprising a history of the Turks and Mongols, and a history ofGenghis Khan?s family up to ??z?n?s death (volume one), the history of ?ljait?which is now missing and the so-called the histories of the people of the world(volume two), and a geographicalcompendiumwhich is too missing (volume three). The history of India arranged at the endof volume two is in two parts (qism):the first part contains (i) the measures of time and eras; (ii) the geography;(iii) brief histories of Delhi and Kashmir; and (iv) the kings who ruled ineach of the four epochs in Indic thought (yuga). The second partcontains (v) the beliefs and thoughts of Indic religions; (vi) the life andteachings of ?akyamuni; (vii) explanations about hells (d?za?), heavens(bihi?t), and metempsychosis (tan?su?) in Buddhist thought; and(viii) the description of diffusion of Buddhist schools and other Indicreligions in India and Mongolia at the beginning of the fourteenth century.This chapter ends with (ix) a note on Ra??d al-D?n?s refutation of the beliefof metempsychosis from an Islamic viewpoint. 

??? By contrast to the second part which hasattracted scholars? interest due to its descriptions on Buddhism, the firstpart has less studied after a series of treatises by Karl Jahn. Indeed, thefirst part provides a unique depiction of the ancient history of India thatcolligates the contents of multiple Sanskrit epics and pur??as including the AitareyaBr?hma?a, the M?rkandeya Pur??a, the Raghuva??a, the R?m?yana,and the Mah?bh?rata, according to the chronological order of the Indianconcept of time of four yugas, making slight alternations to the storiesin the sources; the concept of the your yugas in the J?mi? al-Taw?r??is based on the information given by the Kit?b al-Hind of Ab? Ray??nal-B?r?n?, and the contents of each Sanskrit epics and pur??as were given by aKashmiri Buddhist monk Kam?la?r?. In this presentation I will focus on how thestories in the abovementioned Sanskrit epics and pur??as are chronologicallyarranged and altered in writing Rash?d al-D?n?s history of India. In addition,I will explore a profile of Kam?la?r? as an informant of epics and pur??as inspite of being a Buddhist.

?

The fundamentalconcepts of the theory of humours of the Greco-Arabic thought are often seen asstatic and a-historical entities whose identity and function were defined onceand for all in the classical sources. This paper questions this view by lookingat the ?if? al-mara?, a Persianmedical handbook written in India by ?ih?b al-D?n N?gawr? in 790/1388. In thefirst chapter, N?gawr? proposes a shift of perspective in the classicalcategorisation of humoural pathology of the Arabic and Persian texts. Hisproposal is based on a combination of Muslim and Indian physicians? viewsthrough the assimilation of notions of the latter into the conceptual frameworkof the former. N?gawr??s audacious proposal addresses a key question, since theclassification of humours constitutes a central element of the doctrinalidentities of both the Avicennian and the Ayurvedic schools. Moreover, a closerreading of this chapter raises the question of whether N?gawr??s intent was torevise both doctrines at the base of his hybrid nosography. His model can beread not only as a key adjustment to the Greco-Arabic view but also as areconsideration of the Ayurvedic theory which does not count blood among thehumours.

?

In the context oftantric tradition, astrological and divinatory knowledge were required forseekers of liberation. In India, astrology has been a part of the political,cultural, and social apparatus, and received ideological foundations in theVedic tradition. It has been developed as one of the important knowledgesystems as Vedic auxiliaries. In Islamic world, due to the contact withHellenistic sciences, when the classification of knowledge systems wasformulated, astrology was classified into foreign sciences. In medieval Islamicsociety, despite of the debate between the pros and cons of astrology,inherited from Hellenistic doctrines and other foreign sources, it remained aspopular practice among the people regardless of rank just as in the pre-Islamictimes. In the early stage of the intercultural communications among Iranian,Arabic, Greek and Indian intellectual traditions, astrological knowledge wastransmitted through translation activities.?However, the source texts, even in the field of science, were subjectedto undergo the transformation in their own socio-cultural context, and thetranslated texts were widely transmitted in their transformed shape beyond theiroriginal context. In order to provide textual evidences of literarytransformation and various ways of transmission, we will examine two scholarlyworks of renowned astrologers from Ujjain, i.e., Var?hamihira and Narapati. Inthe case of Var?hamihira?s B?hatsa?hit?, al-B?r?n? made success in hisintertextual studies and ?Abd al-?Az?zShams-i Bah?? N?r? showed his intentional neglect to appeal tohis target audience. As one of the source texts of the Am?taku??a, the Narapatijayacary?,having inherited traditional knowledge systems, transmitted the science of svarato Islamic spiritual seekers for liberation and was incorporated inencyclopedic works as one of the indigenous knowledge systems in India. In thecontext of translation studies, both cases will provide typical examples ofknowledge translation strategies.
