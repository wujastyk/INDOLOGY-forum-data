One more verse for M?dhava this evening:

?????? ????? ??????????????? ???????????? ??????? ?
????????? ?? ?????, ???? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??

Having seen a female deer wandering in the forest, O Mukunda, why are
following her. The Deer-Eyed [R?dh?] is right next to you. O M?dhava, stop
running [m? dh?va], stop running [m? dh?va].
