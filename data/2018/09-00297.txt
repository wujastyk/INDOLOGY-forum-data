Dear Colleagues, ? For these issues and connected matter, the Handbook of P?li Literature by Oskar von Hin?ber (Berlin-New York, 1996) remains worthy of being consulted, see precisely p. 83 and 86. Best regards, ?? Georges-Jean Pinault?

?
Since the Table is introduced with an explanation discussing that many texts have multiple names, so that all the texts in the same box are to be considered alternate names of the same basic texts (variants between mss. and editions, etc. included), it would seem the?Milindapa?ha??k? included as one of the titles, would be the same as the Milinda-??k? ed. by Jaini. Tracking down the various editions, mss., etc. could be done by checking the catalogues cited.?
?
The online book?An Analysis of the P?li Canon (http://budsas.net/sach/en137.pdf?)?seems to be a composite of two works. The first part by Webb is an ?analysis? of the P?li canon; the second part, with the table of texts and the catalogues in which they are identified, was initially a different work by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita titled A Reference Table of Pali Literature, which the online edition has added to the Webb book, treating them as a joint work; which is why the pagination for the later part with the Table commences new pagination.
?
Rahula?s article should indicate which edition of the ??k? he consulted, and that then could be examined to see whether that coincides with the Jaini edition (which at first was a separate volume, but PTS eventually included it in their reprint of Pali edition of Milindapa?ha), or is an alternate version of the same (or different) text.
?
best,
Dan

Hello Dan,
?
Do you know if the Milindapa?ha??k? listed here as:
?

Madhuratthapak?sin?, Milindapa?ha??k?, Milindapa?havivara?a (CM ?,
Mah?tipi?aka C???bhaya or Cullavimalabuddhi, 1474)
?
is the same as the Milinda??k? published by Padmanabha Jaini, and published by the PTS?

Here?s a bit more, Madhav.

According to An Analysis of the P?li Canon, Edited by Russell Webb?(Kandy: Sri Lanka, Buddhist Publication Society, 2008 online ed.)
http://budsas.net/sach/en137.pdf?

The -??k? has several names, and the author is identified with two different names, one of them being?Mah?tipi?aka C???bhaya, so this is probably what Rahula was referring to. Pp. 21-22 of the ?Table of P?li Literature,? which begins about 3/4 of the way through the book lists the following.

2.6 Mil
Milindapa?h?, Milindapa?h? (Title is plural: see Mil 419: ... milindapa?h?
samatt? ... tisatapa?h? honti, sabb?va milindapa?h? ti sa?kha? gacchanti.)
H 172ff, PL 110ff, PCS. 2.176, HP
93f, BnF 359f, LCM 1154, SH 237,

2.6.1 Mil-?
Madhuratthapak?sin?, Milindapa?ha??k?, Milindapa?havivara?a (CM ?,
Mah?tipi?aka C???bhaya or Cullavimalabuddhi, 1474)

H 172m, PL 150, PSA 100f, HP 75,
PCS 2.151, SH 237, VP 4/126, CB
49, EP 58, CS.

Not to be conflated with
?
Milindapa?haa??hakath? (B, That?n Mingun Zetawun Say??o/? N?rada
Jetavana, 1949.)

The abbreviations refer to:

I should add, that like with a previous query, this is another case of an earlier and later figure sharing the same name (the later MAH?-Tipi?aka-C???bhaya is 12th c., while the earlier one described by Malalasekera is considered pre-Buddhaghosa). I don?t believe that Jaini, who edited the Milinda-??k?, identified the author of that commentary, but, since it cites Buddhaghosa, it must be by someone post-Buddhaghosa. Cf.?http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an343601.pdf?
?
Barua is quoting Walpola Rahula re: the 12th c Therav?din commentator who wanted to become a Buddha, with the reference: Walpola, R. 1971. L'ideal du Bodhisatta dans le Therav?da et le Mah?y?na. Journal Asiatique: 69.
?
I don?t have access to that Journal at the moment, so can?t check to see what sources Rahula was drawing on. Perhaps someone else has it on hand.

G.P. Malalasekera?s Dictionary of P?li Proper Names offers the following.

http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/culabhaya.html?

3. C???bhaya.??A Thera of Sri Lanka and a well-known commentator; he was known as Tipi?aka-C???bhaya. He is several times quoted in the Commentaries (e.g.,?VibhA.11, 16; Vism.69, 394, 397). He had a prodigious memory. Once he shut three of the gates of?Anur?dhapura, allowing only one door for the use of those leaving the city. As each person went out he asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530). He was a contemporary of?C??an?ga?(DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), with whom he held discussions. His description (given at the?Lohap?s?da) (DA.ii.442) of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic. He once went with a company of monks on a pilgrimage to?N?gad?pa. On the way he stayed in a monastery. One of his followers, who lacked self-control, made friends with another of like temperament in the?vih?ra, and C???bhaya, seeing them laugh aloud, pointed out how truly the Buddha had said in the Dh?tusa?yutta that like joins with like. VibhA.457?f.

In an article by Ankur Barua [http://introductiontoappliedbuddhism.blogspot.com/2009/10/bodhisatta-concept-in-theravada.html], I came across this reference: "Therav?din author who wished to become a Buddha?by following the Bodhisatta-y?na is the `Sri Lankan
monk Mah?-Tipitaka C?l?bhaya. In his subcommentary on the ?Questions of King Milinda? during the twelfth-century, he wrote that he wished to become a Buddha at the end of his work."? Is this commentary the same as the Milinda??k? published by the PTS, or a different commentary?? The Milinda-A??hakath? of U N?rada alias Mingun Zetavun Sayadaw that was written around 1948 and transcribed and published by me [Studia Philologica Buddhica, Monograph Series XIII, Tokyo, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, 1999] refers to the opinion of a Tipi?aka-C?l??bhayatthera on p.57.? I would appreciate any information on this monk and his commentary on Milindapa?ha. Is it available anywhere? Best,
