"From what Rule 106 says, we understand that there existed a convention, either earlier or contemporary, of marking an extra short u with a dot. The tone of Rules 15 and 105 in the Tolk?ppiyam suggests that the author of the text made his own rule of marking a vowelless consonant with a dot.
"It is possible that there existed in the pre-Tolk?ppiyam period, the convention of marking an extra short u with a dot and the author of Tolk?ppiyam extended the convention to the class of vowelless consonants..."
In other words, it was Tolk?ppiyar, the author of the Tolk?ppiyam, who invented the convention of marking a pure consonant with a dot. This means that the Tolk?ppiyam must precede any epigraphic occurrence of the dot (pu??i) and not after as Mahadevan has stated.
The crux of the problem seems to be the interpretation of the rule Tolk?ppiyam 15. Mahadevan has used Kamil Zvelebil?s outdated 1972 translation, ?The nature of the consonant is to be provided with a dot.? Ramamurti (1982:180)?s more precise translation using the imperative/optative interpretation is, "Let/May it be the nature of mey (consonant) to stay with a pu??i (dot).? If the use of dots to indicate pure consonants was already present, he would not have used the imperative/optative construction in the rule.
ETE's 2nd edition?s bibliography includes the afore-mentioned article, Ramamurti (1982). (Both editions? bibliographies also include V. S. Rajam?s  A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry, wherein the imperative/optative use of verbal noun is discussed on p. 820.)  But in the discussion on pu??i in ETE's 2nd edition, Mahadevan does not discuss Ramamurti (1982) but essentially presents the same date for Tolk?ppiyam as in the first edition. See attachment. Mahadevan has not discussed why he still maintained his earlier conclusion.  Has there been any discussion of this issue by anybody else?
