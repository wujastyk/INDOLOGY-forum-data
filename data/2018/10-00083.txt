[INDOLOGY] Nazi-ism, India,
Dear all,
Forgive me if this question has an obvious answer that I don't know.
I recall that in /India and Europe,/ Halbfass discusses the development 
of ideas associated with National Socialism by those who took an 
interest in India. I'm wondering if there is anything classic on this 
topic. I'm trying to reference, in passing, the racist reception of 
India in Europe (the friendliness to "Arya" or "Swastika" for instance) 
where India was treated as a kind of European prehistory, and I'm not 
sure what to point to. I'm happy to point to Halbfass, though I was 
wondering if there was something specifically on this topic (a paper or 
book).
Thanks,
Shyam
