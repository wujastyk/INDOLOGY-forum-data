Dear colleagues,

I have been doing a literature search for biographical information about
Ya?omitra, author of the *Sphu??rth?* commentary on Vasubandhu's
*Abhidharmako?abh??ya* and the *vy?khy?* on Asa?ga's *Abhidharmasamuccaya*.
I am finding almost no information at all.  I see the date 580 in Potter's
EIP, but I don't know where he gets it.  I have looked in Poussin's,
Stcherbatsky, Law's introductions, in SARDS3 (several promising articles,
but I don't read Japanese :-( ), Panditproject, Google Scholar, etc.  While
his views and interpretations of the m?la texts get attention, I find no
discussion about his biographical information.

If you know of any scholarship specifically on Ya?omitra's personal
background, evidence for his date, place of dwelling, lineage, etc., I
would be very grateful for the information.  Is he the same Ya?omitra who
owned the so-called Bower MS, for example?

Best,
Dominik
