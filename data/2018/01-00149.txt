> She printed a trilogy:
> 1) Sanskrit Manual 1956; 1994, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2015
> 2) Sanskrit-Russian Dictionary 1978, 1987, 1996, 2005, 2007
> 3) Sanskrit Textbook 2009
> The Sanskrit Manual is a bestseller for learning Sanskrit in Russia and
> V.A. Kochergina died just a week before the 6th, revised ed. of 2018 is
> planned to come out. She was the incarnation of Saraswati in Moscow for
> generations of students of linguistics.
> The Sanskrit-Russian Dictionary contains 29 000 words and is based mainly
> on XIX century Sanskrit-German dictionaries. It is the most well known
> Sanskrit Dictionary in Russia (there are three more), although it is known,
> that only an 84 000 word dictionary could serve all the purposes of a
> translator from Sanskrit (like DICCIONARI SANSCRIT-CATALA, OSCAR PUJOL).
> The Sanskrit Textbook remains almost unknown, because of many type errors
> and small, unclear Devanagari print. Nonetheless, I'm not aware of many
> other cases when the same person has shown his skills in all three genres.
> She was a scholar, writing mainly on samasas in Sanskrit, Historical
> linguistics, History of Linguistics and a teacher.
