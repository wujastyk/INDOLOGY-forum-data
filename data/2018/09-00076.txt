Dear Matthew,

Good to read you posts: they are always a pleasure, - and a reminder for me to say hello. To get the detail out of the way: the Newar spelling of guthi is indeed dental?, as Newar (not counting Sanskrit words) does not have retroflexes and the the word has been "newarized."

How have you been doing? It has been so long. Srilata, Emilia, and I just returned from our regular Pondicherry summer with a month-long stint in Lalitpur,? to plunge into our respective terms without too much of an adjustment period. Not much time to rest, as Emilia did an intensive course in Upper Sorabian (my mother's family's language) in Bautzen in August and asked me to join her.

Will you be in Chicago for the workshop in honour of Steve in November? I will be joining and if I am lucky, - fingers crossed, - I will see you there.

Warmly, as ever,
Christoph

You may wish to look into the surviving, vestigial manifestation, in the form of the gu?h? of Newar society in Kathmandu. There is a Wikipedia article on the subject https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthi

(though it's misspelled there with a dental instead of retroflex consonant). But I imagine that the literature on Newar sociology and anthropology with have more - perhaps some of the others on the list can help with bibliography in that area.
