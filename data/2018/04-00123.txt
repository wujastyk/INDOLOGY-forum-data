[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit verse today
Wow! Thanks Andrew for your response. Frankly, I didn't expect anyone to
respond, let alone someone from Microsoft. So, I am extremely surprised.
Thanks for your support. Yes, it is only on the browsers where *dyu *appears
as *duya*.  I hope the Harfbuzz developers can issue a fix soon.
Furthermore, I am not sure if it is a good decision to display dyu with
explicit virama, but that's a different discussion. I have many other
questions on the implementation of Nirmala UI for other Indian languages. I
will reach out to you offline.
Thanks again,
Suresh.
