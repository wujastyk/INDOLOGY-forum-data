[INDOLOGY] Scientification in India
This article by Scott Lowe

looks at TM and the issues of vedic science and science.  Another
fascinating example that seems to offer a confluence of Nagaraj's parallel
streams is the FVI, and their aspiration to re-establish a Vedic India.
<http://www.vedicindiafoundation.org/> This page
<http://www.vedicindiafoundation.org/videos.html>has some of their videos
that introduce the TM concepts. Typical of TM, their research
<http://www.vedicindiafoundation.org/research.html> is exceptionally
pseudosciency. One of the speakers was no other than Ramdev swami,
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQcDA7zsVSg> who claims that the goal is
to first create a Vedic (Hindu) nation then Vedic world. It would seem
that, like the Sangh's pivot to using Upadhaya's Integral Humanism
<https://www.academia.edu/36885369/The_unintended_consequences_of_the_International_Day_of_Yoga>instead
of the more controversial, Hindutva, the rhetorical pivot to Vedic also
serves to obfuscate this theo-political aspiration. One of the key members
of the AVI is John Hagelin, who used to work at CERN (the physics lab), but
was too controversial. So controversial in fact that CERN wrote an open
letter to him asking him to stop mentioning his former association with
them. But not too controversial to be awarded the Ig Nobel Prize
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize>. The following is an excerpt
from an article currently under review in which I discuss, in part,
Hagelin's views:
As Eriksen explains, 97 through the commodification of local products into
distant imaginary *-scapes*, many concepts borrowed from science become
theoretically dis-embedded through their use in popular mediums; which
promotes ?representational incorrectness?. This is evidenced in a series of
lectures facilitated by the Vedic India Foundation,98 which present an idea
of quantum physics with a new-age interpretation of Vedic cosmology that
ultimately serves to create a Vedic India and world through combining it
with string theory.99 However, Woit100 argues strongly against this
position, ?Virtually every theoretical physicist in the world rejects all
of this as nonsense and the work of a crackpot?. Ultimately, promoters of
?Vedic Science? aim to legitimise a Hindu nationalist worldview.10

Some 20 years ago, I was deeply enamored by NC Panda's books that seek to
combine advaita darshanas
<https://archive.org/details/TheVibratingUniverseNCPanda_201709>with
quantam theory. I had the good fortune of staying with him in his home in
Bhubaneswar. I fondly remember a discussion around scalar waves and
samadhi.  This collaboration by Deepak Chopra and physicist Leonard
Mlodinow is also quite interesting. While they don't agree on many things,
it's an interesting project.
All the best,
