I wish to thank all the colleagues who kindly responded to my query (also off-list).
Let me add some short remarks:
Nagaraj Paturi refers me to the chapter ?Camatk?ra? in Raghavan?s Some Concepts? It was one of the first things I read when I started taking interest in this subject. A bit disappointing, I should say, particularly because the learned author seems to think that four pages are enough for this intriguing concept.
David Mellins refers me to Prat?k?ra-Indhur?ja?s commentary on Bh?maha?s K?vy?la?k?rasa?graha for a pre-?nanda occurrence of camatk?ra, quoting De about the date of Prat?k?ra-Indhur?ja. I rather cling to the position of Kane, who after a lenghty discussion arrives at a later date (925-950). And even later, if we identify Prat?k?ra-Indhur?ja with the Indhur?ja who taught the Dhvany?loka to Abhinava.
Harry Spier advises me to search the database of Muktabodha, which however hardly contains early texts.
Asko Parpola suggests me to read Shulman?s paper. I had read it, but it mainly focuses on later developments (like the Camatk?racandrik?). Of course, he also refers to some passages from Abhinavagupta (following Gnoli?s translations), but perhaps it would have not been out of place to point out that the abrupt entrance of this seminal concept in Indian philosophy occurs not with Abhinava, but with his paramaguru Utpaladeva (the very important passages on camatk?ra in the ?PVV are after all comments on what Utpaladeva wrote in no more extant Viv?ti passages).
Indeed worth reading is Heidegger?s essay, suggested by Hartmut Buescher.
Many thanks again!
