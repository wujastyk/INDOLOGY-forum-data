This seems an impressively powerful tool. Congratulations! and thank you.
I'll let you know if I note any problems with the Tibetan codings.
Onwards and upwards!

[INDOLOGY] Updates and new look of Aksharamukha
Dear all
Here is Aksharamukha by Vinodh Rajan:
I have done a major update to Aksharamukha. The UI has been completely reformatted to look very modern (and mobile-friendly) and the backend has been rewritten in Python.
The new converter can be now reached at http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/
Aksharamukha now supports 66 scripts that fall within the greater Indic cultural sphere.
You can see a comparison here: http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/#/script-matrix/
You can read sample Texts (in Sanskrit/Pali) in all of the 66 scripts.

It has additionally individual script pages (showing the vowel/consonant repertoire), view syllabaries, conjuncts and even play some games to learn different scripts.
