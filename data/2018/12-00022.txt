This seems an impressively powerful tool. Congratulations! and thank you.

I'll let you know if I note any problems with the Tibetan codings.


Onwards and upwards!

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Updates and new look of Aksharamukha

Dear all
Here is Aksharamukha by Vinodh Rajan:

I have done a major update to Aksharamukha. The UI has been completely reformatted to look very modern (and mobile-friendly) and the backend has been rewritten in Python.

The new converter can be now reached at http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/

Aksharamukha now supports 66 scripts that fall within the greater Indic cultural sphere.

You can see a comparison here: http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/#/script-matrix/

You can read sample Texts (in Sanskrit/Pali) in all of the 66 scripts.
http://aksharamukha.appspot.com/#/texts/nilakantha

It has additionally individual script pages (showing the vowel/consonant repertoire), view syllabaries, conjuncts and even play some games to learn different scripts.
