[INDOLOGY] Caste and Gender at the WSC
Mrs Vajpeyi,
Your words
" Kindly stop trying to justify, excuse, explain or dismiss what happened.
Stop pretending that everything is great because there are Vedic schools
for girls in existence somewhere out there. It won't do. "
show your utter lack of care for my expression of my intention and your
attribution of false motives to my posts.
I did not " justify, excuse, explain or dismiss " what happened. I said
that I was not present where things are alleged to have happened. I did not
say " everything is great because there are Vedic schools for girls in
existence somewhere out there. " Attributing meanings like " everything is
great " which are not there nor intended in my words is not proper way of
coresponding in an academic forum.
When the subject matter of Indology Sanskrit, India and its culture ( not
any incidents in a forum in a conference somewhere) are shown in bad light
by some of its students, ignoring several facts contradicting the negative
claims that are available in the Indian society ( not in any incidents in a
forum in a conference somewhere)  , I  pointed out the flaws in the claims.
At the most you could, as some did, can say that this is not the focus of
the thread.
But attributing false meanings and intentions is not correct.
Since I agree that this discussion is outside the focus of the discussion
here which seems to be   incidents in a forum in the WSC 2018, I shall stop
posting to this thread (these threads)
