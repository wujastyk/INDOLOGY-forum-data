[INDOLOGY] Deccan College sanskrit ditionary
Thanks, Roland, for these references.  While vyaya is a common usage going
back to old classical texts, the particular formation of apavyaya is a
relatively newer formation.  It is more common in modern languages, and
probably entered into Sanskrit dictionaries through the usage of some
Pandits who were the source for western scholars.  That is my best guess.
