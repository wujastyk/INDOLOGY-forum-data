[INDOLOGY] Question about manuscript ownership
Hi Clemency,
The photographs are the intellectual property of the researcher and can use
them as they see fit - unless the terms of sale of the manuscript to the
museum contained restraint of use clauses - which may or may not be legally
enforceable in an Indian court.
Kind regards,
Antonio
