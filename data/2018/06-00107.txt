[INDOLOGY] Epigraphy and Indology
Dear Dr. Paturi,
I am not talking about historically locating literary texts. I have attached some pages from EI 7. They deal with three inscriptions described by three scholars. Each of them uses different literary textual references to explain parts of the inscriptions. But the third inscription also seems to provide an alternate etymology for the name R???rak??a. If the name R???rak??a occurs in a literary text, then Fleet?s discussion would contribute to a different understanding of an item in a literary context based on epigraphic data.
I hope this clarifies what I am looking for.
Regards,
Palaniappan
