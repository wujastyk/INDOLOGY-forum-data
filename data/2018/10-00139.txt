[INDOLOGY] Middle Persian help needed
This may be a slightly odd request for Indology-L, but I have a somewhat 
technical question relating to Middle Persian/Pahlavi, and don't know 
any specialists in the area. If there should be any on the list willing 
to help, I'd be grateful to hear from you (I suppose off-list would be 
best, as the question isn't really related to India or Indology).
Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
