[INDOLOGY] Date of the Tolkappiyam
Dear Paniappan,
As an old student of Prof. Kamil Zvelebil and of his student Dr Saskia
Kersenboom I am not convinced that his translation is wrong or outdated.
Moreover, even with his translation you can argue that the imperative is
prescriptive for the first time.
In other words, his translation is here only cited as a "strawman" with the
WISH to attribute a more ancient date to the Tolk?ppiyam.
Since, however, the most generally accepted etymogy of  Tolk?ppiyam is "old
K?vya" and since K?vya has a convincing etymology from the Vedic-Old
Persian kav? this grammar was apparently composed or at least "named" after
Sanskrit K?vya developed as a literary phenomenon. Which would match the
datings proposed by Prof. Tieken in his recently reprinted study on this
issue.
Best regards,
Jan Houben
