As part of Dr. Ramasubramanian?s visit, CSIS will host a workshop, ?Reading Jyoti???stra Texts,? which will run from Monday, April 23, 2018 to Friday, April 27, 2018.
The workshop is open to anyone interested in reading and learning about Jyoti???stra texts, that is, texts on the astral sciences and divination. No background in Jyoti???stra is required, but a good understanding of Sanskrit is necessary to follow the discussion.

(1) The Siddh?nta?ekhara of ?r?dhara, an astronomical treatise from the 11th century CE.
(2) The Kara?apaddhati of Putumana Somay?jin, an astronomical text from the 18th century CE.
(3) The Candr?rki of Dinakara, a text of solar and lunar tables from the 16th century CE.
Anybody interested in the subject is welcome to attend the workshop.
