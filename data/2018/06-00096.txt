Dear Nagaraj-ji,
thanks for your answer. Well, I understand what the Jayama?gal? says, but I am not able to reconcile it with my understanding of the classical S??khya teaching. As we know, puru?a, being an absolutely different ontological category from prak?ti, in fact cannot be ever bound by or released from prak?ti. This is not possible, as SK 62ab clearly says: tasm?n na badhyate n?pi mucyate n?pi sa?sarati ka?cit.
Best,
Lubomir
