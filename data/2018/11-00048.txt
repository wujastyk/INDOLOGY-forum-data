[INDOLOGY] brick-making communities
Dear Dominik,
for the 19th century, some information about the brick-making communities is scattered in various Statistical Accounts, District Gazetteers and similar publications, but I am not aware of any synthetic study (at least not for Bengal). Normally, Watt's Dictionary of the economic products of India tends to be useful, but not in this case.
I have found only one study among my files:
FOGELIN, Lars (2006) Brickmaking in Malapannagudi: Ethnoarchaeological Research and Archaeological Implications, 
in: John M. Fritz, Robert P. Brubaker and Teresa P. Raczek (eds.), Vijayanagara: Archaelogogical Exploration, 1990?2000, New Delhi: Manohar, pp. 577?586.
Best,
Lubomir
