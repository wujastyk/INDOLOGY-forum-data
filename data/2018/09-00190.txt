[INDOLOGY] Garuda's resolution
Dear Artur
I would not take ajanam as an adj. depending of [tv?m = Garudam] but as a neutral subst. = a desert [place], a [place] devoid of people. Indeed if the serpents are immortals and poison all the people, it will be the case. See the same interpretation by J. Charpentier Die Supar?asage p. 269-270 (making also the // with the MBh 1,30.7) :

"da werden sie Menschenleere bewirken"
In the MBh, I understand that "they would expel us" (it is Indra who speaks) = the gods (normal, since by loosing the amrta they would lose their overlordship).
Best,
Christophe
