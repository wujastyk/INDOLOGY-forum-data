Dear David,


Of course, this thread is about the use of brackets, not translation per se, but because the issue was raised I wish to say, despite my customary agreement with you, that the issue of "literary" vs. "literal" in Tibetan translation from Sanskrit is a red herring. Some Tibetan translations do indeed have the status of major literary works in Tibet, others are virtually unreadable, even for suitably educated Tibetans. And the storied Tibetan literalism, the reputation for translations that are word for word calques, is generally misleading.


It is true that the Tibetans worked with a highly standardized translation lexicon, but they departed from this when it was clearly warranted to do so. Moreover, given the polysemy of Sanskrit, the better translators recognized that choices had to be made on many occasions. In addition, there are many features of Tibetan translation that are not explicitly represented in the Sanskrit at all; for instance, compounds, in Tibetan translation, often in fact give the vigraha of the compound.


I cannot imagine that anyone might consider the Tibetan translation of a phrase from the BCA, rasaj?tam ativa vedhan?yam as gser 'gyur rtsi yi rnam pa mchog lta bu, "like the best form of the gold-transforming-ointment," to be precisely "literal," but in the context of the verse in which it occurs, it works perfectly well.


As for Tibetan translations from Chinese, as Stein showed some decades ago, some are really very approximate paraphrases (e.g. the Tibetan Shujing), others attempt to "Indianize" certain Buddhist works of Chinese origin, while others still adopt a distinctive lexicon for the representation of Buddhist ideas.


as ever,

all best,

Matthew

Dear David, dear all

I am not very sure about engaging here, but my great appreciation for David and his contributions (as well as his personal kindnesses to me) prompts me to try to correct what I see as a few misunderstandings here.
