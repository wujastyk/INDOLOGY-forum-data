[INDOLOGY] prosit vobis annus novus MMXVIII
Dear Chlodwig:
prosit neujahr, indeed!
Could it perhaps be that the pada cited is a variant of the following from Bh?rav?? (Kir?t?rjun?ya 16.37)
jihv??at?ny ullasayanty ajasra? lasatta?illolavi??nal?ni  |
tr?s?n nirast?? bhujagendrasen? nabha?carais tatpadav?? vivavre ||
all best wishes,
Adheesh
