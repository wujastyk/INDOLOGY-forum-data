[INDOLOGY] BhG quote
Excellent idea!
False Quotes itself can be very good web domain name that can accommodate
false Einstein quotes, false Freud quotes, false Marx quotes, false
Shakespeare quotes, false Mahatma Gandhi quotes etc.
That can not probably have quotes from the holy books of religions of
books.
But such a collection will be a very good source for folklore research,
research on informal communication, research on popular spread of knowledge
etc.
