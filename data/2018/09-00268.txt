There is no word for 'bushy' in the verse.
But  in gopucchAgraM , agram is the qualified, the topic, the focus.
For some one feeling the touch of the cow's tail from its root/beginning,
the end is a sudden change, hence a surprise.
Similarly in a kAvya, after the description of udAtta bhAvas, description
of adbhuta gives a sudden change, a surprise.
Giving details of the surprising part of the cow's tail as 'bushy' is just
for adding details, for explanation/elaboration.
