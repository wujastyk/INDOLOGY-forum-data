[INDOLOGY] Soma and Amanita muscaria
Dear Nagaraj-ji,
To my disappointment I see that the scholars to whom you refer quote the
Rgveda without giving the accent although it is an indispensable feature
for determining the precise meaning of a mantra; a feature, moreover, which
Paanini and the Praatisaakhya authors took so much trouble to describe in
detail and which has been studied with much critical acumen by modern
scholars such as Oldenberg, Thieme, Palsule, etc. (for excellent Vedic
scholars I do not distinguish between "western" and "indic", at the most
between "modern" and "traditional").
The basic necessity to take into account accent should apply also, and, I
hope, all the more, to the new "??stric research methodology" you and your
colleagues are now proposing to design and develop.
I would recommend the use Gandhari Unicode which allows to type all
required accents for Sanskrit, Vedic and even for other Indo-european
languages.
For Devanagari the Nakula and Sahadeva fonts do give a basic possibility to
put the accent in Rgvedic style.
There may be other fonts for Sanskrit and Vedic in Devanagari which allow
putting accents even in a better, more detailed way including according to
the style of other ??kh?s as well.
With best regards,
Jan Houben
