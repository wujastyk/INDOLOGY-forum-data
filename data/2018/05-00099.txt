[INDOLOGY] Spaces between words in Sanskrit manuscripts?
Alluded to earlier is what happens in A?oka's inscriptions, studied in
detail by Klaus Ludwig Janert:  Absta?nde und Schlussvokalverzeichnungen in
As?oka-Inschriften, Wiesbaden, : F. Steiner, 1972 . Verzeichnis der
orientalischen Handschriften in Deutschland. Supplementband ; 10. Some of
the VOHD is available online free, but apparently not this volume, as far
as I see from a cursory search. This work was much reviewed, and has an
English introduction, so even if you cannot read German it is not difficult
to discover his main points.
