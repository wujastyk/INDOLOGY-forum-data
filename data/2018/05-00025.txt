Dear list members, 
Does anybody have a .pdf copy of the following article (or know where to find one)?
McCutchion, David J. ?An Unidentified Sa?h?ram?rti of ?iva at Bh?ior (West Dinajpur).? Journal of Indian History 48, no. 1?2 (1970): 345?56.
I would be very thankful if could share it. 
With best wishes,
