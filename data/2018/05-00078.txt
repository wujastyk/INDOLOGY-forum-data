Continuing with my Krishna verses:

Bearing the touch of your feet as you were dancing in the courtyard of
Gokula, the earth shook up with excitement and joy.

When you were just born from your mother Devak? in the prison, you showed
her your cosmic form.  Seeing that the earth shook up.

Even though you were just a child, you felled and killed the huge demoness
P?tan? who had come to give you poison.  At that time, the earth shook up.

On the holy battlefield of Kuruk?etra in the battle between the Kauravas
and P???avas, hearing the sound of the conch P??cajanya [the conch of Kr???a],
the earth shook up.

When your cosmic form was shown to Arjuna during the battle, when he was

When the Y?davas, fighting among themselves, were all killed, and when a
hunter struck your foot, the earth shook up.


??????? ??????????? ??????????????: ?

Even though your incarnation was over, you as the bestower of safety to
your devotees never went away from here.  You are always everywhere, O Lord.


?????? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ????????: ?

??? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????? ???????? ???????

With you being present everywhere, your coming and going [as an
incarnation] is only a fiction.  Realizing this, with a calm heart, the
earth stopped shaking.
