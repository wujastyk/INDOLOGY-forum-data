Dear Dominik and colleagues,


(1) Concerning kh / ?:

Ulrich  Schneider wrote that the alternation of *kh / *? is due to their
phonetical resemblance in the following article (see attachment; 1954: 580,
n. 22 = 2002: 23, n. 22).


Ulrich Schneider,

1954    ?Acht Etymologien aus dem Agga??a-Sutta?, in: *Asiatica:
Festschrift Friedrich Weller*, Leipzig, pp. 575~583  =  2002: 18~26.

2002    *Opera minora*, hrsg. Marion Meisig, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz
(Beitr?ge zur Indologie 39).


I asked my teacher, Mr. K. R. Norman, for his opinion on this matter more
than thirty years ago in Cambridge. According to my memo, he said that the
two *ak?ara*s, *kh(a)* and *?(a)*, resemble in some Br?hm? scripts.

However, I do not think this confusion is due to writing ?? I cannot find
such a script ???, but purely due to phonetical resemblance. *Puru?a* is
pronounced like *purukha*, while *sukha* is pronounced like *su?a*. I
assume that both *kh* and *?* were (are?) pronounced as voiceless velar
fricative (x) at least in North (West) India at certain times.


(2) Concerning *j? /j*

Writing and pronunciation often differ. I wrote about lots of instances of
confusion of *j??na* / *y?na* in the Lotus Sutra and other early Mah?y?na
scriptures, and assumed that *mah?y?na* originally meant *mah?j??na* (this
word occurs in the older manuscripts of the Lotus Sutra), i.e.
*buddha-j??na*. Both *j??na* and *y?na *become as *j?na *or* j??a* in
certain Middle Indic as well as modern languages. I wrote elsewhere as
follows (?Vehicle (*y?na*) and Wisdom (*j??na*) in the Lotus Sutra ??? the
Origin of the Notion of *y?na* in Mah?y?na Buddhism?, in: *Annual Report of
The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka
University*, vol. 18 (2015): 170f.)


OIA. *y?na* (= P?; G?ndh?r? *ya?a*) becomes *j??a* in Prakrit (Pkt.), while
OIA. *j??na* (> P?. *???a*, G?ndh?r? *?a?a*) develops into *???a*, *n??a *or
*j??a*.(Cf. Pischel: ? 276.) Though Turner (CDIAL 5281 *j??na-*) assumes
that the development *j??na* > Pkt. *j??a* took place under the influence
of the verb *j?n?ti*, I assume the development *j?-* > Pkt. *j(j)* might
have occurred by itself (note 1). There are traces of OIA. *j??na* > Pkt.
**j?na*/*j??a*, found in medieval and modern dialects, such as: Old Marathi
*j??a* (see DOM, s.v.), Sindh? *j??u*, Panj?b? *j??*, Gujar?t? *j??*,
Kashmiri *z?n*, New?li, Bengali, Hind? *j?n* etc. (Turner, loc. cit.). To
sum up, both *y?na* and *j??na* became **j?na/j??a* in Prakrit (note 2).


     1 Cf. *?j??* > Pkt. *ajja*, *praj??* > Pkt. *pajj? abhij??* > *ahijja*;
*vij?a* > *vijja* ; *sarvaj?a* > *savvajja*; *suj??na* > *sujj??a *(cf.
Pischel ? 276); *j??nin* > *j??i*; *sa?j??* > *sa?j?*. Cf. also
*Siddhahemacandram
Adhy?na *VIII*, *II 83. *|| j?o ?a? || 83 || j?a? sa?bandhino ?asya lug v?
bhavati | j??a? | ???a? | savvajjo | savva??? | appajjo | appa??? |
daivajjo | daiva??? | i?giajjo | i?gia??? | ma?ojja? | ma?o??a? | ahijjo |
ahi??? | pajj? | pa??? | ajj? | ??? | sa?j? | sa??? || kvacin na bhavati |
vi????a? |* (Pischel 1877: 53); BHSD, *a-j?naka*, *j?naka.* In the Jain
text *Mah?nis?ha*, whose language is essentially Jaina M?h?r???r? though
blended with Ardham?gadh?, we find a part, where *n??a* and *j??a*, both
Pkt forms of Skt. *j??na*, occur repeatedly side by side (Deleu / Schubring
1963: 51; translation 120f.).

       2 In the Jaina text *S?yaga?a*, ? 1.1.1.18, there is a word *j??ay?*,
which is said to mean ?Buddhists? (cf. MW, s.v. 2 *j?naka* ?pl. the
Buddhists?). Some relate this form to *y?na*, while others to *j??naka*.
Cf. Boll?e 1977: 75.

Also, some Chinese transliterations indicate that* j??na* was pronounced
*j?na*, T. 28, no. 1546, 33a. ????(EH. d?ja na > QYS. ?ja n?-; <
*j??na*)???(wisdom)????(EH.
bi d?ja na > QYS. bi- ?ja n?-; < *vij??na*)???(consciousness). Cf. also a
famous translator?s name, ???? Jn?nagupta. The Chinese character ?(EH. d?ja
> QYS. ?ja) was used otherwise to render Indic *j?, jh?*, e.g. ??(*jh?pita*),
?? (*j?ti*).


Sorry for this long e-mail.
