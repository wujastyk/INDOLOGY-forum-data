[INDOLOGY] IndUni keyboard layouts?
Dear List,
I am currently trying to update my unicode diacritics input method from the "cut and paste? and or ?autocorrect? input methods I currently use. I was pointed to the IndUni keyboard layouts which I found on John Smith?s web site, however since the instructions are from 2009 I am not finding it easy to adapt to current Mac OS. Is their a better input system than IndUni that people use or have people learned to adapt it to current OS? 
Thanks for any input/help!
Best Wishes,
Ben Fleming
