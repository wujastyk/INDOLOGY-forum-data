Subject: [INDOLOGY] IndUni keyboard layouts?
Message-ID: <YTXPR0101MB14533A2540E463035147D264A4950@YTXPR0101MB1453.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear List,

I am currently trying to update my unicode diacritics input method from the "cut and paste? and or ?autocorrect? input methods I currently use. I was pointed to the IndUni keyboard layouts which I found on John Smith?s web site, however since the instructions are from 2009 I am not finding it easy to adapt to current Mac OS. Is their a better input system than IndUni that people use or have people learned to adapt it to current OS? 

Thanks for any input/help!

Best Wishes,
Ben Fleming
