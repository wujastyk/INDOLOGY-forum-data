[INDOLOGY] Garuda's resolution
Dear Prof. Hock,
Thanks for the detailed analysis of the sentence.
But. 'Anyone'.
My English-Polish/Polish-English Dictionary directs me from 'anyone' to
'anybody'. And - according to it - 'anybody' may also mean 'somebody
unimportant'. In Polish: 'byle kto'.
Would you - definitely - exclude this very meaning? After careful
deliberations, I decided for using it in my Polish translation of the
episode.
Best,
