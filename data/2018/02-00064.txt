Here is the job descripton in English:


This professorship is in keeping with the long scholarly tradition which has established EPHE as one of the world?s leading centres for the study of Shaivism. Far from being merely one of the components of Hinduism, Shaivism has been since at least the VIth century its most creative and reactive agent in politics, philosophy, the arts, rituals and symbolism. The richness and profusion of its forms place it at the point of contact with several of India?s other religious components, including Buddhism. As such Shaivism is among the most dynamic fields at the cutting edge of the studies of Ancient India?s religions and is at the heart of a rich set of teachings on the societies and religions of Asia at EPHE. In view of the diversity of the multi-millenial, multiple and extremely plastic currents which make up Shaivism ? Epic and Puranic Shaivism, Tantric Shaivism, philosophical Shaivism, even mystical Shaivism, the successful applicant must have a proven record of expertise in one or ideally several of these fields. Teaching shall be given in French and based in Paris, in coordination with the EPHE Doctoral School.
