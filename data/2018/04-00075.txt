O M?dhava, Great Actor, you created the drama of Mah?bh?rata on the
battlefield of Kuruk?etra. You are Vy?sa. You are Arjuna. You are Kr???a,
and you are the holder of strings.

O M?dhava, where did your Godhood go on the battlefield of Mah?bh?rata? Why
did you not restrain your own people from their destruction?

O Lord, I think that you produced this imaginary drama to always teach us
the lesson: ?Don?t you ever act like this.?

Dancing in the forest of Vr?nd?vana, you bring upon a rain of sweetness.

I am content with your honey, O M?dhava, and I do not wish for anything

else.

O M?dhava, bearing your name and taking just a droplet of your honey, I
offer it at your feet. Have your compassionate gaze on me.
