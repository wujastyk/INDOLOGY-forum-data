[INDOLOGY] How ancient DNA may rewrite prehistory in India
Dear Jarrod,
     Thanks for posting the link for this interesting article.  Research
and politics will both continue unhindered.  Not to worry.  I am curious as
to how the politics in Pakistan responds to such new findings about the
Indus Valley.  With best wishes,
