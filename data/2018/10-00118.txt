I would like to concur with Dr Gonzalez-Reimann about the recent book
publication by David Reich, *Who We Are and How We Got Here*.  I am reading
the book right now, and couldn't resist reading chapter six, "The Collision
that Formed India," first.  It's fascinating, as are the early chapters on
recent developments of research methodology in palaeo-genetics.  The
research of Reich and his collaborators in laboratories across the world
offers genuinely new evidence that directly affects the interpretation of
ancient South Asian history.  It's important.  And the evidence is
compelling.
