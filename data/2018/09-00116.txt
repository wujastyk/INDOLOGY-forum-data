[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY LIST
Dear Dr. Dominik
I hope you are fine.
My brother Mr. Rajendra Prakash Jain (rpjmlbd at gmail.com) would like to
become a member of your Indology List.  He is going to start an
e-journal, *MLBD
Journal of Vedic Renaissance* which he shall be operating under an
independent foundation, *MLBD Research and Resource Foundation*. Therefore
he requires support from scholars who are members of your list. The website
of the foundation is www.mlbdfoundation.org. Kindly get in touch with my
brother directly.
Sincerely
Rajeev Jain
