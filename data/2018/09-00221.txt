[INDOLOGY] Indo-European graduate studies?
?
Dear colleagues, I may add that at the EPHE I give courses in Tocharian, Indo-iranian and Indo-european, plus reading of the Rigveda at the university Paris 3. Besides, I am responsible for the cursus/curriculum of graduate studies in IE linguistics and typology of languages at the EPHE ? (part of the Master EEMA). The EPHE provides a relatively large choice of courses in several IE and non-IE languages, done by scholars of international reputation. We welcome regularly foreign students preparing Master's degree and PhD. The information about the courses given in the two semesters of 2018-2019 is given on the web site of the EPHE (www.ephe.fr).
Best regards, Georges Jean PINAULT, Directeur d'?tudes,? EPHE, Paris?

Dear Dominik,
There is also a useful list of universities currently offering courses and options in Indo-European studies on the Indogermanische Gesellshaft / Society for Indo-European Studies website, with helpful web links to individual programmes.
https://www.indogermanistik.org/indogermanistik/studium/lehrstuehle.html
Which programmes may be considered 'top' probably depends a lot on what a given student wants to research given the field is broad and different departments have their own special areas of concentration. In the USA, UCLA, Harvard, and Cornell have very good generalist IE programmes. There are many more in Europe; the programmes in?Copenhagen, Cologne, Munich, Leiden, Jena, Z?rich, and?Vienna are all highly regarded (apologies to my colleagues if I've missed any other obvious programmes).
Kind regards,
Matthew
