[INDOLOGY] BhG quote
Since this topic has come up, it may be worthwhile to point out that
Jivaram Kalidas Shastri published two different versions of the BG. The
1937 edition is based on a manuscript having 21 additional verses over the
standard 700. In 1941 he published an edition based on a different
manuscript that he had discovered in the interim having 745 verses. I do
not know which one of the two Gondal editions, of 1937 or of 1941, is based
on the manuscript that Dominik described.
