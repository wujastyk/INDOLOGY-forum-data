Since this topic has come up, it may be worthwhile to point out that
Jivaram Kalidas Shastri published two different versions of the BG. The
1937 edition is based on a manuscript having 21 additional verses over the
standard 700. In 1941 he published an edition based on a different
manuscript that he had discovered in the interim having 745 verses. I do
not know which one of the two Gondal editions, of 1937 or of 1941, is based
on the manuscript that Dominik described.
