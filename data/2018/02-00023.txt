  Dear list members,

  I am working on the Chinese translation of Kum?ral?ta's *Kalpan?ma??itik?
D??t?ntapa?kti *(also known, less correctly, as* S?tr?la?k?ra*). Heinrich
L?ders' in his 1926 *Bruchst?cke der Kalpan?ma??itik? des Kum?ral?ta*
occasionally makes first hand statements on the Chinese translation of
Kum?ral?ta's work and on other Chinese sources, but mostly relies on
others' translations (Huber, Przyluski, Waldschmidt). Does anyone have a
clue of the extent of his grasp of Chinese? Is anyone aware of an explicit
statement in his work regarding his Chinese proficiency? I have the
impression that he read very little Chinese??in Berlin in the 20s he must
have had, though, plenty of access to both texts and sinologists. A very
minor question, but of interest to me.
