[From my main e-mail address]

In my work with the Pali works - original texts and their translations - I
come across traces of a peculiar practice.

The translators tend, not infrequently, to supplant plain, ordinary, common
terms with their more elegant, subtler lexical equivalents.

There is a *Greek/Latin* *term* for this practice - but I cannot recall it.

May I count on your help *re*?
