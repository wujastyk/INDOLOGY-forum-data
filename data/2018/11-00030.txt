[INDOLOGY] Language use at the site of the Statue of Unity
The following article <https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/fact-check-name-board-with-wrong-translations-of-statue-of-unity-is-not-fake-news/articleshow/66475323.cms> states, "It appears that the translation errors were caused as those in charge of putting up the signage decided to use transliteration tools available online instead of taking assistance from natives."
Here is the Google transliteration tool for Tamil.

If you type 'statue of unity', you get ???????????? ????? ????????. Clearly, this is what they have done.
If they had used the Google Translation tool, they would have obtained ??????? ???? (O??umai cilai). If they had asked a native speaker, it would have been ????????? ????.
They have used transliteration tool for languages available in the transliteration tool. For other languages, they seem to have used translation tool. I do not know why they gave primacy to the transliteration tool.
Many thanks to all those who commented on the different language versions.
