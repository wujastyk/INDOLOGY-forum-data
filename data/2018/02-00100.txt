Dr.Gargeswari,
&nbsp; Thank you very much for the information. In fact, previously I accessed Amazon.com ,where I found the book to be out of stock. However ,there I had a chance to see the Front Cover of the book, from where I got the Publisher' s name- Vivek Hamsa Prakasana, Bangalore. I accessed their site too, but found no mention of this particular book.Thus,as a last recourse, I thought if any PDF is available.I shall certainly get to the Adwaitya Asram site referred by you.Thank you once again.
RegardsAlakendu Das.

[INDOLOGY] ? IshaBashyaUpanishad
Please buy the book from this online store
http://www.advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami Tyagishanada
The book costs Rs 200.00 that would be less than $4.00.
I wonder why PDF of popular books that are printed by thousands should be shared . I understand if PDF of books which rare, out of print or not easily available in a particular country or library are shared.
Regards
Ajit Gargeshwari
