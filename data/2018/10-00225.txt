[INDOLOGY] Question about manuscript ownership
Antonio nails it, I think (except we're talking about copyright, not
intellectual property rights).  Assuming there aren't any special
contractual agreements, the copyright of the photocopies belong to the
person who made the photocopies.  It would be the same with photos.  They
belong to the photographer, even if the original manuscript doesn't.
Jonathan raises some interesting special cases, but I am certain your
colleague can go ahead and use copies of the photocopies in a publication
without any risk of prosecution.
Best,
Dominik
