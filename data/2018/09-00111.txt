Dear Artur,

Your query has given me an excuse to take out time to compare the new
translation of the critical edition of the Mah?bh?rata by Bibek Debroy,
something I had been wanting to do.

Bibek Debroy translates this sentence as:
I will not give the soma to anyone to drink.

The first ever translation, by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, has (chapter 34):
I shall not give the Soma to any one for drink.

The next translation, by M. N. Dutt, has (chapter 34):
I shall not give the Soma to any body to drink.

The translation of this part of the critical edition by J. A. B. van
Buitenen has:
I shall not give it to anyone to partake of.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
