[INDOLOGY] Concerning the International Association of Sanskrit Studies
Dear list members,
Since the letter that many of you signed was presented and publicized on
this list, I thought I would be remiss not to give its members an update on
further developments. The IASS leadership has responded point-by-point, and
their response has been passed onto the signatories. It has clarified some
existing IASS policies, reaffirmed its commitment to scholarship and
neutrality, and noted some changes in the organization. There have
evidently been changes in the leadership (now reflected in their website
<http://www.sanskritassociation.org/>), and the IASS is forming a committee
to address the question of elections for office bearers, which was one of
the main points of the letter. I can only speak for myself here, but I was
reassured by the response, and I took it as an invitation to scholars of
Sanskrit to get involved and shape the future of the organization.
