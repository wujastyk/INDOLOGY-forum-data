DearColleagues,
We are pleased to announce the second update of our material on the 
Oxford Research Archive, first deposited in January 2016, this update 
identified as February 2018. We do so in order that it can be available 
for others to consult even in its present, unfinished state.It can be 
accessed at the same location 
<http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8df9647a-8002-45ff-b37e-7effb669768b> 
or you can find it via the Bodleian Libraries website, under ORA, by 
looking for either our surname or its title, "Development and spread of 
the R?ma narrative (pre-modern)".
There are additions, revisions and corrections to the material 
throughout.However, areas which have seen the greatest degree of 
updating or enlargement are:
oadditions to the dates chart (within the background material folder),
oadditions to the data within 10. visual (India) in the bibliographic 
inventories,
oamplification of the ?R?m?ya?a in Buddhist literature? section of the 
?Development of the R?m?ya?a tradition? survey,
oinclusion of some unpublished conference papers in ?miscellaneous 
drafts and notes?,
oall categories of the ?Narrative Elements?, particularly Central and 
East Asia, and epics (Uttarak???a).
Because of the nature of our own contacts this message is being sent 
primarily to other Indologists but, if any of you are aware of 
colleagues in other fields (for example Southeast Asian languages or 
visual culture) who might be interested, do please pass the information 
on to them ? and similarly, if anyone has access to suitable academic 
lists on which it could be posted, we would be grateful for its being 
sent to them.
As usual, we should be grateful for any comments from anyone who has 
used the material.
With all good wishes
John and Mary
