=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_camatk=C4=81ra?=
Keeping in mind that this is not a Heidegger-list, my point was merely to
draw
attention to a philosophical attempt by Heidegger to elucidate a particular
onto-phenomenological mode of aware-being that resembles *camatk**?ra* as
employed "in all Utpaladeva-Abhinavagupta-K?emar?ja?s works" (Torella) with
a meaning that differs from the meaning that became the communis opinion.
Referring in fact to Torella's adumbration of the connotative aspects of
*camatk**?**ra*
(in his famous note: 1994: 118f.), I did not translate this term by
*Erstaunen*,
but indicated that Heidegger, in the noted section, tried to convey what he
means
by the "Wesen des Er-staunens". However, I resisted to imitate Heidegger's
mode
of marking a *non-**communis-opinion* employment of a term by writing
myself,
e.g., "as-tonishing". Hence my "rather astonishing" should somehow indicate
that he does not talk of *Erstaunen* in the ordinary sense of
*Staunen/Verwunderung*,
hence not in a sense that may be traced back to Greek sources.
To mix up these at least two different connotations by referring to a bunch
of passages in Heidegger's works does little ? beyond usefully hinting at
passages
that may be studied for that purpose ? to differentiate these.
Naturally, I consider it as fairly inappropriate to continue
discussing Heidegger on this Indology-list.
Best wishes,
Hartmut Buescher
