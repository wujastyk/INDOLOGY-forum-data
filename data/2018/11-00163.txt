My apologies for a second post: the link to the classical paper on ?ghost oppression? I used apparently timed out. You can download the study from the first paper on that mentioned in this link to Google Scholar:

>> Hallucinations may arise, as Steve Farmer usefully observes, in anyone whose default mode network has been interrupted by any means, whether that be through drugs, self-flagellation or whatever. Robin Cahart-Harris et al. have for several years been publishing interesting results of the action of LSD and psilocybin on the DMN.

>> However, I believe that the core of the issue relating to soma/haoma is whether or not soma/haoma was/is capable of inducing an 'entheogenic' state. (We are of course in the area of tricky and contentious demarcation criteria here.) I am not talking about strange hallucinogenic experiences but an experience of what might be called 'divine transcendence'. Even high doses of LSD in optimal, controlled conditions only induce a transcendent experience in about 6% of subjects (see my book for references). Such transcendent experiences may also involve hallucinations, but these are secondary (and relatively insignificant) phenomena in the context of a properly transcendent experience. Experience of the 'cosmic', non-dual void or Godhead is the paramount and rarely obtained treasure.

Sleep paralysis is common not only in narcoleptics but can be triggered as well in just about anyone by chronic use of stimulants ? as well as by a wide range of behavioral interventions including ritualistic sleep deprivation, which also often involves stimulant use.

> So in my post I really didn?t have some kind of generic hallucinations in mind, but took it for granted that those involve visions of anthropomorphic beings of some sort, which are a regular feature of intense stimulant-induced hallucinations. This is also true of the auditory hallucinations in schizophrenics triggered by acute as well as chronic use of methamphetamine, cocaine, methylphenidate, and a wide range of other stimulants.

> A standard means of diagnosing suspected schizophrenic tendencies, in fact, in which auditory hallucinations are the most common type, comes in fact in what is known as an ?amphetamine challenge? or ?methylphenidate challenge.?  On this and related topics, see, e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460884 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460884>.

For some further hints here, see, e.g. http://tinyurl.com/yckyupfk <http://tinyurl.com/yckyupfk>, where the list of related phenomena actually includes alien abductions! :)
> 
> I think all this really boosts your key argument, Matthew, which I find to be persuasive: that many different drugs could have triggered the kinds soma-like religious visions we find in Vedic sources. My only slight modification of your argument is that I think the evidence is clear that different classes of drugs lead to similar results, not just those we choose to classify as ?hallucinogens.? What is critical in my view, as I argued in my original post, isn?t the specific drug but what neural systems are perturbed.

I think that you and I discussed this at one point years ago. It is nice to see Matthew suggesting the same thing, backing his case with cross-cultural evidence involving ayahuasca, which has long been known to involve different mixtures of drugs in different S. American regions.

> That said, in discussing the different types of plants & drugs putatively linked to homa/soma, I suspect that Matthew underestimates the potential role of ephedra (or ephedrine), which like a long list of similar sympathomimetic drugs in modern use (cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, etc.) is capable with chronic use of triggering schizophrenic-like visions not substantially different from those produced (if more reliably) by the hallucinogenic substances used in ayahuasca or similar psychoactive mixtures in the premodern world.

A frantic search was on at the time for replacements for those drugs since an increasing number of narcoleptics were having psychotic reactions to the drugs that involved visual and auditory hallucinations indistinguishable from those seen in schizophrenics and users of LSD and similar psychedelic drugs.

> 
> The evidence is very strong today that hallucinations of similar sorts can be triggered by many different kinds of drugs, not just those currently viewed as psychedelics. The similarities are explained by many recent fMRI and post-mortem anatomical studies that suggest that the main driver of hallucinations of all sorts involves disruptions of neural systems linking ?higher? cortical regions in the prefrontal cortex to subcortical networks and key integrative neural networks in the insula and linked cortical structures, e.g. the anterior cingulate.

> The key point here is that *any* disruptions to the default resting networks linking those regions ? whether deriving from ingestion of exogenous chemicals like those in ephedra or by specific neurological diseases (bipolar disorder, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, Huntington?s disease, & many others that produce hallucinations) will lead to similar schizophrenic-like or waking-visions.

Hallucinations on this model whether triggered by stimulants, psychedelics, intentionally cultivated visionary experience, visions induced by sleep deprivation, or for that matter a well-aimed hammer to the head can all be expected on a deep level to look pretty much the same.
