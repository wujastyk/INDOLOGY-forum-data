[INDOLOGY] Small dish with Ranjana inscription
Dear McComas,
This is a typical Buddhist votive object with Sinitic n?gar? script. The eight petals: o? ma?i padme h?? (counter-clockwise) and the b?ja letter hr?? in the center. The outer ring must be another dh?ra??. Tony Lin has a number of works in Chinese discussing all these objects. I am happy to share the bibliography if it is of interest to you.
