[INDOLOGY] quote source
Dear folks,
I?m wondering if anyone knows the source of this quote I found in Abhinavagupta:
'pravibhajy?tman?tm?na? s???v? bh?v?n p?thag vidh?n |
         sarve?vara? sarvamaya? svapne bhokt? pravartate  ||'
Which I?ve translated as: Dividing the Self by the Self, having created entities of different types, he places them separately.  The Lord of all, consisting of all, is the enjoyer, the experiencer in dreams, who sets things in motion.
Thanks for any assistance!
All best,
 Loriliai Biernacki
