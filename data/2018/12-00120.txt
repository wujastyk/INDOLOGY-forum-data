ShankarAcharya ,as has been known , wrote commentaries on Ten Upanishads,namely Isa,Kena,Katha,Prashna,Mandukya,Mandukya,Taiterriya,Aitteriya,Chhandognya,and BrahadAryanaka.The karika,also goes something like this-"IsaKenaKathaPrashnaMandukyaMandukaTittiriAitteriyaChhandognyaVrahadAranyakaDASHAUpanishadamYatha." It would be interesting to know if ShankarAcharya wrote any commentary on Swataswatara .&nbsp; &nbsp;Alakendu Das.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] date of the ?vet??vataropani?adbh??ya

Dear Colleagues,



is there any serious attempt to date the ?vet??vataropani?adbh??ya attributed to ?a?kar?c?rya? Already &nbsp;the editors of this text (AAS 17) list several reasons why this work cannot be written by ?a?kara and almost all scholars accept this view. So it seems there is a scholarly consensus that this is a late text, but I did not find any discussion on the date of this work.



Thanks,

Lubomir
