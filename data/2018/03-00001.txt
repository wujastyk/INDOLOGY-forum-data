The Jain presence in the Tamil country has passed on a rich cultural 
heritage. This DVD-ROM is a pioneering attempt to document all Jain 
sites of Tamil Nadu through a compilation of photographs, historical 
text and maps, readable from a computer. It presents about 400 sites 
with Jain vestiges: temples, cave-temples, rock shelters, loose 
sculptures and inscriptions ... Studied in their artistic, historic and 
religious dimensions, they shed light on the uniqueness of Jainism in 
Tamil Nadu. The living aspects of Jain religious life (worship, 
festivals, etc.) are also considered. This DVD includes an extensive 
photographic documentation, a search engine and an interactive map.
