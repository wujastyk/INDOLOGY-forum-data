Dear Krishnaprasad,

     One more thing I want to mention is that ideally the curve of short
"i" over a consonant (?) should touch the vertical center line of a
character like ??.  With the increasing length of consonant clusters,
ideally one needs a variable length for the curve of ?.  Some computer
fonts are able to do this, and others are not.  The end of the curve of ?
not touching the vertical line of the final consonant of a cluster does not
look that great, though even many printed editions fall short in this
respect.
