[INDOLOGY] Grant/Sabbatical Opportunity at NU
Dear Colleagues,
I?ve received notice of a grant/sabbatical opportunity from a new research group here at Northwestern, the Center for Fundamental Physics. Part of their mission includes "interdisciplinary activities that reflect upon, illuminate and reveal the assumptions, implications and methods of fundamental physics.? To that end they are soliciting applications for ?an interdisciplinary visitor? (explicitly mentioning philosophy and theology) for stays beginning in 2019. I would quite selfishly love to see an Indologist in that role, whether coming from a philosophical, theological, or history of science perspective.
The initiative website is here: http://cfp.physics.northwestern.edu
A description of the opportunity and application guidelines are here: http://cfp.physics.northwestern.edu/interdisciplinary-grants.html
Applications are accepted through December 1, 2018.
All best,
Mark McClish
Northwestern University
