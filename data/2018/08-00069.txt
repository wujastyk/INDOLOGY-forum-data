[INDOLOGY] Chandela of Bundelkhand (bibliographical request)
Dear Metthew,
thanks! My books are packed because I'm moving to a new flat and the
department's library is closed in August, so it's quite difficult to read
new material.
I don't know if I'll never try to plan a project on Chandelas. But I find
strong analogies with the Pala of Kamarupa (that now is my main
geographical area of research):
Both are supposed to be hinduized or mixed-blood (samkarajati) dynasties.
Both reigned between the X and the XIII century CE.
Both were linked to the cult of the yogini.
Both produced erotic sculpures.
So, I need to know much more about Chandelas, their origins and their
religious life - maybe through the iconographical study of their temples.
Best,
Paolo
