[INDOLOGY] Question on Sarasvati as a masculine title
Dear Madhav,
I have lost track of the reactions to your question.  Maybe someone has already drawn your attention to compounds like K?lid?sa, Lak?mivardhana, etc. discussed in Wackernagel and Debrunner, Altindische Grammatik, Band II, 2, pp. 304-6. If not, I do hereby.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Question on Sarasvati as a masculine title
Dear Colleagues,
     This morning I came across this book, where the author's name is given as ?????????????????????, where the word "sarasvati" occurs with a short "i".  This "sarasvat?", as well as "Bh?rat?" is added in the title of many Sannyasins.  Sometimes I see the titles with a long "?", and here is an instance of a short "i".  I am wondering as to what is the common practice and the grammar of that practice, especially since normally feminine expressions are being used in male titles.  Any suggestions?
