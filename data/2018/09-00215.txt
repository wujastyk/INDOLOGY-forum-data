his work appears well known and used in various writings related to the "Out of India" view.

A colleague working on Hellenic religious reconstructionism recently came across an 1852 book by one Edward Pococke entitled India in Greece: Truth in Mythology (Containing the Sources of the Hellenic Race, the Colonization of Egypt and Palestine, the Wars of the Grand Lama and the Bud'histic Propaganda in Greece) . The book itself is [ https://archive.org/details/indiaingreeceort00poco | available ] on Archive, and there is some [ https://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-no2007036969 | information ] on the author on WorldCat, but not much. Would anyone on this list happen to know more about Pococke and his work? 
Thanks in advance, 
Martin Gansten
