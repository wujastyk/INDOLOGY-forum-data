We are delighted to inform you that Amrita Darshanam ? International Centre
for Spiritual Studies, in association with *N?riv?da*, Indira Gandhi
National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), is organizing a three-day national
seminar on ?*?akti Worship in India*? from September 21 to 23, 2018 at
Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, Kerala.
More than 25 scholars of renown will deliver invited lectures on the
different aspects of *?akti* worship in India. During the course of the
seminar, *two traditional rituals will be performed*: *Pa?ayani and
Kalamezhuthu
Pattu. *
*Pa?ayani* is a masked performance of an ancient ritual performed to
appease the fierce Bhadrak?li after she kills D?ruka. According to the
legend, it was first performed by ?iva?s *bh?taga?a*-s in order to pacify
her anger which could, otherwise, destroy the worlds. It is unique to
central Kerala ? particularly popular in the districts of Kottayam and
Pathanamthitta.
It will be elaborately performed in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, on *21
September 2018* by traditional artists (Making of *kollams* (masks) will be
done throughout the day. Performance starts late evening, and will continue
into the wee hours of the morning)
*Kalamezhuthu* is a temple ritual that has three stages ? (a) drawing of
the *kalam*, (b) worshiping of the *kalam* with lights called *thiri
uzhichil*, and (c) erasing of the *kalam* *maykkal*.
It will performed in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, on *23 September
2018* (Drawing of *kalam* will start on the evening of 22/9/18; the ritual
