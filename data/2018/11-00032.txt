[INDOLOGY] Language use at the site of the Statue of Unity
Since among the Indian languages, Bengali version alone is translated, I wonder if the person who worked on this could be a Bengali. As a Bengali, he could realize the problem with transliteration. So he could have chosen to use translation for that version.
