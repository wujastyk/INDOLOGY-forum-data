[INDOLOGY] Accuracy in translations
I am concerned that the conversation seems to have turned to the idea of a
universal right way to translate.  Isn't this a mistake?  Several people in
this conversation have noted the point about translating differently for
different audiences.  And of course, we're all individuals ("I'm not!" :-)
So there can't possibly be uniformity across translations of the same
text.  Nor should we seek it, any more than we would require that a room
full of painters should produce the same painting of a bowl of fruit.
There is such a thing as error, and sometimes that accounts for very
different translations.  But setting that trivial case aside, there can
still be many good yet different translations that are appropriate to
different audiences and that are done by translators with different
backgrounds and propensities.
Best,
Dominik
