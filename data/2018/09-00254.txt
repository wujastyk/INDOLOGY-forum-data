[INDOLOGY] Purva Mimansha
To my knowledge, the term ?codan?? in the M?m??s?s?tra refers to the 
fundamental injunction (literally, compelling injunction) among a lot of 
injunctions (vidhi-s) of a sacrifice. It prompts one to perform the 
sacrifice making one know the originality/novelty (ap?rva), that is, the 
unique form (r?pa) of the sacrifice that consists of the combination of 
oblation and deity.
