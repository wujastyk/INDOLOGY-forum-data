To my knowledge, the term ?codan?? in the M?m??s?s?tra refers to the 
fundamental injunction (literally, compelling injunction) among a lot of 
injunctions (vidhi-s) of a sacrifice. It prompts one to perform the 
sacrifice making one know the originality/novelty (ap?rva), that is, the 
unique form (r?pa) of the sacrifice that consists of the combination of 
oblation and deity.

See my paper ?Change of View on Ap?rva from ?abarasv?min to Kum?rila.? 
S. Mayeda (ed.): The Way to Liberation, Indological Studies in Japan, 
Japanese Studies on South Asia No. 3, New Delhi, 2000, 149?165, p.150, 
notes 1?5, and 16, in:
