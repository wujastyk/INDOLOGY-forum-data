=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_gang_zag_and_puru=E1=B9=A3a?=
Dear List,
A colleague who does not subscribe to the list is investigating the Tibetan term gang zag and its use as a translation of Sanskrit puru?a or pudgala. I am unfamiliar with Tibetan, but am told that gang zag can be etymologized as ?full? (gang) and ?impurities, outflows? (zag). If it is a rendering of puru?a, I can see that ?full? might come from reading the first part of puru?a as p?ra. The rest eludes me. There is also the fact that puru?a occurs in P?li as purisa, close to Sanskrit pur??a (?rubble," ?feces," etc.).
Any help untangling the relationship between these terms and their translation between Tibetan and Sanskrit/P?li would be most appreciated.
All best,
Mark McClish
