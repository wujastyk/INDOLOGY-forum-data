Dear Birgit,
Betty Hermann's The Significance of Prefixes in Sanskrit Philosophical Terminology
though not quite what you are looking for,
may be of interest in this context nevertheless.
And, if I recall correctly, Bochenski, in his History of Formal Logic, has a useful discussion of the logical use of eva.
best,
Matthew

Jan Gonda once published a 15 page article about the Sanskrit particle api entitled "The Sanskrit Particle api.?
I think Luther Obrock has a useful flow chart laying out its usage too.
All the best,
Eric

How can I forget. I myself wrote an article on kira/kiri as well:  ?Two Peculiar Usages of the Particle kira/kiri in Apabhra??a?. Sambodhi 32 (2009), 33-36.
In this article I refer to Van Daalen's article mentioned in my previous mail, published in IIJ XXX (1988), pp, 111-137 and to I. Ickler, Die vedische Partikel kila, published in Zeitschrift f?r vergleichende Sprachfirschung 90 (1976), pp. 50-86.

The article by Emeneau, entitled "Sanskrit syntactic particles ---
khalu, khila and nuunam", appeared, if I recall correctly, in JOAS in 1969.
I don't recall where Joel's article appeared.

Hi Birgit:
Off the top of my head, there is the wonderful article on ?iva? by Joel Brereton, and I think on ?khila? by Emeneau.

Dear colleagues,
I was wondering whether any of you know of resources to recommend especially to students on commentarial interpretations of particles, especially api, ca, tu, eva, which function as connectives and logical operators. I am particularly interested in presentations of the range of options that are available from vy?kara?a analysis, and discussions of the metalanguage used (e.g. avadh?ra?a, samuccaya, sambh?van?, ati?aya ...).
There is much material tucked away in footnotes to various publications, of course, there are helpful classics like Speijer's Sanskrit Syntax, there are some remarks in introductory textbooks and grammar works, and some efforts were made towards compiling patterns of commentarial language inTubb & Bose's "Scholastic Sanskrit" and in Angot's recent "Sanskrit commentarial", and there are articles dealing with specific particles and their logical implications (esp. eva), but I have not come across attempts to offer more comprehensive inventories of the terms ??stric commentators use in interpreting particles.
Pointers would be much appreciated; I'll collect responses and post a list later.
With best regards,
