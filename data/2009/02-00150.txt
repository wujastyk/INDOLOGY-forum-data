    Perhaps the instance you are thinking of 
occurs in the first of CandrakIrti's closing 
verses to his _yuktiSaSTikA-vRtti_:

klu yi rkyen yin 'jigs dang bcas pas yongs spangs pa
rigs pa'i ku mu da 'di kha 'byed _zla ba_ ni
nyes pa'i 'byung gnas rab rib rnam pa rab bcom nas
blo gros mi ldan skye bo rnams la _grags pas_ mdzes
