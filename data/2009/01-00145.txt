resending question on chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions              and conjugations?
In the traditionally popular verse using all case forms of the word rAma, the vocative comes at the end, after the locative:
rAmo rAjamaNiH sadA vijayate rAmaM ramezaM bhaje
rAmeNAbhihatA nizAcaracamUH rAmAya tasmai namaH /
rAmAn nAsti parAyaNaM parataraM rAmasya dAso'smy aham
rAme cittalayaH sadA bhavatu me bho rAma mAm udhara //
This was also the common order in the old zabdarUpAvali manuals I remember from Pune.

Re: resending question on chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions and conjugations?
In this connection, note that the prakriyaa show both orders. They give the vocative forms after three forms (sg., du., pl.) of the first triplet (nominative); e.g., v.rk.sas v.rk.sau v.rk.saa.h, v.rk.sa, v.rk.sau, v.rk.saa.h (Ruupaavataara), raama.h raamau raamaa.h, raama raamau raamaa.h (Siddhaantakaumudii).  The Ruupamaalaa, on the other hand, gives 'sukla 'suklau 'suklaa.h after the forms of the seventh triplet (locative). This does not mean that a syntactically distinct vocative set is recognized.  According to Paa.nini, the first triplet of endings (prathamaa) is introduced on condition that invocation (sambodhana) is involved (2.3.47: sambodhane ca [prathamaa]); the endings in question then bear the class name aamantritam (2.3.48: saamantritam), and the first or singular ending (ekavacanam) of the set is called sambuddhi (2.3.49: ekavacana.m sambuddhi.h).
