Bhagavad Gita Translation?
Dear Mary,
 I happen to have a Bhagavad gita translation with a commentary, forthcoming 
with Ashgate, UK, under the name 'The Bhagavad gita; Philosophy, Structure 
and Meaning'. If you are interested I could possibly send you a PDF version.
 All the very best,
                             Ithamar
