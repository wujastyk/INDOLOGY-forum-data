Subject: Bhagavad Gita Translation?
Message-ID: <161227087125.23782.6643076553936363422.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Mary,

 I happen to have a Bhagavad gita translation with a commentary, forthcoming 
with Ashgate, UK, under the name 'The Bhagavad gita; Philosophy, Structure 
and Meaning'. If you are interested I could possibly send you a PDF version.

 All the very best,
                             Ithamar
