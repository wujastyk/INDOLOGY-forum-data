What Devanagari text would you most like as an e-text
Regarding E-texts:
Does anyone know of the existence of an e-text of the Niilamatapuraa.na?
I have begun transcribing the two-volume publication of the text (Motilal 
Banarsidass, 1973) of Dr. Ved Kumari while reading through it, but have 
temporarily set this work aside in order to complete another project.
I will return to this if, indeed, no e-text of the work yet exists and no 
one else is doing the same work.
