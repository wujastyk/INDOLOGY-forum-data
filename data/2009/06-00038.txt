Subject: What Devanagari text would you most like as an e-text
In-Reply-To: <C6474476.2874%frederick-smith@uiowa.edu>
Message-ID: <161227086709.23782.9740976415831842595.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Regarding E-texts:

Does anyone know of the existence of an e-text of the Niilamatapuraa.na?

I have begun transcribing the two-volume publication of the text (Motilal 
Banarsidass, 1973) of Dr. Ved Kumari while reading through it, but have 
temporarily set this work aside in order to complete another project.

I will return to this if, indeed, no e-text of the work yet exists and no 
one else is doing the same work.
