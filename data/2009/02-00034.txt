Dear Colleagues,
I tried to find out the earliest record of the annual cyclones that visit the south eastern coast of India around November. I could not go? beyond 1885.?Could anybody kindly inform?of any older record of the event?

Corpus topographicum Indiae antiquae : complete in 2 vols.?
The catalog record for this book seems to indicate, by the angle
brackets and space after 1990 and 1-2, that the catalogers thought that
more vols. beyond vol. 2 were to be expected:
LC Control No.:       75513010 
Main Title:        Corpus topographicum Indiae antiquae : a sodalibus
                      Universitatis Gandavensis et Universitatis
Lovaniensis
                      editum / curantibus A. Scharpe? ... [et al.].
Published/Created: Gent : Universitas Gandavensis, 1974-<1990   >
Description:       v. <1-2   > : maps (some col.) ; 31 cm.
pt. 1. Epigraphical find-spots / by R. Stroobandt -- pt. 2.
Archaeological sites / by G. Pollet, P. Eggermont & G. van Damme.
It is now 18 years since vol. 2, no other vols. appear in WorldCat, and
the title appears to be o.p.  Does anyone know if the work is now
complete, even more vols. were intended?  If so, I will get the catalog
record changed.
Thanks,
Allen
