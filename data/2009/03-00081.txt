No longer Language barriers --- financial barriers
I guess I was wrong; unfortunately, not everybody had enough of this.  
So here we go for one more round, hopefully the last. I apologize for  
responding a bit late; I was busy during the last few days.
Dr. Gruenendahl is right. Two times are not enough to establish a  
pattern. Perhaps next time he will side with me against a point made  
by Prof. Slaje, but I somehow doubt it.
What I object to, of course, is not the fact that he takes sides in a  
discussion, but to his aggressive manner, malicious distortion of what  
I said, his use of ad hominem arguments, and cheap psychological  
analysis of the type ?Franco writes because he wants to draw attention  
to himself, undeserved attention.? In the same vein I could say, e.g.,  
?Gruenendahl?s offensiveness is only due to some personal frustration,  
deserved frustration.? However, I do not want to regress to  
Kindergarten level.
Some of you have voiced the concern that the list has become a place  
for personal and private battles. I can assure you that there was  
absolutely nothing personal in my remark about the Glasenapp  
Foundation. Furthermore, Dr. Gruenendahl and I do not know each other;  
at least I do not remember ever meeting him.
Further, I do not think that Dr. Gruenendahl *purposefully* distorts  
what I said, but that his vision is blurred by some agenda. The same  
kind of distortion, at times even spiteful criticism he displays in  
some of his published work, notably in his attempt to exonerate German  
Indology from the charge of having been affiliated with National  
Socialism. There was a discussion about this last year on the list.
With best wishes,
Eli Franco
