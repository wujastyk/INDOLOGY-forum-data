Sri Lankan Ayurveda
Dear Indology List members,
After reading Dominik's fine essay I followed up his reference to  
Vaidya Bhagwan Dash's Fundamentals of Ayurvedic Medicine (Delhi:  
Bansal and Co. 1980), which has a chapter (pp.141-157) entitled  
"Cannabis in Ancient Medical Texts". It includes a list of 51  
formulations containing cannabis which have been described in a dozen  
ayurvedic works. One of the 11 varieties of modaka ("formulations used  
in round bollus form") is madana modaka (p.155). Unfortunately Dash  
does not say which texts contain details of which formulations.
Yours, with best wishes,
Jim Mallinson
