Subject: Need references for descriptions of Buddhist nuns in literature
Message-ID: <161227087644.23782.5116231832645003415.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear All,

I'm looking for any descriptions of Buddhist nuns in any earliest  
Buddhist literature.

Specifically, I'm interested in understanding whether our literature  
reflected reality, and if so to what extent.

In literature -- How are the Buddhist nuns described?

In reality -- How were they officiated? What did they wear? Did they  
wear any jewelry to adorn themselves? Did they shave their head? What  
did they eat? Where did they live? Did they maintain their ties with  
their kin? What did they do on a daily basis -- did they go around  
and preach, and if so what did they do and preach?, ... , so on and  
so forth.

I would appreciate any informative posting on this list. Please also  
feel free to contact me directly at: <rajam at earthlink.net>.

Thanks and regards,
Rajam
