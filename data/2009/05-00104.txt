Zeitschriften der DMG digital
Dear all,
You may already know this, but you can produce a pdf by the following method: save each page as a JPEG (right click > Save image as > JPEG), then convert these to pdfs and stitch them together. Bit time consuming, but better than nothing.

In saving a page one is asked whether one wants to save only the  
frame, only the text or the whole website, etc.. The page of the  
respective article is only saved if you choose "complete website". At  
least that's the way I could save some articles.
