Dear Alexandra,

The new SARIT service can do this.

E.g.,

   http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/getwordcount.pl?indologica.0.1

is a wordlist of the Arthasastra, sorted in descending order of frequency. 
Ca and v? head the list, as one would expect.  One can also do Manu.

The Intratext service does this too.  See

 	http://www.intratext.com/BHI/

There are the Skt texts of the RV, Kasikavrtti and Mahabhasya.

Best,
Dominik
