typing Devanagari
Madhav is right and I forgot to mention that Microsoft Word for Mac is  
not 100% unicode compliant (but many programs are).  Microsoft only  
claims to be compatible with certain keyboards (I pasted below  
Microsoft's unicode/keyboard statement).
Based on the recommendation of several people, I will be transitioning  
from Word to Mellel (http://www.redlers.com/) for this and other  
reasons, unless anyone here could suggest a reason not to or a better  
alternative.
My best,
Steven
