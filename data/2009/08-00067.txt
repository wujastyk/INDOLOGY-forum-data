ZDMG articles downloadable as single files
Same here -- I have downloaded dozens and opened them with Skim on the  
Mac (same experience with Adobe and Preview which I tested just now)  
and encountered no problems.  If re-downloading doesn't work (as  
apparently different versions of Adobe doesn't make a difference as  
per DB's post), it sounds like a problem with the files themselves  
(unique to the PC?).  We can test it if you point me to a particular  
non-functioning file (in case I was just randomly lucky with the files  
I chose).
