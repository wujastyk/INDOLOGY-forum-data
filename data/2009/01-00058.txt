Gita
Hi George!
   Well, I've got 11 students for an advanced course in
Hinduism and they're all going to read you translation of
the Gita.  Last semester there were 30 in my Intro class so
if your royalties take a dip that may be why.
   BTW, Fritz Staal seems to be losing his marbles. I was
reading a set of essays in which he had a short piece. Very
bizarre. Have  you noticed this?
   Also, send these type of messages *directly* --not via
the list. My INBOX is jammed enough!  And how much snow do
you have?  Hope you've been able to recover after that stint
w/out electricity.  Guess it's been pretty cold though, from
what I've heard.
take care,
Tim
