nakedness of female ascetics
Actual use of the freedom available in principle must have been rare (as is
also the case with males, although their actual number is/was larger than
the number of naked female ascetics). One later example is available in the
Vira Saiva tradition (as I recall, the name is Mahadevi Akka); see A.K.
Ramanujan's _Speaking of Shiva_.
