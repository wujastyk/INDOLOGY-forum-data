invertebrates
The demon then seems more like some sort of hybrid of mainland taxa, not
much 'invertebrate' parts. Maybe the idea is that the demon merely hides
in the/a conch, like some mini-lobsters do? That would explain the tiny
horns, though horns are of course an excellent feature of any demon. The
whole animal gives the impression of a horned macaque. Even the number of
legs is non-invertebate.
Thanks for the enlarged version!
