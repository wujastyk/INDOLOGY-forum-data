Translations into Sanskrit
There is Sanskrit translation of the Bible, printed in the grantha  
script, from 1863. Perhaps there are earlier ones.
If I remember correctly, Sylvain Levi discusses some evidence for the  
translation of the Alexander Legend into Sanskrit in the early  
centuries CE.
Best wishes,
