What happened when Brahmins became native Tamil speakers?              (Re: "kaapya-" ...
Dear SP,
I agree that the fact that inscriptions use "n" or "?" is not a 
significant issue. I just mentionned it for the sake of completion;
Regarding your two earlier posts (the first one dated 14 Aug 1999 and 
the second one dated 10 Aug 2006),
they contain indeed a lot of interesting data, some of which seems to be 
interpretable using the "v?ddha vs. yuvan" distinction which was evoked 
at the beginning of the thread and commented upon by Professor Cardona:

mistakes])

There are three Classical Tamil poets from Madurai with the following 
names: p?l?ciriyar napp?la??r, p?l?ciriyar na???ma??r, p?l?ciriya? 
c?nta? ko??a??r
Regarding each of these U. V. Saminataiyar  suggests they were probably 
teachers of children, based on Ta. p?la < Skt. b?la (ca?kak?lap 
pulavarka?, p.342-3). The Tamil Lexicon also interprets it in the same 
manner.
However, a study of Tamil inscriptions reveals that p?l?ciriya? is a 
variant of Tamilized p?r??arya, ie., one who belonged to the lineage of 
par??ara/?r?.
An inscription, SII vol. 17, no. 598, of the period of Kulottunga Chola 
II (12 th century) gives three variants of the same name as:
p?r?ciria?, p?r??r?a?, p?l??r?a?
When considered along with other names in the inscription, it is obvious 
that it is a gotra name. There are other inscriptions which give the 
variant p?l?ciria?. Another inscription gives the variant p?r?carian.
This will help us correctly interpret the name of another CT poet 
"maturai i?amp?l?ciriya? c?nta? k?tta??r". UVS intreprets the name as 
teacher c?nta? k?tta? who was originally from the place called i?amp?l 
and later
settled in Madurai. The correct interpretation should be, "c?nta? 
k?tta?, the young  one of the lineage of par??ara/?r?".
We have other poets with part of the names derived from gotra names such as:
maturai i?a?kaucika??r (kau?ika) ,
ko/??ima?kalam v?tu?i na?c?nta??r (v?dh?la) ,
k?cipa? k?ra??r (k??yapa) ,
ka?ampa??rc c???iliya??r (????ilya),
ta?k?l ?ttir?ya? ce?ka??a??r (?treya)
Similarly, CT poet k?????u e?iccil?r m??ala? maturaikkkumara??r and 
m??ala ma?aiy?? of Cilappatik?ram were brahmins of the m??ala gotra 
which is one of the gotras listed by Chitralekha Gupta in "The Brahmanas 
of India., 1983, p.117. Similarly, tolk?ppiya? probably belonged to 
k?pi/k?pya gotra. Both m??ala? and k?ppiya? occur in inscriptions.

Do I understand you correctly if I say that you think that the "v?ddha 
vs. yuvan" distinction (i.e. "g?rgya" vs. "g?rgy?ya?a"), could be 
expressed in Tamil, AT LEAST in the cases WHEN it was felt NECESSARY, by 
making use of /tol/ ("ancient, senior") and /i?am/ ("young, junior") 
components of the long names.
In that case, the forms you quote, /i?amp?l?ciriya?/ and 
/i?a?kaucika??r/ are the Tamil equivalent of /yuvan/ forms.
Similarly, /tolk?ppiya?/ could be the Tamil equivalent of a /v?ddha/ form.
Is this what you mean?
