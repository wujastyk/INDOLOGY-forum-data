frequencies
Obviously Sanskrit is a language functioning in a timeless never-never
world. It is the language of the Brahmanical sacred world-order. Thus it
would probably never have been meant to be a vehicle of daily communication.
Sanskrit is timeless, pure and holy, at least certainly since the second
millenium (C.E.). The use of Sanskrit by Buddhists in the first millenium is
certainly remarkable. Could it indicate a strong tendency on the part of
Buddhists to adapt themselves even more to Brahmanical norms than the texts
of the Pali canon seem to indicate? The comparison with Hebrew is
interesting, for Hebrew is another ancient sacred language of scriptures and
not of daily communication on worldly matters. Latin and Arabic also
developed these tendencies.
But I'm no linguist.

Onderwerp: Re: frequencies
Frequency in Sanskrit does not work in the same way as in English and  
other modern languges. It is possible to complie a list of 3000 words  
in English that cover 70-80% of "all" conversations, newspaper  
articles, etc. This is just not possible in the case of Sanskrit--if  
it were possible, it would have been done a long time ago--because the  
vocabulary is highly specialized according to literary genres. On the  
other hand, if one moves within the same genre, one can go back and  
forth hundreds of years without any difficulty, something that cannot  
be done in English, German, French and do on. Hebrew is an exception,  
but this is a special case.
