Dear Dagmar,
piling a question on a question,
I wonder whether what you describe might be linked with a question I 
asked on this same list in 2002
See

I elicited a few answers, such as:

It is possible that trying to describe what "laughing" is,
in a phonetic/scientific perspective
(without saying that it is "le propre de l'homme" :-)
is as difficult as explaining "kh, g and gh"
to a dravidian speaker (who knows only "k"),
and requires references to animal cries
I hope this is useful
Best wishes
