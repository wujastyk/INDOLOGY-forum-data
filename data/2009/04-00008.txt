There was also a discussion on carbon-dating manuscripts at a panel at 
the last conference of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 
in Atlanta (2008), occasioned by a presentation (I think) by Harry Falk 
- hopefully, the papers of this panel will be published.

Mark Allon apparently also has a lot of experience in this area (and is 
also subscribed to this list ...)

For a neophyte such as myself, it all sounded terribly complicated - 
even decoding the results (percentages of certainty spread across date 
ranges) seemed far from trivial.

All the best,

Birgit Kellner
