Durga with a violin
Dear Dr Lysenko,
This is definitely neither Durga nor Sarasvati, but Siva as he has been represented by Philip Baldaeus in his book published in Dutch in 1672 and translated into English in 1703 (search on http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/kvk.html for the exact title).  This illustration appeared there as a wood-engraving and has been reproduced also by Partha Mitter in his "Much Maligned Monster" (Oxford: Clarendon press, 1977, fig. 28 p. 65 & see pp. 57-59 & 64). It is there evident that there is no violin in the hands of the god, but an object which looks like a bottle (which also does not make much sense).  Apparently, the engraving included in the PDF document to which you refer copied the original by Baldaeus (reversing left and right and misunderstanding the god's attributes - but Baldaeus himself did not understand all of them !).
