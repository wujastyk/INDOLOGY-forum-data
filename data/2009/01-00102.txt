Dear Herman, Colleagues,

I believe Rachel Fell McDermott has done work on this. I don't have  
any specific references. I'm not sure if she's on Indology and will  
see this, but if she doesn't respond, try the RISA list. I know she's  
on that. I'm not sure that the following would have any of the  
references you're looking for, but there's also:

Jeffrey Kripal, "Kali's Tongue and Ramakrishna: 'Biting the Tongue' of  
the Tantric Tradition," History of Religions 34/2 (1994).
