nakedness of female ascetics
I believe that old Hindu women have a reputation for getting extreme about ritual purity, which sometimes leads to doing housework stark naked, which sometimes can be glimpsed through the door or gate.  I've noticed what seemed to be cases of this myself, but I can't remember which cities or years.
To judge from occasional comments in advice columns through the years, some American women, presumably neither very old nor mad, find it more comfortable to do the housework naked.
