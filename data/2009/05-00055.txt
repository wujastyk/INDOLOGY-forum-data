Dear friends,

I remember vaguely to have learned that in Vedic Sanskrit the word amrita
does not mean immortality but rather something like ' long life'. Can anyone
provide me with some references to articles on this word? I am also looking
for parallels in other Vedic texts of the so-called Purusha-sukta (Rig Veda
10.90).Or perhaps adaptations of this hymn in later Sanskrit literature:
Epics, Puranas.

With many greetings and many thanks

Victor van Bijlert
