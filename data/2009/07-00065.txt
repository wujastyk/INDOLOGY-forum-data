Dear INDOLOGY members,
Has anyone come across the verb "hre?" - "to neigh" or "to whinny" in the 
sense of "to laugh"?
I am reading a passage in the medical treatise A????gasa?graha 
(S?trasth?na 2.16) on correct professional conduct for a physician that 
reads
hre?a??y?? ca tadv?rrt?? na prak??ayate bahi?|
"He does not reveal any xxx news about him outside."
Obviously, "to be neighed" does not fit the context.
Any suggestions would be very welcome.
I am not an INDOLOGY list member: kindly CC replies to me at

With thanks,
Dagmar
