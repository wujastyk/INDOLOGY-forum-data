Subject: Tibetan text of the Kasyapaparivarta commentary (data)?
Message-ID: <161227085081.23782.653181268471524753.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Friends, thinking that I would always be able to get it, I never downloaded
the Tibetan text of the Kasyaparivarta commentary from the Asian Classics
Input Project website. That website is now unavailable, however. Does anyone
have that downloaded text, and would be willing to send it to me as an
attachment (off-list, of course)?

many thanks in advance, jonathan
