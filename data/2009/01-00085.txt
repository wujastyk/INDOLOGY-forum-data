Hi Sandra,

The Visvabrahma temple in Alampur apparently has a sculpture of a crab (illustration for the story of the heron and the crab). The story of 'The brahman and the crab' seems to be illustrated on several South Indian temples. See: Channabasappa S. Patil in: Marijke Klokke (ed.), Narrative sculpture and literary traditions in South and Southeast Asia, Brill, 2000, p. 86 and 83-4 (resp.), and the bibliography given there.

Anna.
