Language barriers --- financial barriers
Would-be investigators are invited to accept my initial suggestion (repeated, I am afraid, again in vain) by starting to make their inquiries with the contact person of the HvG-Foundation:
The list must not serve as a platform for insinuations, and detective games are better lived out in a private sphere. I am really sorry to say that - being under constant deadline pressure - I am forced to establish priorities and can no longer participate in pointless discussions. I have no time to mount Prof. Franco's hobbyhorse, but take it he feels happy enough being on it alone.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
me studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
Vindobonae, die XXI. mensis Novembris MCMLXXXIII.
