It is my understanding (largely from the Durga Mahisashura myth and  
bhavachakra representations of ashuras that they are apparently  
conceived of as fundamentally humanoids but with morphing abilities.  
Bhavachakraa paintings usually represent them as human warrior and  
yaksha and yakshis which are a sub class of  ashuras are also  
represented as humans.  Thus, albeit much later than the materials  
that I usually deal with, I suspect that the ashura as humanoid in the  
painting is just revealing, by force of Krishna's power, his true  
form, which according to my understanding of the Durga sequence, is  
the only form in which a ashura can actually be destroyed.
