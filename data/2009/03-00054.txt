Language barriers --- financial barriers
I am now able to be a bit more precise about the source of the hearsay  
about Glasenapp?s wishes not being respected by the Glasenapp  
Foundation. It comes from a student of Paul Thieme, who heard it  
directly from Thieme himself. This does not make the hearsay true, but  
I also see no reason for them to make up such a story. As Dharmakirti  
said of the Buddha: vaiphalyaad vakti naan.r.nam.
If Prof. Slaje has seen von Glasenapp?s will, perhaps he should tell  
us so, and if he hasn?t, he should not pretend to know what?s in it.
The official homepage of the Glasenapp Foundation, to which he refers  
and in which the will is not quoted, is immaterial to the matter.
Best wishes,
Eli Franco
