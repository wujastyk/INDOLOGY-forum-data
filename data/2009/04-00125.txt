pramanas
It would be good to know the context and the text in which these terms occur. Incidentally, the spelling does not look very Pali-like. The earliest occurrence of these terms in epistemological meanings I could think is the Caraka-Samhita. The next would be the Vaisheshika Sutra and the Nyaya Sutra.

Dear All,
I've got a list of four pram??as in a P?li text, these are:
pratyak?a
anum?na
?abda
arth?patti
Can anybody tell me, whether these four are typical for specific  
branches of Buddhist philosophy or perhaps other Indian philosophies?
Would be grateful for any information,
Petra Kieffer-P?lz
