Akota bronzes--a few pages please!
Dear Jonathan,
Check indeed the paper by G. Bhattacharya mentioned before (down this mail), it is also republished in "Essays on Buddhist, Hindu, Jain Iconography & Epigraphy", by Gouriswar Bhattacharya (Studies in Bengal Art Series N? 1, Dhaka: The International Centre for Study of Bengal Art, 2000, pp. 385-406) - see in particularly his endnote 134 (with references to Edgerton & von Hin?ber).

Re: Akota bronzes--a few pages please!
I confess that it occured to me only too late of course to check Sircar
first of all--rather stupid, sorry!
But the context itself as well as othe reference cited by Stefan make me
strongly suspect that the answer should be sought elsewhere (that is, I
don't think we should be disposed to take deva as = deva). A graphic error
is hardly possible, I should think; is there a phonological explanation?
Again, I apologize but our library is closed until next week...
many thanks jonathan
