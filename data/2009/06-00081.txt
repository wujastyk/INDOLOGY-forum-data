small qerry on OOA theory and Indo-european languages
Dear prof. Pandurangi,
A mixture of events, consisting of movements of a decent number of people 
and the spread of their language and innovations, is not easily 'proven' by 
ancientDNA analysis. Do not forget that anatomically modern humans (H. 
sapiens sapiens) are really very similar in their DNA, so finding no proof 
with ancient DNA is not a proof that movements did not take place, but 
merely a lack of proof  thereof. I am not very impressed with such data. In 
addition, mtDNA gives better discrimination, not nuclear DNA.
