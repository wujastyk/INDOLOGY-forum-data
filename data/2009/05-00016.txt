Linear B texts
If the Mycenaeans had written their administrative documents on  
perishable material instead of clay, and all those thousands of texts  
of this type would have been lost (like all texts written on  
perishable material in Ashoka's empire have been lost, and evidently  
the Harappan administrative documents -- for it is difficult to  
imagine those large cities being managed without any accounting),  
would the remaining other types of Linear B texts be better evidence  
for Mycenaean literacy than what survives from the Indus Civilization?
