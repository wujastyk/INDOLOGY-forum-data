Dear Colleagues,
 
I would like to announce the publication of the following book, which might
be of interest to some of you:
 
Jaina Temple Architecture in India: The Development of a Distinct Language
in Space and Ritual
Julia A. B. Hegewald
Monographien zur Indischen Archaeologie, Kunst und Philologie, Vol. 19
G+H Verlag, Berlin
ISBN 978 3 940939 09 9

Hardcover, 693 pages, 966 colour illustrations, 366 maps and drawings,

Jaina Temple Architecture in India is the first comprehensive study of the
development and uniqueness of Jaina sacred structures. The monograph
analyses Jaina temples in all regions of the Indian subcontinent and
outlines clear continuities by covering the period from the early centuries
BCE till the present day. It identifies a distinct approach to the shaping
of ritual space in Jaina temple edifices, which involves often complex
spatial layouts on numerous vertical levels as well as conglomerates of
interconnected sanctums and building elements on various horizontal levels.
These accommodate a multitude of venerated sacred objects and mirror
specific Jaina ritual needs, patterns of worship as well as the translation
of specific Jaina mythological and cosmological concepts into architecture.
These aspects of multifaceted spatial planning are shown to be equally
common to Jaina temples in the diaspora outside India.
