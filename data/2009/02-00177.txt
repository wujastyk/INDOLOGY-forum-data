Krishna as Vishnu
Dear Harasha (and others who might beinterested)
If you search the Huntington Archive for Krishna OR Krisna ( I did  
them separately but you can use boolean modifiers) you will get a  
total of 275 results for the name and a fair number of them are multi  
armed.
The archive is at:

Have fun
