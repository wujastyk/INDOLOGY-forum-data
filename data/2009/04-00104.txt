Zeitschriften der DMG digital
It looks the same to me, Jonathan.  And I haven't found an easy way to 
print out pages, even one-by-one (they're too big).  One has to sit and 
read on-screen, which rapidly becomes unbearable.
[If I've missed some crucial button, please tell me!]
While it is absolutely wonderful to have the ZDMG online, the project is 
unfortunately undermined by its limited implementation, and to such a 
degree that it is not as useful as one might at first have hoped.
This system has been designed "conservatively", i.e., more with a view to 
preventing copyright theft than with helping scholars do their research.
I hope that the policies may be revised in future to enable article-length 
pieces to be downloaded as PDF or djvu files and printed out for serious 
reading.
Best,
Dominik
