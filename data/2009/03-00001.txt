Subject: Krishna as Vishnu

Friends:

 

I am researching multi-arm images of Krishna.

 

It seems to be that at some point Krishna ceases to be an avatara and
becomes Vishnu himself.

 

A case in point is Jagganath Puri where Krishna is Jagganath, an appellation
reserved for Vishnu.

 

A Nepali stone image (?12 th century) that I recently saw shows Krishna with
8 arms holding even a Sudarshan chakra.

 

Am I on the right track? Any help would be appreciated.

 

Regards.
