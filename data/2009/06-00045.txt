A correction on my part. The 2.vol.set BHSD (Gr., Dict.) was priced at the equivalent of $20/- in 1999. My conjecture of the $ 50/- as the?current price may be have elements of over-invoicing. No mischief meant.

What about the Deccan College Dictionary?? ? Imagine having all the slips online, transcribed and digitized in searchable form with all the pandits' annotations included.? Last time I was in Pune the slips were still rotting in the scriptorium.? The publication is taking for ever, and the printed volumes don't include everything.? It would be a fantastic resource, and it would rescue the work of some brilliant scholars over many decades.? I heard there was some plan to scan the slips, not nearly as useful, but I suppose more realistic.? Does anyone know what the current state of the project is?
