yugas and colours
The colors in 3.148, mentioned by Harunaga, are:
Krta: white
Treta: red
Dvapara: yellow
Kali: black
But there is a different version in Mbh 3.187.31:
Krta: white
Treta: yellow
Dvapara: red
Kali: black
Where the colors for Treta and Dvapara are reversed.
I discuss this in my book /The Mahabharata and the Yugas/ (pp. 103, 
114-116).
