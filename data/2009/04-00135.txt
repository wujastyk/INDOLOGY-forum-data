ha.msa in parama-ha.msa and ha.msa-sa.mde/sa
Many thanks! The imagery of hamsa is of course Rgvedic. The sun too is in picture there. But I did not find hamsa as the binder of the material world and the divine one before the AV verse cited. There is an implied theoretical comprehension of two interdependent?worlds along with hamsa playing a unique role that makes the AV concept look theologically more developed.?

The first one describes in this way Indra identified with the sun; the
second one describes the horse DadhikrA'van identified with the sun and
Agni. In both cases 'swan' refers to the divine being who is in the sky
or in the space. At RV 10.124.9 the god is cognised by the seers, at RV
4.40.5 the horse remains within men (nr???d) which also implies
possibility of its cognition (if not its ontic presence within human
beings).
