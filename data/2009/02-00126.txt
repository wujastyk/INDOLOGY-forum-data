No disrespect for MW (and besides, the version we all use is not the  
one criticized by B and R, but one has been substantially revised by  
other scholars; the PW too is the fruit of collaboration of a  
considerable number of scholars), just an anecdote: I remember seeing  
once a word for ?woman? being glossed by ?women?s room? which is, of  
course, a direct mistranslation of Frauenzimmer.
Best,
Eli
