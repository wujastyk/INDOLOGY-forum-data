In addition to the two MBh references already noted, a variant with susukhaM bata jIvAmi (similar Stefan's UdAnavarga citation) for anantaM bata me vittam occurs at 12.268.4. I discuss the way the figure of Janaka is cast and used in a run of texts occurring at the end of the MokSadharmaparvan in the introduction to my translation of the SulabhAJanakasaMvAda in the Journal of Indian Philosophy 30.6 (December, 2002): 641-77. Janaka is frequently portrayed here as the paradigmatic karmayogin king, "in the world, but not of the world," and this extravagant verse is put in his mouth as an emblem of his detachment. Sulabha is depicted as giving the lie to his claims.

(I posted the above message yesterday afternoon, but it did not go through for technical reasons. Since I don't believe anyone has yet pointed out the third MBh reference, I repost it now. Jim)

In addition to the MBh and Uttarajjh?y? references provided by Professors Aklujkar and Tieken, the half?verse in question occurs in Ud?navarga 30.44:

   susukham bata j?v?mo   ye??? no n?sti ki?cana?
   mithil?y?? dahyam?n?y??   na no dahyati ki?cana?

and in Mah?vastu III 453.1?2:

   mithil?y?? dahyam?n?y??   n?sya dahyati ki?cana
   caturtha? khu bhadram adhanasya   an?g?rasya bhik?u?o

I happen to have a scan of the Roth article which I will send to Allen in separate email.

I wonder why Mithil? figures in this proverbial expression.

All best,
Stefan
