Dear Alexandra van der Geer,
Manohar Laxman Varadpande, Woman in Indian sculpture, p. 94
    http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/72992587
refers to a fifth?century sculpture from Uttar Pradesh (now in the Indian Museum, Kolkata) of a girl in a hurry with a scorpion on her thigh (unfortunately not clearly visible on his plate 44). There must be more.
Best wishes,
