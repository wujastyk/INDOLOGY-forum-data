I don't think it makes sense to oppose the need to read books (or 
journal) in German and the need to read books (or journals) in Tamil.

Take the case of somebody who is interested in Tamil epigraphy.

That person will probably have read Iravatham Mahadevan's book (/Early 
Tamil Epigraphy/, 2003,
Cre-A [Chennai] and Harvard Oriental Series 62), which is in English.

That person might be interested in reading Oskar von Hin?ber's 1986 book
/Das ?ltere Mittelindisch im ?berblick/, Wien,
which is in German,
because it makes sense to try to understand the languages with which 
Tamil was in contact.

That person might be a regular subscriber to the journal /?????/
[Avanam, Journal of the TamilNadu Archaeological Society, Thanjavur],
which is purely in Tamil,
because it is the most efficient way to be informed of new discoveries
in the field of Tamil epigraphy
and because it is edited by very competent scholars.

The more languages one knows, the better.
