text files to be used for chanted Sanskrit conjugations and              declensions available for proofreading
We have posted the text files (in Devanagari) that will be used to 
create the freely available mp3 audio files of Sanskrit conjugations and 
declensions for teaching purposes.
We hope to begin recording tomorrow. If anyone has time to take a look 
at them and see if we missed any typos, we'd be most grateful.
Because time is short, formatting is minimal and will be improved once 
the short recording window has closed.
Comments can be emailed directly to me at:

The files are at:
