Summary of the event
Param Pujya Munishri Jambuvijayji Maharaj Saheb, seven other monks, seven nuns
and I left Nakoda (Barmer District, Rajasthan (RJ)) for Jaisalmer (RJ) on 9
November 2009 on pilgrimage, when on the fourth day, the road accident  
occurred.
At 6:55 AM on 12 November 2009 on the Balotra-Barmer road, Muni Jambuvijayji
and three of his disciples were brutally hit by a speeding jeep from  
behind. At that
time, I was walking with the nuns at a distance of four kilometers  
ahead of the
monks. As soon as we heard of the accident, we rushed back and found  
four monks
lying in a pool of blood on the road. Munishri Jambuvijayji  
(eighty-seven years old)
and his disciple Namaskarvijayji (thirty-four years old) were already  
dead and cold.
Their bodies were cremated on 13 November 2009 in Shankheshvar (Patan  
District,
North Gujarat (GJ)).
Circumstances**
9 November:
Eight monks, seven nuns, one assistant, one driver and I started the  
pilgrimage
towards Jaisalmer from Nakoda (Barmer District, RJ). We walked about 15 km in
the morning and evening and stayed overnight at a school near Tilwala.
10 November:
We walked 15 km and stayed overnight at a school in a small village north of
Tilwala.
11 November:
We walked 15 km and stayed overnight at a school about 13 km east of Baitu on
the Balotra-Barmer Rd.
12 November:
5:30 AM
Jinendraprabhushriji, the other six nuns and I left the school for  
Baitu (Barmer
District, RJ).
6:30 AM
The eight monks left the school. Jambuvijayji led his group by taking  
the hands of
both Dharmagoshvijayji and Himavantvijayji. Namaskarvijayji followed  
these three
monks with a wheelchair in order to assist Jambuvijayji whenever  
necessary. The
1
other four monks walked slowly with an aged disciple Dharmachandravijayji, who
was using a wheelchair. An assistant and a driver, after cleaning up  
the rooms of
the school where the monks and the nuns stayed the previous night,  
followed the
monks, one by a bike and the other by a truck.
6:55 AM
According to Himavantvijayji, who was the only eyewitness, the four monks, who
were walking together on the left edge/side of the road, were hit by a  
speeding
Toyota Qualis from behind. Namaskarvijayji was killed instantly. At  
that time, the
car as well as the wheelchair, onto which Namaskarvijayji rolled, caused
Jambuvijayji to topple over Namaskarvijayji. Jambuvijayji?s head was  
hit very hard,
and his stomach and bones were crushed, but he still breathed unconsciously.
Dharmagoshvijayji, who was taking Jambuvijayji by the left hand, was knocked
unconscious and both his legs were crushed. Himavantvijayj, who was taking
Jambuvijayji by the right hand, was severely injured in the legs and  
unable to move,
but was screaming for help. The Toyota Qualis came to a stop about 50m away
from the scene after hitting them, and four of its passengers ran away  
into the
bushes.
7:00 AM
According to Himavantvijayji, Jambuvijayji stopped breathing. No aid  
was available.
7:10 AM
According to Pundarikaratnavijayji, Pundarikaratnavijayji and the  
other three monks,
who were one kilometer behind Jambuvijayji and the other three monks, reached
the scene of the accident by foot.
7:20 AM
A driver informed us that there was a serious accident in which some monks had
been crushed by a jeep, while others sustained serious injuries.  
Greatly shocked by
such tragic news, all of the nuns and I, who were approximately 4 km  
ahead of the
scene of the accident, rushed back to the scene almost running the entire way,
breathlessly. It was a horrible scene to see Munishri Jambuvijayji and
Namaskarvijayji lifeless and the old monk Dharmaghoshvijayji almost  
unconscious,
as he was dragged about five meters by the speeding car.
8:00 AM
The police came from Baitu, approximatley 12 km away (Barmer District, RJ). At
the same time, an ambulance car arrived from Balotra (Barmer District,  
RJ), some
35 km away. Only Dharmaghoshvijayji and Himavantvijayji were taken in an
ambulance to the hospital, and the dead bodies of Jambuvijayji and
Namaskarvijayji were taken to Nakoda by car. Since I had a camera, the police
asked me to take two photographs of Namaskarvijayji on the road and a
photograph of Jambuvijayji in the car.
8:30 AM
We reached a hospital in Balotra.

9:00 AM
The bodies of the deceased monks were kept uncovered for darshan for  
visitors and
devotees at the Nakoda Parshvanath Jain Derasar located 12 km away  
from Balotra.
There was a heated discussion that the bodies of these monks should be  
cremated
at Nakoda, since they were there for the entire rainy season (01.&+'!$1).
Nevertheless, various samgha leaders finally decided to take the dead  
bodies to
Shankheshvar where Munishri Bhuvanvijayji (Guru and Father of  
Jambuvijayji) was
cremated.
13 November:
1:00 AM
We left Nakoda for Shankheshvar by car and traveled about 350 kilometers.
7:00 AM
We reached the Agama Mandir in Shankheshvar, where the bodies were kept for
darshan.
3:30 PM
The bodies were set on separate palanquins (,!)1>"").
4:00 PM
The funeral march (13.#'16!.+1/,!)1>""6!.+1) proceeded towards a crematorium
($1'!/"#) 2 km away from the Agama Mandir via the Shankheshvar Parshvanath
Jain Derasar. Thousands of people from all corners of India were present.
5:00 PM
The cremations (1?3#$1!$>!+1) started.
9:30 PM
The cremations ended.
14 November:
Their bones were collected into small cans. Jambuvijayji's ashes were  
divided into
hundreds of packages for gifts for the condolers.
18 November:
The Tapagaccha Jain order, to which Jambuvijayji belonged, held a Requiem Mass
(?&"!3&9!/1% $1'("!). At the mass, the chief monk of the Tapagaccha
(.1,!?100"!/"#,1.#%!0!+61) accused the Anoop Mandal of the accident.
