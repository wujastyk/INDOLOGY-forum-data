I confess that it occured to me only too late of course to check Sircar
first of all--rather stupid, sorry!

But the context itself as well as othe reference cited by Stefan make me
strongly suspect that the answer should be sought elsewhere (that is, I
don't think we should be disposed to take deva as = deva). A graphic error
is hardly possible, I should think; is there a phonological explanation?
Again, I apologize but our library is closed until next week...

many thanks jonathan
