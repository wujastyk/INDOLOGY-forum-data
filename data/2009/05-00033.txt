Unusual word - help needed
Can anyone help me with the form of ?tasthu????m from Vedanta Deshika's
Hamsasandesham 1.20?  The verse and translation are below and I've added the
glosses that two commentaries give:
ik?u-cch?ye kisalaya-maya? talpam ?tasthu?????
sa?l?pais tair mudita-manas?? ??li-sa?rak?ik???m |
kar????-?ndhra-vyatikara-va??t karbure g?ti-bhede
muhyant?n?? madana-kalu?a? maugdhyam ?sv?dayeth??
*Relish the simplicity, stirred up by love, of the girls who guard the rice.
They revel at heart in all sorts of gossip as they sit in the shade of the
sugarcane using sprouting shoots as seats, forgetting themselves entirely in
the strangely blended songs formed from a mix of the **Kar???ak** and **
?ndhra** tongues.*
One commentary glosses '??rit?n??' and another '?sthitavat?n?m'.
Thank you very much,
Venetia Ansell
