signature verses and cikacika?
Thank you Ashok, Madhav, Vincent and Dipak for most useful comments  
and references.
I may add perhaps that unlike in the other sources mentioned, the word  
is not used in the PVA in the context of error, but in a context where  
one argues about the coordination between qualities: when something  
changes the quality of touch (becoming soft--mas.r.na), its color  
changes too (its caikacikya, etc., changes).
The passage without reference in Apte to the Vedaantapribhaa.sa is  
quoted in Nyaayakosa (there too without a reference).
Best wishes,
Eli
