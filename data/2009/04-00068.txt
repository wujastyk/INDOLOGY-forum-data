questions on Prakrit
...Can someone recommend a convenient guide to Prakrit
prosody, similar to the appendix on Skt prosody in
Apte's dictionary?
Dear Matthew and All,
I haven't looked at this in quite a while, but worth looking at is:
R. Pischel, *Comparative Grammar of the Prakrit Languages* Translation of the German by S. Jha, second ed. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1965). (German original: Gramatik der Prakrit-Sprachen, Strassburg, 1900).
Best Wishes,
Brad
