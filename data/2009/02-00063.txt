AW: Macdonell and Whitney Grammars [DjVu format at Internet              Archive]
There is so much to learn here, though not necessarily with regard to the
original question. I still have to figure out what recommends the "Internet
Archive" DjVU image files and their unusable "Full Text" alternatives, when
there is a GRETIL e-book with a fully searchable background text,
standardized diacritics (Whitney) in accented and unaccented versions
(Whitney's "Roots"), bookmarks for navigation, etc.
This brings me back to the original question:
"Does anyone on the list have information on the availability of ETEXTS" of
the said works, other than these?

and enter "Whitney", "Macdonell", etc.,
or click the "All titles" button in the left frame.]
