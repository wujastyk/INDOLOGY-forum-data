Actually I think you'll find that there is a dual number in Homeric 
Greek, but as an alternative, not compulsory as the Sanskrit dual is. 
(I have no Homeric grammar to hand at present to check this.) It also 
has a locative (on place names) and other familiar features.
Many languages have a strongly artificial element to them, but they 
don't always stay artificial. A case in point is Italian, which as I 
understand it was originally a language of literature and culture 
(developed from the Tuscan dialect), in the days when, in daily life, 
the Italian people spoke a number of widely different dialects. Here 
too there is (or was until recently) a slow rate of linguistic 
change: I am told that a modern Italian can still sit down and read 
Dante (1265-1321) with the aid of a few notes, whereas the modern 
English speaker needs a course in Middle English (or a translation) 
to tackle Chaucer (around a hundred years later).
