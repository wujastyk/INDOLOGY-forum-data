What Devanagari text would you most like as an e-text
Tantravarttika by Kumarila Bhatta.
All available comms, on Yogasutras.
But, Jonathan and others are right, we do need a single list of what's out there.

In the last decade or two, a substantial amount of Sanskrit literature has
become available in e-text form.  Veda, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Mahabhasya,
Astadhyayi, Kasika, Puranas, many Tantras, dharmasastra and jyotisa texts,
Buddhist literature, much else.
What next?  What text is there in Devanagari script that hasn't been input
yet, and that you would dearly like to have as an e-text?  I wonder if we
can put together a prioritized list?
Best,
