Indus script
George,
the "rhetoric" is due to the fact that the archaeologists etc.  
involved have spent much of their lives and careers(!) on this topic.
A scientific theory should be just that -- and should be objected to  
stringent counterchecks and falsification.
Another important point is that many cannot imagine a highly  
developed civilization as existing without a script that represents  
spoken language (such as sentences).
Well, what about the Inca/Moche etc., or Mexican Highland ones? Or  
closer to home, the Bactria-Margiana (Oxus) and E. Iranian Jiroft  
ones?  I still have to meet someone to deny "high status" to the Inca  
civilization.
In short: built in, pathway dependent views of the 20th century.
Cheers!
Michael
