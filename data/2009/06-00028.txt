What about the Deccan College Dictionary?    Imagine having all the  
slips online, transcribed and digitized in searchable form with all  
the pandits' annotations included.  Last time I was in Pune the slips  
were still rotting in the scriptorium.  The publication is taking for  
ever, and the printed volumes don't include everything.  It would be  
a fantastic resource, and it would rescue the work of some brilliant  
scholars over many decades.  I heard there was some plan to scan the  
slips, not nearly as useful, but I suppose more realistic.  Does  
anyone know what the current state of the project is?
