Durva, scientific name Cynodon dactylon, is commonly known in English-speaking countries as Bermuda grass (although it appears sometimes other Cynodons are thrown in with it).  It is common both as a cultivated lawn grass and an escapee and agricultural weed.  Interestingly, some of the online sources describe it as "gray-green."  But to judge from the numerous pictures that appear when one searches "Bermuda grass" on Google Images, the grayish tinge appears when it is growing in dry circumstances; the images showing it lush and well watered and fertilized (e.g. for turf) show it a vigorous and fairly dark green right in the middle spectrum of what Anglophones would call green, with no leaning towards the yellow or blue.  I don't see any quite as dark as in the image Joanna linked to.  But I suspect the Indians would probably think of its archetypal and typical color as the one it wears during the monsoon.

Here you can see a photo of durva grass:

It is (by our naming) "green". One of the problems with colors is
that black, blue and green often are conflated in the same term.
Or "dark" might mean green. 
And in some areas green and yellow share the same term.
So here, I'd guess (in terms of the way 'we" perceive color),
dvapara would be green, not 
"black as durva grass".
