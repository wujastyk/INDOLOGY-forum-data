majority in Hindu law
Allen,
As always, Ludo Rocher has an article on this issue, "The Status of 
Minors according to Classical Hindu Law," Recueils de la Societe Jean 
Bodin 35 (L'Enfant) (1975) 377-393.  So far as I know, the standard age 
for majority is sixteen, as attested in several texts.  Before that, the 
term used is baala; after sixteen one becomes vyavahaarajna (or some 
synonym).  The main legal issue, of course, is the capacity to make 
valid contracts, but minority also comes with restricted criminal 
liability and additional protections for the minors' property and person. 
Independence of the son in terms of residence or occupation is, to my 
knowledge, not a big issue for the Dharmasastra.  All bets are off when 
it comes to law in practice, however, as you suggest.  The ways in which 
regionalized communities accepted or rejected partitions of joint family 
property was staggeringly diverse.  Our knowledge of this diversity, as 
in so many areas of Indian law, is almost all recent and observed during 
colonialism.
