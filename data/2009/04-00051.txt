This is very interesting indeed.  The classical ?yurvedic text of V?gbha?a 
and other older texts talk about six causes (3 humours, humoral 
conjunction, anguish, poison) leading to damage of the tubes that carry 
manas and thus unm?da.  Uttaratantra, adhy?ya 6:

unm?d?? ?a? p?thagdo?anicay?dhivi?odbhav??
unm?do n?ma manaso do?air unm?rgagair mada? 1

??r?ram?nasair du??air ahit?d annap?nata?
vik?t?s?tmyasamal?d vi?am?d upayogata? 2

vi?a??asy?lpasattvasya vy?dhivegasamudgam?t
k???asya ce???vai?amy?t p?jyap?j?vyatikram?t 3

?dhibhi?cittavibhra???d vi?e?opavi?e?a ca
ebhir hi h?nasattvasya h?di do??? prad??it?? 4

dhiyo vidh?ya k?lu?ya? hatv? m?rg?n manovah?n
unm?da? kurvate tena dh?vij??nasm?tibhram?t 5
