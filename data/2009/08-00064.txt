Macintosh computers running the latest software (with full 
"International" configuration) are fully capable of rendering Unicode 
Devanagari characters via several keyboards.  As long as the default 
fonts are installed, you just need to enable the keyboard(s) by going 
to "System Preferences" --> "International" --> "Input Methods" and 
selecting ("checking") one or more Devanagari keyboards.

You then just need a word-processing software that is 
Unicode-compliant (FYI, Microsoft Word is *NOT*), such as Apple's 
"Pages" or "TextEdit", or some free editors such as "Bean".
