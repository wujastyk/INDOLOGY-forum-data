resending question on chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions and              conjugations?
Sorry about the bad formatting. Yahoo Mail has been acting up lately.
I was thinking of working with a pandit to create some mp3 files with 
chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions and conjugations for teaching 
purposes. They would be made freely available on the internet. I haven't 
yet found anything quite right for that purpose.
Has this already been done somewhere?
Best,
