Subject: Durga with a violin

Although I feel a bit hesitant to venture into the field of higher Indology, is it possible that the violin is simply a Western interpretation of an Indian ritual sword, much like the ones Kali is carrying. The curves of the blade of the sword could perhaps be misconstrued as having the shape of a distorted violin. It is also obvious that the seventeenth century Western observers did not know what they were looking at and tried to interpret forms in their own visual idiom. The hindu Gods look a bit Greekish in their representation. Hence the violin (which is originally a Middle-eastern instrument anyway).

In Lebedev's book the image was presented and discribed in details as  Durga's.  Have you any idea how to get access to the original picture?

This illustration appeared there as a wood-engraving and has been reproduced also by Partha Mitter in his "Much Maligned Monster" (Oxford: Clarendon press, 1977, fig. 28 p. 65 & see pp. 57-59 & 64). It is there evident that there is no violin in the hands of the god, but an object which looks like a bottle (which also does not make much sense). Apparently, the engraving included in the PDF document to which you refer copied the original by Baldaeus (reversing left and right and misunderstanding the god's attributes - but Baldaeus himself did not understand all of them !).
