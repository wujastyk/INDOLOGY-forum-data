Durga with a violin
Although I feel a bit hesitant to venture into the field of higher Indology, is it possible that the violin is simply a Western interpretation of an Indian ritual sword, much like the ones Kali is carrying. The curves of the blade of the sword could perhaps be misconstrued as having the shape of a distorted violin. It is also obvious that the seventeenth century Western observers did not know what they were looking at and tried to interpret forms in their own visual idiom. The hindu Gods look a bit Greekish in their representation. Hence the violin (which is originally a Middle-eastern instrument anyway).
