Dear Colleagues,
I am happy to announce the publication of the book entitled "Indian Philosophy. An Encyclopedia" 
in the Publishing House "Vostochnaya Literatura", Ed. Marietta Stepanyants,Moscow, 2009. 950p. 
Please, have a look at http://www.vostlit.ru/KartNotSerial/kart268f.htm 
The Encyclopedia is the result of the collective efforts of Russian Scholars from Moscow, S.Petersboug and Ulan-Ude. It was designed and prepared for publication at the Institute of Phisosophy, Russian Academy of sciences. 
I was quite upset to discover some rather annoying misprints especiaally in diacritics, but taking in account that we were extremely restrained by the delay allowed by our sponsor, there  was no time left for a meticulous proof-reading.
Victoria Lysenko,
