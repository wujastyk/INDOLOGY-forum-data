MithilAyAM tu daghdhAyAm
In addition to the MBh and Uttarajjh?y? references provided by
Professors Aklujkar and Tieken, the half?verse in question occurs
in Ud?navarga 30.44:
   susukham bata j?v?mo   ye??? no n?sti ki?cana?
   mithil?y?? dahyam?n?y??   na no dahyati ki?cana?
and in Mah?vastu III 453.1?2:
   mithil?y?? dahyam?n?y??   n?sya dahyati ki?cana
   caturtha? khu bhadram adhanasya   an?g?rasya bhik?u?o
I happen to have a scan of the Roth article which I will send to
Allen in separate email.
I wonder why Mithil? figures in this proverbial expression.
All best,
