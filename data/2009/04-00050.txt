mana in heart or head?
A useful, but perhaps not so well known publication pertaining to this  
question is:
Ernst Windisch, "?ber den Sitz der denkenden Seele, besonders bei den  
Indern und Griechen, und eine Etymologie von gr. ????????  
[prapi?des]", in: Berichte ?ber die Verhandlungen der k?niglich- 
s?chsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Leipzip, Phil.-hist.  
Classe, 43 (1891) 157-203.
Of the places discussed by Windisch, two that might point to a certain  
association of head (though not brain) and mental functions may be of  
special interest here:
1. In RV II 16,2 it is said of Indra: ha?ste va?jra? bha?rati  
??r?a??i kra?tum, where most translators (but not Windisch  
himself) understand kra?tu as "wisdom" or the like.
2. Sometimes the five pr??as (= indriy??i) are located in the  
head, and that includes also manas. One of the earliest instances  
seems to be ?Br IX 2,2,5: pa?cadh?vihito v? 'ya? ??r?an  
pr??o mano v?k pr??a? cak?u? ?rotram (quoted after  
Windisch, without accents).
I have the impression that the reason for the location of kratu and  
manas in the head is their link to speech, which is necessarily  
located there, but this would have to be verified.
Best wishes,
Sven Sellmer
