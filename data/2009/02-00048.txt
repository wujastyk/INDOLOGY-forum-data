FONTS> Upgraded IndUni fonts
Dear Readers,
John Smith's recently updated font collection will be of interest to
some of you.
IndUni fonts
[snip]
I have recently created upgraded versions of my "IndUni" OpenType
fonts. These are Unicode-compliant fonts that contain a comprehensive
set of "Indological" characters, as well as all the European
characters
that scholars are likely to need. They are available as freeware, and
include high-quality lookalikes for Times, Palatino, New Century
Schoolbook, Helvetica and Courier. They are based on the freeware fonts
so generously contributed by URW++ of Germany.
The upgraded fonts now contain all the accented characters specified by
MES-1, the smallest of the recognised Multilingual European Subsets of
Unicode. They also contain numerous other accented forms that linguists
tend to require (e.g. vowels with both macron and breve, vowels with
both macron and tilde), all the accented characters needed for Pinyin,
and a set of Cyrillic characters. This is, of course, in addition to
all the characters known to be used in representing Indian languages in
Roman script.
As well as a greatly enhanced character set, the new versions of the
fonts have had various small bugs fixed, and have been set up to work
with both "composed" and "decomposed" forms of complex
characters --
e.g. the form for "a macron" will be used whether the document
contains
the one character U+0101 ("a macron") or the two characters U+0061
("a") + U+0304 ("macron"). Since there seems to be
something of a shift
in usage under way here, this is a major advantage.
The fonts can be downloaded from http://bombay.indology.info/.
