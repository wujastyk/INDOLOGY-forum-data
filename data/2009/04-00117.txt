To complicate matters, I have found that a number of Buddhist texts prefer 
to use the simile of the saarasa ~ also a type of goose ~ in basically the 
same context.  I wonder if the ha.msa was avoided deliberately. The imagery 
with the saarasa seems to be connected with this powerful migratory bird 
flying upwards into the sky and away, especially after it has hatched and 
nurtured its offspring.

Best wishes,
