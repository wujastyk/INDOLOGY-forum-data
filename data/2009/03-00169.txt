Translations into Sanskrit
Dear Colleagues,
lately I was asked about early translations into Sanskrit and noticed that this is quite an interesting question I know little about. Is anybody aware of articles or books on this topic? In particular, I would be curious to learn about the earliest translations into Sanskrit of texts originally composed in languages others than Middle Indo-Aryan ones (as only these I would consider translations in the full sense).
Best wishes,
Sven Sellmer
