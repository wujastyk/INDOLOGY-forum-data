STIMW offers a forum for the discussion of papers on varied aspects 
of Indian religions. Papers have been presented by leading scholars 
in the field as well as by research students.  Papers are sent to 
participants in advance, so that they can be read and discussed in 
detail.  They are available to those who cannot attend for a small 
charge.

Please note that this year there will also be a seminar on 
Indo-European/Indo-Aryan matters in Manchester on Thurs 27 May, so 
you might like to consider coming to both.
