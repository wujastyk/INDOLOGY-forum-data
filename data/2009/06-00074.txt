small qerry on OOA theory and Indo-european languages
Dear Veeranarayana,
Are you referring to THE out-of-Africa theory versus the multiregional 
model??? In that case, your comma moved somewhat, because the first theory 
developed to explain the rise/evolution of Homo sapiens from Homo erectus at 
about 1.8 million years ago, far far far before something like an 
Indo-European language arose.
