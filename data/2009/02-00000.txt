Dear Indologists,
 
I seem to remember reading long time ago a book on Jaffna history that the  
Jaffna kingdom was founded by Ariyac Cakkaravartti, a Tamil brahmin general
of  
the Pandiyan king and that as a result Jaffna Tamil kings used to marry  
brahmin women from Ramesvaram. I do not remember if it was the book by  
Arasaratnam or Padmanathan. Does anybody have the reference?
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Regards,
Palaniappan
