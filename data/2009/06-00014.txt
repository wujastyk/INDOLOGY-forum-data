Dear Stephen,

> notes in them seem to be all above the word / phrase.

yes, that is correct. Additions are generally made above the line
they belong to, sometimes with a little mark indicating the
insertion point, but more often not. In that case it can be a
little unclear which ak?aras precisely an insertion is meant to go
between, but in general an effort is made to align the right edge
of the insertion (i.e., its beginning, the general writing
direction being from right to left) with the insertion point. In a
few exceptional cases corrections are made in a way that could be
called below the line, but since all of these latter ones are very
short (often only one ak?ara) it may be better to think of them as
anchored to an individual ak?ara rather than the line.

Cheers,
Stefan
