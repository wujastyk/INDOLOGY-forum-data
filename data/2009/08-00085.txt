QUERY> Identifying Pandita Manaviharala (Kragh)
I apologize that I am stepping beyond my expertise. The little Tibetan  
I had is now almost gone. However, I googled manavihara and came up  
with a number of hits. One is a pdf file of several pages from Sylvain  
Levi's Le N?pal in Ted Riccardi's translation (http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ancientnepal/pdf/ancient_nepal_105_02.pd 
f). According to this document, Manavihara is another name for  
Cakravihara in Patan.
