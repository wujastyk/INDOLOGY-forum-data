Dear Dom,

1. Thanks for the epilepsy info, you rascal.  An Ayurvedic
remedy for jet lag would really have been helpful.

2. Today I got an email from Cordelia saying she has become a
bass player, with a photo of her and her electric bass.

3. Am I on IndComm duty this week?  I thought it was last week.  

See you around,
Gary.
