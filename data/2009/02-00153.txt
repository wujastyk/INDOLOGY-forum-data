signature verses
I seem to recall having read somewhere something about the ways in which
poets encode their names in verses. In particular, I am interested in the
case of Buddhist authors "signing" their works in, typically, a closing
verse. (I think I recall an example from Candrak?rti....?) I'm pretty sure
I've read something about this, but can't for the life of me remember more
than that...
thanks in advance for the help!  jonathan
