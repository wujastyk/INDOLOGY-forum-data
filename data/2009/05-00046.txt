First publication of a group of thirty documents 
on leather in Imperial Aramaic, dating to the 
fourth century B.C.E. and reflecting the practice 
of the Achaemenian administration in Bactria and 
Sogdiana. Eighteen inscribed wooden sticks, for 
use as tallies, dated to the third year of King 
Darius Ill, are also included. They are 
considered to be the second most important 
discovery of its type known.
Two of the leather documents relate to the fall 
of the Persian Empire: one mentions Bessus, the 
usurper of the Persian throne, travelling to 
Warnu (Greek Aornos); the other is a long list of 
supplies in the year 7 of King Alexander. In 
addition to their valuable historical contents, 
the documents enrich our knowledge of Aramaic and 
its lexicon. The documents are given in Aramaic 
with translation, introduction, commentary and 
glossary. The volume is lavishly illustrated.
