Brill?s Studies in South and Southwest Asian Languages
ISSN 1877-4083
Brill?s Studies in South and Southwest Asian Languages (BSSAL) is a new
peer-reviewed series that provides a venue for high-quality
monograph-length descriptive and theoretical studies on the languages of
South and Southwest Asia. In the political sense, South Asia encompasses
the seven independent states Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, but linguistically and culturally it also
includes some adjacent areas to the east and north, notably Tibet.
Southwest Asia is understood here as comprising the Iranian language
speaking territory to the west of South Asia, i.e., the states of
Afghanistan and Iran and the geocultural transnational region Kurdistan,
consisting of parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The languages - ancient and modern - of South and Southwest Asia have
played a central role in linguistics from the field?s very beginnings as a
modern scientific endeavor, and continue to occupy a central position in
discussions in many linguistic subdisciplines, such as phonology,
morphology, syntax, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, typology,
writing systems, and areal studies, to name just a few. The series seeks
high-quality, state-of-the-art contributions on all aspects of the
languages of this linguistically diverse and fascinating area. It will be
of interest to general linguists, indologists, and specialists in Iranian
studies.
