What Devanagari text would you most like as an e-text
To Patrick's suggestions, I would add Mitramisra's Viramitrodaya.

Re: What Devanagari text would you most like as an e-text
I would be very interested in getting two classes of texts: the 
philosophical commentaries, e.g. Sankara on the Brahmasutras, etc., 
and second, the major commentaries and nibandhas of the Dharmasastric 
genre from the early medieval period -- e.g. Mitaksara of 
Vijanesvara, Smriticandrika of Devannabhatta, or even the voluminous 
Krityakalpataru of Laksmidhara.
