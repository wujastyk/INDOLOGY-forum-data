pramanas
Dear All,
thanks to all who commented on the pramanas till now.
The terms are in Pali (I only gave the Skt. terms for convenience),  
the expression is paccakkh?num?nasaddatth?pattippabhedassa  
pam??acatukass?paricc?g?, and it is to be found in Vajirabuddhi| 
s Vajirabuddhi??k? (Cha??hasa?g?yana edition 3,22-23), i.e.  
in an undated  subcommentary on the Vinaya.
	Vajirabuddhi here comments on the expression catukkam aparicc?g?,  
which forms part of a verse given by him in the very beginning of the  
text, and characterizing a vatt? (vakt?). In Pali this verse to my  
knowledge is documented only a second time in the 9th century  
Mah?niddesa-A??hakath?, and only these two texts comment on it.  
The Vajirabuddhi??k? gives three explanations, one of wich is the  
pram??a-tetrad. The Nidd-a has two identical explanations, only the  
pram??a-tetrad is missing.
The mentioning of four pram??as is certainely conditioned by the  
catukka? of the verse. However, I thought it highly unlikely that  
the author invented this list, and I hoped it would throw some light  
on his background and perhaps time (between 9th and 12th century),  
who possibly enjoyed a Sanskrit education, perhaps in South India.
