Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I am happy to announce Vol. 11/1 of the new *Journal of South Asia Women 
Studies* (established in 1995) http://asiatica.org/

In this issue:

Note from the Editor: The New Political Scenario in Nepal and in 
             Afghanistan and The Fairy Tale of the ?Good Taliban?
Paper: "Female Rishis and Philosophers in the Veda?", by Michael Witzel
Book Reviews

Summary of "Female Rishis and Philosophers in the Veda?"

It is a traditional but common misconception that a considerable number 
of ?gvedic hymns were composed by women. Though female authors and 
interlocutors are not entirely absent from the Vedas, the role of 
'literate' women in the ?gveda will have to be re-evaluated. The 
traditional names given for female ?gvedic authors include those derived 
from the wordings of the hymns but also personified Belief, Speech and a 
bitch.


Enjoy it!


Dr Enrica Garzilli
Editor-in-Chief
