TimesIndian on the Mac -- new keyboard driver
Some on this list may use TimesIndian, a system for writing Indian  
diacriticals for the Mac that I developed many years ago.   
Unfortunately, the keyboard driver, which was developed on OS 9 and  
has worked until now, is broken in Snow Leopard.  I have a new driver  
(to be put in /Library/Keyboard Layouts) that works under SL.  If  
anyone needs it, send me an email (glhart at berkeley.edu).  George Hart
