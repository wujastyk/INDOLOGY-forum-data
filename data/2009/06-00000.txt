I shudder to send out the same query twice, but
as there were no takers first time around, I
thought to try again:

Does anyone have any information regarding what became
of Prof. A. K. Chatterjee, a specialist on Buddhist
Yogacara philosophy, following his retirement from
Benares Hindu University about two decades ago?
