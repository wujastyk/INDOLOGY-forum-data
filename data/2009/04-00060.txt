Dear colleague, I'm glad I was able to help.  I regret, however, that I am unable to give you any detailed information concerning the geographical distribution of the kaapya and kaapeya descendants.  I know that both the derivates occur in passages of early Upani.sads (B.rhadaara.nyaka, Chaandogya), and I'll check as soon as I can and get back to you.  If I recall correctly, though, I don't think these inform us definitively about geographical distribution.  All the more disappointing in view of what you say about the Tamil Nadu situation!  Sorry not to be able to help more.  By the way, Agrawal's is not a real book but merely a small pamphlet with materials extracted from his larger work (India as known to Paa.nini).  It may be that you cannot obtain the pamphlet.  If you wish, I can easily make a xerographic copy and send it to you by mail.  With best wishes, George Cardona
