yugas and colours
Dear George,
I suppose this is a /lapsus calami/
and you meant "CE" (and not "BC").
Zvelebil, in his /Lexicon of Tamil Literature/ [1995:528], summarizing 
discussions on the date of Parip??al,
writes:
"Prob. date between latter half of 4th and first half of the 6th c."
Best wishes
