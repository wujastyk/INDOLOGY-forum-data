My sincere thanks to everyone that sent me the references I needed!

The online version of Therigatha (http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ 
tipitaka/kn/thig/index.html) is amazing! It provided instant  
confirmation of what I've been wondering about for decades!

These references confirmed my thoughts about the demeanor of Buddhist  
nuns -- that they shaved their head, they did not wear any ornaments  
to adorn themselves, and so on.

Thanks and regards,
Rajam
