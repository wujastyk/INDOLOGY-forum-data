Thanks! (Re: Need references for descriptions of Buddhist nuns in              literature )
My sincere thanks to everyone that sent me the references I needed!
The online version of Therigatha (http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ 
tipitaka/kn/thig/index.html) is amazing! It provided instant  
confirmation of what I've been wondering about for decades!
These references confirmed my thoughts about the demeanor of Buddhist  
nuns -- that they shaved their head, they did not wear any ornaments  
to adorn themselves, and so on.
Thanks and regards,
Rajam
