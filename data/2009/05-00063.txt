Sardulavikridita metrics
Dear Indology list members,
   Is there more to know about the ??rd?lavikr??ita meter than ma- 
sa-ja-sa-ta-ta-ga (12-7 x 4 lines)?  Are any vipulas allowed?  In a  
manuscript I am working on I have a verse with 5 lines in  
??rd?lavikr??ita.  Is this common? (I have never seen it before)   
If there is a resource with extended discussion of this meter can you  
direct me to it?
Sincerely,
