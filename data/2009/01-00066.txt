Surinam Hindustani pubs. (Was: Gita)
The Hindu broadcast OHM publishes a magazine every three months announcing
their programmes. Some of the writing in the magazine called OHM Vani is in
Devanagari and in Hindi. Sarnami is not much used anymore in writing. There
is a Sarnami grammar book published by my old friend Motilal Marhe and an
exercisebook for Sarnami by Theo Damsteegt and another Surinamese person
whose name at this moment slipped my memory. Then there is the poetess
Chitra Gajadin who writes in Sarnami and there is a book of poetry in
Sarnami brought out by Rajendra Ramdas. I could try to get the
bibliographical data on them.

Anna and Victor,
Do either of you know, or know who would know, whether there is much
publishing in Surinam Hindustani (Sarnami) in the Netherlands, and where to
acquire it?
Thanks,
Allen
