Dear Mark,

> guides to students on using the print versions of Sanskrit
> dictionaries (MW, Apte, Macdonell, etc.) ... (order of entries,
> limitations, etc.)

I wrote a term paper on this in G?ttingen ca. 1995. If you don?t
have it yet I can send you a copy. The paper is in German.

All best,
Stefan
