Subject: first reference to Durga; first reference to sindur
Message-ID: <161227084999.23782.12260238932137338353.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

(1) Durga

Wondering about the earliest references for two things:

(1) Durga

(2) the use of sindur, particularly as used in the hair parting by married women
