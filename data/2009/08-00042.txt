No, I'm afraid I haven't heard of Modana modaka.  Wouldn't that just be a 
sweet?  What is the evidence for it being cannabis or an opiate?  (Very 
different substances?) Are the effects described, especially heightened 
appetite?  Is the plant described?  Are the distinct male and female 
plants of cannabis distinguished (as in the Anandakanda, for instance).
