I can testify that there is an enormous scholarly literature in Tamil that is
important for Indological studies -- and that it is in no way inferior in
quality or learning to what is in German or English. The same is true of
Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu -- and I suspect of the major North Indian
languages.
I would be interested to hear where any of the topics covered in Oskar von
Hin?ber's "Kleine Schriften" are treated in these languages.
If a student came to me and asked whether she should learn French, German,
Tamil or Telugu, (...)
I take it from George Hart's words that not too many students come to him to
ask his advice in these matters.
