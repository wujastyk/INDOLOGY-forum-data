yugas and colours
01.11.09
Thanks for the correction! I am extremely sorry for the inadvertent posting. I could consult Mitchiner's Introduction only this morning.
The origin of the idea .still, remains worth investigating. Referring to the?Mahabharata, i think, is still risky barring where it agrees with the later Vedic texts.?The Vishnudharmottara may be better. It belongs to the extreme north, perhaps.??Does the striking similarity between?Trika and the views of the Siddhantins of the South speak of good connectivity? 
Best

Re: yugas and colours
But Mitchiner dates the Yuga Purana to the 1st century BCE, not the 5th 
century CE. Pingree dates it to the same century as Mitchiner, or 
possibly to the following one.
