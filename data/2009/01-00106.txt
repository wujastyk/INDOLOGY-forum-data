While we are pondering the question of invertebrates in South Asian 
art, it occurrs to me that I've never actually seen a representation 
of a conch--the creature itself, as distinct from its empty shell. 
The nearest I've seen is in paintings of the Conch-demon slain by 
Visnu: he is shown as a human figure emerging from a conch-shell 
where the animal would be.
