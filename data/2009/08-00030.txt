Sri Lankan Ayurveda
This is very useful and encourages me to put a question. A student of mine working on Atharvavedic herbal plants says that he has some evidence for the currency of opium or a drug producing similar effects in the Atharvaveda. That, he thinks, was not marijuana. The existing theory is that opium was introduced in India much later. Is there any study or theory that opium was developed independently in India? I will see to it that any?information given to us on this is gratefully acknowledged?.

Re: Sri Lankan Ayurveda
Jan Meulenbeld's monumental "A History of Indian Medical Literature" in 5 
vols (1999-2002) is the bible in this field.
The publications of Jinadasa Liyanaratne address Sri Lankan ayurveda 
specifically, and are excellent.
Meulenbeld's Annotated Bibliography of Indian Medicine (ABIM) is 
comprehensive, up-to-date, and keyword-searchable.? See:
