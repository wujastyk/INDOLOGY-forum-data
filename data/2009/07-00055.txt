Books about Narada
I had to review the following book: Loving God: Krishna and Christ: A
Christian Commentary on the Narada Sutras, by Daniel Sheridan, Leuven:
Peeters and Dudley MA: W.B.Eerdmans, 2007, ISBN 9789042919778 and ISBN
9780802862822. This book contains an annotated translation of the Narada
Bhakti Sutras, a medieval Sutra text on the practice and the theology of
Bhakti, a text attributed to Narada Muni. There are, as far as I remember,
episodes in the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana on Narada. One can
consult also Wendy Doniger (o'Flaherty) 'Hindu Myths' Penguin Classic, which
has episodes with narratives on Narada or in which Narada figures.

Books about Narada
I have a friend who wants to write about Narada (Naradamuni, the  
mythological figure) -- does anyone know of any books in English,  
Tamil or Telugu on this subject?  He is particularly interested in  
stories, anecdotes and the like.  Thanks. George Hart
