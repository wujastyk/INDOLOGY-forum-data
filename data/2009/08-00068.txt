14th WSC - Website updated--Apologies
Dear Colleagues,
I apologise for sending this message to the Indology list.
This must be only to reply Prof. Eli Franco's question, 
but I am receiving recently same questions several times. 
So I would like to reply concerning Equipment of the
14th World Sanskrit Conference in this opportunity.
Each lecture room is equipped with PC, a (power point)
projecter, a screen and microphones. And our students helpers
can help the speaker during his presentation.
Photocopying can be purchased at the Copy Shop in 
the basement of the Clock Tower at a cost of 10 yen
per page.
Yours,
Akihiko Akamatsu
