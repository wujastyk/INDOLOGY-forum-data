MBh. 22.54.22 says: azvAMs tittiri-kalmASAn gandharvAn ... dadau  
CitrarathaH...
It seems to be that tittiri, kalmASa and gandharva could refer to  
different breeds/kinds of horses. Renou understood it that way  
(Anthologie sanscrite),
but he gives no reference to support this.
Nakula's AzvaZAstra (Thanjavur Sarasvati Mahal Series No. 56)  has no  
reference to breeds of horses either as far as I can discover.
So where can one find a clarification? Many thanks!
