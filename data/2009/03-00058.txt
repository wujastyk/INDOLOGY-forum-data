Language barriers --- financial barriers
The INDOLOGY forum has no moderator.  Once you are a member of this list, 
you are free to post what you like, and your message is not intercepted or 
edited before it goes out in general circulation.
When you join this forum, however, you *are* asked to read and then abide 
by the rules of the list, which are posted on the website.  See
   http://indology.info
and click on the right, "Scope and Guidelines".
See also "RFC 1855", also on the right, for general rules of Netiquette 
that apply to all internet usage.
The INDOLOGY committee's function is primarily to examine the CVs of 
scholars who apply for membership and to vote on admittance.  We are very 
reluctant to intervene in any matters beyond this.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee member on duty this week.
