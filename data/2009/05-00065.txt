It is also important to note that there seems to be a strong tendency for placement of a ceasura after the fourth ga?a.
The ma?gala in ?r?dhara's Karmapa?jik?, whose critical edition is currently being prepared by Dr. S. Sumant (Pune) and myself, also presents an unexpected number of ??rd?lavikr??ita p?das: just two of them, whereafter the verse-form seems to become something that is meant to be Sragdhar?. I would be grateful references to similarly (un)structured ma?galas. I paste below the text of ?r?dhara's ma?gala as we currently suppose it must be edited.
Best greetings,
Arlo Griffiths
