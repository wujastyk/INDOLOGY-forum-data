underwater hell or otherworld
I see to remember stories  in the Yogavasistha of transitions to other places via entering water, but that these were to other, distant parts of the earthly world, and to alternative lives and times (on the Rip Van Winkle model), rather than to hells or other underworlds.  Perhaps Walter Slaje could comment.
