EJVS Laurasian academy?
Dear List,
I have been trying to download articles recently from EJVS, but I get 
transferred to some website called the Laurasian Academy instead.  It 
appears to be some online "academy,"  with no obvious connection to 
EJVS.  Can someone help with this?
Thanks in advance,
George Thompson
