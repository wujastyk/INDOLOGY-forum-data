Thanks to Cal Watkins and Byron Bender I now have a more authentic  
version of the story, as good as we are likely to get.  It happened  
at Columbia University on the late 40's.  The language was Russian,  
the student was Robert Austerlitz, the teacher was Jakobson, and what  
he said was "Try to understand!"
Watkins did indeed take a class conducted in Russian from my father  
at a Linguistic Institute in Bloomington, Indiana, but at the time he  
did understand Russian.

What is surprising is that Austerlitz, who was fluent in 13  
languages, from Finnish to Gilyak, did not know Russian...

As Jean-Luc Chevillard said: The more languages one knows, the better.
