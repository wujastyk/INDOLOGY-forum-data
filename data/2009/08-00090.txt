As Paul Hackett already mentioned: Nagari support is built into the 
Macintosh system (just as it is on Linux with the KDE user interface). 
An additional program is not needed. I use the "Devanagari - QWERTY" 
keyboard layout, because I have still not taken the time to master the 
alternative, "Devanagari", which is the Indian-made Inscript layout.
