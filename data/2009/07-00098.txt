'adhimukti'
Dear Taylor,
A very highlighting conceptual discussion of adhimukti/adhimok.sa can be
found in Lambert Schmithausen: Der Nirvaa.na-Abschnitt in der
Vini'scayasa.mgraha.nii der Yogaacaarabhuumi.h, Vienna 1969, pp. 179-180
(= endnote 263). As for the term adhimukticaryaa, your colleague is
certainly aware of the fact that it designates a pre-stage (but actually
already a bhuumi) in the system of the bodhisattvabhuumi-s. Although the
book is not availabe to me at the present moment, I guess some semantic
informations might be found in Har Dayal's classic work on the Bodhisattva
doctrine in Buddhism.
With best regards,
Vincent E.
