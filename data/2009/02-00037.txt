SARIT: Search and Retrieval of Indic Texts
I am pleased to announce a new service that is now available through the 
INDOLOGY website.
SARIT is a freely-available online facility that enables you to search 
through an online library of Sanskrit texts for keywords, 
word-collocations, and other linguistic strings.  The system is based on 
the well-known ARTFL software, and is exceptionally powerful.  It can 
handle many forms of query and output, including KWIC indexes.  Your 
imagination is the limit.
The texts are presented on screen using standard scholarly roman 
transliteration (Unicode), and searches can be constructed in 
transliteration or in a plain ASCII equivalent.
As of today the SARIT library includes the full texts of the 
Manavadharmasastra and the Arthasastra.  We expect the library to expand 
in the future as funding, time, and expertise allow.
SARIT is available here:

The SARIT service has been discussed and planned by myself and Richard 
Mahoney, and implemented by Richard.  Financial support for part of the 
work has been received from the British Association for South Asian 
Studies (www.basas.org.uk), to whom we are most grateful.
Enjoy,
