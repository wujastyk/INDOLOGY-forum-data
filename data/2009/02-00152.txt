There is of course the related practice of using pen-names and  
signature words (-a?ka, -l??chana, -cihna), commonly also at the  
end of cantos, that might be considered here. An early one (if  
attestation exists) might be Ca?raci?dha. Hemacandra (1088-1172 ce)  
in his De??n?mam?l? 3.7 gives Ca?raci?dha (= Skt. caturacihna)  
as a  pen-name for the S?tav?hana king H?la. See H.C. Bhayani,
