Dear Jonathan,
It is common practice for  poet to insert his own name in his poem,  
usually in the last stanza in medieval North Indian poetry. This is  
called a bhaNita. Jayadeva's GItagovinda has it in practically all  
the 24 songs, and elsewhere in the poem too. I have referred to this  
in my book Le GItagovinda. Tradition et innovation dans le kAvya,  
Almquist & Wiksell, Stockholm 1977, pp. 128-129 and under Jayadeva in  
the Index Verborum.
Of course, Jayadeva was not a Buddhist, mais encore...
Best regards
Stella
