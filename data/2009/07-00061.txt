Dear Colleagues,

There is apparently no copy of the Saura Purana in any British  
Library, although the ASS edition of 1889 has been reprinted several  
times, I believe.  Does anyone elsewhere have access to a copy of this  
(or another edition) who would be prepared to send me a photocopy or,  
better still, a scan of adhy. 30?  If so, I should be most grateful.
