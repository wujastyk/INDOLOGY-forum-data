Sorry. In the above sentence, 'akamuTaiyAl' should be actually  'akamuTaiyAL'.
 
Online Tamil Lexicon also gives the following entries.
 
    camucAram  01 1. cycle of mundane existence; worldly life; 2. family;  3. 
wife
 
    camucAri   
1. married person, householder; 2. husbandman; farmer; 3. one  involved in 
the cycle of births as a result of  karma

 
I have actually heard villagers use 'camcAri/camucAri' in the sense of  
'farmer'.
