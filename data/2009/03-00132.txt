Neriosangh, a Gujarati Parsi *dastur*, translated the Avestan Yasna into
Sanskrit
probably in the 15th c. This translation (discovered by Anquetil Dupperon
during his stay in India) was of crucial help for Eug?ne Burnouf (1801-1852)
in his comparative studies of the Avesta, mainly in *Commentaire sur le
Ya?na*, Paris, 1833ff., continued in 1861 by Friedrich Spiegel
in*Neriosengh?s Sanskrit-?bersetzung des Ya?na
*.

There are other early modern Sanskrit translations of Avestic or Pahlavi
Zoroastrian works (e.g. parts of the *Vendidad*, *Arda Viraz*, etc.).
