Dear Dr. COllins,
Is there a web-accessible pdf of that Goddess a Feminist article? I am 
intrigued, as my reading of the Samkhya is has come up with quite 
another conclusion, but I'm opebn to a fresh perspective.

Best
Bob Thurman

For your information, I have two PhDs, both from the University of Texas Austin, one in psychology (my day job), the other in Sanskrit (my research interest, and love).  My article on philosophical Samkhya as a coded feminist narrative (more or less) was published in the Hiltebeitel/Erndl edited volume, Is the Goddess a Feminist?, 2001 or so (I have other publications, this is one you might just glance at sometime when in the library to see what I do).
