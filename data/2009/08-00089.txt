Aditya Behl
Dear list members, 
I very much regret being the bearer of this
tragic news, but I am sure that some will
wish to know of the premature passing of
Aditya Behl, a brilliant colleague in the
field of Indo-Muslim literature. I forward here
the message distributed by the director
of the University of Pennsylvania 
South Asian Center, Prof. Kathleen Hall.
