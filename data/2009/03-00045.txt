Tamil translation of the MitAk.sarA
Dear colleagues,
Might any one know if a Tamil translation of the Mitaksara, 
Vijnanesvara's commentary on the Yajnavalkyasmrti, begun by Porur 
Vadiyar, which his brother Chidambara Vadiyar, headmaster of Tamil at 
the College of Fort St George, completed after his death and submitted 
in 1815 for publication by the Madras government, was ever published?
I would be grateful,
Rosane Rocher
