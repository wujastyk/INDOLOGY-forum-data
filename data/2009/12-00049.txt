Dear List,
I went to this google transliteration site and started to type in the 
first lines of the Rigveda, and immedately I ran into problems. How does 
one generate something like? Rtvijam????And? how does one insert Vedic 
accent?
This thing seems no better than earlier transliteration programs as far 
as I can see.
