Akota bronzes--a few pages please!
Thanks Stefan! (By the way, you might want to check the way the website is
processing foot notes in the inscription--they're almost all note 1, it
seems...)
Many thanks to all; I'll follow up the references when I can get to my
office and the library. (I can't help observing how a putatively very
nonreligious country like the Netherlands seems to pay very special
attention to holy days ....)
