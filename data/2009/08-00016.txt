Durga with a violin
Dear Dr. Claudine Bautze-Picron!
Thank you very much, I saw this representation of Shiva with a bottle in his hand and I was also wondering whether it was one and the same pictureas that of the presumed Durga, only slightly modified, as other attributes coincide with those of Gurga. In Lebedev's book the image was presented and discribed in details as  Durga's.  Have you any idea how to get access to the original picture?
