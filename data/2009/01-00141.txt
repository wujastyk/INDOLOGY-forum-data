resending question on chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions              and conjugations?
Hi Peter,
Are you saying that the vocative is chanted after the nominative? I 
always thought it was at the end - after the locative.
Like this
Nominative - Prathama
Accusative - Dvitiya
....
Locative - Saptami
Vocative - Sambodhanam  <----------
Best,
Dean
