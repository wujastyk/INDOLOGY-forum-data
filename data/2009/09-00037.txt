(Note the correction: the website is http://tamil.berkeley.edu and  
then you choose software).

I have made a unicode keyboard driver for the Mac (OS X -- I'm using  
Snow leopard, but it should run on earlier versions of OS X) that uses  
the forward slash as a dead key and enables easy input of the  
diacriticals for Tamil and Sanskrit (and most other South Asian  
languages).  It is available at http://tamil.berkeley.edu (choose  
software).  The software is in the public domain.

I did this because I suddenly realized that all the diacriticals  
needed for Sanskrit and Tamil are already in unicode and there is no  
need for a special font -- I have used the TimesIndian font for years.

I have developed a Nisus macro, also available from the above website,  
that converts from TimesIndian to unicode for Indian diacriticals.

Hope this proves useful to some.  George Hart
