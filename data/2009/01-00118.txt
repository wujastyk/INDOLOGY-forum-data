May 30th -July 21 , 2009

The ISSJS program is intended to provide 
scholars in philosophy, religion, anthropology, theology and South Asian 
studies with an opportunity to pursue Jain studies in India from May 30 to 
July 21 2009. 
During this period, scholars will study in the 
North Indian cities of Delhi, Jaipur and 
Varanasi. While in or on way to Jaipur,
students will go on short trips or excursions to 
nearby areas in Rajasthan. 

The course of study follows a daily schedule 
of lectures by notable Indian scholars 
covering a range of topics from Jain history 
and philosophy to rituals practices and 
contemporary Jain life. An integral part of 
this program is the opportunity to 
contextualize what is learned in the 
classroom by visiting academic, historical 
places of interests, interacting with Jain 
communities and participating in cultural 
activities. 

In addition, ISSJS will provide language 
tutorial for students already engaged in the 
study of Prakrit and Sanskrit. Tutorials will be 
based on student requests for two to four 
weeks during the program. 

Please note: In 2009, ISSJS will also offer a 
One month long parallel program (June 7th 

till July 6th 2009) introduction and basics of 
Jainism, its philosophy, history and culture. 
This program is primarily intended for 
professors?teachers and research scholars

education etc. with interest in Jain studies

who might be interested in pursuing 
graduate studies in Jainism.
