Subject: Caraka-Samhita, English translation - help requested
Message-ID: <161227086414.23782.17035798603269853855.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The first volume with parts 1-32 of Kisari Mohan Ganguli's English
translation of the Caraka-Samhita can now be downloaded from the GRETIL
e-library (address see below).
 
Volume 2 with parts 33-60 is in the pipeline, but will take some time due to
the poor print quality of the original, which hampers the recognition rate of
the background text of both e-books.
 
Unfortunately, this library has never received the remaining parts (61-68) of
Ganguli's translation. Would someone be so kind as to tell me from where good
copies or scans can be ordered so I can eventually complete the e-book?
 
 
[By the way, Ganguli's translation is often ascribed to the publisher,
Avinash Chandra Kaviratna - much like Ganguli's translation of the
Mahabharata, which is usually ascribed to Pratap Candra Roy.]
 
Thanks in advance,
Reinhold Gr?nendahl

The managers of the ZDMG digital edition website have announced that they
will be providing PDF download facilities, certainly for pages, and if
possible also for individual articles.  It is in the pipeline.
