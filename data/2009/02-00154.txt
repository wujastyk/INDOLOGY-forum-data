SV: signature verses
It may be of interest in this connection that,
as I note in my article in 
S. Pollock's Literary Cultures in History,
Sa skya Pandita actually compiled a short 
anthology of such verses that involve the
author's self-praise. It is found in his
nga brgyad ma'i 'grel pa. This may therefore
be a useful source for locating some other 
examples, preserved at least in Tibetan translation.
(All of Sa pan's examples are from Indian
Buddhist works.)
