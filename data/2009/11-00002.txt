yugas and colours
Here you can see a photo of durva grass:

It is (by our naming) "green". One of the problems with colors is
that black, blue and green often are conflated in the same term.
Or "dark" might mean green. 
And in some areas green and yellow share the same term.
So here, I'd guess (in terms of the way 'we" perceive color),
dvapara would be green, not 
"black as durva grass". 
krta--color of conch or milk--= white
treta--like gold = yellow
dvapara --durva grass = green (elsewhere, blue or dark blue)
kali= kaajal--usually  there's little variation with real black.
The missing color here is red.
But, like classification of foods according to their warmth or
coldness, dryness or moisture, etc.,  these color classifications
will show variation.

Re: yugas and colours
The /Balacarita/ of Bhasa also mentions Narayana/Visnu's changing
colors in the yugas in its opening lines:
Krta: the color of conch or milk
Treta: shiny like gold
Dvapara: black as durva grass
Kali: black as collyrium
