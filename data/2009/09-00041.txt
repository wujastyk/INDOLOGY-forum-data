Regarding Kar?r, a recent useful book to consult is the two-volume

/Catalogue of Archaeological Sites in Tamil Nadu/, K. Rajan, V.P. 
Yathees Kumar, S. Selvakumar,
Heritage India Trust, Thanjavur, 2009.
(with a preface by Y. Subbarayalu)

ISBN: 978-81-907451-1-6 (Vol.1)

ISBN: 978-81-907451-2-3 (Vol. 2)

Inside the section "Archaeology of Amaravathi, Noyyal and Bhavani river 
valley", professor K. Rajan writes (p.30):

"This region was under the control of Ch?ras whose first capital Va?ji 
was on the banks of river Periyar in the district Trichur and the second 
capital Kar?r was on the left bank of river Amaravathi at its confluence 
with river Kaveri. Both the capitals were connected with a 
well-established trade route that connected through Palghat pass on its 
west and with K?v?ripa??i?am on the east through Ch??a capital U?aiy?r 
along the river K?v?ri".

The book provides a lot of up-to-date information on 1995 sites.
For the modern Karur district, 86 sites are listed (site N? 732 to site 
N? 817) on pp.265-292
(with precise location and bibliography).
