Regarding the problem of the exact meaning of colours there is the  
excellent article by Jean Filliozat: "Classement des coleurs et des  
lumi?res en sanskrit" in Bulletin de l'Ecole Pratique des Hautes  
Etudes, IVe section, Paris 1955. See also the chapter "Les coleurs  
des sentiments" in my book Le GItagovinda. Tradition et innovation  
dans le kAvya, Stockholm 1977, pp.144-154.
