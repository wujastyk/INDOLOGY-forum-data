Subject: "samsara" meaning "life"
Message-ID: <161227084720.23782.7776489023865234253.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The spirit of this verse reminds me of the Pali cliche "sambaadho 
gharaavaaso rajopatho, abbhokaaso pabbajjaa," etc.

No doubt there are many similar expressions in other texts, maybe in 
Bhartrhari though I can't think of the verse at the moment.
