signature verses and cikacika?
The Skt word caikyacikya could possibly be related to what appears in Marathi as cakcakNe "to shine in a flashy way", the adj cakcakIt "polished, clean".

signature verses and cikacika?
A footnote to the discussion on signature verses. There are also such
allusions in prose, for instance Aanandavardhana in Dhvanyaaloka
(towards the very end of the commentary on the first verse--also
identified as such by Abhinavagupta thereon: aananda iti ca
granthakrto naama).
I came across a most peculiar sounding word in
Pramaanavaarttikalankaara 334,7, which I can't find in the
dictionaries: caikyacikya. I assume it is derived from cikacika, and
it must desribe some color (or shape) (ruupa). Any idea anyone?
