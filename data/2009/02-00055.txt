Ludwik Sternbach Bibliography
Is there any German project (with Harrassowitz) to publish one or two 
volume(s) of L. Sternbach's "Kleine Schriften" (an opportunity both 
to reprint some of his papers, esp. the ones less easily available, 
and to list his more recent bibliography, including several 
monographs) ?
