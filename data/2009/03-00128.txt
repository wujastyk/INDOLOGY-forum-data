At the University of Leipzig dissertations can be written in all major  
languages, pending on permission by the faculty, which is almost  
automatically granted. We had a couple of dissertations in Spanish  
recently and of course many more in English. The regulations may  
differ not only from one university to another, but also for different  
faculties within the same university. There are probably some  
faculties where one can still submit dissertations in Latin.
