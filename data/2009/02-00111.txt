It would be interesting to study the roots of the common Sanskrit  
dictionaries. The influence of B?htlingk & Roth has been enormous,  
but there were other sources, notably the famous early Sanskrit- 
English dictionary edited by H. H. Wilson (1819, 2nd ed. 1831). Long  
ago I was checking the definition of some ritual terms in various  
dictionaries and noted that Apte had often copied, in a slightly  
condensed form, the very words of some longer definitions from  
Wilson. By the way, Wilson is the dictionary R?ckert is said to have  
copied by hand as the book was too expensive.
