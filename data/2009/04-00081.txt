Endowments for Vedic studies in the Karandai plates (Re:              "kaapya-" vs. "kaapeya-" (Re: Actual use of gotra (=vr.ddha) and              yuvan
Dear Arlo,
I cannot answer your question regarding Atharvavedic brahmins
because what I find in the 1984 Karandai plates volume is:
an /agrah?ra/). For each brahmin receiving a share, the grant records 
his gotra, his s?tra, his place of birth and his name. The grant was 
made during the 8th year of the king's reign (supposed to have started 
in 1012 A.D.)
Atharva veda is mentionned but specific individuals are not mentionned. 
(See below).
K.G. Krishnan, the editor, describes the endowment in the following way 
(p.63):

Endowments for Vedic studies were also made in the following manner: for 
M?m??sa - 5 /v?li/, for V?danta - 5 /v?li/ and for Vy?kara?a - 4 /v?li/ 
as /ki?aippu?am/ (/gha?ikaippu?am/) get each 2 /v?li/: 1) Pavi?iyam, 2) 
Taittiriyam 3) V?jasan?yam, 4) Chand?gam (Chhand?gam), 5) Atharvam, 6) 
Talavak?ram and 7) R?p?vat?ram. Pavi?iyam derived from Bahv?icha stands 
for ?igv?da.Taittir?yam and V?jasan?yam represent respectively the 
K?ish?a and ?ukla Yajurv?da. Chhand?gam and Talavak?ram are of S?mav?da. 
R?p?vat?ra is a work on grammar stated to have been composed by 
Bha??an?r?ya?a and Dharmak?rti [FOOTNOTE: /History of Sanskrit 
Literature/ (M. Krishnamachariar), p. 733, note 8] Two /v?li/ of land 
were assigned to the person teaching the recital of /Sm?itim?la-grantha/ 
and to the person reciting Bh?ratam.
