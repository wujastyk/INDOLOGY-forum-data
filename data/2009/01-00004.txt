Dear Mr./Dr. (?) Collins,

I could help you out with your online Sanskrit queries.  I'm currently
enrolled in a PhD program at Columbia University in MEALAC.  I also have an
MPhil from Oxford in Indo-Iranian Linguistics.  If you are interest, please
let me know more about what exactly you need help with in addition to
accessing online texts which can be done quite easily on GRETIL
<http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil.htm> and other
sites.  Monier Williams is availible here: MW
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/>and Apte's here:
APTE<http://www3.aa.tufs.ac.jp/%7Etjun/sktdic/>.
The usual going rate is about $25-$40 depending on what I would have to do.

All the Best,
Victor D'Avella
