Bhagavata-Purana
There is a relatively recent critical edition published from Adhmedabad. My copy is in storage but this seems to be it (exported and slightly expanded from worldcat):
??STR?, H. G., SHELAT, B. K., & ??STR?, K. K. (1996-2002).?r?bh?gavatam: ?r?mad Bh?gavata-mah?pur??am : sam?k?ita ?vr?tti. Ahamad?b?da, Bho. Je. Adhyayana-Sa??odhana Vidy?bhavana.
