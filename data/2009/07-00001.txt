Tibetan formal debating is quite physical, with the hands being clapped etc.? This will be familiar to many readers of this list and is described, for example, in Georges Dreyfus, The Sound of Two Hands Clapping (2003), pp.217 ff.

See, e.g., http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crvh74HtYJA


In the Carakasa?hit?, vi.8.15, there is a description of some reasons why one might want to debate.? The text says that in the heat of a debate, a teacher may accidentally blurt out some information about advanced topics that the students have not yet covered.? So its advantageous to them.

?c?rya? ... paraspare?a saha jalpan pi??ena vijig??ur ?ha sa?har??t /

arguing with each other, the teacher, out of excitement (sa?har?a) says that [i.e., secret], with a pi??a.

I'm writing to ask about this pi??a.? The 11th century commentator Cakrap??i glosses it as "s?roddh?re?a", i.e., "with a pithy text".? So a pi??a is a "gobbet," in 20th century parlance.? That works quite well, but I'm not convinced.

The 20th century editor, Trikamji, notes in a footnote that there is another reading "pa??ena", that the commentator Ga?g?dhara explains as being "by the light of his learnedness".? Hmm.

It crossed my mind that this pi??ena - if that's what the MSS really say - might possibly refer to some physical gesture.? Does anyone have any suggestions about this?

Thanks,
Dominik
