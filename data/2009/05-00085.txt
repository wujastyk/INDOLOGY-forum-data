textual sequence
It is difficult to say without examining the passages concerned. But there is a regular practice of indicating the?section dealt with at the end of the discourse. See any? commentariy?on the Amarako.sa, (say,Bh?nuji D?k.sita) on any entry end eg., pa?ca ?aileyasya ?il?jita iti khy?tasya II.122,123a. But it is? not being claimed that the same is the case with the Pali commentary. Please indicate if?that practice is relevant

textual sequence
Dear All,
According to my experience the textual sequence in commentaries regularly is: text to be commented on (for instance a verse or list of terms), commentary on the words or terms of the preceding verse or list (prat?kas plus explanations). I now have a P?li commentary where it is exactly the other way round (prat?kas plus explanations, followed by the text from which the prat?kas are extracted).
I would like to know whether this is? a common feature in commentarial literature only unnoticed by me.
Would be thankful for any comments,
Petra
