Classical heritages
Dear colleagues,
I am hoping that someone might be able to direct me to a source which 
might give me a rough idea of the comparison of the classical heritage 
of India versus the classical heritage of Europe from Greece and Rome. 
What I have in mind is something like a first order approximation of the 
relative sizes of the literature, the manuscripts and their cataloging. 
Clearly, this must be done for some arbitrarily chosen cut off date.
Best wishes,
Brendan Gillon
