Again, equipment of the conference
Dear Colleagues,
I apologise for sending this message again to the Indology list.
My last message contains a thoughtless message.
This must be only to reply Prof. Eli Franco's question, 
but I am receiving recently same questions several times. 
So I would like to reply concerning Equipment of the
14th World Sanskrit Conference in this opportunity.
Each lecture room is equipped with PC, a (power point)
projecter, a screen and microphones. And our students helpers
can help the speakers during their presentations.
Photocopying can be purchased at the Copy Shop in 
the basement of the Clock Tower at a cost of 10 yen
per page.
Yours,
Prof. Akihiko Akamatsu
Secreatariat of the 14th WSC
