Just to add an observation here: the underlying assumption of this 
argument is that freely making available publications online will 
decrease the value (and sales) of the print versions. This assumption 
has not been confirmed by the experience of online publishing so far - 
in fact, publishers do regularly report that their print sales go up 
once their content is available online - because on the one hand, 
apparently, many readers do prefer having the physical (bound) 
publication in their hands (and many libraries reasonably assume that 
paper is a more reliable form of long-term archiving than digital 
formats that may turn out to be short-lived), and because on the other 
hand, online circulation attracts new readers to a journal or book that 
otherwise would not have come across it.
All of this is terribly complex, and as with many other things 
concerning digitization, things are far from being predetermined; a 
number of financing and distribution models for journals are currently 
being tried out. But one thing is for sure: the assumption that free 
online access diminishes print sales is most certainly not a categorical 
truth.
