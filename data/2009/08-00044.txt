Several people have kindly requested a copy of my article on the history 
of cannabis in India.  A pre-publication draft PDF will be downloaded by 
clicking the link http://tinyurl.com/p2flzz There are some misprints and 
typos.  It's a draft of the lecture, not a final publication.
The published version appeared in

Ayurveda at the crossroads of care and cure. Proceedings of the 
Indo-European Seminar on Ayurveda held at Arr?bida, Portugal, in November 
2001 (Lisbon, 2002).  See http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57478361
