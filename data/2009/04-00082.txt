I expect you are familiar with this book:
Vogel, J. P., 1962,  The Goose in Indian 
Literature and Art.  Memoirs of the Kern 
Institute No. II. E. J. Brill, Leiden.
According to my notes, Vogel (good name?) 
identified haMsa and rAjahaMsa with a mainly 
white form of the Indian goose (Anser indicus), 
and kalahaMsa with the greylag goose (Anser 
anser).
