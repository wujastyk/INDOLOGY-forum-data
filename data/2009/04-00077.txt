Tolkaappiyam & Tolkaappiyan2 (Re: "kaapya-" vs. "kaapeya-" (Re:              Actual use of gotra (=vr.ddha) and yuvan
Dear Jan,
thanks for you stimulating and thoughtful feedback:
(<http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0904&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=7929>)
Commenting only on your "remarque liminaire" [SEE BELOW],
I wish to provide more detail on the situation.
*(A)*
Occurences of the word /k?ppiyam/, where it is an adaptation to Tamil of 
the Sanskrit word /k?vya/ are met with in Tamil. Nobody denies that.
An obvious example is the expression /aim-peru?-k?ppiyam/ ("the five big 
k?ppiyam") which certainly emulates the Sanskrit list(s) of 5 /mah?k?vya/-s
That expression is for instance seen inside the commentary by 
Mayilain?tar (13th cent.) to Na???l 387, inside the enumeration:
"aimperu?k?ppiyam, e?peruttokai, pattupp???u, pati?e?k??kka?akku"
which lists, after the 5 big K., the 8 anthologies, the 10 songs and the 
18 minor works.
The earliest attestation of /k?ppiyam/ (= /k?vya/) in Tamil literature 
might be inside the Ma?im?kalai (19:80).
*(B)*
Occurrences of the word /k?ppiya?/, which is the adaptation to Tamil of 
the Sanskrit /k?pya/, which belongs to the gotra-related vocabulary and 
which is derived from /kapi/ (as per the discussion which has just taken 
place) are also found.
For the recent discussion, see 
<http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0904&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=6075>
For an instance (and its interpretation), see the page 172, and the 
entry /k?ppiyan/ inside the
/Tami?k Kalve??uc Collakar?ti/ [Glossary of Tamil Inscriptions], 
compiled by Professor Y. Subbarayalu
[2 volumes, Santhi Sadhana Trust, Chennai, 2002]
In that glossary, Professor Subbarayalu explains /k?ppiyan/ as /k?ppiya 
k?ttirattaic c?rntava?/ ("one who belongs to the gotra /k?ppiya/") and 
gives as an illustration an inscription dated 941, which is precisely 
the one mentionned by S. Palaniappan in the discussion, and which I have 
reproduced in the following post:
<http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0904&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=6668>
*(C)*
The problems starts when one wants to explain the name of the 
grammatical work called /tolk?ppiyam/.
The traditional view, expressed in all commentaries is that the name of 
the book /tolk?ppiyam/ is derived from the name of its author 
/tolk?ppiya?/ (honorific: /tolk?ppiya??r/ ).
As a matter of fact, what also happens is that commentaries often 
contain a section that explains how books are named and that that 
derivation is given as one among several examples (just like the grammar 
/Akattiyam/ is said to derive its name from its author /Akattiya?(?r)/).
On top of that explanation, the name /tolk?ppiya?/ (honorific: 
/tolk?ppiya??r/ ) is explained as "born in the /k?ppiyak ku?i/" (See 
Madras Tamil Lexicon, p. 2098), where /ku?i/ is the Tamil equivalent of 
/gotra/.
One point which remains to be explained is why the component /tol/ is 
added and this was one of my reasons for trying to understand the inner 
workings of the opposition /v?ddha/ vs. /yuvan/. And I am aware that my 
explanation is tentative.
[Subsidiary question: what does the "pal" component mean inside the name 
"pal-k?ppiya?" (another grammarian)?]
*(D)*
As for the "alternative theory", it is found for instance in the section 
written by Pierre Meile inside L'Inde Classique (1953, Tome II, ? 1904) 
where he mentions
"le trait? didactique intitul? le ? Vieux Po?me ?, /Tolk?ppiyam/" and 
where he sends the reader to the paragraph ?1539.
Inside the /Lexicon of Tamil Literature/ (1995), Kamil Zvelebil writes 
(on pages 705-706):
<BEGIN QUOTE>
The name /tol-k?ppiyam/ prob. means "ancient composition" (i.e. DEDR 
3516 old, ancient + /k?ppiyam/ < Skt. /k?vya-). This etymology is not 
waterproof, and other interpretations were suggested [...] The author's 
name, Tolk?ppiya?/ Tolk?ppiyar/ Tolk?ppiya??r is evidently derived from 
the name of the book, although different interpretation is possible: 
"the ancient (/tol/) scion of the K?vyas', i.e. members of the /gotra/ 
of Kavi (cf. /k?ppiyakku?i/ in --> /Cilappatik?ram/ XXX.83 /k?ppiya-t 
tolku?i/, ancient Brahmin family of K?vya /gotra/ in T?r?r [...]
<END QUOTE>
Although I admire the work of the late Professor Zvelebil, I would have 
presented the data in the opposite order.
*(E)*
I suppose the explanation to the confusion is that, as soon as the word 
/k?ppiyam/, (adaptation of /k?vya/) became current, it became impossible 
not to think of it while referring to somebody who had the /k?ppiya?/ 
(derived from gotra "kapi") component in his name. The semantic 
attraction produced a kind of "popular etymology".
