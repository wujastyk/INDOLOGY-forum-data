amrita
So far many thanks for the references. They were very helpful. One last
question. Does anyone know about digital versions of the Thieme article?
Many thanks again and warm greetings

Dear friends,
I remember vaguely to have learned that in Vedic Sanskrit the word amrita
does not mean immortality but rather something like ' long life'. Can anyone
provide me with some references to articles on this word? I am also looking
for parallels in other Vedic texts of the so-called Purusha-sukta (Rig Veda
10.90).Or perhaps adaptations of this hymn in later Sanskrit literature:
Epics, Puranas.
With many greetings and many thanks
Victor van Bijlert
