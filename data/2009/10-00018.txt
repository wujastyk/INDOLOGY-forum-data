Unicode fonts for Ranjana/Lentsa
Dear McComas,
Quoting McComas Taylor <McComas.Taylor at ANU.EDU.AU>:
    I was looking into Ranjana fonts a couple of years ago.  The short  
answer is that there are *some* fonts out there; the only ones I found  
were "RanjanaLipi" and "PrachalitLipi":
http://www.ffonts.net/BISHOWSON2-Ranjana-Lipi-ISBN9993355933.font
http://www.guthi.org/1html/regular_html/fonts.htm
but the documentation was wanting.  I know that Xenotype Technologies  
(http://www.xenotypetech.com) had been working on a Ranjana font, but  
had provisionally mapped the script to the Tibetan section of Unicode  
included in Unicode in it's own section. See:
http://www.unicode.org/pending/pending.html
(specifically http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3649.pdf)
I hope that helps, or is at least informative.
Best,
