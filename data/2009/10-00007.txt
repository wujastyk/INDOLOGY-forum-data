European auction houses and Asian materials
If there are any auction houses on the Continent of Europe that at least occasionally deal in rare books and manuscripts from South or Southeast Asia, could folks please inform me of them?  The Library of Congress is attempting to create an internal list of auction houses offering library materials.
Thanks,
