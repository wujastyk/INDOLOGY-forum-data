This is great news!  (I am surprised, though, that this was not part  
of the announcement, especially if it was planned from the  
beginning).  I have always been a supporter of Open Access, but I  
admit that I am more skeptical than some when it comes to how broadly  
I think it can/should work.
My best,
Steven
