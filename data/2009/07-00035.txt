Aditya Behl on the Clay Sanskrit Library
In response to enquiries about the destiny of CSL printed volumes:
Yes, the books are still very much on sale from NYUP and their 
affiliates (http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/order.php), as will be 
the 9 volumes (including 2 reprints) to appear this summer 
(http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes.php?show=12).
