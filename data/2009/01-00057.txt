Victor, 

You said,

" And this in spite of the fact
that Hinduism is the second largest non-Christian religion in the
Netherlands with approximately between 120,000 to 200,000 adherents."


I presume the largest is Islam.  Does this mean there are more Hindus than Jews?

Also, is it known how many are Hindus of Balinese or other Indonesian origin and how many from the subcontinent?
