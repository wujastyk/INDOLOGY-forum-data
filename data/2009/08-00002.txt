Hi McComas,
I believe there is a short, but very informative article ??? 
abhimukti?????on this subject by Sakurabe, who compared most  
of the P?li, Skt, and Tibetan materials extant.
Sakurabe Hajime, ???. 1997. ?????????. ??50 
??? ed. ??: ???. 34?39.
I thank Prof. Funayama of Kyoto University for the reference.
Regards,
Bill Mak
