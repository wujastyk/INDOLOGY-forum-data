Dear all,
I thank everybody who answered my query and made useful suggestions.
It is interesting that there is often no clear distinction between loss of 
taste and loss of appetite ~ though naturally I suppose the latter does not 
presuppose the former.  My context specifically highlights the loss of taste 
aspect.  The sources (Tibetan and Chinese, as usual) I am investigating 
suggest an underlying term that should comprise "burnt / parched / scorched 
+ lips / tongue".  This most obviously suggests 
vi'su.ka-jihvaa-taaluuna-ka.n.tha, but I am not sure if this also implies 
the loss of taste that is required contextually.  I had wondered if there 
was another Skt term that could have been used here.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
