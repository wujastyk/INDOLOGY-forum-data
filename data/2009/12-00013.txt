underwater hell or otherworld
Dear Jonathan,
To add to Adheesh's note: B?hatkath??lokasa?graha 5.115-137 tells  
the story of Udayana's visit to the underwater city of Bhogavat?,  
which is populated by N?gas from whom he obtains Gho?avat?, a  
magical v???. Bhogavat? is a paradise, not a hell.
Yours, with best wishes,
Jim
