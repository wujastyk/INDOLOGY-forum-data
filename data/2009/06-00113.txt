Nubian tribe?
Friends, an Arabist colleague writes to me as follows:
I'm writing an encyclopaedia article about a Nubian tribe known as Barabra
which lived along the Nile river in southern Egypt and the Sudan. Now I came
across a reference that "Sanskrit historians write already about the Old
Race of the Barabra living along the Upper Nile." Do you have any idea where
I could find out what and when and who?
I don't have any idea, but can anyone help?
