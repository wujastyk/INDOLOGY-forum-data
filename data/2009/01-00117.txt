Thanks for posting this version of the painting--I completely
missed the action in the previous more blurry version.

Dan Ehnbom is the curator of the South Asia collection at the
University of Virginia Museum. I told him about our discussion
about this painting and asked him to comment. He sent me a better
image of the painting, which I have posted to
http://people.virginia.edu/~rah2k/SlayingofShankasura.jpg, and
offered this comment:

Here is a better picture of it.  Sankhasura is the demonic figure
to the left of center at the bottom.  Because Indian art, as
Coomaraswamy said, is an art of statement rather than
description, he is not very conch-like, except perhaps for the
blob-like form on his abdomen. 
Possibly this is the demon assuming his true form at the moment
of his death.
