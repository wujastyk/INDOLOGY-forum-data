Rs 2 m worth ganja powder detected 
Saturday, 10 September 2005 - 4:41 AM SL Time    
Moneragala District Special Detection unit raided a ganja
plantation recently in Tanamalwila area and recovered powdered
ganja worth over Rs.2 million. The raid was conducted on a tip
off. The ganja plantation was located in a secret place inside
Mahawewa jungle in Tanamalwila. 
Police arrested one suspect who possessed 505 kilograms of
powdered ganja packed to be delivered to Colombo. According to
police the contraband has been powdered not for smoking purposes
but to use as an ingredient to manufacture 'Madana Modaka' (an
ayurvedic drug to stimulate sensors). 
Police also took a special machine used to powder the marijuana
substances into their custody along with the contraband. 
The suspect and the contraband were produced before the
Moneragala Magistrate

Re: Sri Lankan Ayurveda
Dear Prof. Wujastyk,
Thank you and others for your references to Sri Lankan Ayurveda.
In reference to your above mentioned article, I have come across
a herbal medicine mentioned in Sri Lankan Ayurveda called "Modana
Modaka". Have you heard of this? I suspected that it might be
either cannabis or some opiate.
