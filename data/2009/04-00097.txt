   Dear Colleagues,

Christophe's remarks about the ha?sa are very much to the point but  
this discussion seems to have lost sight of the original query, which  
was about the r?jaha?sa.? A priori, we might expect some  
differentiation to be involved.? In discussing specifically the  
identities of the fauna of the R?m?ya?a, I long ago noted about the  
r?jaha?sa: "either synonymous with /ha?sa /or more probably  
Phoenicopterus roseus Pallas, flamingo" with a footnote "The latter  
identification makes much more appropriate Kaikey?'s comparison of the  
hunchbacked Manthar? with a /r?jaha?s?/ (2.9.33). On the other hand, a  
fourth stage passage (3.1074* pairs a /r?jaha?sa/ and a /ha?s?./"  
(/Righteous R?ma/ p.95).

   Yours
