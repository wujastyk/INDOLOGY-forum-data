Subject: AW: Gruenendahl,              German Indology and National Socialism (Was: No longer Language              barriers --- financial barriers)

I add my name to those who politely request that this debate in this form 
be conducted elsewhere.

The topic is of some genuine interest and relevance to the history of the 
field of indology, and is potentially appropriate for discussion on this 
list.  But much ink has already been spilled, and it seems to me that
at present, positions that have already been adequately articulated here 
and elsewhere are just being repeated.

What is particularly inappropriate is the personal tone of the exchanges. 
This isn't necessary, and while we all enjoy a bit of a tussle sometimes, 
it really has to be stopped in this forum and at this time.

As a member of the INDOLOGY committee, therefore, I would like to ask
all members of this list to cease posting on this topic for one week at 
least.  After that, if it is necessary to resume the discussion, it must 
absolutely be carried out in a genuinely impersonal manner.

With thanks to all parties,

Dominik Wujastyk
