Syntax of Dative
Dear Madhav,
My first impulse was to see the influence of the frequent collocation of 
namas + god-name in the dative.  I see now that Delbrueck discusses 
namas, as well as other formulas of respect or invocation, such as 
svaahaa, svadhaa, vaSaT [p. 145 "Dativ bei Substantiven"] (sorry for 
using the now obsolete Harvard-Kyoto here, but for me the trouble to get 
the correct diacritics into an email is still too great). 
dhaa- in the sense 'to offer, lend' frequently takes the dative, of 
course.  As for dhiimahi, the 'later tradition' which takes it from 
dhii- instead of dhaa- is I think triggered by the RV Gayatri itself, 
since dhiimahi is immediately followed by dhiyas there.  I take this to 
be a pun in the mind of the Rsi, rather than an etymology.  When the 
Gayatri is quoted in the TS 1.5.3, Keith prefers to translate dhiimahi 
as "we meditate" ['in the later priestly sense'].  If he is right in 
doing so, then this quotation may indicate that the etymological sense 
of dhiimahi from dhaa- may already be lost.
As for the dative with other verbs, vid- is cited by Delbrueck (umlauts 
are also too time-consuming) as taking a dative when it has a sense 'to 
provide for' [thus semantically close to 'give'].
I hope this helps, and I also would be interested to hear from others.
