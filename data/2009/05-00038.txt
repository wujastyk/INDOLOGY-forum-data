Devanagari Unicode fonts for the Mac?
I wonder if anyone has had any success with the newly released "World  
Ready Composer" plugin for CS4 (ME edition) on the Mac? Info about it  
is available here: http://www.thomasphinney.com/tag/world-ready-composer/ 
, which I discovered from an article on the reliable "Multilingual  
Mac" blog: http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/02/adobe-app-language-improvements.html
I would be interested to know if anyone has had the opportunity to try  
out what might be a positive new development in this front?
Also, has anyone else noticed that Devanagari rendering appears to  
work in Powerpoint 2008 (for Mac) but not the rest of the Office 2008  
suite? Perhaps also a positive step from Microsoft?
All  best wishes,
