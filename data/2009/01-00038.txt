Subject: Seeking Iyer's Gita film
Message-ID: <161227084454.23782.11247359713297265568.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Does anyone know how I might obtain a copy of G.V. Iyer's "Bhagavad Gita" film?  The copy I have is an old VHS that is almost unusable, and my attempts to locate a library copy to borrow have so far proven futile.

Thank you,
