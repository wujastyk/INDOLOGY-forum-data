The Film Adi Shankaracharya
Peter Wyzlic schreef:
- which is rather curious. When I visited Iyer in 1997, I found the book 
on his bookshelf. He had not read it, since it was in German. I read a 
few pages and found the remark that Iyer, though born an Advaitin, had 
become a Dvaitin and made the Madhva film. When I translated those lines 
to him, he heaved his shoulders slowly and remarked that scholars make 
all sorts of marvellous discoveries, including biographical details 
about him which he himself did not know about.
