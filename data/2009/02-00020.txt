Subject: "samsara" meaning "life"

There is an interesting point at stake here.  As far as I can see, most 
words for "world" in Sanskrit mean, first of all, the social world, not 
the physical, exterior world.

I used the word 'world' not in its strict literal sense but more in the sense of life in general ie in the sense of the relevant world.?Like samasaara 'world'? too has?polysemous facets. 'Lara is the greatest batsman in the world' should mean 'in the cricketing world' and not 'in the universe'. Sorry for too much advice!
