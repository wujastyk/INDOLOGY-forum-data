invertebrates
I am not aware of any other stone sculptures, or sculptures in other materials, but it may be of some interest that I once saw in a Red Fort antique shop a tiny silver cup, the size you see in Mughal miniatures, with insects and reptiles in the vertical ribs of the outside, each with eyes of tiny chip diamonds.  Unfortunately I hesitated before buying it and when a few days later I decided to get it and telegraphed it was already gone.  I remember clearly a serpent (not a cobra), a lizard, and a butterfly; I don't remember the rest, which would probably have totalled about eight.
Has anyone seen anything like this?  A ritual object, or just an artistic jeu d'esprit?
