Dear Colleagues,

Earlier today I sent an e-mail message to all members of the  
International Association of Sanskrit Studies announcing the  
establishment of a new newsletter (to be distributed solely by e-mail)  
and inviting contributions from members.  If you are a member of the  
IASS and have not received that message (there are some members for  
whom we do not have e-mail addresses and others whose addresses are  
out of date), please contact me so that I can include you on the  
mailing list.  If you want to renew your subscription or would like to  
join the IASS as a personal member, please contact the Treasurer,  
Professor Bruno Dagens.

Yours

John Brockington
