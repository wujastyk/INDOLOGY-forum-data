Sanskrit courses in India, between June and mid September
Dear Professor Nair,
My son is finishing first year Sanskrit at the Univ. of Chicago this year, which is his second go-round with the language.  I will let him know about your teaching, which I assume is in Trivandrum? If he can do it, which dates would be good, and could he do second year Sanskrit with you, along with a little spoken Sanskrit? What would be the fees involved?  I might be interested in joining him for a couple of weeks refresher course (I have a Ph.D. in Indic Studies, and was a Fullbright Scholar in Chenai (then Madras) in 1973 with Drs. Raghavan and Mahadevan.)
Best regards,
Al Collins
