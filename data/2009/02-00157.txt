This is how Abhyaakara tells his name in the first verse of the Vajraavalii
+ni.spraty?ham ih?bhayasya mahas? vajr?val? m?latu 
The proprer name has been translated in the Tibetan version
bjigs.pa. medpahi.mthu.yis.bgegs.med.hdir.ni.rdo.rje.phre?.ba.hdu.bar.?og 
Praj;naakara ends the Bodhicaryaavataarapa;njikaa 
ma;nju;sriir iva sadgu.navasati.h praj;naakaro jaayataam
There was no fixed rule. Poets writing in NIA languages took recourse to refrains occurring at regular intervals
