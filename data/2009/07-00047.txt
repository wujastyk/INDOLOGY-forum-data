Hindi poetry on the web?
Does anyone know of websites that display collections of poetry in Hindi by
modern Hindi poets such as the Chayavad and the Nayi Kavita? Such online
libraries do exist for example for English poetry: one can find Eliot,
Shakespeare, Milton, Keats etc online. I am wondering if such sites also
exist for Hindi poets of fame?
Thanks for possible feedback.
