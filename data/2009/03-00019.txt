Dear Allen,

> Mithila was just taken as the greatest and richest city

that may well be the case. There is also a J?taka version of the
Mah?vastu verse (Ja V 252.28?29) which just uses ?city? without
giving it a name:

   pa?cama? bhadram adhanassa   an?g?rassa bhikkhuno
   nagaramhi ?ayham?namhi   n?ssa ki? ci a?ayhatha

Best regards,
Stefan
