A student of mine working on Atharvavedic herbal plants says that he has some evidence for the currency of opium or a drug producing similar effects in the Atharvaveda. That, he thinks, was not marijuana. The existing theory is that opium was introduced in India much later. Is there any study or theory that opium was developed independently in India? I will see to it that any?information given to us on this is gratefully acknowledged?. Best DB

Personally, I am certain that Papaver somniferum L. is not known before the second millennium AD in India.? One can see how confused medical authors are about it, even as late as the commentators on Sarngadhara's Sarngadharasamhita (ca 1400).? The Sanskrit name is a transparent borrowing from Greek.

To establish earlier existence in S. Asia, one would have to
tick several boxes, including,
1. convincing physical description of the plant
2. plausible account of it's effects on the human body (constipation, etc.),
3. plus the quality of being vyaapin.

Cf my essay on cannabis, that is relevant in terms of methodology for this kind of study, and cites important earlier landmark studies, including one by Meulenbeld:
