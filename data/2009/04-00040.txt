Dear all,

does anyone out there has the e-mail address of Susan Amy Sinberg?

She is the author of a Ph.D. thesis on  the Taaraamuulakalpa (Columbia University 1995), a text which is important for my own research, which seems to be more or less unavailable in Germany. 

Please reply off-list.


Best wishes,
