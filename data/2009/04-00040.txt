E-mail query
Dear all,
does anyone out there has the e-mail address of Susan Amy Sinberg?
She is the author of a Ph.D. thesis on  the Taaraamuulakalpa (Columbia University 1995), a text which is important for my own research, which seems to be more or less unavailable in Germany. 
Please reply off-list.
Best wishes,
