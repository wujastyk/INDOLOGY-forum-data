"Visit SANSKNET while you can"
I tried to download the Sanskrit fonts for the website and then read the texts, but it failed. What is the exact procedure?

"Visit SANSKNET while you can"
Apologies for distracting from more important issues, but this may be the
window of opportunity for all those who know the SANSKNET project only by
hearsay (or from the numerous links on the GRETIL main page) to actually
visit the site:
http://sansknet.ac.in/
In the last few years it has been more off than on, but yesterday I
discovered that it is online again. 
When there, click "Content" to start a tour through a labyrinth of e-texts.
This is not the place to dicuss the pros (e.g., range of material) and cons
(encodings, atomization of texts, layout etc.). There are lots of valuable
material there, altough it may be difficult to use. Alternatively, you may
use the GRETIL versions provided for many of these texts (with more to
follow). They have been converted to romanized Unicode (and alternative
encodings), reformatted, and supplied with additional material, references,
etc.
Compare, e.g., the Brhadaranyaka-Upanisad on SANSKNET (special fonts
required)
http://sansknet.ac.in/upanishads/shankarabhashya/Brhadaranyakopanishad/index.

and the converted version on GRETIL
