Many apologies for botheriing you on an extra-professional inquiry:  I arrive at Tokyo airport early morning on Monday, Aug. 30th.  There will be some representatives of WSC at Tokyo aorport?  I should take the bullet train (oh, I can't wait) to Kyoto?
Very best regards,

Dear Colleagues,

detailed information concerning the registration, accommodation, and
other practical matters is available at our revised web-site:

In addition to the web-version of the 2nd circular, the site contains
the on-line system of registration and payment of registration fee. We
request all the participants to make the on-line registration for the
sake of our manageability, even if you have already sent us your

I apologize for a possible double mailing, as some of you might have
