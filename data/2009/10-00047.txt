Of course it's CE, not BCE.  None of the Tamil works can be dated
to BCE -- though we do have inscriptions from the first couple
centuries BCE.

The Tamil is

  paaz ena kaal ena paaku ena onRu ena pari.3-77
  iraNTu ena muunRu ena naanku ena aintu ena pari.3-78
  aaRu ena eezu ena eTTu ena toNTu ena pari.3-79
  naalvakai uuzi eN naviRRum ciRappinai pari.3-80
  ce kaN kaari karu kaN veLLai pari.3-81
  pon kaN paccai pai kaN maaal pari.3-82

(Malten's transcription)

"Black" is from kaari, ultimately from karu, the standard word
for "black."  "Dark" is maal, which can mean "blackness" or
"greatness,"  
"great man," "Visnu."  "Dark one with green eyes" could also mean
"Green-eyed Visnu!" -- which might make more sense, as "black"
has already been used.  The word for "green" can also mean
"yellow."
