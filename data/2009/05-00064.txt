The Arya-Sudra division is apparent even in the early part of the Rgveda but the four caste-system seems to have crystallised only in the late 10.90. Brahmins as a caste, Rajanyas, Vis's and Sudras are known to the AV. How far the occurrence of the terms reflect the existence of a rigid four caste system may be debated.??The other Vedas? know the four caste system.
According to Kuiper ennobling was common with the early Rgvedic Aryans. That must not have been congenial for the growth of the rigid four caste system. This may be partly true of the early part of the Atharvaveda. These matters?require more search than that has been made.
Best for all

Dear friends,
As an extra favour I would like to ask the following. The Purusha-sukta
mentions the four varnas, seemingly for the first time in the Rig Veda. Are
there other references in the Rig Veda to the four varnas by name, or
perhaps to any of these four separately? And what about the four varnas in
the other Veda-Samhitas or the Brahmanas and Aranyakas?
Thanks again
Victor van Bijlert
