underwater hell or otherworld
I do not remember if someone has already mentioned that Asoka's visit to the underwater kingdom of the Naagas in search of the relics of?Buddha in the Divyaavadaana is an early instance (2nd Cent? so De Jong) of the occurrence of the concept of the underwater world of the Naagas

Dear Jonathan,
To add to Adheesh's note: B?hatkath??lokasa?graha 5.115-137 tells the story of Udayana's visit to the underwater city of Bhogavat?, which is populated by N?gas from whom he obtains Gho?avat?, a magical v???. Bhogavat? is a paradise, not a hell.
Yours, with best wishes,
Jim
