I do not remember if someone has already mentioned that Asoka's visit to the underwater kingdom of the Naagas in search of the relics of?Buddha in the Divyaavadaana is an early instance (2nd Cent? so De Jong) of the occurrence of the concept of the underwater world of the Naagas

Dear Jonathan,

To add to Adheesh's note: B?hatkath??lokasa?graha 5.115-137 tells the story of Udayana's visit to the underwater city of Bhogavat?, which is populated by N?gas from whom he obtains Gho?avat?, a magical v???. Bhogavat? is a paradise, not a hell.

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim

In ?ivad?sa's version of the Vet?la-pa?cavi??ati, it is found in story 8 (which is cognate with ATU tale type 1889H, "Submarine Underworld" if you're a folklorist), and in story 11. In the Kath?sarits?gara's version of the VP, these are the stories #7 and 12, respectively, and I'd suggest your colleague take a look at Penzer's still quite useful comparative notes to Tawney's translation of the KSS (_Ocean of Story_), as found in vol. 6, pp. 278-285, and vol. 7, pp. 211-212.

I don't, however, recall seeing many references to Indic versions of these motifs.
