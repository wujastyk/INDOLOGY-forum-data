Chayavyakhya of Nagesha
The following message is forwarded to the list by request:
I am looking for Nagesha's commentary on the yogasutras, called
Chayavyakhya. I thought someone on your list would be able to point me
to it. Searching on the internet only yielded references to it, but
not to the published text.
Thanks,
Naresh
