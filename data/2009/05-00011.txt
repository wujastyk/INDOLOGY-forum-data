It seems to me there is a fallacy in Steve Farmer's contention that no  
civilization with writing lacks longer texts.  The fact is, if any  
civilization committed all its writing to perishable materials, we  
would not know they had writing.  There may be 20 or 30 ancient  
civilizations that had writing about which we have no clue.  Thus one  
cannot argue that if the IV civ. had writing we would necessarily have  
longer texts.  All we know is that they left their symbols on  
specialized seals and on a couple of artifacts (the famous sign).   
Carving something on stone or making a seal is a lot more difficult  
than writing on a palmyra leaf -- there is no reason whatsoever why  
they couldn't have written longer things (like accounts ) on bark or  
some other material that is perishable and easier to write on.  We  
have no long examples of writing in Tamil from Sangam times, yet we  
know that they had writing and wrote longer documents on palmyra  
leaves.  Of course, Farmer et al. have other arguments that need to be  
considered.
