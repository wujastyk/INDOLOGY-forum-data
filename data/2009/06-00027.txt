here,              here (was: Re: What Devanagari text would you most like as an              e-text_
Dear Stephen,
copyright allowing, the one certainly doesn?t rule out the
other. While we would like to have BHSD available in the same

a flat digital text file can easily be extracted from that.
Cheers,
Stefan
