Dear friends,
As an extra favour I would like to ask the following. The Purusha-sukta
mentions the four varnas, seemingly for the first time in the Rig Veda. Are
there other references in the Rig Veda to the four varnas by name, or
perhaps to any of these four separately? And what about the four varnas in
the other Veda-Samhitas or the Brahmanas and Aranyakas?
Thanks again
Victor van Bijlert
