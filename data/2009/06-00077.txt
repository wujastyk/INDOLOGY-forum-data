Models of the *Indo-Aryan migration* discuss scenarios of prehistoric
migrations <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_migrations> of the
early Indo-Aryans <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryans> to their
historically attested areas of settlement in the northwest of the Indian
subcontinent <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent> (i.e. the
area of modern Pakistan <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan>) and from
there further across all of North
India<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India>.
Claims of Indo-Aryan
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_peoples>migration is
primarily drawn from
linguistic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language>[1]<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_migration#cite_note-0>evidence
but also includes a multitude of data stemming from Vedic religion,
rituals, poetics as well as some aspects of social organization and chariot
technology. **

*However, recent extensive studies conducted on **genetics and
archaeogenetics of the South
Asian*<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_and_Archaeogenetics_of_South_Asia>
* population have found no proof of large population migrations, since at
least 10,000 years. *(bold mine)



I wanted to know if somebody is working linking the genetics and indology as
we put it. I am working on theme whether OOA theory handles all the issues
of language etc. and possible harmonisation of both. it seems that OOA holds
that no huge migrations in india in last 10 kys. then how it handles the
indentical language elements among IE languages.

thanks
