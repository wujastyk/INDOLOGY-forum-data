There have been many films on this and in many Indian languages. Gora (dir. Naresh Mitra, 1930, author Tagore(1912),Bengali) is an early example. In the nineties?the Hindi version of a Kerala film/story Kayar ?was serially prsented in the TV. Satyajit Ray's Devi was made in the late fifties, as far as I remember. There are many other similar films made around 1950 particularly those on the Bengali novelist Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's critical novels like 'Bamuner meye'.

I saw it many years ago, but I recall that
my impression was that it followed a
simplified version of the story-line
of Saaya.na-Maadhava's Zrii-ZaNkara-Digvijaya
and that, for all intents and purposes, it 
treated the brahmanical milieu of Kerala as
not needing much social-historical adjustment
(which, for all I know, may be roughly the truth).
