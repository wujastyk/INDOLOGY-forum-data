The Film Adi Shankaracharya
(For the flip-side of this view of brahmanism down south,
there's always Anathamurthy's novel Samskara and the film
Girish Karnad based on it...)
There have been many films on this and in many Indian languages. Gora (dir. Naresh Mitra, 1930, author Tagore(1912),Bengali) is an early example. In the nineties?the Hindi version of a Kerala film/story Kayar ?was serially prsented in the TV. Satyajit Ray's Devi was made in the late fifties, as far as I remember. There are many other similar films made around 1950 particularly those on the Bengali novelist Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's critical novels like 'Bamuner meye'.

Re: The Film Adi Shankaracharya
I saw it many years ago, but I recall that
my impression was that it followed a
simplified version of the story-line
of Saaya.na-Maadhava's Zrii-ZaNkara-Digvijaya
and that, for all intents and purposes, it 
treated the brahmanical milieu of Kerala as
not needing much social-historical adjustment
(which, for all I know, may be roughly the truth).
