Hindi poetry
The general problem with these literary-text websites is that they don't 
give you SOURCES for the etext versions. So even if you find something 
on the internet that claims to be "the text" of a short story or poem, 
you'd be well advised to check it against the best printed text for 
accuracy. (The problem of finding the best printed text is of course 
another whole kettle of fish...)
