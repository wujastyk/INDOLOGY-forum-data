It is with great sadness that I pass on the news of the death of Charles 
Leslie, who pioneered the anthropological understanding of medicine in 
Asia and especially India, and wrote on many topics, always casting 
incisive new light.

Amongst many achievements in a busy professional career, Charles Leslie, 
with A. L. Basham, founded the International Association for the Study of 
Traditional Asian Medicine (www.iastam.org) that continues to thrive. 
IASTAM is holding a conference in Bhutan next month, at which two newly 
inaugurated prizes in Charles Leslie's name will be announced.  Charles 
knew about this, and was in email correspondence about it only a couple of 
weeks ago.

Charles died on Saturday August 15, 2009.  He is survived by Zelda, his 
wife of 63 years, his sons Mario and Sam, his daughter Mira, and 
grandchildren.
