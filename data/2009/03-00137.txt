Translations into Sanskrit
Pr Minkowski, in his Inaugural Lecture for the Boden Professorship at  
Oxford,
tells about the Sulaimaccaitra, the Life of Sulaymaan (King Solomon).
This Sanskrit text was commissioned by prince Laa.dkaan of the
Lodi ruling family in Oudh around 1500. Its first 3 chapters deal with  
King' David's life.
This is not a direct translation of biblical stories,
and it borrows from Arabic versions, but parts of David's story are  
not known from arabic sources.
