Victoria,

One of my forthcoming articles, deals specifically with this topic:

Christian Coseru, Buddhist 'Foundationalism' and the Phenomenology of Perception, _Philosophy East and West_, 59:4 (October 2009): 409-439.

For a more general take on the theme of enactive cognition in Buddhism and Cognitive Science see:

Matthew MacKenzie, Enacting the self: Buddhist and Enactivist approaches to the emergence of the self, _Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences_ May 2009
