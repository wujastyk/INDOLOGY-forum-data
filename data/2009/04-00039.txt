mana in heart or head?
[Dominik replied]
unm?da.
If the head/brain can be considered a vital organ (Dominik suggested not),
then Asanga has this covered, or at least implied in his definition of
unm?da in the Mano-bh?mi of the Yog?c?rabh?mi:
katham unm?dyati | p?rva-karm?k?epatay? dh?tu-vaisamyataya uttr?sa-bhayatay?
marm?bhigh?ta-tay? bh?ta-sam?ve?atay? ||
Or does marm?bhigh?ta have a clearly defined denotation in the medical
literature? In any case, I find his definition intriguing.
