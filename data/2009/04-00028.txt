Fwd: Translations into Sanskrit
Don't some people think a chapter of Vitruvius was translated and incorporated into one of the Vastusastra works?  If so, it would be particularly interesting because it would be from Latin, or at least from Latin through Greek.
I once had a Sanskrit translation of Paul Deussen's Die Elemente der Metaphysik, Eng. trans. Elements of Metaphysics, which I gave to U. Chicago Library, but it seems to have slipped into some cataloging black hole there, since it's not the the Regenstein's online catalog.
