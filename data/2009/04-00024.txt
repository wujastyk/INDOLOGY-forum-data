Subject: mana in heart or head?

It is very difficult to remember the exact details but?at least this much can be said with certainty that the late Debiprasad Chattopadhyay?had pointed out?in?the Lokayata Darshan (Beng.Calcutta 1956) or in its?English version Lokayata:A Study in Indian materialism? (Calcutta,1959), perhaps?in both,?that?Tantrikas who desected human bodies held that the location the mind?was in the skull. In fact their discovery was that the brain is responsible for thought. I read the books in the sixties.

Hi, Peter,

The Bhelasamhita is unique in being an ancient Skt text that locates mind, 
manas, in the head (between the palate and the skull).? References in 
Bhelasamhita ch.8, e.g.,

?irast?lvantaragata? sarvendriyapara? mana? 2cd

and

?rdhva? prakupit? do??? ?irast?lvantare sthit?? 10ab

Best,
Dominik

?? Nowadays in Hindi mana means both the heart and the mind, but I am not sure when it began its migration up into the head as it is now imagined. In particular was it only under the influence of western thought or are there pre-colonial period texts which speak of the seat of thought as being in the head?
