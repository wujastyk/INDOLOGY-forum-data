Octavio Paz
You must be thinking of the following verse by Dharmakirti:
Valmiki dammed the sea with rocks
put into place by monkies,
and Vyasa filled it the arrows shot by Partha;
yet neither is suspected of hyperbole.
On the other hand, I weigh both word and sense
and yet the public sneers and and scorns my work.
O Reputation, I salute thee.
Best wishe,
EF
