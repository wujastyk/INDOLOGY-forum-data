in search for a conference paper
Dear Colleagues,
Does anybody know if the proceedings of the Second Conference on Skanda-Murukan, held in April 2001 in Mauritius have ever been published?
I am looking for a paper by Kanakasabha Venkatasubbu Ravi: Murugan worship according to Kumaratantra Agama.
If anybody happens to have this paper, and could send me a scan off-list, I would be extremely grateful!
Best regards,
Anna Slaczka,
