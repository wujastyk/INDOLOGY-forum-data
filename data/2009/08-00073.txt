ZDMG articles downloadable as single files
Unfortunately that is my experience too with the articles I tried to open recently! I have acrobat Reader 8 and 9 and Writer 7. The earlier attempted ones opened without trouble. It?is not that? the Acrobat Reader or Writer requires updating. They are post-format?recent istallations

Re: ZDMG articles downloadable as single files
It is wonderful to have the ZDMG available for download.? But I downloaded a number of articles, only to find that they could not be opened (by my Acrobat 7) because they were "damaged" and "could not be repaired."? Have others had the same problem, or is it unique to me?

Just scroll down the third column on the right-hand side to the bottom of
the page and you will find all supplementary volumes arranged in a sequence.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
