This episode is also discussed in my article, that I cited in my last 
email.  It's an important and interesting "moment" in the history of 
body-understanding in India.  However, it also needs to be borne in mind 
that, as Jordans showed in his second study on the work, Dayananda's 
autobiography is not what it purports to be, and is not an autobiography.
