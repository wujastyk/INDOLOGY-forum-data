lalaj-jihva
This might not be directly linked to your question but since you  
mentioned other figures:
In Kashikhanda 72.94-100 64 Vetaalas are mentioned, Lalajjihva is  
included in the list.
On Sukula?s map Kashidarpana (1876) Lalajjihva is given in a spatial  
sequence as the second Vetaala of a group of eight in the east.
You might wish to see the entry on the map: www.benares.uni-hd.de (on  
map 69 - popup S92).
