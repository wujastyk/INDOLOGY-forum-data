Greetings to all,

I have been asked if there is some kind of a "standard" edition of the  
Bhagavatapurana to rely upon (for citing and so on). Off hand, I  
didn't know one that may be called a "standard". Or is there a  
published version that serves as a  "majority edition", at least?

All the best
Peter Wyzlic
