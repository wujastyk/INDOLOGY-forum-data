Legal constraints (la "Loi Toubon") [Re: Language barriers              --- financial barriers
MA thesis must be in Italian (I know of only one exception),
whereas PhD thesis are normally written in Italian, but if
the PhD committee members agree they can also be written in
English. In the last five years this happens many times, but
it is by far not the rule.
