term for actors
Dear Stefan,
The MW entry suggests the problem but does nothing to
resolve it:  Aegle Marmelos, is the botanical name of the
bilva, and the .r.si ziluu.sa was clearly a contrivance
in order to supply a basis for the apparent patronymic
zailuu.sa.
I was not aware of Kuijper's article mentioned
by Prof. Witzel and will look it up shortly.
