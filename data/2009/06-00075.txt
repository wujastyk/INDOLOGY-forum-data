small qerry on OOA theory and Indo-european languages
Dear Prof. Pandurangi,
I think this confuses the Out of Africa movement of anatomically  
modern humans,  75-65,000 (75 kya) years ago,
with the spread of Indo-Europeans after c. 3000 BCE (5 kya:  they  
have copper and the newly invented (Sumerian oxen drawn wagon with  
heavy wheels).
There were no Indo-European speakers, nor even their hypothetical  
Nostratic ancestors in 30 kya.
The ocean shores of India (now under water after the Ice Age) were  
occupied around 75-65 kya (a Tamil Nadu find), and Australia by 60-40  
kya, Europe only by 40 kya, driving out the Neanderthals...
No connection either with the so-called Aryan invasion (migration),  
c. 1500 BCE ...
All distinct and clearly marked movements of people and their languages.
Cheers,
MW>
