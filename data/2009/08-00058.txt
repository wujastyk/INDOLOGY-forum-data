Dear Colleagues,

The web-site of the 14th World Sanskrit Conference has recently
been updated. The address is still the same, i.e. the following:

http://www.indology.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/14thWSC/

The pages contain a detailed programme of each section and
a provisional timetable of the conference week. The list of
participants, titles of their papers, and their abstracts are
contained in the following pages:

http://www.indology.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/14thWSC/programme/index.html

We plan to update more practical informations within a few days.

We are sorry for our delay.

Akihiko Akamatsu
