Aditya Behl on the Clay Sanskrit Library
I would like to call the attention of list members to a recent review 
article by Aditya Behl which discusses this recent enterprise which aims 
to present much of classical Sanskrit literature in a format similar to 
Harvard's Loeb classical library of Greek and Latin classics.  I refer 
to the Times Literary Supplement issue June 19 2009, no. 5542.  This is 
the print version, a very prominent front page review.  I do not know 
whether it is available online.
However, I can say that Behl has done a nice job of introducing the Clay 
Sanskrit Library to a general audience.  Unfortunately, this article 
also gives the disturbing news that this series of classical Sanskrit 
texts presented attractively and accessibly in a bilingual format, with 
the Sanskrit text [in simplified sandhi-analyzed form] facing an English 
translation on opposite page, just as in the Harvard Loeb series, is 
about to be discontinued because of poor sales. 
We should all encourage our students to buy Clay editions of these 
Sanskrit texts.  And we all should buy them as well, as much as we can.  
This is a very valuable series which we should all support, in spite of 
its very minor  flaws.
