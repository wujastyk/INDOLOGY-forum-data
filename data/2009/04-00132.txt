pramana
In other Pali texts we have  the list (as a commentary on  
anum???dipa?ikkhepo),
anum?na-atth?patti-?di-ppa?ikkhepo (??k? on the  
A?guttaranik?ya, II 154) respectively anum?na-upam?na- 
atth?patti-?di-pa?ikkhepo (D?ghanik?ya??k?, PTS ed., 307;  
Majjhimanik?ya??k? II 150, S?ratthad?pan? I 323).
Addition: the author of the Vajirabuddhitika uses atth?pattisiddha  
(proven by implication) once as an argument, why something had not  
been expressed.
