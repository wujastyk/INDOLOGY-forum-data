Subject: INDOLOGY updates now on _Twitter_
Message-ID: <161227086139.23782.6154549929279006322.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,

Lately I've been wondering about the best way to quickly provide
updates on the INDOLOGY web site and the SARIT Project &c., so I've
decided to try something new. The existing RSS Feed for the site:

 http://indology.info/rss1.xml

is being replaced by a new RSS Feed courtesy of _Twitter_:

 *RSS Feed of INDOLOGY's Updates*
 http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/38036206.rss

People are asked to update their feed readers and perhaps consider
following our updates through _Twitter_ itself:

 *INDOLOGY on Twitter*
 http://twitter.com/INDOLOGY


For those curious about why _Twitter_ is being tried these links may
be helpful:

 This is how we do it: @nlnz on Twitter (National Library of New
