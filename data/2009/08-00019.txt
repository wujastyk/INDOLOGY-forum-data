Durga with a violin
My reason for thinking it was the sword is the fact that usually some kind of ornament is painted on the blade, mostly something resembling an eye. This could have been misconstrued as the f-shaped ornamental cut in a violin.

My colleague Vladimir Ivanov thinks that it is a misconstructed mace (gada).
