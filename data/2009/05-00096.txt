The Film Adi Shankaracharya
I saw it many years ago, but I recall that
my impression was that it followed a
simplified version of the story-line
of Saaya.na-Maadhava's Zrii-ZaNkara-Digvijaya
and that, for all intents and purposes, it 
treated the brahmanical milieu of Kerala as
not needing much social-historical adjustment
(which, for all I know, may be roughly the truth).
(For the flip-side of this view of brahmanism down south,
there's always Anathamurthy's novel Samskara and the film
Girish Karnad based on it...)
