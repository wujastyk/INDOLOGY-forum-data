Journals Under Threat: organized opposition to evaluation of              journals by the European Reference Index for the Humanities
Dear colleagues,
Since I was much concerned in this issue, I expressed
my own opinion in the latest volume (Vol.9) of SCIAMVS
which I have been editing.
Please read my editorial at:

You can also read A Joint Response from History of
Science, Technology and Medicine Editors.
With best wishes,
Michio Yano
