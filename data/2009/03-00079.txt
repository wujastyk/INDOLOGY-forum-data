H-ASIA: Carol Goldberg Salomon (1948-2009)
I just heard this horrible, unbelievable news here in Albuquerque at the AOS reception.  Carol was my adiguru.  She taught me Bengali for four years, privately, for the ridiculous sum of $8/hour, back in the eighties.  But it was enough to qualify me for an AIIS advanced language fellowship, and the rest as they say is history.  I have very fond memories of riding my bike over to the Salomon's house in Seattle three nights a week for so long, dodging  Jesse and Rich playing football in the living room, and heading for her study to work for an hour.
Like most of us I was blessed with wonderful teachers at every turn, but she was the first, without whom I would probably not have proceeded in the directions I eventually did.
This is a tremendous loss for all of us; Carol taught an awful lot of us Bangla.  And my thoughts and prayers are with Richard and Jesse in this horrible time.
