Chayavyakhya of Nagesha
According to Ram Shankar Bhattacharya (An Introduction to the
Yogasutra,Delhi & Varanasi: Bharatiya Vidya Prakasana, p. 47) is published
in the Bombay Sanskrit and Prakrit Series as vol. no, XLVI. The same source
informs us on pp. 43 and 69 that Nage;sa wrote two commentaries on the
Yogasuutra and that the Chaayaa is the larger one.
It is worth investigating if the Chaayaa commentary actually comes from
Nage;sa's student Vaidyanaatha Paayagu.n.de, since many of the published
commentaries of Vaidyanaatha bear the title Chaayaa.
