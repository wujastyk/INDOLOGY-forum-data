What Whitney Cox points to is a searchable version not of the CPD (Critical Pali
Dictionary), but of the (useful but far less comprehensive, and less critical)
PTS Pali-English Dictionary (of Rhys-Davids and Stede). 

The CPD, begun by Trenckner, on which generations of outstanding Pali scholars
have worked, was and is a lexicographical project of an entirely different 
calibre.
