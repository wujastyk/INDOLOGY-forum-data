Dear Jonathan,

Adding to the replies already sent to the list, I want to mention that  
the Indian astronomical tradition talks about Va?av?mukha, located  
at the south pole of the earth globe in the middle of the ocean of  
fresh water.  It is the entrance to the p?t?las (mentioned by  
Stefan), which are hollow, interior regions of the earth, inhabited by  
N?gas.  At Va?av?mukha burns the va?av?gni, an underwater fire  
emerging from these interior regions.  It is said that the smoke  
arising out of the ocean due to this fire, spreading over the earth  
and being scorched by the rays of the sun, becomes the sparks of  
lightning.

All best wishes,
Toke
