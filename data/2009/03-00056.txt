Dear friends and colleagues,

I'm delighted to announce the upcoming workshop Bilingual Discourse
and Cross-cultural Fertilisation: Sanskrit and Tamil in Mediaeval
India, to be held at Wolfson College, Cambridge University 22 and 23
May, 2009.  The workshop will be convened by Dr. Vincenzo Vergiani
(Cambridge) and myself, and is possible thanks to the financial
support of the British Academy.  Details of the workshop, including
(most of) the participants' abstracts can be found at the following
URL:

Not all of the abstracts are as yet posted (including both of the
convenors'!) so please check back as the date draws nearer.

All are welcome to attend,

Best,

Whitney
