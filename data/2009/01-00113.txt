I meant the animal itself, as distinct from its shell, which of 
course is found all over the place. The conch-demon is S'ankhaasura, 
who was defeated by Vishnu in his Fish Avatara. He is certainly 
depicted in painted sets of Avataras from the 18th-19th century, but 
I haven't got an example to hand.
