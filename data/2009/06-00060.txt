Justinianic Plague in Tamil (or Sanskrit)
A researcher working on the Justinianic Plague (6th-8th century CE) is  
looking for references to it in Tamil -- I am wondering if anyone  
knows of such a source in either Tamil or Sanskrit.  He says that he  
has read that there are references to it in Tamil but does not know  
what they are.  I have not come across them.  George Hart
