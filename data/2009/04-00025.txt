It is very difficult to remember the exact details but?at least this much can be said with certainty that the late Debiprasad Chattopadhyay?had pointed out?in?the Lokayata Darshan (Beng.Calcutta 1956) or in its?English version Lokayata:A Study in Indian materialism? (Calcutta,1959), perhaps?in both,?that?Tantrikas who dissected human bodies held that the location the mind?was in the skull. In fact their discovery was that the brain is responsible for thought. I read the books in the sixties.
The unchecked version may kindly be ignored.

Dear Colleagues,

John has just upgraded his IndUni fonts. All users are encouraged to
replace previous versions.


Best regards,

Richard Mahoney


---------------------------------------------------------------------

April 7, 2009: I have created upgraded versions of my "IndUni" OpenType
fonts. These are Unicode-compliant fonts that contain a comprehensive
set of "Indological" characters, as well as all the European characters
that scholars are likely to need. They are available as freeware, and
include high-quality lookalikes for Times, Palatino, New Century
Schoolbook, Helvetica and Courier. They are based on the freeware fonts
so generously contributed by URW++ of Germany.

The upgraded fonts now contain all the forms required for Avestan, and
a basic set of Greek letters. In addition they contain all the accented
characters specified by MES-1, the smallest of the recognised
Multilingual European Subsets of Unicode; numerous other accented forms
that linguists tend to require; all the accented characters needed for
Pinyin; and a set of Cyrillic characters. This is, of course, in
addition to all the characters known to be used in representing Indian
languages in Roman script. The IndUni-T fonts (the Times-like ones)
also contain versions of j-underdot, used for some Dardic languages.

There was an unfortunate bug in the previous release, resulting in the
omission of non-breaking space. This has been fixed.

The fonts accept input in both "composed" and "decomposed" forms of
Unicode -- e.g. the correct form for "a macron" will be used whether
the document contains the one character U+0101 ("a macron") or the two
characters U+0061 ("a") + U+0304 ("macron"). Since there seems to be
something of a shift in usage under way here, this is a major
advantage.

The fonts can be downloaded from http://bombay.indology.info/.
