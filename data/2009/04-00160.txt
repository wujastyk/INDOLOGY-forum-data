Indus script
Michael --
It seems to me that there is not enough IV "writing" to hope to  
decipher it -- if in fact it is writing.  One possibility is that it a  
system of symbols that nonetheless contains linguistic components.   
For example, my name is "Hart," so if I were to design a family  
device, I'd probably put a heart in it -- or perhaps a deer.  In fact,  
my father did put hearts on the shutters of the house we used to own.   
So the fact that it may simply be symbols does not necessarily mean  
that "six fish" doesn't mean Dravidian *caaRu *miin, "six stars,"  
"pleiades," as that might have been a component of someone's name or  
have something to do with an ancestor's occupation (astrologer?).  In  
any event, without longer "texts" -- which may or may not have ever  
existed -- I don't see how we can know.  George
