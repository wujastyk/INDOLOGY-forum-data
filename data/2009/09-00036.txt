Indian Roman Keyboard for Mac
I have made a unicode keyboard driver for the Mac (OS X -- I'm using  
Snow leopard, but it should run on earlier versions of OS X) that uses  
the forward slash as a dead key and enables easy input of the  
diacriticals for Tamil and Sanskrit (and most other South Asian  
languages).  It is available at http://tamil.berkeley.edu/software.   
The software is in the public domain.
I did this because I suddenly realized that all the diacriticals  
needed for Sanskrit and Tamil are already in unicode and there is no  
need for a special font -- I have used the TimesIndian font for years.
I have developed a Nisus macro, also available from the above website,  
that converts from TimesIndian to unicode for Indian diacriticals.
Hope this proves useful to some.  George Hart
