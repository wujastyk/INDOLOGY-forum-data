At the risk of stating the obvious:
The PDFs of Whitney's "Grammar" (1889) and "Roots" (1885) in the GRETIL
e-library (address below) come with a background text, which you can copy and
paste into Word (e.g.) - and improve from there, if it should not be accurate
enough for your purposes. As for editions of Whitney's "Grammar", I'm not
aware that there have been substantial changes after this one, the "2nd
revised and enlarged edition" of 1889.
Macdonell's "Vedic Grammar" published in the "Grundriss" (1910) is also
available from here as a PDF with background text, but not his "Vedic Grammar
for Students" (which you probably meant).

Does anyone on the list have information on the availability of etexts of:
Macdonell: A Sanskrit Grammar for Students
and
Whitney: Sanskrit Grammar |(5th ed. 1924)
I already have the scanned pdfs but it would be very useful to get an
accurate text document of either of these works. Surely this is a desideratum
to compliment available versions of Whitney's Roots and MW's Dictionary?
