I was thinking of working with a pandit to create some mo3 files with chanted audio of Sanskrit declensions and conjugations for teaching purposes. They would be made freely available on the internet. I haven't yet found anything quite right for that purpose.Has this already been done somewhere?Best,DeanDean Michael AndersonEast West Cultural Institute
