frequencies
Frequency in Sanskrit does not work in the same way as in English and  
other modern languges. It is possible to complie a list of 3000 words  
in English that cover 70-80% of "all" conversations, newspaper  
articles, etc. This is just not possible in the case of Sanskrit--if  
it were possible, it would have been done a long time ago--because the  
vocabulary is highly specialized according to literary genres. On the  
other hand, if one moves within the same genre, one can go back and  
forth hundreds of years without any difficulty, something that cannot  
be done in English, German, French and do on. Hebrew is an exception,  
but this is a special case.
