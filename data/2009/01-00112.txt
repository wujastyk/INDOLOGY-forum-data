invertebrates
Looking with a magnifier, the little orange object in the river
has a tiny man-like being rising out of it and two humanoid legs
below it--as though the conch was an integral part of the being.

Re: invertebrates
Dear Valerie et al.,
example to hand.
here is an example from the University of Virginia Art Museum
(second image from the top):

/Asian/India.html
Unfortunately rather small, and I'm not sure I see the conch,
unless it is the orange object floating in the river in the
bottom left of the painting.
All best,
Stefan
