If you are interested in translations from Tamil into Sanskrit,
you can have a look at the following book:

/Un texte tamoul de d?votion vishnouite: le Tirupp?vai d'?????/, Jean 
FILLIOZAT, Institut Fran?ais d'Indology, Publication N?45, 1972

It contains:

-- an introduction [pp. vii-xxiii]

-- a bibliography [pp. xxiv-xxvii]

-- the (original Tamil) text of the /Tirupp?vai/, along with a French 
translation [pp. 2-31]

-- notes [pp. 33-56]

-- the TIRUPP?VAI SA?SK?T?NUVY?KHY?NAM (by ?r?ra?gar?m?nujasv?mi) [pp. 
57-67]

-- a French translation ("Commentaire perp?tuel sanskrit par 
?r?ra?gar?m?nujasv?mi [pp.69-79]

-- the ?R?VRATA? (TIRUPP?VAI)

-- a French translation (?R?VRATA, LE VOEU DE FORTUNE) [pp. 87-92]

-- an INDEX [pp. 93-116]

In the introduction (p. xxii), Jean Filliozat writes:
"Le /Tirupp?vai/ a ?t? aussi trois fois au moins traduit en sanskrit. ..."

He then gives details concerning the first 2 translations, included in 
the book, and the third one, not included, which exists as a manuscript 
in the EFEO library in Pondicherry (n? EFEO 64).

I should add that the /Tirupp?vai/ is dated by Kamil Zvelebil in the 8th 
century. (/Lexicon of Tamil Literature/, Brill, 1995, p. 685)
