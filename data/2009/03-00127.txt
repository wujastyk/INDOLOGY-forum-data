Translations from Tamil into Sanskrit (Re: Translations into              Sanskrit
If you are interested in translations from Tamil into Sanskrit,
you can have a look at the following book:
/Un texte tamoul de d?votion vishnouite: le Tirupp?vai d'?????/, Jean 
FILLIOZAT, Institut Fran?ais d'Indology, Publication N?45, 1972
It contains:
translation [pp. 2-31]
57-67]
?r?ra?gar?m?nujasv?mi [pp.69-79]
In the introduction (p. xxii), Jean Filliozat writes:
"Le /Tirupp?vai/ a ?t? aussi trois fois au moins traduit en sanskrit. ..."
He then gives details concerning the first 2 translations, included in 
the book, and the third one, not included, which exists as a manuscript 
in the EFEO library in Pondicherry (n? EFEO 64).
I should add that the /Tirupp?vai/ is dated by Kamil Zvelebil in the 8th 
century. (/Lexicon of Tamil Literature/, Brill, 1995, p. 685)
