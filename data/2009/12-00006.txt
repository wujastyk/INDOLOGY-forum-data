Dear Jonathan,

the word p?t?la (both Skt. and Pali) may mean what you are looking
for. MW has:

   one of the 7 regions under the earth and the abode of the N?gas
   or serpents and demons [...] sometimes used as a general N. for
   the lower regions or hells

with, mostly, Epic references. PTSD is more cautious:

   proclivity, cliff, abyss

but the P?t?lasutta (SN IV 206?207) does suggest an interpretation
as ?hell? by reinterpreting it as mental suffering:

   assutav? bhikkhave puthujjano ya? v?cam bh?sati atthi
   mah?samudde p?t?lo ti ta? kho paneta? bhikkhave assutav?
   puthujjano asantam asa?vijjam?nam eva? v?cam bh?sati atthi
   mah?samudde p?t?lo ti. s?r?rik?na? kho etam bhikkhave dukkh?na?
   vedan?na? adhivacana? yad idam p?t?lo ti. [...]

More recently and apparently with reference to this sutta, the
word was understood as ?hell? by Dhammananda Mahathera in his
essay ?The Buddhist Concept of Heaven and Hell?:

   When the average ignorant person makes an assertion to the
   effect that there is a Hell (patala) under the ocean he is
   making a statement which is false and without basis.

Hope that helps,
