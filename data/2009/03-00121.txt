Classical heritages
Dear Brendan,
It's not exactly what you ask, but a little while ago I was thinking 
quantitively about this too, and came up with the estimate that the 
Sanskrit knowledge formation (need a better term) is the product of 
approximately 100 generations of brahmana families.
Best,
