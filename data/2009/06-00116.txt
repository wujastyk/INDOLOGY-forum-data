Yes, I was going to suggest the same place.  It was in Gangwal Park, if I 
remember rightly (may be the same as the location mentioned below).  It 
was founded by "Vyakul" Sharma, who may be no more.  It's an extraordinary 
collection, rich in MSS (there's a catalogue of some of them), including 
alchemical texts, locks, stones, images, and much more.  It's a quirky 
personal collection, and richer for that, reminiscent of the Raj Dinkar 
Kelkar collection in Pune,
