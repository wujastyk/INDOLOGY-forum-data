Language barriers --- financial barriers
For those Sanskritists in search of a suitable German textbook, it may 
be useful to recall what George Abraham Grierson has remarked in his 
review of Bruno Liebich's "Sanskrit-Lesebuch" (1905):
"Again, while the book will introduce Sanskrit to Europeans, it will 
equally well introduce German to Sanskrit Pa??its. If even half-a-dozen 
good Pa??its are helped to acquire German by its pages, it will have 
done excellent work." (Indian Antiquary. Vol. XXXV. Bombay 1906, p. 
184). 
Liebich's Sanskrit Reader can be had for free from 
http://books.google.com.
