Akota bronzes--a few pages please!
With thanks to all, a very kind colleague sent a scan of the few pages I
need. I have not had time to study the plate carefully, but what is curious
is that the scribe/engraver appears indeed to have written not deyadharma-
but devadharma-. Is this a common mistake?
very best thanks to all, jonathan
