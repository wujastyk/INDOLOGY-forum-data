textual sequence
Dear All,
According to my experience the textual sequence in commentaries  
regularly is: text to be commented on (for instance a verse or list  
of terms), commentary on the words or terms of the preceding verse or  
list (prat?kas plus explanations). I now have a P?li commentary  
where it is exactly the other way round (prat?kas plus explanations,  
followed by the text from which the prat?kas are extracted).
I would like to know whether this is  a common feature in  
commentarial literature only unnoticed by me.
Would be thankful for any comments,
Petra
