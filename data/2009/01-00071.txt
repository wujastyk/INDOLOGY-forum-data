"Hitting the branch of the tree on which one sits" (below) sounds like it 
could be a Brueghelian proverb - can you find it in the big painting?

Or, on second thought, maybe it's  a Nepali proverb.

Or both.

<Dutch provincial and very religious universities (fortunately very few of

Should one really feel fortunate that institutions with religious 
orientation are few? Many make a living out of research on their activities 
and on thoughts upon which they have been built up. No matter they are of 
another denomination, it is the genre that supplies bread and butter to 
philologists, to some at least. Hitting the branch of the tree on which one 
sits?
Also the tongue-in-cheek delibearation may be accompanied with sermon on 
some ideal that can be safe from it. That will render "Indology" into a 
proper theological forum.

Good for the Dutch provincial and very religious universities (fortunately
very few of them) to learn something new...
