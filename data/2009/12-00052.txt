Dear George,
Many thanks! Making it work outside the Inbox may require some enhancements. Not so with the several?processors developed over the last ten or fifteen years in India with Unicode characters.?They are user friendly and furnished with directions that are easy to remember. 
Best wishes and Happy New Year to all.

Dear Dipak,
Thank you for explaining this to me and for demonstrating that the program does work.? I will have to explore it more carefully.? If it turns out to be easy to use it will be a very valuable tool.
Best wishes, and Happy New Year to all.
George
