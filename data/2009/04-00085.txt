rAjahaMsa in the ha?sasa?des=?ISO-8859-1?Q?=B4a?=
The notion of a hamsa as a swan was completely discussed a year or so  
ago on the Indo-european research loist and in that context I put up a  
brief visual history of Hamsa on our website at:
http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/Hamsa/hamsa%20index.html
Ravi Varma was simply influenced by the British vision of hasma as  
swan  ("How could a little goose be a devine bird when there are  
swans?" I was once asked by a British "scholar" who shall go nameless)
if you search Google for Anser indicua you will find that the bird is  
question is a very pretty and animated creature that might well  
inspire a sense of divinity. for example see:
