Please excuse if I got this wrong, but I looked up the biography
cited as by one 'Jordans', and in various links come across the
name as spelled Jordens. On amazon there are a few used copies of
one edition of it at a reasonable price. Otherwise, $150.

============================

This episode is also discussed in my article, that I cited in my
last email.  It's an important and interesting "moment" in the
history of body-understanding in India.  However, it also needs
to be borne in mind that, as Jordans showed in his second study
on the work, Dayananda's autobiography is not what it purports to
be, and is not an autobiography.
