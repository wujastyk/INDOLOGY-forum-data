I am grateful for the references, also the ones from the Yoga Upanishads. But they do not explain to me why this bird was selected as a model of a high type of (yogic performer? and) world-renouncer.
But already many thanks

It's the traditional notion of the ha?sa's viveka that is the source  
of comparison:
n?rak??raviveka? ca ha?so vetti na c?para?  
(Garu?apur??a 3,17.48)
Other examples are abundant.
