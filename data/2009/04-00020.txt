mana in heart or head?
Hi, Peter,
The Bhelasamhita is unique in being an ancient Skt text that locates mind, 
manas, in the head (between the palate and the skull).  References in 
Bhelasamhita ch.8, e.g.,
?irast?lvantaragata? sarvendriyapara? mana? 2cd
and
?rdhva? prakupit? do??? ?irast?lvantare sthit?? 10ab
Best,
Dominik

?? Nowadays in Hindi mana means both the heart and the mind, but I am not sure when it began its migration up into the head as it is now imagined. In particular was it only under the influence of western thought or are there pre-colonial period texts which speak of the seat of thought as being in the head?
