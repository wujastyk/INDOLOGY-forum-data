The Indus Civilization is actively studied (by excavations and  
subsequent interpretation) at a  number of Centers. Besides  
institutions in Pakistan and India, these come to mind:

* Harvard/Madison WI    (R. Meadow / M. Kenoyer, 2 decades of  
excavations at Harappa,  some details at: <http://www.harappa.com/>),  
connected also with:

* H. Miller (NY Univ.): esp. rural areas of the Indus. See for  
example: <http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/76529/frontmatter/ 
9780521576529_frontmatter.pdf>

* Kyoto: RHIN (T. Osada team) : <http://www.chikyu.ac.jp/ 
index_e.html>,  in collaboration with several teams in Pakistan and  
India (coming together at yearly conferences: for ex. <http:// 
www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/13thRT.htm>)

* Berlin:  U. Voigt (esp. Baluchistan): see for ex.: <http://www.ufg- 
va.uni-hd.de/forschung/yule_silver.html>

* Aachen (in a more limited way, no excavations: architecture, etc.  
of Mohenjo Daro: M. Janssen, see for ex.
<http://www.jrank.org/history/pages/6333/Mohenjo-daro.html>

Others work in the margins, outside the actual Indus Civ., such as in  
Bannu or E. Rajasthan.

Hope this helps.
