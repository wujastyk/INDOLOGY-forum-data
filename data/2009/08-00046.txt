ZDMG articles downloadable as single files
This is very welcome and worth many thanks. Of course, there is some trouble in opening some of the files I tried. Hope that will go. But I could not find how to search for Supplements. The files opening under Bd.** do not show 'Supplement'. ?Many important publications appeared in the Supplements just as in the 'Erg.-Hefte zur KZ' volumes.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
Vindobonae, die XXI. mensis Novembris MCMLXXXIII.
