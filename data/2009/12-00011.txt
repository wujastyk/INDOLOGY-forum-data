Subject: underwater hell or otherworld
Message-ID: <161227087934.23782.17137568749669313821.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

a friend who is a student of Indo-european and currently working on Welsh
asked me whether there are things like underwater hells in Indic folklore
(she referred for instance to an Irish underwater otherworld)--I don't
recall any such thing, but that may be nothing more than a statement about
my ignorance or bad memory. Any ideas?

thanks, jonathan
