underwater hell or otherworld
a friend who is a student of Indo-european and currently working on Welsh
asked me whether there are things like underwater hells in Indic folklore
(she referred for instance to an Irish underwater otherworld)--I don't
recall any such thing, but that may be nothing more than a statement about
my ignorance or bad memory. Any ideas?
thanks, jonathan
