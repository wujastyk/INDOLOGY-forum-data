"kaapya-" vs. "kaapeya-" (Re: Actual use of gotra (=vr.ddha) and              yuvan
Dear Professor Cardona,
thank you very much for this clarification. I shall try to find the 1963 
book by V.S. Agrawal.
I have a related question, concerning another s?tra, namely PS_4,1.107:
kapi-bodh?d ??girase || PS_4,1.107 || {{Vasu: "The affix 'ya?' comes in 
the sense of a Gotra descendant, after the words /kapi/ and /bodha/, 
when the special descendants of the family of the Angiras are meant."}} 
{{Boehtlingk: "Von /kapi/ und /bodha/, wenn ein ??girasa gemeint ist"}} 
{{Renou: "(Le suffixe secondaire 'ya?' est valable pour former un 
patronymique restreint) apr?s les noms /kapi?/ et /bodha?/ quand il 
s'agit du clan des A?giras." [NOTE EXPLICATIVE: /k?pya?/ 'petit-fils de 
kapi, des A?giras', /baudhya?/ 'petit-fils de Bodha']}}
I see in the 1953 book by John Brough (/The Early Brahmanical System of 
Gotra and Pravara/, Cambridge University Press), on p. 30 (fn. 1) and on 
p. 33, that the "kapis" oscillate between the the /Kevala Angirases/ and 
the /Bharadv?jas/ (exogamous unit VII, subset of "A?girases" [according 
to page 29: "both the Gautamas and the Bh?radv?jas [are classified] 
under the Angirases"]).
I see in the notes by Vasu (p.668 in the 1988 reprint) that the 
specification "??girase" (inside PS_4,1.107) seems to be a criterion for 
choosing either the form /k?pya?/ (if Angiras) or /k?p?ya?/ (if not 
Angiras?).
Is it known in which part of India the form /k?pya?/ was found and in 
which part of India the form /k?p?ya?/  was found?
I am especially interested in the case of Tamil Nadu brahmins, because 
the inside /Karandai Tamil Sangam Plates/ (of king Rajendrachola I) 
[Archaeological survey of India, 1984, K.G. Krishnan (ed.)], 10 
different brahmins (among the 1083 brahmins who are enumerated) have 
"kapi" as their gotra, namely the Brahmins numbered 167, 201, 225, 237, 
239, 306, 439, 906, 937 & 954.
I would be grateful for any comment on actual usage.
