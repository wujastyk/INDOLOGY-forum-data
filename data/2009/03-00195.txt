Dear Colleagues,

Almost all of us are completely dependent on OCLC derived bibliographic
records so this current review should be of some interest.


Best regards,

Greetings colleagues,

The OCLC Review Board on Shared Data Creation and Stewardship seeks the
feedback of the library community on the existing guidelines for record
use, the policy that was proposed in November 2008, and on uses of
records.  Please see the message below from the Review Board Chair,
Jennifer Younger, that will provide more information about the survey.

Please pardon the duplication of this message, as the Review Board hopes
to reach all those interested in this issue.  Please feel free to

Thank you for your time and input,
Ted Schwitzner
OCLC Members Council Delegate (ILLINET) and Review Board Member


Dear Colleague:

As chair of the OCLC Review Board of Shared Data Creation and
Stewardship, I invite you to participate in a Web-based survey among
librarians and other interested constituents. The primary goal of this
survey is to gather input from both OCLC members and non-members about a
proposed OCLC policy, Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat(r)
Records.

The Review Board will consider the results of this survey in its
recommendations to OCLC. 

Please review the existing guidelines and proposed policy if you have
not already done so:

*	Guidelines:
http://www.oclc.org/support/documentation/worldcat/records/guidelines/default.htm

*	Proposed Policy:
http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/catalog/policy/recordusepolicy.pdf


The OCLC Review Board is an independent committee convened by the OCLC
Board of Trustees and the OCLC Members Council. If you wish to find out
more about the Review Board, please visit these links:

The survey is available online at the following site, where you will
find specific instructions on completing the survey:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=c0hILWPafv97EDbNiRXXjg_3d_3d

I invite you to complete this survey yourself or forward it to a
colleague with an interest in this issue. Your opinions and comments are
vital to our evaluation, regardless of your current level of usage of
OCLC services or your relationship to OCLC.

Please complete the questionnaire online by April 8, 2009. To protect
the confidentiality of your responses, all data will be collected,
tabulated, and analyzed by Linray, an independent market research
consultant. We will receive data in aggregate form only; your answers
will not be associated in any way with you or your organization.

If you have questions about the content of the survey, please send an
e-mail to reviewboard at oclc.org. As an alternative to the survey, we
welcome your feedback by sending an e-mail to reviewboard at oclc.org or
posting comments at http://community.oclc.org/reviewboard/. Please feel
free to provide input in the language of your choice.

Thank you for your participation in this survey.

Sincerely,

Jennifer A. Younger
