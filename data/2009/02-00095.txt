The holiness of Sanskrit derives from the fact that it is the medium of
communication of Brahminical values, and it is the language of ritual and of
the mantras. Of course, even Sanskrit is constantly 'polluted' by the
vernaculars.
The idea of modern Sanskrit as a spoken language is, to my mind, an
interesting example of Brahminical invention of tradition.

That makes it even more interesting to perform statistical tests. When you
read Latin descriptions of new species in the 19th century, you can't help
seeing a native language substratum underlying this 'Latin'. Why this
wouldn't have been the case for Sanskrit? Everybody repeats the same,
Sanskrit is pure, holy and so on, but has this ever been measured? Being
holy doesn't make it vulnerable to impacts from a 'lower' level, including
the bazaar, if you like. Also Sanskrit suffered from an evolution from
within, so to say.
(I'm not a linguist either; even if my phd is on a linguistic subject, I'm
more interested in the statistics of language use than in the derivation
of word stems :-) ).
