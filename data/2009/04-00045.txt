mana in heart or head?
Yes, you're right, Eli, of course.  Really, one is dealing with a quite 
different model of the inner man.
By the by, the common phrase "body, mind, and spirit" is a categorization 
that is never used in Sanskrit, to my knowledge.  It occurs so often in 
secondary literature, but to me it is normally a sign that the writer is 
not "thinking in Sanskrit".
And in your note below, "soul" translates buddhi? Or citta?
