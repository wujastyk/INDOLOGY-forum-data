I have recently noticed a range of ipod/iphone
products in Sanskrit. Of course, there is
great potential for development along these 
lines. Here are a few initial notes on what's
on offer from the itunes application store:

Free download of the Bhagavad Gita, from Krishna
Varma, devanagari and English trans.
It's free -- check it out!

The Rig Veda in Sanskrit, from Credencys Solutions Inc.,
costs US $0.99
The complete Rig Veda in Devanagari and transliteration!
Unfortunately, it's not worth the 99cents they charge for
it. Mistakes, in both nagari and roman, abound
right from the words agnim ile... I want
my paisa back!

Patanjali Yog Sutra from Vaidik Living
US $4.99
The sutras in Skt and English. Evidently for
the new age yoga set. I decided to save
my five bucks.

Pocket Vedabase from Dancing Ganesh.
US $24.99 
Relatively expensive for an iphone download,
but there's a lot here, in the A.C. Bhaktivedanta
Krishna Consciousness mode: roman skt. and trans.
of Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, Caitanya Caritamrta
and more. I've not downloaded it myself, so there's nothing
else I can say.

If you search the itunes store under "Sanskrit" you'll
find more -- mostly devanagari tutors and stotras.

But I call this to everyone's attention because there
is the prospect here for fine teaching and reference
tools that one can carry in one's pocket.
