Krishna as Vishnu
Friends:
I am researching multi-arm images of Krishna.
It seems to be that at some point Krishna ceases to be an avatara and becomes Vishnu himself.
A case in point is Jagganath Puri where Krishna is Jagganath, an appellation reserved for Vishnu.
A Nepali stone image (?12 th century) that I recently saw shows Krishna with 8 arms holding even a Sudarshan chakra.
Am I on the right track? Any help would be appreciated.
Regards.
