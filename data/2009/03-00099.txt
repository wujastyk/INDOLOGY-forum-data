If you want your work to be accessible to linguistically disjoint  
audiences, why write it up in just one language?   In smaller  
European countries it is, or at any rate used to be, usual to publish  
one's work both in English (or German) in an international journal,  
and locally in the national language.  For English-speaking  
Indologists, the comparable practice would be to publish both an  
English version in an international journal or book, and a Hindi,  
Tamil, or Sanskrit version in India.  As Jan Houben reported here on  
March 3, summaries of the talks at the recent Third International  
Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Symposium were made available both  
in English and in Sanskrit.  The traditional philologists and pandits  
who attended the conference welcomed the Sanskrit version as a step  
to overcoming the language barrier and establishing mutual  
understanding with English-speaking Indologists and computational  
linguists.
