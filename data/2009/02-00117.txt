AW: "Visit SANSKNET while you can"
I tried to download the Sanskrit fonts for the website and then read the
texts, but it failed. What is the exact procedure?

You probably have to configure your Browser: Click "View / Encoding" and
select "Western ISO 8859-1". If that doesn't work, try any other - except
"Unicode".
