yugas and colours
A scholar who's done a good deal of work on the 'echt-colors' (if
I may call them that) 
is Nick Allen, with respect to Dumezil's tripartite IE functions.
See for ex.:
Allen, N.J. 
1998c	Varnas, colours and functions: expanding Dum?zil?s
schema.  Z. f?r Religionswissenschaft 6: 163-177. 
Another comparative source is Berlin & Kay, Basic Color Terms:
Their Universality and Evolution.
Best,

Re: yugas and colours
Just noticed this discussion, and it brought to mind the not
unrelated fact that the faces of the Buddha Kaalachakra and the
dirctional colors in his mandala palace are precisely those,
front-east black, right-south red, back-west yellow, left-north
white. ince his body is supposed to represent all the "parts" of
time, fitting that his faces represent the yugas.
That mandala is the only one in the Tibetan collection that I
know of that uses those colors for the faces and directions.
