the west
Could anyone provide a few references to Sanskrit texts (Brahmanas,
Aranyakas, Shrautasutras, Shulbasutras) in which the West as point of the
compass has any symbolic meaning as the place of death or as an inauscipious
or impure direction. Early tantra references would also be welcome.
Thanks a lot for the previous references on Buddha Amitabha.
Warm greetings
Victor van Bijlert
