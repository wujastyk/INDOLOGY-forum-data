here,              here (was: Re: What Devanagari text would you most like as an              e-text_
Dear all,
I have a scanned copy of the BHSD in .pdf and .jpg that could serve as a 
basis for an e-text (provided the copyright issues are settled; this 
scan I did myself from the Motilal publication).  However, this file is 
_very_ big, running over half a gig.  I'm not quite sure how to reduce 
the size in a way that preserves the quality of the text.  Please let me 
know if these files could be of some use.
Best,
