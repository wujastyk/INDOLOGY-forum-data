Caraka-Samhita, English translation - help requested
The premier libraries are digitalizing old publications in their possession. The Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan,WB aimed at publications dating before 1924. The task is going on. I have not found it necessary to use the digital library of the VIsva Bharati. But you may enquire at <visva-bharati at visva-bharati.ac.in>.
You may, perhaps, also enquire at the National Library and the Asiatic Society
<aslibcal at cal.vsnl.net.in>,
both at Kolkata. I may enquire at the last mentioned Institute. But, then, ?for any positive result?I have to be at Kolkata that may not happen before mid-June.

Caraka-Samhita, English translation - help requested
The first volume with parts 1-32 of Kisari Mohan Ganguli's English
translation of the Caraka-Samhita can now be downloaded from the GRETIL
e-library (address see below).
Volume 2 with parts 33-60 is in the pipeline, but will take some time due to
the poor print quality of the original, which hampers the recognition rate of
the background text of both e-books.
Unfortunately, this library has never received the remaining parts (61-68) of
Ganguli's translation. Would someone be so kind as to tell me from where good
copies or scans can be ordered so I can eventually complete the e-book?
[By the way, Ganguli's translation is often ascribed to the publisher,
Avinash Chandra Kaviratna - much like Ganguli's translation of the
Mahabharata, which is usually ascribed to Pratap Candra Roy.]

The managers of the ZDMG digital edition website have announced that they
will be providing PDF download facilities, certainly for pages, and if
possible also for individual articles.? It is in the pipeline.
