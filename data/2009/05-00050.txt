Syntax of Dative
Dear Colleagues
I am looking for some scholarly discussion on the use of datives with verbs like vidmahe and dh?mahi found in the late G?yatr?s as found in texts like the Taittir?iya Ara?yaka, e.g.  ?????????? ??????? ???????? ????? / ????? ?????? ?????????? //  The use of dative in these late G?yatr?s contrasts with the accusative in the old G?yatr? : ??? ?????????????? ????? ?????? ?????.  I am looking for any scholarly discussion of this shift (?).  Didn't see anything in Speyer/Speijer.  Best,
Madhav M. Deshpande
