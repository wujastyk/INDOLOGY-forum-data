 From ParipaTal 3, about the 3rd or 4th century BCE:
Your wonder is such that you are counted through four kinds of
eons: zero, quarter, half, one, two three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine!  Black one with red eyes!  White one with
black eyes!  Green one with golden eyes!  Dark one with green
eyes!
