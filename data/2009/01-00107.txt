FONTS> Upgraded IndUni fonts
The maintainers of the INDOLOGY.info and Bombay.indology.info websites 
have had a very small number of queries (2) from people who have not been 
able to download and install the newly updated IndUni fonts.  We have 
checked and triple-checked the fonts and the download functions, including 
using a variety of host operating systems etc.  We cannot reproduce any of 
the difficulties.  The servers that run the indology.info domain are 
running well, and report no hiccups in service recently.
If you have a problem fetching or installing the IndUni fonts from 
bombay.indology.info, please turn in the first instance to your local 
computer support for help.  If that fails, please ask your computer 
support person to contact Richard Mahoney, John Smith or myself.
Many thanks, and good luck!
