mana in heart or head
It may be worthwhile here to
recall Swami Dayananda Sarasvati's
effort to locate the cakras and all 
the apparatus of the suksmasarira
in a corpse that he found floating 
past him, an event that propelled him
to revise his views of received tradition.
The episode is discussed in JTF Jordan's
biographical study of the Swami.
