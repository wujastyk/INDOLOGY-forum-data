frequencies
These are very interesting, and no doubt useful. But a quick glance will
assure anyone that they are not based on frequency. Is it possible that
k?ura is one of the most common words in Skt? It seems to me more likely--I
didn't look around to see if this is explained--that this is vocabulary for
some reader. So the question of the collection of 'basic vocabulary' in the
sense of a list of the most frequent  words (perhaps by genre?) remains a
desideratum. But some linguistic must have compiled such a list, no?
