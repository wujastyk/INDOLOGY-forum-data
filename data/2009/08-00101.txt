Follow up to Font/Print Problems
Dear Colleague,
?
Please forgive this digression. Has there been any change in Unicode's Indian fonts? I am experiencing a new problem which is stated below.
?
System and hardware Windows XP in a Compaq PC installed 31.01.09
??????????? 
For Devnagari and diacritics Window supported i-LEAP Fonts 
?
Problem
?
The retroflex sibilant is normally shown as ? but often this is automatically changing to an underlined z without any effort on my part. This cannot be recovered as the retroflex sibilant. It just takes?sometime to get back the desired letter.
?
Could anybody explain?
Best
DB

... is it possible that what you're seeing here has something to do
with unicode character normalisation, i.e., that r underdot, say, or a
macron &c. are being displayed by Vista in their `decomposed' form,
rather than as combining characters. For background on all this please
see:
Unicode Standard Annex #15 :: Unicode Normalization Forms
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/
And possibly:

Admittedly nothing more than a stab in the dark but ...
Kind regards,
