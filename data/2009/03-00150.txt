For a sanskrit tranlation of the Bible see:

The Holy Bible in the sanskrit language... translated out of the original tongues [ibrIya-bhASAtaH : from the Hebrew language] by the Calcutta Baptist Missionaries, with native assistants; printed at the Baptist Mission Press (See http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/baptmisspress/bmp.htm), circular road; Calcutta

The copy I have in my hands was withdrawn from the Bowdoin College Library,to which it had been given by Rev. James L. Phillips, from Bapt. missn. India, acq. 1873. All volumes seem to be first (and only) editions... 
(about James L. Phillips, see http://abacus.bates.edu/Library/aboutladd/departments/special/SubjectGuides/FWB.shtml)

1848 (vol 1)Five books of Moses and the book of Joshua
ibrIya-bhASAto vyAkRtaH / dharma-granthaH /tasya prathamaM khaNDaM / yad vA / mUsasA racitaM grantha-paJcakaM / yihozUya-pustakaJ ca 
[414 pp. written throughout in prosa]

1852 (vol 2)The historical books from judges to Esther
ibrIya-bhASAto vyAkRtaH / dharma-granthaH / tasya dvitIyaM khaNDaM / yad vA / yihozUyasya maraNAt param isrAyelIya-lokAnAM purAvRtta-pustaka-saGgrahaH
[493 pp. mainly prosa, with interspersed verses]

1858 (vol 3)The poetical and devotional books from Job to Canticles,
ibrIya-bhASAto vyAkRtaH / dharma-granthaH / tasya tRtIyaM khaNDaM / yad vA / AyUvasya caritra-pustakaM / gIta-saMhitA / rAjJA sulemanA racitAni kavyAni ca
[344 pp. written throughout in verses (epic zloka)] 

1872 (vol 4)The prophetical books
ibrIya-bhASAto vyAkRtaH / dharma-granthaH /tasya caturthaM khaNDaM / yad vA / yizAyiyAdInAM bhaviSyad-vAdinAM / grantha-saGgrahaH
[538 pp. verses and prosa interspersed]

Character is Nagari, saMdhi is often neglected for the sake of clarity, words being separated in a fashion reminding of DD Kosambi's edition(s) of Bhartrhari's. Translations are accurate and the sanskrit is correct. Luckily, in contradistinction with a lot of works printed in India during this period, the paper is still very good...

For a translation of the New Testament [yUnAnIya-bhASAtaH 'from the greek language'], we have by the same publishers :
1851 The New Testament of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (second edition)
prabhunA yIzukhrISTena nirUpitasya nUtana-dharmma-niyamasya grantha-saGgrahaH
IMlaNDIya-vaGgadezIya-paNDitair yUnAnIya-bhASAto vyAkRtaH  
[700 pp. all prosa]

Was this New Testament a library success ? On the reverse of the title page, we get the following figures :
Testament Complete: 1st Edition Copies 1000 / 2nd Edition    "   2500
Four Gospels and the Acts : 1st Edition 500 / 2nd Edition 1500 / 3rd  Edition  2500
Four gospels and the Acts separately: 1st Edition  19500 / 2nd Edition  12500 / 3rd Edition  12500
Luke and Acts, together: one Edition 1500

For those interested, here is a sample of the sanskrit text (Genesis 3, beginning)

Objet : Re: Translations into Sanskrit


There is Sanskrit translation of the Bible, printed in the grantha script, from 1863. Perhaps there are earlier ones.
If I remember correctly, Sylvain Levi discusses some evidence for the translation of the Alexander Legend into Sanskrit in the early centuries CE.
Best wishes,
