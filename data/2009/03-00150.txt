Bible and New Testament: translations from hebrew and greek to              sanskrit
For a sanskrit tranlation of the Bible see:
The Holy Bible in the sanskrit language... translated out of the original tongues [ibrIya-bhASAtaH : from the Hebrew language] by the Calcutta Baptist Missionaries, with native assistants; printed at the Baptist Mission Press (See http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/baptmisspress/bmp.htm), circular road; Calcutta
The copy I have in my hands was withdrawn from the Bowdoin College Library,to which it had been given by Rev. James L. Phillips, from Bapt. missn. India, acq. 1873. All volumes seem to be first (and only) editions... 
(about James L. Phillips, see http://abacus.bates.edu/Library/aboutladd/departments/special/SubjectGuides/FWB.shtml)
1848 (vol 1)Five books of Moses and the book of Joshua

Character is Nagari, saMdhi is often neglected for the sake of clarity, words being separated in a fashion reminding of DD Kosambi's edition(s) of Bhartrhari's. Translations are accurate and the sanskrit is correct. Luckily, in contradistinction with a lot of works printed in India during this period, the paper is still very good...
For a translation of the New Testament [yUnAnIya-bhASAtaH 'from the greek language'], we have by the same publishers :
1851 The New Testament of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (second edition)
prabhunA yIzukhrISTena nirUpitasya nUtana-dharmma-niyamasya grantha-saGgrahaH
IMlaNDIya-vaGgadezIya-paNDitair yUnAnIya-bhASAto vyAkRtaH  
[700 pp. all prosa]
Was this New Testament a library success ? On the reverse of the title page, we get the following figures :
Testament Complete: 1st Edition Copies 1000 / 2nd Edition    "   2500
Four Gospels and the Acts : 1st Edition 500 / 2nd Edition 1500 / 3rd  Edition  2500
Four gospels and the Acts separately: 1st Edition  19500 / 2nd Edition  12500 / 3rd Edition  12500
Luke and Acts, together: one Edition 1500

Objet : Re: Translations into Sanskrit
There is Sanskrit translation of the Bible, printed in the grantha script, from 1863. Perhaps there are earlier ones.
If I remember correctly, Sylvain Levi discusses some evidence for the translation of the Alexander Legend into Sanskrit in the early centuries CE.
Best wishes,
