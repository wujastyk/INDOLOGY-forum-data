Journals Under Threat: organized opposition to evaluation of              journals by the European Reference Index for the Humanities
An extremely important initiative has been taken this January to oppose 
the application of the criteria of the European Reference Index for the 
Humanities (ERIH) to journals on the history of science and science 
studies.
The editors of fifty-six prominent journals in these fields have joined 
together to refuse to cooperate with the ERIH project, and to refuse to 
allow work in their journals to be appraised by ERIH. They have formally 
requested ERIH to remove these journals from the ERIH listings.
The Indian Journal of the History of Science is a signatory to this 
opposition, I am proud to say.

There was some discussion in this forum last year about similar problems 
affecting Asian Studies journals in Australia.
The Journals Under Threat initiative shows, I believe, that concerted 
action at a high level, and especially cooperation between the editors of 
journals in a particular field, can be powerfully effective.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
