It arrived last week, and I'm delighted.  Over 830 pages with a 
newly-added subject index.

Since Routledge's decision to reprint this 2-volume Sanskrit course as an 
affordable single-volume paperback was taken as a result of the urging of 
several members of this INDOLOGY forum, I hope we will support the 
purchase of the book as appropriate.

see your local store, or

Best,
