Untoucables in Classical Tamil Society? (Re: New discovery in              Tamil Nadu)
I do not think that this is a fair summary of
(or a sufficient comment on)
V.S. Rajam's article
(which appeared in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 
106, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1986), pp. 257-272
and which is available on JSTOR at
<http://www.jstor.org/stable/601590>
I shall simply say that
all my colleagues who can read original Tamil sources
and with whom I have spoken about V.S. Rajam's article
think that it is an excellent article
and that many of the points of view expressed by G.Hart
are superseded by the points of view expressed in this article.
Quoting the Madras Tamil Lexicon (MTL)
as a comment on VSR's article
is simply insufficient
because the MTL is a compilation based on various sources
and does not have an authority which would be independant
from the authority that those sources possess.
And the DED is itself a preliminary compilation of various dictionaries.
Therefore, the ongoing collective thought process, as far as a?a?ku 
(??????) is concerned, is:
the available philological data
However, since I have the impression that everybody on the Indology list
has had enough of that thread,
I shall simply recommend
as Step 5
to anyone interested
in the topic of a?a?ku (??????) to read V.S. Rajam's article
and to form their own opinion.
I believe the best way a debate on a mailing list can end
is when one receives an incentive for further reading.
Best wishes
