Aditya Behl on the Clay Sanskrit Library
All--
How terribly unfortunate for Indologists and general readers alike!  These
volumes are so useful.  I had planned to order one as a course-text for a
class I'm teaching in the fall, so I hope it's still available.  Will the
press continue to print and sell the final 56 volumes indefinitely?

Dear Colleagues,
The TLS review of the CSL is available on the press page of our CSL
website:
http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/press.php.
Aditya Behl's piece (
http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/press/CSL_TLSReview_200906.php) does
not
actually say that the series is being discontinued because of poor sales,
although one can see how that inference might have been drawn from his
adjacent mention of the quarrel between Lakshmi and Sarasvati.
The series has indeed now been closed down, as of June 30 just gone,
although we are still sending a last clutch of new titles to press to
appear
on bookshelves in September (
http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes.php?show=12).
The final list will comprise 56 volumes:

Yours truly,
