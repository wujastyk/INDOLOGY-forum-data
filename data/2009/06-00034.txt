If I remember well, this is not quite true. Like most careful philologists,
FE  referred directly to PW and pw, not to MW. Or do I remember wrongly?

Correct! No more than 5 references to Monier Williams in the entire
dictionary (see pp. 182, 218, 249, 420, 508), against roughly 400 to "pw"
(none to "PW").
