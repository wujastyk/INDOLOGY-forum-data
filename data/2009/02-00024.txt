"samsara" meaning "life"
The Hindi world maps they sell here in India use the word "samsaara" on 
them for "world". Or maybe "samsaar", I don't have one in front of me.
Although they show the planet quite accurately, they don't seem to have 
an 'exit' marked anywhere, so they aren't much use for religious purposes.
