Follow up to Font/Print Problems
For several years, I have had great success with Word 2003 using Arial MS Unicode and Baraha (under both Vista and XP)--both my screen and my printer happily display devanagari and diacritics (some conjuncts are not available, however).  I recently shifted to Word 2007, and it was a disaster.  I decided Word 2007 simply was not worth the trouble of trying to figure all this out, and I went back to 2003. After I finish my current project, I plan to shift to open office.
