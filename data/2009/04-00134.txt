pramanas
Dear Elisa,
It looks like Mimamsa to me because of the arthapatti introduced, as far as I know, in this school (though later accepted by Vedanta). A Buddhist author of this Pali text may just mention some (most important) pramanas of Mimamsa, not giving a full formal list.
It will be very important to know more about this Pali text.
