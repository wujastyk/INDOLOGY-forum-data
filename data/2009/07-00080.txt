Dear Mary Storm,

I made a translation of the BG myself with good, clear Devanagari followed
by a translation (see comments on Amazon.com by reviewers). No comments, as
my American publisher wants to keep his editions compact. However, there are
several commented editions of the Gita. Here are a few suggestions:

My own translation at Amazon Britain:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bhagavad-Gita-Lars-Martin-Fosse/dp/0971646678/ref=sr
_1_16?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1248171367&sr=1-16

Or at Amazon USA:

http://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-Lars-Martin-Fosse/dp/0971646678/ref=sr_1
_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1248171589&sr=1-1

Others:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bhagavad-gita-Harvard-Paperback-F-Edgerton/dp/067406
9250/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1248171407&sr=1-3

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0873958306/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk

http://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-Commentary-Sri-Sankaracharya/dp/81852080
85/ref=sr_1_37?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1248171872&sr=1-37

Both Laurie Patton and George Thompson have delivered good, modern
translations of the Gita, but without the Sanskrit text. You can look them
up at Amazon.

Editions with romanized Sanskrit and commentary:

http://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-Commentary-Based-Original-Sources/dp/019
8265220/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1248172162&sr=1-2

Radhakrishnan has also made a translation with romanized Sanskrit and an
extensive commentary, but I am unable to find his book on Amazon. You could
try abebooks.com. 

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
