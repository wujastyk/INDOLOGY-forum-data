Sanskrit courses in India, between June and mid September
Dear all,
some Sanskrit students from Oslo will be in India from (ca.) June to  
mid September, eager to participate in (beginners') Sanskrit courses,  
spoken Sanskrit courses etc. I'd be grateful for suggestions and  
contact addresses.
Sincerely
Ute Huesken
