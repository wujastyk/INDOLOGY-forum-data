I use a Mac, but this must be the same or very similar on a PC.  I can  
right-click on each page and save each page as an image file.  Then, I  
can print each page separately from there (and most image programs can  
automatically scale the image to your paper size).

Of course, this is cumbersome (but not obnoxiously so, especially if  
you have a fast internet connection).  For someone like me who doesn't  
have easy access to this journal (only through inter-library loan or a  
4-5 hour drive), I think this free resource is fabulous and it strikes  
me as completely reasonable that they do not allow downloads.

Best,

Steven
