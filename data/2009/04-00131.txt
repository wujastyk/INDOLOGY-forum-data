RV 10.124.9
b?bhats??n?? say?ja? ha?s?m ?hur ap??? divy??n?? sakhiy? c?rantam
anu???bham ?nu carc?ry?m??am ?ndra? n? cikyu? kav?yo man????

and RV 4.40.5
ha?s?? ?uci??d v?sur antarik?as?d dh?t? vedi??d ?tithir duro?as?t
nr???d varas?d r?tas?d v?omas?d abj??goj??r?taj??adrij??r?t?m

The first one describes in this way Indra identified with the sun; the 
second one describes the horse DadhikrA'van identified with the sun and 
Agni. In both cases 'swan' refers to the divine being who is in the sky 
or in the space. At RV 10.124.9 the god is cognised by the seers, at RV 
4.40.5 the horse remains within men (nr???d) which also implies 
possibility of its cognition (if not its ontic presence within human 
beings).

These Vedic antecedents include not only the oldest upanisads [BAU, ChU], as well as later upanisads [KaU & ShvetU] but many YV texts as well [KS, MS, VS, TB].   But even in oldest Vedic [RV] the term hamsa  is already well-attested [16 times] and in every stratum of the RV.

Of course, these linguistic origins do not tell us what sort of bird the Sanskrit term hamsa refers to, but they do suggest
