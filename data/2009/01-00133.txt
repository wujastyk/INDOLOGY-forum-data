chanted audio of sanskrit declensions and conjugations?
http://www.loyno.edu/~tccahill/skt_sound_files.html
Contains about 50 nouns and 20 verbs in mp3 format. The
quality isn't great since most of the recordings were made
in 1981-82. Some students have found them useful, but making
one's own is always best!
best,
