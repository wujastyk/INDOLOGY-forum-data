Machine-readable version of the Mahabharata and Prof. Daniel              Ingalls
Dear George et al,
I imagine the Tokunaga/Smith electronic version of the MBH (http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/statement.html 
) is sufficient for most basic scholarly purposes? it contains many of  
the supplementary ("starred")passages, though not all of the variant  
readings, I believe.
There was some controversy during its editing at BORI which others on  
the list might be better equipped to discuss. But as of now, this e- 
text is freely available. The Critical Edition itself is still under  
copyright in India, and BORI still actively sells copies--so I would  
strongly advise against scanning a graphic version without seeking  
permission.
All best wishes,
