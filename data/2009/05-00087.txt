Akota bronzes--a few pages please!
Dear Jonathan,
the G?ndh?r? form devasama? occurs in line 11 of Se?avarma?s
reliquary inscription, see here:
   http://ebmp.org/a_inscription.php?catid=CKI0249
In his 1986 edition of this inscription (p. 280), Rich gives some
further references. (Von Hin?ber does not comment on this form in
his 2003 edition of Se?avarma.) For the apparently Eastern sound
change of intervocalic y to v (reflected in Pali ?vuso, t?vati?sa,
etc.) that may be operative here see von Hin?ber, ?lteres
Mittelindisch, ? 214. This word also occurs contracted to desama-
in the Taxila silver scroll:
   http://ebmp.org/a_inscription.php?catid=CKI0060
and elsewhere, so at least in the Northwestern parts the identity
of the first part of the compound appears to have become unclear
fairly early on, making possible the (presumably) folk etymology
connecting it with deva?.
Best wishes,
Stefan
