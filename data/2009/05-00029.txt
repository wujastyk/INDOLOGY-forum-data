Question on digital epigraphy
Dear Colleagues,
checking some internet resources for Indian epigraphy,
I came across an interesting example of digital hybrid:
the item so-called "EPO [sic] GRAPHIA BIRMANICA VOL 4 PART 2 (1973)"
http://www.archive.org/details/epographiabirman014758mbp
appears to mix
1?) the additional plates to Epigraphia Birmanica 
IV/1, 1936 ["EPIGRAPHIA BIRMANICA"], the 
preceding part being available at
http://www.archive.org/details/epigraphiabirman014350mbp
2?) An incomplete index (p. 103-171, letters M to 
V) of places, names and realia referring 
obviously to inscriptions from Karnataka, under 
the form: Date (from 1909 to 1920), P. + a number 
(two digits)
I am very interested by this index, where I would 
like to know to which refers this:
"Santima, Island, 1910, P. 28"
So thank you in advance for helping me to 
identify both the source-index and the reference 
(some volume of the ARMAD?),
