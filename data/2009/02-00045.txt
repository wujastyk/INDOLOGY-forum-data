The files on bombay.indology.info have been checked and re-checked, and we 
have tested the downloads on several machines and operating systems.  They 
are not corrupt.

If you have trouble downloading or unpacking these files, please seek help 
from your local computer support person (for many of us that means a 
12-year-old nephew :-)
