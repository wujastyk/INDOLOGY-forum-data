time to change the tune
I find the use of the Indology list
by our colleagues in Germany to be
tiresome in the extreme and not 
to accord very well with the purposes 
for which Indology was established.
If this continues much longer, I, for
one, will withdraw my name from the subscription list.
Perhaps a separate listserve dedicated to
settling scores in Germany should be contemplated,
so that those interested in this will have
their own playpen.
