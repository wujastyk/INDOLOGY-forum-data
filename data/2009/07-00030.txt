Nubian tribe?
Perhaps the following?is a different case or may be the one Allen refers to, it should be related.
D.D.Kosambi (junior; Introd. Study.Ind.History 1956)?was duped by the fraud. In an otherwise eulogistic review (JAOS) Ingalls had referred to the fraud and to what he regarded as Kosambi's blunder. As far as I remember the review appeared sometime before 1958. I read it in 1966.
Best for all

Re: Nubian tribe?
Could this have something to do with the 19th c. fraud I seem to recall which interpolated a mention of the sources of the Nile into an older text?? I vaguely remember that Daniel Ingalls touched on this in a brief article on Sanskrit frauds in JAOS, but am not having any success locating the citation at the moment.? Perhaps someone else will remember.

Friends, an Arabist colleague writes to me as follows:
I'm writing an encyclopaedia article about a Nubian tribe known as Barabra
which lived along the Nile river in southern Egypt and the Sudan. Now I came
across a reference that "Sanskrit historians write already about the Old
Race of the Barabra living along the Upper Nile." Do you have any idea where
I could find out what and when and who?
I don't have any idea, but can anyone help?
