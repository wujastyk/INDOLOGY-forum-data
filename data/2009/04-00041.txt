Name that verse!
Friends,
I have heard that this verse occurs in the HanumannATaka also known as 
MahAnATaka. Anyway it has to be verified.
The correct reading of the first half is:
jaanaami dharma.m na ca me prav.rtti.h .
jaanaamyadharma.m na ca me niv.rtti.h .
Thanks

Name that verse!
Dear friends,
It's time to play the perennially pleasant
Indological game of "can you identify the
source of this verse?" It's one that
I learned orally long ago, and, if I recall
correctly, it was attributed to one or another
Deviitantra. I am not awarding prizes for the
the successful entry, but I will be grateful
for the reference:
dharm.m janaamy aha.m, na ca me prav.rtti.h
adharma.m janaamy aha.m, na ca me niv.rtti.h
thanks in advance to all contestants,
