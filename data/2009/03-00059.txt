Language barriers --- financial barriers
It seems this forum is being used to wage private battles. Perhaps the
moderator should discourage this type of discussions. They do not belong in
a forum that is allegedly devoted to discussing purely academic questions in
the field of Indology.

Would-be investigators are invited to accept my initial suggestion
(repeated, I am afraid, again in vain) by starting to make their inquiries
with the contact person of the HvG-Foundation:
The list must not serve as a platform for insinuations, and detective games
are better lived out in a private sphere. I am really sorry to say that -
being under constant deadline pressure - I am forced to establish priorities
and can no longer participate in pointless discussions. I have no time to
mount Prof. Franco's hobbyhorse, but take it he feels happy enough being on
it alone.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
me studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
