Dear Scholars,
Who is the author of  vrutti on bhagavadgita which accarya shankara quotes
in 2.11 ? It is also abundantly quoted in Madhusudana Saraswati's commentary
as vrutti, and in avigItA as `iti vAmanaH'. If it is vAmana, is he the the
same vaamana of kaashika fame? I also request to share any info on
commentaries on Bhagavdgita before Shankara's time.

Thanks,
Srinidhi
