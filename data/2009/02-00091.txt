I agree with Alexandra.
I also think that one mustn't put the cart before the onager.  There 
exists a corpus of language material called "Sanskrit", and it is 
therefore available for corpus-analysis, just like the British National 
Corpus (http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/using) or any other similar project. 
One can dream up all sorts of fascinating questions to ask of the 
material.  One can attend to the layering of the material, or the division 
into subject fields.  Following the analysis, one may arrive at 
interesting or unexpected conclusions, try to explain them sociologically, 
etc. etc.  I feel certain that there are undiscovered patterns of syntax 
and usage in Sanskrit that probably persisted over very long periods of 
time.  Eli's assertion that one can't analyse the stuff because it's so 
hermetically divided by genre is itself something it would be interesting 
to test quantitively.  This kind of work might, for example, show a 
clearer distinction than any of us are currently aware of between core 
usage and extended genre-specific usage (in lexemes, syntax, etc.).
One of the main interests of corpus analysis in other languages has been 
precisely that generally held assumptions about language use have been 
overturned and that all sorts of interesting features have been discovered 
that nobody previously knew about.
Incidentally, the generation of Sanskrit scholars working in the 19th 
century, Roth, Aufrecht, Boehtlingk and others, treated the Veda very much 
as a closed corpus, and this attitude informed to some extent to their 
approaches to the rest of Skt literature.  There was a clear underlying 
assumption that it could all be definitively grasped, submitted to lexical 
analysis, and nailed down.
