>>  I was fascinated to learn from your e-mail of the current interest - of
>>  Klaus Karttunen and others - in an edition of the Gargiya-Jyotisa. My own
>>  work in editing the Yuga-Purana chapter of that work was undertaken
>>  largely in 1978-79; the Asiatic Society took a little while before
>>  publishing it in 1986. Thereafter I joined the British diplomatic service
>>  in 1980, and I have regrettably not had the chance to take up further work
>>  on the Gargiya-Jyotisa. My only subsequent work in this connection has
>>  been to discover two additional manuscripts of the
>>  Yuga-Purana/Gargiya-Jyotisa. These are mentioned in my short article "The
>>  Yuga-Purana: A Footnote" published in BSOAS LIII part 2, 1990, pp.320-322.
>>  They will also be incorporated in a second edition of my book "The Yuga
>>  Purana" which the Asiatic Society is in the process of sending to press.
>>
>>  Back in 1992 Prof Michio Yano of Kyoto Sangyo University sought my advice
>>  on a copy of a Gargiya-Jyotisa manuscript he had obtained through Pingree.
>>  It may be that he or one of his students had thoughts of preparing an
>>  edition of the work. But I do not know whether anything came of this.
>>
>>  I should be most interested to hear if you come across anyone who is
>>  preparing such an edition.
>>
>>  With best wishes,
