invertebrates
Dear members of the list,
Is anyone aware of a stone sculpture from India sensu lato on which
somewhere an invertebrate animal has been sculpted? I know only of a
Chamunda with a scorpion in her sunken belly.

NB for the very, very non-zoologist: invertebrates are molluscs, insects,
spiders, medusas, crabs and lobsters and that sort of animals.
