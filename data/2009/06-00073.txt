Ayurveda, the classical medical system of South Asia, was codified in the
first few centuries BCE, and is even today - in modified form - formally and
financially supported by the Government of India through the Ministry of
Health.

This symposium addresses the dynamic interactions between texts, and between
texts and practices according to available sources, in the little-studied
period of post-classical and pre-colonial India when Ayurveda interacted
with other medical systems such as Unani.



*Topics include:*

Post-classical traditions of medical debate and argumentation.

Relative chronologies in alchemical and medical literature.

Indo-Persian sources on post-classical Indian medicine.

Irrational elements in a rational system for healing.



*Speakers:*

G. Jan Meulenbeld (Groningen) ? Dominik Wujastyk (Leiden) ? Kenneth Zysk
(Copenhagen) ? Tsutomu Yamashita (Kyoto) ? Fabrizio Speziale (Rome/Paris) ?
Philipp Maas (Vienna) ? Oliver Hellwig (Berlin) ? Jan Houben (Paris/Leiden)
