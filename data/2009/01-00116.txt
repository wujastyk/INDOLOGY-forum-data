Dan Ehnbom is the curator of the South Asia collection at the University 
of Virginia Museum. I told him about our discussion about this painting 
and asked him to comment. He sent me a better image of the painting, 
which I have posted to 
http://people.virginia.edu/~rah2k/SlayingofShankasura.jpg, and offered 
this comment:

<begin quote>
Here is a better picture of it.  Sankhasura is the demonic figure to the 
left of center at the bottom.  Because Indian art, as Coomaraswamy said, 
is an art of statement rather than description, he is not very 
conch-like, except perhaps for the blob-like form on his abdomen. 
Possibly this is the demon assuming his true form at the moment of his 
death.
