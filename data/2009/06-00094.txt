Jaipur
Dear Jean Michel,
I have been working in Jaipur for the last few years and managed to  
get access to some of the materials of the Library in the City Palace.  
But the situation there changes frequently and is quite complex. In  
case you read German I would like to draw your attention to a new  
study by Monika Boehm-Tettelbach (authors name: Monika Horstmann) on  
Savai Jai Singh:
In case you like to get more detailed information I would suggest to  
get in touch off list.
Best wishes
Joerg
