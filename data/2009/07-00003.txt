Untoucables in Classical Tamil Society? (Re: New discovery in              Tamil Nadu)
Palaniappan has ingenious arguments, but for me they don't work.  He  
says pooz does not mean leather strap, but then how about Akam 281.5,  
"Winding a long pooz on his bow."  Clearly this does not mean rattan  
or palmyra.  And it's quite difficult to imagine someone using a  
needle on either rattan or palmyra.  In any event, there is much more  
to indicate that certain castes were considered "low" because of their  
connection with things dead and the spirit world in the Sangam works.   
If anyone is interested, I'll send a pdf of a paper I wrote (and to  
which Palaniappan responded -- he will, I'm sure, send you a link to  
his paper also).  As far as washermen go, the issue is not how they  
were classified at period x or y, but how they were regarded in Sangam  
texts.  It is obvious that the position of castes changes over time  
and in different places -- the Nadars are an example.  My own view is  
that the caste system grew from the bottom up, not from the top down.   
It is based on the concept that people who have contact with and  
manipulate the spirit world are dangerous and should be kept out of  
the ordered world of the upper castes.  G. Hart
