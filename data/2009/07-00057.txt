Dear Dr.Hart,
For the occurrence of the Naarada stories in some of the Puraanas, namely the Bhaagavata-, Brahmaanda-, Matsya-,? Vaayu- and Vishnu-Puraana
?V.R.Ramachandra Dikshitar's The Puraana Index Vol.II Univ. Madras, 1952 is a good guide.
Best wishes
DB

I have a friend who wants to write about Narada (Naradamuni, the mythological figure) -- does anyone know of any books in English, Tamil or Telugu on this subject?? He is particularly interested in stories, anecdotes and the like.? Thanks. George Hart
