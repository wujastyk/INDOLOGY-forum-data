Translations into Sanskrit
The Raajavyavahaarakoza is a lexicon of Sanskrit equivalents to (mostly) 
Persian administrative terms; it was prepared on Shivaji?s behalf by 
Raghunaatha (ca. 1676).

Dear Colleagues,
lately I was asked about early translations 
into Sanskrit and noticed  
that this is quite an interesting question I know 
little about. Is  
anybody aware of articles or books on this topic? In 
particular, I  
would be curious to learn about the earliest translations 
into  
Sanskrit of texts originally composed in languages others than Middle  
Indo-Aryan ones (as only these I would consider translations in the  
full 
sense).
Best wishes,
Sven Sellmer
