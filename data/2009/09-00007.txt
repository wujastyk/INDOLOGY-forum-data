Dear James,

I've just seen your post to the Indology list and I wonder if I may be
so bold as to inquire about Rovereto. I imagine that you meant the
Rovereto that is about 20Km from Trento.

My name is Alberto Todeschini and I'm finishing a PhD in Indian Buddhism
at the University of Virginia. I'll spend the next few months in
Lausanne and Vienna.

I'm actually from Trento and I'll be there to see my parents during the
second half of this month.

Anyway, I was just curious to know about the connection between Rovereto
and Sanskrit. I know that occasionally Sanskrit introductions have been
taught at the university of Trento, but I don't know by whom.

Best,

Alberto Todeschini
