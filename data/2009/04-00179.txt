typing Devanagari
There is a Devanagari keyboard/font that is now part of OSX.  Under  
the "Apple" drop down menu choose "System Preferences" and then  
"International".  Then under "Input Menu" you can select Devanagari  
and/or Devanagari QWERTY.  At the bottom of this display box, make  
sure "Show input menu in menu bar" is "on."  In the upper right of  
your menu bar (near the clock), you will now have a way to select the  
keyboard input (US, US Extended, Devanagari, etc.).  I just tried it  
again (since I almost never use Devanagari myself) and it seems to  
work fine (the font automatically changes to match the keyboard).  You  
can use this keyboard for any unicode Devanagari font (like Sanskrit  
2003, etc.). Contact me off-list, if the above isn't clear.
My best,
Steven
