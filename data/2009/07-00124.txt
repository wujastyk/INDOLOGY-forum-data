     I found my pothi edition.   Unfortunately it is missing the first page/folio and the last few ones.  However, from the continuing abbreviated title that appears in the left corner (?.  ??.), I can make a safe assumption that the name of the pothi is ?gved?ya Nityakarma.  The "Deve" mantras are given on folios 36a to 40.  The section comes after Yaj?opav?tadh?ra?avidhi and is followed by the section of Rudra.  The collection of Deve mantras begins with the formulaic ?r?ga?e??ya nama? followed by the mantra ga??n?? tv? ga?apati? hav?mahe.  This mantra is like a preamble, since the number 1 appears after the mantra that begins with namo mahadbhyo namo arbhakebhyo etc. but ends with the word dev??.   After 30 numbered mantras that end with the word dev??, the recitation is followed by two pages of selected blessing mantras and ending with tanno lak?m?? pracoday?t.  From the appearance of the printed pothi, I am making an assumption that it is published by Nirnayasagara Press.  Sorry can't give you more bibliographical information.

Madhav,

I'd appreciate that.  I'd especially like to know if your ed. has any information besides the bare text.

Hello Allen,

    This "DEVE" collection of mantras is reasonably popular among the Vaidikas and these mantras are used as general blessing.  They have been published in pothi form in old times by Nirnayasagara.  I have a printed copy, though I will have to hunt it down.  Best,

Madhav
