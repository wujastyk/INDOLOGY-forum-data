Dear Jean-Luc,
I do not have the bibliographic resources at hand here to investigate the matter much further, but I can report that the gotra-name K?pyasa (sic) is one among the handful of gotra-names current nowadays among the Atharvavedic brahmins of Orissa. I don't know how things stood for P??ini and the p??in?yas, but at least the Atharvavedic tradition itself is replete with self-references as ??girasa.
For the complete list of gotra-names prevalent in the modern Orissan Atharvavedic community, see the article "A List of Paippal?da-AtharvaVedin Settlements", contributed by M. Witzel and myself to Abhijit Ghosh (ed.), ?tharva?? (A collection of essays on the AtharvaVeda with special reference to its Paippal?da tradition), Kolkata: Sanskrit Book Depot, 2002, pp. 167-179. For a sample of medieval Atharvavedic gotra-names, see A. Schmiedchen, "Epigraphical Evidence on the History of Atharvavedic Brahmins", in A. Griffiths & A. Schmiedchen (eds.), The Atharvaveda and its Paippal?da??kh?, Aachen: Shaker Verlag, 2007.
I had never realized the illustrious authority upon which the name K?pyasa ultimately rests, having always considered it a surprising metathesis from one of the other common Atharvavedic gotra-names, viz. K??yapa, pronounced K?syapa in Orissa. I now guess it is rather a contamination of K?pya with K??yapa, or derived from a genitive form K?pyasya [gotra].

As I noticed last fall, the Karandai plates also happen to list Atharvavedic brahmins, whose mention is otherwise very rare in South Indian inscriptions (see again Schmiedchen's paper, in which the evidence of the Karandai plates had regrettably escaped attention). Do any of them bear the gotra-affiliation K?pya?

>> Dear colleague, The "suutras" are clearly not part of the original A.s.taadhyaayii text as known to Kaatyaayana and Patanjali. *4.1.166: v.rddhasya ca puujaayaam is vaarttika 3 to 4.1.163 (jiivati tu va.m'sye yuvaa. *4.1.167: yuuna's ca kutsaayaam is included as part of the suutra text of the Kaa'sikaav.rtti but is identified as not part of the original text by Kaiya.ta in his Pradiipam (Rohtak ed. III.617) on 4.1.162 (apatyam pautraprabh.rti gotram) vt. 2 (jiivadva.m'sya.m ca kutsitam), where Kaiya.ta cites yuuna's ca kutsaayaam and remarks that this statement shows the suutra in question does not stem from the sage: yuuna's ca kutsaayaam iti suutram anaar.sam iti vacanam. In his Bhaa.sya on 4.1.162 vt. 2 (Kielhorn-Abhyankar ed. II.265.5-8), Patanjali remarks that someone whose father is still alive but is independent is addressed using a gotra term; such an offspring bears the technical name 'gotra' out of scorn, as when one addresses one who should be called gaargyaaya.na (using a yuvan term) is addressed as gargya. Conversely, an elder who rspresents his line and is properly referred to using a gotra term like gaargya may affectionately be addressed using a yuvan term like gaargyaaya.na, now used as an honorific, since youth is something desirable (Bh. on 4.1.163 vt. 3, II.265.23-25). There is a very old but still informative pamphlet by V. S. Agrawal, 'Gotras in Paa.nini'(Varanasi, 1963), but I don't know of a detailed study of the usage in the domains you mention. I hope this helps. George Cardona
