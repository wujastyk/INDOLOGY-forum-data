pramanas
Dear All,
I've got a list of four pram??as in a P?li text, these are:
pratyak?a
anum?na
?abda
arth?patti
Can anybody tell me, whether these four are typical for specific  
branches of Buddhist philosophy or perhaps other Indian philosophies?
Would be grateful for any information,
Petra Kieffer-P?lz
