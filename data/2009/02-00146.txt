RV Khila 4.2.13a(Scheftelowitz 112) runs as 
'durgaa.m devii.m ;sara.nam aha.m prapadye...'; 
Whoelse could be addressed thus?
MP.93.16 as
'vinaayaka.m tathaa durgaa.m vaayum aakaa;sam eva ca'
Whoelse could be the deity here?

(1) Durga

Wondering about the earliest references for two things:

(1) Durga

(2) the use of sindur, particularly as used in the hair parting by married
