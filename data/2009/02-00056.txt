Macdonell and Whitney Grammars
Does anyone on the list have information on the availability of etexts of:
Macdonell: A Sanskrit Grammar for Students
and 
Whitney: Sanskrit Grammar |(5th ed. 1924)
I already have the scanned pdfs but it would be very useful to get an accurate text document of either of these works. Surely this is a desideratum  to compliment available versions of Whitney's Roots and MW's Dictionary?
With thanks,
