With DOS?SCRIPT was in use here. That offered many problems. Since the introduction of WINDOWS?I have used i-LEAP. Barring the svarita accents in Devnagari and the subscript ring in Roman there is no problem with this. Both can be improvised?with flawless end?products.The multi-language i-LEAP seems to have been withdrawn but more expensive packages for individual languages are available with CDAC.
The new packages announced in these columns, however, are more convenient than i-LEAP
DB?

Hello,
ISM fonts of C-DAC are available for Sanskrit(DV) and Diacritic Roman(DV1).
Only thing is that you have to learn the keyboard outlay.

Sanskrit font then selecting characters  from a Symbol menu. this is very
cumbersome and slow.
