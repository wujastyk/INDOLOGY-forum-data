Dear Colleagues,

lately I was asked about early translations into Sanskrit and noticed  
that this is quite an interesting question I know little about. Is  
anybody aware of articles or books on this topic? In particular, I  
would be curious to learn about the earliest translations into  
Sanskrit of texts originally composed in languages others than Middle  
Indo-Aryan ones (as only these I would consider translations in the  
full sense).

Best wishes,
Sven Sellmer
