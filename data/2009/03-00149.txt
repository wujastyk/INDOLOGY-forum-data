[From Macaulay's review of : The Life of Robert Lord Clive; collected  
from the Family Papers, communicated by the Earl of Powis. By MAJOR- 
GENERAL SIR JOHN MALCOLM, K.C.B. 3 vols. 8vo. London: 1836.]
What Macaulay rather illustrates, I think, is brilliant parliamentary  
bombast disguised as "matter-of-factness".
