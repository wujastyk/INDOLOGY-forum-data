Gita
<Dutch provincial and very religious universities (fortunately very few of them)>
Should one really feel fortunate that institutions with religious orientation?are few? Many make a living out of research on their activities and on thoughts upon which they have been built up.?No matter they are of another denomination, it is the genre that supplies bread and butter to philologists, to some at least.??Hitting the branch of the tree on which one sits?
Also the tongue-in-cheek delibearation may be accompanied with sermon on some ideal that can be safe from it. That will render "Indology"?into a proper theological forum.

Good for the Dutch provincial and very religious universities (fortunately
very few of them) to learn something new...
