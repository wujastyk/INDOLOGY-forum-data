The Tattvasa?graha and the -pa?jik? were at some point made available as 
e-texts by Jong Cheol Lee, as were a numer of other Buddhist texts, as 
part of a project called "Sanskrit Database for a Polyglot Buddhist 
Dictionary". These e-texts do circulate, but they do not seem to be 
available for download from any website officially. I also don't know 
what became of Lee's project.

The ?a??ar?anasamuccaya (Suali ed.) was digitized by Muneo Tokunaga, 
with Gu?aratna's commentary, and can be found here:

(Kyoto-Harvard transliteration).
