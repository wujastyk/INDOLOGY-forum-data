Let me assure you that I have no private battle with Prof. Slaje, nor  
with the Glasenapp Foundation, and that I consider the ?Kleine  
Schriften? series extremely useful, irrespectively of the question  
whether it was established according to Glasenapp?s wishes or not. It  
would be a good idea to establish similar series in other countries as  
well.
It is touching to see how whenever Prof. Slaje is involved in a debate  
Dr. Gruenendahl comes to his rescue.
Best wishes
EF
