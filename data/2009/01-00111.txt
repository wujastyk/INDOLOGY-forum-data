Dear Valerie et al.,

here is an example from the University of Virginia Art Museum (second image from the top):

    http://www.virginia.edu/artmuseum/collections_NEW/the_collections/Asian/India.html

Unfortunately rather small, and I'm not sure I see the conch, unless it is the orange object floating in the river in the bottom left of the painting.

All best,
Stefan
