invertebrates
Dear Valerie et al.,
here is an example from the University of Virginia Art Museum (second image from the top):
    http://www.virginia.edu/artmuseum/collections_NEW/the_collections/Asian/India.html
Unfortunately rather small, and I'm not sure I see the conch, unless it is the orange object floating in the river in the bottom left of the painting.
All best,
Stefan
