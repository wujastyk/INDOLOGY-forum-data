Secretary of Arts Petition
I'm completely opposed to this idea of adding to government
bureaucratic interference with the arts.  The National Endowment
on the Arts was quickly politicised and just got worse as time
and presidential appointments to its directorship proceeded. 
Keep government out of the arts, period.
Aaaaaaargh.
