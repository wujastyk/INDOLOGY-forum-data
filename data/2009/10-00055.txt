yugas and colours
Just noticed this discussion, and it brought to mind the not unrelated 
fact that the faces of the Buddha Kaalachakra and the dirctional colors 
in his mandala palace are precisely those, front-east black, right-south 
red, back-west yellow, left-north white. ince his body is supposed to 
represent all the "parts" of time, fitting that his faces represent the 
yugas.
That mandala is the only one in the Tibetan collection that I know of 
that uses those colors for the faces and directions.
