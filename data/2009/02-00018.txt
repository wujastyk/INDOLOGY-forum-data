Excellent news!  I've forwarded the information to the Indology list, and
I'll work out a way of making a link somewhere on the Indology website.
Many thanks to you and your colleagues.  I hope this book will now start
to take its rightful place as one of the best Sanskrit primers available.
Best,
Dominik
