A quibble:

I think I can see what you mean about "Anglosaxon matter-of-factness",  
but I wonder whether it is really best illustrated by Macaulay's  
monstrous purple prose.  Macaulay gets so carried away by the power of  
his own rhetoric, it seems to me, that he no longer knows himself when  
he is being entirely sincere.  Here's another passage, tending in the  
opposite direction, which may be very seductive as a piece of  
magniloquent oratory, but which again seems to me (particularly when  
laid beside the infamous "Minute...") somewhat hollow.

``The people of India, when we subdued them, were ten times as  
numerous as the Americans whom the Spaniards vanquished, and were at  
the same time quite as highly civilised as the victorious Spaniards.  
They had reared cities larger and fairer than Saragossa or Toledo, and  
buildings more beautiful and costly than the cathedral of Seville.  
They could show bankers richer than the richest firms of Barcelona or  
Cadiz, viceroys whose splendour far surpassed that of Ferdinand the  
Catholic, myriads of cavalry and long trains of artillery which would  
have astonished the Great Captain. It might have been expected, that  
every Englishman who takes any interest in any part of history would  
be curious to know how a handful of his countrymen, separated from  
their home by an immense ocean, subjugated, in the course of a few  
years, one of the greatest empires in the world.''
