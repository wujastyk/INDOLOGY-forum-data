Again a message to me from Bryan Levman which seems interesting:

The Tibetans translate as mos pa which means:

1) Meaning for the mind to have decided that something is  
appropriate / trustworthy / good and to turn towards that, take an  
interest in that, orient itself towards doing that.  Hence, lit. "to  
be oriented towards", "to tend towards", "to be inclined to".  It is  
similar to bdun pa, though that has more of the sense of actually  
striving after whereas this has a sense of simply liking, being  
appreciative of.  It has a wide range of uses and on context means  
"to have a liking for", "to fancy", "to prefer", "to appreciate", and  
even "to be dedicated to", "to have conviction in".
2) "To think" that something is so, to direct one's mind to a certain  
way of thinking.  Often seen in buddhist liturgies where a certain  
way of thinking, like with visualization, is necessary.

[from the Illuminator dictionary.]

Pali has adhimutti as resolve, intention, disposition, so pretty much  
the same as Skt. "propensity." It comes from the root adhi+ muc,  
probably muc in the sense of "loose" or "release" with "adhi" as an  
adverb of direction or place (PED),
