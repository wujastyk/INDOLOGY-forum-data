Right, after the fourth foot, which here happens to coincide with a  
ga?a.  The ga?as of the trika system provide convenient mnemonics  
for the sequences of long and short syllables in a meter, but they  
are irrelevant to the rhythm of a line, to its foot structure, and to  
the placement of the caesura.  These things are however revealed by  
formal metrical analysis, and, remarkably, they are also observed in  
the traditional chanting pattern.

The alternation of ??rd?lavikr??ita with Sragdhar? makes sense  
because they have structural affinities.  ??rd?lavikr??ita has  
seven rising feet, falling into two hemistichs divided by a caesura.   
The first hemistich has four tetramoraic feet  (with anacrusis), the  
second has three pentamoraic feet (with catalexis).  Mand?kr?nt?  
and Chitralekh? have the same 4:3 pattern of tetramoraic and  
pentamoraic feet, only the feet are falling rather than rising.   
Sragdhar? is similar except that it has an extra foot in the first  
hemistich (actually a problem for Deo's analysis, as she points out).
