announcement: proceedings of symposium PLUS summaries in skt
I wonder, does Dr. Srinivas Varakhedi and his team also have words for
coputer, computational, unicode fonts, printer, word strings, parser,
recursive, and regular expressions? Personally, if I would have to do the
job, I would have considered these terms loan-words, as most living
languages do today. Same with submodern items like coffee and train.
