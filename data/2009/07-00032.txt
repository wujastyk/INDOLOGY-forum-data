cha
Dear Colleagues,
In May?2008 some queries had been made on the letter ? occurring in manuscripts. No conclusion could be drawn. I do not know if the following report will help draw some conclusion. 
The sign?? occurs in a so far unreported manuscript of the Atharvaveda (Vulgate) to indicate?a section within a long hymn, or a hymn within a long cluster of hymns (anuv?ka). In the?published commentary of S?ya.na the sections indicated by ? are understood as?hymns and?have been serially numbered by the commentator, so also in the the Paippal?da-Samhit?, but not in the existing editions of the Vulgate (confusingly by Roth-Whitney (1856) and not recognised by Whitney-Lanman(HOS VIII,?1905)?).? 
Best for all

Re: cha
Dear friends
I am seeing, for long,? this 'Cha'' in our own inherited collection of
dvaita and Nyaya manuscripts from North Karnataka and wondering what it
means. the answer, corraborated with other elder scholars, seems to be
simple. it is to indicate the end of section/text/chapter etc. It is a
common in manuscripts found in our region although it is not so common in
MSs found in sother regions like Tamilnadu or Kerala.
In the MS of Vyutpattivada, I am using for my critical edition at present
given to me by one of my friends from the same region, uses the Cha with
high freqency that every niranka patra (side of a leaf as it is called by
us) has nearly two three Chas to indicate the completion of debate on
particular subject.
thanks
