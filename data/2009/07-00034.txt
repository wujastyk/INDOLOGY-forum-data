Yes, but this comes in a Vedic manuscript. Tripathi belonged to Gujarat, as far as I remember.?Our manuscript too belonged to that region. Is the sign of Gujarat-origin? In many such cases the Saaradaa ms of the AV has phasca. Is that?related??I do not know how far these questions have been dealt with.

Chandrabhal Tripathi writes about this symbol in his (excellent) 
introduction to his catalogue of Jain MSS in Strasbourg.
