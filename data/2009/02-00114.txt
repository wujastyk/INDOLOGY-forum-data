Small addition to reading Dante, we should not forget that Latin is
thought at Italian highschools as a compulsory subject throughout the
years (as Classic Greek is here in Greece, actually, my children spend
more hours class on Classic than on Modern Greek!). This immensely helps
reading Dante. Greek children also have much less problems reading Homer
than English children reading Chaucer. By the way, Dutch people have much
less problems either with Chaucer.
