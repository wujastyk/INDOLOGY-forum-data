Subject: performing life-cycle rites for deities
Message-ID: <161227085612.23782.13435569770609354703.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

As I am studying Newar Buddhist consecration rituals for images,  
caityas and so on, I am wondering how much of a tradition of  
performing the sa?sk?ra life-cycle rites  as part of such  
consecration rites there is outside (Newar) Buddhism. I am aware that  
such rites are indeed performed for the generation of Agni when  
installing the fire, but it is not clear to me to which extent the  
sa?sk?ras (not just conception and birth, but also further rites up  
to the wedding) are also performed for the consecration of images. The  
sa?sk?ras do form an integral part of the consecration ceremony  
performed in the ?aiva tradition preserved among the Newars. Hence, I  
suppose that such practice exists (or existed) also in other Hindu  
traditions, but I have no hard evidence in support. Any help to  
identify such evidence would be much appreciated.
