Choice of meter for writing a treatise: s'loka vs. aaryaa
Dear list members,
being engaged in a study of the popularity of various meters in the 
Tamil speaking world,
I would welcome informations on the reasons (or the background)
for the choice of meter while writing a treatise in Sanskrit.
Are there for instance
articles/books examining, explaining or suggesting reasons why the 
V?kyapad?ya was composed in ?loka-s
whereas the S??khyak?rik? was composed in ?ry??
(I hope I am not mistaken)
Is this simply a consequence of the date of their compositions?
Thanks for any pointers
