Octavio Paz
I can't help with Stella's question, but I am struck by her quote from Bhavabhuti:
"Armed with their rules and precepts,
many condemn my verses.
I don't write for them, but for that soul, twin to mine,
who will be born tomorrow,
Time is long and the world wide."
Didn't one of the Buddhist philosophers feel no one of his time really understood him, and make some comment like this?  Dignaga or Dharmakirti, maybe?
