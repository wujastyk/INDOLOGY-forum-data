There are a number of Paintings of Amitabha in the Kozlov material  
from Kara Khoto. They were published in a recent  Russian Language  
Catalogue published by the Hermitage that a student of mine showed me  
during a seminar. A few of them were published in Thurman and Rhie  
Wisdom and Compassion and again by Yu-Min Lee in the news letter of  
the National Palace Museum in Taiwan. There are also numbers of caves  
at Dunhuang with Sukhavati scenes in them (usually based on the  
Wuliangshou fo Kuang Jing).
