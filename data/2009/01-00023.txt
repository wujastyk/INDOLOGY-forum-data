silent and be naked. From the context within the text, this appears to be
a general rule of behavior, and not simply an advice on how to act during
the ritual itself.
It made me wonder about the nakedness of female ascetics in general,
whether in the past or today. I am aware of the nakedness of some male
ascetics, such as modern-day male sAdhus and some Jain monks, but are
there generally speaking cases of female ascetics moving about naked in
Buddhism, Hinduism or Jainism? In the cases I know of today, female
ascetics do not practice nakedness.
