Subject: ha.msa in parama-ha.msa and ha.msa-sa.mde/sa
In-Reply-To: <a06240849c60e134ac3a4@[192.168.1.2]>

There is also the story of God Brahmaa going to 
the top of the sky in the shape of a ha.msa 
(looking for the end of the li;nga, while Vi.s.nu 
goes under the Earth in the shape of a boar) as 
reminded by Puur.nasarasvatii:

ruupa.m bibhran na.ta iva sakhe rocamaa.na.m tvadiiya.m
maatu.m dhaataa madanadamanajyotir uurdhva.m gato 'bhuut | 7ab

(the story is at least told in Li;ngaP 1,17,5-52)

I wonder what are the oldest (textual or 
iconographical) sources for the ha.msa(s) as 
vehicle of Brahmaa, and what is the original 
symbolical relationship between the god and the 
bird.
