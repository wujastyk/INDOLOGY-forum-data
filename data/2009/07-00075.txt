Dear Marie-Helene,

the only edition of the PatraparIkSa I am aware of is the following:

Vidy?nandasv?mi-viracit? ... ?ptapar?k?? Pat?ra?par?k?? ca 
Gaj?dha?ra?l??la??jai??na????stri?? samp?dite. (Sa?n?tanajainagrantham?l?
1). K??? 1913.

I have a photocopy of this edition and could send you a scan in August.

I did not read the work so far and therefore would be very much 
interested in your studies about the term patra. I don't know anything 
about the term except what can be found in secondary descriptions of 
VidyAnandins works where patra is referred to as a synonym of hetu.

With best regards

Himal
