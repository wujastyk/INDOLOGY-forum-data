Yes, it would be a great boon to all interested parties if a viable e-text 
were available. But, please not an on-line look-up dictionary.  This is the 
least satisfactory way of making a dictionary available, although I 
understand the reasons why some providers may opt for that approach.  But 
imagine what it would be like if you went to a book-shop or a library and 
you were met with a blank wall with a little service window in it where you 
can only get shown a book if you know its title or author.  Tough luck if 
you want to browse or only have a general idea of what you want.
