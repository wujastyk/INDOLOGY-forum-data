frequencies
One way to deal with frequencies in Skt., that
would perhaps get around the problem of genre,
raised by Eli, would be to focus on the question
not of words, but of which roots are the most
productive, and then to look at the particular
derivations of those roots that are most
frequent within any given genre. This would of
course not include particles, pronouns, numerals,
and underived nouns and adjectives, however.
