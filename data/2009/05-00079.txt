Jonathan/Stefan,

Didn't Gouriswar Bhattacharya also write something about this word more 
recently? -- I think in a Festschrift, maybe for D.C. Sircar?

Dear Jonathan,

> the scribe/engraver appears indeed to have written not
> deyadharma- but devadharma-. Is this a common mistake?

yes, that happens. See p. 24 of:

   Heinrich L?ders, 1940. Zu und aus den Kharo??h??Urkunden. Acta
   Orientalia 18: 15?49.

for three devadharmas in Ku???a?period Sanskrit inscriptions from
a monastery in Mathura and one in a 10th/11th?century inscription
from Bengal.

All best,
Stefan
