Fwd: Middle Indic textbook
PS. Realizing that you wrote in reply to Frederick Smith?s query:
???????????? ????? is not a textbook, but a succinct and useful
overview of OIA and MIA; and the memorial volume is a collection
of articles mostly on Vedic, but there are also some MIA and NIA
contributions. Speaking of Tat?iana Elizarenkova, a more in?depth
treatment is ???? ???? (1965):

also available in English as The P?li Language (1976):
   http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2736885
but at this point a combination of the previously mentioned works
by Geiger, von Hin?ber and Oberlies would seem to be the best
combo for Pali (plus the introductions by Warder or Collins if a
textbook approach is needed). And of course Pali is a good entry
point to MIA in general (with A?okan inscriptions, Ardham?gadh?
and the literary Prakrits as possible next steps).
