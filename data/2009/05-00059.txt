Ictus on syllables 3, 6, 8, 12, 14, 17, 19 --- you can hear a brief  
example of the traditional way it is recited at http:// 
pantheon.yale.edu/~asd49/sound/

For the theory, see Ashwini Deo, The metrical organization of  
classical Sanskrit verse, Journal of Linguistics 43.63-114 (2007).  
This is really essential reading for anyone interested in Sanskrit  
metrics.

On Deo's analysis, ??rd?lavikr??ita is one of the rhythmically  
most complex and interesting meters (p. 109).  Like some other  
popular meters, such as Mand?kr?nt?, it has seven feet that shift  
from tetramoraic to pentamoraic at the caesura, with the final foot  
catalectic, in addition (unlike Mand?kr?nt?) also anacrusis in the  
first foot.
