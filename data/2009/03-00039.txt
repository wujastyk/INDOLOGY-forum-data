Publication announcement : on the dating of Kani.ska
"Zur Datierung des Ku.sa.na-K?nigs Kani.ska",
it reminds me that I came across a recent 
reference on the same subject, which is a 
detailed study from the numismatic point of view, 
in a periodical (famous for being the oldest 
literary one in Europe, founded in 1665 AD and 
now published by the French Acad?mie des 
Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres) which could have 
escape the attention of the Indologists:
BOPEARACHCHI Osmund, "Les premiers souverains 
kouchans : chronologie et iconographie 
mon?taire", in Journal des Savants, Janvier-Juin 
2008, pp. ??
(on the author, who had published in 1991 : 
Monnaies gr?co-bactriennes et indo-grecques, 
catalogue raisonn?, see
