Publication Announcement
The governing committee of the Indology list reminds the list's members 
of the importance of civility, especially in view of the range of 
disciplines and academic backgrounds envisioned in the stated scope of 
the list (available at http://indology.info/email/email-const.shtml).  
Material in languages other than English need not always be translated 
when included in messages to the list, but a request from any member for 
clarification should be answered, if at all, in a way that is not 
belittling.
Yours,
Gary Tubb
Committee member on duty
