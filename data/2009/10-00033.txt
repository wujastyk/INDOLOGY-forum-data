'Plants of the Meghaduta' multimedia website
Dear friends
Some time ago, I posted a link to Tomomi Sato's Meghaduta multimedia website. At that stage, the site only run under Internet Explorer. Tomomi now has a version of the site that runs well in Firefox:
http://meghaduta.awardspace.info/
We would be delighted if you would care to visit it. This was Tomomi's 4th year project on flowers and trees of the Meghaduta. You will find her own English and Japanese translations, artworks and beautiful sung renditions of selected verses.
I'm sure Tomomi would love to hear some feedback. Her email address is:

Yours
McComas Taylor
