Here ?sth? ?should mean ' to mount', talpa 'a raised bed, the Indian bed-stead or paalank'. But plain bed seems to have been?meant 'having seated themselves on a bed formed of twigs under the shade etc' gives better sense.

Hello Venetia,

?tasthu?? is the feminine form of ?tasthivas, masculine:? ?tasthiv?n, from ?+sth?.? [Perfect Participle, Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar, p. 291.]? The verbal construction will be:? striya? talpam ?ti??hante? "the women resort to ..."? Best,

Can anyone help me with the form of ?tasthu????m from Vedanta Deshika's
Hamsasandesham 1.20?? The verse and translation are below and I've added the
glosses that two commentaries give:

ik?u-cch?ye kisalaya-maya? talpam ?tasthu?????

sa?l?pais tair mudita-manas?? ??li-sa?rak?ik???m |

kar????-?ndhra-vyatikara-va??t karbure g?ti-bhede
muhyant?n?? madana-kalu?a? maugdhyam ?sv?dayeth??

*Relish the simplicity, stirred up by love, of the girls who guard the rice.
They revel at heart in all sorts of gossip as they sit in the shade of the
sugarcane using sprouting shoots as seats, forgetting themselves entirely in
the strangely blended songs formed from a mix of the **Kar???ak** and **
?ndhra** tongues.*

One commentary glosses '??rit?n??' and another '?sthitavat?n?m'.

Thank you very much,

Venetia Ansell
