A pedantic correction (but it's still a good story)
Thanks, Paul.  I'm virtually certain I heard it as Polish, which as I was explaining to Bob Goldman, made the story even better.  Maybe it got transformed before it got to me, rather than by me.

It was my father, Valentin Kiparsky, not Roman Jakobson.  The  
occasion was the 1952 Linguistic Institute at Bloomington, Indiana.   
The language was Russian, not Polish.  And the student was male.
...ben cambiato, anyway.
