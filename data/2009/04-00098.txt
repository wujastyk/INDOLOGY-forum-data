Without being a specialist, the ha.msa seems rather to be connected 
with yoga in this case : the ha.msa as migrant bird being in some 
yoga texts a metaphor of the the Soul escaping from the sa.msaara 
(see Ha.msa-Up 1.5, K.surikaa-Up 1.22), with also puns on the 
repetition of the word "ha.msa" (breathing in making "ham" and out 
"sa", Dhyaanabindu-Up 1.62, or ha.msa as the reverse of so'ham). The 
para-ha.msa would be the one who has attained perpetual mukti from 
the nets of living. I rely here on the writings of the late Jean 
Varenne, Aux sources du yoga, Paris, 1989, pp. 68-70, and Upanishads 
du yoga, Paris, 1971, pp. 24-25, 110-11, 163.
There probably exist more complete studies on the subject.
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
