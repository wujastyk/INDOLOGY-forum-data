On the origin of the aaryaa meter (Re: Choice of meter for              writing a treatise: s'loka vs. aaryaa
K. R. Norman believed that the clear resemblance of Arya to an old  
Tamil meter called veNpaa, something I described in my book, was  
illusory and that there was no Tamil influence in its development.  See

I think Prof. Norman's discussion is a bit unfair to me, as I did not  
claim there was Tamil influence, but rather that the Tamil works use  
meters that must be very old in Dravidian and that Arya probably  
developed under the influence of such meters, though almost certainly  
not in Tamil Nadu.  One can suppose that old Dravidian meters were  
used in oral literature in villages that spoke or had spoken Dravidian  
languages and that Arya and other matra meters developed from them.   
While we have a good idea of meters and poetic technique in old Tamil  
has looked at other Dravidian languages including some of the "tribal"  
languages of the north and given us a picture of use of meter in all  
such traditions.  In any event, if one is interested in the  
development of Arya and similar meters, it is very much worthwhile to  
look at old Tamil, as the resemblance between veNpaa and arya is  
remarkable.  George Hart
