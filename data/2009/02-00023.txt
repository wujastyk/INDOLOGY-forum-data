AW: "samsara" meaning "life"
It may not matter in the given context of sa.msaara - but, anyway which
words for 'world' are supposed to refer primarily to the social world and by
what criteria? If You take loka-, its primary denotate is the free space,
filled with light (its meaning 'people' is clearly secondary); the etymology
of jagat-, as Narten has demonstrated in India Maior more than 35 years ago,
is its being a substantivization of a Part. Pr. of gaa 'go', referring
primarily to the totality of creatures that can move; bhuu(mi)- and bhuvana-
belong to bhuu 'to become (more)' etc.
Thanking you for your attention

There is an interesting point at stake here.  As far as I can see, most 
words for "world" in Sanskrit mean, first of all, the social world, not 
the physical, exterior world.

the word 'world' not in its strict literal sense but more in the sense of

'world'? too has?polysemous facets. 'Lara is the greatest batsman in the
world' should mean 'in the cricketing world' and not 'in the universe'.
Sorry for too much advice!
