Dear All,

The left half of a lintel found at Pawaya (Padmavati) showing Visnu 
Trivikrama is well known.  Some thirteen years ago it was rumored that 
the right half of this lintel had been found as well and that its 
publication was foreseen, possibly by Rekha Morris.  Is there any 
confirmation of this rumor or has there indeed been a publication of the 
right half  which has escaped me?
