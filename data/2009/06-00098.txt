New discovery in Tamil Nadu
Dear Stefan Baums,
Well, the Tamil would be pronounced vayiram, and that is the modern  
Tamil word and how it has been written from ancient times -- one  
supposes that if this is truly writing, it is an early form of Tamil  
Brahmi.  It could be a purely Tamil development: vajra > vaciram >  
vayiram.  There are several words where -ci- becomes -yi- (e.g.  
Dravidian ucir > uyir; in spoken Tamil, ucir is still used.  Also  
macir > mayir, and macir is still used in a rather obscene meaning).   
There is, of course, no -j- sound in old Tamil, though it is used  
extensively in borrowed words starting with inscriptions (though it is  
never used in literary texts that are in centamiz -- I don't know  
offhand when the earliest inscription with "j" appears).  Thanks for  
the interesting reply -- I realized when I wrote this that my  
knowledge of MIA is deficient.  The word vayiram, apparently meaning  
"diamond," appears 3 times in Sangam Literature.  It's not clear from  
the article why the word "diamond" would appear on the ring stand.
