Dear Friends,

Is this the first mention of the term 'bhakti' ?

yasya deve par? *bhaktir* yath? deve tath? gurau /
tasyaite kathit? hy arth?? prak??ante mah?tmana? prak??ante mah?tmana? //
SvetUp_6.23 //


 I ask this question as I'm trying to understand the following statement:


*GEV is based on the sacred Vedic principles of bhakti-yoga. *

http://www.ecovillage.org.in/our-projects#_VEC


While 'bhakti' is mentioned at least in the above upanishad, I thought
'bhakti yoga' was quite clearly a post-vedic development, and that the
bhakti movement developed from the 6th century CE. To the devotee this
statement might seem unproblematic, but to the scholar it appears to
conceptually and temporally conflate disparate things.


As I am certainly not an expert on bhakti I would appreciate clarification.


I am interested in how organisations operationalise the 'vedic' sign in
their marketing and promotional material to generate 'authenticity' and
legitimacy.




All the best,
