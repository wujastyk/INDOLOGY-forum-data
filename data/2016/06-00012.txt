I would still like to know the source of this statement, but it does not
appear to be the Bodhisattva-bh?mi. According to an electronic search of
the digital version, the word pa?ca??la does not even occur in this text.
So it seems that the author of the Bodhisattva-bh?mi did not make any
statement about the pa?ca??la, let alone a categorical statement that a
devout Buddhist may deviate from these precepts.

The digital version of the Bodhisattva-bh?mi (Dutt edition) is available at
the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon website (http://www.dsbcproject.org/),
and also at the GRETIL website (http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/). Page
image scans of the two printed editions, those by Unrai Wogihara
(1930-1936) and by Nalinaksha Dutt (1966), were posted by me on the web (
http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-buddhist-texts/). Only
a few months ago the first complete English translation of the
Bodhisattva-bh?mi was published: *The Bodhisattva Path to Unsurpassed
Enlightenment*, translated by Artemus B. Engle (Boulder: Snow Lion, 2016).

By the way, I compared several pages of this new English translation by
Artemus Engle to the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, and it appears to me to
have been very carefully made.
