Subject: [INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari on Mac
In-Reply-To: <61BC1EAB-6D4C-40F6-BD3A-4B0070A1781A@berkeley.edu>
Message-ID: <c161cb44-66bd-4cc4-36f1-ccf4bd284969@gmail.com>

One can easily make a keyboard with a 'dead key' on Windows using the 
Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339). It is 
completely customizable and you can use any keyboard as the basis for 
the build.  I also use the forward slash for my dead key and find typing 
is quite fast.

I haven't tried to incorporate multiple diacritics (before this thread I 
didn't think it was possible without specialized fonts). I'm not sure 
how that would work.
