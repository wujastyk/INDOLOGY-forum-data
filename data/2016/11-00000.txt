[INDOLOGY] Ear
What Prof. Patrick J Olivelle was asking for was a textual reference. If it
is the question of the details of the actual ritual, its altogether
different big story.
1. Touching the ears is not just a ritual as part of worship of a deity. It
is a gesture as part of daily speech adopted into the ritual. In north
India, it is a common practice even today to pull one's own ear with one's
own hand infinitesimally slightly down to indicate 'I apologise'. This has
many complex nuances including those of expressions in romance in which
case the gesture is made along with a mischievous smile.
2. This gesture has a variation of criss-crossing the hands to hold the
lower tip of the ear of the left ear with the right hand and vice versa.
This is similar to the criss-crossing of hands by a Vaidika male for self
introduction with gotra etc. But the semiotics here is that of obedience
rather than asking for forgiveness. The gesture too is little different .
In the self introduction the ear is closed with the back of the palm with
the tips of the fingers facing upwards.
3. In south India, the variation of criss-crossing the hands to hold the
lower tip of the ear of the left ear with the right hand and vice versa is
part of the ritual of considered to be typical of Ganesha worship and is
performed even during the briefest of Darshan of Ganesha. But here, this
gesture is essentially part of sit-stand series expressing asking for
forgiveness.
4. In any case, touching the ground is not part of these gestures or
rituals employing them.
5. What probably is being viewed as touching the ground is sAshTAnga
namaskAra which is an expression of surrender rather than asking for
forgiveness. These two rituals are different from each other.
6. To show that surrender ritual and ritual for asking for forgiveness are
different, I am providing this link

7. The gesture of pulling the lower tip of the ear with or without
criss-crossed hands has its origin in the mild punishment method of
pinching the ear. This gesture has the semiotics of self-punishment. Series
of sit-stand movements too has a similar punishment to self-punishment
'derivation'.
8. Rotating around oneself is also part of  ??????????. But it has a
different semiotic 'derivation'.
Thanks for your patience.
