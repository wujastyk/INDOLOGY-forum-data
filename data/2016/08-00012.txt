[INDOLOGY] jar with writing
Dear colleagues,
I have received the message below from a Vietnamese archaeologist, with two photos attached. I hope they come through. Is anyone able to make any proposal for what script this  could be? (If it is script in the first place.)
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths

Dear Arlo,
One antique collector from Hochiminh City want to donate to the Museum of Anthropology the jas which was considered as the Tang ceramic and was found somewhere in Central Vietnam Sea.
On the shoulder of this jar there are some signs, like some writing, some people think the signs look like Sanskrit writing.
Could you have a look at these signs, what do you think about this jar.
Many thanks and sorry for bothering.
Lam Thi My Dzung
