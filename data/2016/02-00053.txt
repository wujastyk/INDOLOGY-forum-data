[INDOLOGY] ANNOUNCEMENT> The End of Tibetology in Copenhagen
I feel very sorry for this. But this has been going on for long in
Indology. Tibetology etc. I let my grief known. Do they serve any purpose?
In any case I do not approve of the curtailment of education.
Best wishes for further efforts and restoration.
