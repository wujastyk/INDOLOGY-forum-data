Subject: [INDOLOGY] IAST or ISO 15919 input tools for Windows 7
Message-ID: <edb0824197cc60be1a24c6482289716e@cam.ac.uk>

Dear Colleagues,

I would like to install on a Windows 7 machine a keyboard layout to 
input Sanskrit in IAST or ISO 15919 system-wide--and not only in Word. I 
know that many threads in this list have been dedicated to this topic, 
but I cannot find them anymore. I haven't been able to find a good 
solution so far, do you have any suggestion?

Best wishes,

Camillo Formigatti
