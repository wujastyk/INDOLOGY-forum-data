[INDOLOGY] textile/costume ID
Hi,
I am researching a series of 14th century Tibetan *tsakali* -- small
painted cards -- which includes figures wearing clothing that a colleague
tells me is "Eastern Indian in origin" (see below/attached). I've done a
lit review to document this (or not), but have yet to find substantive
relevant research on Indian textile design before the seventeenth century.
Does anybody have any suggestions?
Many thanks!
