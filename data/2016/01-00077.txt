[INDOLOGY] namami.org
It looks as if the National Mission for Manuscripts has lost the website
domain Namami.org, or failed to renew it as of yesterday.  Whois
<https://www.whois.net/> reports that the website is now registered to
someone in Queensland.
I sincerely hope this will be fixed soon.  :-(
