Thank you for posting this Dominik.
Given his popularity I think there is a great need for the Indological community to review his books.
Best,
Dean

Is someone collecting a bibliography of serious reviews of Rajiv Malhotra's books?? Are there considered writings that could be relayed to someone interested in reasoned, academic responses to Malhotra's views?
Best,Dominik
