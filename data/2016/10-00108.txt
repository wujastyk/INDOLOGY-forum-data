The Bh?gavata-pur??a several times gives the analogy of a merchant crossing the sea to sell wares. Yet there is no story in which this actually happens. The image is limited to analogies.

This perhaps is relevant, since the ultimate aim of our life,according to our ancient Indian philosophy ,is to attain enlightenment in life,and thereby bypass all mundane problems ,by way of Realisation of our Self ( i.e.Atmana) .
