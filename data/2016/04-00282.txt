Dear Jarrod,?? Thanks for your interest about this topic. I may recommend a paper written by Emilie Aussant (CNRS, Paris), delivered first at the 15th WSC (Delhi), and which is now in print: "The Vy?karanic descriptive model and the French grammar of Sanskrit", in Jan E.M. Houben & P.-S. Filliozat (eds.), Proceedings of the Linguistics section of the 15th World Sanskrit Conference, D.K. Printworld.? This is a quite accurate survey of the?handbooks.?I guess that you may have a copy of the manuscript by writting personally to Dr. Emilie Aussant:?? emilie.aussant at linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr

Best regards,??? Georges-Jean Pinaut

Dear Jarrod,

One possible source is Stephen G. Alter,?William Dwight Whitney and the Science of Language?(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005). There are some notes on Sanskrit pedagogy in the West scattered through Radhavallabh Tripathi, ed., ??????????????????:?Sixty Years of Sanskrit Studies, Vol. 2?(New Delhi: Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, 2012).
