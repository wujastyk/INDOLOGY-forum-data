Yes, but that is as an epithet of B?haspati, who is identified with Indra and only gradually emerges as an independent deity.

The term ga?apati famously occurs in ?gveda 2.23.1 (ga??n?? tv? ga?apati? hav?mahe ...)

With apologies for the cross-posting, I have a quick question. Does anyone know when the first known use of the term ga?apati and vin?yaka occurs in text or inscription, and related to it, when the first visual images of them are found? Do we find a tradition of their worship during or before the Gupta period. With thanks,
