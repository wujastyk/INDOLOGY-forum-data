[INDOLOGY] India and Bharat
Dear Dr. Palaniappan
Regarding your point on acknowledging regional languages: the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangha (RSS) has been a proponent of regional languages for
quite some time. Contrary to the perceptions of many, the RSS does not see
Hindi as the sole language of India, but as a link language co-existing
with regional languages. In the September 2015 edition of the *Panchajanya,
*the official Hindi weekly published by the RSS, the editorial stated
?Hindi is not against India?s regional languages. This is a myth being
perpetuated ....?[1] The lead article said: ?It (Hindi) will prosper along
with other regional languages.?[1] Hindusthan Samachar, a news service
affiliated with the RSS, provides news services in thirteen languages apart
from Hindi: Hindi, Marathi, Gujrati, Nepali, Oriya, Asamiya, Kannad, Tamil,
Malayalam, Telugu, Sindhi, Sanskrit, Punjabi and Bangla.[2] Most of these
languages were added in 2014 (the agency was restarted in 2000 after a gap
of 14 years). Regional languages are also one of the areas of focus in the
?inclusive Hinduism? of the Sangha.[4]
