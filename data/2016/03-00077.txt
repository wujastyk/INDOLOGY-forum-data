Dear list
In Ulrich Stiehl?s list of 807 conjuncts attested in Sanskrit, the
two-consonant conjunct ??r? (????) is listed as the 786th entry (third from
left in last line of page 4 of the PDF under
http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/mathe.pdf).
I have been unable to trace any word in which this conjunct would occur in
Sanskrit.
Prefix and infix expression search on Advanced search on Monier Williams,
V?caspatyam, and ?abdakalpadruma? yielded no result (except for ???????? in
M-W which has the three-syllable conjunct k?r)
Does anybody know of an example of a word or verse/sentence in which the
usage of this conjunct is attested?
Thanks, Nityanand
