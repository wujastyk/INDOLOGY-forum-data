[INDOLOGY] First female sovereign
Do widowed queens who continued as regents after their husbands? deaths not count?
Surely there must be a few of these from much earlier periods. Prabh?vat? Gupt? is one.  Another from further afield might be Kulaprabh?vat?, known from a fifth-century Cambodian inscription that seems to have been composed after her husband?s death (K. 875, Journal of the Greater India Society IV, p.117).
