[INDOLOGY] Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
Dear Madhav and all,
the digitization of Bloomfield?s Concordance was part of my MA thesis (2001). In the original file (i.e., the one found by Madhav) a non-Unicode compliant font (MacInd) was used, but later on I created a new version of it using Gandhari Unicode. You can get the file through this link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxvjyij2fd4ffwf/Vedic%20Concordance%20ORI%20UNICODE.rtf?dl=0
In the following years, I kept on working on the Concordance and finally I published a considerably enhanced version of it in the Harvard Oriental Series (2007). For obvious copyright reasons, I can?t circulate the HOS file; however, you might want to have a look at the preview uploaded in Academia.
Best wishes,
Marco
