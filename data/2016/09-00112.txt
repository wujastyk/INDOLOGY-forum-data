[INDOLOGY] Etymology and meaning of 'Jhana'
The *Pr?k?taprak??a* has the rule (8.25)
??h?-dhy?-g?n?? ?h??a-jh??a-g????
(????-????-????? ???-???-????)
which explains Sanskrit dhy? changing to jh??a. Hence
dhy?yanti -> jh?anti
dhy?na -> jh??a
The *Abhidh?nar?jendra?* has a rather long entry under *jh??a*. It also
derives the word from *dhy?na *and cites the rule *s?dhyasadhyahy??
jha?* instead,
which I believe is from Hemacandra's grammar.
Hope this helps, Nityananda
