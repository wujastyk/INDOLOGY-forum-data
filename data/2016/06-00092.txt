[INDOLOGY] My verse on morning in Pune
My comic Sanskrit verse about morning in Pune:
??????? ?????????????? ??????, ????????? ????? ????: ?
??????????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????: ???????: ??

"The learned dogs start barking, and the cuckoo birds shout in the ears. On
a good day, with the arrival of water in the taps, women rush with buckets.
Kids, not eager to go to school are sleepy in their homes, while the young
[= IT workers] get going for their work. Thus wakes up the Pune city."
Don't take it seriously! It is a joke!
