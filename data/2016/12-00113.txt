Dear Dominik

See pp. 74?80 of Jonathan Bader's *Meditation in S?an?kara's Veda?nta*.
There he
- contrasts *prasa?khy?na* with the almost synonymous term *pratisa?khy?na*
(famously the topic of the third chapter of ?a?kara's *Upade?as?hasr?*)
and
- discusses the use of the term *prasa?khy?na* in classical Yoga, Advaita
Ved?nta and K?lid?sa.

*khy?ti* in *sattvapuru??nyat?khy?ti* of course has a different sense from
that which it has in the *khy?tiv?da* that Matthew was speaking of:
erroneous cognition in the latter, correct cognition/discernment in the
former.

Best
Alex
