[INDOLOGY] crossing oceans?
I am referring here only the textual reference of the symbolism of the phrase of crossing ocean which is recorded in Nirukta (2.10): samudra (sam+ud+dru: waters flow up) or (sam+abhi+dru waters flow towards it) is understood as the passage between earth and heaven. One may find the detail explanation of the same under Nirukta 2.10.?

 [INDOLOGY] crossing oceans?
Why is half the religious literature of early India concerned with "crossing the ocean of sa?s?ra," when crossing a real ocean was forbidden for twice-born members of society?? Why that?metaphor in particular? ?
Crossing fords, rivers, etc., makes metaphorical sense, and was allowed.? But oceans?
