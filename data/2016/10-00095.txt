Subject: [INDOLOGY] crossing oceans?
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdUvtdV+i_t71jXCNhaeTLFf+NYfaZ071XW_4EwzCoaTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Why is half the religious literature of early India concerned with
"crossing the ocean of sa?s?ra," when crossing a real ocean was forbidden
for twice-born members of society?  Why *that* metaphor in particular?

Crossing fords, rivers, etc., makes metaphorical sense, and was allowed.
But oceans?
