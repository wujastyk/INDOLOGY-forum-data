Is the five-syllable word part of a verse, e.g. begins with the 13th
syllable of a ??rd?lavikr??ita? Wondering if there is a possibility of it
being *kh?bdhikhakebhya?*, with the short vowel: Is the emendation
with *-i**khakebhya?
*by any chance? If so then the reading *kh?bdh**ikhakebhya? *makes perfect
sense as *ka* in Sanskrit means Brahman, standing for the number one. Then
*kha-ka* would mean zero-one or the number ten*. *

The forms *kh?bdh**?rakebhya? / **kh?bdh**?khakebhya? *with the long
vowels still need an explanation. With *kh?bdh**?rakebhya?, *one option is
to assume *ira/?ra* as somehow standing for zero, but this is also
problematic as *?ra *means the wind: *?rayati iti **?ra?*.
