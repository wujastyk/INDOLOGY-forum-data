Edited by *Dominic Goodall* and *Harunaga Isaacson*, Collection 
Indologie n? 131; Early Tantra Series n? 4, Institut Fran?ais de 
Pondich?ry / Ecole fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient / Asien-Afrika-Institut, 
Universit?t Hamburg, xxx, 305 p.

Language: English. *800 Rs (35 *?*). *ISBN: 978-81-8470-211-8 (IFP) / 
978-2-85539-220-2 (EFEO).

The principal works that have emerged from our stimulating project on 
?Early Tantra? are critical editions and translations of previously 
unpublished primary material, which have begun to appear in this new 
series. This volume complements those publications by gathering together 
some of the fruits, direct and indirect, of the wide-ranging discussions 
that took place during the project?s workshops.By way of introduction, 
the volume opens with an attempt by the editors to draw together our 
findings about the ?shared ritual syntax? of some of the earliest known 
works of the tantric traditions, with a particular emphasis on the 
Buddhist /Ma?ju?riyam?lakalpa/ and the ?aiva /Ni?v?satattvasa?hit?/. 
Seven further contributions, by Dominic Goodall, Peter Bisschop, Judit 
T?rzs?k, Diwakar Acharya, Anna A. ?l?czka, Libbie Mills and P?ter-D?niel 
Sz?nt?, throw light on a wide range of topics : the ?aiva/tattva/s and 
their evolution, /yogin?/-temples, alphabet-deities, an early treatise 
of snake-related magic, iconographic prescriptions in early 
/prati??h?tantra/s, the implications of the use of the 
/bh?tasa?khy?///system, and a fragment of a Buddhist tantric /s?dhana/.

Centre of the ?cole fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient from 2002 to 2011.  He 
has published critical editions of ?aiva works and of classical Sanskrit 
poetry (most recently, with Csaba Dezs?, the eighth-century 
/Ku??an?mata/ of D?modaragupta).  After four years in Paris, where he 
gave lectures on Indian and Cambodian Sanskrit literature at the ?cole 
pratique des hautes ?tudes (religious science section), he is now back 
once again in Pondicherry.

*Harunaga Isaacson*studied in Groningen (MA 1990) and was awarded a PhD 
in Sanskrit by the University of Leiden in 1995. After holding positions 
for research and teaching at the Universities of Oxford, Hamburg and 
Pennsylvania, he was appointed Professor of Classical Indology in the 
Department of Indian and Tibetan Studies, Asien-Afrika-Institut, 
Hamburg, in 2006. His main research areas are: tantric traditions in 
pre-13^th -century South Asia, especially Vajray?na Buddhism; classical 
Sanskrit poetry; classical Indian philosophy; and Pur??ic literature.
