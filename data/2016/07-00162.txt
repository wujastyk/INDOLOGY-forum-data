Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sandhi breaks in longer meters

I?ve just had a quick look at an edition of the Saundaryalahar?, in ?ikhari?? (17 syllables to a line), and sandhi is broken only between half verses and whole verses. For example, there's a ?  at the end of one half-line followed by a c at the beginning of the next.
