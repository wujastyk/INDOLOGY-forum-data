Dear Friends,

A yoga-teacher friend of mine just showed me a highly embellished picture
of the yantra for an?hata cakra. I have attached the picture. As you can
see, all of the 12 petals are represented with their b?ja sounds, however,
instead of ??, the second petal has ? ??. I'm curious to know if this is a
mistake on the artists behalf or is it an alternative b?ja mantra, if so,
why, and is there any textual source as to why this alternative symbol
might be used.
Thank you.


All the best,
