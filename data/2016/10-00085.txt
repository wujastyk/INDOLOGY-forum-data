[INDOLOGY] Kalapattana, black men, and some medical terms
Dear Martin,
Regarding *v?nti* and *chardi*:* v?nti* seems to only be used in later
medical texts, ??r?gadharasa?hit? (13th/14th century) onwards, and is also
found in iatrochemical (alchemical) texts. In the ??r?gadharasa?hit?, it
occurs in the context of a metallic preparation, which, if prepared
according to rule, will not produce* v?nti*. So, here the difference is
between vomiting as a reaction to poisoning and vomiting as a disease
category (chardi is used in the latter sense in the ??r?gadharasa?hit?). My
impression (this was a very quick look) is that* v?nti *and* chardi*
otherwise are interchangeable.
Re k?sapitt?tis?ra: it should divide into k?sa (cough - there are different
kinds of k?sa, it's a category of disease) and pitt?tis?ra, flux caused by
pitta (one of three humoral substances, or do?as). Pitt?tis?ra already
occurs in the A????gah?dayasa?hit?.
Then, it should be pittak?mal?, k?mal? (something like jaundice) caused by
pitta.
Very best,
Dagmar
