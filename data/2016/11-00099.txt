[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] Passing of Ludo Rocher
Dear Friends,
I want to belatedly express my sadness over the passing of my great 
guru. (I had been traveling in Australia and did not get the sad news 
promptly.)
But what can I say that hasn't already been said? -- it is all true. The 
years I spent studying with him back in the early 70's were in many ways 
the best years of my life. I look back on them with great pleasure and 
fond memories.
A great and a good man.
Rich
