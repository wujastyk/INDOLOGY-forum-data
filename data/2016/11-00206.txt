[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
In connection to contemporary "field works? on ?Indian astrology,? the works by Yano and Guenzi are helpful. There must be scholarly works on the subject in English which I am not aware of. Yano?s work is particularly interesting as it documented the transition from traditional Indian astrology to modern Indian astrology where some astrologers were still capable of preparing the Pa?c??ga in the traditional ways instead of relying on the data from government observatory. The irony of modernization and popularization of ?Vedic astrology? means that most practitioners these days would rely on their PC or mobile applications to generate horoscopes without truly understanding the science behind them as their predecessors, at least some, did.
