Dear Prof. Paturi, 
thank you very much for sharing your thoughts on the subject, These were, in fact, more or less exactly the same concerns that I had when thinking over the above statement. I have now also started wondering, if the subtle difference in the approaches to ?k??k?? (a more question-oriented *anvayapratiyogivi?ayakajij??s? of the ??m??saka-s and more ?grammatical" *abhidh?n?paryavas?nam of naiy?yika-s, both general definitions taken from the ??bdabodham?m??s?) may be of some relevance here.
In any case, I still consider it likely that the article authors (S. Pollock and NVP Unithiri, as I mentioned in my first mail) were referring to the textual history rather than the conceptual framework of the ??stra-s. 
best regards, 
Andrey
