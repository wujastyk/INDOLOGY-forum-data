Dear Prof. Paturi, 

thank you very much for sharing your thoughts on the subject, These were, in fact, more or less exactly the same concerns that I had when thinking over the above statement. I have now also started wondering, if the subtle difference in the approaches to ?k??k?? (a more question-oriented *anvayapratiyogivi?ayakajij??s? of the ??m??saka-s and more ?grammatical" *abhidh?n?paryavas?nam of naiy?yika-s, both general definitions taken from the ??bdabodham?m??s?) may be of some relevance here.
In any case, I still consider it likely that the article authors (S. Pollock and NVP Unithiri, as I mentioned in my first mail) were referring to the textual history rather than the conceptual framework of the ??stra-s. 

best regards, 
Andrey
(I am quite far from being a professor, but thank you very much for your respectful address)

In the da???nvaya method (followed e.g. by Mallin?tha), the subject is taken first and the prose order of the verse is logically drawn without including questions.

I read that the commentarial styles of da??a- and kha???nvaya- stem from (the linguistic theories? textual history? of) ny?ya- and m?m??s? respectively. As far as at least the the linguistic theories go (I talk of their ??bdabodha-aspect now), I don?t see any compulsive reason for this strict differentiation.
