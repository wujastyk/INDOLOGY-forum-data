[INDOLOGY] New article on Sanskrit
Yes, some of the spoken Sanskrit activists believe in your approach.
But the traditional scholars among whom Sanskrit has been surviving as
spoken language through a paramparaa do not find problem with sandhis are
long compounds.
My observation is, even the new learners once they get the hang of it,
enjoy doing sandhis and using long compounds, using idiomatic ways such as
passive voice (in contrast to the preference for active voice in a fresh
learner), bahuvreehis etc.
If you see the language of the plays both in Prakrit and Sanskrit portions,
there is a balance. Sandhis are not broken. But too long compounds are
avoided.
