[INDOLOGY] signs on arrowhead
A colleague, running an excavation in the Egyptian eastern desert, has consulted me about the signs on an arrowhead that she has excavated ? see photos attached. It would date to the 3rd c. BCE. These signs ring no bells for me. Do they for anyone in this learned forum?
Thank you.
