Subject: [INDOLOGY] signs on arrowhead
Message-ID: <HE1PR0801MB1772FE69952D69558EF8537FA51C0@HE1PR0801MB1772.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

A colleague, running an excavation in the Egyptian eastern desert, has consulted me about the signs on an arrowhead that she has excavated ? see photos attached. It would date to the 3rd c. BCE. These signs ring no bells for me. Do they for anyone in this learned forum?


Thank you.
