Use of the terminology of ?r?a pray?ga  is independent of Rama's placement
in tr?t? yuga.  ?r?a pray?ga is a term used to 'justify' /make sense of
'the irregularities' with reference to ' Paninian s?dhutva'. It is
anchored on the view of  language of the r??i authors of the books being a
different 'dialect' of Sanskrit taking shape on account of their different
settlement pattern, different life style, and as a result different
attitude towards (s?dhutva of ) speech.
It is has another implication: It implies that those who want to look for
?i??a pray?ga for the authority for correct usage should not emulate that
usage while not considering that as as?dhu.
