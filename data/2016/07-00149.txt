Posting for Simone Heidegger who is not a list member:

The Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t in Munich, Germany invites applications for
two PhD scholarships for dissertation projects related to Buddhism.

Deadline for applications: 16 October 2016
Start of scholarship: summer or autumn 2017
Duration of scholarship: 3 or 4 years
Scholarship amount: 1000 ? per month + insurance + support for rent +
travel lump sums + 460 ? per year
Scholarship donor: German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)

The selection process comprises two stages: Applications are sent to the
Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies in Munich. The program will select
promising candidates, who then have to submit their materials to the DAAD.
It is expected that the successful candidates will be chosen and informed
by February 2017.

The prerequisites for application are non-German citizenship, a Master of
Arts or Magister Artium degree or equivalent, excellent knowledge of at
least one Buddhist source language, outstanding qualifications in the
subject, and fluency in English. A basic knowledge of German is also
desirable, though not a prerequisite, but willingness to learn
German/improve German language skills will be expected. Applicants should
not have lived in Germany for more than fifteen months at the time of the
submission of their materials to the DAAD (in December or January) and the
last final examination should have taken place no more than six years
before this date.
