[INDOLOGY] From the Mahabharata
Kisari Mohan Ganguly has already taken pity on all of us. Copy-pasted from
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14090.htm
O thou of excellent vows, thou practisest penances with great devotion. Thy
gifts have, therefore, gratified the deities highly, O best of regenerate
ones.
Since thou hast made this gift, in a season of great difficulty, with a
pure heart, thou hast, by this act of thine, conquered Heaven.
Hunger destroys one's wisdom and drives off one's righteous understanding.
One whose intelligence is overwhelmed by hunger casts off all fortitude.
He, therefore, that conquers hunger conquers Heaven without doubt. One's
righteousness is never destroyed as long as one cherishes the inclination
of making gifts.
