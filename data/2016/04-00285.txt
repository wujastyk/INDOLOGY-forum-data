[INDOLOGY] M-W Sanskrit-English Dictionary Co-Authors
Sir Monier Monier-Williams, M.A., K.C.I.E., pays due tribute to his Western
contributors. But I do not find in his Dictionary any mention of his
 Indian contributors' input - no list of Pandits who worked for him -
without them, without their immense knowledge, his Opus Magnum would have
never appeared in print.
I can only wish that someone with access to M-W's working archive would
find documents re M-W's Indian employees and publish their names, more:
using Indian archive materials - their full biograms.
They deserve to be finally brought out of that area of shadow surrounding
colonial Indology.
