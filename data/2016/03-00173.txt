[INDOLOGY] Revolving wheel in ancient Indian literature
That's true Dominik, but we must consider that any tradition that counts 
the days in a year ends up with 360 days, a good divisible number, plus 
5. It happens in Mesoamerican calendars, where those "extra" days are 
considered negative or empty. They are called /nemontemi/ in Nahuatl.
So a symbolical year of 360 plus days doesn't automatically mean that 
its origin is Mesopotamian. 360 can easily be divided by 12 to give 12 
months, and this can be correlated with the 27/28 days in a lunar 
cycle/month. It is not a perfect fit, which is why most calendars end up 
being soli-lunar, with either extra months or days. But 360 is a good 
symbolical number in a decimal system in addition to its importance as a 
sexagesimal one.
