SAsia library post at Library of Congress
My apologies for the late posting (deadline tomorrow, but it might be extended). ?I made a technical booboo in an earlier attempt. ?Anyway, my old position at the LOC has finally been posted, link attached below. ?
NOTA BENE:
1. ?You not absolutely have to be a US citizen.2. ?The language primarily desired is Hindi.3. ?You do not have to have a library science degree. ?(A lot of Area Studies ?librarians have segued from other backgrounds.)
If anyone wants to discuss the advantages or otherwise of USG or LOC employment they are welcome to contact me privately.
Best wishes,
Allen Thrasher
