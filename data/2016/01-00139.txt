Dear John and Mary,
Thank you very much for making available this  treasure store of scholarship and scholarly resources on the R?m?ya?a. It will certainly be a boon to scholars working on all aspects of the R?ma story in all of its innumerable  and endlessly diverse linguistic, regional and religious manifestations.
With all good wishes to you both.
