Dear Friends,

I would like to share with you a new version of the short film *Episode 1:
Imagining Sanskrit Land.*

This is the first episode of several short films I am making about the
'Sanskrit village' Jhiri, which is located in Madhya Pradesh, India. This
ethnographic documentary series is titled 'Imagining Sanskrit Land'. It is
a visual complement to the post-doctoral project I intend to work on.

 Across India there are rumours of rural communities where 'everyone speaks
fluent Sanskrit'. I spent one month in Jhiri during the summer of 2015
documenting the linguistic vitality of vernacular Sanskrit and the
aspirations of this community to transition to only speak Sanskrit and
forego their mother tongue, Malvi. It must be said that the linguistic
reality is very different to what the media presents it as. Less than 10
percent of the village speak any Sanskrit at all.

This film is about the effort it took to actually find the village and
includes some of the original audio/video of the first mention I came
across that inspired this project. There are several villages called
'Jhiri' in this district of MP. We drove around for several hours,
sometimes in circles, while my driver pleaded with me to just turn around
and go home. Finally, around dusk we found it.

The film is embedded in my academia site:
