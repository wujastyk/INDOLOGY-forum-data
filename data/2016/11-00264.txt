Note also what Oberlies, "A Grammar of Epic Sanskrit" says about
"irregularities" in epic sanskrit in his introduction..
"The language of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana may certainly be called
Sanskrit when compared with contemporary Middle Indo-Aryan but it is a
Sanskrit which continually deviates from the norms codified by Panini.
This is not because such 'aberrant' forms were pre-Paninian.  For the Epics
(and in fact only the Mahabharata) know only a handful - moreover rather
doubtful - Vedisms. ......Almost always it is metrical exigencies which
forced the poets to use a form not sanctioned by traditional grammar....the
"irregularities' are very often found at a metrically relevena position of
the stanza: "Metre surpasses grammar".
