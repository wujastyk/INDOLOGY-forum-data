[INDOLOGY] Who in Bonn in 1914 would have wanted to see this manuscript?
I considered the possibility of a request for Th. Stcherbatsky some months ago. The account of Stcherbatsky?s life and career at http://www.orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=com_personalities&Itemid=74&person=242 mentions that he mostly read m?m??s? treatises in Varanasi during a trip to India in 1910-1911. This report, together with the report in the same article that he began teaching at the Department of Sanskrit in St. Petersburg University in 1900, seemed to me to make it unlikely that he would have asked his former teacher in Bonn to ask for the manuscript on his behalf. He would have in my opinion asked for it on his own. Stcherbatsky mentions having looked at manuscripts in the then library of the Queen?s College while in Varanasi, but he does not mention having looked at the ny?yaka?ik? manuscript (A short report on the trip to India, in Harish Chandra-Gupta, translator, Further Papers of Stcherbatsky, Calcutta, 1971, pages 3-8).
I recall having read "?ber die Ny?yaka?ik? des V?caspatimi?ra und die indische Lehre vom kategorischen Imperativ", in: Beitr?ge zur Literaturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte Indiens. Festgabe Hermann Jacobi zum 75. Geburtstag (11.2.1925), dargebracht von Freunden, Kollegen und Sch?lern, ed. by Willibald Kirfel. Bonn, 1926, S. 369-380. many years ago. I cannot remember if I have a xerox copy. If a list member can provide a pdf, I will be most grateful.
I looked at Stcherbatsky?s Buddhist Logic, but failed to find any reference to his interest in a manuscript of ny?yaka?ik?. He used the printed edition that appeared before his 1910-1911 trip to India.
