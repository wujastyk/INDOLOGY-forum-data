Dear Dominik,

Though I can shed no light on the question of the internet domain in particular,
When I tried to contact Namami when I was in New Delhi last November I found
them to be in total disarray. They have lacked a director for some time, it seems,
and their entire situation was on almost every level unclear.

Really too bad.

all best,
Matthew
