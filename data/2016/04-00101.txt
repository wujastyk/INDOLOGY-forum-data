Thank you both.?
I?m currently awaiting a response from prof. Juergensmeyer.
The mentioned book is probably what I'm looking for, although the title makes me uncertain. Either way, it?s currently out of my reach.
Greetings,

Dear?Jaros?aw,
It seems that the University of Chicago has an edition (Allahabad,?Matabai Praya?ga Presa, 1884):?Pothi? sa?ra bacana Ra?dha?sva?mi? : nazama ya?ni? chanda mem?. ? Would this be what you are looking for?
Best,

Dear Colleagues,
For a while now I?ve been trying to locate a complete edition of Hindi verses composed by the founder of Radhasoami faith, but to no avail. I have a volume of selected?Hindi verses form the S?r Bacan, and a full English translation, but not the complete Hindi collection.
I would be very grateful if someone could help me in finding a physical or digital copy of this compilation.
With kind regards,
