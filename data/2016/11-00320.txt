Subject: [INDOLOGY] Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar, Archive.org
Message-ID: <CAKA8X414WxGvRn4XqcqUZq=aHON8ZiqidUY4b7YFkz-tQsdGuw@mail.gmail.com>

HI All

Someone kindly uploaded a scanned pdf, etc., of Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar
to Archive.org.

Pages 237-242 are missing (and other pages are quite dark)

Might someone have access to a clean, complete copy and be able to
re-upload it?

Cheers
James
