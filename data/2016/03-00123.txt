For the origin of c?na, Geoff Wade in his Sino-Platonic Paper did an excellent job summarizing all the discussions so far. The various proposals include Qin?, Jin?, Latter Qin??, as well as Wade's own suggestion of Yelang??. Unless we have more convincing arguments, it seems that we don't have enough evidence to say which is the definite answer. Personally, I would rule out Qin? on phonological (voicing) and historical grounds. Chinese referring themselves as descendent of Qin or that the memory of Qin gets stuck among foreigners centuries after the short-lived Qin Empire ended is not impossible but rather unlikely. Wade's own derivation of ?ina from Yelang appears somewhat convoluted and some of his arguments are based on the outdated Indological scholarship that assumes everything from the Artha??stra and Mah?bh?rata come before 300 BC.
