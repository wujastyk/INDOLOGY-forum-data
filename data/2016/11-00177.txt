[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
Martin, not exactly. This was precisely my point. Dikshit did refer to horoscopy under Vedic astrology. See ?J?taka branch of astrology? under ?Atharva jyoti?a? in the section Veda?ga (Vol.1 p.97-98). Things might have come to the forefront in recent time, but such ideas have certainly been around.
