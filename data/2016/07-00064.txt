[INDOLOGY] Two etymologies
Yes, quite wild, if I may say so.
Tak?aka as 'builder' (Polish 'budowniczy', Czech 'stavitel'), 'construction
foreman' sounds reasonable, quite convincing.
Now, Uttanka? One who 'ruins', 'lays waste' (Turner 5628, ta?c ? ?contract,
coagulate?)?
See this Mbh episode (Kumbakonam 1906 Ed.), where Uttanka, while trying to
enter Taksaka's underground home, violently destroys its entrance.
