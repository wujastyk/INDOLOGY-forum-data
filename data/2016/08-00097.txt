Thank you for this information Suresh.

   1. Please don't use ? for transcribing the half nasal. ? is used for
   anusv?ra in ISO-15919. Sinhala should be using ISO-15919, not IAST. ? is
   not used in ISO-15919.

   3. *m? should serve your purposes for representing the labial
   prenasalized consonant *? (U+0DB9 SINHALA LETTER AMBA BAYANNA)
This is of course a workable work-around but the ISO 15919 standard for
this letter is m with chandra over it not chandrabindu.  Suresh can you
confirm if there is a unicode letter of m with chandra over it.  Is there a
procedure to add new letters to Unicode.  I would think its reasonable that
all ISO 15919 letters were included in Unicode as single glyphs.
Thanks,
