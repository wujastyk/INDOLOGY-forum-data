[INDOLOGY] further sad news
Dear list members,
apart from Teun Goudrian and Max Sparreboom August 2016 claimed one more
life among our friends and colleagues: Anna Maria Quagliotti left this
world on August 17 at Rome while recovering from a minor surgery, only one
year after retreating from her teaching obligations at the University of
Naples. She has published extensively on Gandharan art. Together with G.
Fussman she was instrumental in establishing SEECHAC (Soci?t? Europ?enne
pour l'Etude des Civilisations de l'Himalaya et de l'Asie Centrale) which
she directed as Vice President until her demise.
Her last home is the family chapel in the Val de Non, Trentino.
