[INDOLOGY] by chance, accidentally
Chance is not the same as fate, I agree. When individuals are affected by
events occurring by chance, it is attributed to their fate. In the key
events in Ramayana and Mahabharata which are attributed to pure chance and
power of fate, the folk songs articulating popular exegesis lament that the
individuals are affected by  events occurring by chance, and attribute
it to the fate of the individuals.
