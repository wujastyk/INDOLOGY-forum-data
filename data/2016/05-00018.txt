[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Summer School @ Harvard
Dear All,
There still are a number of slots open for this year?s Sanskrit Summer School. 
Registration is open until May 15, after that only with a (relatively small) extra fee.
Background: two of our best PhDs over the past 25 years have emerged from this course! 
You will earn a one year credit in these fast-paced classes, during nearly eight intense weeks. 
As time allows, the cultural background of the sentences/stories we read will be provided.
The course prepares you for the (initial) use of Sanskrit in conversation with Pandits, for further reading and graduate research about Hindu & Buddhist Nepal and India. 
Spend your summer in leafy Harvard Yard and enjoy the July 4th concert & fireworks across the river in Boston!
Colleagues, please let your students and others interested know!
Thanks,
Michael WItzel
