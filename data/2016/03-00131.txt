The following provides a concrete example of the use of "mah?c?na/e"  the
the context of the practice of Sanskrit Buddhism in the ca. 13th century.
Mah?c?na, is widely known among the Newar Buddhists as the homeland of
Ma?ju?r? Bodhisattva. It occurs in the Svayambh?pura?a and other references
to Ma?ju?r?. According to Paul Williams, reference to this connection of
manjusri to Wutai is found in the Avatamsaka, (Williams, Paul. *Mahayana
Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.* 2000. p. 227).
In the famous iconographic set in a Nepalese Astasahasrika (Cambridge 1643)
Mah?c?ne occurs three times once for *Ma?jugho?a? *[folio 202v], once for
*Samantabhadra?* [folio 127r], and once for* Buddhar?paka Lokan?tha?*
[folio 123v]. Since this manuscript is in Sanskrit, it may be that Mah?c?na
was a term known in India at the time ca. 12-13th Cent century.
