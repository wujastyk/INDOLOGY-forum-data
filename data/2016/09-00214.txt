[INDOLOGY] French textbooks in pdf
Dear colleagues,
On behalf of two students from Indonesia, who are preparing to come and study Sanskrit/Indology in France, having made a heroic effort to learn French, I am seeking pdfs of a number of textbooks.
Would anyone be able to help me get the following in pdf?
Biardeau, Madeleine. 1995. L'hindouisme: anthropologie d'une civilisation. Paris: Flammarion.
Filliozat, Pierre-Sylvain. 1992. Le sanskrit. Paris: Presses universitaires de France.
Meyer, ?ric. 2007. Une histoire de l'Inde: les Indiens face ? leur pass?. Paris: A. Michel.
Many thanks. Other textbooks of this kind, notably on Buddhism, are also welcome.
Merci.
