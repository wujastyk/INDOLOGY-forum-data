Dear Colleagues,

I am forwarding a request by a colleague expert of Persian and Arabic 
literature. I would be very grateful for your help.


''I have heard that the earliest mention of the Lemon might be in the 
Charaka Samhita or another Ayurvedic text. Is this true? Do you have any 
references to this?

The first mention in Arabic seems to be mid-9th-century.

I would much appreciate any help you could give.''

Best wishes,

Camillo Formigatti
