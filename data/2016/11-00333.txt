[INDOLOGY] Yoga in "The History of Philosophy without any gaps"
Dear Colleagues,
Some of you may already be aware of the project by Peter Adamson and
Jonardon Ganeri to present ?The History of Philosophy *without any gaps*
<http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/>? online in a series of podcasts.
Recently, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Peter Adamson in
setting up an episode on philosophical yoga, which was just published
online here <http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/yoga-maas>. I hope that you
may find this as well as the other episodes of ?The History of
Philosophy *without
any gaps*? useful for general information and teaching purposes.
Best wishes,
Philipp Maas
