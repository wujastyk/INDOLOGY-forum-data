In his obituary of MM. Prof. S. Kuppuswami Sastri, V. Raghavan says, ?Kuppuswami by the popular name and Venkatavarma by his Sa?sk?ra-name, he was the fourth son of Seturama Ayyar?? (New Indian Antiquary, April, 1944, p.17. The link was given by Manu Francis in another post). How common is ?varma' as a part of the Sa?sk?ra-name of Brahmins?
Thanks in advance
