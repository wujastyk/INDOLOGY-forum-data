Dear Indology Listmembers,

I have been looking in the usual places for access to a .pdf copy of the following article and would greatly appreciate it if any of you could offer one:  

Richard Salomon, "Notes on the Translations of KalhaNa?s RAjataraGgiNI (I?IV). _Berliner Indologische Studien_ 3 (1987): 149?179.

Thank you. 

Sincerely,
John
