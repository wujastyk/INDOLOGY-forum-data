[INDOLOGY] query about an inscribed object
Slight correction:
The text reads ?? ?????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ????? ?? k?r?gar v?r
bh??? re v?s jodhapur j?t suth?r
('re' being a postposition denoting possession)
Parts of the object may well have been a weapon at some point, but it is
doubtful that its current form would have worked as such.  The hinged mouth
and modern filister bolt on one end make it unlikely that anything could
have been discharged from that side; unless the large ring on the other
side could be removed (like a plug), it also seems an unlikely muzzle.
Still, stranger looking objects have functioned as weapons.  (And many
parts of decorative and useful objects were and are still repurposed in
Rajasthan.)
Best,
Tyler
