Dear Friends,
I have been trying to make contact with people involved in the production
of the daily Sanskrit news produced through Doordarshan (DD). It is
uploaded to YouTube. There is a daily 5-min clip and a weekly 30-min clip.
Here is today's broadcast:

My intention is to analyse spoken Sanskrit in various registers and
domains. I want to use corpus linguistic software to analyse as much spoken
Sanskrit as I can. The inclusion of 'news Sanskrit' is an important aspect
to this project.
I have, rather tediously, been trying to transcribe these clips. In an
attempt to fast-track this process it would be preferable to obtain digital
copies of the transcripts the presenter reads from the teleprompter.
Over the past couple of months I have found emails of people involved at DD
and sent several emails to various people involved politely asking for
their help. I have not had a single response. I thought that someone on
this list might have a contact and be able/willing to help or intercede on
my behalf?
All the best,
