=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Origin_of_Mah=C4=81c=C4=ABna?=
Dear colleagues,
I believe there are textual issues with the Artha??stra and Mah?bh?rata which make the dating of those passages with references to c?na, c?nabh?mija, c?napa??a, etc rather difficult. Many Sanskrit astral texts contain k?rmavibh?ga type of descriptions, correlating directions with country names and thus give us some clues of the geographical knowledge of the authors. In early Indo-Greek works like Yavanaj?taka and V?ddhayavanaj?taka, there is no reference to c?na. In Var?hamihira's B?hatsa?hit? (6th century) we find c?na in the the long list of place names belonging to the direction NE:
14.29ab/ ai??ny?? merukana??ar?jyapa?up?lak?rak??m?r??/
14.29cd/ abhis?radaradata?ga?akul?ta*sairindhra[K.sairindha]vanar???r??//
14.30ab/ brahmapurad?rva??maravanar?jyakir?tac?nakau?ind??/
14.30cd/ *bhall?? pa?ola[K.bhall?palola]ja??sura*kuna?akhasa[K.kuna?hakha?a]gho?akucik?khy??//
Elsewhere, c?na appeared 8 more times in the text for various types of predictions. So for Var?hamihira, the idea of c?na was quite certain.
As for Dan's comment on the origin of China, or even c?na, I don't think it can be so easily answered. Qin? was indeed the first Chinese empire, but it was very short-lived and there is no source I am aware of that Chinese ever referred themselves as people from Qin; or conversely, I am not aware of the knowledge of the Qin Empire in non-Chinese sources. Chinese referring themselves as people from various dynasties did become common later on, and indeed in the Chinese Buddhist texts, the reference to the people of Qin?, that is referring to Later Qin (384 - 471 CE), is found frequently. 
But there are earlier sources which should be mentioned here. In Shijia fangzhi ????, a quote attributed Chengguanzi??? of Later Han, dated 205 CE, referred China as ??? - country of Zhendan (from C?nasth?na?). Later all, similar Chinese translations ?????????????? are found frequently in early Buddhist texts throughout first half of the first millennium. This seems to add a Central Asian factor to "c?na", since c?nasth?na is not attested in Sanskrit sources. It is possible that the Sanskrit "c?na" was adopted from this earlier "c?nasth?na" or similar variants used in Central Asia. "C?na" was translated into Chinese only later, appeared as ?? (zhina) in Narendraya?as' Chinese translation dated late sixth century CE, followed by the more common ?? (zhina).
