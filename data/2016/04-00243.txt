Dear Sven,

Thank you for pointing this out. Yes, in a compound I'd put a hyphen, not a space.

With best wishes,

Dermot

Dear Dermot and Christophe,

yotsya iti does not seem to be a proper example, because it is no compound. I personally 
would use a hyphen, like so: 

mana-indriya-

Best wishes,
Sven

    Dear Christophe,

    The usual practice in roman script is to separate the two vowels with a space, showing 
    that they are not a diphthong but belong to two different syllables. E.g.

    mana + indriya- = mana indriya-

    I don't think that looks strange. You can see it for instance in Edgerton's Bhagavadgita 
    (Harvard U. Press, 1952) ch 2 verse 9c: na yotsya iti govindam (na + yotsye + iti).

    By the way, what distinguishes the separate vowels from the diphthong in nagari is not 
    the space (which isn't always marked in manuscripts) but the fact that the second 
    vowel (in your case the i) is written with a character, not with a stroke added to a 
    consonant character. This makes a space possible, though not necessary. Indeed, 
    such hiatus can occur within a word, which is rare in Sanskrit (e.g. pra'uga "the forepart 
    of the shafts of a chariot; triangle"), but common in Prakrit. Here, it would be very odd 
    to write a space, since it's within a word. I've marked the hiatus with an apostrophe, but 
    Monier-Williams does it with diaeresis/tr?ma (two superscript dots).

    I hope that solves your doubts quicker than Arjuna's.

    With best wishes,

    Dermot

Dear List,
    is there a way in Roman script for distinguishing in a compound the result of - a + 
    vowel other than a which could be i =  a i, with hiatus, from the diphthong ai resulting from a/a 
    + e/ai ?
    ex. mana + indriya- = manaindrya- (?) beside manasa + aindriya = manasaindriya
    In n?gar? script I find written mana indrya- with a space put between the two members, but it 
    would look strange in Roman script.
    Any suggestion welcome.
    Best wishes,
    Christophe Vielle
