Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sheldon Pollock's Rasa Reader
Message-ID: <CAKq175qn_idwCcv-pT2C8HYZy0Hx5+NyPFR_uNxna5d2U17Hzg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Many will be thrilled to know that Sheldon Pollock's *A Rasa Reader:
Classical Indian Aesthetics* is now available. To quote Robert Goldman on
the work:

"*A Rasa Reader* is the product of enormous erudition in both the Indian
and European traditions of the philosophy and science of aesthetics, and it
will make a unique and powerful contribution to scholars in several areas.
No other work of which I am aware enables even the lay reader to grasp the
elusive concept of *rasa*, its relationship to the psychology of emotion,
and the way in which successive authors redefined the meaning and locus of
the aesthetic response"

*A Rasa Reader* is available at the following links:

All the best,
