Thanks, Hans. Combined Characters such as *m? *should survive through
multiple transmissions across different platforms, as long as the
applications utilized are fully compatible with Unicode.

Technically speaking, I believe the problems you have had with your
wonderful volume are not really single-glyph characters vs. multi-glyph
characters, but Unicode vs. non-Unicode. As you may know, the standard for
extended Latin characters predates Unicode. For example, ISO 8859-1
includes many commonly used symbols for Indological transliteration such as
 ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? was first published in March 1985. Many
non-Unicode applications support these extended Latin characters, and
therefore you find them survive through multiple transmissions (Unicode is
compatible with these Latin extensions as well).

However, many of the new characters added for the Unicode standard, will
not survive through the use of non-Unicode applications, whether they are
single glyph or multi-glyph. For example, ? (Latin Capital Letter B with
dot above) is a single glyph character, but I am pretty sure it will not
survive transmission through non-Unicode applications (let's see how many
find ? in their emails correctly).

Alas, until the computing world rids itself of all pestiferous non-Unicode
applications, perhaps, we will have to deal with the headaches of
diacritics!

Suresh.
