[INDOLOGY] New article on Sanskrit
Sorry for the obvious mistake in my previous message: Please read  
"long-short-long-long-short-short" instead of  
"long-short-long-long-short-long". The corrected message runs:
It is not metrically clumsy; praj?? viveka? labhate forms a regular  
bha-vipul? (structure ra-bha with regard to syllables 2-7:  
long-short-long-long-short-short).
Best wishes,
Roland Steiner
