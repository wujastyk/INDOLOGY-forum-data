Dear David,
Oberlies, A Grammar of Epic Sanskrit, 6.5 Constructions with maa (page 184)
 refers to this specific verse 1.2.14 and its use of an augmented aorist
with maa.  "To express a prohibition the partical maa is used - as a rule -
with unaugmented forms of the aorist.  In Epic Sanskrit, however, the
augment is occasionally not dropped.
maa . . . agamaH, R.2.14 ....[more references from MBh and R ]...."
But more importantly Oberlies  makes a reference  in a footnote to an
article on this stanza. "On this stanza see  Kolver (1985. 32 n.7)"
