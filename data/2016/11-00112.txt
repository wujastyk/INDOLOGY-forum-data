[INDOLOGY] bhakti
Luis,
I am bringing up comparative study which distinguishes the modern cultural
study from the pre-modern one.
Most of what you say, 'invoking Vedas and Vedic knowledge', sectarian
claims etc. are all textual and are applicable to the 'academic' sections
of the 'educated' or some such sections of the 'elite'. You expressed
awareness of this when you said, " It can be a different matter for the
everyday believer, who doesn't need to be bothered with theological
distinctions." But the point is that it is the everyday believers who are
the majority and what is found in a small minority can not be generalized
for the whole.
Even while working on the textual aspect or this minority of  'academic'
sections of the 'educated' , each case being studied on its own merits
yields a more complex understanding than a reductionist one.
