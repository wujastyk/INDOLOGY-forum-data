[INDOLOGY] Revolving wheel in ancient Indian literature
The idea of a rotating wheel of time goes all the way back to the Rigveda:
dv?da??ra? na hi taj jar?ya vavarti cakram pari dy?m ?tasya (don't have the
textual ref at hand).  The idea of the spokes of the wheel going up and
down is referred to in Sanskrit lit in many places with expressions like
cakra-nemi-krama and cakr?rapa?kti.
