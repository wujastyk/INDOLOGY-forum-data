Early Evidence of Christianity in India
Dear Colleagues,
I am currently working on Christianity?s presence in first millennium South Asia for an article for a new, rather inclusive, companion to Late Antiquity.
I am familiar with the patristic sources and, of course, the Acts of Thomas.
I am concerned to track down evidence on the Indic side (such as the famous  ?stone cross inscriptions? or the copper plates of king Ven???).
Can anyone help me to make sure I have not missed anything important? 
With Thanks,
