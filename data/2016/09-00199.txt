[INDOLOGY] New article on Sanskrit
Dear Ananya,
Thanks for sharing this valuable argument and position, which not only
deserves close and critical attention of Sanskritists all over the world,
it also deserves to be translated, at least for its main outlines, into
Hindi, Urdu and especially Sanskrit, in order to reach those most directly
concerned.
Let us take one out of numerous important points in your argument:
?It's [Sanskrit is] part of everything that has to be fought over
to protect the diversity and inclusiveness of India, its secular state and
its
egalitarian Constitution.?
How to say this in Sanskrit?
Several possibilities, here is my proposal:
???????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????,
??????? ??????????-?????????-???????????? ? ???????????????????????? ?
??????????? ?
After all, why should we systematically refuse to speak the language of
those about whom we are discussing ? Nevertheless, in Sanskrit studies this
is exactly what has been going on since at least the beginning of the 19th
century.
And was it not precisely the exclusive focus on the archival function and
the systematic neglect of the communicative function of Sanskrit which
contributed significantly to its antiquarianization and to the complete
marginalization of contemporaneous carriers of the Sanskrit tradition?
Q: Was Sanskrit then a living language or means of communication when it
was discovered by westerners ? R: A crucial personality is here Melputt?r
N?r?ya?a Bha??a : on the one hand he argued, in the beginning of the 17th
century, for a liberal approach to Sanskrit grammar and gives a P??inian
grammar of ?living? Sanskrit
on the other hand he was aware of westerners who show both lack of respect
and curiosity for Brahmins (tantudh?rin) and their teachings (C. Rajendran
2008: 64 referring to Prabandhama?jar? ed. N.P. Unni p. 295-296).
In order to deal AT ONCE with the lack of awareness of Sanskrit and its
precious heritage outside India (not counting the very small number of
specialists dispersed over a few academic institutions) AND the danger of
its one-sided excess within India, I propose to invoke the regulatory
concept of ?ideodiversity? (??-???????, which, within cultural and
intellectual evolution, is or could be what ?biodiversity? ???-??????? is
within biological evolution):
see my article ?La ideodiversidad como valor planetario?
which recently appeared in: Eadem utraque Europa : revista de historia
cultural e intelectual,

The entire article can be briefly summarized in Sanskrit by referring to
the view of Bhartrhari
praj?? viveka? labhate bhinnair ?gama-dar?anai? |
kiyad v? ?akyam unnetu? svatarkam anudh?vat? ||
(view of Bhartrhari as formulated probably by his student: note, in
addition to other arguments, the exceptional and unnecessary metrical
clumsiness in p?da a ; to write a metrically more smooth p?da a would not
have been that difficult, for instance : praj?? vivekit?? y?ti)
Best wishes,
Jan
