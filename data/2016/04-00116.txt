Are the author and the the report reliable? I searched the 477-page summary
table report document of suggested revisions to Draft History-Social
Science Framework (available from
http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/cc/cd/documents/hsssummarypubcomments.doc). The
word does not occur *even once *in the document. Then from where did the
author pull this statement (italics mine):

Quote
Right-wing Hindu groups are seeking to gloss over Indian history and deny
the reality of caste discrimination *by deleting the word ?Dalit? *from the
history textbooks in California.
Unquote

Can somebody point to a source which corroborates the claim regarding the
word Dalit by the author?
