Are the author and the the report reliable? I searched the 477-page summary

Science Framework (available from

word does not occur *even once *in the document. Then from where did the
author pull this statement (italics mine):
Quote
Right-wing Hindu groups are seeking to gloss over Indian history and deny
the reality of caste discrimination *by deleting the word ?Dalit? *from the
history textbooks in California.

Can somebody point to a source which corroborates the claim regarding the
word Dalit by the author?
