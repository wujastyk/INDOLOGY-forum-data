[INDOLOGY] Misunderstood origins
Thank you, Cristophe, for drawing our attention to Jayaratha?s review in
his blog entry, which is definitely worth reading. The entry does, however,
not entirely do justice to Bronkhorst?s position, when it says that ?? one
has to accept this new chronology, which places the Upani?ads *after *Buddhism
rather than before it, ?? (J?s emphasis). Bronkhorst?s position is in fact
a weaker one. He concludes that ?the notion of karmic retribution in the
earliest relevant Upani?adic (i.e. Vedic) passages has been added to
material that is devoid of it? (GM p. 122). If I understand this correctly,
Bronkhorst takes the older Upani?ads in their present form as the result of
an redactorial process, in which the (sporadic) references to
karma-and-rebirth theories were added to textual passages exclusively
dealing with rebirth (but not with karmic retribution as its cause).
I wonder whether critical editions of the older and middle Upani?ads could
not provide a more solid basis for research in the early religious history
of South Asia than the presently available editions do.
Best wishes,
Philipp
