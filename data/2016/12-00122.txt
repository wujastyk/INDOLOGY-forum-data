[INDOLOGY] Pdf request - South Asia Archive
Dear List members,
I'd be most grateful for a pdf of the following article:
Barua (1947) "The Background of Ajakalapaka (Ajakalaka) Yakkha and
Assamukhi Yakkhini In The Indus Mythology", Indian Culture, volume XIV,
issue 1.
It can be downloaded from South Asia Archive <
http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120020/205231>, but it is
inaccessible to me.
With many thanks in advance,
Chiara Policardi
