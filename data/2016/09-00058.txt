[INDOLOGY] Professor Bansidhar Bhatt (1929-2016)
It is very sad to report that Professor Bansidhar Bhatt (1929-2016), one of
the stalwarts of Jaina-Studies in the last forty years, has passed away on
4 September 2016. Professor Bhatt was awarded the degree of Dr. Phil. from
the Free University of Berlin in 1977 on The Canonical Nik?epa: Studies in
Jaina Dialectics (Leiden 1978). He was Professor of Indology at Panjab
University in Patiala 1977-1985 (Mah?v?ra Chair for Jaina Studies) and from
1985 until his retirement at the University of M?nster in Germany.
Professor Bhatt is renowned for his outstanding work on technical Jaina
philosophy. Most of his ground-breaking articles have been re-published by
the Sharadaben Chimmanbhai Educational Research Centre in Ahmedabad in
2005. Despite his deteriorating health, Professor Bhatt was able to
complete his last book on the Jina P?r?van?tha this year.
