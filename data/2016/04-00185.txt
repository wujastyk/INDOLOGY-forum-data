[INDOLOGY] From the Mahabharata
Dear Cor-respondents,
what worries me in these nice English and Hindi translations is that their
authors kind of omit a delicate problem - presented by the use of  a
*desiderative
*formation from the verb bhuj - bubhuk??. Turner's CDIAL 9286 gives:
"desire to eat, hunger".
Might it not be, that the use of the desiderative points us not to simple
"hunger"? But, perhaps, to "[uncontrolled] craving for food"? To, even,
"gluttony" - as the result of that uncontrolled craving?
An idea of moderation there? Popularly: emotional eating vs. mindful
eating.
What I feel is present there is the warning against and the recommendation
not to succumb to emotions/temptations generated by the idea of food.
Best,
Artur
