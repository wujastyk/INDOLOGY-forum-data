Dear Martin and David,

One reason this phenomenon is called ?r?a is that it is quite common in the epic texts (the texts of the ??i-s) such as, e.g. your G?t? passage.  There are, for example some nine examples in the critical edition (and apparatus) of the Uttarak???a of the V?lm?kir?m?ya?a. 

Best,

Bob

If anyone could point me either to the old posts (assuming that they exist outside my imagination) or to some useful discussion of the phenomenon (does it occur and, if so, where; how is it regarded, etc), I should be most grateful.
