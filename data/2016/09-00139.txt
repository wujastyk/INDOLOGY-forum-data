[INDOLOGY] Double sandhi
Dear Martin and David,
One reason this phenomenon is called ?r?a is that it is quite common in the epic texts (the texts of the ??i-s) such as, e.g. your G?t? passage.  There are, for example some nine examples in the critical edition (and apparatus) of the Uttarak???a of the V?lm?kir?m?ya?a. 
Best,
Bob
