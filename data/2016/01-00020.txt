Dear Venetia,
Beside the itih?sa-pur??a self-proclaiming to relate what really once happened (and so to serve as a proto-history, which is according to me the main function of myths) as it was heard and transmitted (cf. MBh 1,1.48 etc., Rm 1,5.3, etc., E.W. Hopkins Great Epics1901, pp. 50-54, A. Guruge, Society in the Rm 1991, p. 2 ?3, and on the use of sm?ta, ?ruta, ?ruti etc. in epics and pur??as, F.E. Pargiter AITM 1922, pp. 18-21) or even to contain the whole truth (cf. the famous statement of MBh 1,56.33, 18,5.38, which can be understood in this way), an interesting indigenous discussion justifying what could appear as adharmic in these "true" stories of the past is found in Kum?rila's Tantrav?rtikka I, 3, 4, s?tra 7 (translated in French by L. Renou, Anthologie sanskrite 1947, pp. 212-214).
Best wishes,
Christophe
