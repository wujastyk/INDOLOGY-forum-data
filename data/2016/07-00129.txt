[INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari on Mac
Thanks, Steven, for this suggestion.  Fortunately, I still have Office 2011
version on my laptop and I can create a document in it.  I created a test
document in Word 2011, with stacked diacritics like ???, and it worked
fine.  Then, when I opened that test document in Office 360, the stacked
diacritics survived on the previously entered text, but Office 360 would
not allow me to enter new characters with stacked diacritics.  So,
obviously something did change in Office 360.  On the positive side, Office
360 now allows entering Unicode Devanagari with Devanagari QWERTY keyboard,
something that was not possible on Office 2011.  You lose some and you gain
some.
