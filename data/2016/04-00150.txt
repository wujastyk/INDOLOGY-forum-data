=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Translations_of_Jyotsn=C4=81_commentary_on_the_Ha=E1=B9=ADhayogaprad=C4=ABpik=C4=81?=
Dear list members
I am looking for translations of the Jyotsn? commentary on the
Ha?hayogaprad?pik?.
I could find a Gujarati translation of the commentary on DLI (
http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/421888).
Are there any others?
Thanks, Nity?nanda
