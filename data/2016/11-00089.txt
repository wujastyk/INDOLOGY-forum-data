[INDOLOGY] bhakti
Robert,
The term 'Vedic astrology' is certainly interesting. I have been contacting
astrologers in the West who use this term on their websites. Their
responses as to what they actually mean by it are revealing of a certain
discomfort and cognitive dissonance. One particular respondent said they
did not like the term but it was something of an 'industry standard', so
not using the term was counter productive to their own vocational interest.
They also said that 'Hindu astrology' sounded even 'less authentic'. This
is while knowing that the predictive aspects of 'Vedic astrology' developed
well past the Vedic period.
Personally, I find the phrases 'Vedic capitalism
<http://www.sabhlokcity.com/2012/09/vedic-capitalism-clear-affirmation-of-equality-and-pursuit-of-wealth/>',
'Vedic socialism
<http://www.sabhlokcity.com/2010/08/what-is-vedic-socialism/>' and 'Vedic
communism
<http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/I_think_the_Vedic_concept_of_socialism_or_communism_will_much_improve_the_idea_of_communism>'
to be amongst my favourites.
I wonder if anyone has a .pdf of this book
