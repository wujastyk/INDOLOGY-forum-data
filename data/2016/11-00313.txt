[INDOLOGY] yamas and niyamas
Dear Patrick, Bradley and others,
the question of the origin of the Yamas and Niyamas is indeed a
fascinating one, and I would also be very much interested to hear more
from somebody more knowledgeable about the scriptural evidence of the
five great vows of the Jainas. What I have managed to find so far is
the fourth chapter of the Da?avaik?lika S?tra (Dasave?liya Sutta(?)),
in whose s?tras 11-15 we get five great vows, corresponding to the
yamas in order, but not yet using the familiar terms: 1) pr???tip?t?d
virama?am (=ahi?s?), 2) m???v?d?d virama?am (=satya), 3) adattad?n?d
virama?am (=asteya), 4) maithun?d virama?am (=brahmacarya) and 5)
parigrah?d virama?am (=aparigraha). I am taking these terms from the
sanskrit ch?ya of K.C. Lalwani (1973) who in his foreword dates it to
"around B.C. 429". In the Pra?navy?kara?as?tra (I have access to it
via the 1962 Shri Akhil Bharat S. S. Jain Shastroddhara Samiti edition
from Rajkot, the following passage a quote from the sanskrit ch?ya on
p. 552.) we have "prathama? bhavaty ahi?s?, dvit?ya? satyavacanam iti
praj?aptam | datt?nuj??tasa?vara? ca, brahmacary?(ed. has
'a')parigrahatva? ca || 2 ||" So here we almost arrive at the terms
used by Pata?jali in Yogas?tra 2.30.
Best,
Peter
