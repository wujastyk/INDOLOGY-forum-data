[INDOLOGY] dna and castes
Purusha Suktam - explains how Brahmins form the head, Ksatriyas the arms,
Vaishyas the body, Shudras the feet  - actually 10.90.12
In my ethnographic research I have heard this quoted countless times by
Brahmins as justification as to why they consider themselves superior to
the other classes/castes.
All the best,
