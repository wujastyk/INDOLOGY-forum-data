[INDOLOGY] To post or not to post
"INDOLOGY is an international forum, and this is not the first time that we
have witnessed on the part of some North American colleagues the
presumption that local preoccupations are global ones."
You have to have buried your head pretty far in the sand in order to
propose that sexual harassment is a specifically American problem and so
somehow not also a European problem.
That said, I propose that we now end this discussion. If anyone wants to
criticize me further, feel free to contact me off list.
