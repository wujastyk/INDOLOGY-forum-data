[INDOLOGY] DOT 2013
"And - let me ask: do you now of any works devoted to the question of REUSE
(of texts, ideas, images)?"
There was actually a thread on reuse here on Indology not too long ago,
last July.
You may be interested in this if not aware:

and this: http://link.springer.com/journal/10781/43/2/page/1
and this: https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs (JIABS
36-37/1-2 (2013-2014[2015])) for the section 'Authors and Editors in the
Literary Traditions of Asian Buddhism'
And finally, the next issue of Buddhist Studies Review will be edited by
Elisa Freschi, Jowita Kramer, and Cathy Cantwell and deals with issues of
reuse from our panel at the last IABS congress in Vienna.
Best wishes,
Charles DiSimone
