 Re: [INDOLOGY] Mystery manuscripts
First of all the images you provide are not in order and not showing full leaves, however I was able to identify only one text, that is "bhadrottpatisa.mgraha" in the folio images of no. IMG_2076 and 77. The Ms is written in Grantha script. The text can be read with the help of the Transcript no. T0806b from the Manuscript Library of the IFP, Pondicherry.

Some weeks ago a friend brought in these mystery manuscripts that he purchased in Tamil Nadu 40 years ago. I have taken a dozen images and zipped them together - we?would be?very grateful if anyone could help us identify them
