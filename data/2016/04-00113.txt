As someone who watched my son's essay when he was at school actually get marked down in History because he argued that it did not make sense to talk about what was ?good? about the British Empire, I do get fed up about the huge variations in what counts as enough ?realism? for school children, and how nationalism (and its asociated religious history) regularly whitewashes the past. Looking at undergraduates in Britain, a great deal more of unvarnished reality is needed.
