The mathematics of the *Vedic* altar



Baudh?yana ?ulbas?tra and his commentary ?ulbad?pik?



Edited and translated by Jean-Michel DELIRE, Preface by Pierre-Sylvain
FILLIOZAT



Oriental Studies ? Extreme

As its title indicates, this book offers a translation-edition Baudhayana
?ulbas?tra and its commentary the ?ulbad?pik? composed by Dv?rak?n?tha
before the sixteenth century. Part of the ritual literature of India, the
?ulbas?tras are treaties detailing the construction of altars, offering
tables, sacred enclosures, etc., necessary to the *Vedic sacrifices*.
Dating back to the last centuries before the Christian era, they show that
the Indian mathematical knowledge of that time was comparable to the
knowledge of contemporary civilizations in substance, but very different in
form, revealing its *oral *nature. This edition-translation is accompanied
by a detailed introduction situating mathematical knowledge of ancient
India in its historical evolution, since the end of the civilization of the
Indus to the classical period, and in its ritual context. To do this, the
investigation has not only considered the Baudhayana ?ulbas?tra, but it was
extended to three other ?ulbas?tras (by Apastamba, Manava and Katyayana)
edited and translated (SN Sen and AK Bag, Delhi, 1983) as well as
non-translated edition (D. Srinivasachar and VS Narasimhachar, Mysore,
1931) of one of the comments of the Apastamba ?ulbas?tra, through which the
?ulbad?pik? could be dated.
