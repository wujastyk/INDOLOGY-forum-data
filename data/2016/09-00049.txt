I don't have any solid evidence for this, but I assume that transliteration
was invented for Sanskrit because printing Devanagari was difficult.  It
isn't difficult any more.  All modern computers can make a decent fist of
Devanagari.  So why are we routinely using transliteration at all, any
more?  People writing scholarship on Greek or Russian or Armenian don't use
Latin script.  Why should we?

And if you know any other windmills, I'd be glad to tilt at them too. :-)

Best,
Dominik
