features besides the script should be taken into account. From what I 
can see in the image of the one folio, all codicological and 
paleographical features of the manuscript point toward the 19th century, 
therefore you should not doubt about the veracity of the date provided 
in the colophon (I mean that you can rule out the possibility that the 
scribe wrote the manuscript at a later date, say at the beginning of the 
20th century, copying the colophon with the old date from the 
antigraph).

I have seen several Nepalese manuscripts written in the second half of 
the 19th century, many of which were prepared by the same scribes on 
behalf of Daniel Wright precisely to be sent to Cambridge (one example 
is this one: 
http://sanskrit.lib.cam.ac.uk/the-very-first-leaves-in-the-collections). 
Similarly, there are numerous "colonial" manuscripts scattered all 
across European collections that were written in the 1870s and following 
years in V?r??as?, all by the same scribe (or scribes) on behalf of R. 
T. H. Griffith again for the purpose of sending them to European 
libraries and scholars (for instance, this one: 
http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00876/1). This examples are meant 
to stress again that it is difficult to date a manuscript 
paleographically without taking other aspects into account.

I hope this is useful to you!

Best wishes,
