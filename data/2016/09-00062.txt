[INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks
One might also keep in mind the large number of academic scholars in a number of areas such as Religious Studies, Comparative Literature, Anthropology, Philosophy, History of Science and many more who depend on the monographs, articles and translations of Indologists. Although they may well want to read translations of and  studies on the Upani?ads, the G?t?, K?lid?sa, the R?m?ya?a etc., most would probably not want to have to learn devan?gar?  or any other Indic script to do so.
