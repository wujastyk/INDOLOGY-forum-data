One might also keep in mind the large number of academic scholars in a number of areas such as Religious Studies, Comparative Literature, Anthropology, Philosophy, History of Science and many more who depend on the monographs, articles and translations of Indologists. Although they may well want to read translations of and  studies on the Upani?ads, the G?t?, K?lid?sa, the R?m?ya?a etc., most would probably not want to have to learn devan?gar?  or any other Indic script to do so.

We may think today that Devan?gar? is the ?script? of Sanskrit, but historically it never was, unlike Latin, Greek, Chinese, or Japanese. As anyone who has worked on Sanskrit manuscripts knows, Sanskrit texts were written in regional scripts: Grantha, Telugu, Malayalam, Newari, ??rad?, etc. So there is no exact parallel between Sanskrit and other languages.

My own rule of thumb is that if it is simply a word or sentence within an English article or book, then I use the Latin script, but for texts in Sanskrit (as now the rule with the Murthy Library) I use Devan?gar?. Murthy also has come up with a possible middle ground: putting names of people and places without diacritics, while using them for other Sanskrit terms. But I guess we will never come up with a solution that will satisfy all.

All modern computers can make a decent fist of Devanagari.  So why are we routinely using transliteration at all, any more?  People writing scholarship on Greek or Russian or Armenian don't use Latin script.  Why should we?
