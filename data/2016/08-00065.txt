Subject: [INDOLOGY] Yavana Jataka Sanskrit PDF
Message-ID: <CAJ=BjrATDXZ4pU2ohNbLN7P6xHcxffeGuvTabO7viOzn=mGcvg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I was wondering if anyone has a PDF of the Yavana Jataka in Sanskrit.  I
have David Pingree's translation into English which is widely available
online, but would like the Sanskrit text.

Many thanks,

Tejas Aralere
