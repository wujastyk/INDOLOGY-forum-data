[INDOLOGY] Authenticity of the Vastusutra Upanishad
As a student, I had the opportunity to write a book about Indian bronzes.
So I tried not to rely only on secondary sources and get deeper in primary
sources, but it was a bit frustrating, the contents were kind of
unexpected, not exactly what I would have hope to find. On the contrary,
the Vastusutra Upanishad suited so well to my European mind that I doubted
about its authenticity. I was a beginner and still feel like that after 30
years of research, but now I?ve heard and read that some people actually
think that it might be not authentic. Does anybody knows about articles or
serious research about it?
