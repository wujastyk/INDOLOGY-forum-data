[INDOLOGY] Misunderstood origins
Dear All,
Could you please help me re: Prof. Johannes Bronkhost's article?
"*Misunderstood origins: how Buddhism fooled modern scholarship - and
itself*"
(published in: *The Complex Heritage of Early India*. Essays in Memory of
R. S. Sharma, ed. D. N. Jha, New Delhi: *Manohar, 2014*, pp. 307-325)
ISBN 978-93-5098-058-3
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/9789350980583>
The book is not accessible via Amazon.com. Also Manohar - strangely - does
not recognize the title.Although the book is mentioned on the Professor
Sharma's Wikpipedia page (Reference, second position)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Sharan_Sharma
 Professor Bronkhorst (whom I contacted) is at present far from his home,
and has no way how to access it.
I have a copy of this text,
http://my.unil.ch/serval/document/BIB_C47B43464741.p
<http://my.unil.ch/serval/document/BIB_C47B43464741.pdf>*df*
but it's without original pagination. I must - must! - quote from it, and
that is why I dare to ask you for help.
With regards,
