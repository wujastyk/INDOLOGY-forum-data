We regret that two contributors to the 2011 Bucharest conference have in
the mean time passed away:
Prof. Dr. Braj (Brij) Bihari Chaubey 1940-2014: his contribution ?Some
Salient features of the ??val?yana-Sa?hit?? is in the present volume. Pt.
Narayan (Nanaji) Govind Kale 1933-2016 contributed indirectly through a
paper ?Rare Veda Branches? presented at the 2011 conference by his son Pt.
Chaitanya N. Kale (see several references to this contribution through the
index under Kale), the latter also providing an extensive opening
recitation from the Rg and S?ma veda at the conference together with Pt.
Mukund R. Joshi.
