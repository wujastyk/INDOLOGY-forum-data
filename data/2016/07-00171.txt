[INDOLOGY] Sandhi breaks in longer meters
The adhik?ra s?tra governing sandhi rules is "sa?hit?y?m", "when there is
conjunction".  So when there is not conjunction, no sandhi rule is
triggered.
In the Mah?bh??ya, Pata?jali does have a discussion about how slowly you
can speak and still be considered to be producing a v?kya.  This problem
can be related to the issue of what counts as conjunction.
Best,
Dominik
