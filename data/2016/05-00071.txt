1. The two cases , that of Prof. Deshpande being asked to add S'arma to his
name Madhava during his upanayana samskaara and the name of Venkatavarma
being a totally different name than the name Kuppuswami Sastri seem to be
two different conventions.
2. 'Varma' being in the community-indicating  name-ending of the son of a
Brahmin father is possible in a matrilineal Keralite family system that
prevailed till recently in Kerala, if the mother in that case is from
a Varma ('Kshatriya') lineage.
3. But the case of Sri Kuppuswami Sastri doesn't seem to be even that. Is
'varma' a name ending separated from the part Venkata in this case ? The
concept of 'samskaara name' in this case seems to be intriguingly strange.
