As Churchill long ago pointed out, there is nothing more typically English than the surname 'French'.

?English? is a common enough last name, though in neither case would I expect that the personal name reflects the language per se so much as the ethnic or regional identity (though these are closely linked anyway).  For an unscientific sample of the incidence of the name in the U.S., see:

Dear Rajam, if you are referring to Johnny English, the movie by Rowan Atkinson, the name is a joke. Herman

Dear List Members,

Recently, there was a webmail entry in a Tamil forum about including a language-name in one?s personal name.

There are numerous personal names that include the word ?Tamil? in some form. So, the author of the enquiry was wondering if there would be a similar practice in other languages. I know for sure that "English? is the last of name of some individuals I know.

Further examples and descriptions would be appreciated.

Thanks and regards,
rajam
