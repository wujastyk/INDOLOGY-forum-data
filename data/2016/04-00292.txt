It is not taking a''Shaivite position" to state that Isvara denotes Siva 
in the ancient times and in Patanjali, Kalidasa, etc. in line with the 
Svetasvataropanishad, et al.
I am just stating the actual position. Unlike Samkara who takes a '' 
complete Vaishnavite position" in his commentary as I had shown in 
earlier mail, I am not at all taking any side or ''position''.
