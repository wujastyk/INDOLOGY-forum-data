Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brahmi and Gupta script
Message-ID: <CALNcvFszuDo9EKu+mivmtBQZ8pmuphtxFxob5CyA4eHqBnJtCA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

Is there any evidence for Gupta officials being able to read the Brahmi
(A?okan) script? Having knowledge about A?oka - directly from his Edicts?

Best wishes,

Artur Karp (ret.)
