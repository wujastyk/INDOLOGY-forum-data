[INDOLOGY] Etymology of vetana 'wages'
Are there good reasons for considering the etymology proposed in
Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary as "perhaps a corrupted form of
*vartana*" absolutely untenable?

] *vetana, am,* n. (according to U??di-s.
III. 150. fr. rt. 1. *v?;* perhaps a corrupted form of
*vartana)*
Indo-Aryan is not my area of expertise, but I find *vartana as *found in "
*Vartana-d?na, am,* n. the gift of means of subsistence or wages. *?
Vartana-viniyoga, as,* m. appointment or assignment of means of
subsistence, i. e. of salary, wages, &c. *? Vartan?bh?va (?na-abh?), as,* m.
want of means of subsistence, destitution." is semantically similar to *vetana
*as in "*Vetana-d?na, **am,* n. the paying of wages, hiring. *?
Vetan?d?na **(?na-ad?),
am,* n. non-payment of wages."
Aren't there other examples of a > i/e in the environment of consonant
clusters in Old/Middle Indo-Aryan? Isn't it common for *vr?tti *to
become *vitti
*in Prakrits?

Suresh.
