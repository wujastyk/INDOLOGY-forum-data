[INDOLOGY] A tool to fiddle with Ashtadhyayi
Dear Sir,
I tried to use your system and have one clarification to seek.
With your drop down options I selected ?? and ???????
and ???? and asked the system to generate the forms. First I
wanted to see the correct form being generated. Then I wanted to check the
"tool by which a student can visualize what effect would occur if a
particular sUtra didn't exist in Panini's grammar." So I did not mention
the sutra which the system should consider non-existent in Panini's
grammar.
When I clicked with the input mentioned above and was going through the
steps of derivation, I found some steps (quoted below) which generate a
different  form than one would otherwise expect. I mean 8.2.39 does not
get applied where your system applies it.
"1 - ??+???????+?+??
By jhal?? ja?o'nte (8.2.39) :
???? ???????? (?.?.??) :
1 - ??+???????+?+??
Final forms are :
????? ??? ??? :
1 - ?? ???????? ?? "
I request you to check why this happens and please let me know.
with regards.
Malhar Kulkarni.
