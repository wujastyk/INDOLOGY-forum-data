Dear List,
is there a way in Roman script for distinguishing in a compound the result of -a? + vowel other than a which could be i  =  a i, with hiatus, from the diphthong ai resulting from a/? + e/ai ?
ex. mana? + indriya- = manaindrya- (?) beside m?nasa + aindriya = m?nasaindriya
In n?gar? script I find written mana indrya- with a space put between the two members, but it would look strange in Roman script. 
Any suggestion welcome.
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
