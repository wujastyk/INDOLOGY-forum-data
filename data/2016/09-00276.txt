Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indologist at Center of Sexual Harassment Mess at Berkeley
Message-ID: <CAKq175ogum_F976swt+w2KWquueZBA-3ip5YJU=jUfr3QMfjFw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

List members may be interested in an ongoing sexual harassment scandal at
UC Berkeley involving an Indologist, Blake Wentworth.

Wentworth, who works on classical Tamil literature, was found guilty of
sexual harassment and misconduct last year by the university, and three of
his victims came forward with details of the case (here
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/10/uc-berkeley-students-professor-sexual-harassment-complaint>
and here
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/uc-berkeley-sexual-harassment-scandal-blake-wentworth>)
after being frustrated with delays in firing Wentworth.

Now Wentworth is trying to silence the women he harassed with a defamation
lawsuit (here
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/uc-berkeley-sexual-harassment-blake-wentworth-sues-victims>
).

As many of you know, sexual harassment is an ongoing issue in many
disciplines, and our corner of the academy, it seems, is no exception.
