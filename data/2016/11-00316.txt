The link given on the SARIT page  is to the Wikipedia IAST page .  This
wikipedia  IAST page lists the differences between ISO 15919 and IAST but
it has major errors.  It says ISO 15919 uses e and o with macron over it
where IAST uses e and o.  This is incorrect.  ISO 15919 agrees with IAST in
usage of e and o in transliterating devanagari.

Note the ISO 15919 wikipedia also has this error.  It says to use e and o
with macron where the actual ISO document says to use e and o without
macron.

I've checked the actual ISO 15919 document.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
