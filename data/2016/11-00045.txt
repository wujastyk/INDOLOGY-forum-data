part. From the insider's point of view , Vaidika is Veda- aviruddha,
Veda-anuroopa, Veda-anusaari etc. not necessarily Vedochcharita/Vedas'ruta.
It probably would be an interesting study to survey how far the pull for
such cults among people is based on their claims to be Vedic.
For something which is already 'Hindu' , the claim of Vedic, I guess, does
not add any new value.
For that matter , it is intriguing to see that pamphlets are distributed in
India, (at least here in the Telugu region) claiming that Jesus is in the
Vedas. 'Mohammed in the Vedas' is also one of the internet-popular themes.
It is interesting to study the motives behind such claims.
