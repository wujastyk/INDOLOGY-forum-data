[INDOLOGY] Ivy Racism
It is better to read reports in a reliable news source which actually
states what happened. The newsgram site has no information about its editorial
board <http://www.newsgram.com/about-newsgram/>, the news article linked
below has no author name (posted by Admin), and the headline refers to a
certain "Bown University" (so much for a site that is ?highly competitive
and professional in all its operations? and has ?a professional team of
editors?) and makes claims which I doubt are true.
The DNA (a reliable news source) published a report
http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-us-university-students-protest-hindu-chants-by-white-woman-2206185
which is probably more reliable.
