The M?m??s? texts referred to by Andrew are all very late texts.  Not to
discount the value of these late texts, it would be best to look at the
early sources of M?m??s?, namely the S?tras of Jaimini and ?abara's Bh??ya,
with commentaries by Kum?rila and Prabh?kara.  The best source may be
Ganganath Jha's book: P?rvam?m??s? in its Sources.  Best,
