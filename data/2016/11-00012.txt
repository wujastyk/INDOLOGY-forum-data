Dear Prof. Paturi and other colleagues,

I wonder whether the worshippers' rolling on the ground during South Indian processions may be related to the rite we are discussing or not (see first photo):

The act of rotating while standing I have observed many times in Tamil Nadu, when it appeared to me as a substitute for a 'real' pradak?i?? around a deity, which the worshipper was not able to perform at that particular time. Does this come under ?tmapradak?i?? namask?ra / k?am?y?can??

Best, 
Corinna Wessels-Mevissen

Did you see the video? 
It is called aatmapradakshiNa namaskaara 
> How does one rotate around oneself?
---- Just for fun, let me say, just as the earth rotates around its own axis.

Following the advice of Prof. Dominik Vujastyk sometime ago. I wanted to take my typos easy. But at some places this time they seemed to be horrible. So let me resend it with corrections highlighted. :

What Prof. Patrick J Olivelle was asking for was a textual reference. If it is the question of the details of the actual ritual, its altogether?a?different big story. ?1. Touching the ears is not just a ritual?as part of worship of a deity. It is a gesture as part of daily?speech adopted into the ritual. In north India, it is a common practice even today to pull one's own ear with one's own hand infinitesimally slightly down to indicate 'I apologise'. This has many complex nuances including those of expressions in romance in which case the gesture is made along with a mischievous smile. ?2. This gesture has a variation of criss-crossing the hands to hold the lower tip of the ear of the? left ear with the right hand and vice versa. This is similar to the criss-crossing of?hands by a Vaidika male for self introduction with gotra etc. But the semiotics here is that of obedience rather than that of ?asking for forgiveness. The gesture too is little different . In the self introduction, the ear is closed with the back of the palms ,with the tips of the fingers facing upwards. ?3. In south India, the variation of criss-crossing the hands to hold the lower tip of the ear of the????left ear with the right hand and vice versa?is part of the ritual of??considered to be typical of Ganesha worship and is performed even during the briefest of Darshan of Ganesha. But here, this gesture is essentially part of sit-stand series expressing asking for forgiveness.??4. In any case, touching the ground is not part of these gestures or rituals employing them.??5. What probably is being viewed as touching the ground is sAshTAnga namaskAra which is an expression of surrender rather than asking for forgiveness. These two rituals are different from each other.??6. To show that surrender ritual and ritual for asking for forgiveness are different, I am providing this link?to a general popular description of a Devi-worship ritual:??which has?

7. The gesture of pulling the lower tip of the ear with or without criss-crossed hands has its origin in the mild punishment method of pinching the ear.
