[INDOLOGY] New article on Sanskrit
Yes exactly, thanks Professor Kapstein -- the article is about Sanskrit --
and I would welcome queries or responses based on what's in the article,
rather than leading questions that tend in the direction of
thinly-disguised apologetics for the ruling party.
Ananya Vajpeyi.
