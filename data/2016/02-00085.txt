=?utf-8?Q?Lines_of_appreciation_of_=C5=9Aakuntal=C4=81?=
Dear Colleagues,
Can anyone recall the ?loka that lionises the fourth act of the ?akuntal?? 
I mean the one that praises four verses in the fourth act etc. etc.
I would like to know the exact Sanskrit of the ?loka and its source.
Thanks in Anticipation,
