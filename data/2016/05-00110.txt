One can make a case to the effect that the composition of ?gveda 10.129, the N?sad?ya-s?kta, must have been an event that influenced the development of Indian civilization in the spheres of thought, religion, social relations, etc. I do not understand why such an event  must be something ?that happened accidentally, by pure chance?. However, I would not mind if the N?sad?ya is thought of as meeting that condition, since all great poetic-philosophic compositions are indeed outcomes of accidents that take place in the mind ? are not explicable as purely linear movements or logical developments; the poets have to see something that others have not derived ? that transcend the mere sum of parts. 
Without the N?sad?ya (and possibly a few other compositions resembling it), the phenomenon of religions that almost entirely subsume heresy and a mind-boggling diversity of divinities ? religions that almost never clash with atheism or secularism ? would not have taken place in India. (I recall reading ?secular religion?, which might seem a contradiction in terms, as a description of Hinduism in one of Louis Renou?s publications.)

I am not sure about how yad?cch? and akasm?t can be reconciled with ?legitimate?. I will assume that ?legitimate? is intended here in some such sense as ?entertainable, considered worthy of taking up for discussion as a possibility when such other causes as God or atoms are taken up for discussion.? 
The ?vet??vatara Upani?ad avails itself of the possibility in its verse 1.2: k?la? sva-bh?vo niyatir yad?cch? ?
