Subject: [INDOLOGY] Query re: guru-ziSya and paramparA
Message-ID: <CE512CD3-0423-4A06-935D-A61CC4A9FBE1@oneonta.edu>

Hi all,

I received the below question via email. I don't have a handy reference?can anyone help?

Best,
Toke

I had a query about the correct usage of the term(s) "guru?shishya" and "parampara". I think what they indicate is the succession of teacher and pupil in a Vedic intellectual tradition, passing on knowledge and practice. But my only "reference" for this is a vague memory plus, um, wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru%E2%80%93shishya_tradition), and I'd rather not refer to those, ah, sources. What is the correct translation / explanation, and do you know a good citation or two I can have?
