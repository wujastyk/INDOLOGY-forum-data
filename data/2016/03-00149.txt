[INDOLOGY] pandits as donkeys
Dear Ram-Prasad ji,
This comparison of pundits just carrying sacred texts without knowing their meaning/value is attested in a very old floating verse cited already in the Su?ruta Sa?hit?. While teaching in Kathmandu we had a student who memorized everything without caring for the meaning, and we used to call him Mr. Candanabharav?hin. He was happy with his nickname and had memorized this verse, too. Of course, without caring what it meant. Here is the SS passage:
1.4.3 adhigatamapyadhyayanamaprabh??itamarthata? kharasya candanabh?ra iva kevala? pari?ramakara? bhavati ||
1.4.4 bhavati c?tra |
1.4.4ab yath? khara?candanabh?rav?h? bh?rasya vett? na tu candanasya |
1.4.4cd eva? hi ??str??i ba??nyadh?tya c?rthe?u m??h?? kharavadvahanti ||
