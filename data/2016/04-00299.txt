Dear Ganesan,
My point was not to dispute that identification, but that from Siva=Isvara
in Svetasvatara and Kalidasa it does not follow that Isvara=Siva in
Patanjali, because the term has been variously associated (there is no
avyabhicara between the two). Again, Jan Gonda's essay on the idea of
Isvara is a most worthwhile reading,
Yours
Aleksandar
