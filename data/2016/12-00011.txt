PDF of Peterson Report Part 1
Dear all,
may I ask if anybody has a pdf of the "Detailed report of operations
in search of Sanskrit manuscripts in the Bombay Circle" Part 1?
Published as an extra number of the Journal of the Bombay Branch of
the Royal Asiatic Society 1883 16/4 (Biswas Catalogue p. 229-230, but
http://wujastyk.net/mscats/Sanskrit_Catalogues/Biswas%200857%20Poona%20-%20Petersons%20reports/
has only parts 2, 3 and 5.)
I believe that https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008400562 is the
item, but it is not accesible to me apart from a minimal search (which
was positive).
Thanks,
Peter
