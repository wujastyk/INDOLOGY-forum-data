Good writings on the body, including the cakras, can be found in

   - Bouillier, V?. & Tarabout, G. *(Eds.) Images du corps dans le monde
   hindou **CNRS ?ditions, **2002*
   - Michaels, A. & Wulf, C. *(Eds.) The Body in India: Ritual,
   Transgression, Performativity. *Akademie Verlag, *2009*, 18

On one of the earliest Sanskrit descriptions of cakras, see

   - Heilijgers-Seelen, D. *The System of Five *Cakra*s in
   Kubjik?matatantra 14--16. *Egbert Forsten, *1994*

The tantra specialists will offer more precision, but the *Kubjikamata* and
similar-period texts (*M?lin?vijayottara*) are among the earliest mentions
of the cakra system as we know it.   The dates are as Matthew said, end of
the first millennium CE.

Yoga-Patanjali mentions the n?bhi cakra in his *P?ta?jalayoga??stra *(SARIT
<http://sarit.indology.info/exist/apps/sarit/works/search.html?query=cakr%5Ba%7Ce%5D&field=text&query-scripts=all&index=ngram&lucene-query-mode=any&tei-target=tei-text&work-authors=all&query-scope=narrow&bool=new&target-texts=sarit__p%C4%81ta%C3%B1jalayoga%C5%9B%C4%81stra>),
but to me this seems more related to medical models of the body, where
sir?s and dhaman?s converge on the n?bhi, than to much later multi-cakra
models of pr??a and visualization that are developed in tantra.

Best,
Dominik
