[INDOLOGY] bhakti
Nagaraj,
You are generalizing.
I simply point out the fact that invoking the Vedas or Vedic knowledge 
to boost one's own tradition is commonplace in Indian religious 
traditions. Yes, each case can be studied in its own cultural context 
and so on, but that doesn't change the fact. In some cases, it may 
almost a cliche, but it is prevalent. The sectarian competition is clear 
in the literature. It can be a different matter for the everyday 
believer, who doesn't need to be bothered with theological distinctions.
For the /Bhagavad G?t?/ the Supreme god is Kr???a, for the/??vara G?t?/ 
it is ?iva, for the /Dev? Bh?gavata Pur???/ it is Dev?. Likewise, 
different texts say that their preferred divinity*is* the Vedas, or 
brahman, or some variant of that idea. And Puranic stories often tell of 
how a certain god couldn't accomplish a certain job and had to ask for 
help from another one who, therefore, is portrayed as the highest.
Regards,
Luis
