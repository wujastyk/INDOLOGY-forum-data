Dear all who kindly replied to my question,
Many thanks for your good contributions in elucidating what I asked about.
Your replies are much appreciated. For now, I will add just one more thing.
Although I have not critically studied the *R?m?ya?a*, I have the
impression that those who have critically studied it regard the first k???a
as being a later part of this epic. This agrees with what some of you have
said here. V?lm?ki?s first ?loka, however, is being quoted in this k???a,
to explain how the ?loka meter arose. It is not part of this k???a's narrative
as such. So its language is not necessarily the language of the rest of
this k???a, and its age would be independent of the age of this k???a.
Best regards,
