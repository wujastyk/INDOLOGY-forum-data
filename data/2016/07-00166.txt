Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sandhi breaks in longer meters

Yes, Jonathan, the external sandhi is optional according to grammarians,
and yet the convention of metrical Sanskrit is that the sandhis are pretty
much obligatory.  The break in Sandhi comes after the half-verse or
ardha-?c in Vedic verses.  Only rarely is there a sandhi break within a
metrical line.  On the other hand, there are hyper or double sandhis
occasionally in older metrical texts, e.g. sa? + e?a? > sa e?a?, but
metrically occasionally one notices sai?a, and P??ini allows such double
sandhis for filling the metrical space (so'ci lope cet p?dap?ra?am).
Breaking the sandhis in metrical lines is done as part of interpretation,
but not as part of recitation, since with broken sandhis, the metrical
lines are no longer complaint with rules of a specific meter.
