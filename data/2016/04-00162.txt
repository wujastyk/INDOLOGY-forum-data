[INDOLOGY] new publication
welll... In this volume I dealt only with the Sanskrit and Tibetan, no
Chinese, and no treatment of the commentaries. Whether I have the courage
to deal with the former time will tell, but it will take a team of
specialists to deal with the commentaries, which are, predictably I would
say, rather more complicated, doctrinally, than Vasubandhu's m?la.
I didn't try to order the book, but copies were sent to me, which,
empiricist that I am, convinces me that they exist :)
best, jonathan
