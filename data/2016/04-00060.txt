[INDOLOGY] Misunderstood origins
Dear Tim,
Could you, please, upload your review to Academia.edu? A poorly-educated
guy like me (no irony here!) needs further reading and learning. And
appreciates any occasion for it.
Thanks in advance,
Artur
PS. I try to organize my thoughts re the relics of the Buddha and amrita.
Some simple parallels - and a sticky ground, contradictory concepts and
interpretations. In need of new - lodestar-like - ideas.
