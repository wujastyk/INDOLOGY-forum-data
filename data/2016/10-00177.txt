[INDOLOGY] Monier Williams Online
Dear Colleagues,
I am sorry, but the link Fran?ois Patte sent me earlier this day (and which
I forwarded too quickly the list) does not lead to the revised edition of
1899, but to the unrevised ed. of 1877. The latest version of the 1899 ed.
is still out of order, whereas the earlier version of the 1899 ed., which
according to the information provided on the home page (
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/) is depricated, works
apparently fine.
