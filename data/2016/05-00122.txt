Dear professor Karp,

Kamakhya - the place where is preserved the *yoni *of the goddess Sati -
could be the earliest "seat of the goddess" (adi-pitha). It shows
archaeological evidences of the fourth-fifth century, even if the actual
temple is a new structure, rebuilt in the middle of sixteenth century and
reworked during the Ahom invasion of Assam.
However, because of the earthquake and flood in Assam it is difficult to
confirm this date with massive archaeological proofs.
Another thing to bring in mind is that we are not sure about when the place
became an Hindu religious sanctuary and if there was another non-Hindu
temple on the hill.

Best,
Paolo
