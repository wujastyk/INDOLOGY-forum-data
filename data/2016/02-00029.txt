[INDOLOGY] Publication of Two Translations of German Literature into Bengali Language!
indology at list.indology.info
Dear List Members,
This is to inform all the List Members that my following two Bengali translations have been published this year in 2016 at the Kolkata Book Fair. Since the Bengali Language and its literature including translation of twentieth-century European works into Bengali is likely to fall under the periphery of Indology in an unique way, I think it would be of interest to members to know how contemporary Bengali literature is expanding through translations.
1. Tin Drum (G?nter Gras, Die Blechtrommel, 1959), 2015, Translated from German into Bengali, Rupali Publications, Kolkata, Translated by Debabrata Chakrabarti;
2. Duino Elijiguli (Rainer Maria Rilke, Duineser Elegien, 1922), 2015, Translated from German into Bengali, Winternitz Books, Kolkata, Translated by Debabrata Chakrabarti.
Please see the covers from the above attachments.
