[INDOLOGY] Diacriticals in unicode, single or multiple glyphs
Dear list members,
The Sanskrit Library transcoding facility on line at
http://sanskritlibrary.org/transcodeText.html does indeed transcode to
Romanization using the preferred Unicode composites of characters plus
diacritics.  Our off-line transcoding software
   - TranscodeFile (Java program)
   <http://sanskritlibrary.org/software/transcodeFile.html>
 which is downloadable from http://sanskritlibrary.org/downloads.html has a
large array of transcoders one of which transcodes to Romanization using
precomposed Unicode characters that include diacritics.  The problem with
searching that Harry Spier mentions is just one of a number of reasons why
Malcolm Hyman and I designed the Sanskrit Library phonetic encoding for all
our linguistic programming, including both the encoding of texts and
searching, and use Unicode only for display, and data input if desired
(though for the latter purpose SLP and most other meta-encodings are
preferable).  Our book *Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit* available
at http://sanskritlibrary.org/publications.html discusses the issues
comprehensively.
Yours,
Peter
