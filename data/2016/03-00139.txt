[INDOLOGY] pdf request
Dear Colleagues
I find on archive.org vols 1-3 of The Hymns of The Rigveda
by Griffith, Ralph T. H. (Ralph Thomas Hotchkin), 1826-1906, ed. and tr
vol 4 doesn't appear to be there;  might someone have a pdf or be able to
point me to a link for it?
(vol 3 concludes with Book 9, Hymn No. 60).
Cheers
