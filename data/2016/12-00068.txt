[INDOLOGY] Does chandrabindu occur in Hindi
Dear Harry,
Yes, it does. Hindi vowels can be, and are very often, nasalised. 
Nasality is shown by the sign candrabindu (?). However, when there is a 
vowel sign above the top line, only the dot wil be written. 
Transliteration: tilde, sometimes an m with under- or overdot.
???, ??? ??? ? Yes, I am.
