[INDOLOGY] Indologist at Center of Sexual Harassment Mess at Berkeley
Sexual harassment deeply affects scholarship, and it is a problem in Indology. 
All three women harassed by Wentworth have publicly expressed that these events have negatively impacted their studies. One has discontinued her studies. So, these events are shaping the scholarship that we all read and share on this list by driving away future colleagues.
Sexual harassment is a significant problem in our discipline, my friends. It's not just a general problem in the academy and the world -- it is our problem. I would encourage the men, and they are all men, who cannot handle this thread to halt the avoidance tactics and instead focus on what they can do to tackle this substantial problem.
