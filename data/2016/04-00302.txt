With many thanks to Andrew, it really should not be overlooked, among the
other fascinating looking contributions, that there is a short appreciation
of Fernando Tola, a scholar who because of the circumstances of his career
has been much less part of the mainstream than he should have been. i think
that even without Spanish (mine is basically restricted to knowing how to
order a beer) one can still understand enough of the survey to appreciate
Tola as a scholar. I have the good fortune to know him and Carmen Dagonetti
personally, and you could not hope to meet two more lovely human beings.
So, even not able to read Spanish, you might think of giving the few pages
a look.
