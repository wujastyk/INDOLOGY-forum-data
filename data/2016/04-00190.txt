[INDOLOGY] From the Mahabharata
I don't think it does. The desiderative (sannanta) is not the same as
intensive (ya?anta). Is it possible you have the intensive in mind?
bubhuk?? = bhuj + san + a + ??p
san is by dh?to? karma?a? sam?nakart?k?dicch?y?? v? (A 3.1.7)
a is by a pratyay?t (A 3.3.102)
??p is by aj?dyata???p (A 4.1.4)
There is no sense of intense desire or craving in the suffix san as far as
I know (neither in a or ??p). In itself, the word bubhuk?? simply means a
desire to eat or hunger, both literally and in common usage as attested to
in the Amarako?a (a?an?y? bubhuk?? k?ut) and also in the Dh?tup??ha (k?udh
bubhuk??y?m).
As far as the interpretation of bubhuk?? in the MBh verses is concerned,
the commentary by N?laka??ha may be referred to.
