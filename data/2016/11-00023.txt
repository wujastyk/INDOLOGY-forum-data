[INDOLOGY] First female sovereign
If we are including regents, then, we must include the Satavahana queen
Naganika, wife of Satakarni (180-170 BCE? or early CE?), who acted as
regent and carried on the administration after the death of her husband,
because their son Vedasri was a minor (based on Naneghat inscription).
