[INDOLOGY] Indology and Tibetology to close at the University	of Copenhagen
Thank you. The fields of Modern India, and Indian Languages and Culture are to be maintained and reopened in 2017. I wonder to what extent these two areas will cover ancient and pre-modern Indian history and languages.
Best,
Howard
