[INDOLOGY] FYI: Spoken Sanskrit blog entry plus discussion at "Language Log"
Dear Patrick,
thanks a lot for this very interesting account.
It helps building a precise mental linguistic global landscape,
concerning which the EARLIER blog by Victor Mair
("http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=14027"
/Sanskrit resurgent/, dated August 2014)
also provided one with a wealth of information,
further enriched by a multiplicity of insights
concerning "Literary Sinitic (Classical Chinese)".
As far as I am concerned,
it also helps me in clarifying my ideas
concerning what I nowadays tend to call the "Tamil TRIGLOSSIA"
(i.e. the Tamil diglossia, haunted by Classical Tamil)
My mother tongue being French,
you might of course need to normalize
(into ??stric English ...)
some of the tentative statements made by me ;-)
I believe I know what I am try to say, although my success is dependent 
on my grasp of the linguistic vehicle of the current Zeitgeist :-)
I tend to think that we live in interesting times,
being able to combine real travel opportunities (for instance to 
Shillong and other places) and virtual travel opportunities (for 
instance thanks to YouTube ...).
Best wishes for 2016
