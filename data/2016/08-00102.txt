P.S. re Tilakasv?min ? the name Tilake?vara is also attested, though not common.  It seems NOT, however, be connectable with Tilakasv?min:

There is a Pandya Tilake?vara temple at Dev?pa??a?am near R?me?varam with an inscription; the deity is ?iva (with Saundaryan?yak?).

There is a Tilake?vara temple erected by king Karm?ditya in L.S. 213 = 1332 A.D.

Tilake?vara is a t?rtha mentioned in the Rev?kha??a of the V?yu Pur??a (230.56).

There is a Tilakeshwar temple in Gujarat, but it is a ?iva temple so named because it stands in Tilakwada ? or is it the other way around?

The Kurud copperplate grant of Narendra in MP (6th c.) was issued from the king?s camp at Tilake?vara.  Nothing more seems to be known about the place.

Gifts of slaves and farmland by an official named Kum?rasvamin to Tilake?vara are recorded in the Cambodian stele inscription K. 664 (sometime between the 6th c. and 8th c.).  I don?t think the temple is identifiable.

So not much help here.

Best,

Tim

V?caspati?s Bh?mat? on Brahmas?tra begins with some ma?galam  verses, one of which reads:

m?rta??a-tilakasv?mi-mah?ga?apat?n vayam  I
vi?vavandy?nnamasy?ma? sarvasiddhividh?yina?  || 4

This parallels Vij??ne?vara?s "?ditya-skanda-ga?apat?n?m?

Govind?nanda's Ratnaprabh?vy?khy? on BrS 3.3.1 is similarly introduced:

m?rta??a? dhv?ntan???ya tilakasv?mina? mude |
vighne?a? vighnavidhvastyai pra?am?mi muhurmuhu? ||

Yours,

In the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti (1.290 ? but 1.294 in Vij??ne?vara?s enumeration and 1.292 in Apar?rka?s) we have the verse:


?dityasya sad? p?j?? tilakasv?minas tath? |

mah?ga?apate? caiva kurvan siddhim av?pnuy?t ||

My critical edition has the reading ?tilakasv?minas? following the Malayalam mss. and Vi?var?pa?s commentary. Vij??ne?vara and Apar?rka (as also all the Vulgate manuscripts) read ?tilaka? sv?minas?. Vij?? explains tilakam as: ?dityaskandaga?apat?n?m anyatamasya sarve??? v? tilaka? svar?anirmita? r?pyanirmita? v? kurgan. So he takes ?tilaka? as a forehead mark (ornament) made out of gold or silver and, probably, attached to a statue of one of these gods.

If, however, Vi?var?pa is correct, and the verb kurvan has a single object ?p?j?m?, then we have the compound ?tilakasv?minas?, which nicely parallels ?mah?ga?apate??.

My query is, has anyone seen the epithet ?tilakasv?min? applied to Skandia. I?d be much obliged for any comments on this.

With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick
