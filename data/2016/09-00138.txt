[INDOLOGY] Double sandhi
Hi Martin,
One such passage that comes to mind is Bhagavadg?t? 11.44: priy?y?rhasi
You can look at Oberlies, *A Grammar of Epic Sanskrit, *which has a whole
section on this phenomenon (pp. 34-49).
P??ini's separation of the trip?d? is important in formulating his rules to
avoid double sandhi, so you may also want to look into that side of things
(although I can't point you to specific scholarship off  the top of my
head).
A typical commentarial response is to claim '?r?a' usage. Baladeva
Vidy?bh??a?a, for example, writes on BhG 11.44: priy?y?rhas?ti visargalopa?
sandhi?c?r?a?.
Best,
David
