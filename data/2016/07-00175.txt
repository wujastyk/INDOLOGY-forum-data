[INDOLOGY] reviews of Malhotra's books
Dear Colleagues,
I would point out that Rajiv Malhotra is a known, unapologetic plagiarist.
He regularly makes ad hominem attacks. He has endorsed stories written in
The Onion, a satirical newspaper. I'm not sure that I see much here with
which to engage on an academic level.
