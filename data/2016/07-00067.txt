[INDOLOGY] Bibliographical help for illuminated Nepalese manuscripts
Dear Colleagues,
a friend and colleague of mine, Daniele Cuneo, is currently finishing up 
an article on an illuminated Nepalese manuscript preserved in the 
Cambridge collections and recently digitised by the Sanskrit manuscript 
project (see http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00864/1). As he is no 
art historian, he is afraid he might have overlooked some relevant 
publication on that particular manuscript or some other related 
illuminated Nepalese manuscripts. He would be very grateful for any 
suggestion or pointer to useful materials.
All the best,
Camillo A. Formigatti
