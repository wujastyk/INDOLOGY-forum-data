Subject: [INDOLOGY] Request for help to identify deity
Message-ID: <401f43b07408887eaf7100372b32ee68@fabularasa.dk>

Dear all,

I need help identifying the intended deity in the center of the attached 
top panel from a gy?n caupa? (Snakes & Ladders) chart. The spot is 
usually reserved for Vi??u/K???a (Vaiku??ha is in sq. 68 below), but I 
wonder if here it might be a second ?iva, his son K?rttikeya, or someone 
else entirely.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Kind regards,
Jacob
