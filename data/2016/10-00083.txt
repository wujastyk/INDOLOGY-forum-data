[INDOLOGY] Information sought regarding Telugu "Saccra" (cakra)
Speaking of chakras and letters, on pp 705-707 of Grierson's article on the
Sharada script https://archive.org/details/244194891OnTheSharadaA
lphabetJournalOfTheRoyalAsiaticSociety171916SirGeorgeGriersonKCIEMRAS
is an explanation of the metaphysics of the alphabet. Unfortunately, there
is only a discussion of the vowels and not the consonants, etc. It seems
that the file on archive is not complete. Even though the title page says
the last page is 708, it does seem to have an abrupt ending.
But
On p 705 the following book is mentioned http://www.worldcat.
org/title/shiva-sutra-vimarsini-of-ksemaraja/oclc/21777974 - I'm guessing
this is the possible source for Grierson's discussion on the alphabet.
Unfortunately, the closest copy to me is about 5000 miles away. Archive.org
has two other books by the author, Iyengar,  but not this one.
https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22
Srinivasa+Iyengar%2C+P.+T.%2C+1863-1931%22
 Might you have a .pdf copy of this book?
The Shiva-sutra-vimarsini? of Ksemaraja (1912) by Iyengar
 I'd appreciate it if anyone might be able to help me find similar
discussions/information on the rest of the alphabet? If they are mentioned
in Ksemaraja's work, does anyone know exactly where? I had a quick look in
the ?aktop?ya section.
All the best,
