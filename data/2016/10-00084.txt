[INDOLOGY] Information sought regarding Telugu "Saccra" (cakra)
Dear Jacob,
I forgot to answer your Chakra vs Yantra question.
Sri Chakra is the same as Sri Yantra.
All such chakras are yantras. But not all yantras are chakras. Yantra is
the generic term and the most frequently used term. Yantra is part of the
three component system mantra-yantra-tantra.
Aagamas are the books that deal with the procedures of installations at
temples. There are quite a few western Indologists who studied these books.
I attended a paper presentation on the topic at SALC department, University
of Chicago.
By the way, the script used in the yantra under question has glyph features
of an older style of Telugu writing, not 100 years as assumed by the museum
people.
