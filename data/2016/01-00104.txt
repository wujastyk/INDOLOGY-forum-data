I have confirmed in a personal correspondence with Karen Thomson that she did not choose for her article the title ?Speak for Itself?. The editors extracted it from her quotation of Roth in the article:

"As Rudolph Roth wrote over a century ago, 'A translation must speak for itself. As a rule, it only requires a commentary where it is not directly convincing, and where the translator does not feel secure?.?

The context of this quotation, within the article, is an argument for ?decipherment? of, over ?commentary? on, the RV.
