[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  aja as ajaya?
Forgot to send it to Indology list.
Re: [INDOLOGY] aja as ajaya?
Hello David,
     I don't know any Tibetan, but the Sanskrit lines "samudravijayo 'ja? |
kalk? dv?da?ama? s?ryo" that you have quoted make me think that the first
part of your quotation is metrically deficient.  It has only seven
syllables, in stead of the required eight syllables for a quarter of an
Anu??ubh verse.  To make this line metrically regular with eight syllables,
the probable correction would read: samudravijayo 'jaya?", giving you the
reading "ajaya".  This original was probably corrupted to "samudravijayo '
ja?".  Just a suggestion.
