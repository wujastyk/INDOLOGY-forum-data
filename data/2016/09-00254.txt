 Referring to your 3rd point in your earlier mail,where you have stated something like this- ' 'Not all bhakti schools were opposed to Rituals..... even the VishishtaAdvaitya school were opposed to the Adwaitya ..etc. ' I would like to add that even  Adwaityists were not always opposed to Rituals  and worshipping the Shaguna Brahmana.   A staunch Adwaityist like Madhusuadan Saraswati ,in his book 'ADWAITYA-SIDDHI' describes the  pristine beauty of a Lord Krishna idol in the following lines -...



        PitamvaraDaranaBimbaAdharOshtat PurnenduSundaraMukhad Arabinda Netrat krishnat parat kimApi tatwam Aham Na Jane.'



                         Examples can also be cited from the compositions of Shankara where he describes the lrd Krishn'a existence as 'satyam Gyanam Anantam Nitya' as well as 'Goshtha PranganaNiranganaLola Alayasam etc.....
