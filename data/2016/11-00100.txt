Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Devanagari font: Shobhika

Dear Colleagues,

I'm passing on this announcement from my collaborators at IITBombay who have just released a beautiful new Devanagari font called Shobhika.  The font has been carefully and mindfully executed by a team of Sanskrit, IT,  and visual design specialists, and the attention to detail that has gone into all aspects of the process produces a very pleasing end result (I attach a screen shot for a quick view of the font).

Please find below the link to the public Github repository of the free, open source font. The instructions to download v1.0 of the font are given under the 'Downloading the font' section in the link below:

https://github.com/Sandhi-IITBombay/Shobhika

I quote from their preamble:

"Shobhika is a free, open source, Unicode compliant, OpenType font with support for Devan?gar?, Latin, and Cyrillic scripts. It is available in two weights?regular and bold. The font is designed with over 1600 Devan?gar? glyphs, including support for over 1100 conjunct consonants, as well as vedic accents. The Latin component of the font not only supports a wide range of characters required for Roman transliteration of Sanskrit, but also provides a subset of regularly used mathematical symbols for scholars working with scientific and technical documents. The project has been launched under the auspices of the Science and Heritage Initiative (SandHI) at IIT Bombay<https://github.com/Sandhi-IITBombay/Shobhika/blob/master/www.iitb.ac.in>, and builds upon the following two fonts for its Devan?gar? and Latin components respectively: (i) Yashomudra<https://github.com/RajyaMarathiVikasSanstha/Yashomudra> by R?jya Mar??h? Vik?s Sa?sth?<https://rmvs.maharashtra.gov.in/>, and (ii) PT Serif<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif> by ParaType<http://www.paratype.com/>. We would like to thank both these organisations for releasing their fonts under the SIL Open Font Licence, which has enabled us to create Shobhika. "

The creators of the font also request any feedback that you have so that it may be further improved.

With best wishes,
Clemency
