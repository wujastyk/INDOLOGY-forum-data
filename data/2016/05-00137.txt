[INDOLOGY] Eras and Dates
Dear Donald,
The second scheme refers to the regnal year of the king (whether he issued
the inscription or it was issued in his realm).
I was precisely looking at a 5th-century Pallava copper-plate inscription
when I read your email:
si?havarmma-m?h?r?jasya [sic] vijayasa?vatsare ek?da?e pau?yam?se
k???apak?e da?amy?m may? datt? t??pra [sic] pa??ik?.
With best wishes

include a date given in two ways:
sa?vatsarar?pe?a ca k?lena
date "according to Sa?vatsara" is not. A little digging suggested that it
might refer to the Vikrama era or, more likely it seemed, to one of the
cyclical years of the 60-year B?rhaspatya sa?vatsara of Jupiter (per Sewell
and Dikshit?s Indian Calendar).
