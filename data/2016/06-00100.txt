[INDOLOGY] Numbers --- # 2
Dear List,
*51*
According to tradition there are 51 ?akti-pithas; 51 sanctuaries devoted to
(propagating the cult of) a particular member of the Devi's body.
Is there somewhere in the Hindu tradition a mention of the idea of *human
body* numbering 51 elements?
Why 51? And not, for example - 60?
Thanking you in advance,
