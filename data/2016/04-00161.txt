[INDOLOGY] new publication
Dear Jonathan,
Many thanks for letting us know about this important publication. I did not
even know that it was coming. We have long needed a critical edition of
this text. Amazon is also still showing August for publication date. But
you are saying that it is now out and can now be obtained from Harvard
University Press. Great!
Does the "(I)" after the title mean that you are preparing a second volume?
If so, what will it contain? Thanks.
Best regards,
David Reigle
