[INDOLOGY] use of the title "deva" (Malwa, beg. 13th c.)
Dear List,
was the title "deva" used only with reference to someone who has already
been consecrated as king or generally to any (male?) of royal descent?
Arjunavarman I of the Param?ras (Malwa, beg. of the 13th c.) styles himself
"Arjunavarmadeva" in his introduction to his commentary on the Amaru?ataka.
I was wondering if it is legitimate to conclude from that that he was
already on the throne at the time when he composed the ??k?.
Best,
Gaia
