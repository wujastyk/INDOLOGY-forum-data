The newsgram site has no information about its editorial board <http://www.newsgram.com/about-newsgram/>, the news article linked below has no author name (posted by Admin), and the headline refers to a certain "Bown University" (so much for a site that is ?highly competitive and professional in all its operations? and has ?a professional team of editors?) and makes claims which I doubt are true.
