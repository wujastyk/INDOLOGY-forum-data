[INDOLOGY] Kittel's list
Dear Herman,
Your understanding of the Lemuria scenario would converge with the
conclusion of Johannes Goropius Becanus (also known as Jan van Gorp,
1519-1572) according to whom Dutch (Brabantic) was the language spoken in
Paradise because its words are shorter, hence older, than those of Latin,
Greek, Hebrew. Apparently he also succeeded to his own satisfaction and in
support of his thesis to identify and decipher the language of the Egyptian
hieroglyphs as Dutch (bibliographic information but *not* the proposed
sources: anet.ua.ac.be/wiki/hortus/Becanus  / sample pages:
http://www.cubra.nl/brabantslandschap/originesantwerpianaeedschilders.htm).
Best,
Jan
