[INDOLOGY] India and Bharat
Vamsi Juluri is not a ?she' but a ?he?. He is one of the prominent exponents of the Hindutva viewpoint in this country. Just take a look at the endorsers of his book on the back cover of the book ?Rearming Hinduism?. This fight between ?India? and ?South Asia? is a favorite of the Hindutva and especially Rajiv Malhotra. Should the Indology list be involved in this? See his article http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/treasurehunt/it-is-time-to-speak-up-against-the-hinduphobia-of-foreign-writers-vamsee-juluri/ <http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/treasurehunt/it-is-time-to-speak-up-against-the-hinduphobia-of-foreign-writers-vamsee-juluri/>.
On a positive note, I am glad somebody on the Hindutva side acknowledges the existence of regional languages and presumably they are Indian and they have a ?voice? too. The vision plan for Sanskrit said, "Sanskrit, it is acknowledged, is not just a language. It is the voice of India?s soul and wisdom. It is the link between India?s past and present. It has been the vehicle of Knowledge Tradition of Bharat.? [emphasis mine]
