Subject: [INDOLOGY] Touching one's nose with the left index finger

British people tap the side of their nose with their right index finger to indicated that something is a secret ('Hush hush! Don?t pass it on!'). At least, they used to - I have not seen the younger generation do it. (But then they are not so secretive).

What the thread initiator said he was looking for was the specific cultural connotation in the context that he cited, Vi?van?tha Cakravartin's commentary (ca. late 17th century) on the Bh?gavata Pur??a 10.9.7 (utt?rya gop?...).

The reference is ?m?kkin ucci cu??u viral c?rtti (???????? ????? ??????????? ????????). Women talk about the relationship between an unmarried woman and a man, and their gesture is indicated by ?touching the tip of their nose with their index finger.?
