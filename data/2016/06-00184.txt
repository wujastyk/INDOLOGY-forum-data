[INDOLOGY] amsala
With this tip from Steven, I was able to see that M. A. Mehendale's article
on a?sala is included in *Madhu-vidy?: Prof. Madhukar Anant Mehendale
Collected Papers* (Ahmedabad: L. D. Institute of Indology, 2001). It was
reprinted there on pp. 139-142. If no one comes up with a PDF sooner, I can
scan this later today. This book, by the way, is 736 pages, filled with his
valuable articles.
Best regards,
