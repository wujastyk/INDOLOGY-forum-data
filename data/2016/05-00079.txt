[INDOLOGY] the water fowl illusion
Hi all
I came across a reference today in Buston's commentary on the Vimalaprabh?
of the K?lacakratantra to the
chu skyar gyi sgru ma
or
kalaha?sa-m?y?
The referent to a water-fowl/gander/duck/swan/drake-illusion is not
familiar to me.
Mght someone know what this particular illusion is, and have some
references?
Cheers
James
