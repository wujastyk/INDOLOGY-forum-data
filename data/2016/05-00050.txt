[INDOLOGY] Early Representations of OM
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranganathaswamy_Temple,_Srirangam
has the following description.
"The *vimanam
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana_(architectural_feature)>* (shrine
over the sanctum sanctorum), the Ranga *vimana* is shaped like *omkara
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omkara>* (om symbol) and is plated with
gold."
Similar descriptions of Vimana being in Pranava shape is given for many
Tamil Nadu temples.
