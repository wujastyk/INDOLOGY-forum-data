that paper was ""From 'footstep' to 'word' in Sanskrit."
In both papers I suggested that the Vedic rsis, absorbed as they were in
their riddling, esoteric brahmodyas, were highly sensitive to signs of all
sorts [not just footprints but also words] and to the inferences that we
draw from them.   In both papers I conclude that not only were the Vedic
rsis sophisticated proto-linguists [as Frits has argued], but that they
also had a science which I called "Vedic semiotics."
Well, I was more exuberant then than I am now.
Maybe this is of some interest to you all.
Best wishes,
George
