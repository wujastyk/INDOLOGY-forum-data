Apologies to list members for my confused second paragraph. To clarify my
questions --
1. Is there a P??inian way to derive vid??aka from vidv??s, given that
sampras?ra?a gives a short u where we want a long one? I don't think so,
but ...
2. Is there any other way to derive vid??aka from vidv??s -- perhaps
involving some speculative etymologizing?
Many thanks to Professor Cardona for filling out the derivation of vid??aka
from the causative of ?du?. In this prakriy?, the required long ? comes
nicely from 6.4.90, do?o ?au.
Thank you again,
Jo
