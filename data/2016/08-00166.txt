[INDOLOGY] Chaupar/pachisi pieces carrying linga-like objects
Many thanks for the suggestions. I have received what I believe to be a 
strong suggestion from Tillo Detige offline, namely that the object 
might be a pitcher with a coconut (ma?gala-kala?a) often used in Jaina 
ritual.
Any further suggestions or comments are most welcome.
Best,
Jacob
