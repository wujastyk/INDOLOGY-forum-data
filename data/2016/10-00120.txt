[INDOLOGY] Crypto-Hindu and crypto-Buddhist
Dear colleagues,
I recently came across an article on Chinese Buddhism by Ritzinger, where the author repeatedly described Mah?y?na texts such as the Lotus S?tra as ?crypto-Hindu? (!). I have never come across such expression although I am aware of a body of scholarly works which explore how Mah?y?na appropriated non-Buddhist materials of other traditions in the later periods. Stephen Hodge appears to have used the term ?crypto-Hindu? rhetorically in an Indology-list thread in 2000 :

I found online also some discussions of ?a?kara as being ?crypto-Buddhist?. Can anyone enlighten me the contemporary usage of ?crypto-? in South Indian religious discourse, and its historical source.
