[INDOLOGY] satya
Just for additional information, perhaps the oldest etymology for the word
satya was offered by a grammarian named ??ka??yana.  This is referred to by
Y?ska in his Nirukta [1.13, 1.14], where we are told that ??ka??yana
derived parts of a word from other words [padebhya? padetar?rdh?n
sa?cask?ra ??ka??yana?].  ??ka??yana derives the "ya" of satya from the
causative of the root "i" [ete? k?rita? ca yak?r?di? ca antakara?am], while
he derives the "sat" of satya from the root "as" [aste? ?uddha? sak?r?di?
ca].  It is not entirely clear what meaning ??ka??yana saw in this
etymology.  Nirukta [1.14] seems to suggest that there was no meaning
connection between these elements thus derived, and it seems to fault
??ka??yana [atho etat padebhya? padetar?rdh?n sa?cask?ra iti / ya? ananvite
sa?cask?ra, sa tena garhya?] for proposing an etymology with constituents
that do not meaningfully relate to each other.  ??ka??yana probably
believed that all constituent elements proposed in an etymology need to be
derived from a verb-root.
