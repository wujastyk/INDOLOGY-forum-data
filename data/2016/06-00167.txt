[INDOLOGY] MA including Latin and Sanskrit
Dear Colleagues,?? I may mention that the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (Sorbonne, Paris) has a master-level programme in Indo-European and Comparative Linguistics, which includes Latin and Italic languages, Greek, Sanskrit, Tocharian, Iranian, Baltic, Armenian, etc., in the cursus "Linguistique indo-europ?enne et typologie des langues". It includes also languages belonging to non Indo-European languages families: Caucasian, Berber, Austronesian. You will find more information on the web site of the EPHE: ephe.sorbonne.fr
Best wishes,??? Georges-Jean Pinault (EPHE, Paris)

Dear list,
Could anyone point me to masters-level programmes in Europe for Indo-European (and Comparative) Linguistics that would include study of both Latin and/or Greek AND Sanskrit?
Thank you.
