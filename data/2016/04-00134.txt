Dear List,
I add to the forwarded information from the Bhakta Winand Callewaert (Leuven University), whose publications listen below are now on
https://kuleuven.academia.edu/WinandCallewaert
the fact that the Mimamsaka Jean-Marie Verpoorten has done the same recently, on the e-repository of the University of Li?ge:
https://orbi.ulg.ac.be/browse?type=author&value=Verpoorten%2C+Jean-marie+p002598

> 3. Bhagavadg?t?nuv?da. A Study in Transcultural Translation; with Sh?l?nanda Hemr?j,
>    Satya Bharati Publ., Ranchi, 1983; 399 pp.
> In 1983 we wrote in the Preface:
> ?Available in about 75 different languages and in nearly 2,000 different translations,
> the Bhagavad G?t? is, after the Bible, probably the most translated (religious) work in
> world literature. Notwithstanding this popularity of the G?t? in India and abroad, no scientific and detailed survey has been made of the existing translations.

>  
> Around 1620 Jan Gop?l wrote the D?d? Janma L?l?, but within one generation of

> As N?mdev is one of the earliest Bhakti saints in Maharasthra, and extensively quoted

> In this study we give
>    1. An introduction about the sources regarding N?mdev: Do we know N?mdev?,
>    2. A study of the manuscripts and of the singers' variants in them,
>    3. A study of the relation between the manuscripts making use of computer counts,

> As a prominent saint quoted in the Pa?ca-v??? and in the ?di-granth,

>  
> Like the Sarv??g? compiled by D?d??s disciple Rajab, the Sarv??g? of Gopald?s is a
> fascinating product of a 17th century extraordinary memory, as well as a marvelous
> selection of popular Bhakti literature of the period. The size of the manuscript is
> baffling: 364 folios (or 1.6 Mbyte), with as many as 1,669 pad-s and 6,568 s?kh?-s of 138
> identified Bhakta-s. It is not only amazing that Gopald?s could store such an amount
> of literature in his memory. How could he make a selection and classify it according to
> 126 different themes, using existing repertoires that were classified according to r?g,
> and not according to theme?
> In this study I give,
>    Introduction (pp. 5-118):
>                    1. The structure of the Sarv??g? of Gopald?s,

> The ?di Granth is not only the sacred scripture of the Sikhs and a unique document
> for Bhakti literature in North-India: it is also a holy book that has an important place
> in the religious literature of the world. An analysis of the structure of the ?di Granth
> in no way suggests a lack of respect for the sacredness of the scripture. Human hands
> and memories were indeed needed to give form to the divine inspiration.
> 
> The standard reprints of the ?di Granth, in both Gurmukhi and Devanagari, respect
> the initial layout of the first manuscript commissioned by Guru Arjan: on each page
> a standardized number of lines is given, and on each line a standardized number of
> words. (For this page-break, however, there is no uniformity in the different printed
> editions). As a result, the structure of the hymns, the stanzas and end-rhymes cannot
> easily be observed, and it is nigh impossible to make a workable word-index. In view
> of a complete Index, I changed the sacred layout and reprinted the text in such a way
> that the structure of each hymn is visible. Thus an easy reference system could also
> be created.
> In Part I, I reprint in Devanagari the complete text of the ?di Granth (1430 pp.).
> In Part II, I give
>     a long introduction (pp. 1-205) with
>           1. Contents of the ?di Granth,
>           2. Structure of the ?di Granth,
>           3. Glossary,

>           6. Compounds hyphenated in the text,
>           7. Bibliography,
>               followed by the complete index (pp. 1-967) (not given here in pdf).
>  
> 13. Kurukshetra, of Ramdhari Singh Dinkar,
>       translated from Hindi (with Prof. Adeshwara Rao),
>       Heritage Publications, Visakhapatnam ,1995; viii pp. + 106 pp.
>  
> 16. The Hagiographies of Anantad?s,
> Curzon Press, London ; 414 pp.; ISBN 0-7007-1331-X
> Sometime before or around 1600 AD an ascetic of the R?m?nanda order in Rajasthan
> felt inspired to bring together in a poetic composition the different legends he had
> heard about the great Bhakta-s of his times: N?mdev, Kab?r, Raid?s, Dhan?, A?gad,
> Trilochan and P?p?. More famous Bhakta-s he could not have chosen, and four of
> them (Kab?r, Dhan?, P?p? and Raid?s), he says, were initiated by R?m?nanda.
> The association with R?m?nanda was repeated by N?bh? and R?ghavad?s in their
> Bhaktam?l-s, and by later tradition, but doubted by a.o. Parshuram Chaturvedi (1964)
> and modern scholarship.
> In fact, it may have been Anantad?s himself who was responsible for this association.
> The travelling singers who memorized the parca?-s of Anantadas were themselves
> also poets, capable of adding or changing a line or two. The result of their genius and
> creativity is a headache and a challenge for the text critic who looks at manuscripts
> and tries to restore what Anantad?s originally must have recited. A study of the
> parca? -s of Anantad?s gives not only an insight in a very creative period of oral
> transmission. These parca? -s are also like a video of late 16th  century social and
> religious thinking.
> 
> After a long introduction, this study gives
>      a critical edition of the parca? -s, and an English translation (except for Kab?r), and
>      an edition of the pad-s of Dhan?, Trilochan, Pip?, Angad and of R?m?nanda,
>      based on the earliest manuscripts now available.
>  
> 18. The Millenium Kab?r V?n?, A Collection of Pad-s,
>         (in collaboration with Swapna Sharma and Dieter Taillieu), Manohar Publications,
>         New Delhi, 2000, 629 pp.; ISBN 81-7304-357-4
>  
> When around 1500 the Moslem weaver Kab?r sang his songs in Banaras , nobody
> could imagine that at the end of the 20th century he would be the most frequently
> quoted bhakti saint in North-India.
> Five hundred years after Kab?r was born in Banaras and after at least 80 years of
> scholarship, do we have any certainty that the songs attributed to him and published
> in critical and uncritical editions and translations, are by Kab?r?
> I doubt it more and more.
> Between Kab?r and our computer age lie 150 years of oral transmission (which never
> stopped) and nearly 400 years of scribal transmission. We have no oral recordings of
> Kab?r scolding his audiences and I take it for granted that he did not write down his
> compositions. What we have are manuscripts in which his popular repertoire was
> written down, first by traveling singers, and later, in a more respectful and
> professional way, by devoted scribes. But what do we have of Kab?r in those repertoires?
> 
> I argue that with certainty we can only say that the version of Kab?r?s song found in
> the 17th century manuscripts is the version then commonly used and sung by singers.
> Among the pad-s in the v??? of Kab?r we can earmark those that may have been
> popular in the repertoires around 1550, that is two generations after the death of
> Kab?r and one generation before the first manuscripts still preserved now were
> written.
> The norm is ?occurrence? in Punjab and/or Rajasthan.
> When everything is said and done, one question remains: how could Kab?r become
> so charismatic that many devotees, possibly during his lifetime and definitely after
> his death, were happy to insert his name as bha?it? in their own compositions and let those songs circulate with his name, not their own?
> What was his genius that eventually was changed into a social consciousness strongly influencing later generations?
