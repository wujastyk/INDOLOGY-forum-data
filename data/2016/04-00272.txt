[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Textbook Formation
Colleagues:
A former student, now in grad. school, is writing a term paper on 
Sanskrit textbooks and their relationship to the history of Sanskrit in 
the West and the effect of Classical pedagogy on their design. She's 
reached out to me for any literature on this subject and I've drawn a 
blank.
Your suggestions are most welcome.
