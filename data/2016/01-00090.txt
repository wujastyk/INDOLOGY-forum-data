[INDOLOGY] Change of Address
Dear All:
After 25 years, my old server is being taken to wherever dead servers are buried. So now I have to get a new email address. And here it is:
jpo at austin.utexas.edu
The messages to the old address will continue to be redirect to the new one for some time. With thanks and best wishes,
Patrick
