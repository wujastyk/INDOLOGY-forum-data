Subject: [INDOLOGY]  Mind and moon
Message-ID: <CAPTZ0VzYuRbHnbxJp7ruhetLUNFpvVnv7n6CcHp3HY086nkc8A@mail.gmail.com>

I am thinking that maybe the correspondence between mind and moon is not
due to a verbal similarity, but to function similarity, as:

1. the way the mind is apprehending the reality is by reflection;
2. the moon is reflecting the Sun's light.
