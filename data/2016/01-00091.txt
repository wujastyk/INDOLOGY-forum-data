[INDOLOGY] a recent review of the Jamison-Brereton RV translation	by Karen Thomson
I have recently received a pdf file of a strange petulant revew of the J-B
translation of the RV by Thomson in the Times Literary Supplement Jamuary 6
3026.
I have tried to attach this review to an email to Indology, but it failed.
Have others seen this  weird attack?
I will be happy to try to attach the review to individuals on the list.
This attack should be confronted.
