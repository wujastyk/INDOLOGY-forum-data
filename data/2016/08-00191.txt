Dear All,
Does anyone happen to have a pdf of the Jainendravy?kara?a with Somadeva's
commentary, the ?abd?r?avacandrik?? The JV with Abhayanandin's Mah?v?tti is
available at the Jain eLibrary (here
<http://jainlibrary.org/book.php?file=010016>) but I have not been able to
find the former there or elsewhere.
Many Thanks,
Victor
