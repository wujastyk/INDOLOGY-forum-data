Dear David,
"*agamas* has here retained its augment": you apparently postulate a
development in the language here, but one which does not match the
available evidence.
See mainly Karl Hoffmann Der Injunktiv im Veda 1967, but also, offering
alternative analyses of partly the same phrases, Jan Gonda Aspectual
function of the Rgvedic present and aorist.
Another point is that in order to translate the Ramayana a choice has to be
made which edition to take as starting point: even for mere practical
reasons the Baroda critical edition is the obvious candidate to be
selected.
It was the editorial choice of the editors G.H. Bhatt et al. of this
critical edition to give preference systematically to the recension where
most grammatical and metrical "irregularities" are found, i.e., the
Southern recension.
The idea is that the manuscripts of the Northern recension underwent
"polishing" in a much higher degree.
Under this "polishing-theory" one should then expect that specific
"irregularities" in the text are identical and found in a large number of
manuscripts that supposedly represent the older, pre-polishing stage, but
this is precisely what is not the case:
see Leendert van Daalen's 1980 study *Valmiki's Sanskrit*: at present his
study, not without problems of its own, could be redone with more advanced
statistical means and a fresh study of the evidence. On the basis of a
study of books II-IV van Daalen concludes that the Poet Valmiki wrote
mostly "correct" classical Sanskrit -- this does not necessarily always
correspond to "Paninian" sanskrit, and the poor definition of van Daalen's
"irregularities" is one of the weaknesses in his study, which could however
be "repaired" to some extent by referring to other forms of acceptable yet
not strictly Paninian sanskrit (cf. Narayana Bhatta's Apaniniyapramanata
and www.academia.edu/28515426).
E.W. Hopkins 1901 was even more sceptical, or, for those accepting his line
of argument (cf. Madeleine Biardeau's arguments *against* critical editions
for the epics), more realistic, than van Daalen: "There can be no plausible
original reconstructed and practically there was from the time of, let us
say, the first repetition of the text no original Ramayana" (quoted in van
Daalen's study, p. 6).
