M Liceria, Social and Economic History of Karnataka, c. 1972
Dear list members,
Does anyone happen to have a copy of "Social and Economic History of Karnataka" by M Liceria? ?It was submitted as a PhD thesis at Patna University in 1972, but not sure if it was ever published.
Any suggestions about how to get hold of this would be most welcome!
ThanksShubha
