[INDOLOGY] protocol of Google Books ...?
I don?t understand the protocol of Google Books. 
Recently, I came to know that Google Books have PDF-ed my Ph.D. thesis and publicized it. 
I was shocked to know about it. 
1. What happened to the copyright to the author, me in this case?
2. Authors may have plans to revise their graduate-level theses and improve on them before bringing them to the public. To grab such effort in the middle is like collapsing a quiche in the making or thwarting a fetus? growth. Absolutely unacceptable.
Has something like this happened to anyone of our colleagues? Please let me know how to teach Google Books to follow scholarly norms.
Thanks and regards,
rajam
