Subject: [INDOLOGY] protocol of Google Books ...?
Message-ID: <7FFD2BC9-EEE1-414E-9BF7-94837D27BBC2@earthlink.net>

I don?t understand the protocol of Google Books. 

Recently, I came to know that Google Books have PDF-ed my Ph.D. thesis and publicized it. 

I was shocked to know about it. 

1. What happened to the copyright to the author, me in this case?

2. Authors may have plans to revise their graduate-level theses and improve on them before bringing them to the public. To grab such effort in the middle is like collapsing a quiche in the making or thwarting a fetus? growth. Absolutely unacceptable.

Has something like this happened to anyone of our colleagues? Please let me know how to teach Google Books to follow scholarly norms.

Thanks and regards,
rajam
