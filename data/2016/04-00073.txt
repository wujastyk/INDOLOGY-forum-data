[INDOLOGY] DLI Multiple Listings
Dear Madhav,
It seems that they are sometimes the same, and sometimes different. For
example, H. D. Velankar?s translation of ma??ala 7 of the ?gveda that I
checked recently had three scans at DLI. Two were the same scan, both
pretty bad, and one was a different scan, reasonably good quality.
Best regards,
