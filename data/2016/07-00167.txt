[INDOLOGY] Sandhi breaks in longer meters
Dear All,
The verse  (with some minor variations) usually cited in grammatical works
is:
pade tu sa?hit? nity? nity? dh?t?pasargayo? |
sam?se ca tath? v?kye s? vivak??m apek?ate ||
The text given is the earliest attestation I have found, the R?p?vat?ra (p.
6, beginning of the Sa?hit?vat?ra).
The optional sandhis are those at word boundaries, including between
members of a compound, but not within a word or between a root and its
upasarga. This maxim is at times invoked to explain irregular sandhis in
Epic/pur??ic texts. Avivak??, however, is not a valid justification for
failing to apply sandhi in verse according the authorities on poetry. Cf.
K?vy?dar?a 3.159 (Dimitrov's edition).
A look at the various discussions of visandhi, a poetic blemish, will also
reveal a number of interesting discussions about the application of sandhi
in verse. For example, in commenting on K? 3.161, Ratna?r?j??na explains
that the lack of sandhi between the 2nd and 3rd p?das in KA 3.161 (api /
?su) should not be viewed as fault. He further bolsters his/Da??in's view
by citing a verse from the Abhij????kuntala 1.19 (tanoti  /  iyam). Similar
statements are found in other works. There is also a rather lengthy back
and forth between ?la?k?rikas over the ages concerning the correctness of
using perfectly valid prag?hya sandhis (duel endings in ?, ?, and e follwed
by a vowel) ,but it is perhaps not of immediate interest.
All the Best,
Victor D'Avella
