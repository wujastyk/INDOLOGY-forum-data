[INDOLOGY] Numbers --- # 1
Dear Artur,
on the number 84 000 in Buddhist (and Jaina) sources, see this very interesting study:
Ruth Satinsky, "What can the lifespans of ??abha, Bharata, ?rey??sa, and Ara tell us about the History of the concept of Mount Meru?", International Journal of Jaina Studies 11.1 (2015) 1-24.
It is available on-line:
