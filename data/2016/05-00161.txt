[INDOLOGY] Caste system and Buddhism
This is interesting! The same concept seeps through old Tamil texts. 
Specifically, the Tirukkural (???????????) has a couplet which conveys the same idea:  'all are the same by birth and differ by their deeds?.
However, I?ve never been able to find out what those deeds are!
