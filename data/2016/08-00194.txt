Subject: [INDOLOGY] Need info on Kiranavali comm on Tattvamuktakalapa
In-Reply-To: <CAODNnZjkobiVUPYkcxizM9W_XxX-cBWoEOprNdJgkTu040fmTg@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAODNnZhwH5MUox78AWQ5R6Mjfv_EyQurtfOpBoKjwbd0ZV9C4w@mail.gmail.com>

Finally I could locate the book photo copy
Unfortunately the photocopy I received is missing the cover pages preface
and index pages.
How many books have missed in these conditions.

Kiranawali commentary's author is the best to understand text in hair
subtle manner. One is experienced with his Nyayasiddhanta Muktavali etc

Thanks
