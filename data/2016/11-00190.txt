Dear Friends and Colleagues,
Sally and I would like to thank so many of your for your kind words of congratulation on the publication of our translation and annotation of the Uttarak???a. We are moved and grateful.
It has been a long journey working with many  fine scholars in India and the US, some of whom, sadly, are no more. But it has been a wonderful experience to be able to spend so many years immersed in the unparalleled rasas?gara and dharma??stra that is V?lm?ki?s ?dik?vya. We only hope that you all find it to be  at least some small contribution to our understanding of this extraordinary work.
As to Hans? question, my temptation was to say simply that we are going to Disneyland. But, in keeping with the principle, mara??nt?ni k?ry??i, we will now be taking up a fresh translation of Bhavabh?ti?s curious and largely ignored Mah?v?racarita in connection with the Murty series.
Our warmest good wishes to you all.
