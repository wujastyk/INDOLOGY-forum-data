[INDOLOGY] Press Release re: SAMP Open Archives Initiative
Are there any plans (or possibility) that SAMP will make available on-line
the "Indological Series on Microfilm" photographed by U. of Chicagao,
Harvard and Oriental and the British Library in the 1990's..
 I see that both Harvard and U. of Chicago are SAMP members.
