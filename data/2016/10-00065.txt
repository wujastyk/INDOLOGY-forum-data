[INDOLOGY] Another form of harassment
Dear all,
This whole discussion reminds me of an episode that happened  long ago at the then Sorbonne. 
One of my students rushed in and embraced me - the room was otherwise empty -  declaring "Je vous aime, Madame" 
- to which I calmly responded "Jeune homme, je ne m'occupe pas de baby-sitting". End of story.
It never occurred to me that I should report him for sexual harassment. 
With best wishes to all
