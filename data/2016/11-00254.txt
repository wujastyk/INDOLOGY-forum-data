[INDOLOGY] Diacriticals in unicode, single or multiple glyphs
Dear Harry,
	I forwarded your question about TITUS text search to Jost Gippert.
	The Sanskrit Library texts include all the TITUS texts as of the time of our collaborative project ending in 2009.  In addition these texts include the grammatical texts of the NEH-funded projects headed by George Cardona 1990-1993 and a few others.  The Sanskrit Library search facility is now a literal search of the input string converted to SLP of the source (also in SLP) of the Unicode HTML.  Highlighting of found matches appears in the Unicode HTML.  This manner of conducting the search is highly reliable and free of the ambiguities you described due to the variety of encodings available with and without precomposition of diacritics.  We do not yet offer lemmatized searching or search across all texts, though we aim to develop this facility in due course.
	Yours,
	Peter
