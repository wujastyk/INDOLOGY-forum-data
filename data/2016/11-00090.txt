[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit translations and parallel corpora
Respected Prof. Hellwig,
https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/
and
http://www.valmikiramayan.net/ seem to have huge translation texts, which
may be of use to you.
e.g. gitasupersite has some Sanskrit commentaries and translation of those
commentaries as well e.g. Abhinavagupta's.
