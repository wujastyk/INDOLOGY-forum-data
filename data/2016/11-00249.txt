Thank you, Manu, for providing exactly what I needed! The piece is confirmed to be in Andhra Pradesh, dated from 12th century AD. At least one similar specimen is kept in the Telangana State Archaeology Museum in Hyderabad. The frieze on the side depicts the a??adikp?las. Thus the iconography of both time and space (with possible correlation) are combined in this piece. 

Thanks also to Nagaraj for the comments, and to Matthew Kapstein and Corinna Wessels-Mevissen for providing me additional materials and remarks offline.
