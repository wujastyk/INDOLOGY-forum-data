Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ms colopon from Nepal, need help
Message-ID: <00c9df69-a057-8a97-4c8a-8192ba12f492@gmail.com>

Dear list,

In manuscript E 1160/3 of the National Archives of Nepal (Nepal German 
Manuscript Project)--also cataloged by the Asha Saphu Kuti as 5229--the 
following colophon is given at the end of the text:

nep?lavar?e ya?a?arakhacare vidy?nandena likhita? hi ?ubha? bh?y?t ||

Does anyone know what "ya?a?arakhacare" designates?

Attached is a photo of the folio (if it goes through).

Thanks for any help.
