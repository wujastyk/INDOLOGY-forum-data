[INDOLOGY] Ms colopon from Nepal, need help
Dear list,
In manuscript E 1160/3 of the National Archives of Nepal (Nepal German 
Manuscript Project)--also cataloged by the Asha Saphu Kuti as 5229--the 
following colophon is given at the end of the text:
nep?lavar?e ya?a?arakhacare vidy?nandena likhita? hi ?ubha? bh?y?t ||
Does anyone know what "ya?a?arakhacare" designates?
Attached is a photo of the folio (if it goes through).
Thanks for any help.
