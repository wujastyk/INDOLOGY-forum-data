Well, past experience tells that HUP has its own sweet rules (though we do all the work, from writing to layout; they just sell our HOS books).

The books have arrived by UPS yesterday, that means also at the depository of HUP (Triliteral).
But they may go on sale only by the official date. Just try to (pre-)order. (I will also ask them)

If you BADLY need a copy before that, let me know privately.

Best wishes & enjoy,

Michael Witzel (ed.)

Dear Jonathan,

Many thanks for letting us know about this important publication. I did not even know that it was coming. We have long needed a critical edition of this text. Amazon is also still showing August for publication date. But you are saying that it is now out and can now be obtained from Harvard University Press. Great!

Does the "(I)" after the title mean that you are preparing a second volume? If so, what will it contain? Thanks.

Best regards,

David Reigle

Dear Friends,

Harvard Oriental Series 81
Materials Toward the Study of Vasubandhu?s Vi??ik? (I)
Sanskrit and Tibetan Critical Editions of the Verses and Autocommentary; An English Translation and Annotations
HARDCOVER
$30.00 ? ?22.95 ? ?27.00
ISBN 9780674970670

The blurb: The ?Twenty Verses on Manifestation-Only? of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (c. 350?430?), his Vi???k?, is one of the most important treatises of the Yog?c?ra school. Accompanied by the author?s own commentary, the text lays out a vision of a ?Buddhist Idealism? in which even one?s experience of the sufferings of hell is revealed to be nothing other than the results of working out one?s karma. Later scholars commented on the work a number of times, in its original Sanskrit, in Tibetan translation, and in three Chinese versions.

This book presents an edition and translation of the Sanskrit text of the core verses, alongside the original author?s commentary, based directly on the manuscript evidence. This is accompanied by an edition of the canonical translations of these texts found in the Tibetan Tanjurs, as well as a ?draft translation? of the verses in Tibetan, found in a manuscript from Dunhuang. This publication therefore provides the most reliable and comprehensive philological accounting to date for this fundamental work.

The website (http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674970670) says August, but it's published now.

very best, Jonathan
