[INDOLOGY] Death's Footprint
Dear List,
I would also like to add a comment on the problem raised by Yarrod which
concerns the interpretation of mrtyoh in mrtyoh padam (which I have already
sent to Yarrod off the list). I think that both interpretations (i.e
subjective and objective genetive) are possible. However, as far as I know,
in the RV the first one is only implied via the concept of Yama who has
first found the way to the afterlife "pasture" which is to be followed by
people (RV 10.14.1-2, I write about it in my "Fire and Cognition"). The
concept of leaving tracks is the important source domain for
conceptualization various activities in the RV - as George has shown in his
paper.
Best,
Joanna
