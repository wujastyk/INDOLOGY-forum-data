[INDOLOGY] Transcoding
Dear Peter and others,
The most convenient way to transform Sanskrit text from one encoding to another is to use the transcoding software developed by the Sanskrit Library.  This transcoding software can be used in one of two ways:
1. Strings of text of any length can be transcoded in toto by pasting them into the transcoding window on the web at: http://sanskritlibrary.org/transcodeText.html
Simply select the input and output encodings from the two menus at the bottom of the page.
2. Download the transcoding software and install it locally on your own machine and run it under Unix and transcode from and two a great number of transcodings.  On a Mac or Linux system this is easy.  I don't know how to do it on a PC.  The downloaded software permits very sophisticated delineation of which strings to transcode within a document of mixed text.  One can tag strings in a certain way, for example with specific start and end character strings or xml tags, and then transcode all strings with those tags in one way and all strings with another tag in another, e.g. transcode <s>kfzRa</s> to Devanagari and <r>kfzRa</r> to Roman.  Or one can select text within a document to transcode using regular expressions.  The software is available for download near the bottom of the alphabetical list of downloadable software on the Sanskrit Library downloads page: http://sanskritlibrary.org/downloads.html.  Look for TranscodeFile (Java program)
I have made a number of transcoding rules for my own use which I'm glad to share if you want help getting started.
Yours,
Peter
