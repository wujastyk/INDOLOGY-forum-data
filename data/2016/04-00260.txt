Dear Ganesan,
According to my research, the view that the Yogasutra and the Bhashya are a
unified text composed by a single person is much better supported by
multiple sources than the view of a separate authorship. However, I am not
married to this hypothesis and would be very willing to accept the opposite
view in the light of new evidence. Therefore I am very much interested in
any source that clearly states a different authorship of the Yogasutra and
the Bhashya before the Sarvadar?anasa?graha.
So far I have only found self-contradictory references to the PY? by
V?caspatimi?ra I and the account of V?dir?ja S?ri (in his commentary on
Akala?ka?s Ny?yavini?caya from around 1025 CE), stating that a *bh??ya* on
Pata?jali?s s?tra was composed by the S??khya teacher Vindhyav?sin (see *Ny?ya
Vini?caya Vivara?am of ?r? V?dir?ja S?ri the Commentary on
Bha???kala?kadeva?s Ny?ya Vini?caya.* Vol 1. Pratyak?a Prast?va. Ed. with
introd., appendices, variant readings, comparative notes etc. by Mahendra
Kum?r Jain. Kashi: Bh?rat?ya J??nap??ha, 1940, p. 231, l. 6?10).
I would be therefore very thankful for any additional substantial reference
(preferably by mentioning the page and line of a printed book) that you (or
any of our colleagues) could provide and that may contribute to solving the
authorship question of the PY?.
Best,
Philipp
