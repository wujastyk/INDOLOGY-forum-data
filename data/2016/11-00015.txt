Re: [INDOLOGY] First female sovereign
Also the tenth-century ruler of Kashmir Didd?. (Interestingly she often referred to herself in the masculine, and I believe the K?katiya queen mentioned did so too.)Not sure if she is the very first though. Best,J

Dear colleagues,
Who was the first female sovereign in India?  I know about Razia Sultana in the 13th century, but were there any earlier?  Has there been any more recent research on Razia since Rafiq Zakaria's 1966 book?
Thank you,
Michael
