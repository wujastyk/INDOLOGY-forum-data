Dear Jacob,

It is a Yantra. It has the word yantra inscribed on it.

It has :

?????????? ???????(sic)  ?????????? ????? ?? ?? ?????? ??????????

(ya?trar?j?ya vidmahi mah?ya?tr?ya dh?mahi ?a? n? ya?tra? prac?day?t )

???????  ??????????????? ???? ?????? .... ??????

(asmin  t??braya?trasukha? cira? kartu? .... sv?h? )


??? ?????? ??????? (sic)  ??? ?????? ?????

(h?? jval?ya vidmahi (sic)  mah? ??lin? dh?mahi )

There is a mention of a deity called pratikriy???lin  in the yantra.

This may indicate that the yantra is meant to counter the action of another
supernatural power.

If this guess is correct, it is usually not the kind used in the prat??h?
in a temple.

The interpretation  " it is a Telugu "Saccra" (cakra) used to ward off
disease and spirits of possession" should be correct.

Using yantras in the installation (prat??h? ) in a temple is a usual
practice. But this one does not seem to be of that kind.
