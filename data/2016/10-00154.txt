[INDOLOGY] Sexual Harassment
Dear all,
If I may, as far as the Kath?sarits?gara is concerned 
The one who attempts to rape Vinayavat? is a vidy?dhara whose name is not given in the text. He is cursed to become a camel. The curse ends when Pu?kar?k?a, the future husband of Vinayavat?, kills the camel and thus frees the vidy?dhara (XII, 2, 104-108). 
More interesting in relation to sexual harassment are two embedded tales in the KSS VI. If we agree to define sexual harassment as an abuse on behalf of someone who is in a position of power and who abuses of his/her power to sexually abuse someone who is in a subordinate position.
Here we have an instance of ?sexual harassment? narrated by a wise woman to protect herself against an attempt of rape on behalf of the king who is supposed to protect women in the absence of the man in charge of their protection.
When Udayana, the King of the Vatsa goes at night in Kali?gasen??s house, she refuses herself to him and says that if ever he tries to take her by force she would surely die afterwards. Kali?gasen? narrates to him the story of the King Indradatta and the wife of a merchant. The merchant is gone for a business trip. The king seizes this chance to get into the house at night. Even though the merchant?s wife is imploring him, reminding him of his duty to protect, he tries to take her by force and finally her heart bursts. After a few days, Indradatta dies out of shame and remorse. Hearing this sad story awakens the king of the Vatsa who promises to protect Kali?gasen?.
