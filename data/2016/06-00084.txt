[INDOLOGY] J?ti as Caste in Ny?ya?
1. While the discussion of Jayanta is mentioned to be on Varnas, the title
of the post /thread has 'caste' in it. Since it is now well established
that these two are two different categories /concepts, we might need to be
careful about this distinction.
2. For Nyaya, gotva is as much a jaati as  ghaTatva is jaati. ghaTatvajaati
is as much empirically observable and directly perceivable as
gotvajaati.
3. Those mentioned by Jayanta are not saying BraahmaNatva etc. are not like
gotva etc. They are saying exactly the opposite. They are saying 'because
braahmanatva etc. are not like gotva etc. the validity of what all Brahmins
have in common can be verified / known only through a different source of
knowledge than the one that can establish what all cows have in common.
