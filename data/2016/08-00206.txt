[INDOLOGY] request pdf article Upinder Singh
Dear list members,
I hope someone can help me with a pdf of, or a link to, the following article by Upinder Singh:
"Texts on Stone: Understanding Asoka's Epigraph-Monuments and their Changing Contexts", Indian Historical Review 24 (1-2) (1997), 1-19.
The library in Leiden could not locate the issue, though according to the catalogue it should have been there.
