[INDOLOGY] suicide as a result of love
In Buddhist commentarial literature, we have examples like that of Bhadd? Ku??alakes? (Dhammapada commentary on vv 102-3), a well-brought-up girl who falls in love with a convicted bandit on his way to execution, and embarks on a hunger-strike to force her parents to let her marry him. (Spoilers: it doesn?t work out very well.)
