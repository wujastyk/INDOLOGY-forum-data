S?rya is once said to be h?ri-ke?a (10,137,7) and also, in association 
with the rising of the sun, h?ri-ke?a is once said from Savitar, RV 
10.139,1ab:

s??ryara?mir h?rike?a? pur?st?t savit?? jy?tir ?d ay?m? ?jasram /

?With rays of the sun, with yellow-red (golden) hair, from the east 
Savitar has just raised up the unfading light.?

Also Agni is once, RV 3,2,13,  said to be h?ri-ke?a and RV 1, 79,1, to 
be of "golden hair" (h?ra?ya-ke?a).

This seems to be metaphoric in contrast to Indra?s anthropomorphic 
descriptions.
