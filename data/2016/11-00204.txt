Dear friends,
I?m having trouble locating two sources on artha??stra, and I hoped someone on the list might be able to help me. I give here the bibliographic information as I have it.
1. Ruben, W. 1929. Study in the Artha??stra. Dharwar. (This is cited in Sternbach?s Bibliography of Kau?ilya Artha??stra, which has a number of errors, as well as, at least, Botto?s article on dvaidh?bh?va in India Maior). Worldcat has the following, but I couldn?t get it from the British Library to see if it is the same:

2. Kavi, Ramakrishna. [title unknown: multiple articles on and text of the C?k?u??ya Artha??stra]. Journal of the Venkatesvara Oriental Institute. 1:79-89; 3:99-116; 4:123-128; 4:129-140; 6:129-140(?). This comes from Kane I p. 152ff.
With thanks in advance for any help hunting down any of these.
All best,
Mark
