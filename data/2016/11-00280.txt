Looking at the distribution and locations of "vai" and "ha" in Ramayana
book 1.
Chapter 1 has the most occurances of "ha" in the Late Epic expected
location at paada end,  6 times.  with no occurances in Vedic expected
position (of second word in sentence or anywhere else). vai does not occur
in chapter 1.
Chapter 2 which describes the creation of shloka metre incident is more
ambiguous.  "ha" occurs in verse 8 at Vedic expected position (second word
in sentence) and once in non-vedic expected position but not at paada end
in verse 19.  And "ha" occurs once in Late Epic expected position at paada
end in verse 20.
But what surprises me is that the occurance of "ha" is so irregular since
its use in the Ramayana (with only one exception) is as a metrical filler
at paada end. Chapter 1 having 6 occurances of "ha" at paada end but with
many chapters not having "ha" at all.
"ha" does not occur in chapters 3 thru 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21,
23 thru 33, 36, 37, 39 thru 42, 44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59,
63, 64, 67, 69, 71, 72, 74 and 76
