Subject: [INDOLOGY] Cuts at U. of Copenhagen include indology

Truly depressing indeed.

Can I ask if there have been any attempts made to establish a
privately funded Professorship in Tibetan Studies or cognate at
Copenhagen University? Such privately funded or endowed positions in
Classics seem to be relatively immune from internecine cuts.

Kind regards,
