[INDOLOGY] Cuts at U. of Copenhagen include indology
Truly depressing indeed.
Can I ask if there have been any attempts made to establish a
privately funded Professorship in Tibetan Studies or cognate at
Copenhagen University? Such privately funded or endowed positions in
Classics seem to be relatively immune from internecine cuts.
Kind regards,
