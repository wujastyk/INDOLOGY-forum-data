[INDOLOGY] avagraha and sanskrit meter
The *V?jasaneyi Pr?ti??khya* mentions that:
*sam?se?vagraho hrasvasamak?la?* (5.1)
?In [the padap??ha of] a compound, the avagraha has the same time has a
hrasva vowel.?
The commentaries of Uva?a and Anantabha??a explain that the ?avagraha? is
separation of a compound into its constituent elements:
Uva?a: *dvayo? padayo? p?thaggraha?o'vagraha?? n?n?graha ityartha??
hrasvasamak?lo hrasv?k?aratulyak?lo bhavati?*
Anantabha??a: *avagraho n?ma dvayo? padayo? p?thakkara?am? sa ca
hrasv?k?arasamak?lo bhavati?*
However, this applies to the *padap??ha* and not to the *sa?hit?p??ha*.
Nowadays, the *avagraha* sign is used to show what is called *ak?rapra?le?a*
.
In Vedic *sa?hit?p??ha* or in laukika poetry, the *avagraha* is not
considered a syllable for prosodic purposes.

Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar* by K.V. Abhyankar
