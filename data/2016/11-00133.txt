[INDOLOGY] bhakti
Correction:
Brahmin tag is not used, not required, nor does it sell for any other goods
or services not part of 'Hindu' 'religious' 'rituals'. Life of Indians is
enormously much beyond 'Hindu' 'religious' 'rituals'. In the case of goods
and services related to all those aspects beyond Life of Indians is
enormously much beyond 'Hindu' 'religious' 'rituals' ,  In all these cases,
Brahmin is not equal to good. It can be said that in all these cases,
Brahmin is equal to not good also.
