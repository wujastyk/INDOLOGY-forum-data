Hi Toke,
Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism has an entry, "Transmission of Knowledge," that might be helpful.

[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit material on philosophy of education
Dear all,
A colleague of mine sent me the following question:
"I am teaching a course on education and its objectives. We do a fair bit of philosophy in this course but most of our sources are European. Do you think there are certain Sanskrit treatises (hopefully available in English) which belong in a course on the philosophy of education?"
Would any of you be able to comment on this question?
Best wishes,
Toke
