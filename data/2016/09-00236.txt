Patrick mentioned that scriptural commandments "were originally meant for a
group of people in a different time and place," which is not the way that
M?m??sakas understand scriptural commandments. They consider the
commandments themselves to be outside of time (and apauru?eya, not authored
by any historical person), and their addressees to be defined by open-ended
criteria that cut across time and space (adhik?ra). There is some
discussion of how these commandments are imagined to work in the
M?m??s?ny?yaprak??a, already mentioned, which has been translated by
Franklin Edgerton <http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/264213>, and in
James Benson's recent translation of the M?m??s?ny?yasa?graha of Mah?deva
Ved?ntin (Wiesbaden 2010). Maybe one place to start is the discussion of
adhik?ra-vidhis (in the sixth adhy?ya of the M?m??s? system, and section
225 ff. in Edgerton's translation).
You may also want to consult Kanchana Natarajan, *The Vidhi Viveka of
Ma??ana Mi?ra: Understanding Vedic Injunctions* (Delhi 1995).
