Message-ID: <D333A179.27478%lubint@wlu.edu>

Dear Erik,

If you are talking about the downloader, which has never worked for me anyway, I don?t know.  DLI seems to be in the process of shifting over from the old on-line page-by-page reader to offering PDFs.  There are multiple portals, and I have found that files from http://www.dli.ernet.in from come in at a trickle or are ?not found," but this portal works fine at the moment:
http://dli.serc.iisc.ernet.in

Best,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Problems with DLI-downloader

Dear colleagues,

For the last couple of days I have been having problems downloading from DLI via DLI v.5.9. Whatever title I try to download it comes out saying ?Not found?. Does anybody have an explanation?

Regards

Erik
