[INDOLOGY] Aulikara inscription from Bhanpura
Dear All,
I have stumbled upon a reference to an Aulikara inscription from 
Bhanpura. This is mentioned in passing R. K. Sharma & O. P. Mishra 2003, 
Archaeological Excavations in Central India, page 7. 
(https://books.google.hu/books?hl=hu&id=o0ISjDDWJwQC&q=bhanpura#v=snippet&q=bhanpura&f=false). 
I believe the Bhanpura in question must be the town at 24?30'47.5"N 
75?44'49.4"E but I have not managed to turn up any information about a 
supposed Aulikara inscription from this place. If anyone has any 
information about one, please share.
Thank you,
Daniel
