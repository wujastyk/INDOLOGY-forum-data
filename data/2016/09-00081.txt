Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit material on philosophy of education
Dear Toke,
You may wish to take a look at Jonathan Gold, The Dharma's Gatekeepers (SUNY 2007).
It is based primarily on a 13th c. Tibetan trivium that cleaves closely to Sanskrit sources.
Richard Nance, Speaking for Buddhas (Columbia U Press) addresses Indian Buddhist
instruction in ch. 2.
Altekar's 1944 work, Education in Ancient India, may also prove useful.
Hope this helps,
Matthew
