[INDOLOGY] bhakti
There are two aspects to this:
1. Everyday practitioner is  not interested in all the details such as
v?dakalpavr?k?a vigalitam etc. still applies.
2. itih?sapur???bhy?m v?d?rtha mupabr?mhay?t , the concept of pa?chama
v?da etc. are all part of the huge pur??a tradition, which needs to be
studied, with a more intricate and nuanced understanding than claiming
'Vedic' for prestige. Such an understanding requires considerations such as
Vedic-folk intercultural communication, cultural assimilations, birth of
new 'syncretic' cultures, classical-folk (m?rga-d??i) mutual influences,
etc.
3. All this, not for the everyday practitioner but for the
interested vidwans. How much everyday practitioner is interested in
itih?sapur???bhy?m v?d?rtha mupabr?mhay?t , the concept of pa?chama
v?da etc. is to be inductively empirically to be surveyed.
4. On the lines of 'India as a linguistic area', if an idea like 'India as
a cultural area' is brought in the processes of cultural convergence and
cultural substrata and commonalities and differences in their reflection in
the literate traditions such as pur??as and oral traditions such as folk
'literature' etc. can be more intricately studied.
