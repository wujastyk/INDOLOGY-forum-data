Subject: [INDOLOGY] HarfBuzz in LibreOffice
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeddcCTBi1nDxAXoBSYuXhMsBUYedaQqxtqGQrYArZppw@mail.gmail.com>

In the pre-release version of LibreOffice 5.3, we see HarfBuzz arriving as
the standard library for the rendering of complex texts (like Devanagari).
Good news.

?Thanks to Akash Jain and Khaled Hosny (who is also deeply involved in
supporting XeTeX)?.
