[INDOLOGY] Medieval cities discovered in Cambodia
Very interesting indeed. But "largest 12th century empire"? Are they forgetting Song China
and the Abbasid Caliphate? And what of the Cholas?  I imagine that the superlatives are
intended for consumption by journalists and funding agencies. In all events, this is wonderful
research and it will be good, one day, to see it placed more fully into the larger South and East Asian contexts
of the period.
