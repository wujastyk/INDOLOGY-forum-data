Dear Jan,



Let me address your points one by one:



1. Rhetoric: We kept our rhetoric mild compared with Eli Franco?s *ad
hominems*. We merely corrected him on several embarrassing factual and
philological errors. He, not we, would benefit from a lesson on how to
write.



2. Definition: Your argument that Bronkhorst is Dutch is like saying that a
chef of Chinese cuisine must be Chinese.* The Nay Science* and the *Theses*
evaluated an episteme and a method. Bronkhorst shares this episteme and
method, not least its problematic anti-Brahmanism.



3. Violence: We used Marxism as an analytic tool and not because we
recommend Marxism or a Marxist revolution. In any case, ?Marxist moral high
ground? refers not to us, but to the *Indologists*. You appear to have
misread the sentence in haste.



Please do read these works closely; otherwise our discussion will suffer
from the defect of *argumentum ad lapidem*. Sorry for this brief response,
I returned exhausted from several workshops on Indology in Delhi and Pune,
and Vish and I have two end-of-year books to complete. Let?s talk more when
we meet, or let?s raise this to the level of some academic pieces. Vish and
I are working on an edited volume of responses to *The Nay Science*, you
could contribute there. As you know, I find opining back-and-forth on an
online list demeans us as scholars, and these issues are far too important
for reflex responses. :)
