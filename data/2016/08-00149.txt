Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help needed with Oriyan palm leaf ms
Message-ID: <20160822173414.tquzyi3skgcsgoos@webmail1.abo.fi>


Dear Colleagues,

Could someone help me out with reading the first couple of sentences  
of this (rather poorly scanned) ca. 17th century Oriyan ms of the  
Bhagavadbhaktivilasa (attached)? I am hoping that getting a start  
would help me pick up the thread more easily.

Sincerely
M?ns Broo
