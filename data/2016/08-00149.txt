[INDOLOGY] Help needed with Oriyan palm leaf ms
Dear Colleagues,
Could someone help me out with reading the first couple of sentences  
of this (rather poorly scanned) ca. 17th century Oriyan ms of the  
Bhagavadbhaktivilasa (attached)? I am hoping that getting a start  
would help me pick up the thread more easily.
Sincerely
M?ns Broo
