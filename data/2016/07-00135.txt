Dear Matthew,

If you haven't already spotted it, I remember in Monier Williams under ?khu
one finds: ?khuvi?ah? and ?khuvi??pah?:

'destroying a rat's venom', the grass Lipeocercis Serrata and the grass
Andropogon Serratum (both considered as remedies for a rat's bite).

I wonder if maybe the idea of venom had to do with a bite getting infected?

Best wishes,
Charles
