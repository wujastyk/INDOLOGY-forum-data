[INDOLOGY] QUERY: mouse-venom
Dear Matthew,
If you haven't already spotted it, I remember in Monier Williams under ?khu
one finds: ?khuvi?ah? and ?khuvi??pah?:
'destroying a rat's venom', the grass Lipeocercis Serrata and the grass
Andropogon Serratum (both considered as remedies for a rat's bite).
I wonder if maybe the idea of venom had to do with a bite getting infected?
Best wishes,
Charles
