[INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock
Dear list members,
In the last two days, the petition against Prof. Pollock has received
considerable attention in India and has been covered in several mainstream
media publications. While this thread has focussed mainly on the
misinterpretaion/misunderstanding of quote from a specific talk by Prof.
Pollock, the news reports have primarily focussed on the political aspects
(Prof. Pollock?s views on JNU), confirming my views expressed earlier on
this thread that the petition may well be a response to Prof. Pollock
signing the political-cum-solidarity statement on the hotly debated JNU
issue.
The website of the left-leaning The Hindu carried a small report titled
?Murthy foundation under fire.? The headline is not very accurate as it is
Prof. Pollock under fire in the petition and not the Murthy foundation.
The Huffington Post India, India arm of the liberal Huffington Post,
carries a report today by Indrani Basu titled ?Pro-JNU Statement Spawns
Petition For Ouster Of Sheldon Pollock As Editor Of Murty Classical
Library.? The article largely cites the political aspects of the petition.
Another article in the Economic Times (owned by the centrist Times Group)
is titled ?JNU fallout: Petition wants Murty Classical Library to remove
editor? states ?In what seems to be a retaliation for his condemning the
government?s action against protesting students ...? It also adds ?Those
aware of Pollock's work held that the signatories ?misrepresent Pollock to
achieve their end.??
The centrist Indian Express published a report by Anushree Majumdar
yesterday titled ?Murty library editor: Petition wants US scholar removed,
cites JNU remarks.? The sub-title reads
?The petition also said that Pollock had been ?a prominent signatory of
several statements which are of a purely political nature?.?
