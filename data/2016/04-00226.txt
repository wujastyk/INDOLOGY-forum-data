Dear list members,
I have two questions regarding possible parallels to the P??upata
understanding of yama and niyama regulations, as explained by Kau??inya in
his *Pa?c?rthabh??ya*.

1. Are there other traditions which consider yama regulations to be
permanent, and niyamas to be subject to change, depending on time, place,
etc.? Is it a common understanding of the division between yama and niyama
among philosophers of Yoga, or in other branches of ?aivism?

2. Are there other traditions accepting ten yama regulations?

With best wishes,
