[INDOLOGY] yamas and niyamas
Dear Patrick,
If you are looking for compassion (karu??) in Pata?jali, you will find it
at YS 1.33, as you probably know. It is a value espoused by Pata?jali, just
not as a yama.
Many theistic yoga texts post-Pata?jali (i.e., of the Pa?car?tras and
P??upatas) list 10 yamas and 10 niyamas, not five. Some of these include
compassion (k?p? or day?) as one of their 10 yamas. But I don?t know how
far back these traditions of 10 go before Pata?jali.
For most modern yogis, the most influential late medieval yoga text is
Sv?tmar?ma's Ha?ha-Yoga-Prad?pik?, which lists 10 yamas and 10 niyamas (see
1.18-19). One of the 10 yamas is compassion (day?). Nowadays yoga
practitioners often conflate P?ta?jala and Ha?ha Yoga traditions--could
this be a source of your respondent's ideas?
Best wishes,
Andrew
