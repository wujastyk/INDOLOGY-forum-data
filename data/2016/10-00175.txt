Dear Madhav,
For a senior colleague who has been visiting Pune for over 40 years,
usually 2-3 months per year, I have collected all your recent verses on
Pune.
I have found in messages between 19 and 23 June:
42 verses,
4 in ??rd?lavikr??ita
38 in ?loka/vaktra, mostly in regular form (pathy?, the form which ?follows
the path?, what Jacobi in 1885 called their ?gew?hnlichste Form?), the
number of vipul?s does not exceed 10-12%.
Please allow me to express in my own little ?loka my gratitude for your
brilliance; generosity and 'good-heartedness' (sauhrdya) thanks to which we
all can have a 'vision' of modern Pune:

??????? ??? ????  ????? ????????? ?????? ?

???? ??????????????  ??????? ???????????? ?

dhanyatam? vaya? hanta  ye??? nas t?dr?a? suhrt /

yasya s?dh?ktak?vyena  pa?y?ma? pu?yapattanam //
