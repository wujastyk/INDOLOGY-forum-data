The *pli? squat *Video that you shared shows that the condition that the
feet have to be close to each other while the fingers of the feet are
directed in mutually opposite directions, left foot fingers rightwards left
foot fingers leftwards the two feet making 180 degrees to each other does
not exist in the  *pli? squat. *The movement of pulling down the hip region
in  *pli? squat  *is not found in Arrai Mandi.
