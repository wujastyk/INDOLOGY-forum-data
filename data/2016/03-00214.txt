[INDOLOGY] Revolving wheel in ancient Indian literature
Dear Colleagues
I appreciate - very much - the pointers to the text of the RV and the BhP.
*re: 360*
It seems that in the later texts (already in the Mbh.) the number does not
necessarily relate to the concept of the "ideal" solar year, numbering 360
civil days. Wouldn't it better fit the concept of the lunar year consisting
of 12 synodic months, 30 tithis each?
If one tithi is equal to 63/64 of one civil day (that is 0.984375d), then
360 tithis constitute  the lunar year (360x0.984375 d), that is 354.375d
and twelve synodic months, 29.53125d each.
And, let me repeat the question: could the two serpents guarding the Wheel
of the Year (Mbh. I, 29.5-7) symbolize the two equinoctial points?
Regards,
Artur
