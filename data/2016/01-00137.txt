Wonderful gift indeed, John and Mary!

One minor issue: in your background material bundle, the document titled
"dates of texts (tentative).pdf" has the left side of the table cut off,
and many dates and names of the Pur??as in the first column appear chopped.
Could you reload a better copy, if possible?

Thanks,
Suresh.
