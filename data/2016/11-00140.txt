[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology (was: bhakti)
at all about 'Vedic astrology' except the conventional religious window
dressing by certain brahmin astrologers.
Robert, today, what is being called as 'Vedic' astrology in the English
knowing circles is not practiced only by Brahmins. Whatever dressing or
cosmetics is being done is being done by the western circles of the
practice and the English tag 'Vedic' is needed by them and is used by them.
Brahmin and non-Brahmin contemporary  busy practitioners do not even need
this English word or its Indian language forms such as Vaidik or Vaidika.
You mentioned a Jaina practitioner and her appearance on TV. Here, we have
Muslim practitioners appearing/advertising on TV. There are tribal
practitioners claiming authentic tribal jyotishya. None of the Brahmin or
non-Brahmin practitioners appearing on TV or the  TV people themselves use
the words such as 'Vedic' 'Vaidik' or 'Vaidika'.
Such belief systems and their believers do not need any such
tags. Satisfaction of knowing the destiny and handling it is all that
isimportant. Not whether it is Jaina, Muslim or Tribal , Tantric, or
whatever.
