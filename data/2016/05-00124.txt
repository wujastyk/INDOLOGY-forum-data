[INDOLOGY] Tibetan names of four gompas
Dear Colleagues,
I participate in the preparation of the list of Polish exonyms for South
Asian names of important buildings and other anthropogenic objects for
publication.
Could you, please, give me the Wylie transliteration for the names of four
Tibetan Buddhist monasteries located in India?
Hemis Gompa
Pemayangtse Gompa
Shey Gompa
Tashigang Gompa
Thanks - in advance,
