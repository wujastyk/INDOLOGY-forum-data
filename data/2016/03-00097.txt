It seems highly improbable that the Hebrew Sin (????) used in Tanach could be connected to China:

And this meaning is not attested even in Talmud and Midrashic literature (see Jastrow for ?????, p. 982). It would be interesting to know since when does Sin in Hebrew mean China. It could be rather modern usage, I don't know.
