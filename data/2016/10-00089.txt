[INDOLOGY] Information sought regarding Telugu "Saccra" (cakra)
Dear Jacob,
The scribe has a heavy influence of Kannada writing.
Sometimes, in Yantras, script mixing is done for encryption purposes. But
we see here is a glyph mixing. This may only show the bilingual habits of
the scribe. The writing style is Vijayanagara and a little later.
Mistakes in the Sanskrit could be scribal errors or may indicate lack of
Sanskrit scholarship on the part of the Yantra-making taantrika himself.
S'ooli is S'iva. Hence the yantra is focussed on a certain form of S'iva
with counteracting power.
He is being called Mahaas'oolin here. Is also being addressed as
Pratikriyaas'oolin.
The ajapaagaayatree soham hamsah is also found.
The words used such as yantra sukham chiram kuru etc.  indicate a soft,
peaceful, benevolent practice behind the yantra.
Hope this helps.
