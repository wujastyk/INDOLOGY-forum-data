[INDOLOGY] A grammar question
The Pa?inian form is indeed *dve??vahai* as attested in the
*Siddh?ntakaumud?* under *lu?i ca* (SK 2434, A 2.4.43). I do not recall any
special rule for *vi + dvi?*, so the Pa?inian form would be *vidve??vahai*,
and the form *vidvi??vahai *would be a *ch?ndasa* usage where the lack of
*gu?a* can either be explained by extending one of the *bahulam *rules to
cover this case or as an *?tmanepada *usage from the *n?madh?tu
**vidvi?a *formed
from the word *vidvi?a* (=*vi + dvi? + ka *by *igupadhaj??pr?kira? ka?*, A
3.1.135) meaning enemy by *sarvapr?tipatikebhya ?c?re kvibv? vaktavya?* (V
3.1.11).
MacDonnel/Whitney may have missed this form.
