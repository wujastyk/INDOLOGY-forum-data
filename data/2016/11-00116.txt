[INDOLOGY] bhakti
Nagaraj,
Yes, I did write what you say, but dismissing what the Pur??as' stress 
in this respect is not as simple as attributing it to 'academic' 
sections of the 'educated.' There is a long tradition of public Pur??a 
recitation, and the different texts are regularly used by followers of 
the different divinities. Witness the importance of the Bh?gavata for 
Bengali vai??avas, as well as other examples. Each case can, and should 
be studied by itself, I agree, but there is an unmistakable "dialogue" 
that rejects others' views.  I am not proposing a reductionist approach, 
simply pointing out a common thread that can be considered together with 
specific contexts for the different cases.
