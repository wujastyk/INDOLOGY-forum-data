Dear Peter Wyzlic,
Thank you for your reply.
I knew about this, but the Universit?t Hamburg does not have
full access to the series of the WZKM via JSTOR, which means
that from here I can read that article online, but not download it.
This is why I bothered the list members.
Best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
Universit?t Hamburg
