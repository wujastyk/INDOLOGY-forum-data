[INDOLOGY] Mercury and quicksilver
Dear colleagues,
Does 'quicksilver/mercury' (the liquid metal) ever get called 'Mercury' (the planet) in Sanskrit, or is this homonymy only a feature of European languages?
I ask because I am wondering whether baudha can mean 'related to quicksilver' and be a designation of mercury gilding. Apropos, does anyone known technical designations of mercury gilding in Sanskrit?
Thank you.
