[INDOLOGY] by chance, accidentally
1.  something, some event, that happened accidentally, by pure chance -
but, finally, had the power to  influence the development of the Indian
Civilization (in the spheres of thought, religion, social relations, etc.)?
and
2. Status of "(pure, sheer) chance" in Indian thought?
are entirely two different things.
#1 seems to be a question on Indian history, #2 on Indian thought.
Prof. Resnick brought yet another issue: 3. the aspect of pure chance in
ancient Sanskrit narratives.
#2 & #3 could be considered as connected.
#1 need not be connected to #2  & #3.
