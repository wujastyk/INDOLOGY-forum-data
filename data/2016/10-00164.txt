[INDOLOGY] Sexual Harassment
*and* pi??ca* ? clear cases of ?rape? in Western terms I suppose ? needed
to be transgressed that facts of rape would have been considered as
fulfilled in premodern India?
mythological to be more precise and need not necessarily correspond to any
practice any historical reality.
Real marriage practices among various castes and tribes of India have been
studied by Anthropologists both Indian and western working on Indian
society. In all these studies, each marriage type found in Indian community
is studied in comparison to the communities in other parts of the world.
Marriage by 'force' in these studies is reported from certain tribes and
the researchers take care to note that in the current practice such formats
remain to be enacted symbolically and no real 'force' is used.
