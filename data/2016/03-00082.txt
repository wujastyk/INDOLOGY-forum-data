Hello Madhav,
Thank you for this clarification; of course you're right, and for that 
reason, aju?ran is surely the best "textbook" example. At any rate, I 
took the question to be about attested forms, regardless of etymological 
correctness.
"Genuine," as you've demonstrated as much as anyone, can be problematic. 
Natural languages and orally transmitted texts evolve. If these 
instances of e.g. pari?rita? are of modern provenance, then we can 
dismiss them, but if they're not (all I can say, at least, is that they 
don't seem to be mere typos), things become more interesting: ?r and ?r 
are not ligatures that are normally confused, but in the M?dhya?dina ?B, 
we have both pari?rita? and pari?rita? attested in interspersed loci 
across the text (albeit the latter about ten times as frequently). E.g. 
10.4.3[13] tady??? pari?r?ta?. If this is some phonologically motivated 
variation, such as a misapplication of RUKI, such non-standard 
attestations have linguistic value, as they do in texts like the RV, 
which is of course replete with such variants. In this case, I don't 
know the first thing about it, but it looks interesting.
Best,
Kevin
