This may be true in some instances of cannibalism, but I don?t think it applies when someone eats the flesh of an enemy he has killed. Rather, the purpose is to inoculate the killer against the spirit of the dead person by creating a link of identity between the two, the idea being that the dead spirit would not try to harm itself. Why would you need the strength of someone you are already strong enough to kill? If that were the purpose of consuming your enemy, you might acquire the weakness he has shown by being defeated and lose the strength you already had that allowed you to prevail. In the Sangam poems, we find the ritual of the war sacrifice, in which body parts of dead enemies are ceremonially cooked (boiled), though there is no evidence that the resultant ?food? was actually eaten. And in the Kali?kattuppara?i, there are long descriptions of ghosts and macabre deities feasting on the war dead. George

In ?The Story of the Grandmother? , a folk version of ?Little Red Riding Hood? the girl eats his grandmother?s flesh and drinks her blood, which has an ambiguous purpose; she is accused of cannibalism, but a deeper implication is that she acquires the wisdom of the progenitrix which helps her trick the wolf/werewolf. This notion of ingesting the older often took the form of ritual meals. To eat a symbolical figure signified receiving magical power.?

I'm not familiar with the older texts but I do know that in places with famous burning grounds like Varanasi and Kathmandu the families guard the bodies to prevent tantriks from eating the flesh of the deceased. I have read about this in modern stories, and talked to people who have seen it. It is certainly very much still alive in the minds of modern Indians and Nepalis.
