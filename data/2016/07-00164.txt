[INDOLOGY] Sandhi breaks in longer meters
I hardly dare to comment when my teacher, Madhav Deshpande, is on this list
as well, and what little I know I know from him, but.... I recall very well
learning that external sandhi is, according to the grammarians, always
optional.
Because
One
Can
Always
Speak
Like
This
If
One
Wants
To.
In other words, the use of sandhi is a convention, so the question might be
slightly rephrased as: what are the conventions of the poets, and of the
scribes. No?
(Perhaps, as is quite likely, of course, this was implied in the question,
and I should have kept my ideas to myself.
In
Which
Case,
Sorry ;)
