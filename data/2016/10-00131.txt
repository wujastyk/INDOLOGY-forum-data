Subject: [INDOLOGY] Crypto-Hindu and crypto-Buddhist
Message-ID: <CAFZJJzHVYZOsZVP9V1o6uFwfUBdxYemnU4jNE7g+qjMLBOL6Gg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Bill,

Not only did the Vi?i???dvaitins and others refer to Advaita Ved?ntins as
crypto-Buddhists; in his ?atad??a??, Ved?nta De?ika also labelled the
Bhed?bheda Ved?ntin Bh?skara as a "Ved?ntin who smells like a Jain" (
*jainagandhived?ntin*).

I have never seen a similar term in the premodern literature for a
"crypto-Hindu." Might we find similar epithets in Jain intra-religious
polemics (perhaps a *ved?ntigandhijaina*)?
