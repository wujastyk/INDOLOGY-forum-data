Respected sir,
Thank you for your feedback.
There were two coding errors in the segment you tested.
1. When adding the upasarga to the verb form, it had set $pada to 'pada'
from 'pratyaya'. That is why there was wrong application of 'jhalAM
jazo'nte'.
2. There was a space left in between wrongly which prevented application of
'iko yaNaci' to generate 'vya....'.

Both the errors have been corrected in this commit -
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/commit/b9c68ffba015e3e425721127409f90f02d6ea2fb
.
The issue discussion was lodged at -
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues/663.

The code on live server is updated for the correction now. Press F5 to
remove any old cache.
(N.B. Now there is an option to derive Nijanta forms too - in beta mode for
testing).
