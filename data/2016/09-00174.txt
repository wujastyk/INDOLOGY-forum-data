[INDOLOGY] Hindu and Islamic Traditions in the Eighteenth Century
There is material like this one
<http://www.sutrajournal.com/vaishnava-bauls-of-birbhum-bengal-by-trishula-das>
on
Vaishnava Bauls.
This page <https://www.britannica.com/topic/eschatology> has a section
called messianism which deals with what are called as crisis cults and
mentions examples from India.
There is a huge published material in regional Indian languages on this
period (18th century)  focussing on the religious cults of the time. As a
general note, it may be said that academic material lying in here in Indian
regional languages is yet to be recognized and studied by the
academics other than those who know the languages.
