[INDOLOGY] pAnIya and buDana
Thanks for the suggestion, Walter. No, none of the six witnesses 
available to me has the form with /r/; four read /bu?ana?/vu?ana?/, 
while two read /vujhana? /(or possibly /?ujhana?/). But perhaps /bu?/vu? 
/and /bru?/vru?/ could be variant forms? (Both seem to have the meaning 
'cover'.) I confess I've never, to my recollection, come across either 
before.
