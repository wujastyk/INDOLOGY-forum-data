Subject: [INDOLOGY] suicide as a result of love

Dear Dermot and all,

The story of the ?Weaver as Vi??u? occurs indeed in P?rnabhadra?s recension
of the Pata?catntra as well as in the exemplar of this recension, the
so-called *textus simplicior*. P?rnabhadra censored the narrative strongly
from the perspective of conservative sm?rta-Hinduism and left out the
motive of suicide out of desire for the princess, which, accordingly only
occurs in the *textus simplicior*.



For a more comprehensive analysis of the two versions of the narrative see
my ?On Discourses of Dharma and the Pa?catantra.? *Wiener Zeitschrift f?r
die Kunde S?dasiens* 55 (2013-2014), p. 5-31, of which you find a pre-print
draft version here

.



Best wishes,



Philipp
