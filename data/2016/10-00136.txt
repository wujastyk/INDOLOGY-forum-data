[INDOLOGY] Questions on two citations from Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary
Citation 1: [L=238711

] *sarvavid* f. the sacred syllable Om L.
Firstly, the gender appears to be suspicious. Most names for monosyllable
Om that I have come across are either masculine (pra?ava?, o?k?ra?, udg?tha?
, etc.) or neuter (ek?k?aram, brahm?k?aram, etc).
Anyway, my question is that which lexicon (the abbreviation L.=
Lexicographers, esp. such as ???????, ??????, ?????????, &c.) gives the
meaning of Om for the word ?sarvavid??
Citation 2: [L=175517

] *rasa* N. of the sacred syllable, ?Om,? S3a1n3khGr2.
Where in ????????-?????-????? is the word ?rasa? used for Om? I searched in
the digital version of Bloomfield?s Concordance but did not find it.
