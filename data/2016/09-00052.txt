[INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks
There is also the issue of translation into other languages from English. Lack of diacritics will cause major problems. An example is how the name of the current Indian Prime Minister is rendered in many Tamil publications. He is called ???????? ???? (Nar?ndira M??i)!
