*International Workshop on Tantric Studies*

*Manipal, India*


*January 23-27, 2017*


Organized by

Centre for Religious Studies

Manipal Centre for Philosophy and Humanities

Manipal University, Manipal, India



*CALL FOR PARTICIPATION*



Centre for Religious Studies invites applications for a week-long *Workshop
on Tantric Studies* from January 23-27, 2017 in Manipal.


*About the Workshop*


The workshop will principally include a close textual reading of selections
from various ?aiva Tantric scriptures each followed by various
contributions and discussions. We will read the extracts from the following
texts:



   - ? *Ratnatrayapar?k??* of ?r?ka??ha with the anonymous commentary kept
   in the Oriental Library of Mysore (MS Orlas P 269)

(session headed by Prof Francesco Sferra)



   - ? *Sarvaj??nottara* with Aghora?iva?s commentary

(session headed by Prof Dominic Goodall)



   - ? *Mok?ak?rik?* with the v?tti of R?maka??ha

(session headed by Dr Hugo David)


The aim is to examine tantric scriptural and post-scriptural literature,
much of which is unpublished or must be studied using numerous
manuscripts.  The *Ratnatrayapar?k??* is a ninth-century Kashmirian work in
over 300 stanzas that deals at length with all manner of tantric notions
connected with sound, language and sonic creation. A short commentary by
the famous twelfth-century South Indian theologian Aghora?iva has been
published, but large fragments of what seems to be an older, more
exploratory and theologically intriguing commentary of unknown authorship
survive in a manuscript in Mysore.  The *Sarvaj??nottara* is a non-dualist
tantra that survives in a fragmentary ninth-century codex from Nepal, as
well as in many damaged South Indian manuscripts. Its text can only fully
be reconstructed, however, with the additional help of Aghora?iva's dualist
commentary, a further interest of which is that it consistently subverts
the text's non-dualism by ingenious distortions. The *Mok?ak?rik?* is a
work on liberation by the earliest tantric theologian of whom works are
known to survive, Sadyojoti? (c. 675?725). A tenth-century commentary by
the Kashmirian thinker Bha??a R?maka??ha has been published, but a recourse
to manuscripts reveals that it can be improved on every page.
