Subject: [INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock

Dear Colleagues,

I could not agree more with Dr. Nityananda Misra's concluding statement: "As
I see it, both petitions are rooted more in strong differences of
opinion/ideology than in misunderstanding or wilful
misconstrual/misrepresentation."
 This ideological divide is now at the boiling point, but the first time I
came face to face with it was in 1965 in Pune.  There was a Pandit Sabha in
which some leading Pandits were discussing some grammatical point, citing
the authority of Pata?jali.  My teacher, Professor S.D. Joshi was in the
audience and wanted to make a comment that disagreed with Pata?jali's
views.  The Pandits told him that he could not participate in the
discussion, unless he first accepted the supreme authority of Pata?jali.
Professor Joshi sat down, without being allowed to speak at this event.  I
don't know where the current "Battle for Sanskrit" will end up, but it
clearly has very deep roots.
