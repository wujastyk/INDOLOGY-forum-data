[INDOLOGY] CORRECTION Re: ISO transliteration standard for devanagari (Harry Spier)
Dear Camillo,
Thank you for your comments.  As you pointed out the standard is not
available on-line and needs to be purchased.  It is $170.00 US and so I
doubt very many sanskritists will purchase it.
Thank you,
Harry Spier
