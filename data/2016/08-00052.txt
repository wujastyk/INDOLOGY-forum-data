Sounds dubious, for how the *d* of *vid* would change to *t *when followed
by a vowel is beyond me. Here is the authentic traditional etymology:
v? gativy?ptiprajanak?ntyasanakh?dane?u (DP 1048) ? v?patibhy?? tanan (US
3.150) ? v? + tanan ? halantyam (A 1.3.3), tasya lopa? (A 1.3.9) ? v? +
tana ? s?rvadh?tuk?rdhadh?tukayo? (A 7.3.84) ? ve tana ? vetana.
The U??dis?tra *v?patibhy?? tanan* (US 3.150) ordains the suffix *tanan*
(of which only *tana* remains) from the root *v?
gativy?ptiprajanak?ntyasanakh?dane?u*? which is used in the meanings of
*gati* (movement), *vy?pti* (pervading), *prajana* (conception), *k?nti*
(desire), *asana* (throwing), and *kh?dana* (eating). The rule
s?rvadh?tuk?rdhadh?tukayo? (A 7.3.84) results in the ?v?? ? ve
transformation to get ?vetana?.
The word occurs in Amarako?a 2.10.38, and the various commentaries on it
may be consulted. Both the *Udgh??ana* and *Vy?khy?sudh?* commentaries cite
US 3.150 and explain the word as *v?yate anena iti vetanam*. The form
*v?yate* is the passive (*yaki*, or *karma?i*) form of the root *v?* whose
active (*karttari*) form is *veti*. The meaning of *v?yate anena iti
vetanam*, consequently, is ?that with which [something] is obtained is
vetana?. Roots with the meaning ?to go? also have the meaning ?to obtain?
as per the maxim *ye gatyarth?ste pr?ptyarth??*.
