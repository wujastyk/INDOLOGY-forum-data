Pata?jali says who he means by ??vara in the next s?tra:
*??kle?akarmavip?k??ayair apar?m???a? puru?avi?e?a ??vara?* (YS 1.24) and
unpacks this in his subsequent remarks

?  The discussion of the *?a?karavivara?a* on this point is lucidly
translated and discussed in Harimoto, *God, Reason and Yoga*, 89 ff.?

view that the entire Vedanta corpus (ved?nte?u) proclaims Siva to be the
highest Reality (puru?a) that pervades all the universe.  Kalidasa and
Patanjali definitely belong to very early period. Thus by ??v?ra-pra?idh?na

of Siva. And, worshipping a supreme God need not be interpreted as
''sectarian''. One cannot ''worship'' a supreme reality which is nirguna.
variations on the concept of yama/niyama in Puranas and later Yogic texts,
it is most interesting.
different stages in Kau??inya's theory is quite interesting. Kau??inya
himself considers it a peculiar trait of the system, or scripture
("tantra"). At the same time, a similar differentiation of niyama rules
seems to be accepted by some early Naiy?yikas, who otherwise seem to follow
quite closely the theory of Pata?jali (with regard to the practice of Yoga).
authors at some point, this idea of differentiation of niyamas is hinted at
even in V?tsy?yana's Bh??ya--which was written too early to speak about
P??upata influence, I think. Hence the search for other possible sources of
this peculiar variation.

P??upata yoga traditions.

as Sv?tm?r?ma?s Ha?haprad?pik? (although a later 10-chapter version of this
text does include yamas and niyamas), and thus we are left to speculate on
their optionality. Perhaps they were left to be filled in by a guru, or
elsewhere from a sectarian tradition, or were in fact left out of yogic
praxis entirely (although I doubt this). But I think it?s safe to say if
they are included in a prescriptive yoga text, they were not considered
optional for that author, but rather par for the course. This is most clear
in the PY? and its commentaries, as Prof. Bryant astutely notes, but I
think also holds for the later medieval texts as well.
