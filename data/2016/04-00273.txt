[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Textbook Formation
Dear Jarrod,
One possible source is Stephen G. Alter, *William Dwight Whitney and the
Science of Language* (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005).
There are some notes on Sanskrit pedagogy in the West scattered through
Radhavallabh Tripathi, ed., ??????????????????: *Sixty Years of Sanskrit
Studies, Vol. 2* (New Delhi: Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, 2012).
Regards,
Anand
