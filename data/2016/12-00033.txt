*Praise for the book*

*?**Following the great classical Sanskrit poets who incorporated a citra
(specialized geometric forms of wording) section in epics like
?i?up?lavadha and Nai?adh?yacarita, Dr. Shankar Rajaraman has composed the
beautiful Citranai?adham, not only retelling the classical story of Nala
and Damayant?, but also displaying his poetic prowess through the use of
yamaka and gom?trik?bandha forms in his poetic narration. I congratulate
him, and hope that he will continue producing more such beautiful poetic
creations.?*
