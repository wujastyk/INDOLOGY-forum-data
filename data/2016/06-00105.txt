[INDOLOGY] Jati as Caste in Nyaya?
I do not have all my references at hand while traveling, but the discussion of br?hma?yam that begins at line 18 on page 767 of prabh?candra?s ny?yakumudacandra? should be of some interest.  I do not remember clearly, but there may be a similar discussion in abhayadevas?ri?s tattvabodhavidh?yin?.
