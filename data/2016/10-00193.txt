There is an idiom in Hindi: ??? ?? ????? ???? (n?ka para um?gal? rakhan?).
I do not have my Hindi Muhavara Kosh with me now, but I have heard the
idiom being used in Hindi to convey a feminine gesture of embarrassment,
bashfulness, or no longer being able to remain angry [at somebody or
something] upon realizing something.
Wiktionary lists the meaning of this idiom from an unnamed dictionary under
https://hi.wiktionary.org/wiki/??? as
??? ?? ????? ???? ??? ???? = ????? ?? ??? ??? ????
While the Chambers English Hindi Dictionary gives ??? ?? ????? ???? as the
idiomatic translation of *make a long nose* [?]
