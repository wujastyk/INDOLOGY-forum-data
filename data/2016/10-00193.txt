Not a definitive answer, but some pointers which may help.

Compare the use of *n?s?gr?rpitatarjjan?* in the following verse from
Prabodh?nanda Sarasvat??s *V?nd?vanamahim?m?tam* (15.33)

*mithy?v?din? ki? mudh? pralapasi pratyak?ametatkatha? sakhya? pa?yata ki?
tad?ha yadiya? ki?v??haha s? p?cchyat?m*
*eva? satyamida? katha? prakupit?syeva? sakh?n?? gir? n?s?gr?rpitatarjjan?
kamahasadr?dh? ?ira?kampin?*

There is an idiom in Hindi: ??? ?? ????? ???? (n?ka para um?gal? rakhan?).
I do not have my Hindi Muhavara Kosh with me now, but I have heard the
idiom being used in Hindi to convey a feminine gesture of embarrassment,
bashfulness, or no longer being able to remain angry [at somebody or
something] upon realizing something.

Wiktionary lists the meaning of this idiom from an unnamed dictionary under
https://hi.wiktionary.org/wiki/??? as
??? ?? ????? ???? ??? ???? = ????? ?? ??? ??? ????

While the Chambers English Hindi Dictionary gives ??? ?? ????? ???? as the
idiomatic translation of *make a long nose* [?]

PS: The comment by Vi?van?tha Cakravartin is also to be found in Va???dhara
*Bh?v?rthad?pik?prak??a*: *vilokya v?matarjjany? n?s?gra? sp???veti bh?va?*
