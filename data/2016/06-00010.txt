 Dear colleagues and friends,
  
 on behalf of the board of the European Association of Asian
 Art and Archaeology (EAAA), I am happy to announce the
  
 Second EAAA conference in Zurich: 24.-27. August 2017.
  
 The date was chosen so as not to coincide with the scheduled
 15th EAJS conference, which takes place from 30. August - 2.
 September in Lisbon, Portugal (http://www.eajs.eu/?id=305). For anyone traveling from
 afar, it might even make sense to combine the two events.
  
 Timeline:
 30. June 2016: official call for papers
 15. November 2016: Submission of panel and paper proposals
  
 28. February 2017: Notification of acceptance
 31. March 2017: early bird registration deadline
 31. May 2017: conference program published
  
 Abstracts:
 follow the AAS standard: 250 words for both panel proposal,
 and paper abstracts
  
 Membership:
 A membership of EAAA is a prerequisite for panel and paper
 applications ?
 annual membership fees are a mere 30 ?, or 10 ? for
 students, and we welcome donations!: http://www.ea-aaa.eu/members
  
 For more information on the EAAA and its conference, visit:
 http://www.ea-aaa.eu
 In case you have any questions, please contact: info at ea-aaa.eu
  
 We look forward to receiving your abstracts and panel
 proposals and to welcoming you to Zurich!
  
 On behalf of the EAAA board, I wish you all the best
 and hope for your participation in the Second EAAA
 conference,
 
 Julia Hegewald.
