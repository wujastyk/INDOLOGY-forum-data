[INDOLOGY] National Museum of Nepal
Dear Jacob,
Right the moment the main National Museum in  Chauni is probably busy with
Earthquake  damage. I have heard nothing about either the painting museum
or the wood museum.
Fortunately for you I have rather extensive photographs from both the
Chauni including the Buddhist wing, The bronze Museum in Patan and the
Painting museum and a few from the wood museum both in Bhaktapur.  If you
let me know what you are looking for perhaps I can help.
