[INDOLOGY] Two terms
Dear Madhav,
The PTS,s Pali-English Dict.:
*V??a* - [cp. late Sk. vy??a, see Geiger, *P. Gr*. ? 54?] I. a snake Vism
312 (so read for *va?a*).- 2. a beast of prey [...] *v??a-miga*, a beast of
prey, predaceous animal, like tiger, leopard, etc. [...]
When in search for the Elixir of immortality Garuda enters the underworld,
he kills *two serpents* hidden under the [eternally] revolving wheel. (Mbh.
I, 29. 3-9).
When the relics of the Buddha are hidden by Ajatasattu in the underground
chamber, Vissakamma places over them, for their defence the [eternally]
revolving *v??a?sa?gh??a?yanta.*
If *v??a* would mean "snake, serpent", then this could be one of the tropes
linking both the narrations.
*Yanta *means "contrivance, artifice, instrument, machine, mechanism" - in
what way could it be constructed/pegged together - using serpents? Ataching
it to serpents? Giving it a serpentine look?
