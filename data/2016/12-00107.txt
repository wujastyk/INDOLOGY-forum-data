Dear Dominik,
On *prasa?khy?na*, there is also this article:
"On *prasa**?khy?na* and *parisa**?khy?na*: Meditation in Advaita Ved?nta,
Yoga and Pre-?a?karan Ved?nta," by Vidyasankar Sundaresan. Adyar Library
Bulletin, vol. 62, 1998, pp. 51-89.
I do not know if it is available online, but if not, I can easily post a
scan of my photocopy of it.
I do not have the article that you listed, and was not aware of it. Thanks.
Best regards,
David Reigle
