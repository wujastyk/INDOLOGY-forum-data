Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tattvabodhini sansknet files
Message-ID: <CADSGPzXUXKP3YymOdNbPSSW70DL+NFGoioXn_trVVpeXf-fb_w@mail.gmail.com>

Respected scholars, I am looking for tattvabodhini commentary on pAda 6.2
digitized by sansknet project. I have rest of the commentary. This pAda is
missing. If someone has an older copy of this pAda downloaded from sansknet
site, please share it. It would make the commentary complete.
Thanks
