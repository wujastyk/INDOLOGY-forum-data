[INDOLOGY] learning material for Sanskrit in Braille
Dear Dr. Oberlin,
I don't know of the advancement in Braille, but I taught Sanskrit to a
blind student who used a voice recognition system that enunciated what he
typed and read in plain text. It was not advanced enough to recognize
diacritical marks, but there was a slight but recognizable difference in
the intonation between upper-case and lower-case letters. Thus we used the
Harvard-Kyoto transliteration scheme to develop an archive of notes
(paradigms, forms, etc.) and exercises.
Regards,
Anand
