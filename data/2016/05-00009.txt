[INDOLOGY] Literature on ISKCON
Malcolm Haddon's 2004 PhD thesis "The Nectar of Translation: Conversion, Mimesis and Cultural Translation in Krishna Consciousness" is well worth reading (Macquarie University, Sydney). It can be downloaded from the Macquarie University Library site (http://www.mq.edu.au/about/campus-services-and-facilities/library)<http://multisearch.mq.edu.au/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do;jsessionid=0DA8F8AA642C0AEEEBAB853A77732984?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=TN_trovemq_6252&indx=1&recIds=TN_trovemq_6252&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&loc=adaptor%2Cscope%3A%28%22MQ%22%29%2Cscope%3A%28reserve%29%2Cscope%3A%28exam%29%2Cprimo_central_multiple_fe&pcAvailabiltyMode=false&query=any%2Ccontains%2CHaddon+nectar&dscnt=0&scp.scps=scope%3A%28%22MQ%22%29%2Cscope%3A%28reserve%29%2Cscope%3A%28exam%29%2Cprimo_central_multiple_fe&multisearch_submit=Submit&vid=MQ&institution=MQ&bulkSize=20&tab=books_more&vl%2877850891UI0%29=any&multisearch_input=Haddon+nectar&vl%28freeText0%29=Haddon%20nectar&dstmp=1462134828373>

The Journal of Vaishnava Studies largely consists of articles by past or present ISKCON members but it contains many articles of a good academic standard.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Literature on ISKCON
For a start, pl advise your student to see the (early) publications of Prof. Rahul Peter Das ( Institut fuer Indologie und S?dasienwissenschaften, Martin-Luther-Universitaet Halle-Wittenberg, 06099 Halle, Germany). He probably has a website.

A student of mine is writing a term paper on ISKCON ("The Hare Krishna Movement"). Could you please kindly recommend reliable sources (books or articles) on this organization, its demographics, economics, belief system and practices? Sources treating this subject from a comparative perspective would also be very welcome.
