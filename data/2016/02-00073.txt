[INDOLOGY] 600 (and 1000)
Thanks for the information! This is very interesting for me since I?m currently trying to understand the earliest available attestations of coding and decoding ancient Tamil numerals and counting system.
However, I?m not able to decipher the attached image ? how 100 and 6 are represented? Is there a chart which specifies equating individual signs, symbols, and numerals?
Thanks and regards,
rajam
