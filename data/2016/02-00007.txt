 From Simon Winchester, /The Professor and the Madman/ (about the 
history of the Oxford English Dictionary), p. 109:

And Herbert Coleridge's early death slowed matters down even more. He 
died after only two years at work, at the age of thirty-one, not even 
halfway through looking at the quotations of words beginning with A. He 
had been caught in the rain on the way to a Philological Society 
lecture, and he had sat through it in the unheated upstairs room on St. 
James's Square, caught a chill, and died. His last recorded words were: 
"I must begin Sanskrit tomorrow."

Stay dry, fellow Sanskritists, stay dry.
