[INDOLOGY] glass in ancient India
I just went through this publication:
S. N. Sen and Mamata Chaudhuri: Ancient Glass and India, New Delhi: Indian National Science Academy, 1985 (available from DLI).
The authors discuss many archaeological findings of different glass objects (including flasks and bottles) and from my quick reading it seems that all ancient flasks and bottles found in India are of foreign origin.
So it is highly probable that the technology of producing glass bottles is rather a latecomer in India.
Best,
Lubomir
