Dear list members,

Another sun of Sanskrit grammar has set. Popularly referred to as
*Vaiy?kara?am?rta??a*, Acharya Vishwanath Mishra?one of the tallest
scholars of Sanskrit grammar?passed away around 6 a.m. India time on the
morning of January 28 2016.

Born on June 15 1930 at Siwan in Bihar, Acharya Mishra studied major works
of Sanskrit grammar, starting with *Siddh?ntakaumud?*, under ?Mahashaya Ji?
Ram Yash Tripathi (1884?1966) in Varanasi for eleven years. He also studied
the *Rasaga?gadhara* and the *Pa?calak?a?i* from Mahashaya Ji. His other
Guru-s included Pandit Badrinath Shukla.

Acharya Mishra taught at Daltonganj in Ranchi for three years, and then at
various colleges and universities in Rajasthan. Bikaner was his home for a
long time. In his final days, he taught at the Jain Vishvabharati at Nagaur
in Rajasthan.

In 1980, Acharya Mishra?s Hindi commentary *Subodhin?* on the
*Paribh??endu?ekhara* was published by Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan. It is
widely considered to be the best Hindi explanation of the
*Paribh??endu?ekhara*. In 1997, his Hindi commentary *Subodhin?* on the
*Laghu?abdendu?ekhara* (up to the *Pa?casandhi*) was published by
Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan. This book was dedicated to
*Abhinava?a?kar?c?rya* ?Dharmasamr??? Sv?m? Karapatr? (1907?1982) and has
been reprinted several times. Two other well-known works of Acharya Mishra
are the *Praudhanibandhasaurabham* (1982) and the *Bhik?uny?yakar?ik?*. In
all he authored seven books and more than fifty papers. When the
commentaries on the *Paribh??endu?ekhara *and the *Laghu?abdendu?ekhara *were
presented by Acharya Mishra to my Guru, Jagadguru Sv?m? R?mabhadrac?rya, he
remarked to those present, ?You give me material things, today Mishra Ji
has given me invaluable and hard-to-find  knowledge,? and placed the two
books on his head as a mark of respect to Acharya Mishra.

For his services to Sanskrit, Acharya Mishra was honoured with the
President?s Certificate of Honour for the year 1999. The honour was
presented to him by the then President of India Honourable K. R. Narayanan
on February 6 2002.

Several students of Acharya Mishra are scholars of Sanskrit grammar today.
Prof. Ramyatna Shukla of Varanasasi briefly studied under Acharya Mishra.
