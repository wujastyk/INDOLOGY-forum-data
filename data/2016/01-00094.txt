Dear Colleagues

I thought I had sent this to the list yesterday, but as it has not appeared there and there is no trace of it on my computer, I think that something may have gone wrong. Apologies if anyone has received it twice. 

Please send offers of papers or enquiries to Dr Suthren Hirst, not to me.

STIMW offers a forum for the discussion of papers on varied aspects of Indian religions. Papers have been presented by leading scholars in the field as well as by research students.  Papers are sent to participants in advance, so that they can be read and discussed in detail.  They are available to those who cannot attend for a small charge.  

For further details, see http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/stimw <http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/stimw>
