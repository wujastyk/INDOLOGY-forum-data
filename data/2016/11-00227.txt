[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
Semantic change of Vedic words such as Yajna is well known. The word Yajna
underwent a semantic expansion to cover pa?cha mah? yaj?as etc.
The word v?da itself underwent a semantic expansion to come to mean
something like a field of knowledge : The use of the words such as ?yurv?da
is part of such a development. The concept of upav?da connected these
fields of knowledge to the v?das .
