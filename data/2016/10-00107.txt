I believe that Clementin is no doubt correct in seeing the issue as connected with taboos on diet (and alsomingling with outsiders and their custom). Perhaps it originates with the old notions such as that of Manusm?ti 2.22 etc. of the ?ryavarta bounded east and west by the oceans as the  (only) suitable homeland for the ?Aryas.? Then too one sees in the 19th century such issues as Indian troops in the company army, many of whom were brahmans, being aggrieved at being made to fight in Burma. But this issue  also affected non-brahman higher caste groups  as we see from Gandhi?s account of the concern of his caste fellows about his voyage to England and the ??uddhi? he had to undergo on his return.
