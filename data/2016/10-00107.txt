I believe that Clementin is no doubt correct in seeing the issue as connected with taboos on diet (and alsomingling with outsiders and their custom). Perhaps it originates with the old notions such as that of Manusm?ti 2.22 etc. of the ?ryavarta bounded east and west by the oceans as the  (only) suitable homeland for the ?Aryas.? Then too one sees in the 19th century such issues as Indian troops in the company army, many of whom were brahmans, being aggrieved at being made to fight in Burma. But this issue  also affected non-brahman higher caste groups  as we see from Gandhi?s account of the concern of his caste fellows about his voyage to England and the ??uddhi? he had to undergo on his return.

> The taboo on crossing the ocean was essentially a 19th century social issue, but it does not mean it was not found earlier. The main problem was not so much the crossing per se but the fact that on board one could not follow food regulations. By crossing the sea therefore, one ran the risk of losing one's caste. But again this was an  issue only for those who came back to India, not for those who stayed abroad and outside Hindu society.

> Yes, 'Ocean' has often been used in Ancient Indian texts. The probable reason may be to relate the vastness of our life ,with its myriad of complexities. to the vastness of an ocean. This perhaps is relevant, since the ultimate aim of our life,according to our ancient Indian philosophy ,is to attain enlightenment in life,and thereby bypass all mundane problems ,by way of Realisation of our Self ( i.e.Atmana) .
