[INDOLOGY] glass in ancient India
Hi Ken,
Well, ??rngadharasa?hit? 2.12.31 and  2, 12, 241 mention a "k?cak?p?", so I
think in that case it probably is a glass bottle. That is, a glass bottle
covered in cloth soaked in mud. 2,12, 241 also mentions a "k?cabh???a",
which might not mean a bottle. In other cases, in which a k?p? is
mentioned, it is not clear whether it might not be a clay vessel.
Certainly, the way these procedures are done today involve glass bottles.
See for example, here
