I could not trace the meaning ?sacrifice? anywhere in Boethlingk. He
himself presumed that *ya??i* might be an error for the correct word
formation *i??i* (in the text available to him at the time). Later, in his
second Petrograde Dictionary (pw) he explicitly points to the  erroneous
reading of *ya??i *by stating "richtig" ("correct") is *i??i*.
PW
2. *ya??i* f.  nom. act. von 1. *yaj*  P. 3, 3, 110, Sch.  wohl fehlerhaft
f?r *i??i*.
(MW?s translation)
sacrificing P??.  3-3, 110 Sch. (prob. w.r. for i??i).
(pw)
2. *ya??i*  f. Nom. act. von 1. *yaj*. Richtig *i??i*.
*ya??i *in the meaning of sacrifice was however recorded by Edgerton in
Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit usage:
(Edgerton)
1. *ya??i* f. sacrifice. Mvu iii.145.20; (= Skt *i??i*)
