[INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock
could
I have met (where?) some time ago  with a peculiar definition of Sanskrit.
According to it Sanskrit is Amrita. Not "*is like* Amrita", it *is* Amrita.
Would anyone in their sound mind want to change the composition of the
drink of immortality?
