[INDOLOGY] External Origin of Dravidian
'neighbour, neighbourhood' etc. which can possibly be argued as recent
borrowings from Kannada or Tamil.
and/or Tamil.
There are a few other such instances where a certain root may not be found
in its basic verb root form in Telugu may be found in its secondary verb
root forms or other such derivatives forms as nominalizations. One such is
pa? = to do. In Telugu it is found in its causative form panucu/pa?cu,
nominalized
form pani but not in its basic verb form as in Tamil.
The words *??**vu* (????), *??**va?u* (?????), *??**vadi* (?????) etc. are
not derived from  'iravu' (<ir-) (note the alveolar trill, instead of
tap). They
are related to *[DEDR 516]*  *i?-/i?- 'to descend', 'to go beyond' *i?a?ku*
(*i?a?ki*-) to descend, alight, fall (as rain), disembark; *i?a?kal* place
of descent, of debarkation etc.
The usages of ???? r?vu are more with ?? than with ?? . Is not "*i?-/i?-
'to descend', 'to go beyond' *i?a?ku* (*i?a?ki*-) to descend, alight, fall
(as rain), disembark; *i?a?kal* place of descent, of debarkation etc." all
from the tracing to Tamil ? Do we have *i?-/i?- 'to descend', 'to go
beyond' *i?a?ku* (*i?a?ki*-) to descend, alight, fall (as rain), disembark;
*i?a?kal* place of descent, of debarkation etc in Telugu? ( ????? r?va?i is
as in ren?iki ce??a r?va?i )

choosing the most plausible root of phonetic change from among those
required to account for all the available forms. I thought, otherwise,
identifying any non-Tamil language as retaining the Protodravidian
features/elements would not have been possible. But if it can be proved
that 'Dravidian linguists have been wrongly reconstructing words and
features found only in South Dravidian (esp. Tamil) to the parent language
under the assumption that Tamil represents the archaic form of Dravidian' , it
will be a path-breaking critique of the current methods of historical
linguistics. Now that the likes of Prof. Hans Henrich Hock started to extend
the argument to IE studies too, it may pave way for a revamp of the
existing methods of historical linguistics. Any such change is certainly
welcome.
considering the possibility of pre-Dravidian substrata in various branches
of the Dravidian languages.
beginnings of Dravidian linguistics, though no systematic study ever took
off. With you there seems to be promise of such a work in near future.
Dravidian would be a starting point in this endeavour.
required. But I don't think pre-Dravidian substrata issue need not be based
on the Tamil issue. Des'ya components of various members of Dravidian
family that can not be explained by the Dravidian model are what lead to
pre-Dravidian substrata.
