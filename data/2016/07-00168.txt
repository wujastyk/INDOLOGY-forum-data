Subject: [INDOLOGY] reviews of Malhotra's books
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CczACBQ4Z6iUe6RXcgz=O05O=cer8HizwvDvCQ7qjFh4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Is someone collecting a bibliography of serious reviews of Rajiv Malhotra's
books?  Are there considered writings that could be relayed to someone
interested in reasoned, academic responses to Malhotra's views?

Best,
Dominik
