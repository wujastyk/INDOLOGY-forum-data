1. Maanasa is the name of a goddess worshipped in the form of a snake , the
cult prevalent in Bengal, some parts of the north-east India and Nepal.
Maanasaahi can be maanasa + ahi

2. Maan + s'aah can be the king by name Maan . But Maans'aahi derived from
this should mean kinghood of a person/ dynasty by name s'aah.
