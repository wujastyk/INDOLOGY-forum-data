For patterns in the archaeological landscape across space and time at Sanchi and surrounding area, you might want to have a look at detailed discussion with accompanying data and maps (including later history of Buddhism and relationship with broader cultic geographies) in:

Shaw, J. (2007). Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi hill and archaeologies of religious and social change, c. 3rd century BC to 5th century AD..<https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/publication/58687/1> London: British Association for South Asian Studies (British Academy); Leftcoast Press.



I can send you some PDF material if you want to email me directly.

Dear List,
Can any one refer me to a comprehensive discussion of the archaeological
evidence of the destruction/appropriation of Buddhist monasteries and other
religious establishments in pre-Islamic period?...Any thing beyond the
writings of Richard Davis and Richard Eaton!
