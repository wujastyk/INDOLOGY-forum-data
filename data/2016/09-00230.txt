Dear Friends,

I find myself intrigued by the idea that there are people today compelled
to carry on the karmak???a rituals.

I read a brief passage that alludes to the m?m??s? thought-world as
providing textual evidence and injunctions for this practice of reenacting
scriptural commandments, which were originally meant for a group of people
in a different time and place. However, it only mentions m?m??s? and does
not mention any specific author or text.

I would like to read this text but, as I know very little about m?m??s? I
do not really know where to start. I thought I might find some help here in
locating the passages I seek.

Thank you for your help.


All the best,
