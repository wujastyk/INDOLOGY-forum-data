[INDOLOGY] capital punishment
Itu??nala, tu??gni, etc. (with other synonyms of agni appearing as the second member of the compound) occur in the story about Dharma-k?rti/a Buddhist teacher and Kum?rila. It does refer to a capital punishment but to a self-inflicted capital punishment ? a pr?ya?citta in which the repentant person chooses to die in a slow-burning fire to atone for what he considers to be a grave sin. A reference exists in one of the ?a?kara/???kara-vijayas/digvijayas. (I cannot give you a precise reference at present because I am away from my personal library.) The context is one in which the great Advaitin teacher ?a?kara wishes to debate with the great M?m??saka Kum?rila. However, when ?a?kara approaches Kum?rila, he finds him self-immolating in tu?a fire. guru-droha or a Vaidika?s studying with a Buddhist is usually given as the reason behind Kum?rila?s choosing to die in a very painful way.
