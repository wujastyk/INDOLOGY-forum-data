[INDOLOGY] bhakti/Vedic astrology
Luis and Martin,
That was just a model of solution I was trying to offer to get out of this
'problematic' (?) word 'Vedic' in the name of Vedic Astrology. My point was
that some method indicating name might solve the problem of source-claims.
Also, even if some such solution is ironed out, languages and names in them
are such tricky entities that they may not come fully under the control of
a group of scholars.
Best,
-N
