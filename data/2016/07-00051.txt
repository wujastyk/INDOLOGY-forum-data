[INDOLOGY] glass in ancient India
Wilhelm Rau has a short article on glass in ancient India. I do not have the reference on hand, but it might be obtainable in the appended bibliography from the Festschrift W. Rau...1987, there may be also recent updates of the bibliography. Cannot recall whether there was any mention of glass bottles and such. FYI.
