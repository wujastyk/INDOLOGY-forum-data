[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Textbook Formation
Dear Jarrod,
Iwona Milewska (Institute of Oriental Philology, Jagiellonian Univ., Al. Mickiewicza 9/11, 31-120 Krakow, Poland) has written a Ph.D. dissertation on Western Sanskrit textbooks. I will send you her email privately. I hope it still works.
Best wishes.
