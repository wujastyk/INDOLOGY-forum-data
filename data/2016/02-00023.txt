[INDOLOGY] Iraka?
In the astrological work /T?jikamukt?vali /by Tuka (1.41) there is a 
compound /kh?bdh?rakebhya? /which, from the context, has to mean 'from 
forty and ten, [respectively]'. This is supported by the explicatory 
numerals inserted by several mss: /kh?bdh? 40 rakebhya? 10/, etc; but I 
haven't found anything like /iraka/?raka/ in any dictionary or list of 
/bh?tasa?khy? /numerals. (Some mss emend to /-?khakebhya?/, which 
doesn't really help.) If anyone has come across this way of expressing 
the value 10 elsewhere, I'd be grateful for a reference, and even more 
so for an explanation of the word.
