as early as the Br?hma?as, given the conception of the earth prevailing at
their time. "Terrestrial" is how I had understood your citation of the word
?equator?
?emphasized by quotation marks, but perhaps mistakenly as it appears now.
A comparison of the Sanskrit text:
*ekavi??am etad ahar upayanti vi?uvantam madhye sa?vatsarasyai*
to Haug?s translation of AB 4.18:
?They perform the ceremonies of the Ekavi??a day, which is the *equator*,
dividing the year (into two equal parts)?
shows that the term he had translated by ?equator? was *vi?uvant*, which
(apparently in post-Vedic literature only) can also mean ?equinox?. What
Haug himself had actually had in mind by using ?equator? becomes however
clear from his introduction (on p. 46f), where he explains the calculation
of the annual Sattra calendar ? incidentally in the context of ?the sun?s
northern and southern progress? (*ayana*s) ? as follows: ?They? [the
Sattras, W.S.] ?were divided into two distinct parts, each consisting of
six months each; in the midst of both was the *Vishuvan*, i.e. *equator *or*
central day*, *cutting the whole Sattra into two halves*.?
Keith, in contrast, translates: ?They perform the Ekavi??a day, the
Vi?uvant, in the middle of the year.?
So much for the background as it relates to Haug
??
