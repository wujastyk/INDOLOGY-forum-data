[INDOLOGY] J?ti as Caste in Ny?ya?
Many thanks to the originator of this thread!
Right now, I just want to register the fact that I?m very much interested in this topic.
Last year (May 2015), I had a publication (in Tamil) about references to, or a lack there of, ?j?ti? and ?caste? (as we understand it today) in Old Tamil literature/grammar, also known as Sangam literature/grammar.
I don?t know how many of you are aware of the fact that the English word ?caste? has its origin in the Portuguese word ?casta,? which was first recorded in Arte da Lingua Malabar written by Fr. Henrique Henriques in the mid-16th century. 
If one wants to dig deep into the understanding of the terms such as ?j?ti? and ?caste? ? one has to have a minimal understanding of the origins of the Western contact with India, which happened in the early 16-th century through Portuguese arrival in South India.
Thanks and regards,
