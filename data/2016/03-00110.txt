[INDOLOGY] A font for accented Vedic
George,
Andrew Glass?s Gandhari Unicode includes the Vedic accented transliteration characters ? I have used these for years:

If you use a Mac, you can also find a link to my customized keylayout file, and a keyboard map here (it includes characters for Tamil and Old Javanese as well):

[INDOLOGY] A font for accented Vedic
Dear List,
.
For the time being, I am obliged to use a computer that does not have  a font for accented Vedic text in transliteration.  Can someone send me such a font so that I can submit a paper before an upcoming deadline?  I would be very, very grateful.
With thanks in advance,
George Thompson
