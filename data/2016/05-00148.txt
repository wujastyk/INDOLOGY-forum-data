A bit of self-promotion, but I thought the information might be useful:
THE LANGUAGES AND LINGUISTICS OF SOUTH ASIA: A Comprehensive Guide, ed. by Hans Henrich Hock and Elena Bashir. (The World of Linguistics, 7.) Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter Mouton. pp. x, 917. May 2016 (http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/429184)
All the best,
