[INDOLOGY] Meru, the Sanskrit-speaking crocodile
Here is the next generation of Sanskrit-lovers in my family.  My grandson,
Meru (7 years old), is acting today as a Sanskrit-speaking crocodile in a
drama organized by the Palo Alto (California) branch of Samskrita Bharati.
I hopes he keeps up his interest.  He can have my Sanskrit library.
