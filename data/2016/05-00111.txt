[INDOLOGY] by chance, accidentally
3. the aspect of pure chance in ancient Sanskrit narratives.
Mrichchhakatika is where the author clearly mentions bhavitavyataa as one
of the themes of the play. The entire play has a series of dramatic turns
of events each of which occur just by pure chance.
Element of fate in Shakespeare's plays is a widely discussed theme. I guess
that this could have inspired some to take up a similar theme with regard
to Sanskrit plays.
Many s'aapa events in Sanskrit narratives involve 'pure chance', and the
s'aapa turns out to be the cause for later events. Dasaratha getting cursed
by Sravanakumara's parents is just by pure chance. But it is this curse
which causes Rama's vanavaasa and all the later events.
In Pratimaa naaTakam , Bhasa makes Kaikeyi plead innocence in front of
Bharata who was angry with him, blaming her demands on the power of the
curse and makes Bharata say, "this has scope for a lot of thinking " (
something like "good point!")
In popular exegesis in India, quite often taking the form of folk songs,
many key events in Ramayana and Mahabharata are attributed to pure chance
and power of fate.
Good topic if not yet covered.
