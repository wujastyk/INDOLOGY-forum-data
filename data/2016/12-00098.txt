[INDOLOGY] hostel in Mysore
About 15 years ago I visited Mysore and stayed in a nicely austere guest house, as far as I recall very centrally located. It must have had some Sanskrit name but I forget what it is. Could anyone advise me on what the name might be, or where else to stay in Mysore?
Sorry for using the forum as a tourist guidebook!
Best wishes,
