Dear colleagues,

A colleague of mine is looking for a high-resolution image of dhanus/dhavin (Sagittarius) in Indian sculpture, mural or manuscript. I came across an image from the internet which gives the description: "C. Saura Sect of Hinduism. Zodiac Wheel. Dolerite. Andhra Pradesh, India?:

Could anyone confirm the provenance of this piece or any other similar object?

Textually, I am also curious about the variants dhanu/dhanvin. Sphujidhvaja in his Yavanaj?taka gave dhanus, dhanurdhara and dhavin. Var?hamihira in addition gave the Sanskritized greek term tauk?ika (from ???????). I am curious which form the modern Indian languages took - the bow, the archer/centaur or both?

Best regards,

Bill
