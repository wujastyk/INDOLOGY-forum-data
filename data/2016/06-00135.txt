[INDOLOGY] Jati as Caste in Nyaya?
While perhaps a little off topic, below I have included what is an
interesting, contemporary inclusion to this discussion on jati, etc found
in NCERT's 12th grade high school text book. In chapter 3, pp 42-> .
This link will take you to the pdf of ch. 3.

While there is nothing really 'new' here to add to this interesting
discussion I think it is interesting, nonetheless, to see how these ideas
find their way into school text books. The following is part of the text
from pp 42-43. However, the discussion goes on for a few pages.
p42
*As is well-known, the English word ?caste? is actually a borrowing from
the Portuguese casta, meaning pure breed. The word refers to a broad
institutional arrangement that in Indian languages (beginning with the
ancient Sanskrit) is referred to by two distinct terms, varna and jati.
Varna, literally ?colour?, is the name given to a four-fold division of
society into brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya and shudra, though this excludes
a significant section of the population composed of the ?outcastes?,
foreigners, slaves, conquered peoples and others, sometimes refered to as
the panchamas or fifth category. Jati is a generic term referring to
species or kinds of anything, ranging from inanimate objects to plants,
animals and human beings. Jati is the word most commonly used to refer to
the institution of caste in Indian languages, though it is interesting to
note that, increasingly, Indian language speakers are beginning to use the
English word ?caste?.*
*The precise relationship between varna and jati has been the subject of
much speculation and debate among scholars. The most common interpretation
is to treat varna as a broad all-India aggregative classification, while
jati is taken to be a regional or local sub-classification involving a much
more complex system consisting of hundreds or even thousands of castes and
sub-castes. *
p43
*This means that while the four varna classification is common to all of
India, the jati hierarchy has more local classifications that vary from
region to region*.
