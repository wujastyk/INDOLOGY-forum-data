Dear Aleksander,
If you /were just taking exception with the identification Isvara = Siva 
in the Svetasvatara = in all Upanisads = in Kalidasa = ergo in Patanjali 
as his contemporary,/
then, what on earth does the word Isvara denote in the 
Svetasvataropanishad  and in the woks of Kalidasa ??
Ganesan
