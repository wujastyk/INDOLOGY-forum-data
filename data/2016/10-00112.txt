Subject: [INDOLOGY] Hindi/Marathi transliteration
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQHzXDQ7x+RxL+L4_60J-zydvKiJUiuA19k3DtgpNtFPew@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I've been asked this question to which I don't know the answer.  In the
transliteration of Hindi or Marathi are dashes usually placed between stems
of compounds as is sometimes done in transliterating sanskrit.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
