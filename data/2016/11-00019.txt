[INDOLOGY] First female sovereign
Rich,
your memory is right, the section is on p. 118ff. The earliest case he mentions is V?k??aka Queen Prabh?vat? Gupta (until 443 CE) and he also lists a number of other cases. Discussing the legal background, he refers to Kane  3, 40, Artha??stra 5, 6, 34 and Raghuva??a 19, 57.
Best,
Klaus
