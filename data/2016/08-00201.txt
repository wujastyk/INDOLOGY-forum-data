Dear colleagues,

I?m looking for a pdf copy of the following two articles: 

? Insler, Stanley. 1998. ?mitr??mv?ru?? or mitr?? v?ru???, in Jay Jasanoff, H. Craig Melchert and Lisi Olivier (eds.), M?r Curad: Studies in Honor of Calvert Watkins. Innsbruck: Institut f?r Sprachwissenschaft der Universit?t Innsbruck, pp. 285-290.
? Kashikar, Chintamani Ganesh. 1951. ?The problem of the Ga?antas in the ?gveda-Padap??ha?, in Proceedings of All-India Oriental Conference (Thirteenth Session: Nagpur University, October 1946, Part 2): 39-46.

To be honest, I could get both volumes through interlibrary loan, but it takes long, and I?m in a hurry to complete an article that is long, long due.

Thank you in advance.

Best,

Marco Franceschini
