Dear Indologists,
I'm looking for a translated (in english) passage of the Skandapurana:
In a secondary sources found that in *Skandapurana 5.2.8.1* and following
verses it should be written that ?iva was used to dwell in the crematory
fields where he had sexual intercourse with his wife (Sati?).
Actually I cannot check the edition kept in our department's library.
Anyone has a pdf or can just report the exact verses (5.2.8.1 to
5.2.8.xxx)? I also need to be sure that the secundary source was right in
quoting the source.
Moreover, anyone can suggest any other Puranic source where I could find
the same (or similar) description?
Best,
Paolo
