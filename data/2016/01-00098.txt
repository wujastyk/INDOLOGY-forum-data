[INDOLOGY] a recent review of the Jamison-Brereton RV	translation by Karen Thomson
Thank you for these comments. I agree with you regarding the fascinating, arcane nature of the text.
In reading and rereading Thomson?s article, despite its title, I did not get the impression that she claims the text is clearly and simply auto-revelatory, speaking for itself without exigesis. I don?t know if she wrote that title, or if she did, if is sarcastic or earnest.  
Indeed she seems to argue in various ways that the text was prematurely assumed to be comprehended based on unreliable, at times anachronistic interpretations. For example: ?Roberto Calasso vividly portrays the world of the Br?hma?as in Ardor. But he has been misled in one crucial respect: it is not the world of the Rigvedic poets.? Etc.
Nor does Thomson?s goal seem to be to prudishly domesticate the text, but rather to point out what she considers to be gratuitous eroticizing based on dubious translations, in one case of a hapax legomenon. She does not construct a general argument for a sexless RV.
Best wishes,
Howard
