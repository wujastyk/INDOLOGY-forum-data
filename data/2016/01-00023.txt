There was a thread on this list, during july 2014, that discussed the issue
of Mahabharata and 'real history' as a matter of course:

That part of the thread may be useful for the present inquiry.

Jung's works should be useful to deal with the issue of 'truth' in 'myths'
from the point of view of Psychoanalysis (more precisely analytical
psychology).
