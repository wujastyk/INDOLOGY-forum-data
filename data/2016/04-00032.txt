Advertisement and further particulars for two 2-year postdoctoral
research fellowships in Indian Philosophy at Wolfson College Oxford,
starting 2016
Dear Friends,
I am attaching an advertisement and further particulars for two 2-year
postdoctoral research fellowships in Indian Philosophy at Wolfson College
Oxford, applications and references due by 13 May to start in Wolfson this
October, 2016. The required part of the research concerns the application
of Indian Philosophy to certain socio-political issues listed here by the
Berggruen Institute, some more and some less closely connected with Indian
Philosophy, because the philosophies of other cultures are also being
accommodated on other sites.
  The reason why some postdoctoral experience is required is that these
posts are more generously funded than Wolfson Junior Research fellowships,
so as to guarantee substantial research in the area. Wolfson was envisaging
typically between 3 and 10 years from the relevant PhD. But if equivalent
experience can be claimed, candidates should not hesitate to make a special
case. Provided the substantial research in this area is produced,
postholders are free to publish on their other interests as well. Other
schools of Indian Philosophy can be researched besides the ones I have
listed as examples.
Do let me know if you know of good candidates.
All good wishes
Yours
Richard
