[INDOLOGY] Eating flesh of a jogi, a magician, a healer
The narrative under question is a legend. Legends are a genre of folk
narratives. They differ from 'history' in having unrealistic and
scientifically not verified elements. Dhanthar Baid is such a character
without historical evidence. The 'visionary' (dreamlike and as such
requiring symbolic interpretation , are part of legends as much as of the
other genres of folk narratives.
One of the distinctions of modern studies of culture in contrast to
traditional localized studies of the native cultures by the natives, is
comparative study.
For such a comparison we may have to look at the motifs of cannibalism in
cultures outside India. The following links provide some such information:

Comparative studies may help in understanding both commonalities and
distinct specifics.
To understand each of the compared cultures in their own right, other
components of each of the cultural complex may help.
