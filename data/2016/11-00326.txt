[INDOLOGY] yamas and niyamas
MEA CULPA:
Thanks to Steve Farmer for pointing out to me that the edition I was
relying on of the Ha?ha-Yoga-Prad?pik?, Pancham Singh's edition originally
published in 1914, conflates Brahm?nanda's "Jyotsn?" commentary with the
original text. The list of the 10 yamas and 10 niyamas comes from the
commentary, not from the HYP itself.
Here's a better edition that clearly separates text and commentary (see p.
14 of this edition for Brahm?nanda's list of yamas and niyamas):

My confusion was, in a way, an illustration of the larger point of my
previous email: there were various commonly cited lists of 10 yamas and 10
niyamas floating around in the first and second millennia CE. Some of them
include compassion as one of the 10 yamas. Yoga practitioners (and
professors!) tend to get these lists and texts mixed up.
