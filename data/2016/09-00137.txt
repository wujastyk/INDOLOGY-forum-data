There are a number in the Maitr?/Maitr?yan? Upani?ad, e.g. I.4, vanaspatayodbh?ta- from vanaspataya? udbh?ta > vanaspataya udbh?ta- 

I think there?s some discussion of the phenomenon in 

Buitenen, J. A. B. van. The Maitr?ya??ya Upani?ad: a critical essay. The Hague: Mouton, 1962.

If anyone could point me either to the old posts (assuming that they exist outside my imagination) or to some useful discussion of the phenomenon (does it occur and, if so, where; how is it regarded, etc), I should be most grateful.
