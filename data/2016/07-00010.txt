[INDOLOGY] meru tantra
Dear Friends,
Does anyone have or know where I could find a copy of the meru tantra? I
know nothing about this text. When was it composed? I have looked on
gretil, muktabodha, archive, google,wikipedia, but no luck.
The searchable archives on Indology came up with not much:

apart from a suggestion it was written in the 8th century.
I would like a searchable document ideally.
An organisation I am studying at the moment keeps referring to it for the
definition of a 'Hindu'.
