Subject: [INDOLOGY] meru tantra
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrD-AD8MRg0JA+dOW=11gSboPS+_DUe6NAYh2t1=xcAPJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Does anyone have or know where I could find a copy of the meru tantra? I
know nothing about this text. When was it composed? I have looked on
gretil, muktabodha, archive, google,wikipedia, but no luck.

The searchable archives on Indology came up with not much:
http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2004-September/028666.html
apart from a suggestion it was written in the 8th century.


I would like a searchable document ideally.
An organisation I am studying at the moment keeps referring to it for the
definition of a 'Hindu'.
