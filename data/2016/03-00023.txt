[INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock
Dear list members
Late last night, Mr. Rohan Murty stated to the Economic Times that Prof.
Sheldon Pollock will stay on the board of MCLI for ?many years to come?.[1]
With this, the short-lived controversy is over and the chapter is closed,
and it is time for everybody to move on. While I do not personally agree
with one statement of Mr. Murty ("there aren't more scholars in India
capable of carrying out such translations from ancient literature"), I
respect his decision and am nobody to question it. Mr. Murty's comments
should be read by all petitioners, they can learn a lesson or two from
them.
Concidentally, yesterday evening Justice Pratibha Rani granted a six-month
interim bail to JNU student Kanhaiya Kumar with some conditions (he will
not participate actively or passively in ... and make all efforts within
his power to control ... anti-national activities).[2] The full judgement
of Pratibha Rani should likewise be read by all those who signed the
solidarity statement on JNU, they can learn a lesson or two from it.
