[INDOLOGY] Revolving wheel in ancient Indian literature
Dear List,
Mahabharata I, 29. 2-5 and Sumangalavilasini (Buddhaghosa's commentary to
Mahaparinibbana-sutta)  VI, 26  contain images of a revolving wheel (with
360? spokes), guarded by figures with swords in hands, and by two serpents.
Vi?vakarma/Vissakamma is mentioned as the wheel's constructor.
Is that - or similar - image present somewhere else in the ancient Indian
literature?
Thanks in advance for your comments -
