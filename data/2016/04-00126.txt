[INDOLOGY] Fwd: New publication
Dear All,
Antonio writes:
It doesn't remain intolerable. Sooner or later (at the most two years)
those expensive electronic copies are stolen (or pirated, whatever) and
trickle down into a kind of second-hand, freely accessible electronic
depositories.
Should I provide links to some of the most popular web portals, calling
themselves "scientific community targeting collections of books"?
By not coming up with much cheaper alternatives to their products, such as
could be purchased (and placed on their shelves) by the general reading
public, the publishing business acts against its own interests. Ultimately,
limited demand for their luxury editions, and, simultaneously, loss of
possible profits from the sale of the cheaper versions of their books.
Regards,
Artur
