Hi Jesse,
A slight variant, "janman? j?yate ??dra?," is traced to the Skanda Pur??a,
N?gara-kha??a 239.31 on the website linked below. The author of the website
article includes a screenshot of a published edition with the text
highlighted, but does not give any information about the edition of the
text. Still, I hope it is a helpful lead.

Ted Benke also quotes the passage in his dissertation (p. 267, see link
below), saying that it is "attributed to Manu," citing Radhakrishnan.

told me about several inter-caste, Vedic ???????s they have recently
established, incorporating sometimes even dalits, women, and adivasis.  I
have a feeling one of you knows the source. Thanks for your time. ??????,J
