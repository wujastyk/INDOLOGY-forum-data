To All,

        

         While going through an English transalation of Asanga's  MahyanaSutralankara , I cane across a situation where Liberation or Enlightment takes place when Alaya -Vigyan blends with Dharma-Dhatau ( I.e a state where the distinction between Object and subject ceases).I have, in a number of places come across the term Dharma' whcih has variously been defined as Phenomena, state of things etc. Can anybody elaborate on the exact implication of Dharma in Buddhism.





                                                            ALAKENDU DAS.
