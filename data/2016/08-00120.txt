[INDOLOGY] A grammar question
Dear list members,
Apologies if this is an elementary question.
In the Shanti mantra taken from the Taittiriya Upanishad
saha n?vavatu saha nau bhunaktu saha v?rya? karav?vahai tejasvi n?vadh?tam
astu m? vidvi??vahai
Why is it  vidvi??vahai and not  vidve??vahai similar to the form   dve??vahai
?
I couldn't see it listed as an irregular form in MacDonnels grammar for
students or his Vedic grammar for students or Whitney.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
