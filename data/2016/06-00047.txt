Buddhist Photographic Images
Dear Sirs,
In connection with an exhibition focusing on Buddhism and the life of
Buddha, I am looking for *modern *photographic images of:
1.       Lumbini (Mayadevi Temple & Ashokan Pillar)
2.       Bodhgaya (Bodhgaya Temple and Bodhi Tree)
3.       Sarnath (Dhamekh Stupa)
4.       Kushinagar (Parinirvana Temple & Stupa, and Ramabhar Stupa)
5.       Sanchi (Great Stupa & four ornamental Toranas)
Any help you are able to give in sourcing the above would be gratefully
appreciated.
Yours faithfully,
