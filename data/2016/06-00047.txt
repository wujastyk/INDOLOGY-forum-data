Dear Sirs,



In connection with an exhibition focusing on Buddhism and the life of
Buddha, I am looking for *modern *photographic images of:



1.       Lumbini (Mayadevi Temple & Ashokan Pillar)

2.       Bodhgaya (Bodhgaya Temple and Bodhi Tree)

3.       Sarnath (Dhamekh Stupa)

4.       Kushinagar (Parinirvana Temple & Stupa, and Ramabhar Stupa)

5.       Sanchi (Great Stupa & four ornamental Toranas)



Any help you are able to give in sourcing the above would be gratefully
appreciated.



Yours faithfully,





Gareth Wilson
