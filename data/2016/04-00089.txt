[INDOLOGY] Fwd: New publication
Totally agree Artur.
Professor Wujastyk has often advocated for authors to use Open Source
publication platforms. I think we should all support his call.
Apart from prestige, I cannot understand from an academic perspective
why an author would choose to publish with publishers like Brill - a
for-profit company with shareholders and hunger for ever increasing
profits. I notice that Brill have never endowed a professorship in
Indology - yet they have profited from the publications in our field
for quite some time. It would seem unethical for academics to support
them - especially in the present climate where our entire field is
under attack from short-sighted governments on the one hand and
fundamentalist political groups on the other.
Indology is already in a precarious enough position, why make its
fruits even more inaccessible? There's no point being the last endowed
professor of Sanskrit publishing fabulous original research of works
if noone can read them...
Apologies for the rant.
Kind regards,
Antonio
