Subject: [INDOLOGY] suicide as a result of love

I have the feeling that this is a relatively common motif in story
literature. The one example that comes to mind is the Prakrit verse romance
L?l?vat?, in which one of the characters (Kuvalay?val?) has a "gandharva"
wedding with a Gandharva (Citr??gada), and when her father finds out and
curses them, she is so overcome with shame that she tries to hang herself
from a tree. She is stopped at the last moment by her mother Rambh?. This
is around v. 658 in A.N. Upadhye's edition.
