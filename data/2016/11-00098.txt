[INDOLOGY] bhakti
I sent this response yesterday, but by mistake it only went to Patrick 
and not the list, so I resend it here.
I now see that Valerie made the same point about using "Indian astrology."
Hi Patrick,
It would be easy to replace the name Vedic astrology with Indian 
astrology. It's more accurate, anyway, because that encompasses what 
could be called Jain, Buddhist, Hindu, etc. astrology.
There certainly has been a pattern for centuries of appropriating the 
label "Vedic" for enhancing the prestige of one's own tradition or text 
and making it seem very ancient. There are claims of being the nectar of 
the Vedas, as in the /Bh?gavata Pur??a/, as well as statements about the 
Vedas ultimately being about this or that god or goddess. These are 
clearly sectarian claims.
Best,
Luis
