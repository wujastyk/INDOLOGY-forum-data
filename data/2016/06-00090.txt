The passage also occurs in Mah?bh??ya 5.1.115. 

I have used it as one piece of evidence among several others to conclude that Pata?jali was a Kashmirian in section 2.6 of my article ?Pata?jali: a Kashmirian? published in  2008. Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir. Co-edited by me with Mr. Mrinal Kaul. New Delhi: D.K. Printworld. Pp. XXIV + 609.

The discussion in the Mah?bh??ya is semantic or linguistic. It is a statement on what the users of Skt understand when the word br?hma?a is uttered. It is not an attempt to decide if br?hma?atva is a j?ti in the same way as gotva. (Extend this to ?k?atriyatva : a?vatva? etc.; the grammarians? notion of j?ti or universal is not the same as that of the Vai?e?ikas and Naiy?yikas anyway; it is thoroughly ?abd?dhi??hita or semantic.)

For those who are interested in Pata?jali, the grammarian: The article mentioned above is preceded in the same volume by two other articles of mine: (a) ?Pata~jali?s Mah?bh??ya as a key to happy Kashmir.? (b) "Gonard?ya, Go?ik?-putra, Patanjali and Gonand?ya."
