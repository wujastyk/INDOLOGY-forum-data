Dear list,
In the article "Dice-Play on the First Day of the White Half of the 
Month, Kartika" published in the Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society 
(Vol. XIV, 1923) by Dr. R. Shama Sastry, a passage about dice-play from 
a work entitled "Maharajavijaya" is given in English translation. No 
further information is provided, and no such title is listed in the NCC.
Can anybody help me find out which work Dr. Sastry is referring to?
Kind regards,
Jacob
