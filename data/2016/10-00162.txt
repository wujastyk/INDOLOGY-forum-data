The term *eve-teasing* (note the use of lowercase *e*) is used not only in
India, but in other South Asian countries also (including Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, and Bangladesh).
And I believe the term eve here refers to women in general, and is not an
English/Western forename or reference to the Biblical Eve. A similar use of
the term eve occurs in Indian (maybe South Asian?) English in sports. Since
my childhood (1980s), I have noted that newspapers in India often refer to
Indian women's team in team sports as *Indian eves*. I doubt if this usage
is common outside India/South Asia. A few recent examples:
