Dear Friends,
One of our students is looking forward to work on the
Sulem?n/Sulaim?n/Suleim?n Caritra (?) by Kaly??a Malla (16th CE). There is
a recent English translation by A.N.D Haksar published by Penguin India.

I am looking for its original Sanskrit text. A PDF would be really
appreciated. Would someone happen to have it?
Thanks very much in advance.
