[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
Dear Bill, I agree with you completely about the fascinating role of things
like the planetarium in negotiations over identity and history. My
frustration is specific, and likely a result of the precarious nature of my
current method. In my humble experience, cyber-ethnography does not really
generate the type of rapport required to effectively conduct 'field work'.
There doesn't seem to be a critical mass of 'vedic astrologers' in my city,
so I feel forced in some way to reach out through the Internet and 'cold
call'.  If funds were made available I would certainly aim to include trips
to the planetarium with the intention of conducting interviews with
visitors. This would certainly yield less bland results.
