<In the RV many adjectives are used as more or less abstract terms, for
example the adjective which refers to cows and dawns (*usriya*) or to
horses and Soma (hari).>

I welcome Professor Jurewicz for her views that I have known for some time
and for her bold statement. I do not hesiatete to state that the
observation covers a large part of the Rigveda. But one may note that
Oldenberg had an approach that harped on concretenss. Klaus Mylius and here
Sukumari Bhattacharji stuck to that idea of concreteness.  On personal
conversation I understood that the latter see that there is no well-defined
and accepted methodology for pinpointing what is abstract and what is not
and one may be carried away by preconceived ideas like Coomaraswamy. While
personally congratulating Professor Jurewicz, I still hope to see a
successful attempt to find a methodology that is acceptable to the majority.

I am sorry for the long lecture.

Best
