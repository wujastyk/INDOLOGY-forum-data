=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_vid=C5=AB=E1=B9=A3aka=3F?=
Dear friends,
I have been asked whether vid??aka could be derived from the vidv??s, the
perfect participle made with kvasu ? to mean something like ?little genius?
or ?wiseacre? or ?smart alec.?
It is a fun idea, and in a way more appealing than the dictionary
definition of ?wicked person,? ?corrupter? (from vi-?du?+?ic+?vul). But, I
don?t see any P??inian way, at least, to lengthen the ? in the course of
such a derivation; sampras?ra?a via 6.4.131 instead yields short u.
Can anyone shed light? Perhaps some writers or commentators in the
dramaturgical literature offer etymologies for technical terms?
Many thanks, and apologies for the naive errors I have likely made.
Jo
