[INDOLOGY] Revolving wheel in ancient Indian literature
As far as the number 360 and the months are concerned, it should be noted that there is the idea of s?vanam?sa or "civil month", which is an ideal month consisted of exactly 30 days. Hence, 12 civil months would make up an ideal year of 360 days. This notion is suggested in most older jyoti?a texts, from Veda?gajyoti?a to Yavanaj?taka though not necessarily spelt out explicitly and is not known to be applied in any known calendar in India. Hence, among the uniquely Indian four types of months, one finds beside saura (solar, c. 30.5 days), c?ndra (synodic, c. 29.5 days), n?k?atra (sidereal, c. 27.3 days), but also s?vana (30 days). Kum?raj?va (4th century) in his description of the Indian (Vedic) months gave the values of these four months which are identical to VJ. YJ 79.11 gives definition of s?vanam?sa (tri??addin?? s?vanam?sa) and the lord of the year system in YJ 79.54 suggests also a year consisted of 360 days.
