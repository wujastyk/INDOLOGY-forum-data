In the same sukta, there is

?????? ????????????? ???????? ????? ??????? |

???????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????????? ||??||



Does ???????? ?????????? also have a hierarchical value connotation?



Body part descriptions are there in the Sukta in relation to many other
cosmic entities too. Are they all hierarchically viewed? If no, then why
this argument be limited only for the socirty aspect?



Though Vibhaktis are different for first three quarters and the fourth
quarter, the meaning has to be taken consistently and uniformly for all the
four quarters of the mantra. So in all the four quarters, it means that
four varNas are depicted as forming equi-status components of an organic
entity.



Hierarchy is not there in sAyaNabhAshya too.


It is quite natural for those with hierarchy in their attitude or those who
enjoy wielding their superiority to misquote books or misinterpret them in
the direction of their favor.


But their misquotation or misinterpretation can not be the basis of the
interpretation of the text.


Particularly a historical study citing such a text  as the source or origin
of hierarchy, depending on its wrong interpretation, loses its validity on
account of the wrongness of the interpretation.
