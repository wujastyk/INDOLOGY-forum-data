=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Translation_of_ya=E1=B9=A3=E1=B9=ADihastaya?=
The *Vi?vaprak??a* lists one of the meanings of *ya??i* as flagstaff (
*dhvajada??a*, as opposed to a simple staff or *da??a*).
*ya??irh?ralat??astrabhedayordhvajada??ake* (*?advikam*, verse 23)
Unless a usage or *Ko?a* citation can be traced, the meaning of ?sacrifice?
given by B?htlingk for the word *ya??i *needs to be taken with a grain of
salt. The Ny?sa, a commentary on the K??ik?, has the example as *k?mi??im* and
not *k?? ya??i? *(see attached) under A 3.3.110. For the ?sacrifice?
meaning, one needs a suffix in *bh?va. ktin *is such a suffix, but due to A
6.1.15 (*vacisvapiyaj?d?n?? kiti*), *yaj* + *ktin *will result in *i??i*.
It is possible that there was a scribal error or an error on part of
B?htlingk which led to *k?mi??im* being mistaken as *k?? ya??i? *in the
commentary he referred to.
The *?abdakalpadruma* has this to say on the derivation of *ya??i*:
*yaj* + *b?hulak?t
ti?*, *iti u??div?ttau ujjvaladatta?* (4.179). This makes sense, as with
*ti?* the *sampras?ra?a* by A 6.1.15 would not take place.
