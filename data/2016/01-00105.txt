[INDOLOGY] Ahigavi?
In a panegyrical reference to his guru in the /H?yanaratna/, Balabhadra 
makes use of the word /ahigav?/:
/atha nat?d?n?m ?nayanam ukta? 
sakalasiddh?ntama??al?sarovihara?ar?jaha?saga?itavidy?c?tur?t?ntrikapa?c?nan?higav?prav??ai? 
?r?madgurucara?ai? paddhaticint?ma?au |//

I'm inclined to understand it simply to mean 'planet', but I can't find 
this particular compound anywhere else, so I can't be sure. In light of 
everything else going on in this compound (there's half a zoo in there), 
I'd be grateful for any suggestions from the vidv?ns on this list.
