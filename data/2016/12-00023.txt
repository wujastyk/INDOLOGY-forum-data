Dear Colleagues,

Our library?s copy of the Me?langes d'indianisme a? la me?moire de Louis Renou (1968) is lost and I would like to get a copy of Daniel Ingalls? article ?The Harivamsa as a Mahakavya,? pp.381-94.  Any chance a good soul on the list has a copy to send to me privately?

Thanks in advance,

Don Davis
