[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear All:
I hope some of you may be able to refer me to a reliable source for ancient Indian units of volume. Dictionaries and other sources generally give units of length and weight, but not volume. For example, one says an ?a?jali? is the same as a ?prastha?, and under prastha simply says that it is a unit of volume!! I would like to convert some of these into current measurements, such as liter. Thanks.
Patrick
