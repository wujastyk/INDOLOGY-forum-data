[INDOLOGY] bhakti
drAviDa Veda concept is a different cultural process than the process of
attempting to gain respect by claiming a certain cultural item to be Vedic
either in the sense of being in Vedas or in the sense of  'belonging to the
lineage of the cultural/textual complex of which the Vedas are (of course,
vital) part'.
In 'drAviDa (in the sense of Tamil not at all in the sense of
Dravidian) Veda' something which is not in Sanskrit or Vedic language is
being called  Veda itself not ' Vedic' . drAvida Veda is a concept of
parallel Veda. It is a challenge to the idea that Veda has to be
essentially in Vedic language or 'Vedic Sanskrit' recited with its svara
system.'Parallel to Veda' is not counter to or alternative / substitute to
the Veda.  The concept of parallel Veda is that it is to be placed
alongside the Veda with status equal to that of /to be respected equally
as- the Veda.
The significant difference between the recitation styles the Veda and the
drAviDa Veda is that the former is pronounced with svara and has its own
'musical style' called sAma Veda while the latter is pronounced without
svara and has two styles of recitation one the s'loka-like pronunciation
and Tamil style musical rendering (e.g. tiruppAvai pAs'uram rendering in
Bharata Natyam)
