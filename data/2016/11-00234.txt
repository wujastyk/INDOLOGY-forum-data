Softcover. Very Good Condition. Octavo (14.5 x 22 cms approx). 27 Pages.
Original printed wrappers as issued. *Scarce*. The condition will reflect
the fragile and ephemeral format of the production; very good overall. This
is a Publisher's Offprint, not an extract or a reprint. An offprint is
produced by the publisher's of journals in very small quantities, with the
usual intention of allowing the author to present them to friends or
colleagues and for review. The printing is done simultaneously with the
main journal, and then they are bound up in specially printed wrappers with
the author's name and title printed. They are considered quite collectable
and desirable due to their intimate connection to the author of the work,
rather than the more mass produced nature of the full journal. PLEASE NOTE:

(standard book size). Multiple copies available this title. Quantity
Available: 3. Category: Royal Asiatic Society Offprints; Pamphlet;
