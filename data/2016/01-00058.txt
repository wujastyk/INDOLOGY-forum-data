[INDOLOGY] Question about a Pali name
Thanks, Stefan.  That suggests that somewhere in the spectrum of MIA
dialects, "metta-" and "manta-" got mixed up.  "Mant?n?" in Pali seems, as
you say, to point to some vernacular Skt usage like "Mantr?ya??", which
does not occur in the standard layer of Sanskrit.
