I join Madhav and Patrick in their sentiments.  Ludo and I were colleagues from 1965 on and I always found him courteous and cooperative, willing and able to contribute to discussions meaningfully and fairly.  Cordially, George Cardona

He loved my daughters and was like a grand father to them, during Manjushree's visit to Philadelphia.  Shubhangi and I visited him and Rosane at his home in Philadelphia a few years ago, and experienced the continued warmth of his affection.  He was a true Guru to me.  May he rest in peace.  I have attached photo of Ludo and Rosane with his students.
