[INDOLOGY] amrita
Dear Artur,
one of the early and clear example of the struggle for am?ta between devas and asuras is K??hakasa?hit? 37.14, translated by Wendy Doniger in her Hindu Myths (Penguin 1975, p. 281 + see parallel passages and relevant secondary literature on pp. 280-281).
Demon ?u??a holds am?ta in his mouth so he can restore dead asuras back to life by breathing at them, while devas killed by asuras remain dead. Indra managed to steal am?ta from ?u??a's mouth. The text really uses the word am?ta (not soma): dev?? ca asur?? ca sa?yatt? ?sann asure?u tarhy am?tam ?s?c chu??e d?nave...
Best,
Lubom?r
