Subject: [INDOLOGY] looks like someone hacked Francesco Sferra's email...
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4JMnOiK3Ypdi=T9RkQoKmxA5PqE6S+btjZn9-KR3P4i8Q@mail.gmail.com>

dear Friends,

I'm afraid it looks like --as far as I can tell from the email--it is not
Jens-Uwe Hartmann (whose name is in the signature) but rather Francesco
Sferra's email which got hacked. I have written to him about it.

Best, Jonathan
