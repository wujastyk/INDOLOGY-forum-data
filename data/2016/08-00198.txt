[INDOLOGY] looks like someone hacked Francesco Sferra's email...
dear Friends,
I'm afraid it looks like --as far as I can tell from the email--it is not
Jens-Uwe Hartmann (whose name is in the signature) but rather Francesco
Sferra's email which got hacked. I have written to him about it.
Best, Jonathan
