[INDOLOGY] Language names and Personal names ...
Dear List Members,
Recently, there was a webmail entry in a Tamil forum about including a language-name in one?s personal name. 
There are numerous personal names that include the word ?Tamil? in some form. So, the author of the enquiry was wondering if there would be a similar practice in other languages. I know for sure that "English? is the last of name of some individuals I know. 
Further examples and descriptions would be appreciated.
Thanks and regards,
rajam
