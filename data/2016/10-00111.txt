[INDOLOGY] Articles needed
Dear list members,
I came across two articles in academia.edu (probably by list members) that
I unfortunately didn't download and can't find anymore.  If anyone can give
me either the links to them or the pdfs I'd be grateful.The titles were
something like
a) Vocatives for nomanitives, vocatives replacing nominatives
b) viniyoga
Also if anyone can point me to any; articles on the word "Guru"
particularly about its linguistic history in becoming the word for
"teacher, preceptor".
Thank you,
Harry Spier
