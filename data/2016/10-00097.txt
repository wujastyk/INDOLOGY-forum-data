[INDOLOGY] crossing oceans?
I think the origin of that idea is the ahi?s?-precept: Conquering water 
may kill animals (by accident).
I remember while working on my Ph. D. (Edition of Prakrit-manuscripts):
For a monk it is forbidden to step across water (e. g. during the rainy 
season) because he might step into the water and kill small animals.
.../a??ay? so s?dh? vivaraya? uttarai. tattha ya p?da-vikkha?bha? 
p??iya?. te?a p?do pas?rio gai-bhede?a?. tattha ya devay?e chidda? 
labhi??a? [?ruo] chi??o. so bha?ai: ?micch?-dukka?a? m? ?ukk?e pa?io 
bhojja?tti. a???e sammaddi??hiy?e di??h?. s? gh?-?iy?. tah?eva sappadeso 
laio r??ho ya devay?-pabh?ve?a?/...(?va?yaka-c?r?i 514sq.)
This idea is also connected with the buddhist precept for monks not to 
travel during the rain season (vassa).
