Notwithstanding all these hypothetical objections, I believe Thompson?s work to be of great value. Those on this list may judge for themselves.

Though dated, I do not think they have been superseded and scholars on this list should be familiar with them. Sadakata has provided some important updates in his two books in Japanese but a truly scholarly work in English on the topic has yet to emerge. Has any of Thompson?s works been reviewed? Did he have anything new to add? I do not want to sound unreasonably dismissive, but there is a long line of self-proclaimed Vedic scientists who try to convince the public that just because they have a PhD in mathematics, astrophysics or any of the ?hard? sciences, they will be irrefutably right in all other fields in the humanities and social sciences. If I have a PhD in Indology, I would not write a book on brain science and put my PhD on the book cover. I cannot imagine why anyone who wants to be taken seriously would do that. This reminds me of an embarrassing occasion at the last World Sanskrit Conference in Bangkok where a speaker in the scientific panel presented a paper on the science of ?Buddhist yoga? and bewildered the audience with fantastic formulae of astrophysics. But the topics of certain scientists trying to prove that there are theories of relativity or quantum physics in the Vedas or that the vim?nas are evidences for Indian?s ancient space technology are old stories which I do not need to reiterate here (http://www.deccanherald.com/content/452573/iisc-research-debunked-long-ago.html <http://www.deccanherald.com/content/452573/iisc-research-debunked-long-ago.html>)

>>> I believe rather than simply bland, "uncritical absorption of the/a Vedic narrative,? the examples of ISKCON ?Vedic Planetarium? and ?Vedic model of universe? I mentioned earlier illustrates quite tellingly, at least in this particular instance, what the intention was. To me, it seems to be part of an ongoing negotiation of the role of Indian culture in the modern world and an alternative narrative to the one created in the Western culture, one that Indians today both love and hate. In doing so, some sought to reclaim their identities as defined by themselves and not others. 
>>> 
>>> In this particular case, if Vedic is defined historically as the Western historians and philologists do, there is no question that ?Vedic Planetarium? is a pure misnomer. There was not even any planet beside Sun and Moon mentioned explicitly in the early Vedic corpus and the Ved??gajyoti?a had no discussion of planets. The Pur??ic cosmology is a hodgepodge of ideas from various sources, both foreign and indigenous and across a long stretch of time. But this model of the universe was created in reaction to the Western model, to the one created by the Greeks, e.g. Ptolemy?s geocentric model, and eventually the development of the model of universe in Western astronomy up to the present day ? a powerful image to represent science and progress, which many today sought to align their values and belief-system to .
>>> 
>>> What ISKCON tried to achieve was to say to the readers that just like in the West one has the history of science, so does India. The proponents of the so-called ?Vedic science? suggest that not only India has science, it is a different science based on a possibly superior authority, i.e., a spiritual, all-encompassing revelation beyond human reasoning based on the ?Vedas," rather than philology and history based on fragments of the reality interpreted by humans. Of course, the arguments they constructed were practically entirely in Western terms, and the evidences they use are so methodologically and philologically unsound that most scholars do not consider them worthy of even consideration and decry them as pseudo-science. This seems to applies from more ludicrous claims such as ?Vedic astrophysics? or ?Vedic aeronautical science?, to the seemingly more benign ?Vedic mathematics? and ?Vedic astronomy?.

One interesting thing is that, even though my interlocutors (westerners for the most part)  almost all assert it means the above; when pressed to define what they consider the 'Vedic' part of the phrase to more specifically mean, the typical answer is overwhelmingly: "I don't really know". If asked to discuss the difference between the astrological, ie predictive systems, or the historical, parallel development of these systems, even some people who claim to be 'professional Vedic astrologers' seem unable to clearly differentiate them.

Dikshit seems to have a western academic understanding of 'Vedic' as a historical period, and he claims that the 'seeds' of a predictive system are present in Atharvajyoti?a, but he is also very clear that such a system is not the one based on the twelve-sign zodiac, although he thinks it 'probable' that the latter system, when it was imported into India, was influenced by the parallel, indigenous system. (Which undoubtedly it was, if perhaps not to the extent that Dikshit would have liked to think. The nak?atras are used in hor?, after all.) This is stated at the beginning of p. 100.

'Vedic' is used here simply in the sense of 'traditional Indian', the implied idea being a tradition that is not only ancient and unbroken, but essentially unchanged (and, as Robert has pointed out, sanctioned by Brahmanic authority).

See ?J?taka branch of astrology? under ?Atharva jyoti?a? in the section Veda?ga (Vol.1 p.97-98). Things might have come to the forefront in recent time, but such ideas have certainly been around.
