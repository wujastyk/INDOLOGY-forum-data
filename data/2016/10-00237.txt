yash?i 1). From this explanation and from the history of the dictionary itself 
as reflected in its introduction it can be assumed that it was Carl Cappeller 
who added the note on P??. 3.3.110 after consulting the entry in PW which 
he knew certainly very well. In this sense Monier-Williams has said nothing 
about ya??i and probably had no idea which commentator on P??ini B?htlingk 
has been referring to.

I suspect that B?htlingk had in mind a passage which he had published 
himself in his edition of P??ini?s A???dhy?y? (published in 1839; B?htlingk was 
24 years old at that time!). At the end of the commentary on P??. 3.3.110 
we read there: "... k?? ya??im ity?di" (P?nini's acht B?cher grammatischer 
Regeln. Vol. 1, p. 173). In the "Einleitung" added at the beginning of the 
second volume of this edition (published in 1840) B?htlingk has provided 
information about the Calcutta commentary on the A???dhy?y? on which his 
own edition was based. I don't have it at hand to check, but I suppose that 
the same text is to be read in this modern commentary began by 
Dharan?dhara and completed by K???n?tha at the suggestion of Colebrooke in 
1809 (see vol. 2, pp. xxxvii?xxxviii of B?htlingk?s edition).

All the best,
Dragomir Dimitrov
