[INDOLOGY] IExternal origin of Dravidian
Dear Suresh Kolichala
What does "external origin of Dravidian" mean?
external to where? and where from?
I'm interested in understanding your theory.
Besides, how do you determine a supposedly substratic word in Dravidian 
from a supposedly non-substratic word in Dravidina?
According to which criteria?
Could you please develop on these points?
Best regards.
