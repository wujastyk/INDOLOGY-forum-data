Dear Suresh Kolichala

What does "external origin of Dravidian" mean?
external to where? and where from?
I'm interested in understanding your theory.

Besides, how do you determine a supposedly substratic word in Dravidian 
from a supposedly non-substratic word in Dravidina?
According to which criteria?
Could you please develop on these points?

Best regards.
A.F
