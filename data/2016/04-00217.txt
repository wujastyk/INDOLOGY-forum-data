[INDOLOGY] From the Mahabharata
bubhuk??? jayate yas tu sa svarga? jayate dhruvam
bubhuk??? jayate yas tu  does not mean one who loses hunger or one who can
stay without being hungry. It means one who keeps one's hunger under one's
control .
k?udh? nir?udati praj??? dharmy?? buddhi? vyapohati
means uncontrolled hunger destroys one's wisdom and drives off one's
righteous understanding.
Issue is bubhukShaajaya and not bubhukShaateevrataa or bubhukShaasaumyataa.
