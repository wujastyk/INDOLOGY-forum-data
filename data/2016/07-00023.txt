=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Attested_use_of_var=E1=B9=A3eja/k=E1=B9=A3areja/=C5=9Bareja/vareja?=
Dear list
Are these any attested uses of the words *var?eja*, *k?areja*, *?areja*,
and *vareja*?
We know that these are all optional forms resulting from the rule *vibh???
var?ak?ara?aravar?t* (6.3.15). Are there any uses in standard works?
Thanks, Nityananda
