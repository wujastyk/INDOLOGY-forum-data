A famous example in the *V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a* is from the *Ayodhy?k???a* (I
have not checked if this is in the critical edition):
*na c?ramasy?? pravidh?yateti* (VR 2.37.34)
where we have
*pravidh?yate + iti -> pravidh?yata iti -> pravidh?yateti*
The *Tilaka *commentary explains this by saying that the rule *na mu ne *(A
8.2.3) is to be split into two by *yogavibh?ga*:
*pravidh?yatet?tyatra sandhistu ?na mu ne? ityatra yogavibh?gena
kvacittrip?dy? asiddhatv?bh?vaj??pan?d?r?atv?dv?* (VR Tilaka 2.37.34)
This is explained in further detail in the attached pages of
*Adhy?tmar?m?ya?e?p??in?yaprayog????
Vimar?a?*.
Another example form the *Bhagavadg?t?:*
*he k???a he y?dava he sakheti* (BG 11.41)
where we have
*sakhe iti -> sakha iti -> sakheti*
And this example from the *Adhy?tma R?m?ya?a*
*mama j?yeti s?teti* (AR 3.8.20)
For which multiple explanations are offered in
*Adhy?tmar?m?ya?e?p??in?yaprayog????
Vimar?a? *(see the attachment)*.*
