Subject: [INDOLOGY] External Origin of Dravidian

Murray Emeneau did not know Tamil, and on many occasions he expressed to me his regret that he had not learned it. In the DED, he and Burrow always put the Tamil occurrence of a word first. Murray worked with my wife, Kausalya, and used her knowledge of modern (and old) Tamil to show that in onomatopoetic words, PDr must have had voiced initial stops. The issue, I think, is not whether old Tamil is very conservative or not ? it clearly is. It is that by itself it cannot serve as a window into PDr. For that, every Dravidian language is obviously required, and one must look at the major branches of the family. Still, I would venture that of all the Dravidian languages that are documented, Sangam Tamil is by far the closest to PDr. To try to understand Dravidian comparative linguistics without considering old Tamil would be pointless. My guess is that Sangam Tamil is about as close to PDr as Vedic Sanskrit is to PIE. George

This early date is an axiom; if the facts do not agree, then the facts are wrong ? and so is the messenger.

One such is pa? = to do. In Telugu it is found in its causative form panucu/pa?cu, nominalized form pani but not in its basic verb form as in Tamil.

Do we have *i?-/i?- 'to descend', 'to go beyond' i?a?ku (i?a?ki-) to descend, alight, fall (as rain), disembark; i?a?kal place of descent, of debarkation etc in Telugu?

I thought, otherwise, identifying any non-Tamil language as retaining the Protodravidian features/elements would not have been possible. But if it can be proved that 'Dravidian linguists have been wrongly reconstructing words and features found only in South Dravidian (esp. Tamil) to the parent language under the assumption that Tamil represents the archaic form of Dravidian' , it will be a path-breaking critique of the current methods of historical linguistics. Now that the likes of Prof. Hans Henrich Hock started to extend the argument to IE studies too, it may pave way for a revamp of the existing methods of historical linguistics. Any such change is certainly welcome.

Des'ya components of various members of Dravidian family that can not be explained by the Dravidian model are what lead to pre-Dravidian substrata.

True, being attested so early, Tamil offers a window on a considerably earlier stage than what we find in the other literary languages (and of course, much earlier than the ?tribal? languages which are attested only since the 19th century). But as you pointed out in your earlier message, other languages preserve archaic features too. Neglecting these can lead to questionable reconstructions.

> There is a similar situation in Modern Indo-Aryan, where we have relatively early attestations in the literary languages, but no comparable ones for the ?tribal? languages of the Northwest; and yet, it is these northwestern languages that preserve much more of the complex consonant combinations of Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) than any of the literary ones (even Gujarati, Sindhi, Kashmiri can?t compete, although these at least preserve the C + r clusters). (If we reconstruct on the basis of literary (early) Modern Indo-Aryan, we won?t reach something close to the ancestral Old Indo-Aryan but only something close to Apabhra??a.) See the discussion between Pattanayak (1966), Katre (1968), Sen (1973), and Miranda (1978).

This verb, so important in South Dravidian, is remarkably absent in Central and North Dravidian languages, and in many of South-Central languages. In Telugu, you may find noun forms such as iravu 'place', irugu 'neighbour, neighbourhood' etc. which can possibly be argued as recent borrowings from Kannada or Tamil.

>> If you believe in my proposed theory of external origin of Dravidian, then the whole question of what constitutes Proto-Dravidian becomes problematic.  Under the usual historical linguistic principles, words and features found only in one branch (South Dravidian, in this case) do not provide evidence for parent language (Proto-Dravidian). But Dravidian linguists have been wrongly reconstructing words and features found only in South Dravidian (esp. Tamil) to the parent language under the assumption that Tamil represents the archaic form of Dravidian. It is a classic catch-22 situation.

Suspending the belief that Tamil represents the most archaic form of Dravidian would be a starting point in this endeavour.
