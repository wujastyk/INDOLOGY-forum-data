Dear List,

while editing the ???g?ratara?gi??, an unpublished commentary on the
Amaru?ataka by a certain S?ryad?sa, I came across the name of a king:
M?nas?hi. As the author's father seems to have worked for him, dating the
king might prove to be decisive for the purpose of (roughly) dating
S?ryad?sa. I could find out that the Tomara Man Singh (1486-1516) is
recorded as M?nas?hi in at least one inscription (Rohtas Fort, Bihar) and
that secondary sources mention many M?nas?hi in Nepal.

The terminus post quem of the ???g?ratara?gi?? is the beginning of the 13th
c., while its terminus ante quem is 1707 AD.

Is the name M?nas?hi known to anyone, with this or other spellings
(M?na??hi, etc.)?

The same commentary mentions a work called Dhane?var?la?k?ra (one ms
against two reads "ca nekhar?la?k?ra", but this is obviously a corruption),
is it familiar to anybody?

With best wishes,
