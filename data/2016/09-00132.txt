[INDOLOGY] Query (Olivelle, J P)
Patrick,
A detailed overview of measurement units is given in Srinivasan?s Mensuration in Ancient India (1979 Ajanta Publications). I believe it is on DLI. He draws from a variety of sources and gives conversions.
Best,
Mark

Dear All:
I hope some of you may be able to refer me to a reliable source for ancient Indian units of volume. Dictionaries and other sources generally give units of length and weight, but not volume. For example, one says an ?a?jali? is the same as a ?prastha?, and under prastha simply says that it is a unit of volume!! I would like to convert some of these into current measurements, such as liter. Thanks.
