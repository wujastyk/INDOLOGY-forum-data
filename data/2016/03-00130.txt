[INDOLOGY] Taittiriya Aranyaka with Bhaskara Misra's commentary
Dear Harry,
It sounds like you are looking specifically for a PDF of the 1902 original
edition of vol. 3. As you know, all three volumes were photographically
reprinted in one volume in 1985 by Motilal Banarsidass. If you can use a
scan of vol. 3 from this reprint, I am sure that many people on this list
have a copy of it.
As for your other question, I do not know of any other edition with
Bhaskara-misra's commentary.
Best regards,
David Reigle
