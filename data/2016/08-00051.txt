Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sinhala half nasal plus m
In-Reply-To: <14FC7947-18A6-4AF8-9C79-27EDC8645C83@illinois.edu>

Unicode has a single character for glyphs in sanskrit devanagari and
related scripts that use diacriticals in transliteraton such * ? ? ? ? ?*.etc.
 but Sinhala uses extra characters that are not used in the other
devanagari or related scripts such as the m with chandra above it that Rolf
asked about.  If that is not in Unicode then that is a serious fault with
Unicode because then you can't encode all characters of ISO15919 in
Unicode.  It may be there but I couldn't find it.


There are unicode characters for accents (grave, accute, underline and
others)  that can be combined with other characters.  This is what the Mac
allows with the US extended keyboard  So theoretically documents containing
text with accents added this way should be transferable accross platforms
as long as each platform uses a unicode font that contains those accents.
If they don't show up accross platforms its possible this is a font
problem. or its possible that the rendering software doesn't interpret this
unicode feature correctly. .Hans are you experiencing problems going from
Word on Mac to Word on PC, or is it from Word on Mac to publishing software
on Mac or PC, or  something else?
