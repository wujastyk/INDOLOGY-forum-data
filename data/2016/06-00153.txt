It is something else because he is wearing a monks robe.

Betreff: [INDOLOGY] AMARAVATI STUPA

 


I saw this piece of sculpture curved out on the outer circumbualatory wall of the Amaravati Stupa , in Andhra Prdesh ,( 45 km from Vijaywada) India when I visited it in 2014. 

I would like to know whether the incident refers to the event of MahaNishkraamana in the life of Siddhartha Gautam Buddha when he decided to renounce this mundane world , with his kins and near ones wailing to desist him from doing so, or is it somethimg else ?
