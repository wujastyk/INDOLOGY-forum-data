[INDOLOGY] by chance, accidentally
Interesting question. In the Maha-bharata, for example, human effort ? purusha-kAra ? is contrasted with daiva ? providence/divine intervention or will. In Bhagavad-gita 9.10, we find the statement that ?Prakrti begets?by my supervision/oversight (adhy-aksha)." In the Gita 13.21, and elsewhere, we find a two part concept of causality that matches the twin ontology of body and soul. Not to speak of the philosophical implications of karma.
These are well known approaches to causality.
I am also curious to know to what extent Indian tradition has considered pure chance, sometimes called yadRcchA, or adverbially akasmAt, to be a legitimate cause of events or conditions in this world.
