Dear Friends, I think the aorist also imparts a kind of archaic/?r?a-ic
feel in these kinds of contexts. It's obvious how this would be relevant
for the first verse of all poetry right? And as Michael pointed out, it's
not so rare in classical Sanskrit. It just comes across as a little fancy.
Best,J
