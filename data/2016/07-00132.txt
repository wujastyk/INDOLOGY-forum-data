[INDOLOGY]  Unicode Devanagari on Mac
Dear Friends,
I have developed a software to type IAST/Devan?gar? on a Mac. The software
happens to also support Unicode Br?hm? output (currently well supported in
Pages) and also limited support for typing Vedic accents (to be expanded in
a future version).
I am happy to share the beta with Indology and would appreciate feedbacks
in case you try it out.
You can download the latest beta here:

The final version will be ready in <4 weeks.
Kindest Wishes,
Martin Gluckman
