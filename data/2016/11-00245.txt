The Solar Altar
The solar altar called Saura pitha in agamic texts is in the form of a full
blown lotus on a square pedestal in two tiers. The upper tier carries eight
deities portrayed at eight directions. They are considered the eight
planets, which, including the central lotus representing Surya (sun)
constitute the Navagrahas, (nine planets) worshipped by the Hindus for the
bestowal of good fortune and the removal of obstacles. The lower tier is
modelled as a chariot with wheels on either side, drawn by seven horses.
Aruna the Charioteer of Surya is shown driving the horses. The seven horses
are said to represent the seven days of the week. The wheels are ornamented
with twelve petals, representing the twelve months of a year. At the
corners are seen flying celestials, gandharvas carrying flower garlands.
The Agamic texts specify the worship of Surya in the form of a lotus altar.
Evidently this is a representation of Saura pitha, solar altar, intended
for daily worship. This elegant piece is also decidedly a Chalukyan
sculpture, probably brought here as a war trophy. In recent years, it has
assumed great significance as a large number of devotees worship it as
Navagraha for the fulfillment of their vows. When the planet Saturn changes
its position once in 27 months, nearly a million people offer worship to
this altar.
Rajendra Chola-I (1012-1044 A.D) is also called Gangaikonda Cholan . (
