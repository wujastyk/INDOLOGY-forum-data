1) It is not *?lay? v?c? *but *ilay? v?c? *(with the short vowel) in the
commentary by ?r?dhara Sv?m?. The word *il? *with the short vowel is listed
in the sense of speech in the *Amarako?a* (3.3.42). The *Vy?khy?sudh?
*commentary derives
this word not from the root *??* but from the root *il *as:
*ilati. ila utpek?e. igupadha- (3.1.135) iti ka?.*

2) The usage *ailata* (P??inian form is ai??a) is also found in
the Adhy?tmar?m?ya?a:
*utth?ya ca punard???v? r?ma? r?j?valocanam?*
*pulak??kitasarv??g? gir? gadgadayailata?*
(1.5.42)
Some manuscripts read *gadgadayai?ayat* instead.
R?mavarm? comments:
*ailata astau??t. ??a stut?vityasm?lla?i vyatyayena ?apo lugabh?va?
?alayoreka?rutitv?llak?rocc?ra?am.*

3) An interesting gloss on *ailata* SB 10.13.64 is offered by the
*Anvit?rthaprak??ik?*, a commentary very well respected in the *kath?*
traditions
in northern India:
*ailata astaut. ??a stutau. ?apo lugabh?va**?ch**?ndasa**?. ?asya lak*
*?ro gadgadabh?v?nukara??rtha?. *

4) The *Amarako?a *lists the word *?lita* (3.1.109) in the sense of
praised. The *Vy?khy?sudh? *commentary says:
*??yate sma. ??a stutau. kta? (3.2.102). ?alayoraiky?dv? la?.*

5) The *Amarako?a *lists the word ?l? (2.8.91) for a small sword. The
*Vy?khy?sudh? *commentary gives the second explanation as:
*??yate v?. ??a stutau. ?alayorekatvam.*
