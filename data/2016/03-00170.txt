The Bhagavata-purana 4.20.13-14 speaks symbolically of time as 360 white Gandharvas (the days of the year) and 360 black Gandharvis (the nights), who all plunder the city of Puranjana.

The idea of the spokes of the wheel going up and down is referred to in Sanskrit lit in many places with expressions like cakra-nemi-krama and cakr?rapa?kti.
