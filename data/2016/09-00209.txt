Dear colleagues

I would be very interested in Bapat's article on Narayanabala, too.

Best wishes

Ute Huesken

Dear colleagues,

  Could you help me to obtain PDF copies of the following book and article?


(1) John K. Locke, Buddhist Monasteries of Nepal: A Survey of the Bahas and Bahis of the Kathmandu Valley, Kathmandu 1985: Sahayogi Press.


(2) P.V. Bapat, "Narayanabala," Studia Indologica Internationalia, I. (Poona and Paris, 1954)


"Studia Indologica Internationalia" is an enigma. I have asked colleagues in India, Paris etc., but nobody knows about it. However, it is quoted in old articles.


Many thanks in advance,

Seishi Karashima
