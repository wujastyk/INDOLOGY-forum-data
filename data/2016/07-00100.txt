[INDOLOGY] Metrical question (arya)
Namo v?ttavidvadbhya?:
Balabhadra's /H?yanaratna /contains the following quotation from an 
astrological work no longer extant:
/sa?t?pa-sahamam aharni?am indor mand?nta? ?a??hata? p?ta? |//
/
'The /sahama /of affliction by day and night is [the distance] from the 
moon up to Saturn; the casting out is [done] from the sixth.'
Ignoring the technical content for the present, I am puzzled by the 
metre. All other quotations from the same work are in ?ry?, and the 
present half-stanza looks like it too, except for the initial word 
(/sa?t?pa-/). Is there a variant of ?ry? that would allow for these 
extra 5 morae? All the mss of the /H?yanaratna /available to me agree on 
the reading.
