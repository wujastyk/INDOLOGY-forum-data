Thanks very much Peter--both the 2nd and "3rd" edition links you provided seem to be in good shape.
For others who might need to know,

Someone kindly uploaded a scanned pdf, etc., of Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar to Archive.org.
Pages 237-242 are missing (and other pages are quite dark)
Might someone have access to a clean, complete copy and be able to re-upload it?
There is more than one copy of Whitney's Grammar on Archive.org, some examples:
The first edition  (1879):
A Sanskrit grammar : including both the classical language, and the older dialects, of Veda and Brahmana / by William Dwight Whitney. - Leipzig : Breitkopf and H?rtel, 1879. - (Bibliothek indogermanischer Grammatiken ; 2)
The German translation by Heinrich Zimmer (also 1879):
A "3rd edition":
A Sanskrit grammar : including both the classical language, and the older dialects, of Veda and Brahmana / by William Dwight Whitney. - 3rd ed. - Leipzig : Breitkopf & H?rtel ; Boston : Ginn, 1896.
A reprint of the 2nd edition:
Sanskrit grammar : including both the classical language, and the older dialects, of Veda and Brahmana / by William Dwight Whitney. - 7th issue of the 2nd ed. - Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1950
and so on.
So all you need to do is to search for other copies on Archive.org.
Hope it helps
