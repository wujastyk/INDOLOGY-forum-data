One the page https://www.academia.edu/9605724/LubinEasyUnicode_keymap under the title, next to my name, under the word FILES, there are some little arrowheads ? hover over those, or click on them, and you will see two files: the PDF of the map (which shows on the page anyway) and the keylayout file.  If you choose that file, it ought to download automatically or at least prompt you to do so.

George,

Andrew Glass?s Gandhari Unicode includes the Vedic accented transliteration characters ? I have used these for years:

If you use a Mac, you can also find a link to my customized keylayout file, and a keyboard map here (it includes characters for Tamil and Old Javanese as well):

Dear List,
.
For the time being, I am obliged to use a computer that does not have  a font for accented Vedic text in transliteration.  Can someone send me such a font so that I can submit a paper before an upcoming deadline?  I would be very, very grateful.

With thanks in advance,

George Thompson
