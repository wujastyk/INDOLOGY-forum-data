Subject: [INDOLOGY] Authenticity of the Vastusutra Upanishad

Arlo Griffiths *The Atharvaveda and its Paippal?da??kh?* Aachen 2007 p.145
states against my adverse remarks on the commentary and of M. Asher (JAOS
104 [1984], 599f.,) on the ?entire text? as mentioned by Griffiths (*loc
cit*), that his sources confirm that ?at least a text of this name has been
in circulation?
