Monier Williams has errors. An example is meaning of the gav? as an
?independent word? for speech and the citation of ?i?up?lavadha 2-68 which
is incorrect. In this case (?lips??) there is no precise citation also.
The etymology (yoga) of ?lips?? (?labdhum icch??, labh + san + a + ??p)
does not suggest any intensity in the desire. If one wants to go for usage
(r??hi), it is better to cross-check with Sanskrit Ko?a-s and attested
usages than take M-W for granted.
As per Amarako?a (1-7-27,28), there is a clear distinction between ?lips??
which is listed with words for desire, and ?l?las?? which is explained as
intense desire or longing (grammar would confirm this):
???????????????????????. dohadam
icch? k??k?? sp?heh? t??v??ch? lips? manoratha?
k?mo?bhil??astar?a?ca *so?tyartha? l?las? dvayo?*
The Vy?khy?sudh? on above verses explains that the first twelve are
synonyms of ?icch?? (and also ) and the word ?l?las?? is a synonym of
?atipr?ti?
If any other authentic Ko?a or commentary on a K?vya usage confirms that
?longing? or ?intense desire? is also a meaning of ?lips??, M-W can be
accepted. Same for ?bubhuk???.
