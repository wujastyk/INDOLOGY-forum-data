Subject: [INDOLOGY] aja as ajaya?
Message-ID: <CAPAZekYyNGBbkLb29_ZH0UuXGtOPha=cKyQATZOu4jMecr6Qpw@mail.gmail.com>

A question to all,


The name *aja* occurs in a listing of the kings of ?ambhala quoted in the
*Vimalaprabh?* commentary on the *K?lacakra-tantra*. As the name of a
bodhisattva king I have not taken *aja* in its meaning ?goat,? but rather
in its meaning ?unborn.? However, two different pairs of early translators
have translated it into Tibetan as ?unconquerable? or ?unconquered? (*rgyal
dka?*, *ma pham pa*), as if the word was *ajaya* (or *ajita*) rather than
*aja*. This, of course, is a more appropriate meaning for the name of a
king; but the form *aja* is unanimously confirmed in multiple witnesses and
also in a different location in the *Vimalaprabh?*. So the question is: Is
there any way to derive *aja* from the root *ji*, ?to conquer,? rather than
from the root *jan*, ?to be born,? in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit
grammar, whether the *A???dhy?y?* of P??ini, the *C?ndra-vy?kara?a*, the
*K?tantra*, the *S?rasvata-vy?kara?a*, or any other Sanskrit grammar?


Details: The full listing can be found in ?The Lost K?lacakra M?la Tantra
on the Kings of ?ambhala,? where *aja?* occurs in the verse that I have
arbitrarily numbered 17 for convenience of reference:
