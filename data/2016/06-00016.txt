[INDOLOGY] Caste system and Buddhism
The legends of the "evil king" Glang-dar-ma and his assassination by the Buddhist monk
Lha-lung Dpal-gyi-rdo-rje are probably late (11th c.), but Dan is quite right about the
way in which the supposed murder was justified. This was very well known in Tibet and,
in the same vein, as Holmes Welch has shown, the Tibetan president of the Chinese Buddhist
Association during the 50s and early 60s, Geshe Sherab Gyatso, used the same "exceptions"
warranted by the bodhisattva vow to justify some of the excesses of Maoist policy.
