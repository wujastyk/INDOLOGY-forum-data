Dear Joanna,
Thank you for sharing with us this extremely valuable contribution to Vedic
Studies!  Congratulations on the publication of your latest book, which
continues the work of *Fire and Cognition in the ?gveda*.  Reading *Fire,
Death and Philosophy* has been both enjoyable and illumining.
With all good wishes,
