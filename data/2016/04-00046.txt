[INDOLOGY] Misunderstood origins
Well, Dominik, yes, it *is* more stable, though perhaps no more 'real' than
without DOI that could as easily disappear tomorrow. As long as we still
have printed books (which thank heaven I guess will stay around at least
during my lifetime, however much of that is left), the presumption is that
a reader interested in tracking the reference should be able to see exactly
what the citer saw. With ephemeral web materials that is simply not true --
as you of course know very very well, so I presume that you might have been
'trolling' a bit to start a discussion? ;)
