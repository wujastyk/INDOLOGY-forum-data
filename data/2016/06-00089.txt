There is also a passage in Pata?jali about the physical characteristics of a Brahmin (tawny hair etc.). I cannot remember the reference, but perhaps Madhav Deshpande or someone can give the reference.

Vincent Eltschinger?s ? Caste ? et philosophie bouddhique (Vienna 2000) seems relevant in this connection. An English version of this book is also available:

Many thanks to the originator of this thread!

Right now, I just want to register the fact that I?m very much interested in this topic.

Last year (May 2015), I had a publication (in Tamil) about references to, or a lack there of, ?j?ti? and ?caste? (as we understand it today) in Old Tamil literature/grammar, also known as Sangam literature/grammar.

I don?t know how many of you are aware of the fact that the English word ?caste? has its origin in the Portuguese word ?casta,? which was first recorded in Arte da Lingua Malabar written by Fr. Henrique Henriques in the mid-16th century.

If one wants to dig deep into the understanding of the terms such as ?j?ti? and ?caste? ? one has to have a minimal understanding of the origins of the Western contact with India, which happened in the early 16-th century through Portuguese arrival in South India.

Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam

?Dear Don,

This interests me a lot, and I'd be grateful to read what you might write about it in future.  It's on my back-burner, but I've long wondered whether Sanskritic narratives about jati and varna can be thought about in ways similar to eighteenth and nineteenth century European narratives about races and species.  Were people of different varnas formally considered to be of different "species?"   It's a bit shocking to think in these terms, but I've been wondering about it.  If you ever put flesh on these bones, one way or another, or can point me to existing discussions on this, I'd be really interested.

Best,
Dominik

Dear Colleagues,

I would be grateful for additional references to an argument mentioned in Jayanta Bhatta?s ?gama?ambara 4.143-4 (in Dezso?s edition in the Clay series).  The question is whether the j?ti of Brahmins, etc. is like the j?ti of cow-ness, etc. in being empirically observable or directly perceivable.  Jayanta refers to those who say that verbal/textual testimony alone (?abdam?tre?a) establishes the four-var?a system.  This prefigures an argument made in Vij??ne?vara?s Mit?k?ar? (on Yaj 1.90) where the same distinction is drawn to refute an objection.

I assumed Jayanta would have made a similar argument in his Ny?yama?jar?, but I have not been able to locate it (probably because I barely know the Ny?ya literature).  If anyone could point me toward other instances of this issue, whether in original sources or contemporary research, I?d appreciate it.

Best,
