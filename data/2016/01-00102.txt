Dear colleagues,
I seem to encounter the word v?rja in the meaning 'lotus' in an 8th-century Sanskrit inscription. I don't find any entry v?rja in the usual dictionaries. However, I do find it in Narahari's R?janigha??u (10.173):
p?thoja? kamala? nabha? ca nalin?mbhoj?mbujanm?mbuja? 
?r?padm?mburuh?bjapadmajalaj?ny ambhoruha? s?rasam |
pa?keja? saras?ruha? ca ku?apa? p?thoruha? pu?kara? 
v?rja? t?marasa? ku?e?ayakaje ka?j?ravinde tath? ||
This is from GRETIL: I am unable to check any printed edition. But the meter (??rd?lavikr??ita) seems to guarantee that v?rja? here is not a typo for v?rija? (on which, see Rau, 'Lotusblumen', 1954, p. 510). According to C. Vogel, Indian Lexicography (1979), pp. 376-7, this R?janigha??u would be no older than 1375.
Does anyone know a first-millennium attestation of v?rja- 'lotus'?
Is it more likely that we confront here a phonetic development from v?rija-, or the use of the Vedic stem v?r- in a post-Vedic compound v?r-ja-?
Thank you for any comments and further references.
