[INDOLOGY] Eating flesh of a jogi, a magician, a healer
?The meaning of cannibalism is that , by consuming your enemy , you inherit
his powers. In ?The Story of the Grandmother? , a folk version of ?Little
Red Riding Hood? the girl eats his grandmother?s flesh and drinks her
blood, which has an ambiguous purpose; she is accused of cannibalism, but a
deeper implication is that she acquires the wisdom of the progenitrix which
helps her trick the wolf/werewolf. This notion of ingesting the older often
took the form of ritual meals. To eat a symbolical figure signified
receiving magical power.?
