[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit dictionaries
A small addition. Pandits did influence the European dictionaries indirectly. Both B?htlingk & Roth and Monier Williams used much the so-called ?Wilson?s dictionary?, which was in fact compiled by a group of Bengali pandits and edited by Wilson. Also Apte used this source ? sometimes he gave its exact wording slightly abridged.
Best,
