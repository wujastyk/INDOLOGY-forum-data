Subject: [INDOLOGY] Epigraphic Discoveries in East Pakistan

Dear Members,
could someone provide me with a digital copy of Sircar's Epigraphic 
Discoveries in East Pakistan? The book is supposedly available on DLI, 
so if anyone has a saved copy, sharing it would not breach copyright any 
more than DLI has done. However, at least presently, dli.gov.in draws a 
blank when I try to access the book, while dli.ernet.in offers a pdf 
which begins downloading, but never finishes.
Thank you,
Daniel
