=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_pli=C3=A9_squat?=
Thanks Nagaraj. I know that *arrai mandi* is not Sanskrit, and that it also
doesn't 1:1 match the position or movement of the pli? squat. Might you be
able to offer a more appropriate Sanskrit term for this dance-like pli?
position? I've been looking in yog?sana encyclopedias and websites and not
found anything even close, apart from m?l?sana
<http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/learn-malasana/>, which is
nothing like a pli? squat.
