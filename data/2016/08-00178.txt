Greetings,

        The Bh?gavatam 10.13.64 states that catur-mukha Brahm? ?praised [K???a] with words of praise.? The Sanskrit here is ?ailata ?lay?.?

        Under ?l or ?l?, MW refers us to ??. Although MW does not give ?l? or any verb forms of ?l as a form of ?? (there is another ?l given in the causative, ?layati, ?to move?), it seems safe to take both ailata and ?lay? as derived from ?l as an alternate form of ??. Similarly ?r?dhara Sv?m? in his commentary glosses the words as follows: ?lay? v?c?, ailata astaut.

        Question: how common in Sanskrit literature are derivates of ?l as a form of ??.

        Thanks,

 

1) It is not ?lay? v?c? but ilay? v?c? (with the short vowel) in the commentary by ?r?dhara Sv?m?. The word il? with the short vowel is listed in the sense of speech in the Amarako?a (3.3.42). The Vy?khy?sudh? commentary derives this word not from the root ?? but from the root il as:

ilati. ila utpek?e. igupadha- (3.1.135) iti ka?.

 

2) The usage ailata (P??inian form is ai??a) is also found in the Adhy?tmar?m?ya?a:

utth?ya ca punard???v? r?ma? r?j?valocanam?

pulak??kitasarv??g? gir? gadgadayailata?

(1.5.42)

Some manuscripts read gadgadayai?ayat instead.

R?mavarm? comments:

ailata astau??t. ??a stut?vityasm?lla?i vyatyayena ?apo lugabh?va? ?alayoreka?rutitv?llak?rocc?ra?am.

 

3) An interesting gloss on ailata SB 10.13.64 is offered by the Anvit?rthaprak??ik?, a commentary very well respected in the kath? traditions in northern India:

ailata astaut. ??a stutau. ?apo lugabh?va?ch?ndasa?. ?asya lak?ro gadgadabh?v?nukara??rtha?. 

 

4) The Amarako?a lists the word ?lita (3.1.109) in the sense of praised. The Vy?khy?sudh? commentary says:

??yate sma. ??a stutau. kta? (3.2.102). ?alayoraiky?dv? la?.

 

5) The Amarako?a lists the word ?l? (2.8.91) for a small sword. The Vy?khy?sudh? commentary gives the second explanation as:

??yate v?. ??a stutau. ?alayorekatvam.
