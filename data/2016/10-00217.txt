It is used in some Indian languages like Telugu in the form of nagaaraa.

It is a drum only. It is a big/huge D shaped drum with the curve part of
the D shape downwards. The top part is the sounding part. Made to sound
with the help of two very big sticks.

Not a 'musical instrument' though. It was used on the terraces of fort
entrances its sound indicating several different announcements: exits and
entries of kings, victories of kings, beginnings of events in the fort etc.
