[INDOLOGY] Help with PDF files
Dear colleagues,
  Could you help me to obtain PDF copies of the following book and article?
(1) John K. Locke, *Buddhist Monasteries of Nepal: A Survey of the Bahas
and Bahis of the Kathmandu Valley*, Kathmandu 1985: Sahayogi Press.
(2) P.V. Bapat, "Narayanabala," Studia Indologica Internationalia, I.
(Poona and Paris, 1954)
"Studia Indologica Internationalia" is an enigma. I have asked colleagues
in India, Paris etc., but nobody knows about it. However, it is quoted in
old articles.
Many thanks in advance,
Seishi Karashima
