Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with PDF files

Dear colleagues,

  Could you help me to obtain PDF copies of the following book and article?


(1) John K. Locke, *Buddhist Monasteries of Nepal: A Survey of the Bahas
and Bahis of the Kathmandu Valley*, Kathmandu 1985: Sahayogi Press.


(2) P.V. Bapat, "Narayanabala," Studia Indologica Internationalia, I.
(Poona and Paris, 1954)


"Studia Indologica Internationalia" is an enigma. I have asked colleagues
in India, Paris etc., but nobody knows about it. However, it is quoted in
old articles.


Many thanks in advance,

Seishi Karashima
