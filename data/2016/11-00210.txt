[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
Patrick,
attitudes toward 'vedic maths'. Most people, and to be honest I include
myself in this group, seem unable to clearly articulate what this type of
maths is meant to be, and how it is any different from 'maths'.
Do you have and take to your interlocutors the speed math techniques book
called 'Vedic Maths" the 'Vedic' of which is already dead horse or the
maths in books like s'ulba sutras, Chandas  etc. ? If you have the latter
in mind , maths in s'ulba sutras , for example, is called Vedic because it
is Maths related to Vedic rituals of yajna; maths in Chandas is called
'Vedic' because it is related to the science of metres (meters) in the
Vedas.
