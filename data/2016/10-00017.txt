[INDOLOGY] Roque Mesquita (1937-2016)
This is quite distressing news. I knew Roque and his family from the mid-1970s, and the last time they had us over to their home was in 2001. He was already sick when I visited Vienna a few years ago and could not meet him. He was a kind and generous person and a fine scholar. We will miss him.
