[INDOLOGY] PDF request: HOLY WARRIORS: A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF SOME BIOGRAPHIES OF SAINTS AND KINGS IN THE CLASSICAL INDIAN TRADITION
Dear List,
I would like to ask if anyone has perhaps the PDF of the article by Phyllis
Granoff *HOLY WARRIORS: A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF SOME BIOGRAPHIES OF SAINTS
AND KINGS IN THE CLASSICAL INDIAN TRADITION*?
I would be very grateful for help.
Best regards,
Olga Nowicka
