Dear Dr. Karp,

I attempted to post this message to Indology last night in response to your
query, but I don't think it worked.  Please find it reproduced below.

Dear Colleagues,

Fascinating conversation.  It reminds me of a story in the Mah?vastu
(Jones' translation attached) on a similar theme: the triumph of
hospitality over miserliness with food.  In this case the brahman (named
Kau?ika) is the Buddha in a past life, but the situation is the same.
Similar too is the fact that the guests are merely the gods testing the
brahman's virtue.

A series of guests (gods in disguise) come to Kau?ika to ask for food, but
Kau?ika replies each time:

n?ha? kri??mi n?pi vikri??mi na c?pi me sannidhi asti ki?cit* /
par?ttar?pa? mama bhojana? ima? sy?m?kaprastha? nalam e?o duvinna? //
(Senart, 2.49)

"I neither buy nor yet do I sell.  I have no store of food at all.  The
food I have is scanty; 'tis but a small measure of grain and not enough for
two." (Jones, 2.47)

And the recurring response of the guest is (in part):

natv?ha? kau?ika br?mi bhu?j?hi ca dad?hi ca /
?ryam?rgasam?panno ek???a? vindate sukha? // (Senart, 2.50)

"I tell you, Kau?ika, to eat only after sharing.  Thus will you enter on
the noble path.  He finds no happiness who lives for himself." (Jones, 2.47)

Eventually, when the gods reveal themselves, Kau?ika is "converted" to this
dharma, expressed thus:

e?o adyaiva? kari?y?mi pu?ya? d?sy?mi d?na? ?rama?abr?hma?e?u /
etehi dady?d aham annap?na? n?ha? adattv? am?ta? pi p?sye //
eva? ca me dadato sarvak?la? bhog? ca me ca sarv? k?ipihanti /
tato aha? sugati? pravraji?ya? prah?ya k?m?ni tath?dhik?ni // (Senart, 2.53)

"Now this very day I shall begin to live a life of virtue and make gifts to
br?hmans and recluses.  I shall give them meat and drink.  I would not even
drink ambrosia without first sharing it.
"As I thus give at all times, all my wealth will soon be spent.  Hence I
shall pass to a state of bliss, having cast away these inordinate desires
of mine." (Jones, 2.50)

Food for thought....

Dear Nagaraj,

Motive and method.

motive: atithi-seva ---> if selfless, ultimate Liberation; method:
bubhukSAjaya (bubhukSA with its load of feelings/emotions - put in there in
the process of its formation as a *desiderative* derivate)

Would *THAT* make sense?
