[INDOLOGY] Frits Staal's last visit to the US
Dear List,
I am finishing up an introduction to the long-delayed memorial to Frits
that I've been working on.  I want to talk about what I think was Frits's
last visit to the US.  I know that he visited Harvard and Yale where we had
symposia in his honor. He also was celebrated in New York and, of course,
Berkeley.  Can anyone who attended any of these events remind me of the
dates?
Thank you,
George Thompson
