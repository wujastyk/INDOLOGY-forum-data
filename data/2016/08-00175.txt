[INDOLOGY] aja as ajaya?
My sincere thanks to all who responded to my question, on and off list.
Each reply was helpful, and much appreciated. Perhaps we do have to think
that aja was used in a non-standard way in this text, as Matthew suggested,
and is in fact equivalent to ajaya/ajita here.
With thanks to all and best regards,

P. S. Sorry for my typos, inconquerable for unconquerable, and ?r?palo for
?r?p?lo.
