Thank you very much for your observations. I have not been aware of the
variations on the concept of yama/niyama in Puranas and later Yogic texts,
it is most interesting.
The subject of difference in "niyama" regulations for ascetics at different
stages in Kau??inya's theory is quite interesting. Kau??inya himself
considers it a peculiar trait of the system, or scripture ("tantra"). At
the same time, a similar differentiation of niyama rules seems to be
accepted by some early Naiy?yikas, who otherwise seem to follow quite
closely the theory of Pata?jali (with regard to the practice of Yoga).
Even though it seems true, that Ny?ya came under influence of P??upata
authors at some point, this idea of differentiation of niyamas is hinted at
even in V?tsy?yana's Bh??ya--which was written too early to speak about
P??upata influence, I think. Hence the search for other possible sources of
this peculiar variation.
With best wishes,
Rafal
