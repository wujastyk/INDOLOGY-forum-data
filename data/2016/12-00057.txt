[INDOLOGY] Sri Lankan epigraphy query
Dear All,
Thank you very much for your responses. Much material can be found out there but there?s still much to find, of course.
It was great to chat albeit briefly with some of you. I will hopefully be at the upcoming AOS and IABS conferences in the Spring and Fall respectively and would love to meet and/or catch up.
For now, safe travels and happy holidays.
Cheers,
M
