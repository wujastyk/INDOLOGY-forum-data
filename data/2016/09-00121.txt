It may seem a quibble, but isn't the
Prak?taprakasa's author making an assertion, not giving an explanation?  To me, at least, there's an important difference.

The
Prak?taprakasa has the rule (8.25)

??ha-dhya-gana? ?ha?a-jha?a-ga?a?
(????-????-????? ???-???-????)

which explains Sanskrit dhya changing to jha?a. Hence

dhyayanti -> jhaanti
dhyana -> jha?a

The Abhidhanarajendra? has a rather long entry under jha?a. It also derives the word from dhyana and cites the rule sadhyasadhyahya? jha? instead, which I believe is from Hemacandra's grammar.

Hope this helps, Nityananda

Of late I am vividly going through a very old translation of a book on Abhidhamma Buddhist philosophy .It is difficult to gather the name of the translator.However,in course of the book I came across an analysis found in the book 'VishuddhiMagga'by BuddhaGhosha which uses a term 'Jhana'while describing the 3 -levels of consciousness .Jhana has been used while elaborating on the 2nd level of consciousness ,where the Yogachara( i.e the bhikhhu who delves into Yoga) meditates on an object abd finally attains Jhana.

Can anybody enlighten on the implication of the term Jhana and it's etymology.

ALAKENDU DAS.
