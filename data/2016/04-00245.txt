[INDOLOGY] Eating flesh of a jogi, a magician, a healer
Dear Nagaraj,
First - its really gratifying to find here someone of matching research
interests.
I don't seem to be able to find Richard Temple's "Legends" on Archive.org.
My advanced age?
Could you, please, send me the link to the "Legends"?
You may, perhaps and hopefully, want to read my already oldish (1981) paper
on "Reward and Punishment in Indian Folk-tales",
