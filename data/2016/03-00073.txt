Subject: [INDOLOGY] Epigraphia Andhrica volume I
Message-ID: <DUB114-W7367FE2431979E9D0BE4C8A5B30@phx.gbl>

Dear colleagues,

I am having trouble laying my hands on volume I of Epigraphia Andhrica. I don't find this specific volume on Archive.org, and it seems to be absent from French libraries.

Would anyone be able to furnish me a scan of the whole volume, or else of the article on the Kesanapalli inscription that should be contained in it, around p. 146?

Thank you.
