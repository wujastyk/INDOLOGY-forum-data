[INDOLOGY] Georges Dumezil's Tripartite Ideology text
I also ltook the opportunity to rethink some Dumeziliana in "The
Mahabharata and the Stories Some People Tell About It," in Exemplar: The
Journal of South Asian Studies,' Part 1, Vol. 1 No 2 (2012), pp. 2-26 , and
Part 2, Vol. 2, No. 1 (2013), pp. 1-13 (see especially pp. 3-4).
