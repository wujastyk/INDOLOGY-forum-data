Dear Members,

I am posting this query to help a private collector. This golden medallion
comes from Pyu (ancient Burma). Is anyone able to provide some insights on
the two scripts involved? Unfortunately, I am not able to give more infos,
but the Buddhist theme of the engraving is rather certain. Herewith the
link to the images. Thank you!
