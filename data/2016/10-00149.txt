[INDOLOGY] Obituary notice for Prof. K. Mahadeva Sastri
Sad to know.
He was a combination of the rigors of both traditional and modern
scholarship.
I met him whenever I stayed on Sri Krishnadevaraya University campus in the
house of Prof. Salaka Raghunatha Sarma , a great scholar of Sanskrit and
classical Telugu, now staying at Rajahmundry.
He was a combination of gAmbhIrya and priyabhAshaNa.
In days when study of classical Telugu particulary from the perspective of
linguistics is decreasing , this is a great loss.
Om S'Antiss'Antiss'Antiss'Antih.
