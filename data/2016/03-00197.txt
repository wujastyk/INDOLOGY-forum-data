Thank you, Prof. Ryan, Prof. Deshpande, and Prof. Cardona for your
responses. I had been travelling and so could not respond earlier.
Here are some quick comments.
1) ??u?r??am???n?m? is certainly a digitization error. The reading in
Bh?gavata Pur??a 1.1.13 is ??u?r??am???n?m? with the palatal  ???. The
?tmanepada is from ?j???rusm?d???? sana?? (A 1.3.57).
2) The RV example of ?aju?ran? is a non-Paninian form, the Paninian form
being ?aju?anta? from the root ?ju?? pr?tisevanayo?? (DP 1288). The two
non-Paninian features are the ?ru?? augment and the use of ?parasmaipada?.
S?ya??c?rya explains the ?parasmaipada? by ?vyatyaya? (which would refer to
?vyatyayo bahulam?, A 3.1.85), and the ?ru?? by ?bahula? chandasi? (which
would specifically be the rule 7.1.8). I have attached the snaps of the
mantra and the commentary (Vaidic Samshodhan Mandal, 1935, Volume I).
3) I have not had the opportunity to cross-check the cited examples against
published editions the ?atapatha Br?hma?a, hence I cannot comment on them
now.
4) In a word boundary, a final ??? cannot occur in the Paninian system due
to ?jhal?? ja?o'nte? (A 8.2.39) which will change a terminal ??? to a ???
Most likely, the examples of ??r? do not occur in the Paninian system.
My interest to trace an attested form was partly because I wanted to see
how the conjunct was printed in old books. It appears that the printing
press where the Vaidic Samshodhan Mandal book was printed did not have a
printing block for the glyph ??r? (quite possible given the conjunct is so
rarely attested). The ?r? hook was put below the glyph for ???, which is
unexpected: given the similarities between the glyphs for ?p? and  ???, one
would expect the glyph for ??r? to be similar to that of ?pr?, with a
slanting diagonal line as seen in modern fonts. Perhaps manuscripts of RV
would need to be seen to ascertain how the glyph was actually written by
scribes before the use of printing presses in India.
Thanks, Nityanand
