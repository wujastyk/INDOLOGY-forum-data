Dear list members

On Friday, the OPEN weekly magazine carried a review of *The Battle for
Sanskrit* by the Cambridge-educated Indian economist Bibek Debroy (Padma
Shri, Member of NITI Aayog, and translator of the BORI edition of the
*Mahabharata* into English). The review, titled *Home Alone: There is more
to Rajiv Malhotra?s latest book on Sanskrit than the usual Pollock pickle*,
can be read under

Regards, Nityanand
