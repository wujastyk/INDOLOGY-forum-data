There is one occurrence in the Ra?ks?asaka?vya (of Ravideva) stanza 3cd :

abda? sit?bhir asita? ?abala? khag?bhir v?rjai? sitair iva vibh?ti vana? prabuddhai? |

(note that in stanza 14, v?rja? is also with the meaning of jalaja? but not for the lotus this time) 
 
On the pre-1000 AD date of the text, cf.
P. K. Gode,  "Date of Ra?ks?asa Ka?vya or Ka?vyara?ks?asa ? Before A.D. 1000", In: Studies in Indian Literary History vol. 1, pp. 195-202;
orig. publ. in Journal of Indian History, Madras, vol. 19/3, 1940 pp. 312-319

+ Indology list in last October for more references.

Note that the va?r- stem, even if a bit archaic, is nor less classical than the use of n?- : both are given as paradigms in traditional manuals like the Siddhar?pam (cf. also in Hanxleden's Grammatic Grandonica) and also used in yamaka poems by V?sudeva (the possible son of Ravideva, both probably poets at the court of the Cera Perumals of Mahodayapuram in the 9th-10th centuries AD).

Best wishes,

Dear colleagues,

I seem to encounter the word v?rja in the meaning 'lotus' in an 8th-century Sanskrit inscription. I don't find any entry v?rja in the usual dictionaries. However, I do find it in Narahari's R?janigha??u (10.173):

p?thoja? kamala? nabha? ca nalin?mbhoj?mbujanm?mbuja? 
?r?padm?mburuh?bjapadmajalaj?ny ambhoruha? s?rasam |
pa?keja? saras?ruha? ca ku?apa? p?thoruha? pu?kara? 
v?rja? t?marasa? ku?e?ayakaje ka?j?ravinde tath? ||

This is from GRETIL: I am unable to check any printed edition. But the meter (??rd?lavikr??ita) seems to guarantee that v?rja? here is not a typo for v?rija? (on which, see Rau, 'Lotusblumen', 1954, p. 510). According to C. Vogel, Indian Lexicography (1979), pp. 376-7, this R?janigha??u would be no older than 1375.

Does anyone know a first-millennium attestation of v?rja- 'lotus'?

Is it more likely that we confront here a phonetic development from v?rija-, or the use of the Vedic stem v?r- in a post-Vedic compound v?r-ja-?

Thank you for any comments and further references.
