[INDOLOGY] ISO 15919 description no longer accessible online
Does anyone know who was maintaining the useful pages <http://homepage.ntlworld.com/stone-catend/trind.htm>, and why these are now no longer accessible? It would be nice if they could become accessible again. If, by the way, anyone has the costly pdf published by ISO on this standard, and would be willing to share it, I would be grateful.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
