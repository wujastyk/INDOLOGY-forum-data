[INDOLOGY] Kalapattana, black men, and some medical terms
Many thanks to Dagmar and Dominik Wujastyk for their replies so far. The 
reference to /k????n ... str?pu?so/ in the ??r?gadharasa?hit? is 
interesting. Perhaps I read too much into the expressions /asita-m?nava/ 
and /k???a-manuja/ in the H?yanasundara.
Thank you. I'm still not sure what /bhavati ... chardir apy eti v?ntim/ 
is meant to convey; I'll have to think about it. Any further suggestions 
are most welcome.
Is pitt?tis?ra normally found in the plural? And is the condition 
considered to cause stomach pain? (/Bhavati ja?hara??la? 
k?sapitt?tis?rai[?]/.)
Right. The form used in the text is k?mala (as required by the metre). 
But I am not sure about dadrut? (leprosy?). If pittak?mala is one 
condition, and dadrut? another, one would have expected the dual (-te), 
but the witnesses all read -t? or -t??. On the other hand, the text is 
often somewhat ungrammatical (but syntactically rather than 
morphologically).
Best wishes,
Martin
