Without examining the actual content of ?Vedic astrology", I believe this discussion may become completely misguided. If one talks about the lunar astrology ?hinted at? in the Ved??gajyoti?a, indeed Vedic astrology seems the correct term. From the extant materials, this form of Vedic astrology based on 27/28 nak?atra-s was practiced by the Buddhists and Jains. By the time of Var?hamihira, only remnants survived as collected in the B?hatsa?hit?.
As far as I can tell, what is referred to ?Vedic astrology? refers actually to Greco-Indian horoscopy. Not only does it have little in common with the older ?Vedic astrology?, the way it was conceptualized was completely different - it is based on solar motion, using zodiac, planets and planetary relation, concepts which are absent and foreign in the Vedic corpus. Unless one stretches the definition of Vedic to cover everything under the Indian civilization, ?Vedic astrology? as such is a pure misnomer. No scholars on jyoti?a would commit such travesty, from Kane, PV Sarma to Pingree.
