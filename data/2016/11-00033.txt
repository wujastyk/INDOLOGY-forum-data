[INDOLOGY] Lexicographic order / sentence boundaries
Dear Friends,
I am afraid that perhaps my intention has been misinterpreted: I do not
know Dr Dimitrov's relevant work, and did not know the paper by Dr
Stache-Weiske, and did not intend to imply that the Zgusta paper was the
final word, only that the reliance of MW on PW--whatever the details may
be--has been discussed.
I apologize that I seem to have stirred up a hornet's nest, without
intending to do so.
