[INDOLOGY] How bhagavAn is written in devanagari manuscripts and printed editions
Thank you for this Nityanand,
I've gone back and rechecked the texts in the Muktabodha Digital library
and the pattern in both printed editions and in manuscripts appears to be
spaces after bhagavAn if followed by a consonent and no space if followed
by a vowel.  This appears in printed editions, manuscripts from NGMCP , IFP
paper transcripts and even in the few transcriptions from grantha script I
checked.
My quick check included
ahirbudhnya saMhita vol. 1 and 2 printed editions
AgamakalpalatA  ngmcp manuscript
agamaprAmAnyA printed edition
Anandatantra IFP transcript
ASTaprakaraNa  grantha script printed edtiion
IzAnazIvagurudevapaddhati printed edition
IzvarapratyabhijJavimarzinIvyAkhyA  ifp transcript
umAsaMhitA ifp transcript
kamikAgama uttarabhAgA  grantha script printed edition
kamikAgama pUrvabhAga grantha script printed edition  (once space, twice no
space)
karanAgama printed edition
kalasaMkarSinImatatantraTippanI  NGMCP manuscript
Thanks,
