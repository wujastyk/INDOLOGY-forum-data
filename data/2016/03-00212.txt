Dear Colleagues,
With a better connection I discovered that the NPP volume I was looking for is in the Bodleian Library and I obtained a scan of the article in a few hours thanks to the Bodleian's excellent ?Scan and Deliver? service. I have uploaded a copy of it here: http://we.tl/gzrx249pdB .
Yours, with best wishes,
Jim
