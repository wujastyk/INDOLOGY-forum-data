[INDOLOGY] reviews of Malhotra's books
I would be surprised if any of us want to enage him as a fellow scholar. He is simply a piece of contemporary Hindu history, however bizarre and disreputable one may find him. Scholars not inclined to contemporary Hindu affairs may well find little in Malhotra to interest them. 
Best,
Howard
