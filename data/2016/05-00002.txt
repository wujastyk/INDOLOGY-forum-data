[INDOLOGY] M-W Sanskrit-English Dictionary Co-Authors
Unlike Monier-Williams, who has plundered the wealth of Boehtlingk?s (&
Roth?s) PW without proper acknowledgment of the materials on which he had
based his structural rearrangement in the English language, the latter *do
acknowledge all* of their sources and frequently quote them verbatim *in
extenso* ? whence it is called ?Gro?es (big) PW? [1853?75]: more quotes,
less entries compared to ?Kleines (little) pw? [1879?89]: little or no
verbatim quotes, but considerably more entries.
Using pw along with Richard Schmidt?s Supplement (?Nachtr?ge?) [1928] and
Apte's Dictionary (which is truly independent) will yield a maximum of
reliable results.
In the present case the sources of PW/pw were classical Sanskrit
lexicographers, in one case the comparatively late ?abdakalpadruma.
The question can best be answered by consulting PW directly (sources
highlighted in red colour):
k?audraja ? (k?audra *Honig* + ja)  n.  *Wachs*  R??an. im ?kdr. (PW)
k?audraj? ? f. Honigzucker R?jan. 14,133. (pw)
nihi?sana ? (von hi?s mit ni)  n.  *das Morden*  Ak. 2, 8, 2, 81. (PW [+pw])
n?tigho?a ? (n?? + gho?a)  m.  N. des Wagens des B?haspati  Trik. 2, 8, 48.
(PW [+pw])
n?cabhojya ? (n?ca + bho?)  m.  *Zwiebel (die Nahrung gemeiner Leute*)
?abda?. im ?kdr. (PW [+pw])
This is wrong, for it is indeed recorded in PW/pw:
roha?adruma ? m.  *Sandelbaum*  H. 641. Hal?j. 2, 389. (PW [+pw])
This again is inaccurate, first, because the correct entry in MW is
a?sam?la (not a?sam?le), and second, because pw has registered it as a
matter of fact (n. Schulterh?he R?jan.)
I suggest to study first of all the introductions to the works of
Boehtlingk & Roth to form oneself an idea of what exact methods in Sanskrit
lexicography they had employed and who actually had contributed to their
Herculean task.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
