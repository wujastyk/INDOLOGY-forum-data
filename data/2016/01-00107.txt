That is correct, however there is no word called *gav?*. Monier Williams
lists the word and even gives the citation *?i?up?lavadha* 2.68 but he (or
the Pandit he relied on) have clearly erred as ?i?up?lavadha 2.68 has the
samasta form *?e?agav?*. The form *gav?* derives from the affix *?ac* at
the end of a *tatpuru?a *compound by the rule *gorataddhitaluki* (5.4.92)
followed by *eco?yav?y?va?* (6.1.78) and then and then *??p* by the rule
*?i??h??a?dvayasajdaghna?m?tractayap?hak?ha?ka?kvarapa?* (6.4.148). Hence *ahe?
gau? ahigav?*.

Mallin?tha calls the Mah?bh??ya *pannagav?*. This and other references
to Pata?jali as ?e?a one may refer the Prast?van? of
*Adhy?tmar?m?ya?e'p??in?yaprayog????
Vimar?a?*. The relevant pages are attached.
