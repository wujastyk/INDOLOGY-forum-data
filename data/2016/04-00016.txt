[INDOLOGY] Indology and Tibetology to close at the University of Copenhagen
Dear Howard,
the official notification from the University of
Copenhagen governing board
   http://bestyrelse.ku.dk/moeder/moeder2016/bestyrelsesmode-82-b/Pkt.04.01.pdf
contains the following:
   INDOLOGI: Lukkes som fuld BA? og KA?uddannelse,
   men s?ges videref?rt som BA?tilvalg knyttet til
   uddannelsen i Moderne Indien.
   [INDOLOGY: Will be closed as full BA and MA course
   of study, but attempts will be made to continue it
   as a BA elective associated with the Modern India
   course of study.]
Hardly a consolation, and the formulation ?s?ges?
does not inspire confidence in even this much.
All best,
Stefan
