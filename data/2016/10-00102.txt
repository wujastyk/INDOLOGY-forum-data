[INDOLOGY] crossing oceans?
I have seen two interesting works on this topic, Abdhi-Nauy?na-M?m??s? and
Parya?ana-M?m??s?, composed around 1890-1900, that deal with the
contemporary issue of Indians traveling to Europe, during colonial times.
I have these pdfs, and I would be happy to share them with interested
scholars.
