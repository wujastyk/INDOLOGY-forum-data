[INDOLOGY] pAnIya and buDana
In T?jika astrological texts, a certain mathematically derived point or 
'lot' (/sahama/, from Arabic /sahm/) is called /p?n?yap?ta/. The sense 
seems to be 'falling into water', as it is associated with danger from 
water (/p?n?yap?tasahama? kr?rayuta? jalabhaya? karoty abde/), but I 
confess that this use of /p?n?ya/ to refer to water outside the context 
of drinking sounds fairly odd to me (even slangy, though I accept that's 
probably my first- and second-language sensibilities intruding). Can 
anyone tell me how old this wider usage is? It is tempting to think of 
it as a projection of NIA /p?n?/ onto early modern Sanskrit, but 
Moner-Williams seems to suggest that the meaning 'water' (irrespective 
of context?) is found in Manu and the MBh.
On a related note, the text passage quoted above also warns of /bu?ana/ 
(/asta?gate tad??e bu?ana? sy?t/). MW and other dictionaries give the 
meaning 'cover, conceal' (and 'emit, discharge') for the root /bu?/. 
Drowning might be defined as being covered by water, but again, it does 
sound a little odd to me. Has anyone come across a contextually more 
likely meaning of /bu?ana/?
Many thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
