[INDOLOGY] Finding two Puranic slokas
Dear friends,
I am looking for sloka references for the following two Puranic ideas as I
want to go back to the original texts.
1.  Padma Purana sloka which translates to "I dwell not in Vaikuntha, nor
in the heart of yogis, but where my devotees sing."  Anyone know the exact
reference for this one?
2.  Naradiya Purana wherein it states that chanting loudly is much greater
than chanting in silence...
Thank you--any leads are much appreciated!
