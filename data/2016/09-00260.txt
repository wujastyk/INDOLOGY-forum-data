[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Catalogue of Indian Astronomical Instruments A-E
Catalogue of Indian Astronomical Instruments A-E
To:
On the occasion of the Autumnal Equinox (or, rather September Equinox) I
have added the series C (Sanskrit astrolabes with multiple plates), D
(Sanskrit astrolabes with single plates) and E (astrolabes reworked in
Sanskrit) to the online Catalogue.
You may access the Catalogue by visiting my homepage at www.SRSarma.in and
then by clicking on ?Catalogue of Indian Astronomical Instruments? in the
menu.   There you will get an option either to view it online or to
download a pdf file. If you have already downloaded the earlier pdf
version, please replace it with the new one.
Series A-E cover all the known astrolabes produced in India. The next three
series will deal with Celestial Globes, which carry engravings such as the
one below.
