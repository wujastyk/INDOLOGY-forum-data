[INDOLOGY] A font for accented Vedic
Dear List,
.
For the time being, I am obliged to use a computer that does not have  a
font for accented Vedic text in transliteration.  Can someone send me such
a font so that I can submit a paper before an upcoming deadline?  I would
be very, very grateful.
With thanks in advance,
George Thompson
