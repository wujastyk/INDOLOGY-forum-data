[INDOLOGY] chakras and vedic meditation
Dear Patrick,
Possibly of interest if you don't know it already:
Tara Michael, Corps Subtil et Corps Causal: Les Six Cakra et le Kundalini Yoga
(Paris: Le Courrier du Livre, 1979).
Not much in the way of analysis, but an interesting selection of texts on the topic, mostly dated by the author to the
late first millenium.
