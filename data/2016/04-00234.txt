Sankarapuujanam need be taken to be 'a sectarian flavour'. For, Isvara

As Kalidasa says in the invocatory verse of his drama, Vikramorvasiyam,
ved?nte?u yam?hurekapuru?a?vy?pya sthita?rodas? /

Isvara denotes only Siva from the early period. Kalidasa is of the firm 
view that the entire Vedanta corpus (ved?nte?u) proclaims Siva to be the 
highest Reality (puru?a) that pervades all the universe. Kalidasa and 
Patanjali definitely belong to very early period. Thus by 
??v?ra-pra?idh?na it is fully plausible and also possible, that 
Patanjali meant only worship of Siva. And, worshipping a supreme God 
need not be interpreted as ''sectarian''. One cannot ''worship'' a 
supreme reality which is nirguna.
