Re: [INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks
Hi, Jeff:
Long ago, I used to follow my former mentor Wendy Doniger on this.  To
paraphrase her position, Indologists will know what the Sanskrit words
really are, and non-specialists will not care. But, I no longer agree with
this.  For one thing, with the advent of on-line dictionaries, even
non-scholars (or non
?-?
Indological scholars) have the opportunity to look up terms (and without
the diacriticals those without Sanskrit, or those who have lost their
Sanskrit) are
?lost.
  For another, the ease with which diacriticals can be added
?using modern technology ?
makes it inexcusable to leave them out. (In the the 80s, using one of the
first personal word processing systems, I still had to add them in by hand
? for my dissertation?
.)
Last but not least Sanskrit words are not
?"?
Sanskrit
?"?
at all without the diacriticals.  E.g., the letters "?" and "t" are really
not the same
?
and
?mashing them up into
a single "t"
? is nothing more than a misrepresentation, and
not using diacriticals turns the 48 sounds/letters of Sanskrit into
something they are not.
So, yes.  It is distracting
? not to have them?
, a
?n?
d
?I think a lot
 more. I would demand the
?employment of ?
diacriticals of any scholar who uses Sanskrit.
? ?
best,
Herman
