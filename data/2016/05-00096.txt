What is the relation, if any, between the Vastu-sutra Upanishad and the so-called ?Vastu-shastra??

Thanks.

So I tried not to rely only on secondary sources and get deeper in primary sources, but it was a bit frustrating, the contents were kind of unexpected, not exactly what I would have hope to find. On the contrary, the Vastusutra Upanishad suited so well to my European mind that I doubted about its authenticity. I was a beginner and still feel like that after 30 years of research, but now I?ve heard and read that some people actually think that it might be not authentic. Does anybody knows about articles or serious research about it?
