More on Qin. Indeed ?? in all the contexts I know of would refer to ?? Later Qin (384 - 471 CE) and not ? Qin (221 - 207 BC). After all, there is no attestation of the usage of ?? before Later Qin. Another argument against Qin as the source of c?na or any other similar derivations is that the character ? was a voiced sibilant which lost its voicing quite late (Old Chinese: ?in/zin, Middle Chinese: ?jin/zjin). Reconstructions vary among linguists but they all agree on the voicing. The Chinese linguist Zheng-Zhang Shangfang proposed therefore ? Jin (O.C. cinh, M.C. cji?n) as a better candidate. He further pointed out that China was referred to as "sinstan" in Syriac in the famous Nestorian Stele. Just like Greek, there is no unvoiced affricate in Syriac and c became s. Zheng-Zhang's analysis seems attractive to me because this Syriac "sinstan" connects to the very old ????? I referred to earlier (M.C.: cintan).
