[INDOLOGY] the water fowl illusion
Dear James,
It seems that no one knows of the *kalaha?sa-m?y?*. Can you provide the
reference? I assume that you used the 1965 edition of *The Collected Works
of Bu-ston*. I suppose that you meant *sgyu ma* rather than *sgru ma* in *chu
skyar gyi sgru ma*, since you translated it as *m?y?*. But perhaps a
different word is meant. It may be worth checking the two different
manuscripts of Bu ston's annotated edition of the *Vimalaprabh?* in cursive
script that have been published since, for variant readings.
Best regards,
