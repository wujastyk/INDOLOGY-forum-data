[INDOLOGY] Obscure compound
Dear Members of the List,
In a ma?gal? to Sarasvat?, I found the obscure compound ?madhukhallak?sa?gam?? qualifying the Goddess.
Does anyone have an idea on the way to resolve this compound? Especially what is/would be ?khallak??, or ?madhukhallak?"?
Thanks in advance,
F. Voegeli
