[INDOLOGY] amsala
Hello Dermot and Herman,
At least in P??ini's understanding, the words vatsa+la and a?sa+la are
derived respectively in the sense of k?ma "love" and bala "strength,"
s?tra: vats??s?bhy?? k?mabale (P. 5.2.98).  Thus, for P??ini, these words
mean "loving, affectionate" and "strong," respectively.  That meaning for
a?sala would not fit the ?atapatha passage: a?n?my ev?ham a?sala? ced
bhavati, suggesting that the word had some other meaning making the meat
more edible/desirable, and hence "tender" is a likely contextual meaning.
May be "plump, juicy".
