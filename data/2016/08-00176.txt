[INDOLOGY] aja as ajaya?
Just a random idea:
perhaps chu skyes is based on *abja.
Also, at least in some lists (but I admit this is a very problematic
"possibility") jaya is a name for the sun...
Thanks for your interesting questions!
(May I just add here that since my student days I've appreciated the
materials you've made available from a place I had never before heard of,
Talent Oregon? Until it got water damaged by a warehouse that was anything
but 'state of the art' [despite their claim...] I had a lovely reprint, in
library binding, of an old publication on the Madhy?ntavibh?ga and several
other things from you, for which I take the opportunity to publicly thank
you :)
