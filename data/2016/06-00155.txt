[INDOLOGY] AMARAVATI STUPA
I hope I will be excused for saying that I wonder whether this is really
from Amaravati; the condition seems extraordinary without a single even
slight chip. Moreover, the surface, in the photo, looks rather much more
like clay than stone. I may of course be wrong, but I'm suspicious of it
even being old at all.
