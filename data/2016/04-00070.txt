[INDOLOGY] DLI Multiple Listings
Dear Colleagues,
When one sees multiple listings of one and the same publication on the DLI
website, are they different scans of the same book from different sources,
or simply multiple listings of one and the same scan?  What has been
people's experience?  I am asking because some of the scans that I
downloaded are pretty bad.  Is it worth checking other listings of the same
book?
