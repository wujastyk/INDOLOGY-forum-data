[INDOLOGY] Mind and moon
I think it?s meant to be a bit more profound than a verbal similarity - though of course these were widely thought not to be merely coincidental. We find the same correspondence in astrological texts, too, e.g. in Var?hamihira?s B?hajj?taka, Chapter 2 v. 1a, where the seven planets of the ancient world are placed on the macrocosmic man of Time.

The Sun [?Day-maker'] is the self (?tman) of Time, the Moon [?Cool-rayed?] his mind (manas), Mars [?Earth-born?] his courage, Mercury [?Knower?] his speech, Jupiter [?Life?] his knowledge and happiness, Venus [?White One?] his desire, and Saturn [?Son of the Lord of Day?] his suffering.
The Moon has a very important place in Indian astrology, but here perhaps it is regarded as representing a less profound (because more changeable?) level of being than the Sun.
