Dear All,

A colleague of mine, who is not a List member, Prof. Doris M. Srinivasan, asks the following question on the part of a recent?Harvard?PhD, who worked on the development of OM in the Vedas:
"Does any one have knowledge and/or references regarding the imagery (sculpture; images on manuscripts; any sort of visual renderings) of OM from any period through the medieval period?"
Kindly either write to her directly (dmswh at earthlink.net), to me off-list, or to the List, of course. Thank you!
Best wishes,
Corinna Wessels-Mevissen
