[INDOLOGY] Request for pdf of D.S. Ruegg's (1980) 'Ahimsa and Vegetarianism in the History of Buddhism'
Dear all
I wonder if anyone has a PDF of the following?
Ruegg, D.S., 1980. 'Ahimsa and Vegetarianism in the History of Buddhism' in S. Balasooriya et al., (Eds.), Buddhist Studies in Honour of Walpola Rahula. London: 234-41
If so I would be most grateful if you could share it with me please.
Many thanks and best wishes,
