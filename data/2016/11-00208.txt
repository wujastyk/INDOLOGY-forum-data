[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
that *most *practitioners these days would rely on their PC or mobile
applications to generate horoscopes without truly understanding the science
behind them as their predecessors, *at least some*, did. (Highlighting mine)
used 'many' and such a student would have avoided unnecessary quantifiers
like 'at least some'. There are several different levels of 'users' of
astrology. Some would only 'read' a ready horoscope, some would know how to
make one. Among those who make, some would know why they have to do what
they do, some others mechanically follow the procedure of making learnt
from a human teacher or a book. Among those who know why they do what they
do, some might know the depths of the siddhaanta to be able to make their
own new theories within it , some may not be able to do that. Some may be
able to explain to a curious Indologist in English (without knowing or
bothering about what that Indologist might use that knowledge for), some
may not be able to converse with an outsider in his language. The situation
is similar in all fields of knowledge world over. People with higher and
higher levels of knowledge are smaller and smaller in number. A mature
observer takes such a situation for granted without being hasty or
judgemental about the observed.
