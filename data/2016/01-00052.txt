[INDOLOGY] National Museum of Nepal
Dear list,
Does anybody know how to successfully contact the National Museum of 
Nepal in Kathmandu with enquiries about their art collections? The only 
email address I have been able to find is info at nationalmuseum.gov.np, 
and after several attempts I have yet to receive an answer.
Regards,
Jacob
