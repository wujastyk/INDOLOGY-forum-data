Dear colleagues,

With kind permission from Vincent Eltschinger, please find attached the
article. I am very grateful to him, as well as Christian Ferstl and
Reinhold Gruenendahl for coming to the rescue.

I need hardly say ? but should to, all the same ? that this is wonderful
group of helpful and extremely knowledgeable people. Once again, I am very
grateful.

Peter Szanto
