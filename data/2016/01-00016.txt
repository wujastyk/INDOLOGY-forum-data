[INDOLOGY] amrita
5.1.16
Dear Professor Karup
The distinction between immortality and the substance giving immortality
became vague in Classical Sanskrit but it is already blurred in AVP 2.6.3c (AV?
2.1.5c) *y?tra* *dev**?**??*  *am?*?*tam* *?nan??n**?**??**?*. In the
Atharvaveda the plant *ku??ha* (*saussurea* *lappa*) too seems to have been
conceived as the elixir of life. This was discussed by me in 2005.
