[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit and Panjabi Culture?
Dear Colleagues,
Can anyone tell me if there are any contemporary, reputable scholars working on the interactions between Sanskrit and the Panjab, whether in linguistics, literature, cultural history, or religious thought? All leads would be valuable, as we are hoping to organize a special session on this topic for the 2018 World Sanskrit Conference.
With best wishes,
Adheesh
