[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology (was: bhakti)
Nagaraj,
I'm fascinated by your insights into the heterogenous nature of jyoti?a.
Particularly the claim regarding Tribal jyoti?a. Are you able to share any
more detail on this? This seems like a great topic for a paper. It seems as
if western practitioners and their client base are the only ones using the
term 'vedic astrology'. However, a quick search of google for 'vedic
astrology india' shows several examples of Indian-based astrologers that
claim to use and identify with the term 'vedic astrology' - for instance  -
http://www.indastro.com/ - now, perhaps they are based in India but cater
to a western clientele? Or perhaps, those based in NYC only cater to
videsilog? But even if one searches for '????? ???????' it brings up a heap
of hits. So your claim that this "is being done by the western circles of
the practice and the English tag 'Vedic' is needed by them and is used by
them. Brahmin and non-Brahmin contemporary  busy practitioners do not even
need this English word or its Indian language forms such as Vaidik or
Vaidika", seems to need some nuancing.
All the best,
