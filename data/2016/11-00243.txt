[INDOLOGY] Diacriticals in unicode, single or multiple glyphs
Unicode standards treat certain precomposed characters as equivalent
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence> to certain sequences of
uncomposed characters. It's considered good practice to implement this
equivalence in applications by "normalizing" unicode strings: Google, as
far as I can tell, treats "s?akti" (uncomposed) and "?akti" (composed) as
equivalent.
Because Indologists usually use precomposed characters, most applications
don't bother. But maybe it will be worth implementing equivalence in the
search functions of SARIT and other applications. (Are there other
resources, besides the online transcoder at the Sanskrit Library, that use
uncomposed characters?)
