Dear Colleagues


I was fascinated to see from his website that Bibek Debroy has published a translation of most of Mbh - has anyone looked at this? Have there been any scholarly reviews?


Thanks in advance


McC

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] The battle for Sanskrit

Dear list members

On Friday, the OPEN weekly magazine carried a review of The Battle for Sanskrit by the Cambridge-educated Indian economist Bibek Debroy (Padma Shri, Member of NITI Aayog, and translator of the BORI edition of the Mahabharata into English). The review, titled Home Alone: There is more to Rajiv Malhotra's latest book on Sanskrit than the usual Pollock pickle, can be read under

Dear Friends,

Has anyone had the opportunity to read Rajiv Malhotra's latest book?

I'm curious to know what the 'new thrust in Western Indology' is and where/how it 'goes wrong'. [emphasis mine]
