Dear indologists,

I was reading the 13th chapter of the *Matsyapur?**?a *where is shortly
described the *dak**?ayajna *episode. Although there is no reference to the
dismemberment of the goddess Sati, there is a list of 108 places where she
says to reside.

One of these sacred place is Kamal? in Kamalal?ya.

D.C. Sircar (1948) in his study on the *s?kta pitha*s identified Kamal?
with Kubjika, and he identifies Kamalal?ya with: Nila, Pr??a (Kamal?k?i,
Kamal?k?a).

However going on in the *Matsyapur?**?a*'s list I noticed this place "Mah?
tpal? in Kamal?k?a".

So, I would like to understand if Kamal?k?a is identified with Nila(cala?)
or with his presiding goddess, the Mah?tpal? could be another temple on the
hill?

Anyone can suggest something? Maybe, am I in very wrong way about Mah?tpal??

Best,
Paolo
