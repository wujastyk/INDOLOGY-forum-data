[INDOLOGY] Revolving wheel in ancient Indian literature
Thanks, Mak.
The ideal year of 360 days was carried over into the Puranic system of 
kalpas, also known as days of Brahm?. A year of Brahm? lasts for 360 of 
his days (along with their 360 nights). The duration of a kalpa in human 
years is based on this year of 360 days. So is the 100-years duration of 
Brahm?'s life, which, in turn, continues with the Vedic (already present 
in the R?gveda) notion of 100 years as the ideal human lifetime.
