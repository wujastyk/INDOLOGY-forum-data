[INDOLOGY] Ms colopon from Nepal, need help
Dear Justin,
the compound denotes the year of composition of your ms, expressed with the
*bh?tasa?khy?* notation (the digits are represented by items usually
associated with those numbers, see e.g. Salomon's *Indian Epigraphy* p.
173). The numbers should be read leftward (*a?k?n?? v?mato gati?*) and in
this way you will have: *khacara* (the nine planets=9), *?ara* (K?ma's five
arrows=5). As for *ya?a*, I cannot give an answer, as I can't find a
meaning for it, but for sure someone of this list can do better. Are you
sure of the reading? I cannot visualise the scan! Leaving the last digit
aside, the date expressed is therefore Nepalese Year 95x. Since the Nepali
age starts in AD 879, your copy must belong to something between 1829 and
1839 AD: does it fit? You can find more details in Kielhorn's "The Epoch of
the Newar Era", *Indian Antiquary* 17. For lists of *bh?tasa?khy?s*, you
can refer to B?hler's *Indian Paleography* pp. 84-86 or Kale's *History of
Dharma??stra* vol. 5.1 pp. 701-703. I hope this helped.
Best
