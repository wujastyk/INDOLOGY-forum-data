[INDOLOGY] J?ti as Caste in Ny?ya?
The concept of gotva was brought in by the 'originator of the thread' Prof.
Davis himself, not by me. He used the English translation of it,
'cow-ness'.
The point I was making was that for naiyaayikas , 'cow-ness' is similar
to 'pot-ness'. We can extend this and use words  like pencilness and
carness too.
 If  braamhaNatva (brahminness)  is taken only as similar to cowness, it
leads to the ideas such as 'the varnas have been viewed as similar to
biological species'. But in fact, brahminness is viewed as similar to
carness and pencilness.
If one resorts to sources of knowledge other than empirical observation or
direct perception to substantiate the '-ness' of a certain group of
entities, it shows that one has an understanding that commonality of that
group of entities is not an empirically verifiable or directly perceivable
one.
If one lists empirically verifiable or directly perceivable features to
identify the common identity of a group of entities, then one need not and
does not usually resort to any other source of knowledge as the Vedas for
that purpose.
Prof. Aklujkar pointed out the difference between jaati of grammarians
which is the commonality in the meanings of words denoting entities or the
meaning of the word denoting the group of entities and jaati of the
naiyaayikas which is the commonality in the entities.
