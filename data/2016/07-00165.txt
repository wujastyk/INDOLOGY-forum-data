[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Re:  Sandhi breaks in longer meters
Metrical rule for preventing ?????????? is - No side of the split should
have a single syllable. As long as there are more than one syllable on
either side of a yati (metrical pause) or half verse, it is fine. Will cite
exact rule from vRttaratnAkara as I can lay my hands on it.
