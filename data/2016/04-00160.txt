The blurb: The ?Twenty Verses on Manifestation-Only? of the Indian Buddhist
philosopher Vasubandhu (c. 350?430?), his *Vi???k?*, is one of the most
important treatises of the Yog?c?ra school. Accompanied by the author?s own
commentary, the text lays out a vision of a ?Buddhist Idealism? in which
even one?s experience of the sufferings of hell is revealed to be nothing
other than the results of working out one?s karma. Later scholars commented
on the work a number of times, in its original Sanskrit, in Tibetan
translation, and in three Chinese versions.
This book presents an edition and translation of the Sanskrit text of the
core verses, alongside the original author?s commentary, based directly on
the manuscript evidence. This is accompanied by an edition of the canonical
translations of these texts found in the Tibetan Tanjurs, as well as a
?draft translation? of the verses in Tibetan, found in a manuscript from
Dunhuang. This publication therefore provides the most reliable and
comprehensive philological accounting to date for this fundamental work.
