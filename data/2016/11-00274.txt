Valmiki's bandit biography is only one of the versions, albeit the most
popular of his life-stories available in different texts than Valmiki
Ramayana. The other version is that he is son of a rishi, Pracheta.
The verse under question and the portion of Valmiki Ranayana from where
this picked do not have the bandit version of the narrative in the
background directly or indirectly.
So that may not be a good way to explain the question under discussion.
