[INDOLOGY] From the Mahabharata
I heard from my American teachers of Culture Studies that even in US, there
used to be a phrase 'FKB' (Family Keep Back) indicating a hospitality norm
of host family members waiting until the guests are provided to their
(guests') satisfaction.
Modernity and modernization seem to be diluting some of these universal
ideals.
