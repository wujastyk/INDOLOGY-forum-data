Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Sun as the "21st"

 Dear Luis,

the translational usage of "equator" ("dividing the year (into two equal
parts)") in contexts related to uttar?ya?a and dak?i??yana is generally
short for "celestial equator".
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice.

Regards,
Walter

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
