[INDOLOGY] From the Mahabharata
Dear Nagaraj,
The question is: *how *do you keep your hunger under control?
To my mind (basing on my certainly simplistic concept of my own mental
processes) - by taking control of, by overcoming the emotions/feelings
generated by the sensation of hunger, that is - the physiological need to
eat food.
And these emotions/feelings are - not necessarily distinctly - expressed
 by the poet's choice of a desiderative derivate form.
Greg O'Toole said somewhere: "What is necessary is that the terms and other
variables in a conversation be clarified and agreed on by *all participants
in this conversation*."
Extending my  sincere gratitude to all participants in *this here*
conversation. Learning has no end.
