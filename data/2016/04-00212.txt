[INDOLOGY] Eating flesh of a jogi, a magician, a healer
///Rather, the purpose is to inoculate the killer against the spirit of the dead person by creating a link of identity between the two, /// 
Hmmm ? this certainly is a new speculation as far as I am concerned! For me, ?inoculation? is something medicinal and physical, not ritual and literary. I?d like to learn more about it. Please educate me.
///the idea being that the dead spirit would not try to harm itself.///
This statement is even more confusing. 'Dead spirit harming itself?' What does that mean? You should educate me.
++++++++++
There are quite a few references to ?cannibalism? in Old Tamil (Sangam literature, Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai), Kalingathupparani, and a later hagiographic Tamil literature (Periyapuranam) perhaps depicting the later-developed k?p?lika (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalika <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalika>) tradition. 
However, none of the Tamil references point to ?acquiring? the other party?s (== the consumed ones?) flesh or life. And, the consumed ones were not always a king?s enemies.
I wish scholars would abstain from making sweeping statements about a foreign culture/literature. 
Thanks and regards,
