[INDOLOGY] ISO 15919 description no longer accessible online
Dear Arlo,
I couldn't find Anthony Stones pages either.
I have the costly published version of the ISO 15919 (over $200.00
Canadian) but unfortunately it is copyrighted and when you purchase it you
sign an agreement not to distribute copies.  It does seem counterproductive
to have a standard that is so inaccessable.
But if you have any specific questions I can quote you small sections under
"fair usage".
