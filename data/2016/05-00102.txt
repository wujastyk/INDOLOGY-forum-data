Dear Colleagues,
Let me first express my gratitude to those of you who have shared their
knowledge with me. I was unwell and unable to thank you at the proper
moment.
And - now. What is the earliest, archaeologically confirmed, date for the
Sati-devi cult practices performed in the sanctuaries - known as p??h?'s?
With regards,
