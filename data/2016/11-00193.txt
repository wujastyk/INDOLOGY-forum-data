[INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
Some cyber-ethnography I am conducting tentatively supports the claim that
"Vedic Astrology" is usually interpreted to mean precisely, "traditional
Indian astrology". One interesting thing is that, even though my
interlocutors (westerners for the most part)  almost all assert it means
the above; when pressed to define what they consider the 'Vedic' part of
the phrase to more specifically mean, the typical answer is overwhelmingly:
"I don't really know". If asked to discuss the difference between the
astrological, ie predictive systems, or the historical, parallel
development of these systems, even some people who claim to be
'professional Vedic astrologers' seem unable to clearly differentiate them.
The same can be said for my tentative investigations into people's
attitudes toward 'vedic maths'. Most people, and to be honest I include
myself in this group, seem unable to clearly articulate what this type of
maths is meant to be, and how it is any different from 'maths'.
These anecdotes would at least point towards support of an analysis that
'vedic', for the most part, does simply refer to a vague,
'historico-mythical' past that is 'pure' and not influenced by premodern,
transcultural flows of ideas.
But, it still does not help me, nor my interlocutors, to really pin down
what a 'Vedic-X' is . Apart from "it's really old", which = 'better'.
However,  I find this conclusion of sorts frustratingly bland.
Regardless, it is this seemingly uncritical absorption of the/a Vedic
narrative, and its narritival power to infuse the past, present and future
with meaning and potential that intrigues me most. This is at both micro
and macro scales of analysis.
