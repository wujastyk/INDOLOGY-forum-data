[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit verses and logical sentences.
Dear Harry,
I wonder if you are referring to what Jayaratha calls structural unity
(*sa?caya
ny?ya*) in the *Tantr?loka-viveka* (T?V). Abhinavagupta ends each *?hnika*
of the T? with the first half of the concluding verse and begins the
subsequent *?hnika* with the second half of the same verse. This strategy
is followed in all chapters except in *?hnika* 36. See T?V: *iha
?hnik?d?hnik?ntarasya sa?cayany?yena parasparamanusy?tat?? dar?ayitum
ekenaiva ?lokena*
*tatparyantapr?rambhayorupasa?h?ropakramau karoti, iti asya granthak?rasya
?ail?* | (cf. T?V, Vol I, p. 309
?,?
? KSTS?
).  Also quoted by Navjivan Rastogi (1987:76-78) in the "Introduction to
the *Tantr?loka" (MLBD)*.
Also see T?V, Vol 12, p 390:  *iha ?hnik?d?hnik?ntarasya
parasparamanusy?tat?? dar?ayitum?dyantayorekena ?lokena*
*p?thagupasa?h?ropakramayorupanibandhe.api s??prata? granth?nte
tad??le?amatyantamavadyotayitamekenaiva*
*ardhena yugapattadupanibandha **iti* |
I hope this helps.
Best wishes.
