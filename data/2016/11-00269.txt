Dear David,
If what you are suggesting is that because R?ma is supposed to have 
lived in Tret?, that implies that the language can be older, the 
argument doesn't work. The yuga system only appears in India around the 
beginning of the common era. In addition, the placement of R?ma in Tret? 
appears only once in V?lm?ki, and that is in the second part of the 
Uttarak??da, which is late. The Uttara, of course, is the one just 
published. Later versions of the /R?m?ya?a/ -as well as some Pur??as-  
reinforce that placement, but it is all a later development, after the 
/V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a/.
Unless I misunderstood you.
