[INDOLOGY] Two etymologies
<These terms seem to find a place in Tamil literature as ?uttara?
and ?takshi?a.?
The term ?taccar? appears in Old Tamil referring to Greek carpenters,
specifically Ionia (?yava?a-t-taccar?).>
But cf., uttariiya 'upper outer decorative garment, a wrapper' and tasar
'silk'.
