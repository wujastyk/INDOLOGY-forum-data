[INDOLOGY] To post or not to post
Many of the best law and medical schools offer, or require, courses and seminars on the ethics and dangers of the trade, including false and valid accusations of sexual harassment. Such courses and seminars are not generally considered to be an alarming deviation from the proper subject matter of the field. 
As I recall, Audrey did not act as judge and jury, nor did she regale us with a sermon on political correctness. She merely posted a news item that is relevant to those who teach, or aspire to teach, Indology.
Thus the strenuous objections to her post, which dwarf in volume her own, seem to be a bit preemptive.
