Dear All,
I have discovered in my files that there is a dissertation on the
Padaprak??a by ?ja?a, a hitherto unpublished commentary on the
Sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a (ala?k?ra). It appears to be missing in Cahill's
bibliography, but perhaps I have overlooked something.
The bibliographical details are:
A / Critical Edition of Padaprak??a / hitherto unpublished commentary / of
/ ?ja?a / on / Bhoja's Sarasvat?ka??h?bhara?a
The thesis submitted for Ph.D. degree / of / Gujurat University, Ahmedabad.
1984
