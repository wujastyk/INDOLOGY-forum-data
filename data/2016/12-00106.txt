Me too.  ?I would also be interested in any studies of the presumably
related term *prasa?khy?na* (= "*sattvapuru??nyat?khy?ti*" PY?) that is a

Endo, K. Mayeda, S.; Matsunami, Y.; Tokunaga, M. & Marui, H. *(Eds.)
"*Prasa?khy?na
in the Yogabh??ya" in *The Way to Liberation: Indological Studies in Japan,*
