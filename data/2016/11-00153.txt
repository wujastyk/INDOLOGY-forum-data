[INDOLOGY] bhakti/Vedic astrology
This is getting off the topic a bit, but just to clarify: both 
Babylonian and early Greek-language astrology was explicitly sidereal in 
the sense that it defined the vernal equinoctial point as falling 
somewhere within the sign Aries rather than Aries commencing from it. 
The same seems to have been true of pre-Islamic Persian astrology. So I 
agree with Luis that 'sidereal' won't do as a synonym of 'Indian'. 
Indian astrology differs in many other technical respects from its 
cousin traditions further west: some aspects of the Hellenistic system 
never made it to India, or only did so a millennium later with the 
Perso-Arabic transmission, and new methods were developed in India, some 
on the basis of indigenous lore such as the nak?atras.
