Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks

I mistakenly did not send this to the whole list last night, although it
seems it is  mostly paunarutka at this point.  I would, however, repeat
that there are simply many places where the lack of diacritics obscures the
meaning entirely. For example, *it and i? *in Sanskrit grammatical
terminology.

Regarding the use of the original script, if I were to have my druthers,
all longer quotations would be in the original script. Anyone who can read
the language can read the script, and many of the people who can read it
best, cannot read transliteration or only with difficulty. It's also worth
noting that despite the typographic difficulties, many earlier publications
were printed with Devan?gar? instead of transliteration. Kielhorn, for
example, published many studies (K?ty?yana and Patanjali (sic!), his
translation of the Paribh??endu?ekhara, etc.) with minimal transliteration,
mostly for proper names.  The two scripts blend rather elegantly even in
the same line.
