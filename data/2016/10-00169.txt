[INDOLOGY] Monier Williams Online
Dear Colleagues,
Since yesterday the online version of Monier-Williams? Sanskrit-English
dictionary at
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php
does not work any more (at least for me). Whatever word I search, the
result is ?not found,? although the input is correct. Does anybody else
experience the same problem?
Many thanks for your reply,
Philipp Maas
