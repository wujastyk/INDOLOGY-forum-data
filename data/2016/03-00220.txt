Dear Indologists,

(Please reply off-list!)

I am seeking book reviews for the journal Asian Medicine: Tradition and Modernity.  The following books relating to South Asian medicine are currently in need of review:

Costa, Palmira Fontes da (2015). Medicine, Trade and Empire: Garcia de Orta?s Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India (1563) in Context. Ashgate.

Das, Debjani (2015).  Houses of Madness: Insanity and Asylums of Bengal in Nineteenth-Century India. Oxford University Press India.

Ecks, Stefan (2014). Eating Drugs: Psychopharmaceutical Pluralism in India. NYU Press.

Ferrari, Fabrizio (2015). Religion, Devotion And Medicine In North India: The Healing Power Of Sitala. Bloomsbury.

Fields, Gregory P. (2014) Religious Therapeutics: Body and Health in Yoga, Ayurveda, and Tantra. SUNY Press.

Sieler, Roman (2015). Lethal Spots, Vital Secrets: Medicine and Martial Arts in South India. Oxford University Press.

Zysk, Kenneth (2016) The Indian System of Human Marks (2 vols). Brill.

Our regular book reviews should be between 700 and 1000 words, but there is also the option for shorter book notes (up to 500 words) and essay reviews (over 2,000 words) depending on the particular requirements of the book in question. Expected turn-around time is normally 90 days.

Those interested should reply off-list to Michael.Slouber at wwu.edu<mailto:Michael.Slouber at wwu.edu>. Please include your name and full mailing address, and a few sentences about your qualifications to review the book or books.

Best,

Michael
