Subject: [INDOLOGY] Kalapattana, black men, and some medical terms
Message-ID: <0d8bf29f-98ba-7788-0b59-49e055c10f44@pbhome.se>

The /H?yanasundara/, a seemingly fairly late astrological text (quoted 
by Balabhadra in the early 17th century) in simple, inelegant Sanskrit, 
contains some phrases that I am not quite sure about. First, in a 
description of the joint results of the sun and moon, there are the 
following stanzas:

var?asv?m? yad? s?ryas [...] yadi candramas? yuta? [...]
?vetakray??ak?l l?bho vi?e??t kalapattan? | (some MSS read kalapattanam)
?ayan??anavastr?di mi???nnasv?dubhojanam ||
saudhotsa?gasthito g?tan?tyalolupam?nasa? |
str?vatsala? sugandh??hyo r?trau sukhitacetasa? ||

I don't know what to make of kalapattana/-?: is it the name of a place 
(reading -?t), as the second member suggests, and if so, where? Or does 
it refer to a type of merchandise, or to something else entirely?

Second, the description of the joint results of the sun and Venus lists 
a number of medical conditions. The underlined phrases are particularly 
problematic:

ravir atha sitad???a? sa?yuto v? jvar?rtir bhavati ?irasi p??? _chardir_ 
apy eti _v?ntim_ |
bhavati ja?hara??la? _k?sapitt?tis?rai_ ripubhayam atha cint? sth?nato 
bhra??am eti ||
yad?gneyadi?o l?bha? _pittak?maladadrut??_ |
gala? ?u?yati ?ukre?a ravir d???o yuto yadi ||

What might the difference be between chardi and v?nti, both of which 
seem generally to mean 'vomiting' but are apparently differentiated 
here? And how are the compounded names of medical conditions best 
understood?

Finally, the text refers repeatedly to 'black men' (asita-m?nava, 
k???a-manuja). I have never seen these or similar terms used of 
dark-skinned Indians. Does it seem reasonable to assume that they are 
used here to refer to people of African origin, and if so, what (if 
anything) does that tell us of the likely date and place of the text?

I should be grateful for any comments or suggestions.
