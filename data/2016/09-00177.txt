Dear colleages,
May I bring your attention to a workshop that will take place in the South
Asian studies department at Vienna university on October 21 and 22?
The two-day workshop will explore the historically linked South and Inner
Asian practices of ras?yana, k?yakalpa and bcud len.  These are practices,
treatment techniques and formulations aimed at a variety of goals that
range from prolonging life, restoring youthfulness, and promoting physical
health, to accessing special powers, achieving enlightenment, and attaining
immortality.
You can find the programme of the workshop here

With kind regards,
Dagmar Wujastyk
