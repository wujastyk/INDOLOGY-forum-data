[INDOLOGY] Lexicographic order / sentence boundaries
Dear Jonathan,
Far and wide no hornet's net. It is simply astonishing that with  
regard to entries in MW's dictionary one permanently comes across  
questions of a certain type. They always require the same answer:  
please have a look at the respective entry in B?htlingk's dictionary.
Best wishes,
Roland
