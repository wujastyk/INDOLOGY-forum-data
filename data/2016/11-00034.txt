Dear Jonathan,

Far and wide no hornet's net. It is simply astonishing that with  
regard to entries in MW's dictionary one permanently comes across  
questions of a certain type. They always require the same answer:  
please have a look at the respective entry in B?htlingk's dictionary.

Best wishes,

Roland
