Dear Friends,


I have made a short film titled: *Total-am*



*Total-am* is about one afternoon that occurred during the 1-month I spent
in the 'Sanskrit village' Jhiri in Madhya Pradesh in 2015. On a very hot,
dry and windy 47c day we went to a neighbouring village to collect 300kgs
of wheat. Some of the people in this other village also speak *some*
Sanskrit. The focus of this film is to show how the Sanskrit '-am' particle
is used to turn loan words from other languages into Sanskrit words. Hence
the title of the film 'Total-am'. This film also shows how Sanskrit lives
alongside other languages like Malvi, Hindi and English and the scenery of
Rajgarh District.


I have uploaded a link to my academia site:

While it certainly won't get nominated for a BAFTA, nonetheless I hope you
enjoy it.


Best,


Patrick McCartney
