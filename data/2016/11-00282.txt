[INDOLOGY] Query re: guru-ziSya and paramparA
Dear Toke,
Vedic intellectual tradition, passing on knowledge and practice
The Wikipedia page that your correspondent mentions clearly states that the
culture/tradition is not limited to the Vedic tradition but pervades many
other Indian areas /fields/ cultures/ traditions of learning.
The word ?ch?rya is found in the Vedas.
The extremely popular ??nti mantra saha n? vavatu etc. is the joint wish of
the guru and ?i?ya.
"asmad?ch?rya paryant?m vand? guruparampar?m" is the last part of the usual
formulaic prayer found in the beginnings of Vedanta discourses like those
of the Advaitins.
In upad??a- based mantra japa traditions, praying to the guruparampar? is
the ordained part of a japa-session.
Nowadays, the word guru?i?yaparampar? is being used to contrast with the
mutual 'legal-rational' relationship between teachers and students in the
'modern' educational institutes without the memory of a long lineage/order
of Guru -?i?ya- pra?i?ya and so on and an emotional bondage of
every ?i?ya with the immediate Guru in particular and the entire lineage
/order in general which is found in the  guru?i?yaparampar? type system.
This order has the name ghar?n? in hindust?n? music  and each ghar?n? also
refers to particular 'style' of singing.
One interesting guru(?i?ya)parampar? that finds mention in many spiritual
traditions is that of n?tha samprad?ya /n?tha parampar?.
