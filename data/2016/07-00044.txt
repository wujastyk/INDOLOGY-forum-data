[INDOLOGY] Two etymologies
The Tibetan translation of tak?aka
is 'jog-po, used, so far as I know, only in the
name of a particular N?gar?ja. The term, though,
means "one who puts in place," and seems to
convey the sense not quite of "carpenter," but rather
something like "architect, construction foreman."
