[INDOLOGY] Fw:  Mystery manuscripts
It is true that photos of whole leaves might make the task easier and more interesting !
To add to Nibedita Rout?s impressive identification, here is a much more obvious one: it seems that IMG_0278.jpg gives the left-hand edge of a leaf that has the beginning of the B?lak???a of the R?m?ya?a (after the familiar copyists' ma?gala verse ?ukl?mbaradhara? vi??u? ?a?ivar?a? caturbhujam, etc.)
Several of the other fragments you show (IMG_0269.jpg to IMG_0274.jpg) just have that same familiar copyists? ma?gala, along with other formulae of obeisance.
