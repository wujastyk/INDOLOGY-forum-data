Dear Paolo,

Of the two Matsyapurana texts you mentioned, the first, *Matsyapurana*. Ed.
by J.D. Akhtar. Delhi: Oriental Publisher, 1972, is in fact a photographic
reprint of the English translation by "A Taluqdar of Oudh," published in 2
volumes in the Sacred Books of the Hindus series, 1916, 1917, as comparison
will show, even though this is not stated. It does not include the Sanskrit
text. You can probably find the original Sacred Books of the Hindus
translation online.

While I do not have the second, *Matsya Mahapurana (With an Exhaustive
Introduction, Sanskrit Text, English Translation and Index of Verses)*. Ed.
by K.L. Joshi. New Delhi: Parimal Publication, 2007, the English
translation in this book may also be the one that was first published in
the Sacred Books of the Hindus. These publishers typically do not state
this. I have yet another reprint of the Matsyapurana, by Nag Publishers,
that also includes the English translation from the Sacred Books of the
Hindus, again unstated.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
