[INDOLOGY] Fwd: aja as ajaya?
Dear Madhav and all,
The lack of a syllable in this p?da certainly makes *ajaya* for *aja* a
simple and obvious fix for the problem. I recall an early Vedic scholar (I
have forgotten who) writing that the very fact that an emendation is
obvious is good reason not to make the emendation, because it would have
also been obvious to the whole line of Sanskrit pandits who transmitted the
text, yet who did not make the emendation. We seem to have the same
situation here. I originally did not make the obvious emendation because
all eight Sanskrit manuscripts unanimously agreed in having *aja* here.
Then came confirmation of this by the occurrence of *aja* in the prose
commentary on 1.27, three times. Then two more old palm-leaf Sanskrit
manuscripts became available to me, also having *aja*. Most recently, Tsa
mi?s early Tibetan translation became available, having the transliterated
*aja*. Not a single source has *ajaya*. So I am obliged to conclude that
*aja* is the actual form of the name.
Unlike the Vedic texts with their long history, the K?lacakra texts only
appeared in India about a thousand years ago. There was no time for a
corruption to occur in the transmission of the text and then become
established in the tradition. The early translators all lived within the
first few generations after the K?lacakra texts appeared in India. Two of
the palm-leaf Sanskrit manuscripts we have are old enough to have been
brought to Tibet, presumably by the early translators. The question, then,
is whether the *ajaya* meaning for *aja* is a mistake, like the *abja*
meaning most likely is, or whether the name *aja* was actually understood
in the meaning of *ajaya*.
We know that *aja* cannot be derived from the root *ji* in accordance with
the rules of Sanskrit grammar. No evidence has so far surfaced that *aja*
ever had the *ajaya* meaning in a Prakrit or vernacular, presumably of
northeast India. The evidence of the early translators is inconsistent,
some taking *aja* in the meaning of *ajaya*, and some not. Soman?tha,
working with the Tibetan translator 'Bro, apparently did (we have only the
later revision of his translation by Shong ston), while Tsa mi did not. Yet
both are reported to have been co-disciples of the same K?lacakra teacher,
and they lived only a few generations after the texts appeared in India. So
who do we trust? It seems to me that we need more evidence to decide this
question.
