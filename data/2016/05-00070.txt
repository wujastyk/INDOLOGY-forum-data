Dear Palaniappan,
This is interesting.  At my Upanayana ceremony in Pune, when I was 8 year
old, I was told to say the following greeting to the teacher/priest:  ...
m?dhava?arm? aham abhiv?daye.  The addition of ?arman to my first name was
supposed to indicate my Brahmin family background.  That added part
"--?arman" was not used elsewhere.  I have not heard of -varm? as a part of
the Sa?sk?ra-name among Brahmins, but there must be regional variations.
