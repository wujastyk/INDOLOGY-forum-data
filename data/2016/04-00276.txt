[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Textbook Formation
I already replied privately to Jarrod, but given the interest, let me add
my article published last year that delves into a number of these issues,
"Whence Sanskrit? : A Brief History of Sanskrit Pedagogy in the West" in
International Journal of Hindu Studies 19 (1-2):213-256 (2015)? (Gerow
Festschrift volume)?
