 I believe a ISO working group was formed in 1997 called  ISO/TC46/SC2/WG12
 (Working Group on transliteration of Indic scripts)  and Dr. Anthony P
Stone (who also created the website you were looking for) was the project
leader.  The working group had their own mailing list separate from the
Indology list.  Dr. John Smith of Cambridge (website
http://bombay.indology.info/ ) was also heavily involved and he could
probably give you much more detailed information.
