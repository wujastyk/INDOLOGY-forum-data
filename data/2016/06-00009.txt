[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit verses and logical sentences.
Dear list members,
I vaguely recall reading somewhere (it might even have been on this list)
that in some tantric works  the logical sentence consists of the last two
padas of a verse and the first two padas of the next verse.
Can any members confirm if this is true or false and if true give an
example.
Many thanks,
Harry Spier
