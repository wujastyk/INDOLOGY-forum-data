Dear Nityanand,
Here are a few items I found in the GRETIL corpus:
aju?ran (RV 1.71.1c)
pari?rita? (3x), pari?rayati (1x), mi?ram (?atapatha Br?hma?a)
zu?r??am???n?m (Bh?gavata Pur??a 1.1.13)
It could also in principle be found across a word boundary, when a word 
is left to stand with final ? (e.g. jyoti? rajas, Nirukta).
Best,
Kevin
