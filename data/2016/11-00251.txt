[INDOLOGY] dhanus/dhavin (Sagittarius)
Yes, you are right. I never saw a dhanvi kind of usages in specific
reference to the r??i. .
The most prominent, popular, day to day use of the word dhanus here in
south India is as in the compound dhanurm?sa. The period from 15th December
to 15th January is called dhanurm?sa. More precisely, the one month period
ending with  makarasankrama?am/ makarasankr?nti is called dhanurm?sam in
Telugu.
It is the period during which ?n??l? , the composer of tirupp?vai is
performed her p?vu , month long Vi??u- worshipping vow-bound
Bhakti-rituals. Devotees re-enact the rituals by waking up during the early
hours of this peak winter season.
