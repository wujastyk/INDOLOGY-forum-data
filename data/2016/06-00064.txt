Dear Peter
Just in case you're not aware of it, Sanderson's (2006: 57ff.) "The Date of
Sadyojyotis and B?haspati" deals with the the Haravijaya's use of the
terminology and authoritative texts of various ?aiva systems, in particular
Saiddh?ntika scriptures and works by Sadyojyotis and B?haspati.
About the Haravijaya he writes:
"This contains in its sixth chapter a long hymn to S?iva (6.13-187) in
which the poet has Spring praise that deity as the true nature of the
diverse highest realities venerated in India?s religious systems, using the
terminology of each and working in paraphrases of formulations found in
their authoritative texts. Among these systems is the Siddha?nta, though
nothing so prosaic as an explicit statement to this effect is allowed to
compromise the obliquity required of fine verse composed for the
delectation of the court. In the verses of the hymn that draw on the
Siddha?nta we can detect echoes of the scriptures
Sva?yambhuvasu?trasa?graha, Rauravasu?trasa?graha, and
Mata?gapa?rames?vara, and also of Sadyojyotis? Sva?yambhuvav?tti and
B?haspati?s S?ivatanu."
He goes on to give specific cases, for example Haravijaya 6:161 is based on
Sadyojyotis' Sva?yambhuvavr?tti ad 3:16, and Haravijaya 6:139 is based on
Sva?yambhuvavr?tti ad 3:11?13.  However the article does not help with
6:170 or the verse cited in the commentary ad loc.
I have found numerous verses beginning pr?k?to vaik?ta? caiva (mostly in
Pur??as and ?yurvedic texts) and some verses beginning s?ttviko r?jasa?
caiva (for example in the ??ntiparvan of the Mah?bh?rata) but none of these
give a list of 8.
