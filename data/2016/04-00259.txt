Svetasvataropanishad is definitely one of the early Upanishads. May be 
the BhagavadgItA was inspired by this Upanishad. Comparison of the 
textual style of the Svetasvataropanishad and the BhagavadgItA will make 
it clearer.
Is it possible to show the popularity and textual references of the 
BhagavadgItA in other literatures and commentaries before Samkara ?
Is it possible to hold that it was Samkara who had popularised and 
propagated the Bhagavadgita by stating that it is the essence of all the 
Vedanta as he mentions quite a number of times in his commentary ? For, 
one rarely knows of any textual reference to the Bhagavadgita in the 
period earlier to Samkara......
Of course, Kalidaqsa is later than the Svetasvataropanishad. As I have 
been saying in the earlier posts, KAlidAsa and Patanjali definitely 
belong to a very early period.
Unless one accepts the view that both the Yogasutra and the Bhashya are 
a unified text composed by a single person (which does not appear to be 
strongly supported by the tradition), one cannot admit "/Pata?jali 
quoted Vi??upur??a 6.6.2 in order to support his exposition of 
Mantrameditation leading to an awareness of //??vara//in PY? 1.28. //"/
It is also to be noted that Saivasiddhanta authors such as Sadyojyoti 
(700-800 CE), and great commentators such as Narayanakantha, Ramakantha, 
Aghorasiva (spanning from 9-12 centuries CE) do refer only to the 
Yogasutra-s as the work of Patanjali and not the Bhashya
while referring to and refuting some of the doctrines the Patanjala Yoga 
system.
