[INDOLOGY] Sexual Harassment
If I may again, I agree with Prof. Slaje on the danger of anachronism and the need to go back to the Sanskrit words. The word kany?-d??a?a does not occur in KSS XII, 2, 105 cd but the Sanskrit is crystal-clear: it is a case of abuse as the girl is not willing and as the vidy?dhara has undertaken to abduct her by force.
