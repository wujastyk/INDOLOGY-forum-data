[INDOLOGY] bhakti/Vedic astrology
Dear Nagaraj,
I am very curious about your claim about the ?source-claims?. Is there any jyoti?a text other than Ved??gajyoti?a of Lagadha that claims itself to be vaidika?
I don?t think the topic of ?source-claims? within the jyoti?a texts had been treated seriously. The Greco-Indian texts of Sphujidhavaja and M?nar?ja or even Var?hamihira all make interesting claims and referred to authors which had been speculated to be foreign, e.g., Maya > Ptolemy, Ma?ittha > Manethos, beside all the ?Yavanar?ja?-s including ?Yavane?vara" etc.
