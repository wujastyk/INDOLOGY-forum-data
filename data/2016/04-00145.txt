[INDOLOGY] copy of D. Seyfort Ruegg "Does the Madhyamika Have a Thesis and Philosophical Position?"
Dear Deepak and all,
I have made a scan of this article by D. Seyfort Ruegg, and will try to
attach it here, in case others may also want it. If this does not work,
just email me off-list for it.
Best regards,
