[INDOLOGY] Publication announcement: Radha Tantra
Dear List Members,
I am happy to announce the publication of my book The Radha Tantra: A  
critical edition and annotated translation. It is available here:
https://www.routledge.com/The-Radha-Tantra-A-critical-edition-and-annotated-translation/Broo/p/book/9781138892361
Or alternatively here:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Radha-Tantra-annotated-translation-Traditions/dp/113889236X
Unfortunately, as with other Routledge publications, the price is very  
high. I hope a less expensive paperback edition will follow after some  
time.
Sincerely,
M?ns
