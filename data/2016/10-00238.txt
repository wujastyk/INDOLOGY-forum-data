Re: [INDOLOGY] Translation of ya??ihastaya
Hello Harry Spier,
I did my PhD on the early iconography of the a??adikp?las (book is
available on Academia: https://www.academia.edu/3029535/The_Gods_of_the_
Directions_in_Ancient_India_Origin_and_Early_Development_
in_Art_and_Literature_until_c._1000_A.D._), and V?yu is very often seen as
holding a flagstaff. This is in fact his most prominent attribute. As far
as I remember, *ya??i* was not mentioned in those texts, but only dhvaja or
pat?k?, and the respective images show the god with a banner ? mostly with
the flag portion being a long streamer.
Hope this helps somehow.

*Betreff:* [INDOLOGY] Translation of ya??ihastaya
Dear list members:
A g?yatr? mantra mantra to V?yu is:
sarvapr???ya vidmahe
ya??ihast?ya dh?mahi
tan no v?yu? pracoday?t
I've seen a translation of ya??ihast?ya as "holding the mace" but are
statues or pictoral representations of V?yu, and if so  with a mace?
but Monier-Williams also  has a meaning of ya??i as "sacrificing" which he
says comes from a commentator on Panini 3-3-110 .
 By any chance could someone point out the commentator and point me to the
passage MW refers to.
Also based on that definition of ya??i does a translation of ya??ihast?ya
as "to the one who sacrifices with his hands" make sense. refering to the
wind fanning the flames of the sacrifice.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
