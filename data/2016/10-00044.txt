[INDOLOGY] Indologist at Center of Sexual Harassment Mess at Berkeley
Dear Walter,
Of course, you are unquestionably right. But you will never win. There 
are so many people, in this list as in the world at large, eager to 
flock together under the banners of political correctness, gender 
solidarity and what not. On the other hand, most people who share you 
views will not speak up, lest they should imperil their popularity. So, 
the more vocal majority shall have their way, no matter how utterly 
meaningless it may be to discuss the merely *factual/* /behaviour of 
Caitra, Maitra or Vi??uya?as (as contrasted with discussing general 
*principle* questions touching on Indology, like censorship in India 
etc.) in an indological list.
