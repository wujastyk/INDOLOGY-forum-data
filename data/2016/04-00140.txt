[INDOLOGY] (senza oggetto)
Dear Indologists,
I remember there is a publication about the connection of Vishnu's avataras and the tribal/non Aryan world, but I'm not able to find it again and I forget title and author. Maybe someone could help me to find it out?
I wish I have not just dreamt it!
Best,
Paolo
