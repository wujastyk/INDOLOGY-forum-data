[INDOLOGY] Diacriticals in unicode, single or multiple glyphs
Dear Harry, the documentation in the "document header" of each SARIT file
notes that the encoding is IAST, and notes where that differs from the ISO
standard.  Thus, the document header of the Astangahrdayasamhita file, to
pick one at random, has this statement:
Editorial Description
The published edition from which this e-text was transcribed is printed in
the Devan?gar? script. The electronic text below is in a lossless
transliteration using the Latin alphabet. The transliteration scheme used
is the IAST (The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration>).
IAST differs in small ways from ISO 15919, but is preferred by most working
Sanskrit scholars. Conversion of this file to ISO 15919 can be achieved by
performing the following replacements throughout the file: ? -> r? and ? ->
?
Text divison is as Devan?gar? ("ityevam" not "ity evam".)
Initial vowel elision for avagraha is reversed and marked with a + sign:
e.g., "prathamo+adhy?ya?"
The principle behind the SARIT repository is that the e-texts should be
documented, so that any quirks or editorial decisions are explict and
up-front.   In addition, there is a revision history for each file.  So if
you take the file and do something to it, you brieflly note what you've
done before re-uploading the file.
Best,
Dominik
