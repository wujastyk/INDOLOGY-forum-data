In the chapter of the medical *??r?gadharasa?hit?* about prognostication
from dreams (?ubh??ubhasvapnapar?k??), dreams about black people are
mentioned.

atha ?ubh??ubhasvapnapar?k?? tatra du?svapnalak?a??ni

svapne?u nagn?nmu?????ca raktak????mbar?v?t?n vya?g???ca
vik?t?n*k????n*sap???ns?yudh?napi badhnato nighnata?c?pi dak?i???

labhate vy?dhi? rog? y?tyeva pa?cat?m 16

If a healthy person sees any of the following kinds of men or women in a
dream, then he will become sick, and if already sick, he will pass away:
naked people, bald people, people dressed in red and black clothes,
cripples, misshapen people, blacks, people with snares or weapons,
people tying up or murdering others, people located in a southerly
direction, or riding buffaloes, camels, or donkeys.
