Article in Science magazine on the Dutch push to make ALL scientific
literature ?open access? by 2020.

*"E.U. urged to free all scientific papers by 2020"*

Science magazine, which is notorious for keeping nearly everything behind
paywalls, didn?t have the nerve to do it in this case, for obvious reasons.

The reader comments at the end are worth seeing too.
