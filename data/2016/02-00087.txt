[INDOLOGY] History of Science in South Asia: new journal URL
The open-access journal *History of Science in South Asia* now has its own
permanent URL:  hssa-journal.org
If you link to the journal, please use this new URL, and not the older one,
hssa.sayahna.org.  The Sayahna Foundation gave the journal tremendous
support in its first years, and we remain grateful to them and on good
terms.  But by mutual agreement, the journal has now moved to a new host
platform, at the University of Alberta, that offers several technical and
administrative advantages.  The new URL, hssa-journal.org, means that these
changes of underlying technology, and any future ones, need not concern
readers or contributors.  The URL will be the address of record for the
long term, whatever future arrangements may be made.
Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
HSSA editorial board.
