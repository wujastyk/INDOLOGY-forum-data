[INDOLOGY] Finding two Puranic slokas
Hi Nicole,
For what it's worth, the Sanskrit for the Padma Pur??a-attributed verse you
are looking for is (with variants found in p?da b):
n?ha? vas?mi vaiku??he na yogi-h?daye?u v? |
mad-bhakt? yatra g?yanti tatra ti??h?mi n?rada //
It is quoted often by Gau??ya Vai??ava authors: In Gop?la Bha??a Gosv?min's
Haribhaktivil?sa (8.284) and J?va Gosv?min's *Bhaktisandarbha *(under
pariccheda 269). Both cite specifically the K?rttikam?h?tmya.
I hope this helps.
Best,
David
