Dear all,

in my recent book ?Homo ritualis?Hindu Rituals and Ist Significance for Ritual Theory? (OUP, 2016, ch. 9), I have elaborated on the relation of P?rvam?m??s? and the practice of ritual as exemplified in the Arthasa?graha and other texts.

Best,
Axel Michaels

Dear Friends,

I find myself intrigued by the idea that there are people today compelled to carry on the karmak???a rituals.

I read a brief passage that alludes to the m?m??s? thought-world as providing textual evidence and injunctions for this practice of reenacting scriptural commandments, which were originally meant for a group of people in a different time and place. However, it only mentions m?m??s? and does not mention any specific author or text.

I would like to read this text but, as I know very little about m?m??s? I do not really know where to start. I thought I might find some help here in locating the passages I seek.

Thank you for your help.
