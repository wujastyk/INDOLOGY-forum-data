[INDOLOGY] Kittel's list
I?d note that there are some important old words in Sanskrit and Tamil that seem to have no satisfactory etymology in either language. Two I have noticed are k?la / k?lam and k?ma / k?mam. Of course it is impossible to generalize from two words ? we don?t have enough data ? but it would be interesting to take the ?ni??dic? words in Hindi and see if there are Dravidian correlates. 
I?d ask Suresh why Tamil, the southernmost Dravidian language, is the most conservative. If Dravidian speakers had entered India (from the east?) and moved through a huge territory of ?Ni??dic? (and other?) speakers, one would expect Tamil to be far more changed from Proto-Dravidian than it is. George
