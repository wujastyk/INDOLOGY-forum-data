[INDOLOGY] dna and castes
Dear Prof. Sathaye,
You agreed that one may reasonably argue that the corporal metonymy of
var?a in the Puru?as?kta is non-hierarchical and instead based on a vision
of organic unity. My focus was only that.
The rest of your post when discussed may take us back to the same old
beaten track of varNa-caste distinction , varNa as textual and caste as
real, their mutual independence and influence and so on and so forth.
