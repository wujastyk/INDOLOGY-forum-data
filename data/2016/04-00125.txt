[INDOLOGY] Fwd: New publication
Dear all,
I'm not certain of the situation elsewhere but here in Australia
increasingly it is the preference for university libraries to purchase
books in its electronic form - with many of the older physical books being
liquidated or placed into storage. Many Humanities librarians are directed
by university policy to purchase the electronic rather than the physical
copy.
This purchasing policy direction seems irreversible and seems to weaken the
notion of a beautifully produced physical book that will last 100 years on
a library shelf somewhere. This purchasing model also makes inter-library
loan much more difficult as the library's purchase of that particular book
is bound only to registered users of that particular book.
It's no surprise to me either that often the electronic copy is as
expensive as the physical copy. We also shouldn't forget that University
libraries are having their budgets cut (especially in the Humanities) at
precisely the same time as some publishers like Brill are increasing their
prices.
Academics don't exist in an ethical bubble. If academic authors choose
publishers that are simply unaffordable to individuals and libraries then
they participate in a system that is putting valuable research in the hands
of fewer and fewer people - at a time when the Humanities are under
unprecedented threat from politicians and university administrators.
I don't see how this can remain tolerable.
Kind regards,
Antonio
