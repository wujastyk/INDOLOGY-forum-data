[INDOLOGY] glass in ancient India
P. K. Gode might have an article on it in one of his books of kleine schriften. I'm away from home right now and can't check.

Can anyone point me to publications on the making and use of glassware in ancient India? I am particularly interested in bottles (k?p?), as these appear relatively late in medical literature in the context of alchemical procedures.
Many thanks!
