[INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari on Mac
Another happy discovery yesterday was that OpenOffice for Mac is able to
display characters with multiple markings like ???, ???, ???, r???? etc.
So, if one is writing something that needs characters with such multiple
markings on Mac, it is possible to do a document in OpenOffice and save it
as a pdf to preserve these character-markings.  I hope someday MS Word for
Mac will be able to do that.  At least, for now, we can happily do Unicode
Devanagari on MS Word for Mac.
