Subject: [INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock

It is perfectly clear that there are fundamental differences of opinion,
including two very different views of what scholarship (especially
historical scholarship) should do and what its responsibilities to the past
and the present are. But it is also clear from the petition and many other
cases that Malhotra and his followers purposely distort Pollock's arguments
in order to make them accord with the caricature they have presented. They
need to believe that he is a present-day Thomas Macaulay who has "deep
antipathy" to "Indian culture." That, in the end, is what this petition is
about. The point is simply to try to harass, malign, and discredit people
who write things that don't always and entirely accord with a particular
vision of the Indian past (or present, as seems to be more relevant here)
using the divisive and ugly rhetoric that Malhotra has coined ("insiders"
and "outsiders," "sepoys," "Orientalists," "Macaulayites," etc.).

I would say that Malhotra and his followers are free to raise money for
their own series of books that will duly reflect their vision of the Indian
past, but they have actually done this, and anyway that's not the point:
it's to *stop* the people they disagree with.
