[INDOLOGY] Indologist at Center of Sexual Harassment Mess at Berkeley
Might I draw the gentle readership?s attention to the purpose of this list
as published on their guidelines page (http://listinfo.indology.info/):
INDOLOGY forum for Classical South Asian studies:
INDOLOGY is an internet discussion group whose primary purpose is to
provide a *forum* for discussion *among professional scholars of classical
Indian* (South Asian) *civilization*. *The central focus of the list is the
history and culture of ancient and classical India* [...]
It is clear from this statement ? but also from the general practice
followed so far by its members ? that the list is to focus on research
pertaining to ?ancient and classical India?  ? but not to pursuing the
immoral conduct of selected American South Asianists. To this day it has
served the purely scholarly purpose very well indeed.
I am concerned that the shift now introduced towards naming and shaming is
not only a violation of the guidelines above, but will undermine the
reputation of the list and make scholars, who feel disgusted by public
pillorying, turn away from it. After all, it is for the courts to assess,
for the media to publicize, and for the tabloids to expose.
I can see no scholarship in any of it which would befit this list.
It is certainly legitimate to take an interest in the morals of South Asian
scholars. Whoever does so and considers the issue important enough might
perhaps want to establish something like The American South Asianists
Immorality Discussion Forum. I really don?t think we should subscribe to
such news feed here on this list.
Regards,
WS
