[INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari on Mac
Hans,
     Just tested your suggestions with ABC Extended keyboard layout, and
this does work in TextEdit and in Gmail, but not in MS Word.  I tried to
copy and paste from EextEdit into Word, and the Word was not able to show
the stacking of three diacritics like ???.  Glad to know that such
combinations are possible at least on some platforms.  Thanks, Hans, for
solving one of my long-standing problems.  With best wishes,
Madhav
