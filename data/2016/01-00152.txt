[INDOLOGY] dna and castes
Dear Nityanand,
Statements on the superiority of Brahmins are very common in the Veda.
Consider, for example, ?atapatha Br?hma?a 2.2.2.6 where brahmins are
described as human gods:
(Eggling's translation)
"Verily, there are two kinds of gods; for, indeed, the gods are the gods;
and the Br?hmans who have studied and teach sacred lore are the human gods.
The sacrifice of these is divided into two kinds: oblations constitute the
sacrifice to the gods; and gifts to the priests that to the human gods, the
Br?hmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. With oblations one
gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the
Br?hmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. Both these kinds of gods,
when gratified, place him in a state of bliss."
Same statement can be found in  ?B 2.4.3.14.  On the relation to K?atriyas
consider ?B 4.1.4.6 (again, in Eggling's translation):
"Hence it is quite proper that a Br?hman should be without a king, but were
he to obtain a king, it would be conducive to the success (of both). It is,
however, quite improper that a king should be without a Br?hman, for
whatever deed he does, unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein he succeeds
not. Wherefore a Kshatriya who intends to do a deed ought by all means to
resort to a Br?hman, for he verily succeeds only in the deed sped by the
Br?hman."
It's quite natural for texts composed by brahmins to elevate their own
status over the other var?as, isn't it?
Ofer.
