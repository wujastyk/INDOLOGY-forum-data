*Dear Indologists,*
anyone may sand me the translation of the
*B?had?ra?yaka Upani?ad: *6.4.13.20-22
I know it was translated here:
S?nart, E. (ed. and trans.). 1934. *B?had?ra?yaka Upani?ad*. Paris: Les
Belles Lettres
However other editions will be welcome, and if someone has the Sanskrit
transliteration I would be very gratful
*With the best regards,*
*Paolo*
