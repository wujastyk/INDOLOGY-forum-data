Dear list members,

Does anybody by any chance have a pdf file of

JACOBI, Hermann (1888). "On Rudra?a and Rudrabha??a", Wiener Zeitschrift
f?r die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. 2 (pp. 151-156).

?

It is the very first article of what became a sort of exchange
of opinions between Jacobi and Pischel.
I collected pdfs of the later articles of this exchange, but I am
missing the first episode, so to speak.

With best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
