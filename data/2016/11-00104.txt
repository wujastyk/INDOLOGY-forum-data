Dear list members,
Does anybody by any chance have a pdf file of
JACOBI, Hermann (1888). "On Rudra?a and Rudrabha??a", Wiener Zeitschrift
f?r die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. 2 (pp. 151-156).
?
It is the very first article of what became a sort of exchange
of opinions between Jacobi and Pischel.
I collected pdfs of the later articles of this exchange, but I am
missing the first episode, so to speak.
With best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
