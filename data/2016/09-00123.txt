[INDOLOGY] Two terms
Dear Michael,
DCS - Digital Corpus of Sanskrit notes two separate verses:
GarPur, 1, 2, 59.2
<http://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=431156>
 *yak?i *o?u?sv?h?j?p? vidyaya? g?ru?? par? /
and
GarPur, 1, 19, 20.2
<http://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=432877>
 o? *pak?i* sv?h? //
Sanskrit text (published by Chowkhamba Vidyabhavan, ed. by Shri Ramtej
Pandey) retains both, *yak?i *and *pak?i*.
Different contexts, though. *yak?i mantra *seems to be related to reviving
burnt beings, *pak?i mantra - *to curing from poisoning (relationship
between Garuda and serpents is obvious in this case).
Is the text really corrupt? I have my doubts.
