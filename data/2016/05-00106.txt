[INDOLOGY] Pdf request
Dear Members of the List,
I would be most grateful for a pdf of the following study:
   -
   Banerji [1931] 1998, *The Haiyayas of Tripuri and their Monuments*.
   Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India, 23. New Delhi.
I have found only a very bad quality pdf on DLI.
With many thanks in advance,
