[INDOLOGY] PDF request: Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition.
Dear Indologists,
I'm looking for a pdf copy of
Julia Leslie (ed.). 1996. *Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in
Indian Tradition*. New York: Routledge.
I'd like to read all the book, but I'm particularly interested in chapter 5
"menstruation myths".
Best,
Paolo
