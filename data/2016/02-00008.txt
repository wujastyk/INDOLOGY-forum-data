[INDOLOGY] Contact information for P. Pratap Kumar?
Dear List,
We are finishing up editing contributions to the Frits Staal Memorial
volume.  Mr. Kumar is Emeritus Professor at the University of KwaZulu
Natal, South Africa.  We were happy to accept a paper by him and we have
gone through the early stages with him successfully.  But recently we have
not received replies from him.
If anyone knows him and can send us contact information [off-list, please],
we would be most grateful.
Thank you,
George Thompson
