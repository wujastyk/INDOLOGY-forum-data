[INDOLOGY] query about an inscribed object
It reads (with spaces added)
?????? ??? ?????? [?] ??? ?????? ??? ?????
?????? = Artisan
??? ?????? [?] = Name of the artisan Vira Nanare [?]
??? ?????? = Native of Jodhpur
??? ????? = Of the Suthar (carpenter) caste
The language is Hindi/Rajasthani, and the text simply gives the name of the
artisan who made this. This carpenter was from Jodhpur and belonged to the
Suthar (carpenter) community.
Looks like a hand made gun or pistol from Rajasthan.
