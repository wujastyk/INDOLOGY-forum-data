Subject: [INDOLOGY] query about an inscribed object
In-Reply-To: <CAFdBLNhqPc9yWKPe6djb599_SR1SopFkbzOJrkVtMMWcAqXvYA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CAATk=rC9OrpJo+07ja5RCofLKw76be5wOH0DqjNS5dta9tBAkQ@mail.gmail.com>

It reads (with spaces added)

?????? ??? ?????? [?] ??? ?????? ??? ?????

?????? = Artisan
??? ?????? [?] = Name of the artisan Vira Nanare [?]
??? ?????? = Native of Jodhpur
??? ????? = Of the Suthar (carpenter) caste

The language is Hindi/Rajasthani, and the text simply gives the name of the
artisan who made this. This carpenter was from Jodhpur and belonged to the
Suthar (carpenter) community.

Looks like a hand made gun or pistol from Rajasthan.
