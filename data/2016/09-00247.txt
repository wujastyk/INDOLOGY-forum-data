Dear Colleagues,


[cid:d51cc096-3bb5-23ce-c35f-aed270644b32]



I'm delighted to announce an upcoming conference dedicated to the De Jong Collection, the archives and books of the distinguished scholar in Buddhist studies and South Asian religions Jan Willem de Jong, which was acquired by the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, in 2000 (http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/collserv/dejong.shtml).

"Discovering De Jong" will take place on November 23-24, 2016 on the University of Canterbury campus, Christchurch New Zealand.

The keynote will be given by Prof Paul Harrison (George Edwin Burnell Professor of Religious Studies, Stanford University)  entitled "Jan Willem De Jong: The Reviewer Reviewed".

Other presentations relating to aspects of the collection will be made by Joanna Condon, Simon Daisley, Elizabeth Guthrie-Higbee, Royce Wiles, Jane Buckingham, Arin Basu, Jambugahapitiya Dhammaloka,  myself, and several others.

Please contact me if you wish to make a conference contribution.

There will also be an open panel discussion about the guardianship of such collections now and for the future.

The conference dinner will be on the evening of Wednesday 23rd November.

We welcome you and your colleagues to come!  Please circulate the announcement and don't hesitate to send me any questions!

With best wishes,
Clemency
