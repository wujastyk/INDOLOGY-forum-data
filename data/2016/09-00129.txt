[INDOLOGY] Two terms
Dear colleagues,
Almost identical passages are found in the *Th?pava?sa*: *The chronicle of
the Th?pa and the Th?pava?sa: Being a Translation and Edition of
V?cissaratthera?s Th?pava?sa*, by N.A. Jayawickrama, London 1971: Luzac
(Sacred Books of the Buddhists / Pali Text Society, v. 28; Unesco
Collection of Representative Works), pp. 182f.
Jayawickrama translated the passages in question as follows:
Sakka, the king of the deities addressed Vissakamma: 'Ajatasattu, my dear,
has done the enshrining of the relics ; you provide protection there', and
despatched him. He came and set up *a contraption with a number of figures
of ferocious animals* and setting up inside the relic chamber (another
contraption) which made the wooden figures bearing crystal coloured swords
revolve with the speed of the wind, he had it all joined to one pin, had a
rampart of granite in the form of a 'brick-hall' 6 built, and having it
covered on top with a single (stone-slab) had earth thrown in and the
ground levelled and had a granite thiipa established upon it. (*ibid. *p.
46).
Cf. also *D?ghanik?ya??hakath???k? L?natthava??an?*, ed. Lily De Silva,
London 1970: Luzac, vol. 2, p. 246, ll. 14ff. *v??asa?gh?tayantan ti
