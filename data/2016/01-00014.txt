Subject: [INDOLOGY] amrita
Message-ID: <CALNcvFvcNiC4ROK4aSYjeN4NLEXn2xSHRYeRrZZEMCtdDnNQ4A@mail.gmail.com>

A Happy New Year wishes to all INDOLOGY denizens --- from frosty Poland

and

a question:

the earliest mention of amrita - not as an adjective - but as a substance,
to be shared or fought for?
