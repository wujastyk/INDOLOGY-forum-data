[INDOLOGY] Help with a quotation
Dear friends and colleagues,
I was unable to identify the following verse which appears in the  
Pram??av?rttik?la?karanibandha of Yam?ri with reference to a  
Vidagdhama??ana (sic.). The verse does not seem to appear in any of  
the editions of the Vidagdhamukhama??ana. The manuscript reads:
?ha ca vidagdhama??ane
sarva??strakal??i?ya?uddh?n?? nika?opala? |
aha? kavitvavakt?tvakusumai? kusum?kara? ||
I will be grateful for any help.
With best wishes,
Eli Franco
