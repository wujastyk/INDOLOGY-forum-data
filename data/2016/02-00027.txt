[INDOLOGY] Sentence ends
Dear Colleague,
I address the issue in my contribution to Peter Scharf?s edited volume on Sanskrit syntax, but my observations won?t (can?t) provide the kind of definite answer that you may be looking for.
If you don?t have access to Peter Scharf?s volume I could send you a copy of my contribution offlist.
All the best,
Hans Henrich
