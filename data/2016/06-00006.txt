=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Save_the_Date:_Second_EAAA_conference_in_Z=C3=BCrich:_24.-27._August_2017?=
Dear colleagues and friends,
on behalf of the board of the European Association of Asian Art and Archaeology (EAAA), I am happy to announce the
Second EAAA conference in Zurich: 24.-27. August 2017.
The date was chosen so as not to coincide with the scheduled 15th EAJS conference, which takes place from 30. August - 2. September in Lisbon, Portugal (http://www.eajs.eu/?id=305). For anyone traveling from afar, it might even make sense to combine the two events.
Timeline:
30. June 2016: official call for papers
15. November 2016: Submission of panel and paper proposals
28. February 2017: Notification of acceptance
31. March 2017: early bird registration deadline
31. May 2017: conference program published
Abstracts:
follow the AAS standard: 250 words for both panel proposal, and paper abstracts
Membership:
A membership of EAAA is a prerequisite for panel and paper applications ?
annual membership fees are a mere 30 ?, or 10 ? for students, and we welcome donations!: http://www.ea-aaa.eu/members

and hope for your participation in the Second EAAA conference,
Julia Hegewald.
