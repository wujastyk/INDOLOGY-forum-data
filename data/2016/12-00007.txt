Subject: [INDOLOGY] Hindi spelling changes and Manaki grammar book

Manak Hindi Grammar book is not the name of any specific book.

Maanak (in the sense of standard) is a generic word prefixed to many Hindi
grammar book names.

To insist on the vowel in the (C)V(V)_# position , in stead of CV(V)y/vV#
is guided by the preference for the older (Prakrit grammar rule based ?)
form.
