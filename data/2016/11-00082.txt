I am very sorry, but I don't quite understand under what entry of ya??i
Boehtlingk would indicate any such meanings as sacrifice or sacrificing?
He carefully distinguishes ya??i (1) from ya??i (2). He indicates meanings
for ya??i (1) (the flagstaff semantics), but circumspectively avoids to
assign a meaning to ya??i (2), as he considers the latter a mere (scribal
or printing or transmissional) error for i??i. As a wrong word formation /
wrong reading, it is not supposed to connote a reliable meaning. Therefore
he avoided to give one.
Boethlingk deliberately removed almost all textual references from his
second edition with a view to saving space for more entries as a result of
adapting it to the then current state of research. This is why the second
edition contains more lemmata and additional meanings as compared to the
first one. The first one, on the other hand, is packed with textual
references.
