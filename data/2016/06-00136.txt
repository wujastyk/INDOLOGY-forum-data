An international project on the history of mathematical sciences in Sanskrit sources has been awarded a five-year grant from New Zealand?s funds for research excellence, the Rutherford Discovery Fellows, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.


The 5-year project is entitled ?New perspectives on the history of the exact sciences in second millennium Sanskrit sources?.


As part of the activities of this project, the investigators are offering a PhD scholarship. The scholarship will provide an annual living allowance/stipend of NZ$20,000 and full tuition costs while in New Zealand. It is tenable for study towards the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the appropriate department or program on the topic of the history of math- ematical sciences, at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand (http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).


The successful awardee will research and write a PhD thesis under a supervisory committee including the Principal Investigator, Dr Clemency Montelle, Associate Investigator, Dr Kim Plofker, and, where appropriate, scholars at associated institution(s). The thesis topic will relate to the project goals, and focus on some aspect of second millennium Sanskrit exact sciences e.g., a critical edition with translation and commentary of a previously unpublished text on Sanskrit computational astronomy or mathematics, or related disciplines.
