 Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Early Representations of OM
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranganathaswamy_Temple,_Srirangam has the following description. "The vimanam(shrine over the sanctum sanctorum), the Ranga vimana is shaped like omkara (om symbol) and is plated withgold."Similar descriptions of Vimana being in Pranava shape is given for many Tamil Nadu temples.e.g. here:https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GTMTQLuCNSMC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=ancient+temple+om+shape&source=bl&ots=bBvUihgOMi&sig=usYmgy4MXCL4dNcyu-HJ1DpaUSc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9yu2QksfMAhVGk5QKHQKtAYU4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&q&f=false

I'm more than happy to forward the articles sent to me on OM but none
of them were about the representation of OM.
