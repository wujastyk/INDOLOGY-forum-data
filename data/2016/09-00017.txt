[INDOLOGY] pAnIya and buDana
Many thanks to Madhav Deshpande and Walter Slaje for the additional 
information about bu?/bru?/etc. The text from which my quotation was 
taken most probably originated in or near present-day Gujarat, so the 
Marathi vernacular may indeed be relevant.
I'm still wondering about the earliest use of p?n?ya to denote water to 
swim (or drown) in, as opposed to drinking.
