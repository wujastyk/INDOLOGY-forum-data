Subject: [INDOLOGY] How bhagavAn is written in devanagari manuscripts and printed editions
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQHRMhVnGurA_FhRUXA13EBBk0HvhpB08LOtV4eee15Z9A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Firstly happy Navaratri.

Secondly I was told by a good sanskritist that the word bhagavAn is always
written in devanagari -with a space after it as a sign of respect even if
it would normally be joined to the following letter in devanagari.  I did a
quick search of the texts in the Muktabodha digital library and I found
that was true about 50% of the time.
i.e.

?????? ???????? .............. ?????? ????? ................ ??????
???????????

NOT
?????????????? ............... ??????????? .....................
?????????????????

Can any of the list members tell meif  not joining bhagavAn to the
following word based on some scriptural statement.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
