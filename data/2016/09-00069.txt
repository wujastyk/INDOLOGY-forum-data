[INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks
I completely agree with Bob Goldman. There are many scholars who depend on
philologists and linguists to read and interpret texts to provide them with
the information in the text. Often they have developed other academic
skills that are of value to the academic community and by combining their
work with well translated texts can certainly lead to new insights.
