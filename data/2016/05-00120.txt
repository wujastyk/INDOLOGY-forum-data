[INDOLOGY] by chance, accidentally
The mythical story in question serves as an instrument of legitimation and
prestige. As I would see it - the element of "pure chance" contained in the
story makes it possible to treat new cultic practices as *safe*.
No element of planned revolt there, but deep changes in the traditional
pattern of religious life: broader base of social participation,
empowerment of women, new class of priests.
