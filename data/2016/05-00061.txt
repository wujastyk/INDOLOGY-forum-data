Subject: [INDOLOGY] Destruction of Buddhist monasteries and other	establishments
Message-ID: <CAFUHw7655emMrqxaU7XXOVf_tiKZJjdm086pEZfhOoTE7kL1Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,
Can any one refer me to a comprehensive discussion of the archaeological
evidence of the destruction/appropriation of Buddhist monasteries and other
religious establishments in pre-Islamic period?...Any thing beyond the
writings of Richard Davis and Richard Eaton!
