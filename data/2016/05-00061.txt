[INDOLOGY] Destruction of Buddhist monasteries and other	establishments
Dear List,
Can any one refer me to a comprehensive discussion of the archaeological
evidence of the destruction/appropriation of Buddhist monasteries and other
religious establishments in pre-Islamic period?...Any thing beyond the
writings of Richard Davis and Richard Eaton!
