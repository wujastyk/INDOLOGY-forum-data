[INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock
Dear Jay and members of Indology,
As far as I can see, the petion still lists as no. 5 "Prof. V. Kutumba
Sastry, President, International Association of Sanskrit Studies, Former
Vice Chancellor, Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi". Apperently Prof.
Sastry has not taken the trouble to clarify in which function he signed the
petition. However, even if he signed the petition as a private person, this
would in my view not recommend him vry much for being the president of the
IASS, because I see the wording and the spirit of the petition
contradicting very much the spirit of the constitution of the IASS.
With best wishes,
Philipp Maas
