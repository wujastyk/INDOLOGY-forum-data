Dear Matthew,
Thanks for this information. I have never read the *Saundarananda*, or for
that matter, even the k?vyas of K?lid?sa. However, this case may be a
little different.
According to the story, R?ma uttered this first ever ?loka spontaneously,
upon seeing a male *krau?ca* crane killed by a hunter when in the midst of
courtship or mating. So these aorist verbs presumably would have been what
he and others then used in speech. They would not have been deliberately
employed to display erudition.
The specific past sense that the aorist tense signifies was a matter of
question in classical Sanskrit. Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar in his 1868
Preface to his *Second Book of Sanskrit* acknowledges this, and says that
he read the *Aitareya Br?hma?a* to determine its specific usage when the
language was still living. He found that the aorist was there used ?when
the persons in the story are represented as speaking with one another,? as
we have here in V?lm?ki?s first ?loka. By contrast, writes Bhandarkar, ?In
this work, wherever stories are told, the so called Imperfect or the
Perfect is always used, and the Aorist never occurs.?
So V?lm?ki?s first ?loka, in its usage of the aorist, agrees with the
normal usage found in the *Aitareya Br?hma?a*, taken as representative of
when the aorist was a still living form.
