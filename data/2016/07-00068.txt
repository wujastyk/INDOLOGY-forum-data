Dear Arthur & list,

I would rather connect the name Utta?ka to root TA?K ?live in distress?, whence ta?ka ?a miserable life? and ?grief produced from separation from a beloved object? (MW, Apte), which seems to suit very well his character and epic vicissitudes: he lives a miserable life as a lingering brahmac?rin, and grieves for the loss of precious objects ? the earrings (= talismans of youth?), the ambrosia in different (versions of ) myths belonging to his corpus.

You may wish to have a look at my paper ?Utta?ka?s Quest?? (available here<https://www.academia.edu/10239803/Utta%E1%B9%85ka_s_Quest>) offering a comprehensive interpretation of the Utta?ka corpus as related to the universal mythical theme of the quest for immortality.

Yes, quite wild, if I may say so.

Tak?aka as 'builder' (Polish 'budowniczy', Czech 'stavitel'), 'construction foreman' sounds reasonable, quite convincing.

Now, Uttanka? One who 'ruins', 'lays waste' (Turner 5628, ta?c ? ?contract, coagulate?)?

See this Mbh episode (Kumbakonam 1906 Ed.), where Uttanka, while trying to enter Taksaka's underground home, violently destroys its entrance.
