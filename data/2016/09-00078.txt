Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit material on philosophy of education
Message-ID: <6C234623-C051-4181-94D4-E5E75C29526A@oneonta.edu>

Dear all,

A colleague of mine sent me the following question:

?I am teaching a course on education and its objectives. We do a fair bit of philosophy in this course but most of our sources are European. Do you think there are certain Sanskrit treatises (hopefully available in English) which belong in a course on the philosophy of education??

Would any of you be able to comment on this question?

Best wishes,
Toke
