[INDOLOGY] New publication
Dear all,
I am glad that people finally start protesting against Brill's overprized books.
As a matter of principle I have not bought a single book from Brill during my
entire long career in Indological pursuits.
Maybe we should all start boycotting Brill?
Best regards to all
Stella Sandahl
