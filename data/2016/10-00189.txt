[INDOLOGY] protocol of Google Books ...?
Just because your thesis *says* you have copyright doesn't mean it really
is.  Since UMI was involved, it's very likely indeed that they got
copyright from you at some point, legally.  Probably UPenn had the right to
give UMI copyright.  In which case, Google would have had to negotiate with
UMI, not you, for the right to scan your thesis.
I still think Google would probably take down your thesis if you asked them.
