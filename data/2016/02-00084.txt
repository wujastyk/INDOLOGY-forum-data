[INDOLOGY] Job opportunity
On behalf of Peter Bisschop and myself, I copy the announcement below, with
the addition that Peter and I would be absolutely delighted if someone with
Sanskrit (etc) interests were to be interested in this opportunity:
The Faculty of Humanities at Leiden University invites applications for 2
fulltime assistant professorships in Digital Humanities.
Assistant Professor Digital Humanities with focus on text analysis (1.0
fte)
Assistant Professor Digital Humanities with focus on data-analysis and
visualization (1.0 fte)
The Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities (LUCDH) is recruiting
two assistant professors to develop innovative research projects that take
full advantage of digital sources and methods, to design and implement
teaching programmes in Digital Humanities and to collaborate with digital
humanities research across the university.
The two hires will be in complementary areas of the Digital Humanities
(DH). We are looking for candidates with an area of specialisation in one
of two broader areas. The first position will focus on text analysis
(including text and image mark-up, text-mining, corpus linguistics, named
entity recognition, topic modelling, or machine learning). The other will
focus on the development of data analysis and visualisation platforms
(including database design, visualisation, network analysis, or geographic
information systems).

These hires are part of a broader investment in DH at Leiden. The
University Library is also recruiting for two positions (in Dutch:

future.
