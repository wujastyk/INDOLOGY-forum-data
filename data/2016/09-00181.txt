[INDOLOGY] New article on Sanskrit
manipulation of this ancient language
Dear Ananya,
Why should they *step out* and *resist*? Whatever the government's efforts,
people aren't going to start speaking/writing Sanskrit.
Do you suspect that replacing some - yes, Islamic and Christian
(Arabic/Persian and English) - parts of Modern Indian Languages
vocabularies with their - yes, Hindu (Sanskrit) equivalents could create
communal tension?
Look at European Languages and the role of Latin/Greek lexemes in their
development, especially late XIXth century. In the case of my language
(Polish) many German(ic) lexemes were being then systematically replaced
with their Latin equivalents. And new Latin/Greek lexemes introduced - to
describe, by one word, new philosophical, scientific, technological,
political concepts.
Yes, there were some people who tried to resist this trend and kind of
re-introduce (largely artificially created) Old-Slavic lexemes. Yes - but
their efforts were soon forgotten.
