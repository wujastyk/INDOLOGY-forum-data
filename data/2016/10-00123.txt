Indian religious discourse, and its historical source.
Why particularly South Indian ? Any special reason?
Before you help me understand that aspect, let me mention a usage similar
to this but different from this:
Krishna is called Kuhanaagopa - a 'pseudo-pastoral' in a highly positive
praising sense: in the sense that he is none other than Bhagavaan
/Paramaatman/ Parabrahman  disguised as a cattle-rearer.
