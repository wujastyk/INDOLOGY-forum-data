[INDOLOGY] J?ti as Caste in Ny?ya?
Correction:
I typed:
3. Those mentioned by Jayanta are not saying BraahmaNatva etc. are *not
like *gotva etc. They are saying exactly the opposite. They are saying
'because braahmanatva etc. are not like gotva etc. the validity of what all
Brahmins have in common can be verified / known only through a different
source of knowledge than the one that can establish what all cows have in
common.
I wanted to say:
