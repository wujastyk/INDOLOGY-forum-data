Indo-European Linguistics/Vergleichende Indoeurop?ische
Sprachwissenschaft," which includes coursework in Greek, Latin, and
Sanskrit historical linguistics. The structure of the degree is sketched
here (both in German and in English):

coming academic year (i.e. in October), please ask her/him to get in touch
with me at the address below within the next week or so; the application
deadline for international students is July 15th.
