[INDOLOGY] In the meantime astrophysicists ... was: Re: Against the petition against Prof. Pollock
The extent to which philology is an exact science depends mainly on the
philologists themselves.
Since the disagreement depends centrally on two diametrically opposed
readings of one and the same text it will forever be easy to decide whether
the proposed interpretation was *correct* or not (and whether or not
signatories have joined an *andhaparampar?*), independent of the number of
adherents.
In the meantime astrophysicists, dealing with problems a little more
complicated than understanding a few pages in simple english,  gave a
beautiful example of international cooperation and solidarity -- clearly
with the aim of obtaining further funding in their respective countries ...
see this article co-signed by ca. 1000 (!) professional researchers
representing 133 different institutions in many different countries:

Better to turn around half-way than to err completely: it may still be
possible to withdraw one's signature if it was put without careful
consideration:

NB the finally unsuccesful petition was *launched* by computer scientist
Ganesh Ramakrishnan of IIT Bombay, neither a sanskritist nor a philologist.
