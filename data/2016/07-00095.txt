Dear all,

in the Haravijaya 6.33,

sphu?ahi?kriy?dinidhan?vas?nat? -
pratipannapa?cavidhabhaktisau??havam |
druhi?ena s?ma bahuvartma g?yat?
jagati tvam eva gu?agaura g?yase || 33 ||

a series of verses begins in which ?iva is praised in musicological terms,
starting with the S?maveda recitation: "Oh Gu?agaura, by Brahman who is
singing the s?man which is of many paths [and] in which excellence of a
fivefold division has been obtained, which clearly has hi?kriy? at the
beginning and nidhana at the end, it is you only in the world who are being
sung." Utpala comments: "he gu?agaura, brahma?? bahuvartma s?ma g?yat? tvam
eva g?yase, param?tmasvar?patv?t. sphu?a? k?tv? hi?kriy?ditay?
hi?k?r?ditvena nidhan?ntatay? ca ?rita? pa?cavidhay? bhakty? sau??hava?
yatra. tad ukta?: ??v?halak?m? hi?k?ra? prast?va? pratih?raka? | udg?tho
nidhana? ceti pa?cokt?? s?mag?taya? ||? iti. kecin nidhana?abdasya
madhy?rth?bhidh?yitv?d ?dimadhy?nte?u hi?kriyety ?hu? ||" Now I have not
been able to locate the verse he quotes, listing the five s?ma-g?tis and
would appreciate if some S?maveda expert could enlighten me about it. Also
the last sentence is a riddle to me, "some [presumably other commentators
on this verse] say that hi?kriy? is in the beginning, the middle and the
end, because the word 'nidhana' [(technical term of one of these components
of the s?man chant, lit. 'end'] means 'middle'". Can anybody make any more
sense out of this?

Best,

Peter
