[INDOLOGY] aja as ajaya?
Dear Jonathan,
Thank you for the good suggestion that perhaps *chu skyes*, ?water-born,?
is based on **abja*. I would regard this as certain, that the Tibetan
translator was thinking of *abja*. Whether *abja* rather than *aja* was
found in Bhadrabodhi?s Sanskrit manuscript, however, is another question.
In this pioneering translation, the Tibetan translator Gyi jo first made a
draft translation, and then this was divided among his students, the junior
translators, to complete (see Cyrus Stearns, *The Buddha from D?lpo*, 2010
ed., p. 327 note 98). Since this possibly tentative translation, *chu skyes*,
is the only evidence we have for *abja*, against much other evidence, I
must doubt whether *abja* was actually in the Sanskrit manuscript. It seems
more likely that the Tibetan translator simply confused the two words, and
mistook the meaning of *abja* for the meaning of *aja*.
Regarding *nyi ma'i*, ?of the sun,? what caused me to call this
?incomprehensible? is the fact that this genitive occurs at the end of the
Tibetan p?da, and with nothing for it to go with: rgya mtsho rnam rgyal nyi
ma'i | snyigs can nyi ma bcu gnyis pa'o |, corresponding to: samudravijayo 'ja?
| kalk? dv?da?ama? s?ryo |. The Tibetan p?da is short one syllable, which
is obviously needed after *nyi ma'i*, but was apparently omitted by scribal
error. So the Tibetan translator did take this name as something pertaining
to the sun, whether he read it as *jaya* or as *aja*. As for what the word
missing in this Tibetan translation might be, ?[something] of the sun?: V.
S. Apte?s Sanskrit dictionary gives as meaning #9 ?A vehicle of the sun,?
and Monier-Williams gives ?beam of the sun (P?shan),? but neither with a
source reference.
(Thank you for your kind words.)
