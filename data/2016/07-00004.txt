[INDOLOGY] Indra
Dear Howard,
Indra`s visible appearence:
according to RV 10,95,8 Indra is /h?ri-ke?a/ and /h?ri-?ma??ru/, of 
?yellow-red (golden) hair? and ?yellow-red (golden) beard?.
//h?ri / /is also used of the fire, the sun, of lightening and of Indras 
horses - and of the Soma plant.
According to Falk, however, /h?ri / denotes ?yellowish-green to green? 
(Falk, p.85, Soma I and II, BSOAS, Vol. 52, No. 1,1989, pp. 77-90 ),
because this - he thinks - makes that colourful epitheton fit to the 
?bluish green? (Falk, p.85) colour of the ephedra plant. That would make
Indra the first punk of history.
