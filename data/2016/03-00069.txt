[INDOLOGY] Bibliographical information on a lecture by Prof. A.	Aklujkar?
Dear colleagues,
there are several references to a lecture Prof. A. Aklujkar seems to have given in 2010 and 2013 on "Language philosophy in the Mahabharata" (cf. Bronkhorst in "Archetypes and Bottlenecks"; abstract of 2013 the lecture available online). If it has been published I would be obliged for the bibliographical data.
With thanks and best wishes,
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
