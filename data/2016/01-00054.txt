(like Hinglish or Singlish). From a sociological perspective the linguistic
and cultural hegemony of Sanskrit fascinates me. The purifying puristic
prism within which Sanskrit is imprisoned affects the attitudes of
aspirational Sanskrit speakers. It is also the reason for its aesthetic
charm. The people in Jhiri regularly told me '*asm?ka? sa?sk?tam ati?uddha?
bhavi?yati'*. The main reason given for this attitude was that without
speaking Sanskrit in a 'pure' form the metaphysical benefits and
accumulation of *pu?ya* would remain unobtainable. They also felt that to
be a good *de?abhakta?* one ought to speak the *devabh???, *which
incidentally Samskrita Bharati package as the *janabh???, *while asserting
its final incarnation will be the next global lingua-franca or *vi?vabh???*
.

It is worthwhile mentioning that sociolinguists don't really think in terms
of 'grammatical errors' or 'purity' but instead see instances of imperfect
learning as signposts to understand the acquisition process itself. However,I
can understand and appreciate the position of individuals more focused on
their soteriological and patriotic aims.

While the 'pure' yet simplified register (dialect?) of Sanskrit promoted by
Samskrita Bharati is embedded in a quest for national unity and pride,
moral rectitude and a cultural renaissance with global aspirations for
India to become the *vi?vaguru*; how, why and where Sanskrit is spoken
ought to be given more attention. Which is my intention.

###Shameless self promotion###

Having completed my PhD I'm now in the process of trying to find a
post-doctoral position and funding so I can return to India and conduct
extended multi-sited comparative ethnographic field work on non-shastric
communities of Sanskrit speakers across North India. I have a list of 16
potential field sites. Please contact me off list if you have any interest
in helping me with this fundamental part of the project. Here
<https://www.academia.edu/19566419/Post-doc_Research_Proposal> is a link to
a draft research proposal. I would be grateful for any constructive
feedback on how to make this project better.

Thank you ?


All the best,
