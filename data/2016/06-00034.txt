[INDOLOGY] suicide as a result of love
Dear Philipp,
Thank you for the correction: the suicide motif is not in the Purnabhadra version.

Dear all,
in Hara's Ratnavali Sagarika - sure that her love to the king is unsuccesful - will hang 
herself, but luckily the king arrives in time and saves her. There are certainly many other 
examples.
Best,
Klaus

    Dear Dermot and all,
    The story of the "Weaver as Viu" occurs indeed in 
    Purnabhadra's recension of the Pata?catntra as well as in the 
    exemplar of this recension, the so-called textus simplicior. 
    Purnabhadra censored the narrative strongly from the 
    perspective of conservative smarta-Hinduism and left out the 
    motive of suicide out of desire for the princess, which, 
    accordingly only occurs in the textus simplicior.
    For a more comprehensive analysis of the two versions of the 
    narrative see my "On Discourses of Dharma and the 
    Pa?catantra." Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?dasiens 55 
    (2013-2014), p. 5-31, of which you find a pre-print draft 
    version here.
    Best wishes,
    Philipp

    In Purnabhadra's version of the Pancatantra (ed. Hertel 1908 pp. 46-55; tr. A.W. 
    Ryder 1956,
    pp. 89-104), a weaver falls in love with a princess, swoons, then resolves on 
    suicide by fire.
    He is saved by his friend, a chariot-builder or carpenter (rathakAra), who 
    promises to use his
    skill to effect a union, and is spectacularly successful. It's a wonderful story, 
    involving sex,
    politics, and religion.
    This is a mock-heroic example: the motif of suicidal despair resulting from love at 
    first sight,
    which is expected of exalted characters, is transferred to a man of low degree.

    I have the feeling that this is a relatively common motif in story literature. The one 
    example
    that comes to mind is the Prakrit verse romance Lilavati, in which one of the 
    characters
    (Kuvalayavali) has a "gandharva" wedding with a Gandharva (Citragada), and 
    when her
    father finds out and curses them, she is so overcome with shame that she tries to 
    hang
    herself from a tree. She is stopped at the last moment by her mother Rambha. 
    This is around
    v. 658 in A.N. Upadhye's edition.

    Dear List Members
    A colleague, Madhavi Menon, who is writing a book entitled 'A History of Desire in
    India', has asked me the following question. All help appreciated; I will forward 
    your
    responses to her.
    "Are there any narratives in Sanskrit/Buddhist literature/philosophy/history that 
    talk
    about suicide, or atma-hatya, specifically in relation to love and desire?"
    Yours Alex
