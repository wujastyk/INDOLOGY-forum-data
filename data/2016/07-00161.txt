Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sandhi breaks in longer meters
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQHxF7j4NxKcDR5SZ1HPM6ezCGM9OkVNn9A4t+i8rBY18Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

In the longer sanskrit meters (Vasantatilaka for examplbe 14 syllables to a
line) is Sandhi broken after each line or only after the half verse and end
of verse.

Thank you,
Vasishtha
