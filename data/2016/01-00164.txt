[INDOLOGY] Pururavas and the "Six Emperors"
Dear list members,
Is anyone familiar with local (pre-modern) traditions, textual, ritual or
other, involving Pur?ravas (with or without Urva??)?
In addition, I'm searching for the origin of the phrase "??u
cakkiravartti",  "The Six Emperors" (Tami?), a list which has some
variations but usually includes Nala, Pururavas, Ariccantiran and
frequently Mucukuntan and Karttaviriyan?
Thank you,
