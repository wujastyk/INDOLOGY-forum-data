[INDOLOGY] Touching one's nose with the left index finger
Not sure if it would help, but there?s a reference in Old Tamil literature to women?s gossip around town about a woman?s relationship with a man. The reference is ?m?kkin ucci cu??u viral c?rtti (???????? ????? ??????????? ????????). Women talk about the relationship between an unmarried woman and a man, and their gesture is indicated by ?touching the tip of their nose with their index finger.?
Recently, when I was watching a music event on YouTube where Prince Rama Varma was teaching a group of students he touched the tip of his nose with his index finger, perhaps to express ?shame shame? or something like that. I?d have to search for that video again.
So I guess it was a practice in the south.
