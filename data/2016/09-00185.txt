[INDOLOGY] Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
Hello Indologists,
     I found a digital version of Vedic Concordance that uses the Macind
font.  I am wondering how I can get a Unicode version.  Also someone had
prepared a Stardict version of Vedic concordance (bloomfield-vedic-sa.tar.gz
<https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvvasuki%2Fstardict-sanskrit%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fsa-head%2Ftars%2Fbloomfield-vedic-sa.tar.gz&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGtVtaJJBhjebEFF6G4zIJY_9yCYA>),
listed in some old messages, but I am not able to download one.  Any help?
