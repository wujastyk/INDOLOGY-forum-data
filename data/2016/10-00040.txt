[INDOLOGY] Indologist at Center of Sexual Harassment Mess at Berkeley
Dear Walter, 
While I appreciate your point I should draw your attention to the fact that there have been vigorous discussions about censorship in India, a matter that pertains to contemporary Indology but is not explicit concerned with the "history and culture of ancient and classical India." I don't recall members being quick to shut down that discussion.
