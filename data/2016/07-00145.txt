[INDOLOGY] A Question of Rites
Thanks, Palaniappan, for this nice article.  Pune is indeed a leader in
this movement.  Every year, during the Ganesh festival, thousands of women
gather on the streets to chant the Ganesha Atharvashirsha collectively.  It
was my sister who performed the wedding of one of my daughters, and she did
a terrific job of it.
