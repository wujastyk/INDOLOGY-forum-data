Subject: [INDOLOGY] Downloading etexts from TITUS
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQGtoQD1V6ONg-=jXBC20r5y--Skuy=J-16aOh=zwE=+aw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

The TITUS database http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/indexe.htm
\has many sanskrit e-texts not available elsewhere.  But many of the
e-texts on TITUS are marked "restricted download".

Does anyone know what the requirements are to get permission to download
these e-texts.

Many thanks,
Harry Sjpier
