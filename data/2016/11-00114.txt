[INDOLOGY] Downloading etexts from TITUS
Dear list members,
The TITUS database http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/indexe.htm
\has many sanskrit e-texts not available elsewhere.  But many of the
e-texts on TITUS are marked "restricted download".
Does anyone know what the requirements are to get permission to download
these e-texts.
Many thanks,
Harry Sjpier
