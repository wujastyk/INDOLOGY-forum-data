Dear List,

I translated an essay by T. Bloch on 'An Indian Version of the Iranian Legend of S?m' from German about two decades ago. I incidentally found this unpublished translation today, but was unable to get all references regarding it -  I attach, therefore, a page of the translation for identification and pray if anybody is able to support me with the particulars (where it was published, date of issue, etc.).

Regards

DC
