[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] Book
OUP tells me that the book will go on sale at their website tomorrow, and the Amazon feed should refresh over the weekend and then it will appear there too.

Dear All:
Just to let you all know that OUP has just published a paperback edition of my translation of Kau?ilya?s Artha??stra. The hardback was too expensive for most of us, and I hope this will be priced reasonably. Best,
