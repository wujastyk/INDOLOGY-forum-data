[INDOLOGY] Death's Footprint
Dear List,
Two additional notes on mr?ty?? pad?m:
First, thanks to the kindness of Hartmut Buescher, I now have access to a
pdf of my "Pursuit of Hidden Track" paper, and will try to attach it here.
Second, the Thieme paper on Ambrosia is also available in *Indogermaische
Dichtersprache* edited by R.Schmitt for the Wege der Forschung Series, Band
CLXV, 1968.  I have been re-reading it.  This is how Thieme translates
amrta [accent on second syllable] [neuter]: "Leben, Lebenskraft [nicht
"Unsterblichkeit"], heisst also eigentlich "Lebenskraft enthaltend" [p.
114].  Thieme demonstrates that the term amrta, like ambrosia, belongs to
the old IE Dichtersprache.
With best wishes,
George
