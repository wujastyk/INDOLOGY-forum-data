Dear Dermot and Christophe,

yotsya iti does not seem to be a proper example, because it is no compound. I personally would use a hyphen, like so: 

mana-indriya-

Best wishes,
Sven

This makes a space possible, though not necessary. Indeed, such hiatus can occur within a word, which is rare in Sanskrit (e.g. pra'uga "the forepart of the shafts of a chariot; triangle"), but common in Prakrit. Here, it would be very odd to write a space, since it's within a word. I've marked the hiatus with an apostrophe, but Monier-Williams does it with diaeresis/tr?ma (two superscript dots).
