has
the following words:

While the ancient people relied upon heavy and regular monsoons between
9,000 and 7,000 years ago to water their crops, after this period, evidence
at Bhirrana shows people continued to survive despite changing weather
patterns.

?Increasing evidences suggest that these people shifted their crop patterns
from the large-grained cereals like wheat and barley during the early part
of intensified monsoon to drought-resistant species of small millets and
rice in the later part of declining monsoon and thereby changed their
subsistence strategy,? they continued.

However, changing the crops they grew and harvested resulted in the
?de-urbanisation? of cities and no need for large food storage facilities.
Instead, the people swapped to personal storage spaces to look after their
families.

?Because these later crops generally have much lower yield, the organised
large storage system of mature Harappan period was abandoned giving rise to
smaller more individual household based crop processing and storage system
and could act as catalyst for the de-urbanisation of the Harappan
civilization rather than an abrupt collapse,? the team wrote.
