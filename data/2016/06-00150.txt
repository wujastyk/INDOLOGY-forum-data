Dear list members
A slightly edited version of the R?m?ya?a-centric interpretation of the
M?he?varas?tra-s (?ivas?tra-s) in Sanskrit grammar from the ?Prast?van??
(introduction) of the ?Adhy?tmar?m?y??e?p??in?yaprayog???? Vimar?a?? has
been published as a four-page article with the title ?M?he?varas?tre?u
R?makath?? in the upcoming (July 2016) edition of ?Sambh??a?asande?a??
(published by Samskrita Bharati), the largest circulating Sanskrit magazine
in the world. The PDF of the proof is attached with this email. Many thanks
to the editorial board of the magazine for publishing the article. Special
thanks to Vidv?n Janardana Hegde for sharing the proof.
The work ?Adhy?tmar?m?y??e?p??in?yaprayog???? Vimar?a?? was authored
by ?c?rya Giridharal?la Mi?ra ?Praj??cak?u?, now known as Jagadguru
R?m?nand?c?rya Sv?m? R?mabhadr?c?rya, in 1981. It was last published in its
third edition which was edited with more than 1,000 footnotes by me in
2015. The third edition can be read and downloaded under

.
Please forward this to those who may be interested.
Thanks, Nityanand
