[INDOLOGY] 84 lakhs of living beings
In the Prapa?cah?daya (12th-13th century AD?) first chapter on cosmology, the tanubhuvana-prakara?a, p. 2  ll. 3-4 ed. T. Ga?apati ??str?, TSS 45, 1915 (cf. https://archive.org/details/Trivandrum_Sanskrit_Series_TSS : said "not found" but it is there), one reads 84,000 instead of 8,400,000 : 
ja?gamaj?tivi?e?a? catura??tisahasravidha? | sth?varaj?tivi?e?a? catu??a??isahasravidha? |
The  number of 84 thousands is found for yojana's (ViP cr. ed. 2,2.8, MkP cr. ed.49.14 : the height of the Meru), years or, if I remember well, the legendary number of st?pa's established by A?oka; the more fabulous one of 84 lakhs appears for the sorts of ?sana's in the GhSa 2,1. I suppose that there are other examples of such kind.
Best wishes,
