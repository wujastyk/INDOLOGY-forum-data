[INDOLOGY] PDF of 'Catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts in the Sanskrit College Library, Benares' (Allahabad).
Dear List,
I'm looking for a scan of
*:Catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts in the Sanskrit College Library,
Benares *(Allahabad) [ca. 1888].
I can't seem to find this online - might someone have a scan of this they
could share with me?
Many Thanks,
