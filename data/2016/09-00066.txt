[INDOLOGY] pAnIya and buDana
Considering the generalized use of p?n? in Hindi and p??? in Marathi for
all water, not just drinking water, it is conceivable that such a semantic
development had also occurred in the medieval Sanskrit usage.  In Marathi,
we say "nad?l? p??? ?le" (lit: water has come to the river) to describe the
situation of a flood.  It is the same word for water used for bathing or
washing.
