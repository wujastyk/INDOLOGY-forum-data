Many volumes of the JASB are available through this remarkable resource:


<http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/>


I fear however that the 1947 volume is not covered: <http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51678>.


I myself, who have no need for the first edition, am interested in the scan of the book version I see here, but cannot access: <https://www.scribd.com/document/167836854/The-Sakta-Pithas-D-C-Sirkar>.Could anyone download and share?


Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
