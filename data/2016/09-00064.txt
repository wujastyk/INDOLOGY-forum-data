I came across one occurrence, where p?n?ya denotes water in which plants 
grow: ?alha?a (12th cent.) - concerning Su?rutasa?hit? 1.45.17 - glosses 
par?? with p?n?yap???haj? (a plant originating from the water surface). 
Of course, this is not very early. A search with the Digital Corpus of 
Sanskrit might bring about more occurrences.
