[INDOLOGY] RAJTARANGINI
 Dr.Klebanov,
               Thank you for your reference. However,Harshacharita , by Bana, is more of an Eulogy on the 
life and incidents of King Harsha,rather than being on a historical context. As against 
that,VikramankaDevCharita,( Authour-Bilhana) composed at least century ahead of Rajtarangini, in the 11th 
century, contains substantiated historical details on the  time ans society prevailing during Emperor 
VikramaDitya's era.
