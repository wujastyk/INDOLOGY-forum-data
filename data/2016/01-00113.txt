[INDOLOGY] a recent review of the Jamison-Brereton RV translation by Karen Thomson
Dear List,
Thanks to Asko, I do now remember reading an essay by Thomson on the word
graavan.  I took dome interest in it because at about that time I gave a
paper on RV 10.94, in which this word played a prominent role.  This was in
2001 or 2002, at the Third International Vedic Workshop in Leiden.
In any case, I was not convinced by i\her paper, and in fact, as in the
case of this recent paper in TLS, I was rather surprised that it had been
published.  I think that it was at about this time that I stopped reading
JIES.
