[INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari on Mac
I'm shocked.  I don't pay much attention to the Mac world, but I've been
typing Devanagari into everything on my computer for many years (Linux).  I
had no idea that this wasn't possible or easy on a Mac.  Wow.  And the Mac
used to be the byword for multilingual support.  I'm glad it's okay now, at
least.
