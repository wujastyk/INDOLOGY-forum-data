Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sinhala half nasal plus m
Message-ID: <009601d1ef1d$20bf19e0$623d4da0$@gmail.com>

Dear list members,

there is one Sinhala sign consisting of a half-nasal with following ba,

like in a-m-ba (mango). 

 

Unicode has a half-nasal for n, e. g. pa?dita. 

But I could not figure out the corresponding sign for the half-nasal m. 

Since the anusvara ? is also frequent in Sinhala, I am using ? for transcribing the half nasal m, e. g. a?ba.

 

My work does not allow the composition of signs with the help of an additional accent.

 

Anyone came across the Unicode-standard for he half nasal of m?

 

Best
