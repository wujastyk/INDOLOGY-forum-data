[INDOLOGY] Sinhala half nasal plus m
Dear list members,
there is one Sinhala sign consisting of a half-nasal with following ba,
like in a-m-ba (mango). 
Unicode has a half-nasal for n, e. g. pa?dita. 
But I could not figure out the corresponding sign for the half-nasal m. 
Since the anusvara ? is also frequent in Sinhala, I am using ? for transcribing the half nasal m, e. g. a?ba.
My work does not allow the composition of signs with the help of an additional accent.
Anyone came across the Unicode-standard for he half nasal of m?
Best
