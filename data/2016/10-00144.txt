Thanks a lot for this. I had seen the meanings of *rasa* listed in *B?htlingk
and Roth Grosses Petersburger W?rterbuch* (where I did not find any
reference to *???kh?yana G?hya S?tra*), but not in *B?htlingk
Sanskrit-W?rterbuch in k?rzerer Fassung*.
It is useful to know that it is N?r?ya?a?s (N.) commentary that interprets
*rasa* as *pra?ava*. Is a digital edition of this commentary available? My
search on archive, scribd, and DLI drew a blank.
