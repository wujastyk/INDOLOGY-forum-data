Cambridge, entitled "From Word Meanings to Sentence Meaning: Different 
Perspectives in Indian Philosophy of Language".

    The reflection on language and its structures was a major component
    of the Sanskritic intellectual horizon, intimately connected with
    the broader epistemological and soteriological concerns of different
    schools. This led to the emergence of various conflicting
    philosophical views on the nature of the cognition obtained from
    language (??bdabodha). In this respect, a pivotal issue is how
    pad?rthas (the meanings/referents of words) relate to v?ky?rtha (the
    meaning/referent of the sentence). During this one-day colloquium,
    the focus will especially be on the views set forth by the
    P?rva-M?m??s? philosophers (Bh???a and Pr?bh?kara), the Buddhists,
    the Grammarians, and the theoreticians of Ala?k?ra??stra, and on the
    reconstruction of the debate as it developed in the course of the
    first millennium CE.

programme.
