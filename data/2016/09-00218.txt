[INDOLOGY] New article on Sanskrit
Let us take the example of ???? ? and ???? ???? ?
For ease of communication, saying ???? ???? may seem better (than
?????????). But even for ease of communication, ???? ? does not look good (
?????? is the only way you can say that) .
But this question of ease of communication is only modern. ????????? is
natural.
Visandhika pronunciation turns out to be even 'wrong' in compound words
such as ?????????????? ( ???????? ?????? is not correct. )
