For the sake of completeness and clarity (or, as some may think: complexity and confusion), I must add a few words.
(1) To begin with: there are V?ra?aivas of various kinds, who also have organized themselves in different ways. One significant division among the ma?has is whether a ma?ha is one of the so-called pa?cap??has (of which there are five) or a viraktama?ha (innumerable). The relationship between these two groups is a difficult one. Depending on one's point of view, one may say that the section of the V?ra?aiva community that predominantly associates itself with the small group of five consists of (a) descendants of former brahmins, or (b) they are quasi-brahmins, or (c) they are brahmin infiltrators in the V?ra?aiva community who distort and betray the teachings of Basava.
This brings us to questions concerning what constitutes 'real' V?ra?aivism, what Basava really thought about the Vedas and brahminical literature in general, and what is the composition of the V?ra?aiva community with its sub-communities.
To my knowledge, Basava did not really reject the Vedas, but thought them unnecessary (just like temple worship). What he did reject was blind scripturalism, and this made him say scathing things about the Vedas and Vedic learning. (Bhakti, however, is essential.)
A widely held opinion in Karnataka is that the V?ra?aiva families with brahminical airs and aspirations (known as '?r?dhyas') are the descendants of brahmins from Andhra Pradesh (the ?r??ailam area) ? so that fits your [Nagaraj's] observation quite well.
(2) The sub-communal distinction also shows in the attitude toward foreigners (as an example of people from outside). I have always been treated politely and hospitably in viraktama?has. But when I once visited one of the pa?cap??has, not far from Sringeri, in search of their publications (a learned Bangalorean devotee of that ma?ha advised me to go there), the personnel did everything to chase me away as soon as possible. I was not allowed to buy books, not allowed to meet the ma?h?dhipati, not allowed to use the toilet. Therefore I will most probably not go there again (life being too short to waste on such characters). Those people behaved more 'brahminically' than any brahmins I have ever met.
(3) The satisfaction among V?ra?aivas that the court has acknowledged their ved?dhik?ra can be interpreted in more than one way. The aforementioned book by Na?ju???r?dhya goes into theological details like the validity of i??ali?gap?je vs. sth?varali?gap?je (i.e., 'our practices are just as good as brahmin practices!').
But please note: ved?dhyayana (Veda learning) has always been open to all br?hma?as, k?atriyas and vai?yas. Ved?dhy?pana (Veda teaching) was the prerogative of brahmins. I.e., brahmins determined what the Vedas are and mean.
Here I would say: we know that social practice is not so easily changed. E.g., the Indian government has also banned caste discrimination.
Perhaps because Udupi is simply too far away from Gujarat? ;-)
Milk (because it comes from a cow) is the one drink which even an orthodox, purity-minded brahmin may receive from the hands of a non-brahmin. Therefore I could serve it (together with fruits with thick peels) to some young brahmin p??ha??l? students who had the courage to enter my house.
I am not convinced that this is a good argument. Of course society depends on the services of more than the few percent of the populace with brahmin status, who traditionally did not perform certain kinds of labour.
We also seem to have a logical misunderstanding. I do not wish to say 'the brahminical label is always good, is the only good, and should be put on anything that is good'. What I wish to say is (using the language of set theory): 'what is vaidika / brahminical' is a subset of 'what is good'.
Agreed (cf. my previous statement). But then why is there this proliferation of 'Vedic' this-and-that-and-the-other? Even if there are modernistic fringe groups (around Sri Aurobindo etc.) that ignore the old rules (Aurobindo indeed wrote on the Vedas, although he was a k?yastha, not a br?hma?a), the association of vaidikatva with br?hma?atva and social prestige seems beyond debate.
