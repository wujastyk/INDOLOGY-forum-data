Have pity on me and remove my doubts,

PS. Being a Pole and a habitual user of an inflected language, I'd tend to
write:
bhinn*ai**?* ...dar?an*ai**?* ...bhinn*ai**?  .*..dar?an*ai**?*
In languages such as Polish (and other Slavic languages) the rules how
word-endings are to be pronounced when in contact with other words (-*air*,
*-air*,  *-ais*, *-air*) do not interfere with the rules of writing.
phonological vs. phonetic
