V?caspatimi?ra, generally understood to favor ?iva, acknowledges that adherents of the P?ta?jalayoga??stram consider Vi??u to be their ??vara. He says, in concluding his comment on ?dividv?nnirm??acittamadhi??h?ya k?ru?y?dbhagav?nparamar?ir?sur?ya jij??sam?n?ya tantra? prov?ca (yogabh??yam to yogas?tram 1.25):
 sa eve?vara ?dividv?nkapilo vi??urna<:> svayambh?riti bh?va?~| sv?yambhuv?n?? tv??vara iti bh?va?~|
James Haughton Woods translates this as: [The reply would be that] this same ??vara, the First Knower, the Self-existent Vishnu [is] Kapila. "But [He is] the ??vara of those descended from the Self-existent." This is the point.
Note that V?caspati frequently refers to adherents of the P?ta?jalayoga??stram as sv?yambhuva? (for example, in ny?yaka?ik?).
