[INDOLOGY] bhakti
One might add that with the ??v?rs (Divyaprabandham) and the ?aiva N?ya?m?rs, there is a strong emphasis on temple worship and of the actual presence of the deity in the temple. The importance of the temple is perhaps the distinguishing innovation of the bhakti worship in the Tamil area that subsequently spread north. The Tamil bhakti poets modeled their behavior after that of the earlier Sangam poets, who would go from the court of one king to another singing poems of praise and receiving gifts. Subsequently, Vishnu and ?iva were identified with kings (the Tamil word for temple is k?yil and means ?king?s house?) and the bhakti poets would go from one temple to another singing the manifestation of Vi??u or ?iva there. The Divyaprabandham says again and again that Tirum?? (Vi??u) is equally in Vaiku??ha, in the particular temple the poet is visiting or singing about, and the heart of the devotee. Most of the major temples described 1500 years ago are still there, and in Sangam literature itself, almost 2000 years ago, we find some temples to Murugan (Pa?a?i, Tiruccent?r) that are still extremely popular. We have bhakti poems in Sangam literature (the Parip??al, Tirumuruk???uppa?ai) probably centuries earlier than the A?v?rs and N?ya?m?rs, as Palaniappan has pointed out (see his post). George
