[INDOLOGY] The Sun as the "21st"
Dear Colleague,
With due respect to Professor Thieme, a different explanation might not be
uncalled for. Perhaps we talked over this sometime adducing information on
publications. Thieme's memory is indelible - a rare combinartion of
scholarship and humility. So I do not like to further extend my replies.
Best wishes
