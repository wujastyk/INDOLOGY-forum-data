[INDOLOGY] Origin of Mah?c?na
I'm an outsider in this discussion, so pardon any naive remarks.  I was
under the impression, though, from something I read somewhere (that
statement wouldn't get past Wikipedia) that C?na in Tantrika texts,
especially the *Mah?c?n?c?ratantra*, referred to what we today call the
Assam-Burma region.  Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Northern Burma
that sort of area.
