Dear Justin,

Maybe it's not interesting for you anymore, but I believe that the only 
correct interpretation is the following:

khacara = 9
?ara = 5
ya?a = ayana = 2 (sun has two courses)
Therefore -- 952 NS

The reason is simple. Scribes of Nepalese manuscripts very often do not 
distinguish between the nasals na and ?a, so you can easily disregard 
this as a minor error due to the mother tongue of the scribe (it is an 
aural error, so to say). On the other hand, it is unlikely for a scribe 
well versed in any form of Nep?l?k?ar? to exchange a ma for a ?a from 
the visual point of view. (I would avoid to use Newari, as it is the 
name of the language, but I know this is our choice for the Cambridge 
Digital Catalogue and not all colleagues agree with us.) Moreover, the 
use of avagraha is sparse in Nepalese manuscripts, and you should read 
the passage as though it would be nep?lavar?e 'yana?arakhacare, i.e. 
ayana?.

Finally, I do not think that it is possible to date manuscripts 
paleographically down to the decade, without having seen a very large 
number of manuscripts and after having been able to identify a 
scriptorium (something which takes a lot of time and effort). Many other
