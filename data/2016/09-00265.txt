Subject: [INDOLOGY] 84 lakhs of living beings
Message-ID: <CANVHsm4266z_Y1HqVCu3q0NFFdDiWdcpuYGJwJ1H6h6NrLtbBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am reading for the moment Tamil commentaries to the *Tirumuruk???uppa?ai*.

One of them reads about the first word of the poem (*ulakam*, "the world"
in bold below):

*ulakam ulaki?ka??u??a e? pattu n??ku ila?cam c?vap?ta?ka??kiya
uyirttokutika?.*
*"**ulakam *(means) the group of living beings which are the 84 lakhs of
classes of living beings which are in the world."

Another comments as follows upon the first two words of the poem (*ulakam
uvappa*, "while/so that the world rejoices" in bold below):

*ulaka muvappa** e?patu l?kal?ka?ka?um e?pattu n?lu le?cam ???um?kka?u?
canto[vi]ttaiy a?aintu pi?aikkum pa?i. *Which I tentatively translate as:

"The phrase *ulaka muvappa* (means) the manner in which (in) the worlds (
*l?kal?ka?ka?um*) the eighty four lakhs of kinds (*???u* < *??u*, litteraly
?way?) of people obtain salvation after obtaining knowledge (*vittai* =
*vidy?*) of the poem (*cant?* < *chandas*, ?sacred hymn; metre?)."


The mention of the 84 lakhs of living beings appears to be just a way to
state, as the other commentaries do, that all living beings rejoice.


I have found references to this number of 84 lakhs in the Maitr?ya??ya
Upani?ad (see van Buitenen, 1962, p. 102 and 129) as well as in the
R?m?ya?a of Tulsidas, the Caitanyacarit?m?ta and in a 1499 CE inscription
from Gujarat.


Could any one point out to me other sources (P?r??as for instance) and,
especially, sources where the this total of 84 lakhs is detailed?


With a great many thanks in advance.
