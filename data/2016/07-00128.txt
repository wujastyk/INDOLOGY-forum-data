Dear Madhav,

Can you downgrade?  This sounds like a problem with Office 360. Complex characters work fine in Word 2011 w/ El Capitan.

Generally speaking, unicode, Word, and Apple always have had a very rocky relationship (my understanding is that it's mainly the fault of Microsoft and, with just about every major update, there is some new problem).  I always delay upgrading Word and, when I do, I always retain the older working version for quite some time afterward just in case (I never updated to 360 because nightmare stories about garbled documents appeared rather quickly after the release).

Best,

Steven

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari on Mac

Another happy discovery yesterday was that OpenOffice for Mac is able to display characters with multiple markings like ???, ???, ???, r???? etc.  So, if one is writing something that needs characters with such multiple markings on Mac, it is possible to do a document in OpenOffice and save it as a pdf to preserve these character-markings.  I hope someday MS Word for Mac will be able to do that.  At least, for now, we can happily do Unicode Devanagari on MS Word for Mac.

Hello Hans,

     Evidently the ABC Extended Keyboard on El Kapitan operating system is the same as the US Extended Keyboard on Maverick and older operating systems, with just a different name.

Have you tried the US Extended keyboard, Madhav?

I use Times New Roman, which works very well with unicode

Hans,

     Just tested your suggestions with ABC Extended keyboard layout, and this does work in TextEdit and in Gmail, but not in MS Word.  I tried to copy and paste from EextEdit into Word, and the Word was not able to show the stacking of three diacritics like ???.  Glad to know that such combinations are possible at least on some platforms.  Thanks, Hans, for solving one of my long-standing problems.  With best wishes,

Madhav

Hello Hans,

     Which keyboard-layout are you using to produce these characters?

Dear Madhav,

Though there may be some limitations on stacking, it is possible to produce the following symbol on the Mac (still system 10.9.5): ???. The first diacritic (the macron) is accessed by typing option a + a; the other two diacritics by entering shift-option n and shift-option e AFTER having typed assembled the basic ? character. This post-character shift-option input procedure doesn?t seem to be well advertised; I more or less stumbled upon it in some university?s instructions for its faculty.

There is one concern, however: While ? and the like is treated as a single glyph in unicode and thus transfers well between unicode-compatible platforms, more complex character, such as ??, ??, or ???, are not single glyphs and may therefore not transfer across platforms. We ran into this problem in producing the documents from which the new South Asia volume in the series World of Linguistics have been printed, and the only thing that we could do was submit a pdf-version indicating the desired character shape.

I hope this helps.

Cheers,

Hans

This is a question as to how to get multiple markings on the same vowel sign.  In my pre-Unicode diacritics font Manjushree-CSX, I had included, for instance, the sign for vowel "a" with three markings, length, nasality and accent.  This is necessary to represent P??inian procedures accurately. P??ini deals with eighteen varieties of "a, i, u, ?" etc. differing in length, accent and nasality. Is there a way to do this with unicode fonts and keyboards?

The ABC Extended keyboard on the Mac is good for all diacritical marks.  Combining the option key with a gives the macron: ?, ?, etc.  Option + x = underdot: ?, ?, etc.  Option + w = overdot: ?.  Option + e = accent mark: ?.  Tilde is of course option + n: ?.

This is not the worst thing in the world, but slower than the old Easy Unicode or Dev Unicode keyboards.

Dear Indologists,

     To my happy surprise, I found that with the combination of the latest version of Microsoft Office 360 for Mac and the latest Mac Operating System OS X El Capitan, it is now possible to directly enter Unicode Devanagari in a Word document with the Devanagari - QWERTY keyboard layout.  Previously, I had to enter Unicode Devanagari in something like TextEdit and then copy and paste into a Word document, but was not able to edit it in the Word document.  The new development of software has happily changed that situation.  Hope this information will be of use to some of you.  Best,
