V?caspatimi?ra I lived later than the eighth century. He can be dated to
around 950 CE (see Diwakar Acharya, *V?caspatimi?ra*?*s Tattvasam?k??**,

The ?vet??vatara Upani?ad is by no means one of the earliest Upani?ads.
Thomas Oberlies dated it to a period between the beginning of the common
era and 200 CE, and, in any case, after the Bhagavadg?t?. (Oberlies,

K?lid?sa, who can be approximately dated to 400-450 CE according to Ingalls
(see Ingalls,Daniel H. H. ?K?lid?sa and the Attitudes of the Golden Age?.

<http://www.jstor.org/stable/599886?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents>, p. 15,
n. 1), is clearly later than the Bhagavadg?t? and the ?vet??vatara
Upani?ad. He is also slightly later than the P?ta?jalayoga??stra, i.e. the
Yoga Sutra together with the so-called Yogabh??ya which can be dated to the
end of the fifth c. (see Maas, Philipp Andr?. *Sam?dhip?da. Das erste
Kapitel des P?ta?jalayoga??stra zum ersten Mal kritisch ediert, = The First
Chapter of the P?ta?jalayoga??stra for the First Time Critically Edited.*

of scholarship on yoga philosophy and for arguments concerning the unitary
nature of the *P?ta?jalayoga??stra*, you may find also my article ?A

relavant.
The question of the religious orientation of Pata?jali is difficult to
answer. It appears to me that Pata?jali consciously created a work on
spiritual liberation in a Brahmanical religious setting that avoided any
obvious sectarian commitment in order to make his work widely acceptable.
However, the reference to Kapila as the first teacher of yoga in PY? 1.25
(to which Eliot Stern referred in his mail to the present discussion) may
actually indicate that Pata?jali had a Vai??ava background. An additional
indication for the same may be the fact that Pata?jali quoted Vi??upur??a
6.6.2 in order to support his exposition of Mantrameditation leading to an
awareness of *??vara* in PY? 1.28.
