Dear Friends,
I've just uploaded a new and longer version of Episode 3: Jalam ? Chillum.
This is part of the documentary series I am making, which is titled: *Imagining
Sanskrit Land*. These short 5-10 minute films present different aspects of
quotidian life in the 'Sanskrit speaking' village Jhiri, which is located
in Madhya Pradesh, India.
In this episode I wanted to highlight how much effort goes into acquiring
water in a village where running water, or water straight out of the tap in
the house does not exist in any of the 90 dwellings in the village. The
majority of this burden of fetching water falls upon the women and young
girls. In India, many children miss out on an education due to this
responsibility. Some die climbing into wells or, due to heat exhaustion,
they die on the way home when the temperature reaches around 40-50c in the
shade. Thankfully, no one died in the making of this film.
