Subject: [INDOLOGY] Double sandhi
Message-ID: <c7e09d2c-adae-257e-e391-e87b0ec18569@pbhome.se>

I seem to recall having read a discussion on instances of irregular, 
double sandhi (as in, say, /vartate idam > vartata idam > vartatedam/) 
on the Indology list, but I can't find it in the list archives. If 
anyone could point me either to the old posts (assuming that they exist 
outside my imagination) or to some useful discussion of the phenomenon 
(does it occur and, if so, where; how is it regarded, etc), I should be 
most grateful.
