[INDOLOGY] Two Articles by Suresh Chandra Banerji
Dear List,
I'm looking for two short articles that are not available in my library:
Banerji, Suresh Chandra. "Minor Smrti Writers of Bengal, " *Indian
Historical Quarterly* 33, 1957, 191-200.
Banerji, Suresh Chandra. "Post-Raghunandana Smrti Writers of Bengal," *New
Indian Antiquary*, Vol. 7, 1944/45, 105-110.
If someone is able and willing to share a scan of either or both of these
articles, it would be very much appreciated.
Best,
Sam
