=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_two_artha=C5=9B=C4=81stra_sources?=
Dear Arlo,
I believe those references are to the Artha??stra commentaries Jayama?gal? and C??akya??k?. The C?k?u??ya is supposed to be an independent work.
I have since found the following entry in Singh?s Bibliography of Kautiliya Arthasastra:
459. Ramakrishna, Kavi, M. "Caksusiya." Journal of Sri Venkatesvara Oriental Institute, Vol. 4, Part 1, 1943, pp. 123-128, Vol. 6, Part 2, pp. 33-53.
460. Ramakrishna, Kavi, M. " Chakshushiya: an ancient work on Arthasastra." Annals of Sri Venkatesvara Oriental Institute, Vol. 1, part 4, 1940, pp. 79-89.
Does anyone know where these might be available online?
All best,
Mark

Dear Mark,
Could the second item be the one whose accurate bibliography is elaborately stated in n. 49 of von Hin?ber's 2005 article on bh?micchidrany?ya <http://www.jstor.org/stable/43382108<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.jstor.org_stable_43382108&d=CwMF_w&c=yHlS04HhBraes5BQ9ueu5zKhE7rtNXt_d012z2PA6ws&r=0VMy4AVIL7ZKIaC4sH1Pm49PWgKJk0KFb86IpzVGC5E&m=NNmM5LkoQZ2u-iubFrAi6y-J9gCAZzg-hP1VasMcmBw&s=7l0EE4Ma2FHT1PbQYkraYLyyc1ovF3C0u3eS5liGHBs&e=>>?

[INDOLOGY] two artha??stra sources
Dear friends,
I?m having trouble locating two sources on artha??stra, and I hoped someone on the list might be able to help me. I give here the bibliographic information as I have it.
1. Ruben, W. 1929. Study in the Artha??stra. Dharwar. (This is cited in Sternbach?s Bibliography of Kau?ilya Artha??stra, which has a number of errors, as well as, at least, Botto?s article on dvaidh?bh?va in India Maior). Worldcat has the following, but I couldn?t get it from the British Library to see if it is the same:

2. Kavi, Ramakrishna. [title unknown: multiple articles on and text of the C?k?u??ya Artha??stra]. Journal of the Venkatesvara Oriental Institute. 1:79-89; 3:99-116; 4:123-128; 4:129-140; 6:129-140(?). This comes from Kane I p. 152ff.
With thanks in advance for any help hunting down any of these.
All best,
Mark
