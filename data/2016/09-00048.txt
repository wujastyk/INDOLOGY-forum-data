[INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks
The only reason why someone who has taken the trouble of learning the
languages would dispense with a lossless transliteration schema is fear
that the "general reader" will be frightened, or put off, by diacritical
marks. Now for a doctoral dissertation, I think it's probably more
important to show that one knows, e.g., the difference between ??stra and
?astra, or r?ma and ram?, than to placate this mythical "general reader."
Speaking for myself, I think using diacritical marks is the optimal balance
between addressing the needs of a readership that doesn't necessarily know
the script but might nevertheless be interested in what the words
"actually" are. I know, e.g., that Chinese scholars often dispense with
marking tones in their transliterations, and specialist readers know what
the tones are, but this makes it hard for me to look up words in a
dictionary. Similarly with non-scholarly transcriptions of Tibetan, Arabic,
and so on. As a non-specialist in those languages, I would much prefer a
lossless transliteration. It only takes about fifteen minutes on Wikipedia
to familiarize yourself with a transliteration scheme anyway. Of course, I
can't speak for the "general reader" who probably exists only in the board
rooms of publishing firms, but I'd imagine that at the worst this person is
indifferent to diacritics, whereas people like me are positively put off by
the lack of diacritics.
I consider the use of diacritics on a par, in terms of scholarly
discipline, with proper references: just like saying "according to scholars
of the 1890s" doesn't allow interested readers to follow up and raises
doubts (at least in my mind) about whether the author is writing from
first-hand knowledge, writing without diacritics makes it difficult for
non-specialist interested readers to follow up, or to know how it's
pronounced, and makes specialist readers more skeptical of the author's
first-hand knowledge of the language.
