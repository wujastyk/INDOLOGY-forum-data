[INDOLOGY] Ludo Rocher
Dear Friends:
I just received the news from Rosane Rocher, that our teacher and friend, Ludo Rocher, passed away last night peacefully. I am sure we will have a more detailed tribute to him, but he was not just a great scholar but a humble and loving teacher and friend. 
With best wishes,
Patrick Olivelle
