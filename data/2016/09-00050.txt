[INDOLOGY] Question on Diacritical Marks
I remember the first few yoga books I picked up years ago only had the
???????? and a translation. It forced me to teach myself how to read and
write the script. Perhaps, if those first few books had a transliteration I
would never have bothered?
All the best,
