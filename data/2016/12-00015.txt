Dear Harry,

This is an interesting question; some of the variations in spelling date
all the way back to attempts at standardizing the language that came about
in the last decades of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th.
Some of the greatest philologists of the Hindi tradition, such as
Hazariprasad Dvivedi, weighed in on aspects of spelling. Grammar manuals
from different periods and by different authors offer varying rules in this
regard (and do not follow any type of regional distinctions, as far as I
know). It would be interesting to find out whether anyone has actually done
a historical study of these rules and their development.

All best,
Tyler
