[INDOLOGY] Two etymologies
This meaning ?live in distress? suits the character well, because it is his
distress resulting from the curse of paushya ( to be childless) and his
distress of his guru asking him why he took such a long time to return and
the resulting frustration of him leading to the sarpayaaga.
