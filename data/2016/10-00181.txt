[INDOLOGY] Touching one's nose with the left index finger
Dear colleagues,
I hope someone might have insight (or better yet a textual reference) for a
cultural convention.
In Vi?van?tha Cakravartin's commentary (ca. late 17th century) on the
Bh?gavata Pur??a 10.9.7 (utt?rya gop?...), where Ya?od? finds the curd-pot
that K???a had broken, he adds a comment that she touched the tip of her
nose with her left index finger (v?matarjjany? n?s?gra? sp???veti j?eyam).
Can anyone identify the significance of this? Does it indicate
exasperation? Surprise?
Thanks,
David
