[INDOLOGY] Symbology of Om
For whatever its worth ? here?s a picture of the rendition of OM at the top of a temple in Tamilnadu, South India.
Notice that the symbol for M is contained within the symbol for O.
You can find many interesting renditions in Tamilnadu temples. There?s also the belief that the twist of the trunk of gane?a represents the symbol OM.
