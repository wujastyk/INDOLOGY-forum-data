For whatever its worth ? here?s a picture of the rendition of OM at the top of a temple in Tamilnadu, South India.




Notice that the symbol for M is contained within the symbol for O.

You can find many interesting renditions in Tamilnadu temples. There?s also the belief that the twist of the trunk of gane?a represents the symbol OM.

Regards,
rajam

Having studied the early development of OM in Vedic texts and rituals, I am curious to know about the syllable?s further development in epigraphy, manuscripts, and iconography in India and beyond. (Admittedly a broad question!) Apart from one or two articles (for instance Boeles 1947 ?The Migration of the Mystic Syllable O?.? India Antiqua, J.P. Voegel festschrift, pp. 40-56. Leiden: Brill), there seem to be very few publications on these aspects of the syllable?s history, and so the images, citations and other suggestions forwarded by colleagues thus far are very valuable. Please do keep sending along information as it occurs to you.

The candra and the ?ikh?, suggesting, I suppose, Mantram?rga influence, are both clearly visible.
