[INDOLOGY] PDF request
Dear indologists,
I'm looking for a PDF copy of 
Sharma, M.M. 1978. Inscriptions of Ancient Assam. Guwahati: Dept. Publications Guwahati University.
And of the follow parts of book:
Hudson, D.D. 2002. "Self Sacrifice as Truth in India." 
Harlan, L. 2002. "Truth and Sacrifice. Sati Immolations in India."
Both should be part of
M. Cormack, Sacrificing the self: perspectives on martyrdom and religion. New York: OUP.
Best,
Paolo
