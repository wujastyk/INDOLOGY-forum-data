Dear Alessandro,

I believe I was shown the same by Terry Tan in Yangon in 2014. It is without any doubt a forgery. (And there are many forged 'Pyu' artefacts around.) I have the impression that some copy of ye dhamm? verse has served as vague model for the face with 6 lines.

Best,

Dear Members,
I am posting this query to help a private collector. This golden medallion comes from Pyu (ancient Burma). Is anyone able to provide some insights on the two scripts involved? Unfortunately, I am not able to give more infos, but the Buddhist theme of the engraving is rather certain. Herewith the link to the images. Thank you!
