[INDOLOGY] Entering Unicode devanagari on the Mac
Dear Harry,
     The latest version of Microsoft Word for Mac (15.29.1) allows direct
typing of Unicode Devanagari using the Devanagari - QWERTY keyboard without
any special effort.  I have been using this version for the past several
months, since it came out.
