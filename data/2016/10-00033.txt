[INDOLOGY] Indologist at Center of Sexual Harassment Mess at Berkeley
Everything shared on this thread has been reported in the mainstream media,
not tabloids.
I think that Indologists should be interested in the Blake Wentworth sexual
harassment scandal, not because it's sensational, but because sexual
harassment is a serious problem in our discipline and the academy more
widely. It's a hard truth, but a reality that affects many of us,
especially women.
