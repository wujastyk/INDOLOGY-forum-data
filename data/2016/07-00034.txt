Subject: [INDOLOGY] Two etymologies

For a layperson like me, the terms Utta?ka and Tak?aka seem to refer to two polar entities (north and south). 

These terms seem to find a place in Tamil literature as ?uttara? and ?takshi?a.? 

The term ?taccar? appears in Old Tamil referring to Greek carpenters, specifically Ionia (?yava?a-t-taccar?).

This meaning is indicated in RV.1.32.2 tatak?a. Here the etymological meaning stands.
