[INDOLOGY] Two etymologies
For a layperson like me, the terms Utta?ka and Tak?aka seem to refer to two polar entities (north and south). 
These terms seem to find a place in Tamil literature as ?uttara? and ?takshi?a.? 
The term ?taccar? appears in Old Tamil referring to Greek carpenters, specifically Ionia (?yava?a-t-taccar?).
