Subject: [INDOLOGY] Wooden archetypes of Buddhist cave temples?
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4+=00A2_8DHiM=Mv-YV1iDL4PSD1uU9fvgX4maio5+eQw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

About 4 years ago I ran across an online article by a Japanese architect
(not Indologist) containing the claim that it was unlikely that there were
really wooden archetypes of the Indian Buddhist cave temples such as Karla.
As I recall, part of the argument concerned bent wooden beams, and the
impracticality of bending such large wooden beams when it would have been
perfectly easy to build what amounts to an "A-frame" and, if you wanted an
curved ceiling, suspending it. Anyway, this is my very imperfect memory,
but I can't find anything on my HD about this, and I can't, in a google
search, find any discussion like this.
Does this seem familiar to anyone? Has any architect actually discussed the
feasibility of wooden construction in the fashion that we encounter in the
caves?

thanks very much!

jonathan
