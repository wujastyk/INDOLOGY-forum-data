Thanks for clarification. You are right, the identification of Sin (Sinim) is clearly inconclusive and one should not exclude that it could mean China since rather early times. Some (and of course outdated) references are in Brown-Driver-Briggs sub Sinim:
http://biblehub.com/hebrew/5515.htm

For our Indological context, one reference is interesting: T. de Lacouperie "who thinks of ?ina, at foot of Hindu Kush, but unlikely".

Klein's Etymological Dictionary (????, p. 444) says: "China (a hapax legomenon in the Bible occurring Is 49:12... The Sinim are identified by many scholars with
the Chinese, cp. Ptolemaic Gk. sinai (= the Chinese)."

It would be important to know since when this identification with Chine/Chinese is indisputably attested in Hebrew, Arabic and Persian sources.

Best,
LO
