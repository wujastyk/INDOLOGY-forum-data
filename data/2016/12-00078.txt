[INDOLOGY] Does chandrabindu occur in Hindi
Dear Harry,
There are a couple of ways of doing the transliteration. The challenge is
that, in both precolonial manuscripts and in print editions, a single bindu
(without the candra) can denote both a nasalized vowel sound, OR a nasal
consonant that is the first member of a consonant conjunct. For example,
??? can represent both ??? and ????. (If the Devanagari doesn't come
through: a?t (where ? is a single bindu) can represent both a?t (where ? is
true vowel nasalization) and ant (where n is the dental nasal in a conjunct
with t).
Consequently, transliteration schemes diverge. Some scholars (myself
included) prefer ? for the 'ambiguous' bindu, ? for the proper candrabindu
(vowel nasalization), and the appropriate nasal consonant (?, ?, ?, n, m)
for, well, the nasal consonant. But there is another way that is also quite
popular (and perhaps more elegant): it is to place the tilde over the
nasalized vowel. This is certainly a simpler solution. But when dealing
with pre-modern texts, it can sometimes obscure aspects of the originals,
and make automatic scansion more difficult. (Because pre-modern poets often
used the ambiguity of vowel nasalization/nasal consonants to play with
meter.)
Best,
Tyler
