Dear David,

My general experience is that copyists in the Sanskrit/Indic tradition are very conservative. Almost always, they do not make emendations and, if they do, they usually note them in the margins. Secondly, your mss do not seem to fall into versions or recensions. In effect, you have only one ms reading aja. Also, you have indicated that the source of the (seemingly) multiple attestations is unlikely to have been distant from the autograph or a copy that was made available for further copying. There is thus room to believe that an oversight made in the autograph or in a released copy of the autograph has been faithfully retained. Therefore, unless another independent occurrence of aja in the sense of ajaya is found, the emendation that occurred to Madhav and you should be accepted. Just as wems do not accept in a critically constituted text grammatically wrong forms obviously incongruent with the rest of an author?s/scribe?s style or standard, we should not accept a word for which no external corroboration is available, especially if the meaning of that word (?unborn? in this case) is unlikely to be confused or associated with a meaning several of us have viewed as contextually likely and the expresser of that meaning gives us a metrically sound text. 

I hope I make sense even if I fail to create conviction. 

a.a.

I recall an early Vedic scholar (I have forgotten who) writing that the very fact that an emendation is obvious is good reason not to make the emendation, because it would have also been obvious to the whole line of Sanskrit pandits who transmitted the text, yet who did not make the emendation. We seem to have the same situation here. I originally did not make the obvious emendation because all eight Sanskrit manuscripts unanimously agreed in having aja here. Then came confirmation of this by the occurrence of aja in the prose commentary on 1.27, three times. Then two more old palm-leaf Sanskrit manuscripts became available to me, also having aja. Most recently, Tsa mi?s early Tibetan translation became available, having the transliterated aja. Not a single source has ajaya. So I am obliged to conclude that aja is the actual form of the name.

There was no time for a corruption to occur in the transmission of the text and then become established in the tradition. The early translators all lived within the first few generations after the K?lacakra texts appeared in India. Two of the palm-leaf Sanskrit manuscripts we have are old enough to have been brought to Tibet, presumably by the early translators. The question, then, is whether the ajaya meaning for aja is a mistake, like the abja meaning most likely is, or whether the name aja was actually understood in the meaning of ajaya.

No evidence has so far surfaced that aja ever had the ajaya meaning in a Prakrit or vernacular, presumably of northeast India. The evidence of the early translators is inconsistent, some taking aja in the meaning of ajaya, and some not. Soman?tha, working with the Tibetan translator 'Bro, apparently did (we have only the later revision of his translation by Shong ston), while Tsa mi did not. Yet both are reported to have been co-disciples of the same K?lacakra teacher, and they lived only a few generations after the texts appeared in India. So who do we trust? It seems to me that we need more evidence to decide this question.

It has only seven syllables, in stead of the required eight syllables for a quarter of an Anu??ubh verse.  To make this line metrically regular with eight syllables, the probable correction would read: samudravijayo 'jaya?", giving you the reading "ajaya".  This original was probably corrupted to "samudravijayo 'ja?".  Just a suggestion.

Whether abja rather than aja was found in Bhadrabodhi?s Sanskrit manuscript, however, is another question. In this pioneering translation, the Tibetan translator Gyi jo first made a draft translation, and then this was divided among his students, the junior translators, to complete (see Cyrus Stearns, The Buddha from D?lpo, 2010 ed., p. 327 note 98). Since this possibly tentative translation, chu skyes, is the only evidence we have for abja, against much other evidence, I must doubt whether abja was actually in the Sanskrit manuscript. It seems more likely that the Tibetan translator simply confused the two words, and mistook the meaning of abja for the meaning of aja.

The Tibetan p?da is short one syllable, which is obviously needed after nyi ma'i, but was apparently omitted by scribal error. So the Tibetan translator did take this name as something pertaining to the sun, whether he read it as jaya or as aja. As for what the word missing in this Tibetan translation might be, ?[something] of the sun?: V. S. Apte?s Sanskrit dictionary gives as meaning #9 ?A vehicle of the sun,? and Monier-Williams gives ?beam of the sun (P?shan),? but neither with a source reference.

> Getting the names of the kings of ?ambhala correct is very important for the Jonang order of Tibetan Buddhism, which has specialized in the K?lacakra/?ambhala teachings. So the Jonangpa lama Khentrul Rinpoche asked me if I could check with other Sanskritists to confirm that the name aja cannot mean ?inconquerable? or ?unconquered? in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit grammar. Since the many learned Sanskritists on this list have not responded with a way to derive this meaning in the three days since the question was posted, I take this as confirmed. This is a difficult problem, because a thousand years ago two different Indian Sanskrit pandits, working with two different Tibetan translators, apparently did take aja in this meaning. Unlike with the name harivikrama, we cannot trace how the error with aja arose (if it is an error).
>

Sanskrit verses had to be translated into Tibetan verses with a fixed number of syllables, seven for a p?da in the ?loka or anu??ubh meter. So the eight syllables of this anu??ubh p?da were translated into these seven Tibetan syllables: dpal skyong seng ge rnam par gnon. Because the number of Tibetan syllables was limited by the meter, the syllables giving necessary grammatical information were omitted, leaving no way to know where the names divide. At some point, annotations were added, dividing this p?da into three names rather than two. So the Tibetan tradition got two kings, hari and vikrama, for one, harivikrama. All eight Sanskrit manuscripts that I used 31 years ago have harivikrama? (not harir vikrama?), as do the two that have become available to me since then. These ten include six old palm-leaf manuscripts, two of which had been used in Tibet, as seen by the Tibetan handwriting on their opening leaves.

This name occurs again in prose in the Vimalaprabh? commentary on 1.27, three times, so the form aja is there confirmed. Yet the canonical Tibetan translation by the Indian pandit Soman?tha and the Tibetan translator 'Bro Shes rab grags, revised by Shong ston, has rgyal dka'. Similarly, the Tibetan translation by the Indian pandit Samanta?r? and the Tibetan translator Rwa Chos rab has ma pham pa, as reported by Bu ston in his annotated edition of the Vimalaprabh?. Both mean ?unconquerable? or ?unconquered.? Here we do not have an error that is traceable to the transmission process, as we do with harivikrama, but rather a discrepancy in the translation itself.

The translation by Tsa mi Sangs rgyas grags, said to be the only Tibetan ever to become abbot of N?land? university in India, has transliterated the name into Tibetan characters (a dza) rather than translated it. The first ever Tibetan translation, by the Indian pandit Bhadrabodhi and the Tibetan translator Gyi jo Zla ba'i 'od zer and his students, has the incomprehensible nyi ma'i, ?of the sun,? at the end of the p?da in the list of kings (probably a scribal error in the one manuscript we have), and chu skyes, ?water-born,? in the three occurrences in the commentary on 1.27. A third translation, of which we have only the first chapter (so we do not know who made it), has rgyal ba, ?conqueror,? in the list of kings (probably a scribal error for rgyal dka' in the one manuscript we have), and rgyal dka', ?unconquerable,? in the three occurrences at 1.27.

If we reject Gyi jo?s chu skyes, ?water-born,? as an erroneous translation, a simple mistake, we are left with figuring out how three translators took aja as ?unconquerable? or ?unconquered.? Is this, too, just an erroneous translation? Significantly, Tsa mi did not translate the name but only transliterated it. This indicates that he did not take it as ?unconquerable? or ?unconquered,? but neither did he take it as ?unborn,? as we might have expected. My apologies for the long post, but this is important to me and to Khentrul Rinpoche, and I wanted to provide enough background information to possibly lead to a solution to this problem.

As the name of a bodhisattva king I have not taken aja in its meaning ?goat,? but rather in its meaning ?unborn.? However, two different pairs of early translators have translated it into Tibetan as ?unconquerable? or ?unconquered? (rgyal dka?, ma pham pa), as if the word was ajaya (or ajita) rather than aja. This, of course, is a more appropriate meaning for the name of a king; but the form aja is unanimously confirmed in multiple witnesses and also in a different location in the Vimalaprabh?. So the question is: Is there any way to derive aja from the root ji, ?to conquer,? rather than from the root jan, ?to be born,? in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit grammar, whether the A???dhy?y? of P??ini, the C?ndra-vy?kara?a, the K?tantra, the S?rasvata-vy?kara?a, or any other Sanskrit grammar?
