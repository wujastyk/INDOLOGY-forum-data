[INDOLOGY] aja as ajaya?
Dear David,
My general experience is that copyists in the Sanskrit/Indic tradition are very conservative. Almost always, they do not make emendations and, if they do, they usually note them in the margins. Secondly, your mss do not seem to fall into versions or recensions. In effect, you have only one ms reading aja. Also, you have indicated that the source of the (seemingly) multiple attestations is unlikely to have been distant from the autograph or a copy that was made available for further copying. There is thus room to believe that an oversight made in the autograph or in a released copy of the autograph has been faithfully retained. Therefore, unless another independent occurrence of aja in the sense of ajaya is found, the emendation that occurred to Madhav and you should be accepted. Just as wems do not accept in a critically constituted text grammatically wrong forms obviously incongruent with the rest of an author?s/scribe?s style or standard, we should not accept a word for which no external corroboration is available, especially if the meaning of that word (?unborn? in this case) is unlikely to be confused or associated with a meaning several of us have viewed as contextually likely and the expresser of that meaning gives us a metrically sound text. 
I hope I make sense even if I fail to create conviction. 
a.a.
