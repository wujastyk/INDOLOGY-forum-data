Subject: [INDOLOGY] Online krama and ghana mode recitations of Krsna	Yajurveda
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQG7rFdADr2YZVqHf+P3grgNrHHDC6wxXNSPKcap6Y=BQg@mail.gmail.com>

In case this is of interest to other list members, I came across this
website of the Arunachala Sadhana Trust with online audios of krama and
ghana recitations of the Krsna Yajurveda including complete krama and ghana
recitations of the rudram. Many other recitations there.
