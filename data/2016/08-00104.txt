Yes, Ashok, clearly sv?min refers to Skanda, with or without ?tilaka?. That much is clear also from V?caspati?s verse that Tim Lubin cited. The issue is why ?tilaka? is compounded with it and, with Tim?s other sources with different compounds: tilake?vara, etc, it is clear that this is a compound. But what is the meaning of tilaka in these contexts?

? clearly the Vulgate and Vij??ne?vara are wrong in their reading here.

If Vij??ne?vara uses ?dityaskandaga?apat?n?m, he must have seen a source for skanda in the verse and he must have seen the source between ?ditya and ga?apati. Either he was undecided about the reading and tried to accommodate both the readings you discuss or he thought of sv?min as standing, by itself,  for skanda.

a.a.
