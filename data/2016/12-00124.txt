Message-ID: <7ED7162D-748F-4B1F-91B4-A2B3F097DA5A@gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Please note the two following calls for applications for Postdoctoral Fellowships in Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley for 2017-2019.


1) UC Berkeley Shinjo Ito Postdoctoral Fellowship in Buddhist Studies 2017-2019, which is posted online at http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/fellowship/ <http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/fellowship/>

With the generous support of the Shinnyo-en Foundation, the Program in Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley is pleased to invite applications for a two-year full-time postdoctoral research-teaching fellowship. The term of the appointment is July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2019.

The Fellowship is intended to foster the academic careers of recent Ph.D.'s, providing time to pursue their research along with the opportunity to gain teaching experience. Fellows are expected to teach one course per year in the lecturer title under the auspices of the Group in Buddhist Studies. In addition, Fellows will give a public lecture on their research as part of the Center for Buddhist Studies Colloquium Series, and they are expected to take part in regular Center for Buddhist Studies events and workshops. We particularly welcome applicants whose research and teaching interests complement areas covered by Berkeley's Buddhist Studies faculty. Fellows will be provided with office space, library privileges, a salary of approximately $50,000 per annum, based on experience level, benefits, and $2,500 per annum in research/travel funds.

Applicants whose teaching and research interests are primarily in the area of Japanese Buddhism should apply to the Shinjo Ito Postdoctoral Fellowship <http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cjs/funding_postdocs.html> in Japanese Buddhism, administered through the Center for Japanese Studies <http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cjs/> at UC Berkeley, rather than to the Shinjo Ito Fellowship in Buddhist Studies.

Applicants whose teaching and research interests are primarily in the area of Chinese Buddhism should apply to the Sheng Yen Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chinese Buddhism <http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/shengyen/>, also administered through the Center for Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley, rather than to the Shinjo Ito Fellowship in Buddhist Studies.

Applicants must have their PhD or equivalent degree in hand by their start date. At the time of application, the basic minimum qualification is the completion of all degree requirements other than the dissertation, in Buddhist Studies or a closely related field.

Additional Required Qualifications:

Candidates may have no more than three years of post-PhD research experience prior to the appointment start date.
A certified copy of the Ph.D. certificate is required before the appointment can go into effect.
Preferred Qualifications:

University-level teaching experience in a relevant field.
Applicants should submit the following materials:

Curriculum vitae, listing degrees, any publications, and teaching experience

A writing sample
A two- to four-page statement of teaching interests, along with two brief course proposals (with optional syllabi) of courses they propose to teach for the Group in Buddhist Studies (Note: UC Berkeley courses normally meet a total of three or four hours per week throughout a fourteen-week semester)
Candidates who do not yet hold a Ph.D. but expect to by June 30, 2017, should supply a letter from their home institution confirming their schedule to completion.
Applicants should request three letters of recommendation.
Application Deadline and Notification of Award
