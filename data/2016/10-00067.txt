[INDOLOGY] To post or not to post
Dear list members,
I too thought I would keep quite. As a moral philosopher who deals with 
these kinds of issues, I have too much to say so I thought to say 
nothing. But I have been amazed that this thread has continued in part 
due to all the objections to the original post (which probably would 
have peacefully receded into the background had it not hit a nerve). I 
have been struck by the following:
(1) How relevant one believes sexual harassment is to Indology has to do 
with how worried one is about encountering this in one's research as an 
Indologist. The issue is not merely about whether one is male or female, 
but also about whether one is senior or junior. As our junior colleagues 
are the most vulnerable and least likely to have a voice in print and 
the scholarly community, we ought to think twice before we silence their 
concerns, as many on this list of tried.
(2) The second issue is about trial by press. There are several concerns 
here. One is the stigma attached to the victims and 
complainants---reporting sexual harassment is often described by such 
individuals as a second assault. Then there is the very real and 
credible concern that people's reputations can be damaged by false 
accusations. I take the latter possibility seriously. Berkeley seems to 
be on a role with handling sexual harassment badly, alternating between 
suppressing the issue and then publicly misrepresenting facts of cases.  
The only solution to both problems, it seems to me, is to be willing to 
talk about the issue, for if we treat the very mention of sexual 
harassment as inappropriate for public discussion in scholarly settings, 
we do nothing to deflate the stigma of reporting such cases, or the 
stigma of being falsely accused.
