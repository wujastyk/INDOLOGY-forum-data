[INDOLOGY] Sumangala-vilasini - a request from Warsaw
Dear Colleagues,
I need, urgently, to consult the Buddhaghosa's commentary on the
Mahaparinibbana-sutta
Has someone, by any lucky chance, a pdf copy of this portion of the Sv?
[The first part of the Sv is freely available (pdf format), but not the
next two parts.
Archive.org has the title, but when it comes to download, what is given is
not the pdf of the Sv, but the pdf of "Four New York Boys".]
My sincere thanks in advance,
Artur Karp
Poland
