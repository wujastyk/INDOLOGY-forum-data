[INDOLOGY] Sunrise in the West & twelve dandas
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
Prof. Barbara Grabowska of the South Asian Studies Deptt (University of
Warsaw) asks me to ask you about the meaning of the phrase "*twelve dandas*
".
The phrase appears in the Rupram Cakravarti's Dharmamangal (XVII c.). The
text says that if the sunrise will take place in the west, the God Dharma
will start to be revered and receive sacrifices on this Earth. The hero of
the Mangal prays for the sunrise to take place in the west at the twelfth
danda. And people, thinking that the night is over, started their home
chores.
With highest regards,
