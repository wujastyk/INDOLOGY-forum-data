[INDOLOGY] Georges Dumezil's Tripartite Ideology text
A propos this topic please permit me to quote from a review I published
long years ago on a volume of the collected papers of John Brough (IIJ 42:
188-196):
Despite the astonishingly broad range of his interests and competence,
Brough was not a comparativist, at least in the sense that that term is
frequently used today. In fact, he rather energetically, and sometimes even
rather sarcastically, critiqued a certain type of comparativism, especially
in his comments on Dumezil?s ideas on the ?Tripartite Ideology of the
IndoEuropeans.? Having, for example, offered an elaborate complex of
evidence which reduces to ashes Dumezil?s claim that the ?Tripartite
Ideology? is exclusively IndoEuropean, and nonBiblical, Brough wrote (p.
199): ?We can, of course, dismiss the whole thing [that is, Brough?s
demonstration of the same patterns in Biblical myth] as a mere burlesque, a
caricature of Professor Dumezil?s methods: though I protest that I have
tried not to caricature, and have done my best to deal with the material in
the same manner as he has dealt with the IndoEuropean material. The reader
is free to judge whether or not my treatment is a burlesque.? Despite the
putative freedom Brough has given his reader, he ends his study with these
words: ?The experiment [carried out in the paper] also suggests that the
IndoEuropean ?tripartite ideology? could be due very largely to bias in the
selection of data combined with ?la nature des choses?. If it does not
prove this with the certainty of a mathematical demonstration, it does at
least prove that, up to the present, no very strong reason has been given
for thinking otherwise.?
