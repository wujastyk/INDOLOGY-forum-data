[INDOLOGY] Chaupar/pachisi pieces carrying linga-like objects
Dear list,
I have come across a beautiful set of 4x4 carved chaupar/pachisi pieces, 
four of which depict a seated woman carrying a linga-like object (see 
the attached photo). I would be grateful for more specific insights into 
what it is that these figures are actually carrying.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
Kind regards,
Jacob
