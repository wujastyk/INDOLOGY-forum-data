[INDOLOGY] EAAA conference Panels' info
Dear Indologists,
Next August 2017 there will be in Zurich the conference organised by
"European Association for Asian Art and Archaeology"
http://www.ea-aaa.eu/conference-2017/eaaa-conference-zurich-2017/zurich-2017-call-for-papers
I'd like to know if anyone has already planned a panel centred on
*shakta-tantra* art or on the methodological approach to the study of a
religious site throughout the interrelation of textual/epigraphic, ritual
(also contemporary praxis) and art evidences.
I would also know if there is some one interested to co-organize a panel.
Unluckily the time is very little, because the deadline for the
panel/abstract proposal is 15th November.
Please feel free to contact me also off-list.
Best,
Paolo
