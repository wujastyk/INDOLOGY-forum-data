[INDOLOGY] PDF of Taittiriya Aranyaka vol. 3 by Mahadeva Sastri and	Rangacharya needed
Dear list members,
If anyone has a pdf of volume 3 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka by Mahadeva
Sastri and Rangacharya could they send it to me.
I know its in the Digital Library of India but I'm unable to download it
with my usual method with BitComet.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
