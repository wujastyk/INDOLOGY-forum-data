Dear Walter,

Thanks for pointing out that "equator" was Haug's translation of 
/vi?uvant/. There has been some confusion regarding the meaning of 
/vi?uvat/ because, as you say, in post-Vedic, especially astronomical 
(/Siddh?nta/) literature it was used to mean the equinoxes or the 
celestial equator. But that is clearly not the case in the AB.

An example of a Siddh?nta using /vi?uvat/ for the equinoxes/celestial 
equator is the /Pa?casiddh?ntik?/ of Var?hamihira, which states that 
(3.23): /me?at?ly?dau vi?uvat/, "/vi?uvat/ is at the beginning of Aries 
and Libra." Those are the equinoxes, the points at which the equator is 
crossed by the ecliptic.

Haug does seem to believe that the AB is referring to the equinoxes 
here, meaning that the /uttar?ya?a/ and the /dak?in?yana/ would go from 
one equinox to the other, instead of from one solstice to the other, 
which is their correct meaning in the AB.

The confusion, or the change of meaning for /vi?uvat/ (-/ant/) surely 
stems from the fact that /vi?uvant/ simply refers to something making a 
division into two. And the year can be divided into two equal halves 
either by the line of the equinoxes or by the line of the solstices.

There is another reason that has to do with the fact that from the 
spring equinox to the fall equinox the sun has a northern declination 
(in astronomical lingo), whereas from the fall equinox to the spring one 
it has a southern declination. But I won't get into that.

I wrote about the /ayanas/ in detail in 1988/, /in the appendix to my 
book in Spanish /Tiempo c?clico y eras del mundo en la India /(/Cyclical 
Time and World Ages in India/), which includes several diagrams. That 
book is different from /The Mah?bh?rata and the Yugas/ (2002). I mention 
this because I've been asked if one book is just a translation of the 
other. It is not, they are two different books.

I have just uploaded the book (/Tiempo c?clico.../) to academia. edu, in 
case anyone would like to see it or download it. The appendix is on pp. 
153-163:

All the best,
