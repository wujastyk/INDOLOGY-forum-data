[INDOLOGY] Diacriticals in unicode, single or multiple glyphs
On this issue of combining accents or single pre-combined glyphs, Andrew
Ollett has already stated the issues.  The Unicode Consortium's
documentation about this business is at
   - http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/
As Andrew said, the terminology is "Normalization Form," and there are
several of these, and quite a few points to consider when writing programs
to work with Unicode.  The Unicode consortium makes available algorithms
for dealing with all this, and modern text-processing software libraries
for Unicode are commonly aware of Normalization Forms and "do the right
thing," so the end-user doesn't have to worry.
This doesn't always work, though.  I find that when I cut-n-paste from
WorldCat, for example, into JabRef, all the accented letters are retained
in NFD format, and it's annoying.
Mostly, when we talk about typing IAST with pre-composed, single-glyph
characters like ?, we're doing what the Unicode people call "Normal Form
Composed" or NFC.  The files in SARIT and elsewhere are in this format.
Best,
Dominik
