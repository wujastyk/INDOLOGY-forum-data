Dear Indologists,

A reminder that the Digital Textualities in South Asia Symposium at UBC is just two days away! If you are interested in Digital Humanities, and how this field can be applied to the study of premodern South Asia, we would love to have you join us this Friday and Saturday at the Asian Centre at UBC, or online at dtsa.ubcsanskrit.ca.

All best wishes,

How might new technologies help us preserve and make better sense of the vast but vulnerable textual cultures of pre-digital South Asia? This research symposium at UBC will bring together leading international scholars who are actively adopting and developing digital technologies for the study of South Asian textual cultures, in order to share insights, tools, and techniques, to propose broader research questions, and to chart future directions for collaborative inquiry. The sessions will be live-streamed on the symposium website: dtsa.ubcsanskrit.ca, and you may send comments and feedback via the twitter hashtag, #dtsaUBC.

Peter Robinson (University of Saskatchewan)
