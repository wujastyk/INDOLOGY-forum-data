=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_The_date_of_Old_Tamil_Ca=E1=B9=85kam_poetry?=
Dear List members,
This is to let you know that I have written an article about David Shulman's attempt to date Ca?kam poetry in his recent book Tamil. A Biography (Massachusetts 2016). By way of experiment I have placed a pdf of the article directly on my website (go to "publications", then to "Articles").
The title of the article is:
"Myth versus concocted empiricist histories.
David Shulman's reconstruction of the history of Tamil Ca?kam poetry".
With the best wishes, Herman
