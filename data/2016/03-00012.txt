It's possible that from some perspective (principally Malhotra's own), he
is, as you so vividly put it "the elephant in the room". Alas there are no
scholars of South Asian languages, history, texts, traditions or classics
in that room to notice or ignore this elephant.

As for Swarajya and Open and Bibek Debroy, you forget that unlike most
people on this list I actually live in India. The political affiliations of
the current owners and editors and contributors of these publications, and
Mr. Debroy's closeness to the government and the Prime Minister, are not
mysterious or hidden facts. I'm inclined to take such reviews with, how to
put it, a pinch of saffron.

I hadn't heard about Niti Central's closure. Thanks for that information.
Goes to show that it wasn't really central enough for anyone to notice that
it had gone out of business.

The long list of event venues and sponsoring eminences you provide has no
bearing on Malhotra's failure to explain his habits of plagiarizing,
cannibalizing, distorting, misunderstanding and misrepresenting other
people's scholarship, nor can they disguise the fact that like the Emperor
who had no clothes, Rajiv Malhotra has no argument -- nothing of substance,
nothing meaningful with which to entice the scholarly community into any
kind of engagement with him.

One can only hope that he derives some comfort from the manufactured
consent and paid loyalty of the petition signatories in their thousands.

Ananya Vajpeyi.
