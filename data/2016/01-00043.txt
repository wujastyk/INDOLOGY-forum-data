[INDOLOGY] FYI: Spoken Sanskrit blog entry plus discussion at	"Language Log"
FYI: Victor Mair posted an interesting entry on Spoken Sanskrit on the
weblog "Language Log" (that some of you might already follow):
http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23412
It's related to a recent workshop in Jerusalem ("A Lasting Vision:
Dandin?s Mirror in the World of Asian Letters"), and also includes
reports and reflections by some of the workshop participants.
With best regards,
