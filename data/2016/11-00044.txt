[INDOLOGY] bhakti
Dear Patrick,
I went to the website you directed us to.
It is an ISKCON activity.
It is well known that ISKCON is based on Goudiya Vaishnava Vedanta which is
one of the Bhakti (centred) schools of Vedanta.
What they are saying here is that GEV is based on their philosophy. Their
philosophy is a school of Vedanta and Vedanta is Vedic. So GEV is based on
Vedic Bhakti Vedanta is not wrong. The word Bhakti Yoga is used here in
that sense. So I don't see anything wrong in the word Vedic here.
The word 'Vedic' is not always used in the sense of ' as in Vedas'. The
word is quite often used in the sense of 'belonging to the lineage of the
cultural/textual complex of which the Vedas are (of course, vital)
