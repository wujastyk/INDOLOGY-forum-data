[INDOLOGY] From the Mahabharata
Therefore, to me the essence of ?conquering hunger? in this context is not
abstention from food even when the body is hungry, rather it refers to the
Br?hma?a family's [one-time] act of upholding atithi-dharma and feeding a
hungry guest even though the family was itself hungry. The host Br?hma?a
and his family conquered their own hunger to satisfy the hunger of a guest.
So
*how *do you keep your hunger under control?
automatically controlled.
A student skipping his meal on account of being absorbed in his
book-reading in the library, a scientist not feeling his hunger on account
of his immersion in his experiment in the laboratory can be said to have
bubukShaajaya.
