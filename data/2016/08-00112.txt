[INDOLOGY] Sad Demise of Prof. Muneo Tokunaga
This is indeed very sad news to have lost the generous and learned Professor Nanavati and our esteemed colleague Professor Tokunaga in such a short period. Tokunaga-san and I collaborated on editing  volume 2 of the papers of the 12th World Sanskrit Conference and I came to have enormous respect for his kindness and scholarship. Both of these stalwarts will be missed.
