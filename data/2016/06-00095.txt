[INDOLOGY] J?ti as Caste in Ny?ya?
Dear Rajam,
"Gotva" is "cow-ness," the nature of a cow, or the universal "cow."

 The concept of gotva was brought in by the 'originator of the thread' Prof. Davis himself, not by me. He used the English translation of it, 'cow-ness'.?
The point I was making was that for naiyaayikas , 'cow-ness' is?similar to?'pot-ness'. We can extend this and use words? like pencilness and carness too.
?If? braamhaNatva (brahminness) ?is taken only as similar to cowness, it leads to the ideas such as 'the varnas have been viewed as similar to biological species'. But in fact, brahminness is viewed as similar to carness and pencilness. 
If one resorts to sources of knowledge?other than empirical observation or direct perception to substantiate the '-ness' of a certain group of entities, it shows that one has an understanding that commonality of that group of entities is not an empirically verifiable or directly?perceivable one. 
If one lists empirically verifiable or directly?perceivable?features to identify the common identity of a group of entities, then?one need not and does not usually resort to any other source of knowledge as the Vedas for that purpose. 
Prof. Aklujkar pointed out the difference between jaati of grammarians which is the commonality in the meanings of?words denoting entities or the meaning of the word denoting the group of entities and jaati of the naiyaayikas which is the commonality in the entities.??

Thanks to Professor Paturi for touching on the concept of ?gotva.??
May I ask a naive question: What is the basic semantics of the word??gotva?? I?m familiar with??gotra.?
Thanks and regards,rajam

Correction:I typed:3.?Those mentioned by Jayanta are?not?saying BraahmaNatva etc. are not like gotva etc. They are saying exactly the opposite. They are saying 'because braahmanatva etc. are not like gotva etc. the validity of?what all Brahmins have in common can be verified / known only through?a different source of knowledge than the one that can establish what all cows have in common.?
I wanted to say:

1. While the discussion of Jayanta is mentioned to be on Varnas, the title of the post /thread has 'caste' in it. Since it is now well established that these two are two different categories /concepts, we might?need to be careful about this distinction. 
2. For Nyaya, gotva is as much a jaati?as ?ghaTatva is jaati. ghaTatvajaati is?as much?empirically?observable and directly perceivable asgotvajaati. ??

Many thanks to the originator of this thread!
Right now, I just want to register the fact that I?m very much interested in this topic.
Last year (May 2015), I had a publication (in Tamil) about references to, or a lack there of,??j?ti? and??caste? (as we understand it today) in Old Tamil literature/grammar, also known as Sangam literature/grammar.
I don?t know how many of you are aware of the fact that the English word??caste? has its origin in the Portuguese word??casta,? which was first recorded inArte da Lingua Malabar?written by Fr. Henrique Henriques in the mid-16th century.?
If one wants to dig deep into the understanding of the terms such as ?j?ti? and ?caste????one has to have a minimal understanding of the origins of the Western contact with India, which happened in the early 16-th century through Portuguese?arrival in South India.
Thanks and regards,V.S.Rajam

?Dear Don,
This interests me a lot, and I'd be grateful to read what you might write about it in future.? It's on my back-burner, but I've long wondered whether Sanskritic narratives about jati and varna can be thought about in ways similar to eighteenth and nineteenth century European narratives about races and species.? Were people of different varnas formally considered to be of different "species?" ? It's a bit shocking to think in these terms, but I've been wondering about it.? If you ever put flesh on these bones, one way or another, or can point me to existing discussions on this, I'd be really interested.
Best,Dominik

Dear Colleagues,
I would be grateful for additional references to an argument mentioned in Jayanta Bhatta?s?gama?ambara 4.143-4 (in Dezso?s edition in the Clay series).? The question is whether thej?ti of Brahmins, etc.?is like the j?ti of cow-ness, etc.?in being empirically observable or directly perceivable.? Jayanta refers to those who say that verbal/textual testimony alone (?abdam?tre?a) establishes the four-var?a system.? This prefigures an argument made in Vij??ne?vara?sMit?k?ar? (on Yaj 1.90) where the same distinction is drawn to refute an objection.
I assumed Jayanta would have made a similar argument in his Ny?yama?jar?, but I have not been able to locate it (probably because I barely know the Ny?ya literature).? If anyone could point me toward other instances of this issue, whether in original sources or contemporary research, I?d appreciate it.
Best,
