Dear members of the list, 

I would be very grateful if anyone could possibly help me to access the following article, which I have so far failed to locate in my local library or online:
Hazra R.C (1948), Ga?apati Worship and Upapur??as Dealing with it. In: Journal of the Ganganath Jha Research Institute 5 (1949), 263-276

Thank you very much in advance!

best,
Andrey
