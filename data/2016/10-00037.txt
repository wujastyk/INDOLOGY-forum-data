Dear Audrey 

First, thank you for raising this matter. I agree that it is vital that there is increased awareness around sexual harassment which is rampant in academia.

Second, it is a trope of sexual harassment claims that they are casually dismissed as mere gossip, even when there is strong evidence to the contrary. Pity this has occurred on this list too. 

Regards 
James

Whenever something like this comes to light about someone who is a colleague or perhaps even a friend, it is shocking and uncomfortable. Still, the more information we have, the better we are able to find the right side to be on here. (And yes, I think that unfortunately there are sides here, and many of us close enough to the situation need to choose one.)
