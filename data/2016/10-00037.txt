[INDOLOGY] Indologist at Center of Sexual Harassment Mess at Berkeley
Dear Audrey 
First, thank you for raising this matter. I agree that it is vital that there is increased awareness around sexual harassment which is rampant in academia.
Second, it is a trope of sexual harassment claims that they are casually dismissed as mere gossip, even when there is strong evidence to the contrary. Pity this has occurred on this list too.
