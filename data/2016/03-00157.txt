I would be very careful about signing such contracts. There is a trend 
in business these days to push liability and economic responsibility as 
far down the ladder as possible. Working as a translator, I regularly 
get served contracts that in principle could ruin me. Never sign such 
contracts. Never make yourself responsible for more than an amount of 
money you know you can handle. Don't operate on trust - be smart, check 
with a lawyer or find some other publishing solution.
