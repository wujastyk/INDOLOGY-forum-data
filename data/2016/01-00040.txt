[INDOLOGY] Question about a Pali name
Dear Colleagues,
     In the Pali canonical literature, we come across the word "Mant?n?" as
the name of a Brahmin woman.  Her husband is "Gagga", which can be easily
traced to Sanskrit "Garga".  I have been wondering about the Sanskrit
counterpart of the name "Mant?n?".  If one assumes something like
"Mantr???" in (vernacular?) Sanskrit, that would correspond to Pali
"Mant?n?".  The other possibility I was thinking is if Skt. Maitr?ya?? may
be the counterpart for Pali "Mant?n?".   I am not sure about this
alternative, since Skt. "maitra" would correspond to Pali "metta".   The
Pali expression "Mant?n?putta" occurs as a characterization of two
individuals, i.e. A?gulim?la and A???ko??a??a.  If these twp figures appear
in Sanskrit Buddhist literature, there is a possibility of finding a
Buddhist Sanskrit expression corresponding to Pali "Mant?n?putta".  I would
appreciate any suggestions/explanations/conjectures.  Thanks in advance.
