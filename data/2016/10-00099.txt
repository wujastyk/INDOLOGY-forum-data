[INDOLOGY] crossing oceans?
And the basic question to ask concerning Dominik?s question is: Who says that twice-born people cannot cross oceans? The Dharma??stras who say this, and other working under that ideological pronouncements, represent only one segment even of the Brahmanical tradition. Going by sea is take as normal in Kau?ilya?s Artha??stra, and that is,  I think, the first century CE. And, of course, the Buddhist examples and the spread of Sanskrit to SE Asian kingdoms (as Pollock has shown) required Brahmins and others to travel by sea. So, probably we should take the prohibition agains traveling by sea as an ideological statement rather than a historical fact.

I think these are two different issues, and the prohibition on crossing the ocean is distinct from the practical one for Buddhist monks against walking in the rainy season and stepping on small animals in puddles. The prohibition on ocean travel primarily affected Brahmins, who lost their ritual purity by leaving the sacred land of India where their rites could be carried out. In Buddhist and Jain texts, unlike Hindu ones, sea-going merchants are treated as heroic figures - no doubt in part because the merchant classes were powerful early supporters of these religions.

I think the origin of that idea is the ahi?s?-precept: Conquering water may kill animals (by accident).
I remember while working on my Ph. D. (Edition of Prakrit-manuscripts):
For a monk it is forbidden to step across water (e. g. during the rainy season) because he might step into the water and kill small animals.

This idea is also connected with the buddhist precept for monks not to travel during the rain season (vassa).

Dear Dominik,
When does the ban on ocean travel first appear? And when and how did it become the norm?
Ocean travel is often mentioned in Buddhist texts (e.g. BaverujAtaka) and the extension of
Indian civilization throughout SE Asia during the first millennium required Brahmans to journey
as well.
The theme of "India and the Sea" perhaps requires further inquiry -- or am I merely ignorant
of a great mass of research laying, so to speak, submerged?
best,
Matthew
