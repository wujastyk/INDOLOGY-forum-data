Dear List,

is a complete e-text of the *???g?raprak??a* available anywhere? I have
e-texts only of the first fourteen *prak??a*s. Even e-texts of individual
*prak??a*s following the 14th would be very much appreciated.

It would be of course equally helpful to have a pdf of any edition of the
same work. Actually I found pdfs of volumes 1, 2 and 4 of Josyer's edition,
but I cannot find a pdf of volume 3, that covers the *prak??a*s 15 to 24 (
*prak??a* 17 on the *anubh?va*s might be the most relevant for my present
research).
As the files I have look definitely like legally circulating ones, say from
DLI or similar repositories, I have reasons to hope that a pdf of the third
volume might turn up somewhere. Can anyone help with Josyer's or other
editions?

With best wishes,
