Dear Suresh,

Thanks so much for the details. I?m learning.

I thought 

///Hindi: ????, Rajasthani: ?????/????, Punjabi: ?????, Gujarati:
> ???,  Marathi: ??? ///

all referred to some kind of buttermilk-based dish. No?

I?ll definitely take a look at Roger Blench?s work. I love taro. In fact I?m trying to grow it in a container. 

In any case, please know that I?m not into claiming/proving anything.

My expertise in any field other than Tamil is zero!! 

Thanks and regards,
rajam
