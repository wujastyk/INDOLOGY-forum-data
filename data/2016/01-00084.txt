[INDOLOGY] Reconstructing Indus Curry!
Dear Suresh,
Thanks so much for the details. I?m learning.
I thought 
///Hindi: ????, Rajasthani: ?????/????, Punjabi: ?????, Gujarati:
all referred to some kind of buttermilk-based dish. No?
I?ll definitely take a look at Roger Blench?s work. I love taro. In fact I?m trying to grow it in a container. 
In any case, please know that I?m not into claiming/proving anything.
My expertise in any field other than Tamil is zero!! 
Thanks and regards,
rajam
