[INDOLOGY] Crypto-Hindu and crypto-Buddhist
Before R?m?nuja, it was Bh?skara who referred to *m?y?-v?din*-s as
*bauddha-mat?valambin. *Please see Chapter XV (The Bh?skara School of
Philosophy) in A History of Indian Philosophy (Volume 3), where Dasgupta
writes
Quote
Thus, at the very beginning of his commentary, he says that it aims at
refuting those who, hiding the real sense of the *s?tra*, have only
expressed their own opinions, and in other places also he speaks in very
strong terms against the commentator who holds the m?y? doctrine and is a
Buddhist in his views[3].
[3] *s?tr?-bhipr?ya-sa?v?ty? sv?bhipr?y?-prak??an?t, vy?khy?ta? yair idam
??stra? vy?khyeya? tan-niv?ttaye*. Bh?skara?s Commentary, p. i.
Also ?*ye tu bauddha-mat?valambino m?y?-v?dinas te?pi anena ny?yena
s?tra-k?re?ai?va nirast??*.? Ibid. II. 2. 29.
In another place ?a?kara is referred to as explaining views which were
really propounded by the Mah?y?na Buddhists?*vig?ta? vicchinna-m?la?
m?h?y?nika-bauddha-g?thita? m?y?-v?da? vy?var?ayanto lok?n vy?mohayanti*.
Ibid. 1. 4. 25.
