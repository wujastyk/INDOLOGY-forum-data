[INDOLOGY] Against the petition against Prof. Pollock
This appears to be the article that Matthew referred to. I missed it the first time around.

Thank you for taking the care to pick this apart, but
I do not think that there is any question of "misunderstanding."
I believe that it is, rather, a manifestation of a willful misconstrual of contemporary Indology
and that we find also expressed in R. Jagannathan's "American Orientalism" piece
to which Nityanand Misra called our attention in a post to this list not long ago.
all best,
Matthew
