Dear List,

Might anyone have a PDF of:

Derrett, JDM (ed.). 'Sah?numara?aviveka of Anantar?ma' in* Our heritage:
bulletin of the Department of Post-Graduate Training and Research*,
Sanskrit College, Calcutta: special number: 150th anniversary volume,
1824-1974, Calcutta, 1979 / [edited by Bishnupada Bhattacharya]

The copy at the Center for Research Libraries (Chicago) is lost and I don?t

Many thanks,
