Thank you Bill. I will focus on the case of ISKCON which I know fairly well.

Clearly we have here a clash of worldviews, each deploying its own hermeneutical strategy. To get a little distance and detachment so that we can be clear on the hermeneutical and epistemological issues, consider various learned approaches to Judeo-Christian studies and their sacred texts. The Academy of course favors the historical-critical method, which is surely an essential, invaluable piece of the puzzle. However it may not be the whole puzzle. 

For example, leading scholars of Judaism such as James Kugel point out that traditional Hebrew Bible scholars make four initial assumptions that guide their exegesis. 1. All the highly variegated books of the Hebrew Bible ultimately present a unified message; 2. The message is didactic, i.e. it has a clear telos which is to elevate its readers; 3. The text is divinely inspired; and 4. The ultimate meaning may not be literal. 
	Given those metaphysical assumptions which a priori cannot be empirically proved or disproved, traditional Bible scholarship is often internally consistent, clever, even at times profound. On the other hand, I believe that ?sacred? scholarlship that simply ignores the historical-critical method can easily become unhinged. 

I favor the approach of early Christian historian Dale Martin at Yale, who teaches the historical-critical method, yet points out the presumption of assuming that the historical-critical method necessarily reveals the final truth of a sacred text. 

Returning to explicit Indology, in the G?t? 15.15, K???a famously states, vedai? ca sarvair aham eva vedya?. Those who take this claim seriously as a spiritual truth will naturally accept that it warrants the notion of a unified, if complex, ?Vedic? message that points to K???a as the supreme knowable fact. Again, the historical-critical method, a priori, cannot prove or disprove such an obviously metaphysical claim about K???a. If one accepts the claim, then one may feel justified in a freer use of the adjective ?Vedic.? I hasten to add that even with this sort of ?sacred' hermeneutic there are modern uses of ?Vedic? that I too find silly and indeed unwarranted by anything that I can discern as rational.

Ironically, the Bh?gavat-pur??a, perhaps the most important member of ISKCON?s canon, uses the term vaidika in the modern academic sense, and not in the general ISKCON sense. The BP almost always use vaidika to indicate conventional ?ruti in contrast to tantrika texts, taken there to mean various Vai??ava sm?ti or  ?gama texts. Indeed, ISKCON?s canonical Caitanya-carit?m?ta restricts vaidika even further to the term vaidika br?hma?a, referring to a karma-k???a ritual technocrat. So curiously key ISKCON ??stras use Vaidika in the academic, not the ISKCON, sense.

Regarding the ?pseudo-scientifc? claims of ?Vedic? or Puranic cosmography, I suggest that one seriously consider the work of the late Dr. Richard Thompson on this topic.

Best,
Howard

I mentioned earlier illustrates quite tellingly, at least in this particular instance, what the intention was. To me, it seems to be part of an ongoing negotiation of the role of Indian culture in the modern world and an alternative narrative to the one created in the Western culture, one that Indians today both love and hate. In doing so, some sought to reclaim their identities as defined by themselves and not others.

There was not even any planet beside Sun and Moon mentioned explicitly in the early Vedic corpus and the Ved??gajyoti?a had no discussion of planets. The Pur??ic cosmology is a hodgepodge of ideas from various sources, both foreign and indigenous and across a long stretch of time. But this model of the universe was created in reaction to the Western model, to the one created by the Greeks, e.g. Ptolemy?s geocentric model, and eventually the development of the model of universe in Western astronomy up to the present day ? a powerful image to represent science and progress, which many today sought to align their values and belief-system to .

The proponents of the so-called ?Vedic science? suggest that not only India has science, it is a different science based on a possibly superior authority, i.e., a spiritual, all-encompassing revelation beyond human reasoning based on the ?Vedas," rather than philology and history based on fragments of the reality interpreted by humans. Of course, the arguments they constructed were practically entirely in Western terms, and the evidences they use are so methodologically and philologically unsound that most scholars do not consider them worthy of even consideration and decry them as pseudo-science. This seems to applies from more ludicrous claims such as ?Vedic astrophysics? or ?Vedic aeronautical science?, to the seemingly more benign ?Vedic mathematics? and ?Vedic astronomy?.

One interesting thing is that, even though my interlocutors (westerners for the most part)  almost all assert it means the above; when pressed to define what they consider the 'Vedic' part of the phrase to more specifically mean, the typical answer is overwhelmingly: "I don't really know". If asked to discuss the difference between the astrological, ie predictive systems, or the historical, parallel development of these systems, even some people who claim to be 'professional Vedic astrologers' seem unable to clearly differentiate them.

Dikshit seems to have a western academic understanding of 'Vedic' as a historical period, and he claims that the 'seeds' of a predictive system are present in Atharvajyoti?a, but he is also very clear that such a system is not the one based on the twelve-sign zodiac, although he thinks it 'probable' that the latter system, when it was imported into India, was influenced by the parallel, indigenous system. (Which undoubtedly it was, if perhaps not to the extent that Dikshit would have liked to think. The nak?atras are used in hor?, after all.) This is stated at the beginning of p. 100.

'Vedic' is used here simply in the sense of 'traditional Indian', the implied idea being a tradition that is not only ancient and unbroken, but essentially unchanged (and, as Robert has pointed out, sanctioned by Brahmanic authority).

See ?J?taka branch of astrology? under ?Atharva jyoti?a? in the section Veda?ga (Vol.1 p.97-98). Things might have come to the forefront in recent time, but such ideas have certainly been around.
