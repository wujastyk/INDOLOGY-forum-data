Subject: [INDOLOGY] MCLI / Pollock
Message-ID: <CAHxuC0R7HX9R8Mx=H1Ntetm-NMnpLFcdAS8KAs=7AFSuZtXtzw@mail.gmail.com>

Attention, Colleagues on Indology:

Rohan Murty, founder of the Murty Classical library of India, sets the
record straight -- General Editor (and Founding Editor) Pollock to stay,
and the MCLI to continue unhindered, as planned:

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/rohan-murty-says-american-indologist-sheldon-pollock-to-stay/articleshow/51231553.cms

A fitting rebuttal of the Hindu Right, and a tribute to Sheldon Pollock, by
his student, colleague and Columbia University historian by Manan Ahmed:

And a counter-petition by a different group of scholars:

Additional coverage of this issue may be found in The Washington Post, The
Wire.in, The Telegraph Calcutta, The Indian Express, Scroll.in, and a
number of other publications.
