Dear Indology-jana,

The Department of Religious Studies is conducting a search for a tenure track assistant professor specializing in Southeast Asian or North American traditions. I would also encourage a specialist in Pali literature to apply. Here is the announcement:

Relevant languages and fieldwork required. Ph.D. required. The successful candidate should have an active research agenda and be able to teach both introductory and advanced courses. The department, with thirteen full time members, offers B.A. and M.A. degrees and is located within FIU?s Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA).
