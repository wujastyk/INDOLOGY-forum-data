Dear Colleagues
Every year our third-year Sanskrit students read extracts from K?lid?sa's 'Abhij??na??kuntala'. As part of the program, each student is required to undertake a creative project based on the play. They make the play their 'own' by reinterpreting it in a medium in which they excel. The final project can be in any form -- except an essay.
I am delighted to share one of the most outstanding projects of the year with you, 'Snippets from Abhij??na??kuntala the Musical' by Duncan Standish. In it, you will hear the king Du?yanta describing the season of summer and giving instructions to his charioteer as they pursue a deer through the forest. In the third snippet the king describes the beauty of the heroine ?akuntal?.

I am sure Duncan your be delighted to hear from you if you enjoyed his work:  u5688243 at anu.edu.au
I can't help feeling that K?lid?sa himself would be pleased with this.
Yours
