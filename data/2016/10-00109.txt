[INDOLOGY] warriors v soldiers
Dear Friends,
Please forgive the possibly naive nature of this question, but was it the
case that all warriors were considered to be of the same k?atriya class?
Or, was it possible that the 'officers' were k?atriyas and the 'foot
soldiers' were perhaps of a different caste, i.e. enslaved ?udras forced to
fight? Is there any discussion of the militiary organisation according to
ranks, size  and hierarchy similar to the table below?
Thanks in advance.
