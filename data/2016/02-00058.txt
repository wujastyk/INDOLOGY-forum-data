Dear Harry and all,
Many thanks for the advice about the key strokes and re-establishing the old system.
Best,
Ken

Dear Kenneth,

In order to restore your keystrokes in Word click on the INSERT menu then click on the "symbols"menu and click on "more symbols" a window frame should then show up.  This window frame then allows you to select the font you want to work. The characters of that font then show up in this window frame.  You click on the character and then click on "set keyboard shortcut". and a new menu shows up that allows you to enter the new keyboard shortcuts.  There is a setting in this window that says where the new shortcuts are being saved to.  Make sure that is set to either normal.dot or normal.dotm .

Note: I don't have the same version of Word you have but the procedure to get the window frame to show up that allows you to set the keyboard shortcuts should be very similar to what I've described above.

Dear List,

Recently I received automatic updates from Microsoft and as a result lost all my key strokes for Gandhari Unicode fonts recorded in Normal.dot. It tried to reinstall a back-up of Normal.dot, but it failed.  My word programme is Word professional plus 7.
Does anyone know how I can restore the key strokes for Gandhari Unicode?
Many thanks for any help you can offer.
Best,
Ken
