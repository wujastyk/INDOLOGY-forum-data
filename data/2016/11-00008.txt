Subject: [INDOLOGY] First female sovereign
Message-ID: <BBB9FCA9-3F5A-4A2F-8663-45C8453D211E@wwu.edu>

Dear colleagues,

Who was the first female sovereign in India?  I know about Razia Sultana in the 13th century, but were there any earlier?  Has there been any more recent research on Razia since Rafiq Zakaria?s 1966 book?

Thank you,

Michael
