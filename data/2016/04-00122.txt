[INDOLOGY] Another round in the California textbook story
Thanks, Dominik.
Ships passing in the night? None of the quotes opposing right-wing revisions addressed the main argument: that 6th and 7th grade textbooks in Calif do not tell the dark side of other religions or cultures, at least not to the same extent.
Personally, I have no idea what these textbooks tell or don?t tell about other cultures and religions. I am simply interested in equal treatment, and the article did not address that issue. The article headline states that right-wing groups ?deny the reality? of historical evils. But the quotes provided simply show a plea for equal treatment in children?s textbooks, not an explicit denial of history.
What?s going on here?
