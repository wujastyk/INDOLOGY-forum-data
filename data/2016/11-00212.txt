Dear Alakendu Das,

To Ratn?kara, 9th century Kashmir, author of the Haravijaya, is
attributed a chronicle of the kings of Kashmir, possibly only
surviving in fragments of translations into Persian and Urdu. See the
following blog post of Vinayak Razdan,
http://www.searchkashmir.org/2014/06/hasan-shah-and-lost-kings-of.html
,  and, linked from there, scans of two articles of Pandit Ananda Koul
in the Journal and Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal from
early 20th century, https://archive.org/details/HasansHistoryOfKashmir
. I was made aware of it by Muzaffar Ahmad,
https://independent.academia.edu/MuzaffarAhmad , who is working on it.

Best Regards,

Peter Pasedach
