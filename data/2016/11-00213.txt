Dear Clemency,

Just a quick note to you and your collaborators thanking you for the lovely
font. I'm using it now for my Sanskrit I final and it is so much better
than what I had before. Conjuncts that are correct!

Thank you so much and cheers!

> Dear Colleagues,

> I'm passing on this announcement from my collaborators at IITBombay who
> have just released a beautiful new Devanagari font called Shobhika.  The
> font has been carefully and mindfully executed by a team of Sanskrit, IT,
> and visual design specialists, and the attention to detail that has gone
> into all aspects of the process produces a very pleasing end result (I
> attach a screen shot for a quick view of the font).
>
> Please find below the link to the public Github repository of the free,
> open source font. The instructions to download v1.0 of the font are given
> under the 'Downloading the font' section in the link below:

> https://github.com/Sandhi-IITBombay/Shobhika
>
> I quote from their preamble:
>
> "Shobhika is a free, open source, Unicode compliant, OpenType font with
> support for Devan?gar?, Latin, and Cyrillic scripts. It is available in two
> weights?regular and bold. The font is designed with over 1600 Devan?gar?
> glyphs, including support for over 1100 conjunct consonants, as well as
> vedic accents. The Latin component of the font not only supports a wide
> range of characters required for Roman transliteration of Sanskrit, but
> also provides a subset of regularly used mathematical symbols for scholars
> working with scientific and technical documents. The project has been
> launched under the auspices of the Science and Heritage Initiative (SandHI)
> at IIT Bombay<https://github.com/Sandhi-IITBombay/Shobhika/
> blob/master/www.iitb.ac.in>, and builds upon the following two fonts for
> its Devan?gar? and Latin components respectively: (i) Yashomudra<
> https://github.com/RajyaMarathiVikasSanstha/Yashomudra> by R?jya Mar??h?
> Vik?s Sa?sth?<https://rmvs.maharashtra.gov.in/>, and (ii) PT Serif<
> https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif> by ParaType<
> http://www.paratype.com/>. We would like to thank both these
> organisations for releasing their fonts under the SIL Open Font Licence,
> which has enabled us to create Shobhika. "
>
> The creators of the font also request any feedback that you have so that
> it may be further improved.
>
> With best wishes,
> Clemency
