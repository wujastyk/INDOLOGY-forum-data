Dear Jean,
Since you said "Dear Colleagues"
I am forwarding your message to the list.
re:Re: [INDOLOGY] 'Vedic' astrology
Dear Colleagues,
I don't agree with what has just been said (see below) about maths of the
sulbasutra and even of the chandas. As far as I know, they have never been
called Vedic and I have myself, and many other researchers I know, always
been very cautious to make the distinction. See the title of my recent book
http://www.droz.org/eur/fr/6416-9782600013826.html by instance.
