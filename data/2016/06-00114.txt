[INDOLOGY] Jati as Caste in Nyaya?
See also the presentation of the problem of j?ti in the meya portion of the M?nameyodaya (2, 3 = j?ti, 1-18)
Kunhan Raja C.  & Suryanarayana Sastri S. S. 21975, M?nameyodaya of N?r?ya?a Bha??a and N?r?ya?a Pa??ita (an elementary treatise on the M?m??s?), Madras, Adyar Library Series 105,  pp. 233-244.
? p. 243 (17 - Bh???a conclusion):  "Thus is established 'Brahminness'. What apprehends it is the sense of sight itself assisted by the understanding of his being born of a Brahmin father and mother, whose Brahminness is not corrupted; hence it is not non-perceptible either"
Cf. also (recognized as one of the main sources of the M?nameyodaya) the earlier N?titattv?virbh?va of Cid?nanda (cf. ?d. P. K. Narayana Pillai 1953, N?titattv?virbh?va of Cid?nandapa??ita, Trivandrum, TSS 168 ; cf. republ. in K. T. Pandurangi 2008, Cid?nanda-pa??ita-viracita?, N?titattv?virbh?va?, M?m??s?bh??yapari?i??ena Tantrarahasyena ca sahita?, Bangalore), the 20th topic of which is J?tinir?aya, apparently more directed against the Buddhist views, without dealing with the problem of Brahminhood (abstract in Pandurangi 2008 pp. xvii-viii, EIPh 16, p. 114-15). 
I did not go into the provided ??likan?tha's text in details (and did not start to search into Prabh?kara's own commentatorial works where the original statements could be found), but from secondary sources, it appears that Bh???as and Pr?bh?karas differ here in the explanation. For both j?ti is a perceptible category, but the relation of  j?ti with individual is given as a combination of difference and non-difference for the former, whereas it is difference for the latter, according to whom the apposition (individual - universal) is through inherence. Pr?bh?karas admit the existence of genus/class of substance, but refuse to accept the existence of genus of quality and action. 
And according to Pr?bh?karas, differently from the case of cowness, Brahminhood or K?atriyahood are not considered as real j?ti:
? MM p. 239 (- 9): "Although the genus is thus established, the Guru [Prabh?kara] says that, since its cognition is invariably controlled by the knowledge of the earlier form, existence, soundness, Brahminness, etc. which have not that knowledge are non-existent".
So the debate referred to could be internal to Mimamsakas rather than between Mimamsakas and Buddhists.
