[INDOLOGY] Origin of Mah?c?na
Certainly not the oldest usage, the term is found in Eastern ??kta texts from the late medieval period as a way of blaming the Chinese for some of the more scandalous tantric practices, called the c?n?c?ra "what the Chinese do." There is also a specific text, C?n?c?ra Tantra devoted to these left-handed practices.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Origin of Mah?c?na
Let me add one additional complication. Two millennia ago the Chinese used the name Daqin (Great Qin) to refer not just to themselves, but to refer to the Roman Empire.

from the notes to the translation by John E. Hill of
"A Translation of the Chronicle on the 'Western Regions' from the Hou Hanshu.
Based on a report by General Ban Yong to Emperor An (107-125 CE) near the end of his reign, with a few later additions.
Compiled by Fan Ye (398-446 CE)."
