Dear All,

Does any of you have a reliable contact in Jodhpur (Rajasthan Oriental
Research Institute) to help me getting a couple of manuscript scans? I was
there in 2014 and had no problems, but at the moment I am receiving no
answer from the Director (whom I have tried to contact through the
website). Thank you.

Best,

Alessandro Battistini
Gonda fellow, IIAS Leiden
