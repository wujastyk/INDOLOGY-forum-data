[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] Passing of Ludo Rocher
I am so saddened to hear the news of Ludo's passing. His excellence as a Sanskritist was surpassed only by his excellence as a human being. He was a friend, my dissertation mentor, a model and a guide. I'll never forget his avuncular style, sense of humor, clarity of mind, and generosity. The man had a steel spine; he was strong in all the good ways, yet deeply compassionate. I never knew him to be afraid of anything; and he enjoyed life. A steady, kind soul. I will miss him.
John
