[INDOLOGY] dna and castes
Dear Colleagues,
While one may reasonably argue that the corporal metonymy of var?a in the Puru?as?kta is non-hierarchical and instead based on a vision of organic unity, I would suggest (and have argued in my recent book _Crossing the Lines of Caste_) one can observe the beginnings of the hierarchical division between Br?hma?a and K?atriya categories in the Aitareya Br?hma?a?s ?una??ep?khy?na (c. 750-500BCE?), where it still seems possible for a radical fellow like Vi?v?mitra to assert that he is *both* Brahm??a and K?atriya, a notion that would defeat hierarchical divisions, but one that ?una??epa finds a bit difficult to accept. 
For at the same time, we find in the same narrative an explicit condemnation of ??dras (AB 7.17) and Dasyus, and a statement that Br?hma?as are better than K?atriyas (7.15, bh?y?n vai br?hma?o k?atriy?t). Admittedly this is in the context of being a sacrificial victim for Varu?a, but perhaps that is not so different in Vedic social thought.
All best wishes,
Adheesh
