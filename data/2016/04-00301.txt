Dear Dr Ganesan,
The word Shiva in Svetashvatara Upanishad is understood as a descriptive
term with meanings such as benevolent, blissful etc.
Do you want to see that word as referring to Shiva, with the attributes
such as Kailaasavaasa, jaTaajooTadhaaraNa, naagaabharaNadhaaraNa etc. ?
If yes, which part of the text has support to such view?
