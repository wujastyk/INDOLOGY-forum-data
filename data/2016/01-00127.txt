[INDOLOGY] Online Sanskrit Study Programs
Dear list,
The University of Copenhagen is currently looking into the possibility 
of setting up online study programs in various disciplines related to 
Asian studies, including Indo-Tibetan studies (language-learning as well 
as more general courses introducing various subjects). I would therefore 
be interested to know of other universities which offer such programs, 
and what the experience with them has been (e.g. which kinds of courses 
have the most potential for being successful).
Kind regards,
Jacob
