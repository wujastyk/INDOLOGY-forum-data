Likening the sun to eye, occurring in the next quarter, is not implausible.
Chandramaa manaso jaata.h might be a play with word - chandramas and manas
are alliterative. The Braahmanas sometimes aggrandize old sayings with eye
to ritual. I add that the Braahmana often state authentic Vedic beliefs and
tradition too.
