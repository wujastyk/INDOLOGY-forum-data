[INDOLOGY] Devanagari font adequacy
Dear Prof. Scharf
Are the .tex files available for reference? Would be helpful to use them.
Some of the conjuncts in Ulrich Stiehl's list are absent in Sanskrit. For
example ??? (conjunct # 572 in Stiehl's list) would be impossible in
Sanskrit due to ???? ??? ???.
As for the five recommended fonts, how many have bold, bold italic, and
italic weights? I know that Chandas, Sanskrit 2003, (and most probably
Uttara too) have only one weight. It is impractical to typeset a book in a
single weight. One can resort to AutoFakeBold and AutoFakeSlant options in
LaTeX but the result would be unprofessional. Another thing is that fonts
like Chandas are good for screen, but when printed they look synthetic. The
two strokes in ? of Chandas are both straight lines, looks very unnatural.
The font I have settled for with use in LaTeX is Chanakya Sanskrit by
Summit Information Technology Pvt Ltd based in Gurgaon. This is the
extension of the legacy Chanakya font that is used by all standard Indian
publishers like Gita Press. Beautiful, artistic, and with four weights. It
is expensive to buy, but worth the money if one wants to use the fonts to
publish books. Sample pages of a book I recently designed and typeset in
XeLaTeX using Chanakya Pro (Chanakya Sanskrit is a superset of Chanakya
Pro) are attached.
PS: Chanakya Pro and Chanakya Sanskrit are both without Vedic accents. This
is a limitation.
PPS: I stopped using skt package long ago, since XeLaTeX allows direct
Unicode input. For four years now I have used XeLaTeX with polyglossia to
typeset books in Sanskrit and Hindi.
Thanks, Nityanand
