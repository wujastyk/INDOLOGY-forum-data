[INDOLOGY] Query
Patrick
V?caspati?s Bh?mat? on Brahmas?tra begins with some ma?galam  verses, one of which reads:
m?rta??a-tilakasv?mi-mah?ga?apat?n vayam  I
vi?vavandy?nnamasy?ma? sarvasiddhividh?yina?  || 4
This parallels Vij??ne?vara?s "?ditya-skanda-ga?apat?n?m?
Govind?nanda's Ratnaprabh?vy?khy? on BrS 3.3.1 is similarly introduced:
m?rta??a? dhv?ntan???ya tilakasv?mina? mude |
vighne?a? vighnavidhvastyai pra?am?mi muhurmuhu? ||

[INDOLOGY] Query
In the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti (1.290 ? but 1.294 in Vij??ne?vara?s enumeration and 1.292 in Apar?rka?s) we have the verse:
?dityasya sad? p?j?? tilakasv?minas tath? |
mah?ga?apate? caiva kurvan siddhim av?pnuy?t ||
My critical edition has the reading ?tilakasv?minas? following the Malayalam mss. and Vi?var?pa?s commentary. Vij??ne?vara and Apar?rka (as also all the Vulgate manuscripts) read ?tilaka? sv?minas?. Vij?? explains tilakam as: ?dityaskandaga?apat?n?m anyatamasya sarve??? v? tilaka? svar?anirmita? r?pyanirmita? v? kurgan. So he takes ?tilaka? as a forehead mark (ornament) made out of gold or silver and, probably, attached to a statue of one of these gods.
If, however, Vi?var?pa is correct, and the verb kurvan has a single object ?p?j?m?, then we have the compound ?tilakasv?minas?, which nicely parallels ?mah?ga?apate??.
My query is, has anyone seen the epithet ?tilakasv?min? applied to Skandia. I?d be much obliged for any comments on this.
With thanks and best wishes,
Patrick
