[INDOLOGY] FYI: Spoken Sanskrit blog entry plus discussion at "Language Log"
Inside that blog entry, see one statement made by David Shulman:
// Spoken Sanskrit uses the classical morphology (the verbal system 
perhaps somewhat reduced in its range), but its syntax often follows 
whatever spoken mother tongue the speaker uses. In this, however, it is 
continuous with medieval written Sanskrit which, despite what one reads 
in various primers and other works, is actually a left-branching 
language (like all other South Asian languages in the Dravidian and 
Indo-Iranian families), unlike Vedic, which is right-branching (like 
Greek, Latin, English, German, etc.).  Also, medieval Sanskrit has the 
same profusion of modal and aspectual forms that we find in other South 
Asian languages, although these forms have largely gone unnoticed by 
scholars trained in the old Indo-European paradigms. //

That statement reminded me of earlier remarks, on INDOLOGY, concerning 
the features labeled "left-branching" and "right-branching", discussed 
in August 2015 on this list.
See for instance Hans Henrich Hock's message, dated 18th August
which started with:
"Let me add a few more cents? worth.
The idea that Indo-Aryan, including Sanskrit, fundamentally differs from 
Dravidian in its syntactic typology, though sanctioned by a certain 
?tradition? in South Asian linguistics, is problematic on several 
counts. [...]"

I, for one, would welcome seeing more pointers towards published literature
