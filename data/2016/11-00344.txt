Subject: [INDOLOGY] Georges Dumezil's Tripartite Ideology text
Message-ID: <CAJ=BjrC8ne4ACLv__=HfQ34oLWzc+sT=J1c70ZT+ys97OT+WyA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Does anyone have a PDF of George Dum?zil's "L'Id?ologie Tripartie des
Indo-Europ?ens"?  An english translation (if it exists) would be perfect,
but even a copy in French would be appreciated.  I just can't seem to find
it anywhere.

Thank you,
