[INDOLOGY] Georges Dumezil's Tripartite Ideology text
Dear All,
Does anyone have a PDF of George Dum?zil's "L'Id?ologie Tripartie des
Indo-Europ?ens"?  An english translation (if it exists) would be perfect,
but even a copy in French would be appreciated.  I just can't seem to find
it anywhere.
Thank you,
