[INDOLOGY] a i and ai
Thank you to the colleagues for their valuable remarks and suggestions.
Within a compound, I would adopt in this case the solution of the diaeresis/trema (Monier-Willams, Bloomfield, etc.), mana?+indriya- = mana?ndriya, and keep, distinctly, the apostrophe for the different case where an initial a is elided e.g. mana?+artha = mano'rtha.
Best wishes,
Christophe
