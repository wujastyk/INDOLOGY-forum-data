PDF files of individual pages of both volumes are available on the website
of the Digital Silk Road Project of the National Institute of Informatics
in Japan. The attached files have the links.

I could not find a link to get the full book in the PDF form, but you may
use a download manager (alternatively, use Cygwin on Windows or wget in a
shell script on a *nix system) and then combine the PDF files into a single
PDF using Acrobat or any other PDF merge utility.
