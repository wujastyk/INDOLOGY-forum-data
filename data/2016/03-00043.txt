PDF files of individual pages of both volumes are available on the website
of the Digital Silk Road Project of the National Institute of Informatics

I could not find a link to get the full book in the PDF form, but you may
use a download manager (alternatively, use Cygwin on Windows or wget in a
shell script on a *nix system) and then combine the PDF files into a single
PDF using Acrobat or any other PDF merge utility.
