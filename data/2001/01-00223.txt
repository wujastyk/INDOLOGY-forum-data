GItA verse XVI-8
"Narayan R.Joshi" <giravani at JUNO.COM> has written as follows:
Gita is not unique in labeling nonbelievers  with the most obnoxious
adjectives and epithets and therefore betrays its own human origin.
It is easy to see that Deva and Asurs were two different sects who hated the
guts of each other just like communists and capitalists of this day. To the
followers of Asur or Ahur , the word Dev or Devil is as repugnant as Asur is
to the followers of the Dev.
You cannot take the label  given by one to its enemy to define the true
nature of the enemy.
Have a peaceful and joyous day.
