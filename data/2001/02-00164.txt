Mystics and Missionaries
Satya Upadhya <satya_upadhya at HOTMAIL.COM> has written as follows:
Surely does.
I remember when HK used to accost at airports dressed in saffron uniform but
now they have decided to adorn regular outfit.
However, there is a difference from the mainline Hinduism which is not a
messianic  religion and therefore no missionaries. A native Hindu can only
be outcasted but not incasted since  there is no concept of conversion to
Hinduism. There is no ritual that can be performed to convert a non-Hindu to
Hinduism. It is only later day messiahs like Dayanand, Ramkrishnand, Mahesh
Yogi and Prabhupad who have adopted western missionary techniques to their
own brand of Hinduism and have been fairly successful.
Let me add that the very first messianic religion, Buddhism,  did originate
in India and it did have missionaries.
Have a peaceful and joyous day.
