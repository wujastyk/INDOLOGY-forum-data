Dear Colleagues on the Conv-dev mailing list
You will be pleased to hear that ISO FDIS 15919 "Transliteration of
Devanagari and related Indic scripts into Latin Characters" has been
approved at its final vote.   We now await the publication of this
International Standard as ISO 15919.
I heartily thank all those who have made this result possible by their
participation in the technical discussions.   Without this mailing list
it would not have been possible to reach a consensus within the allotted
time, and it has been a pleasure to work with the members.
Many thanks,  Tony Stone
Dr Anthony P. Stone, Project Leader for ISO 15919 (Transliteration of
Indic scripts) under ISO/TC46/SC2/WG14.
