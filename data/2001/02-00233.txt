  Urdu remained as the language of the masses, while the elite spoke their
ancestral Turkic/Persian/Pashto/Arabic. Having originated at the camps of
Mahmud-e-Ghazni (whence the name `Urdu' or camp) at Ghazna, Urdu spread
across the Indus-Ganges plains from the 11th century onwards.
 Likewise many in India question the use of Hindi as national language,
and suggest Tamil or Sanskrit be the national language. Since Tamil is far
older and has a much richer literature than Hindee, and is the language of
the IT-literate state of India, its use as national language is far more
rational than Hindee.
 If an emperor could compose verses, surely what more does one need in the
way of "official" encouragement ?
