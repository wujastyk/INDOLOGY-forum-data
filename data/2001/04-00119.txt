CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT

INFORMATION ACCESS, INFORMATION PROCESS:  RESEARCH ON SOUTH ASIA

You are invited to attend a conference which focuses on the relationship
between information repositories (libraries, archives, digital databases,
etc.) and the kinds and methods of research that they support and generate.

WHEN: May 4, 2001

WHERE: Michigan Room, Michigan League, University of Michigan

CONFERENCE THEME:
Academic research is comprised of, limited to, and determined by the data
and raw material available to the researcher.  Those whose work demands
creation of resources, such as anthropologists or oral historians are all
too familiar with the complexities of information, how it is acquired and
how one might evaluate its relevance and importance.  However, those
working with physical troves of information (printed books, manuscripts,
and the like), particularly those that are found in institutional
frameworks, often neglect to question how those materials came to be
available or how their work might be different under different
institutional or informational circumstances.   Fluctuating influences such
as government funding, library initiatives, and donor generosity have a
dramatic impact on what resources might be available to the researcher.
Bureaucratic details and structures, classification schemes and notions of
organizational propriety can further sway the direction and nature of
scholarly investigation.   It is these relationships that will be explored
in this conference.

The goal of this conference is both theoretical and practical.  We want to
ask both how and why we organize academic inquiry in the way we do.  The
theoretical question focuses on the influence of our current informational
structures on the products of our research.  The practical question is how
we can overcome the constraints of these institutional boundaries in the
pursuit of long-lasting mutual benefits for both individuals and
institutions within and outside of South Asia.
