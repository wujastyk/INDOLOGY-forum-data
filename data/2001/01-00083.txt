I had forgotten your appetite for references :-)

I'm away from my books but you may want to check EI v.
8, Inscriptions of Rajendra. I remember this to have
some text concerning a closely associated
caturvedimangalam and the temple iTaikazi.

Regards,

LS

PS: What about cEntan tiruvaicaippa (verse 4 or 5)? Do
you have the text of it? It does, I remember, refer to
a "tiruviTaikkazi" but it may be a different one.
