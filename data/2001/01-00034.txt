Kumarajiva
hello V.T,
i remember to have read about Kumarjiva long back in a
book on Chinese Buddhism in thew University Library of
Osmania University, Andhrapradesh, India.
aumarajiva was a Indian Buddhist who migratedto China
in 6 th century AD along with Dharmaraksha another
Buddhist monk.
I also remember that the photo of monastary where the
Stupa of Kumarajiva was there in China was also given
there.
