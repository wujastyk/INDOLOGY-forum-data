>Introduction
> I attempt in this paper to clarify certain essential teachings of the
>Bhagavad-g?t? which are traditionally "zones of puzzlement" among scholars.
>These areas focus on a single point: the nature and status of God, Krishna,
>according to the G?t?. My strong conviction is that the G?t? itself is a
>lucid, self-explanatory work, and therefore the occasional practice of
>commentators to force on it extraneous doctrines often renders the text
>obscure where it is bright, esoteric where it is literal, and impersonal
>where it is intensely personal. I am operating here on an ancient principle
>which holds that certain Vedic  literatures are svata--pr?m?yam, literally
>"evident in or by themselves". As stated in the Bhavibya-pur?na:
> rig-yajur-s?m?rtharv?r ca  bh?ratam pa?ca-r?trakam
> m?la-r?m?yana? caiva  veda ity eva sabdit?h
> pur?n?ni ca y?n?ha  vaisvav?ni vido viduh
> svatah-pr?m?nyam eteb?? n?tra ki?cid vic?ryate
> ?The rig Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda, Mah?bh?rata, Pa?car?tra and
>original R?m?yana are all considered by authorities to be Veda. The knowers
>also know that those Pur?nas dedicated to Lord Visnu enjoy the same status.
>These literatures are self-evident, and there is nothing at all to
speculate
>about them.?
> It should be noted at once that the above exegetic principle does not do
>away with intellectual response to the scriptures. Rather it is a call for
>sober hermeneutical practices, in which we first struggle to comprehend a
>scriptural message on its own terms, through careful study of its internal
>structures of meaning.
> We get some historical flavor of this methodology by turning to a
>fascinating theological debate which took place almost 500 years ago in
>Benares between Sr? Caitanya Mah?prabhu, the founder of Gaud?ya Vaisnavism,
>and Prak?s?nanda Sarasvat?, a leading ?sankarite sanny?s? of the time.
After
>hearing Prak?s?nanda's interpretation of Ved?nta-s?tra, Sr? Caitanya
>Mah?prabhu replied: ?The Veda is evident by itself. It is the crown-jewel
of
>all evidence. By interpreting it, the self-evident quality is lost.?
>[Caitanya-carit?m?ta, ?di-l?l?, 7.132] The original text, in medieval
>Bengali, is:
>  svatah-pram?na veda -- pram?ma-siromani, laksar? karile
>svatah-pram?nat?-h?ni.

>The quality of self-evidence mentioned above is especially apparent, in my
>view, in the Bhagavad-g?t?, which is part of the Mah?bh?rata. I have
>therefore selected five specific areas, vital to the Bhagavad-g?t?'s
>message, which are especially prone to misinterpretation, and I have
>attempted to demonstrate from the Bhagavad-g?t? itself the consistent, and
>self-evident view of the speaker, Lord sr? Krishna, especially as He
>describes Himself.
> The first topic is the G?t?'s strong montheism, in which the many gods of
>the Hindu pantheon are sharply relegated to the status of subordinate
>servitors to the Supreme Lord. The second topic is that of the separate
>individuality of Krishna as God, distinct from, and transcendental to, the
>individual entities, who are tiny expansions of the Lord. Third, I have
>shown that within the G?t?, Krishna is understood to be the supreme
>controller. The fourth subject is the delicate issue of monism. I believe
to
>have clearly shown that despite certain statements in the G?t? to the
effect
>that "Krishna is everything," there is nothing like a bald monistic
doctrine
>in the G?t?. Finally, in the fifth section, I have argued from the
>Bhagavad-g?t? itself that Krishna comes to this world in a spiritual,
>eternal form, and not a material body, such as those we inhabit.
> As mentioned above, these five topics ineluctably lead to a single
>conclusion: that the real and final topic of the Bhagavad-g?t? is Krishna
>Himself, who is inseparably related to, and yet eternally transcendental to
>the individual souls, of whom we are specimens. This doctrine of
>bhed?bheda-tattva, or the inconceivable, simultaneous difference and
>non-difference of the Lord and the individual souls, is Sr? Caitanya's
>reading of the Bhagavad-g?t?, and Vedic literature in general.
> I have included the topic that Krishna is the controller to drive home the
>point that the Godhead being talked about in the Bhagavad-g?t? is not a
>vague, wispy Deity, whose true ineffable status is but indirectly hinted at
>by the hierarchical language of mortals. Completely to the contrary, we
have
>in the G?t? a full-blown expression of an omnipotent, omniscient,
>omnibenevolent Supreme Lord, commanding, and even poignantly entreating,
the
>individual souls enmeshed in m?y? to return to Him in His divine abode.
> I call this paper a "Beginning Ontology" because the constraints of time
>and space have permitted only an introductory statement about the Godhead,
>as He is conceived in the Bhagavad-g?t?. In fact, the points made herein
are
>amplified by the rest of the Bhagavad-g?t?. At the very least, I hope this
>paper will stimulate the reader to investigate the G?t? as far as possible
>on its own terms. There are certainly esoteric passages in religious
>scriptures, including the Vedic books. But the guiding Vedic principle is
>that we should interpret that which is ambiguous, that which plainly calls
>for explication of hidden meanings. There are many such statements in the
>Sanskrit scriptures, but the fundamental message, the central theme is
>generally clear.
> The verses quoted here are all my own translations, unless otherwise
>indicated, and I have given great stress on literal accuracy in their
>rendering. I have endeavored to avoid, thereby, unfounded flights of poetic
>inspiration, and dubious constructions devised to legitimate tentative
>insights. My conclusions reflect what I have learned from the Bhagavad-g?t?
>As It Is, [The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Los Angeles, 1989]  whose
>translation and purports are the the unique devotional scholarship of His
>Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.
> The point of view here is clearly in the tradition of ?r?p?da Madhv?c?rya,
>?r?p?d R?m?nuj?c?rya, ?r? Caitanya Mah?prabhu, and other illustrious
>Vaisnava scholars, who opposed the monistic interpretation of sr?p?da
>?Sankar?c?rya, and those in his line. In a sense, one gets here a glimpse
of a millennial theological debate in action.
