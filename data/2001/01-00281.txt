about congresses and so on
Dearest Colleagues, I have a problem. In Italy, it is very difficult receive
information about congresses, symposia, conferences and so on; no sites in
the web pages of the  Italian Oriental Departments are really well informed
about this (obviously, I don't lay the blame upon my  dear and affectionate
Italian colleagues!). For example, the last year I have gone in Prague and
in Marburg only by means of a personal invitation; and, in April, I shall go
at the WSC in Delhi newly by a personal invitation from professor Vachaspati
Upadhyaya. In any case, I beg to all List members to inform all (if it is
not a problem or an annoyance) when  similar opportunities happen. Indology
is, in my mind, the most efficient online indianistic "meeting".
With the greatest gratitude,
Daniela Rossella
