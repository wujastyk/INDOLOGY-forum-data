[ADMIN] "Ven. Tantra" a group
Ven. Tantra has satisfied me that he is a single person posting under a
single identity.  He still equivocated somewhat about single identities,
but I believe he was trying to be philosophical, not literal.
I have asked him not to post to this list unless he has a specific
contribution on an indological subject he has studied seriously.  That
goes for everone, of course.
