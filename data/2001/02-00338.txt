dvija varNa
Raveen,
Responding to my remark:
you comment:
Quite true. It is in South-East Asia where they remain.
I doubt this. It seems much more likely that brahmins played some 
role in the capital cities and courts, at least down until the 
arrival of the Portuguese. Exactly as they do subsequently in 
South-East Asia. I agree that there is no evidence that their numbers 
were ever very large.
There is some truth in this. But are you not doing the very same 
thing when you refer to 'conservative, Buddhist clergy' and their 
daily discourses to the lay people ? Have they started to have daily 
discourses to the lay people. by the way ? What about the radical 
Buddhsit clergy ?
I would have thought that the problem is the human tendency to 
classify into 'them and us' and generate anger against the other. 
Just the sort of thing that the Buddha and many other Indian teachers 
opposed.
