Hobson-Jobson dictionary on the Web
Dear Ganesan,
A detailed list of dictionaries under consideration in the Digital
Dictionaries of South Asia project is available at
<http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/southasia/sa-dicts-list.pdf>.  Final
decisions on the precise dictionaries to be converted will be made this
month by the project's advisory board after they have reviewed comments
submitted last year by language teachers and linguists.
At the end of the project, two years from now, there will be at least one
language-to-English dictionary available for each of the South Asian
languages listed on the second URL you cited.  Additionally there will be a
Web version of at least one monolingual dictionary for each of the modern
languages taught most frequently in the U.S.
