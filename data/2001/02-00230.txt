A difficult Pali word
In the commentary to the Samyutta-nikaaya, the Saaratthappakaasinii:
(PTS Woodward 1932: 199.27-200.9 (XVI.11)), there occurs the word
tumbamatta, modifying paanaka.  The passage is stating that Sakyamuni
is picking up a robe discarded in a charnel ground, and the robe is
covered with creatures. But for the life of me I cannot understand
what tumbamatta might mean, unless tumba is taken as a unit of
measure, and the expression is intended to mean something like
"covered with creatures to the extent of a litre-bucket full" or
something like that.  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
Note that a better text found in the Dhammagiri-Paali-Ganthamaalaa
edition (Igatpuri: Vipassana research Institute, 1994): vol. 30, p.
175. The commentary is quoting Samyutta-nikaaya ii.221,15-17
(XVI.11.28).
