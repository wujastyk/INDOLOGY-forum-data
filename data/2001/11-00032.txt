I am preparing a critical edition with a little team of scholars in
Louvain-la-Neuve (cf. C. Vielle, "An Introduction to the JaiminIyasaMhitA
of the BrahmaNDapurANa", in M. Brockington ed., Stages and Transitions:
temporal and historical frameworks in epic and purANic literature.
Proceedings of the Second DICSEP, Zagreb, 2001, in press), in a speculative
portion (studied by Sandra Smets for a Ph.D) dealing with VedAnta

that portion, in the last, soteriological, chapter (51), which begins by
enumerating the qualities for mokSa.
