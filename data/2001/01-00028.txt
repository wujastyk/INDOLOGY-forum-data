Though popularly the herdsmen caste name "gvAla" in the
North India is derived from Skt. gopAla (for eg.
R. S. McGregor, Hindi-English dictionary, OUP),
gopAla > gvAla is a long stretch of imagination.
It is far easier and straight-forward to get gvAla from
Dravidian.

Like gvAla, jvAla(A), jvAr millet, dhvani - all will
plausibly have Dravidian roots.

jvAr (=skt. yavanAla) < jOLa, jonnelu, cOLa
and similarly yamuna < tamil to_lunai, pl. see
