URLs for a Hinduism course
Hello Colleagues,
     I am trying to find a good academically appropriate collection of URLs which would be helpful as a
source of information on Hinduism for undergraduate students.  Something that would cover from IE
background and Harappan Civilization to modern times.  Has anyone put together such a collection of
URLs?   Best,
                                               Madhav Deshpande
