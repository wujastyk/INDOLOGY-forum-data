All comments accepted, no questions asked :-) That was lot of fun.

Before I wind up my argument (or whatever is left of it, if any), I think
Prof Dmtri rightly guessed that vRttis in I.6 may be in the temporal order
in an act of perception. No idea if he was the first to hazard this
speculation. In my opinion the order is five fold sAma.. the poet in me
can't resist.. pramANo hiGkAro, viparyayaH prastAvaH.. I'll stop it there.
indra, bRhaspati and the whole gang will surely hang around any message
board where I.6 is posted (just IMO). Even chanting is not needed.

No more on this topic, it is a promise, LOL. We are talking different
languages..

Best regards
Bhadraiah
