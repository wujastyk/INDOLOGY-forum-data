Varuna were worshipped as 'Thinai' gods. Indra is a quintessentially vedic aryan

deities held sway
Vaiyapuri Pillai, without bringing in the words "sanskrtization" and
"brahminization" has brought in enough evidence to show that the change was not
that radical from Sangam to Pallavan times as suggested by Dr.Ganesan. Ganesan's
words like 'state sponsorship' gives an impresion a state on the model of model
western theories, while the social fact may only be powerful land owners .
