Studia Indoloczne (?)
I'm forwarding this bibliographic query to the listserv of CONSALD
(Committee on South Asian Libraries and Documentation -- which
consists of a few dozen of my colleagues who are South Asia
Librarians). I also tried searching a number of sources and could not
locate anything resembling this citation... I will be very interested
to see if someone can hunt it down, as no libraries in the appear to
have this journal (if this is, indeed, its name).
