Hindu holocaust site?
Changiz Khan and his Mongols, the non-Muslim Arabs were "pagans"
and by some stretch of the imagination could be termed "Hindus".
But terming Shiahs as Hindus ( Samar Abbas terms the Shia-Sunni
conflict as the second Hindu-Muslim war) really is something.
In doing so, Samar Abbas (unwittingly) points us to the
source of all this poison, war and killings over the centuries --
this tendency to divide the world into believer and kafir,
even within the people who believe in the same Prophet and Holy Book.
One practical implication of calling Shias Hindus is that Kashmir
is then a Hindu-majority state, and the legitimacy in Islam
of the Sunni-led jihad as a liberation struggle for Muslims ruled
by non-Muslims is completely undermined.  The Jihad can only be
justified as Muslims fighting to subdue the Kafirs (the good old
Dar-ul-Aman/ Dar-ul-Harb nonsense). Thus Samar Abbas has in one post,
completely confirmed the Hindutva fears.
