I would also be interested in knowing about the history.

It is said that the script come in use in 953 A. D., which
seems right since it is an early form of devanagari. The form
probably emereged in the Magadh region (Nalanda etc.).

There is a book "Ranjana Lipi Varnamala" published by the Newar
community (Lipu Thapu Guthi). I have some information on it if
someone is interested.

The Soyombo Alphabet invented in 1686 by the Mongolian monk
Zanabazar is based on Lantsa/Devanagari.
