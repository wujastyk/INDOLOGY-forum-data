Privately, one could. From the Koran, this person cannot denounce
any  other God/Goddess as Koran says all other Gods/Goddesses are
false  and  Allah is the only  true God. So if this Muslim person
denounces Allah, he/she ceases to become a Muslim immediately and
is labelled a Kafir or an infidel.

Similarly  condemning  the acts of  Taliban is fine personally as
individuals. But to say, 'this is against Islam', is saying, what
Mohammed  did  several centuries ago was wrong, & this would lead
them earning a fatwa.

Some  argue  that this  is  a  way  of  the Talibans  to  attract
attention  to the internal problems in their nation. This is like
keeping  on  connecting two  points on a  paper via several curvy
lines avoiding the shortest way - a simple straight line. Can one
then  deny  the straight line is  the only way to connect the two
points  ? No. Because these two points can be connected via 1000s
of curved lines.

To  keep repeating  Islam is a peaceful tolerant religion is just
ignoring  the  straight line between  two points and focussing on
the curvy lines. Whether this is deliberate or unintentional, is
left to those who say it.

Here is one observation ( of course this person is only saying
his views and not on behalf of all Muslims )

But what do we make of a concept of "Islamic democracy"? I agree;
Iran's system is corrupt and needs accountability and reform. But
"popular rule"? How Islamic is the concept? Often times, it seems
Khatami  is just  out to  take any  interesting Western  idea and
force its Islamization. One cannot take a few ideas from the West
and  ignore the  rest. The basic concept of democracy is, must we
be   reminded,   un-Islamic.  There  is  no  concept  of  popular
sovereignty. One may make an argument for popular accountability,
in  light of  the rule  of God,  but often  times, I  wonder what
"Islamic  democracy"  really means.  After  all,  does this  mean
political  parties? Advocating blatantly un-Islamic ideas such as
secularism?  Or  rather Islamic parties of different concerns and
orientations? I'd be interested in other people's opinions.

Right from the time, the Semitic religions came to this earth, we
have noticed the death and destruction of other civilizations. It
is just one more act of savagery to that list. And it is sad.
