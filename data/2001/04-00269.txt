SV: What next

I believe this is a problem related to the technicalities involved. If we
have a non-open list, it implies that only certain persons are allowed to
publish on the list. The nice thing about having outsiders turn directly to
the experts on the list, is that we get as many "editors" as there are
members of the list with "write" privilege. A list-member may decide to
answer an inquiry in private, or s/he may decide to pass the message on to
the rest of the list, whether it is a question or a comment. This gives us
the necessary filter to keep out nonsense.
As far as I can remember, the Indology list had a number of interesting
discussions before it was wrecked. Although insiders ask each other a
number of questions like the ones you mention (they are useful enough for
professionals), the list does not have to be exclusively tuned to this kind
of thing. I am a member of two other lists (both moderated) where all sorts
of debates and info are channelled through to the receivers. They show a
fine balance between scholarly debates and practical info seeking.
This sounds like an interesting alternative. But let us wait and see what
Dominik comes up with!
