I do not condemn colonialism or any other social structure unless it turns
unfair. Indians colonized many islands around the world and dominated. To
some extent they face the same music Britishers faced in India. Some social
structures like democracy offer better chance of equality and justice. Most
others turn unfair sooner or later.

I understand that technocracy is far removed from reality. But aristocracy
and technocracy are two sides of the same coin. When Elitism and Aristocracy
control all resources, the creative effort of society is stifled and the
intellect takes refuge in technocracy which is destined to be a failure.

The best guard against technocracy is to understand that social systems are
non-linear.

Isn't it how societies work? Everybody works for his or her own benefit or
immediate family, or country and world in that order? If nobody told these
people their duties and responsibilities who is to blame? When people who
occupy high places make claims about "sacrifices", what morals can we expect
from mortals?
