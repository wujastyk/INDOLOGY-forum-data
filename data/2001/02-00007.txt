Shankaracharya and Sikhism
There are informative exchanges between Professor Gupt and Professor Mann on
the relations between Shankara and Sikhism in the RISA list.
Are there any studies on the relationship between Shankara's system and
Sikhism?
Thanks in advance,
SM

Your basis for deciding on "Akaal Prukh" as Nanak's designation for the
divinity calls for some clerification.  I appreciate the fact that you
"only rely upon the originals and authentic translations (if at all
needed)," but sometimes we all miss important details. Are you aware that
more frequently used epithets in Nanak's writings relate to the divine
sovereignty and come from Arabic and Persian:  Sahib (137 times), Khasam
(78 times), Patishah (23 times), and that Akal Purakh appears only once in
his 350+ compositions? Happy reading of the Nanakbani.
