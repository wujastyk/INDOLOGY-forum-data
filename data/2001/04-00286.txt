I have already registered www.indology.org.uk (and co.uk) in my name.  At
the time I did that, the various other indology.* URLs were taken.  In
particular, someone called Sheshan in Madras has registered indology.net
and indology.org , both of which would be quite suitable for our
endeavours. (However, indology.org.uk is quite adequate for present
purposes.)  I tried to contact Sheshan without luck (no reply). Hist
