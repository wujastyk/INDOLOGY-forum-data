The etymology of "Kannada" is unclear. According to R.
Narasimhacharya in his _History of the Kannada Language_, it was H.
Gundert (of the famous Malayalam dictionary) who first suggested
kar-naa.du "the black country", and Caldwell apparently saw no better
explanation. But Narasimhacharya writes that "the Kannadigas themselves
are not likely to designate their language 'the black country
language'" (which I agree with, since most of the land is not black).
Others have suggested karu-naa.du "the elevated country".

N.'s own suggestion is that 'Kannada' derives from kammitu-naa.du,
"land of fragrance", analogous to the meanings of sweetness and
pleasantness given to 'Telugu' and 'Tamil', and referring to lotus
ponds and the sandalwood that grows in Karnataka. I think that N.'s
explanation does not look bad, esp. since there is also a word 'kammu'
meaning "fragrance" (with derivatives like kammida.l, 'a fragrant
woman', etc.), so the land could have been kam-naa.du, from which
'Kannada' as name of the language is derived. ('Kar.naa.ta' etc. look
very much like Sanskritisations.)
