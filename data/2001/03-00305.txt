Rebuilding Great Lord Buddha of Bamiyan
We have heard from our friends that you are maybe the
most distinguished assembly of scholars. We seek your
help.
We are Arya Buddha Association. One of our aims is to
rebuild the image of the Great Lord Buddha of Bamiyan,
one of our greatest heritage.
We have carefully monitored the news from reports and
personal information. We are sure that it is possible
and we are confident it will happen. Four images, one
in India, one in Srilanka and the original too will be
restored. We have news clips at our web-site.
They have demaged the original further, but a large
part of it still stands. You know that image not
completely of stone, but done in clay. We will try to
obtain som fragments of the original, if fate will
assist us. The so called demage is only a step to full
restoration.
Some of you have the capability to assist. Please
help.
We are too small to do anything ourselves.
