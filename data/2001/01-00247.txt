The general trend seems to be to hyphenate the individual sematic
units of Tibetan names -- at least that's what was being done in the
big Tib-Eng dictionary that is being produced at SOAS when I was
involved in it, with the root letter of the first syllable
capitalized..  Thus, for your examples (correcting the various
spelling errors) -- the second element aftrr the comma is the person's
title:

Basically OK but I have modified slightly as follows:

sNyan-ngag me-long-gi grel-pa dByangs-can ngag-gi-rol-mtsho:
a commentary on Dandin's Kavyadarsha.
author: bsTan-'dzin Chos-kyi-nyi-ma, Khams-sprul IV (1730-1779)
[Tashijong, 1969]

Can't help with the rest -- and I am also not sure what you mean by
the following since I am unfamilar with what you call WorldCat -- is
it something feline :)  If you want more info off-list, pls contact me
privately.
