Taliban, Darul Uloom Deoband and idols
Recent destruction of the Buddhas at Bamiyan has led many Islamic scholars
to state that such destruction is against Islam. Others have said that it is
consistent with Islam.
We must admire the Taliban for their honesty. They say what they believe,
and they practice what they say.
The Taliban leaders are not crazy. They are graduates of the theological
madarassas of Pakistan, all of them set up by graduates of the distinguished
Darul Uloom Deoband In India. The most influencial of them Darul Uloom
Haqqania was founded by the father of the current leader Maulana
Samiul-Haq's, Moulana Abdul Haq, himself a Deoband graduate.
Taliban do not have a policy of saying one thing for external consumption
and another for internal. They are respected for their steadfast adherence
to Islamic principles.
