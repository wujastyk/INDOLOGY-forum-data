Did you hear this?

It was just a gentle aside on IIT alumni, of whom I

You've omitted the next line of the doggerel: Ani to
bhi bhool jAni ("even if I get it I'm bound to forget
it"), a telling comment on the perceived
inapplicability/uselessness of Sanskrit.
Surely this is somewhat hieratic? To be introduced in
the curriculum, why should modern Indian languages
need any kind of precedent? Isn't it enough that these
languages are mother tongues of students?
Thanks and Warm Regards,
