It was just a gentle aside on IIT alumni, of whom I
know a few on this list, representing a wide spectrum
ranging from Sanskrit to Tamil, Hindi etc :-))

You've omitted the next line of the doggerel: Ani to

inapplicability/uselessness of Sanskrit.

Surely this is somewhat hieratic? To be introduced in
the curriculum, why should modern Indian languages
need any kind of precedent? Isn't it enough that these
languages are mother tongues of students?

Thanks and Warm Regards,
