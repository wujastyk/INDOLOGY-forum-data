Gonda has an article on pUjA, but I forget where
I have the reference. He has an article called
"mantra" which details I have.

Try checking in B?hnemann, Gudrun.
 P?uj?a : a study in Sm?arta ritual, Vienna, '88
Also,  Huyler, Stephen P.,
Meeting God : elements of Hindu devotion
Yale University Press, c1999.

Good luck,
SM
