An ironical stanza in the Aaryaa metre beginning with the words
kavir anuharati cchaayaa.m is found in the modern collection
Subhaa.sita-ratna-bhaa.n.d.aagaara edited by Naaraaya.n Raam
Aachaarya, 8th edition, Bombay: Nirnaya Sagar Press, 1952, p.
37, stanza no. 12 (unfortunately without giving the source):

kavir anuharati cchaayaa.m
        padam eka.m paadam ekam ardha.m vaa |
sakalaprabandhahartre
        saahasakartre namas tasmai ||
"A poet imitates the idea ("shadow"), [viz.,] one word, one line,
or one half.
Obeissance [however,] to this thief of a whole literary work, the
doer of a criminal act!"

With best regards,
Roland Steiner
