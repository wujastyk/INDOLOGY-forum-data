Not even all the Muslims in Karnataka: in the coastal region they speak
a variety of Malayalam.
(I merely wished to point out that the stereotype of Urdu as a 'Muslim
language', and that 'all Muslims speak Urdu, also when it is not
locally rooted' is mistaken - I had the impression, itself perhaps
mistaken, that this was still being believed here.)
On another note: we should not forget the Karnatakan contribution to
the development of Urdu (i.e., the Dakkani form) in the Bijapur-Gulbarga
area, where it was cultivated at royal courts before it became
fashionable to do so in the north.
