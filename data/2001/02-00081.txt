Dear Mr Jain

Several of us list members were puzzled by an item on p. 9 of the January
2001 MLBD newsletter.  A description of an exhibition of the "secret
collection" of the National Archaeological Museum, Naples, is captioned
"Vedic Sculpture in Ancient Italy".

Since the material in this collection is predominantly Roman, we wondered
how the misunderstanding arose.  We wondered whether someone had seen the
description of "sexual activity involving gods and goddesses, satyrs,
nymphs and pygmies" and jumped to the conclusion that it must be Indian!
But this still does not explain why it was called "Vedic".

Yours sincerely
