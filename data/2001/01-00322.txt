Vanbakkam Vijayaraghavan <vijay at VOSSNET.CO.UK> has written as follows:
>In India, if Establishment is to be rejected, then students will demand
>sanskrit since the "secular"  Establishment in India is very anti-sanskrit.
>Any idea of sanskrit  evokes images of molten lead down the ears a la Manu

This is your imagination.
I have no evidence to accept that Indian "establishment" is anti-sanskrit.
If anything, it is either pro-British English or pro-native languages.

Have a peaceful and joyous day.
