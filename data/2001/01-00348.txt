Vedic sculpture in Naples?
The MLBD Newsletter for Jan 2001 contains the following amusing and
extraordinary report:
Vedic Sculpture in Ancient Italy
The National Archaeological Museum in Naples is to open its "secret
collection" of frescoes, mosaics and statues to the public next month.
The 250 exhibits depict sexual activity involving gods and goddesses,
satyrs, nymphs, and pygmies. ...
The presuppositions and misunderstandings in this report and its title are
so profound that one is left in stunned speechlessness.
(This is not meant as a criticism of the Newsletter as a whole, which is
obviously a useful publication.)
