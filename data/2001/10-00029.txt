Dear colleagues,
        could anybody give me (or make a reference to) any recent/latest
biographical data on Professor R.N.Dandekar? I have to update my foreword to
a volume of his selected works translated into Russian ten years ago.
Have not heard much about him since then.
Many thanks in advance,
                                                Ya.V.
