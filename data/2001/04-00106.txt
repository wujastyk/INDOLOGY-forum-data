Idiom, and, Grammar, (and, chariots, again!)
Subrahmanya writes:
Totally ridiculous. 6.75 is an *explicit* hymn to war weaponry. 6.75.7
gives vivid images of enemies being trampled by the chariot horses. (Bad
traffic problems in Rgveda Land?) 6.75.8, where we find the ratha-vaahana,
6.75.9, and other verses following contain repeated references to weapons
and to images of war. What we find there is hardly any "generic wheeled
contraption."
NB that the words "fast two wheeled indo-european chariot" masquerading as
a quotation in Subrahmanya's post are *not* my words. Subrahmanya can
apparently attribute made-up words to me as easily as he can imagine a
"generic wheeled contraption[s]" in one of the most famous war hymns in the
whole of the RV.
