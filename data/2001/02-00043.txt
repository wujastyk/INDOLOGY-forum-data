viRaliyar (Musicians in the Near East)
Oxford encyclopaedia of Archaeology in the Near East
describes that often times female musicians are portrayed
naked in the ancient Near East, while they have some head
ornaments and wigs.

In Tamil sangam poetry, the viRaliyar, the female minstresses
are often described in erotic terms, and they are said to be
scantily clad.

                                          - puRa. 89:1-2
All this leads an early translator of pattuppATTu to write:
"The songstress seems to have been quite naked, as otherwise
her whole body could not have been described."
