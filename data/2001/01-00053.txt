I'm terribly sorry to be a critic, and I hope I can avoid the lable
of one who uses this list for intemperate personal comments, but:

For heaven's sake, doesn't anybody take the trouble to use reference
books and do any research anymore before crying to the list for BASIC
information?!

There is really quite alot reliably known about Kumarajiva, easily
accessible to anyone who should qualify as a member of this list,
that is, bona fida scholars.

Let's avoid this list being a replacement for Introduction to Asian
Cultures 101, please.

Much has been published even long ago by Johannes Noble, Zenryu
Tsukamoto and many others, not to mention works in Japanese...not to
mention that one can learn alot about Tocharian from any encylopedia,
for instance!

good gracious, what a way to start a new year :-(
