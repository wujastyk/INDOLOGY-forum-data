Idiom, and, Grammar, (and, chariots, again!)
How does - trampling by horses -  give any information about the
kind of chariot ?
Isnt the chariot the point of our discussion ?
My question remains - any wheeled vehicle could have been used
how does one draw any more conclusions ?
Let us get back to the issue -
I have already given you a quotation from Sparreboom which indicates
that there were many kinds of wheeled vehicles already existing
in IVC before the coming of the Aryans.
I am assuming that you think that the two-wheeled fast chariot
was brought in by the incoming Aryans and that is the kind
of chariot mentioned in 6.75
If so, my question to you is - how do you know what kind of vehicle is being
used in 6.75 ?
If you think that is not the case that is fine too - but
please give me an example in the RV where one can identify a
kind of chariot that has been brought in by the Aryans as opposed to a
indigenous wheeled vehicle of the IVC people.
Also, I will also greatly appreciate your response to Dr.Kochhar's
questions.
Thank you.
