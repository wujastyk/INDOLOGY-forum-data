New interpretation of Yoga Suutra
One quick question please.
I.3 tadAdraSTuHsvarUpe~vasthAnaM which was split as
tadA draSTuHsvarUpe avasthAnaM
I like to split it as
tadA adraSTuHsvarUpe avasthAnaM
As everything perceived is a transformation (of what is already known such
as agni or vAc), one has to transcend what is perceived; because what is not
perceived alone is what stands apart.
In many cases (such as above), even a chanting of the sUtra can locate a
possible error. "draSTuHsvarUpe" seems to contain some apazruti, as it needs
too much labor on a weaker ground. "adraSTuHsvarUpe" sounds perfect.
Or did I misread the whole thing?
