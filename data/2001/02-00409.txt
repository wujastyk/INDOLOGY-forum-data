Vedic tone notation, how ancient?
For details see my old paper :
On some unknown systems of marking the Vedic accents. Vishvabandhu
Commemoration Volume = Vishveshvaranand  Indological Journal  12,  1974,
472-508
(with many misprints, comme d'habitude).
Oldest MS known: Vajaseneyi Samhita of Sukla Yajurveda but accents of
*older* Maitrayani Samhita style,  c. 1200 CE (palaeography), from N.India,
see front cover of:
M. Witzel (ed.) Inside the texts, Beyond the Texts. New Approaches to the
Study of the Vedas. (Harvard Oriental Series, Opera Minora 2).  Cambridge
1997
Otherwise, 1428 CE in Nepal, for details see above paper. Nothing to be
added since then.
there are some wrong leads only.
