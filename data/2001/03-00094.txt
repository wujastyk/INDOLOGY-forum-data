SV: An article mentionig Indologists
Lars Martin Fosse writes, of the recent article by N.S. Rajaram
in the _Organizer_ (the RSS propaganda sheet), found at http://www.organiser.org/21jan2001/cover2.htm:
It reminds me of a story of Lyndon Johnson's told in the Pentagon
papers. After winning a hand on a bluff, the losers ask the poker
player what cards he had in his hand. He answers reluctantly,
"Aces." The inevitable question pops up: "How many aces?" Answer:
"One aces."
In this case, Witzel had "one cohorts."
Cheers,
Steve
