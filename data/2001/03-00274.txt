passion    objectivity
Dear Indology Members:
in reference to Lynken Ghose  and the responses to:
Cannot the question be answered with the difference between dhAranA and
dhyAna?
I interpret dhArana as the application of an idea or concept onto an object
of the mind or labeling it, DhyAna is the reverse, with the object
projecting back its own nature.   Bhadraiah's question of mathematics being
a good example.
This site seems to be a good example of the exchange of nAma or ideas and
concepts. I question however, the acceptance of dhyAna. This seems ironic
since India seemed to introduce this practice to the world.
I have a suspicion that members of this groups reject the metaphysical
nature of dhyAna because of the discipline of academia which requires the
labeling of events or objects of the mind.
Does not true scholarship require the mastery of DhArAna first, but then the
search for DhyAna as a particular field is chosen?  The results of dhyAna
can then be subject to normal academic review that then separates it from
pure belief.
regards,
Bob Peck
