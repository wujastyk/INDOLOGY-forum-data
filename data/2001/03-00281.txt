doha by rahim
Actually, the text does meet the 13, 11 matra requirement of the Doha
genre.
Doha: The Doha is a rhyming couplet, each of the two lines containing 24
matras. Each line is further divided into two feet. The first and the
third feet of a hoda have 13 matras each and the second the fourth feet
contain 11 matras each.
