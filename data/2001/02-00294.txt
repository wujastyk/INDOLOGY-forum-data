Friends,

it appears from a catalogue that a new edition of Mayrhofer's Etymological
Dictionary is being published.

1. Is it significantly different from the previous one?
2. How much of it appeared yet? (According to the catalogue, vols. 1-2 and
fasc. 1-3 of vol 3 [1998], but it does not say which letters of the alphabet
have been covered.)

Thanks for any info,
Ferenc
