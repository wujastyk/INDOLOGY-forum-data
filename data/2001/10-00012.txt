the role of colonies for British governance
Dear Birgit,
You might try signing on to H-Asia, which is for history (in the
widest sense, including current history and political science), and
posting this question there as well.  I vaguely recall that there are
some who think the pageantry the British adopted in India from the
Mughals heavily influenced royal pageantry at home.  This would be a
parallel case.  However that may be, you can find out how to get onto
H-Asia from its website http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~asia/
