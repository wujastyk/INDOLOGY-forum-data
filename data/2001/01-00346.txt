Epics on CD
Dear Listmembers,
after being offline for some time I would like to obtain information
about wether these texts are available on CD in the US:
mahAbhArata 
rAmAyaNa 
zakuntalA
Texts should be in Sanskrit and english translation plus a search
function. If possible let me know vendors and prices.
Any help is mostly appreciated.
Regards
Tobias Grote-Beverborg
