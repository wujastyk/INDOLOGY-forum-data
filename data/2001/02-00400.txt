'Aasti' ?

Naasti as in naastika negates asti (a verb: '[there] is'), not aasti. Aasti
(as found in the text under discussion: the Dhruvanaa.dii) is a noun.

Not, I think, in the present context. The idiom of the text is highly
stereotyped, and -muulaat is used very frequently, always in the sense of
'by means of, on account of' -- e.g., vyaapaaramuulaat 'by means of
business', vivaahamuulaat 'on account of marriage', etc.
