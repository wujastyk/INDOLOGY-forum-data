                         ABSTRACT OF THE PAPER

* The Realm of the Divine: Three MaNDalas from the NiSpannayogAvalI * by
Terence M. Hays

The NiSpannayogAvalI was written by AbhayAkaragupta, a Buddhist monk who
lived in the 11th-12th century, and contains the descriptions of a
number of Tantric maNDalas. The paper, after offering a brief overview
of the historical setting of AbhayAkaragupta and his work, gives the
translation, based on Sanskrit texts and their Tibetan Peking edition,
of the depiction of three maNDalas, the "Five Guardian  maNDala" the
"NairAtmA maNDala", and the "Sambara maNDala".

the world. Infringements to the law -- as it happened to the JSAWS --
will be pursued legally.
