Bhaagavata-puraa.na commentary MS
This is a complete stab in the dark, but bear in mind that Vopadeva got
himself involved with the BhP, writing a sort of index to it, as well as a
precis called Muktaaphala.  Sometimes MSS that look like the BhP turn out
to be his work.  He was a very popular author, and manuscripts of his
works crop up quite often.
Best,
Dominik
