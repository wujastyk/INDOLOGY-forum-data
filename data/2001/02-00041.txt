Those interested in these and similar speculations might enjoy reading an
article by Gordon Whittaker in GOETTINGER BEITRAEGE ZUR SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT,
Heft 1, Goettingen 1998, entitled "Traces of an Early Indo-European
Language in Southern Mesopotamia". Whittaker attempts to show that the
Sumerians were preceded by an IE people in the area. He connects Sumerian
UMBIN, "wheel", with Sanscrit nabhi-, "navel", and OHG naba-, "wheel hub",
and Sumerian GIGIR(A), "chariot, wagon", with PIE *kwekwlo- and Skt.
cakra-. Some other parallels are:

AB, "sea", Skt. ap-
TEMEN, "foundation, cornerstone", Skt. dha:man-
DIRIG, "glide away", Skt. dhrajati
MAH(A), "great, grand", Skt. maha-
PA(TE), "lord, ruler", Skt. pati-

A similar attempt has been made by Douglas R. Frayne in "Indo-Europeans and
Sumerians: Evidence for their Linguistic Contacts" in BCSMS, 25, 1993.
Frayne relates Sum. TEMEN to Greek temenos and GIGIR to *kwekwlo- and
cakra-.
