I doubt this is what this student is looking for, but it might interest
him/her.  A few years ago, Susan Herring, a linguistics student at Berkeley,
did a first-rate PhD dissertation on the use of the historical FUTURE in
Tamil.  Strangely, in modern Tamil, it is quite common to describe events
that one is narrating  using the future tense.  It even spills over into
Tamil English -- I often hear people saying (when they describe the action
in a movie), "And then he will come into the room, and then he will see
her...."  And on and on using the future.  It's an interesting quirk, and
Susan has written on it extensively.  I've never noticed anything like that
in Sanskrit.  And I don't know about other Dravidian (or Indo-Aryan)
languages.  I've always thought it had something to do with the development
of the verb system from old Tamil to modern Tamil, but unfortunately no one
(to my knowledge) has figured out just how it might have come about.  George
