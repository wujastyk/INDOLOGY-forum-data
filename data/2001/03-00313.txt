Thanks! (+ message for Dominik)
I would like to thank Samar Abbas, Mahadevan, Birgit Kellner, and
Venkatraman Iyer for their information on Indian IT. All info has been very
useful.
Special message for Dominik: Sorry for writing those long mails. I'll try
to curb my communicative urges better in the future.
