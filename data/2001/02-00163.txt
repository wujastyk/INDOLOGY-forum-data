Mystics and Missionaries
    The recent flurry of exchanges between Aditya Mishra and Stephen Hodge
points to a deeper issue that I think warrants further discussion--the
varying ways and patterns in which mysticism is connected with organized
religion. Mystics affiliated with a given religion, for instance, may be
recruited to attract newcomers and to "soften up" their initial resistance.
Missionaries then take over and complete the job of formal conversion.
