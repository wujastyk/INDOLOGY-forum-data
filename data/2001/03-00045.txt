Bamiyan & Ayodhya
 Various reasons have been given for the motive behind Taleban's actions,
ranging from UN sanctions, Quran, etc. Taleban are not the type to engage
in double-speak. They themselves have clearly stated the reasons for their
actions :
   "A Taleban spokesman in the United States, Sayed
    Rahmatullah Hashmi, told the BBC the statues were being
    destroyed to retaliate for the 1992 demolition of the ancient
    mosque at Ayodhya in India by Hindu activists."

Without no Ayodhya solution, no Bamian solution.

 Sanghis have no moral right to criticise the Taleban - look at what they
did in Ayodhya, Bangalore, etc. While reprehensible to European humanists,
Talebanis are just reacting to what Sanghis did to Babri Masjid in 1992,
in the only language Sanghis understand. Indologists should understand
this.
 Instead, Sanghis are probably happy that at least some people are buying
their theory of "Buddhists are Hindus". But before the Sanghis break out
in jubilation at the destruction of "anti-Vaidik" Buddhist art, many Hindu
idols are also being smashed too :
  "There are also a number of Hindu shrines in Bakhtiar province "

Sanghis smash mosques - Talebanis smash temples. Sanghi Indian PM Vajpayee
justifies Ayodhya - Talibani Afghan PM Omar justifies Bamiyan. Action
followed by reaction. Who is right, who is wrong?
