Text layers in the Gita
"Otherwise I would ask him how it is possible that a supposedly unitary text
- the GItA - just after its culmination point, i.e. after the inspired
theistic hymn and the magnificent poetic vision of VizvarUpa in Chapter 12,
suddenly turns to rather dull JnAna-oriented, SAMkyaic speculations and
classifications...."
Because the author was not looking for a Pulitzer Prize, was not out
to create a work of literature ?
Is it only "devotees" who come to the Gita with preconceptions of what
it should be ?
