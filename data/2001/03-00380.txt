Subject: Text layers in the Gita
Message-ID: <161227068732.23782.1765933210704843025.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

"Otherwise I would ask him how it is possible that a supposedly unitary text
- the GItA - just after its culmination point, i.e. after the inspired
theistic hymn and the magnificent poetic vision of VizvarUpa in Chapter 12,
suddenly turns to rather dull JnAna-oriented, SAMkyaic speculations and
classifications...."

Because the author was not looking for a Pulitzer Prize, was not out
to create a work of literature ?

Is it only "devotees" who come to the Gita with preconceptions of what
it should be ?
