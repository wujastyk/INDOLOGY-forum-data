I am afraid that this kind of policy is considerably older than the US
special forces (who may not even care much for it, for all I know). The
Christian Church certainly liked to destroy pagan shrines and build
churches in the same place, this happened in a number of places here in
Norway, for instance, during the introduction of Christianity. Muslims have
been doing this in India for centuries as we all know (although perhaps not
quite so often as assumed in some quarters). One of the problems with Truth
is that people who think they have found it, often get intolerably
intolerant. But then of course, the opposite too has its negative
aspects....
