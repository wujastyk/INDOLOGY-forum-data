Some questions on Asuras

There aren't many places you could *look* for such evidence
outside the Vedas and Gathas, Gunthard. And that evidence does
exist in both sets of texts -- in the case of the Vedas, even
more clearly in post-RV works than in the RV's late strata.
You really don't need to imagine massive cultural clashes to
explain this conflict. Priestly rivalries alone could get the job
done. Similar bifurcations showed up in numerous other premodern
traditions without reflecting any massive cultural clashes,
although they often involved some sort of geographical division.
Think here of the priestly/doctrinal battles in ancient Egypt, of
warrior Buddhist monks in Japan, or of the doctrinal battles
marking the history of any Eurasian scholastic tradition.
It is a fact that the trajectories of premodern traditions
regularly diverged -- often as the result of some minor and not
major historical event. Once a minor doctrinal divergence was
encoded in a religious canon, path dependencies helped ensure its
continuation. I suspect that in the case of the
Late-RV/Old-Avestan split we have an early example of this
phenomenon. Somewhat later conflicts of this sort in India can,
of course, be seen in the battles between different Vedic
branches or in the conflicts accompanying the emergence of
Jainism and Buddhism. Despite the fuller documentation we have in
these cases, we still don't understand the deep grounds of these
conflicts fully. Nor could anyone easily claim that they were
results of some major cultural clash.
So perhaps you don't need earthquakes to explain most of the
potholes in history.
My best,
