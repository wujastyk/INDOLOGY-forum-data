"Saantideva's literary ability
Dear All,
I am cross posting this request to both Indology and H-Buddhism. To
those who receive it twice my apologies.
I am trying to track down secondary literature on what seems to be a
form of literary affectation at the start of "Saantideva's
Bodhicaryaavataara and "Sik.saasamuccaya.
At BCA I:2ab (Minayeff's ed.) and "SS p. 1 ln. 11 (Bendall's ed.) a
similar half verse occurs :
 na hi ki.mcid apuurvam atra vaacya.m na ca
  sa.mgranthanakau"sala.m mamaasti | (Minayeff)
Surely such an opening is formulaic? Do readers know of any secondary
literature -- Indological or Buddhological -- on this subject?
Thank you in advance for any help you can give.
Many regards,
 Richard Mahoney
