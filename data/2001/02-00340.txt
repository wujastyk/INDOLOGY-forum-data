Mr. Murasoli Maran, Union Minister for Industry and Commerce, who presided
wanted the TVU to concentrate on promoting
 modern, scientific Tamil. ``Please leave the ancient texts and hard grammar to
scholars and concentrate on aspects such as short
 term courses for tourists and visitors.''
 I guess the Industry minister, (himself CEO of big businesses as well)
wants (old) Tamil to be nurtured by foreigners. Like Sanskrit, i guess.
