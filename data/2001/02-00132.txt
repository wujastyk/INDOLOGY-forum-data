Subject: sabk-e-hindi/urdu poetry
Message-ID: <161227067189.23782.13797171955024277263.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am looking for information on the local Indian influence in
sabk-e-hindi/early Urdu poetry. It seems from my research on "Mirza Rafi
Sauda" that the "highly persianised character" that is often taken as a
standard for early Urdu poetry (with Persian poetry as its ancestor) might
need some modification. The local Indian themes in Sauda's qasida are
manifold : Hindu ceremonies and festivals, Braj-styled figures of speech,
etc...
I want to continue research on this theme in earlier sabk-e-hindi literature
in order to look and redefine Indian influence on Persian literature (also
outside the Indian subcontinent). Any information would be most welcome, as
I haven't been able to contact any scholars working on this particular
theme.
