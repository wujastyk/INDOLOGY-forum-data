Dear Dan,

LC has practically all of it frequently in multiple editions, and a
year or so ago bought what is hopefully  all of it in the IDC
microform editions.

Alternatively, you can look at FirstSearch limiting the search to
WorldCat, which is a version of OCLC, the gigantic online union
catalog which supports among other things the interlibrary loan
system.

I would also expect the Research Triangle universities would have
most of this.  Contact Avinash Maheshwary the South Asia Bibliographer
at Duke <avinash.maheshwary at duke.edu>.

Good luck,

Allen

Fellow Indologists,

In trying to locate the library availability in the U.S. of the
colonial
Indian gazeteers, I have tried both major U.S. library search
engines, First
Search and Eureka, with little success.  Can anyone point me in the
right
direction?

Thanks.

Dan White
