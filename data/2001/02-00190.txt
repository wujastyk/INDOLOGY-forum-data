dvija varNa
Lynken Ghose comments:
The most numerous single var.na of those whose var.na identified is
the brahmin, but we are not told the origins of many disciples.
Obviously, those of whom nothing is said are more likely to be of a
lower class.
More to the point, this is all data from eight or nine hundred years
later. To analyse it as 'scientific' information is absurd. Probably
some of the information about well-known figures is correct, but as a
whole it is likely to be part of the natural evolution of traditions.
It cannot be used to reconstruct the social composition of early
Buddhism.
As regards Buddhas, of course, the claim that some were brahmins and
some khattiyas is derived from the Mahaapadaana-suttanta (D II 2f.).
