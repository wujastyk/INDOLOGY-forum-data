[ADMIN]  Closing INDOLOGY
Many fixes have been proposed, some involving one or more moderators; if
nothing else, I would like to see at least Ferenc Ruzsa's suggestion - -
"a closed list for serious scholars, but open for everyone to read" - -
given a try.  I belong to a similar list, which works quite well.  In
any case, I echo all the expressions of thanks to Dominik that have
filled the list these last couple days!
