the role of colonies for British governance
Dear Birgit,
there must be some more special written about this, but in any case
Moorhouse in his book India Britannica emphasizes the role of the I.C.S.
as a sort of new creation later used as a model elsewhere, too.
According to Moorhouse the very word "civil servant" was coined in
British India.
All the best
