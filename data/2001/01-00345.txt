My impression is rather that India got colonized because of a breakdown of
the Indian state system, in other words for a combination of political and
military reasons. The Indian princes and kings that fought the British had
the same kind of technology, taught them by the ubiquitous "military
advisers" who flourished then the way they do now. The British finally

evolves according to basic natural laws, but apart from that I can't see
anything preconceived about it.

I agree with that, ideally speaking. But mostly, as far as I can see,
engineers, doctors, and businessmen go for the latest, whether it is needed
or not. The latest and most sophisticated simply has the highest prestige.
