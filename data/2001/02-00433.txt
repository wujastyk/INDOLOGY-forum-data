Islam and Idols (Re: Plight of Buddhist art)
Rustam Masalewala <masalewala at HOTMAIL.COM> has written as follows:
Do you consider a mosque as idol too or not?
What about the black stone in Kaaba?
I understand it was used an idol even before Mohammad's time.
Is this  your prophecy  or desire?
Yours sincerely,
Aditya Mishra
