Query
Dear Indologists,
I am not an Indologist and have a query that I am sure you would be able to
help me with. Recently, a colleague of mine who works on early Renaissance
Spain told me that through Spain the Panchatantra and one other Indian epic
(which he could not remember) made their way into European folklore. I would
be grateful if anyone could provide me with guidance about this.
Regards
Rohit
