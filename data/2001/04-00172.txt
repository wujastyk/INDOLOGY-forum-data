It does, if in, say, a biography. But in an exchange like
"oruttar unnai tETi vantAr", "avar pArka eppiTi ituntAr?"
it seems that `iruntAr' is acceptable.

With these types of examples, it is clear that the `normal' form
is in fact usual and the variant forms are `affective'. But, as
you point out above, with certain situations,
the verbal forms are not interchangable, at least in modern Tamil.
My questions if the same is true for Sangam Tamil and Medieval Tamil.
