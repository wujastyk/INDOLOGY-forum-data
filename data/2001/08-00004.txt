query: jodi.mga
The Maanak Hindii Koza of Ramchandra Varma, vol. 2, cites both jo.ti.mga
"shiva" and jho.ti.mga "one who has long hair".  Combined with the
occurrence of jho.ti.mga in Marathi, these words seem to be widely used in
Indo-Aryan vernaculars. These words seem to be related to jodi.mga/joti.mga
and its variant kaapaalika.  The Kaapaalikas were indeed feared and had a
ghost-like appearance in the eyes of the common people.
