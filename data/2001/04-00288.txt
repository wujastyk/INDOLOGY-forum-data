I would very much regret the loss of INDOLOGY. I can think of
only one other list where I might receive such useful replies to
`dry' bibliographical questions. Isolated as I am such help is
invaluable. And this is only one small aspect of INDOLOGY.

Yet for all its strengths, the management of INDOLOGY in its
present form is clearly attended with difficulties which must
make the task less than pleasant. Dominik has shown far more
patience than I could ever hope to muster.

I would welcome the continuation of the list, although in a
slightly different form. Perhaps progress could be made by
increasing the number of those who administer the list and
reducing the number of those who could subscribe?

Whatever is decided, I do think that something may be learned
from the way that H-Net addresses many of these issues. A good
number of academic forums already exist. It is also possible to
establish new forums. Information on H-Net can be found at:

 http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/lists/

 http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/lists/application.cgi

It seems to me that the criteria outlined in the application
questionnaire could find favour with many of the present
subscribers to INDOLOGY.

I hope all this is useful.

Many regards,

 Richard Mahoney
