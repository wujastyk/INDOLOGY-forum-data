The answer to that question may be expected to have a bearing on the
etymology of Skt. vid > veda.
It is also worth drawing attention to similarity of  pairs of Skt. and
Drav. roots related to vision, winking, protection and knowledge:
Skt. miS                 Dr. vizi/mizi
Skt. mIL                 Dr. vizi/miz/miL
Skt. dRz                 Dr. teri
Skt. pA (stem pAl)       Dr. pAr
Skt. kSaN                Dr. kaN
Skt. kaN                 Dr. kaN
                         Dr. kA (to watch, protect)
There is a systematic extension of the roots in both groups
from vision to protection and knowledge.
For example
vizi
otl vizi vizi 02 1. eye; 2. eye-ball; 3. knowledge; wisdom
vizi-ttal
otl vizi-ttal vizi-ttal 01 1. to open the eyes; 2. to wake from sleep; 3.
to watch; to be vigilant; to be wide awake; 4. to look at attentively; 5.
to gaze, stare; 6. to shine; 7. to be clear; 8. to be alive
teri-tal
otl teri-tal teri-tal 01 1. to be seen, perceived, ascertained by the
senses or mind; to become evident;2. to be understood, intelligible, clear;
3. to possess the power of sight; 4. to be conscious, as of one's guilt; 1.
to investigate, test, ascertain, enquire; 2. to know, understand; 3. to
select, choose; 4. to learn through lstening; 5. to sift
Has the Skt. root vid "to know" has lost its original physiological sense
of "to see"?
