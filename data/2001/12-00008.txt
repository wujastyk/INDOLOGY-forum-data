use of historical present in Sanskrit
Hi Madhav!
I guess we may meet in March at Stanford and I look forward to it.
As regards the Classics student at Michigan - I am sure (s)he knows
Kurylowicz. I believe (without checking) that there may also be something
to be found in some of the earlier monographs of Jan Gonda.
I in turn am interested to learn where we find that Greeks looked upon
Persians as feminine.
best wishes,
Frits
