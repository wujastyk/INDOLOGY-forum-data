INDOLOGY Digest - 7 Feb 2001 to 8 Feb 2001 (#2001-40)
Hello Dmitri and List members,
[I'm afraid this may not be going anywhere.]
The reason why I asked was that I know that everyone except you think
it's draSTR.  YBh (and VAcaspati and Shankara (whoever this Sankara
may be)), Bhoja, BhAvagaNeCa, Nogoji BhaTTa, RAmAnandayati,
Anantadeva, SadACivendra SarasvatI all think it's masculine genitive
singular.  (Don't ask me who they are.)
It was more like the last blow :-) Well, to be honest, not really.
The real last blow came at 1.7.  You totally missed very simple
dvandva compound.
[I'm going to remove rather harsh comment below.]
