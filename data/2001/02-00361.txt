NG>In Indonesia, the word for moon is tiGkaL (a Drav. word
NG>in tamil, kannada; A. C. Burnell, vamza-brAhmaNa). There was a
NG>large syncretism between Mahayana Buddhism and Saivism in SE Asia
NG>happening for centuries.

Dr. L. Cousins:
<<
I don't know whether syncretism is the right word, but certainly
there is some measure of this at times. But this was certainly
present in Ceylon also, if not on the same scale. Everywhere local
religious traditions are also very important, as indeed in the Tamil
country.
