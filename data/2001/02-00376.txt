Dear members,

In response to private communications: I did not wish to deny the message of
early religious writers since I believe that in general they speak very
accurately.

To generalize: Early (religious sic) writings speak of two classes of
people, the sleep walkers and the awakened. They teach of how the awakened
state can be reached. The method appears to be universal concerning a power
within the self that can be stimulated or controlled. For instance, soma of
the RV or quickening of the Judaic/Christians.

Later institutional leaders who were not awakened could not understand soma
or quickening and had to translate writings as related to remote
supernatural powers which became the basis for priesthood and religion. The
original teachers therefore had to become god like.

In assuming that the early writers knew what they were saying, and ignoring
the later commentaries or later accepted meanings of words, very worthwhile,
applicable and universal teachings can be obtained. (Note, the referenced 5
?M?s of tantra can be seen as describing the world of the awakened and not a
drunken sexual orgy as commonly interpreted)
Regards,
Bob Peck
