Also in premodern times, right back into Vedic times, we have names with
Daasa referring to Brahmins.  One example is that of the Vedic expert
Pratardana.h Daivodaasi.h referred to in Zaa.mkhaayana Braahma.na (26.5),
the son of Devadaasa, a Brahmin who raises important questions regarding
sacrificial details.  So I would not take the prescriptive statements cited
by Apte too seriously.  Best,


Madhav
