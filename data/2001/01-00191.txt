Question
I found a reference to a 25 page publication,
Suutraantaraparigrahavicaara, by Vaasudeva Zaastrii Abhyankara dated to
sometime around 1922.  Has anyone seen this publication?  Would like to
have a photocopy of it, if anyone has access to it.  The booklet deals
with the debate over the question of which ritual Suutra should be
followed by participants in a sacrifice.  There was a major fight in Pune
in 1922 among the Rigvedi and Yajurvedi brahmins over this issue, and this
booklet attempts to resolve this issue in its own way.  Thanks for
assistance.
