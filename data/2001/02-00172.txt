he says of Lorna's work on kandyan kings
"The first edition was a University of London doctoral dissertation by
L.S. Dewaraja, it was entitled A Study of the Political,
Administrative and Social Structure of the Kandyan Kingdom of.Ceylon,
1707-176a The Second Edition published in 1988 is an expansion of the
first and is entitled The Kandyan Kingdom of Sri Sanka 1707- 1782.
The first edition itself virtually displaced all the earlier writings
as authorities on the subject and had served as an authority for
other scholars to take-off not merely into the history of the period
but also into such inquiries as those with regard to a Sinhala-
Buddhist identity and communal relations at the present day."
