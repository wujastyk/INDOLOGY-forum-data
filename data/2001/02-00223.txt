Vidyasankar,
I sympathise with your frustration, and I do think Samar is being
unnecessarily polemical and often wrong.  But it isn't quite accurate
to characterise the influence of 'Sanghis' as restricted to the brief
period of BJP governance in independent India, for several reasons;
- The Indian government pre-1947 was quite sensitive to prevailing
  Indian opinion, and certainly was not (as a lot of this sort of
  debate seems to assume) dictating policies without consideration of
  that opinion (which is not, of course, to claim that it was a
  democratic government - though whether present Indian governments
  meet that criterion either is also somewhat in question).
- The Congress party, both before and after independence, had a strong
  (I personally would say dominant) Hindu right wing that can only be
  with difficulty distinguished from the Sangh (cf. B.G. Tilak).
  Indira Gandhi's well known Hindu mobilisation and minority
  demonisation campaigns are only one facet of this.
Regards,
Rohan.
