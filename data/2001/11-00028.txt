Subject: NCC / Yoga in 6 a;ngas
Message-ID: <161227069932.23782.18179849451956781868.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I just heard from a friend in Madras that the vol. 15 of the NCC (of which
he was able to see a first draft) is at the stage of the final revision of
the proofs and will be thus soon published.

A reference to a "yoga in 6 a;ngas" (beginning regularly with yama) occurs
twice in a purANic text I am studying, in a portion dealing with vedAnta.

        "yamAdiyogadharmA;ngaSaTka"
        "saSaTa;ngena yogena"

I knew the classical 8 a;ngas. Is someone aware of such a number of a;ngas
in some (early?) doctrine of yoga (j?Anayoga?)?
