Copies of manuscripts and recordings of T.S. wanted
Dear list members,
Can anyone tell me if it is possible to obtain either microfilm or
photocopies of manuscripts of the Taittiriya Samhita or fairly large
portions of it, at least 1 kANDa at a reasonable price.
I'm also interested in copies of recordings of the TS or at least 1 kANDa of
it.  (I already have the reference to the recordings of the Delhi Vedic
Trust and am checking that.)
Many thanks,
