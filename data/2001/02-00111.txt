Skt. ve"syaa ``prostitute, courtesan" has to be connected with
Skt. ve"sa ``house; brothel; prostitution" which is already attested
in the Vaajasaneyi-Sa.mhitaa (Kaa.nva recension), in Manu, etc.
(cf. the noun vi"s ``habitation, settlement" and the root vi"s, or
ve"s ``enter, settle in", already .Rgvedic and of Indo-European
origin).
