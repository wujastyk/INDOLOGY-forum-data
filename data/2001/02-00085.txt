correctly mentions that Urdu is a native Indian language. He also
correctly points out that 70 per cent words in Urdu are from Sanskrit.

While many have attempted to point out the Urdu is not the language of
Muslims only, no one has bothered to point out Hindi is not the language of
Hindus only. A large number of Hindi authors have been Muslim, both modern
as well as in the early periods. Their language is as Sanskritized as that
of the Hindu authors. It is sad that only Hindus are expected to read
Kabir, Rahim, Jayasi and many others.

Will people of Pakistan ever know that "Hindi" is as much (if not more) a
part of their heritage as Urdu?
