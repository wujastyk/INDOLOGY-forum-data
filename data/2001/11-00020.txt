box for foundation deposit?
A library patron is interested in a clay box he was shown in a private
collection in South Asia some years ago.  It was of clay, rectangular,
and was sealed by two bands of metal.  The owner cut the bands off and
in inside was divided into several rows latitudinally and longitudinally
of compartments.  In each was a small silver statuette of a deity and a
plate with an inscription in some script the patron did not know.  At
this remove of time the patron does not remember further details. The
owner said he had a dozen more similar ones.  Has anyone seen or heard
of anything like this?
Thanks,
