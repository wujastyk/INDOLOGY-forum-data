In my earlier post suggesting Drav. golla > Hindi gvAla,
the name kOvalar is mentioned nowhere.

The different names in Dravidian for herdsmen
like golla/goLLa (Telugu), kOvalar, kuRumpar and iTaiyar
(Tamil) and Kurubaru/kuruva/kuruma (Kannada) come from
different roots, and none of them, I believe, derive
from skt. gopAla. Tel. golla is recorded by C. P. Brown
among others are from goRRe 'sheep' (DED 1799).

In South India even powerful landlord caste names
do not come from Sanskrit. In Andhra, the landed
castes kApu, kamma and the titles nAyuDu, nAyAka,
Reddi have clear Dravidian roots. Then, how come
a tribe of *low* social status called "golla"
come from Sanskrit? As you derive golla from
skt. gopAla, but the problem I see is their
position in social hierarchy and low amount
of sanskritization. Also, note that mostly
they tend sheep and goats, and not cows.
So, shepherd gollas naturally connect with
goRRi 'sheep', rather than IE go, gau 'cow'.

It is far easier to go from Dr. golla to
Hindi gvAla than the romantic idea of
skt. gopAla roots.

Insisting on a Sanskrit source derivation for the
low status golla tribe is a good example.
IE go, gau for sheep/goat herding golla tribe?

But, I understand the problem: Even "pAdiri"
Caldwell said Skt. draviDa > dramiDa > tamizh.
It took quite a while to reverse the arrows
to "prove" that "tamizh" indeed is the root, and not
the other way around.

But even now many Indologists are puzzled to
learn that tamizh gave birth to draviDa. See
