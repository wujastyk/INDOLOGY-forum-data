I'm in India
recovering from the Mahakumbh and have been looking at
the archive. I see there have been a couple of vague
mails about dates and places of the Kumbh Melas. The
sequence of the last 12 years, a full Kumbh cycle, was
as follows:

Jan 1989 Prayag Mahakumbh

Nov 1991 Nasik Kumbh Mela

Mar 1992 Hardwar Ardh Kumbh Mela

Apr 1992 Ujjain Simhasth Mela

Jan 1995 Prayag Ardh Kumbh Mela

Mar 1998 Hardwar Kumbh Mela

Jan 2001 Prayag Mahakumbh

I'm afraid I can't fill you in on the astrological
significances 'though.....

Yours,

James Mallinson
