I'm in India
recovering from the Mahakumbh and have been looking at
the archive. I see there have been a couple of vague
mails about dates and places of the Kumbh Melas. The
sequence of the last 12 years, a full Kumbh cycle, was
as follows:
Jan 1989 Prayag Mahakumbh
Nov 1991 Nasik Kumbh Mela
Mar 1992 Hardwar Ardh Kumbh Mela
Apr 1992 Ujjain Simhasth Mela
Jan 1995 Prayag Ardh Kumbh Mela
Mar 1998 Hardwar Kumbh Mela
Jan 2001 Prayag Mahakumbh
I'm afraid I can't fill you in on the astrological
significances 'though.....
Yours,
James Mallinson
