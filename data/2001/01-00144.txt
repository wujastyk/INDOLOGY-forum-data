Re. GosvAmi
Is this a personal conversation between some people??
I don't remember reading this sort of thing in Indology list.
FYI.
Lot of Vaishnavism went from Tamil lands to Bengal,
and not the other way around.
I have not come across Goswami in early Vaishnava literature in Tamil.
Do you know any instance in Tamil? I'll be interested.
Regards,
SM
