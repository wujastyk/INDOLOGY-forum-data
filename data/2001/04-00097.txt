Idiom and Grammar (and chariots again!)

You are invited to point out all errors in evidence that I make on this
List, Mr. Bhatta -- in Sanskrit or on any other matters. Curiously, none of
your posts have ever mentioned any. Now that we agree that I'm a
comparative historian and not a Vedicist, is there a *specific* Indological
issue that you want to discuss on the List? I'm always eager to learn from
knowledgeable scholars.
