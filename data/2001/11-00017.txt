Sadas/Zadas
Friends:
At Manu 8.241 we have the term zada or sada--meaning crop. Most of
the editions read sada; Jolly and Derrett read zada [with the
palatal]. Most of my manuscripts also read sada [except a few in
southern scripts]. I would like your expert opinion on the palatal
vs. the dental forms. If I follow my manuscripts, I would adopt the
dental, but it appears to be the wrong. Thanks.
Patrick
