SV: An article mentionig Indologists
The following site talks about the presence of horses at the Indus site
(claiming that horses were known to inhabitants of the Harappan
civilization) , and also contains a brief critique of Witzel and Farmer:

S.Kalyanaraman seems to be involved in some way with this site, as a letter
written to him by some archaeologist is published on it.
Would appreciate any comments on this.
