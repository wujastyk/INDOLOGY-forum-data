Thank you very much for asking Professor Staal about this matter.
It certainly is interesting.  Some time back my supervisor asked
me if the ancient Indian formulation of the Pythagorean theorem
could be interpreted to include other figures than squares.  At that
time I did not know any Sanskrit, so I answered according to the
translations and studies with which I was familiar with.  None of
those works mention anything about the ancient Indian formulation
possibly being more general than the simple Pythagorean theorem.
 As Professor Staal remarks it would be fascinating to find
evidence of the ancient Indians having thought of other polygons or
arcs.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
