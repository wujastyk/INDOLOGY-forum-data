A little tongue-in-cheek comment, but I actually meant to
refer to the village schoolmaster, not to the good vicar.

... 'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,
And e'en the story ran--that he could gauge:
In arguing too, the parson own?d his skill,
For e?en though vanquish?d he could argue still;
While words of learned length and thund'ring sound
Amaz?d the gazing rustics rang?d around; ...

Best,
Vidyasankar
