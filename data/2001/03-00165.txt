National Identity
Friends:
I would like to enter the foray about India's national identity, whether
composite or Hindu, with one small but pertinent observation.
Even if we accpet the concept of the composite identity as Prof. Sen would
have us do, there is no doubt that many Hindu ideas and beliefs are all
pervasie. As an example the idea of a previous and a future birth, which is
a Hindu doctrine, is accepted by Indian Christians and Indian Muslims, for
whom it is non-doctrinal.
