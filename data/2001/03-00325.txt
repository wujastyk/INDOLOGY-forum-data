Red Indian Holocaust
   I fully agree with you and I very much doubt that no matter the
evidences which might be gathered it's absolutely unlikely that one
could characterize anything within the array of hindu ideological
exagerations as able to produce any holocaust.If there is something which
distinguishes Hindu civilization from many others is its tolerance.I visited
the site in question and it didn?t convince me.
