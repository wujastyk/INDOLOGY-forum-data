"invasion"?
The expression 'of course' means 'admittedly'.
It is not necessarily the case. An incoming group may establish the
dominance of their language. That doesn't inevitably mean that they
killed all the existing inhabitants - something that would be very
difficult to do without modern technology.
In general, it is the ruling groups that change under these
circumstances, not the mass of the population.
