OCR for reading diacritics
OCR for reading diacritics
 Dear Indology List Members
 I have a question regarding OCR. I want to get me a scanner and was
 wondering which OCR software I need to be able to read romanised Sanskrit.
I
 would prefer a rather inexpensive program which is able to recognize
 diacritics. The software does not to be capable to read any Indic letters
or
 transform Latin characters into e.g. Devanagari.
 I can be contacted at Jakob.Winkler at t-online.de
 Thank you very much.
