Chariots and Ships
Subrahmanya S. writes, of RV war chariots:
Start with the obvious verses on war chariots in RV 6.75, which are replete
with images of enemies being trampled by war-chariot horses. By the
despised standards of critical scholarship, like Oldenberg's, this is a
very late RV hymn. But by the revolutionary standards of S. Talageri, whom
you defend, it is found in the "oldest" and "hoariest" of RV books. See
again Talageri's fantastic chronology at http://www.safarmer.com/pico/talageri.html.
