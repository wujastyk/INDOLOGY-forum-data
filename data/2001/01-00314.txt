godhUli and goloka
In one of the early Tamil attestations of go-dhUli, the
cattle herds of the Kongars going to water fords
producing much of godhuuli, and that cow-dust goes
to fill up the skies.
     van2pulam tumiya pOki kogkar
     paTu maNi Ayam nIrkku nimirntu cellum
     cEtu A eTutta ce nila kurUu tukaL
     akal iru vicumpin2 Un2Ri tOn2Rum
                          -akanAn2URu 79:5-8
In a slightly later poem quoted by the ancient
grammar TolkAppiyam commentator, the godhUli is
praised heavily: the gifting of cattle herds with
cows and calves to brahmins creates a goloka on this
very bhUloka! The gifted herds raise so much godhUli
that the dust makes the goloka in the skies get covered
with soil dust from the bhUloka with the end result that
the goloka appears to be bhUloka!
Have seen published paintings (Pahari, Rajsthani)
where Krishna comes to the village with the herds
in the evening. The godhUli cherished by gopas and gopikAs.
Are there descriptions in Sanskrit (epics?) where the
godhUli (eg., Krishna's herds) from the bhUloka are said to reach
goloka, part of Heaven? Many thanks.
