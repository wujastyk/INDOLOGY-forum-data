"invasion"?
I noticed a new book by Elst which has the title "Update on the Aryan
Invasion Debate".  I'm unaware that there exists such a debate.  Am I
alone in thinking this?  I thought that any idea of an invasion as such
was discredited thirty years ago.
I'm not being disingenuous about this; I'm not madly interested in all the
arguments about aryans and so forth, so I can easily believe that I've
missed some major point.
