SV: Death of Sanskrit
To what extent is it possible to do some demographics on this issue?  At
least some part of this topic can surely be grasped quantitatively.
How many Sanskrit-functioning pandits were active in, say 1600?  1700?
1900?  Where would we look for statistics?
I think there is probably some mileage in counting manuscripts too, in
various interesting ways.  (By work, by author, by repository, etc.)
