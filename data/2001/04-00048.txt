Naayaka-Naayakii Bhaavam in Sufism
In the Tamil bhakti literature (c. 5th centuty beginning),
the saint-poets taking the female persona and longing for the beloved
God is common. Srivaishnava commentators on Alvars say in manipravalam:
"jnAnattil tan2 pEccu, prEmattil peN pEccu". Roughly -
"talk philosophy as men, but express love (for God) as women".
Do the Sufism also portray God-Devotee as lovers? Rumi? Earlier?
Rumi is an Afghan.
If Sufism does express this bhAva, is an Indian influence discernible?
Thanks,
