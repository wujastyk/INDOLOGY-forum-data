dev- / Devil
Gunthard Mueller <gm at ANTHOSIMPRINT.COM> has written as follows:
I am not sure whether Greek or Latin derivation have any mention of Asur or
Ahur too and the two concepts may be unrelated.
I was thinking  about  the mid eastern tradition where Asur or Ahur was
worshiped.  In Arabian Nights and other folklore , "dev" is considered an
evil spirit as synonym for Jinn.
Have a peaceful and joyous day.

Random thought of the day:
        Use your own judgement; then do as I say.
