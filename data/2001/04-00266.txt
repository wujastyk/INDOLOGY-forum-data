Ruzsa-Fosse's proposal seems also to me a very good one.
It would be the "service" of the scholars in indology, acting as "filters",
to submit to that kind of list the valuable questions they would get from
non-specialists.
Anyway, thank you to Dominik Wujastyk (in fact, do you get the copies of
the articles on IE medical comparison that I sent to you some months ago?).
