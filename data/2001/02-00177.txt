I am glad to be able to announce a new release by the Harvard Oriental
Series, vol. 57,
the magnum opus by my old friend Prof. B.R. Sharma, his puurnaahuti, as he
says.

This is the first vol. (puurvaarcika) of the Samaveda Samhita of the
Kauthuma School, published along with 3 commentaries. The second vol. (due
late this year) will contain the uttaraarcika, the third one various
indexes and a long introduction.

The Samaveda Samhita of the Kauthuma School
With Padapatha and the Commentaries of Madhava, Bharata-Svamin and Sayana

Edited by B. R. Sharma

The Samaveda contains the earliest tradition of music from India. It
presents largely Rigvedic textual material in a form arranged for singing
in the solemn Srauta ritual. Since the first editions by Theodor Benfey
(1848) and Satyavrata Samasrami (1874-1899), there has been no complete,
accented edition that also included all its important commentaries. The
present edition is based on manuscripts collected from all over India and
Europe. B.R. Sharma, Dean of Samaveda studies, presents the accented text,
its Padapatha, and the commentaries of Madhava, Bharata-Svamin and Sayana
in three volumes of 2500 pages. These contain the Purvarcika and Uttaracika
portions of the text, and a third volume the indexes and a detailed
introduction to the whole work. Vols. 2 and 3 to appear soon.
