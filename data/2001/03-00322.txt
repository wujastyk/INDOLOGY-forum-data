is the Gita dishonest?
It is one way to approach the Gita as ultimate religious
reference, and another to try to understand it as a work
of religious literature.
If you come from the former angle, you will see truth
in the Gita itself, no matter what it says, and you will
not be concerned about paradoxes, consistency, and
other such measly nitty-gritty.
If you try to understand it as a work of religious
literature, you have to develop your own viewpoint.
That's a lot harder.
I assume that the indology list is not a place of
devotion, but of analysis.
Running for cover,
