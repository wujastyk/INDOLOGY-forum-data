Naciketas?
Naciketas, representing the stem form of the word in Sanskrit, is generally
used by scholars.  The c represents unaspirated palatal c, a bit like the
second consonant in "church".  (Ch is used for the aspirated version, like
the *first* consonant in that word.)  In older texts, "ch" may be used for
the unaspirated version and "chh" for the aspirated version.
