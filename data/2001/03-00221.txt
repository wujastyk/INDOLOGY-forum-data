Kindly check this. It is a sample of how gIta is misunderstood. The list is
endless.

Please check b.g.3.9
yajnArthAt karmaNo 'nyatra
loko 'yam karma-bandhanaH
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sangaH samAcara
"Any work done for other than yajna is a cause of bondage", meaning yajna is
not bondage. If there is a doubt that yajna may not remove existing bondages
or give freedom, b.g. 3.11
devAn bhavayatAnena
te deva bhavayantu vaH
parasparam bhavayantaH sre-
yaH param avapsyatha
"The gods having been pleased by the yajna will please you, mutually
pleasing one another, the supreme you will achieve".
