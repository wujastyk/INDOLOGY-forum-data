I  know that this is not Indology -- but! Can you provide me with a living example of evolution? We hear so much about Darwinism and evolution, but is it not a case of evolution happened in the past, evolution will happen in the future, but evolution is not happening just now?!

I am asking about evolved living entities, not microbes etc.
