I am having difficulty locating the following Sanskrit texts and was
hoping someone might be able help me with acquiring copies of them. This
is the information I have:

1. Caraka Samhita with Jejjata's commentary (2 vols., 1940-41)

2. Caraka Samhita with Yogindranatha's commentary.
        Two editions:
        1. 3 vols. (incomplete): 1920-30
        2. Jaipur, 1982.

In particular, I need Cikitsasthana, Chapter 2 [in 4 parts
(padas)], on vajikarana.

If anyone can help, please respond to my personal email (below).

Many thanks,

Ken Zysk
