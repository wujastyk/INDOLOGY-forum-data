David Salmon
Given the bizarre claims the Hindutva waadis have been making--claiming all
kinds of science and technology in ancient India--Dr Farmer's satire was
well within the limits of scholarship in my opinion.
I request David to stop getting into personalities and do some original
research or else write amusing satires (with or without Vishal Agarwal).
