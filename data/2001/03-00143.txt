Suresh,
By forwarding the article, you clearly signal your agreement with it. Thus,
Aditya's characterization would hold.
As for 'personal accusations', you have certainly indulged in your fair
share of them. Over the last three months, you have sent me, not to mention
some others on this list, at least 5 mails with completely offensive
language. Now that you *think* you are on the receiving end, you sing a
different tune.
You want the moderator of the list to stop Aditya's posting privileges for
his 'nauseating' remarks. What about your nauseating remarks about  Muslims
and Islam? They are far more offensive than anything Aditya has said. Thus,
your posting privileges should also be stopped.
What was the point in forwarding this article? Even as an ex-post-facto
first-principles argument, it is devoid of any validity whatsoever. It is
just a piece of junk and as such whatever it may signify is meaningless and
cannot contribute to any discussion. All that it signified is your approval
of it, which says something about your understanding of history.
