Dear Dr. Pant

We do not have a direct reference to agnidaNDa . But it seems
possible that your agnidaNDa might somehow refer to the actions of
the priest as in the "shaft of fire" produced by the priest when he
places the small wooden offerings into the kundas

On the other hand we have found the spellings in Newar and Nepali
manuscripts to be frequently a bit off. If it is mis-spelling  for
agnidana it might be a clear reference to the gifts offered at the
service

At the Agni math  in Agni math tole in Patan, a Brahmin keeps the
fires burning and where offerings are made to Vishnu, Brahma and Siva
through the fires in the Yajnakundas
