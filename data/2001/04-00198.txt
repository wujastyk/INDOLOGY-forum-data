While language replacement on a very wide scale can happen,
one with relatively little effect on the intrusive language (e.g.,
Professor Witzel's EJVS paper on substrate languages in old Indo-Aryan,
and compare to non-I-E in Hittite or Greek ) is much harder to
imagine.  The remnants of the Harappan civilization must have been
meagre indeed.
