While the obscurantist and destructive act of the
Taliban stands condemned, it is not clear with what
face do the Hindutva sympathizers in India and
elsewhere e.g., this list condemn Islam ... so soon
after an equally contemptible act of destroying the
Babri Mosque. Some of the lead actors of that drama
are unpenitent till today and are in positions of
power ... Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi etc...

So does Hinduism stand condemned since then?

I'd appreciate a cheerful :-) but considered answer.

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
