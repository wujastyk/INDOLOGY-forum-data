Even to this day, there exist ancient shrines scattered all over
the Middle east from Egypt to Arabia.It was the Turkish custom to
destroy the temples and build tombs over the dead people.To the best
of my knowledge (please correct me if I were wrong), there is no tomb
(round cylindrical structure and building) on the spot where the
Prophet (pbuh)of Islam is resting eternally.It was reported in the
ancient Hindu scriptures that at the place where the living God was
once  playing,in future the tomb of the dead would be erected. When
Bauddha round stoops were built in the ancient India, some felt that
prophecy was fulfilled. No, it was fulfilled when the tomb called
Taj-Mahal was built on the bank of KrishNa's YamunA river. True Islam
should be separated from practices of Turks with the ancient totem of
Wolf. Thanks.

When Cyrus the great conquered Babylon,all temples and deities
were saved intact. Cyrus the great prostrated in front of Marduk and
burnt incense.He promised Babylonians that their gods were his gods
too.He made Jews free and gave them money to build their temple on
their return. Cyrus the great knew the ancient world and respected
the ancient traditions.Cyrus the Great was Persian and not Turk.This
is the difference between Arya and Wolf. Thanks.

   This is interesting. Are the founders of Delhi sultanate
   Turk or Persian Aryans? Is it your claim that basically
   there is not much difference between Iranians and Indians
   who speak Aryan languages?

   Kind regards,
