Dear Experts,
I am writing an encyclopedia article on Jainism and need to provide the
population figure for Jains living in India. I only know of the Census of
India from ca. 1982 which I believe gives the number of ca. 3 mio. Could
anyone enlighten me where I can find more recent data on the Jain
populuation.
With many thanks, A.v.Rospatt
