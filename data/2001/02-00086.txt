Dear Sanskritists,

How is the name, vezyA 'courtesan' explained in terms of origins?
It does not appear to be IE since it is attested only from the
times of Mahabharata epic onwards.

Take a look at the tamil verb, vEy-
vEy-tal 1. to put on, as a garland; to wear, as crown;
3. to surround; 4. to set, as gems; 5. to be fitted with;
6. to bore; to open, blossom

In ancient Tamil sangam literature, the dancing women
who convert all inauspicious things into auspiciousness
are given golden garlands and flowers regularly. To ward off
the evil eye and increase auspiciousness, the brides,
grooms  and kings are tied with a golden plate (called bhAsinam
'bright head-band').

Since casting off the evil eye and causing auspiciousness to
increase by their august presence is the prescribed duty (for eg.,
in the saiva agamas) of the devadasi, is the name vezyA
related to vEy- (> vEs- > vEz-) 'to wear lustrous ornaments'.


Regards,
N. Ganesan
