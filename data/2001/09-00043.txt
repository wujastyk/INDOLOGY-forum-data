>From our field notes

People come to this shrine to offer a special puja on birthdays. The
shrine is said to have a pair of nagas (male and female), that was
brought physically from Sankhu and was put in the well, that in
inside the temple. The officiating priest must perform his puja with
his wife: always is a married priest with wife present. There is a
belief that if something happens to one of the nagas, then it is an
omen that something will happen to either the priest or his wife,
depending on the gender of the snake.
Priest is a Newar Brahamin (Joshi), but devotees to the shrine are
both Buddhist and Hindu.
Annual Festival: Magh Sankranti (1st day of Magh)

Informed by the priest and his wife at the site.
