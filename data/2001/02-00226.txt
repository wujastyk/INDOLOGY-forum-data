Subject: VyAkaraNa question: contextual factors in determining meaning

Grammarians have been only marginally interested in the "extralinguistic
psychological" factors.  For example, consider Panini's rule k.rtyair
adhikaarthavacane (2.1.33).  This rule allows derivation of compounds like
kaakapeyaa nadii, if some "additional significance is conveyed".  The
additional significance, as the commentators suggest is praise or blame of
the river.  While the grammarians thus admit that in some cases such
"additional meanings" are of grammatical relevance, they have not
generally gone into theorizing about how one understands these
"additional" meanings.  We do not hear of Vyanjanaa in the grammatical
tradition until we come to the works of Naagezabha.t.ta, where we have
contrary indications about its acceptance.  You may look up an interesting
paper by Saroja Bhate:  "Vyanjana as Reflected in the Formal Structure of
Language", in Paninian Studies, Professor S.D. Joshi Felicitation Volume,
edited by Madhav Deshpande and Saroja Bhate, 1991, Michigan Papers on
South and Southeast Asia, # 37, Center for South and Southeast Asian
Studies, University of Michigan, pp. 55-64.  K.P. Shukla, in his Sanskrit
work (Vaiyaakara.naanaam anye.saam ca matena zabda-svaruupa-tac-chakti-
vicaara.h, Varanasi, 1979, p. 125), refers to the factors cited by Birgit
Kellner with the term abhidhaa-niyaamaka.  They help one choose between
alternative basic meanings.  Shukla distinguishes between possible
subsequent suggestions etc. from the initial determination from among
alternative basic meanings (p. 127):  kvacic ca prakara.naadinaa artha-
bodhaanantaram vaktur boddhavyasya ca devadattader vailak.sa.nyena nava-
navonme.sazaalinyaa pratibhayaa ca vyangyo 'py artha.h pratiiyate / ...

Best,
