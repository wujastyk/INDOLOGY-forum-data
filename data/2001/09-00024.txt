Dear Dominik,

Thank you for your inpormation about the Kairo program.
Since I know Dr. Mercier very well, I sent an e-mail to him
ordering the full version of the program.

I was thinking about how to improve my pancanga proram,
but probably I do not need to spend time for it any more.

Yours,

Michio
