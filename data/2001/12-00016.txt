Dear Herman,

I just saw your message re. B.G.L Swamy and thought I would send a message
telling you I have received your book.

It looks excellent and I will go through it in detail over Xmas.  George
Hart's response is predictable given the argument he advanced in 1975.

Have a good Xmas.

Cheers,

Greg
