Great, I'll check the references you've cited. I suppose I
really have to go back to the invaluable Kane. Meanwhile,
just to satisfy my curiosity quickly - is there evidence to
differentiate between a Brhadyogiyajnavalkyasmrti text and
a plain Yajnavalkyasmrti? The 1949 Nirnayasagar edition
available online just has the latter title, and seems to
be a much smaller text, with only three adhyAyas. See
