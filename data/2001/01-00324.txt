Friends,
It is quite heartening for us in Ahmedabad and Gujarat to realise that
people from all over are concerned and want to help.  A lot of help is
pouring in for the immediate relief in areas that have got media attention.
I believe more needs to be done for far flung smaller towns and villages
that have received no media attention.  Besides, long term rehabilitation is
another area that needs to be thought of.  Some sort of adoption of an area
may be of help.
Once more, thanks for the concern expressed.
Francis Parmar, SJ
