Conference announcement: Romantic Orientalism (fwd)
Romantic Orientalism
Gregynog, Powys, Wales, 12-15 July 2002.
The plenary speakers are Rosane Rocher (Pennsylvania), P.J. Marshall
(London), Nigel Leask (Cambridge), Tim Fulford (Nottingham Trent) and Peter
Kitson (Dundee).
The aim of this conference is to focus a post-Saidian scrutiny upon the
cultural, political, commercial, and aesthetic dimensions of the synchronous
growth of Romanticism and Orientalism. The European Romantic imagination was
saturated with Orientalism, but it reflected persistent ambivalence
concerning the East, complicated in Britain by colonial anxiety and imperial
guilt. We shall consider how Western notions of cultural hegemony were
bolstered by imperial rhetoric and challenged by intercultural translation.
