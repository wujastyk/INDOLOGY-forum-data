Khambesvari puujaa with Buffalo sacrifice
Don't know. But I learnt of a curious practice: The children
who were acting as gods at Ramlila were considered too "holy"
and godly, and after the festival, they were poisoned.
Now the practice is stopped by law.
Yes, the old Indian practice is to cut the head off of sacrifial
animals, and then smear the blood and fatty oil/lard etc., on
the icons. When Brahmana texts talk of "severe" headache, it refers to
immolation, and "sweat" means blood. Later, blood and
animal fat is changed to vermilion and sesame oil respectively.
It appears pUjALi/pUjAri = izicin2an2 = "smearer" of sacrifical
blood/oil.
