I believe here the writer has simply ? though perhaps too casually -
remarked that by investigating Indo-European languages one also becomes
aware of such derived loan words in the Thai language. I am positive the
writer is fully aware that Thai is not an IE language, and I personally
would not have interpreted the above sentence as declaring so.
Witzel however writes:
<<It is news to linguists that Thai is an Indo-European language. They
know, however,  that it has many Skt.,/Pkt. loanwords.>>
Yes, both directly and via Khmer and Malay. And don?t forget Pali and the
odd Tamil.
