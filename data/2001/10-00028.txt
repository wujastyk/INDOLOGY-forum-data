>?From John E. Mitchiner's introduction to his edition of the Yuga-PurANa
(Bibliotheca Indica, 1986), it may be supposed that the author was at that
time planning to produce an edition of the unedited GArgIya-JyotiSa (of
which the Yuga-PurANa is a chapter), obviously an important old
astro-nomical/-logical tract dealing with various other subjects.
Has somebody heard about such a work in progress?
