Third eye of Shiva
Venkatraman Iyer wrote:
It is common to associate Shiva's third eye with fire, and fire/sun and
moon are opposites. KAma, the god of love, is, to mention an example, burnt
by the fire emitted by this eye. A comparison of the eye with the moon
would surprise me. It would also seem inappropriate because of the
(crescent of the) moon being iconographically placed in Shiva's hair.
