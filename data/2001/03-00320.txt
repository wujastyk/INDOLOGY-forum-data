is the Gita dishonest?

I suppose it is for the list founder to judge the relevance of my contribution.
The Gita itself indicates that knowledge results in devotion (10.8) and that
devotion results in knowledge (10.10).
One could see devotion as a tool to gain insight into the Gita, and one
could argue that a devotional interpretation is, at the very least, a valid
way of appreciating its meaning.
As far as the Gita's paradoxes, Arjuna seems ultimately to have transcended
them at least by his own admission (Bg. 18.73).
