I was reading about the taNNumai drum in CT.
It appears taNNumai is comparable to what we call as mRdangam today.

Its name contains the prefix, taN 'cool', and its
percussion sound is described soft ('ta_laGku' or 'aritta
kural taNNumai'). Usually the bards 'pANar' were gifted
with young calfs, and the soft calf-leather was utilized as
taNNumai membranes.

  kan2Ru peRu valcip pANan2 kaiyatai
  vaLLuyirt taNNumai pOla  - naRRiNai 310:9-10

The suspended leathers of the taNNumai drum were
tightly strapped: 'vici uRu taNNumai' - puRam 89:7

The important information that the drums were
smeared with a flour paste, and were played with
the drummer's hands just as maddaLam or mRdangam
is given by patiRRuppattu poem:

             ".....  maak kaN taNNumai
      kaival iLaiyar kaiyalai a_luGka"

                          - patiRRuppattu 51: 33-34.

"maak kaN taNNumai" clearly states the application
of flour paste on the drums and one of the earliest
literary attestations of this ancient Indian practice
mentioned in Natyasastram, Susruta Samhita, and so on.
