Notable website
This isn't exactly heavy scholarship, but one of the most intriguing
things I've seen on the internet is http://www.eprarthana.com.  It
has virtual poojas (which you can try, though you may need a fast
internet connection), and you can actually have poojas performed at
various Indian temples by clicking on the pooja you want, at which
point your pooja is put in a "pooja cart," and you pay by credit card
when you sign out.  Then, one hopes, the pooja is performed at the
proper time.  Might be useful for teaching -- in any case, it's quite
ingenious, and the virtual poojas are quite well done.
