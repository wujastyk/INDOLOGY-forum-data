For details see my old paper :

On some unknown systems of marking the Vedic accents. Vishvabandhu
Commemoration Volume = Vishveshvaranand  Indological Journal  12,
1974,
472-508

(with many misprints, comme d'habitude).


Oldest MS known: Vajaseneyi Samhita of Sukla Yajurveda but accents
of
*older* Maitrayani Samhita style,  c. 1200 CE (palaeography), from
N.India,
see front cover of:

M. Witzel (ed.) Inside the texts, Beyond the Texts. New Approaches to
the
Study of the Vedas. (Harvard Oriental Series, Opera Minora 2).
Cambridge
1997

Otherwise, 1428 CE in Nepal, for details see above paper. Nothing to
be
added since then.
there are some wrong leads only.
