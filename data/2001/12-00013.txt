etymology of puja
Friends,
I have recently read Jarl Charpentier's 1927 paper in Indian
Antiquary on the meaning and etymology of puujaa.  I found it rather
strange. He connects it with 'smearing,' making a rather big deal of
the smearing of images etc with things like red powders etc. There
must be more convincing discussions of the history of this word, no?
