Uninformed discussion on the Gita

Good god, no!  Your are thinking of John Paul Jones.  To say that JPJ's
latest solo album Zooma is an extraordinary musical achievement, although
at times overwhelming, especially in its opening tracks, Zooma and Grind,
which seem to refer powerfully to the relentless mechanisation of modern
life, and that his use of eight and more strings on his bass guitars is
heroic, but that the dependence on Pro Tools in production seems to take
away from the naturalness and musicality of which, as is demonstrated in
old Zep tracks such as Ramble On, Jones is eminently capable and which
are, dare one say it, more succesfully achieved in the recent virtuoso
release Out Bound by bassist Stu Hamm, would take us far beyond the remit
of the INDOLOGY discussion.
