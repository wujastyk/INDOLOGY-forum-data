Minorities in Afghanistan
Does anyone know how many followers of minority religions are still there
in Afghanistan?
Before Talibans, there used to a thriving community of Hindu/Sikh traders
in Afghanistan, mostly Khatris. They have been present in Afghanistan and
central Asia since ancient times. Some of their clans may actually have
originated in Afghanistan or nearby region.
