My last request for reference. "Ancient name for
the town of kOval is iTaikazi".??
I have read "kOval" as the place name, but not
iTaikazi, in CT.

Without the references, one never knows whether
it's the mailer's personal view, or attested

  But the temple iTaikazi in Rajendra I's mid-11th
century inscription is at least 1000 years later
than kOval in CT.
  TiruviTaikkazi, in Tanjore disrict is famous for
the Muruhan temple, and at a far distance to
kOval which really is in S. Arcot!
