Friends,
I happened meet Swami Tyagananda here in Boston today and
he was kind enough to give me a copy of his rebuttal to
"Kali's Child" of Jeffrey Kripal. I spent this afternoon
going through Swami's notes and the paper he presented at AAR.

I have not read "Kali's child". What appears to me
it's a product of ignorance and immature knowledge in
Sanskrit and Bengali. It's not clear if the book is written
with a bias or ran out of hand.

Have people read this book? Do you have an opinion?
Is it an example of Rajaram on the other side?
The greater scare is how many such books are in the making
with cursory knowledge and borrowed translations?

Let 2000 end with these thoughts and let's aim for
cultural research without bias in the coming century!

I will like to hear if anyone has read the book and
has an opinion.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra



i have gone through the letter of shree bmishra,



Although i have not gone through the books refered by him,but in india there are many people,who beleive that the eight bhairavas[or 64 bhairavasas believed] are the sons of godess durga or kali.As all the shakti's are the appearence of parvati the wife of lord shiva,and the 10 mahavidhyas among which godess kali is the first and kamala is the last one,also are nothing but the various appearences of godess parvati,the bhairavas are supposed to be the son,s of lord shiva,so they are automatically are the sons of kali or durga or parvati.



There are many books each one defines the bhairava in a different way,some worships bhairava calling hime as the form of lord shiva,others call them the sons of shakti etc..,



It is all upto a person how he realises,the god.
