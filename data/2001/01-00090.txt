Variations in Satvalekaras Taittiriya Samhita
Harry Spier writes:
There's something very similar in J. L. Shastri's edition of the TaittirYya
UpaniSad (UpaniSatsaMgrahaH, Motilal Banarsidass, 1970, pp. 21-31).  Here
it appears to be a sort of aide-memoire, giving the initial word (or two)
of each paragraph followed by the number of verses in it.
