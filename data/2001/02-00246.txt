Khojki & Hindus/ India Gandhi's "minority demonisation"
I'm surprised "Malaiya" doesn't know about this. I don't have any references
at hand right now, but you could get some information even from a web
search:

I am surprised that he is unaware of the encouragement by indira gandhi to
armed akali sects and militant groups in the earlu eighties and seventies.
She reversed her stand only because sikh militancy went out of hand. Every
one knows that bhindranwale was gandhis creation.
