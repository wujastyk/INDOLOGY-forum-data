>?From mUn2Ru 'three' we have mummai, mummalam and so on.

Ka. himmaDi, Ka. himmeTTu, Ta. tImmozi, Ta. mummalam
etc. are relevant and have any bearing in the formation of Kannada.
What is needed is -ann- < -amn- and not -mm- examples.

R. N's suggestion kam 'fragrant' + nADu is dubious, and no
other examples of this assimilation (C)amn > (C)ann exist in either
Kannada or Tamil.
