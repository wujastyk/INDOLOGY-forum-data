Ka. himmaDi, Ka. himmeTTu, Ta. tImmozi, Ta. mummalam
etc. are relevant and have any bearing in the formation of Kannada.
What is needed is -ann- < -amn- and not -mm- examples.
R. N's suggestion kam 'fragrant' + nADu is dubious, and no
other examples of this assimilation (C)amn > (C)ann exist in either
Kannada or Tamil.
