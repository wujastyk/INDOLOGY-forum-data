Not quite the same view but similar are quoted with approval in the
introduction to the 1955 ed of Biblical Hebrew in the once prestigious
Teach Yourself series (R.K. Harrison):  "[Hebrew] is the eternal
mother-tongue of all true religion" and "This is the language which
God spoke".  One assumes that his motives are to encourage the study
of Hebrew among Christians as he deplores the lack of interst among
theology students.
