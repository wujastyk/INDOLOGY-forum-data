nAdasvaram, the wind instrument
In the thread "Musical trees and rivers?", Dr. C. Wedemeyer
asked about instruments called vanaspati and nadii.
The following are my thoughts concerning only nadi which I believe
is the famous wind instrument of South India. I will write
about what Vanaspati might mean as a kind of harp in the near
future.

N. Mohkamsing:
In his latest mail on his question:
A popular reed instrument is called nAdasvaram. This wind
instrument's players are the teachers (naTTuvanAr) for BharatanATyam
dancers all over the world.
Nadasvaram has the word, nADa 'reed'. Dravidian has both naDa/nADa as
'reed'. Like yATu 'goat' > yAdava, nADasvaram is now popularly known
as nAdasvaram.
Monier-Williams lists:
cf. %{nadI}) Mn. MBh. &c. ; = %{naDa} , reed RV. i , 32 , 8; (%{I})
f. see %{nadI4}.
Some references on the nAdasvaram wind instrument (not including
those in Tamil) which will be useful in understanding nadi/nAdi:

BTW, An inscribed urn containing Aryadeva's ashes have been found
near Kanchi. (Will give the ref. later). Did Aryadeva spend some time
in South India? Was he born in Sri Lanka?
