Save Indology

I think Dr. Kochhar suggested this before. However this policy, though

He insists of about 15 messages per month. But my point is
as long as the messages are 1) not insulting, 2) does not refer to
a living person's name or recent post and 3) when the message
is relevant indologically, why block them? With scholarly and/or
philological references. After all India is one billion people and
growing.
I fully understand the difficult role that Dominik has had to take,
initially he might not have thought so much work is involved here.
Our Founder has done a tremendous job, and hope that he'll
continue to handle Indology list. A committee, no doubt, has to
help him in the cutting up of membership priveleges.
