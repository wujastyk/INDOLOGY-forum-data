Response to S Bhatta <attahb@REDIFFMAIL.COM>
For what it's worth, I'd like to add that I see no reason whatsoever
why Steve should have to defend the value of his contribution as a
comparativist against the sort of know-nothing criticisms that have
been levelled here.
I too would like these attacks to desist.
