dvija varNa
In response to Yashwant Malaiya's comments -
You state that "Buddhism did not arise as a protest against the Brahmins but
because Siddhartha attained bodhi."
It may well be true that the Buddha's main goal was not to one of protest
against the Brahmins; however, the Vaaset.t.ha Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya
and the Dhammapada etc. clearly state that the Buddha did not believe that
one should be called a Brahmin by birth but by conduct.
I am quoting B. Nanamoli's translation (Vaaset.t.ha Sutta):
"One is not a brahmin by birth
Nor by birth a non-brahmin.
By action is one a brahmin,
By action is one a non brahmin."
Also, from the Dhammapada (385, Ross and Carter trans.)
For whom the farther shore or the nearer shore
Or both does not exist,
Who is free of distress, unyoked
That one I call a braahman.a
You also state the following: "Buddhist texts clearly convey the impression
that Brahmins were highly regarded (not because they were born so, but
because of their learning and conduct)".
The texts I have read merely state that someone should only be called a
Brahmin if they are of good conduct. This is a slightly different statement
that what you have said above, unless you are referring to other types of
statements than the ones I have quoted above.
You seem to be saying that the Buddha believed in the idea of Brahmin by
birth but did not respect them because of this, but rather, because of their
learning and conduct. In contrast, based on the scriptures I have quoted
above, I would argue that the Buddha (as quoted in the Pali Canon) did not
accept the caste system at all, as the caste system is something you are
born into.
