I think I agree with what I see as the spirit of this. The scientific study
of religion is good for certain types of analyses but somewhat limited when
it comes to interpreting religious ideas. If you grapple with an idea with
too much scholarly distance or in too "objective" a fashion, you begin to
ask the wrong kinds of questions.
However, as scholars and teachers, we are sometimes put into the position
where we have to give it our best shot: so, I empathize with the scholarly
plight at times too.
