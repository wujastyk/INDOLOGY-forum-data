Interested in the early Sanskrit attestations of KarnaaTa.
What are the texts in Sanskrit that we find KarnaaTa or KannaDa or
variants thereof?

In any case, the CilappatikAram attestation of karunATar and
possibly earlier (But what are those??) Skt. KarnATa
militate against R. Narasimhacharya's fanciful etymology
of KarnATaka from 'fragrance'.
