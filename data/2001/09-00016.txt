thanks and new question
Many thanks to Lars Martin Fosse, John C.Hungtindon and Geoffrey
Samuel for their answers to my query on early Indian bronzes.
Now I have one more question to my learned colleagues: does anybody
know any books or articles bearing on early Indian hand-mirrors
(except K. de B.Codrington, Ancient Indian hand-mirrors. - In: Man,
1929, No.130)?
Thanks in advance,
                                Ya.V.
