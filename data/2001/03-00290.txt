Subject: is the Gita dishonest?
Message-ID: <161227068545.23782.2172530429875506336.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Gita is certainly not totally consistent. The Gita could be called
dishonest if that inconsistancy was intended and could have been avoided.
However, exactly that is a human impossibility--on the matters with which
the Gita is concerned, human consistency is impossible. It follows that the
Gita is not dishonest in this.
Conversely, if the Gita were "dishonest", then I may add that a basic principle
of Greek tragedy would make it "dishonest", too:
the human condition of not being ABLE to decide and act right, even when
bitterly wanting to do so. There is a difference between man and the divine,
and no human knowledge and intent can bridge it. Nothing we theorize can be
totally consistent. Nothing we do can really be perfectly right.
What is dishonest would be to assume that when you remove the veil
you become god. In fact, isn't it exactly dishonest to claim to be able to
provide
a consistent view of the world. It seems a bit uninformed by now to expect a
consistent view of the world from the Gita or any other human attempt at
understanding the world...
