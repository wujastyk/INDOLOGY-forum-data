What next
I'd like to support Gunthard Mueller's suggestions, and second the idea of
himself as one of the Moderators.  As an additional Moderator, I'd like to
propose that we invite Vidyasankar Sundaresan to re-join us in that role,
if he can spare the time.  He is extremely knowledgeable and unfailingly
courteous, and I think would have the confidence of all members of the list.
