Old Russian words for linguist and linguistics
Kindly check this URL which discusses the synonyms for the word linguist in
different languages.
http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/5/5-1192.html
The old Russian word "Yazykoved" might interest the group. Any luck with
trying "yajna-kovid" or "yajnik-o-vedet"?
Also says the word for linguistics is "jazykoznanie". Is this 'yajnic
jnani"? :-)
Where is old Russian spoken, and how different it is from new? Any other
coincidence other than linguist?
Thanks in advance.
