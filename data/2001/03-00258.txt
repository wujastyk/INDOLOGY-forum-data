For hundreds of years the story of the Tower of Babel was sacrosanct, and
with it,as a corollary, the belief that Hebrew was the original language of
mankind. With the discovery of Sanskrit (1785 AD) by European scholars,
custodians of the Pentateuch were alarmed by the prospect that Sanskrit
would bring down the Tower of Babel. To anticipate the danger, they
pilloried Sanskrit as a priestly fraud, a kind of pidgin classic concocted
by Brahmins from Greek and Latin elements.Tower of Babel was huge ziqqurat
called E-temen-an-ki. In the highest story there was a great shrine. To the
south of Etemenanki was a complex of large and lofty buildings and vast
courtyards. There was the temple(E-sag-ila) of Marduk, the tutelary god of
Babylon and the supreme deity of the Babylonian pantheon since the reign of
Hammurabi (Amrephel).There used to annual celebrations of the Marriage of
the God.To me it looks like the temple complex of the south Indian style
where the entrance Gopura is sometimes taller than the main sanctuary of
the deity. When Cyrus the great conquered Babylon,all temples and deities
were saved intact. Cyrus the great prostrated in front of Marduk and burnt
incense.He promised Babylonians that their gods were his gods too.He made
Jews free and gave them money to build their temple on their return. Cyrus
the great knew the ancient world and respected the ancient traditions.Cyrus
the Great was Persian and not Turk.This is the difference between Arya and
Wolf. Thanks.
