Text layers in the Gita

I hope that in your translation you have translated verse 12:1 in such a
way that _avyakta_ refers to prak.rti, like in Saa:nkhya (which is how
Madhva sees it), and not to the nirgu.na brahman (as in Sankara's
view). See my article "Is Krishna Seen Or Not? Madhv?c?rya on
Bhagavadg?t? 12:1," Journal of Vaisnava Studies 5 (3) (1997), pp.
55-63. At the time, when I was studying Madhva, I found it highly
refreshing to see how also in India in the 13th century a theologian
could, through a critical reading of the text, turn to an older
historical layer for support of his innovative doctrine. And Madhva's
commentary is a nice, old example of how a later text can bring out the
original intent of an earlier one after that intent has been obscured
by another interpretation (in German I would say an 'Umdeutung' rather
than a 'Deutung') for a few centuries.
