In the Monier-Williams dictionary, Caturvarti is not present.

Wheel is gilgul in Sumerian > IE *kwe-kwl-o is said
to be related to Vedic cakra. Aryans have also borrowed
the term cakra that ultimately goes back to Mesopotamia.

Indian use of chakravartin is very late compared to
Naram-Sin. See the Jaggayapeta stupa panel of the
Cakravarti Rajah at Govt. Museum, Chennai which
is usually dated to First century BC. Published,
for example, Roy C. Craven, Indian art, Thames
& Hudson, p. 76.

Best wishes.

Naram-Sin(2291-2255 BCE) in his reign chose the path of war and, at
least for a while, was rewarded by success. To the title of 'King of
Agade', he could proudly add those of 'King of the four regions(of
the World)'(shar kibrat 'arbem) and 'King of Universe' (shar
kishshati). Here the word 'shar' means a king. Is not this title
similar to the title of the ancient Indian kings, namely Cakra-varti
Rajah or Catur(four)-varti Rajah? It appears that kibret means four
(Catur)and kishshati means Universe (Cakra-varti). [snip] Now the
Indian title Cakra-varti cannot be Dravidian because to the best of
my knowledge sound combination like 'Cr' as in Cakra does not
appear in Dravidian. So it appears that the title Cakra-varti was
brought to India by Aryans. In that case Dravidians who knew
Middle-east countries did not learn anything. It appears that they
simply were faceless traders without any kings or titles like
Cakra-varti Rajah. Could there be any explanation different from
this? Thanks.
