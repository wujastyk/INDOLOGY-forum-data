These are available:
Please see information on the Indology web site. Go to "Virtual Archive of
Indic etexts" page, then got to "Sanskrit Texts by Vedic Engineering," then
to "full details of texts, fonts, and software   available."

The basic font set is US$5 and needed word processor that runs in MS Word
(Best in version 95, but ok in newer versions) or stand-alone is US$30. Both
will be sent by email after receipt of payment. Be sure to see notes on how
to send money. (Do NOT send wire transfer!)

Word contains font sensitive search. To use it, type the word you want to
find with VedaPad and then paste it into search box and select font
sensitive and case sensitive.

This gives information about texts available, cost, and how to order. In
addition to these, I also have Monier Williams/Cappeller dictionary on
CD-ROM for $45 plus $5 shipping and handling. (Requires Windows 95/98)
