Fw: Sanskrit Vimilakirti
slightly--only slightly!!-- better photos of the VKN ms at:
http://www.asahi.com/culture/update/1214/003.html
According to the information circulated by Kazunobu MATSUDA, "The manuscript is
complete and consists of 79 palm leaves (6 x 30 cm). Its colophon says
that this was copied by Chandoka, Chamberlain of the King Gopala (750-770)
of the Pala dynasty."
However, concensus of scholars who have seen the photos in the web
site listed above (including Lore Sander), is that the ms dates to
the 11-12 c (paleographically), and the colophon (if read correctly)
was likely copied from its source.
This is truly an exciting discovery for Buddhist scholars-- a nice
belated Hanukha/early Christmas present.
