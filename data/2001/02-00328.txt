Muuriya/Muria also means buffalo, bull, strong man, just as
basava/vacavan2 in South Dravidian. Ultimately, mUriyar, buffalos,
and basavis are sacrifices in one sense.

In a thread, Proto-Siva started by me in 1996, I've been
educated by scholars including M. Rabe and M. Witzel.

Has anyone ever noted the similarity between the Proto-Siva on the
Indus seals and the Bison-horn Maria?  The headdress of the seated
figure is exactly like those worn by the Maria Gonds in Central India.
It is composed of bison horns with a long tuft of peacock feathers
between them.  Although these tribes now live in the jungles of
Central India, their ancestors probably lived all over the
sub-continent, perhaps even in the Indus Valley in the third
millenium B.C.>>
