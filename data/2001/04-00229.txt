Suggestion
This suggestion might be too late to implement.Instead of closing the list,
why not hold discussion on the list in the next week or so on the methods
to decrease signal to noise ratio. To control the volume to a manageable
size, the number messages per person per month could be reduced
considerably from the present number.
Next referring to the complaints that private emails are sent to the list
members insulting them, I would like to add such practice must be stopped
immediately. It serves no purpose.Archaeology has always surprised and
derailed the belief system people held dear to them. People from India are
destined to get shocks after shocks in future through the archaeological
excavations. Rioting, insulting and threatening each other is not the way
to handle the new information. It is the job of the Univesity professors in
the country and not of the roadside volunteers of the political parties of
India. How the Indian people will handle if tomarrow it was discovered that
both Hastinapur and Indraprastha were located west of Khyber pass? If you
do not like the views of a famous professor from the famous university in
the west, then create an equivalent chair in the Indian university, pay the
appropriate salary, collect the resources, collect your students instead of
sending them oversees and undertake the serious research.Keep digging in
the Indian soil to find new things.Thanks.
