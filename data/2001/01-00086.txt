poetry?>>
According to my informant, yes. Nathamuni is the
yogi-musician, the disciple of Nammalvar or
Shathakopa. He composed two texts: Nyayatattva and
Yogarahasya. The former is an extensive work on the
darshana's, Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta. Nathamuni's
grandson was Yamunacharya. There are many indirect
references to Yogarahasya, but apparently, the text is
lost.
