SV: "Bagger Vance" & Doniger on the Gita

America is a free society, and consequently people have the right to
discuss and criticize other people's religion. ("Right of free speech"). On
the other hand, as a Hindu disagreeing strongly with Doniger, YOU (or
anybody sharing your opinions) have the right to speak out against her, or
to write and publish a rebuttal, showing why you think she is wrong and
criticizing her views on Hinduism (you would of course have to find a
publisher or newspaper willing to print your rebuttal). Drexel university
was not required to have a "counterspeaker". There are countless venues for
debate and statements in a free society, from the simple soap-box to the
university hall or newspaper front page. Any theme such as Doniger's can be
reiterated and redebated anywhere in society. Your challenge is to do this
in such a manner that you convince.
And incidentally: I rather like the Gita, and prefer it to the upanishads.
So Doniger and I would not see eye to eye on this.
