the British and Devanagari (Was: Urdu, Hindi, and Sanskrit)
Allen W Thrasher <athr at LOC.GOV> has written as follows:
I have not heard about British printing any works in Sanskrit in any script
but which other script could have been used?
British army did print their documents in Roman script.
Have a peaceful and joyous day.
