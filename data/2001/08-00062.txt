URLs for a Hinduism course
Dear Madhav,
some links are listed on the Hompage of our Dept.:
http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/IND/links (click first "Religion allg.", then "Hinduismuslinks")
As far as I remember, more such links could be found on Gudrun B?hnemann?s Homepage and on
http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/fiindole.htm#Religionen
Best greetings and wishes
Axel
