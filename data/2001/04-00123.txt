Credibility of Criticism (Re: NEW: Pythagoras Theorem )
of
Dear Toke Lindegaard Knudsen,
Staal explains the geometrical insights of BaudhAyana's ShulbasUtra through
the language of modern algebra in "Greek and Vedic Geometry", Journal of
Indian Philosophy, vol. 27, Nos. 1/2, 1999, 105-127. You may also like to
have a look at Axel Michaels, Beweisverfahren in der vedischen
Sakralgeometrie, 1978, Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner, (in German) where the
teachings on geometry of various ShulvasUtras are explained in detail.
Sincerely,
Birgit Mayer-K?nig
