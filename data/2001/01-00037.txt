Harappan people.it gives the suggestion that some
harappan people were there when Aryans migrated into
India, they termed them as Panis  based on their
profession (trade was the main profession of harappan
people).It is logical to think so.
Regarding the Oral Tradition in ancient India i have
an observation to make.
as i said earlier the Rgvedic people might have been
in contact with harappan people, thats why they
developed the oral tradition in contrast to their
enemies who had a developed writing system. though
many scholars tried to derive that the Rgvedic people
know writing from vague references, it remains a fact
that vedic people were not well versed with writing.
they might have tried to hide their texts, beliefs
etc., from their enemies (probably harappan people)by
maintaining oral tradition.
i invite your opinion on this
