On the other hand, if the British had systematically stopped Indians from
printing the classics (after all, there were laws restricting the ownership
of printing presses in Company days, if not during the Crown Raj; goverment
control of means of communication seems still remain close to the hearts of
bureaucrats and politicians), would the script staying Nagari made any
difference?
After all, all these classics had to be edited from manuscripts which were
in various scripts at different stages of their history. Those who used
printed works, I suspect, would have learnt a systematic romanization in
short order. Those who actually produce printed editions from manuscripts
will need speicalized training, just as they do now. And not having to
squint at the conjunct letters to make them out properly is payback enough.
