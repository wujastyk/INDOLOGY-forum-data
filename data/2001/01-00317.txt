Only in India does anything to do with Sanskrit evoke a
negative response in the hands of know-it-all commentators.
American universities have a humanities and social science
requirement, every term, for science and engineering majors.
Courses offered typically include Chinese, Japanese, French
and Russian languages, in addition to psychology, economics,
philosophy etc. Nobody complains about aerospace technology
in old Chinese texts or about nuclear engineering in French.
The IITs have only a few required courses for freshmen, and
two elective courses for seniors. What is so very wrong with
offering an elective on nyAya and other Indian schools, when
the IITs already offer elective courses on Aristotle, Hegel,
Kant and Russell?
