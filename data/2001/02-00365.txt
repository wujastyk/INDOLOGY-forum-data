dharmapada (Sanskrit cribs for Pali texts)
Dear List:
I must plague the list, alas, with an undergraduate question.
Pali is not taught at the University of Toronto anymore.  I have begun to
look at Pali myself, and am trying to get the hang of the phonetic
changes.  But it would be much easier if there were Sanskrit translations
of Pali texts that I could use, especially editions that pair the Sanskrit
and Pali.  I seem to remember reading that there was some translation of
at least basic Pali texts into Sanskrit (I know I have heard of a
'_dharmapada_').  Professor Stella Sandahl, this university's lone
Sanskrit professor, says she doesn't know of any such translations.  I
have yet to hear from Prof. Leonard Priestley, who as an expert in Indian
Buddhism may know of texts Stella has not heard of.  In the meantime, is
anybody on the list able and willing to tell me of texts and editions of
this sort?
Much thanks.
P. Ernest
