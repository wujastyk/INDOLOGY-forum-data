Dear List,


Can anybody help me with the following verse which is 2.5.9ab of the Gopal
Narayan and Sons edition (Bombay 1892) of the Ga.nezapuraa.na.  I have
checked Books 3, 12 and 13 of the MBh and a p?da Index of Manu.  Somehow it
rings a bell, but it cannot locate another instance of it.

pati.m vinaa na caanyaasti gati.h sadyo.sitaa.m prabho

Thanks,


Greg Bailey
