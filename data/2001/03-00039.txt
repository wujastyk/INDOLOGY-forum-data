Is it a threat or a plea for insanity?
So, according to your/Taleban logic,
1. Taleban clocks/communication system are nine years slower than the rest

2. Talebans have real trouble in distinguishing from one kind of kafir from
another
3. Buddhists in Sri Lanka/Myanmar/Thailand can demolish any Islamic
structure in 2010 as a retaliation for the blown up Bamiyan Buddhas
4. To get a solution for Chechniyan issue, plant three powerful bombs in

5. Next to pass the flute-note to Indonesia, and set ?bonfire? on Buddhist &
Hindu architectures with  reasons rooted on last century East Timor riots
