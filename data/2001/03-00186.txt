Surely,Gita's place in the history of world civilization cannot depend on testimonial from an individual, university, media,or a country.It would be ironical if those who adhere to Gita's philosophy take umbrage at its being variously interpreted.After all, in the pre-war days Krishna with his philosophy that would go into Gita happily coexisted with Arjuna who thought otherwise .
