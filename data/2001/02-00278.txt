Hindi
Since this thread has already been pronounced to have run its
due course, I'll limit myself to saying only this much -
Co-opting the opposition, in order to disarm it, is a standard
strategy adopted by the world's politicians. A particularly
successful one, in many places. It is always pragmatism that
wins over rigid ideology. In the USA, one aspect of this gains
respectability, in the name of "bipartisanship".
Secondly, Hindi language policy has never been decided by any
Hindu right-wing leader. If those who are secular-minded can
only see conspiracy theories everywhere, even within the ranks
of those who introduced the word secular into the Indian
Constitution, need one wonder why there has been a backlash
to bring the real right-wing leaders into power? I presume,
Rohan, you would not be able to see any difference between
me and those who really support the VHP. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. But if a mere liking for the Sanskrit
language means that I am with the "Sanghis", so be it.
Best,
Vidyasankar
