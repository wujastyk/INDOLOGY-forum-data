I think India's business and technology community may have more prosaic
reasons for rejecting Sanskrit: money. There is not much money-making to be
had from Vedic mathematics or any other part of India's ancient science
history. Old knowledge, in India as elsewhere, is simply obsolete or
superseded. What matters, all the time, is new knowledge, the latest stuff.
If you want to hang on, that will take most of your time. Old knowledge are
for historians of various kinds. Interesting enough, but not exactly a
money-making machine.

I don't think there will be much success with the business/technology
community. But the future will tell!

All the best,
