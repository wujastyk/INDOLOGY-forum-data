"Hinduism is full of garbage, and it will be a task of generations to
clean it all out" -- this is a paraphrase of something that Dadaji
Pandurang Shastri Athavale has often repeated.  No Hindu I know takes
offence at it, because Dadaji has spent his life teaching bhakti, on the
basis of the Gita, to uplift people's lives. (See www.swadhyay.org.)

There are similar criticisms from Mahatma Gandhi, Vivekananda, and many,
many others.  Very rarely have Hindus been offended by these.

The reason is that these leaders are seen to be working for the Indic
Tradition, for the uplift of Hindus.  The criticism is to energize Hindus,
not to denigrate them, destroy them or to impose an alien ideology.

The authority to criticize arises from participation and practice
(exactly like learning Gita or learning physics).  Knowledge of the ancient
language of religious texts is not sufficient to give any weight. It is
incorrect to say that Hindus cannot take criticism; from one who loves
them, they will accept anything.
