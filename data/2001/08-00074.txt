Hello Christian,

            In the past, I have purchased VHS versions of several old
Marathi films from Mr. Mohan Ranade's
                                    Neelam Audio & Video, Inc
                                    13003 Trina Drive
                                    Philadelphia, PA 19116-1813
                                    (215) 969-1232.
If the films you are looking for are available for distribution in any
form, Mr. Ranade should be able to help you locate them.
