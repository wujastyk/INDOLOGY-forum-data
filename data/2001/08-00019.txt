Subject: HINDI version of Frontline paper
Message-ID: <161227069544.23782.9084135679460928615.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Steve Farmer and I are happy to announce that our "Horseplay" piece in
Frontline of Oct. 13, 2000 has now also been published in HINDI, by Sahmat,
New Delhi.

This piece  exposes N Jha's and NS  Rajaram's fantasy "decipherment" of the
Indus script  (e.g,  "100 noisy crows"!) and the closely linked horse seal
fraud (featuring a "translation" of the half-bull-turned-horse seal
inscription that allegedly refers to a horse!).

The Hindi version is available at the following URL as pdf file.

Enjoy!
