Khambesvari puujaa with Buffalo sacrifice
Dr. Hodge wrote:
Human sacrifice was fairly widespread in both space and time.
"Human beings were sacrificed on the stone by cutting through theit
necks and separating the head from the body. The bodies
were kept together at one place, but the three heads were
picked up and arranged in the form of a hearth.
Food was cooked on this hearth."

Anthropos 50:577-92)
