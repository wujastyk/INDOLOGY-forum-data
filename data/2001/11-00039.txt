Subject: The evil eye in Skt literature?
Message-ID: <161227069962.23782.2780389052142377084.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Prof Hart,

Since you mentioned the evil eye,  I write to ask you about its
terminological provenance in Sanskrit  literature because it would be so
helpful for my work to have some explicit references (I'm an anthropologist
specializing in south Asia studies but not a Sanskritist.) . If this inquiry
threatens to be bothersome, please don't mind and just tell me.  But I am oh
so curious--

Good wishes
Joanna Kirkpatrick
