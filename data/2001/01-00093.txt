Raveen Satkurunathan"--Many South Indian derived Sinhalese coastal castes
in Sri Lanka namely Karave---claim that they are descendants of Kurus of
Mahabharat fame...". I do not know connection between Karave and Kuru is
based on true tradition or just based on phonetic similitude. I know
however that Kurus and Kambojas in the past did reach Shri Lanka as
attested by the presence of these name in the ancient cave inscriptions of
Lanka.The Rajput queen Padmini who prefered fire to the capture of
Allauddin Khilji was the princess of Lanka from the princely family related
to the ancient Kambojas. The Sinhelese believe their connection to the
north-west of the Indian sub-continent.And the ancient names of states of
Gujarat, Maharashtra,and Karnatak were different. The ancient name of the
Jog fall(near Sharvati) from Karnatak state is available. All this
information project pre-history of India different from the one we are told
to accept without questioning.Thanks.
