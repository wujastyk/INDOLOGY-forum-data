Subject: New interpretation of Yoga Suutra
Message-ID: <161227067103.23782.15238458296164361460.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,

I have just completed a new interpretation of
Samaadhi Paada of YS.

The interpretation is radically different
from established tradition and
is the result of application of
cognitive psychology and generative semantics
to the MS.

I hope it will be of interest to people interested in:
 - interpretation of Sanskrit MSS or
 - etimology of Sanskrit words or
 - semantics or
 - cognitive psychology perspective on yoga.

The text of the interpretation is at
http://www.theasis.net/


Best regards, Dmitri.
