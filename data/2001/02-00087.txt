New interpretation of Yoga Suutra
Dear Indologists,
I have just completed a new interpretation of
Samaadhi Paada of YS.
The interpretation is radically different
from established tradition and
is the result of application of
cognitive psychology and generative semantics
to the MS.
I hope it will be of interest to people interested in:
 - interpretation of Sanskrit MSS or
 - etimology of Sanskrit words or
 - semantics or
 - cognitive psychology perspective on yoga.
The text of the interpretation is at

Best regards, Dmitri.
