Our library has the third ed. (Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1920), which is an
anastatic reprint of the 2nd ed. In the preface, Deussen says that he has
changed only a few things, a few corrections here and there and some
additions in the references. But he claims that the work remained
essentially the same (Roman pages ix-x).

All the best
