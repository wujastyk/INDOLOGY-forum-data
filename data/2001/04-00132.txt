Guest-professorship at Vienna University (Tibetan and/or              Buddhist               Studies) (fwd)
I think it is worth correcting that what is no doubt meant is "teach
IN German"....  (although anyone who could read the message would
know this).  Let us just assure our members who cannot read German
that at least such a post in Vienna has not (yet) been reduced to a
post teaching something more "useful"....
