cEtu 'calf' and cEtA(=kaRRA) 'calf-cow'
In sangam and post-sangam literature, it appears that
cEtu is used to mean 'calf' and cEtA (= cEtu + A)  means
'cow with a calf'. The other parallel term for 'cow with a calf'
is kaRRA (=kan2Ru + A). Even today in districts like Dharmapuri
and Coimbatore, village farmers use the word, cEtA to mean
'cow with a calf'.
Of course, cEtu has another well-known meaning which is 'red'.
For example: a) cEtAmpal 'red water-lily',
b) cEtAram 'scarlet ixora'. The scarlet ixora flower is
also called 'ceccai, cintUram' connected to 'red' as well.
Consider the word, cEy = 1) 'red' 2) 'child, youth'.
Comparing with a similar pair (pEy/pEtu),
pEy = pEtu = 'confusion, frenzy, madness',
cEy and cEtu are equivalents. cEtu, like cEy, will
then have basically two meanings: 1) 'red'
