Yes, errata have been online since shortly after first publication.  But
I only mention some of the major points, not every typo.  And in a
burst of activity when I was doing the revision last year, I came up
with quite a few more things which I have not bothered to add to the
online errata, I'm afraid.

There's no way you can avoid buying another copy, or two or three... :-)
