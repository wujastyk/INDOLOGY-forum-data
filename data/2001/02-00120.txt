(vAsa "garment" from vas "to wear") ready". From the first rhetorical
treatises, the vAsakasAjja is openly described as very similar to a veshya,
exactly because she is waiting a lover (not a husband!) in her vAsagrha
("bed chamber"), or has very beautiful clothes (vAsa). As far as we now,
from the antiquity a woman who is waiting in an habitation is suspected to
be
a prostitute; it is very different in the western etymology of "prostitute",
which comes from Latin pro-stat, "to put the foot outside (the house)"
so that the customers can see her.  This is only a curiosity!
