I  would  not like  to debate  with the  likes of RohitChopra and
RohanOberoi,  based on the emails they have sent on other forums.
It  is  no  small  wonder that  SAJA  [http://www.saja.org]  gets
criticised as a pseudo-secular-leftist organisation by many.
I  consider it a waste of my time, waste of online resources, and
wasting others' too, in debating with these two in particular.
The reason(s)
1. I am reminded of a proverb -
1000 men may lead a horse to a pond of water but none cannot make
it drink.
2. Many elders advice thus : one should either know by oneself or
atleast  by learning  or from others. if not, this person is just
useless  /  unchangeable.  -  in  tamil,  it  goes  as  "thanakkA
theriyaNum,  illaiya sollith  theriyaNum,  irandum illaiya,  ithu
thirunthAtha jenmam thAn".
Hope this suffices. Learned members of this list would understand
the above proverb and its usage in this context.

Given that the book is pregnant with factual errors such as
the ones discussed, it becomes necessary to ask if Margolis
can see straight, let alone think straight.
And how is the book released? To rave reviews.
How is the author of this tome rewarded? Well, he wins the
SAJA ( South Asian Journalists Association) Award for his
writing on India.
