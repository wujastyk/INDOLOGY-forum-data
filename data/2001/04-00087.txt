tyaja dharmam etc.
Dear List:
At the end of his article Sex and Yoga, J.M. (then J.L.) Masson quotes this
shloka:
tyaja dharmamadharmaM ca tyaja satyamasatyaM vaa
satyaasatye ubhe tyaktvaa yena tyajasi tattyaja
and gives no reference for it, presumably because it is so famous that it needs
none.  But I need one.  Where is it from?
