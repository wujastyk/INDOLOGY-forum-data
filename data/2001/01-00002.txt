Is it so? Can you give me an example of just one temple in South India
where this change in priesthood has occurred in the recent times? It has
always been an one way traffic from non-brahminized to brahminized customs
and priests. Classical example is Pazhani Muruhan temple.
Often enough, your postings are bordering politics (especially the present
day one of rewritng/revisionist Hindutva politics). I can understand and
appreciate an occasional one; but not so regular.  I don't know what is
your agenda.  If we start countering your points one by one, and you reply
in continuum, then we would be discussing politics and not Indology thus
deviating from the guidelines followed by the founder of this list. Hence I
refrain from doing that. (After all, this is 2001 beginning. Why start a
polemic?)
Hope you understand. The title of this thread is Dravidian Origins.
