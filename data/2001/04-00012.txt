New EJVS: WESTWARD HO! Talageri's Rgveda...
I am glad to announce another  issue of the
ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF VEDIC STUDIES
Vol. 7 (2001), issue 2 (March 31)      (143 k)
This issue deals, in some length, with a recent book aiming at "A
Historical Analysis" of the Rgveda.
Its author also  claims to have "invincibly"  shown
"...that India was the original homeland of the Indo-European family of
languages  ... based primarily on Puranic sources.   [here] ... we examine
in detail the actual data within the Rigveda. ...   far from contradicting
or disproving the theory put forward by us in our earlier  [1993] book,
this detailed analysis of the Rigveda emphatically confirms our theory. "
Let's see!
Read also ( Ed.'s Note) on some interesting Hindutva invectives, threats
and strong-arm tactics  aimed at intimidating legitimate research on the
Vedas ...
