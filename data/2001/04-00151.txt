Thank you for your reply.  I am familiar with the two references you
mention.  Both are indeed valuable, but Professor Staal does not
discuss the question of whether Baudhaayana's formulation of the
Pythagorean theorem can be interpreted to include other figures
than squares in his "Greek and Vedic Mathematics" article, and I
do not think Professor Michaels discuss this either.

With best wishes,
