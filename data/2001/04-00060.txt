This phrase "pulam puri antaNAr" occurs in pariPATal 6.  There it
stands for Vedic brahmins (the threaded variety) and not, I submit,
"the cool priests chanting/doing magic spells". The commentary is
unambiguous on this point - "maRaiyai virumpum antaNAr"
(ParimElazakar). UVS, in fact, gives a cross ref to pariPATal 1:46
wherein parimElazakar explains why the word "pulam" stands for

spot and there's an editor's ellipsis right in the middle of this
sentence. However, UVS as editor, gives in his notes the identity
"pulam - vEtam" in this context as well as in the locus under
discussion viz., pari 6:45.
