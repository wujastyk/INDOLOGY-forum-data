This phrase "pulam puri antaNAr" occurs in pariPATal 6.  There it
stands for Vedic brahmins (the threaded variety) and not, I submit,

sentence. However, UVS as editor, gives in his notes the identity
"pulam - vEtam" in this context as well as in the locus under
discussion viz., pari 6:45.
ParimElazakar, though his commentary is after a millennium  or so
later, is possibly right about paripATal 6:45 where "pulam" could be
the Veda. OTOH, it's certain that "pulam puri caGkam" in maNimEkalai
