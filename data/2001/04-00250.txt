Heartfelt thanks
Dear Dominik,
My profound thanks to you and the learned contributors to this 
list. It has been my daily joy and sustenance for some years now. I 
understand your position having monitored a list on Ayurveda 
myself but, my heart for one will jump for joy, should you 
reconsider or find a way to keep the list alive. Many blessings in 
any case.
Hari Om!
Swami Shivananda Sarasvati D.Ay.
