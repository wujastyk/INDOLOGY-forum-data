Govala/Golla and tamil KOvalar tribes

The sangam tamil term for herdsmen, kOvalar is not likely shown
to be from Skt. gopAla.
Tamil "kOvalar" means people of the raised country -
mullai and kuRiJci landscapes, and they are not from the 'marutam'
riverine delta lands where farmers belong. Compare the parallels
and synonyms for herdsmen: Tamil kuRumpar (=Ka. kurubaru),
kOn2Ar, etc. have to do with hillocks, raised country, and
kOvalar is related with kOn2Ar, kuRumpar - meaning
hill-folk.
MalaipaTukaTaam tells the kOvalar, kuRavar connection
explicitly: "kOvalar kuRavaroTu oruGku iyaintu Arppa".
VaLLi, Muruhan's love is a kuRatti, the daughter of
the hill country in mythology.
The Kongu country, full of hills and Western ghats,
has a subdivision, kuRumpar country.
"koGkil kuRumpil kurakkut taLiyAy" (Cuntarar Tevaram).
kuRumpar, kuRavar, kOn2Ar, kOvalar: all have semantics
to do with "hills".
In Tamil, cOttikam < skt. svastika; tam. cOti < skt. svAti.
Parallel: gvaala <  goala (Risley, 1908) < tam. kOvala,
can we call it a back-formation?
I know "iTaikazi" as a passage in homes, temples and
as well as in Sangam poetry. PaTTin2appAlai:
" kuRu toTai neTu paTikkAl
  koTu tiNNai pal takaippin2
  puzai vAyil pOku iTaikazi
  mazai tOyum uyar mATattu "
Here obviously "iTaikazi" is the passage just as in
our AzvAr legends.
I don't know where iTaikazi is attested as the *earlier*
name of "kOval"/"kOvalUr"?. Do you know any instance?
Definitely it's not in sangam poetry. kOval attestation examples:
a) tuJcA muzavin2 kOval kOmAn2 (akam)
b) muraN miku kOvalUr nURi nin2 (puRam)
This well attested town name kOval from sangam times
cannot be from skt. gopAla for sure.
Compare kOval with other village names:
cikkal, cuziyal, cEynjal, nAval, marukal, mAkaRal, paRiyal, jnAzal, ...
LS wrote once:
Like Tamil iTaiyar, Gollas of the Deccan and further
North are related to Telugu gorre 'sheep' and
tamil koRi, koRRi (sheep, cow).
I believe neither the tamil town name "kOval" nor the herdspeople,
'kOvalar' come from skt. gopAla.
