'Panis' - The Indus People
hello friends,
You might have heard about the Rg Vedic tribe "Panis"-
With whom the Divine Dog "Sarama" had a discussion.
the discussion is in Rgveda it self.
My question is
"can the PANIS be identified with the  people of
Harappan  civilisation???"
Panis were discribed as trading people in Rgveda. they
were also described as wealthy people.they were also
regarded as Dasas.
The above description suits the harappan people.
The word for trade in sanskrit- 'VaaniJya' is derived
from the root 'Pan'
Now, in dravidian languages also the root 'Pan' is
there. it means 'work' in dravidian languages.
i feel it meant 'trade' in ancient times and it took a
wider meaning in later times.
The name for trading community in western india-
'Baniyas' is also derived from the same root.
Now it is interesting to note that Gujarathis are
included in 'Pancha Dravidas'
