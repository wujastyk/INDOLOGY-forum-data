about congresses and so on
Dear Dr. Rosella,
    The International Institute for Asian Studies in Leiden, the
Netherlands, publishes the IIAS Newsletter (sent to all major Orientalist
institutions of Europe), in each number of which there is "International
Conferences Agenda" for a year ahead. You can also try the IIAS homepage:
http://www.iias.nl . I hope you will find it useful.
    Best regards,
Yaroslav Vassilkov
