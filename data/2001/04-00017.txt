d) From tamil words like tONi/toLai/tuNi > Skt. droNa
(vessel, archery master in the MBh).
K. Zvelebil, Tamil literature, E. J. Brill, 1975, p. 53
"It is obvious that the Sanskrit drAviDa, Pali damila, damiLo
and Prakrit dAviDa are all etymologically connected with
"tamizh" [48]
[48] The *r* in tamizh > drAviDa is a hypercorrect insertion,
cf. an analogical case of DED 1033 Ta. Ma. kamuku, Tu. kaGgu,
"areca palm"; Skt. kramu."
