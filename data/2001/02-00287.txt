Lhasa to Nalanda - journey time by foot
Dear Richard,
Thank you for the prompt reply.  The Free Library of Philadelphia apparently
has a copy.
So far as I have been able to determine, there is little or no information
about the route zaantarakSita may have followed.  He is generally thought to
have lived and worked at Nalanda, but one or both of the Tibetan accounts
situate him in "Nepal".  I have developed a somewhat naive notion that he
would have crossed the Kathmandu Valley on the way to Lhasa or environs from
Nalanda, but my knowledge of the geography of the regions involved is so
limited that I do not know what route or routes may have been established in
his time.

 I'm not sure of "Saantarak.sita's route but for that of Marpa the
 Translator you could consult pp. xxvii ff. of:
 @Book{trungpa:life,
   editor =       "Ch\"{o}gyam Trungpa",
   title =        "The Life of Marpa The Translator: Seeing Accomplishes
                  All",
   publisher =    "Shambhala",
   stitle =       "The Life of Marpa",
   year =         "1995",
   key =          "trungpa:1995",
   address =      "Boston \& London",
   note =         "a trans. of `Mar pa rnam thar' by Gtsang smyon He ru
                  ka (1452--1507) by the N\={a}land\={a} Translation
Committee
                  under the direction of Ch\"{o}gyam Trungpa",
 }
 His journeys seem to have been protracted for various reasons not
 the least of which would have been the difficulty of
 acclimatisation.
 Many regards,
  Richard Mahoney
