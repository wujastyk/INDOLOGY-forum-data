Subject: Syntax of action nouns
Message-ID: <161227067756.23782.4380514971064484390.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the Indology list!

I am looking for bibliographic references to books/papers that deal with
the syntax of nomina actionis and nomina agentis, particularly for
Indo-Iranian languages, but generally for Indo-European, too.

I'll be grateful to anybody who can help me!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
