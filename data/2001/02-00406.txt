Syntax of action nouns
Dear members of the Indology list!
I am looking for bibliographic references to books/papers that deal with
the syntax of nomina actionis and nomina agentis, particularly for
Indo-Iranian languages, but generally for Indo-European, too.
I'll be grateful to anybody who can help me!
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
