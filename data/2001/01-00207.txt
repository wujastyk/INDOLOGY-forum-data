Some questions on Asuras
Dear Satya Upadhyaya
Those were just some of my speculations. Some times I may sound overbearing
or oh-so-convincing as I was writing from my long time study (and
"practice") of the literature, I don't close out other possibilities. Until
we have all pieces of the puzzle in place nothing is final.
Best,
Bhadraiah
