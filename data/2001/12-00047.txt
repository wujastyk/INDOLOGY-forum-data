Query: Did classical Indian philosophers revise their works?
Although not belonging to the category of philosophical works, there is another
and apparently clear instance of an author having revised his own work, namely
Kalhana. By a considerable change of a passage in the 8th Taranga of his
Rajatarangini the transmission of mss of this new version, differing from
an/the earlier one(s), seems to have been caused.
See on this B. K?lver, Textkritische und philologische Untersuchungen zur
Rajatarangini des Kalhana. Wiesbaden 1971: pp. 61; 79ff.
