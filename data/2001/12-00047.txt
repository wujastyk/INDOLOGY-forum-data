Subject: Query: Did classical Indian philosophers revise their works?
Message-ID: <161227070085.23782.584484096086478600.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Although not belonging to the category of philosophical works, there is another
and apparently clear instance of an author having revised his own work, namely
Kalhana. By a considerable change of a passage in the 8th Taranga of his
Rajatarangini the transmission of mss of this new version, differing from
an/the earlier one(s), seems to have been caused.

See on this B. K?lver, Textkritische und philologische Untersuchungen zur
Rajatarangini des Kalhana. Wiesbaden 1971: pp. 61; 79ff.
