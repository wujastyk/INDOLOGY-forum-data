is the Gita dishonest?
Not many people/scholars would mind the statement that there are passages in
the Gita which (at least from certain perspectives) may seem to be mutually
inconsistent, even contradictory. Many may even agree with this statement
which has been made by others before.
But to call the work <dishonest> is unnecessarily provocative, attributing
sinister, petty, and unethical motives to the author(s), in order to mislead
the readers.
This is what I (and perhaps many others) found offensive.
