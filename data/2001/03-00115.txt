SV: An article mentioning History of Science
An interesting web-page with info. on Seidenberg's ideas :
http://math.truman.edu/~thammond/history/AbrahamSeidenberg.html
E.g.,
Abraham Seidenberg advanced a theory that mathematics arose from a common
origin, and that some the mathematics was preserved by an oral tradition, and
very likely a religious tradition, perhaps one like the one seen in the
Indian Sulvasutras.
....
It is common to argue that counting and other elementary mathematics arose
spontaneously throughout the world in response to a practical, or perhaps
psychological, need. Abraham Seidenberg argues instead for a diffusion
theory, that counting arose only once, and then spread throughout the world.
etc.
