R: Books for self-instruction in Classical Literary Tamil
Dearest colleague, You can try to find both books and sites in the Web Page
of the Department of Oriental Studies of Roma's University (Italy), written
both in Italian and in English:
http://pop.let.uniroma1.it/DSO/links/dsolink.htm
http://pop.let.uniroma1.it/DSO/links/dsosrch.hts (search engines).
About Your studies, I may contact some Italian Professors and ask to them an
advice (I am too a sanskritist).
If You want, You can write directly to me.
Sorry, it is a little help!
Love,
Daniela
