Dear Dominik,

Could I ask you to put the following up on Indology? Thanks.

                            ------------

I have placed two new programs on my website: pc2mac and mac2pc. These
are utility programs to allow people to transfer Word documents using
"private" character encodings such as Norman or CSX+ between PCs and
Macintoshes. At present such documents are garbled in the transfer, as
Word assumes that each file is in the native encoding of the source
machine, and translates it to the native encoding of the destination
machine.

The programs, and a README file explaining how to use them, can be
found by connecting to http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk and then
following the links "programs" => "pc2mac".

John Smith
