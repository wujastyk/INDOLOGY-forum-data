Upgrade to Prof. Yano's web-based Pancanga program
Prof. Yano's extraordinarily useful and sophisticated web-based tool for
calculating various Indian eras and dates is located at
        http://www.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/index.html
Prof. Yano has written to announce an upgrade to the program, and he has
most generously made his algorithms publicly available.

Dear Dominik,
I have been working for upgrading the Perl version of pancanga
program.
There are several new features as you will see.
I have decided to make the source script of the perl version
open to the public.
[...]
I will appreciate if you announce about our new version.
With best wishes,
