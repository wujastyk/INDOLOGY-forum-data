Dear colleagues !

Please, visit my new variant of epigraphy publication -
Early Kadamba Inscriptions, which for the first time I place on my page
http://indepigr.narod.ru/index1.htm  (later it will be publicated by
Oriental
Institute). Be sure, download new version of ttf-font before. All your
opinions (as about this publication, as about usualness of this type
publications), remarks, advices and recommendations will be
helpful and very interesting for me.
Here I place, too, english translations of 2 my articles, "Texts of
Political tradition and Early Kadamba inscriptions" and "Socio-political
structure of early society and state as it reflected in Sanskrit
inscriptions from Nepal", which can be interested for Indologists.
