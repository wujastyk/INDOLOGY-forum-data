Rigveda: A Historical Analysis - By Shrikant Talageri
Here is a link to the online version of Shrikant Talageri's
new book.
==========================================================
The book "Rigveda: A Historical Analysis" (Delhi, 2000)
by Shrikant Talageri is now available online at
http://www.voi.org/books/rig/
Apparently a few minor errors of proof-reading
(of the scanned text) are
there which should hopefully be corrected soon.
Sincerely,
Vishal Agarwal
