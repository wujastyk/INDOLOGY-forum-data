Subject: question
Message-ID: <161227068144.23782.1546806526014631999.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

This question should be answerable by a consultation of an
encyclopedia, a world almanac, or a visit to your university or public
library.  It is an easy one by that route but on the other hand it
will be pure chance if any on the list know it offhand and by memory,
as they might what is the best book in English on the karma doctrine,
or the best in French on Indo-Aryan origins.

Sincerely,

Allen W. Thrasher
