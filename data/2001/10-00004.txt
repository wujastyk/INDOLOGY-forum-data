Subject: experience in buying Indian manuscripts
Message-ID: <161227069787.23782.2525342739929607348.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

If any person or institution has any recent experience in buying
significant number of Indian manuscripts, either Devanagari or Tamil,
from sources outside the subcontinent, could they please contact me
off the list?  I need guidance with reference to what are reasonable
values for tax deductions.  It is primarily a question of
unillustrated mss, not of illustrated ones that would be in the usual
art market.

Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
