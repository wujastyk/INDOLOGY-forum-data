Hebrew
I am afraid I have to eat humble-pie here. I should have checked the
biblical text instead of relying on my obviously mistaken memory. The Bible
only says that men spoke the same language, and that God confused them so
that they shouldn't become too powerful.
but
Here, I am afraid that I fell prey to that very tempting European sport
called "tease the Americans" :-). (You know, America, that vast nation of
country bumpkins). I suppose I should apologize for that - there may be
sensitive souls on the list. The bottom line is that your description of
attitudes in American churches apparently matches my own description of the
attitudes of the Norwegian churches completely. So together, we have
hopefully killed the idea that Hebrew is regarded as the world's first
language by Christians.
Best regards,
