Bhagavadgita 12.1
I follow neither commentator -- nor even Ramanuja, though his
interpretation is, in my opinion, generally more consistent with the tone
of the text. As for the passage you mention, I have translated ak.saram
avyaktam with 'det of?rg?rbara, oformade'. In my notes I have relied on the
internal consistency which I see in the text, relating the list of
attributes in 12.1-3 (ak.sara, anirdezya, avyakta, sarvatraga, acintya,
kuu.tastha, acala, dhruva) to such passages as 2.24-25 and 15.16 (nitya,
sarvagata, sthaa.nu, acala, sanaatana, avyakta, acintya, avikaarya ...
ak.sara, kuu.tastha). To me it seems clear that they refer to the
individual self, as opposed to prak.rti or iizvara.
I will read your JVS article with pleasure. My views are presented in the
current issue of the same journal (or so I'm told -- I haven't seen it yet).
