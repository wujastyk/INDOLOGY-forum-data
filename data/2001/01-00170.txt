Some questions on Asuras
Dear listmembers,

I can see some difficulties in measuring "the level of abstraction of
theistic concepts" at different times, and names like Artadama (if from
Rta-dhaman) in the fourteenth century BC would reveal some degree of
abstraction among Indo-Aryans already in the second millennium. Also, in
the Ancient Near East, abstractions (as well as physical objects, for
instance a kinna:ru at Ugarit!) were regarded as gods and received
offerings. In this connection I would like to remind my readers of the
difficult interpretation of "the gods Midra$$el" and "the gods
Uruwana$$el/Aruna$$el" in the treaty between a Hittite and a Hurrian king.
It is very strange that Mitra and Varuna have received Hurrian abstract
suffixes here. Was this a Hurrian innovation, or did it correspond to
something that already existed in Indo-Aryan? In Onofrio Carruba's paper,
which I have discussed earlier, he cites Gernot Wilhelm, who suggests that
we should regard the expressions as denoting "die Vertragsnumina als ein
evtl. konkretisiertes Abstraktum... das wie ein Kollektiv behandelt wird".
Carruba himself says (p. 64-65): "Wenn wir uns die urspruengliche Bedeutung
beider Goetterbezeichnungen und ihre Eigenschaften ins Gedaechtnis
zurueckrufen, so heisst mitra- "Vertrag, Buendnis", und der Gott gilt als
Vertragsbeschuetzer; bei Varuna ist die Bedeutung noch unsicher, scheint
aber auf "Wahrheit" und auf den vor allem bei Vertraegen sie beschuetzenden
"Schwur"... hinzudeuten."
What has happened, then, is that the abstractions "treaty, alliance" and
"truth", as qualities of Mitra and Varuna, have been deified. This is
indeed remarkable, but there are some parallels in other Hurrian texts.
2.  > In any case, the demonization of the gods of bordering
In the Ancient Near East of the second millennium, foreign gods were as a
rule respected and highly regarded. They could even be brought back to the
city of a conqueror and venerated there.
The demonization of the daevas is regarded by Manfred Hutter as a somewhat
gradual  phenomenon, particularly strong in post-islamic times. According
to Hutter, Zarathustra was not a monotheist; Ahura Mazda is merely "an der
Spitze der Ahuras", and in OA "Ahura Mazda" is not even a fixed name at
Zarathustra's time. He says explicitly that "die feste Wendung "Ahura
Mazda" sich jedoch erst in jungavestischer Zeit als Eigenname durchgesetzt
hat". Hutter cites a plural form of Mitra used in Y. 46,5, mithroibiio
(strangely reminiscent of the Hurrian plural "Midra$$el"!), and comments
that Zarathustra in this way succeeded in avoiding the singular form, "die
lautlich mit dem Gottesnamen zusammenfaellt". Zarathustra does not like
Mitra, but he simply cannot get rid of him.
Hutter dates the arrival of the Medes in the Iranian plateau to about 1000
BC, and he thinks the Gathas were composed farther to the north before this
time. He notes that the name Assara Maza$ is mentioned in an Assyrian text
from the ninth or eighth century BC, and that the teachings would have
needed some time to spread to the Medes in the west. Archaeologically, the
use of horse-drawn chariots in the area east of the Aral Sea is known from
about 1600 BC, so the terminology of horses and horse races (in the Avesta)
could be very old. (By the way, horse-drawn chariots were used in warfare
in Anatolia in the eighteenth century, as attested in the Anitta text.)

I, too, would be very interested in George Thompson's views!
