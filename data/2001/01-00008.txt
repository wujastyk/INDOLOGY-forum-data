The Dravidian low caste women, especially in Kerala, not
(being allowed to)  wearing breast cloths is recorded in a
Telugu poem:

   Not entirely hidden,
   like the enormous breasts of those Gujarati women,
   and not open to view,
   like a Tamil woman's breasts,
   but rather,
   like the supple, half-uncovered breasts
   of a Telugu girl,
   neither concealed nor exposed:

   that's how a poem should be composed.
   Anything else
   is a joke.
