Rev. Pope's Tamil
Dear list:
I wonder if the list has any opinions about the value of the Rev. Pope's
(standard?) Tamil self-instruction text?  It is the only text I can find
here in Toronto that looks like it will be of any use to me.  A friend of
mine in Berkeley says he can send me the texts on modern and ancient Tamil
by the Harts.  I am not really very happy with the Pope book, and expect
the harts' books to be better.
P. Ernest
