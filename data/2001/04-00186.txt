Sanskrit causing problems in studies
Kathmandu Post Report
KATHMANDU, April 12 - Nepal Janajati and Adivasia Students' Assembly, an
association of indigenous nationalities and natives Thursday said they
encountered difficulties while persuing their education after the induction
of Sanskrit as a compulsory subject in the school curriculum.
Speaking at a meeting called by the Nepal Janajati-Adivasi Students'
Association, Ram Bahadur Thapa Mangar, President of the Association
said, "constitution says it has equal respect for all the peoples and
dialects but in practice there is huge gap between the preveleged Brahmins
and Janajatis."
They also demand that they need to be provided with text books in the
schools in their own indigenous dialect.
"Our plan is to mobilse students in the struggle for better education and
unite to fight all forms of discrimination," said Rajan Yonjon, General
Secretary of Nepal Janjati-Adivasi Students' Association.
Meanwhile, a press statement issued by the Nepal Tamang Ghedung said that
despite the recognition given to all the spoken languages by the 2047
Constitution, it has been discriminatory in practice.
A committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Sarbagya Ratna,
former Attorney General and chief Advocate which will press for its demand
in the upcoming Parliamentary meet, said the release.
