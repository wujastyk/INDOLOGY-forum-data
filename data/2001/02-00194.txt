Indology List:
In response to L. Cousins -
I don't think that I would use the word "absurd" to categorize Gombrich's or
anyone's attempt to capture the composition of the early sangha. It is an
attempt but admittedly not one that is faultless. I'm not sure that I was
labelling it "scientific", nor does Gombrich in his study.
Thanks for the information on the Digha Nikaya as the source for the
information about previous Buddhas. I didn't know that; however, I could
have done without the "of course".
