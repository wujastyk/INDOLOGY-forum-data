WorldCat  (OCLC FirstSearch)
Dear Lars,
   It is proprietary, and so restricted to universities and other
subscribers.  The URL is:
http://newfirstsearch.oclc.org/
You can read a description of the service there. WorldCat is valuable
because it provides bibliographic info for all major library holdings in
North America and Europe. This service is especially convenient if your
library has a link on their web site. You can then use it from an office
to order through interlibrary loan with ease. (No passwords, addresses,
etc.)
   There might be a "public" portal accessible via some obscure,
round-about route. If anyone knows of one  I think many independent
scholars would benefit.
best,
Tim Cahill
