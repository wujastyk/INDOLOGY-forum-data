Bhallatazataka
Dear Colleagues,
In Zachariae's edition of Mankhakoza, p. 60, regarding the cy to 454c
vaiyaap.rtyakaro bhogii, he refers to Bhalla.tazataka 37. I have at
hand the edition edited by Vedkumari Ghai and Rampratap (Delhi:
Meharchand Lachhmandas, 1985), and can find nothing relevant in verse
37 or elsewhere. What am I missing?
Thanks in advance for the help!
