N. Ganesan's original question:
>In Bengali, when is the name gosAyi first attested?
>Approximately like 16th century??
>Today, we hear both gosvAmi and gosAi.

The intent of this query was to find out when does sAi/ii,
gosAii is first used in North India. It appears 15-16th
centuries is a good estimate.

Hence, sAyaNa, a KannaDiga name of the 13-14th centuries
need not have saaii from gosaaii, a Northern form of some
centuries late.

At least it's not me who implied Tamil origin for gosvAmi.

Goswami is not found in early Vaishnava literature of Tamil.
