Axel Michaels edited book "The Pandit"
I agree. As an ddendum to the addendum I like to remark the following: It
is not justified to identify the term "pandit" with brahminhood? In fact,
one result of the conference and the book is to see how widely the term
was applied and that it was not at all restricted to Brahmins.
With many thanks for your apologies and best wishes,
Axel Michaels
