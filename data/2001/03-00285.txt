Question for the Kashmir Shaivism experts
Dear Mr Spier,
in fact Samvitprakasa and Atmasamstuti are most likely to be different titles of the same work. Or, to be more precise, Samvitprakasa is certainly the title of the first prakarana, which may have been then extended to the whole work. Each of the seven prakaranas which have come down to us probably also had a somewhat independent life of its own.
The verse you mention is not found in the MSS of the SP, but it is to be noted that the second prakarana, the context of which this verse would fit very well, had, according to the number recorded by the Srinagar MS, nineteen verses more than the 60 that have come down to us.  Thus it seems very probable that Atmasaptati is either a mistake for Atmasamstuti (which is the title of the second prakarana) or an approximate reference to the number of the verses (79) that composed it.
With best wishes,
