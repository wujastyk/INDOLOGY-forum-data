Panini inquiry : Some Suggestions

I am not sure it is possible to say with any confidence that any of the
grammarians referred to by Panini are from the NW region.  About the NW
region as the origin of grammatical thinking, I am not sure how one would go
about proving such a proposition.  In a forthcoming article by William
Malandra of University of Minnesota (in a volume that I am editing), he has
shown that there were Padapaa.tha like developments in the Avestan tradition
at some point.  The similarity, especially in splitting compounds, is so
remarkable, that this does seem to suggest a possible shared environment of
academic efforts in the NW region, a contact point for the Iranian and the
Vedic traditions.  Among the names of teachers cited by Panini,
Pau.skarasaadi (connected with Pu.skara?) and Zaakalya (connected with
Saagala, Sialkot?) may possibly be from the NW region.  It would be
interesting to see if the linguistic phenomena attributed to them have any
detectable NW linguistic features.  Best,
