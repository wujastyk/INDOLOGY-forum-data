Suresh,
Save your polemic. I am sure Dr Fosse can answer for himself.
As for your generalization about ALL Muslims:
THIS IS ONLY PROOF OF YOUR POOR LOGICAL SENSE. LAST I HEARD THERE WERE
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MUSLIMS IN THE WORLD. SO I WONDER HOW YOU, A
MUSLIM-HATER, CAN KNOW WHAT ALL - EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM BELIEVE IN.
WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE STATE OF ISLAM IN THE 7TH AND 8TH CENTURY? DO YOU EVEN
KNOW? YOUR POOR KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY HAS BEEN SHOWN UP AS WELL AS WELL AS
YOUR COMPLETE UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE KORAN.
Please respond to my mail on logical grounds instead of making apologetic,
genteel noises about "inappropriateness" and displaying prurient
vindication. Your mail has exactly the tone of apology of a colonized
type...
And for once, just for once, stop parroting the views of the RSS, and try
and debate beyond those crude stereotypes and bigotry.
Yours-in-appropriateness
Rohit
