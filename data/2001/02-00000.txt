Sanskrit/Udru/Hindi (Re: Did you hear this?)

It was indeed an elitist language, used largely by scholars for past
15, maybe 20 centuries. It could be called brahmanical because often
Brahmins specialized in it. But its use was not limited to the Brahmanic
(Vedic/Puranic) traditions, it was used by Buddhists and Jains, even
Sikhs.
Urdu, in its modern form (full for Farsi/Arabic words) was perhaps
introduced by Vali (1667-1707). It became popular as a replacement
of Farsi in Delhi. If You look at older forms of what is called "Urdu",
you will see a lot less Farsi/Arabic. The poetry of Amir Khusrow
is related to modern Hindi and not Urdu. Throughout much of India,
Sanskrit words are much more easily understood than Farsi/Arabic
ones.
There is a lot of old literature in Hindi that modern English-medium
educated Indians are unaware of.
You can take the works included in Adi Granth as an example of what
language was most easily understood, when it was compiled, in Punjab,
as well as much of North and central India.
