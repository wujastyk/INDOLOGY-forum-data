Dear Dr Iyer,
afraid I have to disagree with you on your etymology of Indo-European
*kwe-kwl-o- (unfortunately no way yet to represent the correct IE
transliteration characters on an HTML list).
This word is documented in many Indo-European branches far away
from Mesopotamia. It is generally considered to be of Indo-European
origin, formed according to a well-known IE system of Ablaut and
reduplication. The linguistic and areal spread of the word makes the
IE origins of this word the simplest model, and therefore by ar the most
acceptable one.
Further, the use of the wheel, just like other features such as the use
of horses for human purposes, are cultural features that suit the
reconstructed nomadic origins of early Indo-European cultures very
well. This, coupled with the documented spread of artwork including
wheels and wheel-like abstractions seem to bolster the Indo-European
reconstruction of this word.
Your link with Sumerian gilgul is fascinating, though, because there
may well be a link there, i.e. Sumerian taking over this word in an
early stage of contact with Indo-European nomads. I wonder if some
comments can be elicited from Sumerian and IE linguists?
Yours,
Gunthard Mueller
