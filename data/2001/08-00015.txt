I must note that this in not so wild a fantasy,   The Shang dynasty
definitely had writing in the second millenium bce and  Ho Ping-ti in
his Cradle of the East, points out that there are markers scratched
on the bases of Yang Shao pottery that easily date to mid fifth
millenium. I am certainly no expert in these fields, but it appears
that the Chinese had a notation system of some sort long before the
"seal" came into existence.  Victor Maier,  who was cited by Wilford,
certainly is however, and deserves a fair hearing.

I must also note that the cutting of the marks on the seal are so
unlike Harappan seals, that it simply cannot be of that area.
Perhaps a "blank" was traded cut with someone elses marks?

In my opinion, we shoud all wait u;ntil the corpus is a bit bigger than "one"
