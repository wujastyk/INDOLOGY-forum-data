c) From CilappatikAram:
pin2 tErk kuravaip pEy ATu paRantalai
muTit talai aTuppil piTart talait tAzi
toTit tOL tuTuppin2 tuzaIya Un2 cORu
maRap pEy vAluvan2 vayin2 aRintu UTTa - Cil. 126:241-4
Observe the word, pEy 'demon, spirit' which is worshipped by
sangam era priests, is given the strange food.
Given that A. Parpola writes that human sacrifices
were done in the IVC,

it's possible that this metaphor (?) has a hoary
memory in it.
