query: fonts
Dear Pam,
Try Itranslator98.  It's the best thing I've found for exactly these
jobs.  You input a word following the conventions we use on listservs like
Indology, (i.e., "life" is jIvana), and it turns it into both devanagari
and transliteration, in nice fonts.  As for searches, since the initial
"code" requires no special font, you can fully search documents without the
usual problems the MSWord poses with unique fonts.  The software is free--a
plus--and the designers are extraordinarily helpful and generous with there
time should you encounter any difficulties.
Here's the URL to download the software:
