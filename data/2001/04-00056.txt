Can I suggest as bedtime reading M. Sparreboom's _Chariots of the Veda_
(1985), which copiously discusses the iconographical, archaeological, and
textual evidence? Or would you agree with D. Frawley that the composers of
the Vedas (aka the Mother Culture) were a maritime people? ("That's not a
chariot, that's a ship!")
