i am a silent lurker on this list, and i too would like to thank Dominik for
his great effort, patience and labour of love on INDOLOGY. For me this list
has been a great source of information, learning and, if i may say so
without offence, amusement. If Indology does indeed close down [and i hope
it does not] it will be a cause for substantial regret.

Dominik, i sincerely hope that some of the suggestions posted by other
members will be both viable and acceptable to you. In any case, thank you
very much once again.
