 prof. Dr. Subrahmanya's statement is a surprise!

 In the modern secularizing world, Hindu priesthood, and Head seats of Mutts
 including Saiva Siddhanta Adheenams, Srivaishnava Jeeyar TirumaTams,
 Veerasaiva Mutts and even the ancient Kanchi Mutt can be made available
 to serve by qualified Indians with training in agamas, pUjA, philosophy,
 Sanskrit, the local state language ..., irrespective of caste.

 Glad to note that indeed this thinking is happening in among
 Indian elites and those with power. That will definitely be a step
 forward in the first century of the third millennium.

 Dalitas got entry permit into the temples in the last century.
 When can they become priests?

 My best,
 SM

 Often enough, your postings are bordering politics (especially the present
 day one of rewritng/revisionist Hindutva politics). I can understand and
 appreciate an occasional one; but not so regular.  I don't know what is
 your agenda.  If we start countering your points one by one, and you reply
 in continuum, then we would be discussing politics and not Indology thus
 deviating from the guidelines followed by the founder of this list. Hence I
 refrain from doing that. (After all, this is 2001 beginning. Why start a
 polemic?)

 Hope you understand. The title of this thread is Dravidian Origins.

 With regards,
