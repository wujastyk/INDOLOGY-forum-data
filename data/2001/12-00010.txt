Subject: use of historical present in Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227070006.23782.11375814269995931242.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A student here at Michigan from the Classics Dept is working on the use of
historical present in Greek dramas, and wanted to know if there was any
similar study of the use of historical present in Sanskrit.  Evidently, he
finds the use of historical present more typical in the usage of female
characters, or of those males who were looked upon as being feminine, i.e.
Persians.  Any suggestions will be appreciated.
