Plans for mass conversion of Dalits to Buddhism
According to http://www.ambedkar.org/News/milldBuddhism.htm
One million dalits will embrace Buddhism in Delhi on Nov 4
"Durban, September 02, 20:24
About one million dalits will embrace Buddhism in a mass ceremony in Delhi
on November 4, Ram Raj, leader of the All Indian Confederation of SC/ST
organisations, who is attending the World Conference against Racism here,
claimed on Sunday".
According to http://www.tribuneindia.com/20010904/haryana.htm#7
2 lakh Dalits prepare to embrace Buddhism
"Fatehabad, September 3
The All-India Confederation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
Organisations, an apex body of various Dalit  organisations in the country,
has been mobilising the Dalits to embrace Buddhism to express their
resentment against what they call "the brahmanical social order" in the
country. The confederation will organise a  ceremony at Ram Lila Ground
here on November 4 in this regard. The confederation hopes that more than
two lakh Dalits from Haryana alone would embrace Buddhism during the mass
conversion function."
I would be very grateful for any bit of additional information.
