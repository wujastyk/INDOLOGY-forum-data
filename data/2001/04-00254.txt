Thank you, Dominik, for all your troubles; time and again I was admiring your
patience.

I agree that a radical step was unavoidable.
But why not a thorough reform instead? E. g. a closed list for serious
scholars, but open for everyone to read? Please, reconsider.

The loss will be really great for those who work far away from traditional
centres of Indological learning. We will feel cut off again from the rest of
the world.

With best wishes - and if this is really the end, then good-bye, everyone

Ferenc
