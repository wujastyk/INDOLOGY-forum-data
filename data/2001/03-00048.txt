SV: Plight of Buddhist art
Isolating trouble makers and providing them with food supplies till tempers
cool may be a good idea. But this works only when UN becomes powerful enough
to talk tough and make sure its sponsors themselves dont create trouble.
Its not a good idea in general and even less so for cases like this. A
cancerous tumour needs to be isolated and drugs are designed to choke of its
blood supply by inhibiting growth of blood vessels.
If list members have any illusions about the taleban they may like to visit
the following website. It has pictures  and movies of public throat
slitting, execution, amputation, .. atrocities against women.

Also I appealing to the moderater Mr. wujastyk to check all messages with
political content. Thats not what this list is supposed to discuss as I have
been told once. For example the posts by samar abbas, rohan oberoi et al are
blatantly politically motivated. If the moderatoer cannot regulate such
emails( regardless of sender ) he stands accused of double standards.
On a personal note, I am going to unsubscribe from this list.
