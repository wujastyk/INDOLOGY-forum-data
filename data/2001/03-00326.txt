Hindu holocaust site?
It is simply disgusting how all kinds of fanatics abuse the sad historical
fact of the genocide committed by the Nazis to spread  hatred against other
religious or ethnic communities.
Presenting the own group as the  victims of the alleged horrible crimes
committed by the other group (and stating that this behaviour is an
intrinsic characterstic of the other group) is the first step to committing
genocide and other kinds of mass murder. This was the strategy (or, to a
certain degree, the paranoia) of Hitler, this is the strategy /paranoia  of
Neonazis and this is the strategy /paranoia of those groups who create
websites like those mentioned in the previous postings.
Really disgusting.
