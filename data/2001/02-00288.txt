Could as well be. The word 'meriah' is from *mer as in SBP [Sambalpuri]
'merkhamb', the central pillar on the rice paddy thrashing floor.
The DumAls/DumbAls are, however, not related to the Dombs, but instead, are related to another farming tribe by the name of 'kulutA' or 'kulitA, thought to have descended from the kulUtas of Vedic/Classical times [at least so held by a famous kulitA, Professor Prahlad Pradhan, the Pali scholar].

Best wishes,
