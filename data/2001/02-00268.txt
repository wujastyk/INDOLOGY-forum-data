Sorry
Puja and Havan are not the same. We complain so much about Weterners not
knowing enough about our culture or having misconceptions about it. I have
oftn been surprised by how little many people from the North know about the
South (of India).
***************
Every hindu knows that puja and havan are not the same. It reflects a very
insulated mind set of dravidologists when they equate havan and puja when it
comes to north indians.
