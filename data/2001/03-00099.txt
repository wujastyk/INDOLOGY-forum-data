A delightful read. I have a question concerning the following quote:

"Where Witzel and his cohorts are holding up threat to "India and objective
 scholarship" as their red flag,..."

Since Witzel is mentioned together with his "not-so-eminent sidekick Steve
Farmer" (sorry Steve!) my question is: How many cohorts are there in a
two-man team?

(Those with a penchant for military history will know that this is a
variety of the old US Marines question from the Korean war: "How many
hordes are there in a Chinese platoon?")

Regards,
