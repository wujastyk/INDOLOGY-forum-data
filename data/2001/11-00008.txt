Register of electronic texts
Dear R. Gruenendahl,
GRETIL seems to be a very useful initiative
for which all involved should be congratulated
(this is a huge effort and the result is already impressive).
As far as Classical Tamil is concerned,
you should add to your GRETIL page
the following link to "Project Madurai"
<http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/pmfinish.html>.
I suppose they will agree to have a link to their site,
as the Welcome page states that:
"The etext files distributed FREE under the auspices of Project Madurai"
  are for the personal usage of the individuals. Redistribution of these files
  in electronic or other forms to third parties and in the Web are prohibited,
  without prior permission obtained from Project Madurai authorities. "
If in doubt, you can certainly check with Dr K. Kalyanasundaram.
He can be reached at <mailto://kalyan at softhome.net>
I should add that I am aware of other digitalizing projects
but their output is not freely available for the moment.
Best wishes
