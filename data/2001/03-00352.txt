In this doha, the balance is off by one additional matra in the second
line. In the second line, the work 'ko' is correct and should not be
changed to 'kaha'.

The meaning also changes with the change and does not remain constant with
the meaning of the original, i.e.

If the great ones do little jobs, they are not praised.
Just like nobody addresses Hanuman as the 'giridhar'.

The above doha alludes to the two mythological episodes. The
first is, Lord Krishna, yet a cowhearding youth, carried
mount Gowardhan to provide shelter from torrential rains and floods for the
residents of the Braja region, got the title of 'Giridhar', i.e. the one
who carries/holds a mountain. The second story refers to the episode
when Hanuman was sent to find the 'sanjeevani buTi' he carried the entire
hill, just like Krishna had done when still a child. however, nobody calls
Hanuman the 'Giridhar'.
