is the Gita dishonest?

I agree.
And regarding consistency, Emerson once said, "A foolish consistency is
the hobgoblin of little minds."
It is interesting that even Arjuna appears to have
difficulty in following Krishna's argument and thus in the
beginning of chapters 3 and 5, for example, he asks for
clarification as to what is better, renunciation or work in
devotion.  Krishna then proceeds to clear up Arjuna's doubts.
Another point is that Krishna advises in 4.34 that one try to
understand the truth by inquiring submissively from and rendering
service to one who has seen the truth.  If this procedure is
not followed it is perhaps not surprising that the Gita will appear
paradoxical.  The 'truth' referred to there is described in the following
verse, 4.35, and is that all beings are within Krishna.
