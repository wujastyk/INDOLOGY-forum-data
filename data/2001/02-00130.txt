New interpretation of Yoga Suutra
To clarify a little further, for those who are wondering how
asata.h abhaavao na vidyate, or why asat = kaara.na - Madhva
interprets the word asat here as prak.rti, which is material
cause. And sat = brahman, which is instrumental cause. For
Madhva, unlike other vedAnta commentators, brahman is not
the material cause of the universe.
