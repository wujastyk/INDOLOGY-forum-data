>Just to correct my statement:
>There are commentaries, such as that one Madhva, which read this line as:
>naasata.h vidyate abhaava.h, naabhava.h vidyate sata.h.  Madhva says:
>asata.h kaara.nasya sato brahma.naz caabhaavo na vidyate.  (BG 2.16).

To clarify a little further, for those who are wondering how
asata.h abhaavao na vidyate, or why asat = kaara.na - Madhva
interprets the word asat here as prak.rti, which is material
cause. And sat = brahman, which is instrumental cause. For
Madhva, unlike other vedAnta commentators, brahman is not
the material cause of the universe.
