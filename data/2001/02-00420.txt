Our sympathies go out -- but this seems to be in the hands of political
actors. And here it?s better to eschew the political.
Two points:
1. BBC reports that the Taleban ?mistakenly think that Buddhists worship
the Buddha and that the statues are therefore idols.? It is the BBC who is
mistaken here.
2. Bearing in mind the legendary literature, one really does wonder what
al-Bouddah might have done had caught his devotees fashioning images of
his human form -- which he had apparently prohibited -- and worshipping
those very forbidden idols.
