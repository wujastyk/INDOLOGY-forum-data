Vyaasa's three-fold typology of historians
    S.D.Kulkarni, in his The Puraanas: The Encyclopaedia of Indian History
and Culture (vol II 1993: 47-48) argues that kings in ancient India
maintained three types of recorders: (1) the Suta narrated the exploits of
the kings of the past; (2) the Maagadha recorded prominent events in the
lives of those kings who have departed in the recent past; and (3) the
Bandin described the wars and other exploits of the ruling monarchs.
    In support Kulkarni quotes the Mahaabhaarata (Aadi parvan, part 1:
240-241). A quick check, however, could not trace this reference in the
critical edition. Does it come from another version? Has any list member
worked on this or related issue?
