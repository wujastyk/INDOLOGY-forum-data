'Aasti' ?
Thanks to Srini Pichumani and Noorjahan Begum for their input on the
meaning of 'aasti' in Tamil and Telugu. 'Property' and 'inheritance' do not
exactly match the sense in which the word appears to be used in my texts,
but at least they belong to the same sphere of meaning. (An example:
tatprabhumuulaat ayutadvaya-aastilaabhavaan 'on account of his master, he
earns twenty thousand aasti-s.')
Regards,
Martin Gansten
