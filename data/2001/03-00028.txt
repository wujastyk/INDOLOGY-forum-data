Plight of Buddhist art
If the Taliban are really destroying the statues, I owe them an apology.
They are sincere in their fanaticism, however deluded, whereas I thought
they were really asking for money or political concessions.
As for Mr. Oberoi's apology, it is accepted. But he should not feel too
contrite. I am used to the rhetorical flourishes on this list, and I would
not state my opinions on this or that if I were afraid of other people's
opinions, or for that matter of their anger. I can live with Mr. Oberoi's
views on me, just as I am sure that he can live with my views on him (they
are not quite so angry).
All the best,
Lars Martin
