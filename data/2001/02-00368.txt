Thanks for the suggestion. Perhaps. Also, we
cannot neglect nakedness altogether. Victorian value systems
are not applicable in ancient India. The devadAsis were called
sULe/cULai ('light, lustre', Cf.cULAmaNi/cUDAmaNi) and
mANikam ('ruby'). Our knowledge in this area is
little, and further explorations are possible.

As recently as 1995, the ancient practice of going
naked as offerings to Goddess Ellamma continue.
Goddess Ellamma myths make her an outcaste, and to
Her, basavi devadasis are dedicated in large numbers.
"The most ancient shrine of Ellamma is at Ugargol in
Belgaum district, Karnataka. In a village named Chandra Giri,
Karnataka, devotees proceed from home to temple in a state of nudity
to worship ReNuka-Ellamma, the ancient Earth mother. Indian Antiquary
(1882), pp. 122-3" (Pupul Jayakar, The Earth mother, p.223, Harper
& Row).

  RENUKAMBA'S REVENGE
(Reuter's report from Bangalore, March 7, 1995)

More than 1500 policemen stood guard in a southern Indian
village on Tuesday to prevent Hindu pilgrims from carrying
out a centuries-old tradition of trekking to a hill-top
temple in the nude. Police sealed entry to the village
of Chandragutti, 400 km (260 miles) northwest of Bangalore,
where a week-long festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess
Renukamba began on Tuesday, Dist. Police Chief Chandrasekhar
said. Every year for centuries, thousands of low-caste
Hindus would strip for a holy dip in the Varada river, then
climb four km (2.5 mils) with their clothes off to offer
prayers to the goddess at the hill-top temple.

But police banned the nude pilgrimage in 1987 ....
The worshippers then attacked police and paraded 10 police
officials including two women constables naked along the
banks of the river. Until 1986, more than 100,000 women
men, and children used to make the pilgrimage every yesr."

The Times of London (March 15, 1986)
"Naked Worshippers Lay Bare Dignity of Police and Press:

Each year devotees of the Hindu goddess, Renuka Devi, gather
on the banks of the Varada river in Karnataka, strip and
parade naked for two and a half miles to an ancient temple.
They have been doing it for centuries, but recently the
festival has become the centre of unenviable attention
from the media and do-gooders anxious to reform the
practice. At the weekend the festival went sour as thousands
of pilgrims turned on their tormenters from the press,
a group of social workers and the police, forcibly stripped
them and paraded them through the dusty village streets."
(W. Doniger, Splitting the Difference).

Old habits die hard.

Goddess Ellamma/Maari myths in different variants, were told
in this list. She is connected with devadasi dancers,
and is usually called "lady with 1000 yonis" in tamil poems
