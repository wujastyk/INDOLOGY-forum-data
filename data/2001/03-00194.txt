<Are you a professor of Sanskrit?>

My understanding is that this forum is for the exchange of ideas, information,
perspectives, insights among scholars, and not for asking or posting people's
CVs.
So I will have to ignore this irrelevant ad hominem query.
However, if anyone is interested in such personal matters, one is welcome to
send me an e-mail, and I will be glad to exchange such info.
Best regards,
VVRaman
