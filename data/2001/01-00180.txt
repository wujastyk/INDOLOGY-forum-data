KarnATaka/KannaDa
RZ>"karuna.tar" is a variation I have not yet seen! But the
RZ>Sanskritised "kar.naa.ta" seems to have existed already
RZ>before then,
Kamban in his RamayaNam uses the form, karunaTar:
  Eti yAtavar, Ez tiRal kogkaNar,
  cEtirAcar, telugkar, karunaTar,
                                     Kam. 1.19.1-2
DED does not list 'karu' to mean "height, raised up
platform" etc. Does Kannada has that meaning?
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
