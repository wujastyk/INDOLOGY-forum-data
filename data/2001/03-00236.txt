Serious warning about "indological@yahoogroups.com"
As you know, Aditya Mishra has set up another discussion list,
"indological at yahoogroups.com" which espouses his values more closely than
INDOLOGY.
It has been brought to my attention by a member of INDOLOGY that:
It looks as though Aditya has taken about seventy names from INDOLOGY and
subscribed them all to his indological group without permission or
consultation.  This happened on 16 March 2001.  There is even a suggestion
that when a member discovered this, and unsubscribed from indological,
Aditya resubscribed them once again, against their wishes.
Aditya has said in his list:
This is a very serious matter, and it is likely to be a breach
of Yahoo's Terms of Service.
None of this has anything to do with INDOLOGY, or me, but I feel it is
appropriate to pass on the information here, since Aditya has targetted
INDOLOGY members.
If you have a complaint you wish to make to Yahoo, the form is at
