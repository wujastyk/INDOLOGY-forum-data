Axel Michaels edited book "The Pandit"
G. Hart & H. Hock have their points.
However, the book is entitled : "The Pandit", and its deals with
traditional PANDITs in INDIA. Otherwise, A. Michaels --as a long time
resident of the Kathmandu Valley-- could easily have included, for example,
the still persisting traditional Buddhist Sanskrit scholarship. etc. etc.
I would also take a look at Aklujkar's paper first, before sounding off.
The title says it all.
