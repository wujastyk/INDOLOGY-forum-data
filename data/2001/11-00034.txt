Sanskrit news fom Delhi is back
Finally, the daily Sanskrit news from Delhi is available again, if only via
some Skt. enthusiasts:
http://sanskrit.gde.to/sanskritnews.html
The offical website of Allindia Radio, Delhi
(http://216.167.121.184/cgi-bin/air_live.cgi ) has been out of service for
many months now, and it had bad (medium wave) audio quality anyhow.
The new web site (below) is better, though not of FM quality either (higher
frequencies are missing, slight static).
Radio Nepal's Skt. program, the only other Skt. news I know of next to
Deutsche Welle, Cologne, http://www.dwelle.de/sanskrit/ , was available on
the web only via HBC   http://www.hbc.com.np/home/   this June.
(R.Nepal  normally only broadcasts the news in Nepali and English,
http://www.catmando.com/radionepal/   and via HBC also in Newari, Maithili
and Tamang).
Enjoy! MW
