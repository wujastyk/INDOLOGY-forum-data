INTENSIVE SUMMER SANSKRIT

At the request of a small community of Sanskrit students here in Madison
Wisconsin, I am planning to teach an intensive Sanskrit course this summer.
Following the Paninian grammar and tradition, I intend to teach the course
in an ancient Indian style closely imitating the Pathasala or Gurukula type
of Sanskrit schools found in India and Nepal. Thus the beginning students
will be learning not only the basic vocabulary and grammar, but also the
skills of speaking the language and chanting Sanskrit verses. Both of these
skills, I believe, are extremely valuable for learning the language.
Another important feature of my course will be a strong emphasis on writing
Sanskrit sentences. A language, either ancient or modern, cannot be
properly learnt without using it both in writing and speaking. All
students, therefore, will be required to write at least one full page a day
as a mandatory homework. Advanced students, who are interested in improving
their knowledge of Sanskrit with chanting, writing and speaking are also
encouraged to take this course.

The main purpose of this course is not only to provide students with an
alternative, but also to preserve the traditional way of learning Sanskrit.
The international scholarly community is quite aware that this ancient
Indian heritage is rapidly disappearing even in India. Therefore, I
sincerely request the members of the community for their full support.
