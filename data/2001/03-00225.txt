Interpreting the Gita
D D Kosambi, as quoted by Satya Upadhyaya, writes:
The canonical Buddhist text, the Diigha Nikaaya, in fact portrays
Ajaatasattu as being tormented by guilt for this act, and suffering
terrible consequences because of it (see e.g. the Saama??aphala Sutta).
The Ajaata'satru of the UpaniSads is probably not the same man (see
previous discussion on this list).
