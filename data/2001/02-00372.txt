Dearest all, I have found this French opera (alias melodrama):

Catel, Charles-Simon (1773-1830): Les Bayad?res (libr. E. V. de Jouy),
tragi-com?die in 3 acts; first perf. 1810.

The librettist, Jouy, sustained to have drawn his inspiration from a
"pourana" (sic) in which is told that "Schirven" (Shiva, I suppose)
descended in the world as "rajah Devendren", and, at the end, married a
"bajad?re" who is disposed to be satI for him. Before to return in the
Heaven, he consecrates and blesses forever all the devadasis. I don't know
this myth. Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance,
Daniela
