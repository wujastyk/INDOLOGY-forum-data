demons and possession in old sources

Thank you for this interesting reply. The poem is beautiful, was unknown to
me. I fail to recognize the comparison to spirit possession in it, however.
"Anthropology of Evil" is known to me, and I do have first-hand experience
of spirit possession and exorcism in Tamil Nadu (among Christians, too).
Perhaps I should state the motive for my short question: possession in
ritual, foremostly by goddesses (like those you refer to) is an important
feature of non-brahmanical religion - linked frequently to bloody sacrifice
- in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere in India. The people I was with drank the
blood of buffaloes and goats they sacrificed when the goddess was in them.
Ecstatic ritual also includes well-known practices like piercing of tongs,
walking over hot coal - you know it.
I also believe such practices can at least be traced into the Devi Mahatmya
(as analyzed by David Coburn): the frenzy of the goddess killing the
buffalo demon in myth parallels possession.
Besides, you have evil spirits possessing mostly women, which makes
exorcism necessary (like the spirits of women who died in childbirth). At
many temples, possessed women with their relatives who seek help are a
common sight (as in Sufi shrines). Note that this is not necessarily the
same as in reigious ritual. Islam or Christianity do not know possession by
god - though they do know religious ecstasy - but possession by jins is a
prominent Islamic theme.
Now, I was wondering how long back this sort of spirit possession in South
Asia can be traced.
