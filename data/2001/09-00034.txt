Parmenides and the Chandogya
Dear Friends,
I am writing an article comparing Parmenides and the sadvidyA (6th chapter,
the dialog between zvetaketu and uddAlaka AruNi) of the chAndogya upaniSad.
Has there been anything important or interesting written on this in the past
half century?
Thank you for any hint,
Ferenc
