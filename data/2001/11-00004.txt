Subject: ANN: Society for Early Modern Catholic Studies
**********************************************

Last weekend, at the Sixteenth Century Studies Conference, we made the
decision to incorporate the two-year-old Society for Early Modern
Catholic
Studies (SEMCS).

The Society is committed to furthering an understanding of Catholic
issues
in the early modern world [approximately 1450-1750] and the cities,
regions, and countries that remained predominantly Catholic or were
divided
between Catholics and Protestants or Catholics and non-Christian
peoples.
The research focus of the Society is neither limited to Europe, nor to
a
particular academic discipline.  Further, the Society itself is not
confessionally based.  The Society was created in response to a need
for
more coherence and intellectual sharing among scholars who work on
Catholic-related subjects in the early modern world.

Membership is open to scholars in all fields of early modern studies
and to
all levels of post-bachelor's degree academic standing.  Dues, in the
amount of $10.00 per year, cover an annual reception and
administrative
costs.  In addition, portions will be set aside to provide financial
aid to
graduate students who wish to attend the Sixteenth Century Conference.
In
advance of the conference, the board will announce application
procedures.

The Society has a listserv discussion list, which is generally
low-volume.
To subscribe to the list, send an email message to:
