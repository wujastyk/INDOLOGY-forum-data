Dear Bhadraiah,

It is possible to split I.3 as

   tadA   adraSTuH  svarUpe   avasthAnaM
        1         2        3   4


In this case it might be translated as

In that case  that which has no impression
            1                             2

[has]
      in its own form   standing apart
                      3               4


Or, paraphrased, as

In that case unobservable relaxes in its natural form.


It makes sense.  Thus, on subliminal level I.3 might express equivalence:

impressions stand apart from distorting influences in their natural from
<=>
unobservable relaxes in its natural form

What is that unobservable?
Overall, I tried to avoid references to such notions,
but they might be in YS anyway.

I didn't make any assumptions about YS having any metre or
possessing an ease of chanting.
Are there any reasons to make such assumptions?

>"draSTuHsvarUpe" seems to contain some apazruti, as it needs
>too much labor on a weaker ground. "adraSTuHsvarUpe" sounds perfect.

What is apazruti? What is "weaker ground"?

Thanks for the comment Bhadraiah.
Best regards,
             Dmitri.
