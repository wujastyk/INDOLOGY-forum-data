New interpretation of Yoga Suutra
Dear Bhadraiah,
It is possible to split I.3 as
   tadA   adraSTuH  svarUpe   avasthAnaM
        1         2        3   4
In this case it might be translated as
In that case  that which has no impression
            1                             2
[has]
      in its own form   standing apart
                      3               4
Or, paraphrased, as
In that case unobservable relaxes in its natural form.
It makes sense.  Thus, on subliminal level I.3 might express equivalence:
impressions stand apart from distorting influences in their natural from
<=>
unobservable relaxes in its natural form
What is that unobservable?
Overall, I tried to avoid references to such notions,
but they might be in YS anyway.
I didn't make any assumptions about YS having any metre or
possessing an ease of chanting.
Are there any reasons to make such assumptions?
What is apazruti? What is "weaker ground"?
Thanks for the comment Bhadraiah.
Best regards,
             Dmitri.
