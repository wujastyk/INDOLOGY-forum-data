We will provide transforming and lifelong educational

nationalities.  These experiences will be informed by the Treaty of
Waitangi and by the special nature of Wellington as the capital city
and cultural centre of New Zealand. Our teaching and learning will be
innovative, and invigorated by being firmly embedded in a culture of
internationally recognised research.  We will also be innovative in the
way we organise and manage ourselves and in our willingness to consider
future opportunities.
