On Unitary visions of sacred works
1. Unitary visions of sacred works rest on the conviction that the higher
truths are <revealed truths>. Any tampering with them is inappropriate.
2. In the Hindu tradition, this thesis was handled by independent thinkers in
at least two ways:
(a) The higher truths may be looked upon from different perspectives
(darshanas).
(b) This thesis is unacceptable (the heterodox schools).
3. The existence of countless <sects> in the Hindu world points to a healthy
diversity of views/philosophies/paths/ which could, by and large, co-exist.
4. However, just as it is easier for an external intruder (colonizing power) to
<divide and rule>, in the modern world, it is easier for an indigenous
government to <unite and rule>. Hence the need to encourage and establish the
thesis that there is but one origin/foundation for everything in a
culture/religion/nation.
5. Unfortunately, historical scholarship is not always cooperative in this
matter. Such scholarship is therefore looked upon with suspicion, and this
leads to conflicts.
