Khojki & Hindus/ India Gandhi's "minority demonisation"
Since Bhindranwale was a separatist, how does "propping up Bhindranwale"
(against the Akalis, to quote from one of the URLs provided by Rohan Oberoi)
constitute Mrs. "Gandhi's various campaigns to paint minority groups and
political parties as anti-national, separatist, etc. and thereby to
strengthen the Hindu majority vote behind her."
If there ever was a fascist in modern Indian history, Mrs. Gandhi was it
(suspension of civil liberties, "Indira is India", throwing opposition into
jail, erasing distinction between State and Party, etc.)  So I have no
intention of defending Mrs. G.  Just want to understand the point.
