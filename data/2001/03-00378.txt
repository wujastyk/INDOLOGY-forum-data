Mayans and Mayamuni
What is the latest scholarly position on the early 20th century theory that
the Mayan civilization of Central America derives from ancient Indian
civilization, spreading to Central America from India via South East Asia?
Does the Central American 'Maya' refer to the Mayamuni found in the Epics and
in vastusastraic texts?
