Vedic Workshop: announcement / reminder
The Third International Vedic Workshop, "The Vedas:
Texts, Language and Ritual"
will take place in Leiden from Wednesday May 29 to

organized under the joint auspices of Leiden
University's Kern Institute of Indology, the
Department of Comparative linguistics, and the

The academic program will start on Thursday May 30

main part of the workshop, Friday through Sunday, will

concerning Vedic texts, language and ritual.

Kyoto 1999; for an orientation: see the proceedings of
the first International Vedic Workshop, held at
Harvard University in June 1989, published as Inside
the Texts, Beyond the Texts: New Approaches to the
Study of the Vedas, ed. by M. Witzel, 1997).
