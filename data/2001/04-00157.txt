Q: Historical Tamil syntax
 Grammarians use another famous sentence:
 "eRumpu muTTaikoNTu tiTTai ERin2 mazai peytatu."
Here, even though "peytatu" denotes past, it actually
means the future - "it's going to rain".
It's like someone saying in March 2000, "NASDAQ/DotCom
stocks crashed" if (s)he was sure.
