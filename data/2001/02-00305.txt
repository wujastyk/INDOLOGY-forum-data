Lhasa to Nalanda - journey time by foot
Dear Mr. Stern,
These extracts from books I have might help:
1.  "The total travelling distance between Punakha (Bhutan)and Ramgamatty
[across one pass and southward down a valley] on the northern bank of the
Brahmaputra is 188 miles, which we effected in fifteen days".
2.  "The distance travelled from Dewangiri [Bhutan, on Indo/Bhutan border,
now called Samdrup Jongkhar] to Punakha [by a valley route north to
Tashigang then west across mountain passes] was rather more than 250 miles,
and the number of marches made was 26 - giving an average of about nine
miles, five furlongs each march."
