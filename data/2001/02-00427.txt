Third eye of Shiva
Prof. G. von Simson:
Thanks for the reply. I was testing to see if ever Shiva's
eye is called moon. Tamil texts also agree that
viruupaakshan's special eye is like fire (kan2al vizi
kAyvatum kAman2aiyE). The poem on Durga mentions two
crescent moons: one, an ornament on the forehead
and the other as in Shiva's head.
With respects,
V. Iyer
