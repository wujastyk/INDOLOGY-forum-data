I do not know why secular Indians should accuse Indologists
of Eurocentrism, when they lament the destructive policies
of the Afghan Taliban.

I do not know why Hindutva-vadi Indians should accuse the
same Indologists of Eurocentrism, when they reject the
out-of-India theory of Aryan origins.

I hope Indians, secular or otherwise, can see things from a
balanced perspective, instead of boiling down everything to
conspiracy theories.
