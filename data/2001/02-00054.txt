Is "minstresses" a Freudian slip? :-)
In any case, for the sake of members like Prof. Roebuck, it will be good if
Dr. Ganesan can provide translations of the texts quoted below and
demonstrate the eroticism he talks of. Of course, he can give his thesis some
logical basis, if he can show that descriptions similar to the following are
not used in case of women other than viRaliyar. And let the discussion be
confined to CT please.
