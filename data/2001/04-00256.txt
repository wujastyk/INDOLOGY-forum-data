Closing INDOLOGY
The Buddha gave the village that had given him hospitality
the blessing that they be scattered to the four winds.
So it is with Indology.
There is a vacuum regarding the past in the popular culture of
India today.  Something is going to fill that vacuum, what that is
is partly your choice.
