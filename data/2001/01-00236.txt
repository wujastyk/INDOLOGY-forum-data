Bhadraiah gAru, this tying together of relativity theory, yoga,
via negativa approach of "neti, neti", yajna, computer technology,
prANa-s, anna and attA, etc. seems like a lot of arthavAda. To
some it would surely look like anarthavAda. You keep mentioning
pictures and puzzles, and about getting various pieces from all
over the place, with the hope that one can "get" all the pieces
and "complete" it, after which one can be sure about it. Some of
us lesser mortals would like to know if you could clarify what
this "it" is, that one is supposed to get, eventually. Will we
ever get "it", or are we always condemned to only asymptotically
approaching it, whatever that "it" may be? Is it a delightfully
crazy thing like Zaphod Beeblebrox's quest?

But why on earth (or heaven) should all this be called Indology?
One Indian's unique outlook on life perhaps, but ...

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
