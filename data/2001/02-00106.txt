Just to correct my statement:
There are commentaries, such as that one Madhva, which read this line as:
naasata.h vidyate abhaava.h, naabhava.h vidyate sata.h.  Madhva says:
asata.h kaara.nasya sato brahma.naz caabhaavo na vidyate.  (BG 2.16).
Best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
