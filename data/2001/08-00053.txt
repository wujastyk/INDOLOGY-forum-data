Dear Indologists,

   For Harappa the site there's a *fantastic* site by Mark Kenoyer at:

http://www.harappa.com/har/har0.html

   The Religion Dept. at Rutgers University has a frequently updated site
called the Virtual Religion Index. The web sites listed contain brief
descriptions. The Hinduism section is at:

http://religion.rutgers.edu/vri/hindu.html

   The on-line Ramayana at Syracuse Univ. is very nice:

   One source that I briefly glanced through at a Barnes & Noble book
store a few wees ago is: The Complete Idiot's Guide to Religion Online.
Bruce Lawrence. Macmillan, 1999.

   Prof. Gene Thursby has an excellent set of resources linked to his home
page at Florida:

One link leads to the mirror site of the UK based "Shiva Shakti Mandalam"-
http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/gthursby/tantra/
