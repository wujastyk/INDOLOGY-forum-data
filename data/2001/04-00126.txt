[Query -  Kalki avatar of Vishnu & Sadhus in India]
This is a topic of great curiosity for me too. Any one knowledgeable on this
sujbect may kindly send a copy of their mail to me also.In fact, there is one
Kalki Bhagwan in Andhra Pradesh. I have heard from some people that if one
prays, the Bhagwan even the writes the exams of students who are His
devotees.

I need credible and detailed information on:
1. The Kalki avatar of Vishnu
2. Diferent sects of sadhus in India, like the nagas and the aghoris
etc.
Can you please ask the Sanskritologists/indologists you know if
there are any
interenet resources where I can get this info. Or what are the best
books on the
subject, and if they are available in India or the web.
I would be grateful for any help -- instead of cluttering up the
list,  mail could be sent off-list to me.
Thanks,
Sundeep
