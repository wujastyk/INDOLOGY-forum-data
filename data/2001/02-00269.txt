one of the few ..... ????
Some criticisms :
1. I object to the usage of Hindee / Hindoo. This is uncalled for.
2. Before anyone criticises others, please define secularism.
3. Harish Khare's Ashgar Ali Engineer's articles / comments along
with those from TheHindu are very wellknown for their anti-Hindu bias.
4. Muslims in India are notorious for their high population
growth rate. This is also a contentious issue in many nations.
Their objection to controlling population, like all their
arguments / reasoning / counter-arguments et al come from Quran,
to which they have submitted their ability to think rationally.
