Smearing the Drums
Here the reference seems to be to the pANar eating
calf meat (valci - food). Does this reference allow
the extrapolation that the calf leather was used as
membranes?
Does "vaLLuyir" refer to the drum or to the sound it
produces, although according to commentary "peritAka
olikkum taNNumai" (u ve ca pub. p.560).
The one clue, imho, this verse gives to the nature of
the taNNumai is that it was hollow ("uL yAtum illatOr
pOrvai amcol");  Although the simile is most apt,
isn't it kind of strange considering all drums are
hollow? Is this perhaps a common idiom ?
However according to the commentary that I have
"mAkkaN taNNumai" - "kariya kaNNaiyuTaiya taNNumai",
so it would seem mA is used in one of its more common
senses viz., black/dark  instead of flour. (Kazhagam
edition, p.241). Do you have any other commentary ...
u ve ca perhaps?
Thanks and Warm Regards,
LS
