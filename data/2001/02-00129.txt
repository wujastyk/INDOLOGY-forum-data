Goddess Ellammaa
goddess ellamma/mari is generally angry, euphemistically
she is called siitaladevi. In the 18/19th centuries she
was hurting/curing with smallpox, and now even her shakti
is tested to its limits. She is the AIDS-amma, and India's
prayer is she does not let the new affliction grow
to the order and magnitude that Africa faces.
