March 26, 2001 is the Hindu Luni-solar New year day called Var.sa PratipadA
or UgAdi or Gudhi PAdavA.This is first day when the Sun and the Moon are
together after the day of Vernal Equinox(March21), the natural, scientific
new year day based purely on astronomical configuration in the sky without
anthropological mumbo jumbo.However there are likes and dislikes in science
too. The scientist and inventor Edison did not like alternating current of
Tesla. Some scientists did not like Fuzzy logic of Dr. Lofti Jadeh and
Dr.Jadeh was even insulted by his former student in a conference. However
Japanese liked Fuzzy logic and they invited Dr.Jadeh to inaugurate the fast
train they designed.So some anthropologist impose their ideas of fecundity
cult, fertility goddess and harvest festival on the ancient Hindu calendar.
Let us examine the calendar briefly.
Under the sign of Aries of pioneering spirit, HanumAna first reached LankA.
His birth day comes on the full moon day of the first month Caitra.
Under the sign of Taurus, the sign of determination,Buddha determined to
find the Truth and he did. His birthady comes on the full moon day of the
second month VaishAkha.
Under the sign of Gemini(the pair), on the full moon day of Jye.stha,
SAvitrI brought back life her husband and remained eternal pair. So
SatyavAn-SAvitri Vrata ie celebrated under the Vata tree.
Under the sign of Cancer, sign of mother,VyAsa PorNimA is celebrated on the
full moon day of the fourth month Aa.sAdha.Who could be a mother greater
than VyAsa who fed us with the milk of GeetA?
Under the sign of Leo,the full moon day of the fifth month ShrAvaNa is
auspicious day to perform SatyanArAyaNa poojA.In this month Kri.sNa was
born with Leo sun sign and Taurus rising sign. The formidable combination
of lion and bull brought the utter ruin to the Kuru Empire of the arrogant
and wicked Kuru-kauravas.
Under the sign Virgo, the sign of gambling, the dice games are played on
the full moon day called KojAgiri PorNimA of the seventh month Aashvina.
On the full moon day of KArtika, the temples of Shankara are decorated with
lights. This is the TripurAri PorNimA. On this day Shankara destroyed all
three floating cities of Asuras in one stroke of his trident.
Under the sign of Sagittarius, the sign of Jupiter, the bithday of Guradeva
DattAtreya is celebrated on the full moon day of the nineth month
MArgashIr.sa.
Finally in the last month of FAlguna(Falgu means trivia), on the full moon
day HorikA (HolI) is celebrated followed by Ranga pancamI(Color festival).
In the ancient Russia this was the month of Pancakes called DhiradIs in
Maharashtra. This is the month of sport matches, fun, frolic and all trivias
in the ancient Russia and it is also the same to this day in India.This is
the month of Vasant(Basanta) festival(Welcoming Spring season) and it was
called BahAra in the ancient Iran. One reason to bring fecundity cult,
fertility goddess and harvest festival into picture to imply indirectly
that the ancient cultures like India and Iran that existed bfore Copernicus
revolution did not know astronomical calculations and their celebrations
were based on the harvests. Except Buddha's birthday all these full moon
day celebrations were in place before 550 BCE.Is it possible for Hindus to
cook these festivals within a period of 400 years from 950 BCE(Aryans still
cutting forests in the north India according to some Indologists)to 550 BCE?
Happy New Year to all.Thanks.
