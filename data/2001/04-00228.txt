I'm sorry the Indology list is closing.  I'm not sure that I want to be in
a yahoo group!

Thanks, Dominik, for all the work you've put in.

PS  I think David Salmon is quite wrong about Steve Farmer.  Steve may be
provocative, but he is never insulting, and the list has benefited greatly
from his contributions.  It's a shameful thing when people try to silence a
scholar whose views they don't like.
