MahiSAsuramardini translation
I am looking for translations of the "MahiSAsuramardini stotra" (the first
verse starts with "ayi girinandini nandita medini ..."). This is a very
popular stotra sung as part of NavarAtri worship. I am also interested in
the mythology behind this hymn. Any pointers in this regard would be most
helpful.
Thank you,
Ramesh
