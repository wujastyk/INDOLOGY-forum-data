   As shown in this list by Sanskritists and Vedicists, even
the scholars heralded by the Hindutva men do not know
Vedic. People like Elst, Frawley, ... depend on Griffith's
translation.

By forcing the Indologists not to write on the web, I feel
that their specilaized knowledge acquired by spending decades
of research and teaching will not be available for the poor
Indians. Many millions want to hear from professional Sanskritists.
They want to educate themselves about the latest research about
Aryan ingressions.

Few days ago, Suresh-ji gave a nice pointer that MIT
is planning to make all their course work on the web for FREE!
Engineers know it costs $ 30,000 in tuition alone to attend MIT
a year. How can Indians afford MIT schooling? Think of
Harvard university tuition.

Like Lars Fosse and others have opined before, the Web is
a great resource. Hope Indologists write more in English
rather than their own tongues, and make the publications which
they deem are critical breakthroughs, available on the Web.

As I said before, many millions of Indians will be thankful
for intensive Indological researches to be known. They simply
can't afford the prices of journals and books and libraries.

What I see is by stopping the discussion of Indological knowledge
forcefully by nonscholarly means, advances in Indian history to be
made by Indians in the future gets a major stumbling block.
For example, the study of High Harappan language
which the Vedicists have shown that it isn't Sanskrit, may be
aided by Indians in the future.

Sincerely,
V. Iyer

Dr. Farmer,

I believe in earlier posts you have suggested, perhaps even admitted, your
lack of proficiency in the idiom and grammar of Sanskrit (Vedic or
otherwise).

Thus, without this engendered, I fail to see how you merely can point your
finger toward some passages which you cannot read in the original language
and expect to be taken seriously.

In sum, I think that it is somewhat silly for you to get cocky and suggest
bedtime readings to anyone when in fact it is you who cannot even read at
bedtime.
