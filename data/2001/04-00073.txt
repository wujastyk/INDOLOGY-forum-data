Ivo Fiser article, Kamasutra
Indologists (and others),
   Ivo Fiser, the author of *Indian erotics of the oldest period* (Praha:
1966), contributed an article on the text history of the Kamasutra to a
European journal (WZKS) sometime between 1991-1996 if memory serves.  I'd
appreciate the full reference if anyone has it.
