A new graduate student fellowship in Indu Studies
This morning I received in the mail a flyer from the Muktabodha Indological
Research Institute in New Jersey.  It announces $10,000 per student
fellowships for graduate students undertaking their dissertation research.
One can find out more from the website of this foundation:
www.muktabodha.org, or email them at info at muktabodha.org
Please do not contact me.  I have no connection with this organization,
except receiving their mailing.  Best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
