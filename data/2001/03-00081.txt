The British Library has been busy converting its old printed catalogues of
manuscripts into machine-readeable format.  The work has been carried out
on the catalogues of western manuscripts, not the catalogues from the
Oriental and India Office Collections.  However, there are still a number
of manuscripts of indological importance listed.

For further information, go to

        http://molcat.bl.uk/msscat/

and after "entering", search the Descriptions using terms imaginatively,
such as, for example, "Sanskrit", "Sanscrit", "Hindoo" and so forth.
