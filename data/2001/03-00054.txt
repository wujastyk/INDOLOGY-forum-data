So they're excused! What will be next: bombs on the museum in New Delhi
and next Mouskwa and NewYork? The Qu'ran is just words, only human
interpretation van make a meaning. Everyone is responsable for the way
he or she reads a book. No one is excused from responsability. The
motive if the Tallies is just to prove to themselvs they've got some
power and to divert the attention from the fact that they made a mess of
Afghanistan. How can you expect that roughes who think they can solve
any problem with a gun can read and understand such a complicated book
as the Qu'ran?

Stop blaming the islam, it's people who commit these crimes!

Irrelevant! Islam preaches nothing, the words come from peoples mouths.

Just a bit of common sense might do! Visionairies scare me because they
just don't have it.
