Wanderlust of the IETribes !!
I tried reading these egroup messages, but no success.
Because there are so many egroups nowadays, it's hard to be
a member of every one of them. Would the list owner open
it up for the public? Like Indology list or
Agathiyar list discussing Tamil matters

If indictraditions and indiancivilization egroups become public,
it may attract even more populace.
