My NCERT school textbooks in India (less than three decades ago) still
had the Aryan invasion theory taught as fact.

In a talk (http://www.mnet.fr/aiindex/ch2.html) Romila Thapar claims
that she (and historians like her) have been unable to get history
textbooks updated for various reasons. Elsewhere she has agreed that
it has been known that there was no Aryan invasion for three decades
or more.

Therefore, NCERT dropping her from the textbook committee is no loss,
as she is ineffectual anyway.

Elst also makes the point that the Aryan Invasion theory has significance
for the European right-wing, as well as Dalit and Dravidian movements in
India.
