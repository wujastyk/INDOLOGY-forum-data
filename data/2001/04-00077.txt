AFTER AIT, ON TO NGT :  After first `proving' that the Aryans did not
destroy the Harappan civilization, saffron jawans went on to `prove' that
Aryans in fact were the creators of that civilization. Credit for this
goes to saffron researchers Rajaram, Jha & Oak (all Manuvadi Brahmins),
Vishal Agarwal (a Manuvadi Bania), F.Gautier & Elst (influenced by French
racist Jean-Marie Le-Pen) et al. who published numerous papers in research
journals like Organiser. Now, having `overthrown' the `AIT', Brahmin-Bania
saffronite researchers are now busy tearing down `another figment of
racist Euro-centric thinking', namely the `racist' theory that Newton
discovered gravity !, or NGT (Newton-Gravitational Theory):

  "Indian astronomers Aryabhatt and Bhaskaracharya who existed 1,000 and
  500 years before Newton, were quite familiar with the gravitational force.
  .. Similarly, before Christopher Columbus reached America, Indians had
  already landed there. The booklet specifies that the specimen of Indian
  art found in the temples of Aztecs were ample proof in this regard. "

 How did the Vedic Brahmin-Banias reach America? Perhaps using Sindhu
submarines powered by prehistoric nuclear reactors. Note that, nuclear
fusion reactors already existed in Vedic times, as proven by Pandit
P.N.Oak and the above article.

 Many other `colonialist-communistic-racist-Victorian-Nazi' conspiracies
have been exposed by brave saffron soldiers. For more laughs about
saffronite `research' `exposing' the NGT :
