question of what the "original" language was.  From a Christian point of
view, this is a completely irrelevant question, theologically speaking.

Re: American universities and American Christian churches:  No close
connection at all.  If anything, we have too much "separation of church and
state" in our educational system.

In my entire life (I am 52), I have not heard more than ten mentions of
Gandhi during Christian church services, and they have all been very
respectful (if anything, utterly uncritical).

What nonsense comes up on this "scholarly" list all too regularly!

Maybe this sort of thing should be shipped out to "Yahooooo!"
