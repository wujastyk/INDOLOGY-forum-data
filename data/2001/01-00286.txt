This is most likely a post-CT poem. What is being offered to the

live calf.  [...]
  The commentary on this poem talks of an actual cow with a calf.
  While being gifted to the brahmins, the cow's horns and the hoofs
  are covered with gold ornaments.
  In a puRam poem, the memorial stone erecting ceremony
  of a Chieftain is described. In this, the chief's
  ability of taking calves and their feeding
  cows ( *kan2RoTu kaRavai*) from his enemies is particularly
  praised, and the poet asks "will the bards' groups come
  today without knowing the sad news that the chief has died?".
  Is it possible that bards visited routinely chiefs
  after their winning of cows and calves?
