Lhasa to Nalanda - journey time by foot
I'm hoping that somebody on the list can answer this question. About how
long would it take to walk from Lhasa or its environs to Nalanda in Bihar?
References to 20th century journeys by foot in either direction between some
specified location in India to or from the Lhasa area would help , such as
books about Tibetan refugees' experiences.
The aim is to form an idea of how long it might have taken the Buddhist monk
zaantarakSita to travel to Tibet, and return in the 7th century.
