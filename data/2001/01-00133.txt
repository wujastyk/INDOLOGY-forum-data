At least in Tamil, it is very important.
-run- where n is dental  assimilates to
-n2n2- where n2 is alveolar. Eg., karunATu > kan2n2ATu
if we apply Tamil sandhi.
But there are no examples for -amn- becoming -ann- as far I know in
Tamil. Probably none exist in Kannada as well (but I'd like
to be shown an example of -amn- > -amm-. (I can understand .n
"softening" to m, but the reverse is not possible in tamil,
ie., m > _n or .n does not happen.)
Until another example with an -amn > -ann exists, kannADu from
kammitu- 'fragrance' remains doubtful (at least to me).
Cf. Even though Tamil poets sang for millennia that
tamil = 'sweetness', nobody accepts that's the origin of
the name of the said language.
