looking for e-texts on Vedaanta
Dear colleagues,
I am preparing a critical edition of Vaacaspatimi?sra?s Tattvasamik.saa
based on a single Nepalese Palm-leaf manuscript. I am looking for e-texts
and translations of Vaacaspati?s texts.
I would also be glad to come in touch of scholars working on Vedaanta
specially on Vaacaspati.
Thanks in advance,
