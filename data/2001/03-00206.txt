Reference-Wendy on Geeta. What is the difference between An American
University and an American Christian Church? Churches routinely teach that
Hebroo was the mankind's first and original language and address Mahatma
Gandhi in their sermons as Hindu Gandhi.In future, I expect more attacks on
Mahabharata and ShriKrishna. They are paid to do that.More than 20 million
dollars are spent (conservative estimate) by the western world to study the
ancient pagan, heathen, Hindu India. Why? Thanks.
