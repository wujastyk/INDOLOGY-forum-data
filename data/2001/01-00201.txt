Books for self-instruction in Classical Literary Tamil
Dear List:
Does anyone know of any books that are designed or could be used for
self-instruction in Classical Literary Tamil or the classical literary
forms of other Dravidian languages, and that could be used by someone who
knows Sanskrit but no Dravidian?
