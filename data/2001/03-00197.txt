----------------------


For those who may wish to refer to Pressfield's <italic>The

Legend of Bagger Vance</italic> in courses on the Gita or on

religion and culture:<italic>

</italic>

The following precursor from 1972, in which a Scots-

man named Shivas Irons (partly a pun on "Chivas" Regal

Scotch Whisky) is the mystical protagonist, may also be

of interest.


Murphy, Michael. <italic>Golf in the Kingdom</italic>.  1972; rpt. New

        York: Penguin USA, 1997.


That work was followed post-<italic>Bagger</italic> by:


Murphy, Michael.  <italic>The Kingdom of Shiva's Irons.  </italic>1st
ed.

        New York: Broadway Books, 1997.


Also possibly relevant (in the light of sports as action):


Murphy, Michael and Rhea A. White.  <italic>In the zone: Tran-

        scendent experience in sports.  </italic>New York: Penguin/

        Arkana, 1995.


A thematic comparison of all three with respect to the

actual principles of the Gita itself might make a good term

paper for an able student.
