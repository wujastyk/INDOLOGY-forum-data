Book about 'Bagger Vance'
For those who may wish to refer to Pressfield's <italic>The
Legend of Bagger Vance</italic> in courses on the Gita or on
religion and culture:<italic>
</italic>
The following precursor from 1972, in which a Scots-
man named Shivas Irons (partly a pun on "Chivas" Regal
Scotch Whisky) is the mystical protagonist, may also be
of interest.
Murphy, Michael. <italic>Golf in the Kingdom</italic>.  1972; rpt. New
        York: Penguin USA, 1997.
That work was followed post-<italic>Bagger</italic> by:
Murphy, Michael.  <italic>The Kingdom of Shiva's Irons.  </italic>1st
ed.
        New York: Broadway Books, 1997.
Also possibly relevant (in the light of sports as action):
Murphy, Michael and Rhea A. White.  <italic>In the zone: Tran-
        scendent experience in sports.  </italic>New York: Penguin/
        Arkana, 1995.
A thematic comparison of all three with respect to the
actual principles of the Gita itself might make a good term
paper for an able student.
