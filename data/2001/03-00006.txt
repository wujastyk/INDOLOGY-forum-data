Mr. Oberoi?s comments are, at the least,  uncalled for, inappropriate, and
unhelpful.

I empathize and share the pain Dr Fosse must have felt on reading Mr.
Oberoi?s comments.

Art and the appreciation for art, transcends all cultures, is universal.
The art in danger, is art that belongs to all of us, a legacy left to
mankind by the unknown great artists who created these wonderful sculptures
over two thousand years ago.

The question to be addressed is what can be done if anything?


For starters perhaps ...a communication attempt by members of this list to
the leaders of countries who could influence these  - would be destroyers
of art.
