See Vaiyapuri Pillai's dating of TolkAppiyam
which is substantially later than Sangam poetry:

Prof. Jean-Luc Chevillard quoted G. Hart regarding the problems
of dating different TolkAppiyam grammars:
" I will today
 quote prof. George L. Hart III's viewpoint,
 as it appears on page 10 in his 1975 book (PAT):
 "The poems of Ancient Tamil, their milieu
  and their Sanskrit counterpart"
  University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-02672-1

 "The _Tolkaappiyam_, a treatise on grammar and poetic convention,
  is generally said to have been written even before the anthologies.
  This claim, if true, would make that work of great importance
  in this investigation. However, Mahadevan has shown
  that the writing system described by the _Tolkaappiyam_,
  and specifically the part that calls for putting a dot (_puLLi_)
  over a letter to indicate that it is not followed by the vowel _a_
  (as a _virAma_ in Sanskrit), was not used until several centuries
  after the period of the anthologies. In other words, parts
  of the _Tolkaappiyam_ are quite late, though some parts
  may be as early as has been generally claimed. Unfortunately,
  since it is quite impossible to separate the early parts
  of the _Tolkaappiyam_ from the later parts, that work
  cannot be relied upon for historical data on the period
  of the anthologies" (PAT, p.10)" - JLC on 16 Jul 98
