NDFL; was "Central Asian Linguists Wanted"
NDFL was not "allowed to lapse."  It merely had its name changed to
FLAS (Foreign Language and Area Studies), so as to camouflage its
Cold War/Sputnik roots.
Even as we speak, students continue to be funded by this program. .
.and who knows?  Some of them may even be able to get jobs now!
