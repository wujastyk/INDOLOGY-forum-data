tracing a quotation!
Madhav,
Is the compound agnirivaraajah definitely a literal quotation?  I ask
because it could be seen as  paraphrasing or otherwise referring to MBh
12.68.41ff., which reads, in part [regarding the king]:
kurute paNca rUpANi kAlayuktAni yaH sadA /
bhavaty agnis tathAdityo mRtyur vaiZravaNo yamaH // 41//
yadA hy AsId ataH pApAn dahaty ugreNa tejasA /
mithyopacarito rAjA tadA bhavati pAvakaH //42//
yadA paZyati cAreNa sarvabhUtAni bhUmipaH /
kSemaM ca kRtvA vrajati tadA bhavati bhAskaraH //43// etc
