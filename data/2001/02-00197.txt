Consider the Online Tamil Lexicon entries:

   cAlin2i 01 1. woman employed in pronouncing oracles under
   the influence of a spirit; 2. wife of VasiSTha

   cAlin2i 03 woman who deals in toddy

   aruntati * 1. name of the wife of vasis2t2ha, considered
   a paragon of chastity; 2. the scarcely visible star alcor
   of the great bear, supposed to be arundhati transformed

   aruntatIyar cobblers (TLS)

The caste of Cakkiliyars calling themselves as aruntatiyar
is probably related with their function as drummers and
shamans in festivals of ancient Andhra Pradesh. The buffalo
sacrifice to goddesses (like Durga) are conducted by their members.

Shaman priestesses in Classical Tamil sangam literature are called
cAlin2i(=arundhati).
