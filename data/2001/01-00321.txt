Arun Gupta <suvidya at OPTONLINE.NET> has written as follows:

>I'm also told that the Bhagavad Gita is extremely popular at one of the
>Indian Institutes of Management.
You are confused about the issue.
Gita is a religious text regardless of which language it is written and has
no place in secular studies any where.

>Horror of horrors !  How can this be permitted ? The Gita isn't used at

>out that IIM using the Gita is antiquated, irrelevant, anti-secular, anti-
>Muslim, Hindu revivalist, caste-ist, fascist.
You are unwittingly  right so far but no more in the next sentence.

Have a peaceful and joyous day.
