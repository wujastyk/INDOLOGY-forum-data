Subject: Vimalakirti update and clarification
Message-ID: <161227070091.23782.15842902852050052205.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,

Some clarifications and updates on the Vimalakirti materials:

All of these are courtesy of Matsuda Kazunobu.

1.  there is no question that the ms in question is on palm leaf.

2.  the first person to suggest the 11-12th c. date for the ms was
not Lore Sander but Matsuda himself. Also, the colophon was quoted by
Matsuda from a news report; he did not see and read it himself.

3. Taisho University has loaded the press release documents and snapshots
on their home page.

Snapshots:

Title and transliteration of Vimalakirti's colophon:
http://www.tais.ac.jp/project/shiryo6.html

Title and transliteration of Jnana-aloka-alamkara's:
http://www.tais.ac.jp/project/shiryo8.html

These are Japanese pages, but it may be possible to view the relevant
portion (I--Silk--do not know because my browser automatically reads
the Japanese). The Jnana-aaloka
-alamkaara isTibetan tr is Peking ed., No. 768, Chinese trs are
Taisho, Nos. 357, 358
and 359 in the vol.12.

4. Oskar v Hinuber wrote the following to Matsuda:

I apologize for any possible confusion by my earlier emails.
