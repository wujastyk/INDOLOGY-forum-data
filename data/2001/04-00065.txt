Chariots and Ships
Subramanyah S quotes :
"The intimate linkage between Proto-Indo-European and the
 horse and the chariot is a myth". pg 51 - Wagon, Chariot and Carriage -
 Symbol and status in the history of transport - Stuart Piggott
and wrote that the Indo-European war chariot is a figment of the imagination.
Steven Farmer seems to be saying that the war chariot apparently
appears first in RV VI, which, according to him and accepted theory,
is a late Mandala.
So, Farmer and Subramanyah appear to be in agreement.
That is, if "the Indo-European war chariot" means that chariots were
part of the PIE culture.
Are chariots a late acquisition of the Indo-Aryans ?
