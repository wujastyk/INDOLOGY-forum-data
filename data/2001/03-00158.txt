I thought the mathematicians on the list would jump on this.  The question
of how long is a river is not that simple a question.  Because the shape of
a river is whats known as a "fractal" the length of the river depends on the
scale at which the measurement is taken (in a much more fundamental way than
just the accuracy of the measuring device).  I.e. a river curves back and
forth and as you go to finer and finer scales it still curves back and forth
so the length keeps increasing.

(For "How long is the coast of Britain?" substitute "How long is the Indus
river?".)
Or better yet see "The Fractal Geometry of Nature" by Mandelbrot .
