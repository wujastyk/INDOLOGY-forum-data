Please check this..

Hopefully it is accurate, and shows how Newton had to fight it out at
political level for several decades to get his theories accepted by
scientists of his time, never mind the fact he made a few mistakes. His
opponents also did not necessarily have any better ideas like relativity,
but it took decades for a scientific idea to get accepted. About that
article on science in India?
We are in for the long haul :-)
Best,
Bhadraiah
