>Do you know an example?

In Tamil, I do not know of (C)am + n- becoming (C)amm-.
I believe if kam- 'fragrant' + nADu ---> kannaDa is
the *ONLY* example, kannaDa formed out of 'fragrant land'
may need a review.

>(The Kannada adjective hiriya is the cognate of Tamil periya; hiridu
>< OKa piridu 'what is large / old / great / senior'.) The r is obviously
>lexically important, as we can see in older literature:
>per-maram 'large tree', but later it becomes hem-mara; cf. also heb-bera.lu
>'large finger = thumb', hed-daari 'big road = highway', hej-jiga.ne 'large
>leech'.

For OKa. per-maram > pemmara(hemmaara), see parallel consonant
assimilation in Tamil:

This again is an example with (C)e- and not with (C)a-.
>Not many, but they exist: e.g., words in which the first element is
>'kem-' ("red"), such as ken-niiru "red water, blood", ken-nettar
>"red blood", ken-naalige "red tongue".

There are many examples in Tamil: cem + nIr = cennIr 'blood, red water'.

>If the tapped r in the above examples can be assimilated to the

Yes, both in Tamil and Kannada assimilation of m > n is to be
expected. But it is conditional. Ie., m > n happens ONLY if
the vowel preceding m is e or i. See below.

>Cf. also hindu 'what is behind' (OKa pindu, cognate of
>Tamil pin2), which produces compounds like him-me.t.tu- 'to turn
>back, retreat', him-ma.di 'heel' etc. Here we see that an originally
>alveolar and a labial nasal can be assimilated;

Again, these examples are  related to what you gave before with
-(C)em. Now, what is given is examples with -(C)im > -(C)in, and
closely related with -(C)em > -(C)en. These assimilations are routine
in Tamil as well, pin2 + tu = pintu (Cognate with Ka. pindu/hindu).

Parallel Tamil examples:
tEn2 'honey' + mozi = tEmmozi, tEmozi; tIm ('sweet') + mozi = tImmozi,
