Karnataka/KannaDa (was: Karave caste and Kurus)
In Tamil, I do not know of (C)am + n- becoming (C)amm-.
I believe if kam- 'fragrant' + nADu ---> kannaDa is
the *ONLY* example, kannaDa formed out of 'fragrant land'
may need a review.
For OKa. per-maram > pemmara(hemmaara), see parallel consonant
assimilation in Tamil:

This again is an example with (C)e- and not with (C)a-.
There are many examples in Tamil: cem + nIr = cennIr 'blood, red water'.
Yes, both in Tamil and Kannada assimilation of m > n is to be
expected. But it is conditional. Ie., m > n happens ONLY if
the vowel preceding m is e or i. See below.
Again, these examples are  related to what you gave before with
-(C)em. Now, what is given is examples with -(C)im > -(C)in, and
closely related with -(C)em > -(C)en. These assimilations are routine
in Tamil as well, pin2 + tu = pintu (Cognate with Ka. pindu/hindu).
Parallel Tamil examples:
tEn2 'honey' + mozi = tEmmozi, tEmozi; tIm ('sweet') + mozi = tImmozi,
