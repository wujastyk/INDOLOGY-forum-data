Varanasi might be a useful clue: I would check Vallabh sources if Sridhara
and the Gaudiya and sources you mention have proved fruitless.  They are a
Vaishnava community that have maintained a distinct presence in Varanasi
(unlike the Gaudiyas) and dominate a surprisingly large area of the city
around the thriving Gopalji Mandir in the heart of the city (containing the
Vallabhi's 2nd or maybe 3rd most important deity).
