Examples of pre-GaGgeza discussions of pakSatA presented in a formal-ontological scheme are Udayana's KusumAJjalI [third stavaka]and MaNikaNTha's nyAyaratna.
Depending on the emphasis of your enquiry, pakSatA in its latent form can be traced to the works of Jayanta BhaTTa [nyAyamaJjarI, anumAna section]JJAnazrImitra, RantakIrti, RatnAkarazAnti and others.
In later navyanyAya, pakSatA has been discussed and commented upon by RaghunAtha, JagadIza and GadAdhara. The commenterial tradition continues to kAlizaGkara siddhAntavAgIza [kroDapatrasamgraha] and beyond.
The point of your interest in pakSatA  and the example you quote from Mohanty [as discussed in siddhAntamuktAvalI] seem to me to be different from the Navya variety of pakSatA. This concept or notion of pakSatA is an approximation of the old nyAya category of sAmAnyatodRSTa anumAna. I do not have the Mohanty book with me, so cannot comment further on this point. Prof. Mohanty is knowledgeable, so I need to know the context in which he uses the siddhAntamuktAvalI to be able to talk about it. But I would like to offer a general caution regarding siddhAntamuktAvalI used as an example of NavyanyAya. This work is a revisionist approach to the Navya variety of nyAya [claasical nyAya updated with navya terminologies,and navyanyAya understood according to the concepts of classical nyAya].
