Bhaagavata-puraa.na commentary MS
In looking at the very interesting J. Brockington's A Descriptive Catalogue
of the Sanskrit and other Indian Manuscripts of the Chandra Shum Shere
Collection in the Bodleian Library, vol. 2: Epics and PurANas, Oxford,
1999, p. 147-9 (n? 370-81), a rich collection which is representative of
the content of a single library from a pandit in Benares at thye beginning
of the 20th century, it appears that there were there several manuscripts
with the BhAgavata-Pa?cAdhyAyI as an autonomous piece, with or without
commentaries. Among the commentaries, KAzInAtha's ToSaNIsArasaMgraha and
DhanapatisUri's GUDhArthadIpikA appear several times. The catalogues of
SSUL and Benares Hindu University should be also checked.
