The obstreperous Islamist hate monger Samar Abbas  has struck again as
follows:

>   "A Taleban spokesman in the United States, Sayed
>    Rahmatullah Hashmi, told the BBC the statues were being
>    destroyed to retaliate for the 1992 demolition of the ancient
>    mosque at Ayodhya in India by Hindu activists."

Why it took them 9 years to retaliate for an alleged act done in a far off
land by people of different faith?
