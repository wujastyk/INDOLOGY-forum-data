2 points to note.

1. American Universities and Churches are quite distinct.

2. The popular European attraction is the Indo-German/European, Aryan
connection with Sanskrit. See, the books by Leon Poliakov,
The Aryan myth, M. Olender, The language of the Paradise.
There was competion between Hebrew and Sanskrit once
William Jones clinched the Sanskrit connexion. Politicians
used Sanskrit for different goals.
