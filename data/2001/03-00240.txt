I presume that when it says "this is the language which God spoke, it
means that this is the language in which he inspired the Hebrew Bible"
and in which when he talked with the Patriarchs and Prophets, he
addressed them.

Not quite the same view but similar are quoted with approval in the
introduction to the 1955 ed of Biblical Hebrew in the once
prestigious
Teach Yourself series (R.K. Harrison):  "[Hebrew] is the eternal

God spoke".  One assumes that his motives are to encourage the study
of Hebrew among Christians as he deplores the lack of interst among
theology students.
