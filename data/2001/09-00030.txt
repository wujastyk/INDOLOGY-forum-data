Kavya in South India
Dear Professor Hart,
Having read your response to the publication of my book Kavya in South
India, I decided to write to you to let you know that I would be interested
in exchanging opinions with you on Old Tamil Cankam literature, perhaps in
the form of a guest lecture at Berkeley.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
