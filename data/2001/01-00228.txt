Books for self-instruction in Classical Literary Tamil
Thank you for your advice; I'll check these out.
It's true that Toronto has a huge South Asian population-- the largest, I
think, of any city outside of the Subcontinent.  And yet no Dravidian
language is taught at the University of Toronto, and our once-great
Sanskrit department is now embodied in a single professor.  I shall have
to teach myself Tamil from books, or try to overcome my social ineptitude
and look about for living instructors.
