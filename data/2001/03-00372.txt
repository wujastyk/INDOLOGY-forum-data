Text layers in the Gita
It is a pity that Martin Gansten took decision to refrain from further
posting on the subject. Otherwise I would ask him how it is possible that
a supposedly unitary text - the GItA - just after its culmination point,
i.e. after the inspired theistic hymn and the magnificent poetic vision of
VizvarUpa in Chapter 12, suddenly turns to rather dull JnAna-oriented, SAMkyaic
speculations and classifications, and further on, up to the end of the poem in
Chapter 18, with an exception of some small "synthetic" interpolations, in letter
and in spirit contradicts the GItA's basic ideas (of karma-yoga and theism/bhakti),
but resembles rather the SAMkhyaic AnugItA - a text written at least 6 centuries
later than the GItA's "core".
        And, after all, many Ancient Indian texts grew as a result of
adding subsequent "interpolation layers" in the end; as, e.g., the first
that comes to mind now -
Milindapanha, whose first chapters were supposedly written in NW
India in the very beginning of 1st century AD, while its last part -
in Shri Lanka at least 5 or 4 centuries later.
