dev- / Devil
"Devil" is not related to dev-. Devil is ultimately a derivative of Ancient Greek di?bolos,
an agent noun of diab?llein (different ablaut) "to throw around, mislead, confuse".
The original meaning is the "misleader, confuser". (di? "through/around", b?llein "to
throw", related to English/German ball/Ball).
Di?bolos is used as a synonym of Satan in the Greek Christian tradition, from where
it reached Latin (as diabolus), with the same meaning. Legalese and proverbial advocatus
diaboli "devil's advocate". The Latin form -- and concept... -- entered most European
languages, e.g. Ital. diabolo, Engl. devil, German Teufel, etc.
