It may well be that there are no other examples, and that this does
not matter either, for: how many monosyllabic lexemes that
become the first element in compounds are there? hiC- ('C' here
stands for 'consonant'), muC-, keC-, kaC- and a few numerals, and
I think this is all. They are about as rare as Dravidian adjectives
are; and with such few instances, it seems difficult to draw
statistically binding conclusions.

</color>I had a look at it, but it seems to concern Prakrit, and not Sanskrit,
:-) and the combination r+n gives .n.n (cerebral). Anyhow, the Tamil
example does look good and confirms that the old suggestion karu-
naa.du is a serious possibility - even if it is Tamil and not Kannada.
But I am still not entirely convinced that kam-naa.du is impossible,
or that the parallel examples with kem- are not relevant.
The question would of course be solved if we find an old inscription
that explicitly tells us the etymology - but I don't think that we
should hold our breath waiting for that, and for the time being we
should perhaps keep the question open.
