Orissa
Arlo, many thanks for the copy of Kashikar's paper: not a very successful
visit it seems:
"he was out of town"....
I will write on the villages today, I guess: Finished an urgent paper
yesterday.
(also thought a bit about my Leiden lecture. Looks interesting & NEW now...
You know: exiting, innovative, thought provoking...)
