Vedic roots of Tamil culture
Ref.:
http://www.voi.org/michel_danino/tamil_cult01.html
Is Michel Danino an expert on Tamil literature? Does he even
know to read old or modern Tamil?
While reductionism to derive Tamil culture fron Aryan Vedic texts is apparent,
the recent studies pointing out the uniqueness of the sangam literature,
Dravidian substratum element in Indian history, the arrival of
Aryans outlined in I. Mahadevan, A. Parpola, G. Hart, K. Zvelebil, M. Witzel,
... are missing! Reliance is made on outdated materials
like KAN Sastri (see criticism by Hart), and scholars who do not
read (old) Tamil literature, K. V. Sharma and M. G. S. Narayanan
are from Kerala.
Danino's attempt won't stand the Indologists' scrutiny.
