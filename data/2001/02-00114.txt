The Sanskrit indeclinable s'am (used as both an adverb and a noun) denotes
auspiciousness, health and well-being, and is particularly associated with
the God S'iva, giving him his titles S'ankara ("well-making") and S'ambhu
("well-being").  The great philosopher was called after the God.

Viveka means "discrimination", "discernment", from vi-vic-, to winnow
(grain), to discriminate, to discern.
