I understand that Devanagari script was not created as
a response to Urdu script, and it evolved from Ashokan Brahmi script.
The question is whether the Moghul rulers used Urdu or
Devanagari script in their administration.

Pardon my ignorance. If devanagari was widely used say in 1600, 1700,
1800 & 1900 AD, why then was a big political movement to enforce
Devanagari? Under the nominal headship of Kashi Maharaj, the
Devanagari Pracharini Sabha in 19th century and its lobbying efforts
and British support? Also then, why scholars refer to as "one language,
 two scripts"? The two scripts represent more of religious affliations than
anything else.
