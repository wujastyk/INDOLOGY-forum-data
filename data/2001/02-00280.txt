Hindi as a farce

This is the accepted immediate source/sense of "urdu" but in Mongolian
"ordu" also means 'the residence of the ruler' and 'palace'.  It is
also the source of the English word "horde" -- one of the few
Mongolian words adopted in English -- as in the famed Golden Horde
(altan ordu).
