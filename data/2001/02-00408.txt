Vedic tone notation, how ancient?
Could anyone tell me how old the use of various forms of notation to
indicate the tones in Vedic chanting is, and what the evidence for
this is?  I need it for possible inclusion in an exhibit as an example
of the beginnings of writing and musical notation.
Thanks,
Allen
