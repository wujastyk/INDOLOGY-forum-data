Just one?
I am sure that there are several more.
It is true with any language. There are so many words that some one uses in
English that I do not know and have to consult a dictionary to understand
the true intent of the writer or speaker.
You have started a sentence with "if" and without waiting for the answer
went ahead with another question based on your assumed answer.
Have you heard the meaning of "assume = ASS U ME"? It is making an ass of
you and me.
Your second question has no significance unless your assumption is correct.
Whom do you call Turkish kings?
Babar, Humayn,  Akbar and all their dynasty was raised in India and were no
more foreigner than Sonia Gandhi and her children. Just because a person is
born in a certain country is no reason to assume that he./she cannot adopt
another country. I myself was born in India but am now a naturalized US
citizen and have no less loyal to US than any one born here.
 Muslim Arabs introduced Arabic script
Your assumption is again incorrect. Afghanistan is not birth place of Urdu.
Persian and Arabic are two completely different languages and speaker of one
does not necessarily know the other language even slightly. As a matter of
fact Iranians are Shias and Afghanis are Sunnis and very bitter enemies of
each other.
Your are so off the mark that I do not what to say about your imagination
and wishes.
Have a peaceful and joyous day.

Random thought of the day:
        President Reagan noted that there are too many economic pundits and forecasters and decided on an excess prophets tax.
