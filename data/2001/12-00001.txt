Bhaagavata-puraa.na commentary MS
The Vallabha sampradaya has a major presence around the Gopal Mandir in
Varanasi, as Edwin points out. The way you can tell if it's Vallabha's
Subodhinii (or a subcommentary on that) is by the chapter numbering.
Vallabha does not regard as authoritative three of the early chapters of
the BhP. So, if the text is Vallabha's rasapancadhyayi section, the
chapters will begin their numbering with 10.26 rather than 10.29.
