Are we are saying that Asoka, the biggest cheese of
his day, ordered it be published that he had visited
sites associated with a legendary figure of uncertain
name?

<<So for me the kind of passages we get in e.g. some
of the Majjhimanikaaya discourses presenting those
teachings show every sign of being the product of a
single originating mind.>>

Perhaps the mind of the author of those discourses?
