the life-history of Bha_rata's (India's) ancient civilization dated to
ca. 5500 Before Present (BP). The volume details the exciting
discoveries related to the ancient courses of the river using
satellite images and evidence provided by archaeology, epigraphic
inscriptions contained on weapons, bangles, seals and tablets, ancient
texts and the tradition of many parts of Bha_rata, that is India. The
sections of the volume include: River Sarasvati: discovry and revival;
ground-truth; culture, arts and crafts; gold, silver-smith; bronze-age
Bha_rata; archaeology, language, writing system; Goddess Sarasvati;
Concept of Cyclical Time; Rigveda and Linguistic Area; Bha_ratam
Janam. The next four volumes will relate to: script, language,
technology (including archaeo-metallurgy, Soma) and the continuing
tradition of Sarasvati Civilization in Bha_rata and many other parts
of the world.

Review Excerpts: A paradigm shift in studies related to Ancient India.
The book establishes the indigenous evolution of culture in Bha_rat,
from the Vedic times and is thoroughly documented with an index and
bibliography. A possible break-through in methodology to decipher the
script is also indicated; the inscriptions may be lists of weapons of
the bronze-age in its evolutionary stages.
