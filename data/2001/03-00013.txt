This discussion is now futile since the statue has just been destroyed.

Lars Martin Fosse <lmfosse at ONLINE.NO> has written as follows:

It is irrelevant whether they are inimical to US or not.
Once in a while you get some leaders who claim to be more sincere in their
faith than others.
We have seen it happen in China during cultural revolution and in Combodia
during its own cultural revolution and unless it is checked, is going to
happen in India if VHP and RSS get into an absolute majority.
US  itself if going through a   minor cultural revolution with the election
of Bush with help of right wing Christians and equally conservative majority
in the Supreme Court.. His initiatives already announced foretell of more to
come that will tear down the separation of church and state regardless of
what he publicly says.
