Devanagari (Re: SV: Workshop on Islamicate Culture)
I am sorry, the title of Philip McEldowney's thesis should
have been
"Colonial Administration and Social Developments in
Middle India: The Central Provinces, 1886-1921"
I had the period as 1986-1921.
Also I should mention that Central Provinces has a southern
section (Nagpur region) where Marathi was common. It is now
part of Maharashtra. I assume that in the quote "northern province"
refers to northern part of "Central Provinces", now part of
MP/Chhatisgarh states.
