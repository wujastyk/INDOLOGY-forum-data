Vaikhanasa Aagamas
According to the New Catalogus Catalogorum you can find mss. of the 
Anandasamhita 
1)  in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras:
    Descriptive catalogue,, no. 14758 (20 cantos); Triennial 
    catalogue, 3477 (b), 3825
2)  in the Punjab University Library, Lahore:
    Catalogue, vol. 2 App., p. 54 (by Marici)
It may also help to enquire at the New Catalogus Catalogorum office, 
Madras University (next door to the Government Oriental Mss. Lib.) 
whether they have collected additional entries in the meantime.
(I don't have their exact address with me, but I'm sure you can find 
that out.)
