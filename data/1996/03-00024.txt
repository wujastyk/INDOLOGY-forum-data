Mr. Peter Gaeffke wrote on the stipulations of the Boden Chair:
I for one do not draw any solace, nor do I think that the whole west is
horrible. I only feel sorry and hurt that wrong ideas about Hinduism have been
propagated because of ignorance or prejudice of one kind or another. I try in
my own inadequate way to point out them.
He further writes:
Certainly, we have to thank those pioneers for raising the flag of intellectual
freedom.
But, when he writes
I must again quote, this time Max Mueller himself:
" Large number of Vedic hymns are childish in the extreme;tedious, low
commonplace"  in "chips from a german workshop", p 27 (1866)
" nay, they contain, by the side of simple, natural, childish thoughts, many
ideas which to us sound modern, or secondary and tertiary" in "India, what it
can teach us" p 118, (1882)
" This edition of mine and the translation of the Veda will hereafter tell to a
great extent on the fate of India....It is the root of their religion and to
show them what the root is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that
has sprung from it during the last three thousand years." in a letter to his
wife written in 1866; Life and letters of Max Mueller vol I, ch XV, p 346.
"The ancient religion of India is doomed and if Christianity does not step in,
whose fault will it be?" in a letter to Duke of Argyl, 16 Dec. 1868.
He arbitrarily fixed the date of the Vedas much against the objections of
Wilson.
Monier-Williams declared "Brahmanism, therefore, must die out.  In point of
fact,false ideas on the most ordinary scientific subjects are so mixed up with
its doctrines..". in "Modern India and the Indians" 1879, p 261
But, it was then. According to Mr. Gaeffke:
With the intellectual freedom they enjoy, it is up to the unbiased scholars to
reexamine many wrong statements which have been made against Hinduism.
