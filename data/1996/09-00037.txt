Gorakhanaatha is part of a tantric/alchemical milieu in which

example was of the "ra" in Ramayana, which is a different genre entirely. 
You have to use interpretative techniques which are appropriate to the
subject matter under discussion.
Oooohhh no it doesn't.  I wondered whether you would fall for this line
when I wrote what I wrote: you have missed my point about the difference
between technology and science.  The theoretical physics of quantum
electron behaviour has nothing to do with the technical and engineering
developments which have made email a practical reality.  The history of
20th cent. science shows the distinction between scientific and
technological development clearly in many fields. The computer networks
and so on have been developed using transistor technology, certainly, but
they *assume* the solution of necessary theoretical problems, and do not
re-solve them as part of technological implementation. 
This is getting too bizarre.
I'm signing off on this topic now.
