At a conference I met a Shakespearean scholar from Nottingham University 
(named Pete; I could probably track him down, Harold, if you're really 
interested) who is writing a book on "Scatological Language" (not a 
linguistic study, a Culture Studies approach).  We talked about Lee 
Siegel's work.  Anyway, some people take the subject seriously as 
monograph material (to be published no doubt by Verso or Routledge).  Of 
course we know that Culture Studies people "just want to have fun".
