Velthuis's Devanagari and hyphenation
I used Velthuis's Devanagari script to typeset a book, and Dominik 
Wujastyk helped me immensely. I, too, complained then about no 
hyphenation, so 
he, maybe with the help of others, developed a dev2e package that would 
allow for hyphenation. It worked just fine. The book was published by 
Harrassowitz, complete with hyphenation where needed. If you look at 
Dominik's site on the web or at his ftp site, or at CTAN, I think you will 
find dev2e.sty, and then you should be all right. One little problem I 
had was that at first the hyphenation would work fine in the body of the 
text but not in footnotes. To solve that problem I had to use fnfix.sty. 
Dominik may be able to help more. 
To use dev2e.sty, however, you will have to use LaTeX2e.
Best,
