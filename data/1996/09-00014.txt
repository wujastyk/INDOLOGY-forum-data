	Bard College is conducting a search for a tenure-track position in 
Hinduism, beginning August 1997. The position requires a strong 
commitment to teaching, scholarship, and the support of students' 
research. Candidates should have completed or nearly completed the Ph.D.,
and possess an excellent teaching record; publications should demonstrate 
scholarly engagement in their chosen field. Fluency in the relevant 
languages of specialization is assumed. Teaching responsibilities will 
include the study of Hinduism from the post-classical to the modern 
periods, complementing current offerings in the history of Buddhist 
thought and practice. The successful candidate will be able to interact 
easily with colleagues who work in different methodologies and cultural 
traditions.
	Bard College is a highly selective liberal arts college located in 
the Hudson Valley, ninety miles north of New York City. Bard is a member
