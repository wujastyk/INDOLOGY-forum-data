Temples and shoes
Ashok and others,
For some reason I haven't been able to locate this inscription in my 
nocturnal wanderings through Epigraphia Indica.  What a pity that we 
cannot identify the ancient kavi who composed this little gem!  I'm sure 
that only he himself could do it justice in translation, so I 
must decline.
