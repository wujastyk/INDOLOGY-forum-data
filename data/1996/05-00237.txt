With many others, I am sure, I have several times heard the tale that the
German acquisition of the vedas (or veda manuscripts) from India was the
reason for the German "economic miracle".

I have generally supposed that this story is based on the fact that Max
Muller -- often perceived as a German -- was the first editor of the RV.
