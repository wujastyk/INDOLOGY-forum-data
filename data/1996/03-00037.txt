unedited texts meriting attention?
Indology being a relatively small field that covers a lot of ground, one 
hears of texts that have received scanty attention (or none at all), but 
which might be valuable and interesting to the scholarly community were 
they to be examined in detail.
I suspect that younger scholars in particular--though not exclusively 
they--would be interested to hear from more experienced
researchers suggestions of Sanskrit or other Indian texts in need of editing 
and/or translation and analysis, so that more effort could be directed to 
untilled ground.  Ideally, a suggestion would also note the potential 
value of the text, or the problem on which it could throw light.
If nothing else, the airing of such suggestions would help to indentify 
areas of Indian cultural history that remain in shadow, and to indicate 
gaps in collective knowledge.  It also seems to me that this would be an 
excellent use of the electronic medium's potential for fostering 
collegiality and coordinated effort in the international academy.
