Temples and shoes
	And while I was despondent about finding the apropriate authority 
for walking away with someone else's shoes from a temple, I "saw" the 
following verse which is missing from all standard versions of Manu's Laws:
	sarvathaa nuutana.m vastu nirmaatu.m ne.svaro' py alam |
	ekasyopaanahau tasmaad anyasmai pradadaaty asau ||
	Now no one needs to feel guilty.
