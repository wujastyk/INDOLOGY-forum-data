Dear dan white,
It is not insult anybody. But since you want to know about holy academically
it can be simply asked ' can we learn about holi '.
there is no need to attach the damaging word ' chaos 'in the
description.
Holy is not anything to do with varna or caste. Many die- hard missionaries have
tried to misrepresent and wound the the feelings of many many good hindus.
as you have said you have met (andwill meet) many good hindus . the hindus
will help you learn about holi . the only request i have to make is not to be derogatory
in the description of hinduism though it has been wrongly practised for masny
many years .Let us try to appreciate each other,not try to find out ways
to put down each other , let us study together and learn to use respectable words to
describe each other in culture person and in every way . That way friendship will
grow. 
        i am lookiing for the growth i the correct understanding among indologists
about hinduisms and hence i think it is neccessary to use the correct words in the 
description for otherwise the very purpose of being scientific is defeated . m.rajagopalan
