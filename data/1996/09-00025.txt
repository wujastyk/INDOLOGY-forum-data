Hi,
The interesting bit is, of course, the lack of proper treatment of the sounds
themselves, and the various symbolisms associated with them, in Western 
universities. While I don't know why this is the case, the result is that 
people, educated in the west, tend to think of Sanskrit/Vedic as just another 
language. 
For instance, if one knows/assumes/believes that, say, the sound 'ra' is the 
biija mantra for the  agni tatva, AND one can pronounce its properly, one would
probably see the raamaayaNa in a different perspective. 
As a physicist, I am a bit influenced by the primary importance of experiments;
however, the establishment in Indology would perhaps think that one should stay
'aloof' from the language in order to study it 'properly'. I believe some 
famous Dutch Indologist said something about students, showing too much 
interest in what they were studying, being 'lost to scholarship'... 
I am sure the paNDita-s have many things to say on this issue.
Bye,
