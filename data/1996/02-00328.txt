Dear Narahari Achar,

I'm afraid that your lack of professional involvement in
university-level indological studies means that you are unaware of the
history of Sanskrit studies in Britain.  The above quotations from
Williams and Wilson do not reflect either their own wider views and
concerns, nor are such views in any way a tradition, let alone one that
"goes on".

For an excellent account of the debate surrounding the founding of the
Boden chair at Oxford, see the inaugural lecture by Prof. Richard
Gombrich, published by OUP in the 1980s some time.  It may be available
at your local indology department library.
