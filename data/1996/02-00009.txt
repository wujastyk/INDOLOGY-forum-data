         Summer Sanskrit Query

Can anyone tell me where I might be able to place students in a summer
intensive Sanskrit program?  I have three definites, possibly five, who are
desperate for Sanskrit.
-------------------------------------------------------

Well, I had been planning to post the following. Here it goes:



Subject: Summer Sanskrit at Harvard 


Like last year, I got several inquiries regarding our offering of Introductory 
Sanskrit this summer, -- taught here since 1988.  I repeat the most 
important items for those interested to join us. Last summer's course (10 
"takers" from the mid-west to the south-east) was very enjoyable, indeed the 
best I have had  here. Actually, we -- some of the Summer 95 class--  are 
thinking to have a 2nd year level course added this year -- Interested 
persons please contact me! 


  SANS S-101 Elementary Sanskrit 
  (8 units)  Monday-Thursday 3:30 - 6 p.m.
  (approx. dates: June 23 - August 10;  exam period Aug. 12-16)   
  Instructor: Michael Witzel 
   
  This course, equivalent to two semesters of course work, will 
  enable students to acquire the basic reading skills in Sanskrit. Stress
  will be placed on learning the Devanagari script, basic grammar and 
  essential vocabulary. Emphasis will also be given to correct 
  translation of passages from simple narrative literature to the epics.
  
Fees: Application feee (nonrefundable $35)      
Tuition (credit or non-credit): 8 unit course: $ 2,650 (approx.)
      Health insurance  $95 (required if not covered by an American 
             carrier) 
      On-campus housing (if desired):  room and board, eight week session:
             $ 2,175    
             (Housing deposit $460)
