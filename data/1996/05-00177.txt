Re: Transmigration in the RV
How have traditional pundits (i.e., excluding reformers
such as Dayananda Sarasvati and members of other modern
movements) explained the apparent absence of karma and 
transmigration in the RV? It would be interesting to see 
how traditional scholars, who generally see a common trend 
of thought from the RV to the Gita, read these theories
into the Vedic samhitas.  Are their interpretations, if any,
entirely too far fetched?
