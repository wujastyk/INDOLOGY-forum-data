I'm just curious, considering the RV padapaatha is, in effect, a 
"commentary"--is this what the rendering of texts should be?  Or whould 
the analyzing per akSara not be left to the citation of specific passages 
in analytical studies.

Viz. e-texts, preparing them is mammoth enough considering limitations, 
still, of non-roman-script computing.  OCR work would still require 
line-by-line analysis and search engines now--for a careful scholar--can 
pick out units of words sought without akSara analysis.
