land as female?

This very description seems to me as evidence of how and why land is 
identified as/with females.  True, it may not be the femaleness that is 
foremost, rather the relation of the land to men.  Yet is that not what 
is also foremost in the consideration (defination even?) of a female (her 
relationship to men, be it husband, father, brother)?
