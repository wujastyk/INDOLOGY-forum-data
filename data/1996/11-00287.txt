public works in Ramayana
very well and I thank you about.
I've just a little problem more.
My university is very young and his library very poor. The sanskrit shelter
is one meter long (including Boeckling-Roth).
Do you know a good bookshop specialized in sanskrit, preferably in Europa
and with e-mail or http facilities, where to order books, specially this
exciting edition of the Ramayana.
namaste,
