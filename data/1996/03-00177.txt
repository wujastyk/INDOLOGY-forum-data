          Tamil Manuscripts stored in Tibet??!
         -------------------------------------


Zvelebil quotes this: "Fortunately photostat copies of Tamil
works on cadjan leaves of the 12th century was made; The manuscripts
were preserved in the much more favaorable climate of Tibet. But, so far, 
they do not seem to be available for study" (T. P. Meenakshisundarm,
A history of Tamil literature, page 5, 1965)

Does anyone know where the Tamil manuscripts from Tibet or the
copies of them are stored? This seems to be very interesting
material for study. Do they contain Buddhist texts??

Thanks for any pointers,
