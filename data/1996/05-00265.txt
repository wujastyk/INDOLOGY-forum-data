Hinduism and Human Rights
Browsing the web yesterday for another purpose, I found a page for the 
"Hindu Studies Review."  The inaugural issue (Dec. 95) of this electronic 
journal contains, in English and Sanskrit, a "Hindu Declaration of 
Universal Human Rights."  The journal is housed in the home page of the 
California State University, Chico, Religious Studies Department.  The 
URL is:
