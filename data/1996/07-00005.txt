I should perhaps add some more information on the TZ transliteration
scheme. Punctuation marks are repesented by double marks. E.g: a/svas
t.r.nam atti..
= The horse eats grass. In a similar manner, - used for other reasons than
transliteration is represented by --. Thus punctuation marks that could be
construed as parts of characters are written in such a way that the risk of
confusion is reduced. But of course: You have to transliterate correctly,
otherwise you get garbled results. That is true of *any* transliteration
scheme.
