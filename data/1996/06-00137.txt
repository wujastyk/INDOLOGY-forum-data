An introductory course to the Sanskrit language is now available
by anonymous ftp from ftp.nac.ac.za/wikner/

It is a 155 page 600-dpi Postscript file suitable for double-sided
printing on a4 or letter size paper.

   ( The a4paper version prints happily on an HPLJ4+ with duplex 
     option; the adjusted margins for the letter paper version are 
     estimates only -- perhaps someone will inform me of errors?  )

To give an idea of what is covered in this course, an ASCII 
version of the Preface and Contents pages are appended below.

BEWARE: there is a very thin piece of wire to South Africa, 
        and it is stretched rather taut, so the best time to
        ftp would be Sunday morning local time (GMT+2:00).

The files are:

sktintro.ps600-a4paper-june96         (9206k)
sktintro.ps600-a4paper-june96-zip      (980k) - remember to set TYPE to BINARY

PREFACE

This course of fifteen lessons is intended to lift the 
English-speaking student who knows nothing of Sanskrit, 
to the level where he can intelligently apply 
Monier-Williams' dictionary(1) and the Dhaatu-Paa.tha(2) 
to the study of the scriptures.

The first five lessons cover the pronunciation of the basic
Sanskrit alphabet, together with its written form in both
Devanaagarii and transliterated Roman: flash cards are 
included as an aid. The notes on pronunciation are largely
descriptive, based on mouth position and effort, with similar
English (Received Pronunciation) sounds offered where possible.
The next four lessons describe vowel embellishments to the
consonants, the principles of conjunct consonants, and additions
to and variations in the Devanaagarii alphabet.
Lessons ten and eleven present sandhi in grid form and
explain their principles in sound. The next three lessons 
penetrate Monier-Williams' dictionary through its four levels
of alphabetical order, and suggest strategies for finding
difficult words. The last lesson shows the extraction of the
artha from the Dhaatu-Paa.tha, and the application
of this and the dictionary to the study of the scriptures.

In addition to the primary course, the first eleven lessons 
include a `B' section which introduces the student to the 
principles of sentence structure in this fully inflected language. 
Six declension paradigms and class-1 conjugation in the present 
tense are used with a minimal vocabulary of nineteen words. 
In the `B' part of lessons ten and eleven the principles of
compound words are introduced.

The course aims at a practical _understanding_ of the basic
principles, at getting a `feel' for the language, and not a 
learning of rules by rote. To this end, each lesson concludes with
exercises for the student to put that understanding into practice:
answers to the exercises are presented in an appendix.

        . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .


The pronunciation offered in these lessons is optimised for the 
English-speaking student to _understand_ the underlying 
principles of sandhi (sound changes). 

There are several variations in the pronunciation of some of the
Sanskrit sounds, that have been handed down over generations.
None of these traditions are wrong, although this may confuse the
mind trained to think in terms of opposites, of right and wrong.
Consider the English spoken in Britain and America for example:
they are certainly different, but neither is wrong.

Where there is a variation in the form of a character these lessons 
standardize on the form that is most commonly used in currently 
available printed editions of the Bhagavad Giitaa and Upani.sads.
The common variations are illustrated in the ninth lesson.

        . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .


In the English-speaking world there is currently little appreciation 
of the value of studying formal grammar: as a result it has become 
unpopular, and many schools have ceased to teach it. In view of this 
situation, an appendix of basic English grammatical terms is included.

        . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .


(1) Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary is currently published 
    by Motilal Banarsidass in India and Oxford University Press in 
    England: although the two are printed from the same plates, the 
    latter is far superior in the quality of printing, paper, and 
    binding -- and this is reflected in its higher price.

(2) The edition of the Dhaatu-Paa.tha referred to in these 
    notes is that edited by J.L.Shastri and published by Motilal 
    Banarsidass: it is a small book and quite inexpensive.
