Dear Dr. Zeller and Others who might be interested:

After sending out several e-mail inquiries, I still don't know
if the handbook is available for others and I still don't have
an address of a place where you might purchase the dictionary.
If you'll send me your e-mail number directly to
kms5f at virginia.edu, I'll contact you directly when I know more.
