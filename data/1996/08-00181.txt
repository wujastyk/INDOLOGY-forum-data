Hmm.  Perhaps irrelevant, but in Maltese (Semitic arabic-like language
written in Roman script) the letter "x" is pronounced "sh" as in English
"sheep".  Thus, the town Xemxija is pronounced "Shemshiiya".  I go to
Malta a lot, and am thoroughly accustomed to this value for the letter. 
Would it do for us?

Best wishes,
Dominik
