The Bhagavad Gita in Arabic
Some of you may be interested to learn that my late father Dr. Makhan Lal 
Roy Choudhury, Professor of Islamic History and Culture in Calcutta 
University, translated the Gita into Arabic, with a critical introduction 
and notes in 1951. The title of the translation is AL-KITA.  It was 
published in Calcutta by Mssrs. Thacker Spink & Co.
