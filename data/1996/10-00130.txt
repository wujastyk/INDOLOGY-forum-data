Re John Smith's Mahaabhaarata
Well done Joel. Your sentiments match mine entirely. However, I'm a 
little puzzled by your reference to the Mac. I downloaded the original 
files to my Mac at home here, and after doing a bit of "search and 
replace" I converted the files into my preferred font. You may contact me 
by E-mail if you need any further info on this, or - since you are in 
Toronto, you can contact me here in Montreal phone (514) 844-6267. 
Cheers
Julian Woods
