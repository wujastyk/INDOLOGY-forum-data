Folk Tale Query
You may be right that the point here is rather that the victim should be
physically perfect. I was thinking of kings rather than sacrificial victims
as such, but of course the fact that the victim is a king may be irrelevant. 
The point I wanted to make was, however, that we have evidence from ancient
Europe that kings were supposed to be physically perfect. According to an
Irish source, king Congal the One-eyed, who had been blinded by bees, was
put from his kingship. The source says that it was tabu that there should be
a king with a blemish in Tara. There are also examples of this attitude from
Sassanian Persia. Since kings are potential sacrificial victims in several
cultures, there may be a connection between the idea that sacrificial
victims shall be without blemish and the idea that the king should be
without blemish. But the king was also regarded as an idealized man, and it
is this idea that seems to have a reflex in the ideas that ordinary
Americans have about the physical appearance of their president, which I
quoted in my email.
Sorry about the confusion.
Best regards,
