siva vinadhara
For starters you might try: Hawley, John Stratton, "The Boston Vinadhara
Siva," Journal of the Oriental Institute [Baroda] 33:1-2 (1983): 141-46 [I
don't recall how far back his own discussion traces the form;
There are a few agamic sources cited in Gopinatha Rao, T. A.. Elements of
Hindu Iconography. 2 vols. 1914. reprint ed. Varanasi: Indological Book
House, 1971, vol. II.2, pp. 289-292.
I appreciate hearing back if you find still better sources.
