Music: form, tambura -Reply
I would also recommend _Sonic Theology_ by Guy Beck, which deals
with musicology as well as the concept of naada-brahman (which as the
title suggests is the theme of the book).  Unfortunately I don't have a
copy handy and don't recall the publisher.  It came out very recently
(within the last 8 months or so, I believe).

	I would like to add another book by B. Chaitanya Deva : 
Psychoacoustics of music and speech, The Music Academy, Madras,
1967.  It  contains some of the same material as referred to by Srini, but
has some  more chapters dealing with "the psychology of the drone in
melodic music".
