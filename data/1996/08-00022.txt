Dear Dr. Resnick,

the following articles might be of interest to you:

Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita." Journal of the American Oriental Society,
42: 1ff.

Cultural History. Sanskrit and World Culture. Berlin, 628-638.

Sternbach Felicitation Volume. Lucknow, Akhila Bharatiya Sanskrit Parishad.

Bhishmaparvan des Mahabharata." Wiener Zeitschrift fur die Kunde Sudasiens,
Wien,  : 159-174.

Since I have been working with chronological problems myself, let me point
out a few difficulties: Before you try to define the relative or absolute
chronology of a given piece of writing, you must feel fairly certain that
this piece of writing is homogeneous and not a composite work. The BG is a
composite work.

Furthermore, and generally speaking, you cannot use information deriving
from one or two verses as a means of defining the chronology. Any single
verse can, in principle, have been added at a later date. Only features
that prevail in various parts of a work, with a reasonably even spread, can
be used for dating purposes. You should also remember that Sanskrit works
were sometimes rewritten to fit new purposes. Thus, a text may rest on an
older, and somewhat different text, with a different ideological slant.
This makes dating in many cases a very uncertain game. If you use
linguistic criteria, it may seem older than it is in its present shape.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
