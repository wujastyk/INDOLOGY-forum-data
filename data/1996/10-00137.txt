Copyright
Although I have no specialized knowledge about this, I think Ken is wrong
about US copyrights.  Any work, as I understand it, whether registered or
not, is *automatically* copyrighted, unless this right is explicitly waived. 
Registration is more or less merely a way of formalizing the process which
takes place automatically.
