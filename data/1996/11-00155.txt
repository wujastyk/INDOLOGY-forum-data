   Q: Proto-Siva
   **************

I read in many books on Hinduism that Siva is a late-comer to the
Hindu Pantheon. Initially, he was not invited for Yagnas, or
given sacrificial offerings. The Daksha myth alludes to that.
Any references on Siva, his origins as a non-vedic deity
and eventual absorption into Hinduism. A. Hiltebeitel
wrote a paper on Indus seal, I think.
