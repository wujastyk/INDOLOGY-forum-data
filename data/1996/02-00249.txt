Sprenger Collection
Dear Colleagues,
Does anyone know where the Sprenger collection of Indian mss. is currently
housed, and if it has been catalogued and the catalogue published? How can
one obtain a microfilm of a manuscript from this collection?  My impression
was that it was in the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek in Berlin, but I would
appreciate more concrete information.
Thanks,
