JBE Editorial Positions
As the Journal of Buddhist Ethics begins the publication of Volume
3 (1996), the editors are pleased to report that the journal now
has around 725 subscribers in 37 countries. Many many more
individuals, who are not subscribers, regularly read the journal.
We are now receiving more than 25,000 visits to our World Wide Web
sites each year.
The journal expanded greatly in 1995, publishing 11 articles
spanning more than 200 pages of text, as well as a liberal
sprinkling of book reviews and informative bulletins. The staff of
the journal now includes four editors and eighteen editorial board
members. Additionally, the journal became one of the first Internet
resources to publish documents in Adobe Acrobat format, making it
possible for subscribers to read the document exactly as it was
prepared by the author. The journal also hosted its first online
conference in 1995, a highly successful venture focusing on
Buddhism and Human Rights that received more than 400 reader
comments during the two week duration of the conference.
Because of the gratifying response of our subscribers, the
overwhelming attention of scholars in the discipline of Buddhist
Studies, and the strong support of other individuals keenly
interested in Buddhist ethics, the editors are eagerly anticipating
expanding the journal much more aggressively in 1996.
The most immediate change is that the journal will include an
exciting and completely up to date series of book reviews covering
the whole discipline of Buddhist Studies. Precisely because our
electronic format allows us to reduce the time-lag between book
publication and book review, we are hoping to offer our readers the
most timely resource for book reviews ever presented in Buddhist
Studies.
Additionally, we have adopted a policy of sponsoring one online
conference per year. The topic for 1996 will be "Ethics in Western
Buddhism." By mid-year, we will be issuing a "Call for Papers" for
this event. We will continue utilizing the remarkable formatting
capabilities of Adobe Acrobat in publishing journal pages that
duplicate the appearance of hard-copy journals. And we expect to
provide an offprint service to our readers at extremely low cost.
In order to continue the operation of the journal at its high
standard of excellence, and to effect the changes described above,
the journal is hoping to expand its staff. As such, we are
announcing the job vacancies listed below. All editorial positions
on the Journal of Buddhist Ethics are unsalaried, providing an
appropriate credit citation on one's vitae and the immense
satisfaction of having served the profession in selfless but
meaningful fashion.
