What was applied to the face may have differed from place to place.  In 
Maharashtra, I have seen application of some sort of a ball made out of 
flour.  An allusion to this practice is found in the oft-quoted Sanskrit 
verse:
	ko na yaati va"sam loke mukhe pi.n.dena puurita.h
	m.rdango mukhalepena karoti madhuradhvanim

Here, the reference to the pi.n.da in the mouth alludes to food/flour.
	Probably, the M.rdanga having a clay body may have been the 
earlier practice that earned its name.  Later, PERHAPS, the name stuck 
even after M.rdangas were made out of wood.
