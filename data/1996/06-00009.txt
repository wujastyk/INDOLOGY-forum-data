Chair in Tamil Studies, UC, Berkeley
Dear Ganesan,
I am shocked to note at what happened to the endowment Chair of Tamil in
Berkely Campus. Are the fund raisers satisfied to give an additional title
to a full Professor in the same campus? I cannot figure out what was going
on behind the Chancellor\s invitation. What does this appointment imply?
Does this mean that Hart will get additional money? Was this endowment
intended to boost his pay?
It was Hart who wrote to me an encouraging letter and who suggested that
there could be  a possiblity of a chance for me after this year. He told me
that he and myself should keep in touch, to make use of a possible future
opportunity.
I think that you can understand my disappointment as I seem to back at
square number one from where I started, regarding suitable academic
employment.
I remember that you tried to do good for me, even without myself requesting
anything. It appears that I have no chance of making to the U.S. Anyway,
thank you very much for what you have done.
with regards,
