Folk Tale Query
There is a very similar story I was told as a child (we are Tamils): A
king cut himself and his chief minister applauded at the good news---the
minister was of course immediately jailed...  Later on, while traveling,
the king was caught by a tribe of cannibals who were looking for a
physically perfect king for their purposes. To their dismay, the king had
this small wound...and they had to release him. Is there proof that the
above is of foreign origin? 
I hope this helps.
I haven't checked any of the standard sources (Panchatantra,
Tenali Raman, etc).
