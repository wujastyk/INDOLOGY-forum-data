Holi Discussion Appreciation

   I agree with him entirely on this.  I would also add that theoretical models
appropriate in one context, say the European, may not be appropriate in the
Indian context.  Indiscriminate use of such models would only lead to
confusion.  It is obvious that the Indian Society is much more complex compared
to the relative homogeneity of the European.
I recall an earlier heated discussion on another festival, DEEPAVALI.
   The suggestion by Narahari Rao to do a study of Indology itself is worth
following.  May be a discussion of the history of Indology, its beginning,
development and evolution may bring out clearly some of the prejudices of
colonial times and whether they still persist.
