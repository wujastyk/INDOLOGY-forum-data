Hello out there,
I am reading letters from 19th century Indologists about book and mss 
purchases etc. in India.
Does anyone know a) how much a Pound was to the Rupie in 1880? 
And b) the Pound to the Mark (Kaiserreich)?
I have one letter mentioning an exchange: "...I got 176 Rs for the 300 
Mark you sent me..." but then he continues to mention prices in 
pounds as well...
Thanks for any comment!
Gabriele
