The Campus
~~~~~~~~~~
Enter AKSHARAM, and you will be pleasantly surprised to hear everyone
in the campus speaking Sanskrit. Office transaction takes place in Sanskrit.
It is a delightful sight to watch the kids engaged in verbal duel in
Sanskrit, while playing. Entire atmosphere breathes Sanskrit.

Following are some of the facilities at Campus --

   - A well-equipped library containing more than thousand Sanskrit
     reference books, including palmleaf volumes
   - Computers with Sanskrit DTP capability and E-mail access
   - Separate dormatories for male and female volunteers
   - Residential quarters for Sanskrit families (everyone in the
     family is serving for Sanskrit cause)
   - In-house kitchen and dining hall
   - Guest rooms

Since the campus is run by donations and service is the main goal,
only basic facilities are provided for the inmates. The volunteers
working here do not receive any salary, except for a meager amount
to manage the basic needs.

The volunteers take part in different projects at Aksharam. Apart from these,
they will be touring various parts of the country to propagate Sanskrit.

At any time, there will be around 15 female volunteers and 15 male volunteers
along with three Sanskrit families. The total number will be more than 75
during training camps.

Early morning prayers, common meals, sharing campus maintenance work,
complete dedication in the work assigned, continuous guidence and
counselling by elders -- the life of a volunteer is highly disciplined.
