The South Asia Gopher contains a subsection known as ILM: Inventory of
Language Materials, which in turn contains a listing of all the known
language-study programs for South Asian languages. I reproduce below
the specific entry for the BULPIP program, which is located in Lahore.
The ILM listings can be accessed directly at the following URL:

 Teaching/ILM
Let me know if you need more information about The South Asia Gopher
itself.

The chance to live with a family in Lahore while studying is an
especially valuable part of the experience.  Field research by
participants is not permitted.
       "Plan A:  Before beginning the program, applicants must
have completed at least two years of Urdu and/or Hindi, or the
equivalent, and should have a good knowledge of the Urdu script.
Students having completed one year of Urdu and/or Hindi by June
1996 are eligible to apply if they intend to take an intensive
second-year summer Urdu/Hindi course at the University of
Washington, Seattle, or at the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
during the summer of 1996.
       Plan B:  Urdu language instruction will be offered to a
limited number of U.S. scholars conducting research in Pakistan.
We can accommodate all levels of ability; private tuition may be
secured on a contingency basis."
