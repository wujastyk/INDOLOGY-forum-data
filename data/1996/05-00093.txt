I'm afraid you are mistaken.  There is no evidence whatsoever to show that
the Greeks had ever heard of Panini or his school, or any Indian
grammatical school, let alone been influenced by them.  Greek grammar as
such started with Dionysius Thrax, and was developed more as a system of
language learning (paradigms) and literary appreciation than linguistics
proper.
