	A brief comment on the post on digital microfilming via camcorder
and Snappy.  Whether using this method or any other requiring a reliable
power source, be sure to carry a sufficient supply of batteries and take
precautions when drawing from local electrical power sources.  Simple
power converters (basic voltage converters, transformers) are insufficient
to protect electronic equipment from damage if there are wide fluctuations
in the power delivery system.  A rule of thumb is the more power required,
the more weight to be carried. Gene Thursby <gthursby at religion.ufl.edu>
