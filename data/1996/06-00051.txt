Deshpande's article "Changing conceptions of the Veda: From Speechacts to 
Magical sounds" (ALB 54, 1990:1-41). Keywords in Deshpande's argument: 
reification of speechacts; deification of speech; Vedas impersonalized and 
decontextualized; "differences of authorship are gradually replaced by a more 
theological conception of a single authorless Veda"; "reinterpreting the Vedas 
to fit changed circumstances". Deshpande's own note of caution that his 
argument "does not give us chronological history" is important, because his 
earliest stages, from "living speech-acts" to "personification and deification 
of speech", seem to have been overlapping for a considerable time. They are all 
amply reflected in our earliest available source, the Rgveda.
