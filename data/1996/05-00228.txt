PTS style Tipitaka CD-ROM ...$150
Since people are mentioning this, let us not forget:
There is a FREE version of all canonical Pali texts, with a few
extra-canonical things too, posted on several different webs -- perhaps most
conveniently, to note here, on Indology's.  
Is there some reason we should be considering spending alot of money for
materials we already have?  (I have not used the data extensively yet, but I
have not noticed any problems, save the sometimes unweildy file size).
