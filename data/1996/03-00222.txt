Dear Members of the list:

There was an annnoucement a few weeks ago that Adobe, Apple (and 
Netscape?) are developing a technology that enables users to transfer 
documents that include font information and fonts themselves (as current 
pdf) over Internet.  Although this technology is primarily meant to be 
used by web publishers, it seems poosible to attach such documents to an 
e-mail and read them using future version of Netscape Navigator or any 
other MIME compliant e-mailer.  I think vast majority of users are now 
using Netscape Navigator especially those who are at educational 
institutes since it is free to them. 

Even now, if one is not afraid of sending huge size of e-mail, 
PostScript file that include font can be sent and viewed/printed on most 
of platforms.  I believe the above mentioned new technology is an 
extension of this technology.

So, I think the future is rather bright.

By the way, Apple is reportedly planning to release Indian Language Kit 
(at last).

It seems that software developers are not as stupid as to neglect nearly 
billion population.
