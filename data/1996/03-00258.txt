A Fatal Bus Accident near Taj Mahal involving "American Professor"
I heard on the news this morning that a fatal bus accident occurred in the
vicinity of Agra and that four American students and an American University
Professor from the University of Pittsburgh were killed. Does anyone know who
this professor was?
