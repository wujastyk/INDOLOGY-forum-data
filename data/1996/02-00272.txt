To be found in Mahabhashya on P. 1.1.45. BTW there are various occurrences  
of "zaaTii" or "zaaTaka" in Patanjali's work. The passage you are alluding  
to makes it clear that "zaaTaka" (masculine here) used to denote a  
manufactured piece of cloth and not raw material. Patanjali quotes in his  
remark to Varttika 16 on "zivasuutra" 1 an example where "zaaTaka" is  
connected with Mathura: "teneva zaaTakaan aacchaadayamaano ye  
mathuraayaam" (ed. Kielhorn/Abhyankar, Vol. 1, p. 19). More references in  
Pathak/Chitrao: _Word-index to Patanjali's Vyakarana-Mahabhasya_, p. 1020,  
sub vocibus. Compare also Albrecht Weber, in: _Indische Studien_, Vol. 13,  
1873, p. 467.

The Dhammapada knows brahmanical ascetics who wear "ajinasaaTii"  
(Dhammapada v. 394) made from the leather of a deer (?). Other derivatives  
like "saaTa", "saaTikaa" or "saaTiya" are noted elsewhere in the Pali  
canon (source PED). A short peep into the _PaaiasaddamahaNNavo_ indicates
that the Jaina canon yields references for "saaDa" and "saaDiaa", too.

It seems that this sort of cloth (supposing "zaaTii", "zaaTaka" etc.  
denote the same) became popular in "early" postvedic times (the  
_Vaidikapadaanukramakoza_ quotes only two references in "late" UpaniSads  
as, e.g., SaMnyaasa-UpaniSad).
