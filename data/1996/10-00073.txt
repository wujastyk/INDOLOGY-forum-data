Q: Neelakanta Bhaashyam
        Q: Neelakanta Bhaashyam
       *************************
I want to know of any Western language articles/books on
Neelakantha Sivacharyar's bhaashyam on brahmasutram.
This is a Saiva Siddhanta work. May be the references will 
deal with the differences when compared to Sankara's advaita philosophy.
Has the French institute of indology, Pondichery brought out
any books?
Kasivasi Senthinathaiyar in 1907 published a tamil translation
for Neelakanta bhaasyam.
Any references welcome.
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
