Khajuharo and newly discovered poetry
I was talking a friend of mine whose ancesstors where shilpins. He
referred to some old odd leaves left by his grandfather. He looked
through them for me and discovered the following stanza. As this differs
from what has been said so far, I thought that it might be of interest:
    yathaapanetu.m yatate sumaargaat
        tapasvino vajrabh.rd apsarobhi.h |
    tathaalaye kaamagatai.h prabimbair
        didhyaasataa.m vai ka.situ.m sthiratvam ||
-Nath
