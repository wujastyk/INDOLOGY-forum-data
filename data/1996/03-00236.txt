I have now tested all four possibilities. The results were:
U.K.
Both http://www.gold.ac.uk/jbe/ and http://www.gold.ac.uk/jbe/jbe.html
worked fine.
U.S.
http://www.cac.psu.edu/jbe/jbe.html worked fine.
http://www.cac.psu.edu/jbe/ produced a filelist from which you could select
jbe.html, whereupon everything worted fine.
This is a different result to my previous test!
I have test-downloaded successfully. Some browsers seem to have problems
recognizing the extension .SEA (for self-extracting archive) and either
don't download or perhaps download as TEXT instead of binary. In such a
case it might be necessary to ensure that e.g. under helper applications
Stuffit is set to accept .SEA as well as .SIT extensions.
If you are trying to access by ftp, then the files must be downloaded in
binary mode.
We could put the files up in binhexed form so that they would download as
text, but they would be very large that way; so we are trying to avoid
that.
If none of the above covers your case, Lars, please email me with further
details.
