[Q]jyoti.h'saastra - what is "catarchic"?

No more than a guess: could it perhaps be a misspelling of "catachric"? I
haven't seen this term either, but it is not inconceivable that it could be
related to "catachresis", i.e., [improper] blending -- in this connection
perhaps of astrological systems.
Maybe someone else knows more, or has a more plausible theory? And perhaps
it would help to know where this expression is met with?
