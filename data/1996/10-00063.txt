The colophon says:

	iti "suklayajurvedagataa muktikopani.sat samaaptaa

To be found in (English title): Ii"saadi-a.s.tottara"satopani.sada
with different readings and explanatory notes. Comp. & ed. by Vasudev
Lakshman Panashikar. (Repr.) Varanasi: Chowkhamba Vidyabhawan 1990
(originally a Nirnaya Sagara edition, photomechanically reproduced).

I think there are other Upanishad collections out there that contain
this text, too.

If you want an overview you may take L'Inde Classique. In one of the
appendices you will find a list of all the Upanishads mentioned in the
Muktika. If my memory serves me right, Renou and Filliozat give also
other lists (from Max Mueller and (?) Albrecht Weber).

Hope this helps.
