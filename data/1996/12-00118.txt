Goddess who evolved out of a figure made using a var
 Hello!
 I want to know the story(ies)  of a  goddess who evolved out of a
" figure"  made using a variety of herbal plants. There are various versions
 of this story, as I understand.
Can the indology net give me a referance where I can read more 
about this? Your versions of the story would be also 
interesting.
We have "nava  paasanam"  in conjunction with "Skandar" (Palani 
Murugan).
Thanks and regards
 Saba Mylvaganam
