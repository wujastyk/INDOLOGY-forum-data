The idea about not giving non-professionals unrestricted access (read and
write privileges) to the list does not imply that these could not ask
questions. Non-professionals may ask any member of the list individually a
question, and if s/he cannot answer it, s/he can forward the question to
the list (this is already being done in some cases). In this way, every
member of the list becomes an "editor" in a small way. The important thing
is to restrict the traffick on the net to serious stuff and exclude the
nonsense.
