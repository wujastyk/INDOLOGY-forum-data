address change
Dear friends and colleagues, 
since I have accepted the Chair of Classical Indology at the South Asia 
Institute of the University of Heidelberg from 1st of Oct 1996, e-mail to 
Berne will reach me only with some delay. I will let you know my new e-mail 
adress as soon as I know it myself.
Best wishes and greetings, A.M.
