The sevens types of marriage in Hinduism.
I recall once having read about seven different types of matrimony in
Hinduism, each distinguished from the other by the manner in which the
girl was given to, or taken by, the husband. I would like to know in which
text(s) these marriages are explained in detail and also the names of the
marriages.
Off the top of my head (and therefore probably not exact) I remember one
type being where the girl was allowed to choose her own husband, another
where the girl was abducted by the husband, yet another when the devas
gave her to her husband.
Thanks in advance.
