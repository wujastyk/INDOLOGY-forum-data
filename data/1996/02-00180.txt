Analogies to Kabbalah
As far as I understand, the various Tantric traditions,
to name one, abound with such concepts... the description 
of the Goddess as                    
                mAtrkArNa svarUpiNI
                a-ka-ca-Ta-ta-pAdi varNe
                ekAkSarI
etc. or using bIjAkSara are examples of this.
A.Bharati's "The Tantric tradition", Douglas Brooks's
books, "Understanding Mantras" edited by Harvey Alper,
Andre Padoux's "Vac: the concept of the word in selected
Hindu Tantras", may be of help...
-Srini.
