>>For example, a god being the embodiment of the Veda;
>>the letters of scripture being related to living           
>>creatures, deities, or the cosmos as to giving it      
>>life, form, definition, body, etc. through their             
>>organization or arrangement; the Vedas as a living
>>thing; the letters of the scriptures being the
>>mystical name of a god, etc.
 
As far as I understand, the various Tantric traditions,
to name one, abound with such concepts... the description 
of the Goddess as                    
                mAtrkArNa svarUpiNI
                a-ka-ca-Ta-ta-pAdi varNe
                ekAkSarI
etc. or using bIjAkSara are examples of this.

>>If anyone can help with general or specific references, 
>>it will be much appreciated. 

A.Bharati's "The Tantric tradition", Douglas Brooks's
books, "Understanding Mantras" edited by Harvey Alper,
Andre Padoux's "Vac: the concept of the word in selected
Hindu Tantras", may be of help...
