While there is perhaps no law prohibiting having a school to teach any 
particular language, the question is rather what the medium of 
instruction is.  I believe that several sates have, in fact, placed 
restrictions on even private schools teaching in English and other 
language (eg. Urdu; Marathi in Karnataka, etc.) mediums. But possibly 
this has only to do with government recognition -- which is required in 
order to get the government to pay the teachers' salaries.  I am not 
clear on the details, but my point is that the examples cited evade the 
major political issues concerned.
