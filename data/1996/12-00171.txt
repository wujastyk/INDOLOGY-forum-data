There are many companies in India who sell Devanagari font (True Type), but
most of them are not very beautiful. One really very nice Company I found
at a recent exhibition in Delhi is LEAP. They have a lot of beautiful True
Type fonts for many if not all Indian Languages and they even offer a
Software in which automatically the right ligatures are formed while typing
as on a Hindi-typewriter. Moreover, text can be directly (merely by
changing the font formatting) transcribed into international roman
transliteration or into any other Indian script. The software and fonts are
available both for MS-Windows & Macintosh. I was really impressed by their
demonstration.

The Software:
	1. Leap: Indian Language Word Processor on Windows
	2. ISM: ISFOC Script Manager (needed for proper Sanskrit)
The Address of the company:
	Gist Group,
	Centre for Development of Advanced Computing,
	Pune University Campus, Ganesh Khind, 
	Pune 411 007, INDIA
