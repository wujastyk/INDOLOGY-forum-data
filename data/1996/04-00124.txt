 The last statement is incorrect, because the makara samkranti is the 
Sun's entry into the
sidereal constellation of Capricorn, whereas the uttarAyaNa always starts
with the entry of the Sun into the tropical sign of Capricorn, that is, at
the time of the Winter solstice.  These two no longer coincide, as has
been explained, because of precession.
