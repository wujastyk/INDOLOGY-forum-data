POSITION AVAILABLE IN HINDI-URDU LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE

 The Department of South and Southeast Studies invites applications for a

Literature to begin with Academic Year 1997-98. The rank of the appointment
is open and will depend on the qualifications of the successful applicant.

Literature or a closely related field and native or near-native proficiency
in the spoken and written forms of these languages. Significant academic
training in Sanskrit and/or Persian will be a distinct advantage. Knowledge
of an additional modern Indian language is desirable. Research
specialization with an emphasis on modern or contemporary Hindi or Urdu
