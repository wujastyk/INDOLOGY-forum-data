No, I also go to the temple to steal footwear.
As Julius Caesar has said: "Veni.  Vidi.  Givenchy."  
I'm guided by an ancient Sanskrit inscription 
that I found on the wall of my house in Srirangam,
embodying the noblest of human values:
   "AkAshAt patitam tOyam   yathA gachchati sAgaram
    sarva loka pAdarakshA:  pratigachchanti mAm tathA"
Or to put it in our mutual mothertongue, Tamil:
   "siRappu kettAlum
    seRuppu kidaiththathu"
Or again, as the Tamil poetess Auvaiyar might have 
said ("aaththich chUdi" style):
   "kAlaNi kayattEl"
Even Meerabai warns us from the sixteenth century:
   "pag ghunghru BAANDH Meera naachi re"

In Gujarati they greet each other:
   "Shoe chhe?  Saaru chhe"
And for the benefit of German Indologists visiting
Indian temples:
   "Pilger, ich hoff' du findest Ruh'
    vergesse aber nicht dein' Schueh'  "
Happy shoehunting.  Have a Nike day,
Narayan Sriranga Raja.
