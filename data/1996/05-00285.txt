What about the oral tradition then? Besides, if one knows about the
existence of the 'samrata-siddhaanta' and one does not find any prior mention 
of astronomy in the texts we have now, one cannot immediately conclude
that no astronomy existed in India prior to the 18th century. There may be
other texts, yet undiscovered or lost, or there might have been a
disruption in the oral tradition.

I do not have any problem with the Greeks having discovered everything in
astronomy before the Indians. I would, however, like to look into the
problem of dating with the mathematical and computational tools available
through modern astronomy. 

I find that Indians/Europeans tend to think that the ancient Indians/Greeks did
almost everything in most subjects! I think we should ask Martians, if
they exist, to do this study for us as they would not have our bias! :-)
