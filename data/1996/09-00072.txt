Well, I am looking forward to your sandeshas! There is some Net communicating, 
by amateurs, in Sanskrit. It works very well. Practically everyone uses 
ITRANS's scheme of transliteration. You professionals might think of doing it 
in anushthubha; that should be easy ... :-) A convention for the Vedic accents
has to be agreed upon, though.

As for describing Skt as a dead language, would you then classify Latin & Greek
as mummified languages?
