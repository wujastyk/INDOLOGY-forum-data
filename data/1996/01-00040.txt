In a recent letter, Professor Barlingay wrote: "The dates of the Jnanesvar
conference will be November 24 to November 30, 1996. It will be like a
joint session or parliament of Indian Philosophical Congress, All India
Darshan parishad, Maharashtra Tatvajnana Parishad, World Philosophers Meet,
Afro-Asian Philosophy Conference, etc. I am giving below the exact e'mail
address. It should be typed as follows -
        G=MITPUNE S=MAEERPUNE P=VSNBOM A=VSNB C=IN"

Now you know as much as I do. The above is an exact quote.
