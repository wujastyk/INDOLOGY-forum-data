Images of a manuscript of the Yogasutras
I have added to the digital images available from the INDOLOGY web page.
Having put the Isa Upanisad up before, I have now added a manuscript of
the Yogasutras of Patanjali, taken from the Wellcome Institute Library.
See http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html under "Digital art...".
I am not satisfied with the quality of the images, and when I have time I
shall re-scan the manuscript.  Sorry folks!  But something is better than
nothing.  This process of digitization is a learning experience for me.
