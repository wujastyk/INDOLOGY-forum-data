Hello Gentlemen - 

Please pardon my changing the topic from copyright laws and ethics to the
Saamaveda.

In his translation of the Saamaveda (Veda Pratishthana, New Delhi,
1991-1992), Satya Prakash Sarasvati mentions that the aaraNya
kaaNDa/arcika of the puurvaarcika is comprised of four separate parva-s,
namely the arka parva, dvandava parva, vaacovrata parva, and the shukriya
parva. But in doing so, he fails to mention the verse numbers at which
these parvas begin and end.

Can anyone provide me with information regarding these divisions of the
AaraNya KaaNDa, or lead me to sources which could?

Thank you.

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
