Copyright
A further point on Ken's message: fighting copyright battles in foreign
countries is difficult and expensive.  But, if copyright is established on
a product, then it can be defended in most countries, because almost all
countries in the world are signatories to the International Copyright
Convention, and have agreed at a supra-national level to abide by its
terms.
Best wishes,
Dominik
