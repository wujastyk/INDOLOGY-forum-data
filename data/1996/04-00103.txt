Obituary notices for the next world Sanskrit Conference
Dear colleagues,
Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji, chair of the organizing committee of the next
World Sanskrit Conference, has been asked by the IASS to collect notices
of indologists who have passed away since the last conference in
Melbourne.
If you know of such persons, could you kindly inform Dr Swamiji, at
        swamiji at giasbg01.vsnl.net.in
Dr Swamiji follows INDOLOGY, and already knows the sad news about Alan
Entwhistle.
With thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
