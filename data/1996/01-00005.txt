Mising Bane Kebang: meaning of name of group
I badly need to know the literal meaning of the name of the Mising 
political 
group Mising Bane Kebang.  There seems to be no dictionary of the Abor 
(a.k.a. Mising, Adi, Miri) language to English or another language, only 
from other languages to Mising.  Is there anyone out there who knows Abor 
or who has studied the movement and can give me a translation?  I am of 
course paging and consulting all the books on the Mising for this 
information.
Thanks awfully and Happy New Year,
