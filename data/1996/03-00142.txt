Jaina concordance
In the context of the useful information supplied by Prof. Falk and the
kind offer of help made by him, I should mention that impressive work in
computerization of Jaina gaathaa literature and bibliography of writings on
Jainism (including Hindi and Gujarati writings, which are very important in
the case of Jainism but which rarely receive publicity outside India) has
been carried out at: Sharadaben Chimanlal Educational Research Centre,
"Darshan,  Opposite Ranakpur Society, Shahibag, Ahmedabad 380 004. 
Another promising place for computerized Jaina materials is: Shree Mahaveer
Jain Aradhana Kendra, Koba 382 009, near Ahmedabad.  -- aklujkar
