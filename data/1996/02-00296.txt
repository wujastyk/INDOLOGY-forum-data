Veda`s demise at NY Hinduja Ctr.
Dear Witzel ,
The Ny hinduja center might have been started for the noble cause of spreading Hknowledge on hindu culture in the west . But i the recent years it is   
using all that hugh sums of money to making hinduism cheap . The sacred
books  of Hindus are treated with no respect . Titles are used using the word " 
" vedas " in and out of context freely as if  thet are some comedy books.
The damage the Hinduja center is doing to Hinduism is not worth the support it
recieves in the form of hugh money to spread a noble cause ( which is
forgotten and not done)    M.Rajagopalan
