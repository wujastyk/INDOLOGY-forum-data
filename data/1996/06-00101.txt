Question
Dear Folks,
	There is a text called Kaa"sikaa by Nandike"svara with a 
commentary by Upamanyu.  This text interprets the Paninian Shivasuutras a 
la the Tantric doctrines of Kashmir Shaivism.  K.C. Pandey discusses this 
work in his Abhinavagupta book.  However, I have not seen any reference 
to this text or its commentary in a number of Kashmir Shaiva works I have 
consulted.  I cannot say I have checked into every one of these works.  
Has anyone come across a discussion or citation of these texts in any of 
the Kashmir Shaiva texts?  In the tradition of grammar, Naage"sabha.t.ta 
refers to it.  Would be nice to know of any older citations or references.
	Thanks.
