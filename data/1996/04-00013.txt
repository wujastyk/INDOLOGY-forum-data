Some weeks ago (while I was out of the country), several
newspapers apparently published an AP/Reuters story to the effect that
"Archaeologists have discovered the birth chamber of Buddha under a
temple in southwestern Nepal [i.e. at Lumbini], putting to rest an
international debate..."  The article that I have seen also mentions a
"commemorative stone atop a platform of seven layers of bricks dating from
the era of...Asoka."

Does anyone have any additional reliable information on this supposed
discovery?  Was the "commemorative stone" inscribed?  Is there any other
good evidence that this discovery is in fact what it is being presented
as?  Or is it another Noah's Ark/Alexander's Tomb job?  I couldn't help
noticing that the story also noted that "Nepal...plans to turn Lumbini
into a major tourist attraction."
