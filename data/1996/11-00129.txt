????Cash Cows for Hindi teachers?????
Reply to Ruth Schmidt,
I apologise for my phrasing.  My intention was to not to claim that Nepali
isn't the primary language of Nepal, but to state that it is possible to
find far more speakers of Hindi in Nepal than of any other language not
belonging to that country.
