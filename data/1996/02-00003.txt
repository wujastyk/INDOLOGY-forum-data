siva vinadhara
Hi
can anybody help me with the name of a(n English language preferably) text 
dealing with the iconology and signifiacnace of Siva as vinadhara?
Or even any ideas as to when this image first emerges. The earliest 
sculpture that I can find is from Asanpat, about 5th century.
Thanks in advance
