Dear Colleagues:
	I would like to let you know that the Royal Netherlands Academy
of Arts and Sciences has permitted ASNIC to post Prof.  Lariviere's paper
                 
		"Protestants, Orientalists, and Brhmanas: 

                    Reconstructing Indian Social History" which was  

first published as a part of the 1994 Gonda Lecture,Gonda Foundation,
Netherlands.  I had posted its abstract previously. Now you can access
