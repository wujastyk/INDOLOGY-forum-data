 Dear Indologists,

   I can end this argument on the MBh files with a fair and objective judgment presented by Dr. Joel Tatelman. I thank him from heart for it. 
Also I thank all those who joined in discussion and gave me valuable instructions and comments on this matter.  
I am sorry for poluting this academic network for several days.
But I don't think it was quite futile. 
We had to discuss on the problem of sharing digitalized files sooner or later.
Through this argument I feel we have come a little bit closer to the consensus about this matter.
Let's exchange our files with due respect to each other and establish the global Sanskrit archives through this network.    
I will continue contributing this society in a positive way.
