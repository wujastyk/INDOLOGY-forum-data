Male earpieces
Dear Will Wagers
Thank you for your response. The piering of ears of slaves seems to be a
Middle Eastern custom and was brought to India from Iran as the Persian
idiom shows which I quoted. 
The Indians (Hindus) had other ideas what an ear ornament could be as the
name Kapalakundala shows which is an epithet of Kali and used as a title
of Bankim Chandra Chatterji"s famous novel.  The heroine of this book, of
course, did not wear skulls on her ears. But the name alone shows  how 
powerful notions are connected with the piercing of the ear.
