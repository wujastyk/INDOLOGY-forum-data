"RE: INDOLOGY
Dominik,
I hate to add yet another suggestion to an already long list of suggestions 
for re-arranging the system for INDOLOGY, but here goes nothing:
Why not just leave the list - closed to non-members - unmoderated? If an 
advertisement or chain-letter is posted, that member would just be removed 
from the list with no further warning. If however, accusations, etc., 
are flung across the screen, then the individual involved would  
receive a warning (up to 3 altogether? 2?) and would only be removed if 
his/her conduct continued to be abusive. That way there would not be the 
need to edit the list and no one who is interested but without academic 
'credentials' would be excluded. 
Just thought I'd add that. At any rate, I also whole-heartedly support 
every attempt at bringing INDOLOGY back to where it should be (and was not 
so long ago)
