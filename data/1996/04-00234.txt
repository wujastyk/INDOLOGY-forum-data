in such sad disarray. However, there are some good people around and one 
of two resourceful institutes; call in at the Indian Ciuncil for 
Philosophical Research (see Dr Ashok Vora), 4th floor, Rajendra Bhavan, Deen 
Dayal Upadhyay Marg, New Delhi; and go see two of the doyens of Indian 
philosophy in India, Sijabijan Bhattacharyya in Calcutta (via Dept of 
Philosophy, Calcutta University), and Daya Krishna in Jaipur (lives at 
9 Campus Residence, Jaipur University, Jaipur).
Best wishes
