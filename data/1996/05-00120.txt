De Saussure's PhD thesis topic was the genitive absolute in Sanskrit, so
there is no question that he was well acquainted with the language.  The
degree of his acquaintance with the grammatical schools, and Bhartrhari in
particular, is less clear.

I am also unaware that the Sanskrit grammarians ever made a
synchronic/diachronic distinction beyond the primitive "bhasayam" and
"chandasi" of Panini. The doctrine of sabdanityata and of the levels of
language etc. have to do not with depth in time, but with "depth in
consciousness" or perhaps "depth in linguistic abstraction", if I can use
those terms.
