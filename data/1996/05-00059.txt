Bharhut stupa
I have no personal experience with this subject, but I'm listing below some
books that may be helpful in your quest.
Coomaraswamy, A.K. History of Indian and Indonesian Art, New York, 1927.
Society of Oriental Art. Vol. VI, 1938.
Cunningham, A. The Stupa of Bharhut.  London, 1879.
Barua, B. Bharhut. Calcutta, 1934.
Barua, B. and Sinha, K.G.  Bharhut Inscriptions.  Calcutta, 1926.
I realise these references are all a bit old.  Hope they are helpful.
