Hart Defouw and Robert Svoboda, _Light on Life: an Introduction to the
Astrology of India_ (Penguin/Arkana, 1996). ISBN 0-14-019507-6.
(I have not read this book; just mentioning it.  Svoboda's book on
ayurveda, also with Penguin/Arkana is unfortunately not useful as a
historical introduction or guide to the subject.)
