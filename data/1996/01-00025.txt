Subject: html and sanskrit studies--anyone know who's into it???
Message-ID: <161227022287.23782.13888697003971999705.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

one further question after my last re. Sahota's Kyoto dissertation on 
purusha.

does anyone know anyone doing sanksrit--transliterated or 
otherwise--online, on CDROM, and--especially--in hypertext mark-up 
language?  I know that George Landau out of Brown Univ. in Rhode Island 
has marked himself as the trend-setting guru of the electronic 
soon-to-be-revolution in academia.  What of indology and html?  please 
also specify if you know of any good software for importing the tedious 
array of devanagari diacritics into/onto html and the WEB.

many thanks and happy 1996
