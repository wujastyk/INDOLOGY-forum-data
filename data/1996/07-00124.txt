Dear Colleagues:

I attach herewith, a guide to electronic citation which was prepared and
published by H-AFRICA editor Mel Page.  This is copyrighted, but may be

The following suggestions for citations of Internet sources in
history and the historically based humanities are derived from the
essential principles of academic citation in Kate L. Turabian,
*A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations,
*5th ed. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1987).  I have also
draw upon suggestions from some of the works listed below.  The
guide has been improved by the the students of my Historical
Methods classes at East Tennessee State University and my fellow
H-AFRICA editors whom I thank for their assistance.
Since the Internet is an evolving institution, this guide is not
intended to be definitive.  Corrections, additions, comments,
suggestions, and criticisms are therefore welcome.  Please address
them to the author at:
                   pagem at etsuarts.east-tenn-st.edu
When the need for revisions and updates become apparent, new versions
of the guide will be issued.
