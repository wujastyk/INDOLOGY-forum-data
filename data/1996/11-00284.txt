Auto-drivers would, of course, know Hindi since they have to talk to all

what about others in Bangalore? -- shopkeepers, clerks, etc? I still 
don't believe that Hindi is better understood than English.
Karnataka has slightly more than the national average
That means little more than 10% -- not a very big percentage. On the 
other hand for English, there are people who speak English fluently and 
use it extensively at home plus a large number who use it as their second 
language and who go to English medium schools.
I'm quite sure
Remember that Bangalore has a large number of AngloIndians and Mangalore 
Christians who speak English fluently *and* speak it at home. I don't 
know what the percentage is, though.

The same is true of Hindi -- if you're in the habit of initiating 
conversation in Hindi, then those who speak it will reply in Hindi if 
they know that language. That's the problem with basing these 
observations on personal experience -- much depends on your own role as a
controlling factor in these experiences. The same goes for my personal 
experiences, so what we need is information from empirical research on 
attitudes, usage etc. 
At this point, let's just agree to disagree.
