finale
Dear Indologits,
   I can end this argument on the MBh files with a very fair and objective judgment by Dr. Joel Tatelman. I thank him for it. 
I am sorry for poluting this academic network for several days.
But I don't think it was quite futile. 
Through this argument I think we have come a little bit closer to the consensusconcerning sharing digitalized files with each other.
I would like to continue contributing this society in a positive way.
