maatarizva
well-founded, etymologies from ad hoc folk etymologies, now and then it
appears that the way to distinguish them is this: if it comes from a
professor of philology from a distinguished European university it is
etymology; if it comes from a native speaker it is folk etymology.  The name
mAtari'zvan illustrates this nicely.
How fascinating! Kittel's Kannada lexicon gives this lexical entry:
maatarizva = wind.
Is it a far cry from agni to wind? Regards, Kalyanaraman.
