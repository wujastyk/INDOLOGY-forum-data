That is exactly my point. However, the other arguments had better be of a 
conclusive nature if the case is to be decided. We come across such 
situations in the physical sciences and engineering almost everyday. 
I am not saying that there was a "long tradition of writing" prior to 
Asoka. As I said in the earlier mail, the evidence for such a position is 
very weak, to say the least. 
I trust that the doubts over which are Asoka's earliest and which are his 
latest inscriptions have been resolved completely unambiguously. I seem to 
remember reading somewhere that what has been taken to represent the age 
of an inscription is actually no more than an indication of geographical 
variation. If the case for time dependence (as opposed to regional 
variation) is iron-clad, that strengthens the argument that Asoka's scribes 
invented Brahmi. Not otherwise.
