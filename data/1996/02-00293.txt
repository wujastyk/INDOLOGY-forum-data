I am wondering about using UniCode compliant software for 
Hindi/Sanskrit/Panjabi.
Does anyone have experience of using Gamma's UniType software for these 
languages and if so what do they think of them. Or do you know of any othe 
UniCode compliant software for these languages? All comments would be very 
welcome.
