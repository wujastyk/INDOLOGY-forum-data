Janaka's vision of himself as a beggar
The "beggar" story doesn't appear in _The Concise Yogavasistha_ tr. Swami
Venkatesananda (Albany, New York: SUNY Press, 1984).  The story of King
Janaka is recounted there (pp.164 ff.), but he achieves insight through
reflection alone, and his interlocutor is not Yajnavalkya, but Vasistha.
