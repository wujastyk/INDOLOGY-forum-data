Etymology; semantics and phonetics: ancient sememe for  "mineral"

I will cite a few lexemes to elucidate the problems  'scientific etymology'
encounters (and has to overcome) if based only on ''sound laws':
kAvi = a red earth or ochre (Ka.Ta.Te.Tu.); kAva (M.)
kempu redness (Te.); kem- redness (Tu.); kEsu redness (Ka.); xEnso red
(Kurukh) with which link: cEdu, cEntu, cEppu, cEttu, cevappu red colour (Ta.)
with which link again:
cEdu red color (Ta.), jAdu, jAju id. (Ka.); cAyilya, cAliya = vermilion (Ma.)
with which link:
jAju, gAju = glass, gairika, dhAtu (Ka.); dhatu =mineral, metal (Santali)
kadA = silicious earth used in making glass, beads etc. (Si.); kAc, kAnc
glass, quartz (Nepali); dhAtu = substance (Rigveda); metal, mineral ore esp.
of red color (Manu); dhAu = metal, red chalk (Pkt.); ore esp. copper (Nepali)
It would appear that the semantic laws supersede sound laws and even 'vision
laws' which yielded early scripts; the dominant visible'element' is redness
which is linked to the sememe: kAca
This also yields kancu = bronze.
We will find that this sememe finds expression in the Harappan seal
pictorial motifs, e.g. the so-called 'water-carrier' sign: kAjahAraka. I
will explain in a separate presentation the interpretation of many seals as
representing the professional artisans: the lapidaries, copper-workers,
braziers....
