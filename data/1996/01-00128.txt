Film on Holi
To Members of the List:
A former student of mine now in graduate studies in folklore at another
institution has asked me if I know of any films on the Holi festival.  She
wishes to do a comparative-ritual study of festivals that both have a sacred
theme and involve the character of social chaos (at least temporarily).   If
anyone knows of any visual materials on Holi, please let me know. 
Thanks!
