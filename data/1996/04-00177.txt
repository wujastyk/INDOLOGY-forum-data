The nodes, known as rAhu (north node) and ketu (south node), are rarely
mentioned in what is generally considered to be the oldest stratum of
astrological texts (such as varAhamihira's bR^ihajjAtaka), but in classical
texts, they are no less important than the other seven 'planets', from the
Sun to Saturn. The most universally used mehod of astrological
prognostication, a 120-year planetary cycle based on the 'natural' life
expectancy in kaliyuga and known as viMs'ottarIdas'A, allots a total of 25
years to the nodes. And of course, in temples where images of the planetary
deities are installed, there are -- to my knowledge at least -- always nine
of them (navagraha): the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus,
Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu.

I'm not sure if this answers your question about the 'significance' of the
nodes, or if you had in mind their astrological connotations as well. (I
suppose most of us on this list are in some sense governed by rAhu, who
represents foreigners, barbarians, mlecchas -- although there may be a few
ketu people out there, too: wise men, renunciates, mumukshus...)
