Hi,
I have sent a rather detailed private note to Lars Fosse about Newton &
Leibnitz; unfortunately, I no longer have a copy of it. I was trying to
make the point that they discovered two rather different approaches to two
different kinds of problems. Newton asked himself the question:' Knowing
how a particle moves now, in terms of its speed and acceleration, how to
predict how it evolves in the future (or how was it in the past)?'; this
is differential calculus in a nutshell! Leibnitz said: 'Of all the
possible routes a particle can take, how should I choos the one in which
it spends less time for going from one fixed point to another (say)'; this
is  variational calculus highly simplified. All this is usually bundled
together as infinitesimal calculus.

We might infer many things and most of our inferences would be invalid.
Newton was the student of Barrow, here, and that influenced him to go into
the type of problems I mentioned above whereas Leibnitz was more
'philosophical' and sought questions about 'le meilleur des mondes' (as
Voltaire put it in his satirical portrayal of Leibnitz as Maitre Pangloss
in 'Candide'). Your statement above is too general. Both really INVENTED
quite new stuff!! The mathematical knowledge was not that 'common' as
Newton was at one of the best places to be for mathematics and Leibnitz
was not (which gives an indication of his towering mathematical
abilities). Circulation of ideas took a lot of time; they had no
preprints, no WWW, not even email! :-)
I wish to apologize for the lack of Indological content of the above.
