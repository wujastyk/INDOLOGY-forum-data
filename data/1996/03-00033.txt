"RE: INDOLOGY
Unmoderated but closed is definitely the best solution.  Moderation
is a lot of work and slows discussion up (and to some extent subverts
the whole idea of a discussion list).
There is, however, the further question: to remove wrongdoers
immediately, or to post one or more warnings.  Three strikes and
you're out is the *most* generous one should be!
