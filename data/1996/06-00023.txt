Subject: Rig Veda Question
Message-ID: <161227024948.23782.13128386622027608600.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have been working on a reconstruction of an--apparently--anonymous Rig 
Veda in electronic form, found in the RLIN (attributed to a Robert 
Kahn/Khan-- if anyone knows of him), and have a question re. the 
following viz parishishhTham.h:

These are
apparently later additions - from the nature of the language - I can
make sens out of most (:-)! One of these is the so-called
shriisuuktam.h. At the end of 10, there is a long parishishhTham.h
also.

Apparently, however, the e-text I am using does not include all of 
these.  In the interests of editing, answers to the following would be of 
great help.  Our goal is to provide a downloadable e-RV sometime soon in 
ITRANS form, with--hopefully pending some joiner-inners as 
proofreaders--a devanagari version with accents in a few months.  

Could anyone please offer a brief thumbnail as to the nature of these 
components and their relative place in the text: temporally, 
authoritatively, and syntactically.

If this is not a question of general interest to the list, please direct 
your replies to me directly.  I also welcome any reports on the 
mysterious origin of the text if the names above ring a bell with anyone.

Thank you in advance,
