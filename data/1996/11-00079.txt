 These topics are discussed at lengh in the MImAMsA. According to her view
sentences about the nature of things are closer to arthavAda than to vidhi.
As arthavAda's they have no sense of their own but depend on the vidhi they
are produced for. A ascertainment of the state of things only makes sense if
it supports directly or indirectly the understanding of vidhi, e.g. to state
the contitions that should be known to be able to follow the vidhi. 

KumArila states explicitely (ZlokavArttika, Zabdapariccheda 5) that
statements about the nature of things (svarUpakathana) are of secondary or
dependent importance (aGgatva) in [his] ZAstra. - This is the view of the
MImAMsA; NyAya-VaizeSika would probably not agree with this.
