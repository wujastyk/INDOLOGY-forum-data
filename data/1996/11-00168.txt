Dhik taan! (fwd)
Now that I remember the first half of the verse, it does not involve a pun
on the notation of drum-beats.  However, here is that first half:
	matir eva balaad gariiyasii
	tad-abhaave kari.naam iyam da"saa
	Second half:
	iti gho.sayatiiva .di.n.dima.h
	kari.no hastipakaahata.h kva.nan
	All the best,

Re: Dhik taan!
A likely candidate is a verse which again I remember only partially.  The
second half of this verse is as follows:
	iti gho.sayatiiva .di.n.dima.h
	kari.no hastipakaahata.h kva.nan
I again need to invoke Ashok's assistance.
	All the best,
