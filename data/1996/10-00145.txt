Copyright
As far as I know, the formal procedures Ken refers to are not strictly
necessary, or at least not necessary outside the USA.  I believe (but I
may be wrong) that to assert your ownership of the copyright of a copyable
product, all you have to do is to include a copyright statement, or the
international copyright sign, name, and date, on the product.
...
I've just had a word with our legal department, and their informal opinion
confirms my belief: the assertion of copyright is all that is necessary to
stake the claim.  It is apparently not necessary to go through any more
formal procedure.
Things may be different in the USA, and our specialist in US law is being
consulted about this.  More later.
Best wishes,
