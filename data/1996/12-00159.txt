"Out of India"
Vidhyanath Rao wrote:
Italic populations were already settled in Italy in the 2nd m. B.C. 
and many of them were authentically "Italian". Between the 2nd and the 
1st they already had a well organized "federative" system and they had 
regular economic and religious exchange with Etruscans. Not to talk 
about language of course (see the *Tavole Iguvine*). 
For the most recent studies see the work of Prosdocimi and, more 
updated and with new discoveries, Augusto Ancillotti, *La civilta' degli 
Umbri*, Jama Edizioni Perugia, 1996. He also explains in detail the 
various (food etc.) sacrifices and offers transliteration and 
translation of the Tavole.
