I assume you don't have a postscript printer, so you may use Ghostscript
together with Ghostview. This software is free for personal, uncommercial
use and is implemented on many platforms(also DOS/Windows PCs). Ghostview is
the interpreter for graphical screen display. The latest version is 4.0
(maybe still not implemented for PC). One drawback: The installation is
somewhat tricky.

There is also commercial software like Freedom of Press (for the Mac) and
probably others.

Hope this helps.
