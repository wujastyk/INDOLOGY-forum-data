Boehtlingk and Roth have "eine Art Schabe" (Sanskrit-Woerterbuch, s.v.
tailapaayin), at least the references they give point to a small animal, a
sort of vermin, insect or whatever. The commentaries to Yaajnavalkyasm.rti
3.211 have "kii.tavi"se.sa"(Mitaak.sara, Baalakrii.daa). Similar Mahabh.
3.5509 ed. Calc., I have not checked Mark.Pur. 15.23. The probably related
tailapaayikaa is to be found in Amarako.sa 2.5.26 (with "paro.s.nii" as
paryaaya). The commentaries may provide further clues. See also
"Sabdakalpadruma, s. vocibus "tailapaayikaa", "tailapaa". -- If tailapaayin
means "bird" or "flying animal" then it would be a new entry in the
dictionary.

I have no idea what concerns "bholantikaa" (hapax legomenon?).
