Old Indologists, reply to Preciado-Solis
For various reasons I have just now joined the Indology list, but by 
kindness of colleagues I have seen Preciado-Solis's question about 
Stael-Holstein and Venis with notes by O. Freiberger and G. Zeller (1 
August). Freiberger referred to my collection and here follows, what I 
have found out about these two scholars. If someone knows the date of 
birth for Venis, I would be very thankful. To avoid complications with 
e-mail I have eliminated diacritics. I hope this answer will reach 
Preciado-Solis.
