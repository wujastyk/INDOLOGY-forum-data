Non-Postscript Printers
To the fellow who asked about printing Sanskrit documents on 
non-Postscript printers a few weeks ago:
Using UNIX Ghostscript, I've printed Postscript Sanskrit documents on a 
9-pin dot matrix printer.  It isn't particularly pretty-looking, but it's 
generally legible.

"Every fool may become a hero at one time or another.  Watch a man
do his most common actions; those are indeed the things which will 
tell you the character of a great man."
