Please do write to Mr Wikner and tell him you need the executable.  I
tried to convince him to put one into his distribution, but he wanted to
keep his zip file as small as possible.  However, if he hears from some
people who need the .exe, he may put one in a future distribution.

Best wishes,
Dominik
