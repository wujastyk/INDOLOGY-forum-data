Dear Indologists,

Charles Wikner's materials for Introductory Sanskrit are now available under
"Sanskrit" at the European mirror of ousia:

        http://www.inca.de/user/will/ousia/Indologist.html

Please use this site instead of Wikner's FTP site to download the materials.
That server is rather slow and overloaded. The larger files are zipped.

Regards,

Will Wagers        "Reality is the best metaphor."
