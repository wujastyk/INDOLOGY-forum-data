Subject: Req: "dirty" words in Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227026633.23782.10714135514561227044.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The y-root is the equivalent of the f-word.  Otherwise there are no taboo
words I can think of, indeed one of the oddities of Sanskrit is that the
vocabulary for sexual parts or things has no particular distinction into
the obscene, the neutral, the euphuistic, the medical, etc.; the words are
unmarked that way.  

(Or are they, and we are just deceived because the
traditional dictionaries work by series of synonyms, and in fact words
have differences of meaning and use the dictionaries don't discuss?
Didn't V. Raghavan do an article or two about this problem?  I believe
Kenneth Langer discussed the differences in words for women in his
dissertation (Women and love in Sanskrit coutry poetry : a semantic
approach, Harvard, 1978). If there are differences not noted in the
traditional dictionaries and therefore in the European language
dictionaries based on them, the vocabulary of sex may be marked.)
