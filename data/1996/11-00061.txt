TOCs IESHR and SocSci
Dear members,
        As subsciber to the SOUTH-ASIA-STUDIES list
<south-asia-studies-l at postbox.anu.edu.au> I received the forwarded message
of Philip McEldowney, University of Virginia library with TOCs of _The
Indian Economic and Social History Review_ and _SOCIAL SCIENTIST_ (both
covering the history of SA). It appears that the University of Virginia
library's homepage
<http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/> contains
links to the TOCs of these journals (incl. book reviews) which are updated
currently (along with other interesting links). I visited the homepage. It
is great!
My christmas present wish for INDOLOGY: that some institution would attempt
something similar with regard to indological journals! (There are probably
some obstacles connected with this apart from the work, like copyrights etc,
but these might not be insurmountable).
Regards
Mikael Aktor, Dpt. of History of Religions, University of Copenhagen.
