Same problem as above. From where, how, what is the hard evidence?
What was the number of settlers, versus number of raiders who came,
pillaged and left?
The last two were migrations of much smaller number of people, follwed by
a population explotion made possible by more intensive use of land by
the newcomes. This was not possible for Indo-Europeans. Indo_iranians
did not know even agriculture or wheel thrown pottery, remember :-^
This leaves only 5 cases out the original 11. #7 is a case of 
X pushed Y who pushed Z etc. After all, that is why it took nearly
600 years for the Goths to get North Africa. Now what is the
chronology of Indo-Aryan `invasion'? And, remember, the Indo-Aryans had
to drive their chariots over Afghanistan. Anybody measured the speed of
chariots over mountains? 
Movements of tribes numbering in 10,000s, I will swollow. But they hardly
displaced prexisting populations. They simply inserted themselves into
the preexisting populations in all cases of yours which I consider to be
cases of established migrations.
Looking forward to it.
