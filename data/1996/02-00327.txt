Indology list , inquiry about digest version .
International Buddhist Research and Information Center said:
Yes. In fact, the listserv software that INDOLOGY uses has quite a
number of nice features that you might want to know about (like being
able to turn INDOLOGY on and off when you are away for a few days,
without having to unsubscribe completely, etc.).
If you send the message
        help
to the address
        listserv at liverpool.ac.uk
you get information about the various controls that the software offers.
The main command for this sort of thing is "set".  If you send the
message
        help set
to the above address, you get a response which includes how to tell
INDOLOGY to send you not separate messages, but periodical
newsletter-like groupings of messages.
To get INDOLOGY digested, what you do is send the message
        set indology mail digest
to the address
        listserv at liverpool.ac.uk
