Munda & the Austric language group
I apologize that my message about "Gonda" languages vis-a-vis an Australian
connection, was sent to Indology twice.  (Sorry. . . . user error. . . with
the current discussion of abuses of Indology, this error was particularly
grievous. oops <g>;-)
I did find out more information to clarify my previous query:
"Most tribal groups in Central India speak Munda languages, which some
linguists classify as members of the Austro-Asiatic branch of the Austric
language group, which also includes the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which
range from Hawaii to New Zealand. (Father W.Schmidt first posed this
theory)."
My question is, is there reliable research on this linguistic connection or
is it a discredited theory?  Thanks for your help.
Re the ironic Temple Shoes message posted by:
The vision of ghunghru strung around Nikes is certainly a remarkable
example of high fashion hybridity.

I hope that this sort of query, from neophytes such as myself, are not
considered:

Thanks.
