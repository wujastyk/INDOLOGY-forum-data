I have done that, too, but it takes quite some time and patience.
I have seen that in some cases, such as the HOS Rg Veda, there are programs
for PC users to adjust their fonts. Those programs, needless to say, won't
work on a Mac. And in that particular case, since the RV has also accents
besides the basic diacritics, the time and patience requirement went really
up. (I needed to set up a specific sequence to do the replacements, etc.)
Is there any better way?
Best wishes,
