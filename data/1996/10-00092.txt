Upgraded Mahaabhaarata again
The Kyoto archive is available as a link through the INDOLOGY web site
  http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
under the heading
  Virtual archive of e-texts
for those of us who like just pointing and clicking.
May I express my thanks to Profs. Tokunaga and Yano and colleagues for
their continued work on the Mbh and Ram texts, and especially for the
amazing generosity of Prof. Tokunaga in deciding to share his work freely
with the world of scholarship.
Best wishes,
Dominik
