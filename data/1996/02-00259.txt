[Query] Was Sanskrit ever spoken by "all"?
I have discussed this subject, or at least some issues related to it, in an 
article entitled "On 
drawing socio-linguistic distinctions in Old Indo-Aryan: The Question of 
K.satriya Sanskrit and related problems," in the just-published book The 
Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and 
Ethnicity, ed. George Erdosy (Berlin/NY: de Gruyteer, 1995),  293-306.
