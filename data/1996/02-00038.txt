"As you may know": in fact I don't and I am very interested by that subject
also. I have never heard of that site and if it is really as big and as old
as Mohenjodaro, precise data should be made available to the scientific
community as soon as possible.
Does Dr. Kalyanaraman or anybody else has any more precise information
about that site (an excavation report, for example, will be fine) and can
tell me where I can get it.
Thanks in advance.
