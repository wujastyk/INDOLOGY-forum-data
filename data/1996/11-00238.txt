Q:  The Goddess Sati & Indian Geography
Re the dispersal of Sati's body, there is a comparative paper in C von
Fuerer-Haimendorf (= Fuerer- with umlaut) ed. Asian Highland Societies, New
Delhi Sterling, 1981, and, as is there mentioned, a more specific paper on
the puranic material by D C Sircar in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society
of Bengal Letters 14: 1-108, 1948.
