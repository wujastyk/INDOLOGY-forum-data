To members of the indology list,

We herewith announce a new panel at the 14th European Conference on 
Modern South Asian Studies to be held in Copenhagen from August 21th to 24th
1996. The titel of the panel will be:

The history and role of indigenous Sanskrit and Middle Indic (Pali and 
Prakrit) studies in the social and religious context of modern South Asia.

The aim of the panel is to consider the largely unexplored history and 
role of Sanskrit and Middle Indic (Pali and Prakrit) in the social and 
religious context of South Asia in the 19th and 20th centuries. The 
conveners invite papers approaching the topic from a historical or 
sociological perspective with particular regard to the religious context 
of Sanskrit and Middle Indic studies, thus making it possible to shed 
light on various aspects of the transmission of traditional learning in 
South Asia.
