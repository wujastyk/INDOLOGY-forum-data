I found Sethna's arguments convincing including his identification of

I thought he addressed the Aryan issue, Dionysus as Shiva, the dating of
the Buddha, Panini - generally the whole of ancient indian history (he
retained the relative order and time differences of accepted events/figures
but pushed the anchor back a few hundred years, with the exception of the
Aryans/Indus Valley). It's been a couple years since I looked at the book,
so perhaps I'm mistaken.
