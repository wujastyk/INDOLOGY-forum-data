I do not know of library holdings of this work, but I have seen a modern 
reprint of it. Unfortunately I do not remember the publishing details. I 
think it was from a Rajasthani press and within about the last 10 years.

Does anyone know if a copy of rapoTa maradumashumaarii raajamaaravaaRa
baabata sana 1891 iisavii exists in its entirety in any library of the 
United States or United Kingdom?  This is the Hindi census report 
compiled by Munshi Deviprasad, which includes a volume of Marwar caste 
histories.
