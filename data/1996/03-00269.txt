Indologist web Page
Dear List Members,
Thx to those of you who notified me of the problem with the Indologist page.
Apparently, our server was the victim of a net hoodlum who deleted our
public directory.
It seems to be back up. Let me know if you have any problems or suggestions.
BTW, the page has a new URL:
        http://denton.computek.net/pub/wagers/ousia/Indologist.Shtml
The only difference is the file extension begins with an "S". (This allows
me to use server side includes.)
Please note the new URL.
Regards,
Will wagers at computek.net
