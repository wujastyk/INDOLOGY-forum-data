I am not sure that agastya is Canopus but Canopus is the second brightest star
in the sky, after Sirius, and is in the southern constellation of Carina. It is
quite easily spotted next to the Southern Cross (Crux) , because of its being 
the only very bright object in that region of sky. Its declination is 52 
degrees south so, it is only visible to observers below a latitude of 38 
degrees south. That includes practically the whole of India.

I hope this helps.
