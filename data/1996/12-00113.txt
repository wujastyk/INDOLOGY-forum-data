"Out of India"
V. Rao wrote:
Large scale migrations have occurred quite regularly within Europe and out
of Europe for the last 3000 years. 
E.g.:
1) Hittites into Asia Minor (3rd millenium B.C.?)
2) Indo-Aryans into Iran and India (2nd millenium B.C.)
3) Greek tribes into Greece (2nd millenium B.C.)
4) Italic tribes into Italy (2nd millenium B.C)
5) Celtic tribes into France and Britain, followed by
6) Germanic tribes, reaching Scandinavia possibly 800 B.C.
7) Germanic tribes into Gaul, Northern Italy, Spain and North Africa (end of
1st millenium B.C. until about 5-600 C.E.)
8) Magyar tribes into Hungary (800 C.E)
9) Norsemen into Northern Britain, Ireland, Hebrides, the Shetlands,
Iceland, Greenland about 1000 C.E.)
10) The enourmous transfer of Europeans from Europe to the Americas during
the last 500 years
11) The migration of Europeans to Australia during the last 200 years.
Large-scale displacement of people do not happen every day, but they
certainly do occur.
It will be published in the series Acta Humaniora of the Faculty of Arts of
Oslo University. I handed it in 4-5 months ago. I don't how far it has come
in the process.
This is precisely the sort of thing I found, too. Not only should you be
extremely careful with metrical statistics, but also with distributions of
linguistic features. For Indological statistics to succeed, you need endless
patience. There is no quick fix.
One of the things you have to know about cluster analysis is that it is an
explorative method, not a method that claims ability to prove anything.
However, if several different methods (or several sets of criteria) produce
the same clusters, you may have some reason to think that the elements of
the clusters really have something in common. But beware of too strong
conclusions.
