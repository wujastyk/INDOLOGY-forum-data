The word "upanishad"
Hello all,
The word "upanishad" is generally explained as upa+ni+sad "to sit down
nearby", etc, but some time ago, I saw another etymology suggested, which at
the time seemed to me to make good sense. However, my dilemma is this: I
remember neither the etymology itself, nor the text (book? article?) which
mentioned it. Can anybody help? I do realize that my question is not unlike
that of Nebuchadnezzar, but I hope that there may be a Daniel on this list
to answer it for me...  :-)
Thanks,
Martin Gansten
