legal aspects of ancient Indian medicine
I had to give a lecture recently on "traditional indian medicine and the
state", and the only thing I was able to find along the lines you
mention was a brief passage in Kautalya's _Arthasastra_, in which
punishments are laid down for medical malpractice (4.1.56).  The main
offence seems to be a doctor doing something life-threatening to a
patient without informing anyone.
I too would be very interested in any more information along these
lines.
Also, does anyone have any evidence from Sanskrit or Tamil literature
about ancient plagues or epidemics?
