If someone writes a "history of Indian literature"-volume, which I take to
be a general survey of the literature of a certain genre, it is very likely
that some people use it to get a first glimpse of a field they are
interested in. I would, for instance, perceive it as rather odd to find
ancient Greek terms of grammar in a history of vyaakara.na-literature -
terms which are not used anymore, and terms which are left unexplained. I
would also perceive it as out of place if an author of a book on the history
of _pramaa.na_-literature made liberal use of technical terms used in
Ancient Greek philosophy (of such terms which have vanished from common
knowledge in the course of history). Certainly, not only astronomers would
be interested in a history of jyoti.h'saastra. (And, wasn't there supposed
to be a difference between astronomy and astrology? :))

Anyway, thank you for the reference. And: Would there, by any chance, be a
Japanese translation of the revered Neugebauer-book?
