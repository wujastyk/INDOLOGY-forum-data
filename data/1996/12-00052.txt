Numeric notation in the SV and related works.
Hello,
I've come across, in the saamaveda and also in the chaandogya upaniShad,
sequences of numbers within verses which I am assuming are some sort of
notation system intended for accentuating syllables during chanting -
usually in the manner of ''32111. I've included examples indicating this
notation from the chaandogya upaniShad below.
I would like to know what these numbers represent and what they
are used for. I've considered looking at Wayne Howard's work on the
notation of the Jaiminiiyas, but thought that as the chaandogya is of
the Kauthuma shaakhaa, Howard's work might not be of much help. Perhaps
such assumptions are not to be made, eh? Any suggestions as to any
sources or treatises I could turn to, preferrably with English
interpretation, to allow me further insight on this topic?
Examples from the chaandogya upaniShad:
(where \m+ indicates vedic anusvaara.)
