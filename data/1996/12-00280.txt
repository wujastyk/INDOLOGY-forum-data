Kissa Tota Myna
Each of the folk traditions Ganesan mentions also has its equivalent in
Telugu and Kannada (and no doubt other Indian languages). Again, however,
I don't think there are any translations of the considerable work on these
traditions Indian scholars have done over the past several decades. The
Kuravanji-type traditions (but so, too are the others, from my limited
experience) are amazingly clever and entertaining.  It's a shame they have
never been described in Western languages. It's another example of how our
neglect of folk traditions has hampered our overall research and
understanding of SA traditions.
