Unfortunately the Library of Congress no longer engages in international
interlibrary loan (for financial reasons; the question is however being
reconsidered).  However in North America at least the following libraries
have it (those listed on OCLC): Berkeley, Chicago, New York Public, U.
Texas at Austin, U. of Washington, U. Wisconsin, U. British Columbia.
