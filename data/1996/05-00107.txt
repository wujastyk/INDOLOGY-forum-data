Mantras in Vedic rituals
"I'd greatly appreciate it if anyone could recommend some good
references on the use of mantras in Vedic ritual, or on the use of music in
early Indian rituals."
For mantras, the best place to start would be the book Mantra, edited by
Harvey Alper. The hardbound edition contains an extensive annotated
bibliography not included in the paperback.   For Vedic ritual itself, I
would recommend the introduction to Frits Staal's AGNI: The Vedic Ritual of
the Fire Altar, and the film of the same name by Staal and Gardener.
