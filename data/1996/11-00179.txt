RE: Encyclopedia of Kashmir Shaivism
The manuscript of this work was completed long ago, but it hasn't been published
yet. Dr. Pandit told me he had given it to a governmental organization in Delhi,
and as such things go, they are taking a very long time to bring it out. I doubt
it will be ready in the near future...
There are, of course, a number of works published by SUNY Press, Motilal
Banarsidass and Munshiram Manoharlal, though I presume you must be familiar with
these. Besides, a number of works have been translated into French and Italian.
Searching a catalog on the Internet should give you the full references for
these titles. Hope this helps.
