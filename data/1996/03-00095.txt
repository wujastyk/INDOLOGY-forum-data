Gondawanaland BhAsha?
Thanks for another comic relief!
Someone seems to have taken the geographical designation of the 
pre-continental shift, jurassic Gaia seriously...
Dravidian (Gondi) of course has no relation with the Australian languages 
African Eve speaking "gondwani"...
Just take a brief look at, e.g. S.W. Wurm,(ed.),  Australian Linguistic 
Studies, = Pacific Linguistics,Series C- No. 54, Austr. National University
1979. (or ask our Indological colleague at Canberra, Dr. Hercus 
who studies these languages as well).
Of course some of the Austr. languages have retroflex (cerebral) sounds
(Wurm, p.  452 sqq.) , -- but so do some Scandinavians, Dutch -- and
Americans... 
Though the chaotic carnival is over since ASH WEDNESDAY, there still are 
3 weeks to go until the FIRST of APRIL!!!
Cheers, M. Witzel.
