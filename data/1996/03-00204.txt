I have tested i t to work on non-local network.
However, I have no personal agenda in pushing of Beyondmail or any
other product as such. It is just happens to be the only product that
did  allow me to transmit in Devnagri script and I am just too eager
to start communicating devnagri text.
>I'm sorry to have to repeat that the technical problems are much greater
I would like to know about other problems that make Msoft to provide
standard fonts in Arabic, Cyrilic and Japanese etc to the exclusion of
Devnagri alone.

That is a long term solution and we must push for it but windows is a
very widespread and easily accessible. Most of can have at least
secondary access to it  at relatively low price just to avail exchange
of data. BTW Beyond mail is also being developed for Apple
environment. What is does, is that it appends the font data at the end
of each message and if we know the fonts that were used to create a
text they can just be read back.
Whatever may be our personal preferences, it is indisputable that MS
has beat all the other system. In the market place it is not always
the best product that succeeds and I do not have to quote the
examples.
Have a nice day.
