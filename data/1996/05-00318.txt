[Q] bholantikaa, tailapaayin
I should like to thank all those who helped me with the meaning of
"tailapaayin".  I have also now found the word in MW!  Can't think how I
missed it before.
"Cockroach" seems to be the consensus, though in my list from the
Kaa"sysapasa.mhitaa it is smack in the middle of an unambiguous list of
birds (or at least "pak.siis"), and other references suggest a bird too.
Ho hum.
That leaves "bholantikaa"  ... :-)
Again, many thanks.
