Did the name Hafiz imply a profession as a reciter or chanter in Mughal
times?  Jahangir mentions a Hafiz Ali Nad who was a reciter (Tuzuk, II, 69).
 The Ain-i-Akbari lists three chanter/musicians with that name.  Also what
was the difference between these men and the qissa-khwan of Babur's time?
 Any information or reading references on this subject will be greatly
appreciated.  Many thanks.  Amita Sarin
