R: kaarikai (2)
    R:  Kaarikai
    *************
There is a set of two medieval books on grammar,
Yaapparungkalam and Yaapparungkalak kaarikai.
In tamil, kaarikai means a girl too. Is it also the same
in Sanskrit?
An old proverb warns:
kaarikai kaRRuk kavi pATuvatilum,
   pErikai koTTip pizaippatu n^anRE!
(It is easier to make a living as a drummer in the army,
  than trying to become a poet after learning the hard "kaarikai"!)
