Harvard-Kyoto
I do not have the explanations with me here, but some time ago I received an
e-text from Hamburg with entirely unambiguous codes which allowed one to
write German, Skt., and seemingly anything.  Does someone have that material
at hand?  It was not quite readable on the screen, but could be converted
with, as I recall, zero ambiguity.
