Dvaita Mailing List & Dvaita Digest
Greetings.
One resource of possible interest to Indologists is the duet of the
Dvaita Mailing List and and Dvaita Digest (both mutually gatewayed)
which are devoted to discussing Dvaita, the dualist school of Vedanta.
The help file for the list/digest is at
http://www.eskimo.com/~dvaita/list/list_help.html
and a web archive is also available.  If you haven't seen it before,
please also try the Dvaita Home Page at
http://www.rit.edu/~mrreee/dvaita.html
Have a nice day.
Regards,
