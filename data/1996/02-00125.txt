Not only did the Christian theologians have problems with this boisterous
time of the year. The Roman philopher Seneca tried to remain aloof from all
the hullaboloo and urged all other sensible people to do the same, and
Pliny the younger even built a sound-proof room where he could spend the
Saturnalia without being disturbed by the noise and feasting outside. Why
are intellectuals such wet blankets?
