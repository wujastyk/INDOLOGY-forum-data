Right & Left
Hi,
Something has been puzzling me for a long time and I wonder if anyone can 
help me out.
Usually one comes across shlokas where the devi is placed at the left of the
deva; e.g. :-
niilaambujashyaamalakomalaN^gaM siitaa samaaropita vaama bhaagam.h |
paaNau mahaasaayaka chaaru chaapaM namaami raamaM raghuva.nshanaatham.h ||
and 
dakshine lakshmaNo yasya vaame tu janakaatmajaa |
purato marutiryasya taM vande raghunandanam.h ||
However, at the start of the ba.Daa bandii mochana one finds :-
sadaa bhavaanii daahine sanmukha rahe.n gaNesha |
paa.ncha deva rakshaa kare.n brahma vishhNu mahesha |
Can someone please explain the difference? Many thanks beforehand.
bye,
Girish Beeharry
ps:- Thanks to the anonymous Khajuraho 'tagger' who brought the list back to
normal! :-)
