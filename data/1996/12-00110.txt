correct a potential misunderstanding which my previous post may

switched to private e-mail.]

Rank correlation is supposed to be a non-parametric test, so the
underlying distribution should not affect the distribution of the
statistic.

Kolmogrov-Smirnov test is supposedly for different samples drawn from
*continuous* populations. I am not sure why it would be a better test
for comparing two rank orders. I am not even sure how I would apply
since the `observations' are just the ranks from 1 to 9 in both
orders.

The point of the experiment is to test the claim that differences
in meter indicate differences in age or authorship. What you are saying
makes sense if I had already accepted the method as valid and then
try to use it to look for interpolations in Mahabharata etc.

The general idea is that when I start using something new, I try it
out in known situations first. If it works there, then I can think
about using it in situations where the answer is not known.

In other words, I was not testing for interpolations in Mahabharata or
Kumarasambhava  etc., but I was testing the idea that statistical
differences in metrical patterns of anushtub (that is half-stanzas of
16 syllables, ending in LHLX, L=light, H=heavy, X=any) can indicate
differences in age or authorship.
