milk, taste and eloquence

Yes, but with Herakles we are in mythology rather than in hagiography or
history. Furthermore, in this tale, milk is not granted as a reward from a
God to a mortal, as in Saint Bernard's case, but from a god to a semi-god.
In fact Hera had been tricked by Hermes, and when she discovered whom she
was nursing, she pulled Herakles of her breast (the Milky Way was formed
from the excess milk that spurted out>. 
	In any case, many thanks for the suggestion.
