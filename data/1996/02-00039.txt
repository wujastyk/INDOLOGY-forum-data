Thank you very much for your prompt answer.
In fact I have never been (for the moment) in a well-maintained
ms-collection of the south but I would further like to know if you or
anybody else on the network have witnessed the whole process of making a
south-indian ms, from incising to inking, and if you could describe it more
precisely or if you know any reference on that matter.
As for the "anonymousness" of your message it could be that you sent it
using the mail function of Netscape with which such things sometimes
happen.

Thank you for everything and best regards.
