'Fanciful' etymologies (was re. dating)

The recent postings on the subject of etymology have given the discussion 
an interesting anti historical-etymological slant.  I fail to see why 
etymologies are "pedestrian," as prof. Deshpande describes them.  I find 
it interesting, for example, that Skt. deshin (the index finger) is a 
cognate of latin index, where both mean the same thing: the finger that 
points.  They are, in turn, also related to English "teach," as teaching 
implies pointing out something.  They all are derived from the same 
Indo-European root deik (Skt. dish).  This is very helpful in 
understanding how meanings either remain the same or are transformed.
That there is often a difference (big or small) between the etymological 
meaning of a term and its use at a certain moment and place was 
recognized by Sanskrit grammarians, and is also common knowledge in 
linguistics.  To take an example from astronomy/astrology, which is where 
this 
discussion started anyway, how many people are aware that a disaster is a 
dis astrum, that is, what happens when one does not heed the stars?  So, 
yes, it is the usage of a term that defines its meaning at a certain 
point, and this meaning can stray far from its etymological origin 
(although the connection can usually be seen).
But if what we are after is extracting a "higher value" for a term, the 
situation is somewhat different. We are, then, in a way switching from a 
descriptive to a prescriptive mode. There is a difference between a 
meaning acquired in time through usage, and an imposed meaning meant to 
convey an idea or a belief.  This may serve as a didactic tool, and it 
may reinforce the particular belief, but it has nothing to do with the 
origin of the word.  If we are using these "etymologies" to understand 
these particular beliefs, that is, of course, useful.  But, as I 
mentioned in an earlier posting, they are often used purporting to be the 
original meaning, and they can be misleading when one is not 
studying/trying to understand/practicing that particular set of beliefs.
Take the word yoga.  Almost anybody who starts taking some classes 
nowadays will be told that yoga means union, because its aim is the union 
of the Atman (the individual soul) with Brahman (the Supreme soul), or, 
at least, the union of the two opposites represented by puruSa and prkRti.
This person will probably also read some of PataNjali's sUtras in this light.
But did yoga mean union for PataNjali? Quite the contrary we might say, 
for the aim of his yoga (in the sense of practice) was a state of 
kaivalya, isolation, in which puruSa, the soul, becomes aware of the fact 
that it is different from prakRti, nature. 
Although this is not really a folk etymology, as it does rely on one of 
the meanings of the verbal root, it still involves using one of the 
meanings of the term (with a Vedantic interpretation) and superimposing 
it on earlier texts where the 
meaning was different.  Without a historical analysis, this would not 
become clear.
Both diacronic and synchronic studies are valuable, it just depends on 
what we are studying, and from what perspective.
