Just a suggestion:

There seems to be some embarrassment surrounding information from
list-members about their own publications. Often they are introduced with
apologies for self-advertising. This is quite unnecessary, since abstracts
of what is being published are useful for all of us. Why not rather make it
a routine to send an abstract to INDOLOGY when an article / book /
dissertation has been published / passed? If only people state in the
subject-line that their message is an abstract this should not be a burden
to anyone. Perhaps these abstracts could even be filed separately on the
INDOLOGY Web-pages.
