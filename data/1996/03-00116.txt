If I am not entirely wrong, Australia lost "contact" - geologically
speaking - with the rest of the world about 25.000 years ago. We must
assume that Australian languages developed in isolation after that (barring
the odd Polynesian seafarer). Since languages change dramatically over such
long periods, all traces of linguistic connections with other language
families elsewhere should have been lost forever.
