Dear Indology members:
On behalf of Dr.Harunaga Isaacson who recieves but can not currently post 
to the list may I enquire if anyone recalls seeing a review of C.S 
George's edition of the Ca.n.damahaaro.sa.natantra, first eight chapters, 
American Oriental Series Vol.56. New Haven 1974.

Thank you for your assistance.
