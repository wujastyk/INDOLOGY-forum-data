language for communication
I, for one, welcome communications in Romance or Germanic languages. Indeed
I would regard an openness to that as a mark of serious scholarship.
I do not see the need to have a single language of communication. Apart
from anything else, the quantity of important work in Indology conducted in
French and German (taken together) is at least equal to that in English
(and probably greater). Of course English far exceeds all other European
languages in the production of rubbish !
If you restrict postings to the English language, then you merely produce
the result that some French or German scholars will not post because it
will be too time-consuming to do so. (Many who are fluent in reading
English cannot write English at speed.) This would be a loss to us all.
