Subject: Syntax of `yabh'
Message-ID: <161227026699.23782.13606750316962217163.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


The recent discussion has reminded of a question I had, but never tried
to answer: Datupathas specify `yabh' to be parasmaipada. I vaguely
remember the line from asvamedha banter to be `na me kascana yabhate',
where it was not clear if `me = mama' or `= mahyam'. Does anybody know
the case that `yabh' takes?

Thanks
