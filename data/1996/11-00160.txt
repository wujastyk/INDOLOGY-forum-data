You might also want to look up a book called "Samudrika" (YG Krishnamurti 
and Kuari Chandrakanta Sharma--Asia Press).  It's a description of sex 
and body sign prediction practices, but it might yield some interesting 
ideas.  Katherine Young (McGill U.) also has a book/chapter/article on 
this matter that came out in 1992, though I do not have a cite for it.

Let me know what comes of this.
