"dirty" ? Re to J.Silk
        I agree completely but my problem was an other one:
        1) long years ago, Paul Guiraud's student in french linguistic,
I've committed a study on metaphora in the terminology of sexual
intercourse, left unpublished because without valuable results:
establishing the corpus was too hard; but experience shows I had more
answers in privacy ;-)
        2) my asking was funly a revival of this old study, I was not sure
to be strictly in the scope of INDOLOGY.
