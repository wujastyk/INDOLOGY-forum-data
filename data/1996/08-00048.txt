Commentaries?
I am curious as to what the earliest, and most influential, as well as 
one "subaltern" (for lack of a better word) commentaries are on the Yoga 
Sutra's.  As I am preparing a bibliography for a possible curriculum, 
please--where possible--include citation information.
Thank you in advance,
