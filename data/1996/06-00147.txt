I agree with Harry Falk. May I suggest the Tuebingen-Zuerich format? It
allows for easy conversion, and interference with other graphic conventions
of the kind Hary mentions should be minimal. In the TZ-format, the Sanskrit
alfabeth looks like this:

a -a i -i u -u .r -r .l -l e ai o au .m .h k kh g gh ;n c ch j jh ?n .t .th
.d .dh .n t th d dh n p ph b bh m y v r l . /s s h

(Hope I remembered it all!) The advantage with this transliteration method
is that you're never in trouble when you want to change the graphic
appearance of the text. Conversion is easy. My own experience with this
kind of transliteration has been quite excellent.

By the way, Harry, what are the Vienna codes?

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
