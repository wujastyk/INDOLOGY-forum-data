		I`m 26 year old graduating student from Lahti Institute of Design,
		Goldsmithing and Jewellery Design Department. For graduating
		I`m doing a research of male earpieces and existence in different
		cultures. I`d need as much information as possible about, how
		those were related into ones social statue, and were there any 
		particular group of men who did wear those? I`m searching any-
		kind of information, it don`t have to be related to your culture, 
		cause research area is from 5000 B.C >>>>>> 1996 A.D.  Pictoral 
		evidence would be very precious to me. Already thankful for
		your help!!!!!!!!!!!
		P.S. also names of books and writers helps and www paths too !




							Yours humble student
