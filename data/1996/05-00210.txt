No - Chandragupta Maurya -> Bindusara -> Ashoka -> forgettable guy
who was replaced in a palace coup by his minister/senapati.
Several hundred years later, Chandragupta (of the Gupta dynasty)
-> Samudragupta -> [Ramagupta - murdered by] Chandragupta II 
(Vikramaditya - killed in battle by the Satavahana Emperor) -> 
.... -> Skandagupta who was the last ruler to
stand against the Huns. 
We don't know much beyond their names - but at least that much we
