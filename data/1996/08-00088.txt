Not to go into this too far, there are perhaps thousands of dialects in
India, and probably more than a hundred languages. Your definition of
"language" is not one used by any linguists or scholars of language.
Very many of the world's languages have never had a script, and have
not had written literature (though they are often quite rich in oral
literature). In any case, Marwari itself has both a script *and* a
rich literary tradition. However, most analyses would agree with you:
Marwari is a "dialect" of Rajasthani, rather than a distinct language.
In the context of a discussion of official languages, of course, I was
just joking (like the person who mentioned Tulu - another language
[not a dialect] that lacks such exalted status).
