IJHS Manuscript Review Panel
Dear Prof. Gaeffke,
        Thank you for the request for publication information.
SAT, the Society of Abidance in Truth, is an organization 
dedicated to the Teaching of Advaita Vedanta as revealed by
Sri Ramana Maharshi. As such we also translate and publish  rare 
and often first time ever publications of nonduality in English.
        The latest two are:
        "The Nirguna Manasa Puja" - A classic text on the worship of
the Attributeless within the mind by Adi Sankara.
        "The Ribhu Gita" translated into English from the Sanskrit
version. (Tamil to follow)
        Both of these texts were translated by Dr. H. Ramamoorthy 
assisted by Master Nome, Teacher of Advaita Vedanta and Self-Realized disciple
of the Maharshi. "The Ribhu Gita" has never before been available in its 
entirety in English.
        If you would like further information about SAT and its publications
please contact Leslie at ramana at cruzio.com. Entire nondual catalog is 
available by e-mail.
        Sincerely,
        Leslie Read (for Stan Rice who is ill)
