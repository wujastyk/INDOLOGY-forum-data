I myself don't have anything personal against the French language, and in
fact I welcome it to this list.  But it seems strange to me to suggest that
those young francophones who use English on the Internet are somehow
"illetrees."  Au contraire....
I also have to disagree with Dominique Thillaud. While writing systems are
obviously "*ajoutees* aux langues par des hommes" [this is repeated over
and over again since Saussure], the study of them can reveal a great deal
to us [I think the francophone Derrida has also thought so].
Bonjour,
