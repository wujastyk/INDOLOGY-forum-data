Ah, yes. This is the Kannada reference I couldn't find when replying
myself to the earlier inquiry on Satyabhama.  It gives a number of
sources, including a classical Bengali rendition on which the various
Kannada and Telugu works probably rely (via Oriya sources).
Of course one has to read Kannada....
Thanks, Ganesan.
