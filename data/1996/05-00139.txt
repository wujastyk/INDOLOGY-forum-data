	An important sourcebook for Indian contribution to mathematics, 
including the contribution of Kerala mathematicians is the 1990 book "The 
Crest of the Peacock, Non-European Roots of Mathematics" by George 
Gheverghese Joseph, Penguin Books.  The book deals with a number of 
non-western traditions including the Incas, Maya, Egypt, Babylonia, 
China, India, and the Arab world.  As an introductory book it is 
especially readable even to those who have relatively little background in 
the high-end branches of modern mathematics.
