Stereotyped images of India in school texts
Dear Indology Members,
Some weeks ago a bibliography on the subject of stereotyped images of India
in school texts was posted.  I saved the copy so carefully that I cannot find
it!  If anyone can forward that to me I would greatly appreciate it.  Many
thanks,
