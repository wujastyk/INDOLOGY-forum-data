Subject: Re: Date of the Veda

With regard to the astronomical methods of dating the Rid Veda, the deities of
the 27 nakshatras are listed in Taittiriya Samhita 4.4.10; Taittiriya Brahmana
1.5.1; and Kathaka Samhita 39.13.   Lists for the 28 nakshatras  (i.e. including
Abhijit) are found in TB 3.1.1-2;  Maitrayani Sam. 2.13.20.

So a lot depends on the relative dating of TS and VJ.
