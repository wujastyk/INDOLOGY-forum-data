With respect to Madhav's question about the first lines of:

 >>   dhik taan dhik taan dhig etaan kathayati... <<
                     
I don't quite recall from where this comes, and I do not remember
the next two lines, but I *do* remember that it begins with direct speech, 
the metrically incorrect line:


      bato bataasi jarjara / naiva te mano hrdayam caavidaama // 


Hope this helps!
