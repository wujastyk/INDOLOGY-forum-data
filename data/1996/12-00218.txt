There was no fault with INDOLOGY's listserv; what was distributed is what

Given the point you were making, it seems ironic that the header of your
email contained the following line:
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
This is the reason why 7bit encodings are -- regrettably -- still
important.
