You might want to explore other Indian languages before assuming that
chandu must be a borrowing from Chinese (a quick but inexpert dictionary
search suggests it isn't). Although this doesn't in itself get you nearer
to determining the etymologtical root, in Bengali chantu (caNtu) is an
intoxicating preparation made from opium; opium itself is called aphim
(aaphim).
