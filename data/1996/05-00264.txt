Do the people on INDOLOGY know about the beautiful books "Hindu America" by
Chaman Lal (in English) and "America as Ruled by Karnatakans" by
Venugopalacharya (in Kannada)? How's that for wishful thinking?...

With regard to F. Moksamula Bhatta: is it true that he never visited India? It
must have been difficult, then, to steal all that Vedic wisdom.
