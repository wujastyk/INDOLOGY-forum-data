how to reference list discussions
Good Question!  There have been times I have wondered this too. But there 
are several sides to this... Is it like "personal communication" or like 
a published quote if it is on the LIST itself (rather than just email 
correspondence between member)?  
Other questions: should we ask the person for his/her permission to quote 
off the LIST?  If not, how will it affect the LIST's correspondence to 
think that one might be quoted in an article?
If the LIST-quoted portion of an author's a reply to a specific request 
for information, and there is a lot of this in a given article, would the 
article then be like joint authorship?
I'm sure there are lots of such questions.  I like the idea of using the 
list to get information and thought, but I think it does create the 
possibility of some new forms of scholarship/writting/authorship that 
need to be discussed.
