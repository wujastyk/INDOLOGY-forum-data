the oldest buddhist text found
The piece Michael Rabe just posted from the Chicago newspaper implies that
the fragments -- though the article does not say it, they are in Gandhari, a
fact which was apparently reported in the version of the announcemnt found in
the Japan TImes -- have already been tentatively identified.  I wonder
whether this is true.  Are you out there Rich?  Do you want to fill us in a
little bit, now that the proverbial cat seems to be out of the bag?
