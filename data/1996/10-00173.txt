Jack Hawley and I have a student who is doing her senior thesis on
Hinduism on the world wide web.  She is particularly interested in web
sites that use images and which may be used for darshan or worship.  If
you have any suggestions for her -- her name is Michelle Caswell, you can
e-mail her directly at mlc23 at columbia.edu or send your suggestions to me
and I will forward them to her.  Thanks for your help.  mary mcgee
