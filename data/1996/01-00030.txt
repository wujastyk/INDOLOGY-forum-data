Bengal Studies Conference--Call for Papers

The 31st Bengal Studies Conference will be hosted by Georgetown

Bengal, both Bangladesh and West Bengal, India.  It should be noted 
that
the conference is for scholarship, not for the promotion of any 
religious
or political agenda.  Please submit a one-page abstract of your paper

Enayetur Rahim
Department of History
Georgetown University
Washington, DC  20057

If you would like to organize a panel, submit names of participants and 
a
one-paragraph abstract of the papers to be presented and notify paper
presenters to submit a one-page abstract of their papers.  Audio-visual

the
conference will be published by University Press (Dhaka).
