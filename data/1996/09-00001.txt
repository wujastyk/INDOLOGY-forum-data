And let us not lose sight of the fact that neither devanagari nor any of the
other scripts (including brahmi, for that matter) have any "intrinsic"
relationship to Sanskrit.  For centuries Sanskrit texts were transmitted
orally before any form of writing was used to write them down.  So early
(Vedic) Sanskrit has as much to do with devanagari as it has to do with the
roman or any other script. It is just a matter of using diacritics.
