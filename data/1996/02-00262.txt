Subject: Was Sanskrit ever spoken by "all"?
Message-ID: <161227022988.23782.14140424619602829938.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

	An interesting further dimension of "spoken" Sanskrit may be 
extracted from all those ritual performative texts in which women, and 
members of classes other than Brahmans, are expected to say something, 
not just recite, in Sanskrit.  A number of such "women's Sanskrit 
utterances" may be found Stephany Jamison's fascinating book 
"Sacrificer's Wife / Sacrificed Wife".
