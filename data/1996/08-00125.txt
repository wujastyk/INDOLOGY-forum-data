The best place to look for this kind of query is Raghavan et al.'s _New
Catalogus Catalogorum_ (Madras: U. of Madras, 1968- ).  Abbrev: NCC.

NCC lists about three S. Indian manuscripts of some notes by Anubhuuti. on
the Gaudapadiyabhasya.

NCC lists a dozen works by A., including the [Brahmasuutrabhaa.sya]
praka.taarthavivara.na, which survives apparently in a single manuscript
in Madras.
