Indological quesions on Dravidian/Tamil history
Dr Ganesan,
Thank you for the extensive bibliography you posted.
A few questions (for anyone who could answer them):
<more deleted>
Any current work on this anyone could recommend?
Also,
Any opinions on these two new books? I heard high praise from at least one
source. But he didn't seem exactly unbiased. I haven't seen them yet, am
wondering what people who have read them, thought of them?
