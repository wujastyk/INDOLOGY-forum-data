has anyone ever found/possessed/copied a 1956 kyoto university 
dissertation by T. Sahota entitled "The Development of the Concept of 
Purusha".  Dandekar lists it, but U. Microfilms doesn't have it, and the 
only copy to which kyoto could direct me was at the National Diet whose 
recent missive to me indicates it was handwritten and in too poor a shape 
to copy.  as this dissertation is, to my knowledge, the only detailed 
study on the earliest uses of a rather crucial philosophical term, it 
would benefit many aspects of indology if someone has even a piece of 
it--in english or otherwise.

thank you
