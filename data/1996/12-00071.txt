Regarding N. Ganesan's inquiry about Paul Younger's e-mail address:

At the recent AAR/SBL meeting in New Orleans, I did hear him mention that 
he is now on e-mail. I don't know his address; my only suggestion is to 
contact Grace Wang, Dept. of Religious Studies, McMaster University, 
Hamilton, Canada L8S 4K1: she usually knows everything. Tel. no. is (905) 
525-9140 ext. 23109. If Grace doesn't know, you can leave your e-mail 
address with her and she'll pass it on to Paul.

Sorry, that's the best I can do

Regards,

Joel Tatelman.
