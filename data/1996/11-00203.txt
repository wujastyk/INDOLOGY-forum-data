Origin of retroflexes: answers to Hock's objections?

I would assume that the primary approach towards answering this would be
to study the historic development of Dravidian. Just as we reconstruct
proto-IIr, proto-Germanic etc, we can try to reconstruct proto-North
Dravidian, proto-South dravidian etc. It is the lack of references 
to such efforts in treatments of the ``substrtum hypothesis'' that
bothers me.
If I want to study the influence of Dravidian on IA, shouldn't I start
by studying the historical developement of Dravidian and of IA, with
attempts at correlating their chronology?
Hey, you stole my line :-)
I had the perfect line to add after my third question (which I promise to
post after Thanskgiving): ``It would be more credible to argue that
the spread of retroflexes in IA is due to Aryans mispronouncing 
Dravidian words than the other way around.''
Now I have to think up something else.
