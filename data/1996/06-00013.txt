The book referred to is indeed very useful, and includes among other
things many samples of fonts from particular foundries of the past.
Here is a more complete reference for the first volume of this work,
which is the only one I have seen:

Baapuuraav Naaiik, _Devanaagarii mudraak.saralekhanakalaa_, kha.m.da
pahilaa, Mu.mbaii [Bombay]: Mahaaraa.s.tra Raajya Saahitya Sa.msk.rtii
Ma.m.da_la, 1982.

The book is in Marathi.
