Subject: Dakshina meaning and derivation

* I am interested in the word - dakshina -. I have seen it as a direction ,
* south or southern. I have also seen it as donation. What is the connection?

I would like to add a short cultural note to this discussion.
In south India at least, it is a tremendous sign of disrespect
if one gives or receives anything with the left hand.  That 
being the case, dakshiNa meaning both ``gift'' and ``right''
are inseparably tied together.
