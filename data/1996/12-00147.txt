Representing diacritics in 7-bit ASCII

Ever tried to get a font for Latinized Sanskrit, or Avestan, or Old
English? They do exist, but it is hard, and then there are no universally
agreed upon standards.
My scheme was meant as a solution to the following problem: You sit there
exchanging email of a scholarly linguistic content with other people. The
only characters/glyphs you all share between you, and which can be
error-proofly transmitted are these:
!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijkl
mnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
What, then, to do, if you are de-facto confined to this range of
characters, because of incompatibility between systems, or by a system that
in fact contains no other chars, if you want to convey/cite Latin script
text using various traditional diacritics? The way you write your own name
in your header shows that this is a real problem! I for one am tired of
MIME-garbled diacriticized letters.
My scheme was designed to give a representation of these traditional
diacritics readily recognizable to the bare human eye under the
circumstances described. It appears that I should have been more explicit
at this point.
Clearly all this animosity and misunderstanding results from our adressing
the problems at different technical levels. I am quite savvy wrt
writing-systems, glyph-forms and the history of writing and
transliteration, but when it comes to (the inner life of) computers I'm as
ignorant as anyones grandmother. I still think I may have something
worthwhile to contribute.
Maybe some of you technically savvy people could help me to get my
(foreign) English language right, so that we all understand what we are
talking about, before flaming me?
It is curious that one should be harshly ridiculed for trying to offer
simple, ad-hoc solutions to everyday problems.
Best regards, hoping that this is all a misunderstanding of either of us.

It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
