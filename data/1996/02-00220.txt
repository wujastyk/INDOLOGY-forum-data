Manuscript sales
Personally I am not interested in buying manuscripts.  But I am concerned
that if museums, libraries or scholars do not buy them as *entire*
manuscripts, they may be resold to "art dealers" which then sell them a
page or two at a time, often framed, as "art" or "calligraphy".  The
dealers themselves may not be in a position to assess the importance of the
manuscripts as written documents. Manuscripts sold in such a way are
scattered to the four winds, and can never again be re-assembled for
scholarly examination.
The indology net certainly seems to be an appropriate forum for discussion
of this issue.
