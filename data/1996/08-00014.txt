After the dust settles . . .
After the many postings, updatings, and format revisions, where best did 
Charles Wikner's Sanskrit Course wind up?  THere were several FTP's 
suggested, as well as URL's-- I was hoping to find the 8 1/2 x 11" paper 
size format.
Thank you very much in advance,
John Robert Gardner
