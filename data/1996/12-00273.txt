I have two questions:

        1.  What are the 3 vows of bride and 7 vows of bridegroom in
traditional northern Indian marriage.  Where is it written e.g. Manu Smriti xx?

        2.  Is there a Hindi translation, of Man's Search for Meaning by
Victor Frenkl, exists?


                Thanks in advance.
