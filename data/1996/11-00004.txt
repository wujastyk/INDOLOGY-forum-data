Madhav Deshpande's abstract of the Michigan-Lausanne conference
A few hours ago, Madhav posted the abstracts of the Aryans and Non-Aryans
in South Asia" conference to INDOLOGY.  I've just added them to the
INDOLOGY web site,
  http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
under "Members' queries and information".
Best wishes,
Dominik
