Until you publish this piece, can we take it that Ramagupta was not a
figment of the imagination, but a historical figure (i.e., no one else has
established/argued that he was a legend)? 

I was not aware that we knew any details about the kings and queens
before c.1000 (and c. 1500 for tamil nadu), beyond their names, 
victories, defeats, and literary accounts of their prowess.
