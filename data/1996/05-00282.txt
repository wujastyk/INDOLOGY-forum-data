It would do, if we had no prior mention of astronomy.
I referred above to 'later Indian astronomical ideas' i.e. the many
elements that are precisely not attested in early literature.
Depending what you mean by the 'vedas' only some of the above are genuinely
present in the early texts.
We can, I think, be pretty sure of the Greek source of many developments.
That would be going too far. Nonetheless the Greek achievement within a

I couldn't agree with you about this. Both the historical and the textual
are important for scholarship. Dating is very important for understanding
many things in this area.
Unfortunately, there is a tendency sometimes to adopt a policy of 'shoot
the messenger' because the results of scholarship are unpalatable.
