Background
The Chair in Tamil Studies endowment was raised as a joint
effort of the Center for South Asia Studies at U.C. Berkeley and
the San Francisco Bay Area Fundraising Committee for the Chair
in Tamil Studies
The San Francisco Bay Area Fundraising Committee constituted
itself four years ago to raise funds to support Tamil studies at
Berkeley.  Growing from a small group of concerned Bay Area
Tamil Americans, the Committee ultimately reached out to
incorporate Tamil Americans and Tamil Canadians as well as many
other friends of Tamil throughout North America.  Contributions
were received from over 450 families with many of them making
multiple donations.
