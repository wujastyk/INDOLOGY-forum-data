Apte's The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 1958 edition, Prasad 
Prakashan, Poona, Vol. II, p. 786, lists taipapaayin and cites a passage 
from the Mahaabhaarata.  Apte interprets this word as referring to "a 
kind of cockroach".  He also lists taila_ambukaa, tailapaka, tailapakaa, 
tailapaa, tailapaayikaa, and tailacaurikaa in the same sense.
