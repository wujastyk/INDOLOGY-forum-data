I think the problem here is probably to do with font hinting.  I can't
speak for Jamie's fonts, which I haven't seen, but when Peter and I were
looking at the Bitstream Charter, we used a font editing tool that
allowed one to copy characters to new positions, and then fiddle with
them.  However the copied characters lost the hinting that was there for
the originals.  It is possible to put the hinting in, but it's pretty
tedious.  Since the printed results at 300dpi and above is fine, I
personally haven't had the oomph to do anything about the hinting.

But as soon as I have some time ... (aaah ha ha ha ... crazed, maniac
laughter ...).
