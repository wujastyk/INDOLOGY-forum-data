This is indeed a standard work to be read by any person who is interested
in ancient astronomy and mathematics but it does not deal much with
astrology.  As a nice introduction to ancient and medieval astrology, I
would recommend Pingree's article in _Dictionary of the History of Ideas --
Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas, ed. by Philip P. Wiener, et al. (Charles
Scribners Sons 1968, 1973).  Its Japanese translation, if you prefer, will
be found in _Chi no matorikusu_, Hisutorii obu aidhiazu 9, Tokyo: Heibonsha
1987.
