Vikram Seth - some more problems
In affirmation of Peter Banos who replied as follows to:
This sounds like the name of the horse of one of the heroes of the
Shahnameh - Rustam I think?
There's a spectacular painting of this horse, "Rakhsh" fighting off a lion
to protect his sleeping master Rustam, from an early 16th c.Tabrizi mss. of
the Shahnama in the British Museum: now on the jacket-cover of Sheila Blair
and Jonathon Bloom's opus, _The Art and Architecture of Islam 1250-1800_
(Yale, 1994).
And as an alternative to Carolyn's very plausible suggestion:
...
What about "rath" as chariot--with all it's festive, rathosvava
connotations; plus the innuendo of elephants in rut... [this without having
read Seth].
