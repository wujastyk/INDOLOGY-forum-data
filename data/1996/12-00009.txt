The word "upanishad"
I'd had the same question Neb or no--and Steve Lindquist of UChicago 
directed me to an etymology discussed in an article in French by Renou, 
as u + pari + sad . . . I was hoping to get the citation from him before 
he left for Benares . . . NB--does anyone know how to reach him?
Thanks to previous postings for citations of which I'd not been aware on 
this matter.  If Anyone has the Renou citation, TYIA
