_Her_ address is fp7 at columbia.edu.

(Rule of thumb, for non-Anglophones: In English, men bearing the given
name of the Saint of Assisi use the spelling "Francis," and women
"Frances.")
(Also, women are more likely to call themeselves and be called 
"Fran," but this rule is _much_ less reliable...)

brightness of thy rising."
