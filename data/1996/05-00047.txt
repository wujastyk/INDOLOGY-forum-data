Wikner PK files
I am working on porting Wikner's devanagari system to the Mac. I believe I
have ported the preprocessor, but am unable to get the pk files generated
and thereofre cannot test it...
Would anyone have a zip archive of all the pk files in a reasonable range
of mags that they would be willing to email?
I'll go back and hunt through my config files _again in the meantime...
Thanks.
