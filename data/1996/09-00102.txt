language for communication
Lars Martin Fosse responds to:
with:
If a Norwegian can learn to communicate in English, then we can all learn
to communicate in Chinese. There is a large body of people in China we
could write for.
It is not a question of what we can do. It is a question of which
investments of our time we choose to make and how we are taught languages
in school. Undoubtedly any capable scholar could learn to be fluent in any
given language. But does he want to spend his time doing that.
Surely this represents a failure to learn to communicate in French and German.
I do not know about American scholars, but British scholars certainly read
Dumezil in French as he was published. The reason they did not refer to him
much was because they did not rate his ideas very highly !
That's absurd. By that argument the use of any language would involve a
decision to exclude the majority of the world that don't read that language
- even English isn't that widely read !
As far as I am concerned, contributions in Norwegian would be perfectly
welcome. (But I would reply in English!)
