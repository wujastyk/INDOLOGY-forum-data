Subject: Skt dictionaries on-line
Message-ID: <161227022541.23782.975129114238241876.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have just been away for a year, and off-line. But I have a fuzzy 
recollection that somebody was putting, or had put, Monier-Williams' 
Skt-Eng dict. on-line or on CD Rom. Is this kalpanaa, or did somebody 
really do it? If not, does someone out there know of any Skt-Eng 
dictionaries on line?
Thanks
