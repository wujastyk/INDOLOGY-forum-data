Wikner's Sanskrit Course
I have downloaded Wikner's Sanskrit Course. It is a 5 Mbyte file that appears 
to be the text of instructions that are meant to be processed by a PostScript 
interpreter. Is the any commercial software for PCs or Macintoshes available 
that will allow me to print it? If so what is its name?
TIA Ralph
