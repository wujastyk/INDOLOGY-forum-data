Initial capital

I agree completely. I find that the Itrans convention of enclosing
words in a different script between ## ## is good and very convenient. 
So if the major message is in English, we should write Krishna or
##kRSNa## to use Aktor's example.
If people are using a certain convention, be it Kyoto-Harvard, or Velthuis
or Itrans, they might also consider a footnote (in their signature) to
that effect and we might be able to come up with scripts to automatically 
reformat/print in any desired medium.
