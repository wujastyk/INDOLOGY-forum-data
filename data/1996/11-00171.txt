It's quite possible that you were 
served first because you are a foreigner, 
and that too, speaking an Indian
language.  (You might have been
served first even if you had said
"chaai dena" -- or emitted hoarse cries
suggestive of being parched -- instead 
of saying "chhayi ondhu kodtheera"). 


When one studies a foreign culture
with enthusiasm, there seems to be a
danger of embracing the local prejudices 
(which may be viewed with scepticism even
by many local people) and making them 
one's own... 

All the best,


Raja.
