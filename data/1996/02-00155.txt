Mangali women
Does anyone know where I can get more information about women who are
considered "mangali," that is, whose astrological charts are heavily
Mars-influenced?  I am particularly interested in special marriage
rituals such as the "kumbh vivaha" that are meant to rid these women
of excess Mars influence.  
   I would be most grateful for any guidance to relevant sources,
either primary or secondary.
Thank you in advance,
