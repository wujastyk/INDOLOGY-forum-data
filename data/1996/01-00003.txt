request: references for pancaanga/ephemeris calculations
I am thinking of rewriting Prof Yano's pancaanga program with some
modifications. I would appreciate if someone can give me the
references for pancaanga calculations, both from the various
siddhaantas, and also from modern ephemerides.
Thanks in advance and best wishes to all for a Happy new year.
