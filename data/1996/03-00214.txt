  A possible, if awkward solution to this problem would be to create an 
image file (GIF, JPG, FAX) of the text in whatever script.  Every mailer I
know of can send and receive "attached files", in which these could be sent.
The disadvantage, of course, is that the file would not be treated as editable
or quotable text, but as an image and it would have to be read with some
sort of image viewing program.
