AlAta, ulkA, ulmuka
Dear colleagues,
A private scholar without access to a really good academic library or
email has asked me to post a query.  Have there been any articles or other
writings on the etymology of these Sanskrit words, alAta 'firebrand,'
ulkA 'meteor,' and ulmuka, 'firebrand' since Mayrhofer discussed them in
Kurtzgefasstes etymologisches woerterbuch des altindischen in 1951?
Mayrhofer can only cite a couple of very tentative articles for each.
Could there be a non-IE source?
Thanks for your help.
