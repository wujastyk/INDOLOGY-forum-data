                            Sanskrit Documents
                                                             1/26/96

namaskaar,

We are very glad to present an anonymous ftp or WWW site having
major collection of Sanskrit related documents.

The site is accessible through WWW with URL
ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html

The files can also be transferred with anonymous ftp as
ftp jaguar.cs.utah.edu
with cd private/sanskrit directly.

A subset of these files is also available at
http://chandra.cs.brown.edu/
which is the major site for ITRANS/hindi/marathi songs.
It has been managed very efficiently by Anurag Shankar.

The files on both the sites are available in English transliteration
and Devanagari output format. These documents were prepared by
many individuals, most of them being participants in the on-line
Sanskrit group mailing list/sanskrit-digest (information to
get the digest is added in the end of this message).  
We appreciate their interest and hope that they will have 
opportunity to be equally enthusiastic in the future.

The Devanagari files are generated using ITRANS/TeX/LaTeX/dvips
collection of software available as freeware.


We particularly encourage you to print/read the Sanskrit projects file.
We need volunteers for many of the 50+ projects mentioned. 
Please take initiatives and participate in this group effort.
Other major activities planned for learning/speaking Sanskrit,
both in India and abroad, are linked in Sanskrit Bharati site:
http://reality.sgi.com/employees/atul/sanskrit/sanskrit.html
We realize that anything we do will be a tiny amount compared
to the grand scale of Sanskrit literature.

We need guidance from you in this effort!
