Q: Sanskrit Alphabetical Order
         Q: Sanskrit Alphabetical Order
        ********************************
Why are the Sanskrit vowels and consonants arranged into separate
groups? This question is important becausee in other Indo-European 
languages this order is not found. Is this order derived after 
ancient Indo-Europeans came in contact with the then residents 
of India, (Dravidians?).
Any pointers or references?
