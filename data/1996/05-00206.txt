Invitation for the Xth World Sanskrit Conference - 1997 , B
    apllied in Sanskrit Poetics and  Philosophy			
         tentative title would be "Vatsya Varadaguru on understanding 
         mahavakyas. A controversy between Advaita nad Visistadvaita 
         Vedanta." But I may decide to present a paper on Skt Poetics
