What about the scathing article in the NEW YORKER entitled: Blissed Out, 
etc. It is about the intriques in the Cats-killing Up-state New York 
ashram and the feud between the brother-sister claimants to the 
succession issue (talk about gurus leaving behind ambiguous traces!) and 
how the battle was won. A mini epic for someone to write a small granth on.
!). I think the article had appeared in the September 1992 issue; I will 
post the exact reference in my next darshan round. Chelas please await 
the a/divine revelation.

Cheers.
