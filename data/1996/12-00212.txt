It is quite similar in both 'complexity and elegance' to Classical Greek.
That certainly evolved 'naturally' from Indo-European.

Actually, I suspect English too is just as complex - it is simply a
different kind of complexity. So, for example, complex rules of order and
different ways of using prepositions replace inflexions . . . etc.
