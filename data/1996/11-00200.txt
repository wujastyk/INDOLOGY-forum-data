This depends on whether the two persons concerned are both of South Indian
ORigin, One from South India and the other from North India; or both from

I know for a fact that Indologist visitors to Kerala (my native State) from
Karnataka who does not speak English tends to communicate in Sanskrit rather
than in Hindi. This is confined to Indologists only, since most, if not all,
Indian Indologist knows Sanskrit as much as they know their on mother tounge.
