Sukumari Bhattacharji. _Literature in the Vedic Age_, 2 vols., Calcutta: K
P Bagchi & Co., 1984, 1986.

Lewis Rowell. _Music and Musical Thought in Early India_, Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1992

role of music and a "sound model" undergirding Vedic thinking, is

your student is not intimidated by mathematics and knows something about
music theory, another intriguing speculative work is
