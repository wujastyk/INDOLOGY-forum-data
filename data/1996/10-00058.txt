The 108 upanishads are arranged according to veda affiliation and subject
matter in a table. 
I would like to take this opportunity to let list-members know of the
advaita vedAnta website at <http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~vidya/advaita>.
Dominik Wujastyk has already added the URL to the INDOLOGY site under his
list of general interest items. The advaita website has both frames and
non-frames versions.
