waiting for your answer
Dear Dr. John Smith,
   I have been waiting for your answer since I sent my mail to you a few days ago.
I do not mind anybody's criticism on my epic files. But if it does not hit the point, I have the right to ask him to correct the judgement on them. In addition, if you had just let me know of your project using my files in advance (since it is not a simple revision for a personal usage), I would have been much happier with your files. We have to have this kind of mishap solved on this occasion in order to guarantee a free exchange of Sanskrit files among Indologits.
