numerical value of devanagari
Request: I am looking for detailed information on the numerical value 
of devanagari consonants. Bhaaskararaaya mentions a few examples such as pa 
meaning the number one and ra meaning the number two (pakaara 
ekasa.mkhyaayaa vaacako rephastu dvitvasa.mkhyaayaa.h). He also gives a 
short quote of Varuci on the topic (quote starts with 
ka.tapayavargabhvairiha ...) and says that the counting should be from 
right to left.
I would greatly appreciate any help about more details 
concerning the numerical value of all devanagari consonants (and vowels) - 
from Tantric sources and from Varuci's treatment of the topic.
Thank you very much,
