Q: Proto-Siva
        I have'nt the references at hand but I remember different versions
of the same story (Yayati and/or Zizupala) where the involved God is, in
the first version Varuna, in the second Shiva under the form of Varuna and
in the third Shiva; clearly the mechanism of a replacement.
        I can search more precisely if you are interested.
