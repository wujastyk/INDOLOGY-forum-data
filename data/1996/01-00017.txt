A lady has called up the Library of Congress asking if Sanskrit lessons were 
offered in the Washington, DC area.  She has already checked all the 
local colleges and universities.  I referred her to the Simhalese 
Buddhist monastery, which offered lessons some time ago, to the 
commercial foreign language schools, and to the Foreign Service 
Institute, whose teachers might have some ideas.  Is anyone aware of 
anyone giving Sanskrit lessons around Washington, or qualified and 
interested in offering them on an individual basis? 

Sincerely,


Allen W. Thrasher
