Hi,
It may also be added tha pIlikai also refers to an ant; pIlu in Skt and Kannada
is an atom; a worm. If we look at the photographs of the 
vancouver island marmots, they look like small
bears. In Tamil pIrukam, pIlukam refers to a bear.
Yes, it ispossible that the place names may have derived from
pippala, the berry of ficus religiosa, cf. R.L.Turner. 
What is a thread, what is brelated and what is not?
regards. Kalyanaraman.
