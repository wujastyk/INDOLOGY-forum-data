Question
Dear Madhav,
I  don't remember to have seen any reference to the
Nandikezvara-kAzikA/kArikA  in any Kashmir Shaiva texts (even in those one
most might have expected to find it, like the ParAtriMzikAvivaraNa or
TantrAloka ch.III). In fact, the only reference to it I am aware of is that
by NAgeza. My impression is that this is not an old text (a forerunner of
the Kashmiri Shaiva doctrines, as Pandey thinks)  but a late one which
rather presupposes the doctrines of the so-called 'Kashmir Shaivism' at a
post-exegetical stage (e.g. the first verse of the SpandakArikA is
distinctly echoed by a verse of the NK.).  Anyhow, I might say something
more definite only after re-reading this text (which I don't have at hand
now).
