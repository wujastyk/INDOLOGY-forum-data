George, I have never seen any convention for this. But I think that if none
already exists, we should try to establish one as soon as possible, because
a number of us may need it. May I suggest the following format:

<quoted person>,[subject],<email X list>,<date>

In other words, if you were to quote this email, it would be referenced
like this:

Lars Martin Fosse, email Indology list, 31.7.96.

Since subject is not always stated clearly, I suggest that we make it optional.

Personal emails should be treated as Personal Communications and would not
need exact dates. I do, however, think that it is useful to make a
difference between public discussions and private PCs.

Best regards,

Lars Martin
