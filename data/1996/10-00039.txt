The point here is not bare vs. covered,
but rather, formal/respectful clothing
vs. too informal.  Also, it depends who
you are.

Dhoti/angavastram is formal.  Unbuttoned
shirt is informal/disrespectful.  

Even stark naked is acceptable for a Jain 
monk or Nanga sadhu, though I shudder to think
of all those hairs being shed on the ancient 
palm-leaf scrolls in the Univ Sanskrit department.
