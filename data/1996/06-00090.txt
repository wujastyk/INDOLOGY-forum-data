Abstracts on INDOLOGY
Dr Fosse speaks of a lovely, ideal world.  My suggestion does not, I think,
contradict his, but is perhaps a bit more hopeful of realization.  Everything
since 1850?  Even if we split up all the work between every member of this
list, when would we finish?  (I seem to remember some Latin about ... vita
brevis).  Why not start small and with some hope of actually accomplishing
something?
