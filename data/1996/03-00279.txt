I realize this thread already ended, but just in case anyone wants to 
know more. o.dhramAgadhI is mentioned in nA.tya "sAstra 6.25 as one of 
the 5 [sic] prav.rtti-s, regional styles of dress, speech and behaviour. 
The others are AvantI, dAk.si.nAtyA, pA~ncAlI and madhyamA. In N"S 13.37 
this list occurs again, but without madhyamA. The exact area encompassed 
by o.dhramAgadhI is defined at N"S 13.44-47.

Best,
