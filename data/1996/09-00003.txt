compound analysis in e-texts

Bill Poser argues that writing systems represent a phonological analysis

were trying to put your finger on. Devanagari does in fact reflect a
particular phonological analysis of Sanskrit; e.g. consonant clusters are
clearly distinguished from single consonants by the use of half-letter
symbols.  Most importantly, while the roman alphabet mixes vowels among
consonants and does not organize the various Cs and Vs in its ordering of
letters in the alphabet (abcdefghij...), Devanagari has vowels clearly
distinguished from consonants and, further, organises the various sounds
according to place and manner of articulation. Stops are listed separately
from non-stops, the stops are also distinguished from each other in place
and manner of articulation by the use of rows and columns (velar stops are
written in the first row, etc.). I've noticed that the writing system does
affect the psychological view (intuitions?) that speakers have of their
language; e.g. some Hindi speakers think that the half-letters used for
consonant clusters really are half sounds!
