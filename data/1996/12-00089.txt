I believe that in many systems of lifestock herding, the herdsmen do not
own the flocks, or all of them, and at least part of what they herd is not
their own.  The painting can be for distinguishing ownership within a
flock (like brands or ear-cuttings) in addition to whatever other purposes
the beasts may be painted.
