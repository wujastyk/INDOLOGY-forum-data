I'm trying to identify the author of a letter in a little collection 
currently being catalogued.  The date is 1881, place of address Colombo and 
the signature looks like "W. Sulehuti"; a later owner of the letter has 
commented underneath "Buddhist monk, best Pali scholar in Ceylon".  It would 
be nice to be sure that I've read the signature correctly - does that name 
or a variant thereof ring any bells with you?

Thanks, 
Chris
