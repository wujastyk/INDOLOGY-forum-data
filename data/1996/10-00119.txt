Dear Indologists,

A friend has asked me to post the following queries:

1)  Can anyone supply a good translation of the Gayatri mantraa (first
verse).  The translations given in popular hymn books do not seem to
correspond to the Sanskrit.  According to what I've read, it was originally
an invocation to Savitar, the Sun.

2) I know one can write a book on the subject, but can anyone offer a concise
definition of "Om"

3) A translation of the Shanti Paath, with some background.

Much obliged to anyone who can help.  Regards,

Amita Sarin
