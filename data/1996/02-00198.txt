Kashmir Shaivism
In various books and articles I see all kinds of versions of this: Kashmir
Shaivism, Kashmiri Shaivism, Kashmirian Shaivism,  Shaivism of Kashmir, -
Shivaism, and in German: Kashmir Shaivismus, Kashmir Shivaismus,
Kas(c)hmirischer Shivaismus ....
Is there a standard term, both in English and German? Is any one term more
justified than others?
Thanks for your help.
