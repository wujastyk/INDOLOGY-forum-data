If I am right in thinking that  x represents the modified kh in words like
xudaa, xaakii, then it seems we need another letter for the modified g (say g_
for the sake of discussion) in words like kaag_az.   (Or is there perhaps a
tendency to omit this modification?)

Fine! - whatever is best to separate the letters.

It would be very valuable to have a consolidated scheme of typing for all Indian
languages.   As well as the problem of consonants, there is also the question of
how to type the short vowels e, o of Dravidian languages where the long vowels
are the ones in Sanskrit (also Malayalam half short-u).   What about using  e",
o", (and u") for these short vowels (or will some computers have problems)?
