urdu wordprocessing system
Dear colleagues!
I am looking urgently for a good Urdu wordprocessing system. "Good" means it
should be able to handle footnotes and provide a beautiful laser-printout in
nastaliq-style (fonts scalable), suitable for publications (I know, I ask
for too much!?).
Thanks for solutions!
