maatarizva
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman wonders:
"How fascinating! Kittel's Kannada lexicon gives this lexical entry:
maatarizva = wind.
Is it a far cry from agni to wind?"
Not really.  Macdonell [Vedic Mythology, pp.71f.] explains it all rather
nicely.  He knows the Rgveda very well.  One might also consult the Rgveda.
[Didn't I mention that I was referring to the RV?...]
Sincerely,
George Thompson
