GENERAL INFORMATION
Dear Participants,
Welcome to the garden city of Bangalore!
The conference is hardly six months away from now.  We want to give you the following information to facilitate you to plan your visit to India more fruitfully.
1.  ABOUT BANGALORE
Bangalore is the capital of Karnataka, the Kannada speaking state of India (the eighth largest state in the country).  Once described as the "Paradise of the Retired People",  Bangalore is known for its salubrious climate.  Located 1000 m above the sea level, Bangalore has a moderate climate throughout the year. In the 'coldest' month of January,
it is 20.48 degree Celsius and the maximum temperature during the day rarely exceeds 34 degree Celsius.  This bustling capital city of Karnataka, has a perpetual holiday atmosphere. 
The city abounds in picturesque sight-seeing places.  The cubbon part with extensive stretch of green land and beautifully laid out lawns and enchanting botonical garden with Glass House in the midst of Lal Bagh lend all the charming grandeur to the city.  Bangalore is well connected by air and land with all major cities in India and directly connected by air with a few coutries.
Founded in 1537 by a local cheiftan Kempe Gowda, Bangalore is the firth largest city in the country and one of the fastest growing in the world.  Rapid industrial growth has not taken away from Bangalore the old charm of the city.  Bangalore offers more than a day or two of sightseeing.  Daily, there is something going on here - music and dance concerts, dramas, exhibitions etc.
As a citadel of learning, Bangalore has some outstanding technical, scientific and research institutions.  The Indian Institute of Science is one of the foremost scientific institutes in the country.  In addition, Bangalore University, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Raman Research Institute and numerous professional and general colleges, give necessary impetus for educational progress.
With many Computer Software development companies coming up in recent times,  young skilful software engineers here, have earned for this "village of boiled beans" (BENGALURU) a world reputation of "The Silicon Valley of India".
As a well planned modern city, it has many imposing structures conveniently located.
The majestic Vidhana Soudha, a magnificient post-independence structure houses the Secretariat of the Karanataka Government and the State's legislature.  It is a sheer delight to see the illuminated building during nights, especially on Sundays and holidays. It is here that the organizing committee is planning to hold the inaugural session of the Xth World Sanskrit Conference.
1. PROGRAMME SUMMARY
Regular academic sessions will be held at Taralabalu Kendra, another important building 
of a Centre that has come up in recent times in the Rabindranath Tagore Nagar area
(abbreviated as R T Nagar)  of  Bangalore to promote Indian cultural heritage and academic research.  In the words of a common man on the street, it is a miniature of Vidhan Soudha
in its architectural splendor. The magnificent 5-storey building of this Kendra with modern facilties like computers and e-mail communications, has an auditorium of 1000 seating capacity, a large community hall, conference hall, prayer hall,  dining hall, guest rooms, dormitories etc.  It is here and in the neighbouring educational institutions that all the academic sessions and cultural programmes will be held on all the days of the conference.

7.  IN-CONFERENCE TOURS
The following four optional tours (one full day) are planned for 6th January 1997.  Participants are requested to select any one of them and register their names with the official travel agent of the conference.
1.	MYSORE/SRIRANGAPATNAM: ($ 7 per person)
The city of Mysore, 140 kms from Bangalore, was once the capital of the kings Wodeyars.  It still retains a quaint charm that never fails to enchant.  The Mysore Palace, once the residence of the Wodeyar kings, is one of the largest of its kind in 
India and one of the most splendid.  This Indo-Saracenic building has among other things - a carved silver door, a solid gold throne and gallery of exquisite paintings.
Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery is a palace transformed into an art gallery with paintings dating from 1875.  The collection includes paintings by Raja Ravi Varma, the Russian Svetoslav Roerich and the traditional Mysore 'gold leaf' style of painting.
St. Philomena's Church, in the Gothic style, is one of the largest churches in the country and has beautiful stained glass windows.
Chamundi Hills are 13 kms off Mysore City.  Halfway-up is the Nandi Bull, a 4.8 m monolith.  This Nandi Bull is the emblem selected for the Xth World Sanskrit Conference.  
About 19 kms north-west of Mysore is the KRS Dam. The adjoing Brindavan Garden attracts thousands of visitors with its ornamental terraced gardens, the swirling fountains dancing to the rhythm of soft music and the colourful fairy lights.
Srirangapatna is 14 kms north-east of Mysore on the Bangalore-Mysore Highway.
The island fortres that was once the capital of the Warrior-kings Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore.  Tipu's summer palace, Daria Daulat, built in 1784, was his favourite retreat.  It is now a museum and tells eloquently of his valour and his losing battle against British.  It has ornate and beautiful frescoes.  
2	SHRAVANABELAGOLA, BELUR AND HALEBEEDU ($10 per person)
Shravanabelagola is 158 kms from Bangalore.  This is one of the most important Jaina pilgrim centres with the 17 m. high monolith of Lord Bahubali - said to be the world's tallest monolithic statue.  Thousands of devotees congregate here to perform the 'Mahamastakabhisheka', a spectacular ceremony held once in 12 years when the 1000-year-old statue is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, saffron and gold coins. The last 'Mahamastakabhisheka' was held in the year 1993.  
Belur and Halebeed with their exquisite temples are about 220 kms from Bangalore.  
The Chennakeshava Temple is one of the finest examples of Hoysala architecture. It took 103 years to complete.  The facade of the temple is filled with intricate sculptures and friezes - with no portion lef blank.  Elephants, episodes from the epics, sensuous dancers ... - awe-inspiring in their intricate workmanship.  Inside are hand-lathe-turned filigreed pillars.  
What astounds one about the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebeed is the wealth of sculptural details.  The walls of the temple are covered with an endless variety of gods and goddesses, animals, birds and dancing girls.  Yet no two facets of the temple are the same.  This magnificent temple - guarded by a Nandi Bull - was never completed, despite 86 years of labour.
..
3	TIRUPATHI:  ($ 16 per person)
Tirupathi, about 250 kms from Bangalore, is in the neighbouring Telugu speaking state of Andhra Pradesh. The famous Venkateswara Temple here, attracts thousands of Hindu devotees from all over the country.  A day's offerings made by 
its ardent devotees, as reported in the news papers recently, were Rs 30 lakhs (approximately 85 thousand US dollars)
4	CITY TOUR: ($ 2 per person)
The Vidhana Soudha, housing the State Legislature and Secretariat, was conceived and executed by Kengal Hanumanthaiya, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, in the year 1956.  It is built entirely of Bangalore granite in the Neo-Dravidian style.
Directly opposite to it, stands the Gothic structure of the Attara Kacheri which houses the State Hight Court.  Within the walking distance are the Public Library, the Government Museum, the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum and the Venkatappa Art Galery.  The High Court building was completed in 1868 and stands in the green splendour of the Cubbon Park laid out in 1864 by Lieutenant General Sir Mark Cubbon.  Bangalore's other sprawling park is in the South of the city, the Lalbagh Gardens, laid out in 1760 by Hyder Ali, has an area of 240 acres.  The Glass House, inspired by the Crystal Palace in London, is a favourite spot in Lalbagh.  
The Bangalore Palace, built in 1887 by a Wodyar king, is today a favourite spot for picnickers and film-makers, with its vast grounds and Tudor-style architecture.  
At Basavanagudi is one of Bangalore's oldest temples, the Bull Temple.  Nandi, the Sacred Bull, has been carved out of a single boulder and is 4.6 m tall.
