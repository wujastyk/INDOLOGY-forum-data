We are very glad to announce that our Journals have won several awards in
the "Best of 1995 Social Sciences, Humanities & Asian-Pacific Studies WWW
Resources" promoted by the Australian National University! 

Even though we entered the competition very late and, most important, we
started our publications only a few months ago, these results demonstrate
our readers' support and appreciation -- and this is the most important 
thing for us. 

I heartfully thank who works with me and who has voted for and supported
our Journals!
