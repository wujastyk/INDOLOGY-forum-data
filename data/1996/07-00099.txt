Q: Norman fonts
Birgit Kellner writes:
No, there has never been a separate font for 'bold'. The bold forms on the
Macintosh are simply obtained by using the standard Mac facility to
embolden any font. Since this produces an acceptable result, no bold font
was, as far as I know, ever created.
You can also produce an 'italic' version using the system facilities, but
this is simply slanted rather than true italics; so a separate italic font
was created.
