The information under South Asian Gopher is a little outdated - we are now
'automatic', although I do add the new members to the list by hand.
Anyone caring to join should drop me a  note under
                gor05 at rz.uni-kiel.d400.de
and I'll be glad to add your name to the list. Right now there are about 140
of us on the list, new members are always welcome.
