Namaste!
        I'll put my oar in with a mythological remark:
        The cutting of ennemy's right arm and shoulder is very well
attested in some indo-european traditions (examples in the Beowulf or in a
Scythian ritual related by Herodotus). If related, the gesture would be
clearly a submissive attitude (see too the 'shake hand').
        Just a track. Who will be the hunter ? (perhaps a search in indian
epic would be fruitful ...)
Friendly,
