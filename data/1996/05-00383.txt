You might be on the right track. If he is a pANDava, then it must be 
Arjuna, for he disguised himself as a paNDa during the 5 brothers' stay 
at king VirATa's court.  So maybe Thompson and Zwilling are both right.
Besides, there is something about Arjuna and the white color...
However, I must inform you that while studying the little known Trivya 
PurANa this morning, I came across the following:
This text refers to him as mAyAkAla jakSaNa (originally kSaNaja, but, 
again, the name was altered in order to deceive).  He is said to have 
been "born in an instant."  He was punished by the gods for playing so 
many tricks, and he is frequently seen roaming the Indian countryside 
yelling: pIDita! pIDita!  tormented! tormented! All animals run scared when 
they hear his loud roars which, in his garbled pronunciation sound like 
beat it! beat it!
Maybe this helps explain why those monkeys ran away.
