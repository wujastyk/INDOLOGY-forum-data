E-mail Addresses
I would be obliged if someone would give me the e-mail address(es) of:
1. Unto Tahitinen (author of _Non-violent Theories of Punishment_);
and
2. Toshikazu Arai (of Hawaii) who contributed "Jain kingship as viewed in 
the _Prabandacinta+man.i_" in Richards' (ed) _Kingship and Authority in 
South Asia (Wisconsin, 1978).
Many Thanks.
