In Kerala the traditional attaire of the male is "dhothi" and
"angavasthram". Traditionally the angavasthram is removed from one's
shoulder and tied around the waist before entering temples etc. Today , as
far as I know, all temples allow the male to keep the angavasthram over the
upper boady, except for the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum, which
is still a private temple belonging to the Trivandrum royal family.

But in the temples of Northern India, once enters the temples fully clothed! 

I have no idea whether this is related to the Buddhist custom.
