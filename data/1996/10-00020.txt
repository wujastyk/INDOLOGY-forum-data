Upper body clothing ...
In Kerala the traditional attaire of the male is "dhothi" and
"angavasthram". Traditionally the angavasthram is removed from one's
shoulder and tied around the waist before entering temples etc. Today , as
far as I know, all temples allow the male to keep the angavasthram over the
upper boady, except for the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum, which
is still a private temple belonging to the Trivandrum royal family.
But in the temples of Northern India, once enters the temples fully clothed! 
I have no idea whether this is related to the Buddhist custom.
