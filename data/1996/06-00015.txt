Dear colleagues,

I am unable to locate a copy of the folowing book:

Society and Culture in Northern India in the Twelfth Century.
B. N. S. Yadav (or is it Yadava?)
Allahabad, 1973

It is mentioned by Romila Thapar in "Epic and History,"in Past & Present, 
Number 125 (1989):21, n.
Any help would be appreciated.
