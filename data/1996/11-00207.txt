Dear David, I would be be grateful if you could pass the following
information to our fellow South Asian Netters...

============================
Dear Colleagues:

The Sage is going to begin publishing a Yearbook of South Asian
Languages and Linguistics which will contain (among other things)
field reports of work on South Asian languages in various regions of
the world. I am in the process of writing the feild report from the
North American region.  I'd be grateful to hear about any research on
these languages conducted particularly in the North America.  Many
thanks in advance for your assistance in letting us put together
integrated information about the work in question.
