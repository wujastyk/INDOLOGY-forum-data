Date of the Veda
May I ask the list members for some advice?
I would like to create a collection of CDs with Indian music (mostly
classical), but Oslo is not exactly crammed with music shops that offer a
good selection. I am therefore interested in finding a music shop abroad
that sells Indian music, and that could supply me by mail (I pay with my
credit card). 
I am going to Paris next week, so if there is such a shop in Paris, please
let me know!
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
