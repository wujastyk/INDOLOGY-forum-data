I would like to know whether anyone out there successfully uses IZIRB's
APPEAL.TTF for Windows 3.1 with Winword 6.0. To me, it seems that (at least
Japanese) Winword is unable to access some of the characters, in particular
the visarga, because they occupy rather curious ANSI-positions. 

If anybody should know a solution to this (I know, I could juggle around
characters with Fontographer again, but I am getting sick and tired of
this), please contact me via private e-mail.
