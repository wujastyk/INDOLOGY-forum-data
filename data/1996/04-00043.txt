Vikram Seth - II
According to the (Northern) Indian tradition, right (sanskrit dakSiNa) is =
south (because you are looking to the east which is in front of you). The
northwest corner would then be the lower left corner of the post-card. But
I am not competent to decide whether Seth followed this logic or not.
