Message-ID: <161227022353.23782.16581933824212075555.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In order to defend our position for hindi at our department (administrative
nasties are threatening to replace it with another subject) I need some
information about the teaching of urdu and hindi at Australian and Canadian
universities.

Question 1: Which universities teach regular urdu and/or hindi courses?

Question 2: How many students tend to attend these courses?

Question 3: How many students take examinations at higher levels?

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
