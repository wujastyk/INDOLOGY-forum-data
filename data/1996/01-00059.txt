urdu-hindi teaching
In order to defend our position for hindi at our department (administrative
nasties are threatening to replace it with another subject) I need some
information about the teaching of urdu and hindi at Australian and Canadian
universities.
Question 1: Which universities teach regular urdu and/or hindi courses?
Question 2: How many students tend to attend these courses?
Question 3: How many students take examinations at higher levels?
Thank you for your help!
Best regards,
