Since some of you have shown interest and appreciation in my
earlier posting, and to those who have asked for further
information on the subject, I post herewith some more references,
not only about images in school textbooks but also in other print
media, that you may wish to consult for writing an article/paper
on 'Images of Stereotypes of India and Indians'. I may have
missed some publications due to my neglect of this subject for
the pastseveral years. If it is the case please do post your
findings to the list.
