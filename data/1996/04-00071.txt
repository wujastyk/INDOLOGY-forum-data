The person who posted this message has been given a first warning about
using INDOLOGY as a means for circulating non-indological materials.

Three such warnings result in being struck from the INDOLOGY list.

Of course I am horrified by the behaviour described by the poster, and
sympathize with the protest against such barbarism.  However, such
emotions to not constitute a valid reason for posting a message to
INDOLOGY which does not concern indological studies.
