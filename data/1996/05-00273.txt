Guru, as the name of the planet Jupiter, is surely not intended to mean 
heavy, but, rather, important, it is BRhaspati, the preceptor of the 
gods, and so the equivalent of Jupiter/Zeus.  That shani means slow is 
surely connected to the fact that it is the slowest of the planets known 
in antiquity. This, in itself, does not establish who first discovered 
that it was the slowest, but it was part of the astronomical/astrological 
knowledge transmitted from the mediterranean to India. In fact, it is an 
important part of the astrological symbolism of Saturn, as the one who 
establishes limits, and is associated with patience, perseverance and 
endurance.
As for jagata, which I suppose you mean as the rotating earth, the word 
jagat means something that moves, that is alive.  So it also means people 
or animals.  It probably means the earth by extension, that is, the 
place of the living.  Trying to read into it the knowledge of the earth's 
rotation is highly speculative.
