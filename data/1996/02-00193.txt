It is available from INDOLOGY:
        http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
and choose
        "supplementary gopher/software"
or by anonymous ftp from
        ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/software

The font is available in PostScript or TrueType formats; the file names
make clear which is which.  I assume the Mac wants the latter type,
though I have never used a Mac and am not sure.  Another, similar font
called Utopia was recently added to the offerings.  Try it out?
