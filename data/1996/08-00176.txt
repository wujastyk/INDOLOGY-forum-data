There is a short work that you might find useful: A Primer in Grantha
Characters by K. Venugopalam of Deccan College, published by James H. Nye,
319 West Swift Street, St. Peter, Minnesota 56082 USA (1983).  The
publisher's address may well have changed since the date of publication,
but you might be able to get a copy from a bookseller in India.  George
