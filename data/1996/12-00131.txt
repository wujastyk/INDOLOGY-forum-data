Hyphenation patterns and ITRANS/SKT/etc.
Hello,
I would like to know whether anyone here who uses ITRANS/SKT/etc. has
found a successful method which allows for automatic hyphenation of
devanaagarii in the LaTeX environment. I frequently am presented with
"overfull boxes" due to extra-long Sanskrit sentences running off into
the margin, and would like to know if there is any easier way to prevent
this from happening rather than introducing line breaks throughout the
sentences.
Thanks.
Regards,
