Dear Indologists,

   Since things seem a bit slow on the list these days, I thought I'd
mention that the complete bibliographies of Professors Ludo Rocher, Rosane
Rocher, and Wilhelm Halbfass are available via their respective home 
pages. (Photos included!) These can be found  on the 'faculty' list of the 
South Asia Regional Studies home page. The address:

best, Tim Cahill
