In addition to Sudipto Chatterjee's useful information, I would also urge
that you contact them to ascertain the plans for shifting the India Office
collections to the new British Library St. Pancras site.  At one point I
was told it would likely be sometime in 1997, but my recollections of the
move from Westminster to Orbit House, lead to the notion that it would be
wise to check once, and check again later.
