Does anyone knkow where I can obtain a translation of the so-called Shri
Sukta, which in Isidor Scheftelowitz's "Die Apokryphen des Rgveda", appears
as Texts 2.6.1-19. (Note: in Bloomfield, it begins at RVKh 5.87.1)
 Scheftelowitz comments below the text: 
In Indien ist dieses Srisukta fur sich allein nebts mehreren Komm.
herausgegeben.
I would especially appreciate information on a reliable, or somewhat reliable
translation, and how to get it.
 Many thanks,
