7 Bit tutorial
This is a good point. CDAC, Pune tried to standardize the character set for
Indian
language scripts, by simply lining up the glyph components from 032 to 255.
The glyphs
are the ones taught to school children. The same glyph standard is used
in Scanrom 1500+  fonts .http://www.chorus.cycor.ca/multipc/company/s__001.htm

The advantages are GUI and portability: the fonts popup on the Windows
screen (MS Word 7.0)
as an ANSI chart and the user can use the mouse and point and click to insert
the glyphs desired.
