Online resources on Mughal mss
A patron is planning to start a computer database on Mughal manuscripts
and would like to be sure no one else is already doing so.  Is anyone
aware of such a thing?  Are there any on Persian manuscripts in general?
Please feel free to forward to lists on Islamic studies lists, South
Asian art, etc.
Thanks,
