painted goats
In the mountains of northern Pakistan, such goats have a patch of pink dye
on them. I asked why it was done and was told only that it identified the
goats to be sacrificed.
Of course, if it has non-Islamic connotations, people might not know about
them, or might not feel like discussing them.
