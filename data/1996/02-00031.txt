Film on Holi
It may be helpful to point out that a social reversion to chaos is
understood in the history of religions as a perfectly normal, natural
event, one that renews and reaffirms the structures and strictures of
social interaction during the remainder of the year. Such festivities
have not, in the history of religions, implied that participants are in
any way inferior or abnormal. Mardi Gras in New Orleans and the great
annual festival of Rio de Janero two such examples, as is Holi. Why a
person should take offense at the notion of chaos is something that
might deserve a closer look: chaos theory has gained a well-earned
reputation in both the sociological and scientific communities. If
Mr. Rajagopalan has difficulty with the notion of chaos, he should perhaps
deal with that in a conversation group more concerned with psychological
issues.
