unedited text /NGMPP films
    Just to set the record straight, the availability of microfilms 
from the NGMPP is not restricted only to persons of German 
nationality or to members of the Deutsche Morgenlaendische 
Gesellschaft.  In terms of the agreement between His Majesty's 
Government of Nepal and the DMG, the copyright for the materials 
microfilmed rests with the Nepalese Government.  
    For copies of microfilms and permission to publish them, 
all interested parties are therefore requested to write to:  
        The Chief Research Scholar
        National Archives
        Ramshahpath
        Kathmandu, Nepal
    As you are likely aware, a preliminary title list is being 
prepared here in Hamburg. Individuals wishing to order a microfilm 
would be best advised to contact us first. Requests (from anyone!) 
regarding manuscript titles, microfilm reel numbers, etc., may be 
directed to our address:
        NGMPP
        Institut fuer Indien und Tibet
        Neue Rabenstrasse 3
        D-20354 Hamburg
        Germany
    Whether one orders directly from the National Archives or 
contacts us, we would appreciate being informed of orders made since 
we keep a list of all manuscripts already ordered.
