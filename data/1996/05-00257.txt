Hinduism and Human Rights
Human rights violations are perpetrated in all parts of the world, and the
univeral reaction to such atrocities is over-whelmingly one of horror and
sadness. Yet, as Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im and his contributors attest in
_Human rights in cross-cultural perspectives_ and _Human rights in Africa:
cross-cultural perspectives_, our viewpoint is clouded and biased by the
expectations native to our own culture. So how does Hindu culture/s view
human rights issues?  An analysis of human rights issues through multiple
Hindu viewpoints will help us to reinterpret and reconstruct prevailing
theories of human rights. In any case, references to published material on
Hinduism and human rights will be much appreciated. 
Thanks in advance.
