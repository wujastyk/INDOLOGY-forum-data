Re: upanishads
	Previously, in this newsgroup and others, there has been some
discussion on the authentic 108 upanishhads, and the list found in
the muktika upanishhad. Earlier, Vijay Pai had posted a similar list,
and here is the modified list (with minor changes, and also now in
ITRANS for sanskrit output).
	Here is the list from the muktika upanishhad. This is 
narrated by Sri Ramachandra to Hanuman.
	The only means by which the final emancipation is attained is
through maaNDUkya upanishhad alone, which is enough for the salvation for
all aspirants. If GYAna is not attained therebym study the 10 upanishhads;
thou shalt soon attain GYAna, and then My Seat. O son of ajnjanaa, if thy
GYAna is not made firm, practice (study) well the 32 upanishhads. Thou
shalt get release. If thou longest after videhamukti, study the 108
upanishhads. I will truly state in order the (names of the) upanishhads
with their Shaanti (purificatory mantras). Hearken to them. (They are:)
