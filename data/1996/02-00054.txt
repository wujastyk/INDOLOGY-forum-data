South indian incised mss
A reference has already been supplied by somebody else. Among others, 
you can also refer to 
    Losty: The art of the book in India.
As to the process of writing, there may again be different ways of
doing it. One way is to hold the leaf in one hand, fingers parallel
to the leaf. The fingers below are the desk, so to speak, while the
thumb presses the leaf gently against the fingers and at the same
time provides the bottom line for writing. The front part of the
iron stylus rests on the back of the thumb and its shaft is moved
around.
Sorry, I can't describe it any better.
