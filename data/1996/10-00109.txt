Baffled by the BSR
I hate to admit it, but I am at wits end with a passage in Hari Diksita's 
_B.rhacchabdaratna_. It is on _iko ya.n aci_, my old friend, but I can't 
figure out the following passage. It begins with a short objection. Then 
there's a short reply to that objection. Remember that the _BSR_ is a 
commentary on the _Prau.dhamanoramA_ of Bha.t.toji DIk.sita. I will be 
grateful for any hints or suggestions. I am using the BHU edition, 1964, 
edited by Sitaram Shastri. If you have that text handy, you'll find the 
passage beginning on the last line of p 84. Here's the text:
