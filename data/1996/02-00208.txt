promoting research in integrating the traditional knowledge of the hoary 
past and the modern scientific and technological studies and to bring out 
their contemporary relevance through applied sciences.
    The deemed University and the library have been working to promote 
research in Indian culture, religion and philosophy and propagate their 
value to all sections of people in the country and abroad too, library 
functionaries said here today.
    Books on veda, vedanga, darsana, purana, ayurveda, silpa, arthasasthra,
kavya, music, folklore, temples, history, astrology, science, electronics,
communication, mathematics, commerce, business administration, management,
behavioural sciences and other subjucts are being acquired in the library.
    In addition, there are over 5000 palmleaf manuscripts on a wide range 
of subjects which are being processed for microfilming.
