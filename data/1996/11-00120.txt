????Cash Cows for Hindi teachers?????
Reply to Richard Barz' reply to Zydenbos' reply to Wujastyk:
but contest Richard Barz' statement. I will restrict myself to a subject on
which I can speak from experience: Nepali. Hindi is not the cultural
language of Nepal, Nepali is, and it has the vocabulary and grammatical
flexibility to handle all the topics I could think of discussing during a
two year stay (doing lexicographic research). The more abstract vocabulary
comes mostly from Sanskrit, but so does that of Hindi.
With best wishes,
