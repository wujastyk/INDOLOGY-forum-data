Inquiry re: the nature of 'kaarikaa'
The most succinct description I know of concerninga kArikA is found in
Hemacandra's AbhidhAnacintAmaNi (2.172): kArikA tu svalpavRttau bahor
arthasya sUcinI.  This captures the essence: it is a verse that conveys a
great deal in a short compass, so that it is a verse equivalent of a sUtra
(which also can at least in part be metrical)
