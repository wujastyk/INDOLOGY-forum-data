Kuravanji
Though Ganesan and Peter are correct in observing that there are no 
book-length studies of Kuravanci, an excellent paper has been prepared on 
the subject by Indira Peterson (who I believe is actually working on a 
book-length version):
"The Play of the Kuravanci Fortuneteller: Pluralistic Discourses of 
Identity in an 18th Century South Indian Literary Genre" (originally 
prepared for the Workshop on Cultural Production and Cultural History in 
the Middle East and South Asia, and later for the AAS).
