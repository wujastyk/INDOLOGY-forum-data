In addition to Weber's edition and translation (Halle, 1881), you may be
interested in the following: The GAthAsaptazatI of SAtavAhan, with the
commentary of GangAdharabhaTTa, edited by DurgAprasAd and KaxInAth
PaNDurang Parab (KAvyamAlA 21); Bombay, Nirnayasagar Pr., 1889;
KavivatsalahAlasAtavAhanaviracitA GAthAsaptazatI (GAhAsattasaI), savimarx
'PrakAxa' hind^vyAkhyopetA (KSS 192), Varanasi, Chowkhamba, 1969.  A fairly
recent edition of a related work, the VajjAlaggam (ed. M. V. Patwardhan,
Ahmedabad, 1969 [Prakrit Text Society Series 14]), has a good introduction,
including a listing of verses common to the VajjAlaggam and the
GAthAsaptazatI.  George Cardona
