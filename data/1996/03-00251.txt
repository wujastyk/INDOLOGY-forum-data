Q: nA.tyasya mAtara.h
I'm reading the nA.tya"sAstra these days, and one phrase has been 
particularly troubling. Who are the "mothers of the nA.tya"? In the 
edition by Nagar put out by Parimal publishers the phrase that means that 
appears in 3.30, 3.67, and what I take to be a synonymous phrase, simply 
mAtara.h, appears in 3.87. The AbhinavabhAratI is silent about this, at 
least at those spots.
Gratefully,
