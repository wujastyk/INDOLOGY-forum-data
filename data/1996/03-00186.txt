Why not a definitive devnagri font
ucgadkw at ucl.ac.uk (Dr Dominik Wujastyk)  has  recently written as
follows:
I am not sure about last year but it seems they have a new release
that does not seem that clumsy.
That was the point of my note. At least one mailer does allow devnagri
fonts. If had one standard Hindi font with standard keyboard
assignments then other mailers may also start including it in there
offering. As I said if Arabic and Japanese fonts can supported by MS,
why not Devnagri fonts as well.
In the mean time we have some means of making ends meet by Bmail.
Bmail is being offered for free for now but even later (April 15) the
price is not unreasonably high. The only problem is having to settle
on a standard fonts and at least on this list we can have a consensus
of have some standard font. And let us vote it out.
Have a nice day.
