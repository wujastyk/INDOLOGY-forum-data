"Out of India"

Renfrew (Archaeology and Language, chapter 6) explains how the "wave of
advance" hypothesis can account for movements of eighteen kilometers for
each generation of twenty-five years, or about one kilometer per year.
Such a slow, continuous expansion through the elite dominance of nomadic
pastoral communities, using horses for draught, but not for riding, can
account for the movements we need, given an the time-depth of the
migration period.  See his "Hypothesis B" in ch. 8. 
All this is discussed in great detail by Renfrew, q.v.
