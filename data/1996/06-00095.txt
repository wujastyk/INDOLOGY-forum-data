I can't see that there is any contradiction. We would of course not have to
do everything at a once. We could start nice and easy with the most recent
stuff and work our way backwards. If the Austronesian guys can do something
like this, why shouldn't we be able to? I suggest that we discuss this in
Bangalore in January.
