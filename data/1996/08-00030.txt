answer to Lis Harris
Dear List Members,
I learned there were reactions from SYDA to Lis Harris article "O Guru, Guru,
Guru" from 14 Nov 1994 (The New Yorker) published in another issue of the
same paper. The problem is I cannot ask library to send a demand for them for 
want of data concernig the date and numbers of pages of the issue the 
reactions were printed in. Does anybody know them?
