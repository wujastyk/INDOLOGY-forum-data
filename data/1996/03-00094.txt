Gondawanaland BhAsha?
I read that the language spoken by some tribal groups in central India
(Gonda?) is related to the language spoken by Aborigines in Australia.  If
this is true--would someone please cite some research on this topic?  [If
it is not true, it it certainly a facinating bit of academic folklore.]
Thank you,
Yvette Rosser
