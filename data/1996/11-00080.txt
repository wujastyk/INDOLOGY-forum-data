Vidhi / arthavaada
Dear Indologists,
I am wondering whether the hermeneutic rules regarding the distinction
between vidhi and arthavaada only apply to sentences of a normative
character or also to assertions ("judgments"). Generally this distinction
aims exclusively at being able to decide what part of a sentence should be
understood as a prescription for action and what can be left out as praise
or explanation. But is it nowhere discussed whether this distinction also
apply to the possibility of ascertaining what is true (about the nature of
things, not about what ought to be done) and what is not?
Best wishes
