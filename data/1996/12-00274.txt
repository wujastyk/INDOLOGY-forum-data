Parijata - Thanks
Thank you very much for the references (esp. the Telugu ones) on 
Parijatapaharana Nataka.  The reference to a printed edition of Tarigonda 
Venkamba's "Srivisnu Parijatamu" is invaluable.  Many thanks again.
Any additional citations would be greatly appreciated.  
Kind Regards, 
Devesh
