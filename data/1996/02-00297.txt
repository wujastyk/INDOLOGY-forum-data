Veda`s demise at NY Hinduja Ctr.
My name is Saurav Sarkar and I am an 18 year old Indian-American. I speak 
Bengali as my native language and I was wondering if anyone could point 
me to a good source, in english, to the history of Bengali as a language 
and its origins.
Thanking you,
Saurav Sarkar
