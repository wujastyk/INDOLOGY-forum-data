Query: Verse referencing in the Samaveda.
Hello - 
Could anyone please provide me with details regarding the proper
referencing of verses of the Samaveda?
For instance, when quoting or refering to a verse from Rgveda Book I,
hymn 150, the following is used: Rv. I.150.1; or from the Yajurveda Book
15, verse 35, the following: Yv. XV.35.
Mostly, I've seen verses of the Samaveda referenced/quoted using a serial
number, but once noticed that the prapaaThaka, ardha, khaNDa, and dashati
of the verse were all given.
Is there an accepted or standard method of refering/quoting verses of the
Samaveda?
Thank you.
Regards,
