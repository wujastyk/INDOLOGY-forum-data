Subject: Query: Verse referencing in the Samaveda.
Message-ID: <161227026398.23782.6287883807485917776.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Hello - 

Could anyone please provide me with details regarding the proper
referencing of verses of the Samaveda?

For instance, when quoting or refering to a verse from Rgveda Book I,
hymn 150, the following is used: Rv. I.150.1; or from the Yajurveda Book
15, verse 35, the following: Yv. XV.35.

Mostly, I've seen verses of the Samaveda referenced/quoted using a serial
number, but once noticed that the prapaaThaka, ardha, khaNDa, and dashati
of the verse were all given.

Is there an accepted or standard method of refering/quoting verses of the
Samaveda?

Thank you.

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
