Hello Robin ,

I am told by my Maharashtrian friends that the hotels and restaurants in 
Alandi are many more in number now in last 10 years but still it is a 
calm and quiet place for sure.

By the way, I would like to know how you got interested in this great 
Maharashtrian saint/poet ?  Have you read "Dnyaneshwari" or have you 
heard the beautiful audio tapes that have songs/abhangas by Dnynneshwar ?

-- Swagata .
