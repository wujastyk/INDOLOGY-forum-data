	It is true that there are a lot of pre-Paninian fanciful 
etymologies and that the Paninian tradition attempted to bring some 
methodological sophistication.  However, we should not brush aside 
'fanciful' etymologies, except when they are offered as jokes.  For 
example, the Prakrit word 'arihanta' is indeed accountable as a transform 
of Skt. arhant with an epenthetic vowel.  However, the Jains and the 
Buddhists interpreted, in all seriousness, this word as ari+hanta 
"destroyer of enemies", where these enemies are the unwholesome states of 
mind, etc.  Such linguistically fanciful etymologies are critical for our 
understanding of the synchronic comprehension of those terms and concepts 
by the respective communities.  Similarly, while the historical origins 
of the name Hindu is clearly connected with the river Sindhu, and the 
Persian pronunciation of this name, one need not throw out the midieval 
etymology of the word 'hindu' with 'himsaam duuzayati'.  Such an 
etymology reflects what is seen by large segments of Hindus as a 
prominent feature of their religious identity.
