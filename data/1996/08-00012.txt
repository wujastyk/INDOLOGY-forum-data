division of labour in ascetic groups
Hello everyone!
I have a query. Who knows (contemporary) empirical studies on the 
organization of work, ownership of property, exchange, use of money etc. 
within Hindu or Buddhist ascetic groups/monasteries? I am writing on Jain 
ascetics and could't find much comparative material so far. Any help is 
warmly appreciated!
