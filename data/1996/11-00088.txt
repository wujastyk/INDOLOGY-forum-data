Given the recent discussion of the difficulty of maintaining academic positions
in the study of Sanskrit, the following request for information may seem either
salvific or quite poignant.

I wonder whether there is any university that offers instruction in any Indic
language, or Arabic, by interactive TV.  This would present the possibility of
language instruction long-distance at universities that did not see a need to
hire a Sanskritist (for example) but where occasional students had an interest.
I'd appreciate hearing any replies.
