Prof. Aklujkar,
Yes, the word Arbu, Arubu, Arpu is Kannada meaning: crying aloud; ArbaTa =
crying aloud, roaring; a loud note or sound; e.g. vAdyada ArbaTada permorahu
(i.e. the loud note of the instrument); ArbaTasu = to cry aloud, to roar
ArbATa is Telugu; in Tamil: ArppATTam. However, Arpu means valour, impetuosity.
The root sememe is: Ar (-pp, -tt-) to shout, roar, bellow, slander, vilify
(Tamil); The Sanskritization is: raT = to howl, roar, yell, etc. (to
scream); AraTa = crying out (pANini); AraTi = noise; ArDA = loud bawling
(Marathi); AraDai = cries out (Prakrt) roA-rAT = lamentation (Hindi)
