Submergence of archaeological sites
This may be old news, but . . .
I recently did a narch search for information about the Narmada Sagar dam 
project in Madhya Pradesh. One of the articles that I received in that 
context is from Feb. 1995 and states:
"Areas of archaeological importance and remnants of archaeological 
monuments would be submerged because of the Sardar Sarovar, Narmada Sagar 
and Indira Sagar projects currently under implementation.
"This was stated by the Deputy Chief Minister, Mr. Subhash Yadav in a 
written reply to a question from Mr. Sunil Jain of the Congress (I).
"The minister said that these three projects would lead to the 
submergence of 24 archaeological sites and 56 remnants, temples or other 
archaeological material."
this article was printed.
I hope that my colleagues interested in archaeology are on top of these 
developments.
