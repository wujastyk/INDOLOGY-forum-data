re Kalanos the gymnosophist
Dear Mr Zydenbos,
I do'nt want to be a nit-picker, but because you mentioned F.R.Leavis I
would like to comment about my experience of taking a degree in English (
I'am a native speaker , however an American) at Leiden University in the
'60's, Leavis was the cat's pyjamas as far as English literary theory was
concerned, eventhough he wrote a very, sometimes grammatically, obscure
English.  Perhaps you are too young to know the impact Leavis had on a
generation of "English " European scholars.  This message only to underline
that we must tread softly with our statements.
Met vriendelijke groeten,
Marianne Oort
