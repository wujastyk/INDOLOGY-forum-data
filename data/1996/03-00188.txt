Right & Left
In response to Dr. J.B. Bapat who writes:
By Occam's Razor a simpler explanation may be that during the wedding
ceremony the bride stands to the right UNTIL the appointed time for her to
move to her appointed place as wife, at her husband's left.  Iconographic
sanction for this reasoning is common in South Indian KalyANa-sundara mUrti
groupings and occurs as early at the mid-6th c. at Elephanta, where Parvati
stands on Shiva's right side, being presented to him by "brother" Vishnu at
her right side.
