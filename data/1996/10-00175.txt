Hinduism on the world wide web
Dear Mary,
Always lovely to see your name in my email in-tray.  Gary mentioned
recently that things have been particularly hectic a few weeks ago;
everything okay?
About the student: there is, of course, quite a bit of material in the
INDOLOGY archives.  Every message that passes through the INDOLOGY list is
archived at the "mother site" in Liverpool, and is key-word searchable.
