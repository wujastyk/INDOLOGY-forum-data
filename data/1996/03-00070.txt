Khajuraho (in a triveni with Changes in Indology, Mbh ref.)
Dear Colleagues,
I seem to agree with Michael Rabe's suggestion that we keep indology
unchanged in light of what he says.  Yes, many of us were often irritated
with the level to which discussions sliped, but one good thing was that it
opened up controversial matters for open discussion.
