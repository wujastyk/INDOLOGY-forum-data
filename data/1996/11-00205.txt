Origin of retroflexes: answers to Hock's objections?

As a non-Dravidist, I am here at a loss! I don't know what is going on in
Dravidology. But in principle, of course, you are right. The problem with
historical phonology is, however, that things develop at a different pace in
different places. Some languages are incredibly conservative, whereas others
develop incredibly fast. And the problem with Dravidian languages as far as
a I know is that the earliest sources are only about 2200 years old (Tamil).
For the oldest Indo-European languages, you may add another 1000 years or
more (the oldest Hittite sources go back to about 1800 B.C.E.). Thus, even
if we are able to reconstruct a system with dentals, alveolars and
retroflexes for Proto-Dravidian, we cannot say exactly when this system
disappeared in the areas where the Indo-Aryans and the Dravidians met. At
least in theory, it may have gone down the drain before the Indo-Aryans
arrived on the scene. But before I make a complete fool of myself discussing
something about which I know nothing, I'll leave the matter to Dravidologists!
Nice! :-)
I should think that both parties would be mispronouncing each others' words.
That is usually the way it is. (If you ever get a chance to watch a British
TV sit-com called "'Allo 'Allo" you will see what GRAND mispronunciation can
achieve).
