Encyclopaedia of Kashmir Shaivism
Hello!
I am trying to locate the "Encyclopaedia of Kashmir Shaivism" written by
B.N. Pandit. I would very much appreciate if you could let me know where
to find this book, the publisher , year, any other indication. Do you
know of other reference books on Kashmir Shaivism?
Thank you very much.
