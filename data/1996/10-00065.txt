Tenure-track position available in South Asian History
Carleton College announces a tenure-track assistant professorship, beginning 
September 1997.  (In exceptional circumstances, appointment at higher rank 
may be considered.)  We are looking for someone with broad teaching and 
research interests and a strong commitment to undergraduate teaching in a 
liberal arts environment.  Candidates should have a specialization in Indian 
history (any era), be able to teach a survey in Southeast Asian history, and 
to direct a seminar on women in Asia.  Some teaching experience is 
desirable.  To apply, submit a letter of application, a c.v., a graduate 
transcript, syllabi of one or two courses you have taught or could teach, 
and three letters of recommendation by December 10, 1996, to Prof. Philip 
Niles, Department of History, Carleton College, One N. College Street, 
Northfield, MN  55057.  We will interview at the AHA annual meeting.  
Carleton College is an AA/EOE; we particularly encourage applications from 
women and members of minority groups.
