Position in Sikh Studies

The University of Michigan seeks candidates for a tenure-track or tenured 
endowed position in Sikh Studies, beginning in September 1997.  This 
endowed chair is intended to promote the study of Sikh culture, history, 
literature, philosophy, and religion, which expands the Universitys 
teaching and research activities in South Asian civilizations.  The 
appointment may be located among departments that include Asian Languages 
and Cultures, Anthropology, Comparative Literature, Film and Video, 
History, Philosophy, and Sociology.  Qualifications include a Ph.D. in an 
appropriate social science or humanities discipline, native or 
near-native competence in Panjabi, the ability to situate the study of 
Sikh topics within the broader study of South Asia, and the capacity to 
link Sikh studies with the theory, methodologies, and knowledge of a 
social science or humanities discipline.  Teaching duties, to be 
determined by the successful applicants academic background, will include 
courses which integrate Sikh studies with a liberal arts discipline and 
the study of South Asia, and may include the teaching of Panjabi.  
Materials received by May 1, 1996 will receive first consideration, but 
applications will be reviewed until the position is filled.
