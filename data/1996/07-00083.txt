===================================================================
TO ALL SOUTH ASIA CENTERS:
The Cornell-Syracuse Consortium invites applications for a visiting
full-time, one-semester position in Contemporary South Asian history
shared between Cornell and Syracuse Universities. The teaching load
consists of two upper division undergraduate courses; one each at Cornell
and Syracuse.  Areas within modern South Asian History are open, but
concentration in economic, environmental or colonial history would be an
advantage.  Also very desirable are cross-disciplinary competence and
evident intellectual enthusiasm. 
Although the position is short-term, it will pay a regular junior level
salary with no benefits.  It will also, we hope, provide a younger
historian with exposure at the Cornell-Syarcuse Consortium which is
recognized as a National Resource Center.  Review of applications will
begin 10 October, 1996. 
Please forward a copy of your dossier, c.v., and three letters of
recommendation to both:
