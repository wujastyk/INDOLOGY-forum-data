New BOOK SERIES 2
ANNOUNCING A NEW BOOK SERIES from World Heritage Press
			World Heritage Hindu Studies
		     Series editor: Gerald James Larson
The series, _World Heritage Hindu Studies_, seeks to stimulate fresh
scholarship and research in the academic study of Hinduism. Its purpose is
to publish significant scholarly studies on all aspects of Hindu studies.
These include: the Vedas, Upanisads, Epics, Puranas, law-books, and so
forth; classical, medieval and modern philosophical traditions;  monastic
traditions; Bhakti traditions; modern Hindu and neo-Hindu movements; and
Hinduism in relation to other religious traditions both within and outside
of India. We also welcome submissions on methodological issues in the
study of Hinduism. We invite submissions of both the most traditional
scholarship and the most daring current modes of inquiry.
