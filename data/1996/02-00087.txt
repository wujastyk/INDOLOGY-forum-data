Indus Kohistan
Dear Indology subscribers,
I have been working on the Shina language of Indus Kohistan in Pakistan
(grammatical analysis, lexicography, design of a writing system etc.).
Is there anyone else out there working on any topic concerned with Indus
Kohistan, or any of the adjacent regions?
Best regards,
