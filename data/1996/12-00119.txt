> 2) Indo-Aryans into Iran and India (2nd millenium B.C.)
> 3) Greek tribes into Greece (2nd millenium B.C.)
> 4) Italic tribes into Italy (2nd millenium B.C)

These four depend on a model of the spread of IE languages which is
still the subject of heated discussions.

> 6) Germanic tribes, reaching Scandinavia possibly 800 B.C.
