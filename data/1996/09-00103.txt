Right, I would love to learn all these European languages and have access
to loads of scholarly literature in those langauges. But before I can get
to doing that, as an Indian, there are *three* Indian languages that I
*must* learn for various important purposes: the national language --
Hindi, the language of my state -- Tamil, and my community language --
Konkani. Its not that I'm not open to learning European languages -- I
*have* learned some Italian, French, and Spanish but not enough to
understand advanced discussions in those languages. So I, for one, would
prefer it if English was used as the business language on Indology.
