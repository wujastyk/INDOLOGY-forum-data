8-bit was not the subject of this, so the whole ISO 8859 1-9 is out of
topic, as you would say. Moreover this is not a "report", but a draft
scheme, which you would have known if you actually read it through -- but
you can hardly have managed to do that carefully in so short a time as
since I posted it.
