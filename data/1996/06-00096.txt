This is also true of other areas of indological interest, e.g. where is
the reference tool for Kavya?
Your suggestion is surely most welcome. This will fill a gap in scholarly
documentation.
But I may add some remarks:
1. As Dominik Wujastyk remarks you need a sort of editor/maintainer who
should try to unify the different notices from different sources. Some
people have their own sloppy ways of citing bibliographic data. It should
be clear if it is a reprint (changed or unchanged?), where it is published
and so on. One important thing is also to check the names of the authors:
a title from "Haraprasada Sastri" may be also found under "Shastri",
perhaps also "Sastry". Once I have found a "H. Akira" in a bookseller's
list who is no one else than "Akira Hirakawa".
2. If it is a database in a database format then this may increase search
speed.
3. And counterchecks at least of some of the bibliographical data coming
in will avoid ghost-works (I know some of them: existing only in some
bibliographies). This requires someone with access to a not too small
library.
4. A difficult task is to deal with all the languages of the publications.
Buddhist research is done in all of the major European and Asian
languages. A bibliography of Buddhist materials *must* -- of course --
contain Japanese publications. This means: copying the table of contents
of Indogaku Bukkyogaku Kenkyu isn't enough.
5. The original titles of the works should always be transparent. Nothing
is more annoying than to find a promising English title which is really in
Burmese and you do not read nor understand this language.
