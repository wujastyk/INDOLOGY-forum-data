Halbfass (in his _Indien und Europa_) mentions Greek influence in astronomy and
astrology, noting that there are traces of European terminology ("horaa", for
instance) and even indications in titles, such as "yavanazaastram". There are
also such references in Al-Biruni's work on India (again mentioned in Halbfass'
book).

Yea. (I hope there are heads of philosophy departments in the West seeing
this.)
