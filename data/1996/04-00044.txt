Vikram Seth - II

I've just read the passage, which is on p.42 of my Phoenix House 1993
edition, and "north-west" definitely means "top-left" in the context.
There's nothing astrological or otherwise non-obvious about it.  Mrs
Rupa Mehra is making a birthday card out of a folded bit of white card
and some cut-out stars etc.  She sticks three cut-out stars in the other
corners, reserving the top-left corner for the numerals "35", the age of
the recipient. (Later she sticks a star there too.)
