debates, grammar, & Vedic
The skill in debate was indeed an essential skill for most traditions in 
India, not limited to grammarians by any means.  The focus on debate was 
more a focus on the logic built into any situation, rather than on 
language per se.  Currently I am reading the Carakasamhitaa with a 
student, and the debates in Carakasamhita are as exhilerating as the 
debates in Patanjali's Mahabhaazya.  It was through debates that one 
would sharpen both one's conclusions, as well as one's intellectual 
skills.  This is perhaps why the tradition claims:  kaaNaadam paaNiniiyam 
ca sarvaSaastropakaarakam 'the traditions of PaaNini and KaNaada are useful 
for all traditions.'  By the KaNaada tradition, this line mainly intends 
the skill in logic.
