My colleague Dominik Wujastyk recently posted a query for me regarding the 
identification of a 19th century Pali scholar and monk: with the help of  
Indology members this figure was identified as Waskaduwe Subhuti.  My thanks 
to those who got in touch with me.
The letter by Subhuti which raised the issue is one of a small group of 
letters (varying in author, date and subject) generated in 19th-century 
Ceylon, which are now in the catalogue of the Wellcome Institute Western 
Manuscripts Department as MS 7140.
