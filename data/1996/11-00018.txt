Siegel, L, Laughing matters, the comic tradition in India, University of
Chicago Press has many such words, some very innovative.  It also makes
good reading, like his other works.  It could be University of Hawaii press.
If you can't find the book by title or author search, I will be glad to
dig up the exact reference for you.
