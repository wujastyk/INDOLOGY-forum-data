In some South Indian temples (especially in Kerala,

their upper body clothing before entering the temple.  
An example is the famous Guruvayoor temple in Kerala.
Also, when meeting the "Aandavan", a highly-respected 
religious figure among the Tamil Srivaishnava
community, it was proper respectful etiquette for all 
of us males to remove our upper clothing and be 
bare-chested.
I have no idea if this custom is directly related to 
the practice mentioned in your Buddhist sutra, but 
based on my upbringing, I would have imagined that
it is a similar gesture of respect.
