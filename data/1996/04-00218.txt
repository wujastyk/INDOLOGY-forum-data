Reference Books on Sanskrit Linguistics and/or phonology
TMCQ at vax1.miu.edu said:
W. Sidney Allen, _Phonetics in Ancient India_ (London: OUP, 1953,
reprinted 1963) is a classic study.  His _Vox Latina_ and _Vox Graecae_
provide similar materials for those languages, but of course because of
the rich indigenous tradition of phonetics in India, the PIAI book is
special.
