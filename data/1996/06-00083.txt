Recently Mikael Aktor has made the excellent suggestion that members try to
inform each other via Indology of their recent publications.  In fact, I
would like to make a further proposal.  Recently, having had reason to take a
look at some old issues of the _Bibliographie Bouddhique_ I was reminded of
the sad lack of any comperable review these days.  As a Buddhism specialist,
ideally I would hope for a return of the old BB, but I think it will not
happen.  What we on Indology might be able to do, however, is create a
more-or-less informal *Bibliographie Indologique.  How about a Web site that
would contain either new publication information and / or brief summaries of
recent works, either by the author or others.  I do not think that we want to
be too strict about the format.  The old BB often had summaries by the
authors of the works in question.  Obviously these are not critical, but they
are nevertheless extremely helpful in finding out what exists.  So, perhaps
in addition to members notifying each other of their own publications, each
one of us could make an effort to report on recent journals -- especially the
more obscure ones -- and publications that come to our notice.  Their posting
to a searchable web site would make this into a sort of constantly renewable
resource.  I have no computer expertise, but it does not *seem* to me such a
technically difficult thing to set up.  Also, the range of topics covered by
Classical Indian studies would *probably* not generate a list too large to be
managable.

Any responses?
