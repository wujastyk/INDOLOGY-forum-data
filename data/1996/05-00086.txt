Wilhelm Halbfass has a section on Nietzsche's alleged borrowing from Indic
traditions, Nietzsche's own comments on such traditions and what esp.
Buddhism 'did for Nietzsche'  in his "India and Europe",  pp. 125. Halbfass
also gives a number of references to other authors who have dealt with the
matter in more detail, and, not to forget, also deals with Schopenhauer,
Hegel, Schelling etc. 
Just a side-remark, i.e. reference: 
A quite recent book which examines, amongst other issues, "latinitas" and
the function esp. of translation of Greek texts into Latin in the process of
"latinization" is Rita Copeland, _Rhetoric, Hermeneutics and Translation in
the Middle Ages. Academic Translations and Vernacular Texts_, Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press 1991. Copeland gives a lot of material, although
at times, her conclusions seem not too well substantiated by her sources.
Nevertheless, aside from providing useful reading for the Latinization of
Greek philosophy and esp. literature, I found this book very inspiring for
investigating the position of translation in appropriating foreign systems
of thought in general. (No direct consideration of Indian/Oriental
influences, though)
