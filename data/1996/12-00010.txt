Translation help requested
In a Sanskrit text I am currently translating, I found three words not
listed in any of my dictionaries: (1) andolya; (2) vi.dvara; (3) du'scilka
(this last word should have some astrological meaning). Does anyone out
there know the meanings of these words? Thanks in advance.
