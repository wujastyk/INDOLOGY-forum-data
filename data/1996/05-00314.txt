'Fanciful' etymologies (was re. dating)
	While I agree with Dominik that new meanings derived from 
"fanciful" etymologies are not "inherent" in those words, I think he is 
using the word "historical" in a rather limited way.  And, yes, even 
historically useful philological information can be extracted from the 
so-called "fanciful" etymologies.  Consider for example the Upanishadic 
etymology of 'puruza' from 'puri .sete' (puri.saya, puri+.s).  While on 
the one hand, this etymology is extracting a new meaning from the word, 
the break-down of 'puruza' as 'puri+.sa' also hints at the historically 
important factor of Sanskrit/Prakrit diaglossia, such that most Prakrits 
known to us have the word given as 'purisa', 'puri.s', 'puli.sa' etc.  A 
great deal of historically significant philological information can be 
extracted from the fanciful etymologies in the Brahmanas and in the 
Prakrit texts.  It is the historically valid phonology of the word 
'arihanta' in Prakrit which makes its reanalysis as 'ari-hanta' 
possible.  Another historically significant dimension of these latter-day 
etymologies is that they take us closer to the meaning intended by their 
users at a given time.  The claims of our modern "historically and 
philologically justified etymology" cannot be perceived as overriding the 
value of the etymology given by a text, when we are interpreting that text.
