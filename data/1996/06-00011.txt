You are right. While Paa.nini knows halantyam (1.3.3) "halanta" occurs the
first time in Kaatyaayana's vaarttikas. But this has nothing to do with with
written language. I am so familiar with the halanta-cihna of modern Indian
grammars that I have transposed this usage to Paa.nini's time. 

By the way, I may point to an article of H.R. Kapadia who argues strongly
against the use of both "viraama" and "hal", see Kapadia: "A detailed
exposition of the Naagarii, Gujaraatii and Mo.dii scripts." In: ABORI. 19
(1938), p. 386-418, esp. p. 403, n.1: "No grammar written in Sanskrit that I
have come across mentions that the nether stroke ... goes by the name of
viraama or hal. Consequently is this a wront statement due to an improper
understanding of the following suutra occurring in
A.s.taadhyaayiisuutraaa.tha (I.4 110): viraamo 'vasaanam."

We don't have it here, it seems.
