> 
> _Atmabodha_ (trans. Svami Nikhilananda). Madras: Sri Ramakrishna Math.

1946 was the first edition, from New York, with later editions in 1962 
(2nd ed.) and 1967 from Madras and in 1970 from New York again. 

> 
> _Drg-drsya-viveka: an inquiry into the nature of the seer and the seen
> 	(trans. Svami Nikhilananda). Mysore: Sri Ramakrishna Math.

4th edition: 1964, 5th edition: 1970, and 6th edition: 1976. All these 
editions are from Mysore. The author of Drg-drsya-viveka is listed as 
Sankaracarya, but the actual author seems to be Bharati Tirtha of the 
14th cent. 

> 
> _Brahma-sutra-bhasya_ (trans. Svami Gambhirananda). Calcutta: Advaita 
> 	Ashrama.

1st edition in 1965, 3rd edition in 1977. 

> 
> _Vivekacudamani_ (trans. Svami Madhavananda). Calcutta: Advaita Ashrama.

The 9th edition is from Calcutta in 1964. There is a recent commentary to 
the Vivekacudamani by the late Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri, 
that was published in 1973 along with a translation, by the Bharatiya Vidya 
Bhavan.

> 
> _Prabodhsudhakara: the nectar-ocean of enlightenment_ (trans. Samvid). 
> 	Madras: Samata Books.

Prabodhasudhakara: 1984. Samata Books has also re-published the 
collection of Sankara's works that was originally printed around 
1911 from Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam. The older edition is 
usually referred to as the Memorial Edition.

> 
> _Commentary on Katha Upanisad_ (trans. Svami Gambhirananda). Calcutta:
> 	Advaita Ashram.

I am unsure if Swami Gambhirananda's translation of the Katha Upanishad 
was published separately. There is a translation of eight upanishad 
commentaries, that was published in 1957-58 (1st ed.), 1965-66 (2nd ed.) 
and 1972-73 (3rd), in which the Katha Upanishad Bhashya translation is 
included. Other than these, Gambhirananda has translated the Aitareya 
Upanishad Bhashya separately. This was published in 1978 from Calcutta 
Advaita Asrama.
