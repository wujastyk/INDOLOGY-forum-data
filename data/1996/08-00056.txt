works of Sankaracharya
1946 was the first edition, from New York, with later editions in 1962 
(2nd ed.) and 1967 from Madras and in 1970 from New York again. 
4th edition: 1964, 5th edition: 1970, and 6th edition: 1976. All these 
editions are from Mysore. The author of Drg-drsya-viveka is listed as 
Sankaracarya, but the actual author seems to be Bharati Tirtha of the 
14th cent. 
1st edition in 1965, 3rd edition in 1977. 
The 9th edition is from Calcutta in 1964. There is a recent commentary to 
the Vivekacudamani by the late Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri, 
that was published in 1973 along with a translation, by the Bharatiya Vidya 
Bhavan.
Prabodhasudhakara: 1984. Samata Books has also re-published the 
collection of Sankara's works that was originally printed around 
1911 from Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam. The older edition is 
usually referred to as the Memorial Edition.
I am unsure if Swami Gambhirananda's translation of the Katha Upanishad 
was published separately. There is a translation of eight upanishad 
commentaries, that was published in 1957-58 (1st ed.), 1965-66 (2nd ed.) 
and 1972-73 (3rd), in which the Katha Upanishad Bhashya translation is 
included. Other than these, Gambhirananda has translated the Aitareya 
Upanishad Bhashya separately. This was published in 1978 from Calcutta 
Advaita Asrama.
