Conspiracy theory
I have been reading Karl Popper's 'Towards a Rational Theory of 
Tradition', ch. 4 in his Conjectures and Refutations (5th revised 
edition, 1989) -- with a view to considering the 'conspiracy theory' 
in the context of brahminical orthodoxy; i.e. the popular notion of 
a brahmin plot to oppress and control other ethnic groups, 
varnas/jatis, and women.  ( N.B. Popper's chapter does not 
mention India.) 
Can anyone direct me to further work on this, either responses 
to Popper or analyses of the brahmin connection? I would be 
much obliged.
