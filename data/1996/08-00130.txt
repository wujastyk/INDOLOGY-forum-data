Good grief, Dominik, have I said something refutable, and I don't even
remember what! Anyway, generally speaking I agree with you. The main thing
is to type Sanskrit texts, not to quarrel about how to. May I, by the way,
suggest that all typing of Sanskrit texts should be done with compound
analysis the way it is done in the TZ-format? Proper compound analysis makes
the texts fare more valuable for electronic analysis than entering the texts
in the way they appear in a Sanskrit book or manuscript. It is definitely
"value added" text entry!


Best regards,
