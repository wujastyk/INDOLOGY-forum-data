I CERTAINLY DID NOT SAY WHAT YOU QUOTE ABOVE!!!!!   IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.
Please look again carefully at the original messages and their email
headers.  I said something about the Soviet block, and someone else quoted
me, and then went on to make the above statement (among other, perhaps
more measured, points). 
Nota Bene!  If anyone wishes to argue about the above quotation, please
take the matter up directly with the person who sent it.  It is not an
indological topic, and I would be grateful if if further discussion about
"intelligent conversation" was conducted outside the INDOLOGY forum.
In other words, I'm hereby banishing "intelligent conversation" from
INDOLOGY.
