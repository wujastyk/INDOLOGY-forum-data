To the List,

   In response to Julia Leslie's resquest for info on work related to the 
'conspiracy theory' of brahminical orthodoxy  I'd like to mention Brian K. 
Smith's very detailed work "Classifying the Universe" (Oxford 1994). He 
begins his conclusion: "The varna system examined in this book supplied 
its propogators with a contrivance for classifying -- and thereby knowing 
and controlling -- the universe in its entirety." (p.314) Personally I 
don't buy it -- seems to me they would have cut themselves a better deal! 
But Smith presents an interesting case (or, indictment), and only after a 
very thorough study. His treatment covers classifications of the 
Universe, Society, Gods, Space, Time, Flora, Fauna, and Revelation.

   Incidentally, the conclusion also includes a quote from M.N. Srinivas: 
"Varna systematizes the chaos of jatis and enables the sub-castes of one 
region to be comprehended by by people in another area by reference to a 
common scale." (Rel. & Soc. among the Coorgs 1952, p.25)
