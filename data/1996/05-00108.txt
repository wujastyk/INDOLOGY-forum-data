With regard to Indo-European religion, I recall having seen an article by A.
Meillet in his _Linguistique historique et linguistique ge'ne'rale_ (Paris,
1948). I forgot the title of the article, but it is the very last one in the
book. Going by a study of words and names in the ancient Indo-European
languages for 'god', 'divinity' etc., he reached the conclusion that the
earliest, common Indo-European religious thought was extremely inchoate, and
that hence all the more highly developed forms of religion found among the
early Indo-Europeans had to be later local developments, perhaps largely
borrowed from non-Indo-Europeans.

I cannot say to what extent Meillet's findings have become outdated due to more
recent research. If these findings hold true, then they would be further
support for the idea of a borrowing of e.g. ideas of metempsychosis from India
by certain Greeks.
