Q: New Year
Hi,
As far as I know, the origin of the system is near or at the star zeta Piscis.
This star lies quite near the ecliptic (or zodiacal line). If the ecliptic is
then divided into 12 equal lengths, and this star is asumed to be the origin,
then the ayanaamsha can be calculated reasonably accurately.
Makar Sa.nkraanti marks, as you know, the start of the apparent movement of the
Sun towards the North (uttaraayaNa).
bye,
Girish Beeharry
