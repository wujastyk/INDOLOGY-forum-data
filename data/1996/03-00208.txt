I have recently seen a manuscript of the Ramacaritamanasa copied in AD 1819 
which is in both Nagari and Nastaliq scripts, each page being in two columns,
 one for each script.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I wonder if anyone else has ever seen similar dual script manuscripts of 
famous Hindi works, or for that matter other NIA or Sanskrit works?
