I was in Alandi less than a month ago. Always there has been a bit of a 
battering from the local pandaas, but it's really quite bearable. Thus it 
has not become overly commercialized, at least not when compared to 
places in north India such as Vrindaban. There is a new bridge over the 
Indrayani, just next to the mandir complex, which has also not much 
spoiled things. In short, Alandi remains beautiful, delightful, and 
(relatively) quiet.
