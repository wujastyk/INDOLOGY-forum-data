Help identiy the publisher of a recent book
I recently came across a reference to a recent book titled "Indian Heroes
and Heroines of World War II". The author is Vidya Anand, and it was
supposed to have been published in London.
I will be grateful to anyone on the list who could identify the publisher. I
would like to obtain this book.
Thanks in advance,
