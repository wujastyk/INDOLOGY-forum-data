Beatrice,
Last spring H-ASIA had quite a long thread discussing this very topic.
You can access their archives.  If this type of internet jargon is
difficult to understand, perhaps  Frank Conlon <conlon at u.washington.edu>
can help you.  Nonetheless, there is a copious amount of info concerning
the very topic about which you inquired in the  H-ASIA Fileserver.

**************
Below is an extract from the Welcome letter that is sent out
when a subscription is opened.  Section 10 explains how to obtain the LOG
files  from the listserv at msu.edu
Hope this helps.
