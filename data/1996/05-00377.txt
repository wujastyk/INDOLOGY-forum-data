Further to George Thompson's important inquiry concerning the identity of
Michael Jackson:

  According to the most esoteric Rauka UpaniSad, his real
name is mAyAkAla yakSa (the final letter "n" was added to confuse the
common folk).  He is a ghost that has deceived even the gods into thinking
he is a gandharva, he has accomplished this thanks to his powerful mAyA.
