*I am waiting for such an article. Have you already written it, Michael?:)*

- To Yvette Rosser and anybody else concerned about my likely going to jail: 
I am already doing more risky things....:) Thanks, anyway...
 
- I think Clinton etc. are concerned about e.g the traffic on the Internet 
of images and advertisements of children for sexual practices....I doubt 
that any politician can forbide the publication of a scholarly paper 
where proper and relevant pictures are published (and I wonder whether 
Clinton etc. are informed about the IJTS and even about Khajuraho...). 
The "indecency" of Khajuraho is nothing compared with the gifs and the 
msgs of certain newsgroups!

- However, I had a strange experience while teaching a Harvard graduate
course in Tantrism: a student told the class -- for ca. 12 min.-- about
her happy sexual matrimonial life (BTW, the person is 54-55!). The subjet
was totally irrelevant and improper but, unfortunately, the
pseudo-feminist in question claimed that was a significant contribution to
the study of Tantrism itself. The person was promoted, because of this and
other similar matters, to enter the PhD program from the MA, and I am still
paying for the consequences of my attempt to dedicate our
teaching/learning time to more scholarly matters. Well, I wish there was
such a Telcom Bill for classes! 

- I sincerely thank Lars Martin Fosse who has offered to move the 
Journal(s....both, I hope!) to Norway, in case of problems.
