Holi Discussion Appreciation
probably the discussion on 'chaos' has demonstrated that people in 
various academic fields have trouble understanding terms used in their 
disciplines than how holi is/can be interpreted.   a mathematician 
insists that it is a term from his/her discipline, hence fixed within 
his/her discourse.  and that it connotes negativity.  yet, in other 
field the term is less loaded-- similar to random, or unpredicatable. 
 even in art discussions 'chaos' has an unloaded meaning of the 
unpredicablity of artistic outcome.  it is not uncommon for one field 
(say literary criticism) developing a theoretical use of a term and 
that term is assimilated into another field and takes on new weight.
