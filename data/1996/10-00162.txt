Query:  Can this be true?
I have been given the following information (but have serious doubts):
1) That both jivata (life) and jivitam (alive)--which are morphologically
almost identical--originally functioned as a past participle of the verb "to
live"; 
2) That it is therefore possible to regard the Sanskrit for "I live in
Dehli" and "I lived in Dehli" as in some sense the same--at least poetically
if not strictly linguistically.  (It is this about which I have my doubts.)
While the first assertion is evidently correct, the second appears to entail
quite an interpretive stretch even in the imagic/poetic context.  
Can anyone tell me if such an interpretation might indeed be the case
nonetheless; and if so, how so; and if not, why not?
Thank you,
