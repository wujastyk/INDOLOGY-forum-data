Jains and Christians
You might try the Basel Mission records from coastal Karnataka (South 
Canara).  There, too, there were many Jains (esp. in the towns of 
Mudabidri and Karkala) and avid Christian (but Protestant) missionaries. 
I don't know if there are any records of their views of Jains or whether 
their views would reflect Christian missionaries generally, but you might 
try.
Prof. Heidrun Breuckner at Teubingan University is better versed in what 
the Basel Mission records contain than I.  There was an international 
seminar (academic) of the Basel Mission in India (mostly KA and Ke) 
several years back at Stutgart.  Perhaps one of the papers dealt with you 
topic.  You could contact Peter Kapp (I think) at Heidleberg (I think) 
for the titles of all the papers for that.
Sorry I can't be more precise: I'm about to leave on a 3 week vacation 
and can't look up any of my data on these matters right now. But the two 
individuals I mentioned are very knowledgeable.
