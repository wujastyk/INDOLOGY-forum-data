Subject: [Query] Was Sanskrit ever spoken by "all"?
Message-ID: <161227022975.23782.11894126344658282685.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Greetings!

I have a couple of questions on the evolution of language(s) in todays India.

a) Was Sanskrit spoken by the common folk also in olden days? I mean other
than the priests and the elite (?) in the society?

b) If not, what did the common folk speak?

Could you pl. recommend me some monographs/publications on this subject!

Herzlichen Dank!

mit freundlichen Gruessen,
Sreenivas
