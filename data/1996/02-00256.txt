[Query] Was Sanskrit ever spoken by "all"?
Greetings!
I have a couple of questions on the evolution of language(s) in todays India.
a) Was Sanskrit spoken by the common folk also in olden days? I mean other
than the priests and the elite (?) in the society?
b) If not, what did the common folk speak?
Could you pl. recommend me some monographs/publications on this subject!
Herzlichen Dank!
mit freundlichen Gruessen,
