Hi,
I was just trying to be funny so that you calm down to your ground state! :-)
Not at all! No need to apologize, please. 
The reason for which I mentioned Bohr is that he was one of the first to see
the fundamental problems of quantum physics. Yet, even he failed to see the
radically new ideas of Feynman.
I could not agree more! So let us take a concrete example and see how you 
paNDitas think: Suppose you read that Goraknaatha says that if one gazes at 
one's nose tip, the flow of thought is arrested. How do you understand this 
statement?
a) You read what all the 'great' people heve said on it and try to make a 
synthesis of their thoughts.
b) You go through the literature and try to find other similar statements by
other people.
c) You try to figure out what Goraknaatha means by this statement (and write a
paper on that:-).
d) You actually try to do what he says and see whether it is all nonsense.
You, very probably, will have many other options. I would try option 'd' first!
Yes it does. An electron has a finite probability of going through a piece of
matter, although classically it is not 'supposed' to do that. All trnsistors 
are based on this fact.
I agree, and a very careful study of the akshara 'ra' will involve formal and
empirical thought as well as this third 'piTaka'. You don't have to believe me
about the importance of 'ra', of course! :-)
Again, I wish to apologize for the low Indological content of this message!
Bye,
Girish Beeharry
