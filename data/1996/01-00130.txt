          International Conference in India
                 Call for Papers


The Society for Indian Philosophy and Religion will conduct a
four-day conference, "Relativism: Science, Religion and
Philosophy", to be held in Calcutta, India on August 1-4, 1997. 
The organizers invite proposals for individual papers, panels,
workshops, and round-table discussions.  

This conference represents an opportunity for scholars in the
U.S. and India to explore together a set of issues that are of
some significance to both communities.  It will examine ways in
which concerns that are currently widespread in the West over
relativism and scientific knowledge may be anticipated in
classical Indian philosophy and religion, and ways in which
contemporary Indian culture is responsive to such concerns. 
While the principal focus of the conference will be on the fields
of philosophy and religion, the organizers recognize that the
topic demands a wide variety of disciplinary approaches, and
welcome contributions from the full array of human sciences.

Proposals for papers, panels, workshops, and round-table
discussions should include an abstract of 150-200 words, and be
submitted by April 15, 1996 to:

     Dr. Chandana Chakrabarti
     CB 2336
     Elon College
     Elon College, NC  27244
     USA

The organizers are also interested in developing ways for
scholars in India and the U.S. to participate in future joint
activities and programs.  Dr. Chakrabarti will work with
individuals and groups in making concrete plans for their visits.
