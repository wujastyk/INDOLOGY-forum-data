They list Sita Ram Lalas's Brhad Rajasthani Kosh, vols. 1, 3 (pts 1-3),
4 (pts. 1-3) at a reasonable price ($4-l2 per pt. or vol.).  Lalas is
invaluable; there is also the recent Rajasthani-Hindi-English dictionary
by Bhamvaralala Suthara (Jodhpur, 1995), which is the only Rajasthani to
English dictionary available.

Badriprasad Sakariya's Rajasthani Hindi Sabda Kosa (3 vols.; Jaypur,
1977-1984) is another valuable tool.

All the above dictionaries tend to underrepresent Arabic and Persian terms
found in Rajasthani; for these Platts is more useful.
