yes and no
Dear Indologists,
On another list a cross-cultural study of "yes and no" has been done, and
is being discussed.  There are no references at all to any Indic languages.
I am aware of Skt om, tathA, evam, hUm, and na, nahi, etc. Can Indology
offer anything to this discussion?
Sincerely,
George Thompson
