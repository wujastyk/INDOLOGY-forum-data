Siddha Yoga
        In response to the inquiry from Leslaw Borowski, there is a summary
of the history of the Siddha Yoga movement in Timothy Miller, ed., _When
Prophets Die: The Postcharismatic Fate of New Religious Movements_ (Albany:
State University of New York Press, 1991) in a chapter titled "Siddha Yoga:
Swami Muktananda and the Seat of Power," pp. 165-81 & 232-38.
        Were the chapter to be written today, it would require considerable
revision in order to take into account subsequent developments and to be
freed from uncritically reliance on points of view put forward by the SYDA
Foundation.
        However, it is a useful starting point for further research.
