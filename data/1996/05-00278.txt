Certainly not.
There was certainly no such Greek astrology in the second millennium B.C.
when the earliest Vedic texts were presumably composed. If it had a
non-Indian source, that would be Babylonia where a type of astronomy
existed long prior to the Vedas. (We do not know what astronomical ideas
were current in or developed in the Indus civilization.)
The point here, however, is that Greek astronomy is more advanced than
earlier Mesopotamian astronomy (but perhaps not that of Babylonia
contemporary with the Greeks or at least not certainly so). Later Indian
astronomy contains those advances and includes even a number of Greek loan
words.
Unfortunately, your 'must be extant' is simply not the case. I am not sure
what the earliest specific record (that survives) of an astronomical event
is in India but it must I think be at least A.D. and is no help at all in
dating the earlier history.
I don't believe anybody who has looked at Pingree's work  and understood it
could possibly make such a claim. As regards the 'et al', I agree that some
of the earlier scholars were affected by the prejudices of their day. But
then practically everyone is affected by the prejudices of their day. It is
the measure of their achievement that, despite that, much of what they did
stands uncontestable.
