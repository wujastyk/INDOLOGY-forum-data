maRai, its meaning; WHOSE VEDA? - Bhaashya
One additionnal information on the word maRai
as it is used in tolkAppiyam (T) and its commentaries.
1. in the preface of T, attributed to pan_ampAraz_Ar,
 we meet with the expression
   "... nAn_ maRai muRRiya
    ataGkOTTu AcaRku ..."
 {the expression is translated by Kamil Zvelebil [JTS-1, 1972]
  as:
    "...of the Teacher of AtaGkOTu
    ripe in the wisdom of the Four Vedas"   )
  He probably relies on the commentary of iLampUraNar (XII cent.),
  which says: "nAn_ku vEtattin_aiyum muRRavuNarnta ataGkOTu
  en_kin_Ra Urin_ Acan_ukku" }
