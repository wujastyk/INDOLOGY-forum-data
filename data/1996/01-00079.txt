Nothing mysterious or metaphorical here...
Women in India apply a black substance
called "mai" (in Tamil) or "kaajal"
(in Hindi) around their eye rims as a beauty
aid.  It is also considered medicinal
(though I have heard women occasionally 
complain that the "mai" might be 
contaminated because it made their eyes 
burn).  It is also applied around babies' 
eyes.  Lastly, some women also apply it as 
a black mole-like "beauty mark" on the cheek.
The black substance is actually applied 
around the eyes using a small piece of stick 
(e.g., a broken broom twig).  I have also 
seen small sticks/rods made of silver for 
this purpose.

They gave you strange looks because
a male rarely has kaajal applied, unless 
he is either (1) a baby, or (2) a "hijraa"
(eunuch or hermaphrodite).
