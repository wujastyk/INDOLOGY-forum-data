Vedic Sacrifices
Taking this thread, would it be appropriate to pose another series of questions?
Why animal sacrifice? What is the economic advantage of using bones in smelting
operations by, say, a blacksmith, goldsmith, coppersmith or metallurgist?
Aren't bones reducing agents to oxidize baser elements to yield pure gold
or silver or other metal which had economic value?
