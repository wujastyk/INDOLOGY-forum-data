Indian Histories of India trans.
As far as I know, the best set of books for teaching Marathi was produced 
a few years ago by Maxine Berntsen and Jai Nimbkar, published by South 
Asia Regional Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia:
	An Intermediate Marathi Reader, Parts 1 and 2
	An Advanced Marathi Reader, Parts 1 and 2
	A Basic Marathi-English Dictionary
	A Marathi Reference Grammar
Besides these, there are some teaching materials published from Pune, 
India, by (Late) Dr. Suhasini Laddu, and others.  There is also an older 
publication by University of Pennsylvania Press : Spoken Marathi, by 
Franklin Southworth and Naresh Kavadi.
