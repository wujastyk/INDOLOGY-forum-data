Req: "dirty" words in Sanskrit
One of my beginning Sanskrit students this year asked me today if 
Sanskrit had any "dirty" words. As many students who step into my 
Sanskrit class assume, especially if they come to Sanskrit from an 
interest in the study of religion, she assumed that it couldn't possibly 
have any "dirty" words. Ever eager to disabuse students of the idea that 
Sanskrit is a language in which only spiritual or religious ideas can be 
expressed, I quickly assured her that it did have some such vocabulary. 
When asked for an example, I was stumped, red-faced and ashamed of my 
ignorance. Any suggestions will be most appreciated.
