'Fanciful' etymologies (was re. dating)
Hi,
This is a bit clearer to me now. The 'traditional point of view' is replete
with such ahistorical (I prefer this word to 'non-historical') etymologies. 
The exact philosophy of historical philologists is not very transparent, 
though. 
Could Dominik, and the other paNDitas, please examine one concrete example of
a 'culturally charged' word like raama, say? How do you analyse this word? 
Thanks in advance.
This whole discussion is quite fascinating! :-)
Bye,
Girish Beeharry
