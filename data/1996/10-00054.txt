Upanishads and their Vedas.
Hello!
I am looking for a comprehensive source which would provide me with a
listing of the Upanishads (the "genuine" 108 and perhaps the "ingenuine"
ones as well) and the Vedas/Vedic schools to which they belong.
I realize that there is one Upanishad which lists all 108 (the name eludes
me at the present, Muktikopanishad (?) perhaps), but am unaware as to 
whether or not it provides the name of the respective Veda from which it
comes.
I also browsed Renou's 'Vedic Literature' and a few others which outline
and classify these types of texts, but was left empty-handed. In any case,
I'd much appreciate if anyone could point me in the direction of any
sources which would provide me with the information I seek.
Thank you!
Regards,
