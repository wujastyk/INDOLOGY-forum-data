Veda`s demise at NY Hinduja Ctr.
dear peter gaeffke,
vedas and hindu religion should be interpreted by those who practise it to be
correct and scholarly in the interpretation . Many" neo hindu' persons
who only cram many books written by westerners and most of whom
are devoid of any fee;ing for the religion claim that they are the
real persons to interpret the hindu culure. In the process they make hinduism and
and its sacred books books cheap by writng titles like " whose veda is it "
Such statements may give a feeling of satisfaction to so called scholars
to write what they wish on hinduism , but all that is no good since it is devoid of feeling
which is the real essence of a religion as old as hinduism .
