	The following appeared in George Thompson's comment: "We all know
[I hope!] that living languages, like French, change, whereas
dead languages, like Sanskrit, don't."  Anyone working with vernacular
varieties of modern or medieval Sanskrit can vouch for the fact that even
the dead (???) languages like Sanskrit do change.  Just listen to the news
broadcast on All India Radio in Sanskrit everyday, if one needs proofs of
change.
