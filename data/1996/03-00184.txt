Right & Left
Dear girish  Beharry ,
You raised the question : Sometimes the devi is on the right side and
sometimes on the left . why this difference ?   The description of the
deva and devi depends on the temple where the bhakta is worshipping .
Not all temples have the devi on the same side of the deva. So if the bhakta
had a darshan of the deity in one way we see a sloka one way and if
a bhakta sees  the otherway then  there is a sloka the other way .
a famous example of thisphenomenon of change from right to left
is the murthy of Sri Nataraja where he is seen in all temples lifting 
the left leg but in Madurai Sri Nataraja is seen having his right leg lifted.
That Nataraja is also called  Kaal Maari Adiya Natarajar ( the Nataraja
who changed his leg ) which he did at the request of one his
great devotees who was also a king.)  M.Rajagopalanz
