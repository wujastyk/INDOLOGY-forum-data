  Suggestion for a review--

> This is an extraordinary new Gita. The review below is for a
> general Hindu audience, but other reviews are obviously
> desirable. The details are in the review.

> >>>EXCERPT FROM A BOOK REVIEW ("Hinduism Today", October 1995)
> 
> "This month we feature an extraordinary book, The Ribhu Gita, the
> Upanishadic discourse of the guru, Sage Ribhu, to his disciple,
> Nidagha. Its publication is a landmark achievement in the domain of
> Hindu scripture, making a previously unaccessible and virtually
> unknown, yet priceless and pure, Hindu teaching available to the
> English-speaking world. Following the review is an interview with
> Master Nome, the spirit behind this profound edition.
> 
> THE RIBHU GITA,
> [First English Translation from the Original Sanskrit Indian Epic
> Sivarahasya. Translated by Dr. H. Ramamoorthy, assisted by Master
> Nome. First edition 1995, hardbound, 432 pages, $25.00. Available
> from Treasures of the Heart, 1834 Ocean Street, Santa Cruz, CA, 95060,
> USA. Phone: (408) 458-9654 (US only), e-mail: ramana at cruzio.com]
> 
> How rare! How precious! How utterly lofty! How far beyond the everyday
> consciousness of humanity, yet how close to our most intimate
> yearnings! Thanks to the recent publication by the Society of Abidance
> in Truth, SAT, the Saivas now have their Gita, too--the Ribhu Gita, an
> apparently "ancient text" which, like the other Gita, is an extract
> from a much longer epic, in this case the Sivarahasya.
> 
> The interesting thing about this Gita is its unswerving focus upon one
> teaching only, that of the Self, or Self-God. "Tat Tvam Asi," "You are
> That." This lofty knowing permeates virtually all Hindu teaching, but
> we know of no other text where it is focused upon so exclusively or
> exposed at such length. In all, some 2,200 sutras are dedicated to
> this ultimate of truths."
> 
> .. (And so on...rare it is)
