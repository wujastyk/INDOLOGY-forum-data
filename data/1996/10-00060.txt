Dear Mikael,

Besides the series of books by Wilhelm Rau on Vedic material culture, which
perhaps you are already familiar with, there is an old article by Renou
["La maison v?dique"in JA 231, 1939].  There is also a recent publication
by Elizarenkova called "'Words and Things' in the Rgveda" which you may not
have run into yet [publ. by Bhandarkar Oriental Research Inst. as part of
the Prof. Gune Memorial Lectures, sixth series, 1995].  She briefly touches
on the Vedic grAma, describing it as more a less a heap of sheds and
awnings, mats and reeds,all very temporary, and sometimes even arranged
around a carriage.  She refers to such primitive material conditions as
reflective of the "material asceticism" of the Vedic Aryans....

Best wishes,
George
