Origin of retroflexes: answers to Hock's objections?

I have a very marginal note here (I am not familiar with the Dravidian
languages and can therefore not participate in the discussion at a higher
level).
Retroflex sounds in IA languages may have evolved as a result of the contact
between Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages, but they may also have evolved
for purely internal reasons. Such sounds also exist in some European
languages, among others in East Norwegian, where e.g. the consonant cluster
rt has developed into a retroflex .t. Thus, you will find that "kart" (map)
is pronounced ka.t in East Norwegian, and you get the minimal pair
                kart [ka.t]     katt [kat]
                =map            =cat
It is tempting to compare e.g. the development of Skt. k.rta > Pkt. ka.ta. 
As for the distinction between dentals, alveolars and retroflexes, we do not
know for sure if this distinction was alive and well in Northern India at
the time of the arrival of the Aryans. Hypotheses concerning the interaction
between Dravidian and IA languages will therefore remain hypothetic. If,
however, the Aryans developed a certain amount of retroflex sounds due to
internal phonetic development, they may have felt that Dravidian words with
alveolars - if they existed - "sounded" like words with retroflexes and
therefore adopted these words with retroflexes. There may, in other words,
be several reasons for the "retroflexisation" of IA languages.
