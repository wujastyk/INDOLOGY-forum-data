Sorry for the delay in responding.  I should have let you know that a few
days ago. Yes your article with the disk has arrived.  Here is the
confirmation of the acceptance of your article to be published in our
Journal of the Indological Society of Southern Africa in December 1996
issue.  Sorry again for the delay.
