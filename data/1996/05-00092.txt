I think volume 1 is the only one out so far, but since Prof. Cardona
follows this forum, perhaps he will let us know more.
It is a very comprehensive survey, and well worth using as a basic
reference work.
Start with Cardona's Panini: A Survey of Research.  Add a dash of
Belvalkar and Mimamsaka for Panini as well as the non-Paninian systems.
P-S Filliozat's _Grammaire Sanskrite Paninieenne_ (Paris: Picard, 1988) is
tool for doing Sanskrit grammar.
