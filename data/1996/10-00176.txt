One can get at this through the INDOLOGY web page.  From time to time
INDOLOGY has carried images -- and still has images of the Isa upanishad
and Yogasutras in manuscript -- and the responses of readers to these
could be looked up.  I also received a certain amount of private email
from appreciative viewers, and perhaps I could dig that out somehow.
Finally, she should send a message to INDOLOGY asking for people's input
on this topic directly.
Best wishes,
