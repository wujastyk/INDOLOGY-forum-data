       Book Title on East Indies?
       ---------------------------

The following question is with me for a long time. Hope some
learned member of the group can answer this query.


I read from a book by K. Zvelebil that some in Indonesia
use "cEntanAr's tiruppallANTu" (Tamil) during some festivals.

The book he cites is
G. K. Vanborough, The peoples in the East Indies.
The author and title may not be very exact, though very close.

Can anybody give the exact author, title, press and year please?
