A related question could be: Which came first: a. Writing? or b. Phonetic
analysis followed by logical arrangements of the units of speech?  If
writing came first, what was the previous order of the units of writing?
If the analysis came before writing their efforts are all the more
impressive.  The above may well oversimplify things--it is as likely
that both the analysis and writing co-occured/evolved over a fairly
long period.  We shall probably never know due to lack of data but
we can ask.
