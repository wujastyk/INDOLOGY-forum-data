Since "-&" put me up to this, I'll just throw in my 2 cents worth on 
chronograms:
-Some other good lists of words used in chronograms are D.C. Sircar's 
Indian Epigraphy, ppl.230-3; Bu:hler's Indian Paleography, pp. 84-86 
(of the first English edition, in Indian Antiquary 33); and P.V. Kane's 
History of Dharmasastra vol. V, pt.1, pp. 701-3.
-Chronograms are normally read in reverse order (ankaanaam vaamato 
gati.h), but there are occasional cases in which they have to be read in 
normal sequence; see e.g. Epigraphia Indica 34, p.178.
-Just as a curiosity, in Java I saw an example of a visual chronogram at 
the Sultan's palace in Jogjakarta, which gave the date of construction 
(in Saka era) in the form of a scultured ornament of a snake, etc., with 
implied numerical values (I don't remember the details offhand).  I think 
that this visual rendition of chronograms may have been a common practice in 
Indonesia, but I don't know of any Indian examples.
