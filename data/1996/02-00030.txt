Dear Colleague:

Thank you for your recent response to our request about the teaching of
Hindi and Urdu at your university, or at other universities in your
country.

I am pleased to say that we received quick and detailed replies to our
query from nearly all the universities we had time to ask.  (In only four
and a half days, we did not have time to contact all the institutions in
which Hindi and/or Urdu are taught, or to contact every country; moreover,
in a few locations, people were still away on winter holidays.)

With your help, we compiled a list of over 35 universities in Europe, the
U.S.A., Canada and Australia, in which there is instruction in Hindi and/or
Urdu.  We found:

        42 regular positions in Hindi
        17 regular positions in Urdu
        12 combined Hindi-Urdu positions
        690 students of Hindi
        162 students of Urdu

We are grateful for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse               Ruth Schmidt
