This lecture was published by OUP as a separate pamphlet with that title. 
My Indian impression published by OUP India is dated Delhi, 1978;  the
title page of this indicates that the work was first published by the
Clarendon Press, Oxford 1977.  I don't believe this lecture was reprinted
in any of Matilal's later collections.  However there is also some material
on debate and dialectic in his *Perception* (Oxford, 1986).
