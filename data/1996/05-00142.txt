Gymnosophists etc.

There has been extensive research on I.E. culture not only Meillet but also
by Benveniste, Dumezil and a host of other scholars working in the
Indo-European field. As far as transmigration is concerned, Caesar claimed
that the Celts believed in transmigration, but this has not been
substantiated by other independent sources. There are also some rather
vague indications of such beliefs among the Germanic tribes, but hardly
enough to be called evidence. In Greece, transmigration was only one of
several religious doctrines, and not a very important one, but the
Pythagoreans believed in it, and they are a fairly ancient sect. It is
therefore possible that transmigration was an esoteric idea that followed
certain groups of Indo-Europeans from a very early time and therefore pops
up in a limited context in other places than India, where it became the
all-conquering idea. (I personally do not believe that the ancient
Indo-Europeans had no variation as far as their beliefs are concerned. Why
should they all thing the same? We don't). But by all means: Greek ideas
about transmigration may indeed have migrated from the East! The point is,
however: If the idea also existed among the Germanic and Celtic tribes,
this would, in my opinion, lend support the notion that transmigration was
an inherited esoteric teaching among Indo-Europeans.
