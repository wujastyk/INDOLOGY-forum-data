no chair of Sanskrit in London
Sad news, Dominik. Would you happen to know if there exists a list of
Sanskrit positions in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States?
I fear that Sanskrit positions would have to be defended in more than one
place in the years to come, and that it would be a good thing to collect all
relevant data on Sanskrit teaching in the "Western" world, that is in the
areas mentioned above. If we pool such data, anybody struggling to uphold a
threatened Sanskrit position would have a data base upon which to draw!
Best regards,
Lars Martin
