Reference question (Was: Filliozat)
I believe Mr. Devadas is confusing the Maurya dynasty with the Gupta
dynasty. The Gupta dynasty had a ruler by the name of Chandra Gupta.
His son was Samudra Gupta and his grandson was Vikramaditya.
The Maurya dynasty on the other hand had its founder as Chandragupta Maurya,
whose son was Bindusara and grandson Ashoka. The Maurya dynasty predated
the Guptas significantly.
Thank you.
