Kahrs publications
David Magier asked about:
I am sorry, I do not know when and where E. Kahrs will publish his
dissertation. Why not ask him himself? Here is his address:
        Dr. Eivind G.  Kahrs
        University of Cambridge
        Faculty of Oriental Studies
        Sidgwick Avenue
        Cambridge CB3 9DA
        U.K.
His e-mail address is supposed to be:
         egk1000 at cam.ac.uk
but I have not yet used it and do not know if it works.
Best wishes,
                Georg v.Simson
