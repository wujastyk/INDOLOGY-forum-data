Agastya
Prof. Witzel wrote:
As the author of the paper I must correct Witzel's remark. 
Since Canopus (Agastya)'s declination is about 52.5 degrees south,
it can be seen at the place whose geographical latitude is less than
37.5 degrees north.  The less the latitude the longer is the period of
its visibility.  At the latitude of Delhi it can be seen AFTER
mid-August and for quite a long time.  The FIRST appearance of Agastya
was important and puujaa was performed.
