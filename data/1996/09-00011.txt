Dear Members
I am studying Nyaayavaarttika. I encountered a strange concept,
caramabhaava, pazcaadbhaava, caramabhaavinimitta or pazcaadbhaavinimitta.
Uddyotakara uses such a concept in many cases, with the special reference to
saadhakatama (it is appeared in the discussion of pramaaNa) and the definition
of karma
In the first case, he says
pramaaNe tu sati bhavantii bhavaty eva, so 'yam atizayaH saadhakatamatvam
ucyate.
yadvaan vaa pramimiite so 'tizayaH. kiMvaan pramimiite. pramaaNe sati
pramimiite, na
asati iti. ......... saMyogavac caramabhaavitaa vaa, yathaa vaa saMyogaH
pazcaadbhaavii
dravyazakitir bhavati tathaa pramaaNaM caramabhaavi pramaatRprameyayoH
pramaazakitr bhavati, pazcaadbhaavo 'tizayaH (NV ad 1-1-1, Calcutta edition
p. 19,1f)
In the next case, this concept is found in the interpretation of VS 1-1-17. 
The phrase "saMyoga-vibhaaga-anapekSa" must be interpreted into "without
another 
caramabhaavinimitta".(Such a interpretation sametimes appears in NV ad
1-1-12, p.
200; NV ad 2-1-33, p.482)
The caramabhaava or caramabhaavinimitta would be translated "final or succeeding
being (or cause)", but it is unfamiliar to me. In fact, such a concept is
found in
some works succeeding to Uddyotakara, some of which are obvious citations of
Uddyotakara. But. I can not find it in earlier works. So I wonder
whether such a concept is Uddyotakara's original, and if it is not, I feel a
hesitation to decide whether it is originated with VaizeSika tradition or not.
If anyone find the same or similar concept in earlier VaizeSika or other
School's
works, or know any paper referring such a concept, please teach me.
