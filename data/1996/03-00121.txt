Jacqueline Kennedy collection
3/12/96
      Moghul & Pahari Paintings
      *************************
I was watching TV news. They told that
the collection of late Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
are on sale. The catalog itself costs $ 100.
Kennedys collected many Moghul & Pahari paintings.
Hope the paintings reach a museum public collection so that
it is available for study. Does anyone know more about
the Kennedy collection?
