No sarcasm was intended.  But I do think that asking "western" linguists for
an explanation of the origin of Sanskrit that ignores the Indo-European
language theory is somewhat like asking a "western" biologist to account for
the human species without using the theory of evolution.
My familiarity with chaos theory is irrelevant.
On this we can agree.
I'm signing off until January.
