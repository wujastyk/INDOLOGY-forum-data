book search
dear members,
in our 'Sondersammelgebiet Indolgie/Suedasien' we try to collect as 
complete as possible. The following title came in as a 
inter-library-loan request, and we ordered it immediately. Now the 
order came back with the note:  'untraceble publisher/address'. 
Can anyone help?
The title is: 
Beyond the Texts : new approaches to the study of the Vedas. 
Proceedings of the International Vedic Workshop held at Harvard...
Cambridge, MA. 1995
Thanks for helping,
gabriele
