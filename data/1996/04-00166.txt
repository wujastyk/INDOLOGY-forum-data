Music: form, tambura
	I would like to add another book by B. Chaitanya Deva : 
Psychoacoustics of music and speech, The Music Academy, Madras, 1967.  It 
contains some of the same material as referred to by Srini, but has some 
more chapters dealing with "the psychology of the drone in melodic music".
