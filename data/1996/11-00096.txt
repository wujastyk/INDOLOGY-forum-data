yabh ity aadi
I'd like to apologize to Michael Witzel for talking about things which
clearly he knows more about than I do.  Unfortunately yabh- is just one of
those things that it is hard not to talk about, even in greatest ignorance.
I myself have noticed that there is in general great passion for this
subject on this list, although I confess that I do not have references to
support this view.
Sincerely,
George
