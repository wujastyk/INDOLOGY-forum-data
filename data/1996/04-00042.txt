Department of Political Science, University of Florida - Professor
           "Subaltern Politics Around Grazing Commons in a Rajasthani
Village, India"   [This work uses ongoing conflicts between raika
shepherds and farmers in Rajasthan, India to examine issues related to
domination, and the possibility of subaltern agency.  He develops two
themes on the basis of the empirical discussion on the formation of new
institutions around jointly used pastoral resources: resistnace and
domination take place only in relation to each other and
power is constitutive for both; subalternity is a shifting
rather than stable identity and depends of the resources and contexts
which actors in various subject positions use for their strategies.]
