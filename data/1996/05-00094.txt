   A request: I've been trying to send email to B. Kellner for quite some
time now, without success. My messages keep bouncing back. I've tried a
few different permutations on her address. All have failed - even copying
and pasting her address as it appears in messages to the group. Help
contacting her would be appreciated. The message is about the e-text of
Santaraksita's "Tattvasangraha", nearing completion, which she had 
expressed an interest in previewing. 
best, Tim Cahill
