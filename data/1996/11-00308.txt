I don't think borrowing from Hindi is really relevant, here -- that's 
something that always happens in multilingual situtations. I'd be *very* 
surprised if Kannada hadn't borrowed from Hindi, a language with 
which it has frequent contact, regardless of the power ratio or status 
of the two languages. Anyway, the Indic languages have also borrowed a 
lot from the Dravidian ones.
