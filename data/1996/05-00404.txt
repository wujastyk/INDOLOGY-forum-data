I remember reading a translation of the Pallava king Mahendra Verma's
Mattavilasa Prahasana - I thought at the time that it was a satire.
However, I'm not sure about the famous part - anyway how would you measure 
fame in the context of indology? Number of references in contemporary 
works/later works, variety of works/contexts in which a text or a part
of the text is cited? Though the Mahabharatha story may be known throughout 
India, this doesn't mean that Vyasa's work is famous - which makes it even
more difficult to measure fame.
