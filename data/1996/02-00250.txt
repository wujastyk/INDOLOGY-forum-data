to my knowledge "Barbara Allen" is generally considered an old folk song,
which is to say that it has no author and the songwriter is either
"composite" or anonymous. it is generally anthologized in books of poetry as
a song from Renaissance times in England, if I am not mistaken. The song has
been a long time favorite of Bob Dylan in live performance.
