jnaneshvar conference
I was privileged to visit the site of the mahasamadhi of Sant Jnaneshvar 
while attending the annual Marathi Sahitya Sammelan at Alandi on February 
3, 1996. I would agree, to some extent, with the observations of Robin 
Kornman and Frederick Smith that Alandi is still beautiful and serene 
despite the ever increasing number of hotels, restaurants, and commercial 
establishments.
	But I am more inclined to agree with John Grime's feeling that 
Alandi is a powerful Shakti Peeth. Standing before the samadhi of Sant 
Jnaneshvar is an incredibly overwhelming experience. It almost evokes in 
you the feeling of sacred that Otto has described so eloquently.
