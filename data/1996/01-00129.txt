Film on Holi
Yes, I know of a very good film on Holi in Braj. This was filmed and put 
together by Michael Duffy, a British filmmaker who has been living for a 
number of years in Vrindaban. Though the film is really wonderful and 
captures the flavor of Holi, it suffers from one defect: there are a few
places where interviews are not translated or dubbed from Hindi to 
English. Nevertheless, in its current state it is well worth viewing.
