Debates
You might begin with the articles contained in a book edited by Kenneth
Jones, <Religious Controversy in British India: Dialogues in South Asian
Languages> (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992).  The first
section, "Hindu-Christian Polemics,"  contains a number of interesting
pieces relating to your topic:  
1) "The Polemical Process in Nineteenth-century Maharashtra:  Vishnubawa
Brahmachari and Hindu Revival," by Frank Conlon;
2) "Arumuga Navalar and the Hindu Renaissance among the Tamils," by D. 
Dennis Hudson;
3) "Swami Dayananda's Critique of Christianity," by Kenneth Jones.
Each article also contains a bibliographical essay which I have found
quite useful.  Hope this helps,
