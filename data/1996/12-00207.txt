The message below is a slightly revamped version of a message I sent
earlier, but that apparently did not get through (at least it did not turn

I suggest that you check out the book by Mallory which I have recommended in
another email. Seen from the point of view of comparative linguistics in the
West, the details may be the subject of discussion, but not the general
model. The archaeologist Renfrew has attempted to introduce an alternative
model, but it is not an "out-of-India" model, rather an "out-of-Anatolia" model.
