Holi Discussion Appreciation
an innocent semantic question on this matter, and perhaps presumptuous to 
suggest re-interpretation of someone else' terminaology, but here goes-
could it not be that "chaos" was invoked--perhaps, still, in unforeseen 
error--in the sense prescribed by the more revolutionary fringes of 
sub-atomic physics?  if this were the case, it might actually be the 
genesis of a terminology which could actually be fair in describing 
cultural phenomena which do NOT easily mold themselves to stale 
generalizations of english.  in addition, such a usage of the term 
necessarily entails an admission on the part of the user (if, indeed, 
this were how the term was intended) that ultimate "graha" of the topic 
or issue is and will remain outside the purview of controllable, 
manipulable, and deginable data quanta?
whether or not this was the case with the usage of the word which has 
brought forth this controversy, i suggest consideration of these term 
pools related to chaos theory as they are perhaps quite reflective of the 
various ineffables entailed in study or discovery of the 
cultural/temporal/ethnic "other".
