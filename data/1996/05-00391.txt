Hi,
He cannot be Arjuna. If it were so his boon from Indra(?) would have fred
him from Urvashi's shaapa after one year spent in disguise. No, I stick to
the gandharva theory but again, he might be one of Nakul or Sahadeva, if
you really must have a paaNDava. I can never remember which one is
proficient in music and arts...
