Abstract of *Sexual Imagery on the _Phantasmagorical Castles_ at Khajuraho* by Michael 
Rabe 
The erotic component of Indian temple architecture has been called the most 
debated subject of Indian history. The paper is a marshalling of some of the most 
telling written and visual *texts* on the subject of medieval Hindu erotica as 
they pertain to or are found displayed upon temples at Khajuraho, justifiably the best 
known exemplars of sexual imagery in India.
The paper will be accompanied on our WWW pages (http://www.shore.net/~india/ijts/) by 
24 gifs.

Abstract of *The New Nina Fonts and macros for Devanagari* by Ludovico Magnocavallo
One of the first problems we had to deal with in publishing Sanskrit-
related material on the Internet is the lack of a standard codepage for 
representing Sanskrit characters that is suited for use with modern 
operating systems. Our solution to the problem of publishing Sanskrit together 
with other languages with diacritics is a new encoding, and a new set of fonts 
which are compatible with the current standards and operating systems. We are 
designing the Nina fonts and macros.

Enjoy the reading!
