Proto-Siva
Has anyone ever noted the similarity between the Proto-Siva on the Indus
seals and the Bison-horn Maria?  The headdress of the seated figure is
exactly like those worn by the Maria Gonds in Central India. It is composed
of bison horns with a long tuft of peacock feathers between them.  Although
these tribes now live in the jungles of Central India, their ancestors
probably lived all over the sub-continent, perhaps even in the Indus Valley
in the third millenium B.C.
I assume IV scholars have explored any such possible connections by now (and
probably dismissed them too).  Any references?
