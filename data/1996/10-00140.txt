New SAT WWW Page--Sri Ramana, Vedanta & Nonduality
Dear Allen,
You may be very interested in the new Home Page of SAT, the
Society of Abidance in Truth. It focuses on Bhagavan Sri Ramana
Maharshi, the great tradition of spiritual Nonduality in general,
and that of Advaita Vedanta in particular.
The address is:  http://www.SATRamana.org/
This is a page rich in many aspects of Nonduality.
Note especially the December 27-29 '96 Meditation Retreat.*
