Why not a definitive devnagri font

Anyway, my proposition rather translates into "If not everybody can have it
(=devanagari-e-mail) in one way, it is better for all not to have it, so
that all can have at least have something (=communication in
transliteration) in some way". 
As long as there is no lowest common denominator for ALL operating systems,
I'd rather stick to transliteration than restricting communication by
favouring solutions which are only possible on some operating systems, that
is, and that's all I have to say on this matter.
