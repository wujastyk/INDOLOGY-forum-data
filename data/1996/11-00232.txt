Sanskrit Grammar : Passive Causative
namaste,
Please refer to Siddhaantakaumudii, karmakartruprakaraNam,
vibhaashhaa chiNNamuloH (Sec. 7-1-69) -
   gaUNe karmaNi duhyaadeH pradhAne nIhrukrushhvahaam.h ||
   buddhibhakshaarthayoH shabdakarmakANaaM nijecchayaa ||
   prayojyakarmaNyanyeshaaM NyantaanaaM laadayo mataaH ||
For duh.h series (12 roots) - gaUNa (secondary object) will be used
  in passive voice.
nii, hR^i, kR^ishh.h, vah.h - pradhAna (important object) will be used
  in passive voice.
In case of Nic.h pratyaya - nijecchaya - choice is yours
This is very crude meaning from my side. This shloka was given to me by a
Sanskrit scholar at Aksharam, Samskrita Bharathi Centre. I was told that
a complete analysis of this shloka will answer your question !
Hope it helps.
