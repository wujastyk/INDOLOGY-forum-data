Although I haven't used them myself, I know of a number of solutions available.
You will find them at http://www.lainet.com/clr

PC Magazine run a review of at least one of these packages. You can find it at:

Besides, you may conduct a search on zdnet, which will include all their
publications. Their home page is at http://www.zdnet.com

Good luck,
