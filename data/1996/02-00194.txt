Ordering Sanskrit MS microfilms via INDOLOGY web page
On the first page of the INDOLOGY web page, I have mounted a rather
amateurish system for ordering microfilm copies of Sanskrit manuscripts
from the Wellcome Insitute's library.  I'd be interested in your
reactions.
The setup is amateurish because the UCL web server doesn't support CGI
programming at the moment (security risk).  So my workaround requires
you to upload a 140k file and to remember the shelf number and copy it
into an order form.  Still, it is easier than writing a letter. And if
you keep a copy of the MS list, and the order form, on your hard disk,
you need never upload them again. :-)
NB NB NB NB This is very much a trial.  Your web browser needs to
support "mailto".
