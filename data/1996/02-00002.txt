In Anantadasa's Bhaktiratnavali of c. AD 1600 the author uses the term 
Prakrit to refer to the language he uses. Yet this work is now referred to 
as a Hindi work.  
There is also a manuscript in this library that refers in its text to its 
language as Sauraseni bhasa, a term I take as referring to a kind of 
Prakrit. But this work is in a sort of Marathi.
There are also countless instances of 'Hindi' works referring to their 
language as simply bhasa.
My question is: do list members know of interesting instances of NIA 
language works referring to the language they are composed/spoken in . 
For instance, does anyone know what is the earliest text that refers to 
itself as being in Brajabhasa?
