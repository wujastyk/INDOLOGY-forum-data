Holi discussion.
dear moore ,
It is not innocent when someone insists on using abusive terminology
afterhaving been pointed out . Would you accept if a person uses abusive word against you and then says that
it is all done with innocence.
It is extremely unscientific attitude to insist on using incorrect and abusive
description against any society without proofs . Many  westerners did it and do it
against non-west societies . Some have stopped such practices after having been 
strongly reprimanded by other societies. it is not scientific to use
abusive words in a description of a society without justification . it is prejudice to do so
without proof . M.rajagopalan
