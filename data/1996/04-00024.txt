Some of you might find the gosti ('debate') genre of Hindi literature 
interesting in this regard. Gostis are quite common in manuscripts, although 
I think little published. Typically they consist of debates between persons 
such as Kabir and Nanak, Gorakhanatha and Kabir, Kabir and Raidas etc. 
However, they also include debates between persons who were not 
contemporaries and historical and mythical persons (such as Kabir, 
Gorakhnath and Ganesha). They are mostly parts of hagiographical traditions. 
Still they show many features of popular perceptions of what constituted 
debate in northern India from the 16th century onwards
