 CORRECT! These (largely) untranslated texts are usually neglected by 
 "Smith and several others".

I could not agree more. 

The materials in his "work and several others" are selective (almost
exclusively from translated sources) and there is no attempt to collect
counter-evidence.

Proceeding in this fashion, of course, you can posit and "prove"
anything... 

As a certain American colleague once told us about his own work: "I am happy 
if I can amuse them for a year or two". 

For the "several others" see the collected articles "Authority, Anxiety
and Canon" ed. L. Patton, SUNY 1994 and cf. the recent, very critical
review by J.W. de Jong, in the last issue of the Indo-Iranian Journal (1996)
