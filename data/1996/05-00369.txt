Images of India and Indians... Addendum
Since some of you have shown interest and appraciation in my
earlier posting, and to those who have asked for further
infomration on the subject, I post herewith some more references, 
not only in school textbooks but also in other print media, that
you may wish to consult for writing an article/paper on 'Images
of Stereotypes of India and Indians'. I may have missed some
publications due to my neglect of this subject for the past
several years. If it is the case please do post your findings to
the list.
