Smarta brahmins
Smartas are those people who recognise both Siva and Vishnu
and most brahmins in Maharashtra are supposed to be Smartas.
Where does this word come from? Can someone help me with the
etymology of this word and also with some background information 
on this topic? Thanking you in advance.
