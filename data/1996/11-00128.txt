[Q] India Office Library in London
Greetings!
I am planning to visit India Off. Library in London during my trip to U.K.
I tried to locate their web page but with no success. Do they have one?
Could someone please provide information about its location, opening times, 
whether photocopying facilities are available, etc. etc.!
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
