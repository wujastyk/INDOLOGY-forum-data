The original is available in microfilm from Library of Congress.
Copies of the film, at least, exist at LC and also at the Center for
Research Libraries in Chicago
(home page  http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/crlhp.html). Here is the
bibliographic record for the microfilm. I didn't find a record of the
reprint mentioned by Peter Friedlander.
